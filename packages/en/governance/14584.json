RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME X\r\n\r\n1902\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume closes the task, entered upon by me in April, 1895, of\r\ncompiling all the official papers of the Presidents. Instead of finding\r\nit the labor of a year, as I supposed it would be when I undertook it,\r\nthe work has occupied me closely for more than four years. A great\r\nportion of this time has been consumed in the preparation of the Index.\r\nThe Index is mainly the work of my son, James D. Richardson, jr., who\r\nprepared it with such assistance as I could give him. He has given\r\nhis entire time to it for three years. Every reference in it has been\r\nexamined and compared with the text by myself. We have endeavored\r\nto make it full, accurate, and comprehensive, with numerous cross\r\nreferences. There will be found in this Index a large number of\r\nencyclopedic articles, which are intended, in part at least, to furnish\r\nthe reader definitions of politico-historical words and phrases\r\noccurring in the papers of the Chief Magistrates, or to develop more\r\nfully questions or subjects to which only indirect reference is made or\r\nwhich are but briefly discussed by them. There will also be found short\r\naccounts of several hundred battles in which the armies of the United\r\nStates have been engaged; also descriptions of all the States of the\r\nUnion and of many foreign countries. We have striven earnestly to make\r\nthese encyclopedic articles historically correct, and to this end have\r\ncarefully compared them with the most eminent authorities. This feature\r\nwas not within the scope of the work as contemplated when the resolution\r\nauthorizing the compilation was passed, nor when the act was passed\r\nrequiring the preparation of the Index; but with the approval of the\r\nJoint Committee on Printing I have inserted the articles, believing that\r\nthey would be of interest. They contain facts and valuable information\r\nnot always easily accessible, and it is hoped that they will serve to\r\nfamiliarize the young men of the country who read them with its history\r\nand its trials and make of them better citizens and more devoted lovers\r\nof our free institutions. There has been no effort or inclination on my\r\npart to give partisan bias or political coloring of any nature to these\r\narticles. On the other hand, I have sought only to furnish reliable\r\nhistorical data and well-authenticated definitions and to avoid even the\r\nappearance of an expression of my own opinion. It is proper to add that\r\nthese articles have all been read and approved by Mr. A.R. Spofford,\r\nChief Assistant Librarian of Congress, to whom I now make acknowledgment\r\nof my indebtedness.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the plan originally adopted certain papers were\r\nomitted from the earlier volumes of this work. Referring to these\r\npapers, the following statement occurs in the Prefatory Note to Volume\r\nI: \"In executing the commission with which I have been charged I have\r\nsought to bring together in the several volumes of the series all\r\nPresidential proclamations, addresses, messages, and communications to\r\nCongress excepting those nominating persons to office and those which\r\nsimply transmit treaties, and reports of heads of Departments which\r\ncontain no recommendation from the Executive.\" In the Prefatory Note to\r\nVolume IX the statement was made that this course was a mistake, and\r\n\"that the work to be exhaustive should comprise every message of the\r\nPresidents transmitting reports of heads of Departments and other\r\ncommunications, no matter how brief or unintelligible the papers were in\r\nthemselves, and that to make them intelligible I should insert editorial\r\nfootnotes explaining them. Having acted upon the other idea in making up\r\nVolume I and a portion of Volume II, quite a number of such brief papers\r\nwere intentionally omitted. Being convinced that all the papers of the\r\nExecutives should be inserted, the plan was modified accordingly, and\r\nthe endeavor was thereafter made to publish all of them. In order,\r\nhowever, that the compilation maybe 'accurate and exhaustive,' I have\r\ngone back and collected all the papers--those which should have appeared\r\nin Volumes I and II as well as such as were unintentionally omitted from\r\nthe succeeding volumes--excepting those simply making nominations, and\r\nshall publish them in an appendix in the last volume.\" These omitted\r\npapers, with editorial footnotes, have been inserted in the Appendix,\r\nand appear in the Index in alphabetical order, so that no serious\r\ninconvenience will result to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe compilation properly closed with President Cleveland's second\r\nAdministration, March 4, 1897, but as the Spanish-American War excited\r\ngreat interest I determined, after conferring with the Joint Committee\r\non Printing, to publish the official papers of President McKinley which\r\nrelate exclusively to that war. These will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly assisted in the work of compilation by Mr. A.P.\r\nMarston, of the Proof Room of the Government Printing Office. Without\r\nhis valuable assistance in searching for and obtaining the various\r\npapers and his painstaking care in the verification of data the work\r\nwould not have been so complete. Mr. Charles T. Hendler, of the State\r\nBranch of the Government Printing Office, rendered timely aid in\r\nprocuring proclamations from the archives of the State Department.\r\nTo these gentlemen I make proper acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nThe work has met with public favor far beyond all expectations, and\r\nwords of praise for it have come from all classes and callings. Those\r\nwho possess it may be assured that they have in their libraries all the\r\nofficial utterances of the Presidents of the United States from 1789 to\r\n1897 that could possibly be found after the most diligent search, and\r\nthat these utterances are not to be found complete in any other\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nI close by quoting from the Prefatory Note to Volume I: \"If my work\r\nshall prove satisfactory to Congress and the country, I will feel\r\ncompensated for my time and effort.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nJULY 4, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMessages, Proclamations, Executive Orders, etc.,\r\nOmitted from Volumes I to IX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, _August 22, 1789_.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See message of August 21, 1789, Vol. I, p. 61.]\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States came into the Senate Chamber,\r\nattended by General Knox, and laid before the Senate the following state\r\nof facts, with the questions thereto annexed, for their advice and\r\nconsent:\r\n\r\n\"To conciliate the powerful tribes of Indians in the southern district,\r\namounting probably to 14,000 fighting men, and to attach them firmly to\r\nthe United States, may be regarded as highly worthy of the serious\r\nattention of Government.\r\n\r\n\"The measure includes not only peace and security to the whole southern\r\nfrontier, but is calculated to form a barrier against the colonies of a\r\nEuropean power which in the mutations of policy may one day become the\r\nenemy of the United States. The fate of the Southern States, therefore,\r\nor the neighboring colonies may principally depend on the present\r\nmeasures of the Union toward the southern Indians.\r\n\r\n\"By the papers which have been laid before the Senate it will appear\r\nthat in the latter end of the year 1785 and the beginning of 1786\r\ntreaties were formed by the United States with the Cherokees, the\r\nChickesaws, and Choctaws. The report of the commissioners will show the\r\nreasons why a treaty was not formed at the same time with the Creeks.\r\n\r\n\"It will also appear by the papers that the States of North Carolina and\r\nGeorgia protested against said treaties as infringing their legislative\r\nrights and being contrary to the Confederation. It will further appear\r\nby the said papers that the treaty with the Cherokees has been entirely\r\nviolated by the disorderly white people on the frontiers of North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n\"The opinion of the late Congress respecting the said violation will\r\nsufficiently appear by the proclamation which they caused to be issued\r\non the 1st of September, 1788.\r\n\r\n\"By the public newspapers it appears that on the 16th of June last a\r\ntruce was concluded with the Cherokees by Mr. John Steele on behalf of\r\nthe State of North Carolina, in which it was stipulated that a treaty\r\nshould be held as soon as possible and that in the meantime all\r\nhostilities should cease on either side.\r\n\r\n\"As the Cherokees reside principally within the territory claimed by\r\nNorth Carolina, and as that State is not a member of the present Union,\r\nit may be doubted whether any efficient measures in favor of the\r\nCherokees could be immediately adopted by the General Government.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners for negotiating with the southern Indians may be\r\ninstructed to transmit a message to the Cherokees, stating to them as\r\nfar as may be proper the difficulties arising from the local claims of\r\nNorth Carolina, and to assure them that the United States are not\r\nunmindful of the treaty at Hopewell, and as soon as the difficulties\r\nwhich are at present opposed to the measure shall be removed the\r\nGovernment will do full justice to the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n\"The distance of the Choctaws and Chickesaws from the frontier\r\nsettlements seems to have prevented those tribes from being involved in\r\nsimilar difficulties with the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners may be instructed to transmit messages to the said\r\ntribes containing assurances of the continuance of the friendship of the\r\nUnited States and that measures will soon be taken for extending a trade\r\nto them agreeably to the treaties of Hopewell. The commissioners may\r\nalso be directed to report a plan for the execution of the said treaties\r\nrespecting trade.\r\n\r\n\"But the case of the Creek Nation is of the highest importance and\r\nrequires an immediate decision. The cause of the hostilities between\r\nGeorgia and the Creeks is stated to be a difference in judgment\r\nconcerning three treaties made between the said parties, to wit, at\r\nAugusta in 1783, at Galphinton in 1785, and at Shoulderbone in 1786.\r\nThe State of Georgia asserts and the Creeks deny the validity of the\r\nsaid treaties.\r\n\r\n\"Hence arises the indispensable necessity of having all the\r\ncircumstances respecting the said treaties critically investigated by\r\ncommissioners of the United States, so that the further measures of\r\nGovernment may be formed on a full knowledge of the case.\r\n\r\n\"In order that the investigation may be conducted with the highest\r\nimpartiality, it will be proper, in addition to the evidence of the\r\ndocuments in the public possession, that Georgia should be represented\r\nat this part of the proposed treaty with the Creek Nation.\r\n\r\n\"It is, however, to be observed, in any issue of the inquiry, that it\r\nwould be highly embarrassing to Georgia to relinquish that part of the\r\nlands stated to have been ceded by the Creeks lying between the Ogeeche\r\nand Oconee rivers, that State having surveyed and divided the same among\r\ncertain descriptions of its citizens, who settled and planted thereon\r\nuntil dispossessed by the Indians.\r\n\r\n\"In case, therefore, the issue of the investigation should be\r\nunfavorable to the claims of Georgia, the commissioners should be\r\ninstructed to use their best endeavors to negotiate with the Creeks\r\na solemn conveyance of the said lands to Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"By the report of the commissioners who were appointed under certain\r\nacts of the late Congress by South Carolina and Georgia it appears that\r\nthey have agreed to meet the Creeks on the 15th of September ensuing.\r\nAs it is with great difficulty the Indians are collected together at\r\ncertain seasons of the year, it is important that the above occasion\r\nshould be embraced if possible on the part of the present Government\r\nto form a treaty with the Creeks. As the proposed treaty is of great\r\nimportance to the future tranquillity of the State of Georgia as well\r\nas of the United States, it has been thought proper that it should be\r\nconducted on the part of the General Government by Commissioners whose\r\nlocal situations may free them from the imputation of prejudice on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"As it is necessary that certain principles should be fixed previously\r\nto forming instructions for the commissioners, the following questions\r\narising out of the foregoing communications are stated by the President\r\nof the United States and the advice of the Senate requested thereon:\r\n\r\n\"First. In the present state of affairs between North Carolina and\r\nthe United States will it be proper to take any other measures for\r\nredressing the injuries of the Cherokees than the one herein suggested?\r\n\r\n\"Second. Shall the commissioners be instructed to pursue any other\r\nmeasures respecting the Chickesaws and Choctaws than those herein\r\nsuggested?\r\n\r\n\"Third. If the commissioners shall adjudge that the Creek Nation was\r\nfully represented at the three treaties with Georgia, and that the\r\ncessions of land were obtained with the full understanding and free\r\nconsent of the acknowledged proprietors, and that the said treaties\r\nought to be considered as just and equitable, in this case shall\r\nthe commissioners be instructed to insist on a formal renewal and\r\nconfirmation thereof, and in case of a refusal shall they be instructed\r\nto inform the Creeks that the arms of the Union shall be employed to\r\ncompel them to acknowledge the justice of the said cessions?\r\n\r\n\"Fourth. But if the commissioners shall adjudge that the said treaties\r\nwere formed with an inadequate or unauthorized representation of the\r\nCreek Nation, or that the treaties were held under circumstances of\r\nconstraint or unfairness of any sort, so that the United States could\r\nnot with justice and dignity request or urge a confirmation thereof,\r\nin this case shall the commissioners, considering the importance of the\r\nOconee lands to Georgia, be instructed to use their highest exertions\r\nto obtain a cession of said lands? If so, shall the commissioners be\r\ninstructed, if they can not obtain the said cessions on better terms,\r\nto offer for the same and for the further great object of attaching the\r\nCreeks to the Government of the United States the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\"First. A compensation, in money or goods, to the amount of $----,\r\nthe said amount to be stipulated to be paid by Georgia at the period\r\nwhich shall be fixed, or in failure thereof by the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Second. A secure port on the Altamaha or St. Marys rivers, or at any\r\nother place between the same as may be mutually agreed to by the\r\ncommissioners and the Creeks.\r\n\r\n\"Third. Certain pecuniary considerations to some and honorary military\r\ndistinctions to other influential chiefs on their taking oaths of\r\nallegiance to the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth. A solemn guaranty by the United States to the Creeks of their\r\nremaining territory, and to maintain the same, if necessary, by a line\r\nof military posts.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth. But if all offers should fail to induce the Creeks to make\r\nthe desired cessions to Georgia, shall the commissioners make it an\r\nultimatum?\r\n\r\n\"Sixth. If the said cessions shall not be made an ultimatum, shall the\r\ncommissioners proceed and make a treaty and include the disputed lands\r\nwithin the limits which shall be assigned to the Creeks? If not, shall a\r\ntemporary boundary be marked making the Oconee the line, and the other\r\nparts of the treaty be concluded? In this case shall a secure port be\r\nstipulated and the pecuniary and honorary considerations granted? In\r\nother general objects shall the treaties formed at Hopewell with the\r\nCherokees, Chickesaws, and Choctaws be the basis of a treaty with the\r\nCreeks?\r\n\r\n\"Seventh. Shall the sum of $20,000 appropriated to Indian expenses and\r\ntreaties be wholly applied, if necessary, to a treaty with the Creeks?\r\nIf not, what proportion?\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Senate proceeded to give their advice and consent.\r\n\r\nThe first question, viz, \"In the present state of affairs between North\r\nCarolina and the United States will it be proper to take any other\r\nmeasures for redressing the injuries of the Cherokees than the one\r\nherein suggested?\" was, at the request of the President of the United\r\nStates, postponed.\r\n\r\nThe second question, viz, \"Shall the commissioners be instructed to\r\npursue any other measures respecting the Chickesaws and Choctaws than\r\nthose herein suggested?\" being put, was answered in the negative.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the remaining questions was postponed till Monday\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY, _August 24_.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States being present in the Senate Chamber,\r\nattended by General Knox--\r\n\r\nThe Senate resumed the consideration of the state of facts, and\r\nquestions thereto annexed, laid before them by the President of the\r\nUnited States on Saturday last; and the first question, viz, \"In the\r\npresent state of affairs between North Carolina and the United States\r\nwill it be proper to take any other measures for redressing the injuries\r\nof the Cherokees than the one herein suggested?\" being put, was answered\r\nin the negative.\r\n\r\nThe third question, viz, \"If the commissioners shall adjudge that the\r\nCreek Nation was fully represented at the three treaties with Georgia,\r\nand that the cessions of land Were obtained with the full understanding\r\nand free consent of the acknowledged proprietors, and that the said\r\ntreaties ought to be considered as just and equitable, in this case\r\nshall the commissioners be instructed to insist on a formal renewal and\r\nconfirmation thereof, and in case of a refusal shall they be instructed\r\nto inform the Creeks that the arms of the Union shall be employed to\r\ncompel them to acknowledge the justice of the said cessions?\" was wholly\r\nanswered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThe fourth question and its four subdivisions, \"But if the commissioners\r\nshall adjudge that the said treaties were formed with an inadequate or\r\nunauthorized representation of the Creek Nation, or that the treaties\r\nwere held under circumstances of constraint or unfairness of any sort,\r\nso that the United States could not with justice and dignity request or\r\nurge a confirmation thereof, in this case shall the commissioners,\r\nconsidering the importance of the Oconee lands to Georgia, be instructed\r\nto use their highest exertions to obtain a cession of said lands? If so,\r\nshall the commissioners be instructed, if they can not obtain the said\r\ncessions on better terms, to offer for the same and for the further\r\ngreat object of attaching the Creeks to the Government of the United\r\nStates the following conditions: First. A compensation, in money or\r\ngoods, to the amount of $----, the said amount to be stipulated to be\r\npaid by Georgia at the period which shall be fixed, or in failure\r\nthereof by the United States. Second. A secure port on the Altamaha or\r\non St. Marys River, or at any other place between the same as may be\r\nmutually agreed to by the commissioners and the Creeks. Third. Certain\r\npecuniary considerations to some and honorary military distinctions to\r\nother influential chiefs on their taking oaths of allegiance to the\r\nUnited States. Fourth. A solemn guaranty by the United States to the\r\nCreeks of their remaining territory, and to maintain the same, if\r\nnecessary, by a line of military posts,\" was wholly answered in the\r\naffirmative. The blank to be filled at the discretion of the President\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe fifth question, viz, \"But if all offers should fail to induce the\r\nCreeks to make the desired cessions to Georgia, shall the commissioners\r\nmake it an ultimatum?\" was answered in the negative.\r\n\r\nThe sixth question being divided, the first part, containing as follows,\r\nviz, \"If the said cessions shall not be made an ultimatum, shall the\r\ncommissioners proceed and make a treaty and include the disputed lands\r\nwithin the limits which shall be assigned to the Creeks?\" was answered\r\nin the negative.\r\n\r\nThe remainder, viz: \"If not, shall a temporary boundary be marked making\r\nthe Oconee the line, and the other parts of the treaty be concluded?\"\r\n\r\n\"In this case shall a secure port be stipulated and the pecuniary and\r\nhonorary considerations granted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is other general objects shall the treaties formed at Hopewell with the\r\nCherokees, Chickesaws, and Choctaws be the basis of a treaty with the\r\nCreeks?\" were all answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh question, viz, \"Shall the sum of $20,000 appropriated\r\nto Indian expenses and treaties be wholly applied, if necessary, to\r\na treaty with the Creeks? If not, what proportion?\" it was agreed to\r\nadvise and consent to appropriate the whole sum, if necessary, at the\r\ndiscretion of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States withdrew from the Senate Chamber, and\r\nthe Vice-President put the question of adjournment, to which the Senate\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _September 26, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving yesterday received a letter written in this month by the governor\r\nof Rhode Island at the request and in behalf of the general assembly of\r\nthat State, addressed to the President, the Senate, and the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the eleven United States of America in Congress\r\nassembled, I take the earliest opportunity of laying a copy of it before\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nGo. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS,\r\n  _In General Assembly, September Session, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_To the President, the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the\r\nEleven United States of America in Congress assembled_:\r\n\r\nThe critical situation in which the people of this State are placed\r\nengage us to make these assurances on their behalf of their attachment\r\nand friendship to their sister States and of their disposition to\r\ncultivate mutual harmony and friendly intercourse. They know themselves\r\nto be a handful, comparatively viewed; and although they now stand, as\r\nit were, alone, they have not separated themselves or departed from the\r\nprinciples of that Confederation which was formed by the sister States\r\nin their struggle for freedom and in the hour of danger. They seek by\r\nthis memorial to call to your remembrance the hazards which we have run,\r\nthe hardships we have endured, the treasure we have spent, and the blood\r\nwe have lost together in one common cause, and especially the object\r\nwe had in view--the preservation of our liberty; wherein, ability\r\nconsidered, they may truly say they were equal in exertions with the\r\nforemost, the effects whereof, in great embarrassments and other\r\ndistresses consequent thereon, we have since experienced with severity;\r\nwhich common sufferings and common danger we hope and trust yet form a\r\nbond of union and friendship not easily to be broken.\r\n\r\nOur not having acceded to or adopted the new system of government formed\r\nand adopted by most of our sister States we doubt not have given\r\nuneasiness to them. That we have not seen our way clear to do it\r\nconsistent with our idea of the principles upon which we all embarked\r\ntogether has also given pain to us. We have not doubted but we might\r\nthereby avoid present difficulties, but we have apprehended future\r\nmischief. The people of this State from its first settlement have been\r\naccustomed and strongly attached to a democratical form of government.\r\nThey have viewed in the Constitution an approach, though perhaps but\r\nsmall, toward that form of government from which we have lately\r\ndissolved our connection at so much hazard and expense of life and\r\ntreasure; they have seen with pleasure the administration thereof from\r\nthe most important trust downward committed to men who have highly\r\nmerited and in whom the people of the United States place unbounded\r\nconfidence. Yet even in this circumstance, in itself so fortunate, they\r\nhave apprehended danger by way of precedent. Can it be thought strange,\r\nthen, that with these impressions they should wait to see the proposed\r\nsystem organized and in operation, to see what further checks and\r\nsecurities would be agreed to and established, by way of amendments,\r\nbefore they could adopt it as a constitution of government for\r\nthemselves and their posterity? These amendments, we believe, have\r\nalready afforded some relief and satisfaction to the minds of the people\r\nof this State, and we earnestly look for the time when they may with\r\nclearness and safety be again united with their sister States under a\r\nconstitution and form of government so well poised as neither to need\r\nalteration or be liable thereto by a majority only of nine States out of\r\nthirteen--a circumstance which may possibly take place against the sense\r\nof a majority of the people of the United States. We are sensible of the\r\nextremes to which democratical government is sometimes liable, something\r\nof which we have lately experienced; but we esteem them temporary and\r\npartial evils compared with the loss of liberty and the rights of a free\r\npeople. Neither do we apprehend they will be marked with severity by our\r\nsister States when it is considered that during the late trouble the\r\nwhole United States, notwithstanding their joint wisdom and efforts,\r\nfell into the like misfortune; that from our extraordinary exertions\r\nthis State was left in a situation nearly as embarrassing as that\r\nduring the war; that in the measures which were adopted government\r\nunfortunately had not that aid and support from the moneyed interest\r\nwhich our sister States of New York and the Carolinas experienced under\r\nsimilar circumstances; and especially when it is considered that upon\r\nsome abatement of that fermentation in the minds of the people which is\r\nso common in the collision of sentiments and of parties a disposition\r\nappears to provide a remedy for the difficulties we have labored under\r\non that account. We are induced to hope that we shall not be altogether\r\nconsidered as foreigners having no particular affinity or connection\r\nwith the United States, but that trade and commerce, upon which the\r\nprosperity of this State much depends, will be preserved as free and\r\nopen between this and the United States as our different situations at\r\npresent can possibly admit; earnestly desiring and proposing to adopt\r\nsuch commercial regulations on our part as shall not tend to defeat the\r\ncollection of the revenue of the United States, but rather to act in\r\nconformity to or cooperate therewith, and desiring also to give the\r\nstrongest assurances that we shall during our present situation use our\r\nutmost endeavors to be in preparation from time to time to answer our\r\nproportion of such part of the interest or principal of the foreign and\r\ndomestic debt as the United States shall judge expedient to pay and\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nWe feel ourselves attached by the strongest ties of friendship, kindred,\r\nand of interest with our sister States, and we can not without the\r\ngreatest reluctance look to any other quarter for those advantages of\r\ncommercial intercourse which we conceive to be more natural and\r\nreciprocal between them and us.\r\n\r\nI am, at the request and in behalf of the general assembly, your most\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN COLLINS, _Governor_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 9, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nAmong the persons appointed during the last session to offices under the\r\nNational Government there were some who declined serving. Their names\r\nand offices are specified in the first column of the foregoing list.[2]\r\nI supplied these vacancies, agreeably to the Constitution, by temporary\r\nappointments, which you will find mentioned in the second column of the\r\nlist. These appointments will expire with your present session, and,\r\nindeed, ought not to endure longer than until others can be regularly\r\nmade. For that purpose I now nominate to you the persons named in the\r\nthird column of the list as being, in my opinion, qualified to fill the\r\noffices opposite to their names in the first.\r\n\r\nGo. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 14, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving informed Congress of the expedition which had been directed\r\nagainst certain Indians northwest of the Ohio, I embrace the earliest\r\nopportunity of laying before you the official communications which have\r\nbeen received upon that subject.\r\n\r\nGo. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following was transmitted with the message of January 26, 1791 (see\r\nVol. I, p. 95).]\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Vol. II, 2116-2118.]\r\n\r\nPARIS, _June 20, 1790_.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly has worn during three days mourning for Benjamin\r\nFranklin, your fellow-citizen, your friend, and one of the most useful\r\nof your cooperators in the establishment of American liberty. They\r\ncharge me to communicate their resolution to the Congress of the United\r\nStates. In consequence I have the honor to address to you, Mr.\r\nPresident, the extract from the proceedings of their session of the 11th\r\nwhich contains the deliberations.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly have not been stopped in their decree by the\r\nconsideration that Franklin was a stranger. Great men are the fathers of\r\nuniversal humanity; their loss ought to be felt as a common misfortune\r\nby all the tribes of the great human family; and it belongs without\r\ndoubt to a nation still affected by all the sentiments which accompany\r\nthe achievement of their liberty, and which owes its enfranchisement\r\nessentially to the progress of the public reason, to be the first to\r\ngive the example of the filial gratitude of the people toward their true\r\nbenefactors. Besides that, these ideas and this example are so proper to\r\ndisseminate a happy emulation of patriotism, and thus to extend more and\r\nmore the empire of reason and virtue, which could not fail promptly to\r\ndetermine a body devoted to the most important legislative combinations.\r\nCharged with assuring to the French the rights of men and citizens, it\r\nhas believed without doubt that fruitful and great truths were likewise\r\nnumbered among the rights of man.\r\n\r\nThe name of Benjamin Franklin will be immortal in the records of freedom\r\nand philosophy, but it is more particularly dear to a country where,\r\nconducted by the most sublime mission, this venerable man grew very\r\nsoon to acquire an infinite number of friends and admirers as well by\r\nthe simplicity and sweetness of his manners as by the purity of his\r\nprinciples, the extent of his knowledge, and the charms of his mind.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that every success which he obtained in his\r\nimportant negotiation was applauded and celebrated (so to express it)\r\nall over France as so many crowns conferred on genius and virtue.\r\n\r\nEven then the sentiment of our rights existed in the bottom of our\r\nsouls. It was easily perceived that it feelingly mingled in the interest\r\nwhich we took in America and in the public vows which we preferred for\r\nyour liberty.\r\n\r\nAt last the hour of the French has arrived. We love to think that the\r\ncitizens of the United States have not regarded with indifference our\r\nsteps toward liberty. Twenty-six millions of men breaking their chains\r\nand seriously occupied in giving themselves a durable constitution are\r\nnot unworthy the esteem of a generous people who have preceded them in\r\nthat noble career.\r\n\r\nWe hope they will learn with interest the funeral homage which we\r\nhave rendered the Nestor of America. May this solemn act of fraternal\r\nfriendship serve more and more to bind the tie which ought to unite two\r\nfree nations. May the common enjoyment of liberty shed itself over the\r\nwhole globe and become an indissoluble chain of connection among all\r\nthe people of the earth. For ought they not to perceive that they will\r\nmarch more steadfastly and more certainly to their true happiness in\r\nunderstanding and loving each other than in being jealous and fighting?\r\n\r\nMay the Congress of the United States and the National Assembly of\r\nFrance be the first to furnish this fine spectacle to the world! And\r\nmay the individuals of the two nations connect themselves by a mutual\r\naffection worthy of the friendship which unites the two men at this\r\nday most illustrious by their exertions for liberty--Washington and\r\nLafayette!\r\n\r\nPermit me, Mr. President, to offer on this occasion my particular homage\r\nof esteem and admiration.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with respectful consideration, Mr. President,\r\nyour most humble and most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nSIEVÈS, _President_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECREE OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF THE 11TH OF JUNE, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly decree that their members shall wear during three\r\ndays mourning for Benjamin Franklin, to commence on Monday next; that\r\nthe discourse pronounced on this occasion be printed, and that the\r\npresident write to the American Congress in the name of the National\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nCompared with the original by us, president and secretaries of the\r\nNational Assembly, at Paris, June 10, 1790.\r\n\r\n  SIEVÈS, _President_.\r\n  GOUDAU,\r\n  FÉLIX DE PARDIEU,\r\n  DUMOUCHET,\r\n  _Secretaries_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 18, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from the Secretary of State a report on the proceedings\r\nof the governor of the Northwestern Territory at Kaskaskia, Kahokia,\r\nand Prairie under the resolution of Congress of August 29, 1788, which,\r\ncontaining matter proper for your consideration, I lay the same before\r\nyou.[3]\r\n\r\nGo.

You have strengthened those\r\nsacred ties by the declarations which the minister plenipotentiary of\r\nthe United States has made in your name to the National Convention and\r\nto the French people. They have been received with rapture by a nation\r\nwho know how to appreciate every testimony which the United States have\r\ngiven to them of their affection. The colors of both nations, united in\r\nthe center of the National Convention, will be an everlasting evidence\r\nof the part which the United States have taken in the success of the\r\nFrench Republic.\r\n\r\nYou were the first defenders of the rights of man in another hemisphere.\r\nStrengthened by your example and endowed with an invincible energy,\r\nthe French people have vanquished that tyranny which during so many\r\ncenturies of ignorance, superstition, and baseness had enchained a\r\ngenerous nation.\r\n\r\nSoon did the people of the United States perceive that every victory of\r\nours strengthened their independence and happiness. They were deeply\r\naffected at our momentary misfortunes, occasioned by treasons purchased\r\nby English gold. They have celebrated with rapture the successes of our\r\nbrave armies.\r\n\r\nNone of these sympathetic emotions have escaped the sensibility of the\r\nFrench nation. They have all served to cement the most intimate and\r\nsolid union that has ever existed between two nations.\r\n\r\nThe citizen Adet, who will reside near your Government in quality\r\nof minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic, is especially\r\ninstructed to tighten these bands of fraternity and mutual benevolence.\r\nWe hope that he may fulfill this principal object of his mission by a\r\nconduct worthy of the confidence of both nations and of the reputation\r\nwhich his patriotism and virtues have acquired him.\r\n\r\nAn analogy of political principles; the natural relations of commerce\r\nand industry; the efforts and immense sacrifices of both nations in the\r\ndefense of liberty and equality; the blood which they have spilled\r\ntogether; their avowed hatred for despots; the moderation of their\r\npolitical views; the disinterestedness of their counsels, and especially\r\nthe success of the vows which they have made, in presence of the Supreme\r\nBeing, to be free or die, all combine to render indestructible the\r\nconnections which they have formed.\r\n\r\nDoubt it not, citizens, we shall finally destroy the combination of\r\ntyrants--you by the picture of prosperity which in your vast country has\r\nsucceeded to a bloody struggle of eight years; we by that enthusiasm\r\nwhich glows in the breast of every Frenchman. Astonished nations, too\r\nlong the dupes of perfidious kings, nobles, and priests, will eventually\r\nrecover their rights, and the human race will owe to the American and\r\nFrench nations their regeneration and a lasting peace.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Committee of Public Safety,\r\n\r\n  J.S.B. DELMAS,\r\n  MERLIN (OF DOUAI), ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic to the President\r\nof the United States_.\r\n\r\nMr. PRESIDENT: I come to acquit myself of a duty very dear to my heart.\r\nI come to deposit in your hands and in the midst of a people justly\r\nrenowned for their courage and their love of liberty the symbol of the\r\ntriumphs and of the enfranchisement of my nation.\r\n\r\nWhen she broke her chains; when she proclaimed the imprescriptible\r\nrights of man; when in a terrible war she sealed with her blood the\r\ncovenant she had made with liberty, her own happiness was not alone\r\nthe object of her glorious efforts; her views extended also to all free\r\npeople. She saw their interest blended with her own, and doubly rejoiced\r\nin her victories, which in assuring to her the enjoyment of her rights\r\nbecame to them new guaranties of their independence.\r\n\r\nThese sentiments, which animated the French nation from the dawn of\r\ntheir revolution, have acquired new strength since the foundation\r\nof the Republic. France at that time, by the form of its Government,\r\nassimilated to, or rather identified with, free people, saw in them only\r\nfriends and brothers. Long accustomed to regard the American people as\r\nher most faithful allies, she has sought to draw closer the ties already\r\nformed in the fields of America, under the auspices of victory, over the\r\nruins of tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe National Convention, the organ of the will of the French nation,\r\nhave more than once expressed their sentiments to the American people,\r\nbut above all these burst forth on that august day when the minister of\r\nthe United States presented to the National Representation the colors of\r\nhis country. Desiring never to lose recollections as dear to Frenchmen\r\nas they must be to Americans, the Convention ordered that these colors\r\nshould be placed in the hall of their sittings. They had experienced\r\nsensations too agreeable not to cause them to be partaken of by their\r\nallies, and decreed that to them the national colors should be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I do not doubt their expectation will be fulfilled, and\r\nI am convinced that every citizen will receive with a pleasing emotion\r\nthis flag, elsewhere the terror of the enemies of liberty, here the\r\ncertain pledge of faithful friendship, especially when they recollect\r\nthat it guides to combat men who have shared their toils and who were\r\nprepared for liberty by aiding them to acquire their own.\r\n\r\nP.A. ADET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Answer of the President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 1, 1796_.\r\n\r\nBorn, sir, in a land of liberty; having early learned its value; having\r\nengaged in a perilous conflict to defend it; having, in a word, devoted\r\nthe best years of my life to secure its permanent establishment in my\r\nown country, my anxious recollections, my sympathetic feelings, and my\r\nbest wishes are irresistibly excited whensoever in any country I see\r\nan oppressed nation unfurl the banners of freedom. But above all, the\r\nevents of the French Revolution have produced the deepest solicitude\r\nas well as the highest admiration. To call your nation brave were to\r\npronounce but common praise. Wonderful people! Ages to come will read\r\nwith astonishment the history of your brilliant exploits! I rejoice that\r\nthe period of your toils and of your immense sacrifices is approaching.\r\nI rejoice that the interesting revolutionary movements of so many\r\nyears have issued in the formation of a constitution designed to give\r\npermanency to the great object for which you have contended. I rejoice\r\nthat liberty, which you have so long embraced with enthusiasm--liberty,\r\nof which you have been the invincible defenders--now finds an asylum in\r\nthe bosom of a regularly organized Government, a Government which, being\r\nformed to secure the happiness of the French people, corresponds with\r\nthe ardent wishes of my heart, while it gratifies the pride of every\r\ncitizen of the United States by its resemblance to their own. On these\r\nglorious events accept, sir, my sincere congratulations.\r\n\r\nIn delivering to you these sentiments I express not my own feelings\r\nonly, but those of my fellow-citizens, in relation to the commencement,\r\nthe progress, and the issue of the French Revolution, and they will\r\ncordially join with me in purest wishes to the Supreme Being that the\r\ncitizens of our sister Republic, our magnanimous allies, may soon enjoy\r\nin peace that liberty which they have purchased at so great a price,\r\nand all the happiness which liberty can bestow.\r\n\r\nI receive, sir, with lively sensibility the symbol of the triumphs and\r\nof the enfranchisement of your nation, the colors of France, which you\r\nhave now presented to the United States. The transaction will be\r\nannounced to Congress, and the colors will be deposited with those\r\narchives of the United States which are at once the evidences and the\r\nmemorials of their freedom and independence. May these be perpetual,\r\nand may the friendship of the two Republics be commensurate with their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nGo.

The objects of these\r\nacts were understood to be to purchase from the Indians south of the\r\nOhio some portions of land peculiarly interesting to the Union or to\r\nparticular States and the establishment of certain roads to facilitate\r\ncommunication with our distant settlements. Commissioners were\r\naccordingly appointed to treat with the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws,\r\nand Creeks. As these nations are known to be very jealous on the subject\r\nof their lands, the commissioners were instructed, as will be seen by\r\nthe inclosed extract, to enlarge, restrain, or even to suppress\r\npropositions as appearances should indicate to be expedient. Their first\r\nmeeting was with the Cherokees. The extract from the speech of our\r\ncommissioners and the answers of the Cherokee chiefs will show the\r\ncaution of the former and the temper of the latter, and that though our\r\novertures to them were moderate and respectful of their rights, their\r\ndetermination was to yield no accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners proceeded then to the Chickasaws, who discovered at\r\nfirst considerable alarm and anxiety lest land should be asked of them.\r\nA just regard for this very friendly nation, whose attachment to us has\r\nbeen invariable, forbade the pressure of anything disagreeable on them,\r\nand they yielded with alacrity the road through their country which was\r\nasked and was essential to our communication with the Mississippi\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nThe conferences with the Choctaws are probably ended, but as yet we are\r\nnot informed of their result. Those with the Creeks are not expected to\r\nbe held till the ensuing spring.\r\n\r\nTH: JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 17, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before both Houses of Congress, for their information, the report\r\nfrom the Director of the Mint, now inclosed.\r\n\r\nTH: JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 25, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe act fixing the military peace establishment of the United States\r\nrendering it necessary that the officers retained in service should in\r\nmost cases be transferred into regiments different from those to which\r\ntheir commissions attach them, new commissions are deemed necessary for\r\nthem, as well as for those entitled to promotion and for the ensigns\r\nnewly nominated.

Indeed, hope seems to have deserted the minds of men. All classes\r\nare in a state of confusion and dismay, and the wisest counsels of our\r\nbest and purest men are wholly disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn this the hour of our calamity and peril to whom shall we resort for\r\nrelief but to the God of our fathers? His omnipotent arm only can save\r\nus from the awful effects of our own crimes and follies--our own\r\ningratitude and guilt toward our Heavenly Father.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, with deep contrition and penitent sorrow unite in humbling\r\nourselves before the Most High, in confessing our individual and\r\nnational sins, and in acknowledging the justice of our punishment. Let\r\nus implore Him to remove from our hearts that false pride of opinion\r\nwhich would impel us to persevere in wrong for the sake of consistency\r\nrather than yield a just submission to the unforeseen exigencies by\r\nwhich we are now surrounded. Let us with deep reverence beseech Him to\r\nrestore the friendship and good will which prevailed in former days\r\namong the people of the several States, and, above all, to save us from\r\nthe horrors of civil war and \"blood guiltiness.\" Let our fervent prayers\r\nascend to His throne that He would not desert us in this hour of extreme\r\nperil, but remember us as He did our fathers in the darkest days of the\r\nRevolution, and preserve our Constitution and our Union, the work of\r\ntheir hands, for ages yet to come.\r\n\r\nAn omnipotent Providence may overrule existing evils for permanent good.\r\nHe can make the wrath of man to praise Him, and the remainder of wrath\r\nHe can restrain. Let me invoke every individual, in whatever sphere of\r\nlife he may be placed, to feel a personal responsibility to God and his\r\ncountry for keeping this day holy and for contributing all in his power\r\nto remove our actual and impending calamities.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS.\r\n\r\n[From Sparks's Washington, Vol. X, pp. 11-12.]\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _June 8, 1789_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[177] Although in the present unsettled state of the Executive\r\nDepartments under the Government of the Union I do not conceive it\r\nexpedient to call upon you for information officially, yet I have\r\nsupposed that some informal communications from the Office of Foreign\r\nAffairs might neither be improper nor unprofitable. Finding myself at\r\nthis moment less occupied with the duties of my office than I shall\r\nprobably be at almost any time hereafter, I am desirous of employing\r\nmyself in obtaining an acquaintance with the real situation of the\r\nseveral great Departments at the period of my acceding to the\r\nadministration of the General Government. For this purpose I wish to\r\nreceive in writing such a clear account of the Department at the head of\r\nwhich you have been for some years past as may be sufficient (without\r\noverburthening or confusing the mind, which has very many objects to\r\nclaim its attention at the same instant) to impress me with a full,\r\nprecise, and distinct general idea of the affairs of the United States\r\nso far as they are comprehended in or connected with that Department.\r\n\r\nAs I am now at leisure to inspect such papers and documents as may be\r\nnecessary to be acted upon hereafter or as may be calculated to give me\r\nan insight into the business and duties of that Department, I have\r\nthought fit to address this notification to you accordingly.\r\n\r\nI am, etc.,\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: Addressed to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, the\r\nSecretary of War, the Board of the Treasury, and the Postmaster-General.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From American State Papers, Indian Affairs, Vol. I, pp. 96-97.]\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE GOVERNOR OF\r\nTHE WESTERN TERRITORY--6TH OCTOBER, 1789.\r\n\r\nARTHUR ST. CLAIR, Esq.,\r\n\r\n_Governor of the Territory of the United States Northwest of the Ohio\r\nand Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern District_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Congress having by their act of the 29th of September last\r\nempowered me to call forth the militia of the States, respectively, for\r\nthe protection of the frontiers from the incursions of the hostile\r\nIndians, I have thought proper to make this communication to you,\r\ntogether with the instructions herein contained.\r\n\r\nIt is highly necessary that I should as soon as possible possess full\r\ninformation whether the Wabash and Illinois Indians are most inclined\r\nfor war or peace. If for the former, it is proper that I should be\r\ninformed of the means which will most probably induce them to peace.\r\nIf a peace can be established with the said Indians on reasonable terms,\r\nthe interests of the United States dictate that it should be effected as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\nYou will therefore inform the said Indians of the dispositions of the\r\nGeneral Government on this subject and of their reasonable desire that\r\nthere should be a cessation of hostilities as a prelude to a treaty. If,\r\nhowever, notwithstanding your intimations to them, they should continue\r\ntheir hostilities or meditate any incursions against the frontiers of\r\nVirginia and Pennsylvania or against any of the troops or posts of the\r\nUnited States, and it should appear to you that the time of execution\r\nwould be so near as to forbid your transmitting the information to me\r\nand receiving my further orders thereon, then you are hereby authorized\r\nand empowered in my name to call on the lieutenants of the nearest\r\ncounties of Virginia and Pennsylvania for such detachments of militia as\r\nyou may judge proper, not exceeding, however, 1,000 from Virginia and\r\n500 from Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nI have directed letters to be written to the executives of Virginia and\r\nPennsylvania informing them of the before-recited act of Congress and\r\nthat I have given you these conditional directions, so that there may\r\nnot be any obstructions to such measures as shall be necessary to be\r\ntaken by you for calling forth the militia agreeably to the instructions\r\nherein contained.\r\n\r\nThe said militia to act in conjunction with the Federal troops in such\r\noperations, offensive or defensive, as you and the commanding officer of\r\nthe troops conjointly shall judge necessary for the public service and\r\nthe protection of the inhabitants and the posts.\r\n\r\nThe said militia while in actual service to be on the continental\r\nestablishment of pay and rations. They are to arm and equip themselves,\r\nbut to be furnished with public ammunition if necessary; and no charge\r\nfor the pay of said militia will be valid unless supported by regular\r\nmusters, made by a field or other officer of the Federal troops, to be\r\nappointed by the commanding officer of the troops.\r\n\r\nI would have it observed forcibly that a war with the Wabash Indians\r\nought to be avoided by all means consistently with the security of the\r\nfrontier inhabitants, the security of the troops, and the national\r\ndignity. In the exercise of the present indiscriminate hostilities it\r\nis extremely difficult, if not impossible, to say that a war without\r\nfurther measures would be just on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut if, after manifesting clearly to the Indians the dispositions of\r\nthe General Government for the preservation of peace and the extension\r\nof a just protection to the said Indians, they should continue their\r\nincursions, the United States will be constrained to punish them with\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\nYou will also proceed, as soon as you can with safety, to execute the\r\norders of the late Congress respecting the inhabitants at St. Vincennes\r\nand at the Kaskaskias and the other villages on the Mississippi. It is a\r\ncircumstance of some importance that the said inhabitants should as soon\r\nas possible possess the lands to which they are entitled by some known\r\nand fixed principles.\r\n\r\nI have directed a number of copies of the treaty made by you at Fort\r\nHarmar with the Wyandots, etc., on the 9th of January last to be printed\r\nand forwarded to you, together with the ratification and my proclamation\r\nenjoining the observance thereof.\r\n\r\nAs it may be of high importance to obtain a precise and accurate\r\nknowledge of the several waters which empty into the Ohio on the\r\nnorthwest and of those which discharge themselves in the Lakes Erie and\r\nMichigan, the length of the portages between, and nature of the ground,\r\nan early and pointed attention thereto is earnestly recommended.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, in the city of New York, this 6th day of October,\r\nA.D. 1789, and in the thirteenth year of the Sovereignty and\r\nIndependence of the United States.\r\n\r\nGo.

This being the case (although the\r\nallusion was to the subject he was then speaking upon), some of these\r\nmen may be employed in the equipment of privateers other than those\r\n_now_ in existence, as the right of fitting out such _in our\r\nports_ is asserted in unequivocal terms.\r\n\r\nWas the propriety of convening the Legislature at an earlier day than\r\nthat on which it is to assemble by law considered yesterday?\r\n\r\nThe late decree of the National Convention of France, dated the 9th of\r\nMay, authorizing their ships of war and armed vessels to stop any\r\nneutral vessel loaded in whole or part with provisions and send them\r\ninto their ports, adds another motive for the adoption of this measure.\r\n\r\nGo.

In exercising the powers granted by the act of Congress entitled\r\n\"An act further to protect the commerce of the United States,\" passed\r\nthe 9th day of July, 1798, and which is hereto annexed, the regulations\r\ntherein prescribed are to be strictly attended to and observed.\r\n\r\nSecond. The powers of capturing and recapturing granted by the said act\r\nbeing pointed solely and exclusively against French armed vessels and\r\nthose vessels, goods, and effects of citizens of the United States or of\r\npersons resident therein which shall have been captured by the French,\r\nthe rights of all other nations are to be duly respected, and they are\r\nnot to be molested in their persons or property; consequently American\r\nvessels and property captured by the commissioned vessels of such of\r\nthose other nations as are at war are not to be recaptured by the armed\r\nvessels of the United States. Nevertheless, any vessels found on the\r\nhigh seas may be examined in such manner as shall be necessary to\r\nascertain whether they are or are not armed French vessels, or \"vessels\r\nthe property of or employed by any citizen of the United States or\r\nperson resident therein, or having on board any goods or effects\r\nbelonging to any such citizen or resident,\" that have been captured by\r\nthe French. But if they are of neither of these descriptions they are\r\nto be dismissed with as little delay as possible. And in making such\r\nexamination care is to be taken that no injury be done to the vessel or\r\nto the persons or property on board her. It peculiarly becomes a nation\r\nlike the American, contending for her just rights and defending herself\r\nagainst insults and injuries, to respect the rights of others and\r\nstudiously to avoid not only the outrage and the inhumanity but even the\r\nincivility of which itself complains. It is hoped that Americans will be\r\nas distinguished for their justice and humanity as for their bravery and\r\nlove of true liberty. If, on the contrary, any of the officers or crews\r\nof American armed vessels shall practice any cruelty or inhumanity\r\ncontrary to the usage of civilized nations, the offenders will be\r\nseverely punished.\r\n\r\nThird. For the purposes of the act aforesaid you will consider the \"high\r\nseas\" to extend to low-water mark on all the coasts of France and her\r\ndominions and of all places subject to her power in any part of the\r\nworld, and exercise accordingly the powers of capturing and recapturing\r\ngranted by the act aforesaid. By the same rule, seeing a war exists\r\nbetween Great Britain and France, you may capture and recapture as\r\naforesaid on all the coasts of the British dominions and of all places\r\nsubject to the British power. But you are to refrain from exercising the\r\naforesaid powers of capturing and recapturing in waters which are under\r\nthe protection of any other nations, that their peace and sovereignty\r\nmay remain unviolated. If, however, any armed French vessel, regardless\r\nof the rights of these other nations, shall within their jurisdictional\r\nlimits attack or capture any vessel, goods, or effects the property of\r\ncitizens of or residents in the United States, and you are able to\r\nattack and take such armed French vessel or to retake her prize within\r\nthe jurisdictional limits of such nations, you are to do it, provided\r\ntheir governments, respectively, or the commanders or governors in chief\r\nin such places give their permission.\r\n\r\nFourth. The master or pilot and one or more of the principal persons of\r\nthe company of every armed French vessel captured as aforesaid are to be\r\nsent as soon after the capture as may be to the judge or judges of the\r\nproper court in the United States to be examined upon oath touching the\r\ninterest or property of the captured vessel and her lading, and at the\r\nsame time are to be delivered to the judge or judges all passes, charter\r\nparties, bills of lading, invoices, letters, and other documents and\r\nwritings found on board; the said papers to be proved by the affidavit\r\nof the commander of the capturing vessel or some other person present\r\nat the capture, to be produced as they were received, without fraud,\r\naddition, subduction, or embezzlement.\r\n\r\nFifth. The commanders of American private armed ships are by all\r\nconvenient opportunities to send to the Secretary of the Navy written\r\naccounts of the captures they shall make, with the number and names\r\nof the captives and intelligence of what may occur or be discovered\r\nconcerning the designs of the French and the destinations, motions,\r\nand operations of their fleets, cruisers, and armies.\r\n\r\nSixth. Where it can be done without injury or great inconvenience, the\r\narmed French vessels captured as aforesaid are to be sent to some port\r\nin the United States to be tried according to law. But such captures may\r\nhappen in places remote from the United States or under circumstances\r\nwhich would render the sending of the captured vessels thither extremely\r\ninconvenient, while, from the vicinity of the ports of the British\r\ndominions or those of any other power in friendship with the United\r\nStates, but at war with France, or from other circumstances, it would be\r\neasy to send such captured vessels into those friendly ports. In such\r\ncases it will be lawful to send such prizes into those friendly ports\r\nwhere they will find an asylum; and if the laws of those countries admit\r\nof it and it can be done to the satisfaction of the captors, there will\r\nbe no objection on the part of the American Government to the libeling\r\nand trying such captured armed French vessels by the proper courts of\r\nthose, countries, where also may be delivered to the proper officers\r\nall French persons and others who shall be found acting on board of any\r\nFrench armed vessel which shall be captured or on board of any vessel\r\nof the United States which shall be recaptured as aforesaid.\r\n\r\nSeventh. With respect to American vessels, goods, and effects\r\nrecaptured, it seems not necessary to bring them immediately into a port\r\nof the United States. If brought in, they are to be restored to the\r\nowners on the payment of salvage. But such recaptured vessels, goods,\r\nand effects may at the time of recapture be so remote from the United\r\nStates and so near a market, or the goods and effects may be of a nature\r\nso perishable, that to send such vessels, goods, and effects back to the\r\nUnited States may prove extremely injurious to the owners and recaptors,\r\nwhereas, if permitted to proceed to their destined ports, or other\r\nplaces, to a market, greater advantages may result to all concerned\r\ntherein; and as either the master, mate, or supercargo of any such\r\nrecaptured vessel is usually left on board, and with the aid of the\r\nprizemaster and hands of the recaptors, which would be necessary to\r\nbring her home, might proceed and complete their original or other\r\nbeneficial voyage, the commanders of the private armed vessels will in\r\nsuch case consider maturely the course most proper to be pursued, as\r\nwell for the benefit of their fellow-citizens whose property they shall\r\nthus recapture as of themselves in respect to the salvage to which they\r\nand their crews and owners will be entitled. Nothing on this subject is\r\nenjoined; the commanders of the private armed vessels are to use their\r\nsound discretion.\r\n\r\nEighth. If any vessel of the United States, public or private, shall be\r\nfound in distress by being attacked or taken by the French, the commanders,\r\nofficers, and company of the private armed vessels aforesaid are\r\nto use their utmost endeavors to aid, succor, relieve, and free every such\r\nvessel in distress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACT further to protect the commerce of the United States.\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. _Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\nof the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That the\r\nPresident of the United States shall be, and he is hereby, authorized\r\nto instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels which are or\r\nwhich shall be employed in the service of the United States to subdue,\r\nseize, and take any armed French vessel which shall be found within\r\nthe jurisdictional limits of the United States or elsewhere on\r\nthe high seas; and such captured vessel, with her apparel, guns, and\r\nappurtenances and the goods or effects which shall be found on board\r\nthe same, being French property, shall be brought within some port of\r\nthe United States and shall be duly proceeded against and condemned as\r\nforfeited, and shall accrue and be distributed as by law is or shall be\r\nprovided respecting the captures which shall be made by the public armed\r\nvessels of the United States.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That the President of the\r\nUnited States shall be, and he is hereby, authorized to grant to the\r\nowners of private armed ships and vessels of the United States who shall\r\nmake application therefor special commissions in the form which he shall\r\ndirect and under the seal of the United States;

And such salvage shall be distributed to and among the\r\nowners, officers, and crews of the private armed vessel or vessels\r\nentitled thereto according to any agreement which shall be between them,\r\nor, in case of no agreement, then by the decree of the court who shall\r\ndetermine upon such salvage.\r\n\r\nSEC. 7. _And be it further enacted_, That before breaking bulk of\r\nany vessel which shall be captured as aforesaid, or other disposal or\r\nconversion thereof, or of any articles which shall be found on board the\r\nsame, such capture shall be brought into some port of the United States\r\nand shall be libeled and proceeded against before the district court of\r\nthe same district; and if, after a due course of proceeding, such\r\ncapture shall be decreed as forfeited in the district court, or in the\r\ncircuit court of the same district in the case of any appeal duly\r\nallowed, the same shall be delivered to the owners and captors concerned\r\ntherein, or shall be publicly sold by the marshal of the same court, as\r\nshall be finally decreed and ordered by the court; and the same court,\r\nwho shall have final jurisdiction of any libel or complaint of any\r\ncapture as aforesaid, shall and may decree restitution, in whole or in\r\npart, when the capture and restraint shall have been made without just\r\ncause as aforesaid, and if made without probable cause or otherwise\r\nunreasonably may order and decree damages and costs to the party\r\ninjured, and for which the owners, officers, and crews of the private\r\narmed vessel or vessels by which such unjust capture shall have been\r\nmade, and also such vessel or vessels, shall be answerable and liable.\r\n\r\nSEC. 8. _And be it further enacted_, That all French persons and\r\nothers who shall be found acting on board any French armed vessel which\r\nshall be captured, or on board of any vessel of the United States which\r\nshall be recaptured as aforesaid, shall be reported to the collector of\r\nthe port in which they shall first arrive, and shall be delivered to the\r\ncustody of the marshal or of some civil or military officer of the\r\nUnited States or of any State in or near such port, who shall take\r\ncharge for their safe-keeping and support, at the expense of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nEnacted into a law July 9, 1798.\r\n\r\nBy command of the President of the United States of America:\r\n\r\n---- ----,\r\n  _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Seventh Congress, second session, 747.]\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS TO COMMANDERS OF ARMED VESSELS BELONGING TO THE UNITED\r\nSTATES, GIVEN AT PHILADELPHIA THE 10TH DAY OF JULY, A.D. 1798, AND IN\r\nTHE TWENTY-THIRD YEAR OF OUR INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the acts of Congress passed the 27th day of May, the\r\n20th day of June, and the 9th day of July--\r\n\r\nYou are hereby authorized, instructed, and directed to subdue, seize,\r\nand take any armed French vessel or vessels sailing under authority or\r\npretense of authority from the French Republic which shall be found\r\nwithin the jurisdictional limits of the United States or elsewhere on\r\nthe high seas, and such captured vessel, with her apparel, guns, and\r\nappurtenances and the goods and effects which shall be found on board of\r\nthe same, to bring within some port of the United States; and also\r\nretake any vessel, goods, and effects of the United States or persons\r\nresident therein which may have been captured by any French vessel, in\r\norder that proceedings may be had concerning such capture or recapture\r\nin due form of law and as to right shall appertain.\r\n\r\nBy command of the President of the United States of America:\r\n\r\nBEN.

Adams's Works of John Adams, Vol. IX, p. 160.]\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR TO THE COMMANDERS OF ARMED VESSELS IN THE SERVICE OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES, GIVEN AT THE NAVY DEPARTMENT DECEMBER 29, 1798.\r\n\r\nSIR: It is the positive command of the President that on no pretense\r\nwhatever you permit the public vessel of war under your command to be\r\ndetained or searched nor any of the officers or men belonging to her to\r\nbe taken from her by the ships or vessels of any foreign nation so long\r\nas you are in a capacity to repel such outrage on the honor of the\r\nAmerican flag. If force should be exerted to compel your submission,\r\nyou are to resist that force to the utmost of your power, and when\r\noverpowered by superior force you are to strike your flag and thus yield\r\nyour vessel as well as your men, but never your men without your vessel.\r\n\r\nYou will remember, however, that your demeanor be respectful and\r\nfriendly to the vessels and people of all nations in amity with the\r\nUnited States, and that you avoid as carefully the commission of as the\r\nsubmission to insult or injury.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\nBEN STODDERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Seventh Congress, second session, 747-748.]\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CAPTAINS AND COMMANDERS OF VESSELS IN THE\r\nSERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _March 12, 1799._\r\n\r\nSIR: Herewith you will receive an act of Congress \"further to suspend\r\nthe commercial intercourse between the United States and France and the\r\ndependencies thereof,\" the whole of which requires your attention; but\r\nit is the command of the President that you consider particularly the\r\nfifth section as part of your instructions and govern yourself\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nA proper discharge of the important duties arising out of this act will\r\nrequire the exercise of a sound and an impartial judgment. You are not\r\nonly to do all that in you lies to prevent all intercourse, whether\r\ndirect or circuitous, between the ports of the United States and those\r\nof France or her dependencies in cases where the vessels or cargoes are\r\napparently, as well as really, American and protected by American papers\r\nonly, but you are to be vigilant that vessels or cargoes really\r\nAmerican, but covered by Danish or other foreign papers and bound to or\r\nfrom French ports, do not escape you. Whenever, on just suspicion, you\r\nsend a vessel into port to be dealt with according to the aforementioned\r\nlaw, besides sending with her all her papers send all the evidence you\r\ncan obtain to support your suspicions and effect her condemnation. At\r\nthe same time that you are thus attentive to fulfill the objects of the\r\nlaw you are to be extremely careful not to harass or injure the trade of\r\nforeign nations with whom we are at peace nor the fair trade of our own\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nA misconstruction of his authority by Captain Nicholson in relation to\r\nvessels of friendly nations captured by the French renders it necessary\r\nthat I should make some explanatory observations on that subject. Our\r\nlaws direct the capture of all armed vessels sailing under authority or\r\npretense of authority from the French Republic. A vessel captured by the\r\ncitizens of France must be considered as sailing under the authority\r\nof France, and it is scarcely to be supposed that in times like the\r\npresent, when few vessels sail without arms, a captured vessel in\r\npossession of the captors will be so circumstanced as not to come under\r\nthe description of an armed vessel within the meaning of our laws. To\r\njustify a recapture nothing is necessary but that the vessel be provided\r\nwith such means of annoyance as will render her dangerous to an unarmed\r\nAmerican vessel in pursuit of lawful commerce. If, however, the vessel\r\ncan not be considered an armed vessel within the meaning of our laws,\r\nyou are not to recapture her unless you should have probable cause to\r\nsuspect that the citizens of the United States or persons resident\r\ntherein have some interest in the vessel or cargo.\r\n\r\nIt is always your duty to recapture American property and property of\r\npersons resident within the United States whenever found in possession\r\nof the French on the high seas.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nBEN.

The voice of praise would in vain endeavor to exalt a character\r\nunrivaled on the lists of true glory. Words would in vain attempt to\r\ngive utterance to that profound and reverential grief which will\r\npenetrate every American bosom and engage the sympathy of an admiring\r\nworld. If the sad privilege of preeminence in sorrow may justly be\r\nclaimed by the companions in arms of our lamented Chief, their\r\naffections will spontaneously perform the dear though painful duty.\r\n'Tis only for me to mingle my tears with those of my fellow-soldiers,\r\ncherishing with them the precious recollection that while others are\r\npaying a merited tribute to \"The Man of the Age\" we in particular,\r\nallied as we were to him by a closer tie, are called to mourn the\r\nirreparable loss of a kind and venerated patron and father!\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the directions of the President, the following funeral\r\nhonors will be paid at the several stations of the Army:\r\n\r\nAt daybreak sixteen guns will be fired in quick succession and one gun\r\nat a distance of each half hour till sunset.\r\n\r\nDuring the procession of the troops to the place representing that of\r\nthe interment and until the conclusion of the ceremonial minute guns\r\nwill be fired.\r\n\r\nThe bier will be received by the troops formed in line presenting their\r\narms and the officers, drums, and colors saluting. After this the\r\nprocession will begin, the troops marching by platoons in inverted order\r\nand with arms reversed to the place of interment, the drums muffled and\r\nthe music playing a dead march.\r\n\r\nThe bier, carried by four sergeants and attended by six pallbearers,\r\nwhere there is cavalry will be preceded by the cavalry and will be\r\nfollowed by the troops on foot. Where there is no cavalry, a detachment\r\nof infantry will precede the bier, which itself will in every case be\r\npreceded by such of the clergy as may be present. The officers of the\r\ngeneral staff will immediately succeed the bier.\r\n\r\nWhere a numerous body of citizens shall be united with the military in\r\nthe procession, the whole of the troops will precede the bier, which\r\nwill then be followed by the citizens.\r\n\r\nWhen arrived near the place of interment, the procession will halt, the\r\ntroops in front of the bier will form in line, and, opening their ranks,\r\nwill face inwards, to admit the passage of the bier, which will then\r\npass through the ranks, the troops leaning on their arms, reversed,\r\nwhile the bier passes. When the bier shall have passed, the troops will\r\nresume their position in line, and, reversing their arms, will remain\r\nleaning upon them until the ceremonial shall be closed.\r\n\r\nThe music will now perform a solemn air, after which the introductory\r\npart of this order shall be read.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this a detachment of infantry, appointed for the purpose,\r\nwill advance and fire three volleys over the bier.\r\n\r\nThe troops will then return, the music playing the President's march,\r\nthe drums previously unmuffled.\r\n\r\nThe uniform companies of militia are invited to join in arms the\r\nvolunteer corps.\r\n\r\nThe commanders at particular stations, conforming generally to this\r\nplan, will make such exceptions as will accommodate it to situation. At\r\nplaces where processions of unarmed citizens shall take place it is the\r\nwish of the Major-General that the military ceremonial should be united,\r\nand the particular commanders at those places are authorized to vary the\r\nplan so as to adapt it to the circumstances.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General MacPherson is charged to superintend the ceremonial in\r\nthe city of Philadelphia; Major Tousard will attend to Fort Mifflin and\r\nwill cooperate with him.\r\n\r\nThe day of performing the ceremonial at each station is left to the\r\nparticular commander.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Pinckney will make such further arrangements within his\r\ndistrict as he shall deem expedient.\r\n\r\nPHILIP CHURCH,\r\n  _Aid-de-Camp._\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the above the volunteers of the city and county of\r\nPhiladelphia in the service of the United States will parade, completely\r\nequipped, at the manege, in Chesnut street, on Thursday next, the 26th\r\ninstant, at 10 o'clock a.m. The officers, together with the uniform\r\ncompanies of militia who may think proper to join on this mournful\r\noccasion, will please to signify their intention to Brigadier-General\r\nMacPherson at his quarters on or before Tuesday next at 1 o'clock p.m.,\r\nin order that the necessary arrangement may be made to pay the last sad\r\ntribute of veneration to the manes of the late Commander in Chief of the\r\nArmies of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy order of Brigadier-General MacPherson:\r\n\r\nJONATHAN WILLIAMS,\r\n  _Aid-de-Camp._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following interesting paper is extracted from a speech of Senator\r\nW.C.

(See Congressional Globe, Twenty-fifth Congress,\r\nthird session, Vol. VII, Appendix, p. 409.) This order President\r\nJefferson caused to be issued by the heads of the several Departments\r\nshortly after his inauguration, March 4, 1801. References are made to\r\nit in several publications, but the originals could not be found.]\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States has seen with dissatisfaction\r\nofficers of the General Government taking on various occasions active\r\nparts in elections of the public functionaries, whether of the General\r\nor of the State Governments. Freedom of elections being essential to the\r\nmutual independence of governments and of the different branches of the\r\nsame government, so vitally cherished by most of our constitutions, it\r\nis deemed improper for officers depending on the Executive of the Union\r\nto attempt to control or influence the free exercise of the elective\r\nright. This I am instructed, therefore, to notify to all officers within\r\nmy Department holding their appointments under the authority of the\r\nPresident directly, and to desire them to notify to all subordinate\r\nto them. The right of any officer to give his vote at elections as a\r\nqualified citizen is not meant to be restrained, nor, however given,\r\nshall it have any effect to his prejudice; but it is expected that he\r\nwill not attempt to influence the votes of others nor take any part in\r\nthe business of electioneering, that being deemed inconsistent with the\r\nspirit of the Constitution and his duties to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Writings of Thomas Jefferson, Paul Leicester Ford, Vol. VIII,\r\npp. 99-101.]\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR TO THE HEADS OF THE DEPARTMENTS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _November 6, 1801._\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: Coming all of us into executive office new and unfamiliar\r\nwith the course of business previously practiced, it was not to be\r\nexpected we should in the first outset adopt in every part a line of\r\nproceeding so perfect as to admit no amendment. The mode and degrees\r\nof communication, particularly between the Presidents and heads of\r\nDepartments, have not been practiced exactly on the same scale in all of\r\nthem. Yet it would certainly be more safe and satisfactory for ourselves\r\nas well as the public that not only the best but also an uniform course\r\nof proceeding as to manner and degree should be observed. Having been\r\na member of the first Administration under General Washington, I can\r\nstate with exactness what our course then was. Letters of business came\r\naddressed sometimes to the President, but most frequently to the heads\r\nof Departments. If addressed to himself, he referred them to the proper\r\nDepartment to be acted on. If to one of the Secretaries, the letter, if\r\nit required no answer, was communicated to the President simply for his\r\ninformation. If an answer was requisite, the Secretary of the Department\r\ncommunicated the letter and his proposed answer to the President.\r\nGenerally they were simply sent back after perusal, which signified\r\nhis approbation. Sometimes he returned them with an informal note,\r\nsuggesting an alteration or a query. If a doubt of any importance arose,\r\nhe reserved it for conference. By this means he was always in accurate\r\npossession of all facts and proceedings in every part of the Union, and\r\nto whatsoever Department they related; he formed a central point for the\r\ndifferent branches; preserved an unity of object and action among them;\r\nexercised that participation in the suggestion of affairs which his\r\noffice made incumbent on him, and met himself the due responsibility\r\nfor whatever was done. During Mr. Adams's Administration his long and\r\nhabitual absences from the seat of Government rendered this kind of\r\ncommunication impracticable, removed him from any share in the\r\ntransaction of affairs, and parceled out the Government, in fact, among\r\nfour independent heads, drawing sometimes in opposite directions.\r\nThat the former is preferable to the latter course can not be doubted.\r\nIt gave, indeed, to the heads of Departments the trouble of making up\r\nonce a day a packet of all their communications for the perusal of the\r\nPresident; it commonly also retarded one day their dispatches by mail;\r\nbut in pressing cases this injury was prevented by presenting that\r\ncase singly for immediate attention, and it produced us in return the\r\nbenefit of his sanction for every act we did. Whether any change of\r\ncircumstances may render a change in this procedure necessary a little\r\nexperience will show us. But I can not withhold recommending to heads of\r\nDepartments that we should adopt this course for the present, leaving\r\nany necessary modifications of it to time and trial. I am sure my\r\nconduct must have proved better than a thousand declarations would that\r\nmy confidence in those whom I am so happy as to have associated with\r\nme is unlimited, unqualified, and unabated. I am well satisfied that\r\neverything goes on with a wisdom and rectitude which I could not\r\nimprove. If I had the universe to choose from, I could not change one\r\nof my associates to my better satisfaction. My sole motives are those\r\nbefore expressed, as governing the first Administration in chalking out\r\nthe rules of their proceeding, adding to them only a sense of obligation\r\nimposed on me by the public will to meet personally the duties to which\r\nthey have appointed me. If this mode of proceeding shall meet the\r\napprobation of the heads of Departments, it may go into execution\r\nwithout giving them the trouble of an answer. If any other can be\r\nsuggested which would answer our views and add less to their labors,\r\nthat will be a sufficient reason for my preferring it to my own\r\nproposition, to the substance of which only, and not the form, I attach\r\nany importance.\r\n\r\nTH: JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Tenth Congress, second session, 332-333.]\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the act entitled \"An act making provision for defraying any\r\nextraordinary expenses attending the intercourse between the United\r\nStates and foreign nations,\" passed on the 13th day of February, 1806,\r\nand of which the annexed is an official exemplification, I, Thomas\r\nJefferson, President of the United States of America, do hereby\r\nauthorize and empower Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States, to take all proper and necessary measures for placing the\r\n$2,000,000 appropriated by the act above recited at the joint disposal\r\nof John Armstrong and James Bowdoin, commissioners plenipotentiary and\r\nextraordinary for settling all matters of difference between the United\r\nStates and the Government of Spain, and, in case of the death of one of\r\nthem, at the disposal of the survivor, to be jointly applied by the said\r\nJohn Armstrong and James Bowdoin, or, in case of the death of one of\r\nthem, by the survivor, to such purposes as I may think proper to direct\r\nin my instructions to them; and for so doing this shall be his\r\nsufficient warrant.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 18th day of March,\r\n1806.\r\n\r\nTH: JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES MADISON,\r\n    _Secretary of State._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Writings of Thomas Jefferson, Paul Leicester Ford, Vol. IX,\r\npp. 34-35.]\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR LETTER TO THE GOVERNORS OF KENTUCKY, TENNESSEE, OHIO, AND\r\nMISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 21, 1807._\r\n\r\nSIR: Although the present state of things on the western side of the\r\nMississippi does not threaten any immediate collision with our neighbors\r\nin that quarter and it is our wish they should remain undisturbed until\r\nan amicable adjustment may take place, yet as this does not depend on\r\nourselves alone it has been thought prudent to be prepared to meet any\r\nmovements which may occur. The law of a former session of Congress for\r\nkeeping a body of 100,000 militia in readiness for service at a moment's\r\nwarning is still in force, but by an act of the last session, a copy of\r\nwhich I now inclose, the Executive is authorized to accept the services\r\nof such volunteers as shall offer themselves on the conditions of the\r\nact, which may render a resort to the former act unnecessary. It is\r\nfor the execution of this act that I am now to solicit your zealous\r\nendeavors. The persons who shall engage will not be called from their\r\nhomes until some aggression, committed or intended, shall render it\r\nnecessary. When called into action it will not be for a lounging but\r\nfor an active and perhaps distant service. I know the effect of this\r\nconsideration in kindling that ardor which prevails for this service,\r\nand I count on it for filling up the numbers requisite without delay.\r\nTo yourself I am sure it must be as desirable as it is to me to transfer\r\nthis service from the great mass of our militia to that portion of them\r\nto whose habits and enterprise active and distant service is most\r\ncongenial. In using, therefore, your best exertions toward accomplishing\r\nthe object of this act you will render to your constituents as well as\r\nto the nation a most acceptable service.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the organizing and officering those who shall be engaged\r\nwithin your State the act itself will be your guide, and as it is\r\ndesirable that we should be kept informed of the progress in this\r\nbusiness I must pray you to report the same from time to time to the\r\nSecretary of War, who will correspond with you on all the details\r\narising out of it.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great consideration and respect.\r\n\r\nTH: JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From American State Papers, Finance, Vol. II, p. 449.]\r\n\r\n_James Madison, President of the United States of America, to Albert\r\nGallatin, Secretary of the Treasury_:\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the act entitled \"An act authorizing a loan of money\r\nfor a sum not exceeding the amount of the principal of the public debt\r\nreimbursable during the year 1810,\" passed on the 1st day of May, 1810,\r\nI do hereby authorize and empower you, by yourself or any other person\r\nor persons, to borrow on behalf of the United States, of the Bank of the\r\nUnited States, any sum not exceeding in the whole $3,750,000, and to\r\nmake or cause to be made for that purpose such contract as shall be\r\nnecessary and for the interest of the said States, pursuant to the act\r\naforesaid; and for so doing this shall be your warrant.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at Washington, this 28th day of May, A.D. 1810.\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Thirteenth Congress, Vol. II, 2544-2545.]\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _July 29, 1813_.\r\n\r\n_Commanding Officers of Stations or Vessels of United States Navy_:\r\n\r\nThe palpable and criminal intercourse held with the enemy's forces\r\nblockading and invading the waters and shores of the United States is,\r\nin a military view, an offense of so deep a dye as to call for the\r\nvigilant interposition of all the naval officers of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis intercourse is not only carried on by foreigners, under the\r\nspecious garb of friendly flags, who convey provisions, water, and\r\nsuccors of all kinds (ostensibly destined for friendly ports, in the\r\nface, too, of a declared and rigorous blockade) direct to the fleets\r\nand stations of the enemy, with constant intelligence of our naval\r\nand military force and preparation and the means of continuing and\r\nconducting the invasion, to the greatest possible annoyance of the\r\ncountry, but the same traffic, intercourse, and intelligence is carried\r\non with great subtility and treachery by profligate citizens, who, in\r\nvessels ostensibly navigating our own waters from port to port, under\r\ncover of night or other circumstances favoring their turpitude, find\r\nmeans to convey succors or intelligence to the enemy and elude the\r\npenalty of the law. This lawless traffic and intercourse is also carried\r\non to a great extent in craft whose capacity exempts them from the\r\nregulations of the revenue laws and from the vigilance which vessels\r\nof greater capacity attract.\r\n\r\nI am therefore commanded by the President of the United States to enjoin\r\nand direct all naval commanding officers to exercise the strictest\r\nvigilance and to stop and detain all vessels or craft whatsoever\r\nproceeding or apparently intending to proceed toward the enemy's vessels\r\nwithin the waters or hovering about the harbors of the United States, or\r\ntoward any station occupied by the enemy within the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States, from which vessels or craft the enemy might derive\r\nsuccors or intelligence.\r\n\r\nW. JONES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Congressional Globe, Vol. V, p. 323.]\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT, _February 22, 1836_.\r\n\r\n_To Receivers of Public Moneys, Collectors, Disbursing Officers, and\r\nthe Deposit Banks of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe established policy of the Treasury Department, so far as may be\r\npracticable under its present powers over the collection, keeping, and\r\ndisbursement of the public money, is to diminish the circulation of\r\nsmall bank notes and to substitute specie, and especially gold, for such\r\nnotes, with the view of rendering the currency of the country, through\r\nwhich its fiscal operations are performed, more safe, sound, and\r\nuniform. In pursuance of that policy, a circular was issued last April\r\nwhich prohibited after the 30th September, 1835, the receipt on account\r\nof the Government of any bank notes of a less denomination than $5, and\r\nwhich intimated that other steps to promote the desirable objects before\r\nnamed would in due time be taken.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in further pursuance of the same policy, you are hereby\r\nrequired after the 1st of May next not to pay the demands of any public\r\nofficer or creditor in any bank notes of a less denomination than $5,\r\nand, except when it may be otherwise prescribed by law, after the 4th of\r\nJuly next not to receive or pay on account of the Government any bank\r\nnotes of a less denomination than $10.\r\n\r\nAll the deposit banks are requested to supply themselves with such a\r\nquantity of American gold coin as to be able to pay, and when a public\r\nofficer or creditor prefers it, and his demand does not exceed $500, to\r\npay at least one-fifth of such demand in that coin. It is also requested\r\nthat the deposit banks will not after the 4th of July next issue any\r\nnotes of a less denomination than $5, and that after the 3d of March,\r\n1837, they will not, unless the subject be otherwise regulated by\r\nCongress, issue any notes of a less denomination than $10. It is\r\nbelieved that the amount of gold which by that time shall be coined at\r\nthe Mint will be sufficient to admit of the convenient substitution of\r\nit for small notes in a much greater extent than at present; and it is\r\ndeemed reasonable that while the deposit banks have the use, without\r\ninterest, of unusually large sums of the public money they should make\r\nsome further temporary sacrifices to obtain and circulate gold and in\r\nother respects to enlarge the specie basis of our circulating medium.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations and from the liberal spirit evinced by most\r\nof the public depositories in a late correspondence with them on this\r\nsubject, it is confidently expected that in this state of things they\r\nwill cheerfully comply with the above requests and with all others which\r\nhave been made by the Department with a view of improving the currency;\r\nnor will it, I trust, be considered unjust or impolitic, while the\r\ndeposit banks shall continue to enjoy great privileges from the\r\nTreasury, to regard a neglect or refusal by any of them to comply with\r\nthose requests as sufficient cause for discontinuing the employment of\r\nsuch banks as fiscal agents.\r\n\r\nAt a proper time it will be decided under what circumstances and at what\r\nperiods these restrictions on the agents and officers of the Treasury\r\nshall be extended to notes of any denomination under $20.\r\n\r\nThis communication is made with the sanction of the President of the\r\nUnited States, and it is hoped that till otherwise prescribed by\r\nCongress or by this Department these requirements and requests will be\r\nfaithfully complied with by all the fiscal agents of this Department and\r\nall the collecting and disbursing officers of the Government.\r\n\r\nLEVI WOODBURY,\r\n  _Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Senate Doc. No. 15, Twenty-fourth Congress, second session.]\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO RECEIVERS OF PUBLIC MONEY\r\nAND TO THE DEPOSIT BANKS.\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT, _July 11, 1836._\r\n\r\nIn consequence of complaints which have been made of frauds,\r\nspeculations, and monopolies in the purchase of the public lands, and\r\nthe aid which is said to be given to effect these objects by excessive\r\nbank credits and dangerous, if not partial, facilities through bank\r\ndrafts and bank deposits, and the general evil influence likely to\r\nresult to the public interests, and especially the safety of the great\r\namount of money in the Treasury, and the sound condition of the currency\r\nof the country from the further exchange of the national domain in this\r\nmanner, and chiefly for bank credits and paper money, the President of\r\nthe United States has given directions, and you are hereby instructed,\r\nafter the 15th day of August next, to receive in payment of the public\r\nlands nothing except what is directed by the existing laws, viz, gold\r\nand silver, and in the proper cases Virginia land scrip: _Provided_,\r\nThat till the 15th of December next the same indulgences heretofore\r\nextended as to the kind of money received may be continued for any\r\nquantity of land not exceeding 320 acres to each purchaser who is an\r\nactual settler or _bona fide_ resident in the State where the sales\r\nare made.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure the faithful execution of these instructions, all\r\nreceivers are strictly prohibited from accepting for land sold any\r\ndraft, certificate, or other evidence of money or deposit, though\r\nfor specie, unless signed by the Treasurer of the United States in\r\nconformity to the act of April 24, 1820; and each of those officers is\r\nrequired to annex to his monthly returns to this Department the amount\r\nof gold and of silver, respectively, as well as the bills, received\r\nunder the foregoing exception; and each deposit bank is required to\r\nannex to every certificate given upon a deposit of money the proportions\r\nof it actually paid in gold, in silver, and in bank notes. All former\r\ninstructions on these subjects, except as now modified, will be\r\nconsidered as remaining in full force.\r\n\r\nThe principal objects of the President in adopting this measure being\r\nto repress alleged frauds and to withhold any countenance or facilities\r\nin the power of the Government from the monopoly of the public lands in\r\nthe hands of speculators and capitalists, to the injury of the actual\r\nsettlers in the new States and of emigrants in search of new homes, as\r\nwell as to discourage the ruinous extension of bank issues and bank\r\ncredits by which those results are generally supposed to be promoted,\r\nyour utmost vigilance is required and relied on to carry this order\r\ninto complete execution.\r\n\r\nLEVI WOODBURY,\r\n  _Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From American State Papers, Military Affairs, Vol. VII, p. 554.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERMITAGE, _September 7, 1836._\r\n\r\nGeneral J.E. WOOL,\r\n  _East Tennessee_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of the 30th ultimo has just been handed to me by Mr.\r\nRogers, the express. Being in a state of preparation for setting out for\r\nWashington and surrounded by much company, I have but a moment to reply\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nIn relation to your observations respecting the apportionment of the\r\n10,000 volunteers, I need not say more here than that the requisition on\r\nthe governor of the State was a sufficient guide for the organization\r\nof the part allotted to Tennessee. This requisition was for 2,500 men,\r\nto be raised in two brigades, one in the East and the other in West\r\nTennessee, and there could be no authority to muster more into the\r\nservice. The remainder of the 10,000 had been required from other\r\nStates and Territories.\r\n\r\nI have turned to the letter of the Adjutant-General to which you have\r\ncalled my attention. You will find, I think, that it relates to the\r\nvolunteers called for agreeably to the requisition on the governor of\r\nTennessee for 2,500. I can not suppose that it was expected of you to\r\nreceive a greater number than this into the service.\r\n\r\nAs you have the treaty before you and the instructions of the Acting\r\nSecretary of War, I do not see that I can add anything more on this\r\nsubject at present. The treaty is to be religiously fulfilled. You may\r\nassure all concerned that no modification or alteration in it will be\r\nmade by me. Of this Mr. John Ross is fully advised. His friend, Mr.\r\nStandefer, who waited upon me at Washington and made the inquiry whether\r\nI would agree to a supplemental article admitting the Rosses and their\r\ndelegation in as chiefs, was informed that I would not. You will\r\ntherefore make known to the Cherokee people that no alteration in the\r\ntreaty will be made, but that all its terms and conditions will be\r\nfaithfully and fully executed. Should you find any evil-disposed white\r\nman in the nation exciting the Indians not to comply with the treaty,\r\nyou will forthwith order him or them out of the nation, and if they\r\nrefuse to go, the facts being thoroughly established, you will take the\r\nsteps necessary to put them out. Such characters must be considered in\r\nthe light of intruders, prohibited by the treaty from living within the\r\nlimits of the nation.\r\n\r\nYou will caution John Ross from calling any council of the Cherokee\r\npeople with the view of opposing or altering the treaty. He knows that\r\nthere will be no further negotiation on the subject; that the Cherokees\r\nare to emigrate in two years from the ratification of the treaty, and\r\nwill be obliged to go within that period; that the collisions between\r\nthem and the whites have been too long continued for the gratification\r\nof himself at the expense of the poor in the nation.\r\n\r\nI have had a letter from Governor Carroll. He will leave Pontotoc at as\r\nearly a moment as he can, and expects to meet Governor Lumpkin early in\r\nOctober next.\r\n\r\nWith these hasty remarks, I remain, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Congressional Globe, Vol. VII, Appendix, p. 245.]\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _Washington, December 7, 1837._\r\n\r\nSIR:[179] In the course of the contest which has commenced in a portion\r\nof the territory of Great Britain between portions of the population and\r\nthe Government some of our citizens may, from their connection with the\r\nsettlers and from their love of enterprise and desire of change, be\r\ninduced to forget their duty to their own Government and its obligations\r\nto foreign powers.

Assuming that you, upon the ground, could better judge of the\r\nnecessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing\r\nyour proclamation of August 30 I perceived no general objection to it.\r\nThe particular clause, however, in relation to the confiscation of\r\nproperty and the liberation of slaves appeared to me to be objectionable\r\nin its nonconformity to the act of Congress passed the 6th of last\r\nAugust upon the same subjects, and hence I wrote you expressing my wish\r\nthat that clause should be modified accordingly. Your answer, just\r\nreceived, expresses the preference on your part that I should make an\r\nopen order for the modification, which I very cheerfully do. It is\r\ntherefore ordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so\r\nmodified, held, and construed as to conform to and not to transcend the\r\nprovisions on the same subject contained in the act of Congress entitled\r\n\"An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,\"\r\napproved August 6, 1861, and that said act be published at length with\r\nthis order.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA.

Persons thus employed and\r\nescaping are received into the military protection of the United\r\nStates, and their arrest as fugitives from service or labor should be\r\nimmediately followed by the military arrest of the parties making the\r\nseizure.\r\n\r\nCopies of this communication will be sent to the mayor of the city of\r\nWashington and to the marshal of the District of Columbia, that any\r\ncollision between the civil and military authorities may be avoided.\r\n\r\nI am, General, your very obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H.

None but able-bodied persons shall be enlisted.\r\n\r\nSecond. The State and county in which the enlistments are made shall be\r\ncredited with the recruits enlisted.\r\n\r\nThird. All persons enlisted into the military service shall forever\r\nthereafter be free.\r\n\r\nFourth. Free persons, and slaves with the written consent of their\r\nowners, and slaves belonging to those who have been engaged in or given\r\naid and comfort to the rebellion may be now enlisted, the owners who\r\nhave not been engaged in or given aid to the rebellion being entitled to\r\nreceive compensation as hereafter provided.\r\n\r\nFifth.

Any citizen of said States who shall offer his or her slave for\r\nenlistment into the military service shall if such slave be accepted\r\nreceive from the recruiting officer a certificate thereof and become\r\nentitled to compensation for the service or labor of said slave, not\r\nexceeding the sum of $300, upon filing a valid deed of manumission and\r\nof release and making satisfactory proof of title; and the recruiting\r\nofficer shall furnish to any claimant a descriptive list of any person\r\nenlisted and claimed under oath to be his or her slave, and allow anyone\r\nclaiming under oath that his or her slave has been enlisted without his\r\nor her consent the privilege of inspecting the enlisted men for the\r\npurpose of identification.\r\n\r\nSeventh.

Circular No. 13, of July 28, 1865, from this Bureau, and all portions\r\nof circulars from this Bureau conflicting with the provisions of this\r\ncircular are hereby rescinded.\r\n\r\nII. This Bureau has charge of such \"tracts of land within the\r\ninsurrectionary States as shall have been abandoned or to which the\r\nUnited States shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale or\r\notherwise,\" and no such lands now in its possession shall be surrendered\r\nto any claimant except as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\nIII. Abandoned lands are defined in section 2 of the act of Congress\r\napproved July 2, 1864, as lands \"the lawful owner whereof shall be\r\nvoluntarily absent therefrom and engaged, either in arms or otherwise,\r\nin aiding or encouraging the rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nIV. Land will not be regarded as confiscated until it has been condemned\r\nand sold by decree of the United States court for the district in which\r\nthe property may be found, and the title thereto thus vested in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nV. Upon its appearing satisfactorily to any assistant commissioner that\r\nany property under his control is not abandoned as above defined and\r\nthat the United States has acquired no title to it by confiscation,\r\nsale, or otherwise, he will formally surrender it to the authorized\r\nclaimant or claimants, promptly reporting his action to the\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nVI. Assistant commissioners will prepare accurate descriptions of all\r\nconfiscated and abandoned lands under their control, keeping a record\r\nthereof themselves and forwarding monthly to the Commissioner copies of\r\nthese descriptions in the manner prescribed in Circular No. 10, of July\r\n11, 1865, from this Bureau.\r\n\r\nThey will set apart so much of said lands as is necessary for the\r\nimmediate use of loyal refugees and freedmen, being careful to select\r\nfor this purpose those lands which most clearly fall under the control\r\nof this Bureau, which selection must be submitted to the Commissioner\r\nfor his approval.\r\n\r\nThe specific division of lands so set apart into lots and the rental or\r\nsale thereof, according to section 4 of the law establishing the Bureau,\r\nwill be completed as soon as practicable and reported to the\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nVII. Abandoned lands held by this Bureau may be restored to owners\r\npardoned by the President by the assistant commissioners, to whom\r\napplications for such restoration should be forwarded, so far as\r\npracticable, through the superintendents of the districts in which the\r\nlands are situated.\r\n\r\nEach application must be accompanied by--\r\n\r\nFirst. Evidence of special pardon by the President or a copy of the oath\r\nof amnesty prescribed in the President's proclamation of May 29,\r\n1865,[180] when the applicant is not included in any of the classes\r\ntherein excepted from the benefits of said oath.\r\n\r\nSecond.

The amounts allowed are determined with a general reference to\r\nthe rates of wages of officers and crew. All of the ship's company\r\n(constituting the crew) are to be regarded and considered as American\r\nseamen; but inasmuch as the British Government has demanded and received\r\nfrom Spain certain indemnity and promises of further conditional\r\nindemnity for and on account of certain of the crew as being British\r\nsubjects, those of the crew or passengers who were British subjects, or\r\nwho have been claimed as such by the British Government, and for whom\r\nthe British Government demanded or received indemnity from Spain, are to\r\nbe excluded from the distribution to be made of the indemnity above\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nII. Distribution will be made on account of those who were executed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFor each one (being thirteen in number) of the ship's company rated or\r\nserving as fireman, mariner, cook, cabin boy, or otherwise than as one\r\nof the officers or petty officers hereafter mentioned, who was executed,\r\nand excluding those referred to above, and also to each passenger who\r\nwas executed, being at the time an American citizen, the sum of $2,500.\r\n\r\nFor each assistant engineer, second, third, fourth engineer or third\r\nmate, 40 per cent in addition to the above sum; that is to say, $3,500\r\neach.\r\n\r\nFor the first mate and first engineer, 80 per cent in addition to the\r\nsaid above-mentioned sum; that is to say, $4,500 each.\r\n\r\nFor the captain, 150 per cent in addition to the said above-mentioned\r\nsum; that is to say, $6,250.\r\n\r\nIII. The several amounts allowed as above are to be paid to the widow,\r\nchildren, parents, or brothers and sisters of the deceased, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) To the widow of the deceased.\r\n\r\n(2) If no widow, to the children of the deceased in equal shares.\r\n\r\nWhere such children shall be minors, the same shall be paid to a legally\r\nappointed guardian.\r\n\r\n(3) If no children, then to the father; if no father, to the mother.\r\n\r\n(4) If no father or mother, then to the brothers and sisters in equal\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n(5) If the deceased shall have left no widow, child, parent, brother, or\r\nsister, no amount is to be paid on his account.\r\n\r\nThere shall be allowed to each of the ship's company and to such of the\r\npassengers as were citizens of the United States who were detained and\r\nsuffered loss, to be paid on the conditions hereinafter provided, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTo each of the ship's crew who was under the age of 21 years at the time\r\nof the capture, or who was reported at the time as under that age, and\r\nto each passenger who was an American citizen, the sum of $250.\r\n\r\nTo each of the ship's crew who was over the age of 21 years, and who was\r\nrated as being a fireman, mariner, cook, cabin boy, or otherwise than as\r\none of the officers or petty officers hereafter mentioned, 40 per cent\r\nin addition to the above-allowed sum; that is to say, $350 each.\r\n\r\nTo any engineer, second or other assistant engineer, mate, purser,\r\nassistant purser, or surgeon, 86 per cent in addition to the\r\nabove-allowed sum; that is to say, $450 to each.\r\n\r\nIn case any of such persons so entitled to payment shall have died, such\r\namount shall be paid to the family of the deceased as provided in\r\nArticle III.\r\n\r\nIV. The proofs as to all the necessary facts in each case, including\r\nidentity, relationship, and citizenship, shall be made to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Department of State as a condition of payment, and a\r\nnaturalized citizen, where proof of citizenship is necessary, shall\r\nproduce his certificate of naturalization and furnish satisfactory\r\nproof, if required, as to residence and his right, to such certificate.\r\n\r\nV. Payments will be made to the parties entitled thereto through the\r\nDepartment of State, or in checks to their order, and will not be made\r\nto attorneys.\r\n\r\nVI. Prior to any payment being made the party entitled thereto shall\r\nsign and duly acknowledge before some competent officer a receipt and\r\nrelease, stating that the sum so paid is received in full satisfaction\r\nof any claim or reclamations of any sort which may exist or which might\r\nbe advanced against the Spanish Government by reason of the capture of\r\nthe _Virginius_ or the acts of the Spanish authorities connected\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nVII. Should any further order or direction be required, the same will\r\nhereafter be made as an addition hereto.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, at the city of\r\nWashington, this 21st day of July, A.D. 1875, and of the Independence of\r\nthe United States of America the one hundredth.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Letters and Messages of Rutherford B. Hayes, pp. 19-22.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 2, 1877_.\r\n\r\nThe Honorables CHARLES B. LAWRENCE, JOSEPH R. HAWLEY, JOHN M. HARLAN,\r\nJOHN C. BROWN, AND WAYNE MACVEAGH, _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I am instructed by the President to lay before you some\r\nobservations upon the occasion and objects which have led him to invite\r\nyou as members of the commission about to visit the State of Louisiana\r\nto undertake this public service.\r\n\r\nUpon assuming his office the President finds the situation of affairs in\r\nLouisiana such as to justly demand his prompt and solicitous attention,\r\nfor this situation presents as one of its features the apparent\r\nintervention of the military power of the United States in the domestic\r\ncontroversies which unhappily divide the opinions and disturb the\r\nharmony of the people of that State. This intervention, arising during\r\nthe term and by the authority of his predecessor, throws no present duty\r\nupon the President except to examine and determine the real extent and\r\nform and effect to which such intervention actually exists, and to\r\ndecide as to the time, manner, and conditions which should be observed\r\nin putting an end to it. It is in aid of his intelligent and prompt\r\ndischarge of this duty that the President has sought the service of this\r\ncommission to supply by means of its examination, conducted in the State\r\nof Louisiana, some information that may be pertinent to the\r\ncircumspection and security of any measure he may resolve upon.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the service desired of and intrusted\r\nto this commission does not include any examination into or report upon\r\nthe facts of the recent State election or of the canvass of the votes\r\ncast at such election. So far as attention to these subjects may be\r\nnecessary the President can not but feel that the reports of the\r\ncommittees of the two Houses of Congress and other public information at\r\nhand will dispense with and should preclude any original exploration by\r\nthe commission of that field of inquiry.\r\n\r\nBut it is most pertinent and important in coming to a decision upon the\r\nprecise question of Executive duty before him that the President should\r\nknow what are the real impediments to regular, legal, and peaceful\r\nprocedures under the laws and constitution of the State of Louisiana by\r\nwhich the anomalies in government there presented may be put in course\r\nof settlement without involving the element of military power as either\r\nan agent or a makeweight in such solution. The successful ascertainment\r\nof these impediments the President would confidently expect would\r\nindicate to the people of that State the wisdom and the mode of their\r\nremoval. The unusual circumstances which attended and followed the State\r\nelection and canvass, from its relation to the excited feelings and\r\ninterests of the Presidential election, may have retarded within the\r\nState of Louisiana the persuasive influences by which the great social\r\nand material interests common to the whole people of a State, and the\r\npride of the American character as a law-abiding nation, ameliorate\r\nthe disappointments and dissolve the resentments of close and zealous\r\npolitical contests. But the President both hopes and believes that the\r\ngreat body of the people of Louisiana are now prepared to treat the\r\nunsettled results of their State election with a calm and conciliatory\r\nspirit. If it be too much to expect a complete concurrence in a single\r\ngovernment for that State, at least the President may anticipate a\r\nsubmission to the peaceful resources of the laws and the constitution of\r\nthe State of all their discussions, at once relieving themselves from\r\nthe reproach and their fellow-citizens of the United States from the\r\nanxieties which must ever attend a prolonged dispute as to the title and\r\nthe administration of the government of one of the States of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe President therefore desires that you should devote your first and\r\nprincipal attention to a removal of the obstacles to an acknowledgment\r\nof one government for the purpose of an exercise of authority within\r\nthe State and a representation of the State in its relations to the\r\nGeneral Government under section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution\r\nof the United States, leaving, if necessary, to judicial or other\r\nconstitutional arbitrament within the State the question of ultimate\r\nright. If these obstacles should prove insuperable, from whatever\r\nreason, and the hope of a single government in all its departments\r\nbe disappointed, it should be your next endeavor to accomplish the\r\nrecognition of a single legislature as the depositary of the\r\nrepresentative will of the people of Louisiana. This great department of\r\ngovernment rescued from dispute, the rest of the problem could gradually\r\nbe worked out by the prevalent authority which the legislative power,\r\nwhen undisputed, is quite competent to exert in composing conflict in\r\nthe coordinate branches of the government.\r\n\r\nAn attentive consideration of the conditions under which the Federal\r\nConstitution and the acts of Congress provide or permit military\r\nintervention by the President in protection of a State against domestic\r\nviolence has satisfied the President that the use of this authority in\r\ndetermining or influencing disputed elections in a State is most\r\ncarefully to be avoided. Undoubtedly, as was held by the Supreme Court\r\nin the case of Luther _vs._ Borden, the appeal from a State may\r\ninvolve such an inquiry as to the lawfulness of the authority which\r\ninvokes the interference of the President in supposed pursuance of the\r\nConstitution; but it is equally true that neither the constitutional\r\nprovision nor the acts of Congress were framed with any such design.\r\nBoth obviously treated the case of domestic violence within a State as\r\nof outbreak against law and the authority of established government\r\nwhich the State was unable to suppress by its own strength. A case\r\nwherein every department of the State government has a disputed\r\nrepresentation, and a State therefore furnishes to the Federal\r\nGovernment no internal political recognition of authority upon which the\r\nFederal Executive can rely, will present a case of so much difficulty\r\nthat it is of pressing importance to all interests in Louisiana that\r\nit should be avoided. A single legislature would greatly relieve this\r\ndifficulty, for that department of the State government is named by the\r\nConstitution as the necessary applicant, when it can be convened, for\r\nmilitary intervention by the United States.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the disputing interests can concur in or be reduced to a\r\nsingle legislature for the State of Louisiana, it would be a great step\r\nin composing this unhappy strife.\r\n\r\nThe President leaves entirely to the commission the conciliatory\r\ninfluences which, in their judgment formed on the spot, may seem to\r\nconduce to the proposed end. His own determination that only public\r\nconsiderations should inspire and attend this effort to give the\r\nascendency in Louisiana to the things that belong to peace is evinced\r\nby his selection of commissioners who offer to the country in their\r\nown character every guaranty of the public motives and methods of the\r\ntransactions which they have undertaken. Your report of the result of\r\nthis endeavor will satisfy the President, he does not doubt, of the\r\nwisdom of his selection of and of his plenary trust in the commission.\r\n\r\nA second and less important subject of attention during your visit\r\nto New Orleans will be the collection of accurate and trustworthy\r\ninformation from the public officers and prominent citizens of all\r\npolitical connections as to the state of public feeling and opinion in\r\nthe community at large upon the general questions which affect the\r\npeaceful and safe exercise within the State of Louisiana of all legal\r\nand political rights and the protection of all legal and political\r\nprivileges conferred by the Constitution of the United States upon all\r\ncitizens. The maintenance and protection of these rights and privileges\r\nby all constitutional means and by every just, moral, and social\r\ninfluence are the settled purpose of the President in his administration\r\nof the Government. He will hope to learn from your investigations that\r\nthis purpose will be aided and not resisted by the substantial and\r\neffective public opinion of the great body of the people of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe President does not wish to impose any limit upon your stay in\r\nLouisiana that would tend to defeat the full objects of your visit. He\r\nis, however, extremely desirous to find it in his power at the earliest\r\nday compatible with a safe exercise of that authority to put an end to\r\neven the appearance of military intervention in the domestic affairs of\r\nLouisiana, and he awaits your return with a confident hope that your\r\nreport will enable him promptly to execute a purpose he has so much at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe President desires me to add that the publication of the results of\r\nyour visit he shall hope to make immediately after their communication\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWM.

McCRARY,\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Prior to my entering upon the duties of the Presidency there had\r\nbeen stationed, by order of my predecessor, in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the building used as a statehouse in New Orleans, La., and known as\r\nMechanics' Institute, a detachment of United States infantry. Finding\r\nthem in that place, I have thought proper to delay a decision of the\r\nquestion of their removal until I could determine whether the condition\r\nof affairs is now such as to either require or justify continued\r\nmilitary intervention of the National Government in the affairs of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion there does not now exist in Louisiana such domestic\r\nviolence as is contemplated by the Constitution as the ground upon which\r\nthe military power of the National Government may be invoked for the\r\ndefense of the State. The disputes which exist as to the right of\r\ncertain claimants to the chief executive office of that State are to be\r\nsettled and determined, not by the Executive of the United States, but\r\nby such orderly and peaceable methods as may be provided by the\r\nconstitution and the laws of the State.\r\n\r\nHaving the assurance that no resort to violence is contemplated, but, on\r\nthe contrary, the disputes in question are to be settled by peaceful\r\nmethods under and in accordance with law, I deem it proper to take\r\naction in accordance with the principles announced when I entered upon\r\nthe duties of the Presidency.\r\n\r\nYou are therefore directed to see that the proper orders are issued for\r\nthe removal of said troops at an early date from their present position\r\nto such regular barracks in the vicinity as may be selected for their\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nR.B.
