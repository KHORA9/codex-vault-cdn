RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n1902\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume, the fifth of the series, comprises a period of twelve\r\nyears. It includes the four years' term of the Taylor-Fillmore\r\nAdministration and the full terms of Presidents Pierce and Buchanan.\r\nThis brings the history down to March 4, 1861, the beginning of the late\r\nwar between the States. These twelve years form an important and\r\neventful epoch in the affairs of our country, as they immediately\r\nprecede the war and cover the official utterances of the Executives\r\nduring this period. Some of the more important events and incidents of\r\nthese twelve years are the Bulwer-Clayton treaty with Great Britain for\r\na joint occupancy of the proposed ship canal through Central America;\r\nthe compromise measures of 1850; the admission of California, Minnesota,\r\nOregon, and Kansas as States; the Gadsden purchase, by which the United\r\nStates acquired 45,535 square miles of territory, being portions of\r\nArizona and New Mexico; the Kansas-Nebraska legislation; the famous Dred\r\nScott decision; the John Brown insurrection, and the disruption of the\r\nDemocratic party in the national campaign of 1860.\r\n\r\nThis volume contains several veto messages which are interesting. By\r\nPresident Pierce, vetoes of \"An act making a grant of public lands to\r\nthe several States for the benefit of indigent insane persons;\" of six\r\nacts relating to internal improvements; of an act for a subsidy for\r\nocean mails, and of an act for the ascertainment and allowance of French\r\nspoliation claims. By President Buchanan, vetoes of an act granting\r\nlands for agricultural purposes; of two acts relating to internal\r\nimprovements, and of a homestead act.\r\n\r\nInteresting reading is furnished in the protests of President Buchanan\r\nagainst the action of the House of Representatives in ordering the\r\nappointment of a committee to investigate the conduct of the President.\r\n The careful reader will find in this volume errors which the compiler\r\ncould not correct. For instance, on page 410 certain figures are given\r\nfrom a report of the Postmaster-General, which when added do not produce\r\nthe total given. The error may arise from the failure to make the proper\r\naddition, or it may be that the total is correct and that the figures\r\nfirst given are incorrect. The original message contains the same error.\r\nSimilar errors occur elsewhere in the compilation. These matters are,\r\nhowever, trivial and perhaps need not have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON.\r\nJULY 4, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZachary Taylor\r\n\r\nMarch 5, 1849, to July 9, 1850\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZachary Taylor\r\n\r\nZachary Taylor was born in Orange County, Va., November 24, 1784. He was\r\nthe third son of Richard Taylor, a colonel in the War of the Revolution,\r\nwho was conspicuous for his zeal and courage. In 1785 his father removed\r\nto Kentucky, then a sparsely occupied county of Virginia, and made his\r\nhome near the present city of Louisville, where he died. Zachary had but\r\nlittle opportunity for attending school in this new settlement, but was\r\nsurrounded during all the years of his childhood and early manhood by\r\nconditions and circumstances well adapted to form the character\r\nillustrated by his eventful career. In 1808 he was appointed a\r\nLieutenant in the Seventh Infantry, and in 1810 was promoted to the\r\ngrade of captain in the same regiment. The same year was married to Miss\r\nMargaret Smith, of Maryland. For meritorious conduct in defending Fort\r\nHarrison, on the Wabash River, against the Indians received the brevet\r\nof major. In 1814 commanded in a campaign against hostile Indians and\r\ntheir British allies on Rock River. Was made lieutenant-colonel of the\r\nFirst Infantry in 1819, and in 1832 became full colonel of that\r\nregiment, with headquarters at Fort Crawford, Prairie du Chien. Was\r\noccupied with his regiment fighting the Indians in the Black Hawk and\r\nother campaigns until 1836, when he was transferred to Florida for\r\nservice in the Seminole War. For gallant conduct there the next year\r\nreceived the brevet of brigadier-general, and in 1838 was appointed to\r\nthe chief command in Florida. In 1840 was assigned to command the\r\nsouthern division of the western department of the Army. About this time\r\nhe made his family home at Baton Rouge, La. In 1845 was ordered to the\r\ndefense of Texas, which had been annexed to the United States. He went\r\nto Corpus Christi, and on March 8, 1846, advanced, and after some\r\nfighting, in which he routed and drove the enemy across the Rio Grande,\r\non May 18 occupied Matamoras. He remained there for a short period,\r\nobtaining reenforcements. In September fought the enemy at Monterey and\r\ncaptured that town. The following February fought and won the battle of\r\nBuena Vista. In the meantime, besides engagements less important, he had\r\nwon the victories of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, which created\r\ngreat enthusiasm throughout the Union. The terms of capitulation granted\r\nby him to the enemy at Monterey were not approved by the Government at\r\nWashington. Soon after the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma\r\nhe received the rank of brevet major-general, and on June 27, 1846, was\r\nappointed major-general and was commander in chief of all the American\r\nforces in Mexico until Major-General Scott was ordered there in 1846.\r\nThe latter part of November returned to his home in Louisiana. Upon his\r\nreturn to the United States he was received wherever he went with\r\npopular demonstrations. Was nominated for President by the national\r\nconvention of the Whig party at Philadelphia on June 7, 1848, on the\r\nfourth ballot, defeating General Scott, Mr. Clay, and Mr. Webster. At\r\nthe election on November 7 the Whig ticket (Taylor and Fillmore) was\r\nsuccessful, receiving 163 electoral votes, while the Democratic\r\ncandidates (Cass and Butler) each received 127 votes. He was inaugurated\r\nMarch 5, 1849, and died in Washington City July 9, 1850. Was buried in\r\nCave Hill Cemetery, Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nElected by the American people to the highest office known to our laws,\r\nI appear here to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution, and, in\r\ncompliance with a time-honored custom, to address those who are now\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nThe confidence and respect shown by my countrymen in calling me to be\r\nthe Chief Magistrate of a Republic holding a high rank among the nations\r\nof the earth have inspired me with feelings of the most profound\r\ngratitude; but when I reflect that the acceptance of the office which\r\ntheir partiality has bestowed imposes the discharge of the most arduous\r\nduties and involves the weightiest obligations, I am conscious that the\r\nposition which I have been called to fill, though sufficient to satisfy\r\nthe loftiest ambition, is surrounded by fearful responsibilities.\r\nHappily, however, in the performance of my new duties I shall not be\r\nwithout able cooperation. The legislative and judicial branches of the\r\nGovernment present prominent examples of distinguished civil attainments\r\nand matured experience, and it shall be my endeavor to call to my\r\nassistance in the Executive Departments individuals whose talents,\r\nintegrity, and purity of character will furnish ample guaranties for the\r\nfaithful and honorable performance of the trusts to be committed to\r\ntheir charge. With such aids and an honest purpose to do whatever is\r\nright, I hope to execute diligently, impartially, and for the best\r\ninterests of the country the manifold duties devolved upon me.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of these duties my guide will be the Constitution,\r\nwhich I this day swear to \"preserve, protect, and defend.\" For the\r\ninterpretation of that instrument I shall look to the decisions of the\r\njudicial tribunals established by its authority and to the practice of\r\nthe Government under the earlier Presidents, who had so large a share in\r\nits formation. To the example of those illustrious patriots I shall\r\nalways defer with reverence, and especially to his example who was by so\r\nmany titles \"the Father of his Country.\"\r\n\r\nTo command the Army and Navy of the United States; with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and\r\nother officers; to give to Congress information of the state of the\r\nUnion and recommend such measures as he shall judge to be necessary; and\r\nto take care that the laws shall be faithfully executed--these are the\r\nmost important functions intrusted to the President by the Constitution,\r\nand it may be expected that I shall briefly indicate the principles\r\nwhich will control me in their execution.\r\n\r\nChosen by the body of the people under the assurance that my\r\nAdministration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country, and\r\nnot to the support of any particular section or merely local interest, I\r\nthis day renew the declarations I have heretofore made and proclaim my\r\nfixed determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the\r\nGovernment in its original purity and to adopt as the basis of my public\r\npolicy those great republican doctrines which constitute the strength of\r\nour national existence.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the Army and Navy, lately employed with so much\r\ndistinction on active service, care shall be taken to insure the highest\r\ncondition of efficiency, and in furtherance of that object the military\r\nand naval schools, sustained by the liberality of Congress, shall\r\nreceive the special attention of the Executive.\r\n\r\nAs American freemen we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend\r\nthe blessings of civil and political liberty, but at the same time we\r\nare warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own\r\nbeloved Washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign\r\nnations. In all disputes between conflicting governments it is our\r\ninterest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral, while our\r\ngeographical position, the genius of our institutions and our people,\r\nthe advancing spirit of civilization, and, above all, the dictates of\r\nreligion direct us to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relations\r\nwith all other powers. It is to be hoped that no international question\r\ncan now arise which a government confident in its own strength and\r\nresolved to protect its own just rights may not settle by wise\r\nnegotiation; and it eminently becomes a government like our own, founded\r\non the morality and intelligence of its citizens and upheld by their\r\naffections, to exhaust every resort of honorable diplomacy before\r\nappealing to arms. In the conduct of our foreign relations I shall\r\nconform to these views, as I believe them essential to the best\r\ninterests and the true honor of the country.\r\n\r\nThe appointing power vested in the President imposes delicate and\r\nonerous duties. So far as it is possible to be informed, I shall make\r\nhonesty, capacity, and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the\r\nbestowal of office, and the absence of either of these qualities shall\r\nbe deemed sufficient cause for removal.\r\n\r\nIt shall be my study to recommend such constitutional measures to\r\nCongress as may be necessary and proper to secure encouragement and\r\nprotection to the great interests of agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures, to improve our rivers and harbors, to provide for the\r\nspeedy extinguishment of the public debt, to enforce a strict\r\naccountability on the part of all officers of the Government and the\r\nutmost economy in all public expenditures; but it is for the wisdom of\r\nCongress itself, in which all legislative powers are vested by the\r\nConstitution, to regulate these and other matters of domestic policy. I\r\nshall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to\r\nadopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting\r\ninterests and tend to perpetuate that Union which should be the\r\nparamount object of our hopes and affections. In any action calculated\r\nto promote an object so near the heart of everyone who truly loves his\r\ncountry I will zealously unite with the coordinate branches of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I congratulate you, my fellow-citizens, upon the high\r\nstate of prosperity to which the goodness of Divine Providence has\r\nconducted our common country. Let us invoke a continuance of the same\r\nprotecting care which has led us from small beginnings to the eminence\r\nwe this day occupy, and let us seek to deserve that continuance by\r\nprudence and moderation in our councils, by well-directed attempts to\r\nassuage the bitterness which too often marks unavoidable differences of\r\nopinion, by the promulgation and practice of just and liberal\r\nprinciples, and by an enlarged patriotism, which shall acknowledge no\r\nlimits but those of our own widespread Republic.\r\n\r\nMARCH 5, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 13, 1849_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate, in confidence, a report and\r\naccompanying papers[1a] from the Secretary of State, in answer to its\r\nresolution of the 12th instant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1a: Instructions to United States minister at London relative\r\nto further extension of reciprocity and equality in the laws of\r\nnavigation, and contemplating the opening of the coasting trade of the\r\nUnited States to the vessels of other nations.]\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 20, 1849_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of yesterday, passed in\r\nexecutive session, requesting a communication of certain papers relative\r\nto the amendments made by the Senate to the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents by\r\nwhich it was accompanied. It is desirable that the latter should be\r\nreturned to the Department of State.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 22, 1849_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request contained in the resolution of the Senate\r\nyesterday, adopted in executive session, calling for certain papers in\r\nrelation to the amendments made by the Senate in the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that an armed expedition is about to be\r\nfitted out in the United States with an intention to invade the island\r\nof Cuba or some of the Provinces of Mexico. The best information which\r\nthe Executive has been able to obtain points to the island of Cuba as\r\nthe object of this expedition. It is the duty of this Government to\r\nobserve the faith of treaties and to prevent any aggression by our\r\ncitizens upon the territories of friendly nations. I have therefore\r\nthought it necessary and proper to issue this my proclamation to warn\r\nall citizens of the United States who shall connect themselves with an\r\nenterprise so grossly in violation of our laws and our treaty\r\nobligations that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy\r\npenalties denounced against them by our acts of Congress and will\r\nforfeit their claim to the protection of their country. No such persons\r\nmust expect the interference of this Government in any form on their\r\nbehalf, no matter to what extremities they may be reduced in consequence\r\nof their conduct. An enterprise to invade the territories of a friendly\r\nnation, set on foot and prosecuted within the limits of the United\r\nStates, is in the highest degree criminal, as tending to endanger the\r\npeace and compromit the honor of this nation; and therefore I exhort all\r\ngood citizens, as they regard our national reputation, as they respect\r\ntheir own laws and the laws of nations, as they value the blessings of\r\npeace and the welfare of their country, to discountenance and prevent by\r\nall lawful means any such enterprise; and I call upon every officer of\r\nthis Government, civil or military, to use all efforts in his power to\r\narrest for trial and punishment every such offender against the laws\r\nproviding for the performance of our sacred obligations to friendly\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand the 11th day of August, A.D. 1849, and the\r\nseventy-fourth of the Independence of the United States.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  J.M. CLAYTON,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 34.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 19, 1849_.\r\n\r\nI. The following orders of the President of the United States and\r\nSecretary of War communicate to the Army the death of the late\r\nex-President, James K. Polk:\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 19, 1849_.\r\n\r\nThe President with deep regret announces to the American people the\r\ndeath of James K. Polk, late President of the United States, which\r\noccurred at Nashville on the 15th instant.\r\n\r\nA nation is suddenly called upon to mourn the loss of one the\r\nrecollection of whose long services in its councils will be forever\r\npreserved on the tablets of history.\r\n\r\nAs a mark of respect to the memory of a citizen who has been\r\ndistinguished by the highest honors which his country could bestow, it\r\nis ordered that the Executive Mansion and the several Departments at\r\nWashington be immediately placed in mourning and all business be\r\nsuspended during to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIt is further ordered that the War and Navy Departments cause suitable\r\nmilitary and naval honors to be paid on this occasion to the memory of\r\nthe illustrious dead.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _June 19, 1849_.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States with deep regret announces to the\r\nArmy the death of James K. Polk, our distinguished and honored\r\nfellow-citizen.\r\n\r\nHe died at Nashville the 15th instant, having but recently left the\r\ntheater of his high public duties at this capital and retired to his\r\nhome amid the congratulations of his fellow-citizens. He died in the\r\nprime of life, after having received and enjoyed the highest honors of\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nHis Administration was eventful. No branch of the Government will be\r\nmore intimately associated with it in history than the Army and its\r\nglorious achievements. Accordingly, the President orders that\r\nappropriate military honors shall be paid to his memory by the Army of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe Adjutant-General will give the necessary instructions for carrying\r\ninto effect the foregoing orders.\r\n\r\nG.W. CRAWFORD,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. On the day succeeding the arrival of this general order at each\r\nmilitary post the troops will be paraded at 10 o'clock a.m. and the\r\norder read to them, after which all labors for the day will cease.\r\n\r\nThe national flag will be displayed at half-staff.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of day thirteen guns will be fired, and afterwards at intervals\r\nof thirty minutes between the rising and setting sun a single gun, and\r\nat the close of the day a national salute of thirty guns.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Army will wear crape on the left arm and on their\r\nswords and the colors of the several regiments will be put in mourning\r\nfor the period of six months.\r\n\r\nBy order:\r\n\r\nR. JONES,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4, 1849_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nSixty years have elapsed since the establishment of this Government, and\r\nthe Congress of the United States again assembles to legislate for an\r\nempire of freemen. The predictions of evil prophets, who formerly\r\npretended to foretell the downfall of our institutions, are now\r\nremembered only to be derided, and the United States of America at this\r\nmoment present to the world the most stable and permanent Government on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nSuch is the result of the labors of those who have gone before us. Upon\r\nCongress will eminently depend the future maintenance of our system of\r\nfree government and the transmission of it unimpaired to posterity.\r\n\r\nWe are at peace with all the other nations of the world, and seek to\r\nmaintain our cherished relations of amity with them. During the past\r\nyear we have been blessed by a kind Providence with an abundance of the\r\nfruits of the earth, and although the destroying angel for a time\r\nvisited extensive portions of our territory with the ravages of a\r\ndreadful pestilence, yet the Almighty has at length deigned to stay his\r\nhand and to restore the inestimable blessing of general health to a\r\npeople who have acknowledged His power, deprecated His wrath, and\r\nimplored His merciful protection.\r\n\r\nWhile enjoying the benefits of amicable intercourse with foreign\r\nnations, we have not been insensible to the distractions and wars which\r\nhave prevailed in other quarters of the world. It is a proper theme of\r\nthanksgiving to Him who rules the destinies of nations that we have been\r\nable to maintain amidst all these contests an independent and neutral\r\nposition toward all belligerent powers.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain are of the most friendly character. In\r\nconsequence of the recent alteration of the British navigation acts,\r\nBritish vessels, from British and other foreign ports, will under our\r\nexisting laws, after the 1st day of January next, be admitted to entry\r\nin our ports with cargoes of the growth, manufacture, or production of\r\nany part of the world on the same terms as to duties, imposts, and\r\ncharges as vessels of the United States with their cargoes, and our\r\nvessels will be admitted to the same advantages in British ports,\r\nentering therein on the same terms as British vessels. Should no order\r\nin council disturb this legislative arrangement, the late act of the\r\nBritish Parliament, by which Great Britain is brought within the terms\r\nproposed by the act of Congress of the 1st of March, 1817, it is hoped\r\nwill be productive of benefit to both countries.\r\n\r\nA slight interruption of diplomatic intercourse which occurred between\r\nthis Government and France, I am happy to say, has been terminated, and\r\nour minister there has been received. It is therefore unnecessary to\r\nrefer now to the circumstances which led to that interruption. I need\r\nnot express to you the sincere satisfaction with which we shall welcome\r\nthe arrival of another envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\r\nfrom a sister Republic to which we have so long been, and still remain,\r\nbound by the strongest ties of amity.\r\n\r\nShortly after I had entered upon the discharge of the Executive duties I\r\nwas apprised that a war steamer belonging to the German Empire was being\r\nfitted out in the harbor of New York with the aid of some of our naval\r\nofficers, rendered under the permission of the late Secretary of the\r\nNavy. This permission was granted during an armistice between that\r\nEmpire and the Kingdom of Denmark, which had been engaged in the\r\nSchleswig-Holstein war. Apprehensive that this act of intervention on\r\nour part might be viewed as a violation of our neutral obligations\r\nincurred by the treaty with Denmark and of the provisions of the act of\r\nCongress of the 20th of April, 1818, I directed that no further aid\r\nshould be rendered by any agent or officer of the Navy; and I instructed\r\nthe Secretary of State to apprise the minister of the German Empire\r\naccredited to this Government of my determination to execute the law of\r\nthe United States and to maintain the faith of treaties with all\r\nnations. The correspondence which ensued between the Department of State\r\nand the minister of the German Empire is herewith laid before you. The\r\nexecution of the law and the observance of the treaty were deemed by me\r\nto be due to the honor of the country, as well as to the sacred\r\nobligations of the Constitution. I shall not fail to pursue the same\r\ncourse should a similar case arise with any other nation. Having avowed\r\nthe opinion on taking the oath of office that in disputes between\r\nconflicting foreign governments it is our interest not less than our\r\nduty to remain strictly neutral, I shall not abandon it. You will\r\nperceive from the correspondence submitted to you in connection with\r\nthis subject that the course adopted in this case has been properly\r\nregarded by the belligerent powers interested in the matter.\r\n\r\nAlthough a minister of the United States to the German Empire was\r\nappointed by my predecessor in August, 1848, and has for a long time\r\nbeen in attendance at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and although a minister\r\nappointed to represent that Empire was received and accredited here, yet\r\nno such government as that of the German Empire has been definitively\r\nconstituted. Mr. Donelson, our representative at Frankfort, remained\r\nthere several months in the expectation that a union of the German\r\nStates under one constitution or form of government might at length be\r\norganized. It is believed by those well acquainted with the existing\r\nrelations between Prussia and the States of Germany that no such union\r\ncan be permanently established without her cooperation. In the event of\r\nthe formation of such a union and the organization of a central power in\r\nGermany of which she should form a part, it would become necessary to\r\nwithdraw our minister at Berlin; but while Prussia exists as an\r\nindependent kingdom and diplomatic relations are maintained with her\r\nthere can be no necessity for the continuance of the mission to\r\nFrankfort. I have therefore recalled Mr. Donelson and directed the\r\narchives of the legation at Frankfort to be transferred to the American\r\nlegation at Berlin.\r\n\r\nHaving been apprised that a considerable number of adventurers were\r\nengaged in fitting out a military expedition within the United States\r\nagainst a foreign country, and believing from the best information I\r\ncould obtain that it was destined to invade the island of Cuba, I deemed\r\nit due to the friendly relations existing between the United States and\r\nSpain, to the treaty between the two nations, to the laws of the United\r\nStates, and, above all, to the American honor to exert the lawful\r\nauthority of this Government in suppressing the expedition and\r\npreventing the invasion. To this end I issued a proclamation enjoining\r\nit upon the officers of the United States, civil and military, to use\r\nall lawful means within their power. A copy of that proclamation is\r\nherewith submitted. The expedition has been suppressed. So long as the\r\nact of Congress of the 20th of April, 1818, which owes its existence to\r\nthe law of nations and to the policy of Washington himself, shall remain\r\non our statute books, I hold it to be the duty of the Executive\r\nfaithfully to obey its injunctions.\r\n\r\nWhile this expedition was in progress I was informed that a foreigner\r\nwho claimed our protection had been clandestinely and, as was supposed,\r\nforcibly carried off in a vessel from New Orleans to the island of Cuba.\r\nI immediately caused such steps to be taken as I thought necessary, in\r\ncase the information I had received should prove correct, to vindicate\r\nthe honor of the country and the right of every person seeking an asylum\r\non our soil to the protection of our laws. The person alleged to have\r\nbeen abducted was promptly restored, and the circumstances of the case\r\nare now about to undergo investigation before a judicial tribunal. I\r\nwould respectfully suggest that although the crime charged to have been\r\ncommitted in this case is held odious, as being in conflict with our\r\nopinions on the subject of national sovereignty and personal freedom,\r\nthere is no prohibition of it or punishment for it provided in any act\r\nof Congress. The expediency of supplying this defect in our criminal\r\ncode is therefore recommended to your consideration.\r\n\r\nI have scrupulously avoided any interference in the wars and contentions\r\nwhich have recently distracted Europe. During the late conflict between\r\nAustria and Hungary there seemed to be a prospect that the latter might\r\nbecome an independent nation. However faint that prospect at the time\r\nappeared, I thought it my duty, in accordance with the general sentiment\r\nof the American people, who deeply sympathized with the Magyar patriots,\r\nto stand prepared, upon the contingency of the establishment by her of a\r\npermanent government, to be the first to welcome independent Hungary\r\ninto the family of nations. For this purpose I invested an agent then in\r\nEurope with power to declare our willingness promptly to recognize her\r\nindependence in the event of her ability to sustain it. The powerful\r\nintervention of Russia in the contest extinguished the hopes of the\r\nstruggling Magyars. The United States did not at any time interfere in\r\nthe contest, but the feelings of the nation were strongly enlisted in\r\nthe cause, and by the sufferings of a brave people, who had made a\r\ngallant, though unsuccessful, effort to be free.\r\n\r\nOur claims upon Portugal have been during the past year prosecuted with\r\nrenewed vigor, and it has been my object to employ every effort of\r\nhonorable diplomacy to procure their adjustment. Our late chargé\r\nd'affaires at Lisbon, the Hon. George W. Hopkins, made able and\r\nenergetic, but unsuccessful, efforts to settle these unpleasant matters\r\nof controversy and to obtain indemnity for the wrongs which were the\r\nsubjects of complaint. Our present chargé d'affaires at that Court will\r\nalso bring to the prosecution of these claims ability and zeal. The\r\nrevolutionary and distracted condition of Portugal in past times has\r\nbeen represented as one of the leading causes of her delay in\r\nindemnifying our suffering citizens.\r\n\r\nBut I must now say it is matter of profound regret that these claims\r\nhave not yet been settled. The omission of Portugal to do justice to the\r\nAmerican claimants has now assumed a character so grave and serious that\r\nI shall shortly make it the subject of a special message to Congress,\r\nwith a view to such ultimate action as its wisdom and patriotism may\r\nsuggest.\r\n\r\nWith Russia, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, the\r\nNetherlands, and the Italian States we still maintain our accustomed\r\namicable relations.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent revolutions in the Papal States our chargé d'affaires\r\nat Rome has been unable to present his letter of credence, which,\r\nindeed, he was directed by my predecessor to withhold until he should\r\nreceive further orders. Such was the unsettled condition of things in\r\nthose States that it was not deemed expedient to give him any\r\ninstructions on the subject of presenting his credential letter\r\ndifferent from those with which he had been furnished by the late\r\nAdministration until the 25th of June last, when, in consequence of the\r\nwant of accurate information of the exact state of things at that\r\ndistance from us, he was instructed to exercise his own discretion in\r\npresenting himself to the then existing Government if in his judgment\r\nsufficiently stable, or, if not, to await further events. Since that\r\nperiod Rome has undergone another revolution, and he abides the\r\nestablishment of a government sufficiently permanent to justify him in\r\nopening diplomatic intercourse with it.\r\n\r\nWith the Republic of Mexico it is our true policy to cultivate the most\r\nfriendly relations. Since the ratification of the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo nothing has occurred of a serious character to disturb them. A\r\nfaithful observance of the treaty and a sincere respect for her rights\r\ncan not fail to secure the lasting confidence and friendship of that\r\nRepublic. The message of my predecessor to the House of Representatives\r\nof the 8th of February last, communicating, in compliance with a\r\nresolution of that body, a copy of a paper called a protocol, signed at\r\nQueretaro on the 30th of May, 1848, by the commissioners of the United\r\nStates and the minister of foreign affairs of the Mexican Government,\r\nhaving been a subject of correspondence between the Department of State\r\nand the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that\r\nRepublic accredited to this Government, a transcript of that\r\ncorrespondence is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner on the part of the United States for marking the\r\nboundary between the two Republics, though delayed in reaching San Diego\r\nby unforeseen obstacles, arrived at that place within a short period\r\nafter the time required by the treaty, and was there joined by the\r\ncommissioner on the part of Mexico. They entered upon their duties, and\r\nat the date of the latest intelligence from that quarter some progress\r\nhad been made in the survey. The expenses incident to the organization\r\nof the commission and to its conveyance to the point where its\r\noperations were to begin have so much reduced the fund appropriated by\r\nCongress that a further sum, to cover the charges which must be incurred\r\nduring the present fiscal year, will be necessary. The great length of\r\nfrontier along which the boundary extends, the nature of the adjacent\r\nterritory, and the difficulty of obtaining supplies except at or near\r\nthe extremes of the line render it also indispensable that a liberal\r\nprovision should be made to meet the necessary charges during the fiscal\r\nyear ending on the 30th of June, 1851. I accordingly recommend this\r\nsubject to your attention.\r\n\r\nIn the adjustment of the claims of American citizens on Mexico, provided\r\nfor by the late treaty, the employment of counsel on the part of the\r\nGovernment may become important for the purpose of assisting the\r\ncommissioners in protecting the interests of the United States. I\r\nrecommend this subject to the early and favorable consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nComplaints have been made in regard to the inefficiency of the means\r\nprovided by the Government of New Granada for transporting the United\r\nStates mail across the Isthmus of Panama, pursuant to our postal\r\nconvention with that Republic of the 6th of March, 1844. Our chargé\r\nd'affaires at Bogota has been directed to make such representations to\r\nthe Government of New Granada as will, it is hoped, lead to a prompt\r\nremoval of this cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nThe sanguinary civil war with which the Republic of Venezuela has for\r\nsome time past been ravaged has been brought to a close. In its progress\r\nthe rights of some of our citizens resident or trading there have been\r\nviolated. The restoration of order will afford the Venezuelan Government\r\nan opportunity to examine and redress these grievances and others of\r\nlonger standing which our representatives at Caracas have hitherto\r\nineffectually urged upon the attention of that Government.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the coast of the United States on the Pacific and the\r\nunexampled rapidity with which the inhabitants of California especially\r\nare increasing in numbers have imparted new consequence to our relations\r\nwith the other countries whose territories border upon that ocean. It is\r\nprobable that the intercourse between those countries and our\r\npossessions in that quarter, particularly with the Republic of Chili,\r\nwill become extensive and mutually advantageous in proportion as\r\nCalifornia and Oregon shall increase in population and wealth. It is\r\ndesirable, therefore, that this Government should do everything in its\r\npower to foster and strengthen its relations with those States, and that\r\nthe spirit of amity between us should be mutual and cordial.\r\n\r\nI recommend the observance of the same course toward all other American\r\nStates. The United States stand as the great American power, to which,\r\nas their natural ally and friend, they will always be disposed first to\r\nlook for mediation and assistance in the event of any collision between\r\nthem and any European nation. As such we may often kindly mediate in\r\ntheir behalf without entangling ourselves in foreign wars or unnecessary\r\ncontroversies. Whenever the faith of our treaties with any of them shall\r\nrequire our interference, we must necessarily interpose.\r\n\r\nA convention has been negotiated with Brazil providing for the\r\nsatisfaction of American claims on that Government, and it will be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate. Since the last session of Congress we have\r\nreceived an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from that\r\nEmpire, and our relations with it are founded upon the most amicable\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nYour attention is earnestly invited to an amendment of our existing laws\r\nrelating to the African slave trade with a view to the effectual\r\nsuppression of that barbarous traffic. It is not to be denied that this\r\ntrade is still in part carried on by means of vessels built in the\r\nUnited States and owned or navigated by some of our citizens. The\r\ncorrespondence between the Department of State and the minister and\r\nconsul of the United States at Rio de Janeiro, which has from time to\r\ntime been laid before Congress, represents that it is a customary device\r\nto evade the penalties of our laws by means of sea letters. Vessels sold\r\nin Brazil, when provided with such papers by the consul, instead of\r\nreturning to the United States for a new register proceed at once to the\r\ncoast of Africa for the purpose of obtaining cargoes of slaves. Much\r\nadditional information of the same character has recently been\r\ntransmitted to the Department of State. It has not been considered the\r\npolicy of our laws to subject an American citizen who in a foreign\r\ncountry purchases a vessel built in the United States to the\r\ninconvenience of sending her home for a new register before permitting\r\nher to proceed on a voyage. Any alteration of the laws which might have\r\na tendency to impede the free transfer of property in vessels between\r\nour citizens, or the free navigation of those vessels between different\r\nparts of the world when employed in lawful commerce, should be well and\r\ncautiously considered; but I trust that your wisdom will devise a method\r\nby which our general policy in this respect may be preserved, and at the\r\nsame time the abuse of our flag by means of sea letters, in the manner\r\nindicated, may be prevented.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained that there is no prospect of the reunion of the five\r\nStates of Central America which formerly composed the Republic of that\r\nname, we have separately negotiated with some of them treaties of amity\r\nand commerce, which will be laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nA contract having been concluded with the State of Nicaragua by a\r\ncompany composed of American citizens for the purpose of constructing a\r\nship canal through the territory of that State to connect the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific oceans, I have directed the negotiation of a treaty with\r\nNicaragua pledging both Governments to protect those who shall engage\r\nin and perfect the work. All other nations are invited by the State of\r\nNicaragua to enter into the same treaty stipulations with her; and the\r\nbenefit to be derived by each from such an arrangement will be the\r\nprotection of this great interoceanic communication against any power\r\nwhich might seek to obstruct it or to monopolize its advantages. All\r\nStates entering into such a treaty will enjoy the right of passage\r\nthrough the canal on payment of the same tolls. The work, if constructed\r\nunder these guaranties, will become a bond of peace instead of a subject\r\nof contention and strife between the nations of the earth. Should the\r\ngreat maritime States of Europe consent to this arrangement (and we have\r\nno reason to suppose that a proposition so fair and honorable will be\r\nopposed by any), the energies of their people and ours will cooperate in\r\npromoting the success of the enterprise. I do not recommend any\r\nappropriation from the National Treasury for this purpose, nor do I\r\nbelieve that such an appropriation is necessary. Private enterprise, if\r\nproperly protected, will complete the work should it prove to be\r\nfeasible. The parties who have procured the charter from Nicaragua for\r\nits construction desire no assistance from this Government beyond its\r\nprotection; and they profess that, having examined the proposed line of\r\ncommunication, they will be ready to commence the undertaking whenever\r\nthat protection shall be extended to them. Should there appear to be\r\nreason, on examining the whole evidence, to entertain a serious doubt of\r\nthe practicability of constructing such a canal, that doubt could be\r\nspeedily solved by an actual exploration of the route.\r\n\r\nShould such a work be constructed under the common protection of all\r\nnations, for equal benefits to all, it would be neither just nor\r\nexpedient that any great maritime state should command the\r\ncommunication. The territory through which the canal may be opened ought\r\nto be freed from the claims of any foreign power. No such power should\r\noccupy a position that would enable it hereafter to exercise so\r\ncontrolling an influence over the commerce of the world or to obstruct a\r\nhighway which ought to be dedicated to the common uses of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe routes across the Isthmus at Tehuantepec and Panama are also worthy\r\nof our serious consideration. They did not fail to engage the attention\r\nof my predecessor. The negotiator of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was\r\ninstructed to offer a very large sum of money for the right of transit\r\nacross the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The Mexican Government did not accede\r\nto the proposition for the purchase of the right of way, probably\r\nbecause it had already contracted with private individuals for the\r\nconstruction of a passage from the Guasacualco River to Tehuantepec. I\r\nshall not renew any proposition to purchase for money a right which\r\nought to be equally secured to all nations on payment of a reasonable\r\ntoll to the owners of the improvement, who would doubtless be well\r\ncontented with that compensation and the guaranties of the maritime\r\nstates of the world in separate treaties negotiated with Mexico, binding\r\nher and them to protect those who should construct the work. Such\r\nguaranties would do more to secure the completion of the communication\r\nthrough the territory of Mexico than any other reasonable consideration\r\nthat could be offered; and as Mexico herself would be the greatest\r\ngainer by the opening of this communication between the Gulf and the\r\nPacific Ocean, it is presumed that she would not hesitate to yield her\r\naid in the manner proposed to accomplish an improvement so important to\r\nher own best interests.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to hope that the proposed railroad across the Isthmus at\r\nPanama will be successfully constructed under the protection of the late\r\ntreaty with New Granada, ratified and exchanged by my predecessor on the\r\n10th day of June, 1848, which guarantees the perfect neutrality of the\r\nIsthmus and the rights of sovereignty and property of New Granada over\r\nthat territory, \"with a view that the free transit from ocean to ocean\r\nmay not be interrupted or embarrassed\" during the existence of the\r\ntreaty. It is our policy to encourage every practicable route across the\r\nisthmus which connects North and South America, either by railroad or\r\ncanal, which the energy and enterprise of our citizens may induce them\r\nto complete, and I consider it obligatory upon me to adopt that policy,\r\nespecially in consequence of the absolute necessity of facilitating\r\nintercourse with our possessions on the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Sandwich Islands with reference to the territory of\r\nthe United States on the Pacific, the success of our persevering and\r\nbenevolent citizens who have repaired to that remote quarter in\r\nChristianizing the natives and inducing them to adopt a system of\r\ngovernment and laws suited to their capacity and wants, and the use made\r\nby our numerous whale ships of the harbors of the islands as places of\r\nresort for obtaining refreshments and repairs all combine to render\r\ntheir destiny peculiarly interesting to us. It is our duty to encourage\r\nthe authorities of those islands in their efforts to improve and elevate\r\nthe moral and political condition of the inhabitants, and we should make\r\nreasonable allowances for the difficulties inseparable from this task.\r\nWe desire that the islands may maintain their independence and that\r\nother nations should concur with us in this sentiment. We could in no\r\nevent be indifferent to their passing under the dominion of any other\r\npower. The principal commercial states have in this a common interest,\r\nand it is to be hoped that no one of them will attempt to interpose\r\nobstacles to the entire independence of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of\r\nJune last were, in cash, $48,830,097.50, and in Treasury notes funded\r\n$10,833,000, making an aggregate of $59,663,097.50; and the expenditures\r\nfor the same time were, in cash, $46,798,667.82, and in Treasury notes\r\nfunded $10,833,000, making an aggregate of $57,631,667.82.\r\n\r\nThe accounts and estimates which will be submitted to Congress in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury show that there will probably\r\nbe a deficit occasioned by the expenses of the Mexican War and treaty on\r\nthe 1st day of July next of $5,828,121.66, and on the 1st day of July,\r\n1851, of $10,547,092.73, making in the whole a probable deficit to be\r\nprovided for of $16,375,214.39. The extraordinary expenses of the war\r\nwith Mexico and the purchase of California and New Mexico exceed in\r\namount this deficit, together with the loans heretofore made for those\r\nobjects. I therefore recommend that authority be given to borrow\r\nwhatever sum may be necessary to cover that deficit. I recommend the\r\nobservance of strict economy in the appropriation and expenditure of\r\npublic money.\r\n\r\nI recommend a revision of the existing tariff and its adjustment on a\r\nbasis which may augment the revenue. I do not doubt the right or duty of\r\nCongress to encourage domestic industry, which is the great source of\r\nnational as well as individual wealth and prosperity. I look to the\r\nwisdom and patriotism of Congress for the adoption of a system which may\r\nplace home labor at last on a sure and permanent footing and by due\r\nencouragement of manufactures give a new and increased stimulus to\r\nagriculture and promote the development of our vast resources and the\r\nextension of our commerce. Believing that to the attainment of these\r\nends, as well as the necessary augmentation of the revenue and the\r\nprevention of frauds, a system of specific duties is best adapted, I\r\nstrongly recommend to Congress the adoption of that system, fixing the\r\nduties at rates high enough to afford substantial and sufficient\r\nencouragement to our own industry and at the same time so adjusted as to\r\ninsure stability.\r\n\r\nThe question of the continuance of the subtreasury system is\r\nrespectfully submitted to the wisdom of Congress. If continued,\r\nimportant modifications of it appear to be indispensable.\r\n\r\nFor further details and views on the above and other matters connected\r\nwith commerce, the finances, and revenue I refer to the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nNo direct aid has been given by the General Government to the\r\nimprovement of agriculture except by the expenditure of small sums for\r\nthe collection and publication of agricultural statistics and for some\r\nchemical analyses, which have been thus far paid for out of the patent\r\nfund. This aid is, in my opinion, wholly inadequate. To give to this\r\nleading branch of American industry the encouragement which it merits, I\r\nrespectfully recommend the establishment of an agricultural bureau, to\r\nbe connected with the Department of the Interior. To elevate the social\r\ncondition of the agriculturist, to increase his prosperity, and to\r\nextend his means of usefulness to his country, by multiplying his\r\nsources of information, should be the study of every statesman and a\r\nprimary object with every legislator.\r\n\r\nNo civil government having been provided by Congress for California, the\r\npeople of that Territory, impelled by the necessities of their political\r\ncondition, recently met in convention for the purpose of forming a\r\nconstitution and State government, which the latest advices give me\r\nreason to suppose has been accomplished; and it is believed they will\r\nshortly apply for the admission of California into the Union as a\r\nsovereign State. Should such be the case, and should their constitution\r\nbe conformable to the requisitions of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, I recommend their application to the favorable consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe people of New Mexico will also, it is believed, at no very distant\r\nperiod present themselves for admission into the Union. Preparatory to\r\nthe admission of California and New Mexico the people of each will have\r\ninstituted for themselves a republican form of government, \"laying its\r\nfoundation in such principles and organizing its powers in such form as\r\nto them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\" By\r\nawaiting their action all causes of uneasiness may be avoided and\r\nconfidence and kind feeling preserved. With a view of maintaining the\r\nharmony and tranquillity so dear to all, we should abstain from the\r\nintroduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character which\r\nhave hitherto produced painful apprehensions in the public mind; and I\r\nrepeat the solemn warning of the first and most illustrious of my\r\npredecessors against furnishing \"any ground for characterizing parties\r\nby geographical discriminations.\"\r\n\r\nA collector has been appointed at San Francisco under the act of\r\nCongress extending the revenue laws over California, and measures have\r\nbeen taken to organize the custom-houses at that and the other ports\r\nmentioned in that act at the earliest period practicable. The collector\r\nproceeded overland, and advices have not yet been received of his\r\narrival at San Francisco. Meanwhile, it is understood that the customs\r\nhave continued to be collected there by officers acting under the\r\nmilitary authority, as they were during the Administration of my\r\npredecessor. It will, I think, be expedient to confirm the collections\r\nthus made, and direct the avails (after such allowances as Congress may\r\nthink fit to authorize) to be expended within the Territory or to be\r\npaid into the Treasury for the purpose of meeting appropriations for the\r\nimprovement of its rivers and harbors.\r\n\r\nA party engaged on the coast survey was dispatched to Oregon in January\r\nlast. According to the latest advices, they had not left California; and\r\ndirections have been given to them, as soon as they shall have fixed on\r\nthe sites of the two light-houses and the buoys authorized to be\r\nconstructed and placed in Oregon, to proceed without delay to make\r\nreconnoissances of the most important points on the coast of California,\r\nand especially to examine and determine on sites for light-houses on\r\nthat coast, the speedy erection of which is urgently demanded by our\r\nrapidly increasing commerce.\r\n\r\nI have transferred the Indian agencies from upper Missouri and Council\r\nBluffs to Santa Fe and Salt Lake, and have caused to be appointed\r\nsub-agents in the valleys of the Gila, the Sacramento, and the San\r\nJoaquin rivers. Still further legal provisions will be necessary for the\r\neffective and successful extension of our system of Indian intercourse\r\nover the new territories.\r\n\r\nI recommend the establishment of a branch mint in California, as it\r\nwill, in my opinion, afford important facilities to those engaged in\r\nmining, as well as to the Government in the disposition of the mineral\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that commissions be organized by Congress to examine\r\nand decide upon the validity of the present subsisting land titles in\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico, and that provision be made for the\r\nestablishment of offices of surveyor-general in New Mexico, California,\r\nand Oregon and for the surveying and bringing into market the public\r\nlands in those Territories. Those lands, remote in position and\r\ndifficult of access, ought to be disposed of on terms liberal to all,\r\nbut especially favorable to the early emigrants.\r\n\r\nIn order that the situation and character of the principal mineral\r\ndeposits in California may be ascertained, I recommend that a geological\r\nand mineralogical exploration be connected with the linear surveys, and\r\nthat the mineral lands be divided into small lots suitable for mining\r\nand be disposed of by sale or lease, so as to give our citizens an\r\nopportunity of procuring a permanent right of property in the soil. This\r\nwould seem to be as important to the success of mining as of\r\nagricultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe great mineral wealth of California and the advantages which its\r\nports and harbors and those of Oregon afford to commerce, especially\r\nwith the islands of the Pacific and Indian oceans and the populous\r\nregions of eastern Asia, make it certain that there will arise in a few\r\nyears large and prosperous communities on our western coast. It\r\ntherefore becomes important that a line of communication, the best and\r\nmost expeditious which the nature of the country will admit, should be\r\nopened within the territory of the United States from the navigable\r\nwaters of the Atlantic or the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific. Opinion, as\r\nelicited and expressed by two large and respectable conventions lately\r\nassembled at St. Louis and Memphis, points to a railroad as that which,\r\nif practicable, will best meet the wishes and wants of the country. But\r\nwhile this, if in successful operation, would be a work of great\r\nnational importance and of a value to the country which it would be\r\ndifficult to estimate, it ought also to be regarded as an undertaking of\r\nvast magnitude and expense, and one which must, if it be indeed\r\npracticable, encounter many difficulties in its construction and use.\r\nTherefore, to avoid failure and disappointment; to enable Congress to\r\njudge whether in the condition of the country through which it must pass\r\nthe work be feasible, and, if it be found so, whether it should be\r\nundertaken as a national improvement or left to individual enterprise,\r\nand in the latter alternative what aid, if any, ought to be extended to\r\nit by the Government, I recommend as a preliminary measure a careful\r\nreconnoissance of the several proposed routes by a scientific corps and\r\na report as to the practicability of making such a road, with an\r\nestimate of the cost of its construction and support.\r\n\r\nFor further views on these and other matters connected with the duties\r\nof the home department I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nI recommend early appropriations for continuing the river and harbor\r\nimprovements which have been already begun, and also for the\r\nconstruction of those for which estimates have been made, as well as for\r\nexaminations and estimates preparatory to the commencement of such\r\nothers as the wants of the country, and especially the advance of our\r\npopulation over new districts and the extension of commerce, may render\r\nnecessary. An estimate of the amount which can be advantageously\r\nexpended within the next fiscal year under the direction of the Bureau\r\nof Topographical Engineers accompanies the report of the Secretary of\r\nWar, to which I respectfully invite the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe cession of territory made by the late treaty with Mexico has greatly\r\nextended our exposed frontier and rendered its defense more difficult.\r\nThat treaty has also brought us under obligations to Mexico, to comply\r\nwith which a military force is requisite. But our military establishment\r\nis not materially changed as to its efficiency from the condition in\r\nwhich it stood before the commencement of the Mexican War. Some addition\r\nto it will therefore be necessary, and I recommend to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress an increase of the several corps of the Army\r\nat our distant Western posts, as proposed in the accompanying report of\r\nthe Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nGreat embarrassment has resulted from the effect upon rank in the Army\r\nheretofore given to brevet and staff commissions. The views of the\r\nSecretary of War on this subject are deemed important, and if carried\r\ninto effect will, it is believed, promote the harmony of the service.\r\nThe plan proposed for retiring disabled officers and providing an asylum\r\nfor such of the rank and file as from age, wounds, and other infirmities\r\noccasioned by service have become unfit to perform their respective\r\nduties is recommended as a means of increasing the efficiency of the\r\nArmy and as an act of justice due from a grateful country to the\r\nfaithful soldier.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a full and\r\nsatisfactory account of the condition and operations of the naval\r\nservice during the past year. Our citizens engaged in the legitimate\r\npursuits of commerce have enjoyed its benefits. Wherever our national\r\nvessels have gone they have been received with respect, our officers\r\nhave been treated with kindness and courtesy, and they have on all\r\noccasions pursued a course of strict neutrality, in accordance with the\r\npolicy of our Government.\r\n\r\nThe naval force at present in commission is as large as is admissible\r\nwith the number of men authorized by Congress to be employed.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of the\r\nNavy on the subject of a reorganization of the Navy in its various\r\ngrades of officers, and the establishing of a retired list for such of\r\nthe officers as are disqualified for active and effective service.\r\nShould Congress adopt some such measure as is recommended, it will\r\ngreatly increase the efficiency of the Navy and reduce its expenditures.\r\n\r\nI also ask your attention to the views expressed by him in reference to\r\nthe employment of war steamers and in regard to the contracts for the\r\ntransportation of the United States mails and the operation of the\r\nsystem upon the prosperity of the Navy.\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress passed August 14, 1848, provision was made for\r\nextending post-office and mail accommodations to California and Oregon.\r\nExertions have been made to execute that law, but the limited provisions\r\nof the act, the inadequacy of the means it authorizes, the ill\r\nadaptation of our post-office laws to the situation of that country, and\r\nthe measure of compensation for services allowed by those laws, compared\r\nwith the prices of labor and rents in California, render those exertions\r\nin a great degree ineffectual. More particular and efficient provision\r\nby law is required on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1845 reducing postage has now, by its operation during four\r\nyears, produced results fully showing that the income from such reduced\r\npostage is sufficient to sustain the whole expense of the service of the\r\nPost-Office Department, not including the cost of transportation in mail\r\nsteamers on the lines from New York to Chagres and from Panama to\r\nAstoria, which have not been considered by Congress as properly\r\nbelonging to the mail service.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted to the wisdom of Congress whether a further reduction of\r\npostage should not now be made, more particularly on the letter\r\ncorrespondence. This should be relieved from the unjust burden of\r\ntransporting and delivering the franked matter of Congress, for which\r\npublic service provision should be made from the Treasury. I confidently\r\nbelieve that a change may safely be made reducing all single-letter\r\npostage to the uniform rate of 5 cents, regardless of distance, without\r\nthereby imposing any greater tax on the Treasury than would constitute a\r\nvery moderate compensation for this public service; and I therefore\r\nrespectfully recommend such a reduction. Should Congress prefer to\r\nabolish the franking privilege entirely, it seems probable that no\r\ndemand on the Treasury would result from the proposed reduction of\r\npostage. Whether any further diminution should now be made, or the\r\nresult of the reduction to 5 cents, which I have recommended, should be\r\nfirst tested, is submitted to your decision.\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the last session of Congress a postal treaty\r\nwith Great Britain has been received and ratified, and such relations\r\nhave been formed by the post-office departments of the two countries in\r\npursuance of that treaty as to carry its provisions into full operation.\r\nThe attempt to extend this same arrangement through England to France\r\nhas not been equally successful, but the purpose has not been abandoned.\r\n\r\nFor a particular statement of the condition of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment and other matters connected with that branch of the public\r\nservice I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 3d of March, 1849, a board was constituted to make\r\narrangements for taking the Seventh Census, composed of the Secretary\r\nof State, the Attorney-General, and the Postmaster-General; and it was\r\nmade the duty of this board \"to prepare and cause to be printed such\r\nforms and schedules as might be necessary for the full enumeration of\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States, and also proper forms and\r\nschedules for collecting in statistical tables, under proper heads, such\r\ninformation as to mines, agriculture, commerce, manufactures, education,\r\nand other topics as would exhibit a full view of the pursuits, industry,\r\neducation, and resources of the country.\" The duties enjoined upon the\r\ncensus board thus established having been performed, it now rests with\r\nCongress to enact a law for carrying into effect the provision of the\r\nConstitution which requires an actual enumeration of the people of the\r\nUnited States within the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nAmong the duties assigned by the Constitution to the General Government\r\nis one of local and limited application, but not on that account the\r\nless obligatory. I allude to the trust committed to Congress as the\r\nexclusive legislator and sole guardian of the interests of the District\r\nof Columbia. I beg to commend these interests to your kind attention. As\r\nthe national metropolis the city of Washington must be an object of\r\ngeneral interest; and founded, as it was, under the auspices of him\r\nwhose immortal name it bears, its claims to the fostering care of\r\nCongress present themselves with additional strength. Whatever can\r\ncontribute to its prosperity must enlist the feelings of its\r\nconstitutional guardians and command their favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nOur Government is one of limited powers, and its successful\r\nadministration eminently depends on the confinement of each of its\r\ncoordinate branches within its own appropriate sphere. The first section\r\nof the Constitution ordains that--\r\n\r\n   All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress\r\nof the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe Executive has authority to recommend (not to dictate) measures to\r\nCongress. Having performed that duty, the executive department of the\r\nGovernment can not rightfully control the decision of Congress on any\r\nsubject of legislation until that decision shall have been officially\r\nsubmitted to the President for approval. The check provided by the\r\nConstitution in the clause conferring the qualified veto will never be\r\nexercised by me except in the cases contemplated by the fathers of the\r\nRepublic. I view it as an extreme measure, to be resorted to only in\r\nextraordinary cases, as where it may become necessary to defend the\r\nexecutive against the encroachments of the legislative power or to\r\nprevent hasty and inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation. By\r\ncautiously confining this remedy within the sphere prescribed to it in\r\nthe cotemporaneous expositions of the framers of the Constitution, the\r\nwill of the people, legitimately expressed on all subjects of\r\nlegislation through their constitutional organs, the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives of the United States, will have its full effect. As\r\nindispensable to the preservation of our system of self-government, the\r\nindependence of the representatives of the States and the people is\r\nguaranteed by the Constitution, and they owe no responsibility to any\r\nhuman power but their constituents. By holding the representative\r\nresponsible only to the people, and exempting him from all other\r\ninfluences, we elevate the character of the constituent and quicken his\r\nsense of responsibility to his country. It is under these circumstances\r\nonly that the elector can feel that in the choice of the lawmaker he is\r\nhimself truly a component part of the sovereign power of the nation.\r\nWith equal care we should study to defend the rights of the executive\r\nand judicial departments. Our Government can only be preserved in its\r\npurity by the suppression and entire elimination of every claim or\r\ntendency of one coordinate branch to encroachment upon another. With the\r\nstrict observance of this rule and the other injunctions of the\r\nConstitution, with a sedulous inculcation of that respect and love for\r\nthe Union of the States which our fathers cherished and enjoined upon\r\ntheir children, and with the aid of that overruling Providence which has\r\nso long and so kindly guarded our liberties and institutions, we may\r\nreasonably expect to transmit them, with their innumerable blessings, to\r\nthe remotest posterity.\r\n\r\nBut attachment to the Union of the States should be habitually fostered\r\nin every American heart. For more than half a century, during which\r\nkingdoms and empires have fallen, this Union has stood unshaken. The\r\npatriots who formed it have long since descended to the grave; yet still\r\nit remains, the proudest monument to their memory and the object of\r\naffection and admiration with everyone worthy to bear the American name.\r\nIn my judgment its dissolution would be the greatest of calamities, and\r\nto avert that should be the study of every American. Upon its\r\npreservation must depend our own happiness and that of countless\r\ngenerations to come. Whatever dangers may threaten it, I shall stand by\r\nit and maintain it in its integrity to the full extent of the\r\nobligations imposed and the powers conferred upon me by the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nZ.

A copy of a dispatch from Mr. Tod, the\r\nUnited States minister at Rio de Janeiro, relative to the convention is\r\nalso herewith communicated. As it is understood that the Emperor's\r\nratification is ready to be exchanged for that of the United States, and\r\nas the period limited for the exchange will expire on the 27th of next\r\nmonth, it is desirable that the decision of the Senate in regard to the\r\ninstrument should be known as soon as may be convenient.\r\n\r\nZ.

TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 4, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith submit to you copies of a correspondence with the lady of Sir\r\nJohn Franklin, relative to the well-known expedition under his command\r\nto the arctic regions for the discovery of a northwest passage. On the\r\nreceipt of her first letter imploring the aid of the American Government\r\nin a search for the missing ships engaged in an enterprise which\r\ninterested all civilized nations, I anxiously sought the means of\r\naffording that assistance, but was prevented from accomplishing the\r\nobject I had in view in consequence of the want of vessels suitable to\r\nencounter the perils of a proper exploration, the lateness of the\r\nseason, and the want of an appropriation by Congress to enable me to\r\nfurnish and equip an efficient squadron for that object. All that I\r\ncould do in compliance with a request which I was deeply anxious to\r\ngratify was to cause the advertisements of reward promulged by the\r\nBritish Government and the best information I could obtain as to the\r\nmeans of finding the vessels under the command of Sir John Franklin to\r\nbe widely circulated among our whalers and seafaring men whose spirit\r\nof enterprise might lead them to the inhospitable regions where that\r\nheroic officer and his brave followers, who periled their lives in the\r\ncause of science and for the benefit of the world, were supposed to be\r\nimprisoned among the icebergs or wrecked upon a desert shore.\r\n\r\nCongress being now in session, the propriety and expediency of an\r\nappropriation for fitting out an expedition to proceed in search of the\r\nmissing ships, with their officers and crews, is respectfully submitted\r\nto your consideration.\r\n\r\nZ.

TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 14, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit reports from the Secretary of State and the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, containing the information called for by the\r\nresolution of the Senate of the 7th instant, in relation to the\r\nabduction[2a] of Rey, _alias_ Garcia, from New Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2a: By the Spanish consul at New Orleans.]\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 14, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their consideration, a copy of a\r\ncorrespondence between the Department of State and the chargé d'affaires\r\nof Austria near this Government, on the subject of the convention for\r\nthe extension of certain stipulations contained in the treaty of\r\ncommerce and navigation of August 27, 1829, between the United States\r\nand Austria, concluded and signed on the 8th of May, 1848, and submitted\r\nto the Senate on the same day by my predecessor.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to a resolution of that body\r\npassed on the 17th instant, the accompanying reports of heads of\r\nDepartments, which contain all the official information in the\r\npossession of the Executive asked for by the resolution.\r\n\r\nOn coming into office I found the military commandant of the Department\r\nof California exercising the functions of civil governor in that\r\nTerritory, and left, as I was, to act under the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo, without the aid of any legislative provision establishing a\r\ngovernment in that Territory, I thought it best not to disturb that\r\narrangement, made under my predecessor, until Congress should take some\r\naction on that subject. I therefore did not interfere with the powers of\r\nthe military commandant, who continued to exercise the functions of\r\ncivil governor as before; but I made no such appointment, conferred no\r\nsuch authority, and have allowed no increased compensation to the\r\ncommandant for his services.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the faithful execution of the treaty so far as lay in the\r\npower of the Executive, and to enable Congress to act at the present\r\nsession with as full knowledge and as little difficulty as possible on\r\nall matters of interest in these Territories, I sent the Hon. Thomas\r\nButler King as bearer of dispatches to California, and certain officers\r\nto California and New Mexico, whose duties are particularly defined in\r\nthe accompanying letters of instruction addressed to them severally by\r\nthe proper Departments.\r\n\r\nI did not hesitate to express to the people of those Territories my\r\ndesire that each Territory should, if prepared to comply with the\r\nrequisitions of the Constitution of the United States, form a plan of a\r\nState constitution and submit the same to Congress with a prayer for\r\nadmission into the Union as a State, but I did not anticipate, suggest,\r\nor authorize the establishment of any such government without the assent\r\nof Congress, nor did I authorize any Government agent or officer to\r\ninterfere with or exercise any influence or control over the election of\r\ndelegates or over any convention in making or modifying their domestic\r\ninstitutions or any of the provisions of their proposed constitution. On\r\nthe contrary, the instructions given by my orders were that all measures\r\nof domestic policy adopted by the people of California must originate\r\nsolely with themselves; that while the Executive of the United States\r\nwas desirous to protect them in the formation of any government\r\nrepublican in its character, to be at the proper time submitted to\r\nCongress, yet it was to be distinctly understood that the plan of such a\r\ngovernment must at the same time be the result of their own deliberate\r\nchoice and originate with themselves, without the interference of the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nI am unable to give any information as to laws passed by any supposed\r\ngovernment in California or of any census taken in either of the\r\nTerritories mentioned in the resolution, as I have no information on\r\nthose subjects.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, I have not disturbed the arrangements which I found\r\nhad existed under my predecessor.\r\n\r\nIn advising an early application by the people of these Territories for\r\nadmission as States I was actuated principally by an earnest desire to\r\nafford to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress the opportunity of\r\navoiding occasions of bitter and angry dissensions among the people of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nUnder the Constitution every State has the right of establishing and\r\nfrom time to time altering its municipal laws and domestic institutions\r\nindependently of every other State and of the General Government,\r\nsubject only to the prohibitions and guaranties expressly set forth in\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. The subjects thus left\r\nexclusively to the respective States were not designed or expected to\r\nbecome topics of national agitation. Still, as under the Constitution\r\nCongress has power to make all needful rules and regulations respecting\r\nthe Territories of the United States, every new acquisition of territory\r\nhas led to discussions on the question whether the system of involuntary\r\nservitude which prevails in many of the States should or should not be\r\nprohibited in that territory. The periods of excitement from this cause\r\nwhich have heretofore occurred have been safely passed, but during the\r\ninterval, of whatever length, which may elapse before the admission of\r\nthe Territories ceded by Mexico as States it appears probable that\r\nsimilar excitement will prevail to an undue extent.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I thought, and still think, that it was my\r\nduty to endeavor to put it in the power of Congress, by the admission of\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico as States, to remove all occasion for the\r\nunnecessary agitation of the public mind.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the people of the western part of California have\r\nformed a plan of a State constitution and will soon submit the same to\r\nthe judgment of Congress and apply for admission as a State. This course\r\non their part, though in accordance with, was not adopted exclusively in\r\nconsequence of, any expression of my wishes, inasmuch as measures\r\ntending to this end had been promoted by the officers sent there by my\r\npredecessor, and were already in active progress of execution before any\r\ncommunication from me reached California. If the proposed constitution\r\nshall, when submitted to Congress, be found to be in compliance with the\r\nrequisitions of the Constitution of the United States, I earnestly\r\nrecommend that it may receive the sanction of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe part of California not included in the proposed State of that name\r\nis believed to be uninhabited, except in a settlement of our countrymen\r\nin the vicinity of Salt Lake.\r\n\r\nA claim has been advanced by the State of Texas to a very large portion\r\nof the most populous district of the Territory commonly designated by\r\nthe name of New Mexico. If the people of New Mexico had formed a plan of\r\na State government for that Territory as ceded by the treaty of\r\nGuadalupe Hidalgo, and had been admitted by Congress as a State, our\r\nConstitution would have afforded the means of obtaining an adjustment of\r\nthe question of boundary with Texas by a judicial decision. At present,\r\nhowever, no judicial tribunal has the power of deciding that question,\r\nand it remains for Congress to devise some mode for its adjustment.\r\nMeanwhile I submit to Congress the question whether it would be\r\nexpedient before such adjustment to establish a Territorial government,\r\nwhich by including the district so claimed would practically decide the\r\nquestion adversely to the State of Texas, or by excluding it would\r\ndecide it in her favor. In my opinion such a course would not be\r\nexpedient, especially as the people of this Territory still enjoy the\r\nbenefit and protection of their municipal laws originally derived from\r\nMexico and have a military force stationed there to protect them against\r\nthe Indians. It is undoubtedly true that the property, lives, liberties,\r\nand religion of the people of New Mexico are better protected than they\r\never were before the treaty of cession.\r\n\r\nShould Congress, when California shall present herself for incorporation\r\ninto the Union, annex a condition to her admission as a State affecting\r\nher domestic institutions contrary to the wishes of her people, and even\r\ncompel her temporarily to comply with it, yet the State could change her\r\nconstitution at any time after admission when to her it should seem\r\nexpedient. Any attempt to deny to the people of the State the right of\r\nself-government in a matter which peculiarly affects themselves will\r\ninfallibly be regarded by them as an invasion of their rights, and, upon\r\nthe principles laid down in our own Declaration of Independence, they\r\nwill certainly be sustained by the great mass of the American people. To\r\nassert that they are a conquered people and must as a State submit to\r\nthe will of their conquerors in this regard will meet with no cordial\r\nresponse among American freemen. Great numbers of them are native\r\ncitizens of the United States, not inferior to the rest of our\r\ncountrymen in intelligence and patriotism, and no language of menace to\r\nrestrain them in the exercise of an undoubted right, substantially\r\nguaranteed to them by the treaty of cession itself, shall ever be\r\nuttered by me or encouraged and sustained by persons acting under my\r\nauthority. It is to be expected that in the residue of the territory\r\nceded to us by Mexico the people residing there will at the time of\r\ntheir incorporation into the Union as a State settle all questions of\r\ndomestic policy to suit themselves.\r\n\r\nNo material inconvenience will result from the want for a short period\r\nof a government established by Congress over that part of the territory\r\nwhich lies eastward of the new State of California; and the reasons for\r\nmy opinion that New Mexico will at no very distant period ask for\r\nadmission into the Union are founded on unofficial information which, I\r\nsuppose, is common to all who have cared to make inquiries on that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nSeeing, then, that the question which now excites such painful\r\nsensations in the country will in the end certainly be settled by the\r\nsilent effect of causes independent of the action of Congress, I again\r\nsubmit to your wisdom the policy recommended in my annual message of\r\nawaiting the salutary operation of those causes, believing that we shall\r\nthus avoid the creation of geographical parties and secure the harmony\r\nof feeling so necessary to the beneficial action of our political\r\nsystem. Connected, as the Union is, with the remembrance of past\r\nhappiness, the sense of present blessings, and the hope of future peace\r\nand prosperity, every dictate of wisdom, every feeling of duty, and\r\nevery emotion of patriotism tend to inspire fidelity and devotion to it\r\nand admonish us cautiously to avoid any unnecessary controversy which\r\ncan either endanger it or impair its strength, the chief element of\r\nwhich is to be found in the regard and affection of the people for each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nZ.

It is desirable that Congress should prescribe the mode in\r\nwhich the claims referred to are to be adjusted and the money stipulated\r\nto be paid by Brazil shall be distributed amongst the claimants.\r\nExtracts from dispatches of the minister of the United States at Rio de\r\nJaneiro and a copy of a letter from an agent of claimants there are also\r\nherewith communicated, to which your attention is invited. I have\r\nauthorized our minister to demand, receive, and give acquittances for\r\nthe amount payable by Brazil, and have caused him to be instructed to\r\nremit the same to the Treasury of the United States.\r\n\r\nZ.

George Squier, chargé d'affaires of the United\r\nStates, on their part, and Señor Zepeda, on the part of the Republic of\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\nI also transmit, for the advice of the Senate in regard to its\r\nratification, \"a general treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce\"\r\nnegotiated by Mr. Squier with the Republic of San Salvador.\r\n\r\nI also transmit to the Senate a copy of the instructions to and\r\ncorrespondence with the said chargé d'affaires relating to those\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nI also transmit, for the advice of the Senate in regard to its\r\nratification, \"a general treaty of peace, amity, commerce, and\r\nnavigation\" negotiated by Elijah Hise, our late chargé d'affaires, with\r\nthe State of Guatemala.\r\n\r\nI also transmit, for the information of the Senate, a copy of a treaty\r\nnegotiated by Mr. Hise with the Government of Nicaragua on the 21st of\r\nJune last, accompanied by copies of his instructions from and\r\ncorrespondence with the Department of State.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th day of November, 1847, Señor Buétrago, secretary of state\r\nand of the affairs of war and foreign relations and domestic\r\nadministration of the Supreme Government of the State of Nicaragua,\r\naddressed a letter from the Government House at Leon to Mr. Buchanan,\r\nthen Secretary of State of the United States, asking the friendly\r\noffices of this Government to prevent an attack upon the town of San\r\nJuan de Nicaragua, then contemplated by the British authorities as the\r\nallies of the Mosquito King. That letter, a translation of which is\r\nherewith sent, distinctly charges that--\r\n\r\n   The object of the British in taking this key of the continent is not\r\nto protect the small tribe of the Mosquitos, but to establish their own\r\nempire over the Atlantic extremity of the line, by which a canal\r\nconnecting the two oceans is most practicable, insuring to them the\r\npreponderance on the American continent, as well as their direct\r\nrelations with Asia, the East Indies, and other important countries in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nNo answer appears to have been returned to this letter.\r\n\r\nA communication was received by my predecessor from Don José Guerrero,\r\nPresident and Supreme Director of the State of Nicaragua, dated the 15th\r\nday of December, 1847, expressing his desire to establish relations of\r\namity and commerce with the United States, a translation of which\r\nis herewith inclosed. In this the President of Nicaragua says:\r\n\r\n  My desire was carried to the utmost on seeing in your message at\r\n  the opening of the Twenty-ninth Congress of your Republic a sincere\r\n  profession of political faith in all respects conformable with the\r\n  principles professed by these States, determined, as they are, to\r\n  sustain with firmness the continental cause, the rights of Americans in\r\n  general, and the noninterference of European powers in their concerns.\r\n\r\nThis letter announces the critical situation in which Nicaragua was\r\nplaced and charges upon the Court of St. James a \"well-known design to\r\nestablish colonies on the coast of Nicaragua and to render itself master\r\nof the interoceanic canal, for which so many facilities are presented by\r\nthe isthmus in that State.\" No reply was made to this letter.\r\n\r\nThe British ships of war _Alarm_ and _Vixen_ arrived at San Juan de\r\nNicaragua on the 8th day of February, 1848, and on the 12th of that\r\nmonth the British forces, consisting of 260 officers and men, attacked\r\nand captured the post of Serapaqui, garrisoned, according to the British\r\nstatements, by about 200 soldiers, after a sharp action of one hour and\r\nforty minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of March, 1848, articles of agreement were concluded by\r\nCaptain Locke, on the part of Great Britain, with the commissioners of\r\nthe State of Nicaragua in the island of Cuba, in the Lake of Nicaragua,\r\na copy of which will be found in the correspondence relating to the\r\nMosquito Territory presented to and published by the House of Commons of\r\nGreat Britain on the 3d day of July, 1848, herewith submitted. A copy of\r\nthe same document will also be found accompanying the note of the\r\nminister for foreign affairs of Nicaragua to the Secretary of State of\r\nthe United States under date the 17th March, 1848.\r\n\r\nBy the third article of the agreement it is provided that Nicaragua\r\n\"shall not disturb the inhabitants of San Juan, understanding that any\r\nsuch act will be considered by Great Britain as a declaration of open\r\nhostilities.\" By the sixth article it is provided that these articles of\r\nagreement will not \"hinder Nicaragua from soliciting by means of a\r\ncommissioner to Her Britannic Majesty a final arrangement of these\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe communication from Señor Sebastian Salinas, the secretary of foreign\r\naffairs of the State of Nicaragua, to Mr. Buchanan, the Secretary of\r\nState of the United States, dated 17th March, 1848, a translation of\r\nwhich is herewith submitted, recites the aggressions of Great Britain\r\nand the seizure of a part of the Nicaraguan territory in the name of the\r\nMosquito King. No answer appears to have been given to this letter.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th day of October, 1847, Joseph W. Livingston was appointed by\r\nthis Government consul of the United States for the port of San Juan de\r\nNicaragua. On the 16th day of December, 1847, after having received his\r\nexequatur from the Nicaraguan Government, he addressed a letter to Mr.\r\nBuchanan, Secretary of State, a copy of which is herewith submitted,\r\nrepresenting that he had been informed that the English Government would\r\ntake possession of San Juan de Nicaragua in January, 1848.\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated the 8th of April, 1848, Mr. Livingston states\r\nthat \"at the request of the minister for foreign affairs of Nicaragua\r\nhe transmits a package of papers containing the correspondence relative\r\nto the occupation of the port of San Juan by British forces in the name\r\nof the Mosquito nation.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of June, 1848, Elijah Hise, being appointed chargé\r\nd'affaires of the United States to Guatemala, received his instructions,\r\na copy of which is herewith submitted. In these instructions the\r\nfollowing passages occur:\r\n\r\n  The independence as well as the interests of the nations on this\r\n  continent require that they should maintain the American system of\r\n  policy entirely distinct from that which prevails in Europe. To\r\n  suffer any interference on the part of the European Governments with\r\n  the domestic concerns of the American Republics and to permit them\r\n  to establish new colonies upon this continent would be to jeopard\r\n  their independence and to ruin their interests. These truths ought\r\n  everywhere throughout this continent to be impressed on the public\r\n  mind. But what can the United States do to resist such European\r\n  interference whilst the Spanish American Republics continue to weaken\r\n  themselves by division and civil war and deprive themselves of the\r\n  ability of doing anything for their own protection?\r\n\r\nThis last significant inquiry seems plainly to intimate that the United\r\nStates could do nothing to arrest British aggression while the Spanish\r\nAmerican Republics continue to weaken themselves by division and civil\r\nwar and deprive themselves of the ability of doing anything for their\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThese instructions, which also state the dissolution of the Central\r\nAmerican Republic, formerly composed of the five States of Nicaragua,\r\nCosta Rica, Honduras, San Salvador, and Guatemala, and their continued\r\nseparation, authorize Mr. Hise to conclude treaties of commerce with the\r\nRepublics of Guatemala and San Salvador, but conclude with saying that\r\nit was not deemed advisable to empower Mr. Hise to conclude a treaty\r\nwith either Nicaragua, Honduras, or Costa Rica until more full and\r\nstatistical information should have been communicated by him to the\r\nDepartment in regard to those States than that which it possesses.\r\n\r\nThe States of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras are the only Central\r\nAmerican States whose consent or cooperation would in any event be\r\nnecessary for the construction of the ship canal contemplated between\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic oceans by the way of Lake Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the sixth article of the agreement of the 7th of March,\r\n1848, between the forces of Great Britain and the authorities of\r\nNicaragua, Señor Francisco Castillon was appointed commissioner from\r\nNicaragua to Great Britain, and on the 5th day of November, 1848, while\r\nat Washington on his way to London, addressed a letter to the Secretary\r\nof State, a translation of which is herewith submitted, asking this\r\nGovernment to instruct its minister plenipotentiary residing in London\r\nto sustain the right of Nicaragua to her territory claimed by Mosquito,\r\nand especially to the port of San Juan, expressing the hope of Nicaragua\r\n\"that the Government of the Union, firmly adhering to its principle of\r\nresisting all foreign intervention in America, would not hesitate to\r\norder such steps to be taken as might be effective before things reached\r\na point in which the intervention of the United States would prove of no\r\navail.\"\r\n\r\nTo this letter also no answer appears to have been returned, and no\r\ninstructions were given to our minister in London in pursuance of the\r\nrequest contained in it.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of March, 1847, Christopher Hempstead was appointed consul\r\nat Belize, and an application was then made for his exequatur through\r\nour minister in London, Mr. Bancroft. Lord Palmerston referred Mr.\r\nBancroft's application for an exequatur for Mr. Hempstead to the\r\ncolonial office. The exequatur was granted, and Mr. Hempstead, in a\r\nletter to the Department of State bearing date the 12th day of February,\r\n1848, a copy of which is herewith submitted, acknowledged the receipt of\r\nhis exequatur from Her Britannic Majesty, by virtue of which he has\r\ndischarged his consular functions. Thus far this Government has\r\nrecognized the existence of a British colony at Belize, within the\r\nterritory of Honduras. I have recalled the consul, and have appointed no\r\none to supply his place.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th day of May, 1848, Mr. Hempstead represented in a letter to\r\nthe Department of State that the Indians had \"applied to Her Majesty's\r\nsuperintendent at Belize for protection, and had desired him to take\r\npossession of the territory which they occupied and take them under his\r\nprotection as British subjects;\" and he added that in the event of the\r\nsuccess of their application \"the British Government would then have\r\npossession of the entire coast from Cape Conte to San Juan de\r\nNicaragua.\" In another letter, dated the 29th day of July, 1848, he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  I have not a doubt but the designs of Her Majesty's officers here and\r\n  on the Mosquito shore are to obtain territory on this continent.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of this letter was regularly acknowledged on the 29th day of\r\nAugust, 1848.\r\n\r\nWhen I came into office I found the British Government in possession of\r\nthe port of San Juan, which it had taken by force of arms after we had\r\ntaken possession of California and while we were engaged in the\r\nnegotiation of a treaty for the cession of it, and that no official\r\nremonstrance had been made by this Government against the aggression,\r\nnor any attempt to resist it. Efforts were then being made by certain\r\nprivate citizens of the United States to procure from the State of\r\nNicaragua by contract the right to cut the proposed ship canal by the\r\nway of the river San Juan and the lakes of Nicaragua and Managua to\r\nRealejo, on the Pacific Ocean. A company of American citizens entered\r\ninto such a contract with the State of Nicaragua. Viewing the canal as a\r\nmatter of great importance to the people of the United States, I\r\nresolved to adopt the policy of protecting the work and binding the\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua, through whose territory it would pass, also to\r\nprotect it. The instructions to E. George Squier, appointed by me chargé\r\nd'affaires to Guatemala on the 2d day of April, 1849, are herewith\r\nsubmitted, as fully indicating the views which governed me in directing\r\na treaty to be made with Nicaragua. I considered the interference of the\r\nBritish Government on this continent in seizing the port of San Juan,\r\nwhich commanded the route believed to be the most eligible for the canal\r\nacross the Isthmus, and occupying it at the very moment when it was\r\nknown, as I believe, to Great Britain that we were engaged in the\r\nnegotiation for the purchase of California, as an unfortunate\r\ncoincidence, and one calculated to lead to the inference that she\r\nentertained designs by no means in harmony with the interests of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Mr. Hise had been positively instructed to make no treaty,\r\nnot even a treaty of commerce, with Nicaragua, Costa Rica, or Honduras,\r\nI had no suspicion that he would attempt to act in opposition to his\r\ninstructions, and in September last I was for the first time informed\r\nthat he had actually negotiated two treaties with the State of\r\nNicaragua, the one a treaty of commerce, the other a treaty for the\r\nconstruction of the proposed ship canal, which treaties he brought with\r\nhim on his return home. He also negotiated a treaty of commerce with\r\nHonduras; and in each of these treaties it is recited that he had full\r\npowers for the purpose. He had no such powers, and the whole proceeding\r\non his part with reference to those States was not only unauthorized by\r\ninstructions, but in opposition to those he had received from my\r\npredecessor and after the date of his letter of recall and the\r\nappointment of his successor. But I have no evidence that Mr. Hise,\r\nwhose letter of recall (a copy of which is herewith submitted) bears\r\ndate the 2d day of May, 1849, had received that letter on the 21st day\r\nof June, when he negotiated the treaty with Nicaragua. The difficulty of\r\ncommunicating with him was so great that I have reason to believe he had\r\nnot received it. He did not acknowledge it.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth article of the treaty negotiated by Mr. Hise in effect\r\nguarantees the perfect independence of the State of Nicaragua and her\r\nsovereignty over her alleged limits from the Caribbean Sea to the\r\nPacific Ocean, pledging the naval and military power of the United\r\nStates to support it. This treaty authorizes the chartering of a\r\ncorporation by this Government to cut a canal outside of the limits of\r\nthe United States, and gives to us the exclusive right to fortify and\r\ncommand it. I have not approved it, nor have I now submitted it for\r\nratification; not merely because of the facts already mentioned, but\r\nbecause on the 31st day of December last Señor Edwardo Carcache, on\r\nbeing accredited to this Government as chargé d'affaires from the State\r\nof Nicaragua, in a note to the Secretary of State, a translation of\r\nwhich is herewith sent, declared that he was \"only empowered to exchange\r\nratifications of the treaty concluded with Mr. Squier, and that the\r\nspecial convention concluded at Guatemala by Mr. Hise, the chargé\r\nd'affaires of the United States, and Señor Selva, the commissioner of\r\nNicaragua, had been, as was publicly and universally known, disapproved\r\nby his Government.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no precedent in our history to justify such a treaty as that\r\nnegotiated by Mr. Hise since the guaranties we gave to France of her\r\nAmerican possessions. The treaty negotiated with New Granada on the 12th\r\nday of December, 1846, did not guarantee the sovereignty of New Granada\r\non the whole of her territory, but only over \"the single Province of the\r\nIsthmus of Panama,\" immediately adjoining the line of the railroad, the\r\nneutrality of which was deemed necessary by the President and Senate to\r\nthe construction and security of the work.\r\n\r\nThe thirty-fifth article of the treaty with Nicaragua, negotiated by Mr.\r\nSquier, which is submitted for your advice in regard to its\r\nratification, distinctly recognizes the rights of sovereignty and\r\nproperty which the State of Nicaragua possesses in and over the line of\r\nthe canal therein provided for. If the Senate doubt on that subject, it\r\nwill be clearly wrong to involve us in a controversy with England by\r\nadopting the treaty; but after the best consideration which I have been\r\nable to give to the subject my own judgment is convinced that the claims\r\nof Nicaragua are just, and that as our commerce and intercourse with the\r\nPacific require the opening of this communication from ocean to ocean it\r\nis our duty to ourselves to assert their justice.\r\n\r\nThis treaty is not intended to secure to the United States any monopoly\r\nor exclusive advantage in the use of the canal. Its object is to\r\nguarantee protection to American citizens and others who shall construct\r\nthe canal, and to defend it when completed against unjust confiscations\r\nor obstructions, and to deny the advantages of navigation through it to\r\nthose nations only which shall refuse to enter into the same guaranties.\r\nA copy of the contract of the canal company is herewith transmitted,\r\nfrom which, as well as from the treaty, it will be perceived that the\r\nsame benefits are offered to all nations in the same terms.\r\n\r\nThe message of my predecessor to the Senate of the 10th February, 1847,\r\ntransmitting for ratification the treaty with New Granada, contains in\r\ngeneral the principles by which I have been actuated in directing the\r\nnegotiation with Nicaragua. The only difference between the two cases\r\nconsists in this: In that of Nicaragua the British Government has seized\r\nupon part of her territory and was in possession of it when we\r\nnegotiated the treaty with her. But that possession was taken after our\r\noccupation of California, when the effect of it was to obstruct or\r\ncontrol the most eligible route for a ship communication to the\r\nterritories acquired by us on the Pacific. In the case of New Granada,\r\nher possession was undisturbed at the time of the treaty, though the\r\nBritish possession in the right of the Mosquito King was then extended\r\ninto the territories claimed by New Granada as far as Boca del Toro. The\r\nprofessed objects of both the treaties are to open communications across\r\nthe Isthmus to all nations and to invite their guaranties on the same\r\nterms. Neither of them proposes to guarantee territory to a foreign\r\nnation in which the United States will not have a common interest with\r\nthat nation. Neither of them constitutes an alliance for any political\r\nobject, but for a purely commercial purpose, in which all the navigating\r\nnations of the world have a common interest. Nicaragua, like New\r\nGranada, is a power which will not excite the jealousy of any nation.\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing narrow, selfish, illiberal, or exclusive in the\r\nviews of the United States as set forth in this treaty, as it is\r\nindispensable to the successful completion of the contemplated canal to\r\nsecure protection to it from the local authorities and this Government,\r\nand as I have no doubt that the British pretension to the port of San\r\nJuan in right of the Mosquito King is without just foundation in any\r\npublic law ever before recognized in any other instance by Americans or\r\nEnglishmen as applicable to Indian titles on this continent, I shall\r\nratify this treaty in case the Senate shall advise that course. Its\r\nprincipal defect is taken from the treaty with New Granada, the\r\nnegotiator having made it liable to be abrogated on notice after twenty\r\nyears. Both treaties should have been perpetual or limited only by the\r\nduration of the improvements they were intended to protect. The\r\ninstructions to our chargé d'affaires, it will be seen, prescribe no\r\nlimitation for the continuance of the treaty with Nicaragua. Should the\r\nSenate approve of principle of the treaty, an amendment in this respect\r\nis deemed advisable; and it will be well to invite by another amendment\r\nthe protection of other nations, by expressly offering them in the\r\ntreaty what is now offered by implication only--the same advantages\r\nwhich we propose for ourselves on the same conditions upon which we\r\nshall have acquired them. The policy of this treaty is not novel, nor\r\ndoes it originate from any suggestion either of my immediate predecessor\r\nor myself. On the 3d day of March, 1835, the following resolution,\r\nreferred to by the late President in his message to the Senate relative\r\nto the treaty with New Granada, was adopted in executive session by the\r\nSenate without division:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President of the United States be respectfully\r\n  requested to consider the expediency of opening negotiations with the\r\n  Governments of Central America and New Granada for the purpose of\r\n  effectually protecting, by suitable treaty stipulations with them,\r\n  such individuals or companies as may undertake to open a communication\r\n  between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the construction of a ship\r\n  canal across the isthmus which connects North and South America, and\r\n  of securing forever by such stipulations the free and equal rights\r\n  of navigating such a canal to all such nations on the payment of such\r\n  reasonable tolls as may be established to compensate the capitalists\r\n  who may engage in such undertaking and complete the work.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson accorded with the policy suggested in this resolution,\r\nand in pursuance of it sent Charles Biddle as agent to negotiate with\r\nthe Governments of Central America and New Granada. The result is fully\r\nset forth in the report of a select committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 20th of February, 1849, upon a joint resolution\r\nof Congress to authorize the survey of certain routes for a canal or\r\nrailroad between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The policy indicated\r\nin the resolution of the 3d March, 1835, then adopted by the President\r\nand Senate, is that now proposed for the consideration and sanction of\r\nthe Senate. So far as my knowledge extends, such has ever been the\r\nliberal policy of the leading statesmen of this country, and by no one\r\nhas it been more earnestly recommended than by my lamented predecessor.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 26, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit, for the information of Congress, a copy of the\r\nreport[4a] of Thomas Butler King, esq., appointed bearer of dispatches\r\nand special agent to California, made in pursuance of instructions\r\nissued from the Department of State on the 3d day of April last.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4a: On California affairs.]\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 28, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 22d instant,\r\nrequesting the President of the United States to communicate to that\r\nbody a copy of the instructions given to the agent of the United States\r\nwho was employed to visit Hungary during the recent war between that\r\ncountry and Austria, and of the correspondence by and with such agent,\r\nso far as the publication of the same may be consistent with the public\r\ninterest, I herewith transmit to the Senate a copy of the instructions\r\nto A. Dudley Mann, esq., relating to Hungary, he having been appointed\r\nby me special agent to that country on the 18th day of June last,\r\ntogether with a copy of the correspondence with our late chargé\r\nd'affaires to Austria referred to in those instructions and of other\r\npapers disclosing the policy of this Government in reference to Hungary\r\nand her people. I also transmit, in compliance with the resolution of\r\nthe Senate, but in a separate packet, a copy of the correspondence of\r\nMr. Mann with the Department of State. The latter I have caused to be\r\nmarked \"_executive_\"--the information contained in it being such as will\r\nbe found on examination most appropriately to belong to the Senate in\r\nthe exercise of its executive functions. The publication of this\r\ncorrespondence of the agent sent by me to Hungary is a matter referred\r\nentirely to the judgment and discretion of the Senate.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the documents now transmitted that no minister or\r\nagent was accredited by the Government of Hungary to this Government at\r\nany period since I came into office, nor was any communication ever\r\nreceived by this Government from the minister of foreign affairs of\r\nHungary or any other executive officer authorized to act in her behalf.\r\n\r\nMy purpose, as freely avowed in this correspondence, was to have\r\nacknowledged the independence of Hungary had she succeeded in\r\nestablishing a government _de facto_ on a basis sufficiently permanent\r\nin its character to have justified me in doing so according to the\r\nusages and settled principles of this Government; and although she is\r\nnow fallen and many of her gallant patriots are in exile or in chains, I\r\nam free still to declare that had she been successful in the\r\nmaintenance of such a government as we could have recognized we should\r\nhave been the first to welcome her into the family of nations.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 3, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit a translation of a note, under date the 20th of last month,\r\naddressed to the Secretary of State by the minister of the Mexican\r\nRepublic accredited to this Government, expressing the views of that\r\nGovernment with reference to the control of the wild Indians of the\r\nUnited States on the frontier of Mexico, as stipulated for in the\r\neleventh article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 22, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate, for their advice with regard to its\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and Great Britain,\r\nconcluded at Washington on the 19th instant by John M. Clayton,\r\nSecretary of State, on the part of the United States, and by the Right\r\nHon. Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer, on the part of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThis treaty has been negotiated in accordance with the general views\r\nexpressed in my message to Congress in December last. Its object is to\r\nestablish a commercial alliance with all great maritime states for the\r\nprotection of a contemplated ship canal through the territory of\r\nNicaragua to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and at the same\r\ntime to insure the same protection to the contemplated railways or\r\ncanals by the Tehuantepec and Panama routes, as well as to every other\r\ninteroceanic communication which may be adopted to shorten the transit\r\nto or from our territories on the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this treaty does not propose to take money from the\r\npublic Treasury to effect any object contemplated by it. It yields\r\nprotection to the capitalists who may undertake to construct any canal\r\nor railway across the Isthmus, commencing in the southern part of Mexico\r\nand terminating in the territory of New Granada. It gives no preference\r\nto any one route over another, but proposes the same measure of\r\nprotection for all which ingenuity and enterprise can construct. Should\r\nthis treaty be ratified, it will secure in future the liberation of all\r\nCentral America from any kind of foreign aggression.\r\n\r\nAt the time negotiations were opened with Nicaragua for the construction\r\nof a canal through her territory I found Great Britain in possession of\r\nnearly half of Central America, as the ally and protector of the\r\nMosquito King. It has been my object in negotiating this treaty not only\r\nto secure the passage across the Isthmus to the Government and citizens\r\nof the United States by the construction of a great highway dedicated to\r\nthe use of all nations on equal terms, but to maintain the independence\r\nand sovereignty of all the Central American Republics. The Senate will\r\njudge how far these objects have been effected.\r\n\r\nIf there be any who would desire to seize and annex any portion of the\r\nterritories of these weak sister republics to the American Union, or to\r\nextend our dominion over them, I do not concur in their policy; and I\r\nwish it to be understood in reference to that subject that I adopt the\r\nviews entertained, so far as I know, by all my predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe principles by which I have been regulated in the negotiation of this\r\ntreaty are in accordance with the sentiments well expressed by my\r\nimmediate predecessor on the 10th of February, 1847, when he\r\ncommunicated to the Senate the treaty with New Granada for the\r\nprotection of the railroad at Panama. It is in accordance with the whole\r\nspirit of the resolution of the Senate of the 3d of March, 1835,\r\nreferred to by President Polk, and with the policy adopted by President\r\nJackson immediately after the passage of that resolution, who dispatched\r\nan agent to Central America and New Granada \"to open negotiations with\r\nthose Governments for the purpose of effectually protecting, by suitable\r\ntreaty stipulations with them, such individuals or companies as might\r\nundertake to open a communication between the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans by the construction of a ship canal across the isthmus which\r\nconnects North and South America, and of securing forever by such\r\nstipulations the free and equal right of navigating such canal to all\r\nsuch nations on the payment of such reasonable tolls as might be\r\nestablished to compensate the capitalists who should engage in such\r\nundertaking and complete the work.\"\r\n\r\nI also communicate herewith a copy of the correspondence between the\r\nAmerican Secretary of State and the British plenipotentiary at the time\r\nof concluding the treaty. Whatever honor may be due to the party first\r\nproposing such a treaty justly belongs to the United States. My\r\npredecessor, in his message of the 10th of February, 1847, referring to\r\nthe treaty with New Granada for the protection of the Panama Railroad,\r\nobserves that--\r\n\r\n   Should the proposition thus tendered be rejected we may deprive the\r\nUnited States of the just influence which its acceptance might secure to\r\nthem, and confer the glory and benefits of being the first among the\r\nnations in concluding such an arrangement upon the Government either of\r\nGreat Britain or France. That either of these Governments would embrace\r\nthe offer can not be doubted, because there does not appear to be any\r\nother effectual means of securing to all nations the advantages of this\r\nimportant passage but the guaranty of great commercial powers that the\r\nIsthmus shall be neutral territory. The interests of the world at stake\r\nare so important that the security of this passage between the two\r\noceans can not be suffered to depend upon the wars and revolutions which\r\nmay arise among different nations.\r\n\r\nShould the Senate in its wisdom see fit to confirm this treaty, and the\r\ntreaty heretofore submitted by me for their advice in regard to its\r\nratification, negotiated with the State of Nicaragua on the 3d day of\r\nSeptember last, it will be necessary to amend one or both of them, so\r\nthat both treaties may stand in conformity with each other in their\r\nspirit and intention. The Senate will discover by examining them both\r\nthat this is a task of no great difficulty.\r\n\r\nI have good reason to believe that France and Russia stand ready to\r\naccede to this treaty, and that no other great maritime state will\r\nrefuse its accession to an arrangement so well calculated to diffuse the\r\nblessings of peace, commerce, and civilization, and so honorable to all\r\nnations which may enter into the engagement.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 6, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a consular convention between the United States and the\r\nRepublic of New Granada, signed in this city on the 4th of this month by\r\nthe Secretary of State on the part of the United States, and by Señor\r\nDon Rafael Rivas, chargé d'affaires of New Granada, on the part of that\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 7, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives copies of a\r\ncorrespondence between the Department of State and the British legation\r\nin this city, relative to the reciprocal admission of the natural\r\nproducts of the United States and Canada free of duty into the\r\nterritories of both countries. It will be seen by the accompanying\r\ndocuments that the late Secretary of the Treasury recommended, in his\r\ncorrespondence with the Committee on Commerce in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, reciprocal free trade in the natural products of the\r\nUnited States and Canada; that in March and June, 1849, a correspondence\r\nwas opened between the British chargé d'affaires then residing in\r\nWashington and the Secretary of State upon the subject of a commercial\r\nconvention or treaty to carry out the views of Her Majesty's Government\r\nin relation thereto, and that the proposition for such a convention or\r\ntreaty was declined on the part of the American Government for reasons\r\nwhich are fully set forth in the note of the Secretary of State to Mr.\r\nCrampton of the 26th of June last. During the negotiations connected\r\nwith this correspondence, not considering the markets of Canada as an\r\nequivalent for those of the United States, I directed the Secretary of\r\nState to inquire what other benefits of trade and commerce would be\r\nyielded by the British authorities in connection with such a measure,\r\nand particularly whether the free navigation of the St. Lawrence would\r\nbe conceded to us. That subject has accordingly been presented to the\r\nBritish Government, and the result was communicated by Her Majesty's\r\nminister in Washington on the 27th of March last in reply to a note from\r\nthe Secretary of State of the 26th of that month. From these papers it\r\nwill be perceived that the navigation of the St. Lawrence and of the\r\ncanals connecting it with the Western lakes will be opened to the\r\ncitizens of the United States in the event that the bill referred to in\r\nthe correspondence, providing for the admission of their natural\r\nproducts, should become a law. The whole subject is now submitted to the\r\nconsideration of Congress, and especially whether the concession\r\nproposed by Great Britain is an equivalent for the reciprocity desired\r\nby her.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 8, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nWith reference to the convention between the United States and Her\r\nBritannic Majesty relative to interoceanic communication by the way of\r\nNicaragua, recently submitted to the Senate, I transmit a copy of a\r\nnote, under date the 29th ultimo, addressed to the Secretary of State by\r\nSir Henry L. Bulwer, Her Britannic Majesty's minister here, and of Mr.\r\nClayton's reply, under date the 30th ultimo. Intelligence received from\r\nthe chargé d'affaires of the United States in Central America and from\r\nother quarters having led to an apprehension that Mr. Chatfield, Her\r\nBritannic Majesty's minister in that country, had concluded a treaty\r\nwith the Government of Costa Rica placing that State under the\r\nprotection of the British Government, I deemed it my duty to cause\r\ninquiries upon the subject to be addressed to Her Majesty's Government\r\nthrough Sir Henry L. Bulwer. The note of that functionary communicates\r\nthe answer to those inquiries, and may be deemed satisfactory, both from\r\nthe denial of the fact that any such treaty has been concluded and from\r\nits positive disavowal on behalf of the British Government of the policy\r\nintended to be subserved by such treaties.\r\n\r\nZ. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 18, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report of the\r\nSecretary of State, with accompanying papers,[5a] in answer to its\r\nresolution of the 28th of March last.\r\n\r\nZ.

TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 22, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate reports of the several heads of\r\nDepartments, to whom were referred the resolutions of the Senate of the\r\n9th instant, \"requesting the President of the United States to furnish\r\nto the Senate copies of all correspondence between any of the Executive\r\nDepartments and General Persifor F.

The Spanish\r\nGovernment having refused to recognize Mr. Sewall as consul for that\r\nport, I now withdraw that nomination and nominate William N.

TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 3, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate herewith reports from the several heads of\r\nDepartments, which contain all the information in possession of the\r\nExecutive relative to the subject of the resolution of the 23d instant\r\n[ultimo].\r\n\r\nNo information has been received establishing the existence of any\r\nrevolutionary movement in the island of Cuba among the inhabitants of\r\nthat island. The correspondence submitted discloses, however, the fact\r\nthat repeated attempts have been made under the direction of foreigners\r\nenjoying the hospitality of this country to get up armed expeditions in\r\nthe United States for the purpose of invading Cuba. It will be seen by\r\nthat correspondence that this Government has been faithful in the\r\ndischarge of its treaty obligations with Spain and in the execution of\r\nthe acts of Congress which have for their object the maintenance in this\r\nregard of the peace and honor of this country.\r\n\r\nZ.

TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 17, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI have received a copy of the resolution of the Senate of the 11th June\r\ninstant, requesting me \"to inform the Senate whether any orders have\r\nbeen issued to any military officer or officers at Santa Fe to hold\r\npossession against the authority of Texas, or in any way to embarrass or\r\nprevent the exercise of her jurisdiction over that country, and to\r\nfurnish the Senate with copies of any correspondence which may have\r\ntaken place between the War Department and the military stationed at\r\nSanta Fe since the date of my last communication to the Senate on that\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to that resolution I state that no such orders have been given.\r\n\r\nI herewith present to the Senate copies of all the correspondence\r\nreferred to in the resolution. All the other orders relating to the\r\nsubject-matter of the resolution have been heretofore communicated to\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nI have already, in a former message, referred to the fact that the\r\nboundary between Texas and New Mexico is disputed. I have now to state\r\nthat information has been recently received that a certain Robert S.\r\nNeighbors, styling himself commissioner of the State of Texas, has\r\nproceeded to Santa Fe with a view of organizing counties in that\r\ndistrict under the authority of Texas. While I have no power to decide\r\nthe question of boundary, and no desire to interfere with it, as a\r\nquestion of title, I have to observe that the possession of the\r\nterritory into which it appears that Mr. Neighbors has thus gone was\r\nactually acquired by the United States from Mexico, and has since been\r\nheld by the United States, and, in my opinion, ought so to remain until\r\nthe question of boundary shall have been determined by some competent\r\nauthority. Meanwhile, I think there is no reason for seriously\r\napprehending that Texas will practically interfere with the possession\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nZ.

The following order of the President of the United States announces\r\nto the Army the lamented death of the illustrious General Zachary\r\nTaylor, late President of the United States:\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _July 11, 1850_.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States with profound sorrow announces to the\r\nArmy, the Navy, and Marine Corps the death of Zachary Taylor, late\r\nPresident of the United States. He died at the Executive Mansion on the\r\nnight of the 9th instant at half-past 10 o'clock.\r\n\r\nHis last public appearance was in participating in the ceremonies of our\r\nnational anniversary at the base of the monument now rearing to the\r\nmemory of Washington. His last official act was to affix his signature\r\nto the convention recently concluded between the United States and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe vigor of a constitution strong by nature and confirmed by active and\r\ntemperate habits had in later years become impaired by the arduous toils\r\nand exposures of his military life.\r\n\r\nSolely engrossed in maintaining the honor and advancing the glory of his\r\ncountry, in a career of forty years in the Army of the United States he\r\nrendered himself signal and illustrious. An unbroken current of success\r\nand victory, terminated by an achievement unsurpassed in our annals,\r\nleft nothing to be accomplished for his military fame.\r\n\r\nHis conduct and courage gave him this career of unexampled fortune, and\r\nwith the crowning virtues of moderation and humanity under all\r\ncircumstances, and especially in the moment of victory, revealed to his\r\ncountrymen those great and good qualities which induced them unsolicited\r\nto call him from his high military command to the highest civil office\r\nof honor and trust in the Republic; not that he desired to be first, but\r\nthat he was felt to be worthiest.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of his character, the singleness of his purpose, the\r\nelevation and patriotism of his principles, his moral courage, his\r\njustice, magnanimity and benevolence, his wisdom, moderation, and power\r\nof command, while they have endeared him to the heart of the nation, add\r\nto the deep sense of the national calamity in the loss of a Chief\r\nMagistrate whom death itself could not appall in the consciousness of\r\n\"having always done his duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Army, of the Navy, and Marine Corps will, as a\r\nmanifestation of their respect for the exalted character and eminent\r\npublic services of the illustrious dead, and of their sense of the\r\ncalamity the country has sustained by this afflicting dispensation of\r\nProvidence, wear crape on the left arm and upon the hilt of the sword\r\nfor six months.\r\n\r\nIt is further directed that funeral honors be paid at\r\neach of the military posts according to general regulations, and at\r\nnavy-yards and on board all public vessels in commission, by firing\r\nthirty minute guns, commencing at meridian, on the day after the receipt\r\nof this order, and by wearing their flags at half-mast.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. CRAWFORD,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The day after the receipt of this general order at each military\r\npost the troops will be paraded at 10 o'clock a.m. and the order read to\r\nthem, after which all labors for the day will cease.\r\n\r\nThe national flag will be displayed at half-staff.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of day thirteen guns will be fired, and afterwards at intervals\r\nof thirty minutes between the rising and setting sun a single gun, and\r\nat the close of the day a national salute of thirty guns.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Army will wear the badge of mourning on the left arm\r\nand on their swords and the colors of the several regiments will be put\r\nin mourning for the period of six months.\r\n\r\nBy order: R. JONES,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General._\r\n\r\n[The Secretary of the Navy made the same announcement to the Navy as\r\nthat portion of the above signed by the Secretary of War.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n[From the Daily National Intelligencer, July 12, 1850.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 10, 1850_.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the death of the President of the United States, I\r\ndirect that the several Executive Departments be closed until after the\r\nfuneral of the illustrious deceased, and that they, as well as the\r\nExecutive Mansion, be placed in mourning, and that the several officers\r\nof the Government wear the usual badge of mourning for the term of six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n[From Senate Journal, Thirty-first Congress, first session, p. 445.]\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWhereas it has pleased Divine Providence to remove from this life\r\nZachary Taylor, late President of the United States, the Senate,\r\nsharing in the general sorrow which this melancholy event must produce,\r\nis desirous of manifesting its sensibility on this occasion: Therefore\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That a committee consisting of Messrs.

He was the second son of\r\nNathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard. His ancestors served with\r\ndistinction in the French and Revolutionary wars. He attended the\r\nprimitive schools in the neighborhood three months in the year,\r\ndevoting the other nine to working on his father's farm. His father,\r\nhaving formed a distaste for farming, was desirous that his sons\r\nshould follow other occupations. Accordingly, Millard, after serving\r\nan apprenticeship for a few months, began in 1815 the business of\r\ncarding and dressing cloth. Was afterwards a school-teacher. In 1819\r\ndecided to become a lawyer, and in 1823, although he had not completed\r\nthe usual course required, was admitted as an attorney by the court of\r\ncommon pleas of Erie County.

In\r\n1830 removed to Buffalo and became a successful lawyer. His political\r\ncareer began and ended with the birth and extinction of the Whig\r\nparty. Was elected to the legislature of his State in 1828, and served\r\nthree terms; while there he was distinguished by his advocacy of the\r\nact to abolish imprisonment for debt, which passed in 1831. In 1832\r\nwas elected to Congress, and after serving one term retired till 1836,\r\nwhen he was reelected, and again returned in 1838 and 1840, declining\r\na renomination in 1842. Was the author of the tariff of 1842. He\r\nretired from Congress in 1843. Was an unsuccessful candidate for\r\nVice-President before the Whig convention at Baltimore in 1844. Was\r\nnominated by acclamation for governor of New York in the following\r\nSeptember, but was defeated by Silas Wright. In 1847 was elected\r\ncomptroller of the State. In 1848 was nominated by the Whigs for\r\nVice-President on the ticket with General Taylor and was elected in\r\nthe following November. He presided as Vice-President with strict\r\nimpartiality during exciting debates in the Senate. By the death of\r\nPresident Taylor became President July 10, 1850. Was a candidate for\r\nPresident at the Whig convention in 1852, but General Scott received\r\nthe nomination. Three weeks after the close of his Administration his\r\nwife died. Afterwards married Caroline C. McIntosh, who survived him.\r\nIn 1856, while in Rome, he was nominated for the Presidency by the\r\nAmerican (Whig) party, but was defeated by Mr. Buchanan. After his\r\nretirement from office he resided in Buffalo the remainder of his\r\nlife. He established the Buffalo Historical Society. Was called upon\r\nto welcome distinguished visitors to his city, and frequently presided\r\nover conventions and other public meetings, but held no office after\r\nretiring from the Presidency. He again visited Europe in 1866.

I am not aware of the existence of any such island\r\nin that State, and presume that the resolution refers to the island of\r\nthe same name in the Gulf of Fonseca, in the State of Honduras.\r\n\r\nThe concluding part of the resolution, requesting the President to\r\ncommunicate to the House all treaties not heretofore published which\r\nmay have been negotiated with any of the States of Central America \"by\r\nany person acting by authority of the late Administration or under the\r\nauspices of the present Administration,\" so far as it has reference to\r\ntreaties negotiated with any of those States by instructions from this\r\nGovernment, can not be complied with, inasmuch as those treaties have\r\nnot been acted upon by the Senate of the United States, and are now in\r\nthe possession of that body, to whom by the Constitution they are\r\ndirected to be transmitted for advice in regard to their ratification.\r\n\r\nBut as its communication is not liable to the same objection, I\r\ntransmit for the information of the House a copy of a treaty in regard\r\nto a ship canal across the Isthmus, negotiated by Elijah Hise, our\r\nlate chargé d'affaires in Guatemala, with the Government of Nicaragua\r\non the 21st day of June, 1849, accompanied by copies of his\r\ninstructions from and correspondence with the Department of State.\r\n\r\nI shall cheerfully comply with the request of the House of\r\nRepresentatives to lay before them the treaties negotiated with the\r\nStates of Central America, now before the Senate, whenever it shall be\r\ncompatible with the public interest to make the communication. For the\r\npresent I communicate herewith a copy of the treaty with Great Britain\r\nand of the correspondence between the American Secretary of State\r\nand the British plenipotentiary at the time it was concluded. The\r\nratifications of it were exchanged at Washington on the 4th day of\r\nJuly instant.\r\n\r\nI also transmit the report of the Secretary of State, to whom the\r\nresolution of the House was referred, and who conducted the\r\nnegotiations relative to Central America, under the direction of\r\nmy lamented predecessor.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 20, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate, with a view to its ratification, a\r\nconvention between the United States and the Mexican Republic for the\r\nextradition of fugitives from justice. This convention was negotiated\r\nunder the directions of my predecessor, and was signed this day by\r\nJohn M. Clayton, Secretary of State, on the part of the United States,\r\nand by Senor Don Luis de la Rosa, envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary of Mexico, on the part of that Republic. The length of\r\nthe boundary line between the two countries, extending, as it does,\r\nfrom the Pacific to the Gulf, renders such a convention indispensable\r\nto the maintenance of good order and the amicable relations now so\r\nhappily subsisting between the sister Republics.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 23, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration and advice as to its\r\nratification, a treaty concluded in the city of Washington on the 1st\r\nday of April, 1850, by and between Ardavan S. Loughery, commissioner\r\non the part of the United States, and delegates of the Wyandott tribe\r\nof Indians.\r\n\r\nI also lay before the Senate a letter from the Secretary of the Interior\r\nand the papers therein referred to.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 30, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate, in answer to its resolution of the\r\n5th instant, requesting the President to communicate to that body \"any\r\ninformation, if any has been received by the Government, showing that\r\nan American vessel has been recently stopped upon the high seas and\r\nsearched by a British ship of war,\" the accompanying copies of papers.\r\nThe Government has no knowledge of any alleged stopping or searching\r\non the high seas of American vessels by British ships of war except in\r\nthe cases therein mentioned. The circumstances of these cases will\r\nappear by the inclosed correspondence, taken from the files of the\r\nNavy Department. No remonstrance or complaint by the owners of these\r\nvessels has been presented to the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 2, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of\r\nWar, in answer to a resolution of the Senate passed on the 8th of July\r\nlast, calling for information in relation to the removal of Fort Polk,\r\netc. The documents accompanying the report contain all the information\r\nrequired by the resolution.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 6, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the two Houses of Congress a letter from his\r\nexcellency the governor of Texas, dated on the 14th day of June last,\r\naddressed to the late President of the United States, which, not\r\nhaving been answered by him, came to my hands on his death; and I also\r\ntransmit a copy of the answer which I have felt it to be my duty to\r\ncause to be made to that communication.\r\n\r\nCongress will perceive that the governor of Texas officially states\r\nthat by authority of the legislature of that State he dispatched a\r\nspecial commissioner with full power and instructions to extend the\r\ncivil jurisdiction of the State over the unorganized counties of El\r\nPaso, Worth, Presidio, and Santa Fe, situated on its northwestern\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to say that the commissioner had reported to him in an\r\nofficial form that the military officers employed in the service of\r\nthe United States stationed at Santa Fe interposed adversely with\r\nthe inhabitants to the fulfillment of his object in favor of the\r\nestablishment of a separate State government east of the Rio Grande,\r\nand within the rightful limits of the State of Texas. These four\r\ncounties, which Texas thus proposes to establish and organize as being\r\nwithin her own jurisdiction, extend over the whole of the territory\r\neast of the Rio Grande, which has heretofore been regarded as an\r\nessential and integral part of the department of New Mexico, and\r\nactually governed and possessed by her people until conquered and\r\nsevered from the Republic of Mexico by the American arms.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Texas has been called together by her governor\r\nfor the purpose, as is understood, of maintaining her claim to the\r\nterritory east of the Rio Grande and of establishing over it her own\r\njurisdiction and her own laws by force.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings of Texas, may well arrest the attention of all\r\nbranches of the Government of the United States, and I rejoice that\r\nthey occur while the Congress is yet in session. It is, I fear, far\r\nfrom being impossible that, in consequence of these proceedings of\r\nTexas, a crisis may be brought on which shall summon the two Houses of\r\nCongress, and still more emphatically the executive government, to an\r\nimmediate readiness for the performance of their respective duties.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution of the United States the President is constituted\r\nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the\r\nseveral States when called into the actual service of the United\r\nStates. The Constitution declares also that he shall take care that\r\nthe laws be faithfully executed and that he shall from time to time\r\ngive to the Congress information of the state of the Union.\r\n\r\nCongress has power by the Constitution to provide for calling forth\r\nthe militia to execute the laws of the Union, and suitable and\r\nappropriate acts of Congress have been passed as well for providing\r\nfor calling forth the militia as for placing other suitable and\r\nefficient means in the hands of the President to enable him to\r\ndischarge the constitutional functions of his office.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the act of the 28th of February, 1795, declares\r\nthat whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or their\r\nexecution obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be\r\nsuppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or the power\r\nvested in the marshals, the President may call forth the militia, as\r\nfar as may be necessary, to suppress such combinations and to cause\r\nthe laws to be duly executed.\r\n\r\nBy the act of March 3, 1807, it is provided that in all cases of\r\nobstruction to the laws either of the United States or any individual\r\nState or Territory, where it is lawful for the President to call forth\r\nthe militia for the purpose of causing the laws to be duly executed,\r\nit shall be lawful for him to employ for the same purposes such part\r\nof the land or naval force of the United States as shall be judged\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThese several enactments are now in full force, so that if the laws of\r\nthe United States are opposed or obstructed in any State or Territory\r\nby combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the judicial or civil\r\nauthorities it becomes a case in which it is the duty of the President\r\neither to call out the militia or to employ the military and naval\r\nforce of the United States, or to do both if in his judgment the\r\nexigency of the occasion shall so require, for the purpose of\r\nsuppressing such combinations. The constitutional duty of the\r\nPresident is plain and peremptory and the authority vested in him by\r\nlaw for its performance clear and ample.\r\n\r\nTexas is a State, authorized to maintain her own laws so far as they\r\nare not repugnant to the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the\r\nUnited States; to suppress insurrections against her authority, and to\r\npunish those who may commit treason against the State according to the\r\nforms provided by her own constitution and her own laws.\r\n\r\nBut all this power is local and confined entirely within the limits\r\nof Texas herself. She can possibly confer no authority which can be\r\nlawfully exercised beyond her own boundaries.\r\n\r\nAll this is plain, and hardly needs argument or elucidation. If Texas\r\nmilitia, therefore, march into any one of the other States or into any\r\nTerritory of the United States, there to execute or enforce any law of\r\nTexas, they become at that moment trespassers; they are no longer\r\nunder the protection of any lawful authority, and are to be regarded\r\nmerely as intruders; and if within such State or Territory they\r\nobstruct any law of the United States, either by power of arms or mere\r\npower of numbers, constituting such a combination as is too powerful\r\nto be suppressed by the civil authority, the President of the United\r\nStates has no option left to him, but is bound to obey the solemn\r\ninjunction of the Constitution and exercise the high powers vested in\r\nhim by that instrument and by the acts of Congress.\r\n\r\nOr if any civil posse, armed or unarmed, enter into any Territory of\r\nthe United States, under the protection of the laws thereof, with\r\nintent to seize individuals, to be carried elsewhere for trial for\r\nalleged offenses, and this posse be too powerful to be resisted by the\r\nlocal civil authorities, such seizure or attempt to seize is to be\r\nprevented or resisted by the authority of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe grave and important question now arises whether there be in\r\nthe Territory of New Mexico any existing law of the United States\r\nopposition to which or the obstruction of which would constitute a\r\ncase calling for the interposition of the authority vested in the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States declares that--\r\n\r\n  This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be\r\n  made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be\r\n  made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme\r\n  law of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, New Mexico be a Territory of the United States, and if\r\nany treaty stipulation be in force therein, such treaty stipulation\r\nis the supreme law of the land, and is to be maintained and upheld\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the letter to the governor of Texas my reasons are given for\r\nbelieving that New Mexico is now a Territory of the United States,\r\nwith the same extent and the same boundaries which belonged to it\r\nwhile in the actual possession of the Republic of Mexico, and before\r\nthe late war. In the early part of that war both California and New\r\nMexico were conquered by the arms of the United States, and were\r\nin the military possession of the United States at the date of the\r\ntreaty of peace.\r\n\r\nBy that treaty the title by conquest was confirmed and these\r\nterritories, provinces, or departments separated from Mexico forever,\r\nand by the same treaty certain important rights and securities were\r\nsolemnly guaranteed to the inhabitants residing therein.\r\n\r\nBy the fifth article of the treaty it is declared that--\r\n\r\n  The boundary line between the two Republics shall commence in the Gulf\r\n  of Mexico 3 leagues from land, opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande,\r\n  otherwise called Rio Bravo del Norte, or opposite the mouth of its\r\n  deepest branch if it should have more than one branch emptying\r\n  directly into the sea; from thence up the middle of that river,\r\n  following the deepest channel where it has more than one, to the point\r\n  where it strikes the southern boundary of New Mexico; thence\r\n  westwardly, along the whole southern boundary of New Mexico (which\r\n  runs north of the town called Paso) to its western termination; thence\r\n  northward along the western line of New Mexico until it intersects the\r\n  first branch of the river Gila (or, if it should not intersect any\r\n  branch of that river, then to the point on the said line nearest to\r\n  such branch, and thence in a direct line to the same); thence down the\r\n  middle of the said branch and of the said river until it empties into\r\n  the Rio Colorado; thence across the Rio Colorado, following the\r\n  division line between Upper and Lower California, to the Pacific\r\n  Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighth article of the treaty is in the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Mexicans now established in territories previously belonging to\r\n  Mexico, and which remain for the future within the limits of the\r\n  United States as defined by the present treaty, shall be free to\r\n  continue where they now reside or to remove at any time to the Mexican\r\n  Republic, retaining the property which they possess in the said\r\n  territories, or disposing thereof and removing the proceeds wherever\r\n  they please without their being subjected on this account to any\r\n  contribution, tax, or charge whatever.\r\n\r\n  Those who shall prefer to remain in the said territories may either\r\n  retain the title, and rights of Mexican citizens or acquire those of\r\n  citizens of the United States; but they shall be under the obligation\r\n  to make their election within one year from the date of the exchange\r\n  of ratifications of this treaty; and those who shall remain in the\r\n  said territories after the expiration of that year without having\r\n  declared their intention to retain the character of Mexicans shall be\r\n  considered to have elected to become citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n  In the said territories property of every kind now belonging to\r\n  Mexicans not established there shall be inviolably respected. The\r\n  present owners, the heirs of these, and all Mexicans who may hereafter\r\n  acquire said property by contract shall enjoy with respect to it\r\n  guaranties equally ample as if the same belonged to citizens of the\r\n  United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ninth article of the treaty is in these words:\r\n\r\n  The Mexicans who, in the territories aforesaid, shall not preserve the\r\n  character of citizens of the Mexican Republic, conformably with what\r\n  is stipulated in the preceding article, shall be incorporated into the\r\n  Union of the United States and be admitted at the proper time (to be\r\n  judged of by the Congress of the United States) to the enjoyment of\r\n  all the rights of citizens of the United States according to the\r\n  principles of the Constitution, and in the meantime shall be\r\n  maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and\r\n  property and secured in the free exercise of their religion without\r\n  restriction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is plain, therefore, on the face of these treaty stipulations that\r\nall Mexicans established in territories north or east of the line of\r\ndemarcation already mentioned come within the protection of the ninth\r\narticle, and that the treaty, being a part of the supreme law of the\r\nland, does extend over all such Mexicans, and assures to them perfect\r\nsecurity in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property, as well\r\nas in the free exercise of their religion; and this supreme law of\r\nthe land, being thus in actual force over this territory, is to be\r\nmaintained until it shall be displaced or superseded by other legal\r\nprovisions; and if it be obstructed or resisted by combinations too\r\npowerful to be suppressed by the civil authority the case is one which\r\ncomes within the provisions of law and which obliges the President to\r\nenforce those provisions. Neither the Constitution nor the laws nor my\r\nduty nor my oath of office leave me any alternative or any choice in\r\nmy mode of action.\r\n\r\nThe executive government of the United States has no power or\r\nauthority to determine what was the true line of boundary between\r\nMexico and the United States before the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,\r\nnor has it any such power now, since the question has become a\r\nquestion between the State of Texas and the United States. So far as\r\nthis boundary is doubtful, that doubt can only be removed by some\r\nact of Congress, to which the assent of the State of Texas may be\r\nnecessary, or by some appropriate mode of legal adjudication; but\r\nin the meantime, if disturbances or collisions arise or should be\r\nthreatened, it is absolutely incumbent on the executive government,\r\nhowever painful the duty, to take care that the laws be faithfully\r\nmaintained; and he can regard only the actual state of things as\r\nit existed at the date of the treaty, and is bound to protect all\r\ninhabitants who were then established and who now remain north and\r\neast of the line of demarcation in the full enjoyment of their liberty\r\nand property, according to the provisions of the ninth article of the\r\ntreaty. In other words, all must be now regarded as New Mexico which\r\nwas possessed and occupied as New Mexico by citizens of Mexico at the\r\ndate of the treaty until a definite line of boundary shall be\r\nestablished by competent authority.\r\n\r\nThis assertion of duty to protect the people of New Mexico from\r\nthreatened violence, or from seizure to be carried into Texas for\r\ntrial for alleged offenses against Texan laws, does not at all include\r\nany claim of power on the part of the Executive to establish any civil\r\nor military government within that Territory. _That power_ belongs\r\nexclusively to the legislative department, and Congress is the sole\r\njudge of the time and manner of creating or authorizing any such\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the Executive extends only to the execution of laws and\r\nthe maintenance of treaties already in force and the protection of all\r\nthe people of the United States in the enjoyment of the rights which\r\nthose treaties and laws guarantee.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly desirable that no occasion should arise for\r\nthe exercise of the powers thus vested in the President by the\r\nConstitution and the laws. With whatever mildness those powers might\r\nbe executed, or however clear the case of necessity, yet consequences\r\nmight, nevertheless, follow of which no human sagacity can foresee\r\neither the evils or the end.\r\n\r\nHaving thus laid before Congress the communication of his excellency\r\nthe governor of Texas and the answer thereto, and having made such\r\nobservations as I have thought the occasion called for respecting\r\nconstitutional obligations which may arise in the further progress of\r\nthings and may devolve on me to be performed, I hope I shall not be\r\nregarded as stepping aside from the line of my duty, notwithstanding\r\nthat I am aware that the subject is now before both Houses, if I\r\nexpress my deep and earnest conviction of the importance of an immediate\r\ndecision or arrangement or settlement of the question of boundary\r\nbetween Texas and the Territory of New Mexico. All considerations of\r\njustice, general expediency, and domestic tranquillity call for this.\r\nIt seems to be in its character and by position the first, or one of\r\nthe first, of the questions growing out of the acquisition of California\r\nand New Mexico, and now requiring decision.\r\n\r\nNo government can be established for New Mexico, either State or\r\nTerritorial, until it shall be first ascertained what New Mexico\r\nis, and what are her limits and boundaries. These can not be fixed\r\nor known till the line of division between her and Texas shall be\r\nascertained and established; and numerous and weighty reasons\r\nconspire, in my judgment, to show that this divisional line should be\r\nestablished by Congress with the assent of the government of Texas. In\r\nthe first place, this seems by far the most prompt mode of proceeding\r\nby which the end can be accomplished. If judicial proceedings were\r\nresorted to, such proceedings would necessarily be slow, and years\r\nwould pass by, in all probability, before the controversy could be\r\nended. So great a delay in this case is to be avoided if possible.\r\nSuch delay would be every way inconvenient, and might be the occasion\r\nof disturbances and collisions. For the same reason I would, with the\r\nutmost deference to the wisdom of Congress, express a doubt of the\r\nexpediency of the appointment of commissioners, and of an examination,\r\nestimate, and an award of indemnity to be made by them. This would be\r\nbut a species of arbitration, which might last as long as a suit at\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am able to comprehend the case, the general facts are\r\nnow all known, and Congress is as capable of deciding on it justly\r\nand properly now as it probably would be after the report of the\r\ncommissioners. If the claim of title on the part of Texas appears\r\nto Congress to be well founded in whole or in part, it is in the\r\ncompetency of Congress to offer her an indemnity for the surrender of\r\nthat claim. In a case like this, surrounded, as it is, by many cogent\r\nconsiderations, all calling for amicable adjustment and immediate\r\nsettlement, the Government of the United States would be justified,\r\nin my opinion, in allowing an indemnity to Texas, not unreasonable\r\nor extravagant, but fair, liberal, and awarded in a just spirit of\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nI think no event would be hailed with more gratification by the people\r\nof the United States than the amicable adjustment of questions of\r\ndifficulty which have now for a long time agitated the country and\r\noccupied, to the exclusion of other subjects, the time and attention\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nHaving thus freely communicated the results of my own reflections on\r\nthe most advisable mode of adjusting the boundary question, I shall\r\nnevertheless cheerfully acquiesce in any other mode which the wisdom\r\nof Congress may devise. And in conclusion I repeat my conviction that\r\nevery consideration of the public interest manifests the necessity of\r\na provision by Congress for the settlement of this boundary question\r\nbefore the present session be brought to a close. The settlement of\r\nother questions connected with the same subject within the same period\r\nis greatly to be desired, but the adjustment of this appears to me to\r\nbe in the highest degree important. In the train of such an adjustment\r\nwe may well hope that there will follow a return of harmony and good\r\nwill, an increased attachment to the Union, and the general\r\nsatisfaction of the country.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 8, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the language in the first paragraph of my\r\nmessage to the two Houses of Congress of the 6th instant may convey\r\nthe idea that Governor Bell's letter to my predecessor was received by\r\nhim before his death.

I concur fully in this opinion.\r\nWith these convictions I feel compelled to adhere to the decision\r\nof my lamented predecessor, and can only regret that I have the\r\nmisfortune in this instance to differ from those for whom,\r\nindividually and collectively, I entertain the highest respect.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th\r\nof May, 1828, entitled \"An act in addition to an act entitled 'An\r\nact concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to\r\nequalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes,\" it is\r\nprovided that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President\r\nof the United States by the government of any foreign nation that no\r\ndiscriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied\r\nin the ports of the said nation upon vessels wholly belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or\r\nmerchandise imported in the same from the United States or from any\r\nforeign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue his\r\nproclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of\r\ntonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be suspended\r\nand discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign\r\nnation and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the\r\nUnited States in the same from the said foreign nation or from any\r\nother foreign country, the said suspension to take effect from the\r\ntime of such notification being given to the President of the United\r\nStates and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels\r\nbelonging to citizens of the United States and their cargoes, as\r\naforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me from the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Chile, through an official communication\r\nof Señor Don Manuel Carvallo, accredited to this Government as envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that Republic, under\r\ndate of the 31st of October, 1850, that no other or higher duties of\r\ntonnage and impost are imposed or levied in the ports of Chile upon\r\nvessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States and upon the\r\nproduce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the\r\nUnited States and from any foreign country whatever than are levied on\r\nChilean ships and their cargoes in the same ports and under like\r\ncircumstances:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Millard Fillmore, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several\r\nacts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the\r\nUnited States are and shall be suspended and discontinued so far as\r\nrespects the vessels of Chile and the produce, manufactures, and\r\nmerchandise imported into the United States in the same from Chile and\r\nfrom any other foreign country whatever, the said suspension to take\r\neffect from the day above mentioned and to continue thenceforward so\r\nlong as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States\r\nand the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into Chile in\r\nthe same, as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the\r\nGovernment of Chile.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 1st day of\r\nNovember, A.D. 1850, and the seventy-fifth of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  W.S. DERRICK,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 2, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing suddenly called in the midst of the last session of Congress by\r\na painful dispensation of Divine Providence to the responsible station\r\nwhich I now hold, I contented myself with such communications to the\r\nlegislature as the exigency of the moment seemed to require. The\r\ncountry was shrouded in mourning for the loss of its venerable Chief\r\nMagistrate and all hearts were penetrated with grief. Neither the time\r\nnor the occasion appeared to require or to justify on my part any\r\ngeneral expression of political opinions or any announcement of the\r\nprinciples which would govern me in the discharge of the duties to the\r\nperformance of which I had been so unexpectedly called. I trust,\r\ntherefore, that it may not be deemed inappropriate if I avail myself\r\nof this opportunity of the reassembling of Congress to make known my\r\nsentiments in a general manner in regard to the policy which ought to\r\nbe pursued by the Government both in its intercourse with foreign\r\nnations and its management and administration of internal affairs.\r\n\r\nNations, like individuals in a state of nature, are equal and\r\nindependent, possessing certain rights and owing certain duties to\r\neach other, arising from their necessary and unavoidable relations;\r\nwhich rights and duties there is no common human authority to protect\r\nand enforce. Still, they are rights and duties, binding in morals, in\r\nconscience, and in honor, although there is no tribunal to which an\r\ninjured party can appeal but the disinterested judgment of mankind,\r\nand ultimately the arbitrament of the sword.\r\n\r\nAmong the acknowledged rights of nations is that which each possesses\r\nof establishing that form of government which it may deem most\r\nconducive to the happiness and prosperity of its own citizens, of\r\nchanging that form as circumstances may require, and of managing its\r\ninternal affairs according to its own will. The people of the United\r\nStates claim this right for themselves, and they readily concede it to\r\nothers. Hence it becomes an imperative duty not to interfere in the\r\ngovernment or internal policy of other nations; and although we may\r\nsympathize with the unfortunate or the oppressed everywhere in their\r\nstruggles for freedom, our principles forbid us from taking any part\r\nin such foreign contests. We make no wars to promote or to prevent\r\nsuccessions to thrones, to maintain any theory of a balance of power,\r\nor to suppress the actual government which any country chooses to\r\nestablish for itself. We instigate no revolutions, nor suffer any\r\nhostile military expeditions to be fitted out in the United States\r\nto invade the territory or provinces of a friendly nation. The great\r\nlaw of morality ought to have a national as well as a personal and\r\nindividual application. We should act toward other nations as we wish\r\nthem to act toward us, and justice and conscience should form the rule\r\nof conduct between governments, instead of mere power, self-interest,\r\nor the desire of aggrandizement. To maintain a strict neutrality in\r\nforeign wars, to cultivate friendly relations, to reciprocate every\r\nnoble and generous act, and to perform punctually and scrupulously\r\nevery treaty obligation--these are the duties which we owe to other\r\nstates, and by the performance of which we best entitle ourselves to\r\nlike treatment from them; or, if that, in any case, be refused, we can\r\nenforce our own rights with justice and a clear conscience.\r\n\r\nIn our domestic policy the Constitution will be my guide, and in\r\nquestions of doubt I shall look for its interpretation to the judicial\r\ndecisions of that tribunal which was established to expound it and to\r\nthe usage of the Government, sanctioned by the acquiescence of the\r\ncountry. I regard all its provisions as equally binding. In all its\r\nparts it is the will of the people expressed in the most solemn form,\r\nand the constituted authorities are but agents to carry that will into\r\neffect. Every power which it has granted is to be exercised for the\r\npublic good; but no pretense of utility, no honest conviction, even,\r\nof what might be expedient, can justify the assumption of any power\r\nnot granted. The powers conferred upon the Government and their\r\ndistribution to the several departments are as clearly expressed in\r\nthat sacred instrument as the imperfection of human language will\r\nallow, and I deem it my first duty not to question its wisdom, add to\r\nits provisions, evade its requirements, or nullify its commands.\r\n\r\nUpon you, fellow-citizens, as the representatives of the States and\r\nthe people, is wisely devolved the legislative power. I shall comply\r\nwith my duty in laying before you from time to time any information\r\ncalculated to enable you to discharge your high and responsible trust\r\nfor the benefit of our common constituents.\r\n\r\nMy opinions will be frankly expressed upon the leading subjects of\r\nlegislation; and if--which I do not anticipate--any act should pass\r\nthe two Houses of Congress which should appear to me unconstitutional,\r\nor an encroachment on the just powers of other departments, or with\r\nprovisions hastily adopted and likely to produce consequences\r\ninjurious and unforeseen, I should not shrink from the duty of\r\nreturning it to you, with my reasons, for your further consideration.\r\nBeyond the due performance of these constitutional obligations, both\r\nmy respect for the Legislature and my sense of propriety will restrain\r\nme from any attempt to control or influence your proceedings. With you\r\nis the power, the honor, and the responsibility of the legislation of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is a limited Government. It is\r\nconfined to the exercise of powers expressly granted and such others\r\nas may be necessary for carrying those powers into effect; and it is\r\nat all times an especial duty to guard against any infringement on the\r\njust rights of the States. Over the objects and subjects intrusted to\r\nCongress its legislative authority is supreme. But here that authority\r\nceases, and every citizen who truly loves the Constitution and desires\r\nthe continuance of its existence and its blessings will resolutely and\r\nfirmly resist any interference in those domestic affairs which the\r\nConstitution has clearly and unequivocally left to the exclusive\r\nauthority of the States. And every such citizen will also deprecate\r\nuseless irritation among the several members of the Union and all\r\nreproach and crimination tending to alienate one portion of the\r\ncountry from another. The beauty of our system of government consists,\r\nand its safety and durability must consist, in avoiding mutual\r\ncollisions and encroachments and in the regular separate action of\r\nall, while each is revolving in its own distinct orbit.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has made it the duty of the President to take care\r\nthat the laws be faithfully executed. In a government like ours, in\r\nwhich all laws are passed by a majority of the representatives of the\r\npeople, and these representatives are chosen for such short periods\r\nthat any injurious or obnoxious law can very soon be repealed, it\r\nwould appear unlikely that any great numbers should be found ready\r\nto resist the execution of the laws. But it must be borne in mind\r\nthat the country is extensive; that there may be local interests or\r\nprejudices rendering a law odious in one part which is not so in\r\nanother, and that the thoughtless and inconsiderate, misled by their\r\npassions or their imaginations, may be induced madly to resist such\r\nlaws as they disapprove. Such persons should recollect that without\r\nlaw there can be no real practical liberty; that when law is trampled\r\nunder foot tyranny rules, whether it appears in the form of a military\r\ndespotism or of popular violence. The law is the only sure protection\r\nof the weak and the only efficient restraint upon the strong. When\r\nimpartially and faithfully administered, none is beneath its\r\nprotection and none above its control. You, gentlemen, and the country\r\nmay be assured that to the utmost of my ability and to the extent of\r\nthe power vested in me I shall at all times and in all places take\r\ncare that the laws be faithfully executed. In the discharge of this\r\nduty, solemnly imposed upon me by the Constitution and by my oath of\r\noffice, I shall shrink from no responsibility, and shall endeavor to\r\nmeet events as they may arise with firmness, as well as with prudence\r\nand discretion.\r\n\r\nThe appointing power is one of the most delicate with which the\r\nExecutive is invested. I regard it as a sacred trust, to be exercised\r\nwith the sole view of advancing the prosperity and happiness of the\r\npeople. It shall be my effort to elevate the standard of official\r\nemployment by selecting for places of importance individuals fitted\r\nfor the posts to which they are assigned by their known integrity,\r\ntalents, and virtues. In so extensive a country, with so great a\r\npopulation, and where few persons appointed to office can be known to\r\nthe appointing power, mistakes will sometimes unavoidably happen and\r\nunfortunate appointments be made notwithstanding the greatest care.\r\nIn such cases the power of removal may be properly exercised; and\r\nneglect of duty or malfeasance in office will be no more tolerated\r\nin individuals appointed by myself than in those appointed by others.\r\n\r\nI am happy in being able to say that no unfavorable change in our\r\nforeign relations has taken place since the message at the opening of\r\nthe last session of Congress. We are at peace with all nations and we\r\nenjoy in an eminent degree the blessings of that peace in a prosperous\r\nand growing commerce and in all the forms of amicable national\r\nintercourse. The unexampled growth of the country, the present amount\r\nof its population, and its ample means of self-protection assure for\r\nit the respect of all nations, while it is trusted that its character\r\nfor justice and a regard to the rights of other States will cause that\r\nrespect to be readily and cheerfully paid.\r\n\r\nA convention was negotiated between the United States and Great\r\nBritain in April last for facilitating and protecting the construction\r\nof a ship canal between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and for other\r\npurposes. The instrument has since been ratified by the contracting\r\nparties, the exchange of ratifications has been effected, and\r\nproclamation thereof has been duly made.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the stipulations contained in this convention, two\r\nother objects remain to be accomplished between the contracting\r\npowers:\r\n\r\nFirst. The designation and establishment of a free port at each end of\r\nthe canal.\r\n\r\nSecond. An agreement fixing the distance from the shore within which\r\nbelligerent maritime operations shall not be carried on.\r\n\r\nOn these points there is little doubt that the two Governments will\r\ncome to an understanding.\r\n\r\nThe company of citizens of the United States who have acquired from\r\nthe State of Nicaragua the privilege of constructing a ship canal\r\nbetween the two oceans through the territory of that State have made\r\nprogress in their preliminary arrangements. The treaty between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain of the 19th of April last, above\r\nreferred to, being now in operation, it is to be hoped that the\r\nguaranties which it offers will be sufficient to secure the completion\r\nof the work with all practicable expedition. It is obvious that this\r\nresult would be indefinitely postponed if any other than peaceful\r\nmeasures for the purpose of harmonizing conflicting claims to\r\nterritory in that quarter should be adopted. It will consequently be\r\nmy endeavor to cause any further negotiations on the part of this\r\nGovernment which may be requisite for this purpose to be so conducted\r\nas to bring them to a speedy and successful close.\r\n\r\nSome unavoidable delay has occurred, arising from distance and the\r\ndifficulty of intercourse between this Government and that of\r\nNicaragua, but as intelligence has just been received of the\r\nappointment of an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of\r\nthat Government to reside at Washington, whose arrival may soon be\r\nexpected, it is hoped that no further impediments will be experienced\r\nin the prompt transaction of business between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the United States have undertaken the connection of the\r\ntwo oceans by means of a railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,\r\nunder grants of the Mexican Government to a citizen of that Republic.\r\nIt is understood that a thorough survey of the course of the\r\ncommunication is in preparation, and there is every reason to expect\r\nthat it will be prosecuted with characteristic energy, especially when\r\nthat Government shall have consented to such stipulations with the\r\nGovernment of the United States as may be necessary to impart a\r\nfeeling of security to those who may embark their property in the\r\nenterprise. Negotiations are pending for the accomplishment of that\r\nobject, and a hope is confidently entertained that when the Government\r\nof Mexico shall become duly sensible of the advantages which that\r\ncountry can not fail to derive from the work, and learn that the\r\nGovernment of the United States desires that the right of sovereignty\r\nof Mexico in the Isthmus shall remain unimpaired, the stipulations\r\nreferred to will be agreed to with alacrity.\r\n\r\nBy the last advices from Mexico it would appear, however, that that\r\nGovernment entertains strong objections to some of the stipulations\r\nwhich the parties concerned in the project of the railroad deem\r\nnecessary for their protection and security. Further consideration, it\r\nis to be hoped, or some modification of terms, may yet reconcile the\r\ndifferences existing between the two Governments in this respect.\r\n\r\nFresh instructions have recently been given to the minister of the\r\nUnited States in Mexico, who is prosecuting the subject with\r\npromptitude and ability.\r\n\r\nAlthough the negotiations with Portugal for the payment of claims of\r\ncitizens of the United States against that Government have not yet\r\nresulted in a formal treaty, yet a proposition, made by the Government\r\nof Portugal for the final adjustment and payment of those claims, has\r\nrecently been accepted on the part of the United States. It gives me\r\npleasure to say that Mr. Clay, to whom the negotiation on the part of\r\nthe United States had been intrusted, discharged the duties of his\r\nappointment with ability and discretion, acting always within the\r\ninstructions of his Government.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that a regular convention will be immediately\r\nnegotiated for carrying the agreement between the two Governments into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner appointed under the act of Congress for carrying into\r\neffect the convention with Brazil of the 27th of January, 1849, has\r\nentered upon the performance of the duties imposed upon him by that\r\nact. It is hoped that those duties may be completed within the time\r\nwhich it prescribes. The documents, however, which the Imperial\r\nGovernment, by the third article of the convention, stipulates to\r\nfurnish to the Government of the United States have not yet been\r\nreceived. As it is presumed that those documents will be essential for\r\nthe correct disposition of the claims, it may become necessary for\r\nCongress to extend the period limited for the duration of the\r\ncommission. The sum stipulated by the fourth article of the convention\r\nto be paid to this Government has been received.\r\n\r\nThe collection in the ports of the United States of discriminating\r\nduties upon the vessels of Chili and their cargoes has been suspended,\r\npursuant to the provisions of the act of Congress of the 24th of\r\nMay, 1828. It is to be hoped that this measure will impart a fresh\r\nimpulse to the commerce between the two countries, which of late, and\r\nespecially since our acquisition of California, has, to the mutual\r\nadvantage of the parties, been much augmented.\r\n\r\nPeruvian guano has become so desirable an article to the agricultural\r\ninterest of the United States that it is the duty of the Government to\r\nemploy all the means properly in its power for the purpose of causing\r\nthat article to be imported into the country at a reasonable price.\r\nNothing will be omitted on my part toward accomplishing this desirable\r\nend. I am persuaded that in removing any restraints on this traffic\r\nthe Peruvian Government will promote its own best interests, while it\r\nwill afford a proof of a friendly disposition toward this country,\r\nwhich will be duly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe treaty between the United States and His Majesty the King of the\r\nHawaiian Islands, which has recently been made public, will, it is\r\nbelieved, have a beneficial effect upon the relations between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe relations between those parts of the island of St. Domingo which\r\nwere formerly colonies of Spain and France, respectively, are still in\r\nan unsettled condition. The proximity of that island to the United\r\nStates and the delicate questions involved in the existing controversy\r\nthere render it desirable that it should be permanently and speedily\r\nadjusted. The interests of humanity and of general commerce also\r\ndemand this; and as intimations of the same sentiment have been\r\nreceived from other governments, it is hoped that some plan may soon\r\nbe devised to effect the object in a manner likely to give general\r\nsatisfaction. The Government of the United States will not fail, by\r\nthe exercise of all proper friendly offices, to do all in its power\r\nto put an end to the destructive war which has raged between the\r\ndifferent parts of the island and to secure to them both the benefits\r\nof peace and commerce.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for a\r\ndetailed statement of the finances.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts into the Treasury for the year ending 30th of June\r\nlast were $47,421,748.90.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures during the same period were $43,002,168.90.\r\n\r\nThe public debt has been reduced since the last annual report from the\r\nTreasury Department $495,276.79.\r\n\r\nBy the nineteenth section of the act of 28th January, 1847, the\r\nproceeds of the sales of the public lands were pledged for the\r\ninterest and principal of the public debt. The great amount of those\r\nlands subsequently granted by Congress for military bounties will, it\r\nis believed, very nearly supply the public demand for several years\r\nto come, and but little reliance can, therefore, be placed on that\r\nhitherto fruitful source of revenue. Aside from the permanent annual\r\nexpenditures, which have necessarily largely increased, a portion of\r\nthe public debt, amounting to $8,075,986.59, must be provided for\r\nwithin the next two fiscal years. It is most desirable that these\r\naccruing demands should be met without resorting to new loans.\r\n\r\nAll experience has demonstrated the wisdom and policy of raising a\r\nlarge portion of revenue for the support of Government from duties on\r\ngoods imported. The power to lay these duties is unquestionable, and\r\nits chief object, of course, is to replenish the Treasury. But if in\r\ndoing this an incidental advantage may be gained by encouraging the\r\nindustry of our own citizens, it is our duty to avail ourselves of\r\nthat advantage.\r\n\r\nA duty laid upon an article which can not be produced in this country,\r\nsuch as tea or coffee, adds to the cost of the article, and is chiefly\r\nor wholly paid by the consumer. But a duty laid upon an article which\r\nmay be produced here stimulates the skill and industry of our own\r\ncountry to produce the same article, which is brought into the market\r\nin competition with the foreign article, and the importer is thus\r\ncompelled to reduce his price to that at which the domestic article\r\ncan be sold, thereby throwing a part of the duty upon the producer of\r\nthe foreign article. The continuance of this process creates the skill\r\nand invites the capital which finally enable us to produce the article\r\nmuch cheaper than it could have been procured from abroad, thereby\r\nbenefiting both the producer and the consumer at home. The consequence\r\nof this is that the artisan and the agriculturist are brought\r\ntogether, each affords a ready market for the produce of the other,\r\nthe whole country becomes prosperous, and the ability to produce every\r\nnecessary of life renders us independent in war as well as in peace.\r\n\r\nA high tariff can never be permanent. It will cause dissatisfaction,\r\nand will be changed. It excludes competition, and thereby invites the\r\ninvestment of capital in manufactures to such excess that when changed\r\nit brings distress, bankruptcy, and ruin upon all who have been misled\r\nby its faithless protection. What the manufacturer wants is uniformity\r\nand permanency, that he may feel a confidence that he is not to be\r\nruined by sudden changes. But to make a tariff uniform and permanent\r\nit is not only necessary that the laws should not be altered, but that\r\nthe duty should not fluctuate. To effect this all duties should be\r\nspecific wherever the nature of the article is such as to admit of it.\r\n_Ad valorem_ duties fluctuate with the price and offer strong\r\ntemptations to fraud and perjury. Specific duties, on the contrary,\r\nare equal and uniform in all ports and at all times, and offer a\r\nstrong inducement to the importer to bring the best article, as he\r\npays no more duty upon that than upon one of inferior quality. I\r\ntherefore strongly recommend a modification of the present tariff,\r\nwhich has prostrated some of our most important and necessary\r\nmanufactures, and that specific duties be imposed sufficient to raise\r\nthe requisite revenue, making such discriminations in favor of the\r\nindustrial pursuits of our own country as to encourage home production\r\nwithout excluding foreign competition. It is also important that an\r\nunfortunate provision in the present tariff, which imposes a much\r\nhigher duty upon the raw material that enters into our manufactures\r\nthan upon the manufactured article, should be remedied.\r\n\r\nThe papers accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nwill disclose frauds attempted upon the revenue, in variety and amount\r\nso great as to justify the conclusion that it is impossible under\r\nany system of _ad valorem_ duties levied upon the foreign cost or\r\nvalue of the article to secure an honest observance and an effectual\r\nadministration of the laws. The fraudulent devices to evade the law\r\nwhich have been detected by the vigilance of the appraisers leave no\r\nroom to doubt that similar impositions not discovered, to a large\r\namount, have been successfully practiced since the enactment of the\r\nlaw now in force. This state of things has already had a prejudicial\r\ninfluence upon those engaged in foreign commerce. It has a tendency to\r\ndrive the honest trader from the business of importing and to throw\r\nthat important branch of employment into the hands of unscrupulous and\r\ndishonest men, who are alike regardless of law and the obligations of\r\nan oath. By these means the plain intentions of Congress, as expressed\r\nin the law, are daily defeated. Every motive of policy and duty,\r\ntherefore, impels me to ask the earnest attention of Congress to this\r\nsubject. If Congress should deem it unwise to attempt any important\r\nchanges in the system of levying duties at this session, it will\r\nbecome indispensable to the protection of the revenue that such\r\nremedies as in the judgment of Congress may mitigate the evils\r\ncomplained of should be at once applied.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, specific duties would, in my opinion, afford the\r\nmost perfect remedy for this evil; but if you should not concur in\r\nthis view, then, as a partial remedy, I beg leave respectfully to\r\nrecommend that instead of taking the invoice of the article abroad\r\nas a means of determining its value here, the correctness of which\r\ninvoice it is in many cases impossible to verify, the law be so\r\nchanged as to require a home valuation or appraisal, to be regulated\r\nin such manner as to give, as far as practicable, uniformity in the\r\nseveral ports.\r\n\r\nThere being no mint in California, I am informed that the laborers\r\nin the mines are compelled to dispose of their gold dust at a large\r\ndiscount. This appears to me to be a heavy and unjust tax upon the\r\nlabor of those employed in extracting this precious metal, and I doubt\r\nnot you will be disposed at the earliest period possible to relieve\r\nthem from it by the establishment of a mint. In the meantime, as an\r\nassayer's office is established there, I would respectfully submit for\r\nyour consideration the propriety of authorizing gold bullion which has\r\nbeen assayed and stamped to be received in payment of Government dues.\r\nI can not conceive that the Treasury would suffer any loss by such\r\na provision, which will at once raise bullion to its par value, and\r\nthereby save (if I am rightly informed) many millions of dollars to\r\nthe laborers which are now paid in brokerage to convert this precious\r\nmetal into available funds. This discount upon their hard earnings is\r\na heavy tax, and every effort should be made by the Government to\r\nrelieve them from so great a burden.\r\n\r\nMore than three-fourths of our population are engaged in the\r\ncultivation of the soil. The commercial, manufacturing, and navigating\r\ninterests are all to a great extent dependent on the agricultural.\r\nIt is therefore the most important interest of the nation, and has\r\na just claim to the fostering care and protection of the Government\r\nso far as they can be extended consistently with the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution. As this can not be done by the ordinary modes of\r\nlegislation, I respectfully recommend the establishment of an\r\nagricultural bureau, to be charged with the duty of giving to this\r\nleading branch of American industry the encouragement which it so well\r\ndeserves. In view of the immense mineral resources of our country,\r\nprovision should also be made for the employment of a competent\r\nmineralogist and chemist, who should be required, under the direction\r\nof the head of the bureau, to collect specimens of the various\r\nminerals of our country and to ascertain by careful analysis their\r\nrespective elements and properties and their adaptation to useful\r\npurposes. He should also be required to examine and report upon the\r\nqualities of different soils and the manures best calculated to\r\nimprove their productiveness. By publishing the results of such\r\nexperiments, with suitable explanations, and by the collection and\r\ndistribution of rare seeds and plants, with instructions as to the\r\nbest system of cultivation, much may be done to promote this great\r\nnational interest.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of Congress passed on the 23d of May,\r\n1850, providing, among other things, for taking the Seventh Census,\r\na superintendent was appointed and all other measures adopted which\r\nwere deemed necessary to insure the prompt and faithful performance\r\nof that duty. The appropriation already made will, it is believed,\r\nbe sufficient to defray the whole expense of the work, but further\r\nlegislation may be necessary in regard to the compensation of some\r\nof the marshals of the Territories. It will also be proper to make\r\nprovision by law at an early day for the publication of such abstracts\r\nof the returns as the public interests may require.\r\n\r\nThe unprecedented growth of our territories on the Pacific in wealth\r\nand population and the consequent increase of their social and\r\ncommercial relations with the Atlantic States seem to render it the\r\nduty of the Government to use all its constitutional power to improve\r\nthe means of intercourse with them. The importance of opening \"a line\r\nof communication, the best and most expeditious of which the nature of\r\nthe country will admit,\" between the Valley of the Mississippi and the\r\nPacific was brought to your notice by my predecessor in his annual\r\nmessage; and as the reasons which he presented in favor of the measure\r\nstill exist in full force, I beg leave to call your attention to them\r\nand to repeat the recommendations then made by him.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty which exists in regard to the validity of land titles\r\nin California is a subject which demands your early consideration.\r\nLarge bodies of land in that State are claimed under grants said to\r\nhave been made by authority of the Spanish and Mexican Governments.\r\nMany of these have not been perfected, others have been revoked, and\r\nsome are believed to be fraudulent. But until they shall have been\r\njudicially investigated they will continue to retard the settlement\r\nand improvement of the country. I therefore respectfully recommend\r\nthat provision be made by law for the appointment of commissioners to\r\nexamine all such claims with a view to their final adjustment.\r\n\r\nI also beg leave to call your attention to the propriety of extending\r\nat an early day our system of land laws, with such modifications as\r\nmay be necessary, over the State of California and the Territories of\r\nUtah and New Mexico. The mineral lands of California will, of course,\r\nform an exception to any general system which may be adopted. Various\r\nmethods of disposing of them have been suggested. I was at first\r\ninclined to favor the system of leasing, as it seemed to promise the\r\nlargest revenue to the Government and to afford the best security\r\nagainst monopolies; but further reflection and our experience in\r\nleasing the lead mines and selling lands upon credit have brought\r\nmy mind to the conclusion that there would be great difficulty in\r\ncollecting the rents, and that the relation of debtor and creditor\r\nbetween the citizens and the Government would be attended with many\r\nmischievous consequences. I therefore recommend that instead of\r\nretaining the mineral lands under the permanent control of the\r\nGovernment they be divided into small parcels and sold, under such\r\nrestrictions as to quantity and time as will insure the best price and\r\nguard most effectually against combinations of capitalists to obtain\r\nmonopolies.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Texas and the acquisition of California and New\r\nMexico have given increased importance to our Indian relations. The\r\nvarious tribes brought under our jurisdiction by these enlargements of\r\nour boundaries are estimated to embrace a population of 124,000.\r\n\r\nTexas and New Mexico are surrounded by powerful tribes of Indians,\r\nwho are a source of constant terror and annoyance to the inhabitants.\r\nSeparating into small predatory bands, and always mounted, they\r\noverrun the country, devastating farms, destroying crops, driving off\r\nwhole herds of cattle, and occasionally murdering the inhabitants or\r\ncarrying them into captivity. The great roads leading into the country\r\nare infested with them, whereby traveling is rendered extremely\r\ndangerous and immigration is almost entirely arrested. The Mexican\r\nfrontier, which by the eleventh article of the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo we are bound to protect against the Indians within our border,\r\nis exposed to these incursions equally with our own. The military\r\nforce stationed in that country, although forming a large proportion\r\nof the Army, is represented as entirely inadequate to our own\r\nprotection and the fulfillment of our treaty stipulations with Mexico.\r\nThe principal deficiency is in cavalry, and I recommend that Congress\r\nshould, at as early a period as practicable, provide for the raising\r\nof one or more regiments of mounted men.\r\n\r\nFor further suggestions on this subject and others connected with our\r\ndomestic interests and the defense of our frontier, I refer you to the\r\nreports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI commend also to your favorable consideration the suggestion\r\ncontained in the last-mentioned report and in the letter of the\r\nGeneral in Chief relative to the establishment of an asylum for the\r\nrelief of disabled and destitute soldiers. This subject appeals so\r\nstrongly to your sympathies that it would be superfluous in me to say\r\nanything more than barely to express my cordial approbation of the\r\nproposed object.\r\n\r\nThe Navy continues to give protection to our commerce and other\r\nnational interests in the different quarters of the globe, and, with\r\nthe exception of a single steamer on the Northern lakes, the vessels\r\nin commission are distributed in six different squadrons.\r\n\r\nThe report of the head of that Department will exhibit the services of\r\nthese squadrons and of the several vessels employed in each during the\r\npast year. It is a source of gratification that, while they have been\r\nconstantly prepared for any hostile emergency, they have everywhere\r\nmet with the respect and courtesy due as well to the dignity as to the\r\npeaceful dispositions and just purposes of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe two brigantines accepted by the Government from a generous citizen\r\nof New York and placed under the command of an officer of the Navy to\r\nproceed to the Arctic Seas in quest of the British commander Sir John\r\nFranklin and his companions, in compliance with the act of Congress\r\napproved in May last, had when last heard from penetrated into a high\r\nnorthern latitude; but the success of this noble and humane enterprise\r\nis yet uncertain.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the view of our present naval establishment\r\nand resources presented in the report of the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nand the suggestions therein made for its improvement, together with\r\nthe naval policy recommended for the security of our Pacific Coast and\r\nthe protection and extension of our commerce with eastern Asia. Our\r\nfacilities for a larger participation in the trade of the East, by\r\nmeans of our recent settlements on the shores of the Pacific, are too\r\nobvious to be overlooked or disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe questions in relation to rank in the Army and Navy and relative\r\nrank between officers of the two branches of the service, presented to\r\nthe Executive by certain resolutions of the House of Representatives\r\nat the last session of Congress, have been submitted to a board of\r\nofficers in each branch of the service, and their report may be\r\nexpected at an early day.\r\n\r\nI also earnestly recommend the enactment of a law authorizing officers\r\nof the Army and Navy to be retired from the service when incompetent\r\nfor its vigorous and active duties, taking care to make suitable\r\nprovision for those who have faithfully served their country and\r\nawarding distinctions by retaining in appropriate commands those who\r\nhave been particularly conspicuous for gallantry and good conduct.\r\nWhile the obligation of the country to maintain and honor those who,\r\nto the exclusion of other pursuits, have devoted themselves to its\r\narduous service is acknowledged, this obligation should not be\r\npermitted to interfere with the efficiency of the service itself.\r\n\r\nI am gratified in being able to state that the estimates of\r\nexpenditure for the Navy in the ensuing year are less by more than\r\n$1,000,000 than those of the present, excepting the appropriation\r\nwhich may become necessary for the construction of a dock on the coast\r\nof the Pacific, propositions for which are now being considered and on\r\nwhich a special report may be expected early in your present session.\r\n\r\nThere is an evident justness in the suggestion of the same report that\r\nappropriations for the naval service proper should be separated from\r\nthose for fixed and permanent objects, such as building docks and\r\nnavy-yards and the fixtures attached, and from the extraordinary\r\nobjects under the care of the Department which, however important,\r\nare not essentially naval.\r\n\r\nA revision of the code for the government of the Navy seems to require\r\nthe immediate consideration of Congress. Its system of crimes and\r\npunishments had undergone no change for half a century until the last\r\nsession, though its defects have been often and ably pointed out;\r\nand the abolition of a particular species of corporal punishment,\r\nwhich then took place, without providing any substitute, has left the\r\nservice in a state of defectiveness which calls for prompt correction.\r\nI therefore recommend that the whole subject be revised without delay\r\nand such a system established for the enforcement of discipline as\r\nshall be at once humane and effectual.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Postmaster-General presents a\r\nsatisfactory view of the operations and condition of that Department.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last fiscal year the length of the inland mail\r\nroutes in the United States (not embracing the service in Oregon and\r\nCalifornia) was 178,672 miles, the annual transportation thereon\r\n46,541,423 miles, and the annual cost of such transportation $2,724,426.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the annual transportation over that of the preceding\r\nyear was 3,997,354 miles and the increase in cost was $342,440.\r\n\r\nThe number of post-offices in the United States on the 1st day of July\r\nlast was 18,417, being an increase of I,670 during the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe gross revenues of the Department for the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1850, amounted to $5,552,971.48, including the annual appropriation of\r\n$200,000 for the franked matter of the Departments and excluding the\r\nforeign postages collected for and payable to the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period were $5,212,953.43, leaving a\r\nbalance of revenue over expenditures of $340,018.05.\r\n\r\nI am happy to find that the fiscal condition of the Department is such\r\nas to justify the Postmaster-General in recommending the reduction of\r\nour inland letter postage to 3 cents the single letter when prepaid and\r\n5 cents when not prepaid. He also recommends that the prepaid rate shall\r\nbe reduced to 2 cents whenever the revenues of the Department, after the\r\nreduction, shall exceed its expenditures by more than 5 per cent for two\r\nconsecutive years; that the postage upon California and other letters\r\nsent by our ocean steamers shall be much reduced, and that the rates of\r\npostage on newspapers, pamphlets, periodicals, and other printed matter\r\nshall be modified and some reduction thereon made.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that the proposed reductions will for the present\r\ndiminish the revenues of the Department. It is believed that the\r\ndeficiency, after the surplus already accumulated shall be exhausted,\r\nmay be almost wholly met either by abolishing the existing privileges of\r\nsending free matter through the mails or by paying out of the Treasury\r\nto the Post-Office Department a sum equivalent to the postage of which\r\nit is deprived by such privileges. The last is supposed to be the\r\npreferable mode, and will, if not entirely, so nearly supply that\r\ndeficiency as to make any further appropriation that may be found\r\nnecessary so inconsiderable as to form no obstacle to the proposed\r\nreductions.\r\n\r\nI entertain no doubt of the authority of Congress to make appropriations\r\nfor leading objects in that class of public works comprising what are\r\nusually called works of internal improvement. This authority I suppose\r\nto be derived chiefly from the power of regulating commerce with foreign\r\nnations and among the States and the power of laying and collecting\r\nimposts. Where commerce is to be carried on and imposts collected there\r\nmust be ports and harbors as well as wharves and custom-houses. If ships\r\nladen with valuable cargoes approach the shore or sail along the coast,\r\nlight-houses are necessary at suitable points for the protection of\r\nlife and property. Other facilities and securities for commerce and\r\nnavigation are hardly less important; and those clauses of the\r\nConstitution, therefore, to which I have referred have received from the\r\norigin of the Government a liberal and beneficial construction. Not only\r\nhave light-houses, buoys, and beacons been established and floating\r\nlights maintained, but harbors have been cleared and improved, piers\r\nconstructed, and even breakwaters for the safety of shipping and sea\r\nwalls to protect harbors from being filled up and rendered useless by\r\nthe action of the ocean, have been erected at very great expense. And\r\nthis construction of the Constitution appears the more reasonable from\r\nthe consideration that if these works, of such evident importance\r\nand utility, are not to be accomplished by Congress they can not be\r\naccomplished at all. By the adoption of the Constitution the several\r\nStates voluntarily parted with the power of collecting duties of imposts\r\nin their own ports, and it is not to be expected that they should raise\r\nmoney by internal taxation, direct or indirect, for the benefit of that\r\ncommerce the revenues derived from which do not, either in whole or in\r\npart, go into their own treasuries. Nor do I perceive any difference\r\nbetween the power of Congress to make appropriations for objects of this\r\nkind on the ocean and the power to make appropriations for similar\r\nobjects on lakes and rivers, wherever they are large enough to bear on\r\ntheir waters an extensive traffic. The magnificent Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries and the vast lakes of the North and Northwest appear to me\r\nto fall within the exercise of the power as justly and as clearly as the\r\nocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a mistake to regard expenditures\r\njudiciously made for these objects as expenditures for local purposes.\r\nThe position or sight of the work is necessarily local, but its utility\r\nis general. A ship canal around the Falls of St. Mary of less than a\r\nmile in length, though local in its construction, would yet be national\r\nin its purpose and its benefits, as it would remove the only obstruction\r\nto a navigation of more than 1,000 miles, affecting several States, as\r\nwell as our commercial relations with Canada. So, too, the breakwater at\r\nthe mouth of the Delaware is erected, not for the exclusive benefit of\r\nthe States bordering on the bay and river of that name, but for that\r\nof the whole coastwise navigation of the United States and, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, also of foreign commerce. If a ship be lost on the\r\nbar at the entrance of a Southern port for want of sufficient depth of\r\nwater, it is very likely to be a Northern ship; and if a steamboat be\r\nsunk in any part of the Mississippi on account of its channel not having\r\nbeen properly cleared of obstructions, it may be a boat belonging to\r\neither of eight or ten States. I may add, as somewhat remarkable, that\r\namong all the thirty-one States there is none that is not to a greater\r\nor less extent bounded on the ocean, or the Gulf of Mexico, or one of\r\nthe Great Lakes, or some navigable river.\r\n\r\nIn fulfilling our constitutional duties, fellow-citizens, on this\r\nsubject, as in carrying into effect all other powers conferred by the\r\nConstitution, we should consider ourselves as deliberating and acting\r\nfor one and the same country, and bear constantly in mind that our\r\nregard and our duty are due not to a particular part only, but to the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend that appropriations be made for completing such\r\nworks as have been already begun and for commencing such others as may\r\nseem to the wisdom of Congress to be of public and general importance.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and delays incident to the settlement of private claims\r\nby Congress amount in many cases to a denial of justice. There is reason\r\nto apprehend that many unfortunate creditors of the Government have\r\nthereby been unavoidably ruined. Congress has so much business of a\r\npublic character that it is impossible it should give much attention to\r\nmere private claims, and their accumulation is now so great that many\r\nclaimants must despair of ever being able to obtain a hearing. It may\r\nwell be doubted whether Congress, from the nature of its organization,\r\nis properly constituted to decide upon such cases. It is impossible that\r\neach member should examine the merits of every claim on which he is\r\ncompelled to vote, and it is preposterous to ask a judge to decide a\r\ncase which he has never heard. Such decisions may, and frequently must,\r\ndo injustice either to the claimant or the Government, and I perceive\r\nno better remedy for this growing evil than the establishment of some\r\ntribunal to adjudicate upon such claims. I beg leave, therefore,\r\nmost respectfully to recommend that provision be made by law for the\r\nappointment of a commission to settle all private claims against the\r\nUnited States; and as an _ex parte_ hearing must in all contested\r\ncases be very unsatisfactory, I also recommend the appointment of a\r\nsolicitor, whose duty it shall be to represent the Government before\r\nsuch commission and protect it against all illegal, fraudulent, or\r\nunjust claims which may be presented for their adjudication.\r\n\r\nThis District, which has neither voice nor vote in your deliberations,\r\nlooks to you for protection and aid, and I commend all its wants to your\r\nfavorable consideration, with a full confidence that you will meet them\r\nnot only with justice, but with liberality. It should be borne in mind\r\nthat in this city, laid out by Washington and consecrated by his name,\r\nis located the Capitol of our nation, the emblem of our Union and the\r\nsymbol of our greatness. Here also are situated all the public buildings\r\nnecessary for the use of the Government, and all these are exempt from\r\ntaxation. It should be the pride of Americans to render this place\r\nattractive to the people of the whole Republic and convenient and safe\r\nfor the transaction of the public business and the preservation of\r\nthe public records. The Government should therefore bear a liberal\r\nproportion of the burdens of all necessary and useful improvements. And\r\nas nothing could contribute more to the health, comfort, and safety of\r\nthe city and the security of the public buildings and records than an\r\nabundant supply of pure water, I respectfully recommend that you make\r\nsuch provisions for obtaining the same as in your wisdom you may deem\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nThe act, passed at your last session, making certain propositions to\r\nTexas for settling the disputed boundary between that State and the\r\nTerritory of New Mexico was, immediately on its passage, transmitted by\r\nexpress to the governor of Texas, to be laid by him before the general\r\nassembly for its agreement thereto. Its receipt was duly acknowledged,\r\nbut no official information has yet been received of the action of the\r\ngeneral assembly thereon. It may, however, be very soon expected, as,\r\nby the terms of the propositions submitted they were to have been acted\r\nupon on or before the first day of the present month.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to have been expected that the series of measures passed\r\nat your last session with the view of healing the sectional differences\r\nwhich had sprung from the slavery and territorial questions should at\r\nonce have realized their beneficent purpose. All mutual concession in\r\nthe nature of a compromise must necessarily be unwelcome to men of\r\nextreme opinions. And though without such concessions our Constitution\r\ncould not have been formed, and can not be permanently sustained, yet we\r\nhave seen them made the subject of bitter controversy in both sections\r\nof the Republic, It required many months of discussion and deliberation\r\nto secure the concurrence of a majority of Congress in their favor. It\r\nwould be strange if they had been received with immediate approbation by\r\npeople and States prejudiced and heated by the exciting controversies of\r\ntheir representatives. I believe those measures to have been required\r\nby the circumstances and condition of the country. I believe they\r\nwere necessary to allay asperities and animosities that were rapidly\r\nalienating one section of the country from another and destroying\r\nthose fraternal sentiments which are the strongest supports of the\r\nConstitution. They were adopted in the spirit of conciliation and for\r\nthe purpose of conciliation. I believe that a great majority of our\r\nfellow-citizens sympathize in that spirit and that purpose, and in\r\nthe main approve and are prepared in all respects to sustain these\r\nenactments. I can not doubt that the American people, bound together by\r\nkindred blood and common traditions, still cherish a paramount regard\r\nfor the Union of their fathers, and that they are ready to rebuke any\r\nattempt to violate its integrity, to disturb the compromises on which\r\nit is based, or to resist the laws which have been enacted under its\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe series of measures to which I have alluded are regarded by me as\r\na settlement in principle and substance--a final settlement of the\r\ndangerous and exciting subjects which they embraced. Most of these\r\nsubjects, indeed, are beyond your reach, as the legislation which\r\ndisposed of them was in its character final and irrevocable. It may\r\nbe presumed from the opposition which they all encountered that none\r\nof those measures was free from imperfections, but in their mutual\r\ndependence and connection they formed a system of compromise the most\r\nconciliatory and best for the entire country that could be obtained\r\nfrom conflicting sectional interests and opinions.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I recommend your adherence to the adjustment established\r\nby those measures until time and experience shall demonstrate the\r\nnecessity of further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse.\r\n\r\nBy that adjustment we have been rescued from the wide and boundless\r\nagitation that surrounded us, and have a firm, distinct, and legal\r\nground to rest upon. And the occasion, I trust, will justify me in\r\nexhorting my countrymen to rally upon and maintain that ground as the\r\nbest, if not the only, means of restoring peace and quiet to the country\r\nand maintaining inviolate the integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, I can not bring this communication to a close\r\nwithout invoking you to join me in humble and devout thanks to the Great\r\nRuler of Nations for the multiplied blessings which He has graciously\r\nbestowed upon us. His hand, so often visible in our preservation, has\r\nstayed the pestilence, saved us from foreign wars and domestic\r\ndisturbances, and scattered plenty throughout the land.\r\n\r\nOur liberties, religious and civil, have been maintained, the fountains\r\nof knowledge have all been kept open, and means of happiness widely\r\nspread and generally enjoyed greater than have fallen to the lot of any\r\nother nation. And while deeply penetrated with gratitude for the past,\r\nlet us hope that His all-wise providence will so guide our counsels as\r\nthat they shall result in giving satisfaction to our constituents,\r\nsecuring the peace of the country, and adding new strength to the united\r\nGovernment under which we live.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 9, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the House of Representatives a translation of a note\r\nof the 5th instant addressed to the Secretary of State by the minister\r\nof the Mexican Republic accredited to this Government, relative to a\r\nsubject[2] to which the attention of Congress was invited in my message\r\nat the opening of the present session.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the Senate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Incursions of Indians of the United States upon the\r\npopulation of the Mexican frontier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a report of the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ndocuments, relating to the African slave trade, in answer to the\r\nresolution of the Senate of the 28th of August last.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 13, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure of announcing to Congress the agreement on the part\r\nof Texas to the propositions offered to that State by the act of\r\nCongress approved on the 9th day of September last, entitled \"An act\r\nproposing to the State of Texas the establishment of her northern\r\nand western boundaries, the relinquishment by the said State of all\r\nterritory claimed by her exterior to said boundaries and of all her\r\nclaims upon the United States, and to establish a Territorial government\r\nfor New Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nBy the terms of that act it was required that the agreement of Texas to\r\nthe propositions contained in it should be given on or before the 1st\r\nday of December, 1850. An authenticated transcript of a law passed by\r\nthe legislature of Texas on the 25th day of November, agreeing to and\r\naccepting the propositions contained in the act of Congress, has been\r\nreceived. This law, after reciting the provisions of the act of Congress,\r\nproceeds to enact and declare as follows, viz:\r\n\r\n  Therefore, first. _Be it enacted by the legislature of the State of\r\n  Texas_, That the State of Texas hereby agrees to and accepts said\r\n  propositions; and it is hereby declared that the said State shall be\r\n  bound by the terms thereof according to their true import and meaning.\r\n\r\n  Second. That the governor of this State be, and is hereby, requested to\r\n  cause a copy of this act, authenticated under the seal of the State, to\r\n  be furnished to the President of the United States by mail as early as\r\n  practicable, and also a copy thereof, certified in like manner, to be\r\n  transmitted to each of the Senators and Representatives of Texas in\r\n  Congress. And that this act take effect from and after its passage.\r\n\r\n  C. G. KEENAN,\r\n  _Speaker of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\n  JOHN A. GREER,\r\n  _President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nApproved, November 25, 1850.\r\n\r\nP.H. BELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the common sources of public information it would appear that\r\na very remarkable degree of unanimity prevailed, not only in the\r\nlegislature, but among the people of Texas, in respect to the agreement\r\nof the State to that which had been proposed by Congress.\r\n\r\nI can not refrain from congratulating Congress and the country on the\r\nsuccess of this great and leading measure of conciliation and peace. The\r\ndifficulties felt and the dangers apprehended from the vast acquisitions\r\nof territory under the late treaty with Mexico seem now happily overcome\r\nby the wisdom of Congress. Within that territory there already exists\r\none State, respectable for the amount of her population, distinguished\r\nfor singular activity and enterprise, and remarkable in many respects\r\nfrom her condition and history. This new State has come into the Union\r\nwith manifestations not to be mistaken of her attachment to that\r\nConstitution and that Government which now embrace her and her interests\r\nwithin their protecting and beneficent control.\r\n\r\nOver the residue of the acquired territories regular Territorial\r\ngovernments are now established in the manner which has been most usual\r\nin the history of this Government. Various other acts of Congress may\r\nundoubtedly be requisite for the benefit as well as for the proper\r\ngovernment of these so distant parts of the country. But the same\r\nlegislative wisdom which has triumphed over the principal difficulties\r\nand accomplished the main end may safely be relied on for whatever\r\nmeasures may yet be found necessary to perfect its work, so that the\r\nacquisition of these vast regions to the United States may rather\r\nstrengthen than weaken the Constitution, which is over us all, and the\r\nUnion, which affords such ample daily proofs of its inestimable value.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a letter from the Secretary of War, communicating a\r\nreport of a board of officers to which, in pursuance of a resolution of\r\nthe Senate passed on the 30th of September last, were submitted the\r\nquestions proposed therein, relative to the expediency and necessity of\r\ncreating additional grades of commissioned officers in the Army and of\r\nenacting provisions authorizing officers of the Army to exercise civil\r\nfunctions in emergencies to be enumerated and restraining them from\r\nusurping the powers of civil functionaries.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 30, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate, in reply to their resolution of the\r\n26th instant, a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\npapers.[3]\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Correspondence with the Austrian chargé d'affaires\r\nrespecting the appointment or proceedings of the agent sent to examine\r\nand report upon the condition and prospects of the Hungarian people\r\nduring their struggle for independence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 3, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy a resolution passed by the House of Representatives on the 24th day\r\nof July, 1850, the President was requested to cause to be prepared and\r\ncommunicated to the House certain opinions of the Attorneys-General\r\ntherein specified. On inquiry I learned that the force employed in the\r\nAttorney-General's Office was not sufficient to perform this work;\r\nconsequently, I employed Benjamin F. Hall, esq., a counselor at law,\r\non the 9th day of September last, to execute it, and requested him to\r\ncommence it immediately. I informed him that I was not authorized to\r\ngive any other assurances as to compensation than that it rested with\r\nCongress to provide and fix it. I believe Mr. Hall to be in all respects\r\ncompetent and well fitted for the task which he has undertaken, and\r\ndiligent in the performance of it; and it appears to me that the most\r\njust mode of compensation will be to make a per diem allowance of $8 per\r\nday for the time actually employed, to be paid on the certificate of the\r\nAttorney-General.\r\n\r\nI also transmit herewith a portion of the manuscript prepared in\r\npursuance of said resolution, with a letter from Mr. Hall to me\r\nindicating the mode in which he thinks the work should be prepared and\r\nprinted, which appears to me worthy of consideration and adoption by the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 10, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor herewith to transmit to the Senate a communication from\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy on the subject of the discipline of the Navy,\r\nsuggesting such amendments of the law as may be necessary in consequence\r\nof the recent act abolishing flogging; to which I respectfully invite\r\nthe immediate attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 14, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nadopted July 18, 1850, requesting the President to communicate his views\r\non sundry questions of rank, precedence, and command among officers of\r\nthe Army and officers of the Navy, respectively, and of relative rank\r\nbetween officers of the Army and Navy when brought into cooperation, I\r\ncaused to be convened a board of intelligent and experienced officers in\r\neach branch of the service to consider the matters involved in said\r\nresolutions and to report their opinion for my advice and information.\r\n\r\nTheir reports have been made, and I have the honor herewith to submit\r\ncopies of them, together with bills drafted substantially in accordance\r\ntherewith, on the subject of rank in each branch of the service.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one of great interest, and it is highly important that it\r\nshould be settled by legislative authority and with as little delay as\r\npossible consistently with its proper examination.\r\n\r\nThe points on which it will be perceived that the two boards disagree in\r\nregard to relative rank between officers of the Army and Navy are not\r\nesteemed of very great practical importance, and the adoption of the\r\nrule proposed by either would be acceptable to the Executive.\r\n\r\nBut even if a decision on these shall be suspended, it is hoped that the\r\nbills which are designed to regulate rank, precedence, and command in\r\nthe Army and Navy as separate branches of service may receive the\r\nsanction of Congress, with such amendments as may be deemed appropriate,\r\nin the course of the present session.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 3, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers,[4] in answer to their resolution of the 30th\r\nultimo.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Correspondence relative to the possessory rights of the\r\nBritish Hudsons Bay Company in Oregon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ndocuments,[5] in answer to the Senate's resolution of the 1st\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Correspondence with Spain relative to the claim of the\r\nowners of the schooner _Amistad_ for compensation on account of the\r\nliberation of negroes on board said vessel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate, for its consideration, a general\r\nconvention between the United States and the Swiss Confederation,\r\nconcluded and signed at Berne on the 25th day of November last by Mr. A.\r\nDudley Mann on the part of the United States and by Messrs. Druey and\r\nFrey-Hérosée on the part of the Swiss Confederation. I communicate at\r\nthe same time a copy of the instructions under which Mr. Mann acted and\r\nhis dispatch of the 30th November last, explanatory of the articles of\r\nthe convention.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this convention to the consideration of the Senate I\r\nfeel it my duty to invite its special attention to the first and\r\nfifth articles. These articles appear to contain provisions quite\r\nobjectionable, if, indeed, they can be considered as properly embraced\r\nin the treaty-making power.\r\n\r\nThe second clause of the first article is in these words:\r\n\r\n  In the United States of America citizens of Switzerland shall be\r\n  received and treated in each State upon the same footing and upon the\r\n  same conditions as citizens of the United States born in or belonging to\r\n  other States of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that according to the Constitution of the United States\r\na citizen of one State may hold lands in any other State; and States\r\nhave, sometimes by general, sometimes by special, laws, removed the\r\ndisabilities attaching to foreigners not naturalized in regard to the\r\nholding of land. But this is not supposed to be a power properly to be\r\nexercised by the President and Senate in concluding and ratifying a\r\ntreaty with a foreign state. The authority naturally belongs to the\r\nState within whose limits the land may lie. The naturalization of\r\nforeigners is provided for by the laws of the United States, in\r\npursuance of the provision of the Constitution; but when, under the\r\noperation of these laws, foreigners become citizens of the United\r\nStates, all would seem to be done which it is in the power of this\r\nGovernment to do to enable foreigners to hold land. The clause referred\r\nto, therefore, appears to me inadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe fourth clause of the same article provides, among other things, that\r\ncitizens of Switzerland may, within the United States, acquire, possess,\r\nand alienate personal and real estate, and the fifth article grants them\r\nthe power of disposing of their real estate, which, perhaps, would be no\r\notherwise objectionable, if it stood by itself, than as it would seem to\r\nimply a power to hold that of which they are permitted to dispose.\r\n\r\nThese objections, perhaps, may be removed by striking out the second\r\nclause of the first article and the words \"and real\" in the fourth\r\nclause. An amendment similar to the last here suggested was made by the\r\nSenate in the convention between the United States and the King of\r\nBavaria, the ratification of which, as amended, the Senate advised and\r\nconsented to on the 15th day of March, 1845.\r\n\r\nBut there is another and a decisive objection, arising from the last\r\nclause in the first article. That clause is in these words:\r\n\r\n  On account of the tenor of the federal constitution of Switzerland,\r\n  Christians alone are entitled to the enjoyment of the privileges\r\n  guaranteed by the present article in the Swiss Cantons. But said\r\n  Cantons are not prohibited from extending the same privileges to\r\n  citizens of the United States of other religious persuasions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears from this that Christians alone are, in some of the Swiss\r\nCantons, entitled to the enjoyment of privileges guaranteed by the first\r\narticle, although the Cantons themselves are not prohibited from\r\nextending the same privileges to citizens of the United States of other\r\nreligious persuasions.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that neither by law, nor by treaty, nor by any other\r\nofficial proceeding is it competent for the Government of the United\r\nStates to establish any distinction between its citizens founded on\r\ndifferences in religious beliefs. Any benefit or privilege conferred by\r\nlaw or treaty on one must be common to all, and we are not at liberty,\r\non a question of such vital interest and plain constitutional duty,\r\nto consider whether the particular case is one in which substantial\r\ninconvenience or injustice might ensue. It is enough that an inequality\r\nwould be sanctioned hostile to the institutions of the United States and\r\ninconsistent with the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nNor can the Government of the United States rely on the individual\r\nCantons of Switzerland for extending the same privileges to other\r\ncitizens of the United States as this article extends to Christians. It\r\nis indispensable not only that every privilege granted to any of the\r\ncitizens of the United States should be granted to all, but also that\r\nthe grant of such privilege should stand upon the same stipulation and\r\nassurance by the whole Swiss Confederation as those of other articles of\r\nthe convention.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances, especially some of recent occurrence,\r\nin which the Executive has transmitted treaties to the Senate with\r\nsuggestions of amendment, and I have therefore thought it not improper\r\nto send the present convention to the Senate, inviting its attention\r\nto such amendments as appeared to me to be important, although I have\r\nentertained considerable doubt whether it would not be better to send\r\nback the convention for correction in the objectionable particulars\r\nbefore laying it before the Senate for ratification.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 10th instant, calling\r\nfor information relative to a contract alleged to have been made by Mr.\r\nI.D.

Private and unofficial communications concur in\r\nestablishing the main facts of this account, but no satisfactory\r\nofficial information has as yet been received; and in some important\r\nrespects the accuracy of the account has been denied by persons whom it\r\nimplicates. Nothing could be more unexpected than that such a gross\r\nviolation of law, such a high-handed contempt of the authority of the\r\nUnited States, should be perpetrated by a band of lawless confederates\r\nat noonday in the city of Boston, and in the very temple of justice. I\r\nregard this flagitious proceeding as being a surprise not unattended by\r\nsome degree of negligence; nor do I doubt that if any such act of\r\nviolence had been apprehended thousands of the good citizens of Boston\r\nwould have presented themselves voluntarily and promptly to prevent it.\r\nBut the danger does not seem to have been timely made known or duly\r\nappreciated by those who were concerned in the execution of the process.\r\nIn a community distinguished for its love of order and respect for the\r\nlaws, among a people whose sentiment is liberty and law, and not liberty\r\nwithout law nor above the law, such an outrage could only be the result\r\nof sudden violence, unhappily too much unprepared for to be successfully\r\nresisted. It would be melancholy indeed if we were obliged to regard\r\nthis outbreak against the constitutional and legal authority of the\r\nGovernment as proceeding from the general feeling of the people in a\r\nspot which is proverbially called \"the Cradle of American Liberty.\"\r\nSuch, undoubtedly, is not the fact. It violates without question the\r\ngeneral sentiment of the people of Boston and of a vast majority of the\r\nwhole people of Massachusetts, as much as it violates the law, defies\r\nthe authority of the Government, and disgraces those concerned in it,\r\ntheir aiders and abettors.\r\n\r\nIt is, nevertheless, my duty to lay before the Senate, in answer to its\r\nresolution, some important facts and considerations connected with the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nA resolution of Congress of September 23, 1789, declared:\r\n\r\n  That it be recommended to the legislatures of the several States to\r\n  pass laws making it expressly the duty of the keepers of their jails\r\n  to receive and safe keep therein all prisoners committed under the\r\n  authority of the United States until they shall be discharged by the\r\n  course of the laws thereof, under the like penalties as in the case of\r\n  prisoners committed under the authority of such States respectively;\r\n  the United States to pay for the use and keeping of such jails at the\r\n  rate of 50 cents per month for each prisoner that shall, under their\r\n  authority, be committed thereto during the time such prisoner shall be\r\n  therein confined, and also to support such of said prisoners as shall\r\n  be committed for offenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nA further resolution of Congress, of the 3d of March, 1791, provides\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  Whereas Congress did, by a resolution of the 23d day of September, 1789,\r\n  recommend to the several States to pass laws making it expressly the\r\n  duty of the keepers of their jails to receive and safe keep therein all\r\n  prisoners committed under the authority of the United States: In order,\r\n  therefore, to insure the administration of justice--\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n  States of America in Congress assembled_, That in case any State shall\r\n  not have complied with the said recommendation the marshal in such\r\n  State, under the direction of the judge of the district, be authorized\r\n  to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail, and to make the\r\n  necessary provision for the safe-keeping of prisoners committed under\r\n  the authority of the United States until permanent provision shall be\r\n  made by law for that purpose; and the said marshal shall be allowed his\r\n  reasonable expenses incurred for the above purposes, to be paid out of\r\n  the Treasury of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd a resolution of Congress of March 3, 1821, provides that--\r\n\r\n  Where any State or States, having complied with the recommendation of\r\n  Congress in the resolution of the 23d day of September, 1789, shall have\r\n  withdrawn, or shall hereafter withdraw, either in whole or in part, the\r\n  use of their jails for prisoners committed under the authority of the\r\n  United States, the marshal in such State or States, under the direction\r\n  of the judge of the district, shall be, and hereby is, authorized and\r\n  required to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail, and to\r\n  make the necessary provision for the safe-keeping of prisoners committed\r\n  under the authority of the United States until permanent provision shall\r\n  be made by law for that purpose; and the said marshal shall be allowed\r\n  his reasonable expenses incurred for the above purposes, to be paid out\r\n  of the Treasury of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese various provisions of the law remain unrepealed.\r\n\r\nBy the law of Massachusetts, as that law stood before the act of the\r\nlegislature of that State of the 24th of March, 1843, the common jails\r\nin the respective counties were to be used for the detention of any\r\npersons detained or committed by the authority of the courts of the\r\nUnited States, as well as by the courts and magistrates of the State.\r\nBut these provisions were abrogated and repealed by the act of the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts of the 24th of March, 1843.\r\n\r\nThat act declares that--\r\n\r\n  No judge of any court of record of this Commonwealth and no justice of\r\n  the peace shall hereafter take cognizance or grant a certificate in\r\n  cases that may arise under the third section of an act of Congress\r\n  passed February 12, 1793, and entitled \"An act respecting fugitives\r\n  from justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters,\"\r\n  to any person who claims any other person as a fugitive slave within\r\n  the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it further declares that--\r\n\r\n  No sheriff, deputy sheriff, coroner, constable, jailer, or other officer\r\n  of this Commonwealth shall hereafter arrest or detain, or aid in the\r\n  arrest or detention or imprisonment, in any jail or other building\r\n  belonging to this Commonwealth, or to any county, city, or town thereof,\r\n  of any person for the reason that he is claimed as a fugitive slave.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it further declares that--\r\n\r\n  Any justice of the peace, sheriff, deputy sheriff, coroner, constable,\r\n  or jailer who shall offend against the provisions of this law by in any\r\n  way acting, directly or indirectly, under the power conferred by the\r\n  third section of the act of Congress aforementioned shall forfeit a sum\r\n  not exceeding $1,000 for every such offense to the use of the county\r\n  where said offense is committed, or shall be subject to imprisonment\r\n  not exceeding one year in the county jail.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis law, it is obvious, had two objects. The first was to make it a\r\npenal offense in all officers and magistrates of the Commonwealth to\r\nexercise the powers conferred on them by the act of Congress of the 12th\r\nof February, 1793, entitled \"An act respecting fugitives from justice\r\nand persons escaping from the service of their masters,\" and which\r\npowers they were fully competent to perform up to the time of this\r\ninhibition and penal enactment; second, to refuse the use of the jails\r\nof the State for the detention of any person claimed as a fugitive\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply to be lamented that the purpose of these enactments is\r\nquite apparent. It was to prevent, as far as the legislature of the\r\nState could prevent, the laws of Congress passed for the purpose of\r\ncarrying into effect that article of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates which declares that \"no person held to service or labor in\r\none State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in\r\nconsequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such\r\nservice or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party\r\nto whom such service or labor may be due\" from being carried into\r\neffect. But these acts of State legislation, although they may cause\r\nembarrassment and create expense, can not derogate either from the duty\r\nor the authority of Congress to carry out fully and fairly the plain and\r\nimperative constitutional provision for the delivery of persons bound to\r\nlabor in one State and escaping into another to the party to whom such\r\nlabor may be due. It is quite clear that by the resolution of Congress\r\nof March 3, 1821, the marshal of the United States in any State in which\r\nthe use of the jails of the State has been withdrawn, in whole or in\r\npart, from the purpose of the detention of persons committed under the\r\nauthority of the United States is not only empowered, but expressly\r\nrequired, under the direction of the judge of the district, to hire\r\na convenient place for the safe-keeping of prisoners committed under\r\nauthority of the United States. It will be seen from papers accompanying\r\nthis communication that the attention of the marshal of Massachusetts\r\nwas distinctly called to this provision of the law by a letter from\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy of the date of October 28 last. There is no\r\nofficial information that the marshal has provided any such place for\r\nthe confinement of his prisoners. If he has not, it is to be regretted\r\nthat this power was not exercised by the marshal under the direction\r\nof the district judge immediately on the passage of the act of the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts of the 24th of March, 1843, and especially\r\nthat it was not exercised on the passage of the fugitive-slave law of\r\nthe last session, or when the attention of the marshal was afterwards\r\nparticularly drawn to it.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the escape from the deputy marshals in this case was not\r\nowing to the want of a prison or place of confinement, but still it is\r\nnot easy to see how the prisoner could have been safely and conveniently\r\ndetained during an adjournment of the hearing for some days without such\r\nplace of confinement. If it shall appear that no such place has been\r\nobtained, directions to the marshal will be given to lose no time in the\r\ndischarge of this duty.\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate the copy of a proclamation issued by me on the\r\n18th instant in relation to these unexpected and deplorable occurrences\r\nin Boston, together with copies of instructions from the Departments of\r\nWar and Navy relative to the general subject. And I communicate also\r\ncopies of telegraphic dispatches transmitted from the Department of\r\nState to the district attorney and marshal of the United States for\r\nthe district of Massachusetts and their answers thereto.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the last branch of the inquiry made by the resolution of\r\nthe Senate, I have to observe that the Constitution declares that \"the\r\nPresident shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" and\r\nthat \"he shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United\r\nStates, and of the militia of the several States when called into the\r\nactual service of the United States,\" and that \"Congress shall have\r\npower to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of\r\nthe Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\" From which it\r\nappears that the Army and Navy are by the Constitution placed under the\r\ncontrol of the Executive; and probably no legislation of Congress could\r\nadd to or diminish the power thus given but by increasing or diminishing\r\nor abolishing altogether the Army and Navy. But not so with the militia.\r\nThe President can not call the militia into service, even to execute the\r\nlaws or repel invasions, but by the authority of acts of Congress passed\r\nfor that purpose. But when the militia are called into service in the\r\nmanner prescribed by law, then the Constitution itself gives the command\r\nto the President. Acting on this principle, Congress, by the act of\r\nFebruary 28, 1795, authorized the President to call forth the militia to\r\nrepel invasion and \"suppress insurrections against a State government,\r\nand to suppress combinations against the laws of the United States, and\r\ncause the laws to be faithfully executed.\" But the act proceeds to\r\ndeclare that whenever it may be necessary, in the judgment of the\r\nPresident, to use the military force thereby directed to be called\r\nforth, the President shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such\r\ninsurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes\r\nwithin a limited time. These words are broad enough to require a\r\nproclamation in all cases where militia are called out under that act,\r\nwhether to repel invasion or suppress an insurrection or to aid in\r\nexecuting the laws. This section has consequently created some doubt\r\nwhether the militia could be called forth to aid in executing the laws\r\nwithout a previous proclamation. But yet the proclamation seems to be in\r\nwords directed only against insurgents, and to require them to disperse,\r\nthereby implying not only an insurrection, but an organized, or at least\r\nan embodied, force. Such a proclamation in aid of the civil authority\r\nwould often defeat the whole object by giving such notice to persons\r\nintended to be arrested that they would be enabled to fly or secrete\r\nthemselves. The force may be wanted sometimes to make the arrest, and\r\nalso sometimes to protect the officer after it is made, and to prevent\r\na rescue. I would therefore suggest that this section be modified by\r\ndeclaring that nothing therein contained shall be construed to require\r\nany previous proclamation when the militia are called forth, either to\r\nrepel invasion, to execute the laws, or suppress combinations against\r\nthem, and that the President may make such call and place such militia\r\nunder the control of any civil officer of the United States to aid him\r\nin executing the laws or suppressing such combinations; and while so\r\nemployed they shall be paid by and subsisted at the expense of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nCongress, not probably adverting to the difference between the militia\r\nand the Regular Army, by the act of March 3, 1807, authorized the\r\nPresident to use the land and naval forces of the United States for the\r\nsame purposes for which he might call forth the militia, and subject\r\nto the same proclamation. But the power of the President under the\r\nConstitution, as Commander of the Army and Navy, is general, and his\r\nduty to see the laws faithfully executed is general and positive; and\r\nthe act of 1807 ought not to be construed as evincing any disposition in\r\nCongress to limit or restrain this constitutional authority. For greater\r\ncertainty, however, it may be well that Congress should modify or\r\nexplain this act in regard to its provisions for the employment of the\r\nArmy and Navy of the United States, as well as that in regard to calling\r\nforth the militia. It is supposed not to be doubtful that all citizens,\r\nwhether enrolled in the militia or not, may be summoned as members of\r\nthe _posse comitatus_, either by the marshal or a commissioner\r\naccording to law, and that it is their duty to obey such summons. But\r\nperhaps it may be doubted whether the marshal or a commissioner can\r\nsummon as the _posse comitatus_ an organized militia force, acting\r\nunder its own appropriate officers, without the consent of such\r\nofficers. This point may deserve the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nI use this occasion to repeat the assurance that so far as depends on me\r\nthe laws shall be faithfully executed and all forcible opposition to\r\nthem suppressed; and to this end I am prepared to exercise, whenever\r\nit may become necessary, the power constitutionally vested in me to\r\nthe fullest extent. I am fully persuaded that the great majority of\r\nthe people of this country are warmly and strongly attached to the\r\nConstitution, the preservation of the Union, the just support of the\r\nGovernment, and the maintenance of the authority of law. I am persuaded\r\nthat their earnest wishes and the line of my constitutional duty\r\nentirely concur, and I doubt not firmness, moderation, and prudence,\r\nstrengthened and animated by the general opinion of the people, will\r\nprevent the repetition of occurrences disturbing the public peace and\r\nreprobated by all good men.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and the Mexican\r\nRepublic for the protection of a transit way across the Isthmus of\r\nTehuantepec, signed in the City of Mexico on the 25th ultimo.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the treaty is a letter from Mr. P.A.

Our country is\r\nat peace with all the world. The agitation which for a time threatened\r\nto disturb the fraternal relations which make us one people is fast\r\nsubsiding, and a year of general prosperity and health has crowned the\r\nnation with unusual blessings. None can look back to the dangers which\r\nare passed or forward to the bright prospect before us without feeling a\r\nthrill of gratification, at the same time that he must be impressed with\r\na grateful sense of our profound obligations to a beneficent Providence,\r\nwhose paternal care is so manifest in the happiness of this highly\r\nfavored land.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the last Congress certain Cubans and other foreigners\r\nresident in the United States, who were more or less concerned in the\r\nprevious invasion of Cuba, instead of being discouraged by its failure\r\nhave again abused the hospitality of this country by making it the scene\r\nof the equipment of another military expedition against that possession\r\nof Her Catholic Majesty, in which they were countenanced, aided, and\r\njoined by citizens of the United States. On receiving intelligence\r\nthat such designs were entertained, I lost no time in issuing such\r\ninstructions to the proper officers of the United States as seemed to\r\nbe called for by the occasion. By the proclamation a copy of which\r\nis herewith submitted I also warned those who might be in danger of\r\nbeing inveigled into this scheme of its unlawful character and of the\r\npenalties which they would incur. For some time there was reason to hope\r\nthat these measures had sufficed to prevent any such attempt. This hope,\r\nhowever, proved to be delusive. Very early in the morning of the 3d of\r\nAugust a steamer called the _Pampero_ departed from New Orleans for\r\nCuba, having on board upward of 400 armed men with evident intentions\r\nto make war upon the authorities of the island. This expedition was\r\nset on foot in palpable violation of the laws of the United States.\r\nIts leader was a Spaniard, and several of the chief officers and some\r\nothers engaged in it were foreigners. The persons composing it, however,\r\nwere mostly citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nBefore the expedition set out, and probably before it was organized,\r\na slight insurrectionary movement, which appears to have been soon\r\nsuppressed, had taken place in the eastern quarter of Cuba. The\r\nimportance of this movement was, unfortunately, so much exaggerated in\r\nthe accounts of it published in this country that these adventurers seem\r\nto have been led to believe that the Creole population of the island not\r\nonly desired to throw off the authority of the mother country, but had\r\nresolved upon that step and had begun a well-concerted enterprise for\r\neffecting it. The persons engaged in the expedition were generally young\r\nand ill informed. The steamer in which they embarked left New Orleans\r\nStealthily and without a clearance. After touching at Key West, she\r\nproceeded to the coast of Cuba, and on the night between the 11th and\r\n12th of August landed the persons on board at Playtas, within about 20\r\nleagues of Havana.\r\n\r\nThe main body of them proceeded to and took possession of an inland\r\nvillage 6 leagues distant, leaving others to follow in charge of the\r\nbaggage as soon as the means of transportation could be obtained. The\r\nlatter, having taken up their line of march to connect themselves with\r\nthe main body, and having proceeded about 4 leagues into the country,\r\nwere attacked on the morning of the 13th by a body of Spanish troops,\r\nand a bloody conflict ensued, after which they retreated to the place of\r\ndisembarkation, where about 50 of them obtained boats and reembarked\r\ntherein. They were, however, intercepted among the keys near the shore\r\nby a Spanish steamer cruising on the coast, captured and carried to\r\nHavana, and after being examined before a military court were sentenced\r\nto be publicly executed, and the sentence was carried into effect on the\r\n16th of August.\r\n\r\nOn receiving information of what had occurred Commodore Foxhall A.\r\nParker was instructed to proceed in the steam frigate _Saranac_ to\r\nHavana and inquire into the charges against the persons executed, the\r\ncircumstances under which they were taken, and whatsoever referred to\r\ntheir trial and sentence. Copies of the instructions from the Department\r\nof State to him and of his letters to that Department are herewith\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nAccording to the record of the examination, the prisoners all admitted\r\nthe offenses charged against them, of being hostile invaders of the\r\nisland. At the time of their trial and execution the main body of the\r\ninvaders was still in the field making war upon the Spanish authorities\r\nand Spanish subjects. After the lapse of some days, being overcome by\r\nthe Spanish troops, they dispersed on the 24th of August. Lopez, their\r\nleader, was captured some days after, and executed on the 1st of\r\nSeptember. Many of his remaining followers were killed or died of hunger\r\nand fatigue, and the rest were made prisoners. Of these none appear\r\nto have been tried or executed. Several of them were pardoned upon\r\napplication of their friends and others, and the rest, about 160 in\r\nnumber, were sent to Spain. Of the final disposition made of these we\r\nhave no official information.\r\n\r\nSuch is the melancholy result of this illegal and ill-fated expedition.\r\nThus thoughtless young men have been induced by false and fraudulent\r\nrepresentations to violate the law of their country through rash and\r\nunfounded expectations of assisting to accomplish political revolutions\r\nin other states, and have lost their lives in the undertaking. Too\r\nsevere a judgment can hardly be passed by the indignant sense of the\r\ncommunity upon those who, being better informed themselves, have yet led\r\naway the ardor of youth and an ill-directed love of political liberty.\r\nThe correspondence between this Government and that of Spain relating\r\nto this transaction is herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nAlthough these offenders against the laws have forfeited the protection\r\nof their country, yet the Government may, so far as consistent with its\r\nobligations to other countries and its fixed purpose to maintain and\r\nenforce the laws, entertain sympathy for their unoffending families and\r\nfriends, as well as a feeling of compassion for themselves. Accordingly,\r\nno proper effort has been spared and none will be spared to procure the\r\nrelease of such citizens of the United States engaged in this unlawful\r\nenterprise as are now in confinement in Spain; but it is to be hoped\r\nthat such interposition with the Government of that country may not be\r\nconsidered as affording any ground of expectation that the Government of\r\nthe United States will hereafter feel itself under any obligation of\r\nduty to intercede for the liberation or pardon of such persons as are\r\nflagrant offenders against the law of nations and the laws of the United\r\nStates. These laws must be executed. If we desire to maintain our\r\nrespectability among the nations of the earth, it behooves us to enforce\r\nsteadily and sternly the neutrality acts passed by Congress and to\r\nfollow as far as may be the violation of those acts with condign\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nBut what gives a peculiar criminality to this invasion of Cuba is that,\r\nunder the lead of Spanish subjects and with the aid of citizens of the\r\nUnited States, it had its origin with many in motives of cupidity. Money\r\nwas advanced by individuals, probably in considerable amounts, to\r\npurchase Cuban bonds, as they have been called, issued by Lopez, sold,\r\ndoubtless, at a very large discount, and for the payment of which the\r\npublic lands and public property of Cuba, of whatever kind, and the\r\nfiscal resources of the people and government of that island, from\r\nwhatever source to be derived, were pledged, as well as the good faith\r\nof the government expected to be established. All these means of\r\npayment, it is evident, were only to be obtained by a process of\r\nbloodshed, war, and revolution. None will deny that those who set on\r\nfoot military expeditions against foreign states by means like these\r\nare far more culpable than the ignorant and the necessitous whom they\r\ninduce to go forth as the ostensible parties in the proceeding. These\r\noriginators of the invasion of Cuba seem to have determined with\r\ncoolness and system upon an undertaking which should disgrace their\r\ncountry, violate its laws, and put to hazard the lives of ill-informed\r\nand deluded men. You will consider whether further legislation be\r\nnecessary to prevent the perpetration of such offenses in future.\r\n\r\nNo individuals have a right to hazard the peace of the country or to\r\nviolate its laws upon vague notions of altering or reforming governments\r\nin other states. This principle is not only reasonable in itself and in\r\naccordance with public law, but is ingrafted into the codes of other\r\nnations as well as our own. But while such are the sentiments of this\r\nGovernment, it may be added that every independent nation must be\r\npresumed to be able to defend its possessions against unauthorized\r\nindividuals banded together to attack them. The Government of the United\r\nStates at all times since its establishment has abstained and has sought\r\nto restrain the citizens of the country from entering into controversies\r\nbetween other powers, and to observe all the duties of neutrality. At an\r\nearly period of the Government, in the Administration of Washington,\r\nseveral laws were passed for this purpose. The main provisions of these\r\nlaws were reenacted by the act of April, 1818, by which, amongst other\r\nthings, it was declared that--\r\n\r\n  If any person shall, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United\r\n  States, begin, or set on foot, or provide or prepare the means for, any\r\n  military expedition or enterprise to be carried on from thence against\r\n  the territory or dominions of any foreign prince or state, or of any\r\n  colony, district, or people, with whom the United States are at peace,\r\n  every person so offending shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor,\r\n  and shall be fined not exceeding $3,000 and imprisoned not more than\r\n  three years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this law has been executed and enforced to the full extent of the\r\npower of the Government from that day to this.\r\n\r\nIn proclaiming and adhering to the doctrine of neutrality and\r\nnonintervention, the United States have not followed the lead of other\r\ncivilized nations; they have taken the lead themselves and have been\r\nfollowed by others. This was admitted by one of the most eminent of\r\nmodern British statesmen, who said in Parliament, while a minister of\r\nthe Crown, \"that if he wished for a guide in a system of neutrality he\r\nshould take that laid down by America in the days of Washington and the\r\nsecretaryship of Jefferson;\" and we see, in fact, that the act of\r\nCongress of 1818 was followed the succeeding year by an act of the\r\nParliament of England substantially the same in its general provisions.\r\nUp to that time there had been no similar law in England, except certain\r\nhighly penal statutes passed in the reign of George II, prohibiting\r\nEnglish subjects from enlisting in foreign service, the avowed object\r\nof which statutes was that foreign armies, raised for the purpose of\r\nrestoring the house of Stuart to the throne, should not be strengthened\r\nby recruits from England herself.\r\n\r\nAll must see that difficulties may arise in carrying the laws referred\r\nto into execution in a country now having 3,000 or 4,000 miles of\r\nseacoast, with an infinite number of ports and harbors and small inlets,\r\nfrom some of which unlawful expeditions may suddenly set forth, without\r\nthe knowledge of Government, against the possessions of foreign states.\r\n\r\n\"Friendly relations with all, but entangling alliances with none,\" has\r\nlong been a maxim with us. Our true mission is not to propagate our\r\nopinions or impose upon other countries our form of government by\r\nartifice or force, but to teach by example and show by our success,\r\nmoderation, and justice the blessings of self-government and the\r\nadvantages of free institutions. Let every people choose for itself and\r\nmake and alter its political institutions to suit its own condition\r\nand convenience. But while we avow and maintain this neutral policy\r\nourselves, we are anxious to see the same forbearance on the part of\r\nother nations whose forms of government are different from our own. The\r\ndeep interest which we feel in the spread of liberal principles and the\r\nestablishment of free governments and the sympathy with which we witness\r\nevery struggle against oppression forbid that we should be indifferent\r\nto a case in which the strong arm of a foreign power is invoked to\r\nstifle public sentiment and repress the spirit of freedom in any\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Governments of Great Britain and France have issued orders to their\r\nnaval commanders on the West India station to prevent, by force if\r\nnecessary, the landing of adventurers from any nation on the island of\r\nCuba with hostile intent. The copy of a memorandum of a conversation on\r\nthis subject between the chargé d'affaires of Her Britannic Majesty and\r\nthe Acting Secretary of State and of a subsequent note of the former to\r\nthe Department of State are herewith submitted, together with a copy of\r\na note of the Acting Secretary of State to the minister of the French\r\nRepublic and of the reply of the latter on the same subject. These\r\npapers will acquaint you with the grounds of this interposition of two\r\nleading commercial powers of Europe, and with the apprehensions, which\r\nthis Government could not fail to entertain, that such interposition, if\r\ncarried into effect, might lead to abuses in derogation of the maritime\r\nrights of the United States. The maritime rights of the United States\r\nare founded on a firm, secure, and well-defined basis; they stand\r\nupon the ground of national independence and public law, and will be\r\nmaintained in all their full and just extent. The principle which this\r\nGovernment has heretofore solemnly announced it still adheres to, and\r\nwill maintain under all circumstances and at all hazards. That principle\r\nis that in every regularly documented merchant vessel the crew who\r\nnavigate it and those on board of it will find their protection in the\r\nflag which is over them. No American ship can be allowed to be visited\r\nor searched for the purpose of ascertaining the character of individuals\r\non board, nor can there be allowed any watch by the vessels of any\r\nforeign nation over American vessels on the coast of the United States\r\nor the seas adjacent thereto. It will be seen by the last communication\r\nfrom the British chargé d'affaires to the Department of State that he\r\nis authorized to assure the Secretary of State that every care will be\r\ntaken that in executing the preventive measures against the expeditions\r\nwhich the United States Government itself has denounced as not being\r\nentitled to the protection of any government no interference shall take\r\nplace with the lawful commerce of any nation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the correspondence on this subject herewith submitted,\r\nofficial information has been received at the Department of State of\r\nassurances by the French Government that in the orders given to the\r\nFrench naval forces they were expressly instructed, in any operations\r\nthey might engage in, to respect the flag of the United States wherever\r\nit might appear, and to commit no act of hostility upon any vessel or\r\narmament under its protection.\r\n\r\nMinisters and consuls of foreign nations are the means and agents of\r\ncommunication between us and those nations, and it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that while residing in the country they should feel a perfect\r\nsecurity so long as they faithfully discharge their respective duties\r\nand are guilty of no violation of our laws. This is the admitted law of\r\nnations and no country has a deeper interest in maintaining it than the\r\nUnited States. Our commerce spreads over every sea and visits every\r\nclime, and our ministers and consuls are appointed to protect the\r\ninterests of that commerce as well as to guard the peace of the country\r\nand maintain the honor of its flag. But how can they discharge these\r\nduties unless they be themselves protected? And if protected it must be\r\nby the laws of the country in which they reside. And what is due to our\r\nown public functionaries residing in foreign nations is exactly the\r\nmeasure of what is due to the functionaries of other governments\r\nresiding here. As in war the bearers of flags of truce are sacred,\r\nor else wars would be interminable, so in peace ambassadors, public\r\nministers, and consuls, charged with friendly national intercourse,\r\nare objects of especial respect and protection, each according to the\r\nrights belonging to his rank and station. In view of these important\r\nprinciples, it is with deep mortification and regret I announce to you\r\nthat during the excitement growing out of the executions at Havana the\r\noffice of Her Catholic Majesty's consul at New Orleans was assailed by\r\na mob, his property destroyed, the Spanish flag found in the office\r\ncarried off and torn in pieces, and he himself induced to flee for\r\nhis personal safety, which he supposed to be in danger. On receiving\r\nintelligence of these events I forthwith directed the attorney of the\r\nUnited States residing at New Orleans to inquire into the facts and the\r\nextent of the pecuniary loss sustained by the consul, with the intention\r\nof laying them before you, that you might make provision for such\r\nindemnity to him as a just regard for the honor of the nation and the\r\nrespect which is due to a friendly power might, in your judgment, seem\r\nto require. The correspondence upon this subject between the Secretary\r\nof State and Her Catholic Majesty's minister plenipotentiary is herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence at New Orleans has led me to give my attention to the\r\nstate of our laws in regard to foreign ambassadors, ministers, and\r\nconsuls. I think the legislation of the country is deficient in not\r\nproviding sufficiently either for the protection or the punishment of\r\nconsuls. I therefore recommend the subject to the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nYour attention is again invited to the question of reciprocal trade\r\nbetween the United States and Canada and other British possessions near\r\nour frontier. Overtures for a convention upon this subject have been\r\nreceived from Her Britannic Majesty's minister plenipotentiary, but\r\nit seems to be in many respects preferable that the matter should be\r\nregulated by reciprocal legislation. Documents are laid before you\r\nshowing the terms which the British Government is willing to offer and\r\nthe measures which it may adopt if some arrangement upon this subject\r\nshall not be made.\r\n\r\nFrom the accompanying copy of a note from the British legation at\r\nWashington and the reply of the Department of State thereto it will\r\nappear that Her Britannic Majesty's Government is desirous that a part\r\nof the boundary line between Oregon and the British possessions should\r\nbe authoritatively marked out, and that an intention was expressed to\r\napply to Congress for an appropriation to defray the expense thereof\r\non the part of the United States. Your attention to this subject is\r\naccordingly invited and a proper appropriation recommended.\r\n\r\nA convention for the adjustment of claims of citizens of the United\r\nStates against Portugal has been concluded and the ratifications have\r\nbeen exchanged. The first installment of the amount to be paid by\r\nPortugal fell due on the 30th of September last and has been paid.\r\n\r\nThe President of the French Republic, according to the provisions of the\r\nconvention, has been selected as arbiter in the case of the _General\r\nArmstrong_, and has signified that he accepts the trust and the high\r\nsatisfaction he feels in acting as the common friend of two nations with\r\nwhich France is united by sentiments of sincere and lasting amity.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Government has expressed its thanks for the kind reception\r\ngiven to the Sultan's agent, Amin Bey, on the occasion of his recent\r\nvisit to the United States. On the 28th of February last a dispatch was\r\naddressed by the Secretary of State to Mr. Marsh, the American minister\r\nat Constantinople, instructing him to ask of the Turkish Government\r\npermission for the Hungarians then imprisoned within the dominions of\r\nthe Sublime Porte to remove to this country. On the 3d of March last\r\nboth Houses of Congress passed a resolution requesting the President to\r\nauthorize the employment of a public vessel to convey to this country\r\nLouis Kossuth and his associates in captivity.\r\n\r\nThe instruction above referred to was complied with, and the Turkish\r\nGovernment having released Governor Kossuth and his companions from\r\nprison, on the 10th of September last they embarked on board of the\r\nUnited States steam frigate _Mississippi_, which was selected to carry\r\ninto effect the resolution of Congress. Governor Kossuth left the\r\n_Mississippi_ at Gibraltar for the purpose of making a visit to England,\r\nand may shortly be expected in New York. By communications to the\r\nDepartment of State he has expressed his grateful acknowledgments for\r\nthe interposition of this Government in behalf of himself and his\r\nassociates. This country has been justly regarded as a safe asylum for\r\nthose whom political events have exiled from their own homes in Europe,\r\nand it is recommended to Congress to consider in what manner Governor\r\nKossuth and his companions, brought hither by its authority, shall be\r\nreceived and treated.\r\n\r\nIt is earnestly to be hoped that the differences which have for some\r\ntime past been pending between the Government of the French Republic and\r\nthat of the Sandwich Islands may be peaceably and durably adjusted so\r\nas to secure the independence of those islands. Long before the events\r\nwhich have of late imparted so much importance to the possessions of the\r\nUnited States on the Pacific we acknowledged the independence of the\r\nHawaiian Government. This Government was first in taking that step, and\r\nseveral of the leading powers of Europe immediately followed. We were\r\ninfluenced in this measure by the existing and prospective importance of\r\nthe islands as a place of refuge and refreshment for our vessels engaged\r\nin the whale fishery, and by the consideration that they lie in the\r\ncourse of the great trade which must at no distant day be carried on\r\nbetween the western coast of North America and eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nWe were also influenced by a desire that those islands should not pass\r\nunder the control of any other great maritime state, but should remain\r\nin an independent condition, and so be accessible and useful to the\r\ncommerce of all nations. I need not say that the importance of these\r\nconsiderations has been greatly enhanced by the sudden and vast\r\ndevelopment which the interests of the United States have attained in\r\nCalifornia and Oregon, and the policy heretofore adopted in regard to\r\nthose islands will be steadily pursued.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying, not only to those who consider the commercial interests\r\nof nations, but also to all who favor the progress of knowledge and the\r\ndiffusion of religion, to see a community emerge from a savage state and\r\nattain such a degree of civilization in those distant seas.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be deplored that the internal tranquillity of the Mexican\r\nRepublic should again be seriously disturbed, for since the peace\r\nbetween that Republic and the United States it had enjoyed such\r\ncomparative repose that the most favorable anticipations for the future\r\nmight with a degree of confidence have been indulged. These, however,\r\nhave been thwarted by the recent outbreak in the State of Tamaulipas,\r\non the right bank of the Rio Bravo. Having received information that\r\npersons from the United States had taken part in the insurrection,\r\nand apprehending that their example might be followed by others, I\r\ncaused orders to be issued for the purpose of preventing any hostile\r\nexpeditions against Mexico from being set on foot in violation of the\r\nlaws of the United States. I likewise issued a proclamation upon the\r\nsubject, a copy of which is herewith laid before you. This appeared to\r\nbe rendered imperative by the obligations of treaties and the general\r\nduties of good neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I informed Congress that citizens of the\r\nUnited States had undertaken the connection of the two oceans by means\r\nof a railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, under a grant of\r\nthe Mexican Government to a citizen of that Republic, and that this\r\nenterprise would probably be prosecuted with energy whenever Mexico\r\nshould consent to such stipulations with the Government of the United\r\nStates as should impart a feeling of security to those who should invest\r\ntheir property in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nA convention between the two Governments for the accomplishment of that\r\nend has been ratified by this Government, and only awaits the decision\r\nof the Congress and the Executive of that Republic.\r\n\r\nSome unexpected difficulties and delays have arisen in the ratification\r\nof that convention by Mexico, but it is to be presumed that her decision\r\nwill be governed by just and enlightened views, as well of the general\r\nimportance of the object as of her own interests and obligations.\r\n\r\nIn negotiating upon this important subject this Government has had\r\nin view one, and only one, object. That object has been, and is,\r\nthe construction or attainment of a passage from ocean to ocean, the\r\nshortest and the best for travelers and merchandise, and equally open to\r\nall the world. It has sought to obtain no territorial acquisition, nor\r\nany advantages peculiar to itself; and it would see with the greatest\r\nregret that Mexico should oppose any obstacle to the accomplishment of\r\nan enterprise which promises so much convenience to the whole commercial\r\nworld and such eminent advantages to Mexico herself. Impressed with\r\nthese sentiments and these convictions, the Government will continue to\r\nexert all proper efforts to bring about the necessary arrangement with\r\nthe Republic of Mexico for the speedy completion of the work.\r\n\r\nFor some months past the Republic of Nicaragua has been the theater of\r\none of those civil convulsions from which the cause of free institutions\r\nand the general prosperity and social progress of the States of Central\r\nAmerica have so often and so severely suffered. Until quiet shall have\r\nbeen restored and a government apparently stable shall have been\r\norganized, no advance can prudently be made in disposing of the\r\nquestions pending between the two countries.\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce that an interoceanic communication from the\r\nmouth of the St. John to the Pacific has been so far accomplished as\r\nthat passengers have actually traversed it and merchandise has been\r\ntransported over it, and when the canal shall have been completed\r\naccording to the original plan the means of communication will be\r\nfurther improved. It is understood that a considerable part of the\r\nrailroad across the Isthmus of Panama has been completed, and that\r\nthe mail and passengers will in future be conveyed thereon.\r\n\r\nWhichever of the several routes between the two oceans may ultimately\r\nprove most eligible for travelers to and from the different States on\r\nthe Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and our coast on the Pacific, there is\r\nlittle reason to doubt that all of them will be useful to the public,\r\nand will liberally reward that individual enterprise by which alone they\r\nhave been or are expected to be carried into effect.\r\n\r\nPeace has been concluded between the contending parties in the island of\r\nSt. Domingo, and, it is hoped, upon a durable basis. Such is the extent\r\nof our commercial relations with that island that the United States can\r\nnot fail to feel a strong interest in its tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe office of commissioner to China remains unfilled. Several persons\r\nhave been appointed, and the place has been offered to others, all of\r\nwhom have declined its acceptance on the ground of the inadequacy of the\r\ncompensation. The annual allowance by law is $6,000, and there is no\r\nprovision for any outfit. I earnestly recommend the consideration of\r\nthis subject to Congress. Our commerce with China is highly important,\r\nand is becoming more and more so in consequence of the increasing\r\nintercourse between our ports on the Pacific Coast and eastern Asia.\r\nChina is understood to be a country in which living is very expensive,\r\nand I know of no reason why the American commissioner sent thither\r\nshould not be placed, in regard to compensation, on an equal footing\r\nwith ministers who represent this country at the Courts of Europe.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury it will be\r\nseen that the aggregate receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to\r\n$52,312,979.87, which, with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st July,\r\n1850, gave as the available means for the year the sum of\r\n$58,917,524.36.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for the same period were $48,005,878.68. The\r\ntotal imports for the year ending June 30, 1851, were $215,725,995,\r\nof which there were in specie $4,967,901. The exports for the same\r\nperiod were $217,517,130, of which there were of domestic products\r\n$178,546,555; foreign goods reexported, $9,738,695; specie, $29,231,880.\r\n\r\nSince the 1st of December last the payments in cash on account of the\r\npublic debt, exclusive of interest, have amounted to $7,501,456.56,\r\nwhich, however, includes the sum of $3,242,400, paid under the twelfth\r\narticle of the treaty with Mexico, and the further sum of $2,591,213.45,\r\nbeing the amount of awards to American citizens under the late treaty\r\nwith Mexico, for which the issue of stock was authorized, but which was\r\npaid in cash from the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the 20th ultimo, exclusive of the stock authorized\r\nto be issued to Texas by the act of 9th September, 1850, was\r\n$62,560,395.26.\r\n\r\nThe receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated at $51,800,000,\r\nwhich, with the probable unappropriated balance in the Treasury on the\r\n30th June next, will give as the probable available means for that year\r\nthe sum of $63,258,743.09.\r\n\r\nIt has been deemed proper, in view of the large expenditures consequent\r\nupon the acquisition of territory from Mexico, that the estimates for\r\nthe next fiscal year should be laid before Congress in such manner as\r\nto distinguish the expenditures so required from the otherwise ordinary\r\ndemands upon the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated at\r\n$42,892,299.19, of which there is required for the ordinary purposes of\r\nthe Government, other than those consequent upon the acquisition of our\r\nnew territories, and deducting the payments on account of the public\r\ndebt, the sum of $33,343,198.08, and for the purposes connected,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, with those territories and in the fulfillment of\r\nthe obligations of the Government contracted in consequence of their\r\nacquisition the sum of $9,549,101.11.\r\n\r\nIf the views of the Secretary of the Treasury in reference to the\r\nexpenditures required for these territories shall be met by\r\ncorresponding action on the part of Congress, and appropriations made in\r\naccordance therewith, there will be an estimated unappropriated balance\r\nin the Treasury on the 30th June, 1853, of $20,366,443.90 wherewith to\r\nmeet that portion of the public debt due on the 1st of July following,\r\namounting to $6,237,931.35, as well as any appropriations which may be\r\nmade beyond the estimates.\r\n\r\nIn thus referring to the estimated expenditures on account of our newly\r\nacquired territories, I may express the hope that Congress will concur\r\nwith me in the desire that a liberal course of policy may be pursued\r\ntoward them, and that every obligation, express or implied, entered into\r\nin consequence of their acquisition shall be fulfilled by the most\r\nliberal appropriations for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe values of our domestic exports for the last fiscal year, as compared\r\nwith those of the previous year, exhibit an increase of $43,646,322. At\r\nfirst view this condition of our trade with foreign nations would seem\r\nto present the most flattering hopes of its future prosperity. An\r\nexamination of the details of our exports, however, will show that the\r\nincreased value of our exports for the last fiscal year is to be found\r\nin the high price of cotton which prevailed during the first half of\r\nthat year, which price has since declined about one-half.\r\n\r\nThe value of our exports of breadstuffs and provisions, which it was\r\nsupposed the incentive of a low tariff and large importations from\r\nabroad would have greatly augmented, has fallen from $68,701,921 in\r\n1847 to $26,051,373 in 1850 and to $21,948,653 in 1851, with a strong\r\nprobability, amounting almost to a certainty, of a still further\r\nreduction in the current year.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate values of rice exported during the last fiscal year, as\r\ncompared with the previous year, also exhibit a decrease, amounting to\r\n$460,917, which, with a decline in the values of the exports of tobacco\r\nfor the same period, make an aggregate decrease in these two articles of\r\n$1,156,751.\r\n\r\nThe policy which dictated a low rate of duties on foreign merchandise,\r\nit was thought by those who promoted and established it, would tend to\r\nbenefit the farming population of this country by increasing the demand\r\nand raising the price of agricultural products in foreign markets.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts, however, seem to show incontestably that no such\r\nresult has followed the adoption of this policy. On the contrary,\r\nnotwithstanding the repeal of the restrictive corn laws in England, the\r\nforeign demand for the products of the American farmer has steadily\r\ndeclined, since the short crops and consequent famine in a portion\r\nof Europe have been happily replaced by full crops and comparative\r\nabundance of food.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by recurring to the commercial statistics for the past\r\nyear that the value of our domestic exports has been increased in the\r\nsingle item of raw cotton by $40,000,000 over the value of that export\r\nfor the year preceding. This is not due to any increased general demand\r\nfor that article, but to the short crop of the preceding year, which\r\ncreated an increased demand and an augmented price for the crop of last\r\nyear. Should the cotton crop now going forward to market be only equal\r\nin quantity to that of the year preceding and be sold at the present\r\nprices, then there would be a falling off in the value of our exports\r\nfor the present fiscal year of at least $40,000,000 compared with the\r\namount exported for the year ending 30th June, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe production of gold in California for the past year seems to promise\r\na large supply of that metal from that quarter for some time to come.\r\nThis large annual increase of the currency of the world must be attended\r\nwith its usual results. These have been already partially disclosed\r\nin the enhancement of prices and a rising spirit of speculation and\r\nadventure, tending to overtrading, as well at home as abroad. Unless\r\nsome salutary check shall be given to these tendencies it is to be\r\nfeared that importations of foreign goods beyond a healthy demand in\r\nthis country will lead to a sudden drain of the precious metals from us,\r\nbringing with it, as it has done in former times, the most disastrous\r\nconsequences to the business and capital of the American people.\r\n\r\nThe exports of specie to liquidate our foreign debt during the past\r\nfiscal year have been $24,263,979 over the amount of specie imported.\r\nThe exports of specie during the first quarter of the present fiscal\r\nyear have been $14,651,827. Should specie continue to be exported at\r\nthis rate for the remaining three quarters of this year, it will drain\r\nfrom our metallic currency during the year ending 30th June, 1852, the\r\nenormous amount of $58,607,308.\r\n\r\nIn the present prosperous condition of the national finances it will\r\nbecome the duty of Congress to consider the best mode of paying off the\r\npublic debt. If the present and anticipated surplus in the Treasury\r\nshould not be absorbed by appropriations of an extraordinary character,\r\nthis surplus should be employed in such way and under such restrictions\r\nas Congress may enact in extinguishing the outstanding debt of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the act of Congress approved 9th September, 1850, it\r\nwill be seen that, in consideration of certain concessions by the State\r\nof Texas, it is provided that--\r\n\r\n  The United States shall pay to the State of Texas the sum of $10,000,000\r\n  in a stock bearing 5 per cent interest and redeemable at the end of\r\n  fourteen years, the interest payable half-yearly at the Treasury of\r\n  the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the same section of the law it is further provided--\r\n\r\n  That no more than five millions of said stock shall be issued until the\r\n  creditors of the State holding bonds and other certificates of stock of\r\n  Texas, _for which duties on imports were specially_ pledged, shall first\r\n  file at the Treasury of the United States releases of all claims against\r\n  the United States for or on account of said bonds or certificates, in\r\n  such form as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury and\r\n  approved by the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe form of release thus provided for has been prescribed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and approved. It has been published in all\r\nthe leading newspapers in the commercial cities of the United States,\r\nand all persons holding claims of the kind specified in the foregoing\r\nproviso were required to file their releases (in the form thus\r\nprescribed) in the Treasury of the United States on or before the 1st\r\nday of October, 1851. Although this publication has been continued\r\nfrom the 25th day of March, 1851, yet up to the 1st of October last\r\ncomparatively few releases had been filed by the creditors of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the State of Texas, at the request of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, have furnished a schedule of the public debt of that\r\nState created prior to her admission into the Union, with a copy of the\r\nlaws under which each class was contracted.\r\n\r\nI have, from the documents furnished by the State of Texas, determined\r\nthe classes of claims which in my judgment fall within the provisions of\r\nthe act of Congress of the 9th of September, 1850.\r\n\r\nOn being officially informed of the acceptance by Texas of the\r\npropositions contained in the act referred to I caused the stock to be\r\nprepared, and the five millions which are to be issued unconditionally,\r\nbearing an interest of 5 per cent from the 1st day of January, 1851,\r\nhave been for some time ready to be delivered to the State of Texas. The\r\nauthorities of Texas up to the present time have not authorized anyone\r\nto receive this stock, and it remains in the Treasury Department subject\r\nto the order of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe releases required by law to be deposited in the Treasury not having\r\nbeen filed there, the remaining five millions have not been issued.\r\nThis last amount of the stock will be withheld from Texas until the\r\nconditions upon which it is to be delivered shall be complied with by\r\nthe creditors of that State, unless Congress shall otherwise direct by\r\na modification of the law.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message, to which I respectfully refer, I stated\r\nbriefly the reasons which induced me to recommend a modification of\r\nthe present tariff by converting the _ad valorem_ into a specific duty\r\nwherever the article imported was of such a character as to permit it,\r\nand that such a discrimination should be made in favor of the industrial\r\npursuits of our own country as to encourage home production without\r\nexcluding foreign competition.\r\n\r\nThe numerous frauds which continue to be practiced upon the revenue by\r\nfalse invoices and undervaluations constitute an unanswerable reason for\r\nadopting specific instead of _ad valorem_ duties in all cases where the\r\nnature of the commodity does not forbid it. A striking illustration of\r\nthese frauds will be exhibited in the report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, showing the custom-house valuation of articles imported under\r\na former law, subject to specific duties, when there was no inducement\r\nto undervaluation, and the custom-house valuations of the same articles\r\nunder the present system of _ad valorem_ duties, so greatly reduced\r\nas to leave no doubt of the existence of the most flagrant abuses under\r\nthe existing laws. This practical evasion of the present law, combined\r\nwith the languishing condition of some of the great interests of the\r\ncountry, caused by overimportations and consequent depressed prices,\r\nand with the failure in obtaining a foreign market for our increasing\r\nsurplus of breadstuffs and provisions, has induced me again to recommend\r\na modification of the existing tariff.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, which accompanies this\r\ncommunication, will present a condensed statement of the operations\r\nof that important Department of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the cash sales of the public lands exceed those\r\nof the preceding year, and that there is reason to anticipate a still\r\nfurther increase, notwithstanding the large donations which have been\r\nmade to many of the States and the liberal grants to individuals as\r\na reward for military services. This fact furnishes very gratifying\r\nevidence of the growing wealth and prosperity of our country.\r\n\r\nSuitable measures have been adopted for commencing the survey of the\r\npublic lands in California and Oregon. Surveying parties have been\r\norganized and some progress has been made in establishing the principal\r\nbase and meridian lines. But further legislation and additional\r\nappropriations will be necessary before the proper subdivisions can\r\nbe made and the general land system extended over those remote parts\r\nof our territory.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of March last an act was passed providing for the appointment\r\nof three commissioners to settle private land claims in California.\r\nThree persons were immediately appointed, all of whom, however,\r\ndeclined accepting the office in consequence of the inadequacy of the\r\ncompensation. Others were promptly selected, who for the same reason\r\nalso declined, and it was not until late in the season that the services\r\nof suitable persons could be secured. A majority of the commissioners\r\nconvened in this city on the 10th of September last, when detailed\r\ninstructions were given to them in regard to their duties. Their first\r\nmeeting for the transaction of business will be held in San Francisco\r\non the 8th day of the present month.\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper to refer to these facts, not only to explain\r\nthe causes of the delay in filling the commission, but to call your\r\nattention to the propriety of increasing the compensation of the\r\ncommissioners. The office is one of great labor and responsibility,\r\nand the compensation should be such as to command men of a high order\r\nof talents and the most unquestionable integrity.\r\n\r\nThe proper disposal of the mineral lands of California is a subject\r\nsurrounded by great difficulties. In my last annual message I\r\nrecommended the survey and sale of them in small parcels under\r\nsuch restrictions as would effectually guard against monopoly and\r\nspeculation; but upon further information, and in deference to the\r\nopinions of persons familiar with the subject, I am inclined to change\r\nthat recommendation and to advise that they be permitted to remain as at\r\npresent, a common field, open to the enterprise and industry of all our\r\ncitizens, until further experience shall have developed the best policy\r\nto be ultimately adopted in regard to them. It is safer to suffer the\r\ninconveniences that now exist for a short period than by premature\r\nlegislation to fasten on the country a system founded in error, which\r\nmay place the whole subject beyond the future control of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural lands should, however, be surveyed and brought into\r\nmarket with as little delay as possible, that the titles may become\r\nsettled and the inhabitants stimulated to make permanent improvements\r\nand enter on the ordinary pursuits of life. To effect these objects\r\nit is desirable that the necessary provision be made by law for the\r\nestablishment of land offices in California and Oregon and for the\r\nefficient prosecution of the surveys at an early day.\r\n\r\nSome difficulties have occurred in organizing the Territorial\r\ngovernments of New Mexico and Utah, and when more accurate information\r\nshall be obtained of the causes a further communication will be made on\r\nthat subject.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual communication to Congress I recommended the\r\nestablishment of an agricultural bureau, and I take this occasion\r\nagain to invoke your favorable consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nAgriculture may justly be regarded as the great interest of our people.\r\nFour-fifths of our active population are employed in the cultivation of\r\nthe soil, and the rapid expansion of our settlements over new territory\r\nis daily adding to the number of those engaged in that vocation. Justice\r\nand sound policy, therefore, alike require that the Government should\r\nuse all the means authorized by the Constitution to promote the\r\ninterests and welfare of that important class of our fellow-citizens.\r\nAnd yet it is a singular fact that whilst the manufacturing and\r\ncommercial interests have engaged the attention of Congress during a\r\nlarge portion of every session and our statutes abound in provisions for\r\ntheir protection and encouragement, little has yet been done directly\r\nfor the advancement of agriculture. It is time that this reproach to our\r\nlegislation should be removed, and I sincerely hope that the present\r\nCongress will not close their labors without adopting efficient means\r\nto supply the omissions of those who have preceded them.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural bureau, charged with the duty of collecting and\r\ndisseminating correct information as to the best modes of cultivation\r\nand of the most effectual means of preserving and restoring the\r\nfertility of the soil and of procuring and distributing seeds and plants\r\nand other vegetable productions, with instructions in regard to the\r\nsoil, climate, and treatment best adapted to their growth, could not\r\nfail to be, in the language of Washington in his last annual message\r\nto Congress, a \"very cheap instrument of immense national benefit.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the act of Congress approved 28th September, 1850, granting\r\nbounty lands to persons who had been engaged in the military service of\r\nthe country, as a great measure of national justice and munificence,\r\nan anxious desire has been felt by the officers intrusted with its\r\nimmediate execution to give prompt effect to its provisions. All the\r\nmeans within their control were therefore brought into requisition\r\nto expedite the adjudication of claims, and I am gratified to be\r\nable to state that near 100,000 applications have been considered\r\nand about 70,000 warrants issued within the short space of nine\r\nmonths. If adequate provision be made by law to carry into effect\r\nthe recommendations of the Department, it is confidently expected\r\nthat before the close of the next fiscal year all who are entitled\r\nto the benefits of the act will have received their warrants.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has suggested in his report various\r\namendments of the laws relating to pensions and bounty lands for the\r\npurpose of more effectually guarding against abuses and frauds on the\r\nGovernment, to all of which I invite your particular attention.\r\n\r\nThe large accessions to our Indian population consequent upon the\r\nacquisition of New Mexico and California and the extension of our\r\nsettlements into Utah and Oregon have given increased interest and\r\nimportance to our relations with the aboriginal race.\r\n\r\nNo material change has taken place within the last year in the condition\r\nand prospects of the Indian tribes who reside in the Northwestern\r\nTerritory and west of the Mississippi River. We are at peace with all of\r\nthem, and it will be a source of pleasure to you to learn that they are\r\ngradually advancing in civilization and the pursuits of social life.\r\n\r\nAlong the Mexican frontier and in California and Oregon there have been\r\noccasional manifestations of unfriendly feeling and some depredations\r\ncommitted. I am satisfied, however, that they resulted more from the\r\ndestitute and starving condition of the Indians than from any settled\r\nhostility toward the whites. As the settlements of our citizens progress\r\ntoward them, the game, upon which they mainly rely for subsistence,\r\nis driven off or destroyed, and the only alternative left to them\r\nis starvation or plunder. It becomes us to consider, in view of this\r\ncondition of things, whether justice and humanity, as well as an\r\nenlightened economy, do not require that instead of seeking to punish\r\nthem for offenses which are the result of our own policy toward them\r\nwe should not provide for their immediate wants and encourage them to\r\nengage in agriculture and to rely on their labor instead of the chase\r\nfor the means of support.\r\n\r\nVarious important treaties have been negotiated with different tribes\r\nduring the year, by which their title to large and valuable tracts of\r\ncountry has been extinguished, all of which will at the proper time be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo has been\r\nactively engaged in running and marking the boundary line between the\r\nUnited States and Mexico. It was stated in the last annual report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior that the initial point on the Pacific\r\nand the point of junction of the Gila with the Colorado River had been\r\ndetermined and the intervening line, about 150 miles in length, run and\r\nmarked by temporary monuments. Since that time a monument of marble has\r\nbeen erected at the initial point, and permanent landmarks of iron have\r\nbeen placed at suitable distances along the line.\r\n\r\nThe initial point on the Rio Grande has also been fixed by the\r\ncommissioners, at latitude 32° 22', and at the date of the last\r\ncommunication the purvey of the line had been made thence westward\r\nabout 150 miles to the neighborhood of the copper mines.\r\n\r\nThe commission on our part was at first organized on a scale which\r\nexperience proved to be unwieldy and attended with unnecessary expense.\r\nOrders have therefore been issued for the reduction of the number of\r\npersons employed within the smallest limits consistent with the safety\r\nof those engaged in the service and the prompt and efficient execution\r\nof their important duties.\r\n\r\nReturns have been received from all the officers engaged in taking\r\nthe census in the States and Territories except California. The\r\nsuperintendent employed to make the enumeration in that State has\r\nnot yet made his full report, from causes, as he alleges, beyond his\r\ncontrol. This failure is much to be regretted, as it has prevented the\r\nSecretary of the Interior from making the decennial apportionment of\r\nRepresentatives among the States, as required by the act approved May\r\n23, 1850. It is hoped, however, that the returns will soon be received,\r\nand no time will then be lost in making the necessary apportionment and\r\nin transmitting the certificates required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of the Seventh Census is diligently employed, under\r\nthe direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in classifying and\r\narranging in tabular form all the statistical information derived from\r\nthe returns of the marshals, and it is believed that when the work shall\r\nbe completed it will exhibit a more perfect view of the population,\r\nwealth, occupations, and social condition of a great country than has\r\never been presented to the world. The value of such a work as the basis\r\nof enlightened legislation can hardly be overestimated, and I earnestly\r\nhope that Congress will lose no time in making the appropriations\r\nnecessary to complete the classifications and to publish the results\r\nin a style worthy of the subject and of our national character.\r\n\r\nThe want of a uniform fee bill, prescribing the compensation to be\r\nallowed district attorneys, clerks, marshals, and commissioners in civil\r\nand criminal cases, is the cause of much vexation, injustice, and\r\ncomplaint. I would recommend a thorough revision of the laws on the\r\nwhole subject and the adoption of a tariff of fees which, as far as\r\npracticable, should be uniform, and prescribe a specific compensation\r\nfor every service which the officer may be required to perform. This\r\nsubject will be fully presented in the report of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I gave briefly my reasons for believing that\r\nyou possessed the constitutional power to improve the harbors of our\r\nGreat Lakes and seacoast and the navigation of our principal rivers, and\r\nrecommended that appropriations should be made for completing such works\r\nas had already been commenced and for commencing such others as might\r\nseem to the wisdom of Congress to be of public and general importance.\r\nWithout repeating the reasons then urged, I deem it my duty again to\r\ncall your attention to this important subject. The works on many of the\r\nharbors were left in an unfinished state, and consequently exposed to\r\nthe action of the elements, which is fast destroying them. Great numbers\r\nof lives and vast amounts of property are annually lost for want of\r\nsafe and convenient harbors on the Lakes. None but those who have been\r\nexposed to that dangerous navigation can fully appreciate the importance\r\nof this subject. The whole Northwest appeals to you for relief, and\r\nI trust their appeal will receive due consideration at your hands.\r\n\r\nThe same is in a measure true in regard to some of the harbors and\r\ninlets on the seacoast.\r\n\r\nThe unobstructed navigation of our large rivers is of equal importance.\r\nOur settlements are now extending to the sources of the great rivers\r\nwhich empty into and form a part of the Mississippi, and the value of\r\nthe public lands in those regions would be greatly enhanced by freeing\r\nthe navigation of those waters from obstructions. In view, therefore,\r\nof this great interest, I deem it my duty again to urge upon Congress\r\nto make such appropriations for these improvements as they may deem\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe surveys of the Delta of the Mississippi, with a view to the\r\nprevention of the overflows that have proved so disastrous to that\r\nregion of country, have been nearly completed, and the reports thereof\r\nare now in course of preparation and will shortly be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe protection of our southwestern frontier and of the adjacent Mexican\r\nStates against the Indian tribes within our border has claimed my\r\nearnest and constant attention. Congress having failed at the last\r\nsession to adopt my recommendation that an additional regiment of\r\nmounted men specially adapted to that service should be raised, all\r\nthat remained to be done was to make the best use of the means at my\r\ndisposal. Accordingly, all the troops adapted to that service that could\r\nproperly be spared from other quarters have been concentrated on that\r\nfrontier and officers of high reputation selected to command them. A new\r\narrangement of the military posts has also been made, whereby the troops\r\nare brought nearer to the Mexican frontier and to the tribes they are\r\nintended to overawe.\r\n\r\nSufficient time has not yet elapsed to realize all the benefits that are\r\nexpected to result from these arrangements, but I have every reason to\r\nhope that they will effectually check their marauding expeditions. The\r\nnature of the country, which furnishes little for the support of an army\r\nand abounds in places of refuge and concealment, is remarkably well\r\nadapted to this predatory warfare, and we can scarcely hope that any\r\nmilitary force, combined with the greatest vigilance, can entirely\r\nsuppress it.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo we are bound to protect the territory\r\nof Mexico against the incursions of the savage tribes within our border\r\n\"with equal diligence and energy\" as if the same were made within our\r\nterritory or against our citizens. I have endeavored to comply as far\r\nas possible with this provision of the treaty. Orders have been given\r\nto the officers commanding on that frontier to consider the Mexican\r\nterritory and its inhabitants as equally with our own entitled to their\r\nprotection, and to make all their plans and arrangements with a view\r\nto the attainment of this object. Instructions have also been given to\r\nthe Indian commissioners and agents among these tribes in all treaties\r\nto make the clauses designed for the protection of our own citizens\r\napply also to those of Mexico. I have no reason to doubt that these\r\ninstructions have been fully carried into effect; nevertheless, it is\r\nprobable that in spite of all our efforts some of the neighboring States\r\nof Mexico may have suffered, as our own have, from depredations by the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nTo the difficulties of defending our own territory, as above mentioned,\r\nare superadded, in defending that of Mexico, those that arise from its\r\nremoteness, from the fact that we have no right to station our troops\r\nwithin her limits and that there is no efficient military force on the\r\nMexican side to cooperate with our own. So long as this shall continue\r\nto be the case the number and activity of our troops will rather\r\nincrease than diminish the evil, as the Indians will naturally turn\r\ntoward that country where they encounter the least resistance. Yet these\r\ntroops are necessary to subdue them and to compel them to make and\r\nobserve treaties. Until this shall have been done neither country will\r\nenjoy any security from their attacks.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in California, who had previously appeared of a peaceable\r\ncharacter and disposed to cultivate the friendship of the whites, have\r\nrecently committed several acts of hostility. As a large portion of the\r\nreenforcements sent to the Mexican frontier were drawn from the Pacific,\r\nthe military force now stationed there is considered entirely inadequate\r\nto its defense. It can not be increased, however, without an increase of\r\nthe Army, and I again recommend that measure as indispensable to the\r\nprotection of the frontier.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the suggestions on this subject and on others\r\nconnected with his Department in the report of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations for the support of the Army during the current fiscal\r\nyear ending 30th June next were reduced far below the estimate submitted\r\nby the Department. The consequence of this reduction is a considerable\r\ndeficiency, to which I invite your early attention.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of that Department for the year ending 30th June last\r\nwere $9,060,268.58. The estimates for the year commencing 1st July next\r\nand ending June 30, 1853, are $7,898,775.83, showing a reduction of\r\n$1,161,492.75.\r\n\r\nThe board of commissioners to whom the management of the affairs of the\r\nmilitary asylum created by the act of 3d March last was intrusted have\r\nselected a site for the establishment of an asylum in the vicinity of\r\nthis city, which has been approved by me subject to the production of\r\na satisfactory title.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy will exhibit the condition of\r\nthe public service under the supervision of that Department. Our naval\r\nforce afloat during the present year has been actively and usefully\r\nemployed in giving protection to our widely extended and increasing\r\ncommerce and interests in the various quarters of the globe, and our\r\nflag has everywhere afforded the security and received the respect\r\ninspired by the justice and liberality of our intercourse and the\r\ndignity and power of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe expedition commanded by Lieutenant De Haven, dispatched in search\r\nof the British commander Sir John Franklin and his companions in the\r\nArctic Seas, returned to New York in the month of October, after having\r\nundergone great peril and suffering from an unknown and dangerous\r\nnavigation and the rigors of a northern climate, without any satisfactory\r\ninformation of the objects of their search, but with new contributions\r\nto science and navigation from the unfrequented polar regions. The\r\nofficers and men of the expedition having been all volunteers for this\r\nservice and having so conducted it as to meet the entire approbation\r\nof the Government, it is suggested, as an act of grace and generosity,\r\nthat the same allowance of extra pay and emoluments be extended to them\r\nthat were made to the officers and men of like rating in the late\r\nexploring expedition to the South Seas.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend to your attention the necessity of reorganizing\r\nthe naval establishment, apportioning and fixing the number of officers\r\nin each grade, providing some mode of promotion to the higher grades of\r\nthe Navy having reference to merit and capacity rather than seniority or\r\ndate of entry into the service, and for retiring from the effective list\r\nupon reduced pay those who may be incompetent to the performance of\r\nactive duty. As a measure of economy, as well as of efficiency, in this\r\narm of the service, the provision last mentioned is eminently worthy of\r\nyour consideration.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the questions of relative rank between the sea\r\nofficers and civil officers of the Navy, and between officers of\r\nthe Army and Navy, in the various grades of each, will also merit\r\nyour attention. The failure to provide any substitute when corporal\r\npunishment was abolished for offenses in the Navy has occasioned the\r\nconvening of numerous courts-martial upon the arrival of vessels\r\nin port, and is believed to have had an injurious effect upon the\r\ndiscipline and efficiency of the service. To moderate punishment from\r\none grade to another is among the humane reforms of the age, but to\r\nabolish one of severity, which applied so generally to offenses on\r\nshipboard, and provide nothing in its stead is to suppose a progress of\r\nimprovement in every individual among seamen which is not assumed by\r\nthe Legislature in respect to any other class of men. It is hoped that\r\nCongress, in the ample opportunity afforded by the present session, will\r\nthoroughly investigate this important subject, and establish such modes\r\nof determining guilt and such gradations of punishment as are consistent\r\nwith humanity and the personal rights of individuals, and at the same\r\ntime shall insure the most energetic and efficient performance of duty\r\nand the suppression of crime in our ships of war.\r\n\r\nThe stone dock in the navy-yard at New York, which was ten years in\r\nprocess of construction, has been so far finished as to be surrendered\r\nup to the authorities of the yard. The dry dock at Philadelphia is\r\nreported as completed, and is expected soon to be tested and delivered\r\nover to the agents of the Government. That at Portsmouth, N.H., is also\r\nnearly ready for delivery; and a contract has been concluded, agreeably\r\nto the act of Congress at its last session, for a floating sectional\r\ndock on the Bay of San Francisco. I invite your attention to the\r\nrecommendation of the Department touching the establishment of a\r\nnavy-yard in conjunction with this dock on the Pacific. Such a station\r\nis highly necessary to the convenience and effectiveness of our fleet\r\nin that ocean, which must be expected to increase with the growth of\r\ncommerce and the rapid extension of our whale fisheries over its waters.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Academy at Annapolis, under a revised and improved system of\r\nregulations, now affords opportunities of education and instruction to\r\nthe pupils quite equal, it is believed, for professional improvement, to\r\nthose enjoyed by the cadets in the Military Academy. A large class of\r\nacting midshipmen was received at the commencement of the last academic\r\nterm, and a practice ship has been attached to the institution to afford\r\nthe amplest means for regular instruction in seamanship, as well as for\r\ncruises during the vacations of three or four months in each year.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of science in nautical affairs have rarely been more\r\nstrikingly illustrated than in the fact, stated in the report of the\r\nNavy Department, that by means of the wind and current charts projected\r\nand prepared by Lieutenant Maury, the Superintendent of the Naval\r\nObservatory, the passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific ports of\r\nour country has been shortened by about forty days.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the support of the Navy and Marine Corps the ensuing\r\nfiscal year will be found to be $5,856,472.19, the estimates for the\r\ncurrent year being $5,900,621.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for special objects under the control of this Department\r\namount to $2,684,220.89, against $2,210,980 for the present year, the\r\nincrease being occasioned by the additional mail service on the Pacific\r\nCoast and the construction of the dock in California, authorized at the\r\nlast session of Congress, and some slight additions under the head of\r\nimprovements and repairs in navy-yards, buildings, and machinery.\r\n\r\nI deem it of much importance to a just economy and a correct\r\nunderstanding of naval expenditures that there should be an entire\r\nseparation of the appropriations for the support of the naval service\r\nproper from those for permanent improvements at navy-yards and stations\r\nand from ocean steam mail service and other special objects assigned to\r\nthe supervision of this Department.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General, herewith communicated, presents\r\nan interesting view of the progress, operations, and condition of his\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last fiscal year the length of mail routes within\r\nthe United States was 196,290 miles, the annual transportation thereon\r\n53,272,252 miles, and the annual cost of such transportation $3,421,754.\r\n\r\nThe length of the foreign mail routes is estimated at 18,349 miles\r\nand the annual transportation thereon at 615,206 miles. The annual\r\ncost of this service is $1,472,187, of which $448,937 are paid by\r\nthe Post-Office Department and $1,023,250 are paid through the Navy\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe annual transportation within the United States, excluding the\r\nservice in California and Oregon, which is now for the first time\r\nreported and embraced in the tabular statements of the Department,\r\nexceeds that of the preceding year 6,162,855 miles, at an increased\r\ncost of $547,110.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of post-offices in the United States on the 30th day of\r\nJune last was 19,796. There were 1,698 post-offices established and 256\r\ndiscontinued during the year.\r\n\r\nThe gross revenues of the Department for the fiscal year, including the\r\nappropriations for the franked matter of Congress, of the Departments,\r\nand officers of Government, and excluding the foreign postages collected\r\nfor and payable to the British post-office, amounted to $6,727,866.78.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period, excluding $20,599.49, paid under\r\nan award of the Auditor, in pursuance of a resolution of the last\r\nCongress, for mail service on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in 1832\r\nand 1833, and the amount paid to the British post-office for foreign\r\npostages collected for and payable to that office, amounted to\r\n$6,024,566.79, leaving a balance of revenue over the proper expenditures\r\nof the year of $703,299.99.\r\n\r\nThe receipts for postages during the year, excluding the foreign\r\npostages collected for and payable to the British post-office, amounted\r\nto $6,345,747.21, being an increase of $997,610.79, or 18.65 per cent,\r\nover the like receipts for the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of postage under the act of March last did not take effect\r\nuntil the commencement of the present fiscal year. The accounts for\r\nthe first quarter under the operation of the reduced rates will not be\r\nsettled before January next, and no reliable estimate of the receipts\r\nfor the present year can yet be made. It is believed, however, that\r\nthey will fall far short of those of the last year. The surplus of the\r\nrevenues now on hand is, however, so large that no further appropriation\r\nfrom the Treasury in aid of the revenues of the Department is required\r\nfor the current fiscal year, but an additional appropriation for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1853, will probably be found necessary when the\r\nreceipts of the first two quarters of the fiscal year are fully\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nIn his last annual report the Postmaster-General recommended a reduction\r\nof postage to rates which he deemed as low as could be prudently adopted\r\nunless Congress was prepared to appropriate from the Treasury for\r\nthe support of the Department a sum more than equivalent to the mail\r\nservices performed by it for the Government. The recommendations of the\r\nPostmaster-General in respect to letter postage, except on letters from\r\nand to California and Oregon, were substantially adopted by the last\r\nCongress. He now recommends adherence to the present letter rates and\r\nadvises against a further reduction until justified by the revenue of\r\nthe Department.\r\n\r\nHe also recommends that the rates of postage on printed matter be so\r\nrevised as to render them more simple and more uniform in their operation\r\nupon all classes of printed matter. I submit the recommendations of the\r\nreport to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe public statutes of the United States have now been accumulating\r\nfor more than sixty years, and, interspersed with private acts, are\r\nscattered through numerous volumes, and, from the cost of the whole,\r\nhave become almost inaccessible to the great mass of the community.\r\nThey also exhibit much of the incongruity and imperfection of hasty\r\nlegislation. As it seems to be generally conceded that there is no\r\n\"common law\" of the United States to supply the defects of their\r\nlegislation, it is most important that that legislation should be as\r\nperfect as possible, defining every power intended to be conferred,\r\nevery crime intended to be made punishable, and prescribing the\r\npunishment to be inflicted. In addition to some particular cases spoken\r\nof more at length, the whole criminal code is now lamentably defective.\r\nSome offenses are imperfectly described and others are entirely omitted,\r\nso that flagrant crimes may be committed with impunity. The scale\r\nof punishment is not in all cases graduated according to the degree\r\nand nature of the offense, and is often rendered more unequal by the\r\ndifferent modes of imprisonment or penitentiary confinement in the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\nMany laws of a permanent character have been introduced into\r\nappropriation bills, and it is often difficult to determine whether the\r\nparticular clause expires with the temporary act of which it is a part\r\nor continues in force. It has also frequently happened that enactments\r\nand provisions of law have been introduced into bills with the title or\r\ngeneral subject of which they have little or no connection or relation.\r\nIn this mode of legislation so many enactments have been heaped upon\r\neach other, and often with but little consideration, that in many\r\ninstances it is difficult to search out and determine what is the law.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is emphatically a government of\r\nwritten laws. The statutes should therefore, as far as practicable, not\r\nonly be made accessible to all, but be expressed in language so plain\r\nand simple as to be understood by all and arranged in such method as\r\nto give perspicuity to every subject. Many of the States have revised\r\ntheir public acts with great and manifest benefit, and I recommend that\r\nprovision be made by law for the appointment of a commission to revise\r\nthe public statutes of the United States, arranging them in order,\r\nsupplying deficiencies, correcting incongruities, simplifying their\r\nlanguage, and reporting them to Congress for its action.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress approved 30th September, 1850, contained a provision\r\nfor the extension of the Capitol according to such plan as might be\r\napproved by the President, and appropriated $100,000 to be expended\r\nunder his direction by such architect as he should appoint to execute\r\nthe same. On examining the various plans which had been submitted by\r\ndifferent architects in pursuance of an advertisement by a committee\r\nof the Senate no one was found to be entirely satisfactory, and it\r\nwas therefore deemed advisable to combine and adopt the advantages\r\nof several.\r\n\r\nThe great object to be accomplished was to make such an addition as\r\nwould afford ample and convenient halls for the deliberations of the two\r\nHouses of Congress, with sufficient accommodations for spectators and\r\nsuitable apartments for the committees and officers of the two branches\r\nof the Legislature. It was also desirable not to mar the harmony and\r\nbeauty of the present structure, which, as a specimen of architecture,\r\nis so universally admired. Keeping these objects in view, I concluded\r\nto make the addition by wings, detached from the present building, yet\r\nconnected with it by corridors. This mode of enlargement will leave the\r\npresent Capitol uninjured and afford great advantages for ventilation\r\nand the admission of light, and will enable the work to progress without\r\ninterrupting the deliberations of Congress. To carry this plan into\r\neffect I have appointed an experienced and competent architect. The\r\ncorner stone was laid on the 4th day of July last with suitable\r\nceremonies, since which time the work has advanced with commendable\r\nrapidity, and the foundations of both wings are now nearly complete.\r\n\r\nI again commend to your favorable regard the interests of the District\r\nof Columbia, and deem it only necessary to remind you that although its\r\ninhabitants have no voice in the choice of Representatives in Congress,\r\nthey are not the less entitled to a just and liberal consideration in\r\nyour legislation. My opinions on this subject were more fully expressed\r\nin my last annual communication.\r\n\r\nOther subjects were brought to the attention of Congress in my last\r\nannual message, to which I would respectfully refer. But there was one\r\nof more than ordinary interest, to which I again invite your special\r\nattention. I allude to the recommendation for the appointment of a\r\ncommission to settle private claims against the United States. Justice\r\nto individuals, as well as to the Government, imperatively demands that\r\nsome more convenient and expeditious mode than an appeal to Congress\r\nshould be adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply to be regretted that in several instances officers of the\r\nGovernment, in attempting to execute the law for the return of fugitives\r\nfrom labor, have been openly resisted and their efforts frustrated and\r\ndefeated by lawless and violent mobs; that in one case such resistance\r\nresulted in the death of an estimable citizen, and in others serious\r\ninjury ensued to those officers and to individuals who were using their\r\nendeavors to sustain the laws. Prosecutions have been instituted against\r\nthe alleged offenders so far as they could be identified, and are still\r\npending. I have regarded it as my duty in these cases to give all aid\r\nlegally in my power to the enforcement of the laws, and I shall continue\r\nto do so wherever and whenever their execution may be resisted.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress for the return of fugitives from labor is one\r\nrequired and demanded by the express words of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution declares that--\r\n\r\n  No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof,\r\n  escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation\r\n  therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be\r\n  delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may\r\n  be due.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis constitutional provision is equally obligatory upon the legislative,\r\nthe executive, and judicial departments of the Government, and upon every\r\ncitizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nCongress, however, must from necessity first act upon the subject by\r\nprescribing the proceedings necessary to ascertain that the person is a\r\nfugitive and the means to be used for his restoration to the claimant.\r\nThis was done by an act passed during the first term of President\r\nWashington, which was amended by that enacted by the last Congress,\r\nand it now remains for the executive and judicial departments to take\r\ncare that these laws be faithfully executed. This injunction of the\r\nConstitution is as peremptory and as binding as any other; it stands\r\nexactly on the same foundation as that clause which provides for the\r\nreturn of fugitives from justice, or that which declares that no bill of\r\nattainder or _ex post facto_ law shall be passed, or that which provides\r\nfor an equality of taxation according to the census, or the clause\r\ndeclaring that all duties shall be uniform throughout the United States,\r\nor the important provision that the trial of all crimes shall be by\r\njury. These several articles and clauses of the Constitution, all\r\nresting on the same authority, must stand or fall together. Some\r\nobjections have been urged against the details of the act for the return\r\nof fugitives from labor, but it is worthy of remark that the main\r\nopposition is aimed against the Constitution itself, and proceeds from\r\npersons and classes of persons many of whom declare their wish to see\r\nthat Constitution overturned. They avow their hostility to any law\r\nwhich shall give full and practical effect to this requirement of the\r\nConstitution. Fortunately, the number of these persons is comparatively\r\nsmall, and is believed to be daily diminishing; but the issue which they\r\npresent is one which involves the supremacy and even the existence of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nCases have heretofore arisen in which individuals have denied the\r\nbinding authority of acts of Congress, and even States have proposed to\r\nnullify such acts upon the ground that the Constitution was the supreme\r\nlaw of the land, and that those acts of Congress were repugnant to\r\nthat instrument; but nullification is now aimed not so much against\r\nparticular laws as being inconsistent with the Constitution as against\r\nthe Constitution itself, and it is not to be disguised that a spirit\r\nexists, and has been actively at work, to rend asunder this Union,\r\nwhich is our cherished inheritance from our Revolutionary fathers.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I stated that I considered the series of\r\nmeasures which had been adopted at the previous session in reference\r\nto the agitation growing out of the Territorial and slavery questions\r\nas a final settlement in principle and substance of the dangerous and\r\nexciting subjects which they embraced, and I recommended adherence to\r\nthe adjustment established by those measures until time and experience\r\nshould demonstrate the necessity of further legislation to guard against\r\nevasion or abuse. I was not induced to make this recommendation because\r\nI thought those measures perfect, for no human legislation can be\r\nperfect. Wide differences and jarring opinions can only be reconciled by\r\nyielding something on all sides, and this result had been reached after\r\nan angry conflict of many months, in which one part of the country was\r\narrayed against another, and violent convulsion seemed to be imminent.\r\nLooking at the interests of the whole country, I felt it to be my duty\r\nto seize upon this compromise as the best that could be obtained amid\r\nconflicting interests and to insist upon it as a final settlement, to\r\nbe adhered to by all who value the peace and welfare of the country.\r\nA year has now elapsed since that recommendation was made. To that\r\nrecommendation I still adhere, and I congratulate you and the country\r\nupon the general acquiescence in these measures of peace which has been\r\nexhibited in all parts of the Republic. And not only is there this\r\ngeneral acquiescence in these measures, but the spirit of conciliation\r\nwhich has been manifested in regard to them in all parts of the country\r\nhas removed doubts and uncertainties in the minds of thousands of good\r\nmen concerning the durability of our popular institutions and given\r\nrenewed assurance that our liberty and our Union may subsist together\r\nfor the benefit of this and all succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation between\r\nthe United States and the Republic of Costa Rica, signed in this city\r\non the 10th day of July last.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 15, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report[13] of the Secretary of State, in\r\nanswer to their resolution of the 8th of March last.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Relating to the free navigation of the St. Lawrence, St.\r\nJohn, and other large rivers, and to the free enjoyment of the British\r\nNorth American fisheries by United States citizens.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 15, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received a resolution of the Senate, adopted on the 12th instant,\r\nin the following terms:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President of the United States be requested to\r\n  communicate to the Senate, if not inconsistent with the public interest,\r\n  any information the Executive may have received respecting the firing\r\n  into and seizure of the American steamship _Prometheus_ by a British\r\n  vessel of war in November last near Greytown, on the Mosquito Coast,\r\n  and also what measures have been taken by the Executive to ascertain\r\n  the state of the facts and to vindicate the honor of the country.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this request I submit to the Senate the accompanying\r\nextracts from a communication addressed to the Department of State by\r\nMr. Joseph L.

Upon receiving\r\nthis communication instructions such as the occasion seemed to demand\r\nwere immediately dispatched to the minister of the United States in\r\nLondon. Sufficient time has not elapsed for the return of any answer\r\nto this dispatch from him, and in my judgment it would at the present\r\nmoment be inconsistent with the public interest to communicate those\r\ninstructions. A communication, however, of all the correspondence will\r\nbe made to the Senate at the earliest moment at which a proper regard\r\nto the public interest will permit.\r\n\r\nAt the same time instructions were given to Commodore Parker, commanding\r\nthe Home Squadron, a copy of which, so far as they relate to the case of\r\nthe _Prometheus_, is herewith transmitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 16, 1851_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 9th instant, requesting\r\ninformation in regard to the imprisonment of John S.

A copy of the report of the agent who\r\nwas sent for the purpose of superintending the work is also herewith\r\ntransmitted.

I deemed all this necessary as well for the\r\ninterest of the claimants as to secure the Government against fraudulent\r\nclaims which might be preferred hereafter. A few days since I was\r\nsurprised to learn that some of these papers had been fraudulently\r\nabstracted by one of the claimants, and upon the case being made known\r\nto me by the Secretary of State I referred it to the Attorney-General\r\nfor the purpose of ascertaining what punishment could be inflicted upon\r\nthe person who had been guilty of this offense.\r\n\r\nI now communicate to you his opinion and that of the attorney of the\r\nUnited States for this District, by which you will perceive that it\r\nis doubtful whether there be any law for punishing the very grave\r\noffense of fraudulently abstracting or mutilating the papers and public\r\ndocuments in the several Departments of this Government. It appears to\r\nme that the protection of the public records and papers requires that\r\nsuch acts should be made penal and a suitable punishment inflicted upon\r\nthe offender, and I therefore bring the subject to your consideration,\r\nto enable you to act upon it should you concur with me in this opinion.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 26, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 18th instant, I transmit a copy of the correspondence with John P.\r\nGaines, governor of the Territory of Oregon, relative to the seat of\r\ngovernment of said Territory.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 29, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 24th instant,\r\nrelating to the extension of the Capitol, I have the honor to submit\r\nherewith a report from the Secretary of the Interior, which furnishes,\r\nit is believed, the required information.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _March 29, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the resolution of your honorable body adopted in executive\r\nsession March 24, 1852, by which I am requested to return to the Senate\r\nthe resolution advising and consenting to the appointment of George C.\r\nLaurason as collector of the customs for the district of New Orleans,\r\nprovided a commission had not been issued to him, and in reply thereto\r\nI would respectfully state that prior to the receipt of said resolution\r\nI had signed the commission to Mr. Laurason and transmitted it to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to whom your resolution was immediately\r\nreferred; and I have the honor now to transmit his reply, by which\r\nit will be seen that the commission, after having been duly executed,\r\nwas sent to the First Comptroller, where it still remains. I suppose,\r\naccording to the doctrine laid down in the case of Marbury _v._ Madison\r\n(1 Cranch R., 137), the appointment must be deemed complete, and nothing\r\nshort of the removal of Mr. Laurason can enable me again to submit his\r\nnomination to the consideration of the Senate; but as the commission has\r\nnot been technically issued to Mr. Laurason, I deem it most respectful\r\nto comply with your request by returning the copy of the resolution\r\nwhich notified me that the Senate advised and consented to his\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _April 6, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of the 31st ultimo,\r\nI have the honor herewith to transmit a report from the Secretary\r\nof War, accompanied by the original manuscript report of Captain\r\nThomas J.

A\r\ncopy of a note from the special plenipotentiary of Hamburg, Bremen, and\r\nLubeck accompanies the convention.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 5, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of March, 1849, a general convention of peace, amity,\r\ncommerce, and navigation between the United States and the Republic of\r\nGuatemala, by Elijah Hise, the chargé d'affaires of the United States\r\nto that Republic, on the part of this Government, and by Señor Don Jose\r\nMariano Rodriguez, minister for foreign affairs, on the part of the\r\nGovernment of Guatemala. This convention was approved by the Senate\r\non the 24th of September, 1850, and by a resolution of the 27th of\r\nthat month that body authorized the ratification of this Government\r\nto be exchanged for the ratification of the Government of Guatemala at\r\nany time prior to the 1st of April, 1851. I accordingly ratified the\r\nconvention on the 14th of November, 1850, but there was then no person\r\nin this country authorized to effect the exchange of ratifications on\r\nthe part of the Guatemalan Government, and the United States had no\r\ndiplomatic representative there. When, however, in the summer of 1851,\r\nMr. J. Bozman Kerr proceeded to Nicaragua as the chargé d'affaires of\r\nthe United States, he was empowered and instructed, when he should have\r\nconcluded the business, which it was presumed would not have detained\r\nhim long, in Nicaragua, to repair to Guatemala and effect the exchange\r\non the part of this Government. Circumstances, however, have hitherto\r\nprevented him from accomplishing this object. Meanwhile Señor Don Felipe\r\nMolina has been received as chargé d'affaires of Guatemala here, and has\r\nbeen empowered to effect the exchange on the part of that Government.\r\n\r\nI accordingly recommend that the Senate authorize a further extension\r\nof the period for exchanging the ratifications, in order that the\r\nconvention may go into operation. It is presumed that if this\r\nrecommendation should be adopted a few weeks from the date of the\r\ndecision of the Senate upon the subject would be necessary to complete\r\nthe preparations for carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 29, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the Senate of the 6th instant, requesting the \"papers\r\nand proofs on file in any of the Executive Departments touching the\r\nclaim of Samuel A.

As\r\nthe claim referred to is a subject of negotiation with the Mexican\r\nGovernment, it is not deemed expedient at this juncture to make public\r\nthe documents which have been reserved. According to the reports of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, of the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nof the Secretary of War, of the Secretary of the Navy, and of the\r\nPostmaster-General, there are no papers in their respective Departments\r\nrelative to the claim of Messrs.

As the period limited for the exchange of the\r\nratifications, which is to be effected at Bruni, will expire on the 23d\r\ninstant, I recommend that if the Senate should approve the convention\r\nauthority may be given to perform that ceremony within a year from that\r\ndate. The instrument would have been submitted to the Senate in season\r\nfor the ratification to be exchanged within the stipulated time had not\r\nMr. Balestier's arrival with it in the United States been unavoidably\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 11, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a report from the Secretary of State, on the\r\nsubject of the disorders on the Rio Grande frontier, and recommend the\r\nlegislation which it suggests, in order that the duties and obligations\r\nof this Government occasioned thereby may be more effectually discharged\r\nand the peace and security of the inhabitants of the United States in\r\nthat quarter more efficiently maintained.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 14, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your consideration, a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, accompanied by a communication from His Excellency\r\nSeñor Don A.

He,\r\nhowever, insists that the thirteenth article of the treaty of 1795\r\npromises indemnity for such injuries sustained within one year after\r\nthe commencement of war between the two nations, and although he admits\r\nthis is not within the letter of the treaty, yet he conceives that, as\r\nbetween two friendly nations, it is within the spirit of it.\r\n\r\nThis view of the case is at his request submitted for your\r\nconsideration, but whether you may deem it correct or not, there is,\r\nperhaps, one ground upon which this indemnity, which can not be large in\r\namount, may be granted without establishing a dangerous precedent, and\r\nthe granting of which would commend itself to the generous feelings\r\nof the entire country, and that is this: The Queen of Spain, with a\r\nmagnanimity worthy of all commendation, in a case where we had no legal\r\nright to solicit the favor, granted a free pardon to all the persons who\r\nhad so unjustifiably invaded her dominions and murdered her subjects in\r\nCuba, in violation of her own laws as well as those of the United States\r\nand the public law of nations. Such an act of mercy, which restored many\r\nmisguided and unfortunate youth of this country to their parents and\r\nfriends, seems to me to merit some corresponding act of magnanimity\r\nand generosity on the part of the Government of this country, and I\r\nthink that there can be none more appropriate than to grant an indemnity\r\nto those Spanish subjects who were resident among us and who suffered\r\nby the violence of the mob, not on account of any fault which they\r\nthemselves had committed, but because they were the subjects of the\r\nQueen of Spain. Such an act would tend to confirm that friendship which\r\nhas so long existed between the two nations and to perpetuate it as a\r\nblessing to both, and I therefore recommend it to your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 22, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with the\r\naccompanying documents,[21] in compliance with the Senate's resolution\r\nof the 29th of April last.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Correspondence of the American chargé at Vienna on the\r\nsubject of the apprehension and imprisonment by the Austrian authorities\r\nof Rev.

Any information which may be in\r\nthe possession of the Executive on these subjects shall in due time be\r\nlaid before the Senate, but it is apprehended that it would not comport\r\nwith the public interests to communicate it under existing\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 26, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received the resolution of the Senate of the 11th instant, passed\r\nin executive session, making inquiry respecting supposed propositions\r\nof the King of the Sandwich Islands to convey the sovereignty of those\r\nislands to the United States and requesting all official information in\r\nmy possession touching the subject.\r\n\r\nThis request has been taken into the most respectful consideration, but\r\nthe conclusion at which I have arrived is that the public interest would\r\nnot be promoted, but, on the contrary, might under circumstances of\r\npossible occurrence, be seriously endangered if it were now to be\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _July 1, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 26th ultimo I received a resolution of the Senate, passed in\r\nexecutive session, in the following words:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved,_ That the President of the United States be requested to\r\n  inform the Senate, if not in his opinion incompatible with the public\r\n  interest, whether any convention or compact has been entered into on the\r\n  part of the United States and the Government of Great Britain whereby\r\n  the two Governments jointly recommend or advise the Republics of Costa\r\n  Rica and Nicaragua, or either of those Republics, and the Mosquito\r\n  Indians, inhabiting the Mosquito Coast, in Central America, on matters\r\n  affecting their several and respective boundaries, or whereby any\r\n  recommendation or advice is given to either of said Republics or said\r\n  Indians respecting the territorial rights thereafter to be enjoyed or\r\n  observed by them respectively, or in any other manner affecting or\r\n  regulating the relations hereafter to be maintained between said\r\n  Republics themselves, or either of them, and the said Indians concerning\r\n  their territorial boundaries or other matters thereto appertaining. And\r\n  if there be any such convention or compact, then that the President be\r\n  requested to communicate the same, or a copy thereof, to the Senate, and\r\n  to inform the Senate whether the same was made at the request or\r\n  invitation of either of said Republics or of said Indians, or with their\r\n  privity, approbation, or consent. And that the President be further\r\n  requested to communicate to the Senate copies of all correspondence\r\n  between the Executive and Great Britain, or with either of said\r\n  Republics of Central America, touching said convention, and of all\r\n  documents connected therewith. And if such convention or compact has\r\n  been made, that the President be further requested to inform the Senate\r\n  whether the same has been formally communicated to the respective\r\n  Governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mosquito Indians on the\r\n  part of the Governments of Great Britain and the United States, and in\r\n  what form such communications have been made to them, and that he lay\r\n  before the Senate copies of any instructions that have been given to the\r\n  representatives or agents of the United States at Nicaragua and Costa\r\n  Rica touching such convention and the matters therein contained, with\r\n  copies of like instructions to any naval officer of the United States\r\n  relating to or in any manner concerning the said convention or its\r\n  communication to said Republics or said Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day I returned the following answer to that resolution:\r\n\r\n  I have received and taken into respectful consideration the resolution\r\n  of the Senate of yesterday, adopted in executive session, requesting\r\n  information in regard to supposed negotiations between the United States\r\n  and Great Britain and between the United States and the Republics of\r\n  Nicaragua and Costa Rica, respectively. Any information which may be in\r\n  the possession of the Executive on these subjects shall in due time be\r\n  laid before the Senate, but it is apprehended that it would not comport\r\n  with the public interests to communicate it under existing\r\n  circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat was my surprise to observe this morning in one of the public\r\njournals a statement of what purports to be a proposition, jointly\r\nsigned by Her Britannic Majesty's minister here and the Secretary of\r\nState, for the adjustment of certain claims to territory between\r\nNicaragua, Costa Rica, and the Mosquito Indians. I have caused immediate\r\ninquiry to be made into the origin of this highly improper publication,\r\nand shall omit no proper or legal means for bringing it to light.\r\nWhether it shall turn out to have been caused by unfaithfulness or\r\nbreach of duty in any officer of this Government, high or low, or by\r\na violation of diplomatic confidence, the appropriate remedy will be\r\nimmediately applied, as being due not only to this Government, but to\r\nother governments. And I hold this communication to be especially proper\r\nto be made immediately by me to the Senate, after what has transpired\r\non this subject, that the Senate may be perfectly assured that no\r\ninformation asked by it has been withheld and at the same time permitted\r\nto be published to the world.\r\n\r\nThis publication can not be considered otherwise than as a breach of\r\nofficial duty by some officer of the Government or a gross violation of\r\nthe confidence necessary always to be reposed in the representatives of\r\nother nations. An occurrence of this kind can not but weaken the faith\r\nso desirable to be preserved between different governments and to injure\r\nthe negotiations now pending, and it merits the severest reprobation.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _July 2, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit, for the advice and consent of the Senate, a treaty\r\nrecently negotiated with the Chickasaw Nation of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe nature and objects of the treaty are fully explained by the report\r\nof Mr. Harper, who negotiated it in behalf of the United States.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 2, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress approved on the 10th day of February, 1852, an\r\nappropriation of $6,000 was made for the relief of _American citizens_\r\nthen lately imprisoned and pardoned by the Queen of Spain, intended\r\nto provide for the return of such of the Cuban prisoners as were\r\ncitizens of the United States who had been transported to Spain and\r\nthere pardoned by the Spanish Government. It will be observed that no\r\nprovision was made for such foreigners or aliens as were engaged in the\r\nCuban expedition, and who had shared the fate of American citizens, for\r\nwhose relief the said act was intended to provide. I now transmit a\r\nreport from the First Comptroller, with accompanying papers, from which\r\nit will be perceived that fifteen foreigners were connected with that\r\nexpedition, who were also pardoned by the Queen of Spain, and have been\r\ntransported to the United States under a contract made with our consul,\r\nat an expense of $1,013.34, for the payment of which no provision\r\nhas been made by law. The consul having evidently acted with good\r\nintentions, the claim is submitted for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 13, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives requesting\r\ninformation relative to the policy of the Government in regard to the\r\nisland of Cuba, I transmit a report from the Department of State and\r\nthe documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, July 26, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to your resolution adopted in executive session June 11,\r\n1852, I have the honor herewith to communicate a report[23] from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, containing the information called for by that\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Relating to the boundary line between the United States\r\nand Mexico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 27, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant,\r\nrequesting the correspondence between the Government of the United\r\nStates and that of the Mexican Republic respecting a right of way\r\nacross the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, I transmit a report from the\r\nDepartment of State and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 29, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 27th instant,\r\nI transmit the copy of the notes[24] of Mr. Luis de la Rosa and Mr.\r\nJ.M.

It will be\r\nseen that the exchange was not effected until the 2d of June last, but\r\nthat it was stipulated that the convention was not to be binding upon\r\neither of the parties thereto until the Senate of the United States\r\nshould have duly sanctioned the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe Senate by its resolution of the 27th of September, 1850, authorized\r\nthe exchange to take place at any time prior to the 1st of April, 1851.\r\n\r\nMr. Kerr, the chargé d'affaires of the United States to Nicaragua,\r\nhowever, who was authorized to make the exchange on the part of this\r\nGovernment, was unavoidably detained in that Republic, in consequence of\r\nwhich the exchange could not be effected within the period referred to.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of sanctioning the exchange which has been made by\r\nMr. Kerr, and of authorizing the convention to go into effect, is\r\naccordingly submitted to the consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 12, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate dated the 20th ultimo,\r\nrequesting information in regard to controversies between the consul of\r\nthe United States at Acapulco and the Mexican authorities, I transmit\r\na report from the Secretary of State and the documents by which it was\r\naccompanied.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 13, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State upon the subject of the\r\nrelations between the United States and the Republics of Nicaragua and\r\nCosta Rica, in Central America, which has been delayed longer than I\r\ndesired in consequence of the ill health of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 14, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received a resolution from your honorable body of the 6th\r\ninstant, appearing to have been adopted in open legislative session,\r\nrequesting me \"to inform the Senate, if not incompatible with the public\r\ninterests, whether any propositions have been made by the King of the\r\nSandwich Islands to transfer the sovereignty of these islands to the\r\nUnited States, and to communicate to the Senate all the official\r\ninformation on that subject in my possession;\" in reply to which I have\r\nto state that on or about the 12th day of June last I received a similar\r\nresolution from the Senate adopted in executive or secret session, to\r\nwhich I returned an answer stating that in my opinion a communication of\r\nthe information requested at that juncture would not comport with the\r\npublic interest.

Daniel Webster died at Marshfield, in Massachusetts,\r\non Sunday, the 24th of October, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhilst this irreparable loss brings its natural sorrow to every American\r\nheart and will be heard far beyond our borders with mournful respect\r\nwherever civilization has nurtured men who find in transcendent\r\nintellect and faithful, patriotic service a theme for praise, it\r\nwill visit with still more poignant emotion his colleagues in the\r\nAdministration, with whom his relations have been so intimate and\r\nso cordial.\r\n\r\nThe fame of our illustrious statesman belongs to his country, the\r\nadmiration of it to the world. The record of his wisdom will inform\r\nfuture generations not less than its utterance has enlightened the\r\npresent. He has bequeathed to posterity the richest fruits of the\r\nexperience and judgment of a great mind conversant with the greatest\r\nnational concerns. In these his memory will endure as long as our\r\ncountry shall continue to be the home and guardian of freemen.\r\n\r\nThe people will share with the Executive Departments in the common\r\ngrief which bewails his departure from amongst us.\r\n\r\nIn the expression of individual regret at this afflicting event the\r\nExecutive Departments of the Government will be careful to manifest\r\nevery observance of honor which custom has established as appropriate\r\nto the memory of one so eminent as a public functionary and so\r\ndistinguished as a citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Acting Secretary of State will communicate this sad intelligence to\r\nthe diplomatic corps near this Government and, through our ministers\r\nabroad, to foreign governments.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Cabinet are requested, as a further testimony of\r\nrespect for the deceased, to wear the usual badges of mourning for\r\nthirty days.\r\n\r\nI am, gentlemen, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe brief space which has elapsed since the close of your last session\r\nhas been marked by no extraordinary political event. The quadrennial\r\nelection of Chief Magistrate has passed off with less than the usual\r\nexcitement. However individuals and parties may have been disappointed\r\nin the result, it is, nevertheless, a subject of national congratulation\r\nthat the choice has been effected by the independent suffrages of a free\r\npeople, undisturbed by those influences which in other countries have\r\ntoo often affected the purity of popular elections.\r\n\r\nOur grateful thanks are due to an all-merciful Providence, not only\r\nfor staying the pestilence which in different forms has desolated some\r\nof our cities, but for crowning the labors of the husbandman with an\r\nabundant harvest and the nation generally with the blessings of peace\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks the public mind has been deeply affected by the\r\ndeath of Daniel Webster, filling at his decease the office of Secretary\r\nof State. His associates in the executive government have sincerely\r\nsympathized with his family and the public generally on this mournful\r\noccasion. His commanding talents, his great political and professional\r\neminence, his well-tried patriotism, and his long and faithful services\r\nin the most important public trusts have caused his death to be lamented\r\nthroughout the country and have earned for him a lasting place in our\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last summer considerable anxiety was caused for\r\na short time by an official intimation from the Government of Great\r\nBritain that orders had been given for the protection of the fisheries\r\nupon the coasts of the British Provinces in North America against the\r\nalleged encroachments of the fishing vessels of the United States and\r\nFrance. The shortness of this notice and the season of the year seemed\r\nto make it a matter of urgent importance. It was at first apprehended\r\nthat an increased naval force had been ordered to the fishing grounds\r\nto carry into effect the British interpretation of those provisions in\r\nthe convention of 1818 in reference to the true intent of which the two\r\nGovernments differ. It was soon discovered that such was not the design\r\nof Great Britain, and satisfactory explanations of the real objects of\r\nthe measure have been given both here and in London.\r\n\r\nThe unadjusted difference, however, between the two Governments as to\r\nthe interpretation of the first article of the convention of 1818 is\r\nstill a matter of importance. American fishing vessels, within nine or\r\nten years, have been excluded from waters to which they had free access\r\nfor twenty-five years after the negotiation of the treaty. In 1845 this\r\nexclusion was relaxed so far as concerns the Bay of Fundy, but the just\r\nand liberal intention of the home Government, in compliance with what\r\nwe think the true construction of the convention, to open all the\r\nother outer bays to our fishermen was abandoned in consequence of the\r\nopposition of the colonies. Notwithstanding this, the United States\r\nhave, since the Bay of Fundy was reopened to our fishermen in 1845,\r\npursued the most liberal course toward the colonial fishing interests.\r\nBy the revenue law of 1846 the duties on colonial fish entering our\r\nports were very greatly reduced, and by the warehousing act it is\r\nallowed to be entered in bond without payment of duty. In this way\r\ncolonial fish has acquired the monopoly of the export trade in our\r\nmarket and is entering to some extent into the home consumption. These\r\nfacts were among those which increased the sensibility of our fishing\r\ninterest at the movement in question.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances and the incidents above alluded to have led me to\r\nthink the moment favorable for a reconsideration of the entire subject\r\nof the fisheries on the coasts of the British Provinces, with a view to\r\nplace them upon a more liberal footing of reciprocal privilege. A\r\nwillingness to meet us in some arrangement of this kind is understood to\r\nexist on the part of Great Britain, with a desire on her part to include\r\nin one comprehensive settlement as well this subject as the commercial\r\nintercourse between the United States and the British Provinces. I have\r\nthought that, whatever arrangements may be made on these two subjects,\r\nit is expedient that they should be embraced in separate conventions.\r\nThe illness and death of the late Secretary of State prevented the\r\ncommencement of the contemplated negotiation. Pains have been taken to\r\ncollect the information required for the details of such an arrangement.\r\nThe subject is attended with considerable difficulty. If it is found\r\npracticable to come to an agreement mutually acceptable to the two\r\nparties, conventions may be concluded in the course of the present\r\nwinter. The control of Congress over all the provisions of such an\r\narrangement affecting the revenue will of course be reserved.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Cuba formed a prominent topic in my last annual message.\r\nThey remain in an uneasy condition, and a feeling of alarm and\r\nirritation on the part of the Cuban authorities appears to exist. This\r\nfeeling has interfered with the regular commercial intercourse between\r\nthe United States and the island and led to some acts of which we have\r\na right to complain. But the Captain-General of Cuba is clothed with no\r\npower to treat with foreign governments, nor is he in any degree under\r\nthe control of the Spanish minister at Washington. Any communication\r\nwhich he may hold with an agent of a foreign power is informal and\r\nmatter of courtesy. Anxious to put an end to the existing inconveniences\r\n(which seemed to rest on a misconception), I directed the newly\r\nappointed minister to Mexico to visit Havana on his way to Vera Cruz.\r\nHe was respectfully received by the Captain-General, who conferred with\r\nhim freely on the recent occurrences, but no permanent arrangement was\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the refusal of the Captain-General to allow passengers\r\nand the mail to be landed in certain cases, for a reason which does not\r\nfurnish, in the opinion of this Government, even a good presumptive\r\nground for such prohibition, has been made the subject of a serious\r\nremonstrance at Madrid, and I have no reason to doubt that due respect\r\nwill be paid by the Government of Her Catholic Majesty to the\r\nrepresentations which our minister has been instructed to make on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt is but justice to the Captain-General to add that his conduct toward\r\nthe steamers employed to carry the mails of the United States to Havana\r\nhas, with the exceptions above alluded to, been marked with kindness and\r\nliberality, and indicates no general purpose of interfering with the\r\ncommercial correspondence and intercourse between the island and this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present year official notes were received from the\r\nministers of France and England inviting the Government of the United\r\nStates to become a party with Great Britain and France to a tripartite\r\nconvention, in virtue of which the three powers should severally and\r\ncollectively disclaim now and for the future all intention to obtain\r\npossession of the island of Cuba, and should bind themselves to\r\ndiscountenance all attempts to that effect on the part of any power or\r\nindividual whatever. This invitation has been respectfully declined, for\r\nreasons which it would occupy too much space in this communication to\r\nstate in detail, but which led me to think that the proposed measure\r\nwould be of doubtful constitutionality, impolitic, and unavailing. I\r\nhave, however, in common with several of my predecessors, directed the\r\nministers of France and England to be assured that the United States\r\nentertain no designs against Cuba, but that, on the contrary, I should\r\nregard its incorporation into the Union at the present time as fraught\r\nwith serious peril.\r\n\r\nWere this island comparatively destitute of inhabitants or occupied by a\r\nkindred race, I should regard it, if voluntarily ceded by Spain, as a\r\nmost desirable acquisition. But under existing circumstances I should\r\nlook upon its incorporation into our Union as a very hazardous measure.\r\nIt would bring into the Confederacy a population of a different national\r\nstock, speaking a different language, and not likely to harmonize with\r\nthe other members. It would probably affect in a prejudicial manner the\r\nindustrial interests of the South, and it might revive those conflicts\r\nof opinion between the different sections of the country which lately\r\nshook the Union to its center, and which have been so happily\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\nThe rejection by the Mexican Congress of the convention which had been\r\nconcluded between that Republic and the United States for the protection\r\nof a transit way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and of the interests\r\nof those citizens of the United States who had become proprietors of\r\nthe rights which Mexico had conferred on one of her own citizens in\r\nregard to that transit has thrown a serious obstacle in the way of the\r\nattainment of a very desirable national object. I am still willing to\r\nhope that the differences on the subject which exist, or may hereafter\r\narise, between the Governments will be amicably adjusted. This subject,\r\nhowever, has already engaged the attention of the Senate of the United\r\nStates, and requires no further comment in this communication.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the question respecting the port of San Juan de\r\nNicaragua and of the controversy between the Republics of Costa Rica and\r\nNicaragua in regard to their boundaries was considered indispensable to\r\nthe commencement of the ship canal between the two oceans, which was the\r\nsubject of the convention between the United States and Great Britain\r\nof the 19th of April, 1850. Accordingly, a proposition for the same\r\npurposes, addressed to the two Governments in that quarter and to the\r\nMosquito Indians, was agreed to in April last by the Secretary of State\r\nand the minister of Her Britannic Majesty. Besides the wish to aid in\r\nreconciling the differences of the two Republics, I engaged in the\r\nnegotiation from a desire to place the great work of a ship canal\r\nbetween the two oceans under one jurisdiction and to establish the\r\nimportant port of San Juan de Nicaragua under the government of a\r\ncivilized power. The proposition in question was assented to by Costa\r\nRica and the Mosquito Indians. It has not proved equally acceptable\r\nto Nicaragua, but it is to be hoped that the further negotiations on\r\nthe subject which are in train will be carried on in that spirit of\r\nconciliation and compromise which ought always to prevail on such\r\noccasions, and that they will lead to a satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the executive government of\r\nVenezuela has acknowledged some claims of citizens of the United States\r\nwhich have for many years past been urged by our chargé d'affaires at\r\nCaracas. It is hoped that the same sense of justice will actuate the\r\nCongress of that Republic in providing the means for their payment.\r\n\r\nThe recent revolution in Buenos Ayres and the Confederated States having\r\nopened the prospect of an improved state of things in that quarter, the\r\nGovernments of Great Britain and France determined to negotiate with the\r\nchief of the new confederacy for the free access of their commerce to\r\nthe extensive countries watered by the tributaries of the La Plata; and\r\nthey gave a friendly notice of this purpose to the United States, that\r\nwe might, if we thought proper, pursue the same course. In compliance\r\nwith this invitation, our minister at Rio Janeiro and our chargé\r\nd'affaires at Buenos Ayres have been fully authorized to conclude\r\ntreaties with the newly organized confederation or the States composing\r\nit. The delays which have taken place in the formation of the new\r\ngovernment have as yet prevented the execution of those instructions,\r\nbut there is every reason to hope that these vast countries will be\r\neventually opened to our commerce.\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce has been concluded between the United States and\r\nthe Oriental Republic of Uruguay, which will be laid before the Senate.\r\nShould this convention go into operation, it will open to the commercial\r\nenterprise of our citizens a country of great extent and unsurpassed in\r\nnatural resources, but from which foreign nations have hitherto been\r\nalmost wholly excluded.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of the late Secretary of State with the Peruvian\r\nchargé d'affaires relative to the Lobos Islands was communicated to\r\nCongress toward the close of the last session. Since that time, on\r\nfurther investigation of the subject, the doubts which had been\r\nentertained of the title of Peru to those islands have been removed,\r\nand I have deemed it just that the temporary wrong which had been\r\nunintentionally done her from want of information should be repaired\r\nby an unreserved acknowledgment of her sovereignty.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the course pursued by Peru\r\nhas been creditable to the liberality of her Government. Before it was\r\nknown by her that her title would be acknowledged at Washington, her\r\nminister of foreign affairs had authorized our chargé d'affaires at Lima\r\nto announce to the American vessels which had gone to the Lobos for\r\nguano that the Peruvian Government was willing to freight them on its\r\nown account. This intention has been carried into effect by the Peruvian\r\nminister here by an arrangement which is believed to be advantageous to\r\nthe parties in interest.\r\n\r\nOur settlements on the shores of the Pacific have already given a great\r\nextension, and in some respects a new direction, to our commerce in that\r\nocean. A direct and rapidly increasing intercourse has sprung up with\r\neastern Asia. The waters of the Northern Pacific, even into the Arctic\r\nSea, have of late years been frequented by our whalemen. The application\r\nof steam to the general purposes of navigation is becoming daily more\r\ncommon, and makes it desirable to obtain fuel and other necessary\r\nsupplies at convenient points on the route between Asia and our Pacific\r\nshores. Our unfortunate countrymen who from time to time suffer\r\nshipwreck on the coasts of the eastern seas are entitled to protection.\r\nBesides these specific objects, the general prosperity of our States on\r\nthe Pacific requires that an attempt should be made to open the opposite\r\nregions of Asia to a mutually beneficial intercourse. It is obvious that\r\nthis attempt could be made by no power to so great advantage as by\r\nthe United States, whose constitutional system excludes every idea of\r\ndistant colonial dependencies. I have accordingly been led to order an\r\nappropriate naval force to Japan, under the command of a discreet and\r\nintelligent officer of the highest rank known to our service. He is\r\ninstructed to endeavor to obtain from the Government of that country\r\nsome relaxation of the inhospitable and antisocial system which it has\r\npursued for about two centuries. He has been directed particularly to\r\nremonstrate in the strongest language against the cruel treatment to\r\nwhich our shipwrecked mariners have often been subjected and to insist\r\nthat they shall be treated with humanity. He is instructed, however,\r\nat the same time, to give that Government the amplest assurances that\r\nthe objects of the United States are such, and such only, as I have\r\nindicated, and that the expedition is friendly and peaceful.\r\nNotwithstanding the jealousy with which the Governments of eastern\r\nAsia regard all overtures from foreigners, I am not without hopes of a\r\nbeneficial result of the expedition. Should it be crowned with success,\r\nthe advantages will not be confined to the United States, but, as in the\r\ncase of China, will be equally enjoyed by all the other maritime powers.\r\nI have much satisfaction in stating that in all the steps preparatory to\r\nthis expedition the Government of the United States has been materially\r\naided by the good offices of the King of the Netherlands, the only\r\nEuropean power having any commercial relations with Japan.\r\n\r\nIn passing from this survey of our foreign relations, I invite the\r\nattention of Congress to the condition of that Department of the\r\nGovernment to which this branch of the public business is intrusted. Our\r\nintercourse with foreign powers has of late years greatly increased,\r\nboth in consequence of our own growth and the introduction of many new\r\nstates into the family of nations. In this way the Department of State\r\nhas become overburdened. It has by the recent establishment of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior been relieved of some portion of the domestic\r\nbusiness. If the residue of the business of that kind--such as the\r\ndistribution of Congressional documents, the keeping, publishing, and\r\ndistribution of the laws of the United States, the execution of the\r\ncopyright law, the subject of reprieves and pardons, and some other\r\nsubjects relating to interior administration--should be transferred from\r\nthe Department of State, it would unquestionably be for the benefit of\r\nthe public service. I would also suggest that the building appropriated\r\nto the State Department is not fireproof; that there is reason to think\r\nthere are defects in its construction, and that the archives of the\r\nGovernment in charge of the Department, with the precious collections of\r\nthe manuscript papers of Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, and\r\nMonroe, are exposed to destruction by fire. A similar remark may be made\r\nof the buildings appropriated to the War and Navy Departments.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Treasury is exhibited in the annual report from\r\nthat Department.\r\n\r\nThe cash receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending the\r\n30th June last, exclusive of trust funds, were $49,728,386.89, and\r\nthe expenditures for the same period, likewise exclusive of trust\r\nfunds, were $46,007,896.20, of which $9,455,815.83 was on account\r\nof the principal and interest of the public debt, including the last\r\ninstallment of the indemnity to Mexico under the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo, leaving a balance of $14,632,136.37 in the Treasury on the\r\n1st day of July last. Since this latter period further purchases\r\nof the principal of the public debt have been made to the extent of\r\n$2,456,547.49, and the surplus in the Treasury will continue to be\r\napplied to that object whenever the stock can be procured within the\r\nlimits as to price authorized by law.\r\n\r\nThe value of foreign merchandise imported during the last fiscal year\r\nwas $207,240,101, and the value of domestic productions exported was\r\n$149,861,911, besides $17,204,026 of foreign merchandise exported,\r\nmaking the aggregate of the entire exports $167,065,937. Exclusive of\r\nthe above, there was exported $42,507,285 in specie, and imported from\r\nforeign ports $5,262,643.\r\n\r\nIn my first annual message to Congress I called your attention to what\r\nseemed to me some defects in the present tariff, and recommended such\r\nmodifications as in my judgment were best adapted to remedy its evils\r\nand promote the prosperity of the country. Nothing has since occurred\r\nto change my views on this important question.\r\n\r\nWithout repeating the arguments contained in my former message in favor\r\nof discriminating protective duties, I deem it my duty to call your\r\nattention to one or two other considerations affecting this subject.\r\nThe first is the effect of large importations of foreign goods upon\r\nour currency. Most of the gold of California, as fast as it is coined,\r\nfinds its way directly to Europe in payment for goods purchased.\r\nIn the second place, as our manufacturing establishments are broken\r\ndown by competition with foreigners, the capital invested in them is\r\nlost, thousands of honest and industrious citizens are thrown out of\r\nemployment, and the farmer, to that extent, is deprived of a home market\r\nfor the sale of his surplus produce. In the third place, the destruction\r\nof our manufactures leaves the foreigner without competition in our\r\nmarket, and he consequently raises the price of the article sent here\r\nfor sale, as is now seen in the increased cost of iron imported from\r\nEngland. The prosperity and wealth of every nation must depend upon its\r\nproductive industry. The farmer is stimulated to exertion by finding a\r\nready market for his surplus products, and benefited by being able to\r\nexchange them without loss of time or expense of transportation for the\r\nmanufactures which his comfort or convenience requires. This is always\r\ndone to the best advantage where a portion of the community in which\r\nhe lives is engaged in other pursuits. But most manufactures require\r\nan amount of capital and a practical skill which can not be commanded\r\nunless they be protected for a time from ruinous competition from\r\nabroad. Hence the necessity of laying those duties upon imported goods\r\nwhich the Constitution authorizes for revenue in such a manner as to\r\nprotect and encourage the labor of our own citizens. Duties, however,\r\nshould not be fixed at a rate so high as to exclude the foreign article,\r\nbut should be so graduated as to enable the domestic manufacturer\r\nfairly to compete with the foreigner in our own markets, and by this\r\ncompetition to reduce the price of the manufactured article to the\r\nconsumer to the lowest rate at which it can be produced. This policy\r\nwould place the mechanic by the side of the farmer, create a mutual\r\ninterchange of their respective commodities, and thus stimulate the\r\nindustry of the whole country and render us independent of foreign\r\nnations for the supplies required by the habits or necessities of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nAnother question, wholly independent of protection, presents itself,\r\nand that is, whether the duties levied should be upon the value of\r\nthe article at the place of shipment, or, where it is practicable,\r\na specific duty, graduated according to quantity, as ascertained by\r\nweight or measure. All our duties are at present _ad valorem_. A\r\ncertain percentage is levied on the price of the goods at the port\r\nof shipment in a foreign country. Most commercial nations have found it\r\nindispensable, for the purpose of preventing fraud and perjury, to make\r\nthe duties specific whenever the article is of such a uniform value in\r\nweight or measure as to justify such a duty. Legislation should never\r\nencourage dishonesty or crime. It is impossible that the revenue\r\nofficers at the port where the goods are entered and the duties paid\r\nshould know with certainty what they cost in the foreign country. Yet\r\nthe law requires that they should levy the duty according to such cost.\r\nThey are therefore compelled to resort to very unsatisfactory evidence\r\nto ascertain what that cost was. They take the invoice of the importer,\r\nattested by his oath, as the best evidence of which the nature of the\r\ncase admits. But everyone must see that the invoice may be fabricated\r\nand the oath by which it is supported false, by reason of which the\r\ndishonest importer pays a part only of the duties which are paid by the\r\nhonest one, and thus indirectly receives from the Treasury of the United\r\nStates a reward for his fraud and perjury. The reports of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury heretofore made on this subject show conclusively that\r\nthese frauds have been practiced to a great extent. The tendency is to\r\ndestroy that high moral character for which our merchants have long been\r\ndistinguished, to defraud the Government of its revenue, to break down\r\nthe honest importer by a dishonest competition, and, finally, to\r\ntransfer the business of importation to foreign and irresponsible\r\nagents, to the great detriment of our own citizens. I therefore again\r\nmost earnestly recommend the adoption of specific duties wherever it\r\nis practicable, or a home valuation, to prevent these frauds.\r\n\r\nI would also again call your attention to the fact that the present\r\ntariff in some cases imposes a higher duty upon the raw material\r\nimported than upon the article manufactured from it, the consequence of\r\nwhich is that the duty operates to the encouragement of the foreigner\r\nand the discouragement of our own citizens.\r\n\r\nFor full and detailed information in regard to the general condition\r\nof our Indian affairs, I respectfully refer you to the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior and the accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nThe Senate not having thought proper to ratify the treaties which have\r\nbeen negotiated with the tribes of Indians in California and Oregon, our\r\nrelations with them have been left in a very unsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of our territory particular districts of country have\r\nbeen set apart for the exclusive occupation of the Indians, and their\r\nright to the lands within those limits has been acknowledged and\r\nrespected. But in California and Oregon there has been no recognition by\r\nthe Government of the exclusive right of the Indians to any part of the\r\ncountry. They are therefore mere tenants at sufferance, and liable to be\r\ndriven from place to place at the pleasure of the whites.\r\n\r\nThe treaties which have been rejected proposed to remedy this evil\r\nby allotting to the different tribes districts of country suitable\r\nto their habits of life and sufficient for their support. This provision,\r\nmore than any other, it is believed, led to their rejection; and as\r\nno substitute for it has been adopted by Congress, it has not been\r\ndeemed advisable to attempt to enter into new treaties of a permanent\r\ncharacter, although no effort has been spared by temporary arrangements\r\nto preserve friendly relations with them.\r\n\r\nIf it be the desire of Congress to remove them from the country\r\naltogether, or to assign to them particular districts more remote from\r\nthe settlements of the whites, it will be proper to set apart by law the\r\nterritory which they are to occupy and to provide the means necessary\r\nfor removing them to it. Justice alike to our own citizens and to the\r\nIndians requires the prompt action of Congress on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe amendments proposed by the Senate to the treaties which were\r\nnegotiated with the Sioux Indians of Minnesota have been submitted to\r\nthe tribes who were parties to them, and have received their assent.\r\nA large tract of valuable territory has thus been opened for settlement\r\nand cultivation, and all danger of collision with these powerful and\r\nwarlike bands has been happily removed.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the remnant of the tribe of Seminole Indians from Florida\r\nhas long been a cherished object of the Government, and it is one to\r\nwhich my attention has been steadily directed. Admonished by past\r\nexperience of the difficulty and cost of the attempt to remove them\r\nby military force, resort has been had to conciliatory measures.\r\nBy the invitation of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, several of\r\nthe principal chiefs recently visited Washington, and whilst here\r\nacknowledged in writing the obligation of their tribe to remove with\r\nthe least possible delay. Late advices from the special agent of the\r\nGovernment represent that they adhere to their promise, and that a\r\ncouncil of their people has been called to make their preliminary\r\narrangements. A general emigration may therefore be confidently\r\nexpected at an early day.\r\n\r\nThe report from the General Land Office shows increased activity in\r\nits operations. The survey of the northern boundary of Iowa has been\r\ncompleted with unexampled dispatch. Within the last year 9,522,953\r\nacres of public land have been surveyed and 8,032,463 acres brought\r\ninto market.\r\n\r\n                                                            Acres.\r\n  In the last fiscal year there were sold..............  1,553,071\r\n  Located with bounty-land warrants....................  3,201,314\r\n  Located with other certificates......................    115,682\r\n                                                         ---------\r\n  Making a total of....................................  4,870,067\r\n  In addition there were--\r\n  Reported under swamp-land grants.....................  5,219,188\r\n  For internal improvements, railroads, etc............  3,025,920\r\n                                                         ---------\r\n  Making an aggregate of............................... 13,115,175\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing an increase of the amount sold and located under land warrants of\r\n569,220 acres over the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount thus sold, located under land warrants, reported under\r\nswamp-land grants, and selected for internal improvements exceeds that\r\nof the previous year by 3,342,372 acres; and the sales would without\r\ndoubt have been much larger but for the extensive reservations for\r\nrailroads in Missouri, Mississippi, and Alabama.\r\n\r\n                                                            Acres.\r\n  For the quarter ending 30th September, 1852, there\r\n                                          were sold.....   243,255\r\n  Located with bounty-land warrants..................... 1,387,116\r\n  Located with other certificates.......................    15,649\r\n  Reported under swamp-land grants...................... 2,485,233\r\n                                                         ---------\r\n  Making an aggregate for the quarter of................ 4,131,253\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch the larger portion of the labor of arranging and classifying the\r\nreturns of the last census has been finished, and it will now devolve\r\nupon Congress to make the necessary provision for the publication of\r\nthe results in such form as shall be deemed best. The apportionment\r\nof representation on the basis of the new census has been made by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior in conformity with the provisions of law\r\nrelating to that subject, and the recent elections have been made in\r\naccordance with it.\r\n\r\nI commend to your favorable regard the suggestion contained in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Interior that provision be made by law\r\nfor the publication and distribution, periodically, of an analytical\r\ndigest of all the patents which have been or may hereafter be granted\r\nfor useful inventions and discoveries, with such descriptions and\r\nillustrations as may be necessary to present an intelligible view of\r\ntheir nature and operation. The cost of such publication could easily\r\nbe defrayed out of the patent fund, and I am persuaded that it could be\r\napplied to no object more acceptable to inventors and beneficial to the\r\npublic at large.\r\n\r\nAn appropriation of $100,000 having been made at the last session for\r\nthe purchase of a suitable site and for the erection, furnishing, and\r\nfitting up of an asylum for the insane of the District of Columbia and\r\nof the Army and Navy of the United States, the proper measures have been\r\nadopted to carry this beneficent purpose into effect.\r\n\r\nBy the latest advices from the Mexican boundary commission it appears\r\nthat the survey of the river Gila from its confluence with the Colorado\r\nto its supposed intersection with the western line of New Mexico has\r\nbeen completed. The survey of the Rio Grande has also been finished from\r\nthe point agreed on by the commissioners as \"the point where it strikes\r\nthe southern boundary of New Mexico\" to a point 135 miles below Eagle\r\nPass, which is about two-thirds of the distance along the course of the\r\nriver to its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation which was made at the last session of Congress for the\r\ncontinuation of the survey is subject to the following proviso:\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, That no part of this appropriation shall be used or\r\n  expended until it shall be made satisfactorily to appear to the\r\n  President of the United States that the southern boundary of New\r\n  Mexico is not established by the commissioner and surveyor of the\r\n  United States farther north of the town called \"Paso\" than the same\r\n  is laid down in Disturnell's map, which is added to the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy attention was drawn to this subject by a report from the Department\r\nof the Interior, which reviewed all the facts of the case and submitted\r\nfor my decision the question whether under existing circumstances any\r\npart, of the appropriation could be lawfully used or expended for the\r\nfurther prosecution of the work. After a careful consideration of the\r\nsubject I came to the conclusion that it could not, and so informed\r\nthe head of that Department. Orders were immediately issued by him to\r\nthe commissioner and surveyor to make no further requisitions on the\r\nDepartment, as they could not be paid, and to discontinue all operations\r\non the southern line of New Mexico. But as the Department had no exact\r\ninformation as to the amount of provisions and money which remained\r\nunexpended in the hands of the commissioner and surveyor, it was left\r\ndiscretionary with them to continue the survey down the Rio Grande as\r\nfar as the means at their disposal would enable them or at once to\r\ndisband the commission. A special messenger has since arrived from the\r\nofficer in charge of the survey on the river with information that the\r\nfunds subject to his control were exhausted and that the officers and\r\nothers employed in the service were destitute alike of the means of\r\nprosecuting the work and of returning to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe object of the proviso was doubtless to arrest the survey of the\r\nsouthern and western lines of New Mexico, in regard to which different\r\nopinions have been expressed; for it is hardly to be supposed that there\r\ncould be any objection to that part of the line which extends along the\r\nchannel of the Rio Grande. But the terms of the law are so broad as to\r\nforbid the use of any part of the money for the prosecution of the work,\r\nor even for the payment to the officers and agents of the arrearages of\r\npay which are justly due to them.\r\n\r\nI earnestly invite your prompt attention to this subject, and recommend\r\na modification of the terms of the proviso, so as to enable the\r\nDepartment to use as much of the appropriation as will be necessary\r\nto discharge the existing obligations of the Government and to complete\r\nthe survey of the Rio Grande to its mouth.\r\n\r\nIt will also be proper to make further provision by law for the\r\nfulfillment of our treaty with Mexico for running and marking the\r\nresidue of the boundary line between the two countries.\r\n\r\nPermit me to invite your particular attention to the interests of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, which are confided by the Constitution to your\r\npeculiar care.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures which seem to me of the greatest importance to its\r\nprosperity are the introduction of a copious supply of water into the\r\ncity of Washington and the construction of suitable bridges across the\r\nPotomac to replace those which were destroyed by high water in the early\r\npart of the present year.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress an appropriation was made to defray\r\nthe cost of the surveys necessary for determining the best means of\r\naffording an unfailing supply of good and wholesome water. Some progress\r\nhas been made in the survey, and as soon as it is completed the result\r\nwill be laid before you.\r\n\r\nFurther appropriations will also be necessary for grading and paving the\r\nstreets and avenues and inclosing and embellishing the public grounds\r\nwithin the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nI commend all these objects, together with the charitable institutions\r\nof the District, to your favorable regard.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made to protect our frontier and that of the\r\nadjoining Mexican States from the incursions of the Indian tribes.\r\nOf about 11,000 men of which the Army is composed, nearly 8,000 are\r\nemployed in the defense of the newly acquired territory (including\r\nTexas) and of emigrants proceeding thereto. I am gratified to say that\r\nthese efforts have been unusually successful. With the exception of some\r\npartial outbreaks in California and Oregon and occasional depredations\r\non a portion of the Rio Grande, owing, it is believed, to the disturbed\r\nstate of that border region, the inroads of the Indians have been\r\neffectually restrained.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown, however, that whenever the two races are brought\r\ninto contact collisions will inevitably occur. To prevent these\r\ncollisions the United States have generally set apart portions of\r\ntheir territory for the exclusive occupation of the Indian tribes. A\r\ndifficulty occurs, however, in the application of this policy to Texas.\r\nBy the terms of the compact by which that State was admitted into the\r\nUnion she retained the ownership of all the vacant lands within her\r\nlimits. The government of that State, it is understood, has assigned no\r\nportion of her territory to the Indians, but as fast as her settlements\r\nadvance lays it off into counties and proceeds to survey and sell it.\r\nThis policy manifestly tends not only to alarm and irritate the Indians,\r\nbut to compel them to resort to plunder for subsistence. It also\r\ndeprives this Government of that influence and control over them without\r\nwhich no durable peace can ever exist between them and the whites. I\r\ntrust, therefore, that a due regard for her own interests, apart from\r\nconsiderations of humanity and justice, will induce that State to assign\r\na small portion of her vast domain for the provisional occupancy of the\r\nsmall remnants of tribes within her borders, subject, of course, to her\r\nownership and eventual jurisdiction. If she should fail to do this, the\r\nfulfillment of our treaty stipulations with Mexico and our duty to the\r\nIndians themselves will, it is feared, become a subject of serious\r\nembarrassment to the Government. It is hoped, however, that a timely\r\nand just provision by Texas may avert this evil.\r\n\r\nNo appropriations for fortifications were made at the two last sessions\r\nof Congress. The cause of this omission is probably to be found in a\r\ngrowing belief that the system of fortifications adopted in 1816, and\r\nheretofore acted on, requires revision.\r\n\r\nThe subject certainly deserves full and careful investigation, but\r\nit should not be delayed longer than can be avoided. In the meantime\r\nthere are certain works which have been commenced, some of them nearly\r\ncompleted, designed to protect our principal seaports from Boston to New\r\nOrleans and a few other important points. In regard to the necessity for\r\nthese works, it is believed that little difference of opinion exists\r\namong military men. I therefore recommend that the appropriations\r\nnecessary to prosecute them be made.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the remarks on this subject and on others\r\nconnected with his Department contained in the accompanying report of\r\nthe Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to carry into effect the law of the last\r\nsession making provision for the improvement of certain rivers and\r\nharbors, and it is believed that the arrangements made for that purpose\r\nwill combine efficiency with economy. Owing chiefly to the advanced\r\nseason when the act was passed, little has yet been done in regard\r\nto many of the works beyond making the necessary preparations. With\r\nrespect to a few of the improvements, the sums already appropriated\r\nwill suffice to complete them; but most of them will require additional\r\nappropriations. I trust that these appropriations will be made, and\r\nthat this wise and beneficent policy, so auspiciously resumed, will be\r\ncontinued. Great care should be taken, however, to commence no work\r\nwhich is not of sufficient importance to the commerce of the country\r\nto be viewed as national in its character. But works which have been\r\ncommenced should not be discontinued until completed, as otherwise the\r\nsums expended will in most cases be lost.\r\n\r\nThe report from the Navy Department will inform you of the prosperous\r\ncondition of the branch of the public service committed to its charge.\r\nIt presents to your consideration many topics and suggestions of which\r\nI ask your approval. It exhibits an unusual degree of activity in the\r\noperations of the Department during the past year. The preparations for\r\nthe Japan expedition, to which I have already alluded; the arrangements\r\nmade for the exploration and survey of the China Seas, the Northern\r\nPacific, and Behrings Straits; the incipient measures taken toward a\r\nreconnaissance of the continent of Africa eastward of Liberia; the\r\npreparation for an early examination of the tributaries of the river La\r\nPlata, which a recent decree of the provisional chief of the Argentine\r\nConfederation has opened to navigation--all these enterprises and the\r\nmeans by which they are proposed to be accomplished have commanded my\r\nfull approbation, and I have no doubt will be productive of most useful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nTwo officers of the Navy were heretofore instructed to explore the whole\r\nextent of the Amazon River from the confines of Peru to its mouth. The\r\nreturn of one of them has placed in the possession of the Government an\r\ninteresting and valuable account of the character and resources of a\r\ncountry abounding in the materials of commerce, and which if opened to\r\nthe industry of the world will prove an inexhaustible fund of wealth.\r\nThe report of this exploration will be communicated to you as soon as\r\nit is completed.\r\n\r\nAmong other subjects offered to your notice by the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, I select for special commendation, in view of its connection\r\nwith the interests of the Navy, the plan submitted by him for the\r\nestablishment of a permanent corps of seamen and the suggestions he\r\nhas presented for the reorganization of the Naval Academy.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the first of these, I take occasion to say that I think\r\nit will greatly improve the efficiency of the service, and that I regard\r\nit as still more entitled to favor for the salutary influence it must\r\nexert upon the naval discipline, now greatly disturbed by the increasing\r\nspirit of insubordination resulting from our present system. The plan\r\nproposed for the organization of the seamen furnishes a judicious\r\nsubstitute for the law of September, 1850, abolishing corporal\r\npunishment, and satisfactorily sustains the policy of that act under\r\nconditions well adapted to maintain the authority of command and the\r\norder and security of our ships. It is believed that any change which\r\nproposes permanently to dispense with this mode of punishment should be\r\npreceded by a system of enlistment which shall supply the Navy with\r\nseamen of the most meritorious class, whose good deportment and pride\r\nof character may preclude all occasion for a resort to penalties of a\r\nharsh or degrading nature. The safety of a ship and her crew is often\r\ndependent upon immediate obedience to a command, and the authority to\r\nenforce it must be equally ready. The arrest of a refractory seaman\r\nin such moments not only deprives the ship of indispensable aid, but\r\nimposes a necessity for double service on others, whose fidelity to\r\ntheir duties may be relied upon in such an emergency. The exposure to\r\nthis increased and arduous labor since the passage of the act of 1850\r\nhas already had, to a most observable and injurious extent, the effect\r\nof preventing the enlistment of the best seamen in the Navy. The plan\r\nnow suggested is designed to promote a condition of service in which\r\nthis objection will no longer exist. The details of this plan may be\r\nestablished in great part, if not altogether, by the Executive under the\r\nauthority of existing laws, but I have thought it proper, in accordance\r\nwith the suggestion of the Secretary of the Navy, to submit it to your\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a corps of apprentices for the Navy, or boys to\r\nbe enlisted until they become of age, and to be employed under such\r\nregulations as the Navy Department may devise, as proposed in the\r\nreport, I cordially approve and commend to your consideration; and\r\nI also concur in the suggestion that this system for the early training\r\nof seamen may be most usefully ingrafted upon the service of our merchant\r\nmarine.\r\n\r\nThe other proposition of the report to which I have referred--the\r\nreorganization of the Naval Academy--I recommend to your attention as a\r\nproject worthy of your encouragement and support. The valuable services\r\nalready rendered by this institution entitle it to the continuance of\r\nyour fostering care.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully called to the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General for the detailed operation of his Department during\r\nthe last fiscal year, from which it will be seen that the receipts from\r\npostages for that time were less by $1,431,696 than for the preceding\r\nfiscal year, being a decrease of about 23 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis diminution is attributable to the reduction in the rates of postage\r\nmade by the act of March 3, 1851, which reduction took effect at the\r\ncommencement of the last fiscal year.\r\n\r\nAlthough in its operation during the last year the act referred to\r\nhas not fulfilled the predictions of its friends by increasing the\r\ncorrespondence of the country in proportion to the reduction of postage,\r\nI should, nevertheless, question the policy of returning to higher\r\nrates. Experience warrants the expectation that as the community becomes\r\naccustomed to cheap postage correspondence will increase. It is believed\r\nthat from this cause and from the rapid growth of the country in\r\npopulation and business the receipts of the Department must ultimately\r\nexceed its expenses, and that the country may safely rely upon the\r\ncontinuance of the present cheap rate of postage.\r\n\r\nIn former messages I have, among other things, respectfully recommended\r\nto the consideration of Congress the propriety and necessity of further\r\nlegislation for the protection and punishment of foreign consuls\r\nresiding in the United States; to revive, with certain modifications,\r\nthe act of 10th March, 1838, to restrain unlawful military expeditions\r\nagainst the inhabitants of conterminous states or territories; for the\r\npreservation and protection from mutilation or theft of the papers,\r\nrecords, and archives of the nation; for authorizing the surplus revenue\r\nto be applied to the payment of the public debt in advance of the time\r\nwhen it will become due; for the establishment of land offices for the\r\nsale of the public lands in California and the Territory of Oregon;\r\nfor the construction of a road from the Mississippi Valley to the\r\nPacific Ocean; for the establishment of a bureau of agriculture for the\r\npromotion of that interest, perhaps the most important in the country;\r\nfor the prevention of frauds upon the Government in applications for\r\npensions and bounty lands; for the establishment of a uniform fee bill,\r\nprescribing a specific compensation for every service required of\r\nclerks, district attorneys, and marshals; for authorizing an additional\r\nregiment of mounted men for the defense of our frontiers against the\r\nIndians and for fulfilling our treaty stipulations with Mexico to defend\r\nher citizens against the Indians \"with equal diligence and energy as our\r\nown;\" for determining the relative rank between the naval and civil\r\nofficers in our public ships and between the officers of the Army\r\nand Navy in the various grades of each; for reorganizing the naval\r\nestablishment by fixing the number of officers in each grade, and\r\nproviding for a retired list upon reduced pay of those unfit for active\r\nduty; for prescribing and regulating punishments in the Navy; for the\r\nappointment of a commission to revise the public statutes of the United\r\nStates by arranging them in order, supplying deficiencies, correcting\r\nincongruities, simplifying their language, and reporting them to\r\nCongress for its final action; and for the establishment of a commission\r\nto adjudicate and settle private claims against the United States. I am\r\nnot aware, however, that any of these subjects have been finally acted\r\nupon by Congress. Without repeating the reasons for legislation on these\r\nsubjects which have been assigned in former messages, I respectfully\r\nrecommend them again to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nI think it due to the several Executive Departments of this Government\r\nto bear testimony to the efficiency and integrity with which they are\r\nconducted. With all the careful superintendence which it is possible for\r\nthe heads of those Departments to exercise, still the due administration\r\nand guardianship of the public money must very much depend on the\r\nvigilance, intelligence, and fidelity of the subordinate officers and\r\nclerks, and especially on those intrusted with the settlement and\r\nadjustment of claims and accounts. I am gratified to believe that they\r\nhave generally performed their duties faithfully and well. They are\r\nappointed to guard the approaches to the public Treasury, and they\r\noccupy positions that expose them to all the temptations and seductions\r\nwhich the cupidity of peculators and fraudulent claimants can prompt\r\nthem to employ. It will be but a wise precaution to protect the\r\nGovernment against that source of mischief and corruption, as far as it\r\ncan be done, by the enactment of all proper legal penalties. The laws\r\nin this respect are supposed to be defective, and I therefore deem it\r\nmy duty to call your attention to the subject and to recommend that\r\nprovision be made by law for the punishment not only of those who shall\r\naccept bribes, but also of those who shall either promise, give, or\r\noffer to give to any of those officers or clerks a bribe or reward\r\ntouching or relating to any matter of their official action or duty.\r\n\r\nIt has been the uniform policy of this Government, from its foundation\r\nto the present day, to abstain from all interference in the domestic\r\naffairs of other nations. The consequence has been that while the\r\nnations of Europe have been engaged in desolating wars our country has\r\npursued its peaceful course to unexampled prosperity and happiness. The\r\nwars in which we have been compelled to engage in defense of the rights\r\nand honor of the country have been, fortunately, of short duration.\r\nDuring the terrific contest of nation against nation which succeeded\r\nthe French Revolution we were enabled by the wisdom and firmness of\r\nPresident Washington to maintain our neutrality. While other nations\r\nwere drawn into this wide-sweeping whirlpool, we sat quiet and unmoved\r\nupon our own shores. While the flower of their numerous armies was\r\nwasted by disease or perished by hundreds of thousands upon the\r\nbattlefield, the youth of this favored land were permitted to enjoy the\r\nblessings of peace beneath the paternal roof. While the States of Europe\r\nincurred enormous debts, under the burden of which their subjects still\r\ngroan, and which must absorb no small part of the product of the honest\r\nindustry of those countries for generations to come, the United States\r\nhave once been enabled to exhibit the proud spectacle of a nation free\r\nfrom public debt, and if permitted to pursue our prosperous way for a\r\nfew years longer in peace we may do the same again.\r\n\r\nBut it is now said by some that this policy must be changed. Europe is\r\nno longer separated from us by a voyage of months, but steam navigation\r\nhas brought her within a few days' sail of our shores. We see more of\r\nher movements and take a deeper interest in her controversies. Although\r\nno one proposes that we should join the fraternity of potentates who\r\nhave for ages lavished the blood and treasure of their subjects in\r\nmaintaining \"the balance of power,\" yet it is said that we ought to\r\ninterfere between contending sovereigns and their subjects for the\r\npurpose of overthrowing the monarchies of Europe and establishing\r\nin their place republican institutions. It is alleged that we have\r\nheretofore pursued a different course from a sense of our weakness, but\r\nthat now our conscious strength dictates a change of policy, and that it\r\nis consequently our duty to mingle in these contests and aid those who\r\nare struggling for liberty.\r\n\r\nThis is a most seductive but dangerous appeal to the generous sympathies\r\nof freemen. Enjoying, as we do, the blessings of a free Government,\r\nthere is no man who has an American heart that would not rejoice to see\r\nthese blessings extended to all other nations. We can not witness the\r\nstruggle between the oppressed and his oppressor anywhere without the\r\ndeepest sympathy for the former and the most anxious desire for his\r\ntriumph. Nevertheless, is it prudent or is it wise to involve ourselves\r\nin these foreign wars? Is it indeed true that we have heretofore\r\nrefrained from doing so merely from the degrading motive of a conscious\r\nweakness? For the honor of the patriots who have gone before us, I can\r\nnot admit it. Men of the Revolution, who drew the sword against the\r\noppressions of the mother country and pledged to Heaven \"their lives,\r\ntheir fortunes, and their sacred honor\" to maintain their freedom, could\r\nnever have been actuated by so unworthy a motive. They knew no weakness\r\nor fear where right or duty pointed the way, and it is a libel upon\r\ntheir fair fame for us, while we enjoy the blessings for which they so\r\nnobly fought and bled, to insinuate it. The truth is that the course\r\nwhich they pursued was dictated by a stern sense of international\r\njustice, by a statesmanlike prudence and a far-seeing wisdom, looking\r\nnot merely to the present necessities but to the permanent safety and\r\ninterest of the country. They knew that the world is governed less by\r\nsympathy than by reason and force; that it was not possible for this\r\nnation to become a \"propagandist\" of free principles without arraying\r\nagainst it the combined powers of Europe, and that the result was\r\nmore likely to be the overthrow of republican liberty here than its\r\nestablishment there. History has been written in vain for those who\r\ncan doubt this. France had no sooner established a republican form of\r\ngovernment than she manifested a desire to force its blessings on all\r\nthe world. Her own historian informs us that, hearing of some petty\r\nacts of tyranny in a neighboring principality, \"the National Convention\r\ndeclared that she would afford succor and fraternity to all nations\r\nwho wished to recover their liberty, and she gave it in charge to the\r\nexecutive power to give orders to the generals of the French armies\r\nto aid all citizens who might have been or should be oppressed in the\r\ncause of liberty.\" Here was the false step which led to her subsequent\r\nmisfortunes. She soon found herself involved in war with all the rest\r\nof Europe. In less than ten years her Government was changed from a\r\nrepublic to an empire, and finally, after shedding rivers of blood,\r\nforeign powers restored her exiled dynasty and exhausted Europe sought\r\npeace and repose in the unquestioned ascendency of monarchical\r\nprinciples. Let us learn wisdom from her example. Let us remember that\r\nrevolutions do not always establish freedom. Our own free institutions\r\nwere not the offspring of our Revolution. They existed before. They\r\nwere planted in the free charters of self-government under which the\r\nEnglish colonies grew up, and our Revolution only freed us from the\r\ndominion of a foreign power whose government was at variance with\r\nthose institutions. But European nations have had no such training for\r\nself-government, and every effort to establish it by bloody revolutions\r\nhas been, and must without that preparation continue to be, a failure.\r\nLiberty unregulated by law degenerates into anarchy, which soon becomes\r\nthe most horrid of all despotisms. Our policy is wisely to govern\r\nourselves, and thereby to set such an example of national justice,\r\nprosperity, and true glory as shall teach to all nations the blessings\r\nof self-government and the unparalleled enterprise and success of a free\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWe live in an age of progress, and ours is emphatically a country of\r\nprogress. Within the last half century the number of States in this\r\nUnion has nearly doubled, the population has almost quadrupled, and our\r\nboundaries have been extended from the Mississippi to the Pacific. Our\r\nterritory is checkered over with railroads and furrowed with canals. The\r\ninventive talent of our country is excited to the highest pitch, and the\r\nnumerous applications for patents for valuable improvements distinguish\r\nthis age and this people from all others. The genius of one American has\r\nenabled our commerce to move against wind and tide and that of another\r\nhas annihilated distance in the transmission of intelligence. The\r\nwhole country is full of enterprise. Our common schools are diffusing\r\nintelligence among the people and our industry is fast accumulating the\r\ncomforts and luxuries of life. This is in part owing to our peculiar\r\nposition, to our fertile soil and comparatively sparse population;\r\nbut much of it is also owing to the popular institutions under which\r\nwe live, to the freedom which every man feels to engage in any useful\r\npursuit according to his taste or inclination, and to the entire\r\nconfidence that his person and property will be protected by the laws.\r\nBut whatever may be the cause of this unparalleled growth in population,\r\nintelligence, and wealth, one thing is clear--that the Government must\r\nkeep pace with the progress of the people. It must participate in their\r\nspirit of enterprise, and while it exacts obedience to the laws and\r\nrestrains all unauthorized invasions of the rights of neighboring\r\nstates, it should foster and protect home industry and lend its powerful\r\nstrength to the improvement of such means of intercommunication as are\r\nnecessary to promote our internal commerce and strengthen the ties which\r\nbind us together as a people.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange, however much it may be regretted, that such an\r\nexuberance of enterprise should cause some individuals to mistake change\r\nfor progress and the invasion of the rights of others for national\r\nprowess and glory. The former are constantly agitating for some change\r\nin the organic law, or urging new and untried theories of human rights.\r\nThe latter are ever ready to engage in any wild crusade against a\r\nneighboring people, regardless of the justice of the enterprise and\r\nwithout looking at the fatal consequences to ourselves and to the cause\r\nof popular government. Such expeditions, however, are often stimulated\r\nby mercenary individuals, who expect to share the plunder or profit of\r\nthe enterprise without exposing themselves to danger, and are led on by\r\nsome irresponsible foreigner, who abuses the hospitality of our own\r\nGovernment by, seducing the young and ignorant to join in his scheme of\r\npersonal ambition or revenge under the false and delusive pretense of\r\nextending the area of freedom. These reprehensible aggressions but\r\nretard the true progress of our nation and tarnish its fair fame. They\r\nshould therefore receive the indignant frowns of every good citizen who\r\nsincerely loves his country and takes a pride in its prosperity and\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nOur Constitution, though not perfect, is doubtless the best that ever\r\nwas formed. Therefore let every proposition to change it be well weighed\r\nand, if found beneficial, cautiously adopted. Every patriot will rejoice\r\nto see its authority so exerted as to advance the prosperity and honor\r\nof the nation, whilst he will watch with jealousy any attempt to\r\nmutilate this charter of our liberties or pervert its powers to acts\r\nof aggression or injustice. Thus shall conservatism and progress blend\r\ntheir harmonious action in preserving the form and spirit of the\r\nConstitution and at the same time carry forward the great improvements\r\nof the country with a rapidity and energy which freemen only can\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nIn closing this my last annual communication, permit me,\r\nfellow-citizens, to congratulate you on the prosperous condition of\r\nour beloved country. Abroad its relations with all foreign powers are\r\nfriendly, its rights are respected, and its high place in the family of\r\nnations cheerfully recognized. At home we enjoy an amount of happiness,\r\npublic and private, which has probably never fallen to the lot of\r\nany other people. Besides affording to our own citizens a degree of\r\nprosperity of which on so large a scale I know of no other instance,\r\nour country is annually affording a refuge and a home to multitudes,\r\naltogether without example, from the Old World.\r\n\r\nWe owe these blessings, under Heaven, to the happy Constitution and\r\nGovernment which were bequeathed to us by our fathers, and which it is\r\nour sacred duty to transmit in all their integrity to our children. We\r\nmust all consider it a great distinction and privilege to have been\r\nchosen by the people to bear a part in the administration of such a\r\nGovernment. Called by an unexpected dispensation to its highest trust at\r\na season of embarrassment and alarm, I entered upon its arduous duties\r\nwith extreme diffidence. I claim only to have discharged them to the\r\nbest of an humble ability, with a single eye to the public good, and\r\nit is with devout gratitude in retiring from office that I leave the\r\ncountry in a state of peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation, between\r\nthe United States and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, signed at\r\nMontevideo on the 28th of August last.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, an additional article, signed in this city on the 16th\r\nultimo, to the convention for the mutual delivery of criminals fugitives\r\nfrom justice in certain cases between the United States on the one part\r\nand Prussia and other States of the Germanic Confederation on the other\r\npart, concluded on the 15th of June, 1852.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 4, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 30th ultimo, requesting\r\ninformation in regard to the establishment of a new British colony in\r\nCentral America, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and\r\nthe documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 4, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the Senate's resolution of the 3d instant, calling for\r\ninformation relative to a proposed tripartite convention on the subject\r\nof the island of Cuba, I transmit to the Senate a report from the\r\nSecretary of State and the papers which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 12, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the eleventh article of the treaty with the Chickasaw\r\nIndians signed on the 20th day of October, 1832, I herewith transmit a\r\nrecommendation from the Secretary of the Treasury for the investment\r\nof a portion of the funds belonging to said nation, for the purpose of\r\nobtaining the advice and consent of the Senate to make the investment\r\nas therein recommended.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 12, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of your honorable body of the 5th instant,\r\nI herewith communicate a report of the Secretary of the Interior giving\r\nthe information[27] required.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Relating to the Mexican boundary commission.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate dated the 13th ultimo,\r\nrequesting further information in regard to the imprisonment of the\r\nUnited States consul and of other American citizens in the castle at\r\nAcapulco, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments by which it is accompanied.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 17, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication lately received at the Department of\r\nState from the minister of Her Most Catholic Majesty, accompanied by a\r\nletter of instructions from the Spanish Government relative to the case\r\nof the _Amistad_. In Mr. Calderon's communication reference is had to\r\nformer letters addressed by him to the Department of State on the same\r\nsubject, copies of which are herewith transmitted, and an earnest wish\r\nis expressed that a final settlement of this long-pending claim should\r\nbe made. The tone of the letter of instructions from Mr. Manuel Bertran\r\nde Lis is somewhat more peremptory than could be wished, but this\r\ncircumstance will not, probably, prevent Congress from giving his\r\nsuggestions the attention to which they may be entitled.\r\n\r\nThe claim of the Spanish Government on behalf of its subjects interested\r\nin the _Amistad_ was the subject of discussion during the Administration\r\nof President Tyler between the Spanish minister and Mr. Webster, then\r\nSecretary of State. In an elaborate letter of the latter, addressed to\r\nthe Chevalier d'Argais on the 1st of September, 1841, the opinion is\r\nconfidently maintained that the claim is unfounded. The Administration\r\nof President Polk took a different view of the matter. The justice of\r\nthe claim was recognized in a letter from the Department of State to the\r\nSpanish minister of the 19th of March, 1847, and in his annual message\r\nof the same year the President recommended its payment.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the attention of Congress is again invited to\r\nthe subject. Respect to the Spanish Government demands that its urgent\r\nrepresentation should be candidly and impartially weighed. If Congress\r\nshould be of opinion that the claim is just, every consideration points\r\nto the propriety of its prompt recognition and payment, and if the two\r\nHouses should come to the opposite conclusion it is equally desirable\r\nthat the result should be announced without unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 18, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor herewith to transmit a report from the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior, from which it appears that the efforts of that Department\r\nto induce the Indians remaining in Florida to migrate to the country\r\nassigned to their tribe west of the Mississippi have been entirely\r\nunsuccessful. The only alternative that now remains is either to compel\r\nthem by force to comply with the treaty made with the tribe in May,\r\n1832, by which they agreed to migrate within three years from that\r\ndate, or allow the arrangement made with them in 1842, referred to in\r\nthe Secretary's report, by which they were permitted to remain in the\r\ntemporary occupancy of a portion of the peninsula until the Government\r\nshould see fit to remove them, to continue.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied that the withholding so large a portion of her\r\nterritory from settlement is a source of injury to the State of Florida;\r\nand although, ever since the arrangement above referred to, the Indians\r\nhave manifested a desire to remain at peace with the whites, the\r\npresence of a people who may at any time and upon any real or fancied\r\nprovocation be driven to acts of hostility is a source of constant\r\nanxiety and alarm to the inhabitants on that border.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, also, that the welfare of the Indians would be\r\npromoted by their removal from a territory where frequent collisions\r\nbetween them and their more powerful neighbors are daily becoming more\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is every reason to believe that any\r\nmanifestation of a design to remove them by force or to take possession\r\nof the territory allotted to them would be immediately retaliated by\r\nacts of cruelty on the defenseless inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe number of Indians now remaining in the State is, it is true, very\r\ninconsiderable (not exceeding, it is believed, 500), but owing to the\r\nextent of the country occupied by them and its adaptation to their\r\npeculiar mode of warfare, a force very disproportioned to their numbers\r\nwould be necessary to capture them, or even to protect the white\r\nsettlements from their incursions. The military force now stationed in\r\nthat State would be inadequate to these objects, and if it should be\r\ndetermined to enforce their removal or to survey the territory allotted\r\nto them some addition to it would be necessary, as the Government has\r\nbut a small force available for that service. Additional appropriations\r\nfor the support of the Army would also, in that event, be necessary.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I have deemed it proper to submit the whole matter to\r\nCongress, for such action as they may deem best.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 19, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 27th\r\nultimo, requesting information relative to the claims on Spain in the\r\ncases of the bark _Georgiana_ and the brig _Susan Loud, I_ transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 21, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 10th instant,\r\nrequesting certain correspondence relative to Central America, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents by\r\nwhich it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 24, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to a resolution of your honorable body of December 27,\r\n1852, in reference to claims of custom-house officers for additional\r\npay, I have the honor herewith to transmit a report from the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury giving the desired information; and in answer to the\r\nseventh interrogatory, asking \"whether in my opinion further legislation\r\nis necessary or advisable either to protect the Treasury from unjust\r\nclaims or to secure to the claimants their just rights,\" I would state\r\nthat in my opinion no further legislation is necessary to effect either\r\nobject. My views on this subject will be more fully seen on reference to\r\nan opinion given by me to the Secretary of the Treasury, a copy of which\r\nis annexed to his report.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 24, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 14th instant, relative\r\nto the award of the Emperor Louis Napoleon, of France, in the case of\r\nthe brig _General Armstrong_, I transmit a report from the Secretary of\r\nState and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 13th instant,\r\nrequesting a copy of correspondence and other documents relative\r\nto Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and the territory claimed by the Mosquito\r\nIndians, I transmit a report of the Secretary of State, to whom the\r\nresolution was referred.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nSince my last message to your honorable body, communicating a report\r\nfrom the Treasury Department, in answer to your resolution of the 3d\r\ninstant [27th ultimo?], in reference to the compensation of weighers and\r\ngangers, further communications on that subject have been received from\r\nNew Orleans, which have just been reported to me by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury and which I deem it my duty to communicate to the House.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 3, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate in a new draft the convention with the\r\nSwiss Confederation, originally negotiated at Berne and concluded in\r\nthat city on the 25th of November, 1850. On the 7th of March, 1851, it\r\nwas considered by the Senate of the United States, whose assent was\r\ngiven to it with certain amendments, as will appear from the Journal of\r\nthe Senate of that day. The convention was sent back to Switzerland with\r\nthese alterations, which were taken into consideration by the Government\r\nof that Confederation, whose action in the premises will be learned by a\r\nletter from its President of the 5th of July, 1852.\r\n\r\nThe modifications which the Government of the Swiss Confederation are\r\ndesirous of introducing into the amendments made by the Senate of the\r\nUnited States and the articles affected by them are not inconsistent\r\nwith the object and spirit of those amendments, and appear to me to\r\nproceed upon a reasonable principle of compromise.\r\n\r\nI have thought it expedient, in submitting them to the Senate with a\r\nview to their advice and consent to the ratification of the treaty in\r\nits present form, to have the entire instrument taken into a continuous\r\ndraft, as well the portions--by far the greater part--already assented\r\nto by the Senate as the modifications proposed by the Government of the\r\nSwiss Confederation in reference to these amendments. In preparing the\r\nnew draft a few slight alterations have been made in the modifications\r\nproposed by the Swiss Government.\r\n\r\nShould the convention receive the approbation of the Senate in its\r\npresent form, it will be immediately transmitted to Switzerland for\r\nratification by the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe delays which have taken place in the negotiation of this treaty have\r\nbeen principally caused by the want of a resident diplomatic agent of\r\nthe United States at Berne, and are among the reasons for which an\r\nappropriation for a chargé d'affaires to that Government has recently,\r\nby my direction, been recommended in a letter from the Department of\r\nState to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 3, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 11th ultimo,\r\nasking for information with regard to the execution of the postal\r\nconvention between the United States and Great Britain, I transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State and the documents which accompanied\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 7, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving in my message to Congress at the opening of the session adverted\r\nto the pending negotiations between this Government and that of Great\r\nBritain relative to the fisheries and commercial reciprocity with the\r\nBritish American Provinces, I transmit for the information of Congress\r\nthe accompanying report from the Department of State on the present\r\nstate of the negotiations, and I respectfully invite the attention of\r\nthe two Houses to the suggestion in the latter part of the report.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 9, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a communication from the Secretary of the Navy,\r\naccompanied by the first part of Lieutenant Herndon's report of the\r\nexploration of the valley of the Amazon and its tributaries, made by him\r\nin connection with lieutenant Gardner Gibbon, under instructions from\r\nthe Navy Department.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 14, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate, for its consideration with a\r\nview to ratification, a convention on the subject of the extradition\r\nof fugitives from justice between the United States and Belgium,\r\nconcluded and signed in this city on the 11th instant by the respective\r\nplenipotentiaries.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, embodying the substance\r\nof recent communications made by the minister of Her Britannic Majesty\r\nto the Department of State on the subject of the interoceanic canal by\r\nthe Nicaragua route, which formed the chief object of the treaty between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain of the 19th April, 1850, and the\r\nrelations of Great Britain to the protectorate of Mosquito, which she\r\nexpresses herself desirous of relinquishing on terms consistent with\r\nher honorable engagements to the Indians of that name.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these communications and other considerations stated\r\nin the report, it is deemed advisable by the Department that our\r\ndiplomatic relations with the States of Central America should be placed\r\non a higher and more efficient footing, and this measure meets my\r\napprobation. The whole subject is one of so much delicacy and importance\r\nthat I should have preferred, so near the close of my Administration,\r\nnot to make it the subject of an Executive communication. But inasmuch\r\nas the measure proposed can not, even if deemed expedient by my\r\nsuccessor, take effect for near a twelvemonth unless an appropriation is\r\nmade by this Congress, I have thought it my duty to submit the report of\r\nthe Department to the two Houses. The importance of the measure seemed\r\nto require an exposition somewhat in detail of the grounds on which it\r\nis recommended.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, with the view to its ratification, a\r\nconvention which was yesterday concluded between the United States\r\nand Great Britain for the establishment of international copyright.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 19, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 14th instant, relative\r\nto the fisheries on the coasts of Florida, I transmit herewith a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State and the documents which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of the 19th of February instant,\r\nI herewith communicate a report from the Secretary of War, containing\r\nthe report of Lieutenant Meigs, of the Engineer Corps, on the surveys,\r\nprojects, and estimates for supplying the cities of Washington and\r\nGeorgetown with an unfailing and abundant supply of water.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury of the 21st instant, in reference to the reinvestment of\r\ncertain moneys belonging to the Chickasaw Nation of Indians which will\r\ncome into the Treasury during the succeeding vacation of the Senate,\r\nand I respectfully concur in the recommendation made by the Secretary.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for advice and consent with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and Her Britannic\r\nMajesty for the adjustment of certain claims of citizens of the United\r\nStates on the British Government and of British subjects on the\r\nGovernment of the United States, signed in London on the 8th instant.\r\nAlthough it is stipulated by the terms of the first article of the\r\nconvention that the commissioner on the part of this Government shall be\r\nappointed by the President of the United States, it is not understood\r\nthat this stipulation was intended to dispense with the concurrence of\r\nthe Senate in such appointment.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a consular convention concluded in this city on the\r\n23d instant between the United States and His Majesty the Emperor\r\nof the French.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 26, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a proclamation of yesterday, which I deemed it\r\nadvisable to issue, relative to an extraordinary session of the Senate\r\non the 4th of March next.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 17th January last,\r\nrequesting information in regard to the fisheries on the coasts of the\r\nBritish North American Provinces, I transmit a report from the Secretary\r\nof State and the documents which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit, for the consideration and advice of the Senate, a\r\ntreaty recently entered into with the Apache Indians in New Mexico by\r\nColonel Stunner and Mr. Greiner, acting on behalf of the United States,\r\ntogether with the letter of Colonel Sumner on the subject of the treaty\r\nand reports thereon from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the\r\nSecretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attention of the President having been called to the proceedings of\r\nCongress at the close of its session on the 4th of March, 1851, from\r\nwhich it appears that the constitutional term of that body was held\r\nnot to have expired until 12 o'clock at noon of that day, and a notice\r\nhaving been issued, agreeably to former usage, to convene the Senate at\r\n11 o'clock a. m. on the 4th of March next, it is apparent that such call\r\nis in conflict with the decision aforesaid:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, as well for the purpose of removing all doubt as to the\r\nlegality of such call as of establishing a precedent of what is deemed\r\na proper mode of convening the Senate, I, Millard Fillmore, President\r\nof the United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue this\r\nmy proclamation, revoking said call and hereby declaring that an\r\nextraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States to\r\nconvene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city of\r\nWashington, on Friday, the 4th day of March next, at 12 o'clock at noon\r\nof that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as\r\nmembers of that body are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthis 25th day of February, A.D. 1853, and of the Independence Of the\r\nUnited States the seventy-seventh.\r\n\r\nMILLARD FILLMORE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  EDWARD EVERETT,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.",
