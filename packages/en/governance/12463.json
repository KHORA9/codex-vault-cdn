  "content": "A COMPILATION OF THE MESSAGES AND PAPERS OF THE PRESIDENTS\r\n\r\nBY JAMES D. RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nJames K. Polk\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1845, to March 4, 1849\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames K. Polk\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES KNOX POLK was born in Mecklenburg County, N.C., November 2, 1795.\r\nHe was a son of Samuel Polk, a farmer, whose father, Ezekiel, and his\r\nbrother, Colonel Thomas Polk, one of the signers of the Mecklenburg\r\nDeclaration of Independence, were sons of Robert Polk (or Pollock), who\r\nwas born in Ireland and emigrated to America. His mother was Jane,\r\ndaughter of James Knox, a resident of Iredell County, N.C., and a\r\ncaptain in the War of the Revolution. His father removed to Tennessee in\r\nthe autumn of 1806, and settled in the valley of Duck River, a tributary\r\nof the Tennessee, in a section that was erected the following year into\r\nthe county of Maury; he died in 1827. James was brought up on the farm;\r\nwas inclined to study, and was fond of reading. He was sent to school,\r\nand had succeeded in mastering the English branches when ill health\r\ncompelled his removal. Was then placed with a merchant, but, having a\r\nstrong dislike to commercial pursuits, soon returned home, and in July,\r\n1813, was given in charge of a private tutor. In 1815 entered the\r\nsophomore class at the University of North Carolina. As a student he was\r\ncorrect, punctual, and industrious. At his graduation in 1818 he was\r\nofficially acknowledged to be the best scholar in both the classics and\r\nmathematics, and delivered the Latin salutatory. In 1847 the university\r\nconferred upon him the degree of LL.D. In 1819 he entered the law office\r\nof Felix Grundy, then at the head of the Tennessee bar. While pursuing\r\nhis legal studies he attracted the attention of Andrew Jackson, and an\r\nintimacy was thus begun between the two men. In 1820 Mr. Polk was\r\nadmitted to the bar, and established himself at Columbia, the county\r\nseat of Maury County. He attained immediate success, his career at the\r\nbar only ending with his election to the governorship of Tennessee in\r\n1839. Brought up as a Jeffersonian and early taking an interest in\r\npolitics, he was frequently heard in public as an exponent of the views\r\nof his party. His style of oratory was so popular that his services soon\r\ncame to be in great demand, and he was not long in earning the title of\r\nthe \"Napoleon of the Stump.\" His first public employment was that of\r\nprincipal clerk of the senate of the State of Tennessee. In 1823 was\r\nelected a member of that body. In January, 1824, he married Sarah,\r\ndaughter of Joel Childress, a merchant of Rutherford County, Tenn. In\r\nAugust, 1825, he was elected to Congress from the Duck River district,\r\nand reelected at every succeeding election till 1839, when he withdrew\r\nfrom the contest to become a candidate for governor. With one or two\r\nexceptions, he was the youngest member of the Nineteenth Congress. He\r\nwas prominently connected with every leading question, and upon all he\r\nstruck what proved to be the keynote for the action of his party. His\r\nmaiden speech was in defense of the proposed amendment to the\r\nConstitution giving the choice of the President and Vice-President\r\ndirectly to the people. It at once placed him in the front rank of\r\nCongressional debaters. He opposed the appropriation for the Panama\r\nmission, asked for by President Adams, contending that such action would\r\ntend to involve the United States in a war with Spain and establish an\r\nunfortunate precedent. In December, 1827, he was placed on the Committee\r\non Foreign Affairs, and afterwards was also appointed chairman of the\r\nselect committee to which was referred that portion of President Adams's\r\nmessage calling attention to the probable accumulation of a surplus in\r\nthe Treasury after the anticipated extinguishment of the national debt.\r\nAs the head of the latter committee he made a report denying the\r\nconstitutional power of Congress to collect from the people for\r\ndistribution a surplus beyond the wants of the Government, and\r\nmaintaining that the revenue should be reduced to the requirements of\r\nthe public service. During the whole period of President Jackson's\r\nAdministration he was one of its leading supporters, and at times its\r\nchief reliance. Early in 1833, as a member of the Ways and Means\r\nCommittee, he made a minority report unfavorable to the Bank of the\r\nUnited States. During the entire contest between the bank and President\r\nJackson, caused by the removal of the deposits in October, 1833, Mr.\r\nPolk, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, supported the\r\nExecutive. He was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in\r\nDecember, 1835, and held that office till 1839. It was his fortune to\r\npreside over the House at a period when party feelings were excited to\r\nan unusual degree, and notwithstanding the fact that during the first\r\nsession more appeals were taken from his decisions than were ever known\r\nbefore, he was uniformly sustained by the House, and frequently by\r\nleading members of the Whig party. He gave to the Administration of\r\nMartin Van Buren the same unhesitating support he had accorded to that\r\nof President Jackson. On leaving Congress he became the candidate of the\r\nDemocrats of Tennessee for governor, and was elected by over 2,500\r\nmajority. He was an unsuccessful candidate for governor again in 1841\r\nand 1843. In 1839 he was nominated by the legislatures of Tennessee and\r\nother States for Vice-President of the United States, but Richard M.\r\nJohnson, of Kentucky, was the choice of the great body of the Democratic\r\nparty, and was accordingly nominated. On May 27, 1844, Mr. Polk was\r\nnominated for President of the United States by the national Democratic\r\nconvention at Baltimore, and on November 12 was elected, receiving about\r\n40,000 majority on the popular vote, and 170 electoral votes to 105 that\r\nwere cast for Henry Clay. He was inaugurated March 4, 1845. Among the\r\nimportant events of his Administration were the establishment of the\r\nUnited States Naval Academy; the consummation of the annexation of\r\nTexas; the admission of Texas, Iowa, and Wisconsin as States; the war\r\nwith Mexico, resulting in a treaty of peace, by which the United States\r\nacquired New Mexico and Upper California; the treaty with Great Britain\r\nsettling the Oregon boundary; the establishment of the \"warehouse\r\nsystem;\" the reenactment of the independent-treasury system; the passage\r\nof the act establishing the Smithsonian Institution; the treaty with New\r\nGranada, the thirty-fifth article of which secured for citizens of the\r\nUnited States the right of way across the Isthmus of Panama; and the\r\ncreation of the Department of the Interior. He declined to become a\r\ncandidate for reelection, and at the conclusion of his term retired to\r\nhis home in Nashville. He died June 15, 1849, and was buried at Polk\r\nPlace, in Nashville. September 19, 1893, the remains were removed by the\r\nState to Capitol Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: Without solicitation on my part, I have been chosen by\r\nthe free and voluntary suffrages of my countrymen to the most honorable\r\nand most responsible office on earth. I am deeply impressed with\r\ngratitude for the confidence reposed in me. Honored with this\r\ndistinguished consideration at an earlier period of life than any of my\r\nfxpredecessors, I can not disguise the diffidence with which I am about\r\nto enter on the discharge of my official duties.\r\n\r\nIf the more aged and experienced men who have filled the office of\r\nPresident of the United States even in the infancy of the Republic\r\ndistrusted their ability to discharge the duties of that exalted\r\nstation, what ought not to be the apprehensions of one so much younger\r\nand less endowed now that our domain extends from ocean to ocean, that\r\nour people have so greatly increased in numbers, and at a time when so\r\ngreat diversity of opinion prevails in regard to the principles and\r\npolicy which should characterize the administration of our Government?\r\nWell may the boldest fear and the wisest tremble when incurring\r\nresponsibilities on which may depend our country's peace and prosperity,\r\nand in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family.\r\n\r\nIn assuming responsibilities so vast I fervently invoke the aid of that\r\nAlmighty Ruler of the Universe in whose hands are the destinies of\r\nnations and of men to guard this Heaven-favored land against the\r\nmischiefs which without His guidance might arise from an unwise public\r\npolicy. With a firm reliance upon the wisdom of Omnipotence to sustain\r\nand direct me in the path of duty which I am appointed to pursue, I\r\nstand in the presence of this assembled multitude of my countrymen to\r\ntake upon myself the solemn obligation \"to the best of my ability to\r\npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nA concise enumeration of the principles which will guide me in the\r\nadministrative policy of the Government is not only in accordance with\r\nthe examples set me by all my predecessors, but is eminently befitting\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution itself, plainly written as it is, the safeguard of our\r\nfederative compact, the offspring of concession and compromise, binding\r\ntogether in the bonds of peace and union this great and increasing\r\nfamily of free and independent States, will be the chart by which I\r\nshall be directed.\r\n\r\nIt will be my first care to administer the Government in the true spirit\r\nof that instrument, and to assume no powers not expressly granted or\r\nclearly implied in its terms. The Government of the United States is one\r\nof delegated and limited powers, and it is by a strict adherence to the\r\nclearly granted powers and by abstaining from the exercise of doubtful\r\nor unauthorized implied powers that we have the only sure guaranty\r\nagainst the recurrence of those unfortunate collisions between the\r\nFederal and State authorities which have occasionally so much disturbed\r\nthe harmony of our system and even threatened the perpetuity of our\r\nglorious Union.\r\n\r\n\"To the States, respectively, or to the people\" have been reserved \"the\r\npowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor\r\nprohibited by it to the States.\" Each State is a complete sovereignty\r\nwithin the sphere of its reserved powers. The Government of the Union,\r\nacting within the sphere of its delegated authority, is also a complete\r\nsovereignty. While the General Government should abstain from the\r\nexercise of authority not clearly delegated to it, the States should be\r\nequally careful that in the maintenance of their rights they do not\r\noverstep the limits of powers reserved to them. One of the most\r\ndistinguished of my predecessors attached deserved importance to \"the\r\nsupport of the State governments in all their rights, as the most\r\ncompetent administration for our domestic concerns and the surest\r\nbulwark against antirepublican tendencies,\" and to the \"preservation of\r\nthe General Government in its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet\r\nanchor of our peace at home and safety abroad.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Government of the United States has been intrusted the exclusive\r\nmanagement of our foreign affairs. Beyond that it wields a few general\r\nenumerated powers. It does not force reform on the States. It leaves\r\nindividuals, over whom it casts its protecting influence, entirely free\r\nto improve their own condition by the legitimate exercise of all their\r\nmental and physical powers. It is a common protector of each and all the\r\nStates; of every man who lives upon our soil, whether of native or\r\nforeign birth; of every religious sect, in their worship of the Almighty\r\naccording to the dictates of their own conscience; of every shade of\r\nopinion, and the most free inquiry; of every art, trade, and occupation\r\nconsistent with the laws of the States. And we rejoice in the general\r\nhappiness, prosperity, and advancement of our country, which have been\r\nthe offspring of freedom, and not of power.\r\n\r\nThis most admirable and wisest system of well-regulated self-government\r\namong men ever devised by human minds has been tested by its successful\r\noperation for more than half a century, and if preserved from the\r\nusurpations of the Federal Government on the one hand and the exercise\r\nby the States of powers not reserved to them on the other, will, I\r\nfervently hope and believe, endure for ages to come and dispense the\r\nblessings of civil and religious liberty to distant generations. To\r\neffect objects so dear to every patriot I shall devote myself with\r\nanxious solicitude. It will be my desire to guard against that most\r\nfruitful source of danger to the harmonious action of our system which\r\nconsists in substituting the mere discretion and caprice of the\r\nExecutive or of majorities in the legislative department of the\r\nGovernment for powers which have been withheld from the Federal\r\nGovernment by the Constitution. By the theory of our Government\r\nmajorities rule, but this right is not an arbitrary or unlimited one. It\r\nis a right to be exercised in subordination to the Constitution and in\r\nconformity to it. One great object of the Constitution was to restrain\r\nmajorities from oppressing minorities or encroaching upon their just\r\nrights. Minorities have a right to appeal to the Constitution as a\r\nshield against such oppression.\r\n\r\nThat the blessings of liberty which our Constitution secures may be\r\nenjoyed alike by minorities and majorities, the Executive has been\r\nwisely invested with a qualified veto upon the acts of the Legislature.\r\nIt is a negative power, and is conservative in its character. It arrests\r\nfor the time hasty, inconsiderate, or unconstitutional legislation,\r\ninvites reconsideration, and transfers questions at issue between the\r\nlegislative and executive departments to the tribunal of the people.\r\nLike all other powers, it is subject to be abused. When judiciously and\r\nproperly exercised, the Constitution itself may be saved from infraction\r\nand the rights of all preserved and protected.\r\n\r\nThe inestimable value of our Federal Union is felt and acknowledged by\r\nall. By this system of united and confederated States our people are\r\npermitted collectively and individually to seek their own happiness in\r\ntheir own way, and the consequences have been most auspicious. Since the\r\nUnion was formed the number of the States has increased from thirteen to\r\ntwenty-eight; two of these have taken their position as members of the\r\nConfederacy within the last week. Our population has increased from\r\nthree to twenty millions. New communities and States are seeking\r\nprotection under its ægis, and multitudes from the Old World are\r\nflocking to our shores to participate in its blessings. Beneath its\r\nbenign sway peace and prosperity prevail. Freed from the burdens and\r\nmiseries of war, our trade and intercourse have extended throughout the\r\nworld. Mind, no longer tasked in devising means to accomplish or resist\r\nschemes of ambition, usurpation, or conquest, is devoting itself to\r\nman's true interests in developing his faculties and powers and the\r\ncapacity of nature to minister to his enjoyments. Genius is free to\r\nannounce its inventions and discoveries, and the hand is free to\r\naccomplish whatever the head conceives not incompatible with the rights\r\nof a fellow-being. All distinctions of birth or of rank have been\r\nabolished. All citizens, whether native or adopted, are placed upon\r\nterms of precise equality. All are entitled to equal rights and equal\r\nprotection. No union exists between church and state, and perfect\r\nfreedom of opinion is guaranteed to all sects and creeds.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the blessings secured to our happy land by our Federal\r\nUnion. To perpetuate them it is our sacred duty to preserve it. Who\r\nshall assign limits to the achievements of free minds and free hands\r\nunder the protection of this glorious Union? No treason to mankind since\r\nthe organization of society would be equal in atrocity to that of him\r\nwho would lift his hand to destroy it. He would overthrow the noblest\r\nstructure of human wisdom, which protects himself and his fellow-man. He\r\nwould stop the progress of free government and involve his country\r\neither in anarchy or despotism. He would extinguish the fire of liberty,\r\nwhich warms and animates the hearts of happy millions and invites all\r\nthe nations of the earth to imitate our example. If he say that error\r\nand wrong are committed in the administration of the Government, let him\r\nremember that nothing human can be perfect, and that under no other\r\nsystem of government revealed by Heaven or devised by man has reason\r\nbeen allowed so free and broad a scope to combat error. Has the sword of\r\ndespots proved to be a safer or surer instrument of reform in government\r\nthan enlightened reason? Does he expect to find among the ruins of this\r\nUnion a happier abode for our swarming millions than they now have under\r\nit? Every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the\r\npossibility of its dissolution, and will be ready to adopt the patriotic\r\nsentiment, \"Our Federal Union--it must be preserved.\" To preserve it the\r\ncompromises which alone enabled our fathers to form a common\r\nconstitution for the government and protection of so many States and\r\ndistinct communities, of such diversified habits, interests, and\r\ndomestic institutions, must be sacredly and religiously observed. Any\r\nattempt to disturb or destroy these compromises, being terms of the\r\ncompact of union, can lead to none other than the most ruinous and\r\ndisastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of deep regret that in some sections of our country\r\nmisguided persons have occasionally indulged in schemes and agitations\r\nwhose object is the destruction of domestic institutions existing in\r\nother sections--institutions which existed at the adoption of the\r\nConstitution and were recognized and protected by it. All must see that\r\nif it were possible for them to be successful in attaining their object\r\nthe dissolution of the Union and the consequent destruction of our happy\r\nform of government must speedily follow.\r\n\r\nI am happy to believe that at every period of our existence as a nation\r\nthere has existed, and continues to exist, among the great mass of our\r\npeople a devotion to the Union of the States which will shield and\r\nprotect it against the moral treason of any who would seriously\r\ncontemplate its destruction. To secure a continuance of that devotion\r\nthe compromises of the Constitution must not only be preserved, but\r\nsectional jealousies and heartburnings must be discountenanced, and all\r\nshould remember that they are members of the same political family,\r\nhaving a common destiny. To increase the attachment of our people to the\r\nUnion, our laws should be just. Any policy which shall tend to favor\r\nmonopolies or the peculiar interests of sections or classes must operate\r\nto the prejudice of the interests of their fellow-citizens, and should\r\nbe avoided. If the compromises of the Constitution be preserved, if\r\nsectional jealousies and heartburnings be discountenanced, if our laws\r\nbe just and the Government be practically administered strictly within\r\nthe limits of power prescribed to it, we may discard all apprehensions\r\nfor the safety of the Union.\r\n\r\nWith these views of the nature, character, and objects of the Government\r\nand the value of the Union, I shall steadily oppose the creation of\r\nthose institutions and systems which in their nature tend to pervert it\r\nfrom its legitimate purposes and make it the instrument of sections,\r\nclasses, and individuals. We need no national banks or other extraneous\r\ninstitutions planted around the Government to control or strengthen it\r\nin opposition to the will of its authors. Experience has taught us how\r\nunnecessary they are as auxiliaries of the public authorities--how\r\nimpotent for good and how powerful for mischief.\r\n\r\nOurs was intended to be a plain and frugal government, and I shall\r\nregard it to be my duty to recommend to Congress and, as far as the\r\nExecutive is concerned, to enforce by all the means within my power the\r\nstrictest economy in the expenditure of the public money which may be\r\ncompatible with the public interests.\r\n\r\nA national debt has become almost an institution of European monarchies.\r\nIt is viewed in some of them as an essential prop to existing\r\ngovernments. Melancholy is the condition of that people whose government\r\ncan be sustained only by a system which periodically transfers large\r\namounts from the labor of the many to the coffers of the few. Such a\r\nsystem is incompatible with the ends for which our republican Government\r\nwas instituted. Under a wise policy the debts contracted in our\r\nRevolution and during the War of 1812 have been happily extinguished. By\r\na judicious application of the revenues not required for other necessary\r\npurposes, it is not doubted that the debt which has grown out of the\r\ncircumstances of the last few years may be speedily paid off.\r\n\r\nI congratulate my fellow-citizens on the entire restoration of the\r\ncredit of the General Government of the Union and that of many of the\r\nStates. Happy would it be for the indebted States if they were freed\r\nfrom their liabilities, many of which were incautiously contracted.\r\nAlthough the Government of the Union is neither in a legal nor a moral\r\nsense bound for the debts of the States, and it would be a violation of\r\nour compact of union to assume them, yet we can not but feel a deep\r\ninterest in seeing all the States meet their public liabilities and pay\r\noff their just debts at the earliest practicable period. That they will\r\ndo so as soon as it can be done without imposing too heavy burdens on\r\ntheir citizens there is no reason to doubt. The sound moral and\r\nhonorable feeling of the people of the indebted States can not be\r\nquestioned, and we are happy to perceive a settled disposition on their\r\npart, as their ability returns after a season of unexampled pecuniary\r\nembarrassment, to pay off all just demands and to acquiesce in any\r\nreasonable measures to accomplish that object.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties which we have had to encounter in the practical\r\nadministration of the Government consists in the adjustment of our\r\nrevenue laws and the levy of the taxes necessary for the support of\r\nGovernment. In the general proposition that no more money shall be\r\ncollected than the necessities of an economical administration shall\r\nrequire all parties seem to acquiesce. Nor does there seem to be any\r\nmaterial difference of opinion as to the absence of right in the\r\nGovernment to tax one section of country, or one class of citizens, or\r\none occupation, for the mere profit of another. \"Justice and sound\r\npolicy forbid the Federal Government to foster one branch of industry to\r\nthe detriment of another, or to cherish the interests of one portion to\r\nthe injury of another portion of our common country.\" I have heretofore\r\ndeclared to my fellow-citizens that \"in my judgment it is the duty of\r\nthe Government to extend, as far as it may be practicable to do so, by\r\nits revenue laws and all other means within its power, fair and just\r\nprotection to all the great interests of the whole Union, embracing\r\nagriculture, manufactures, the mechanic arts, commerce, and navigation.\"\r\nI have also declared my opinion to be \"in favor of a tariff for\r\nrevenue,\" and that \"in adjusting the details of such a tariff I have\r\nsanctioned such moderate discriminating duties as would produce the\r\namount of revenue needed and at the same time afford reasonable\r\nincidental protection to our home industry,\" and that I was \"opposed to\r\na tariff for protection merely, and not for revenue.\"\r\n\r\nThe power \"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises\" was\r\nan indispensable one to be conferred on the Federal Government, which\r\nwithout it would possess no means of providing for its own support.\r\nIn executing this power by levying a tariff of duties for the support\r\nof Government, the raising of _revenue_ should be the _object_ and\r\n_protection_ the _incident_. To reverse this principle and make\r\n_protection_ the _object_ and _revenue_ the _incident_ would be to\r\ninflict manifest injustice upon all other than the protected interests.\r\nIn levying duties for revenue it is doubtless proper to make such\r\ndiscriminations within the _revenue principle_ as will afford incidental\r\nprotection to our home interests. Within the revenue limit there is a\r\ndiscretion to discriminate; beyond that limit the rightful exercise\r\nof the power is not conceded. The incidental protection afforded to\r\nour home interests by discriminations within the revenue range it is\r\nbelieved will be ample. In making discriminations all our home interests\r\nshould as far as practicable be equally protected. The largest portion\r\nof our people are agriculturists. Others are employed in manufactures,\r\ncommerce, navigation, and the mechanic arts. They are all engaged\r\nin their respective pursuits, and their joint labors constitute the\r\nnational or home industry. To tax one branch of this home industry for\r\nthe benefit of another would be unjust. No one of these interests can\r\nrightfully claim an advantage over the others, or to be enriched by\r\nimpoverishing the others. All are equally entitled to the fostering care\r\nand protection of the Government. In exercising a sound discretion in\r\nlevying discriminating duties within the limit prescribed, care should\r\nbe taken that it be done in a manner not to benefit the wealthy few at\r\nthe expense of the toiling millions by taxing _lowest_ the luxuries of\r\nlife, or articles of superior quality and high price, which can only be\r\nconsumed by the wealthy, and _highest_ the necessaries of life, or\r\narticles of coarse quality and low price, which the poor and great mass\r\nof our people must consume. The burdens of government should as far as\r\npracticable be distributed justly and equally among all classes of our\r\npopulation. These general views, long entertained on this subject,\r\nI have deemed it proper to reiterate. It is a subject upon which\r\nconflicting interests of sections and occupations are supposed to exist,\r\nand a spirit of mutual concession and compromise in adjusting its\r\ndetails should be cherished by every part of our widespread country as\r\nthe only means of preserving harmony and a cheerful acquiescence of all\r\nin the operation of our revenue laws. Our patriotic citizens in every\r\npart of the Union will readily submit to the payment of such taxes as\r\nshall be needed for the support of their Government, whether in peace or\r\nin war, if they are so levied as to distribute the burdens as equally as\r\npossible among them.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Texas has made known her desire to come into our Union,\r\nto form a part of our Confederacy and enjoy with us the blessings of\r\nliberty secured and guaranteed by our Constitution. Texas was once a\r\npart of our country--was unwisely ceded away to a foreign power--is now\r\nindependent, and possesses an undoubted right to dispose of a part or\r\nthe whole of her territory and to merge her sovereignty as a separate\r\nand independent state in ours. I congratulate my country that by an act\r\nof the late Congress of the United States the assent of this Government\r\nhas been given to the reunion, and it only remains for the two countries\r\nto agree upon the terms to consummate an object so important to both.\r\n\r\nI regard the question of annexation as belonging exclusively to the\r\nUnited States and Texas. They are independent powers competent to\r\ncontract, and foreign nations have no right to interfere with them or\r\nto take exceptions to their reunion. Foreign powers do not seem to\r\nappreciate the true character of our Government. Our Union is a\r\nconfederation of independent States, whose policy is peace with each\r\nother and all the world. To enlarge its limits is to extend the\r\ndominions of peace over additional territories and increasing millions.\r\nThe world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our Government.\r\nWhile the Chief Magistrate and the popular branch of Congress are\r\nelected for short terms by the suffrages of those millions who must\r\nin their own persons bear all the burdens and miseries of war, our\r\nGovernment can not be otherwise than pacific. Foreign powers should\r\ntherefore look on the annexation of Texas to the United States not as\r\nthe conquest of a nation seeking to extend her dominions by arms and\r\nviolence, but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once her own,\r\nby adding another member to our confederation, with the consent of that\r\nmember, thereby diminishing the chances of war and opening to them new\r\nand ever-increasing markets for their products.\r\n\r\nTo Texas the reunion is important, because the strong protecting arm of\r\nour Government would be extended over her, and the vast resources of her\r\nfertile soil and genial climate would be speedily developed, while the\r\nsafety of New Orleans and of our whole southwestern frontier against\r\nhostile aggression, as well as the interests of the whole Union, would\r\nbe promoted by it.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier stages of our national existence the opinion prevailed\r\nwith some that our system of confederated States could not operate\r\nsuccessfully over an extended territory, and serious objections have at\r\ndifferent times been made to the enlargement of our boundaries. These\r\nobjections were earnestly urged when we acquired Louisiana. Experience\r\nhas shown that they were not well founded. The title of numerous Indian\r\ntribes to vast tracts of country has been extinguished; new States have\r\nbeen admitted into the Union; new Territories have been created and\r\nour jurisdiction and laws extended over them. As our population has\r\nexpanded, the Union has been cemented and strengthened. As our\r\nboundaries have been enlarged and our agricultural population has\r\nbeen spread over a large surface, our federative system has acquired\r\nadditional strength and security. It may well be doubted whether it\r\nwould not be in greater danger of overthrow if our present population\r\nwere confined to the comparatively narrow limits of the original\r\nthirteen States than it is now that they are sparsely settled over a\r\nmore expanded territory. It is confidently believed that our system may\r\nbe safely extended to the utmost bounds of our territorial limits, and\r\nthat as it shall be extended the bonds of our Union, so far from being\r\nweakened, will become stronger.\r\n\r\nNone can fail to see the danger to our safety and future peace if Texas\r\nremains an independent state or becomes an ally or dependency of some\r\nforeign nation more powerful than herself. Is there one among our\r\ncitizens who would not prefer perpetual peace with Texas to occasional\r\nwars, which so often occur between bordering independent nations? Is\r\nthere one who would not prefer free intercourse with her to high duties\r\non all our products and manufactures which enter her ports or cross\r\nher frontiers? Is there one who would not prefer an unrestricted\r\ncommunication with her citizens to the frontier obstructions which must\r\noccur if she remains out of the Union? Whatever is good or evil in the\r\nlocal institutions of Texas will remain her own whether annexed to the\r\nUnited States or not. None of the present States will be responsible for\r\nthem any more than they are for the local institutions of each other.\r\nThey have confederated together for certain specified objects. Upon the\r\nsame principle that they would refuse to form a perpetual union with\r\nTexas because of her local institutions our forefathers would have been\r\nprevented from forming our present Union. Perceiving no valid objection\r\nto the measure and many reasons for its adoption vitally affecting the\r\npeace, the safety, and the prosperity of both countries, I shall on the\r\nbroad principle which formed the basis and produced the adoption of our\r\nConstitution, and not in any narrow spirit of sectional policy, endeavor\r\nby all constitutional, honorable, and appropriate means to consummate\r\nthe expressed will of the people and Government of the United States by\r\nthe reannexation of Texas to our Union at the earliest practicable\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nNor will it become in a less degree my duty to assert and maintain by\r\nall constitutional means the right of the United States to that portion\r\nof our territory which lies beyond the Rocky Mountains. Our title to the\r\ncountry of the Oregon is \"clear and unquestionable,\" and already are our\r\npeople preparing to perfect that title by occupying it with their wives\r\nand children. But eighty years ago our population was confined on the\r\nwest by the ridge of the Alleghanies. Within that period--within the\r\nlifetime, I might say, of some of my hearers--our people, increasing to\r\nmany millions, have filled the eastern valley of the Mississippi,\r\nadventurously ascended the Missouri to its headsprings, and are already\r\nengaged in establishing the blessings of self-government in valleys of\r\nwhich the rivers flow to the Pacific. The world beholds the peaceful\r\ntriumphs of the industry of our emigrants. To us belongs the duty of\r\nprotecting them adequately wherever they may be upon our soil. The\r\njurisdiction of our laws and the benefits of our republican institutions\r\nshould be extended over them in the distant regions which they have\r\nselected for their homes. The increasing facilities of intercourse will\r\neasily bring the States, of which the formation in that part of our\r\nterritory can not be long delayed, within the sphere of our federative\r\nUnion. In the meantime every obligation imposed by treaty or\r\nconventional stipulations should be sacredly respected.\r\n\r\nIn the management of our foreign relations it will be my aim to observe\r\na careful respect for the rights of other nations, while our own will be\r\nthe subject of constant watchfulness. Equal and exact justice should\r\ncharacterize all our intercourse with foreign countries. All alliances\r\nhaving a tendency to jeopard the welfare and honor of our country or\r\nsacrifice any one of the national interests will be studiously avoided,\r\nand yet no opportunity will be lost to cultivate a favorable\r\nunderstanding with foreign governments by which our navigation and\r\ncommerce may be extended and the ample products of our fertile soil, as\r\nwell as the manufactures of our skillful artisans, find a ready market\r\nand remunerating prices in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nIn taking \"care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" a strict\r\nperformance of duty will be exacted from all public officers. From\r\nthose officers, especially, who are charged with the collection and\r\ndisbursement of the public revenue will prompt and rigid accountability\r\nbe required. Any culpable failure or delay on their part to account for\r\nthe moneys intrusted to them at the times and in the manner required by\r\nlaw will in every instance terminate the official connection of such\r\ndefaulting officer with the Government.\r\n\r\nAlthough in our country the Chief Magistrate must almost of necessity be\r\nchosen by a party and stand pledged to its principles and measures, yet\r\nin his official action he should not be the President of a part only,\r\nbut of the whole people of the United States. While he executes the laws\r\nwith an impartial hand, shrinks from no proper responsibility, and\r\nfaithfully carries out in the executive department of the Government the\r\nprinciples and policy of those who have chosen him, he should not be\r\nunmindful that our fellow-citizens who have differed with him in opinion\r\nare entitled to the full and free exercise of their opinions and\r\njudgments, and that the rights of all are entitled to respect and\r\nregard.\r\n\r\nConfidently relying upon the aid and assistance of the coordinate\r\ndepartments of the Government in conducting our public affairs, I enter\r\nupon the discharge of the high duties which have been assigned me by the\r\npeople, again humbly supplicating that Divine Being who has watched over\r\nand protected our beloved country from its infancy to the present hour\r\nto continue His gracious benedictions upon us, that we may continue to\r\nbe a prosperous and happy people.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 15, _1845.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have received and maturely considered the two resolutions adopted by\r\nthe Senate in executive session on the 12th instant, the first\r\nrequesting the President to communicate information to the Senate (in\r\nconfidence) of any steps which have been taken, if any were taken, by\r\nthe late President in execution of the resolution of Congress entitled\r\n\"A joint resolution for the annexation of Texas to the United States,\"\r\nand if any such steps have been taken, then to inform the Senate whether\r\nanything has been done by him to counteract, suspend, or reverse the\r\naction of the late President in the premises; and the second requesting\r\nthe President \"to inform the Senate what communications have been made\r\nby the Mexican minister in consequence of the proceedings of Congress\r\nand the Executive in relation to Texas.\"\r\n\r\nWith the highest respect for the Senate and a sincere desire to furnish\r\nall the information requested by the first resolution, I yet entertain\r\nstrong apprehensions lest such a communication might delay and\r\nultimately endanger the success of the great measure which Congress so\r\nearnestly sought to accomplish by the passage of the \"joint resolution\r\nfor the annexation of Texas to the United States.\" The initiatory\r\nproceedings which have been adopted by the Executive to give effect to\r\nthis resolution can not, therefore, in my judgment, at this time and\r\nunder existing circumstances, be communicated without injury to the\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the second resolution, I herewith transmit to the\r\nSenate the copy of a note, dated on the 6th instant, addressed by\r\nGeneral Almonte, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the\r\nMexican Republic, to the Hon. John C. Calhoun, late Secretary of State,\r\nwhich is the only communication that has been made by the Mexican\r\nminister to the Department of State since the passage of the joint\r\nresolution of Congress for the annexation of Texas; and I also transmit\r\na copy of the answer of the Secretary of State to this note of the\r\nMexican minister.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _June 16, 1845_.\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson is no more. He departed this life on Sunday, the 8th\r\ninstant, full of days and full of honors. His country deplores his loss,\r\nand will ever cherish his memory. Whilst a nation mourns it is proper\r\nthat business should be suspended, at least for one day, in the\r\nExecutive Departments, as a tribute of respect to the illustrious dead.\r\n\r\nI accordingly direct that the Departments of State, the Treasury, War,\r\nthe Navy, the Post-Office, the office of the Attorney-General, and the\r\nExecutive Mansion be instantly put into mourning, and that they be\r\nclosed during the whole day to-morrow.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, NO. 27.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 16, 1845_.\r\n\r\nThe following general order of the President, received through the War\r\nDepartment, announces to the Army the death of the illustrious\r\nex-President, General Andrew Jackson:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 16, 1845_.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States with heartfelt sorrow announces to\r\nthe Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps the death of Andrew Jackson. On\r\nthe evening of Sunday, the 8th day of June, about 6 o'clock, he resigned\r\nhis spirit to his Heavenly Father. The nation, while it learns with\r\ngrief the death of its most illustrious citizen, finds solace in\r\ncontemplating his venerable character and services. The Valley of the\r\nMississippi beheld in him the bravest and wisest and most fortunate of\r\nits defenders; the country raised him to the highest trusts in military\r\nand in civil life with a confidence that never abated and an affection\r\nthat followed him in undiminished vigor to retirement, watched over his\r\nlatest hours, and pays its tribute at his grave. Wherever his lot was\r\ncast he appeared among those around him first in natural endowments and\r\nresources, not less than first in authority and station. The power of\r\nhis mind impressed itself on the policy of his country, and still lives,\r\nand will live forever in the memory of its people. Child of a forest\r\nregion and a settler of the wilderness, his was a genius which, as it\r\ncame to the guidance of affairs, instinctively attached itself to\r\ngeneral principles, and inspired by the truth which his own heart\r\nrevealed to him in singleness and simplicity, he found always a response\r\nin the breast of his countrymen. Crowned with glory in war, in his whole\r\ncareer as a statesman he showed himself the friend and lover of peace.\r\nWith an American heart, whose throbs were all for republican freedom and\r\nhis native land, he yet longed to promote the widest intercourse and\r\nmost intimate commerce between the many nations of mankind. He was the\r\nservant of humanity. Of a vehement will, he was patient in council,\r\ndeliberating long, hearing all things, yet in the moment of action\r\ndeciding with rapidity. Of a noble nature and incapable of disguise, his\r\nthoughts lay open to all around him and won their confidence by his\r\ningenuous frankness. His judgment was of that solidity that he ever\r\ntempered vigor with prudence. The flushings of anger could never cloud\r\nhis faculties, but rather kindled and lighted them up, quickening their\r\nenergy without disturbing their balance. In war his eye at a glance\r\ndiscerned his plans with unerring sagacity; in peace he proposed\r\nmeasures with an instinctive wisdom of which the inspirations were\r\nprophecy. In discipline stern, in a just resolution inflexible, he was\r\nfull of the gentlest affections, ever ready to solace the distressed and\r\nto relieve the needy, faithful to his friends, fervid for his country.\r\nIndifferent to other rewards, he aspired throughout life to an honorable\r\nfame, and so loved his fellow-men that he longed to dwell in their\r\naffectionate remembrance. Heaven gave him length of days and he filled\r\nthem with deeds of greatness. He was always happy--happy in his youth,\r\nwhich shared the achievement of our national independence; happy in his\r\nafter years, which beheld the Valley of the West cover itself with the\r\nglory of free and ever-increasing States; happy in his age, which saw\r\nthe people multiply from two to twenty millions and freedom and union\r\nmake their pathway from the Atlantic to the Pacific; thrice happy in\r\ndeath, for while he believed the liberties of his country imperishable\r\nand was cheered by visions of its constant advancement, he departed from\r\nthis life in a full hope of a blessed immortality through the merits and\r\natonement of the Redeemer.\r\n\r\nOfficers of the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps will wear crape on\r\nthe left arm and on their swords and the colors of the several regiments\r\nwill be put in mourning for the period of six months. At the naval\r\nstations and the public vessels in commission the flags will be worn at\r\nhalf-mast for one week, and on the day after this order is received\r\ntwenty-one minute guns will be fired, beginning at 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\nAt each military station the day after the reception of this order the\r\nnational flag will be displayed at half-staff from sunrise to sunset,\r\nthirteen guns will be fired at daybreak, half-hour guns during the day,\r\nand at the close of the day a general salute. The troops will be paraded\r\nat 10 o'clock and this order read to them, on which the labors of the\r\nday will cease.\r\n\r\nLet the virtues of the illustrious dead retain their influence, and when\r\nenergy and courage are called to trial emulate his example.\r\n\r\nGEORGE BANCROFT,\r\n  _Acting Secretary of War, and Secretary of the Navy_.\r\n\r\nBy order:\r\n  R. JONES,\r\n    _Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 2, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is to me a source of unaffected satisfaction to meet the\r\nrepresentatives of the States and the people in Congress assembled, as\r\nit will be to receive the aid of their combined wisdom in the\r\nadministration of public affairs. In performing for the first time the\r\nduty imposed on me by the Constitution of giving to you information of\r\nthe state of the Union and recommending to your consideration such\r\nmeasures as in my judgment are necessary and expedient, I am happy that\r\nI can congratulate you on the continued prosperity of our country. Under\r\nthe blessings of Divine Providence and the benign influence of our free\r\ninstitutions, it stands before the world a spectacle of national\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nWith our unexampled advancement in all the elements of national\r\ngreatness, the affection of the people is confirmed for the Union of the\r\nStates and for the doctrines of popular liberty which lie at the\r\nfoundation of our Government.\r\n\r\nIt becomes us in humility to make our devout acknowledgments to the\r\nSupreme Ruler of the Universe for the inestimable civil and religious\r\nblessings with which we are favored.\r\n\r\nIn calling the attention of Congress to our relations with foreign\r\npowers, I am gratified to be able to state that though with some of them\r\nthere have existed since your last session serious causes of irritation\r\nand misunderstanding, yet no actual hostilities have taken place.\r\nAdopting the maxim in the conduct of our foreign affairs \"to ask nothing\r\nthat is not right and submit to nothing that is wrong,\" it has been my\r\nanxious desire to preserve peace with all nations, but at the same time\r\nto be prepared to resist aggression and maintain all our just rights.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress \"for annexing Texas to\r\nthe United States,\" my predecessor, on the 3d day of March, 1845,\r\nelected to submit the first and second sections of that resolution to\r\nthe Republic of Texas as an overture on the part of the United States\r\nfor her admission as a State into our Union. This election I approved,\r\nand accordingly the chargé d'affaires of the United States in Texas,\r\nunder instructions of the 10th of March, 1845, presented these sections\r\nof the resolution for the acceptance of that Republic. The executive\r\ngovernment, the Congress, and the people of Texas in convention have\r\nsuccessively complied with all the terms and conditions of the joint\r\nresolution. A constitution for the government of the State of Texas,\r\nformed by a convention of deputies, is herewith laid before Congress. It\r\nis well known, also, that the people of Texas at the polls have accepted\r\nthe terms of annexation and ratified the constitution. I communicate to\r\nCongress the correspondence between the Secretary of State and our\r\nchargé d'affaires in Texas, and also the correspondence of the latter\r\nwith the authorities of Texas, together with the official documents\r\ntransmitted by him to his own Government. The terms of annexation which\r\nwere offered by the United States having been accepted by Texas, the\r\npublic faith of both parties is solemnly pledged to the compact of their\r\nunion. Nothing remains to consummate the event but the passage of an act\r\nby Congress to admit the State of Texas into the Union upon an equal\r\nfooting with the original States. Strong reasons exist why this should\r\nbe done at an early period of the session. It will be observed that by\r\nthe constitution of Texas the existing government is only continued\r\ntemporarily till Congress can act, and that the third Monday of the\r\npresent month is the day appointed for holding the first general\r\nelection. On that day a governor, a lieutenant-governor, and both\r\nbranches of the legislature will be chosen by the people. The President\r\nof Texas is required, immediately after the receipt of official\r\ninformation that the new State has been admitted into our Union by\r\nCongress, to convene the legislature, and upon its meeting the existing\r\ngovernment will be superseded and the State government organized.\r\nQuestions deeply interesting to Texas, in common with the other States,\r\nthe extension of our revenue laws and judicial system over her people\r\nand territory, as well as measures of a local character, will claim the\r\nearly attention of Congress, and therefore upon every principle of\r\nrepublican government she ought to be represented in that body without\r\nunnecessary delay. I can not too earnestly recommend prompt action on\r\nthis important subject. As soon as the act to admit Texas as a State\r\nshall be passed the union of the two Republics will be consummated by\r\ntheir own voluntary consent.\r\n\r\nThis accession to our territory has been a bloodless achievement. No arm\r\nof force has been raised to produce the result. The sword has had no\r\npart in the victory. We have not sought to extend our territorial\r\npossessions by conquest, or our republican institutions over a reluctant\r\npeople. It was the deliberate homage of each people to the great\r\nprinciple of our federative union. If we consider the extent of\r\nterritory involved in the annexation, its prospective influence on\r\nAmerica, the means by which it has been accomplished, springing purely\r\nfrom the choice of the people themselves to share the blessings of our\r\nunion, the history of the world may be challenged to furnish a parallel.\r\nThe jurisdiction of the United States, which at the formation of the\r\nFederal Constitution was bounded by the St. Marys on the Atlantic, has\r\npassed the capes of Florida and been peacefully extended to the Del\r\nNorte. In contemplating the grandeur of this event it is not to be\r\nforgotten that the result was achieved in despite of the diplomatic\r\ninterference of European monarchies. Even France, the country which had\r\nbeen our ancient ally, the country which has a common interest with us\r\nin maintaining the freedom of the seas, the country which, by the\r\ncession of Louisiana, first opened to us access to the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nthe country with which we have been every year drawing more and more\r\nclosely the bonds of successful commerce, most unexpectedly, and to our\r\nunfeigned regret, took part in an effort to prevent annexation and to\r\nimpose on Texas, as a condition of the recognition of her independence\r\nby Mexico, that she would never join herself to the United States. We\r\nmay rejoice that the tranquil and pervading influence of the American\r\nprinciple of self-government was sufficient to defeat the purposes of\r\nBritish and French interference, and that the almost unanimous voice of\r\nthe people of Texas has given to that interference a peaceful and\r\neffective rebuke. From this example European Governments may learn how\r\nvain diplomatic arts and intrigues must ever prove upon this continent\r\nagainst that system of self-government which seems natural to our soil,\r\nand which will ever resist foreign interference.\r\n\r\nToward Texas I do not doubt that a liberal and generous spirit will\r\nactuate Congress in all that concerns her interests and prosperity, and\r\nthat she will never have cause to regret that she has united her \"lone\r\nstar\" to our glorious constellation.\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that our relations with Mexico since your last\r\nsession have not been of the amicable character which it is our desire\r\nto cultivate with all foreign nations. On the 6th day of March last the\r\nMexican envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the United\r\nStates made a formal protest in the name of his Government against the\r\njoint resolution passed by Congress \"for the annexation of Texas to the\r\nUnited States,\" which he chose to regard as a violation of the rights of\r\nMexico, and in consequence of it he demanded his passports. He was\r\ninformed that the Government of the United States did not consider this\r\njoint resolution as a violation of any of the rights of Mexico, or that\r\nit afforded any just cause of offense to his Government; that the\r\nRepublic of Texas was an independent power, owing no allegiance to\r\nMexico and constituting no part of her territory or rightful sovereignty\r\nand jurisdiction. He was also assured that it was the sincere desire of\r\nthis Government to maintain with that of Mexico relations of peace and\r\ngood understanding. That functionary, however, notwithstanding these\r\nrepresentations and assurances, abruptly terminated his mission and\r\nshortly afterwards left the country. Our envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to Mexico was refused all official intercourse\r\nwith that Government, and, after remaining several months, by the\r\npermission of his own Government he returned to the United States. Thus,\r\nby the acts of Mexico, all diplomatic intercourse between the two\r\ncountries was suspended.\r\n\r\nSince that time Mexico has until recently occupied an attitude of\r\nhostility toward the United States--has been marshaling and organizing\r\narmies, issuing proclamations, and avowing the intention to make war on\r\nthe United States, either by an open declaration or by invading Texas.\r\nBoth the Congress and convention of the people of Texas invited this\r\nGovernment to send an army into that territory to protect and defend\r\nthem against the menaced attack. The moment the terms of annexation\r\noffered by the United States were accepted by Texas the latter became so\r\nfar a part of our own country as to make it our duty to afford such\r\nprotection and defense. I therefore deemed it proper, as a precautionary\r\nmeasure, to order a strong squadron to the coasts of Mexico and to\r\nconcentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of\r\nTexas. Our Army was ordered to take position in the country between the\r\nNueces and the Del Norte, and to repel any invasion of the Texan\r\nterritory which might be attempted by the Mexican forces. Our squadron\r\nin the Gulf was ordered to cooperate with the Army. But though our Army\r\nand Navy were placed in a position to defend our own and the rights of\r\nTexas, they were ordered to commit no act of hostility against Mexico\r\nunless she declared war or was herself the aggressor by striking the\r\nfirst blow. The result has been that Mexico has made no aggressive\r\nmovement, and our military and naval commanders have executed their\r\norders with such discretion that the peace of the two Republics has not\r\nbeen disturbed. Texas had declared her independence and maintained it by\r\nher arms for more than nine years. She has had an organized government\r\nin successful operation during that period. Her separate existence as an\r\nindependent state had been recognized by the United States and the\r\nprincipal powers of Europe. Treaties of commerce and navigation had been\r\nconcluded with her by different nations, and it had become manifest to\r\nthe whole world that any further attempt on the part of Mexico to\r\nconquer her or overthrow her Government would be vain. Even Mexico\r\nherself had become satisfied of this fact, and whilst the question of\r\nannexation was pending before the people of Texas during the past summer\r\nthe Government of Mexico, by a formal act, agreed to recognize the\r\nindependence of Texas on condition that she would not annex herself to\r\nany other power. The agreement to acknowledge the independence of Texas,\r\nwhether with or without this condition, is conclusive against Mexico.\r\nThe independence of Texas is a fact conceded by Mexico herself, and she\r\nhad no right or authority to prescribe restrictions as to the form of\r\ngovernment which Texas might afterwards choose to assume. But though\r\nMexico can not complain of the United States on account of the\r\nannexation of Texas, it is to be regretted that serious causes of\r\nmisunderstanding between the two countries continue to exist, growing\r\nout of unredressed injuries inflicted by the Mexican authorities and\r\npeople on the persons and property of citizens of the United States\r\nthrough a long series of years. Mexico has admitted these injuries, but\r\nhas neglected and refused to repair them. Such was the character of the\r\nwrongs and such the insults repeatedly offered to American citizens and\r\nthe American flag by Mexico, in palpable violation of the laws of\r\nnations and the treaty between the two countries of the 5th of April,\r\n1831, that they have been repeatedly brought to the notice of Congress\r\nby my predecessors. As early as the 6th of February, 1837, the President\r\nof the United States declared in a message to Congress that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  The length of time since some of the injuries have been committed, the\r\n  repeated and unavailing applications for redress, the wanton character\r\n  of some of the outrages upon the property and persons of our citizens,\r\n  upon the officers and flag of the United States, independent of recent\r\n  insults to this Government and people by the late extraordinary Mexican\r\n  minister, would justify in the eyes of all nations immediate war.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, recommend an immediate resort to this extreme\r\nmeasure, which, he declared, \"should not be used by just and generous\r\nnations, confiding in their strength for injuries committed, if it can\r\nbe honorably avoided,\" but, in a spirit of forbearance, proposed that\r\nanother demand be made on Mexico for that redress which had been so long\r\nand unjustly withheld. In these views committees of the two Houses of\r\nCongress, in reports made to their respective bodies, concurred. Since\r\nthese proceedings more than eight years have elapsed, during which, in\r\naddition to the wrongs then complained of, others of an aggravated\r\ncharacter have been committed on the persons and property of our\r\ncitizens. A special agent was sent to Mexico in the summer of 1838 with\r\nfull authority to make another and final demand for redress. The demand\r\nwas made; the Mexican Government promised to repair the wrongs of which\r\nwe complained, and after much delay a treaty of indemnity with that view\r\nwas concluded between the two powers on the 11th of April, 1839, and was\r\nduly ratified by both Governments. By this treaty a joint commission was\r\ncreated to adjudicate and decide on the claims of American citizens on\r\nthe Government of Mexico. The commission was organized at Washington on\r\nthe 25th day of August, 1840. Their time was limited to eighteen months,\r\nat the expiration of which they had adjudicated and decided claims\r\namounting to $2,026,139.68 in favor of citizens of the United States\r\nagainst the Mexican Government, leaving a large amount of claims\r\nundecided. Of the latter the American commissioners had decided in favor\r\nof our citizens claims amounting to $928,627.88, which were left unacted\r\non by the umpire authorized by the treaty. Still further claims,\r\namounting to between three and four millions of dollars, were submitted\r\nto the board too late to be considered, and were left undisposed of. The\r\nsum of $2,026,139.68, decided by the board, was a liquidated and\r\nascertained debt due by Mexico to the claimants, and there was no\r\njustifiable reason for delaying its payment according to the terms of\r\nthe treaty. It was not, however, paid. Mexico applied for further\r\nindulgence, and, in that spirit of liberality and forbearance which has\r\never marked the policy of the United States toward that Republic, the\r\nrequest was granted, and on the 30th of January, 1843, a new treaty was\r\nconcluded. By this treaty it was provided that the interest due on the\r\nawards in favor of claimants under the convention of the 11th of April,\r\n1839, should be paid on the 30th of April, 1843, and that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  The principal of the said awards and the interest accruing thereon\r\n  shall be paid in five years, in equal installments every three months,\r\n  the said term of five years to commence on the 30th day of April, 1843,\r\n  aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interest due on the 30th day of April, 1843, and the three first of\r\nthe twenty installments have been paid. Seventeen of these installments\r\nremain unpaid, seven of which are now due.\r\n\r\nThe claims which were left undecided by the joint commission, amounting\r\nto more than $3,000,000, together with other claims for spoliations on\r\nthe property of our citizens, were subsequently presented to the Mexican\r\nGovernment for payment, and were so far recognized that a treaty\r\nproviding for their examination and settlement by a joint commission was\r\nconcluded and signed at Mexico on the 20th day of November, 1843. This\r\ntreaty was ratified by the United States with certain amendments to\r\nwhich no just exception could have been taken, but it has not yet\r\nreceived the ratification of the Mexican Government. In the meantime our\r\ncitizens, who suffered great losses--and some of whom have been reduced\r\nfrom affluence to bankruptcy--are without remedy unless their rights be\r\nenforced by their Government. Such a continued and unprovoked series of\r\nwrongs could never have been tolerated by the United States had they\r\nbeen committed by one of the principal nations of Europe. Mexico was,\r\nhowever, a neighboring sister republic, which, following our example,\r\nhad achieved her independence, and for whose success and prosperity all\r\nour sympathies were early enlisted. The United States were the first to\r\nrecognize her independence and to receive her into the family of\r\nnations, and have ever been desirous of cultivating with her a good\r\nunderstanding. We have therefore borne the repeated wrongs she has\r\ncommitted with great patience, in the hope that a returning sense of\r\njustice would ultimately guide her councils and that we might, if\r\npossible, honorably avoid any hostile collision with her. Without the\r\nprevious authority of Congress the Executive possessed no power to adopt\r\nor enforce adequate remedies for the injuries we had suffered, or to do\r\nmore than to be prepared to repel the threatened aggression on the part\r\nof Mexico. After our Army and Navy had remained on the frontier and\r\ncoasts of Mexico for many weeks without any hostile movement on her\r\npart, though her menaces were continued, I deemed it important to put an\r\nend, if possible, to this state of things. With this view I caused steps\r\nto be taken in the month of September last to ascertain distinctly and\r\nin an authentic form what the designs of the Mexican Government\r\nwere--whether it was their intention to declare war, or invade Texas, or\r\nwhether they were disposed to adjust and settle in an amicable manner\r\nthe pending differences between the two countries. On the 9th of\r\nNovember an official answer was received that the Mexican Government\r\nconsented to renew the diplomatic relations which had been suspended in\r\nMarch last, and for that purpose were willing to accredit a minister\r\nfrom the United States. With a sincere desire to preserve peace and\r\nrestore relations of good understanding between the two Republics, I\r\nwaived all ceremony as to the manner of renewing diplomatic intercourse\r\nbetween them, and, assuming the initiative, on the 10th of November a\r\ndistinguished citizen of Louisiana was appointed envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to Mexico, clothed with full powers to adjust\r\nand definitively settle all pending differences between the two\r\ncountries, including those of boundary between Mexico and the State of\r\nTexas. The minister appointed has set out on his mission and is probably\r\nby this time near the Mexican capital. He has been instructed to bring\r\nthe negotiation with which he is charged to a conclusion at the earliest\r\npracticable period, which it is expected will be in time to enable me to\r\ncommunicate the result to Congress during the present session. Until\r\nthat result is known I forbear to recommend to Congress such ulterior\r\nmeasures of redress for the wrongs and injuries we have so long borne as\r\nit would have been proper to make had no such negotiation been\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nCongress appropriated at the last session the sum of $275,000 for the\r\npayment of the April and July installments of the Mexican indemnities\r\nfor the year 1844:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Provided it shall be ascertained to the satisfaction of the American\r\n  Government that said installments have been paid by the Mexican\r\n  Government to the agent appointed by the United States to receive the\r\n  same in such manner as to discharge all claim on the Mexican Government,\r\n  and said agent to be delinquent in remitting the money to the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unsettled state of our relations with Mexico has involved this\r\nsubject in much mystery. The first information in an authentic form from\r\nthe agent of the United States, appointed under the Administration of my\r\npredecessor, was received at the State Department on the 9th of November\r\nlast. This is contained in a letter, dated the 17th of October,\r\naddressed by him to one of our citizens then in Mexico with a view of\r\nhaving it communicated to that Department. From this it appears that the\r\nagent on the 20th of September, 1844, gave a receipt to the treasury of\r\nMexico for the amount of the April and July installments of the\r\nindemnity. In the same communication, however, he asserts that he had\r\nnot received a single dollar in cash, but that he holds such securities\r\nas warranted him at the time in giving the receipt, and entertains no\r\ndoubt but that he will eventually obtain the money. As these\r\ninstallments appear never to have been actually paid by the Government\r\nof Mexico to the agent, and as that Government has not, therefore, been\r\nreleased so as to discharge the claim, I do not feel myself warranted in\r\ndirecting payment to be made to the claimants out of the Treasury\r\nwithout further legislation. Their case is undoubtedly one of much\r\nhardship, and it remains for Congress to decide whether any, and what,\r\nrelief ought to be granted to them. Our minister to Mexico has been\r\ninstructed to ascertain the facts of the case from the Mexican\r\nGovernment in an authentic and official form and report the result with\r\nas little delay as possible.\r\n\r\nMy attention was early directed to the negotiation which on the 4th\r\nof March last I found pending at Washington between the United States\r\nand Great Britain on the subject of the Oregon Territory. Three several\r\nattempts had been previously made to settle the questions in dispute\r\nbetween the two countries by negotiation upon the principle of compromise,\r\nbut each had proved unsuccessful. These negotiations took place\r\nat London in the years 1818, 1824, and 1826--the two first under the\r\nAdministration of Mr. Monroe and the last under that of Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of 1818, having failed to accomplish its object,\r\nresulted in the convention of the 20th of October of that year. By the\r\nthird article of that convention it was--\r\n\r\n  Agreed that any country that may be claimed by either party on the\r\n  northwest coast of America westward of the Stony Mountains shall,\r\n  together with its harbors, bays, and creeks, and the navigation of all\r\n  rivers within the same, be free and open for the term of ten years from\r\n  the date of the signature of the present convention to the vessels,\r\n  citizens, and subjects of the two powers; it being well understood that\r\n  this agreement is not to be construed to the prejudice of any claim\r\n  which either of the two high contracting parties may have to any part of\r\n  the said country, nor shall it be taken to affect the claims of any\r\n  other power or state to any part of the said country, the only object of\r\n  the high contracting parties in that respect being to prevent disputes\r\n  and differences amongst themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of 1824 was productive of no result, and the convention\r\nof 1818 was left unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of 1826, having also failed to effect an adjustment by\r\ncompromise, resulted in the convention of August 6, 1827, by which it\r\nwas agreed to continue in force for an indefinite period the provisions\r\nof the third article of the convention of the 20th of October, 1818; and\r\nit was further provided that--\r\n\r\n  It shall be competent, however, to either of the contracting parties,\r\n  in case either should think fit, at any time after the 20th of October,\r\n  1828, on giving due notice of twelve months to the other contracting\r\n  party, to annul and abrogate this convention; and it shall in such case\r\n  be accordingly entirely annulled and abrogated after the expiration of\r\n  the said term of notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these attempts to adjust the controversy the parallel of the\r\nforty-ninth degree of north latitude had been offered by the United\r\nStates to Great Britain, and in those of 1818 and 1826, with a further\r\nconcession of the free navigation of the Columbia River south of that\r\nlatitude. The parallel of the forty-ninth degree from the Rocky\r\nMountains to its intersection with the northeasternmost branch of the\r\nColumbia, and thence down the channel of that river to the sea, had been\r\noffered by Great Britain, with an addition of a small detached territory\r\nnorth of the Columbia. Each of these propositions had been rejected by\r\nthe parties respectively. In October, 1843, the envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary of the United States in London was authorized\r\nto make a similar offer to those made in 1818 and 1826. Thus stood the\r\nquestion when the negotiation was shortly afterwards transferred to\r\nWashington, and on the 23d of August, 1844, was formally opened under\r\nthe direction of my immediate predecessor. Like all the previous\r\nnegotiations, it was based upon principles of \"compromise,\" and the\r\navowed purpose of the parties was \"to treat of the respective claims of\r\nthe two countries to the Oregon Territory with the view to establish a\r\npermanent boundary between them westward of the Rocky Mountains to the\r\nPacific Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 26th of August, 1844, the British plenipotentiary\r\noffered to divide the Oregon Territory by the forty-ninth parallel of\r\nnorth latitude from the Rocky Mountains to the point of its intersection\r\nwith the northeasternmost branch of the Columbia River, and thence down\r\nthat river to the sea, leaving the free navigation of the river to be\r\nenjoyed in common by both parties, the country south of this line to\r\nbelong to the United States and that north of it to Great Britain. At\r\nthe same time he proposed in addition to yield to the United States a\r\ndetached territory north of the Columbia extending along the Pacific and\r\nthe Straits of Fuca from Bulfinchs Harbor, inclusive, to Hoods Canal,\r\nand to make free to the United States any port or ports south of\r\nlatitude 49° which they might desire, either on the mainland or on\r\nQuadra and Vancouvers Island. With the exception of the free ports, this\r\nwas the same offer which had been made by the British and rejected by\r\nthe American Government in the negotiation of 1826. This proposition was\r\nproperly rejected by the American plenipotentiary on the day it was\r\nsubmitted. This was the only proposition of compromise offered by the\r\nBritish plenipotentiary. The proposition on the part of Great Britain\r\nhaving been rejected, the British plenipotentiary requested that a\r\nproposal should be made by the United States for \"an equitable\r\nadjustment of the question.\" When I came into office I found this to be\r\nthe state of the negotiation. Though entertaining the settled conviction\r\nthat the British pretensions of title could not be maintained to any\r\nportion of the Oregon Territory upon any principle of public law\r\nrecognized by nations, yet in deference to what had been done by my\r\npredecessors, and especially in consideration that propositions of\r\ncompromise had been thrice made by two preceding Administrations to\r\nadjust the question on the parallel of 49°, and in two of them yielding\r\nto Great Britain the free navigation of the Columbia, and that the\r\npending negotiation had been commenced on the basis of compromise, I\r\ndeemed it to be my duty not abruptly to break it off. In consideration,\r\ntoo, that under the conventions of 1818 and 1827 the citizens and\r\nsubjects of the two powers held a joint occupancy of the country, I was\r\ninduced to make another effort to settle this long-pending controversy\r\nin the spirit of moderation which had given birth to the renewed\r\ndiscussion. A proposition was accordingly made, which was rejected by\r\nthe British plenipotentiary, who, without submitting any other\r\nproposition, suffered the negotiation on his part to drop, expressing\r\nhis trust that the United States would offer what he saw fit to call\r\n\"some further proposal for the settlement of the Oregon question more\r\nconsistent with fairness and equity and with the reasonable expectations\r\nof the British Government.\" The proposition thus offered and rejected\r\nrepeated the offer of the parallel of 49° of north latitude, which had\r\nbeen made by two preceding Administrations, but without proposing to\r\nsurrender to Great Britain, as they had done, the free navigation of the\r\nColumbia River. The right of any foreign power to the free navigation of\r\nany of our rivers through the heart of our country was which I was\r\nunwilling to concede. I also embraced a provision to make free to Great\r\nBritain any port or ports on the cap of Quadra and Vancouvers Island\r\nsouth of this parallel. Had this been a new question, coming under\r\ndiscussion for the first time, this proposition would not have been\r\nmade. The extraordinary and wholly inadmissible demands of the British\r\nGovernment and the rejection of the proposition made in deference alone\r\nto what had been done by my predecessors and the implied obligation\r\nwhich their acts seemed to impose afford satisfactory evidence that no\r\ncompromise which the United States ought to accept can be effected. With\r\nthis conviction the proposition of compromise which had been made and\r\nrejected was by my direction subsequently withdrawn and our title to the\r\nwhole Oregon Territory asserted, and, as is believed, maintained by\r\nirrefragable facts and arguments.\r\n\r\nThe civilized world will see in these proceedings a spirit of liberal\r\nconcession on the part of the United States, and this Government will be\r\nrelieved from all responsibility which may follow the failure to settle\r\nthe controversy.\r\n\r\nAll attempts at compromise having failed, it becomes the duty of\r\nCongress to consider what measures it may be proper to adopt for the\r\nsecurity and protection of our citizens now inhabiting or who may\r\nhereafter inhabit Oregon, and for the maintenance of our just title to\r\nthat Territory. In adopting measures for this purpose care should be\r\ntaken that nothing be done to violate the stipulations of the convention\r\nof 1827, which is still in force. The faith of treaties, in their letter\r\nand spirit, has ever been, and, I trust, will ever be, scrupulously\r\nobserved by the United States. Under that convention a year's notice is\r\nrequired to be given by either party to the other before the joint\r\noccupancy shall terminate and before either can rightfully assert or\r\nexercise exclusive jurisdiction over any portion of the territory. This\r\nnotice it would, in my judgment, be proper to give, and I recommend that\r\nprovision be made by law for giving it accordingly, and terminating in\r\nthis manner the convention of the 6th of August, 1827.\r\n\r\nIt will become proper for Congress to determine what legislation they\r\ncan in the meantime adopt without violating this convention. Beyond all\r\nquestion the protection of our laws and our jurisdiction, civil and\r\ncriminal, ought to be immediately extended over our citizens in Oregon.\r\nThey have had just cause to complain of our long neglect in this\r\nparticular, and have in consequence been compelled for their own\r\nsecurity and protection to establish a provisional government for\r\nthemselves. Strong in their allegiance and ardent in their attachment to\r\nthe United States, they have been thus cast upon their own resources.\r\nThey are anxious that our laws should be extended over them, and I\r\nrecommend that this be done by Congress with as little delay as possible\r\nin the full extent to which the British Parliament have proceeded in\r\nregard to British subjects in that Territory by their act of July 2,\r\n1821, \"for regulating the fur trade and establishing a criminal and\r\ncivil jurisdiction within certain parts of North America.\" By this act\r\nGreat Britain extended her laws and jurisdiction, civil and criminal,\r\nover her subjects engaged in the fur trade in that Territory. By it the\r\ncourts of the Province of Upper Canada were empowered to take cognizance\r\nof causes civil and criminal. Justices of the peace and other judicial\r\nofficers were authorized to be appointed in Oregon with power to execute\r\nall process issuing from the courts of that Province, and to \"sit and\r\nhold courts of record for the trial of criminal offenses and\r\nmisdemeanors\" not made the subject of capital punishment, and also of\r\ncivil cases where the cause of action shall not \"exceed in value the\r\namount or sum of £200.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the date of this act of Parliament a grant was made from\r\nthe \"British Crown\" to the Hudsons Bay Company of the exclusive trade\r\nwith the Indian tribes in the Oregon Territory, subject to a reservation\r\nthat it shall not operate to the exclusion \"of the subjects of any\r\nforeign states who, under or by force of any convention for the time\r\nbeing between us and such foreign states, respectively, may be entitled\r\nto and shall be engaged in the said trade.\" It is much to be regretted\r\nthat while under this act British subjects have enjoyed the protection\r\nof British laws and British judicial tribunals throughout the whole of\r\nOregon, American citizens in the same Territory have enjoyed no such\r\nprotection from their Government. At the same time, the result\r\nillustrates the character of our people and their institutions. In spite\r\nof this neglect they have multiplied, and their number is rapidly\r\nincreasing in that Territory. They have made no appeal to arms, but have\r\npeacefully fortified themselves in their new homes by the adoption of\r\nrepublican institutions for themselves, furnishing another example of\r\nthe truth that self-government is inherent in the American breast and\r\nmust prevail. It is due to them that they should be embraced and\r\nprotected by our laws. It is deemed important that our laws regulating\r\ntrade and intercourse with the Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains\r\nshould be extended to such tribes as dwell beyond them. The increasing\r\nemigration to Oregon and the care and protection which is due from the\r\nGovernment to its citizens in that distant region make it our duty, as\r\nit is our interest, to cultivate amicable relations with the Indian\r\ntribes of that Territory. For this purpose I recommend that provision be\r\nmade for establishing an Indian agency and such subagencies as may be\r\ndeemed necessary beyond the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nFor the protection of emigrants whilst on their way to Oregon against\r\nthe attacks of the Indian tribes occupying the country through which\r\nthey pass, I recommend that a suitable number of stockades and\r\nblockhouse forts be erected along the usual route between our frontier\r\nsettlements on the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, and that an\r\nadequate force of mounted riflemen be raised to guard and protect them\r\non their journey. The immediate adoption of these recommendations by\r\nCongress will not violate the provisions of the existing treaty. It will\r\nbe doing nothing more for American citizens than British laws have long\r\nsince done for British subjects in the same territory.\r\n\r\nIt requires several months to perform the voyage by sea from the\r\nAtlantic States to Oregon, and although we have a large number of whale\r\nships in the Pacific, but few of them afford an opportunity of\r\ninterchanging intelligence without great delay between our settlements\r\nin that distant region and the United States. An overland mail is\r\nbelieved to be entirely practicable, and the importance of establishing\r\nsuch a mail at least once a month is submitted to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted to the wisdom of Congress to determine whether at their\r\npresent session, and until after the expiration of the year's notice,\r\nany other measures may be adopted consistently with the convention of\r\n1827 for the security of our rights and the government and protection of\r\nour citizens in Oregon. That it will ultimately be wise and proper to\r\nmake liberal grants of land to the patriotic pioneers who amidst\r\nprivations and dangers lead the way through savage tribes inhabiting the\r\nvast wilderness intervening between our frontier settlements and Oregon,\r\nand who cultivate and are ever ready to defend the soil, I am fully\r\nsatisfied. To doubt whether they will obtain such grants as soon as the\r\nconvention between the United States and Great Britain shall have ceased\r\nto exist would be to doubt the justice of Congress; but, pending the\r\nyear's notice, it is worthy of consideration whether a stipulation to\r\nthis effect may be made consistently with the spirit of that convention.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations which I have made as to the best manner of securing\r\nour rights in Oregon are submitted to Congress with great deference.\r\nShould they in their wisdom devise any other mode better calculated to\r\naccomplish the same object, it shall meet with my hearty concurrence.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year's notice, should Congress think it proper to make\r\nprovision for giving that notice, we shall have reached a period when\r\nthe national rights in Oregon must either be abandoned or firmly\r\nmaintained. That they can not be abandoned without a sacrifice of both\r\nnational honor and interest is too clear to admit of doubt.\r\n\r\nOregon is a part of the North American continent, to which, it is\r\nconfidently affirmed, the title of the United States is the best now in\r\nexistence. For the grounds on which that title rests I refer you to the\r\ncorrespondence of the late and present Secretary of State with the\r\nBritish plenipotentiary during the negotiation. The British proposition\r\nof compromise, which would make the Columbia the line south of 49°, with\r\na trifling addition of detached territory to the United States north of\r\nthat river, and would leave on the British side two-thirds of the whole\r\nOregon Territory, including the free navigation of the Columbia and all\r\nthe valuable harbors on the Pacific, can never for a moment be\r\nentertained by the United States without an abandonment of their just\r\nand clear territorial rights, their own self-respect, and the national\r\nhonor. For the information of Congress, I communicate herewith the\r\ncorrespondence which took place between the two Governments during the\r\nlate negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe rapid extension of our settlements over our territories heretofore\r\nunoccupied, the addition of new States to our Confederacy, the expansion\r\nof free principles, and our rising greatness as a nation are attracting\r\nthe attention of the powers of Europe, and lately the doctrine has been\r\nbroached in some of them of a \"balance of power\" on this continent to\r\ncheck our advancement. The United States, sincerely desirous of\r\npreserving relations of good understanding with all nations, can not in\r\nsilence permit any European interference on the North American\r\ncontinent, and should any such interference be attempted will be ready\r\nto resist it at any and all hazards.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to the American people and to all nations that this\r\nGovernment has never interfered with the relations subsisting between\r\nother governments. We have never made ourselves parties to their wars or\r\ntheir alliances; we have not sought their territories by conquest; we\r\nhave not mingled with parties in their domestic struggles; and believing\r\nour own form of government to be the best, we have never attempted to\r\npropagate it by intrigues, by diplomacy, or by force. We may claim on\r\nthis continent a like exemption from European interference. The nations\r\nof America are equally sovereign and independent with those of Europe.\r\nThey possess the same rights, independent of all foreign interposition,\r\nto make war, to conclude peace, and to regulate their internal affairs.\r\nThe people of the United States can not, therefore, view with\r\nindifference attempts of European powers to interfere with the\r\nindependent action of the nations on this continent. The American system\r\nof government is entirely different from that of Europe. Jealousy among\r\nthe different sovereigns of Europe, lest any one of them might become\r\ntoo powerful for the rest, has caused them anxiously to desire the\r\nestablishment of what they term the \"balance of power.\" It can not be\r\npermitted to have any application on the North American continent, and\r\nespecially to the United States. We must ever maintain the principle\r\nthat the people of this continent alone have the right to decide their\r\nown destiny. Should any portion of them, constituting an independent\r\nstate, propose to unite themselves with our Confederacy, this will be a\r\nquestion for them and us to determine without any foreign interposition.\r\nWe can never consent that European powers shall interfere to prevent\r\nsuch a union because it might disturb the \"balance of power\" which they\r\nmay desire to maintain upon this continent. Near a quarter of a century\r\nago the principle was distinctly announced to the world, in the annual\r\nmessage of one of my predecessors, that--\r\n\r\n  The American continents, by the free and independent condition which\r\n  they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered\r\n  as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis principle will apply with greatly increased force should any\r\nEuropean power attempt to establish any new colony in North America. In\r\nthe existing circumstances of the world the present is deemed a proper\r\noccasion to reiterate and reaffirm the principle avowed by Mr. Monroe\r\nand to state my cordial concurrence in its wisdom and sound policy. The\r\nreassertion of this principle, especially in reference to North America,\r\nis at this day but the promulgation of a policy which no European power\r\nshould cherish the disposition to resist. Existing rights of every\r\nEuropean nation should be respected, but it is due alike to our safety\r\nand our interests that the efficient protection of our laws should be\r\nextended over our whole territorial limits, and that it should be\r\ndistinctly announced to the world as our settled policy that no future\r\nEuropean colony or dominion shall with our consent be planted or\r\nestablished on any part of the North American continent.\r\n\r\nA question has recently arisen under the tenth article of the subsisting\r\ntreaty between the United States and Prussia. By this article the\r\nconsuls of the two countries have the right to sit as judges and\r\narbitrators \"in such differences as may arise between the captains and\r\ncrews of the vessels belonging to the nation whose interests are\r\ncommitted to their charge without the interference of the local\r\nauthorities, unless the conduct of the crews or of the captain should\r\ndisturb the order or tranquillity of the country, or the said consuls\r\nshould require their assistance to cause their decisions to be carried\r\ninto effect or supported.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prussian consul at New Bedford in June, 1844, applied to Mr. Justice\r\nStory to carry into effect a decision made by him between the captain\r\nand crew of the Prussian ship _Borussia_, but the request was refused on\r\nthe ground that without previous legislation by Congress the judiciary\r\ndid not possess the power to give effect to this article of the treaty.\r\nThe Prussian Government, through their minister here, have complained of\r\nthis violation of the treaty, and have asked the Government of the\r\nUnited States to adopt the necessary measures to prevent similar\r\nviolations hereafter. Good faith to Prussia, as well as to other nations\r\nwith whom we have similar treaty stipulations, requires that these\r\nshould be faithfully observed. I have deemed it proper, therefore, to\r\nlay the subject before Congress and to recommend such legislation as may\r\nbe necessary to give effect to these treaty obligations.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of an arrangement made between the Spanish Government and that\r\nof the United States in December, 1831, American vessels, since the 20th\r\nof April, 1832, have been admitted to entry in the ports of Spain,\r\nincluding those of the Balearic and Canary islands, on payment of the\r\nsame tonnage duty of 5 cents per ton, as though they had been Spanish\r\nvessels; and this whether our vessels arrive in Spain directly from the\r\nUnited States or indirectly from any other country. When Congress, by\r\nthe act of 13th July, 1832, gave effect to this arrangement between the\r\ntwo Governments, they confined the reduction of tonnage duty merely to\r\nSpanish vessels \"coming from a port in Spain,\" leaving the former\r\ndiscriminating duty to remain against such vessels coming from a port in\r\nany other country. It is manifestly unjust that whilst American vessels\r\narriving in the ports of Spain from other countries pay no more duty\r\nthan Spanish vessels, Spanish vessels arriving in the ports of the\r\nUnited States from other countries should be subjected to heavy\r\ndiscriminating tonnage duties. This is neither equality nor reciprocity,\r\nand is in violation of the arrangement concluded in December, 1831,\r\nbetween the two countries. The Spanish Government have made repeated and\r\nearnest remonstrances against this inequality, and the favorable\r\nattention of Congress has been several times invoked to the subject by\r\nmy predecessors. I recommend, as an act of justice to Spain, that this\r\ninequality be removed by Congress and that the discriminating duties\r\nwhich have been levied under the act of the 13th of July, 1832, on\r\nSpanish vessels coming to the United States from any other foreign\r\ncountry be refunded. This recommendation does not embrace Spanish\r\nvessels arriving in the United States from Cuba and Porto Rico, which\r\nwill still remain subject to the provisions of the act of June 30, 1834,\r\nconcerning tonnage duty on such vessels. By the act of the 14th of July,\r\n1832, coffee was exempted from duty altogether. This exemption was\r\nuniversal, without reference to the country where it was produced or the\r\nnational character of the vessel in which it was imported. By the tariff\r\nact of the 30th of August, 1842, this exemption from duty was restricted\r\nto coffee imported in American vessels from the place of its production,\r\nwhilst coffee imported under all other circumstances was subjected to a\r\nduty of 20 per cent _ad valorem_. Under this act and our existing treaty\r\nwith the King of the Netherlands Java coffee imported from the European\r\nports of that Kingdom into the United States, whether in Dutch or\r\nAmerican vessels, now pays this rate of duty. The Government of the\r\nNetherlands complains that such a discriminating duty should have been\r\nimposed on coffee the production of one of its colonies, and which is\r\nchiefly brought from Java to the ports of that Kingdom and exported from\r\nthence to foreign countries. Our trade with the Netherlands is highly\r\nbeneficial to both countries and our relations with them have ever been\r\nof the most friendly character. Under all the circumstances of the case,\r\nI recommend that this discrimination should be abolished and that the\r\ncoffee of Java imported from the Netherlands be placed upon the same\r\nfooting with that imported directly from Brazil and other countries\r\nwhere it is produced.\r\n\r\nUnder the eighth section of the tariff act of the 30th of August, 1842,\r\na duty of 15 cents per gallon was imposed on port wine in casks, while\r\non the red wines of several other countries, when imported in casks, a\r\nduty of only 6 cents per gallon was imposed. This discrimination, so far\r\nas regarded the port wine of Portugal, was deemed a violation of our\r\ntreaty with that power, which provides that--\r\n\r\n  No higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into\r\n  the United States of America of any article the growth, produce, or\r\n  manufacture of the Kingdom and possessions of Portugal than such as\r\n  are or shall be payable on the like article being the growth, produce,\r\n  or manufacture of any other foreign country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, to give effect to the treaty as well as to the intention of\r\nCongress, expressed in a proviso to the tariff act itself, that nothing\r\ntherein contained should be so construed as to interfere with subsisting\r\ntreaties with foreign nations, a Treasury circular was issued on the\r\n16th of July, 1844, which, among other things, declared the duty on the\r\nport wine of Portugal, in casks, under the existing laws and treaty to\r\nbe 6 cents per gallon, and directed that the excess of duties which had\r\nbeen collected on such wine should be refunded. By virtue of another\r\nclause in the same section of the act it is provided that all imitations\r\nof port or any other wines \"shall be subject to the duty provided for\r\nthe genuine article.\" Imitations of port wine, the production of France,\r\nare imported to some extent into the United States, and the Government\r\nof that country now claims that under a correct construction of the act\r\nthese imitations ought not to pay a higher duty than that imposed upon\r\nthe original port wine of Portugal. It appears to me to be unequal and\r\nunjust that French imitations of port wine should be subjected to a duty\r\nof 15 cents, while the more valuable article from Portugal should pay a\r\nduty of 6 cents only per gallon. I therefore recommend to Congress such\r\nlegislation as may be necessary to correct the inequality.\r\n\r\nThe late President, in his annual message of December last, recommended\r\nan appropriation to satisfy the claims of the Texan Government against\r\nthe United States, which had been previously adjusted so far as the\r\npowers of the Executive extend. These claims arose out of the act of\r\ndisarming a body of Texan troops under the command of Major Snively by\r\nan officer in the service of the United States, acting under the orders\r\nof our Government, and the forcible entry into the custom-house at\r\nBryarlys Landing, on Red River, by certain citizens of the United States\r\nand taking away therefrom the goods seized by the collector of the\r\ncustoms as forfeited under the laws of Texas. This was a liquidated debt\r\nascertained to be due to Texas when an independent state. Her acceptance\r\nof the terms of annexation proposed by the United States does not\r\ndischarge or invalidate the claim. I recommend that provision be made\r\nfor its payment.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner appointed to China during the special session of the\r\nSenate in March last shortly afterwards set out on his mission in the\r\nUnited States ship _Columbus_. On arriving at Rio de Janeiro on his\r\npassage the state of his health had become so critical that by the\r\nadvice of his medical attendants he returned to the United States early\r\nin the month of October last. Commodore Biddle, commanding the East\r\nIndia Squadron, proceeded on his voyage in the _Columbus_, and was\r\ncharged by the commissioner with the duty of exchanging with the proper\r\nauthorities the ratifications of the treaty lately concluded with the\r\nEmperor of China. Since the return of the commissioner to the United\r\nStates his health has been much improved, and he entertains the\r\nconfident belief that he will soon be able to proceed on his mission.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, differences continue to exist among some of the nations\r\nof South America which, following our example, have established their\r\nindependence, while in others internal dissensions prevail. It is\r\nnatural that our sympathies should be warmly enlisted for their welfare;\r\nthat we should desire that all controversies between them should be\r\namicably adjusted and their Governments administered in a manner to\r\nprotect the rights and promote the prosperity of their people. It is\r\ncontrary, however, to our settled policy to interfere in their\r\ncontroversies, whether external or internal.\r\n\r\nI have thus adverted to all the subjects connected with our foreign\r\nrelations to which I deem it necessary to call your attention. Our\r\npolicy is not only peace with all, but good will toward all the powers\r\nof the earth. While we are just to all, we require that all shall be\r\njust to us. Excepting the differences with Mexico and Great Britain, our\r\nrelations with all civilized nations are of the most satisfactory\r\ncharacter. It is hoped that in this enlightened age these differences\r\nmay be amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report to Congress will\r\ncommunicate a full statement of the condition of our finances. The\r\nimports for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were of the\r\nvalue of $117,254,564, of which the amount exported was $15,346,830,\r\nleaving a balance of $101,907,734 for domestic consumption. The exports\r\nfor the same year were of the value of $114,646,606, of which the amount\r\nof domestic articles was $99,299,776. The receipts into the Treasury\r\nduring the same year were $29,769,133.56, of which there were derived\r\nfrom customs $27,528,112.70, from sales of public lands $2,077,022.30,\r\nand from incidental and miscellaneous sources $163,998.56. The\r\nexpenditures for the same period were $29,968,206.98, of which\r\n$8,588,157.62 were applied to the payment of the public debt. The\r\nbalance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last was $7,658,306.22. The\r\namount of the public debt remaining unpaid on the 1st of October last\r\nwas $17,075,445.52. Further payments of the public debt would have been\r\nmade, in anticipation of the period of its reimbursement under the\r\nauthority conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury by the acts of\r\nJuly 21, 1841, and of April 15, 1842, and March 3, 1843, had not the\r\nunsettled state of our relations with Mexico menaced hostile collision\r\nwith that power. In view of such a contingency it was deemed prudent to\r\nretain in the Treasury an amount unusually large for ordinary purposes.\r\n\r\nA few years ago our whole national debt growing out of the Revolution\r\nand the War of 1812 with Great Britain was extinguished, and we\r\npresented to the world the rare and noble spectacle of a great and\r\ngrowing people who had fully discharged every obligation. Since that\r\ntime the existing debt has been contracted, and, small as it is in\r\ncomparison with the similar burdens of most other nations, it should be\r\nextinguished at the earliest practicable period. Should the state of the\r\ncountry permit, and especially if our foreign relations interpose no\r\nobstacle, it is contemplated to apply all the moneys in the Treasury as\r\nthey accrue, beyond what is required for the appropriations by Congress,\r\nto its liquidation. I cherish the hope of soon being able to\r\ncongratulate the country on its recovering once more the lofty position\r\nwhich it so recently occupied. Our country, which exhibits to the world\r\nthe benefits of self-government, in developing all the sources of\r\nnational prosperity owes to mankind the permanent example of a nation\r\nfree from the blighting influence of a public debt.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is invited to the importance of making\r\nsuitable modifications and reductions of the rates of duty imposed by\r\nour present tariff laws. The object of imposing duties on imports should\r\nbe to raise revenue to pay the necessary expenses of Government.\r\nCongress may undoubtedly, in the exercise of a sound discretion,\r\ndiscriminate in arranging the rates of duty on different articles, but\r\nthe discriminations should be within the revenue standard and be made\r\nwith the view to raise money for the support of Government.\r\n\r\nIt becomes important to understand distinctly what is meant by a revenue\r\nstandard the maximum of which should not be exceeded in the rates of\r\nduty imposed. It is conceded, and experience proves, that duties may be\r\nlaid so high as to diminish or prohibit altogether the importation of\r\nany given article, and thereby lessen or destroy the revenue which at\r\nlower rates would be derived from its importation. Such duties exceed\r\nthe revenue rates and are not imposed to raise money for the support of\r\nGovernment. If Congress levy a duty for revenue of 1 per cent on a given\r\narticle, it will produce a given amount of money to the Treasury and\r\nwill incidentally and necessarily afford protection or advantage to the\r\namount of 1 per cent to the home manufacturer of a similar or like\r\narticle over the importer. If the duty be raised to 10 per cent, it will\r\nproduce a greater amount of money and afford greater protection. If it\r\nbe still raised to 20, 25, or 30 per cent, and if as it is raised the\r\nrevenue derived from it is found to be increased, the protection or\r\nadvantage will also be increased; but if it be raised to 31 per cent,\r\nand it is found that the revenue produced at that rate is less than at\r\n30 per cent, it ceases to be a revenue duty. The precise point in the\r\nascending scale of duties at which it is ascertained from experience\r\nthat the revenue is greatest is the maximum rate of duty which can be\r\nlaid for the _bona fide_ purpose of collecting money for the support of\r\nGovernment. To raise the duties higher than that point, and thereby\r\ndiminish the amount collected, is to levy them for protection merely,\r\nand not for revenue. As long, then, as Congress may gradually increase\r\nthe rate of duty on a given article, and the revenue is increased by\r\nsuch increase of duty, they are within the revenue standard. When they\r\ngo beyond that point, and as they increase the duties, the revenue is\r\ndiminished or destroyed; the act ceases to have for its object the\r\nraising of money to support Government, but is for protection merely. It\r\ndoes not follow that Congress should levy the highest duty on all\r\narticles of import which they will bear within the revenue standard, for\r\nsuch rates would probably produce a much larger amount than the\r\neconomical administration of the Government would require. Nor does it\r\nfollow that the duties on all articles should be at the same or a\r\nhorizontal rate. Some articles will bear a much higher revenue duty than\r\nothers. Below the maximum of the revenue standard Congress may and ought\r\nto discriminate in the rates imposed, taking care so to adjust them on\r\ndifferent articles as to produce in the aggregate the amount which, when\r\nadded to the proceeds of the sales of public lands, may be needed to pay\r\nthe economical expenses of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn levying a tariff of duties Congress exercise the taxing power, and\r\nfor purposes of revenue may select the objects of taxation. They may\r\nexempt certain articles altogether and permit their importation free of\r\nduty. On others they may impose low duties. In these classes should be\r\nembraced such articles of necessity as are in general use, and\r\nespecially such as are consumed by the laborer and poor as well as by\r\nthe wealthy citizen. Care should be taken that all the great interests\r\nof the country, including manufactures, agriculture, commerce,\r\nnavigation, and the mechanic arts, should, as far as may be practicable,\r\nderive equal advantages from the incidental protection which a just\r\nsystem of revenue duties may afford. Taxation, direct or indirect, is a\r\nburden, and it should be so imposed as to operate as equally as may be\r\non all classes in the proportion of their ability to bear it. To make\r\nthe taxing power an actual benefit to one class necessarily increases\r\nthe burden of the others beyond their proportion, and would be\r\nmanifestly unjust. The terms \"protection to domestic industry\" are of\r\npopular import, but they should apply under a just system to all the\r\nvarious branches of industry in our country. The farmer or planter who\r\ntoils yearly in his fields is engaged in \"domestic industry,\" and is as\r\nmuch entitled to have his labor \"protected\" as the manufacturer, the man\r\nof commerce, the navigator, or the mechanic, who are engaged also in\r\n\"domestic industry\" in their different pursuits. The joint labors of all\r\nthese classes constitute the aggregate of the \"domestic industry\" of the\r\nnation, and they are equally entitled to the nation's \"protection.\" No\r\none of them can justly claim to be the exclusive recipient of\r\n\"protection,\" which can only be afforded by increasing burdens on the\r\n\"domestic industry\" of the others.\r\n\r\nIf these views be correct, it remains to inquire how far the tariff act\r\nof 1842 is consistent with them. That many of the provisions of that act\r\nare in violation of the cardinal principles here laid down all must\r\nconcede. The rates of duty imposed by it on some articles are\r\nprohibitory and on others so high as greatly to diminish importations\r\nand to produce a less amount of revenue than would be derived from lower\r\nrates. They operate as \"protection merely\" to one branch of \"domestic\r\nindustry\" by taxing other branches.\r\n\r\nBy the introduction of minimums, or assumed and false values, and by the\r\nimposition of specific duties the injustice and inequality of the act of\r\n1842 in its practical operations on different classes and pursuits are\r\nseen and felt. Many of the oppressive duties imposed by it under the\r\noperation of these principles range from 1 per cent to more than 200 per\r\ncent. They are prohibitory on some articles and partially so on others,\r\nand bear most heavily on articles of common necessity and but lightly on\r\narticles of luxury. It is so framed that much the greatest burden which\r\nit imposes is thrown on labor and the poorer classes, who are least able\r\nto bear it, while it protects capital and exempts the rich from paying\r\ntheir just proportion of the taxation required for the support of\r\nGovernment. While it protects the capital of the wealthy manufacturer\r\nand increases his profits, it does not benefit the operatives or\r\nlaborers in his employment, whose wages have not been increased by it.\r\nArticles of prime necessity or of coarse quality and low price, used by\r\nthe masses of the people, are in many instances subjected by it to heavy\r\ntaxes, while articles of finer quality and higher price, or of luxury,\r\nwhich can be used only by the opulent, are lightly taxed. It imposes\r\nheavy and unjust burdens on the farmer, the planter, the commercial man,\r\nand those of all other pursuits except the capitalist who has made his\r\ninvestments in manufactures. All the great interests of the country are\r\nnot as nearly as may be practicable equally protected by it.\r\n\r\nThe Government in theory knows no distinction of persons or classes, and\r\nshould not bestow upon some favors and privileges which all others may\r\nnot enjoy. It was the purpose of its illustrious founders to base the\r\ninstitutions which they reared upon the great and unchanging principles\r\nof justice and equity, conscious that if administered in the spirit in\r\nwhich they were conceived they would be felt only by the benefits which\r\nthey diffused, and would secure for themselves a defense in the hearts\r\nof the people more powerful than standing armies and all the means and\r\nappliances invented to sustain governments founded in injustice and\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nThe well-known fact that the tariff act of 1842 was passed by a majority\r\nof one vote in the Senate and two in the House of Representatives, and\r\nthat some of those who felt themselves constrained, under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances existing at the time, to vote in its favor, proclaimed its\r\ndefects and expressed their determination to aid in its modification on\r\nthe first opportunity, affords strong and conclusive evidence that it\r\nwas not intended to be permanent, and of the expediency and necessity of\r\nits thorough revision.\r\n\r\nIn recommending to Congress a reduction of the present rates of duty and\r\na revision and modification of the act of 1842, I am far from\r\nentertaining opinions unfriendly to the manufacturers. On the contrary,\r\nI desire to see them prosperous as far as they can be so without\r\nimposing unequal burdens on other interests. The advantage under any\r\nsystem of indirect taxation, even within the revenue standard, must be\r\nin favor of the manufacturing interest, and of this no other interest\r\nwill complain.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress the abolition of the minimum principle, or\r\nassumed, arbitrary, and false values, and of specific duties, and the\r\nsubstitution in their place of _ad valorem_ duties as the fairest and\r\nmost equitable indirect tax which can be imposed. By the _ad valorem_\r\nprinciple all articles are taxed according to their cost or value, and\r\nthose which are of inferior quality or of small cost bear only the just\r\nproportion of the tax with those which are of superior quality or\r\ngreater cost. The articles consumed by all are taxed at the same rate. A\r\nsystem of _ad valorem_ revenue duties, with proper discriminations and\r\nproper guards against frauds in collecting them, it is not doubted will\r\nafford ample incidental advantages to the manufacturers and enable them\r\nto derive as great profits as can be derived from any other regular\r\nbusiness. It is believed that such a system strictly within the revenue\r\nstandard will place the manufacturing interests on a stable footing and\r\ninure to their permanent advantage, while it will as nearly as may be\r\npracticable extend to all the great interests of the country the\r\nincidental protection which can be afforded by our revenue laws. Such a\r\nsystem, when once firmly established, would be permanent, and not be\r\nsubject to the constant complaints, agitations, and changes which must\r\never occur when duties are not laid for revenue, but for the \"protection\r\nmerely\" of a favored interest.\r\n\r\nIn the deliberations of Congress on this subject it is hoped that a\r\nspirit of mutual concession and compromise between conflicting interests\r\nmay prevail, and that the result of their labors may be crowned with the\r\nhappiest consequences.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution of the United States it is provided that \"no money\r\nshall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations\r\nmade by law.\" A public treasury was undoubtedly contemplated and\r\nintended to be created, in which the public money should be kept from\r\nthe period of collection until needed for public uses. In the collection\r\nand disbursement of the public money no agencies have ever been employed\r\nby law except such as were appointed by the Government, directly\r\nresponsible to it and under its control. The safe-keeping of the public\r\nmoney should be confided to a public treasury created by law and under\r\nlike responsibility and control. It is not to be imagined that the\r\nframers of the Constitution could have intended that a treasury should\r\nbe created as a place of deposit and safe-keeping of the public money\r\nwhich was irresponsible to the Government. The first Congress under the\r\nConstitution, by the act of the 2d of September, 1789, \"to establish the\r\nTreasury Department,\" provided for the appointment of a Treasurer, and\r\nmade it his duty \"to receive and keep the moneys of the United States\"\r\nand \"at all times to submit to the Secretary of the Treasury and the\r\nComptroller, or either of them, the inspection of the moneys in his\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nThat banks, national or State, could not have been intended to be used\r\nas a substitute for the Treasury spoken of in the Constitution as\r\nkeepers of the public money is manifest from the fact that at that time\r\nthere was no national bank, and but three or four State banks, of\r\nlimited capital, existed in the country. Their employment as\r\ndepositories was at first resorted to to a limited extent, but with no\r\navowed intention of continuing them permanently in place of the Treasury\r\nof the Constitution. When they were afterwards from time to time\r\nemployed, it was from motives of supposed convenience. Our experience\r\nhas shown that when banking corporations have been the keepers of the\r\npublic money, and been thereby made in effect the Treasury, the\r\nGovernment can have no guaranty that it can command the use of its own\r\nmoney for public purposes. The late Bank of the United States proved to\r\nbe faithless. The State banks which were afterwards employed were\r\nfaithless. But a few years ago, with millions of public money in their\r\nkeeping, the Government was brought almost to bankruptcy and the public\r\ncredit seriously impaired because of their inability or indisposition to\r\npay on demand to the public creditors in the only currency recognized by\r\nthe Constitution. Their failure occurred in a period of peace, and great\r\ninconvenience and loss were suffered by the public from it. Had the\r\ncountry been involved in a foreign war, that inconvenience and loss\r\nwould have been much greater, and might have resulted in extreme public\r\ncalamity. The public money should not be mingled with the private funds\r\nof banks or individuals or be used for private purposes. When it is\r\nplaced in banks for safe-keeping, it is in effect loaned to them without\r\ninterest, and is loaned by them upon interest to the borrowers from\r\nthem. The public money is converted into banking capital, and is used\r\nand loaned out for the private profit of bank stockholders, and when\r\ncalled for, as was the case in 1837, it may be in the pockets of the\r\nborrowers from the banks instead of being in the public Treasury\r\ncontemplated by the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution could\r\nnever have intended that the money paid into the Treasury should be thus\r\nconverted to private use and placed beyond the control of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBanks which hold the public money are often tempted by a desire of gain\r\nto extend their loans, increase their circulation, and thus stimulate,\r\nif not produce, a spirit of speculation and extravagance which sooner or\r\nlater must result in ruin to thousands. If the public money be not\r\npermitted to be thus used, but be kept in the Treasury and paid out to\r\nthe public creditors in gold and silver, the temptation afforded by its\r\ndeposit with banks to an undue expansion of their business would be\r\nchecked, while the amount of the constitutional currency left in\r\ncirculation would be enlarged by its employment in the public\r\ncollections and disbursements, and the banks themselves would in\r\nconsequence be found in a safer and sounder condition. At present State\r\nbanks are employed as depositories, but without adequate regulation of\r\nlaw whereby the public money can be secured against the casualties and\r\nexcesses, revulsions, suspensions, and defalcations to which from\r\noverissues, overtrading, an inordinate desire for gain, or other causes\r\nthey are constantly exposed. The Secretary of the Treasury has in all\r\ncases when it was practicable taken collateral security for the amount\r\nwhich they hold, by the pledge of stocks of the United States or such of\r\nthe States as were in good credit. Some of the deposit banks have given\r\nthis description of security and others have declined to do so.\r\n\r\nEntertaining the opinion that \"the separation of the moneys of the\r\nGovernment from banking institutions is indispensable for the safety of\r\nthe funds of the Government and the rights of the people,\" I recommend\r\nto Congress that provision be made by law for such separation, and that\r\na constitutional treasury be created for the safe-keeping of the public\r\nmoney. The constitutional treasury recommended is designed as a secure\r\ndepository for the public money, without any power to make loans or\r\ndiscounts or to issue any paper whatever as a currency or circulation.\r\nI can not doubt that such a treasury as was contemplated by the\r\nConstitution should be independent of all banking corporations.\r\nThe money of the people should be kept in the Treasury of the people\r\ncreated by law, and be in the custody of agents of the people chosen by\r\nthemselves according to the forms of the Constitution--agents who are\r\ndirectly responsible to the Government, who are under adequate bonds and\r\noaths, and who are subject to severe punishments for any embezzlement,\r\nprivate use, or misapplication of the public funds, and for any failure\r\nin other respects to perform their duties. To say that the people or\r\ntheir Government are incompetent or not to be trusted with the custody\r\nof their own money in their own Treasury, provided by themselves, but\r\nmust rely on the presidents, cashiers, and stockholders of banking\r\ncorporations, not appointed by them nor responsible to them, would be\r\nto concede that they are incompetent for self-government.\r\n\r\nIn recommending the establishment of a constitutional treasury in which\r\nthe public money shall be kept, I desire that adequate provision be made\r\nby law for its safety and that all Executive discretion or control over\r\nit shall be removed, except such as may be necessary in directing its\r\ndisbursement in pursuance of appropriations made by law.\r\n\r\nUnder our present land system, limiting the minimum price at which the\r\npublic lands can be entered to $1.25 per acre, large quantities of lands\r\nof inferior quality remain unsold because they will not command that\r\nprice. From the records of the General Land Office it appears that of\r\nthe public lands remaining unsold in the several States and Territories\r\nin which they are situated, 39,105,577 acres have been in the market\r\nsubject to entry more than twenty years, 49,638,644 acres for more than\r\nfifteen years, 73,074,600 acres for more than ten years, and 106,176,961\r\nacres for more than five years. Much the largest portion of these lands\r\nwill continue to be unsalable at the minimum price at which they are\r\npermitted to be sold so long as large territories of lands from which\r\nthe more valuable portions have not been selected are annually brought\r\ninto market by the Government. With the view to the sale and settlement\r\nof these inferior lands, I recommend that the price be graduated and\r\nreduced below the present minimum rate, confining the sales at the\r\nreduced prices to settlers and cultivators, in limited quantities. If\r\ngraduated and reduced in price for a limited term to $1 per acre, and\r\nafter the expiration of that period for a second and third term to lower\r\nrates, a large portion of these lands would be purchased, and many\r\nworthy citizens who are unable to pay higher rates could purchase homes\r\nfor themselves and their families. By adopting the policy of graduation\r\nand reduction of price these inferior lands will be sold for their real\r\nvalue, while the States in which they lie will be freed from the\r\ninconvenience, if not injustice, to which they are subjected in\r\nconsequence of the United States continuing to own large quantities of\r\nthe public lands within their borders not liable to taxation for the\r\nsupport of their local governments.\r\n\r\nI recommend the continuance of the policy of granting preemptions in its\r\nmost liberal extent to all those who have settled or may hereafter\r\nsettle on the public lands, whether surveyed or unsurveyed, to which the\r\nIndian title may have been extinguished at the time of settlement. It\r\nhas been found by experience that in consequence of combinations of\r\npurchasers and other causes a very small quantity of the public lands,\r\nwhen sold at public auction, commands a higher price than the minimum\r\nrates established by law. The settlers on the public lands are, however,\r\nbut rarely able to secure their homes and improvements at the public\r\nsales at that rate, because these combinations, by means of the capital\r\nthey command and their superior ability to purchase, render it\r\nimpossible for the settler to compete with them in the market. By\r\nputting down all competition these combinations of capitalists and\r\nspeculators are usually enabled to purchase the lands, including the\r\nimprovements of the settlers, at the minimum price of the Government,\r\nand either turn them out of their homes or extort from them, according\r\nto their ability to pay, double or quadruple the amount paid for them to\r\nthe Government. It is to the enterprise and perseverance of the hardy\r\npioneers of the West, who penetrate the wilderness with their families,\r\nsuffer the dangers, the privations, and hardships attending the\r\nsettlement of a new country, and prepare the way for the body of\r\nemigrants who in the course of a few years usually follow them, that we\r\nare in a great degree indebted for the rapid extension and\r\naggrandizement of our country.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that no portion of our population are more\r\npatriotic than the hardy and brave men of the frontier, or more ready to\r\nobey the call of their country and to defend her rights and her honor\r\nwhenever and by whatever enemy assailed. They should be protected from\r\nthe grasping speculator and secured, at the minimum price of the public\r\nlands, in the humble homes which they have improved by their labor. With\r\nthis end in view, all vexatious or unnecessary restrictions imposed upon\r\nthem by the existing preemption laws should be repealed or modified. It\r\nis the true policy of the Government to afford facilities to its\r\ncitizens to become the owners of small portions of our vast public\r\ndomain at low and moderate rates.\r\n\r\nThe present system of managing the mineral lands of the United States is\r\nbelieved to be radically defective. More than 1,000,000 acres of the\r\npublic lands, supposed to contain lead and other minerals, have been\r\nreserved from sale, and numerous leases upon them have been granted to\r\nindividuals upon a stipulated rent. The system of granting leases has\r\nproved to be not only unprofitable to the Government, but unsatisfactory\r\nto the citizens who have gone upon the lands, and must, if continued,\r\nlay the foundation of much future difficulty between the Government and\r\nthe lessees. According to the official records, the amount of rents\r\nreceived by the Government for the years 1841, 1842, 1843, and 1844 was\r\n$6,354.74, while the expenses of the system during the same period,\r\nincluding salaries of superintendents, agents, clerks, and incidental\r\nexpenses, were $26,111.11, the income being less than one-fourth of the\r\nexpenses. To this pecuniary loss may be added the injury sustained by\r\nthe public in consequence of the destruction of timber and the careless\r\nand wasteful manner of working the mines. The system has given rise to\r\nmuch litigation between the United States and individual citizens,\r\nproducing irritation and excitement in the mineral region, and involving\r\nthe Government in heavy additional expenditures. It is believed that\r\nsimilar losses and embarrassments will continue to occur while the\r\npresent system of leasing these lands remains unchanged. These lands are\r\nnow under the superintendence and care of the War Department, with the\r\nordinary duties of which they have no proper or natural connection. I\r\nrecommend the repeal of the present system, and that these lands be\r\nplaced under the superintendence and management of the General Land\r\nOffice, as other public lands, and be brought into market and sold upon\r\nsuch terms as Congress in their wisdom may prescribe, reserving to the\r\nGovernment an equitable percentage of the gross amount of mineral\r\nproduct, and that the preemption principle be extended to resident\r\nminers and settlers upon them at the minimum price which may be\r\nestablished by Congress.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War for\r\ninformation respecting the present situation of the Army and its\r\noperations during the past year, the state of our defenses, the\r\ncondition of the public works, and our relations with the various Indian\r\ntribes within our limits or upon our borders. I invite your attention to\r\nthe suggestions contained in that report in relation to these prominent\r\nobjects of national interest. When orders were given during the past\r\nsummer for concentrating a military force on the western frontier of\r\nTexas, our troops were widely dispersed and in small detachments,\r\noccupying posts remote from each other. The prompt and expeditious\r\nmanner in which an army embracing more than half our peace establishment\r\nwas drawn together on an emergency so sudden reflects great credit on\r\nthe officers who were intrusted with the execution of these orders, as\r\nwell as upon the discipline of the Army itself. To be in strength to\r\nprotect and defend the people and territory of Texas in the event Mexico\r\nshould commence hostilities or invade her territories with a large army,\r\nwhich she threatened, I authorized the general assigned to the command\r\nof the army of occupation to make requisitions for additional forces\r\nfrom several of the States nearest the Texan territory, and which could\r\nmost expeditiously furnish them, if in his opinion a larger force than\r\nthat under his command and the auxiliary aid which under like\r\ncircumstances he was authorized to receive from Texas should be\r\nrequired. The contingency upon which the exercise of this authority\r\ndepended has not occurred. The circumstances under which two companies\r\nof State artillery from the city of New Orleans were sent into Texas and\r\nmustered into the service of the United States are fully stated in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of War. I recommend to Congress that provision\r\nbe made for the payment of these troops, as well as a small number of\r\nTexan volunteers whom the commanding general thought it necessary to\r\nreceive or muster into our service.\r\n\r\nDuring the last summer the First Regiment of Dragoons made extensive\r\nexcursions through the Indian country on our borders, a part of them\r\nadvancing nearly to the possessions of the Hudsons Bay Company in the\r\nnorth, and a part as far as the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains and\r\nthe head waters of the tributary streams of the Colorado of the West.\r\nThe exhibition of this military force among the Indian tribes in those\r\ndistant regions and the councils held with them by the commanders of the\r\nexpeditions, it is believed, will have a salutary influence in\r\nrestraining them from hostilities among themselves and maintaining\r\nfriendly relations between them and the United States. An interesting\r\naccount of one of these excursions accompanies the report of the\r\nSecretary of War. Under the directions of the War Department Brevet\r\nCaptain Frémont, of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, has been\r\nemployed since 1842 in exploring the country west of the Mississippi and\r\nbeyond the Rocky Mountains. Two expeditions have already been brought to\r\na close, and the reports of that scientific and enterprising officer\r\nhave furnished much interesting and valuable information. He is now\r\nengaged in a third expedition, but it is not expected that this arduous\r\nservice will be completed in season to enable me to communicate the\r\nresult to Congress at the present session.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Indian tribes are of a favorable character.\r\nThe policy of removing them to a country designed for their permanent\r\nresidence west of the Mississippi, and without the limits of the\r\norganized States and Territories, is better appreciated by them than it\r\nwas a few years ago, while education is now attended to and the habits\r\nof civilized life are gaining ground among them.\r\n\r\nSerious difficulties of long standing continue to distract the several\r\nparties into which the Cherokees are unhappily divided. The efforts of\r\nthe Government to adjust the difficulties between them have heretofore\r\nproved unsuccessful, and there remains no probability that this\r\ndesirable object can be accomplished without the aid of further\r\nlegislation by Congress. I will at an early period of your session\r\npresent the subject for your consideration, accompanied with an\r\nexposition of the complaints and claims of the several parties into\r\nwhich the nation is divided, with a view to the adoption of such\r\nmeasures by Congress as may enable the Executive to do justice to them,\r\nrespectively, and to put an end, if possible, to the dissensions which\r\nhave long prevailed and still prevail among them.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for the present\r\ncondition of that branch of the national defense and for grave\r\nsuggestions having for their object the increase of its efficiency and a\r\ngreater economy in its management. During the past year the officers and\r\nmen have performed their duty in a satisfactory manner. The orders which\r\nhave been given have been executed with promptness and fidelity. A\r\nlarger force than has often formed one squadron under our flag was\r\nreadily concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico, and apparently without\r\nunusual effort. It is especially to be observed that notwithstanding the\r\nunion of so considerable a force, no act was committed that even the\r\njealousy of an irritated power could construe as an act of aggression,\r\nand that the commander of the squadron and his officers, in strict\r\nconformity with their instructions, holding themselves ever ready\r\nfor the most active duty, have achieved the still purer glory of\r\ncontributing to the preservation of peace. It is believed that at all\r\nour foreign stations the honor of our flag has been maintained and that\r\ngenerally our ships of war have been distinguished for their good\r\ndiscipline and order. I am happy to add that the display of maritime\r\nforce which was required by the events of the summer has been made\r\nwholly within the usual appropriations for the service of the year, so\r\nthat no additional appropriations are required.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States, and with it the navigating interests,\r\nhave steadily and rapidly increased since the organization of our\r\nGovernment, until, it is believed, we are now second to but one power in\r\nthe world, and at no distant day we shall probably be inferior to none.\r\nExposed as they must be, it has been a wise policy to afford to these\r\nimportant interests protection with our ships of war distributed in the\r\ngreat highways of trade throughout the world. For more than thirty years\r\nappropriations have been made and annually expended for the gradual\r\nincrease of our naval forces. In peace our Navy performs the important\r\nduty of protecting our commerce, and in the event of war will be, as it\r\nhas been, a most efficient means of defense.\r\n\r\nThe successful use of steam navigation on the ocean has been followed by\r\nthe introduction of war steamers in great and increasing numbers into\r\nthe navies of the principal maritime powers of the world. A due regard\r\nto our own safety and to an efficient protection to our large and\r\nincreasing commerce demands a corresponding increase on our part. No\r\ncountry has greater facilities for the construction of vessels of this\r\ndescription than ours, or can promise itself greater advantages from\r\ntheir employment. They are admirably adapted to the protection of our\r\ncommerce, to the rapid transmission of intelligence, and to the coast\r\ndefense. In pursuance of the wise policy of a gradual increase of our\r\nNavy, large supplies of live-oak timber and other materials for\r\nshipbuilding have been collected and are now under shelter and in a\r\nstate of good preservation, while iron steamers can be built with great\r\nfacility in various parts of the Union. The use of iron as a material,\r\nespecially in the construction of steamers which can enter with safety\r\nmany of the harbors along our coast now inaccessible to vessels of\r\ngreater draft, and the practicability of constructing them in the\r\ninterior, strongly recommend that liberal appropriations should be made\r\nfor this important object. Whatever may have been our policy in the\r\nearlier stages of the Government, when the nation was in its infancy,\r\nour shipping interests and commerce comparatively small, our resources\r\nlimited, our population sparse and scarcely extending beyond the limits\r\nof the original thirteen States, that policy must be essentially\r\ndifferent now that we have grown from three to more than twenty millions\r\nof people, that our commerce, carried in our own ships, is found in\r\nevery sea, and that our territorial boundaries and settlements have been\r\nso greatly expanded. Neither our commerce nor our long line of coast on\r\nthe ocean and on the Lakes can be successfully defended against foreign\r\naggression by means of fortifications alone. These are essential at\r\nimportant commercial and military points, but our chief reliance for\r\nthis object must be on a well-organized, efficient navy. The benefits\r\nresulting from such a navy are not confined to the Atlantic States. The\r\nproductions of the interior which seek a market abroad are directly\r\ndependent on the safety and freedom of our commerce. The occupation of\r\nthe Balize below New Orleans by a hostile force would embarrass, if not\r\nstagnate, the whole export trade of the Mississippi and affect the value\r\nof the agricultural products of the entire valley of that mighty river\r\nand its tributaries.\r\n\r\nIt has never been our policy to maintain large standing armies in time\r\nof peace. They are contrary to the genius of our free institutions,\r\nwould impose heavy burdens on the people and be dangerous to public\r\nliberty. Our reliance for protection and defense on the land must be\r\nmainly on our citizen soldiers, who will be ever ready, as they ever\r\nhave been ready in times past, to rush with alacrity, at the call of\r\ntheir country, to her defense. This description of force, however, can\r\nnot defend our coast, harbors, and inland seas, nor protect our commerce\r\non the ocean or the Lakes. These must be protected by our Navy.\r\n\r\nConsidering an increased naval force, and especially of steam vessels,\r\ncorresponding with our growth and importance as a nation, and\r\nproportioned to the increased and increasing naval power of other\r\nnations, of vast importance as regards our safety, and the great and\r\ngrowing interests to be protected by it, I recommend the subject to the\r\nfavorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General herewith communicated contains a\r\ndetailed statement of the operations of his Department during the past\r\nyear. It will be seen that the income from postages will fall short of\r\nthe expenditures for the year between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000. This\r\ndeficiency has been caused by the reduction of the rates of postage,\r\nwhich was made by the act of the 3d of March last. No principle has been\r\nmore generally acquiesced in by the people than that this Department\r\nshould sustain itself by limiting its expenditures to its income.\r\nCongress has never sought to make it a source of revenue for general\r\npurposes except for a short period during the last war with Great\r\nBritain, nor should it ever become a charge on the general Treasury. If\r\nCongress shall adhere to this principle, as I think they ought, it will\r\nbe necessary either to curtail the present mail service so as to reduce\r\nthe expenditures, or so to modify the act of the 3d of March last as to\r\nimprove its revenues. The extension of the mail service and the\r\nadditional facilities which will be demanded by the rapid extension and\r\nincrease of population on our western frontier will not admit of such\r\ncurtailment as will materially reduce the present expenditures. In the\r\nadjustment of the tariff of postages the interests of the people demand\r\nthat the lowest rates be adopted which will produce the necessary\r\nrevenue to meet the expenditures of the Department. I invite the\r\nattention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General on\r\nthis subject, under the belief that such a modification of the late law\r\nmay be made as will yield sufficient revenue without further calls on\r\nthe Treasury, and with very little change in the present rates of\r\npostage. Proper measures have been taken in pursuance of the act of the\r\n3d of March last for the establishment of lines of mail steamers between\r\nthis and foreign countries. The importance of this service commends\r\nitself strongly to favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of our country the public business which devolves on the\r\nheads of the several Executive Departments has greatly increased. In\r\nsome respects the distribution of duties among them seems to be\r\nincongruous, and many of these might be transferred from one to another\r\nwith advantage to the public interests. A more auspicious time for the\r\nconsideration of this subject by Congress, with a view to system in the\r\norganization of the several Departments and a more appropriate division\r\nof the public business, will not probably occur.\r\n\r\nThe most important duties of the State Department relate to our foreign\r\naffairs. By the great enlargement of the family of nations, the increase\r\nof our commerce, and the corresponding extension of our consular system\r\nthe business of this Department has been greatly increased.\r\n\r\nIn its present organization many duties of a domestic nature and\r\nconsisting of details are devolved on the Secretary of State, which do\r\nnot appropriately belong to the foreign department of the Government and\r\nmay properly be transferred to some other Department. One of these grows\r\nout of the present state of the law concerning the Patent Office, which\r\na few years since was a subordinate clerkship, but has become a distinct\r\nbureau of great importance. With an excellent internal organization, it\r\nis still connected with the State Department. In the transaction of its\r\nbusiness questions of much importance to inventors and to the community\r\nfrequently arise, which by existing laws are referred for decision to a\r\nboard of which the Secretary of State is a member. These questions are\r\nlegal, and the connection which now exists between the State Department\r\nand the Patent Office may with great propriety and advantage be\r\ntransferred to the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nIn his last annual message to Congress Mr. Madison invited attention to\r\na proper provision for the Attorney-General as \"an important improvement\r\nin the executive establishment,\" This recommendation was repeated by\r\nsome of his successors. The official duties of the Attorney-General have\r\nbeen much increased within a few years,' and his office has become one\r\nof great importance. His duties may be still further increased with\r\nadvantage to the public interests. As an executive officer his residence\r\nand constant attention at the seat of Government are required. Legal\r\nquestions involving important principles and large amounts of public\r\nmoney are constantly referred to him by the President and Executive\r\nDepartments for his examination and decision. The public business under\r\nhis official management before the judiciary has been so augmented by\r\nthe extension of our territory and the acts of Congress authorizing\r\nsuits against the United States for large bodies of valuable public\r\nlands as greatly to increase his labors and responsibilities. I\r\ntherefore recommend that the Attorney-General be placed on the same\r\nfooting with the heads of the other Executive Departments, with such\r\nsubordinate officers provided by law for his Department as may be\r\nrequired to discharge the additional duties which have been or may be\r\ndevolved upon him.\r\n\r\nCongress possess the power of exclusive legislation over the District of\r\nColumbia, and I commend the interests of its inhabitants to your\r\nfavorable consideration. The people of this District have no legislative\r\nbody of their own, and must confide their local as well as their general\r\ninterests to representatives in whose election they have no voice and\r\nover whose official conduct they have no control. Each member of the\r\nNational Legislature should consider himself as their immediate\r\nrepresentative, and should be the more ready to give attention to their\r\ninterests and wants because he is not responsible to them. I recommend\r\nthat a liberal and generous spirit may characterize your measures in\r\nrelation to them. I shall be ever disposed to show a proper regard for\r\ntheir wishes and, within constitutional limits, shall at all times\r\ncheerfully cooperate with you for the advancement of their welfare.\r\n\r\nI trust it may not be deemed inappropriate to the occasion for me to\r\ndwell for a moment on the memory of the most eminent citizen of our\r\ncountry who during the summer that is gone by has descended to the tomb.\r\nThe enjoyment of contemplating, at the advanced age of near fourscore\r\nyears, the happy condition of his country cheered the last hours of\r\nAndrew Jackson, who departed this life in the tranquil hope of a blessed\r\nimmortality. His death was happy, as his life had been eminently useful.\r\nHe had an unfaltering confidence in the virtue and capacity of the\r\npeople and in the permanence of that free Government which he had\r\nlargely contributed to establish and defend. His great deeds had secured\r\nto him the affections of his fellow-citizens, and it was his happiness\r\nto witness the growth and glory of his country, which he loved so well.\r\nHe departed amidst the benedictions of millions of freemen. The nation\r\npaid its tribute to his memory at his tomb. Coming generations will\r\nlearn from his example the love of country and the rights of man. In his\r\nlanguage on a similar occasion to the present, \"I now commend you,\r\nfellow-citizens, to the guidance of Almighty God, with a full reliance\r\non His merciful providence for the maintenance of our free institutions,\r\nand with an earnest supplication that whatever errors it may be my lot\r\nto commit in discharging the arduous duties which have devolved on me\r\nwill find a remedy in the harmony and wisdom of your counsels.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 16, 1845_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate, for its consideration, a\r\nconvention concluded and signed at Berlin on the 29th day of January,\r\n1845, between the United States and Prussia, together with certain other\r\nGerman States, for the mutual extradition of fugitives from justice in\r\ncertain cases; and I communicate with the convention the correspondence\r\nnecessary to explain it.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this convention to the Senate I deem it proper to call\r\ntheir attention to the third article, by which it is stipulated that\r\n\"none of the contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own\r\ncitizens or subjects under the stipulations of this convention.\"\r\n\r\nNo such reservation is to be found in our treaties of extradition with\r\nGreat Britain and France, the only two nations with whom we have\r\nconcluded such treaties. These provide for the surrender of all persons\r\nwho are fugitives from justice, without regard to the country to which\r\nthey may belong. Under this article, if German subjects of any of the\r\nparties to the convention should commit crimes within the United States\r\nand fly back to their native country from justice, they would not be\r\nsurrendered. This is clear in regard to all such Germans as shall not\r\nhave been naturalized under our laws. But even after naturalization\r\ndifficult and embarrassing questions might arise between the parties.\r\nThese German powers, holding the doctrine of perpetual allegiance, might\r\nrefuse to surrender German naturalized citizens, whilst we must ever\r\nmaintain the principle that the rights and duties of such citizens are\r\nthe same as if they had been born in the United States.\r\n\r\nI would also observe that the fourth article of the treaty submitted\r\ncontains a provision not to be found in our conventions with Great\r\nBritain and France.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

The\r\npromotions are all regular except that of Captain Martin Scott, Fifth\r\nInfantry, whose name, agreeably to the decision of the President and\r\nyour instructions, is submitted to fill the vacancy of major in the\r\nFirst Regiment of Infantry (_vice_ Dearborn, promoted), over the two\r\nsenior captains of Infantry, Captain John B.

Clark, Third Infantry, would be entitled to\r\nsucceed, I deem it proper to submit the following statement, extracted\r\nfrom the official returns of his regiment, touching his physical\r\ncapacity for the performance of military duty.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1836, Captain Clark went on the recruiting service, where he\r\nremained till October 4, 1838, when he was granted a three months'\r\nleave. He joined his company at Fort Towson in May, 1839, and continued\r\nwith it from that time till March, 1841, accompanying it meanwhile\r\n(October, 1840) to Florida. He obtained a three months' leave on\r\nsurgeon's certificate of ill health March 23, 1841, but did not rejoin\r\ntill February 16, 1842. In the interim he was placed on duty for a\r\nshort time as a member of a general court-martial, which happened to be\r\nconvened at St. Louis, where he was then staying. He remained with his\r\ncompany from February to November, 1842, when he again received a leave\r\nfor the benefit of his health, and did not return to duty till April 26,\r\n1843 (after his regiment had been ordered to Florida), when he rejoined\r\nit at Jefferson Barracks. He continued with it (with the exception of\r\none short leave) from April, 1843, till June, 1845, but the returns show\r\nhim to have been frequently on the sick report during that period. On\r\nthe 2d of June, 1845, his company being then encamped near Fort Jessup\r\nin expectation of orders for Texas, he again procured a leave on account\r\nof his health, and has not since been able to rejoin, reporting monthly\r\nthat his health unfitted him for the performance of duty. The signature\r\nof his last report (not written by himself), of November 30\r\n(herewith[5]), would seem to indicate great physical derangement or\r\ndecrepitude, approaching, perhaps, to paralysis.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it appears that during the last seven years (since\r\nOctober, 1838) Captain Clark has been off duty two years and four\r\nmonths, the greater part of the time on account of sickness, and that\r\neven when present with his company his health is so much impaired that\r\nvery often he is unable to perform the ordinary garrison duties.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is respectfully submitted, for the\r\nconsideration of the proper authority, whether the senior captain of\r\ninfantry should not be passed over and (as Brevet Major Noel,[6] the\r\nnext in rank, is utterly disqualified) Captain Martin Scott, of the\r\nFifth Infantry, promoted to the vacant majority.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to state that Captain Clark has always been regarded as a\r\nperfect gentleman, and as such, as far as I know, is equal to any\r\nofficer in the Army.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nR. JONES,\r\n  _Adjutant-General._\r\n\r\n[Remarks indorsed on the foregoing report by the General in Chief.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 30, 1845.\r\n\r\nThis report presents grave points for consideration. It is highly\r\nimprobable that the Captain will ever be fit for the active duties of\r\nhis profession. The question, therefore, seems to be whether he shall be\r\na pensioner on full pay as captain or as major, for he has long been,\r\nnot in name, but in fact, a pensioner on full pay. We have no half pay\r\nin the Army to relieve marching regiments of crippled and superannuated\r\nofficers. We have many such--Colonel Maury, of the Third Infantry\r\n(superannuated), and Majors Cobb and McClintock, Fifth Infantry and\r\nThird Artillery (crippled). Many others are fast becoming superannuated.\r\nThe three named are on indefinite leaves of absence, and so are Majors\r\nSearle and Noel, permanent cripples from wounds. General Cass's\r\nresolution of yesterday refers simply to age. A half pay or retired list\r\nwith half pay would be much better. There are some twenty officers who\r\nought at once to be placed on such list and their places filled by\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I think it best that Captain M. Scott should be\r\npromoted, _vice_ Dearborn, _vice_ Lieutenant-Colonel Hoffman.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nWINFIELD SCOTT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In 1839 Brevet Major Noel, Sixth Infantry, was severely\r\nwounded (serving in the Florida War at the time) by the accidental\r\ndischarge of his own pistol. He left his company February 16, 1839, and\r\nhas ever since been absent from his regiment, the state of his wound and\r\ngreat suffering rendering him utterly incapable of performing any kind\r\nof duty whatever; nor is there any reason to hope he will ever be able\r\nto resume his duties.]\r\n\r\nR.

POLK.\r\n\r\n[A similar message was sent to the Senate in compliance with a request\r\nof that body.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 23, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for your consideration, a correspondence between the\r\nminister of Her Britannic Majesty in Washington and the Secretary of\r\nState, containing an arrangement for the adjustment and payment of the\r\nclaims of the respective Governments upon each other arising from the\r\ncollection of certain import duties in violation of the second article\r\nof the commercial convention of 3d of July, 1815, between the two\r\ncountries, and I respectfully submit to Congress the propriety of making\r\nprovision to carry this arrangement into effect.\r\n\r\nThe second article of this convention provides that \"no higher or other\r\nduties shall be imposed on the importation into the United States of any\r\narticles the growth, produce, or manufacture of His Britannic Majesty's\r\nterritories in Europe, and no higher or other duties shall be imposed on\r\nthe importation into the territories of His Britannic Majesty in Europe\r\nof any articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of the United\r\nStates, than are or shall be payable on the like articles being the\r\ngrowth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to the act of Parliament of the 13th of August, 1836, the duty\r\non foreign rough rice imported into Great Britain was 2s. 6d. sterling\r\nper bushel. By this act the duty was reduced to 1 penny per quarter (of\r\n8 bushels) on the rough rice \"imported from the west coast of Africa.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the earnest and repeated remonstrances of our ministers at London\r\nin opposition to this discrimination against American and in favor of\r\nAfrican rice, as a violation of the subsisting convention, Parliament,\r\nby the act of 9th July, 1842, again equalized the duty on all foreign\r\nrough rice by fixing it at 7s. per quarter., In the intervening period,\r\nhowever, of nearly six years large importations had been made into Great\r\nBritain of American rough rice, which was subjected to a duty of 2s. 6d.\r\nper bushel; but the importers, knowing their rights under the\r\nconvention, claimed that it should be admitted at the rate of 1 penny\r\nper quarter, the duty imposed on African rice. This claim was resisted\r\nby the British Government, and the excess of duty was paid, at the first\r\nunder protest, and afterwards, in consequence of an arrangement with the\r\nboard of customs, by the deposit of exchequer bills.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been a clear violation both of the letter and spirit of\r\nthe convention to admit rough rice \"the growth\" of Africa at 1 penny per\r\nquarter, whilst the very same article \"the growth\" of the United States\r\nwas charged with a duty of 2s. 6d. per bushel.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Great Britain, under the same article of the convention, is\r\nfounded on the tariff act of 30th August, 1842. Its twenty-fifth section\r\nprovides \"that nothing in this act contained shall apply to goods\r\nshipped in a vessel bound to any port of the United States, actually\r\nhaving left her last port of lading eastward of the Cape of Good Hope or\r\nbeyond Cape Horn prior to the 1st day of September, 1842; and all legal\r\nprovisions and regulations existing immediately before the 30th day of\r\nJune, 1842, shall be applied to importations which may be made in\r\nvessels which have left such last port of lading eastward of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope or beyond Cape Horn prior to said 1st day of September, 1842.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Government contends that it was a violation of the second\r\narticle of the convention for this act to require that \"articles the\r\ngrowth, produce, or manufacture\" of Great Britain, when imported into\r\nthe United States in vessels which had left their last port of lading in\r\nGreat Britain prior to the 1st day of September, 1842, should pay any\r\n\"higher or other duties\" than were imposed on \"like articles\" \"the\r\ngrowth, produce, or manufacture\" of countries beyond the Cape of Good\r\nHope and Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nUpon a careful consideration of the subject I arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat this claim on the part of the British Government was well founded.\r\nI deem it unnecessary to state my reasons at length for adopting this\r\nopinion, the whole subject being fully explained in the letter of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and the accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nThe amount necessary to satisfy the British claim can not at present be\r\nascertained with any degree of accuracy, no individual having yet\r\npresented his case to the Government of the United States. It is not\r\napprehended that the amount will be large. After such examination of the\r\nsubject as it has been in his power to make, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury believes that it will not exceed $100,000.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the claims of the importers of rough rice into Great\r\nBritain have been already ascertained, as the duties were paid either\r\nunder protest or in exchequer bills. Their amount is stated by Mr.\r\nEverett, our late minister at London, in a dispatch dated June 1, 1843,\r\nto be £88,886 16s. 10d. sterling, of which £60,006 4d. belong to\r\ncitizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs it may be long before the amount of the British claim can be\r\nascertained, and it would be unreasonable to postpone payment to the\r\nAmerican claimants until this can be adjusted, it has been proposed to\r\nthe British Government immediately to refund the excess of duties\r\ncollected by it on American rough rice. I should entertain a confident\r\nhope that this proposal would be accepted should the arrangement\r\nconcluded be sanctioned by an act of Congress making provision for the\r\nreturn of the duties in question. The claimants might then be paid as\r\nthey present their demands, properly authenticated, to the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 24, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the inquiry of the Senate contained in their resolution of\r\nthe 17th instant, whether in my \"judgment any circumstances connected\r\nwith or growing out of the foreign relations of this country require at\r\nthis time an increase of our naval or military force,\" and, if so, \"what\r\nthose circumstances are,\" I have to express the opinion that a wise\r\nprecaution demands such increase.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of the 2d of December last I recommended to the\r\nfavorable consideration of Congress an increase of our naval force,\r\nespecially of our steam navy, and the raising of an adequate military\r\nforce to guard and protect such of our citizens as might think proper to\r\nemigrate to Oregon. Since that period I have seen no cause to recall or\r\nmodify these recommendations. On the contrary, reasons exist which, in\r\nmy judgment, render it proper not only that they should be promptly\r\ncarried into effect, but that additional provision should be made for\r\nthe public defense.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of such additional provision was brought before\r\nappropriate committees of the two Houses of Congress, in answer to calls\r\nmade by them, in reports prepared, with my sanction, by the Secretary of\r\nWar and the Secretary of the Navy on the 29th of December and the 8th of\r\nJanuary last--a mode of communication with Congress not unusual, and\r\nunder existing circumstances believed to be most eligible. Subsequent\r\nevents have confirmed me in the opinion that these recommendations were\r\nproper as precautionary measures.\r\n\r\nIt was a wise maxim of the Father of his Country that \"to be prepared\r\nfor war is one of the most efficient means of preserving peace,\" and\r\nthat, \"avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace,\" we should\r\n\"remember also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger\r\nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it.\" The general\r\nobligation to perform this duty is greatly strengthened by facts known\r\nto the whole world. A controversy respecting the Oregon Territory now\r\nexists between the United States and Great Britain, and while, as far\r\nas we know, the relations of the latter with all European nations are\r\nof the most pacific character, she is making unusual and extraordinary\r\narmaments and warlike preparations, naval and military, both at home and\r\nin her North American possessions.\r\n\r\nIt can not be disguised that, however sincere may be the desire of\r\npeace, in the event of a rupture these armaments and preparations would\r\nbe used against our country. Whatever may have been the original purpose\r\nof these preparations, the fact is undoubted that they are now\r\nproceeding, in part at least, with a view to the contingent possibility\r\nof a war with the United States. The general policy of making additional\r\nwarlike preparations was distinctly announced in the speech from the\r\nthrone as late as January last, and has since been reiterated by the\r\nministers of the Crown in both houses of Parliament. Under this aspect\r\nof our relations with Great Britain, I can not doubt the propriety of\r\nincreasing our means of defense both by land and sea. This can give\r\nGreat Britain no cause of offense nor increase the danger of a rupture.\r\nIf, on the contrary, we should fold our arms in security and at last be\r\nsuddenly involved in hostilities for the maintenance of our just rights\r\nwithout any adequate preparation, our responsibility to the country\r\nwould be of the gravest character. Should collision between the two\r\ncountries be avoided, as I sincerely trust it may be, the additional\r\ncharge upon the Treasury in making the necessary preparations will\r\nnot be lost, while in the event of such a collision they would be\r\nindispensable for the maintenance of our national rights and national\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nI have seen no reason to change or modify the recommendations of my\r\nannual message in regard to the Oregon question. The notice to abrogate\r\nthe treaty of the 6th of August, 1827, is authorized by the treaty\r\nitself and can not be regarded as a warlike measure, and I can not\r\nwithhold my strong conviction that it should be promptly given. The\r\nother recommendations are in conformity with the existing treaty, and\r\nwould afford to American citizens in Oregon no more than the same\r\nmeasure of protection which has long since been extended to British\r\nsubjects in that Territory.\r\n\r\nThe state of our relations with Mexico is still in an unsettled\r\ncondition. Since the meeting of Congress another revolution has taken\r\nplace in that country, by which the Government has passed into the hands\r\nof new rulers. This event has procrastinated, and may possibly defeat,\r\nthe settlement of the differences between the United States and that\r\ncountry. The minister of the United States to Mexico at the date of\r\nthe last advices had not been received by the existing authorities.\r\nDemonstrations of a character hostile to the United States continue to\r\nbe made in Mexico, which has rendered it proper, in my judgment, to keep\r\nnearly two-thirds of our Army on our southwestern frontier. In doing\r\nthis many of the regular military posts have been reduced to a small\r\nforce inadequate to their defense should an emergency arise.\r\n\r\nIn view of these \"circumstances,\" it is my \"judgment\" that \"an increase\r\nof our naval and military force is at this time required\" to place the\r\ncountry in a suitable state of defense. At the same time, it is my\r\nsettled purpose to pursue such a course of policy as may be best\r\ncalculated to preserve both with Great Britain and Mexico an honorable\r\npeace, which nothing will so effectually promote as unanimity in our\r\ncouncils and a firm maintenance of all our just rights.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 13, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of the 2d of December last it was stated that\r\nserious difficulties of long standing continued to distract the several\r\nparties into which the Cherokee tribe of Indians is unhappily divided;\r\nthat all the efforts of the Government to adjust these difficulties had\r\nproved to be unsuccessful, and would probably remain so without the aid\r\nof further legislation by Congress. Subsequent events have confirmed\r\nthis opinion.\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith, for the information of Congress, a report of the\r\nSecretary of War, transmitting a report of the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs, with accompanying documents, together with memorials which have\r\nbeen received from the several bands or parties of the Cherokees\r\nthemselves. It will be perceived that internal feuds still exist which\r\ncall for the prompt intervention of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nSince the meeting of Congress several unprovoked murders have been\r\ncommitted by the stronger upon the weaker party of the tribe, which will\r\nprobably remain unpunished by the Indian authorities; and there is\r\nreason to apprehend that similar outrages will continue to be\r\nperpetrated unless restrained by the authorities of the United States.\r\n\r\nMany of the weaker party have been compelled to seek refuge beyond the\r\nlimits of the Indian country and within the State of Arkansas, and are\r\ndestitute of the means for their daily subsistence. The military forces\r\nof the United States stationed on the western frontier have been active\r\nin their exertions to suppress these outrages and to execute the treaty\r\nof 1835, by which it is stipulated that \"the United States agree to\r\nprotect the Cherokee Nation from domestic strife and foreign enemies,\r\nand against intestine wars between the several tribes.\"\r\n\r\nThese exertions of the Army have proved to a great extent unavailing,\r\nfor the reasons stated in the accompanying documents, including\r\ncommunications from the officer commanding at Fort Gibson.\r\n\r\nI submit, for the consideration of Congress, the propriety of making\r\nsuch amendments of the laws regulating intercourse with the Indian\r\ntribes as will subject to trial and punishment in the courts of the\r\nUnited States all Indians guilty of murder and such other felonies as\r\nmay be designated, when committed on other Indians within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\nSuch a modification of the existing laws is suggested because if\r\noffenders against the laws of humanity in the Indian country are left\r\nto be punished by Indian laws they will generally, if not always, be\r\npermitted to escape with impunity. This has been the case in repeated\r\ninstances among the Cherokees. For years unprovoked murders have been\r\ncommitted, and yet no effort has been made to bring the offenders to\r\npunishment. Should this state of things continue, it is not difficult to\r\nforesee that the weaker party will be finally destroyed. As the guardian\r\nof the Indian tribes, the Government of the United States is bound by\r\nevery consideration of duty and humanity to interpose to prevent such\r\na disaster.\r\n\r\nFrom the examination which I have made into the actual state of things\r\nin the Cherokee Nation I am satisfied that there is no probability that\r\nthe different bands or parties into which it is divided can ever again\r\nlive together in peace and harmony, and that the well-being of the whole\r\nrequires that they should be separated and live under separate\r\ngovernments as distinct tribes.\r\n\r\nThat portion who emigrated to the west of the Mississippi prior to the\r\nyear 1819, commonly called the \"Old Settlers,\" and that portion who made\r\nthe treaty of 1835, known as the \"treaty party,\" it is believed would\r\nwillingly unite, and could live together in harmony. The number of\r\nthese, as nearly as can be estimated, is about one-third of the tribe.\r\nThe whole number of all the bands or parties does not probably exceed\r\n20,000. The country which they occupy embraces 7,000,000 acres of land,\r\nwith the privilege of an outlet to the western limits of the United\r\nStates. This country is susceptible of division, and is large enough for\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress the propriety of either dividing the country which\r\nthey at present occupy or of providing by law a new home for the one or\r\nthe other of the bands or parties now in hostile array against each\r\nother, as the most effectual, if not the only, means of preserving the\r\nweaker party from massacre and total extermination. Should Congress\r\nfavor the division of the country as suggested, and the separation of\r\nthe Cherokees into two distinct tribes, justice will require that the\r\nannuities and funds belonging to the whole, now held in trust for them\r\nby the United States, should be equitably distributed among the parties,\r\naccording to their respective claims and numbers.\r\n\r\nThere is still a small number of the Cherokee tribe remaining within the\r\nState of North Carolina, who, according to the stipulations of the\r\ntreaty of 1835, should have emigrated with their brethren to the west of\r\nthe Mississippi. It is desirable that they should be removed, and in the\r\nevent of a division of the country in the West, or of a new home being\r\nprovided for a portion of the tribe, that they be permitted to join\r\neither party, as they may prefer, and be incorporated with them.\r\n\r\nI submit the whole subject to Congress, that such legislative measures\r\nmay be adopted as will be just to all the parties or bands of the tribe.\r\nSuch measures, I am satisfied, are the only means of arresting the\r\nhorrid and inhuman massacres which have marked the history of the\r\nCherokees for the last few years, and especially for the last few\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees have been regarded as among the most enlightened of the\r\nIndian tribes, but experience has proved that they have not yet advanced\r\nto such a state of civilization as to dispense with the guardian care\r\nand control of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 14, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of the 3d of March, 1845, I communicate\r\nherewith to Congress a report of the Secretaries of War and the Navy on\r\nthe subject of a fireproof building for the War and Navy Departments,\r\ntogether with documents explaining the plans to which it refers and\r\ncontaining an estimate of the cost of erecting the buildings proposed.\r\n\r\nCongress having made no appropriation for the employment of an architect\r\nto prepare and submit the necessary plans, none was appointed. Several\r\nskillful architects were invited to submit plans and estimates, and from\r\nthose that were voluntarily furnished a selection has been made of such\r\nas would furnish the requisite building for the accommodation of the War\r\nand Navy Departments at the least expense.\r\n\r\nAll the plans and estimates which have been received are herewith\r\ncommunicated, for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 20, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have considered the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n9th instant, by which I am requested \"to cause to be furnished to that\r\nHouse an account of all payments made on President's certificates\r\nfrom the fund appropriated by law, through the agency of the State\r\nDepartment, for the contingent expenses of foreign intercourse from the\r\n4th of March, 1841, until the retirement of Daniel Webster from the\r\nDepartment of State, with copies of all entries, receipts, letters,\r\nvouchers, memorandums, or other evidence of such payments, to whom paid,\r\nfor what, and particularly all concerning the northeastern-boundary\r\ndispute with Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nWith an anxious desire to furnish to the House any information requested\r\nby that body which may be in the Executive Departments, I have felt\r\nbound by a sense of public duty to inquire how far I could with\r\npropriety, or consistently with the existing laws, respond to their\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nThe usual annual appropriation \"for the contingent expenses of\r\nintercourse between the United States and foreign nations\" has been\r\ndisbursed since the date of the act of May 1, 1810, in pursuance of\r\nits provisions. By the third section of that act it is provided--\r\n\r\n  That when any sum or sums of money shall be drawn from the Treasury\r\n  under any law making appropriation for the contingent expenses of\r\n  intercourse between the United States and foreign nations the President\r\n  shall be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause the same to be duly\r\n  settled annually with the accounting officers of the Treasury in the\r\n  manner following; that is to say, by causing the same to be accounted\r\n  for specially in all instances wherein the expenditure thereof may in\r\n  his judgment be made public, and by making a certificate of the amount\r\n  of such expenditures as he may think it advisable not to specify; and\r\n  every such certificate shall be deemed a sufficient voucher for the sum\r\n  or sums therein expressed to have been expended.\r\n\r\nTwo distinct classes of expenditure are authorized by this law--the one\r\nof a public and the other of a private and confidential character. The\r\nPresident in office at the time of the expenditure is made by the law\r\nthe sole judge whether it shall be public or private. Such sums are to\r\nbe \"accounted for specially in all instances wherein the expenditure\r\nthereof may in his judgment be made public.\" All expenditures \"accounted\r\nfor specially\" are settled at the Treasury upon vouchers, and not on\r\n\"President's certificates,\" and, like all other public accounts, are\r\nsubject to be called for by Congress, and are open to public\r\nexamination. Had information as respects this class of expenditures been\r\ncalled for by the resolution of the House, it would have been promptly\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nCongress, foreseeing that it might become necessary and proper to apply\r\nportions of this fund for objects the original accounts and vouchers for\r\nwhich could not be \"made public\" without injury to the public interests,\r\nauthorized the President, instead of such accounts and vouchers, to make\r\na certificate of the amount \"of such expenditures as he may think it\r\nadvisable not to specify,\" and have provided that \"every such\r\ncertificate shall be deemed a sufficient voucher for the sum or sums\r\ntherein expressed to have been expended.\"\r\n\r\nThe law making these provisions is in full force. It is binding upon all\r\nthe departments of the Government, and especially upon the Executive,\r\nwhose duty it is \"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" In\r\nthe exercise of the discretion lodged by it in the Executive several of\r\nmy predecessors have made \"certificates\" of the amount \"of such\r\nexpenditures as they have thought it advisable not to specify,\" and upon\r\nthese certificates as the only vouchers settlements have been made at\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nIt appears that within the period specified in the resolution of the\r\nHouse certificates were given by my immediate predecessor, upon which\r\nsettlements have been made at the Treasury, amounting to $5,460. He has\r\nsolemnly determined that the objects and items of these expenditures\r\nshould not be made public, and has given his certificates to that\r\neffect, which are placed upon the records of the country. Under the\r\ndirect authority of an existing law, he has exercised the power of\r\nplacing these expenditures under the seal of confidence, and the whole\r\nmatter was terminated before I came into office. An important question\r\narises, whether a subsequent President, either voluntarily or at the\r\nrequest of one branch of Congress, can without a violation of the spirit\r\nof the law revise the acts of his predecessor and expose to public view\r\nthat which he had determined should not be \"made public.\" If not a\r\nmatter of strict duty, it would certainly be a safe general rule that\r\nthis should not be done. Indeed, it may well happen, and probably would\r\nhappen, that the President for the time being would not be in possession\r\nof the information upon which his predecessor acted, and could not,\r\ntherefore, have the means of judging whether he had exercised his\r\ndiscretion wisely or not. The law requires no other voucher but the\r\nPresident's certificate, and there is nothing in its provisions which\r\nrequires any \"entries, receipts, letters, vouchers, memorandums, or\r\nother evidence of such payments\" to be preserved in the executive\r\ndepartment. The President who makes the \"certificate\" may, if he\r\nchooses, keep all the information and evidence upon which he acts in his\r\nown possession. If, for the information of his successors, he shall\r\nleave the evidence on which he acts and the items of the expenditures\r\nwhich make up the sum for which he has given his \"certificate\" on the\r\nconfidential files of one of the Executive Departments, they do not in\r\nany proper sense become thereby public records. They are never seen or\r\nexamined by the accounting officers of the Treasury when they settle an\r\naccount on the \"President's certificate.\" The First Congress of the\r\nUnited States on the 1st of July, 1790, passed an act \"providing the\r\nmeans of intercourse between the United States and foreign nations,\" by\r\nwhich a similar provision to that which now exists was made for the\r\nsettlement of such expenditures as in the judgment of the President\r\nought not to be made public. This act was limited in its duration. It\r\nwas continued for a limited term in 1793, and between that time and the\r\ndate of the act of May 1, 1810, which is now in force, the same\r\nprovision was revived and continued. Expenditures were made and settled\r\nunder Presidential certificates in pursuance of these laws.\r\n\r\nIf the President may answer the present call, he must answer similar\r\ncalls for every such expenditure of a confidential character, made under\r\nevery Administration, in war and in peace, from the organization of the\r\nGovernment to the present period. To break the seal of confidence\r\nimposed by the law, and heretofore uniformly preserved, would be\r\nsubversive of the very purpose for which the law was enacted, and might\r\nbe productive of the most disastrous consequences. The expenditures of\r\nthis confidential character, it is believed, were never before sought to\r\nbe made public, and I should greatly apprehend the consequences of\r\nestablishing a precedent which would render such disclosures hereafter\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nI am fully aware of the strong and correct public feeling which exists\r\nthroughout the country against secrecy of any kind in the administration\r\nof the Government, and especially in reference to public expenditures;\r\nyet our foreign negotiations are wisely and properly confined to the\r\nknowledge of the Executive during their pendency. Our laws require the\r\naccounts of every particular expenditure to be rendered and publicly\r\nsettled at the Treasury Department. The single exception which exists is\r\nnot that the amounts embraced under President's certificates shall be\r\nwithheld from the public, but merely that the items of which these are\r\ncomposed shall not be divulged. To this extent, and no further, is\r\nsecrecy observed.\r\n\r\nThe laudable vigilance of the people in regard to all the expenditures\r\nof the Government, as well as a sense of duty on the part of the\r\nPresident and a desire to retain the good opinion of his\r\nfellow-citizens, will prevent any sum expended from being accounted for\r\nby the President's certificate unless in cases of urgent necessity. Such\r\ncertificates have therefore been resorted to but seldom throughout our\r\npast history.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I have not caused any account whatever to be settled on\r\na Presidential certificate. I have had no occasion rendering it\r\nnecessary in my judgment to make such a certificate, and it would be an\r\nextreme case which would ever induce me to exercise this authority; yet\r\nif such a case should arise it would be my duty to assume the\r\nresponsibility devolved on me by the law.\r\n\r\nDuring my Administration all expenditures for contingent expenses of\r\nforeign intercourse in which the accounts have been closed have been\r\nsettled upon regular vouchers, as all other public accounts are settled\r\nat the Treasury.\r\n\r\nIt may be alleged that the power of impeachment belongs to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and that, with a view to the exercise of this power,\r\nthat House has the right to investigate the conduct of all public\r\nofficers under the Government. This is cheerfully admitted. In such a\r\ncase the safety of the Republic would be the supreme law, and the power\r\nof the House in the pursuit of this object would penetrate into the most\r\nsecret recesses of the Executive Departments. It could command the\r\nattendance of any and every agent of the Government, and compel them to\r\nproduce all papers, public or private, official or unofficial, and to\r\ntestify on oath to all facts within their knowledge. But even in a case\r\nof that kind they would adopt all wise precautions to prevent the\r\nexposure of all such matters the publication of which might injuriously\r\naffect the public interest, except so far as this might be necessary to\r\naccomplish the great ends of public justice. If the House of\r\nRepresentatives, as the grand inquest of the nation, should at any time\r\nhave reason to believe that there has been malversation in office by an\r\nimproper use or application of the public money by a public officer, and\r\nshould think proper to institute an inquiry into the matter, all the\r\narchives and papers of the Executive Departments, public or private,\r\nwould be subject to the inspection and control of a committee of their\r\nbody and every facility in the power of the Executive be afforded to\r\nenable them to prosecute the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe experience of every nation on earth has demonstrated that\r\nemergencies may arise in which it becomes absolutely necessary for the\r\npublic safety or the public good to make expenditures the very object of\r\nwhich would be defeated by publicity. Some governments have very large\r\namounts at their disposal, and have made vastly greater expenditures\r\nthan the small amounts which have from time to time been accounted for\r\non President's certificates. In no nation is the application of such\r\nsums ever made public. In time of war or impending danger the situation\r\nof the country may make it necessary to employ individuals for the\r\npurpose of obtaining information or rendering other important services\r\nwho could never be prevailed upon to act if they entertained the least\r\napprehension that their names or their agency would in any contingency\r\nbe divulged. So it may often become necessary to incur an expenditure\r\nfor an object highly useful to the country; for example, the conclusion\r\nof a treaty with a barbarian power whose customs require on such\r\noccasions the use of presents. But this object might be altogether\r\ndefeated by the intrigues of other powers if our purposes were to be\r\nmade known by the exhibition of the original papers and vouchers to the\r\naccounting officers of the Treasury. It would be easy to specify other\r\ncases which may occur in the history of a great nation, in its\r\nintercourse with other nations, wherein it might become absolutely\r\nnecessary to incur expenditures for objects which could never be\r\naccomplished if it were suspected in advance that the items of\r\nexpenditure and the agencies employed would be made public.\r\n\r\nActuated undoubtedly by considerations of this kind, Congress provided\r\nsuch a fund, coeval with the organization of the Government, and\r\nsubsequently enacted the law of 1810 as the permanent law of the land.\r\nWhile this law exists in full force I feel bound by a high sense of\r\npublic policy and duty to observe its provisions and the uniform\r\npractice of my predecessors under it.\r\n\r\nWith great respect for the House of Representatives and an anxious\r\ndesire to conform to their wishes, I am constrained to come to this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nIf Congress disapprove the policy of the law, they may repeal its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nIn reply to that portion of the resolution of the House which calls for\r\n\"copies of whatever communications were made from the Secretary of State\r\nduring the last session of the Twenty-seventh Congress, particularly\r\nFebruary, 1843, to Mr. Cushing and Mr. Adams, members of the Committee\r\nof this House on Foreign Affairs, of the wish of the President of the\r\nUnited States to institute a special mission to Great Britain,\" I have\r\nto state that no such communications or copies of them are found in the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\n\"Copies of all letters on the books of the Department of State to any\r\nofficer of the United States or any person in New York concerning\r\nAlexander McLeod,\" which are also called for by the resolution, are\r\nherewith communicated.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 11, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe existing state of the relations between the United States and Mexico\r\nrenders it proper that I should bring the subject to the consideration\r\nof Congress. In my message at the commencement of your present session\r\nthe state of these relations, the causes which led to the suspension of\r\ndiplomatic intercourse between the two countries in March, 1845, and the\r\nlong-continued and unredressed wrongs and injuries committed by the\r\nMexican Government on citizens of the United States in their persons and\r\nproperty were briefly set forth.\r\n\r\nAs the facts and opinions which were then laid before you were carefully\r\nconsidered, I can not better express my present convictions of the\r\ncondition of affairs up to that time than by referring you to that\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThe strong desire to establish peace with Mexico on liberal and\r\nhonorable terms, and the readiness of this Government to regulate and\r\nadjust our boundary and other causes of difference with that power on\r\nsuch fair and equitable principles as would lead to permanent relations\r\nof the most friendly nature, induced me in September last to seek the\r\nreopening of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Every\r\nmeasure adopted on our part had for its object the furtherance of these\r\ndesired results. In communicating to Congress a succinct statement of\r\nthe injuries which we had suffered from Mexico, and which have been\r\naccumulating during a period of more than twenty years, every expression\r\nthat could tend to inflame the people of Mexico or defeat or delay a\r\npacific result was carefully avoided. An envoy of the United States\r\nrepaired to Mexico with full powers to adjust every existing difference.\r\nBut though present on the Mexican soil by agreement between the two\r\nGovernments, invested with full powers, and bearing evidence of the most\r\nfriendly dispositions, his mission has been unavailing. The Mexican\r\nGovernment not only refused to receive him or listen to his\r\npropositions, but after a long-continued series of menaces have at last\r\ninvaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our\r\nown soil.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes my duty to state more in detail the origin, progress, and\r\nfailure of that mission. In pursuance of the instructions given in\r\nSeptember last, an inquiry was made on the 13th of October, 1845, in the\r\nmost friendly terms, through our consul in Mexico, of the minister for\r\nforeign affairs, whether the Mexican Government \"would receive an envoy\r\nfrom the United States intrusted with full powers to adjust all the\r\nquestions in dispute between the two Governments,\" with the assurance\r\nthat \"should the answer be in the affirmative such an envoy would be\r\nimmediately dispatched to Mexico.\" The Mexican minister on the 15th of\r\nOctober gave an affirmative answer to this inquiry, requesting at the\r\nsame time that our naval force at Vera Cruz might be withdrawn, lest its\r\ncontinued presence might assume the appearance of menace and coercion\r\npending the negotiations. This force was immediately withdrawn. On the\r\n10th of November, 1845, Mr. John Slidell, of Louisiana, was commissioned\r\nby me as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates to Mexico, and was intrusted with full powers to adjust both the\r\nquestions of the Texas boundary and of indemnification to our citizens.\r\nThe redress of the wrongs of our citizens naturally and inseparably\r\nblended itself with the question of boundary. The settlement of the one\r\nquestion in any correct view of the subject involves that of the other.\r\nI could not for a moment entertain the idea that the claims of our\r\nmuch-injured and long-suffering citizens, many of which had existed for\r\nmore than twenty years, should be postponed or separated from the\r\nsettlement of the boundary question.\r\n\r\nMr. Slidell arrived at Vera Cruz on the 30th of November, and was\r\ncourteously received by the authorities of that city. But the Government\r\nof General Herrera was then tottering to its fall. The revolutionary\r\nparty had seized upon the Texas question to effect or hasten its\r\noverthrow. Its determination to restore friendly relations with the\r\nUnited States, and to receive our minister to negotiate for the\r\nsettlement of this question, was violently assailed, and was made the\r\ngreat theme of denunciation against it. The Government of General\r\nHerrera, there is good reason to believe, was sincerely desirous to\r\nreceive our minister; but it yielded to the storm raised by its enemies,\r\nand on the 21st of December refused to accredit Mr. Slidell upon the\r\nmost frivolous pretexts. These are so fully and ably exposed in the note\r\nof Mr. Slidell of the 24th of December last to the Mexican minister of\r\nforeign relations, herewith transmitted, that I deem it unnecessary to\r\nenter into further detail on this portion of the subject.\r\n\r\nFive days after the date of Mr. Slidell's note General Herrera yielded\r\nthe Government to General Paredes without a struggle, and on the 30th of\r\nDecember resigned the Presidency. This revolution was accomplished\r\nsolely by the army, the people having taken little part in the contest;\r\nand thus the supreme power in Mexico passed into the hands of a military\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nDetermined to leave no effort untried to effect an amicable adjustment\r\nwith Mexico, I directed Mr. Slidell to present his credentials to the\r\nGovernment of General Paredes and ask to be officially received by him.\r\nThere would have been less ground for taking this step had General\r\nParedes come into power by a regular constitutional succession. In that\r\nevent his administration would have been considered but a mere\r\nconstitutional continuance of the Government of General Herrera, and the\r\nrefusal of the latter to receive our minister would have been deemed\r\nconclusive unless an intimation had been given by General Paredes of his\r\ndesire to reverse the decision of his predecessor. But the Government of\r\nGeneral Paredes owes its existence to a military revolution, by which\r\nthe subsisting constitutional authorities had been subverted. The form\r\nof government was entirely changed, as well as all the high\r\nfunctionaries by whom it was administered.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Mr. Slidell, in obedience to my direction,\r\naddressed a note to the Mexican minister of foreign relations, under\r\ndate of the 1st of March last, asking to be received by that Government\r\nin the diplomatic character to which he had been appointed. This\r\nminister in his reply, under date of the 12th of March, reiterated the\r\narguments of his predecessor, and in terms that may be considered as\r\ngiving just grounds of offense to the Government and people of the\r\nUnited States denied the application of Mr. Slidell. Nothing therefore\r\nremained for our envoy but to demand his passports and return to his own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThus the Government of Mexico, though solemnly pledged by official acts\r\nin October last to receive and accredit an American envoy, violated\r\ntheir plighted faith and refused the offer of a peaceful adjustment of\r\nour difficulties. Not only was the offer rejected, but the indignity of\r\nits rejection was enhanced by the manifest breach of faith in refusing\r\nto admit the envoy who came because they had bound themselves to receive\r\nhim. Nor can it be said that the offer was fruitless from the want of\r\nopportunity of discussing it; our envoy was present on their own soil.\r\nNor can it be ascribed to a want of sufficient powers; our envoy had\r\nfull powers to adjust every question of difference. Nor was there room\r\nfor complaint that our propositions for settlement were unreasonable;\r\npermission was not even given our envoy to make any proposition\r\nwhatever. Nor can it be objected that we, on our part, would not listen\r\nto any reasonable terms of their suggestion; the Mexican Government\r\nrefused all negotiation, and have made no proposition of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn my message at the commencement of the present session I informed you\r\nthat upon the earnest appeal both of the Congress and convention of\r\nTexas I had ordered an efficient military force to take a position\r\n\"between the Nueces and the Del Norte.\" This had become necessary to\r\nmeet a threatened invasion of Texas by the Mexican forces, for which\r\nextensive military preparations had been made. The invasion was\r\nthreatened solely because Texas had determined, in accordance with a\r\nsolemn resolution of the Congress of the United States, to annex herself\r\nto our Union, and under these circumstances it was plainly our duty to\r\nextend our protection over her citizens and soil.\r\n\r\nThis force was concentrated at Corpus Christi, and remained there until\r\nafter I had received such information from Mexico as rendered it\r\nprobable, if not certain, that the Mexican Government would refuse to\r\nreceive our envoy.\r\n\r\nMeantime Texas, by the final action of our Congress, had become an\r\nintegral part of our Union. The Congress of Texas, by its act of\r\nDecember 19, 1836, had declared the Rio del Norte to be the boundary of\r\nthat Republic. Its jurisdiction had been extended and exercised beyond\r\nthe Nueces. The country between that river and the Del Norte had been\r\nrepresented in the Congress and in the convention of Texas, had thus\r\ntaken part in the act of annexation itself, and is now included within\r\none of our Congressional districts. Our own Congress had, moreover, with\r\ngreat unanimity, by the act approved December 31, 1845, recognized the\r\ncountry beyond the Nueces as a part of our territory by including it\r\nwithin our own revenue system, and a revenue officer to reside within\r\nthat district has been appointed by and with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate. It became, therefore, of urgent necessity to provide for the\r\ndefense of that portion of our country. Accordingly, on the 13th of\r\nJanuary last instructions were issued to the general in command of these\r\ntroops to occupy the left bank of the Del Norte. This river, which is\r\nthe southwestern boundary of the State of Texas, is an exposed frontier.\r\nFrom this quarter invasion was threatened; upon it and in its immediate\r\nvicinity, in the judgment of high military experience, are the proper\r\nstations for the protecting forces of the Government. In addition to\r\nthis important consideration, several others occurred to induce this\r\nmovement. Among these are the facilities afforded by the ports at Brazos\r\nSantiago and the mouth of the Del Norte for the reception of supplies by\r\nsea, the stronger and more healthful military positions, the convenience\r\nfor obtaining a ready and a more abundant supply of provisions, water,\r\nfuel, and forage, and the advantages which are afforded by the Del Norte\r\nin forwarding supplies to such posts as may be established in the\r\ninterior and upon the Indian frontier.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the troops to the Del Norte was made by the commanding\r\ngeneral under positive instructions to abstain from all aggressive acts\r\ntoward Mexico or Mexican citizens and to regard the relations between\r\nthat Republic and the United States as peaceful unless she should\r\ndeclare war or commit acts of hostility indicative of a state of war. He\r\nwas specially directed to protect private property and respect personal\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe Army moved from Corpus Christi on the 11th of March, and on the 28th\r\nof that month arrived on the left bank of the Del Norte opposite to\r\nMatamoras, where it encamped on a commanding position, which has since\r\nbeen strengthened by the erection of fieldworks. A depot has also been\r\nestablished at Point Isabel, near the Brazos Santiago, 30 miles in rear\r\nof the encampment. The selection of his position was necessarily\r\nconfided to the judgment of the general in command.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican forces at Matamoras assumed a belligerent attitude, and on\r\nthe 12th of April General Ampudia, then in command, notified General\r\nTaylor to break up his camp within twenty-four hours and to retire\r\nbeyond the Nueces River, and in the event of his failure to comply with\r\nthese demands announced that arms, and arms alone, must decide the\r\nquestion. But no open act of hostility was committed until the 24th of\r\nApril. On that day General Arista, who had succeeded to the command of\r\nthe Mexican forces, communicated to General Taylor that \"he considered\r\nhostilities commenced and should prosecute them.\" A party of dragoons of\r\n63 men and officers were on the same day dispatched from the American\r\ncamp up the Rio del Norte, on its left bank, to ascertain whether the\r\nMexican troops had crossed or were preparing to cross the river, \"became\r\nengaged with a large body of these troops, and after a short affair, in\r\nwhich some 16 were killed and wounded, appear to have been surrounded\r\nand compelled to surrender.\"\r\n\r\nThe grievous wrongs perpetrated by Mexico upon our citizens throughout a\r\nlong period of years remain unredressed, and solemn treaties pledging\r\nher public faith for this redress have been disregarded. A government\r\neither unable or unwilling to enforce the execution of such treaties\r\nfails to perform one of its plainest duties.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with Mexico has been almost annihilated. It was formerly\r\nhighly beneficial to both nations, but our merchants have been deterred\r\nfrom prosecuting it by the system of outrage and extortion which the\r\nMexican authorities have pursued against them, whilst their appeals\r\nthrough their own Government for indemnity have been made in vain. Our\r\nforbearance has gone to such an extreme as to be mistaken in its\r\ncharacter. Had we acted with vigor in repelling the insults and\r\nredressing the injuries inflicted by Mexico at the commencement, we\r\nshould doubtless have escaped all the difficulties in which we are now\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nInstead of this, however, we have been exerting our best efforts to\r\npropitiate her good will. Upon the pretext that Texas, a nation as\r\nindependent as herself, thought proper to unite its destinies with our\r\nown, she has affected to believe that we have severed her rightful\r\nterritory, and in official proclamations and manifestoes has repeatedly\r\nthreatened to make war upon us for the purpose of reconquering Texas. In\r\nthe meantime we have tried every effort at reconciliation. The cup of\r\nforbearance had been exhausted even before the recent information from\r\nthe frontier of the Del Norte. But now, after reiterated menaces, Mexico\r\nhas passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory\r\nand shed American blood upon the American soil. She has proclaimed that\r\nhostilities have commenced, and that the two nations are now at war.\r\n\r\nAs war exists, and, notwithstanding all our efforts to avoid it, exists\r\nby the act of Mexico herself, we are called upon by every consideration\r\nof duty and patriotism to vindicate with decision the honor, the rights,\r\nand the interests of our country.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the possibility of a crisis like that which has arrived,\r\ninstructions were given in August last, \"as a precautionary measure\"\r\nagainst invasion or threatened invasion, authorizing General Taylor, if\r\nthe emergency required, to accept volunteers, not from Texas only, but\r\nfrom the States of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and\r\nKentucky, and corresponding letters were addressed to the respective\r\ngovernors of those States. These instructions were repeated, and in\r\nJanuary last, soon after the incorporation of \"Texas into our Union of\r\nStates,\" General Taylor was further \"authorized by the President to make\r\na requisition upon the executive of that State for such of its militia\r\nforce as may be needed to repel invasion or to secure the country\r\nagainst apprehended invasion.\" On the 2d day of March he was again\r\nreminded, \"in the event of the approach of any considerable Mexican\r\nforce, promptly and efficiently to use the authority with which he was\r\nclothed to call to him such auxiliary force as he might need.\" War\r\nactually existing and our territory having been invaded, General Taylor,\r\npursuant to authority vested in him by my direction, has called on the\r\ngovernor of Texas for four regiments of State troops, two to be mounted\r\nand two to serve on foot, and on the governor of Louisiana for four\r\nregiments of infantry to be sent to him as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\nIn further vindication of our rights and defense of our territory, I\r\ninvoke the prompt action of Congress to recognize the existence of the\r\nwar, and to place at the disposition of the Executive the means of\r\nprosecuting the war with vigor, and thus hastening the restoration of\r\npeace. To this end I recommend that authority should be given to call\r\ninto the public service a large body of volunteers to serve for not less\r\nthan six or twelve months unless sooner discharged. A volunteer force is\r\nbeyond question more efficient than any other description of citizen\r\nsoldiers, and it is not to be doubted that a number far beyond that\r\nrequired would readily rush to the field upon the call of their country.\r\nI further recommend that a liberal provision be made for sustaining our\r\nentire military force and furnishing it with supplies and munitions of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe most energetic and prompt measures and the immediate appearance in\r\narms of a large and overpowering force are recommended to Congress as\r\nthe most certain and efficient means of bringing the existing collision\r\nwith Mexico to a speedy and successful termination.\r\n\r\nIn making these recommendations I deem it proper to declare that it is\r\nmy anxious desire not only to terminate hostilities speedily, but to\r\nbring all matters in dispute between this Government and Mexico to an\r\nearly and amicable adjustment; and in this view I shall be prepared to\r\nrenew negotiations whenever Mexico shall be ready to receive\r\npropositions or to make propositions of her own.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a copy of the correspondence between our envoy to\r\nMexico and the Mexican minister for foreign affairs, and so much of the\r\ncorrespondence between that envoy and the Secretary of State and between\r\nthe Secretary of War and the general in command on the Del Norte as is\r\nnecessary to a full understanding of the subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 12, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to Congress a copy of a communication[7] from the\r\nofficer commanding the Army in Texas, with the papers which accompanied\r\nit. They were received by the Southern mail of yesterday, some hours\r\nafter my message of that date had been transmitted, and are of a prior\r\ndate to one of the communications from the same officer which\r\naccompanied that message.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Relating to the operations of the Army near Matamoras,\r\nMexico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 19, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, in answer to a\r\nresolution of the Senate of the 4th of December last, which contains the\r\ninformation called for \"with respect to the practicability and utility\r\nof a fort or forts on Ship Island, on the coast of Mississippi, with a\r\nview to the protection of said coast.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 26, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA convention was concluded at Lima on 17th March, 1841, between the\r\nUnited States and the Republic of Peru, for the adjustment of claims\r\nof our citizens upon that Republic. It was stipulated by the seventh\r\narticle of this convention that \"it shall be ratified by the contracting\r\nparties, and the ratifications shall be exchanged within two years from\r\nits date, or sooner if possible, after having been approved by the\r\nPresident and Senate of the United States and by the Congress of Peru.\"\r\n\r\nThis convention was transmitted by the President to the Senate for their\r\nconsideration during the extra session of 1841, but it did not receive\r\ntheir approbation until the 5th January, 1843. This delay rendered it\r\nimpracticable that the convention should reach Lima before the 17th\r\nMarch, 1843, the last day when the ratifications could be exchanged\r\nunder the terms of its seventh article. The Senate therefore extended\r\nthe time for this purpose until the 20th December, 1843.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, previous to the 17th March, 1843, General Menendez,\r\nthe constitutional President of Peru, had ratified the convention,\r\ndeclaring, however, in the act of ratification itself (which is without\r\ndate), that \"the present convention and ratification are to be submitted\r\nwithin the time stipulated in the seventh article for the final\r\napprobation of the National Congress.\" This was, however, rendered\r\nimpossible from the fact that no Peruvian Congress assembled from the\r\ndate of the convention until the year 1845.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention arrived at Lima General Menendez had been deposed\r\nby a revolution, and General Vivanco had placed himself at the head of\r\nthe Government. On the 16th July, 1843, the convention was ratified\r\nby him in absolute terms without the reference to Congress which the\r\nconstitution of Peru requires, because, as the ratification states,\r\n\"under existing circumstances the Government exercises the legislative\r\npowers demanded by the necessities of the State.\" The ratifications were\r\naccordingly exchanged at Lima on the 22d July, 1843, and the convention\r\nitself was proclaimed at Washington by the President on the 21st day of\r\nFebruary, 1844.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime General Vivanco was deposed, and on the 12th October,\r\n1843, the Government then in existence published a decree declaring all\r\nhis administrative acts to be null and void, and notwithstanding the\r\nearnest and able remonstrances of Mr. Pickett, our chargé d'affaires at\r\nLima, the Peruvian Government have still persisted in declaring that the\r\nratification of the convention by Vivanco was invalid.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting of the Peruvian Congress in 1845 the convention was\r\nsubmitted to that body, by which it was approved on the 21st of October\r\nlast, \"with the condition, however, that the first installment of\r\n$30,000 on account of the principal of the debt thereby recognized, and\r\nto which the second article relates, should begin from the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, 1846, and the interest on this annual sum, according to article\r\n3, should be calculated and paid from the 1st day of January, 1842,\r\nfollowing in all other respects besides this modification the terms of\r\nthe convention.\"\r\n\r\nI am not in possession of the act of the Congress of Peru containing\r\nthis provision, but the information is communicated through a note under\r\ndate of the 15th of November, 1845, from the minister of foreign affairs\r\nof Peru to the chargé d'affaires of the United States at Lima. A copy of\r\nthis note has been transmitted to the Department of State both by our\r\nchargé d'affaires at Lima and by the Peruvian minister of foreign\r\naffairs, and a copy of the same is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I submit to the Senate, for their\r\nconsideration, the amendment to the convention thus proposed by the\r\nCongress of Peru, with a view to its ratification. It would have been\r\nmore satisfactory to have submitted the act itself of the Peruvian\r\nCongress, but, on account of the great distance, if I should wait until\r\nits arrival another year might be consumed, whilst the American\r\nclaimants have already been too long delayed in receiving the money\r\njustly due to them. Several of the largest of these claimants would,\r\nI am informed, be satisfied with the modification of the convention\r\nadopted by the Peruvian Congress.\r\n\r\nA difficulty may arise in regard to the form of any proceeding which the\r\nSenate might think proper to adopt, from the fact that the original\r\nconvention approved by them was sent to Peru and was exchanged for the\r\nother original, ratified by General Vivanco, which is now in the\r\nDepartment of State. In order to obviate this difficulty as far as may\r\nbe in my power, I transmit a copy of the convention, under the seal of\r\nthe United States, on which the Senate might found any action they may\r\ndeem advisable.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that should the Senate advise the adoption of the\r\namendment proposed by the Peruvian Congress the time for exchanging the\r\nratifications of the amended convention ought to be extended for a\r\nconsiderable period, so as to provide against all accidents in its\r\ntransmission to Lima.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 27, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request contained in the resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives of this date, I transmit copies of all the official\r\ndispatches which have been received from General Taylor, commanding the\r\narmy of occupation on the Rio Grande, relating to the battles[8] of the\r\n8th and 9th instant.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 28, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a note, under date the 26th instant, from the envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Her Britannic Majesty to\r\nthe Secretary of State, communicating a dispatch, under date of the 4th\r\ninstant, received by him from Her Majesty's principal secretary of state\r\nfor foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nFrom these it will be seen that the claims of the two Governments upon\r\neach other for a return of duties which had been levied in violation of\r\nthe commercial convention of 1815 have been finally and satisfactorily\r\nadjusted. In making this communication I deem it proper to express my\r\nsatisfaction at the prompt manner in which the British Government has\r\nacceded to the suggestion of the Secretary of State for the speedy\r\ntermination of this affair.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 1, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI propose, for the reason stated in the accompanying communication of\r\nthe Secretary of War, that the confirmation of Brevet Second Lieutenant\r\nL.B. Wood by the Senate on the 5th of February, as a second lieutenant\r\nin the Fifth Regiment of Infantry, be canceled; and I nominate the\r\nofficers named in the same communication for regular promotion in the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _May 15, 1846_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: On the 12th of December last a list of promotions and appointments\r\nof officers of the Army was submitted to the Senate for confirmation, in\r\nwhich list Brevet Second Lieutenant L.B. Wood, of the Eighth Infantry,\r\nwas nominated to the grade of second lieutenant in the Fifth Regiment of\r\nInfantry, _vice_ Second Lieutenant Deas, promoted. He was entitled to\r\nthis vacancy by _seniority_, but in a letter dated November 30, 1845,\r\nand received at the Adjutant-General's Office December 30, 1845\r\n(eighteen days _after_ the list referred to above had been sent to the\r\nSenate), he says: \"I respectfully beg leave to be permitted to decline\r\npromotion in any other regiment, and to fill the first vacancy which may\r\nhappen in the Eighth.\" This request was acceded to, and accordingly, on\r\nthe first subsequent list submitted to the Senate, dated January 8,\r\n1846, Brevet Second Lieutenant Charles S. Hamilton, of the Second\r\nInfantry (the next below Lieutenant Wood), was nominated to fill the\r\nvacancy in the _Fifth_ Regiment and Lieutenant Wood to a vacancy which\r\nhas occurred meanwhile (December 31) in the _Eighth_.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing circumstances were explained in a note to the nomination\r\nlist of January 8, but it is probable the explanation escaped\r\nobservation in the Senate, as on the 5th of February Lieutenant Wood was\r\nconfirmed in the Fifth Infantry, agreeably to the first nomination,\r\nwhile no action appears to have been taken on his nomination or that of\r\nLieutenant Hamilton on the subsequent list of January 8, 1846.\r\n\r\nAs no commissions have yet been issued to these officers, and as\r\nLieutenant Wood has renewed his application to be continued in the\r\nEighth Infantry, I respectfully suggest that the Senate be requested to\r\ncancel their confirmation, on the 5th of February, of his promotion as a\r\nsecond lieutenant in the Fifth Regiment of Infantry; and I have the\r\nhonor to propose the renomination of the lieutenants whose names are\r\nannexed for regular promotion, to wit:\r\n\r\n_Fifth Regiment of Infantry._\r\n\r\nBrevet Second Lieutenant Charles S. Hamilton, of the Second Regiment\r\nof Infantry, to be second lieutenant, November 17, 1846, _vice_ Deas,\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\n_Eighth Regiment of Infantry._\r\n\r\nBrevet Second Lieutenant Lafayette B. Wood to be second lieutenant,\r\nDecember 31, 1846, _vice_ Maclay, promoted.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L. MARCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 5, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 22d ultimo, calling for\r\ninformation upon the subject of the treaties which were concluded\r\nbetween the late Republic of Texas and England and France, respectively,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents by\r\nwhich it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 6, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolutions of the Senate of the 10th, 11th, and 22d of\r\nApril last, I communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of State,\r\naccompanied with the correspondence between the Government of the United\r\nStates and that of Great Britain in the years 1840, 1841, 1842, and 1843\r\nrespecting the right or practice of visiting or searching merchant\r\nvessels in time of peace, and also the protest addressed by the minister\r\nof the United States at Paris in the year 1842 against the concurrence\r\nof France in the quintuple treaty, together with all correspondence\r\nrelating thereto.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 6, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate, for its consideration, a\r\nconvention signed on the 2d day of May, 1846, by the minister of the\r\nUnited States at Berlin with the plenipotentiary of Hesse-Cassel, for\r\nthe mutual abolition of the _droit d'aubaine_ and duties on emigration\r\nbetween that German State and the United States; and I communicate with\r\nthe convention an explanatory dispatch of the minister of the United\r\nStates dated on the same day of the present year and numbered 284.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 8, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of War, transmitting\r\nthe correspondence called for by the resolution of the Senate of the 5th\r\ninstant with General Edmund P. Gaines and General Winfield Scott, of the\r\nArmy of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying correspondence\r\nwith General Gaines contain all the information in my possession in\r\nrelation to calls for \"volunteers or militia into the service of the\r\nUnited States\" \"by any officer of the Army\" without legal \"authority\r\ntherefor,\" and of the \"measures which have been adopted\" \"in relation\r\nto such officer or troops so called into service.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the information contained in the report of the Secretary\r\nof War and the accompanying correspondence with \"Major-General Scott, of\r\nthe United States Army, upon the subject of his taking the command of\r\nthe army of occupation on the frontier of Texas,\" I state that on the\r\nsame day on which I approved and signed the act of the 13th of May,\r\n1846, entitled \"An act providing for the prosecution of the existing war\r\nbetween the United States and the Republic of Mexico,\" I communicated to\r\nGeneral Scott, through the Secretary of War, and also in a personal\r\ninterview with that officer, my desire that he should take command of\r\nthe Army on the Rio Grande and of the volunteer forces which I informed\r\nhim it was my intention forthwith to call out to march to that frontier\r\nto be employed in the prosecution of the war against Mexico. The tender\r\nof the command to General Scott was voluntary on my part, and was made\r\nwithout any request or intimation on the subject from him. It was made\r\nin consideration of his rank as Commander in Chief of the Army. My\r\ncommunications with General Scott assigning him the command were verbal,\r\nfirst through the Secretary of War and afterwards in person. No written\r\norder was deemed to be necessary. General Scott assented to assume the\r\ncommand, and on the following day I had another interview with him and\r\nthe Secretary of War, in relation to the number and apportionment among\r\nthe several States of the volunteer forces to be called out for\r\nimmediate service, the forces which were to be organized and held in\r\nreadiness subject to a future call should it become necessary, and other\r\nmilitary preparations and movements to be made with a view to the\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war. It was distinctly settled, and was well\r\nunderstood by General Scott, that he was to command the Army in the war\r\nagainst Mexico, and so continued to be settled and understood without\r\nany other intention on my part until the Secretary of War submitted to\r\nme the letter of General Scott addressed to him under date of the 21st\r\nof May, 1846, a copy of which is herewith communicated. The character of\r\nthat letter made it proper, in my judgment, to change my determination\r\nin regard to the command of the Army, and the Secretary of War, by my\r\ndirection, in his letter of the 25th of May, 1846, a copy of which is\r\nalso herewith communicated, for the reasons therein assigned, informed\r\nGeneral Scott that he was relieved from the command of the Army destined\r\nto prosecute the war against Mexico, and that he would remain in the\r\ndischarge of his duties at Washington. The command of the Army on the\r\nfrontier of Mexico has since been assigned to General Taylor, with his\r\nbrevet rank of major-general recently conferred upon him.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 10, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate a proposal, in the form of a convention,\r\npresented to the Secretary of State on the 6th instant by the envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Her Britannic Majesty, for\r\nthe adjustment of the Oregon question, together with a protocol of this\r\nproceeding. I submit this proposal to the consideration of the Senate,\r\nand request their advice as to the action which in their judgment it may\r\nbe proper to take in reference to it.\r\n\r\nIn the early periods of the Government the opinion and advice of the\r\nSenate were often taken in advance upon important questions of our\r\nforeign policy. General Washington repeatedly consulted the Senate and\r\nasked their previous advice upon pending negotiations with foreign\r\npowers, and the Senate in every instance responded to his call by giving\r\ntheir advice, to which he always conformed his action. This practice,\r\nthough rarely resorted to in later times, was, in my judgment, eminently\r\nwise, and may on occasions of great importance be properly revived. The\r\nSenate are a branch of the treaty-making power, and by consulting them\r\nin advance of his own action upon important measures of foreign policy\r\nwhich may ultimately come before them for their consideration the\r\nPresident secures harmony of action between that body and himself. The\r\nSenate are, moreover, a branch of the war-making power, and it may be\r\neminently proper for the Executive to take the opinion and advice of\r\nthat body in advance upon any great question which may involve in its\r\ndecision the issue of peace or war. On the present occasion the\r\nmagnitude of the subject would induce me under any circumstances to\r\ndesire the previous advice of the Senate, and that desire is increased\r\nby the recent debates and proceedings in Congress, which render it, in\r\nmy judgment, not only respectful to the Senate, but necessary and\r\nproper, if not indispensable to insure harmonious action between that\r\nbody and the Executive. In conferring on the Executive the authority to\r\ngive the notice for the abrogation of the convention of 1827 the Senate\r\nacted publicly so large a part that a decision on the proposal now made\r\nby the British Government, without a definite knowledge of the views of\r\nthat body in reference to it, might render the question still more\r\ncomplicated and difficult of adjustment. For these reasons I invite the\r\nconsideration of the Senate to the proposal of the British Government\r\nfor the settlement of the Oregon question, and ask their advice on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMy opinions and my action on the Oregon question were fully made known\r\nto Congress in my annual message of the 2d of December last, and the\r\nopinions therein expressed remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nShould the Senate, by the constitutional majority required for the\r\nratification of treaties, advise the acceptance of this proposition, or\r\nadvise it with such modifications as they may upon full deliberation\r\ndeem proper, I shall conform my action to their advice. Should the\r\nSenate, however, decline by such constitutional majority to give such\r\nadvice or to express an opinion on the subject, I shall consider it my\r\nduty to reject the offer.\r\n\r\nI also communicate herewith an extract from a dispatch of the Secretary\r\nof State to the minister of the United States at London under date of\r\nthe 28th of April last, directing him, in accordance with the joint\r\nresolution of Congress \"concerning the Oregon Territory,\" to deliver the\r\nnotice to the British Government for the abrogation of the convention of\r\nthe 6th of August, 1827, and also a copy of the notice transmitted to\r\nhim for that purpose, together with extracts from a dispatch of that\r\nminister to the Secretary of State bearing date on the 18th day of May\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 15, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of War,\r\naccompanied by a report of an expedition led by Lieutenant Abert on the\r\nUpper Arkansas and through the country of the Camanche Indians in the\r\nfall of the year 1845, as requested by the resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe 9th instant.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 16, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 3d instant, I\r\ncommunicate herewith estimates prepared by the War and Navy Departments\r\nof the probable expenses of conducting the existing war with Mexico\r\nduring the remainder of the present and the whole of the next fiscal\r\nyear. I communicate also a report of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nbased upon these estimates, containing recommendations of measures for\r\nraising the additional means required. It is probable that the actual\r\nexpenses incurred during the period specified may fall considerably\r\nbelow the estimates submitted, which are for a larger number of troops\r\nthan have yet been called to the field. As a precautionary measure,\r\nhowever, against any possible deficiency, the estimates have been made\r\nat the largest amount which any state of the service may require.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nthat a considerable portion of the additional amount required may be\r\nraised by a modification of the rates of duty imposed by the existing\r\ntariff laws. The high duties at present levied on many articles totally\r\nexclude them from importation, whilst the quantity and amount of others\r\nwhich are imported are greatly diminished. By reducing these duties to a\r\nrevenue standard, it is not doubted that a large amount of the articles\r\non which they are imposed would be imported, and a corresponding amount\r\nof revenue be received at the Treasury from this source. By imposing\r\nrevenue duties on many articles now permitted to be imported free of\r\nduty, and by regulating the rates within the revenue standard upon\r\nothers, a large additional revenue will be collected. Independently of\r\nthe high considerations which induced me in my annual message to\r\nrecommend a modification and reduction of the rates of duty imposed by\r\nthe act of 1842 as being not only proper in reference to a state of\r\npeace, but just to all the great interests of the country, the necessity\r\nof such modification and reduction as a war measure must now be\r\nmanifest. The country requires additional revenue for the prosecution of\r\nthe war. It may be obtained to a great extent by reducing the\r\nprohibitory and highly protective duties imposed by the existing laws to\r\nrevenue rates, by imposing revenue duties on the free list, and by\r\nmodifying the rates of duty on other articles.\r\n\r\nThe modifications recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury in his\r\nannual report in December last were adapted to a state of peace, and the\r\nadditional duties now suggested by him are with a view strictly to raise\r\nrevenue as a war measure. At the conclusion of the war these duties may\r\nand should be abolished and reduced to lower rates.\r\n\r\nIt is not apprehended that the existing war with Mexico will materially\r\naffect our trade and commerce with the rest of the world. On the\r\ncontrary, the reductions proposed would increase that trade and augment\r\nthe revenue derived from it.\r\n\r\nWhen the country is in a state of war no contingency should be permitted\r\nto occur in which there would be a deficiency in the Treasury for the\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war, and to guard against such an event it\r\nis recommended that contingent authority be given to issue Treasury\r\nnotes or to contract a loan for a limited amount, reimbursable at an\r\nearly day. Should no occasion arise to exercise the power, still it may\r\nbe important that the authority should exist should there be a necessity\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nIt is not deemed necessary to resort to direct taxes or excises, the\r\nmeasures recommended being deemed preferable as a means of increasing\r\nthe revenue. It is hoped that the war with Mexico, if vigorously\r\nprosecuted, as is contemplated, may be of short duration. I shall be at\r\nall times ready to conclude an honorable peace whenever the Mexican\r\nGovernment shall manifest a like disposition. The existing war has been\r\nrendered necessary by the acts of Mexico, and whenever that power shall\r\nbe ready to do us justice we shall be prepared to sheath the sword and\r\ntender to her the olive branch of peace.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 21, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit, in compliance with the request of the Senate in\r\ntheir resolution of the 17th of June, 1846, a report of the Secretary of\r\nState, together with a copy of all \"the dispatches and instructions\"\r\n\"relative to the Oregon treaty\" \"forwarded to our minister, Mr. McLane,\"\r\n\"not heretofore communicated to the Senate,\" including a statement of\r\nthe propositions for the adjustment of the Oregon question previously\r\nmade and rejected by the respective Governments. This statement was\r\nfurnished to Mr. McLane before his departure from the country, and is\r\ndated on the 12th July, 1845, the day on which the note was addressed by\r\nthe Secretary of State to Mr. Pakenham offering to settle the\r\ncontroversy by the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, which was rejected\r\nby that minister on the 29th July following.\r\n\r\nThe Senate will perceive that extracts from but two of Mr. McLane's\r\n\"dispatches and communications to this Government\" are transmitted, and\r\nthese only because they were necessary to explain the answers given to\r\nthem by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThese dispatches are both numerous and voluminous, and, from their\r\nconfidential character, their publication, it is believed, would be\r\nhighly prejudicial to the public interests.\r\n\r\nPublic considerations alone have induced me to withhold the dispatches\r\nof Mr. McLane addressed to the Secretary of State. I concur with the\r\nSecretary of State in the views presented in his report herewith\r\ntransmitted, against the publication of these dispatches.\r\n\r\nMr. McLane has performed his whole duty to his country, and I am not\r\nonly willing, but anxious, that every Senator who may desire it shall\r\nhave an opportunity of perusing these dispatches at the Department of\r\nState. The Secretary of State has been instructed to afford every\r\nfacility for this purpose.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 21, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in answer\r\nto the resolution of the Senate of the 18th of June, 1846, calling for\r\ncertain information in relation to the Oregon Territory.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 4, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate the copy of a letter, under date of\r\nthe 27th ultimo, from the Secretary of State of the United States to the\r\nminister of foreign relations of the Mexican Republic, again proposing\r\nto open negotiations and conclude a treaty of peace which shall adjust\r\nall the questions in dispute between the two Republics. Considering the\r\nrelative power of the two countries, the glorious events which have\r\nalready signalized our arms, and the distracted condition of Mexico,\r\nI did not conceive that any point of national honor could exist which\r\nought to prevent me from making this overture. Equally anxious to\r\nterminate by a peace honorable for both parties as I was originally to\r\navoid the existing war, I have deemed it my duty again to extend the\r\nolive branch to Mexico. Should the Government of that Republic accept\r\nthe offer in the same friendly spirit by which it was dictated,\r\nnegotiations will speedily commence for the conclusion of a treaty.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty to be anticipated in the negotiation is the\r\nadjustment of the boundary between the parties by a line which shall at\r\nonce be satisfactory to both, and such as neither will hereafter be\r\ninclined to disturb. This is the best mode of securing perpetual peace\r\nand good neighborhood between the two Republics. Should the Mexican\r\nGovernment, in order to accomplish these objects, be willing to cede any\r\nportion of their territory to the United States, we ought to pay them a\r\nfair equivalent--a just and honorable peace, and not conquest, being our\r\npurpose in the prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, and considering the exhausted and distracted\r\ncondition of the Mexican Republic, it might become necessary in order to\r\nrestore peace that I should have it in my power to advance a portion of\r\nthe consideration money for any cession of territory which may be made.\r\nThe Mexican Government might not be willing to wait for the payment of\r\nthe whole until the treaty could be ratified by the Senate and an\r\nappropriation to carry it into effect be made by Congress, and the\r\nnecessity for such a delay might defeat the object altogether. I would\r\ntherefore suggest whether it might not be wise for Congress to\r\nappropriate a sum such as they might consider adequate for this purpose,\r\nto be paid, if necessary, immediately upon the ratification of the\r\ntreaty by Mexico. This disbursement would of course be accounted for at\r\nthe Treasury, not as secret-service money, but like other expenditures.\r\n\r\nTwo precedents for such a proceeding exist in our past history, during\r\nthe Administration of Mr. Jefferson, to which I would call your\r\nattention. On the 26th February, 1803, Congress passed an act\r\nappropriating $2,000,000 for the purpose of defraying any extraordinary\r\nexpenses which may be incurred in the intercourse \"between the United\r\nStates and foreign nations,\" \"to be applied under the direction of the\r\nPresident of the United States, who shall cause an account of the\r\nexpenditure thereof to be laid before Congress as soon as may be;\" and\r\non the 13th February, 1806, an appropriation was made of the same amount\r\nand in the same terms. The object in the first case was to enable the\r\nPresident to obtain the cession of Louisiana, and in the second that of\r\nthe Florida. In neither case was the money actually drawn from the\r\nTreasury, and I should hope that the result might be similar in this\r\nrespect on the present occasion, though the appropriation is deemed\r\nexpedient as a precautionary measure.\r\n\r\nI refer the whole subject to the Senate in executive session. If they\r\nshould concur in opinion with me, then I recommend the passage of a law\r\nappropriating such a sum as Congress may deem adequate, to be used by\r\nthe Executive, if necessary, for the purpose which I have indicated.\r\n\r\nIn the two cases to which I have referred the special purpose of the\r\nappropriation did not appear on the face of the law, as this might have\r\ndefeated the object; neither, for the same reason, in my opinion, ought\r\nit now to be stated.\r\n\r\nI also communicate to the Senate the copy of a letter from the Secretary\r\nof State to Commodore Conner of the 29th ultimo, which was transmitted\r\nto him on the day it bears date.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 5, 1846._\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a copy of a convention for the settlement and\r\nadjustment of the Oregon question, which was concluded in this city on\r\nthe 15th day of June last between the United States and Her Britannic\r\nMajesty. This convention has since been duly ratified by the respective\r\nparties, and the ratifications were exchanged at London on the 17th day\r\nof July, 1846.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes important that provision should be made by law at the\r\nearliest practicable period for the organization of a Territorial\r\ngovernment in Oregon.\r\n\r\nIt is also deemed proper that our laws regulating trade and intercourse\r\nwith the Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains should be extended to\r\nsuch tribes within our territory as dwell beyond them, and that a\r\nsuitable number of Indian agents should be appointed for the purpose of\r\ncarrying these laws into execution.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise important that mail facilities, so indispensable for the\r\ndiffusion of information and for binding together the different portions\r\nof our extended Confederacy, should be afforded to our citizens west of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThere is another subject to which I desire to call your special\r\nattention. It is of great importance to our country generally, and\r\nespecially to our navigating and whaling interests, that the Pacific\r\nCoast, and, indeed, the whole of our territory west of the Rocky\r\nMountains, should speedily be filled up by a hardy and patriotic\r\npopulation. Emigrants to that territory have many difficulties to\r\nencounter and privations to endure in their long and perilous journey,\r\nand by the time they reach their place of destination their pecuniary\r\nmeans are generally much reduced, if not altogether exhausted. Under\r\nthese circumstances it is deemed but an act of justice that these\r\nemigrants, whilst most effectually advancing the interests and policy of\r\nthe Government, should be aided by liberal grants of land. I would\r\ntherefore recommend that such grants be made to actual settlers upon the\r\nterms and under the restrictions and limitations which Congress may\r\nthink advisable.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 7, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of the Navy, with the\r\naccompanying documents, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of\r\nAugust 6, 1846, calling for the report of the board of naval officers,\r\nrecently in session in this city, including the orders under which it\r\nwas convened and the evidence which may have been laid before it.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 7, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and constitutional action of\r\nthe Senate, articles of a treaty which has been concluded by the\r\ncommissioners appointed for the purpose with the different parties into\r\nwhich the Cherokee tribe of Indians has been divided, through their\r\ndelegates now in Washington. The same commissioners had previously been\r\nappointed to investigate the subject of the difficulties which have for\r\nyears existed among the Cherokees, and which have kept them in a state\r\nof constant excitement and almost entirely interrupted all progress on\r\ntheir part in civilization and improvement in agriculture and the\r\nmechanic arts, and have led to many unfortunate acts of domestic strife,\r\nagainst which the Government is bound by the treaty of 1835 to protect\r\nthem. Their unfortunate internal dissensions had attracted the notice\r\nand excited the sympathies of the whole country, and it became evident\r\nthat if something was not done to heal them they would terminate in a\r\nsanguinary war, in which other tribes of Indians might become involved\r\nand the lives and property of our own citizens on the frontier\r\nendangered. I recommended in my message to Congress on the 13th of April\r\nlast such measures as I then thought it expedient should be adopted to\r\nrestore peace and good order among the Cherokees, one of which was a\r\ndivision of the country which they occupy and separation of the tribe.\r\nThis recommendation was made under the belief that the different\r\nfactions could not be reconciled and live together in harmony--a belief\r\nbased in a great degree upon the representations of the delegates of the\r\ntwo divisions of the tribe. Since then, however, there appears to have\r\nbeen a change of opinion on this subject on the part of these divisions\r\nof the tribe, and on representations being made to me that by the\r\nappointment of commissioners to hear and investigate the causes of\r\ngrievance of the parties against each other and to examine into their\r\nclaims against the Government it would probably be found that an\r\narrangement could be made which would once more harmonize the tribe and\r\nadjust in a satisfactory manner their claims upon and relations with the\r\nUnited States, I did not hesitate to appoint three persons for the\r\npurpose. The commissioners entered into an able and laborious\r\ninvestigation, and on their making known to me the probability of their\r\nbeing able to conclude a new treaty with the delegates of all the\r\ndivisions of the tribe, who were fully empowered to make any new\r\narrangement which would heal all dissensions among the Cherokees and\r\nrestore them to their ancient condition of peace and good brotherhood,\r\nI authorized and appointed them to enter into negotiations with these\r\ndelegates for the accomplishment of that object. The treaty now\r\ntransmitted is the result of their labors, and it is hoped that it will\r\nmeet the approbation of Congress, and, if carried out in good faith by\r\nall parties to it, it is believed it will effect the great and desirable\r\nends had in view.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the treaty is the report of the commissioners, and also a\r\ncommunication to them from John Ross and others, who represent what is\r\ntermed the government party of the Cherokees, and which is transmitted\r\nat their request for the consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 8, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the propriety of making an appropriation to\r\nprovide for any expenditure which it may be necessary to make in advance\r\nfor the purpose of settling all our difficulties with the Mexican\r\nRepublic. It is my sincere desire to terminate, as it was originally to\r\navoid, the existing war with Mexico by a peace just and honorable to\r\nboth parties. It is probable that the chief obstacle to be surmounted in\r\naccomplishing this desirable object will be the adjustment of a boundary\r\nbetween the two Republics which shall prove satisfactory and convenient\r\nto both, and such as neither will hereafter be inclined to disturb. In\r\nthe adjustment of this boundary we ought to pay a fair equivalent for\r\nany concessions which may be made by Mexico.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, and considering the other complicated\r\nquestions to be settled by negotiation with the Mexican Republic, I deem\r\nit important that a sum of money should be placed under the control of\r\nthe Executive to be advanced, if need be, to the Government of that\r\nRepublic immediately after their ratification of a treaty. It might be\r\ninconvenient for the Mexican Government to wait for the whole sum the\r\npayment of which may be stipulated by this treaty until it could be\r\nratified by our Senate and an appropriation to carry it into effect made\r\nby Congress. Indeed, the necessity for this delay might defeat the\r\nobject altogether. The disbursement of this money would of course be\r\naccounted for, not as secret-service money, but like other expenditures.\r\n\r\nTwo precedents for such a proceeding exist in our past history, during\r\nthe Administration of Mr. Jefferson, to which I would call your\r\nattention: On the 26th February, 1803, an act was passed appropriating\r\n$2,000,000 \"for the purpose of defraying any extraordinary expenses\r\nwhich may be incurred in the intercourse between the United States and\r\nforeign nations,\" \"to be applied under the direction of the President of\r\nthe United States, who shall cause an account of the expenditure thereof\r\nto be laid before Congress as soon as may be;\" and on the 13th of\r\nFebruary, 1806, an appropriation was made of the same amount and in the\r\nsame terms. In neither case was the money actually drawn from the\r\nTreasury, and I should hope that the result in this respect might be\r\nsimilar on the present occasion, although the appropriation may prove\r\nto be indispensable in accomplishing the object. I would therefore\r\nrecommend the passage of a law appropriating $2,000,000 to be placed at\r\nthe disposal of the Executive for the purpose which I have indicated.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent all misapprehension, it is my duty to state that,\r\nanxious as I am to terminate the existing war with the least possible\r\ndelay, it will continue to be prosecuted with the utmost vigor until\r\na treaty of peace shall be signed by the parties and ratified by the\r\nMexican Republic.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 3, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have considered the bill entitled \"An act making appropriations for\r\nthe improvement of certain harbors and rivers\" with the care which\r\nits importance demands, and now return the same to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in which it originated, with my objections to its\r\nbecoming a law. The bill proposes to appropriate $1,378,450 to be\r\napplied to more than forty distinct and separate objects of improvement.\r\nOn examining its provisions and the variety of objects of improvement\r\nwhich it embraces, many of them of a local character, it is difficult to\r\nconceive, if it shall be sanctioned and become a law, what practical\r\nconstitutional restraint can hereafter be imposed upon the most extended\r\nsystem of internal improvements by the Federal Government in all parts\r\nof the Union. The Constitution has not, in my judgment, conferred upon\r\nthe Federal Government the power to construct works of internal\r\nimprovement within the States, or to appropriate money from the Treasury\r\nfor that purpose. That this bill assumes for the Federal Government the\r\nright to exercise this power can not, I think, be doubted. The approved\r\ncourse of the Government and the deliberately expressed judgment of the\r\npeople have denied the existence of such a power under the Constitution.\r\nSeveral of my predecessors have denied its existence in the most solemn\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe general proposition that the Federal Government does not possess\r\nthis power is so well settled and has for a considerable period been so\r\ngenerally acquiesced in that it is not deemed necessary to reiterate the\r\narguments by which it is sustained. Nor do I deem it necessary, after\r\nthe full and elaborate discussions which have taken place before the\r\ncountry on this subject, to do more than to state the general\r\nconsiderations which have satisfied me of the unconstitutionality and\r\ninexpediency of the exercise of such a power.\r\n\r\nIt is not questioned that the Federal Government is one of limited\r\npowers. Its powers are such, and such only, as are expressly granted in\r\nthe Constitution or are properly incident to the expressly granted\r\npowers and necessary to their execution. In determining whether a given\r\npower has been granted a sound rule of construction has been laid down\r\nby Mr. Madison. That rule is that--\r\n\r\n  Whenever a question arises concerning a particular power, the first\r\n  question is whether the power be expressed in the Constitution. If it\r\n  be, the question is decided. If it be not expressed, the next inquiry\r\n  must be whether it is properly an incident to an expressed power and\r\n  necessary to its execution. If it be, it may be exercised by Congress.\r\n  If it be not, Congress can not exercise it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that there is any express grant in the Constitution\r\nconferring on Congress the power in question. Is it, then, an incidental\r\npower necessary and proper for the execution of any of the granted\r\npowers? All the granted powers, it is confidently affirmed, may be\r\neffectually executed without the aid of such an incident. \"A power, to\r\nbe incidental, must not be exercised for ends which make it a principal\r\nor substantive power, independent of the principal power to which it is\r\nan incident.\" It is not enough that it may be regarded by Congress as\r\n_convenient_ or that its exercise would advance the public weal. It must\r\nbe _necessary and proper_ to the execution of the principal expressed\r\npower to which it is an incident, and without which such principal power\r\ncan not be carried into effect. The whole frame of the Federal\r\nConstitution proves that the Government which it creates was intended\r\nto be one of limited and specified powers. A construction of the\r\nConstitution so broad as that by which the power in question is defended\r\ntends imperceptibly to a consolidation of power in a Government intended\r\nby its framers to be thus limited in its authority. \"The obvious\r\ntendency and inevitable result of a consolidation of the States into one\r\nsovereignty would be to transform the republican system of the United\r\nStates into a monarchy.\" To guard against the assumption of all powers\r\nwhich encroach upon the reserved sovereignty of the States, and which\r\nconsequently tend to consolidation, is the duty of all the true friends\r\nof our political system. That the power in question is not properly an\r\nincident to any of the granted powers I am fully satisfied; but if there\r\nwere doubts on this subject, experience has demonstrated the wisdom of\r\nthe rule that all the functionaries of the Federal Government should\r\nabstain from the exercise of all questionable or doubtful powers. If an\r\nenlargement of the powers of the Federal Government should be deemed\r\nproper, it is safer and wiser to appeal to the States and the people\r\nin the mode prescribed by the Constitution for the grant desired than\r\nto assume its exercise without an amendment of the Constitution.\r\nIf Congress does not possess the general power to construct works of\r\ninternal improvement within the States, or to appropriate money from the\r\nTreasury for that purpose, what is there to exempt some, at least, of\r\nthe objects of appropriation included in this bill from the operation of\r\nthe general rule? This bill assumes the existence of the power, and in\r\nsome of its provisions asserts the principle that Congress may exercise\r\nit as fully as though the appropriations which it proposes were\r\napplicable to the construction of roads and canals. If there be a\r\ndistinction in principle, it is not perceived, and should be clearly\r\ndefined. Some of the objects of appropriation contained in this bill are\r\nlocal in their character, and lie within the limits of a single State;\r\nand though in the language of the bill they are called _harbors_, they\r\nare not connected with foreign commerce, nor are they places of refuge\r\nor shelter for our Navy or commercial marine on the ocean or lake\r\nshores. To call the mouth of a creek or a shallow inlet on our coast\r\na harbor can not confer the authority to expend the public money in\r\nits improvement. Congress have exercised the power coeval with the\r\nConstitution of establishing light-houses, beacons, buoys, and piers on\r\nour ocean and lake shores for the purpose of rendering navigation safe\r\nand easy and of affording protection and shelter for our Navy and\r\nother shipping. These are safeguards placed in existing channels of\r\nnavigation. After the long acquiescence of the Government through all\r\npreceding Administrations, I am not disposed to question or disturb the\r\nauthority to make appropriations for such purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen we advance a step beyond this point, and, in addition to the\r\nestablishment and support, by appropriations from the Treasury, of\r\nlighthouses, beacons, buoys, piers, and other improvements within the\r\nbays, inlets, and harbors on our ocean and lake coasts immediately\r\nconnected with our foreign commerce, attempt to make improvements in the\r\ninterior at points unconnected with foreign commerce, and where they are\r\nnot needed for the protection and security of our Navy and commercial\r\nmarine, the difficulty arises in drawing a line beyond which\r\nappropriations may not be made by the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nOne of my predecessors, who saw the evil consequences of the system\r\nproposed to be revived by this bill, attempted to define this line by\r\ndeclaring that \"expenditures of this character\" should be \"confined\r\n_below_ the ports of entry or delivery established by law.\" Acting on\r\nthis restriction, he withheld his sanction from a bill which had passed\r\nCongress \"to improve the navigation of the Wabash River.\" He was at the\r\nsame time \"sensible that this restriction was not as satisfactory as\r\ncould be desired, and that much embarrassment may be caused to the\r\nexecutive department in its execution, by appropriations for remote and\r\nnot well-understood objects.\" This restriction, it was soon found, was\r\nsubject to be evaded and rendered comparatively useless in checking the\r\nsystem of improvements which it was designed to arrest, in consequence\r\nof the facility with which ports of entry and delivery may be\r\nestablished by law upon the upper waters, and in some instances almost\r\nat the head springs of some of the most unimportant of our rivers, and\r\nat points on our coast possessing no commercial importance and not used\r\nas places of refuge and safety by our Navy and other shipping. Many of\r\nthe ports of entry and delivery now authorized by law, so far as foreign\r\ncommerce is concerned, exist only in the statute books. No entry of\r\nforeign goods is ever made and no duties are ever collected at them. No\r\nexports of American products bound for foreign countries ever clear from\r\nthem. To assume that their existence in the statute book as ports of\r\nentry or delivery warrants expenditures on the waters leading to them,\r\nwhich would be otherwise unauthorized, would be to assert the\r\nproposition that the lawmaking power may ingraft new provisions on the\r\nConstitution. If the restriction is a sound one, it can only apply to\r\nthe bays, inlets, and rivers connected with or leading to such, ports as\r\nactually have foreign commerce--ports at which foreign importations\r\narrive in bulk, paying the duties charged by law, and from which exports\r\nare made to foreign countries. It will be found by applying the\r\nrestriction thus understood to the bill under consideration that it\r\ncontains appropriations for more than twenty objects of internal\r\nimprovement, called in the bill _harbors_, at places which have never\r\nbeen declared by law either ports of entry or delivery, and at which,\r\nas appears from the records of the Treasury, there has never been an\r\narrival of foreign merchandise, and from which there has never been a\r\nvessel cleared for a foreign country. It will be found that many of\r\nthese works are new, and at places for the improvement of which\r\nappropriations are now for the first time proposed. It will be found\r\nalso that the bill contains appropriations for rivers upon which there\r\nnot only exists no foreign commerce, but upon which there has not been\r\nestablished even a paper port of entry, and for the mouths of creeks,\r\ndenominated harbors, which if improved can benefit only the particular\r\nneighborhood in which they are situated. It will be found, too, to\r\ncontain appropriations the expenditure of which will only have the\r\neffect of improving one place at the expense of the local natural\r\nadvantages of another in its vicinity. Should this bill become a law,\r\nthe same _principle_ which authorizes the appropriations which it\r\nproposes to make would also authorize similar appropriations for the\r\nimprovement of all the other bays, inlets, and creeks, which may with\r\nequal propriety be called harbors, and of all the rivers, important or\r\nunimportant, in every part of the Union. To sanction the bill with such\r\nprovisions would be to concede the _principle_ that the Federal\r\nGovernment possesses the power to expend the public money in a general\r\nsystem of internal improvements, limited in its extent only by the\r\never-varying discretion of successive Congresses and successive\r\nExecutives. It would be to efface and remove the limitations and\r\nrestrictions of power which the Constitution has wisely provided to\r\nlimit the authority and action of the Federal Government to a few\r\nwell-defined and specified objects. Besides these objections, the\r\npractical evils which must flow from the exercise on the part of the\r\nFederal Government of the powers asserted in this bill impress my mind\r\nwith a grave sense of my duty to avert them from the country as far as\r\nmy constitutional action may enable me to do so.\r\n\r\nIt not only leads to a consolidation of power in the Federal Government\r\nat the expense of the rightful authority of the States, but its\r\ninevitable tendency is to embrace objects for the expenditure of the\r\npublic money which are local in their character, benefiting but few at\r\nthe expense of the common Treasury of the whole. It will engender\r\nsectional feelings and prejudices calculated to disturb the harmony of\r\nthe Union. It will destroy the harmony which should prevail in our\r\nlegislative councils.\r\n\r\nIt will produce combinations of local and sectional interests, strong\r\nenough when united to carry propositions for appropriations of public\r\nmoney which could not of themselves, and standing alone, succeed, and\r\ncan not fail to lead to wasteful and extravagant expenditures.\r\n\r\nIt must produce a disreputable scramble for the public money, by the\r\nconflict which is inseparable from such a system between local and\r\nindividual interests and the general interest of the whole. It is unjust\r\nto those States which have with their own means constructed their own\r\ninternal improvements to make from the common Treasury appropriations\r\nfor similar improvements in other States.\r\n\r\nIn its operation it will be oppressive and unjust toward those States\r\nwhose representatives and people either deny or doubt the existence of\r\nthe power or think its exercise inexpedient, and who, while they equally\r\ncontribute to the Treasury, can not consistently with their opinions\r\nengage in a general competition for a share of the public money. Thus\r\na large portion of the Union, in numbers and in geographical extent,\r\ncontributing its equal proportion of taxes to the support of the\r\nGovernment, would under the operation of such a system be compelled to\r\nsee the national treasure--the common stock of all--unequally disbursed,\r\nand often improvidently wasted for the advantage of small sections,\r\ninstead of being applied to the great national purposes in which all\r\nhave a common interest, and for which alone the power to collect the\r\nrevenue was given. Should the system of internal improvements proposed\r\nprevail, all these evils will multiply and increase with the increase of\r\nthe number of the States and the extension of the geographical limits of\r\nthe settled portions of our country. With the increase of our numbers\r\nand the extension of our settlements the local objects demanding\r\nappropriations of the public money for their improvement will be\r\nproportionately increased. In each case the expenditure of the public\r\nmoney would confer benefits, direct or indirect, only on a section,\r\nwhile these sections would become daily less in comparison with the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the framers of the Constitution in withholding power over\r\nsuch objects from the Federal Government and leaving them to the local\r\ngovernments of the States becomes more and more manifest with every\r\nyear's experience of the operations of our system.\r\n\r\nIn a country of limited extent, with but few such objects of expenditure\r\n(if the form of government permitted it), a common treasury might be\r\nused for their improvement with much less inequality and injustice than\r\nin one of the vast extent which ours now presents in population and\r\nterritory. The treasure of the world would hardly be equal to the\r\nimprovement of every bay, inlet, creek, and river in our country which\r\nmight be supposed to promote the agricultural, manufacturing, or\r\ncommercial interests of a neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution was wisely adapted in its provisions to any\r\nexpansion of our limits and population, and with the advance of the\r\nconfederacy of the States in the career of national greatness it becomes\r\nthe more apparent that the harmony of the Union and the equal justice to\r\nwhich all its parts are entitled require that the Federal Government\r\nshould confine its action within the limits prescribed by the\r\nConstitution to its power and authority. Some of the provisions of this\r\nbill are not subject to the objections stated, and did they stand alone\r\nI should not feel it to be my duty to withhold my approval.\r\n\r\nIf no constitutional objections existed to the bill, there are others of\r\na serious nature which deserve some consideration. It appropriates\r\nbetween $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 for objects which are of no pressing\r\nnecessity, and this is proposed at a time when the country is engaged in\r\na foreign war, and when Congress at its present session has authorized a\r\nloan or the issue of Treasury notes to defray the expenses of the war,\r\nto be resorted to if the \"exigencies of the Government shall require\r\nit.\" It would seem to be the dictate of wisdom under such circumstances\r\nto husband our means, and not to waste them on comparatively unimportant\r\nobjects, so that we may reduce the loan or issue of Treasury notes which\r\nmay become necessary to the smallest practicable sum. It would seem to\r\nbe wise, too, to abstain from such expenditures with a view to avoid the\r\naccumulation of a large public debt, the existence of which would be\r\nopposed to the interests of our people as well as to the genius of our\r\nfree institutions.\r\n\r\nShould this bill become a law, the principle which it establishes will\r\ninevitably lead to large and annually increasing appropriations and\r\ndrains upon the Treasury, for it is not to be doubted that numerous\r\nother localities not embraced in its provisions, but quite as much\r\nentitled to the favor of the Government as those which are embraced,\r\nwill demand, through their representatives in Congress, to be placed on\r\nan equal footing with them. With such an increase of expenditure must\r\nnecessarily follow either an increased public debt or increased burdens\r\nupon the people by taxation to supply the Treasury with the means of\r\nmeeting the accumulated demands upon it.\r\n\r\nWith profound respect for the opinions of Congress, and ever anxious, as\r\nfar as I can consistently with my responsibility to our common\r\nconstituents, to cooperate with them in the discharge of our respective\r\nduties, it is with unfeigned regret that I find myself constrained, for\r\nthe reasons which I have assigned, to withhold my approval from this\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 8, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return to the Senate, in which it originated, the bill entitled \"An\r\nact to provide for the ascertainment and satisfaction of claims of\r\nAmerican citizens for spoliations committed by the French prior to the\r\n31st day of July, 1801,\" which was presented to me on the 6th instant,\r\nwith my objections to its becoming a law.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to give to the bill the careful examination it requires,\r\ndifficulties presented themselves in the outset from the remoteness of\r\nthe period to which the claims belong, the complicated nature of the\r\ntransactions in which they originated, and the protracted negotiations\r\nto which they led between France and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe short time intervening between the passage of the bill by Congress\r\nand the approaching close of their session, as well as the pressure of\r\nother official duties, have not permitted me to extend my examination of\r\nthe subject into its minute details; but in the consideration which I\r\nhave been able to give to it I find objections of a grave character to\r\nits provisions.\r\n\r\nFor the satisfaction of the claims provided for by the bill it is\r\nproposed to appropriate $5,000,000. I can perceive no legal or equitable\r\nground upon which this large appropriation can rest. A portion of the\r\nclaims have been more than half a century before the Government in its\r\nexecutive or legislative departments, and all of them had their origin\r\nin events which occurred prior to the year 1800. Since 1802 they have\r\nbeen from time to time before Congress. No greater necessity or\r\npropriety exists for providing for these claims at this time than has\r\nexisted for near half a century, during all which period this\r\nquestionable measure has never until now received the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress. It is scarcely probable, if the claim had\r\nbeen regarded as obligatory upon the Government or constituting an\r\nequitable demand upon the Treasury, that those who were contemporaneous\r\nwith the events which gave rise to it should not long since have done\r\njustice to the claimants. The Treasury has often been in a condition to\r\nenable the Government to do so without inconvenience if these claims had\r\nbeen considered just. Mr. Jefferson, who was fully cognizant of the\r\nearly dissensions between the Governments of the United States and\r\nFrance, out of which the claims arose, in his annual message in 1808\r\nadverted to the large surplus then in the Treasury and its \"probable\r\naccumulation,\" and inquired whether it should \"lie unproductive in the\r\npublic vaults;\" and yet these claims, though then before Congress, were\r\nnot recognized or paid. Since that time the public debt of the\r\nRevolution and of the War of 1812 has been extinguished, and at several\r\nperiods since the Treasury has been in possession of large surpluses\r\nover the demands upon it. In 1836 the surplus amounted to many millions\r\nof dollars, and, for want of proper objects to which to apply it, it was\r\ndirected by Congress to be deposited with the States.\r\n\r\nDuring this extended course of time, embracing periods eminently\r\nfavorable for satisfying all just demands upon the Government, the\r\nclaims embraced in this bill met with no favor in Congress beyond\r\nreports of committees in one or the other branch. These circumstances\r\nalone are calculated to raise strong doubts in respect to these claims,\r\nmore especially as all the information necessary to a correct judgment\r\nconcerning them has been long before the public. These doubts are\r\nstrengthened in my mind by the examination I have been enabled to give\r\nto the transactions in which they originated.\r\n\r\nThe bill assumes that the United States have become liable in these\r\nancient transactions to make reparation to the claimants for injuries\r\ncommitted by France. Nothing was obtained for the claimants by\r\nnegotiation; and the bill assumes that the Government has become\r\nresponsible to them for the aggressions of France. I have not been able\r\nto satisfy myself of the correctness of this assumption, or that the\r\nGovernment has become in any way responsible for these claims. The\r\nlimited time allotted me before your adjournment precludes the\r\npossibility of reiterating the facts and arguments by which in preceding\r\nCongresses these claims have been successfully resisted.\r\n\r\nThe present is a period peculiarly unfavorable for the satisfaction of\r\nclaims of so large an amount and, to say the least of them, of so\r\ndoubtful a character. There is no surplus in the Treasury. A public debt\r\nof several millions of dollars has been created within the last few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWe are engaged in a foreign war, uncertain in its duration and involving\r\nheavy expenditures, to prosecute which Congress has at its present\r\nsession authorized a further loan; so that in effect the Government,\r\nshould this bill become a law, borrows money and increases the public\r\ndebt to pay these claims.\r\n\r\nIt is true that by the provisions of the bill payment is directed to be\r\nmade in land scrip instead of money, but the effect upon the Treasury\r\nwill be the same. The public lands constitute one of the sources of\r\npublic revenue, and if these claims be paid in land scrip it will from\r\nthe date of its issue to a great extent cut off from the Treasury the\r\nannual income from the sales of the public lands, because payments for\r\nlands sold by the Government may be expected to be made in scrip until\r\nit is all redeemed. If these claims be just, they ought to be paid in\r\nmoney, and not in anything less valuable. The bill provides that they\r\nshall be paid in land scrip, whereby they are made in effect to be a\r\nmortgage upon the public lands in the new States; a mortgage, too, held\r\nin great part, if not wholly, by nonresidents of the States in which the\r\nlands lie, who may secure these lands to the amount of several millions\r\nof acres, and then demand for them exorbitant prices from the citizens\r\nof the States who may desire to purchase them for settlement, or they\r\nmay keep them out of the market, and thus retard the prosperity and\r\ngrowth of the States in which they are situated. Why this unusual mode\r\nof satisfying demands on the Treasury has been resorted to does not\r\nappear. It is not consistent with a sound public policy. If it be done\r\nin this case, it may be done in all others. It would form a precedent\r\nfor the satisfaction of all other stale and questionable claims in the\r\nsame manner, and would undoubtedly be resorted to by all claimants who\r\nafter successive trials shall fail to have their claims recognized and\r\npaid in money by Congress.\r\n\r\nThis bill proposes to appropriate $5,000,000, to be paid in land scrip,\r\nand provides that \"no claim or memorial shall be received by the\r\ncommissioners\" authorized by the act \"unless accompanied by a release or\r\ndischarge of the United States from all other and further compensation\"\r\nthan the claimant \"may be entitled to receive under the provisions of\r\nthis act.\" These claims are estimated to amount to a much larger sum\r\nthan $5,000,000, and yet the claimant is required to release to the\r\nGovernment all other compensation, and to accept his share of a fund\r\nwhich is known to be inadequate. If the claims be well founded, it would\r\nbe unjust to the claimants to repudiate any portion of them, and the\r\npayment of the remaining sum could not be hereafter resisted. This bill\r\nproposes to pay these claims not in the currency known to the\r\nConstitution, and not to their full amount.\r\n\r\nPassed, as this bill has been, near the close of the session, and when\r\nmany measures of importance necessarily claim the attention of Congress,\r\nand possibly without that full and deliberate consideration which the\r\nlarge sum it appropriates and the existing condition of the Treasury and\r\nof the country demand, I deem it to be my duty to withhold my approval,\r\nthat it may hereafter undergo the revision of Congress. I have come to\r\nthis conclusion with regret. In interposing my objections to its\r\nbecoming a law I am fully sensible that it should be an extreme case\r\nwhich would make it the duty of the Executive to withhold his approval\r\nof any bill passed by Congress upon the ground of its inexpediency\r\nalone. Such a case I consider this to be.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  N.P. TRIST,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn resuming your labors in the service of the people it is a subject of\r\ncongratulation that there has been no period in our past history when\r\nall the elements of national prosperity have been so fully developed.\r\nSince your last session no afflicting dispensation has visited our\r\ncountry. General good health has prevailed, abundance has crowned the\r\ntoil of the husbandman, and labor in all its branches is receiving\r\nan ample reward, while education, science, and the arts are rapidly\r\nenlarging the means of social happiness. The progress of our country\r\nin her career of greatness, not only in the vast extension of our\r\nterritorial limits and the rapid increase of our population, but in\r\nresources and wealth and in the happy condition of our people, is\r\nwithout an example in the history of nations.\r\n\r\nAs the wisdom, strength, and beneficence of our free institutions are\r\nunfolded, every day adds fresh motives to contentment and fresh\r\nincentives to patriotism.\r\n\r\nOur devout and sincere acknowledgments are due to the gracious Giver of\r\nAll Good for the numberless blessings which our beloved country enjoys.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of high satisfaction to know that the relations of the\r\nUnited States with all other nations, with a single exception, are of\r\nthe most amicable character. Sincerely attached to the policy of peace\r\nearly adopted and steadily pursued by this Government, I have anxiously\r\ndesired to cultivate and cherish friendship and commerce with every\r\nforeign power. The spirit and habits of the American people are\r\nfavorable to the maintenance of such international harmony. In adhering\r\nto this wise policy, a preliminary and paramount duty obviously consists\r\nin the protection of our national interests from encroachment or\r\nsacrifice and our national honor from reproach. These must be maintained\r\nat any hazard. They admit of no compromise or neglect, and must be\r\nscrupulously and constantly guarded. In their vigilant vindication\r\ncollision and conflict with foreign powers may sometimes become\r\nunavoidable. Such has been our scrupulous adherence to the dictates of\r\njustice in all our foreign intercourse that, though steadily and rapidly\r\nadvancing in prosperity and power, we have given no just cause of\r\ncomplaint to any nation and have enjoyed the blessings of peace for more\r\nthan thirty years. From a policy so sacred to humanity and so salutary\r\nin its effects upon our political system we should never be induced\r\nvoluntarily to depart.\r\n\r\nThe existing war with Mexico was neither desired nor provoked by the\r\nUnited States. On the contrary, all honorable means were resorted to to\r\navert it. After years of endurance of aggravated and unredressed wrongs\r\non our part, Mexico, in violation of solemn treaty stipulations and of\r\nevery principle of justice recognized by civilized nations, commenced\r\nhostilities, and thus by her own act forced the war upon us. Long before\r\nthe advance of our Army to the left bank of the Rio Grande we had ample\r\ncause of war against Mexico, and had the United States resorted to this\r\nextremity we might have appealed to the whole civilized world for the\r\njustice of our cause. I deem it to be my duty to present to you on the\r\npresent occasion a condensed review of the injuries we had sustained,\r\nof the causes which led to the war, and of its progress since its\r\ncommencement. This is rendered the more necessary because of the\r\nmisapprehensions which have to some extent prevailed as to its origin\r\nand true character. The war has been represented as unjust and\r\nunnecessary and as one of aggression on our part upon a weak and injured\r\nenemy. Such erroneous views, though entertained by but few, have been\r\nwidely and extensively circulated, not only at home, but have been\r\nspread throughout Mexico and the whole world. A more effectual means\r\ncould not have been devised to encourage the enemy and protract the war\r\nthan to advocate and adhere to their cause, and thus give them \"aid and\r\ncomfort.\" It is a source of national pride and exultation that the great\r\nbody of our people have thrown no such obstacles in the way of the\r\nGovernment in prosecuting the war successfully, but have shown\r\nthemselves to be eminently patriotic and ready to vindicate their\r\ncountry's honor and interests at any sacrifice. The alacrity and\r\npromptness with which our volunteer forces rushed to the field on their\r\ncountry's call prove not only their patriotism, but their deep\r\nconviction that our cause is just.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs which we have suffered from Mexico almost ever since she\r\nbecame an independent power and the patient endurance with which we have\r\nborne them are without a parallel in the history of modern civilized\r\nnations. There is reason to believe that if these wrongs had been\r\nresented and resisted in the first instance the present war might have\r\nbeen avoided. One outrage, however, permitted to pass with impunity\r\nalmost necessarily encouraged the perpetration of another, until at last\r\nMexico seemed to attribute to weakness and indecision on our part a\r\nforbearance which was the offspring of magnanimity and of a sincere\r\ndesire to preserve friendly relations with a sister republic.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Mexico achieved her independence, which the United States\r\nwere the first among the nations to acknowledge, when she commenced the\r\nsystem of insult and spoliation which she has ever since pursued. Our\r\ncitizens engaged in lawful commerce were imprisoned, their vessels\r\nseized, and our flag insulted in her ports. If money was wanted, the\r\nlawless seizure and confiscation of our merchant vessels and their\r\ncargoes was a ready resource, and if to accomplish their purposes it\r\nbecame necessary to imprison the owners, captains, and crews, it was\r\ndone. Rulers superseded rulers in Mexico in rapid succession, but still\r\nthere was no change in this system of depredation. The Government of the\r\nUnited States made repeated reclamations on behalf of its citizens, but\r\nthese were answered by the perpetration of new outrages. Promises of\r\nredress made by Mexico in the most solemn forms were postponed or\r\nevaded. The files and records of the Department of State contain\r\nconclusive proofs of numerous lawless acts perpetrated upon the property\r\nand persons of our citizens by Mexico, and of wanton insults to our\r\nnational flag. The interposition of our Government to obtain redress was\r\nagain and again invoked under circumstances which no nation ought to\r\ndisregard. It was hoped that these outrages would cease and that Mexico\r\nwould be restrained by the laws which regulate the conduct of civilized\r\nnations in their intercourse with each other after the treaty of amity,\r\ncommerce, and navigation of the 5th of April, 1831, was concluded\r\nbetween the two Republics; but this hope soon proved to be vain. The\r\ncourse of seizure and confiscation of the property of our citizens, the\r\nviolation of their persons, and the insults to our flag pursued by\r\nMexico previous to that time were scarcely suspended for even a brief\r\nperiod, although the treaty so clearly defines the rights and duties of\r\nthe respective parties that it is impossible to misunderstand or mistake\r\nthem. In less than seven years after the conclusion of that treaty our\r\ngrievances had become so intolerable that in the opinion of President\r\nJackson they should no longer be endured. In his message to Congress in\r\nFebruary, 1837, he presented them to the consideration of that body, and\r\ndeclared that--\r\n\r\n  The length of time since some of the injuries have been committed, the\r\n  repeated and unavailing applications for redress, the wanton character\r\n  of some of the outrages upon the property and persons of our citizens,\r\n  upon the officers and flag of the United States, independent of recent\r\n  insults to this Government and people by the late extraordinary Mexican\r\n  minister, would justify in the eyes of all nations immediate war.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a spirit of kindness and forbearance, however, he recommended\r\nreprisals as a milder mode of redress. He declared that war should not\r\nbe used as a remedy \"by just and generous nations, confiding in their\r\nstrength for injuries committed, if it can be honorably avoided,\" and\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n  It has occurred to me that, considering the present embarrassed\r\n  condition of that country, we should act with both wisdom and moderation\r\n  by giving to Mexico one more opportunity to atone for the past before\r\n  we take redress into our own hands. To avoid all misconception on the\r\n  part of Mexico, as well as to protect our own national character from\r\n  reproach, this opportunity should be given with the avowed design and\r\n  full preparation to take immediate satisfaction if it should not be\r\n  obtained on a repetition of the demand for it. To this end I recommend\r\n  that an act be passed authorizing reprisals, and the use of the naval\r\n  force of the United States by the Executive against Mexico to enforce\r\n  them, in the event of a refusal by the Mexican Government to come to\r\n  an amicable adjustment of the matters in controversy between us upon\r\n  another demand thereof made from on board one of our vessels of war on\r\n  the coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittees of both Houses of Congress, to which this message of the\r\nPresident was referred, fully sustained his views of the character of\r\nthe wrongs which we had suffered from Mexico, and recommended that\r\nanother demand for redress should be made before authorizing war or\r\nreprisals. The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, in their\r\nreport, say:\r\n\r\n  After such a demand, should prompt justice be refused by the Mexican\r\n  Government, we may appeal to all nations, not only for the equity and\r\n  moderation with which we shall have acted toward a sister republic, but\r\n  for the necessity which will then compel us to seek redress for our\r\n  wrongs, either by actual war or by reprisals. The subject will then be\r\n  presented before Congress, at the commencement of the next session, in a\r\n  clear and distinct form, and the committee can not doubt but that such\r\n  measures will be immediately adopted as may be necessary to vindicate\r\n  the honor of the country and insure ample reparation to our injured\r\n  fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives made a\r\nsimilar recommendation. In their report they say that--\r\n\r\n  They fully concur with the President that ample cause exists for taking\r\n  redress into our own hands, and believe that we should be justified in\r\n  the opinion of other nations for taking such a step. But they are\r\n  willing to try the experiment of another demand, made in the most solemn\r\n  form, upon the justice of the Mexican Government before any further\r\n  proceedings are adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo difference of opinion upon the subject is believed to have existed in\r\nCongress at that time; the executive and legislative departments\r\nconcurred; and yet such has been our forbearance and desire to preserve\r\npeace with Mexico that the wrongs of which we then complained, and which\r\ngave rise to these solemn proceedings, not only remain unredressed to\r\nthis day, but additional causes of complaint of an aggravated character\r\nhave ever since been accumulating. Shortly after these proceedings a\r\nspecial messenger was dispatched to Mexico to make a final demand for\r\nredress, and on the 20th of July, 1837, the demand was made. The reply\r\nof the Mexican Government bears date on the 29th of the same month, and\r\ncontains assurances of the \"anxious wish\" of the Mexican Government \"not\r\nto delay the moment of that final and equitable adjustment which is to\r\nterminate the existing difficulties between the two Governments;\" that\r\n\"nothing should be left undone which may contribute to the most speedy\r\nand equitable determination of the subjects which have so seriously\r\nengaged the attention of the American Government;\" that the \"Mexican\r\nGovernment would adopt as the only guides for its conduct the plainest\r\nprinciples of public right, the sacred obligations imposed by\r\ninternational law, and the religious faith of treaties,\" and that\r\n\"whatever reason and justice may dictate respecting each case will be\r\ndone.\" The assurance was further given that the decision of the Mexican\r\nGovernment upon each cause of complaint for which redress had been\r\ndemanded should be communicated to the Government of the United States\r\nby the Mexican minister at Washington.\r\n\r\nThese solemn assurances in answer to our demand for redress were\r\ndisregarded. By making them, however, Mexico obtained further delay.\r\nPresident Van Buren, in his annual message to Congress of the 5th of\r\nDecember, 1837, states that \"although the larger number\" of our demands\r\nfor redress, \"and many of them aggravated cases of personal wrongs, have\r\nbeen now for years before the Mexican Government, and some of the causes\r\nof national complaint, and those of the most offensive character,\r\nadmitted of immediate, simple, and satisfactory replies, it is only\r\nwithin a few days past that any specific communication in answer to our\r\nlast demand, made five months ago, has been received from the Mexican\r\nminister;\" and that \"for not one of our public complaints has\r\nsatisfaction been given or offered, that but one of the cases of\r\npersonal wrong has been favorably considered, and that but four cases of\r\nboth descriptions out of all those formally presented and earnestly\r\npressed have as yet been decided upon by the Mexican Government.\"\r\nPresident Van Buren, believing that it would be vain to make any further\r\nattempt to obtain redress by the ordinary means within the power of the\r\nExecutive, communicated this opinion to Congress in the message referred\r\nto, in which he said:\r\n\r\n  On a careful and deliberate examination of their contents [of the\r\n  correspondence with the Mexican Government], and considering the spirit\r\n  manifested by the Mexican Government, it has become my painful duty to\r\n  return the subject as it now stands to Congress, to whom it belongs to\r\n  decide upon the time, the mode, and the measure of redress.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the United States at that time adopted compulsory measures and taken\r\nredress into their own hands, all our difficulties with Mexico would\r\nprobably have been long since adjusted and the existing war have been\r\naverted. Magnanimity and moderation on our part only had the effect to\r\ncomplicate these difficulties and render an amicable settlement of them\r\nthe more embarrassing. That such measures of redress under similar\r\nprovocations committed by any of the powerful nations of Europe would\r\nhave been promptly resorted to by the United States can not be doubted.\r\nThe national honor and the preservation of the national character\r\nthroughout the world, as well as our own self-respect and the protection\r\ndue to our own citizens, would have rendered such a resort\r\nindispensable. The history of no civilized nation in modern times has\r\npresented within so brief a period so many wanton attacks upon the honor\r\nof its flag and upon the property and persons of its citizens as had at\r\nthat time been borne by the United States from the Mexican authorities\r\nand people. But Mexico was a sister republic on the North American\r\ncontinent, occupying a territory contiguous to our own, and was in a\r\nfeeble and distracted condition, and these considerations, it is\r\npresumed, induced Congress to forbear still longer.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking redress into our own hands, a new negotiation was\r\nentered upon with fair promises on the part of Mexico, but with the\r\nreal purpose, as the event has proved, of indefinitely postponing\r\nthe reparation which we demanded, and which was so justly due. This\r\nnegotiation, after more than a year's delay, resulted in the convention\r\nof the 11th of April, 1839, \"for the adjustment of claims of citizens\r\nof the United States of America upon the Government of the Mexican\r\nRepublic.\" The joint board of commissioners created by this convention\r\nto examine and decide upon these claims was not organized until the\r\nmonth of August, 1840, and under the terms of the convention they were\r\nto terminate their duties within eighteen months from that time. Four\r\nof the eighteen months were consumed in preliminary discussions on\r\nfrivolous and dilatory points raised by the Mexican commissioners, and\r\nit was not until the month of December, 1840, that they commenced the\r\nexamination of the claims of our citizens upon Mexico. Fourteen months\r\nonly remained to examine and decide upon these numerous and complicated\r\ncases. In the month of February, 1842, the term of the commission\r\nexpired, leaving many claims undisposed of for want of time. The claims\r\nwhich were allowed by the board and by the umpire authorized by the\r\nconvention to decide in case of disagreement between the Mexican and\r\nAmerican commissioners amounted to $2,026,139.68. There were pending\r\nbefore the umpire when the commission expired additional claims, which\r\nhad been examined and awarded by the American commissioners and had not\r\nbeen allowed by the Mexican commissioners, amounting to $928,627.88,\r\nupon which he did not decide, alleging that his authority had ceased\r\nwith the termination of the joint commission. Besides these claims,\r\nthere were others of American citizens amounting to $3,336,837.05, which\r\nhad been submitted to the board, and upon which they had not time to\r\ndecide before their final adjournment.\r\n\r\nThe sum of $2,026,139.68, which had been awarded to the claimants, was a\r\nliquidated and ascertained debt due by Mexico, about which there could\r\nbe no dispute, and which she was bound to pay according to the terms of\r\nthe convention. Soon after the final awards for this amount had been\r\nmade the Mexican Government asked for a postponement of the time of\r\nmaking payment, alleging that it would be inconvenient to make the\r\npayment at the time stipulated. In the spirit of forbearing kindness\r\ntoward a sister republic, which Mexico has so long abused, the United\r\nStates promptly complied with her request. A second convention was\r\naccordingly concluded between the two Governments on the 30th of\r\nJanuary, 1843, which upon its face declares that \"this new arrangement\r\nis entered into for the accommodation of Mexico.\" By the terms of this\r\nconvention all the interest due on the awards which had been made in\r\nfavor of the claimants under the convention of the 11th of April, 1839,\r\nwas to be paid to them on the 30th of April, 1843, and \"the principal of\r\nthe said awards and the interest accruing thereon\" was stipulated to\r\n\"be paid in five years, in equal installments every three months.\"\r\nNotwithstanding this new convention was entered into at the request of\r\nMexico and for the purpose of relieving her from embarrassment, the\r\nclaimants have only received the interest due on the 30th of April,\r\n1843, and three of the twenty installments. Although the payment of the\r\nsum thus liquidated and confessedly due by Mexico to our citizens as\r\nindemnity for acknowledged acts of outrage and wrong was secured by\r\ntreaty, the obligations of which are ever held sacred by all just\r\nnations, yet Mexico has violated this solemn engagement by failing and\r\nrefusing to make the payment. The two installments due in April and\r\nJuly, 1844, under the peculiar circumstances connected with them, have\r\nbeen assumed by the United States and discharged to the claimants, but\r\nthey are still due by Mexico. But this is not all of which we have just\r\ncause of complaint. To provide a remedy for the claimants whose cases\r\nwere not decided by the joint commission under the convention of April\r\n11, 1839, it was expressly stipulated by the sixth article of the\r\nconvention of the 30th of January, 1843, that--\r\n\r\n  A new convention shall be entered into for the settlement of all claims\r\n  of the Government and citizens of the United States against the Republic\r\n  of Mexico which were not finally decided by the late commission which\r\n  met in the city of Washington, and of all claims of the Government and\r\n  citizens of Mexico against the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this stipulation, a third convention was concluded\r\nand signed at the city of Mexico on the 20th of November, 1843, by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the two Governments, by which provision was made\r\nfor ascertaining and paying these claims. In January, 1844, this\r\nconvention was ratified by the Senate of the United States with two\r\namendments, which were manifestly reasonable in their character. Upon a\r\nreference of the amendments proposed to the Government of Mexico, the\r\nsame evasions, difficulties, and delays were interposed which have so\r\nlong marked the policy of that Government toward the United States. It\r\nhas not even yet decided whether it would or would not accede to them,\r\nalthough the subject has been repeatedly pressed upon its consideration.\r\nMexico has thus violated a second time the faith of treaties by failing\r\nor refusing to carry into effect the sixth article of the convention of\r\nJanuary, 1843.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of the wrongs which we have suffered and patiently\r\nendured from Mexico through a long series of years. So far from\r\naffording reasonable satisfaction for the injuries and insults we had\r\nborne, a great aggravation of them consists in the fact that while the\r\nUnited States, anxious to preserve a good understanding with Mexico,\r\nhave been constantly but vainly employed in seeking redress for past\r\nwrongs, new outrages were constantly occurring, which have continued to\r\nincrease our causes of complaint and to swell the amount of our demands.\r\nWhile the citizens of the United States were conducting a lawful\r\ncommerce with Mexico under the guaranty of a treaty of \"amity, commerce,\r\nand navigation,\" many of them have suffered all the injuries which would\r\nhave resulted from open war. This treaty, instead of affording\r\nprotection to our citizens, has been the means of inviting them into the\r\nports of Mexico that they might be, as they have been in numerous\r\ninstances, plundered of their property and deprived of their personal\r\nliberty if they dared insist on their rights. Had the unlawful seizures\r\nof American property and the violation of the personal liberty of our\r\ncitizens, to say nothing of the insults to our flag, which have occurred\r\nin the ports of Mexico taken place on the high seas, they would\r\nthemselves long since have constituted a state of actual war between the\r\ntwo countries. In so long suffering Mexico to violate her most solemn\r\ntreaty obligations, plunder our citizens of their property, and imprison\r\ntheir persons without affording them any redress we have failed to\r\nperform one of the first and highest duties which every government owes\r\nto its citizens, and the consequence has been that many of them have\r\nbeen reduced from a state of affluence to bankruptcy. The proud name of\r\nAmerican citizen, which ought to protect all who bear it from insult and\r\ninjury throughout the world, has afforded no such protection to our\r\ncitizens in Mexico. We had ample cause of war against Mexico long before\r\nthe breaking out of hostilities; but even then we forbore to take\r\nredress into our own hands until Mexico herself became the aggressor by\r\ninvading our soil in hostile array and shedding the blood of our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nSuch are the grave causes of complaint on the part of the United States\r\nagainst Mexico--causes which existed long before the annexation of Texas\r\nto the American Union; and yet, animated by the love of peace and a\r\nmagnanimous moderation, we did not adopt those measures of redress which\r\nunder such circumstances are the justified resort of injured nations.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Texas to the United States constituted no just cause\r\nof offense to Mexico. The pretext that it did so is wholly inconsistent\r\nand irreconcilable with well-authenticated facts connected with the\r\nrevolution by which Texas became independent of Mexico. That this may be\r\nthe more manifest, it may be proper to advert to the causes and to the\r\nhistory of the principal events of that revolution.\r\n\r\nTexas constituted a portion of the ancient Province of Louisiana, ceded\r\nto the United States by France in the year 1803. In the year 1819 the\r\nUnited States, by the Florida treaty, ceded to Spain all that part of\r\nLouisiana within the present limits of Texas, and Mexico, by the\r\nrevolution which separated her from Spain and rendered her an\r\nindependent nation, succeeded to the rights of the mother country over\r\nthis territory. In the year 1824 Mexico established a federal\r\nconstitution, under which the Mexican Republic was composed of a number\r\nof sovereign States confederated together in a federal union similar to\r\nour own. Each of these States had its own executive, legislature, and\r\njudiciary, and for all except federal purposes was as independent of the\r\nGeneral Government and that of the other States as is Pennsylvania or\r\nVirginia under our Constitution. Texas and Coahuila united and formed\r\none of these Mexican States. The State constitution which they adopted,\r\nand which was approved by the Mexican Confederacy, asserted that they\r\nwere \"free and independent of the other Mexican United States and of\r\nevery other power and dominion whatsoever,\" and proclaimed the great\r\nprinciple of human liberty that \"the sovereignty of the state resides\r\noriginally and essentially in the general mass of the individuals who\r\ncompose it.\" To the Government under this constitution, as well as to\r\nthat under the federal constitution, the people of Texas owed\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nEmigrants from foreign countries, including the United States, were\r\ninvited by the colonization laws of the State and of the Federal\r\nGovernment to settle in Texas. Advantageous terms were offered to induce\r\nthem to leave their own country and become Mexican citizens. This\r\ninvitation was accepted by many of our citizens in the full faith that\r\nin their new home they would be governed by laws enacted by\r\nrepresentatives elected by themselves, and that their lives, liberty,\r\nand property would be protected by constitutional guaranties similar to\r\nthose which existed in the Republic they had left. Under a Government\r\nthus organized they continued until the year 1835, when a military\r\nrevolution broke out in the City of Mexico which entirely subverted the\r\nfederal and State constitutions and placed a military dictator at the\r\nhead of the Government. By a sweeping decree of a Congress subservient\r\nto the will of the Dictator the several State constitutions were\r\nabolished and the States themselves converted into mere departments of\r\nthe central Government. The people of Texas were unwilling to submit to\r\nthis usurpation. Resistance to such tyranny became a high duty. Texas\r\nwas fully absolved from all allegiance to the central Government of\r\nMexico from the moment that Government had abolished her State\r\nconstitution and in its place substituted an arbitrary and despotic\r\ncentral government. Such were the principal causes of the Texan\r\nrevolution. The people of Texas at once determined upon resistance and\r\nflew to arms. In the midst of these important and exciting events,\r\nhowever, they did not omit to place their liberties upon a secure and\r\npermanent foundation. They elected members to a convention, who in the\r\nmonth of March, 1836, issued a formal declaration that their \"political\r\nconnection with the Mexican nation has forever ended, and that the\r\npeople of Texas do now constitute a _free, sovereign, and independent\r\nRepublic_, and are fully invested with all the rights and attributes\r\nwhich properly belong to independent nations.\" They also adopted for\r\ntheir government a liberal republican constitution. About the same time\r\nSanta Anna, then the Dictator of Mexico, invaded Texas with a numerous\r\narmy for the purpose of subduing her people and enforcing obedience to\r\nhis arbitrary and despotic Government. On the 21st of April, 1836, he\r\nwas met by the Texan citizen soldiers, and on that day was achieved by\r\nthem the memorable victory of San Jacinto, by which they conquered their\r\nindependence. Considering the numbers engaged on the respective sides,\r\nhistory does not record a more brilliant achievement. Santa Anna himself\r\nwas among the captives.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1836, Santa Anna acknowledged by a treaty with the\r\nTexan authorities in the most solemn form \"the full, entire, and perfect\r\nindependence of the Republic of Texas.\" It is true he was then a\r\nprisoner of war, but it is equally true that he had failed to reconquer\r\nTexas, and had met with signal defeat; that his authority had not been\r\nrevoked, and that by virtue of this treaty he obtained his personal\r\nrelease. By it hostilities were suspended, and the army which had\r\ninvaded Texas under his command returned in pursuance of this\r\narrangement unmolested to Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrom the day that the battle of San Jacinto was fought until the present\r\nhour Mexico has never possessed the power to reconquer Texas. In the\r\nlanguage of the Secretary of State of the United States in a dispatch to\r\nour minister in Mexico under date of the 8th of July, 1842--\r\n\r\n  Mexico may have chosen to consider, and may still choose to consider,\r\n  Texas as having been at all times since 1835, and as still continuing,\r\n  a rebellious province; but the world has been obliged to take a very\r\n  different view of the matter. From the time of the battle of San\r\n  Jacinto, in April, 1836, to the present moment, Texas has exhibited the\r\n  same external signs of national independence as Mexico herself, and with\r\n  quite as much stability of government. Practically free and independent,\r\n  acknowledged as a political sovereignty by the principal powers of the\r\n  world, no hostile foot finding rest within her territory for six or\r\n  seven years, and Mexico herself refraining for all that period from any\r\n  further attempt to reestablish her own authority over that territory,\r\n  it can not but be surprising to find Mr. De Bocanegra [the secretary\r\n  of foreign affairs of Mexico] complaining that for that whole period\r\n  citizens of the United States or its Government have been favoring the\r\n  rebels of Texas and supplying them with vessels, ammunition, and money,\r\n  as if the war for the reduction of the Province of Texas had been\r\n  constantly prosecuted by Mexico, and her success prevented by these\r\n  influences from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same dispatch the Secretary of State affirms that--\r\n\r\n  Since 1837 the United States have regarded Texas as an independent\r\n  sovereignty as much as Mexico, and that trade and commerce with citizens\r\n  of a government at war with Mexico can not on that account be regarded\r\n  as an intercourse by which assistance and succor are given to Mexican\r\n  rebels. The whole current of Mr. De Bocanegra's remarks runs in the same\r\n  direction, as if the independence of Texas had not been acknowledged.\r\n  It has been acknowledged; it was acknowledged in 1837 against the\r\n  remonstrance and protest of Mexico, and most of the acts of any\r\n  importance of which Mr. De Bocanegra complains flow necessarily from\r\n  that recognition. He speaks of Texas as still being \"an integral part of\r\n  the territory of the Mexican Republic,\" but he can not but understand\r\n  that the United States do not so regard it. The real complaint of\r\n  Mexico, therefore, is in substance neither more nor less than a\r\n  complaint against the recognition of Texan independence. It may be\r\n  thought rather late to repeat that complaint, and not quite just to\r\n  confine it to the United States to the exemption of England, France, and\r\n  Belgium, unless the United States, having been the first to acknowledge\r\n  the independence of Mexico herself, are to be blamed for setting an\r\n  example for the recognition of that of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he added that--\r\n\r\n  The Constitution, public treaties, and the laws oblige the President to\r\n  regard Texas as an independent state, and its territory as no part of\r\n  the territory of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nTexas had been an independent state, with an organized government,\r\ndefying the power of Mexico to overthrow or reconquer her, for more than\r\nten years before Mexico commenced the present war against the United\r\nStates. Texas had given such evidence to the world of her ability to\r\nmaintain her separate existence as an independent nation that she had\r\nbeen formally recognized as such not only by the United States, but by\r\nseveral of the principal powers of Europe. These powers had entered into\r\ntreaties of amity, commerce, and navigation with her. They had received\r\nand accredited her ministers and other diplomatic agents at their\r\nrespective courts, and they had commissioned ministers and diplomatic\r\nagents on their part to the Government of Texas. If Mexico,\r\nnotwithstanding all this and her utter inability to subdue or reconquer\r\nTexas, still stubbornly refused to recognize her as an independent\r\nnation, she was none the less so on that account. Mexico herself had\r\nbeen recognized as an independent nation by the United States and by\r\nother powers many years before Spain, of which before her revolution she\r\nhad been a colony, would agree to recognize her as such; and yet Mexico\r\nwas at that time in the estimation of the civilized world, and in fact,\r\nnone the less an independent power because Spain still claimed her as a\r\ncolony. If Spain had continued until the present period to assert that\r\nMexico was one of her colonies in rebellion against her, this would not\r\nhave made her so or changed the fact of her independent existence. Texas\r\nat the period of her annexation to the United States bore the same\r\nrelation to Mexico that Mexico had borne to Spain for many years before\r\nSpain acknowledged her independence, with this important difference,\r\nthat before the annexation of Texas to the United States was consummated\r\nMexico herself, by a formal act of her Government, had acknowledged the\r\nindependence of Texas as a nation. It is true that in the act of\r\nrecognition she prescribed a condition which she had no power or\r\nauthority to impose--that Texas should not annex herself to any other\r\npower--but this could not detract in any degree from the recognition\r\nwhich Mexico then made of her actual independence. Upon this plain\r\nstatement of facts, it is absurd for Mexico to allege as a pretext for\r\ncommencing hostilities against the United States that Texas is still a\r\npart of her territory.\r\n\r\nBut there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the\r\nground that the true western boundary of Texas is the Nueces instead of\r\nthe Rio Grande, and that therefore in marching our Army to the east bank\r\nof the latter river we passed the Texan line and invaded the territory\r\nof Mexico. A simple statement of facts known to exist will conclusively\r\nrefute such an assumption. Texas, as ceded to the United States by\r\nFrance in 1803, has been always claimed as extending west to the Rio\r\nGrande or Rio Bravo. This fact is established by the authority of our\r\nmost eminent statesmen at a period when the question was as well, if not\r\nbetter, understood than it is at present. During Mr. Jefferson's\r\nAdministration Messrs. Monroe and Pinckney, who had been sent on a\r\nspecial mission to Madrid, charged among other things with the\r\nadjustment of boundary between the two countries, in a note addressed to\r\nthe Spanish minister of foreign affairs under date of the 28th of\r\nJanuary, 1805, assert that the boundaries of Louisiana, as ceded to the\r\nUnited States by France, \"are the river Perdido on the east and the\r\nriver Bravo on the west,\" and they add that \"the facts and principles\r\nwhich justify this conclusion are so satisfactory to our Government as\r\nto convince it that the United States have not a better right to the\r\nisland of New Orleans under the cession referred to than they have to\r\nthe whole district of territory which is above described.\" Down to the\r\nconclusion of the Florida treaty, in February, 1819, by which this\r\nterritory was ceded to Spain, the United States asserted and maintained\r\ntheir territorial rights to this extent. In the month of June, 1818,\r\nduring Mr. Monroe's Administration, information having been received\r\nthat a number of foreign adventurers had landed at Galveston with the\r\navowed purpose of forming a settlement in that vicinity, a special\r\nmessenger was dispatched by the Government of the United States with\r\ninstructions from the Secretary of State to warn them to desist, should\r\nthey be found there, \"or any other place north of the Rio Bravo, and\r\nwithin the territory claimed by the United States.\" He was instructed,\r\nshould they be found in the country north of that river, to make known\r\nto them \"the surprise with which the President has seen possession thus\r\ntaken, without authority from the United States, of a place within their\r\nterritorial limits, and upon which no lawful settlement can be made\r\nwithout their sanction.\" He was instructed to call upon them to \"avow\r\nunder what national authority they profess to act,\" and to give them due\r\nwarning \"that the place is within the United States, who will suffer no\r\npermanent settlement to be made there under any authority other than\r\ntheir own.\" As late as the 8th of July, 1842, the Secretary of State of\r\nthe United States, in a note addressed to our minister in Mexico,\r\nmaintains that by the Florida treaty of 1819 the territory as far west\r\nas the Rio Grande was confirmed to Spain. In that note he states that--\r\n\r\n  By the treaty of the 22d of February, 1819, between the United States\r\n  and Spain, the Sabine was adopted as the line of boundary between the\r\n  two powers. Up to that period no considerable colonization had been\r\n  effected in Texas; but the territory between the Sabine and the Rio\r\n  Grande being confirmed to Spain by the treaty, applications were made\r\n  to that power for grants of land, and such grants or permissions of\r\n  settlement were in fact made by the Spanish authorities in favor of\r\n  citizens of the United States proposing to emigrate to _Texas_ in\r\n  numerous families before the declaration of independence by Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Texas which was ceded to Spain by the Florida treaty of 1819\r\nembraced all the country now claimed by the State of Texas between the\r\nNueces and the Rio Grande. The Republic of Texas always claimed this\r\nriver as her western boundary, and in her treaty made with Santa Anna in\r\nMay, 1836, he recognized it as such. By the constitution which Texas\r\nadopted in March, 1836, senatorial and representative districts were\r\norganized extending west of the Nueces. The Congress of Texas on the\r\n19th of December, 1836, passed \"An act to define the boundaries of the\r\nRepublic of Texas,\" in which they declared the Rio Grande from its mouth\r\nto its source to be their boundary, and by the said act they extended\r\ntheir \"civil and political jurisdiction\" over the country up to that\r\nboundary. During a period of more than nine years which intervened\r\nbetween the adoption of her constitution and her annexation as one of\r\nthe States of our Union Texas asserted and exercised many acts of\r\nsovereignty and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants west of\r\nthe Nueces. She organized and defined the limits of counties extending\r\nto the Rio Grande; she established courts of justice and extended her\r\njudicial system over the territory; she established a custom-house and\r\ncollected duties, and also post-offices and post-roads, in it; she\r\nestablished a land office and issued numerous grants for land within its\r\nlimits; a senator and a representative residing in it were elected to\r\nthe Congress of the Republic and served as such before the act of\r\nannexation took place. In both the Congress and convention of Texas\r\nwhich gave their assent to the terms of annexation to the United States\r\nproposed by our Congress were representatives residing west of the\r\nNueces, who took part in the act of annexation itself. This was the\r\nTexas which by the act of our Congress of the 29th of December, 1845,\r\nwas admitted as one of the States of our Union. That the Congress of the\r\nUnited States understood the State of Texas which they admitted into the\r\nUnion to extend beyond the Nueces is apparent from the fact that on the\r\n31st of December, 1845, only two days after the act of admission, they\r\npassed a law \"to establish a collection district in the State of Texas,\"\r\nby which they created a port of delivery at Corpus Christi, situated\r\nwest of the Nueces, and being the same point at which the Texas\r\ncustom-house under the laws of that Republic had been located, and\r\ndirected that a surveyor to collect the revenue should be appointed for\r\nthat port by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate. A surveyor was accordingly nominated, and confirmed by the\r\nSenate, and has been ever since in the performance of his duties. All\r\nthese acts of the Republic of Texas and of our Congress preceded the\r\norders for the advance of our Army to the east bank of the Rio Grande.\r\nSubsequently Congress passed an act \"establishing certain post routes\"\r\nextending west of the Nueces. The country west of that river now\r\nconstitutes a part of one of the Congressional districts of Texas and is\r\nrepresented in the House of Representatives. The Senators from that\r\nState were chosen by a legislature in which the country west of that\r\nriver was represented. In view of all these facts it is difficult to\r\nconceive upon what ground it can be maintained that in occupying the\r\ncountry west of the Nueces with our Army, with a view solely to its\r\nsecurity and defense, we invaded the territory of Mexico. But it would\r\nhave been still more difficult to justify the Executive, whose duty it\r\nis to see that the laws be faithfully executed, if in the face of all\r\nthese proceedings, both of the Congress of Texas and of the United\r\nStates, he had assumed the responsibility of yielding up the territory\r\nwest of the Nueces to Mexico or of refusing to protect and defend this\r\nterritory and its inhabitants, including Corpus Christi as well as the\r\nremainder of Texas, against the threatened Mexican invasion.\r\n\r\nBut Mexico herself has never placed the war which she has waged upon the\r\nground that our Army occupied the intermediate territory between the\r\nNueces and the Rio Grande. Her refuted pretension that Texas was not in\r\nfact an independent state, but a rebellious province, was obstinately\r\npersevered in, and her avowed purpose in commencing a war with the\r\nUnited States was to reconquer Texas and to restore Mexican authority\r\nover the whole territory--not to the Nueces only, but to the Sabine. In\r\nview of the proclaimed menaces of Mexico to this effect, I deemed it my\r\nduty, as a measure of precaution and defense, to order our Army to\r\noccupy a position on our frontier as a military post, from which our\r\ntroops could best resist and repel any attempted invasion which Mexico\r\nmight make. Our Army had occupied a position at Corpus Christi, west of\r\nthe Nueces, as early as August, 1845, without complaint from any\r\nquarter. Had the Nueces been regarded as the true western boundary of\r\nTexas, that boundary had been passed by our Army many months before it\r\nadvanced to the eastern bank of the Rio Grande. In my annual message of\r\nDecember last I informed Congress that upon the invitation of both the\r\nCongress and convention of Texas I had deemed it proper to order a\r\nstrong squadron to the coasts of Mexico and to concentrate an efficient\r\nmilitary force on the western frontier of Texas to protect and defend\r\nthe inhabitants against the menaced invasion of Mexico. In that message\r\nI informed Congress that the moment the terms of annexation offered by\r\nthe United States were accepted by Texas the latter became so far a part\r\nof our own country as to make it our duty to afford such protection and\r\ndefense, and that for that purpose our squadron had been ordered to the\r\nGulf and our Army to take a \"position between the Nueces and the Del\r\nNorte\" or Rio Grande and to \"repel any invasion of the Texan territory\r\nwhich might be attempted by the Mexican forces.\"\r\n\r\nIt was deemed proper to issue this order, because soon after the\r\nPresident of Texas, in April, 1845, had issued his proclamation\r\nconvening the Congress of that Republic for the purpose of submitting to\r\nthat body the terms of annexation proposed by the United States the\r\nGovernment of Mexico made serious threats of invading the Texan\r\nterritory. These threats became more imposing as it became more apparent\r\nin the progress of the question that the people of Texas would decide in\r\nfavor of accepting the terms of annexation, and finally they had assumed\r\nsuch a formidable character as induced both the Congress and convention\r\nof Texas to request that a military force should be sent by the United\r\nStates into her territory for the purpose of protecting and defending\r\nher against the threatened invasion. It would have been a violation of\r\ngood faith toward the people of Texas to have refused to afford the aid\r\nwhich they desired against a threatened invasion to which they had been\r\nexposed by their free determination to annex themselves to our Union in\r\ncompliance with the overture made to them by the joint resolution of our\r\nCongress. Accordingly, a portion of the Army was ordered to advance into\r\nTexas. Corpus Christi was the position selected by General Taylor. He\r\nencamped at that place in August, 1845, and the Army remained in that\r\nposition until the 11th of March, 1846, when it moved westward, and on\r\nthe 28th of that month reached the east bank of the Rio Grande opposite\r\nto Matamoras. This movement was made in pursuance of orders from the War\r\nDepartment, issued on the 13th of January, 1846. Before these orders\r\nwere issued the dispatch of our minister in Mexico transmitting the\r\ndecision of the council of government of Mexico advising that he should\r\nnot be received, and also the dispatch of our consul residing in the\r\nCity of Mexico, the former bearing date on the 17th and the latter on\r\nthe 18th of December, 1845, copies of both of which accompanied my\r\nmessage to Congress of the 11th of May last, were received at the\r\nDepartment of State. These communications rendered it highly probable,\r\nif not absolutely certain, that our minister would not be received by\r\nthe Government of General Herrera. It was also well known that but\r\nlittle hope could be entertained of a different result from General\r\nParedes in case the revolutionary movement which he was prosecuting\r\nshould prove successful, as was highly probable. The partisans of\r\nParedes, as our minister in the dispatch referred to states, breathed\r\nthe fiercest hostility against the United States, denounced the proposed\r\nnegotiation as treason, and openly called upon the troops and the people\r\nto put down the Government of Herrera by force. The reconquest of Texas\r\nand war with the United States were openly threatened. These were the\r\ncircumstances existing when it was deemed proper to order the Army under\r\nthe command of General Taylor to advance to the western frontier of\r\nTexas and occupy a position on or near the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of a contemplated Mexican invasion have been since\r\nfully justified by the event. The determination of Mexico to rush into\r\nhostilities with the United States was afterwards manifested from the\r\nwhole tenor of the note of the Mexican minister of foreign affairs to\r\nour minister bearing date on the 12th of March, 1846. Paredes had then\r\nrevolutionized the Government, and his minister, after referring to the\r\nresolution for the annexation of Texas which had been adopted by our\r\nCongress in March, 1845, proceeds to declare that--\r\n\r\n  A fact such as this, or, to speak with greater exactness, so notable an\r\n  act of usurpation, created an imperious necessity that Mexico, for her\r\n  own honor, should repel it with proper firmness and dignity. The supreme\r\n  Government had beforehand declared that it would look upon such an act\r\n  as a _casus belli_, and as a consequence of this declaration negotiation\r\n  was by its very nature at an end, and war was the only recourse of the\r\n  Mexican Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears also that on the 4th of April following General Paredes,\r\nthrough his minister of war, issued orders to the Mexican general in\r\ncommand on the Texan frontier to \"attack\" our Army \"by every means which\r\nwar permits.\" To this General Paredes had been pledged to the army and\r\npeople of Mexico during the military revolution which had brought him\r\ninto power. On the 18th of April, 1846, General Paredes addressed a\r\nletter to the commander on that frontier in which he stated to him: \"At\r\nthe present date I suppose you, at the head of that valiant army, either\r\nfighting already or preparing for the operations of a campaign;\" and,\r\n\"Supposing you already on the theater of operations and with all the\r\nforces assembled, it is indispensable that hostilities be commenced,\r\nyourself taking the initiative against the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe movement of our Army to the Rio Grande was made by the commanding\r\ngeneral under positive orders to abstain from all aggressive acts toward\r\nMexico or Mexican citizens, and to regard the relations between the two\r\ncountries as peaceful unless Mexico should declare war or commit acts of\r\nhostility indicative of a state of war, and these orders he faithfully\r\nexecuted. Whilst occupying his position on the east bank of the Rio\r\nGrande, within the limits of Texas, then recently admitted as one of the\r\nStates of our Union, the commanding general of the Mexican forces, who,\r\nin pursuance of the orders of his Government, had collected a large army\r\non the opposite shore of the Rio Grande, crossed the river, invaded our\r\nterritory, and commenced hostilities by attacking our forces. Thus,\r\nafter all the injuries which we had received and borne from Mexico, and\r\nafter she had insultingly rejected a minister sent to her on a mission\r\nof peace, and whom she had solemnly agreed to receive, she consummated\r\nher long course of outrage against our country by commencing an\r\noffensive war and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil.\r\n\r\nThe United States never attempted to acquire Texas by conquest. On the\r\ncontrary, at an early period after the people of Texas had achieved\r\ntheir independence they sought to be annexed to the United States. At a\r\ngeneral election in September, 1836, they decided with great unanimity\r\nin favor of \"annexation,\" and in November following the Congress of the\r\nRepublic authorized the appointment of a minister to bear their request\r\nto this Government. This Government, however, having remained neutral\r\nbetween Texas and Mexico during the war between them, and considering it\r\ndue to the honor of our country and our fair fame among the nations of\r\nthe earth that we should not at this early period consent to annexation,\r\nnor until it should be manifest to the whole world that the reconquest\r\nof Texas by Mexico was impossible, refused to accede to the overtures\r\nmade by Texas. On the 12th of April, 1844, after more than seven years\r\nhad elapsed since Texas had established her independence, a treaty was\r\nconcluded for the annexation of that Republic to the United States,\r\nwhich was rejected by the Senate. Finally, on the 1st of March, 1845,\r\nCongress passed a joint resolution for annexing her to the United States\r\nupon certain preliminary conditions to which her assent was required.\r\nThe solemnities which characterized the deliberations and conduct of the\r\nGovernment and people of Texas on the deeply interesting questions\r\npresented by these resolutions are known to the world. The Congress, the\r\nExecutive, and the people of Texas, in a convention elected for that\r\npurpose, accepted with great unanimity the proposed terms of annexation,\r\nand thus consummated on her part the great act of restoring to our\r\nFederal Union a vast territory which had been ceded to Spain by the\r\nFlorida treaty more than a quarter of a century before.\r\n\r\nAfter the joint resolution for the annexation of Texas to the United\r\nStates had been passed by our Congress the Mexican minister at\r\nWashington addressed a note to the Secretary of State, bearing date on\r\nthe 6th of March, 1845, protesting against it as \"an act of aggression\r\nthe most unjust which can be found recorded in the annals of modern\r\nhistory, namely, that of despoiling a friendly nation like Mexico of a\r\nconsiderable portion of her territory,\" and protesting against the\r\nresolution of annexation as being an act \"whereby the Province of Texas,\r\nan integral portion of the Mexican territory, is agreed and admitted\r\ninto the American Union;\" and he announced that as a consequence his\r\nmission to the United States had terminated, and demanded his passports,\r\nwhich were granted. It was upon the absurd pretext, made by Mexico\r\n(herself indebted for her independence to a successful revolution), that\r\nthe Republic of Texas still continued to be, notwithstanding all that\r\nhad passed, a Province of Mexico that this step was taken by the Mexican\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nEvery honorable effort has been used by me to avoid the war which\r\nfollowed, but all have proved vain. All our attempts to preserve peace\r\nhave been met by insult and resistance on the part of Mexico. My efforts\r\nto this end commenced in the note of the Secretary of State of the 10th\r\nof March, 1845, in answer to that of the Mexican minister. Whilst\r\ndeclining to reopen a discussion which had already been exhausted, and\r\nproving again what was known to the whole world, that Texas had long\r\nsince achieved her independence, the Secretary of State expressed the\r\nregret of this Government that Mexico should have taken offense at the\r\nresolution of annexation passed by Congress, and gave assurance that our\r\n\"most strenuous efforts shall be devoted to the amicable adjustment of\r\nevery cause of complaint between the two Governments and to the\r\ncultivation of the kindest and most friendly relations between the\r\nsister Republics.\" That I have acted in the spirit of this assurance\r\nwill appear from the events which have since occurred. Notwithstanding\r\nMexico had abruptly terminated all diplomatic intercourse with the\r\nUnited States, and ought, therefore, to have been the first to ask for\r\nits resumption, yet, waiving all ceremony, I embraced the earliest\r\nfavorable opportunity \"to ascertain from the Mexican Government whether\r\nthey would receive an envoy from the United States intrusted With full\r\npower to adjust all the questions in dispute between the two\r\nGovernments.\" In September, 1845, I believed the propitious moment for\r\nsuch an overture had arrived. Texas, by the enthusiastic and almost\r\nunanimous will of her people, had pronounced in favor of annexation.\r\nMexico herself had agreed to acknowledge the independence of Texas,\r\nsubject to a condition, it is true, which she had no right to impose and\r\nno power to enforce. The last lingering hope of Mexico, if she still\r\ncould have retained any, that Texas would ever again become one of her\r\nProvinces, must have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe consul of the United States at the City of Mexico was therefore\r\ninstructed by the Secretary of State on the 15th of September, 1845, to\r\nmake the inquiry of the Mexican Government. The inquiry was made, and\r\non the 15th of October, 1845, the minister of foreign affairs of the\r\nMexican Government, in a note addressed to our consul, gave a favorable\r\nresponse, requesting at the same time that our naval force might be\r\nwithdrawn from Vera Cruz while negotiations should be pending. Upon the\r\nreceipt of this note our naval force was promptly withdrawn from Vera\r\nCruz. A minister was immediately appointed, and departed to Mexico.\r\nEverything bore a promising aspect for a speedy and peaceful adjustment\r\nof all our difficulties. At the date of my annual message to Congress in\r\nDecember last no doubt was entertained but that he would be received by\r\nthe Mexican Government, and the hope was cherished that all cause of\r\nmisunderstanding between the two countries would be speedily removed.\r\nIn the confident hope that such would be the result of his mission,\r\nI informed Congress that I forbore at that time to \"recommend such\r\nulterior measures of redress for the wrongs and injuries we had so long\r\nborne as it would have been proper to make had no such negotiation been\r\ninstituted.\" To my surprise and regret the Mexican Government, though\r\nsolemnly pledged to do so, upon the arrival of our minister in Mexico\r\nrefused to receive and accredit him. When he reached Vera Cruz, on\r\nthe 30th of November, 1845, he found that the aspect of affairs had\r\nundergone an unhappy change. The Government of General Herrera, who was\r\nat that time President of the Republic, was tottering to its fall.\r\nGeneral Paredes, a military leader, had manifested his determination to\r\noverthrow the Government of Herrera by a military revolution, and one of\r\nthe principal means which he employed to effect his purpose and render\r\nthe Government of Herrera odious to the army and people of Mexico was by\r\nloudly condemning its determination to receive a minister of peace from\r\nthe United States, alleging that it was the intention of Herrera, by a\r\ntreaty with the United States, to dismember the territory of Mexico by\r\nceding away the department of Texas. The Government of Herrera is\r\nbelieved to have been well disposed to a pacific adjustment of existing\r\ndifficulties, but probably alarmed for its own security, and in order\r\nto ward off the danger of the revolution led by Paredes, violated its\r\nsolemn agreement and refused to receive or accredit our minister; and\r\nthis although informed that he had been invested with full power to\r\nadjust all questions in dispute between the two Governments. Among the\r\nfrivolous pretexts for this refusal, the principal one was that our\r\nminister had not gone upon a special mission confined to the question of\r\nTexas alone, leaving all the outrages upon our flag and our citizens\r\nunredressed. The Mexican Government well knew that both our national\r\nhonor and the protection due to our citizens imperatively required that\r\nthe two questions of boundary and indemnity should be treated of\r\ntogether, as naturally and inseparably blended, and they ought to have\r\nseen that this course was best calculated to enable the United States to\r\nextend to them the most liberal justice. On the 30th of December, 1845,\r\nGeneral Herrera resigned the Presidency and yielded up the Government to\r\nGeneral Paredes without a struggle. Thus a revolution was accomplished\r\nsolely by the army commanded by Paredes, and the supreme power in Mexico\r\npassed into the hands of a military usurper who was known to be bitterly\r\nhostile to the United States.\r\n\r\nAlthough the prospect of a pacific adjustment with the new Government\r\nwas unpromising from the known hostility of its head to the United\r\nStates, yet, determined that nothing should be left undone on our part\r\nto restore friendly relations between the two countries, our minister\r\nwas instructed to present his credentials to the new Government and ask\r\nto be accredited by it in the diplomatic character in which he had been\r\ncommissioned. These instructions he executed by his note of the 1st of\r\nMarch, 1846, addressed to the Mexican minister of foreign affairs, but\r\nhis request was insultingly refused by that minister in his answer of\r\nthe 12th of the same month. No alternative remained for our minister but\r\nto demand his passports and return to the United States.\r\n\r\nThus was the extraordinary spectacle presented to the civilized world of\r\na Government, in violation of its own express agreement, having twice\r\nrejected a minister of peace invested with full powers to adjust all\r\nthe existing differences between the two countries in a manner just\r\nand honorable to both. I am not aware that modern history presents a\r\nparallel case in which in time of peace one nation has refused even to\r\nhear propositions from another for terminating existing difficulties\r\nbetween them. Scarcely a hope of adjusting our difficulties, even at a\r\nremote day, or of preserving peace with Mexico, could be cherished while\r\nParedes remained at the head of the Government. He had acquired the\r\nsupreme power by a military revolution and upon the most solemn pledges\r\nto wage war against the United States and to reconquer Texas, which he\r\nclaimed as a revolted province of Mexico. He had denounced as guilty\r\nof treason all those Mexicans who considered Texas as no longer\r\nconstituting a part of the territory of Mexico and who were friendly to\r\nthe cause of peace. The duration of the war which he waged against the\r\nUnited States was indefinite, because the end which he proposed of the\r\nreconquest of Texas was hopeless. Besides, there was good reason to\r\nbelieve from all his conduct that it was his intention to convert the\r\nRepublic of Mexico into a monarchy and to call a foreign European prince\r\nto the throne. Preparatory to this end, he had during his short rule\r\ndestroyed the liberty of the press, tolerating that portion of it only\r\nwhich openly advocated the establishment of a monarchy. The better to\r\nsecure the success of his ultimate designs, he had by an arbitrary\r\ndecree convoked a Congress, not to be elected by the free voice of the\r\npeople, but to be chosen in a manner to make them subservient to his\r\nwill and to give him absolute control over their deliberations.\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances it was believed that any revolution in\r\nMexico founded upon opposition to the ambitious projects of Paredes\r\nwould tend to promote the cause of peace as well as prevent any\r\nattempted European interference in the affairs of the North American\r\ncontinent, both objects of deep interest to the United States. Any such\r\nforeign interference, if attempted, must have been resisted by the\r\nUnited States. My views upon that subject were fully communicated to\r\nCongress in my last annual message. In any event, it was certain that no\r\nchange whatever in the Government of Mexico which would deprive Paredes\r\nof power could be for the worse so far as the United States were\r\nconcerned, while it was highly probable that any change must be for the\r\nbetter. This was the state of affairs existing when Congress, on the\r\n13th of May last, recognized the existence of the war which had been\r\ncommenced by the Government of Paredes; and it became an object of much\r\nimportance, with a view to a speedy settlement of our difficulties and\r\nthe restoration of an honorable peace, that Paredes should not retain\r\npower in Mexico.\r\n\r\nBefore that time there were symptoms of a revolution in Mexico, favored,\r\nas it was understood to be, by the more liberal party, and especially by\r\nthose who were opposed to foreign interference and to the monarchical\r\nform of government. Santa Anna was then in exile in Havana, having been\r\nexpelled from power and banished from his country by a revolution which\r\noccurred in December, 1844; but it was known that he had still a\r\nconsiderable party in his favor in Mexico. It was also equally well\r\nknown that no vigilance which could be exerted by our squadron would in\r\nall probability have prevented him from effecting a landing somewhere\r\non the extensive Gulf coast of Mexico if he desired to return to his\r\ncountry. He had openly professed an entire change of policy, had\r\nexpressed his regret that he had subverted the federal constitution of\r\n1824, and avowed that he was now in favor of its restoration. He had\r\npublicly declared his hostility, in strongest terms, to the\r\nestablishment of a monarchy and to European interference in the affairs\r\nof his country. Information to this effect had been received, from\r\nsources believed to be reliable, at the date of the recognition of the\r\nexistence of the war by Congress, and was afterwards fully confirmed by\r\nthe receipt of the dispatch of our consul in the City of Mexico, with\r\nthe accompanying documents, which are herewith transmitted. Besides, it\r\nwas reasonable to suppose that he must see the ruinous consequences to\r\nMexico of a war with the United States, and that it would be his\r\ninterest to favor peace.\r\n\r\nIt was under these circumstances and upon these considerations that it\r\nwas deemed expedient not to obstruct his return to Mexico should he\r\nattempt to do so. Our object was the restoration of peace, and, with\r\nthat view, no reason was perceived why we should take part with Paredes\r\nand aid him by means of our blockade in preventing the return of his\r\nrival to Mexico. On the contrary, it was believed that the intestine\r\ndivisions which ordinary sagacity could not but anticipate as the fruit\r\nof Santa Anna's return to Mexico, and his contest with Paredes, might\r\nstrongly tend to produce a disposition with both parties to restore and\r\npreserve peace with the United States. Paredes was a soldier by\r\nprofession and a monarchist in principle. He had but recently before\r\nbeen successful in a military revolution, by which he had obtained\r\npower. He was the sworn enemy of the United States, with which he had\r\ninvolved his country in the existing war. Santa Anna had been expelled\r\nfrom power by the army, was known to be in open hostility to Paredes,\r\nand publicly pledged against foreign intervention and the restoration of\r\nmonarchy in Mexico. In view of these facts and circumstances it was that\r\nwhen orders were issued to the commander of our naval forces in the\r\nGulf, on the 13th day of May last, the same day on which the existence\r\nof the war was recognized by Congress, to place the coasts of Mexico\r\nunder blockade, he was directed not to obstruct the passage of Santa\r\nAnna to Mexico should he attempt to return.\r\n\r\nA revolution took place in Mexico in the early part of August following,\r\nby which the power of Paredes was overthrown, and he has since been\r\nbanished from the country, and is now in exile. Shortly afterwards Santa\r\nAnna returned. It remains to be seen whether his return may not yet\r\nprove to be favorable to a pacific adjustment of the existing\r\ndifficulties, it being manifestly his interest not to persevere in the\r\nprosecution of a war commenced by Paredes to accomplish a purpose so\r\nabsurd as the reconquest of Texas to the Sabine. Had Paredes remained in\r\npower, it is morally certain that any pacific adjustment would have been\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nUpon the commencement of hostilities by Mexico against the United States\r\nthe indignant spirit of the nation was at once aroused. Congress\r\npromptly responded to the expectations of the country, and by the act of\r\nthe 13th of May last recognized the fact that war existed, by the act of\r\nMexico, between the United States and that Republic, and granted the\r\nmeans necessary for its vigorous prosecution. Being involved in a war\r\nthus commenced by Mexico, and for the justice of which on our part we\r\nmay confidently appeal to the whole world, I resolved to prosecute it\r\nwith the utmost vigor. Accordingly the ports of Mexico on the Gulf and\r\non the Pacific have been placed under blockade and her territory invaded\r\nat several important points. The reports from the Departments of War and\r\nof the Navy will inform you more in detail of the measures adopted in\r\nthe emergency in which our country was placed and of the gratifying\r\nresults which have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe various columns of the Army have performed their duty under great\r\ndisadvantages with the most distinguished skill and courage. The\r\nvictories of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and of Monterey, won\r\nagainst greatly superior numbers and against most decided advantages in\r\nother respects on the part of the enemy, were brilliant in their\r\nexecution, and entitle our brave officers and soldiers to the grateful\r\nthanks of their country. The nation deplores the loss of the brave\r\nofficers and men who have gallantly fallen while vindicating and\r\ndefending their country's rights and honor.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of pride and satisfaction that our volunteer citizen\r\nsoldiers, who so promptly responded to their country's call, with an\r\nexperience of the discipline of a camp of only a few weeks, have borne\r\ntheir part in the hard-fought battle of Monterey with a constancy and\r\ncourage equal to that of veteran troops and worthy of the highest\r\nadmiration. The privations of long marches through the enemy's country\r\nand through a wilderness have been borne without a murmur. By rapid\r\nmovements the Province of New Mexico, with Santa Fe, its capital, has\r\nbeen captured without bloodshed. The Navy has cooperated with the Army\r\nand rendered important services; if not so brilliant, it is because the\r\nenemy had no force to meet them on their own element and because of the\r\ndefenses which nature has interposed in the difficulties of the\r\nnavigation on the Mexican coast. Our squadron in the Pacific, with the\r\ncooperation of a gallant officer of the Army and a small force hastily\r\ncollected in that distant country, has acquired bloodless possession of\r\nthe Californias, and the American flag has been raised at every\r\nimportant point in that Province.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the success which has thus attended our military\r\nand naval operations. In less than seven months after Mexico commenced\r\nhostilities, at a time selected by herself, we have taken possession of\r\nmany of her principal ports, driven back and pursued her invading army,\r\nand acquired military possession of the Mexican Provinces of New Mexico,\r\nNew Leon, Coahuila, Tamaulipas, and the Californias, a territory larger\r\nin extent than that embraced in the original thirteen States of the\r\nUnion, inhabited by a considerable population, and much of it more than\r\n1,000 miles from the points at which we had to collect our forces and\r\ncommence our movements. By the blockade the import and export trade of\r\nthe enemy has been cut off. Well may the American people be proud of the\r\nenergy and gallantry of our regular and volunteer officers and soldiers.\r\nThe events of these few months afford a gratifying proof that our\r\ncountry can under any emergency confidently rely for the maintenance of\r\nher honor and the defense of her rights on an effective force, ready at\r\nall times voluntarily to relinquish the comforts of home for the perils\r\nand privations of the camp. And though such a force may be for the time\r\nexpensive, it is in the end economical, as the ability to command it\r\nremoves the necessity of employing a large standing army in time of\r\npeace, and proves that our people love their institutions and are ever\r\nready to defend and protect them.\r\n\r\nWhile the war was in a course of vigorous and successful prosecution,\r\nbeing still anxious to arrest its evils, and considering that after the\r\nbrilliant victories of our arms on the 8th and 9th of May last the\r\nnational honor could not be compromitted by it, another overture was\r\nmade to Mexico, by my direction, on the 27th of July last to terminate\r\nhostilities by a peace just and honorable to both countries. On the 31st\r\nof August following the Mexican Government declined to accept this\r\nfriendly overture, but referred it to the decision of a Mexican Congress\r\nto be assembled in the early part of the present month. I communicate to\r\nyou herewith a copy of the letter of the Secretary of State proposing to\r\nreopen negotiations, of the answer of the Mexican Government, and of the\r\nreply thereto of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe war will continue to be prosecuted with vigor as the best means of\r\nsecuring peace. It is hoped that the decision of the Mexican Congress,\r\nto which our last overture has been referred, may result in a speedy and\r\nhonorable peace. With our experience, however, of the unreasonable\r\ncourse of the Mexican authorities, it is the part of wisdom not to relax\r\nin the energy of our military operations until the result is made known.\r\nIn this view it is deemed important to hold military possession of all\r\nthe Provinces which have been taken until a definitive treaty of peace\r\nshall have been concluded and ratified by the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe war has not been waged with a view to conquest, but, having been\r\ncommenced by Mexico, it has been carried into the enemy's country and\r\nwill be vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable\r\npeace, and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war,\r\nas well as to our much-injured citizens, who hold large pecuniary\r\ndemands against Mexico.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of nations a conquered country is subject to be governed by\r\nthe conqueror during his military possession and until there is either a\r\ntreaty of peace or he shall voluntarily withdraw from it. The old civil\r\ngovernment being necessarily superseded, it is the right and duty of the\r\nconqueror to secure his conquest and to provide for the maintenance of\r\ncivil order and the rights of the inhabitants. This right has been\r\nexercised and this duty performed by our military and naval commanders\r\nby the establishment of temporary governments in some of the conquered\r\nProvinces of Mexico, assimilating them as far as practicable to the free\r\ninstitutions of our own country. In the Provinces of New Mexico and of\r\nthe Californias little, if any, further resistance is apprehended from\r\nthe inhabitants to the temporary governments which have thus, from the\r\nnecessity of the case and according to the laws of war, been\r\nestablished. It may be proper to provide for the security of these\r\nimportant conquests by making an adequate appropriation for the purpose\r\nof erecting fortifications and defraying the expenses necessarily\r\nincident to the maintenance of our possession and authority over them.\r\n\r\nNear the close of your last session, for reasons communicated to\r\nCongress, I deemed it important as a measure for securing a speedy peace\r\nwith Mexico, that a sum of money should be appropriated and placed in\r\nthe power of the Executive, similar to that which had been made upon two\r\nformer occasions during the Administration of President Jefferson.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February, 1803, an appropriation of $2,000,000 was made\r\nand placed at the disposal of the President. Its object is well known.\r\nIt was at that time in contemplation to acquire Louisiana from France,\r\nand it was intended to be applied as a part of the consideration which\r\nmight be paid for that territory. On the 13th of February, 1806, the\r\nsame sum was in like manner appropriated, with a view to the purchase of\r\nthe Floridas from Spain. These appropriations were made to facilitate\r\nnegotiations and as a means to enable the President to accomplish the\r\nimportant objects in view. Though it did not become necessary for the\r\nPresident to use these appropriations, yet a state of things might have\r\narisen in which it would have been highly important for him to do so,\r\nand the wisdom of making them can not be doubted. It is believed that\r\nthe measure recommended at your last session met with the approbation of\r\ndecided majorities in both Houses of Congress. Indeed, in different\r\nforms, a bill making an appropriation of $2,000,000 passed each House,\r\nand it is much to be regretted that it did not become a law. The reasons\r\nwhich induced me to recommend the measure at that time still exist, and\r\nI again submit the subject for your consideration and suggest the\r\nimportance of early action upon it. Should the appropriation be made and\r\nbe not needed, it will remain in the Treasury; should it be deemed\r\nproper to apply it in whole or in part, it will be accounted for as\r\nother public expenditures.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Congress had recognized the existence of the war with\r\nMexico my attention was directed to the danger that privateers might be\r\nfitted out in the ports of Cuba and Porto Rico to prey upon the commerce\r\nof the United States, and I invited the special attention of the Spanish\r\nGovernment to the fourteenth article of our treaty with that power of\r\nthe 27th of October, 1795, under which the citizens and subjects of\r\neither nation who shall take commissions or letters of marque to act as\r\nprivateers against the other \"shall be punished as pirates.\"\r\n\r\nIt affords me pleasure to inform you that I have received assurances\r\nfrom the Spanish Government that this article of the treaty shall be\r\nfaithfully observed on its part. Orders for this purpose were\r\nimmediately transmitted from that Government to the authorities of Cuba\r\nand Porto Rico to exert their utmost vigilance in preventing any\r\nattempts to fit out privateers in those islands against the United\r\nStates. From the good faith of Spain I am fully satisfied that this\r\ntreaty will be executed in its spirit as well as its letter, whilst the\r\nUnited States will on their part faithfully perform all the obligations\r\nwhich it imposes on them.\r\n\r\nInformation has been recently received at the Department of State that\r\nthe Mexican Government has sent to Havana blank commissions to\r\nprivateers and blank certificates of naturalization signed by General\r\nSalas, the present head of the Mexican Government. There is also reason\r\nto apprehend that similar documents have been transmitted to other parts\r\nof the world. Copies of these papers, in translation, are herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nAs the preliminaries required by the practice of civilized nations for\r\ncommissioning privateers and regulating their conduct appear not to have\r\nbeen observed, and as these commissions are in blank, to be filled up\r\nwith the names of citizens and subjects of all nations who may be\r\nwilling to purchase them, the whole proceeding can only be construed as\r\nan invitation to all the freebooters upon earth who are willing to pay\r\nfor the privilege to cruise against American commerce. It will be for\r\nour courts of justice to decide whether under such circumstances these\r\nMexican letters of marque and reprisal shall protect those who accept\r\nthem, and commit robberies upon the high seas under their authority,\r\nfrom the pains and penalties of piracy.\r\n\r\nIf the certificates of naturalization thus granted be intended by Mexico\r\nto shield Spanish subjects from the guilt and punishment of pirates\r\nunder our treaty with Spain, they will certainly prove unavailing. Such\r\na subterfuge would be but a weak device to defeat the provisions of a\r\nsolemn treaty.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Congress should immediately provide by law for the\r\ntrial and punishment as pirates of Spanish subjects who, escaping the\r\nvigilance of their Government, shall be found guilty of privateering\r\nagainst the United States. I do not apprehend serious danger from these\r\nprivateers. Our Navy will be constantly on the alert to protect our\r\ncommerce. Besides, in case prizes should be made of American vessels,\r\nthe utmost vigilance will be exerted by our blockading squadron to\r\nprevent the captors from taking them into Mexican ports, and it is not\r\napprehended that any nation will violate its neutrality by suffering\r\nsuch prizes to be condemned and sold within its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Congress should immediately provide by law for granting\r\nletters of marque and reprisal against vessels under the Mexican flag.\r\nIt is true that there are but few, if any, commercial vessels of Mexico\r\nupon the high seas, and it is therefore not probable that many American\r\nprivateers would be fitted out in case a law should pass authorizing\r\nthis mode of warfare. It is, notwithstanding, certain that such\r\nprivateers may render good service to the commercial interests of the\r\ncountry by recapturing our merchant ships should any be taken by armed\r\nvessels under the Mexican flag, as well as by capturing these vessels\r\nthemselves. Every means within our power should be rendered available\r\nfor the protection of our commerce.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit a\r\ndetailed statement of the condition of the finances. The imports for the\r\nfiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were of the value of\r\n$121,691,797, of which the amount exported was $11,346,623, leaving the\r\namount retained in the country for domestic consumption $110,345,174.\r\nThe value of the exports for the same period was $113,488,516, of which\r\n$102,141,893 consisted of domestic productions and $11,346,623 of\r\nforeign articles.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the same year were $29,499,247.06, of\r\nwhich there was derived from customs $26,712,667.87, from the sales of\r\npublic lands $2,694,452.48, and from incidental and miscellaneous\r\nsources $92,126.71. The expenditures for the same period were\r\n$28,031,114.20, and the balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July\r\nlast was $9,126,439.08.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public debt, including Treasury notes, on the 1st of\r\nthe present month was $24,256,494.60, of which the sum of $17,788,799.62\r\nwas outstanding on the 4th of March, 1845, leaving the amount incurred\r\nsince that time $6,467,694.98.\r\n\r\nIn order to prosecute the war with Mexico with vigor and energy, as the\r\nbest means of bringing it to a speedy and honorable termination, a\r\nfurther loan will be necessary to meet the expenditures for the present\r\nand the next fiscal year. If the war should be continued until the 30th\r\nof June, 1848, being the end of the next fiscal year, it is estimated\r\nthat an additional loan of $23,000,000 will be required. This estimate\r\nis made upon the assumption that it will be necessary to retain\r\nconstantly in the Treasury $4,000,000 to guard against contingencies.\r\nIf such surplus were not required to be retained, then a loan of\r\n$19,000,000 would be sufficient. If, however, Congress should at the\r\npresent session impose a revenue duty on the principal articles now\r\nembraced in the free list, it is estimated that an additional annual\r\nrevenue of about two millions and a half, amounting, it is estimated,\r\non the 30th of June, 1848, to $4,000,000, would be derived from that\r\nsource, and the loan required would be reduced by that amount. It is\r\nestimated also that should Congress graduate and reduce the price of\r\nsuch of the public lands as have been long in the market the additional\r\nrevenue derived from that source would be annually, for several years\r\nto come, between half a million and a million dollars; and the loan\r\nrequired may be reduced by that amount also. Should these measures be\r\nadopted, the loan required would not probably exceed $18,000,000 or\r\n$19,000,000, leaving in the Treasury a constant surplus of $4,000,000.\r\nThe loan proposed, it is estimated, will be sufficient to cover the\r\nnecessary expenditures both for the war and for all other purposes up\r\nto the 30th of June, 1848, and an amount of this loan not exceeding\r\none-half may be required during the present fiscal year, and the greater\r\npart of the remainder during the first half of the fiscal year\r\nsucceeding.\r\n\r\nIn order that timely notice may be given and proper measures taken to\r\neffect the loan, or such portion of it as may be required, it is\r\nimportant that the authority of Congress to make it be given at an early\r\nperiod of your present session. It is suggested that the loan should be\r\ncontracted for a period of twenty years, with authority to purchase the\r\nstock and pay it off at an earlier period at its market value out of any\r\nsurplus which may at any time be in the Treasury applicable to that\r\npurpose. After the establishment of peace with Mexico, it is supposed\r\nthat a considerable surplus will exist, and that the debt may be\r\nextinguished in a much shorter period than that for which it may be\r\ncontracted. The period of twenty years, as that for which the proposed\r\nloan may be contracted, in preference to a shorter period, is suggested,\r\nbecause all experience, both at home and abroad, has shown that loans\r\nare effected upon much better terms upon long time than when they are\r\nreimbursable at short dates.\r\n\r\nNecessary as this measure is to sustain the honor and the interests of\r\nthe country engaged in a foreign war, it is not doubted but that\r\nCongress will promptly authorize it.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury on the 1st July last exceeded $9,000,000,\r\nnotwithstanding considerable expenditures had been made for the war\r\nduring the months of May and June preceding. But for the war the whole\r\npublic debt could and would have been extinguished within a short\r\nperiod; and it was a part of my settled policy to do so, and thus\r\nrelieve the people from its burden and place the Government in a\r\nposition which would enable it to reduce the public expenditures to that\r\neconomical standard which is most consistent with the general welfare\r\nand the pure and wholesome progress of our institutions.\r\n\r\nAmong our just causes of complaint against Mexico arising out of her\r\nrefusal to treat for peace, as well before as since the war so unjustly\r\ncommenced on her part, are the extraordinary expenditures in which we\r\nhave been involved. Justice to our own people will make it proper that\r\nMexico should be held responsible for these expenditures.\r\n\r\nEconomy in the public expenditures is at all times a high duty which all\r\npublic functionaries of the Government owe to the people. This duty\r\nbecomes the more imperative in a period of war, when large and\r\nextraordinary expenditures become unavoidable. During the existence of\r\nthe war with Mexico all our resources should be husbanded, and no\r\nappropriations made except such as are absolutely necessary for its\r\nvigorous prosecution and the due administration of the Government.\r\nObjects of appropriation which in peace may be deemed useful or proper,\r\nbut which are not indispensable for the public service, may when the\r\ncountry is engaged in a foreign war be well postponed to a future\r\nperiod. By the observance of this policy at your present session large\r\namounts may be saved to the Treasury and be applied to objects of\r\npressing and urgent necessity, and thus the creation of a corresponding\r\namount of public debt may be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is not meant to recommend that the ordinary and necessary\r\nappropriations for the support of Government should be withheld; but it\r\nis well known that at every session of Congress appropriations are\r\nproposed for numerous objects which may or may not be made without\r\nmaterially affecting the public interests, and these it is recommended\r\nshould not be granted.\r\n\r\nThe act passed at your last session \"reducing the duties on imports\" not\r\nhaving gone into operation until the 1st of the present month, there has\r\nnot been time for its practical effect upon the revenue and the business\r\nof the country to be developed. It is not doubted, however, that the\r\njust policy which it adopts will add largely to our foreign trade and\r\npromote the general prosperity. Although it can not be certainly\r\nforeseen what amount of revenue it will yield, it is estimated that it\r\nwill exceed that produced by the act of 1842, which it superseded. The\r\nleading principles established by it are to levy the taxes with a view\r\nto raise revenue and to impose them upon the articles imported according\r\nto their actual value.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1842, by the excessive rates of duty which it imposed on many\r\narticles, either totally excluded them from importation or greatly\r\nreduced the amount imported, and thus diminished instead of producing\r\nrevenue. By it the taxes were imposed not for the legitimate purpose of\r\nraising revenue, but to afford advantages to favored classes at the\r\nexpense of a large majority of their fellow-citizens. Those employed in\r\nagriculture, mechanical pursuits, commerce, and navigation were\r\ncompelled to contribute from their substance to swell the profits and\r\novergrown wealth of the comparatively few who had invested their capital\r\nin manufactures. The taxes were not levied in proportion to the value of\r\nthe articles upon which they were imposed, but, widely departing from\r\nthis just rule, the lighter taxes were in many cases levied upon\r\narticles of luxury and high price and the heavier taxes on those of\r\nnecessity and low price, consumed by the great mass of the people. It\r\nwas a system the inevitable effect of which was to relieve favored\r\nclasses and the wealthy few from contributing their just proportion for\r\nthe support of Government, and to lay the burden on the labor of the\r\nmany engaged in other pursuits than manufactures.\r\n\r\nA system so unequal and unjust has been superseded by the existing\r\nlaw, which imposes duties not for the benefit or injury of classes or\r\npursuits, but distributes and, as far as practicable, equalizes the\r\npublic burdens among all classes and occupations. The favored classes\r\nwho under the unequal and unjust system which has been repealed have\r\nheretofore realized large profits, and many of them amassed large\r\nfortunes at the expense of the many who have been made tributary to\r\nthem, will have no reason to complain if they shall be required to\r\nbear their just proportion of the taxes necessary for the support of\r\nGovernment. So far from it, it will be perceived by an examination of\r\nthe existing law that discriminations in the rates of duty imposed\r\nwithin the revenue principle have been retained in their favor. The\r\nincidental aid against foreign competition which they still enjoy gives\r\nthem an advantage which no other pursuits possess, but of this none\r\nothers will complain, because the duties levied are necessary for\r\nrevenue. These revenue duties, including freights and charges, which\r\nthe importer must pay before he can come in competition with the home\r\nmanufacturer in our markets, amount on nearly all our leading branches\r\nof manufacture to more than one-third of the value of the imported\r\narticle, and in some cases to almost one-half its value. With such\r\nadvantages it is not doubted that our domestic manufacturers will\r\ncontinue to prosper, realizing in well-conducted establishments even\r\ngreater profits than can be derived from any other regular business.\r\nIndeed, so far from requiring the protection of even incidental revenue\r\nduties, our manufacturers in several leading branches are extending\r\ntheir business, giving evidence of great ingenuity and skill and of\r\ntheir ability to compete, with increased prospect of success, for the\r\nopen market of the world. Domestic manufactures to the value of several\r\nmillions of dollars, which can not find a market at home, are annually\r\nexported to foreign countries. With such rates of duty as those\r\nestablished by the existing law the system will probably be permanent,\r\nand capitalists who are made or shall hereafter make their investments\r\nin manufactures will know upon what to rely. The country will be\r\nsatisfied with these rates, because the advantages which the\r\nmanufacturers still enjoy result necessarily from the collection of\r\nrevenue for the support of Government. High protective duties, from\r\ntheir unjust operation upon the masses of the people, can not fail to\r\ngive rise to extensive dissatisfaction and complaint and to constant\r\nefforts to change or repeal them, rendering all investments in\r\nmanufactures uncertain and precarious. Lower and more permanent rates of\r\nduty, at the same time that they will yield to the manufacturer fair and\r\nremunerating profits, will secure him against the danger of frequent\r\nchanges in the system, which can not fail to ruinously affect his\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the relaxation of the restrictive policy by the\r\nUnited States, Great Britain, from whose example we derived the system,\r\nhas relaxed hers. She has modified her corn laws and reduced many other\r\nduties to moderate revenue rates. After ages of experience the statesmen\r\nof that country have been constrained by a stern necessity and by a\r\npublic opinion having its deep foundation in the sufferings and wants of\r\nimpoverished millions to abandon a system the effect of which was to\r\nbuild up immense fortunes in the hands of the few and to reduce the\r\nlaboring millions to pauperism and misery. Nearly in the same ratio that\r\nlabor was depressed capital was increased and concentrated by the\r\nBritish protective policy.\r\n\r\nThe evils of the system in Great Britain were at length rendered\r\nintolerable, and it has been abandoned, but not without a severe\r\nstruggle on the part of the protected and favored classes to retain the\r\nunjust advantages which they have so long enjoyed. It was to be expected\r\nthat a similar struggle would be made by the same classes in the United\r\nStates whenever an attempt was made to modify or abolish the same unjust\r\nsystem here. The protective policy had been in operation in the United\r\nStates for a much shorter period, and its pernicious effects were not,\r\ntherefore, so clearly perceived and felt. Enough, however, was known of\r\nthese effects to induce its repeal.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange if in the face of the example of _Great Britain_,\r\nour principal foreign customer, and of the evils of a system rendered\r\nmanifest in that country by long and painful experience, and in the face\r\nof the immense advantages which under a more liberal commercial policy\r\nwe are already deriving, and must continue to derive, by supplying her\r\nstarving population with food, the United States should restore a policy\r\nwhich she has been compelled to abandon, and thus diminish her ability\r\nto purchase from us the food and other articles which she so much needs\r\nand we so much desire to sell. By the simultaneous abandonment of the\r\nprotective policy by Great Britain and the United States new and\r\nimportant markets have already been opened for our agricultural and\r\nother products, commerce and navigation have received a new impulse,\r\nlabor and trade have been released from the artificial trammels which\r\nhave so long fettered them, and to a great extent reciprocity in the\r\nexchange of commodities has been introduced at the same time by both\r\ncountries, and greatly for the benefit of both. Great Britain has been\r\nforced by the pressure of circumstances at home to abandon a policy\r\nwhich has been upheld for ages, and to open her markets for our immense\r\nsurplus of breadstuffs, and it is confidently believed that other powers\r\nof Europe will ultimately see the wisdom, if they be not compelled by\r\nthe pauperism and sufferings of their crowded population, to pursue a\r\nsimilar policy.\r\n\r\nOur farmers are more deeply interested in maintaining the just and\r\nliberal policy of the existing law than any other class of our citizens.\r\nThey constitute a large majority of our population, and it is well known\r\nthat when they prosper all other pursuits prosper also. They have\r\nheretofore not only received none of the bounties or favors of\r\nGovernment, but by the unequal operations of the protective policy have\r\nbeen made by the burdens of taxation which it imposed to contribute to\r\nthe bounties which have enriched others.\r\n\r\nWhen a foreign as well as a home market is opened to them, they must\r\nreceive, as they are now receiving, increased prices for their products.\r\nThey will find a readier sale, and at better prices, for their wheat,\r\nflour, rice, Indian corn, beef, pork, lard, butter, cheese, and other\r\narticles which they produce. The home market alone is inadequate to\r\nenable them to dispose of the immense surplus of food and other articles\r\nwhich they are capable of producing, even at the most reduced prices,\r\nfor the manifest reason that they can not be consumed in the country.\r\nThe United States can from their immense surplus supply not only the\r\nhome demand, but the deficiencies of food required by the whole world.\r\n\r\nThat the reduced production of some of the chief articles of food in\r\nGreat Britain and other parts of Europe may have contributed to increase\r\nthe demand for our breadstuffs and provisions is not doubted, but that\r\nthe great and efficient cause of this increased demand and of increased\r\nprices consists in the removal of artificial restrictions heretofore\r\nimposed is deemed to be equally certain. That our exports of food,\r\nalready increased and increasing beyond former example under the more\r\nliberal policy which has been adopted, will be still vastly enlarged\r\nunless they be checked or prevented by a restoration of the protective\r\npolicy can not be doubted. That our commercial and navigating interests\r\nwill be enlarged in a corresponding ratio with the increase of our trade\r\nis equally certain, while our manufacturing interests will still be the\r\nfavored interests of the country and receive the incidental protection\r\nafforded them by revenue duties; and more than this they can not justly\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December last a tariff of revenue duties based\r\nupon the principles of the existing law was recommended, and I have seen\r\nno reason to change the opinions then expressed. In view of the probable\r\nbeneficial effects of that law, I recommend that the policy established\r\nby it be maintained. It has but just commenced to operate, and to\r\nabandon or modify it without giving it a fair trial would be inexpedient\r\nand unwise. Should defects in any of its details be ascertained by\r\nactual experience to exist, these may be hereafter corrected; but until\r\nsuch defects shall become manifest the act should be fairly tested.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted for your consideration whether it may not be proper, as\r\na war measure, to impose revenue duties on some of the articles now\r\nembraced in the free list. Should it be deemed proper to impose such\r\nduties with a view to raise revenue to meet the expenses of the war with\r\nMexico or to avoid to that extent the creation of a public debt, they\r\nmay be repealed when the emergency which gave rise to them shall cease\r\nto exist, and constitute no part of the permanent policy of the country.\r\n\r\nThe act of the 6th of August last, \"to provide for the better\r\norganization of the Treasury and for the collection, safe-keeping,\r\ntransfer, and disbursement of the public revenue,\" has been carried into\r\nexecution as rapidly as the delay necessarily arising out of the\r\nappointment of new officers, taking and approving their bonds, and\r\npreparing and securing proper places for the safe-keeping of the public\r\nmoney would permit. It is not proposed to depart in any respect from the\r\nprinciples or policy on which this great measure is founded. There are,\r\nhowever, defects in the details of the measure, developed by its\r\npractical operation, which are fully set forth in the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to which the attention of Congress is\r\ninvited. These defects would impair to some extent the successful\r\noperation of the law at all times, but are especially embarrassing when\r\nthe country is engaged in a war, when the expenditures are greatly\r\nincreased, when loans are to be effected and the disbursements are to be\r\nmade at points many hundred miles distant, in some cases, from any\r\ndepository, and a large portion of them in a foreign country. The\r\nmodifications suggested in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nare recommended to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I invite your attention to the\r\nimportance of establishing a branch of the Mint of the United States at\r\nNew York. Two-thirds of the revenue derived from customs being collected\r\nat that point, the demand for specie to pay the duties will be large,\r\nand a branch mint where foreign coin and bullion could be immediately\r\nconverted into American coin would greatly facilitate the transaction of\r\nthe public business, enlarge the circulation of gold and silver, and be\r\nat the same time a safe depository of the public money.\r\n\r\nThe importance of graduating and reducing the price of such of the\r\npublic lands as have been long offered in the market at the minimum rate\r\nauthorized by existing laws, and remain unsold, induces me again to\r\nrecommend the subject to your favorable consideration. Many millions of\r\nacres of these lands have been offered in the market for more than\r\nthirty years and larger quantities for more than ten or twenty years,\r\nand, being of an inferior quality, they must remain unsalable for an\r\nindefinite period unless the price at which they may be purchased shall\r\nbe reduced. To place a price upon them above their real value is not\r\nonly to prevent their sale, and thereby deprive the Treasury of any\r\nincome from that source, but is unjust to the States in which they lie,\r\nbecause it retards their growth and increase of population, and because\r\nthey have no power to levy a tax upon them as upon other lands within\r\ntheir limits, held by other proprietors than the United States, for the\r\nsupport of their local governments.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effects of the graduation principle have been realized by\r\nsome of the States owning the lands within their limits in which it has\r\nbeen adopted. They have been demonstrated also by the United States\r\nacting as the trustee of the Chickasaw tribe of Indians in the sale of\r\ntheir lands lying within the States of Mississippi and Alabama. The\r\nChickasaw lands, which would not command in the market the minimum price\r\nestablished by the laws of the United States for the sale of their\r\nlands, were, in pursuance of the treaty of 1834 with that tribe,\r\nsubsequently offered for sale at graduated and reduced rates for limited\r\nperiods. The result was that large quantities of these lands were\r\npurchased which would otherwise have remained unsold. The lands were\r\ndisposed of at their real value, and many persons of limited means were\r\nenabled to purchase small tracts, upon which they have settled with\r\ntheir families. That similar results would be produced by the adoption\r\nof the graduation policy by the United States in all the States in which\r\nthey are the owners of large bodies of lands which have been long in the\r\nmarket can not be doubted. It can not be a sound policy to withhold\r\nlarge quantities of the public lands from the use and occupation of our\r\ncitizens by fixing upon them prices which experience has shown they will\r\nnot command. On the contrary, it is a wise policy to afford facilities\r\nto our citizens to become the owners at low and moderate rates of\r\nfreeholds of their own instead of being the tenants and dependents of\r\nothers. If it be apprehended that these lands if reduced in price would\r\nbe secured in large quantities by speculators or capitalists, the sales\r\nmay be restricted in limited quantities to actual settlers or persons\r\npurchasing for purposes of cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I submitted for the consideration of Congress\r\nthe present system of managing the mineral lands of the United States,\r\nand recommended that they should be brought into market and sold upon\r\nsuch terms and under such restrictions as Congress might prescribe. By\r\nthe act of the 11th of July last \"the reserved lead mines and contiguous\r\nlands in the States of Illinois and Arkansas and Territories of\r\nWisconsin and Iowa\" were authorized to be sold. The act is confined in\r\nits operation to \"lead mines and contiguous lands.\" A large portion of\r\nthe public lands, containing copper and other ores, is represented to be\r\nvery valuable, and I recommend that provision be made authorizing the\r\nsale of these lands upon such terms and conditions as from their\r\nsupposed value may in the judgment of Congress be deemed advisable,\r\nhaving due regard to the interests of such of our citizens as may be\r\nlocated upon them.\r\n\r\nIt will be important during your present session to establish a\r\nTerritorial government and to extend the jurisdiction and laws of the\r\nUnited States over the Territory of Oregon. Our laws regulating trade\r\nand intercourse with the Indian tribes east of the Rocky Mountains\r\nshould be extended to the Pacific Ocean; and for the purpose of\r\nexecuting them and preserving friendly relations with the Indian tribes\r\nwithin our limits, an additional number of Indian agencies will be\r\nrequired, and should be authorized by law. The establishment of\r\ncustom-houses and of post-offices and post-roads and provision for the\r\ntransportation of the mail on such routes as the public convenience will\r\nsuggest require legislative authority. It will be proper also to\r\nestablish a surveyor-general's office in that Territory and to make the\r\nnecessary provision for surveying the public lands and bringing them\r\ninto market. As our citizens who now reside in that distant region have\r\nbeen subjected to many hardships, privations, and sacrifices in their\r\nemigration, and by their improvements have enhanced the value of the\r\npublic lands in the neighborhood of their settlements, it is recommended\r\nthat liberal grants be made to them of such portions of these lands as\r\nthey may occupy, and that similar grants or rights of preemption be made\r\nto all who may emigrate thither within a limited period, prescribed by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War contains detailed information\r\nrelative to the several branches of the public service connected with\r\nthat Department. The operations of the Army have been of a satisfactory\r\nand highly gratifying character. I recommend to your early and favorable\r\nconsideration the measures proposed by the Secretary of War for speedily\r\nfilling up the rank and file of the Regular Army, for its greater\r\nefficiency in the field, and for raising an additional force to serve\r\nduring the war with Mexico.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassment is likely to arise for want of legal provision authorizing\r\ncompensation to be made to the agents employed in the several States and\r\nTerritories to pay the Revolutionary and other pensioners the amounts\r\nallowed them by law. Your attention is invited to the recommendations\r\nof the Secretary of War on this subject. These agents incur heavy\r\nresponsibilities and perform important duties, and no reason exists why\r\nthey should not be placed on the same footing as to compensation with\r\nother disbursing officers.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the various Indian tribes continue to be of a pacific\r\ncharacter. The unhappy dissensions which have existed among the\r\nCherokees for many years past have been healed. Since my last annual\r\nmessage important treaties have been negotiated with some of the tribes,\r\nby which the Indian title to large tracts of valuable land within the\r\nlimits of the States and Territories has been extinguished and\r\narrangements made for removing them to the country west of the\r\nMississippi. Between 3,000 and 4,000 of different tribes have been\r\nremoved to the country provided for them by treaty stipulations, and\r\narrangements have been made for others to follow.\r\n\r\nIn our intercourse with the several tribes particular attention has been\r\ngiven to the important subject of education. The number of schools\r\nestablished among them has been increased, and additional means provided\r\nnot only for teaching them the rudiments of education, but of\r\ninstructing them in agriculture and the mechanic arts.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a\r\nsatisfactory view of the operations of the Department under his charge\r\nduring the past year. It is gratifying to perceive that while the war\r\nwith Mexico has rendered it necessary to employ an unusual number of our\r\narmed vessels on her coasts, the protection due to our commerce in other\r\nquarters of the world has not proved insufficient. No means will be\r\nspared to give efficiency to the naval service in the prosecution of the\r\nwar; and I am happy to know that the officers and men anxiously desire\r\nto devote themselves to the service of their country in any enterprise,\r\nhowever difficult of execution.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the proposition to add to\r\neach of our foreign squadrons an efficient sea steamer, and, as\r\nespecially demanding attention, the establishment at Pensacola of the\r\nnecessary means of repairing and refitting the vessels of the Navy\r\nemployed in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThere are other suggestions in the report which deserve and I doubt not\r\nwill receive your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe progress and condition of the mail service for the past year are\r\nfully presented in the report of the Postmaster-General. The revenue for\r\nthe year ending on the 30th of June last amounted to $3,487,199, which\r\nis $802,642.45 less than that of the preceding year. The payments for\r\nthat Department during the same time amounted to $4,084,297.22. Of this\r\nsum $597,097.80 have been drawn from the Treasury. The disbursements for\r\nthe year were $236,434.77 less than those of the preceding year. While\r\nthe disbursements have been thus diminished, the mail facilities have\r\nbeen enlarged by new mail routes of 5,739 miles, an increase of\r\ntransportation of 1,764,145 miles, and the establishment of 418 new\r\npost-offices. Contractors, postmasters, and others engaged in this\r\nbranch of the service have performed their duties with energy and\r\nfaithfulness deserving commendation. For many interesting details\r\nconnected with the operations of this establishment you are referred to\r\nthe report of the Postmaster-General, and his suggestions for improving\r\nits revenues are recommended to your favorable consideration. I repeat\r\nthe opinion expressed in my last annual message that the business of\r\nthis Department should be so regulated chat the revenues derived from it\r\nshould be made to equal the expenditures, and it is believed that this\r\nmay be done by proper modifications of the present laws, as suggested in\r\nthe report of the Postmaster-General, without changing the present rates\r\nof postage.\r\n\r\nWith full reliance upon the wisdom and patriotism of your deliberations,\r\nit, will be my duty, as it will be my anxious desire, to cooperate with\r\nyou in every constitutional effort to promote the welfare and maintain\r\nthe honor of our common country.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 14, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their consideration and advice with regard\r\nto its ratification, a convention for the mutual surrender of criminals\r\nbetween the United States and the Swiss Confederation, signed by their\r\nrespective plenipotentiaries on the 15th of September last at Paris.\r\n\r\nI transmit also a copy of a dispatch from the plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States, with the accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 22, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request contained in the resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives of the 15th instant, I communicate herewith reports\r\nfrom the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, with the\r\ndocuments which accompany them.\r\n\r\nThese documents contain all the \"orders or instructions\" to any\r\nmilitary, naval, or other officer of the Government \"in relation to the\r\nestablishment or organization of civil government in any portion of the\r\nterritory of Mexico which has or might be taken possession of by the\r\nArmy or Navy of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThese orders and instructions were given to regulate the exercise of the\r\nrights of a belligerent engaged in actual war over such portions of the\r\nterritory of our enemy as by military conquest might be \"taken\r\npossession of\" and be occupied by our armed forces--rights necessarily\r\nresulting from a state of war and clearly recognized by the laws of\r\nnations. This was all the authority which could be delegated to our\r\nmilitary and naval commanders, and its exercise was indispensable to the\r\nsecure occupation and possession of territory of the enemy which might\r\nbe conquered. The regulations authorized were temporary, and dependent\r\non the rights acquired by conquest. They were authorized as belligerent\r\nrights, and were to be carried into effect by military or naval\r\nofficers. They were but the amelioration of martial law, which modern\r\ncivilization requires, and were due as well to the security of the\r\nconquest as to the inhabitants of the conquered territory.\r\n\r\nThe documents communicated also contain the reports of several highly\r\nmeritorious officers of our Army and Navy who have conquered and taken\r\npossession of portions of the enemy's territory.\r\n\r\nAmong the documents accompanying the report of the Secretary of War will\r\nbe found a \"form of government\" \"established and organized\" by the\r\nmilitary commander who conquered and occupied with his forces the\r\nTerritory of New Mexico. This document was received at the War\r\nDepartment in the latter part of the last month, and, as will be\r\nperceived by the report of the Secretary of War, was not, for the\r\nreasons stated by that officer, brought to my notice until after my\r\nannual message of the 8th instant was communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is declared on its face to be a \"temporary government of the said\r\nTerritory,\" but there are portions of it which purport to \"establish and\r\norganize\" a permanent Territorial government of the United States over\r\nthe Territory and to impart to its inhabitants political rights which\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States can be enjoyed permanently\r\nonly by citizens of the United States. These have not been \"approved and\r\nrecognized\" by me. Such organized regulations as have been established\r\nin any of the conquered territories for the security of our conquest,\r\nfor the preservation of order, for the protection of the rights of the\r\ninhabitants, and for depriving the enemy of the advantages of these\r\nterritories while the military possession of them by the forces of the\r\nUnited States continues will be recognized and approved.\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent from the reports of the officers who have been\r\nrequired by the success which has crowned their arms to exercise the\r\npowers of temporary government over the conquered territories that if\r\nany excess of power has been exercised the departure has been the\r\noffspring of a patriotic desire to give to the inhabitants the\r\nprivileges and immunities so cherished by the people of our own country,\r\nand which they believed calculated to improve their condition and\r\npromote their prosperity. Any such excess has resulted in no practical\r\ninjury, but can and will be early corrected in a manner to alienate as\r\nlittle as possible the good feelings of the inhabitants of the conquered\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 29, 1846_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn order to prosecute the war against Mexico with vigor and success,\r\nit is necessary that authority should be promptly given by Congress\r\nto increase the Regular Army and to remedy existing defects in its\r\norganization. With this view your favorable attention is invited to the\r\nannual report of the Secretary of War, which accompanied my message of\r\nthe 8th instant, in which he recommends that ten additional regiments\r\nof regular troops shall be raised, to serve during the war.\r\n\r\nOf the additional regiments of volunteers which have been called for\r\nfrom several of the States, some have been promptly raised; but this\r\nhas not been the case in regard to all. The existing law, requiring\r\nthat they should be organized by the independent action of the State\r\ngovernments, has in some instances occasioned considerable delay, and it\r\nis yet uncertain when the troops required can be ready for service in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nIt is our settled policy to maintain in time of peace as small a Regular\r\nArmy as the exigencies of the public service will permit. In a state of\r\nwar, notwithstanding the great advantage with which our volunteer\r\ncitizen soldiers can be brought into the field, this small Regular Army\r\nmust be increased in its numbers in order to render the whole force more\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\nAdditional officers as well as men then become indispensable. Under the\r\ncircumstances of our service a peculiar propriety exists for increasing\r\nthe officers, especially in the higher grades. The number of such\r\nofficers who from age and other causes are rendered incapable of active\r\nservice in the field has seriously impaired the efficiency of the Army.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of War it appears that about two-thirds\r\nof the whole number of regimental field officers are either permanently\r\ndisabled or are necessarily detached from their commands on other\r\nduties. The long enjoyment of peace has prevented us from experiencing\r\nmuch embarrassment from this cause, but now, in a state of war,\r\nconducted in a foreign country, it has produced serious injury to the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nAn efficient organization of the Army, composed of regulars and\r\nvolunteers, whilst prosecuting the war in Mexico, it is believed would\r\nrequire the appointment of a general officer to take the command of all\r\nour military forces in the field. Upon the conclusion of the war the\r\nservices of such an officer would no longer be necessary, and should be\r\ndispensed with upon the reduction of the Army to a peace establishment.\r\n\r\nI recommend that provision be made by law for the appointment of such a\r\ngeneral officer to serve during the war.\r\n\r\nIt is respectfully recommended that early action should be had by\r\nCongress upon the suggestions submitted for their consideration, as\r\nnecessary to insure active and efficient service in prosecuting the war,\r\nbefore the present favorable season for military operations in the\r\nenemy's country shall have passed away.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 10, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their advice with regard to its\r\nratification, \"a general treaty of peace, amity, navigation, and\r\ncommerce between the United States of America and the Republic of New\r\nGranada,\" concluded at Bogota on the 12th December last by Benjamin A.\r\nBidlack, chargé d'affaires of the United States, on their part, and by\r\nManuel Maria Mallarino, secretary of state and foreign relations, on the\r\npart of that Republic.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived by the thirty-fifth article of this treaty that New\r\nGranada proposes to guarantee to the Government and citizens of the\r\nUnited States the right of passage across the Isthmus of Panama over the\r\nnatural roads and over any canal or railroad which may be constructed to\r\nunite the two seas, on condition that the United States shall make a\r\nsimilar guaranty to New Granada of the neutrality of this portion of her\r\nterritory and her sovereignty over the same.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which caused the insertion of this important stipulation in\r\nthe treaty will be fully made known to the Senate by the accompanying\r\ndocuments. From these it will appear that our chargé d'affaires acted in\r\nthis particular upon his own responsibility and without instructions.\r\nUnder such circumstances it became my duty to decide whether I would\r\nsubmit the treaty to the Senate, and after mature consideration I have\r\ndetermined to adopt this course.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this concession to the commercial and political\r\ninterests of the United States can not easily be overrated. The route by\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama is the shortest between the two oceans, and from\r\nthe information herewith communicated it would seem to be the most\r\npracticable for a railroad or canal.\r\n\r\nThe vast advantages to our commerce which would result from such a\r\ncommunication, not only with the west coast of America, but with Asia\r\nand the islands of the Pacific, are too obvious to require any detail.\r\nSuch a passage would relieve us from a long and dangerous navigation of\r\nmore than 9,000 miles around Cape Horn and render our communication with\r\nour possessions on the northwest coast of America comparatively easy and\r\nspeedy.\r\n\r\nThe communication across the Isthmus has attracted the attention of the\r\nGovernment of the United States ever since the independence of the South\r\nAmerican Republics. On the 3d of March, 1835, a resolution passed the\r\nSenate in the following words:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President of the United States be respectfully\r\n  requested to consider the expediency of opening negotiations with the\r\n  governments of other nations, and particularly with the Governments\r\n  of Central America and New Granada, for the purpose of effectually\r\n  protecting, by suitable treaty stipulations with them, such individuals\r\n  or companies as may undertake to open a communication between the\r\n  Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the construction of a ship canal across\r\n  the isthmus which connects North and South America, and of securing\r\n  forever by such stipulations the free and equal right of navigating such\r\n  canal to all nations on the payment of such reasonable tolls as may be\r\n  established to compensate the capitalists who may engage in such\r\n  undertaking and complete the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo person can be more deeply sensible than myself of the danger of\r\nentangling alliances with any foreign nation. That we should avoid such\r\nalliances has become a maxim of our policy consecrated by the most\r\nvenerated names which adorn our history and sanctioned by the unanimous\r\nvoice of the American people. Our own experience has taught us the\r\nwisdom of this maxim in the only instance, that of the guaranty to\r\nFrance of her American possessions, in which we have ever entered into\r\nsuch an alliance. If, therefore, the very peculiar circumstances of the\r\npresent case do not greatly impair, if not altogether destroy, the force\r\nof this objection, then we ought not to enter into the stipulation,\r\nwhatever may be its advantages. The general considerations which have\r\ninduced me to transmit the treaty to the Senate for their advice may be\r\nsummed up in the following particulars:\r\n\r\n1. The treaty does not propose to guarantee a territory to a foreign\r\nnation in which the United States will have no common interest with that\r\nnation. On the contrary, we are more deeply and directly interested in\r\nthe subject of this guaranty than New Granada herself or any other\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n2. The guaranty does not extend to the territories of New Granada\r\ngenerally, but is confined to the single Province of the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, where we shall acquire by the treaty a common and coextensive\r\nright of passage with herself.\r\n\r\n3. It will constitute no alliance for any political object, but for a\r\npurely commercial purpose, in which all the navigating nations of the\r\nworld have a common interest.\r\n\r\n4. In entering into the mutual guaranties proposed by the thirty-fifth\r\narticle of the treaty neither the Government of New Granada nor that of\r\nthe United States has any narrow or exclusive views. The ultimate\r\nobject, as presented by the Senate of the United States in their\r\nresolution to which I have already referred, is to secure to all nations\r\nthe free and equal right of passage over the Isthmus. If the United\r\nStates, as the chief of the American nations, should first become a\r\nparty to this guaranty, it can not be doubted--indeed, it is confidently\r\nexpected by the Government of New Granada--that similar guaranties will\r\nbe given to that Republic by Great Britain and France. Should the\r\nproposition thus tendered be rejected we may deprive the United States\r\nof the just influence which its acceptance might secure to them and\r\nconfer the glory and benefits of being the first among the nations in\r\nconcluding such an arrangement upon the Government either of Great\r\nBritain or France. That either of these Governments would embrace the\r\noffer can not be doubted, because there does not appear to be any other\r\neffectual means of securing to all nations the advantages of this\r\nimportant passage but the guaranty of great commercial powers that the\r\nIsthmus shall be neutral territory. The interests of the world at stake\r\nare so important that the security of this passage between the two\r\noceans can not be suffered to depend upon the wars and revolutions which\r\nmay arise among different nations.\r\n\r\nBesides, such a guaranty is almost indispensable to the construction of\r\na railroad or canal across the territory. Neither sovereign states nor\r\nindividuals would expend their capital in the construction of these\r\nexpensive works without some such security for their investments.\r\n\r\nThe guaranty of the sovereignty of New Granada over the Isthmus is a\r\nnatural consequence of the guaranty of its neutrality, and there does\r\nnot seem to be any other practicable mode of securing the neutrality of\r\nthis territory. New Granada would not consent to yield up this Province\r\nin order that it might become a neutral state, and if she should it is\r\nnot sufficiently populous or wealthy to establish and maintain an\r\nindependent sovereignty. But a civil government must exist there in\r\norder to protect the works which shall be constructed. New Granada is\r\na power which will not excite the jealousy of any nation. If Great\r\nBritain, France, or the United States held the sovereignty over the\r\nIsthmus, other nations might apprehend that in case of war the\r\nGovernment would close up the passage against the enemy, but no such\r\nfears can ever be entertained in regard to New Granada.\r\n\r\nThis treaty removes the heavy discriminating duties against us in the\r\nports of New Granada, which have nearly destroyed our commerce and\r\nnavigation with that Republic, and which we have been in vain\r\nendeavoring to abolish for the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper also to call the attention of the Senate to the\r\ntwenty-fifth article of the treaty, which prohibits privateering in case\r\nof war between the two Republics, and also to the additional article,\r\nwhich nationalizes all vessels of the parties which \"shall be provided\r\nby the respective Governments with a patent issued according to its\r\nlaws,\" and in this particular goes further than any of our former\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nCongress, by the act of the 13th of May last, declared that \"by the act\r\nof the Republic of Mexico a state of war exists between that Government\r\nand the United States\" and \"for the purpose of enabling the Government\r\nof the United States to prosecute said war to a speedy and successful\r\ntermination\" authority was vested in the President to employ the \"naval\r\nand military forces of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been my unalterable purpose since the commencement of hostilities\r\nby Mexico and the declaration of the existence of war by Congress to\r\nprosecute the war in which the country was unavoidably involved with the\r\nutmost energy, with a view to its \"speedy and successful termination\" by\r\nan honorable peace.\r\n\r\nAccordingly all the operations of our naval and military forces have\r\nbeen directed with this view. While the sword has been held in one hand\r\nand our military movements pressed forward into the enemy's country and\r\nits coasts invested by our Navy, the tender of an honorable peace has\r\nbeen constantly presented to Mexico in the other.\r\n\r\nHitherto the overtures of peace which have been made by this Government\r\nhave not been accepted by Mexico. With a view to avoid a protracted war,\r\nwhich hesitancy and delay on our part would be so well calculated to\r\nproduce, I informed you in my annual message of the 8th December last\r\nthat the war would \"continue to be prosecuted with vigor, as the best\r\nmeans of securing peace,\" and recommended to your early and favorable\r\nconsideration the measures proposed by the Secretary of War in his\r\nreport accompanying that message.\r\n\r\nIn my message of the 4th January last these and other measures deemed to\r\nbe essential to the \"speedy and successful termination\" of the war and\r\nthe attainment of a just and honorable peace were recommended to your\r\nearly and favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe worst state of things which could exist in a war with such a power\r\nas Mexico would be a course of indecision and inactivity on our part.\r\nBeing charged by the Constitution and the laws with the conduct of the\r\nwar, I have availed myself of all the means at my command to prosecute\r\nit with energy and vigor.\r\n\r\nThe act \"to raise for a limited time an additional military force, and\r\nfor other purposes,\" and which authorizes the raising of ten additional\r\nregiments to the Regular Army, to serve during the war and to be\r\ndisbanded at its termination, which was presented to me on the 11th\r\ninstant and approved on that day, will constitute an important part of\r\nour military force. These regiments will be raised and moved to the seat\r\nof war with the least practicable delay.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that this act makes no provision for the\r\norganization into brigades and divisions of the increased force which it\r\nauthorizes, nor for the appointment of general officers to command it.\r\nIt will be proper that authority be given by law to make such\r\norganization, and to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, such number of major-generals and brigadier-generals as the\r\nefficiency of the service may demand. The number of officers of these\r\ngrades now in service are not more than are required for their\r\nrespective commands; but further legislative action during your present\r\nsession will, in my judgment, be required, and to which it is my duty\r\nrespectfully to invite your attention.\r\n\r\nShould the war, contrary to my earnest desire, be protracted to the\r\nclose of the term of service of the volunteers now in Mexico, who\r\nengaged for twelve months, an additional volunteer force will probably\r\nbecome necessary to supply their place. Many of the volunteers now\r\nserving in Mexico, it is not doubted, will cheerfully engage at the\r\nconclusion of their present term to serve during the war. They would\r\nconstitute a more efficient force than could be speedily obtained by\r\naccepting the services of any new corps who might offer their services.\r\nThey would have the advantage of the experience and discipline of a\r\nyear's service, and will have become accustomed to the climate and be\r\nin less danger than new levies of suffering from the diseases of the\r\ncountry. I recommend, therefore, that authority be given to accept the\r\nservices of such of the volunteers now in Mexico as the state of the\r\npublic service may require, and who may at the termination of their\r\npresent term voluntarily engage to serve during the war with Mexico,\r\nand that provision be made for commissioning the officers. Should\r\nthis measure receive the favorable consideration of Congress, it is\r\nrecommended that a bounty be granted to them upon their voluntarily\r\nextending their term of service. This would not only be due to these\r\ngallant men, but it would be economy to the Government, because if\r\ndischarged at the end of the twelve months the Government would be bound\r\nto incur a heavy expense in bringing them back to their homes and in\r\nsending to the seat of war new corps of fresh troops to supply their\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 13th of May last the President was authorized to\r\naccept the services of volunteers \"in companies, battalions, squadrons,\r\nand regiments,\" but no provision was made for filling up vacancies which\r\nmight occur by death or discharges from the service on account of\r\nsickness or other casualties. In consequence of this omission many of\r\nthe corps now in service have been much reduced in numbers. Nor was any\r\nprovision made for filling vacancies of regimental or company officers\r\nwho might die or resign. Information has been received at the War\r\nDepartment of the resignation of more than 100 of these officers. They\r\nwere appointed by the State authorities, and no information has been\r\nreceived except in a few instances that their places have been filled;\r\nand the efficiency of the service has been impaired from this cause. To\r\nremedy these defects, I recommend that authority be given to accept the\r\nservices of individual volunteers to fill up the places of such as may\r\ndie or become unfit for the service and be discharged, and that\r\nprovision be also made for filling the places of regimental and company\r\nofficers who may die or resign. By such provisions the volunteer corps\r\nmay be constantly kept full or may approximate the maximum number\r\nauthorized and called into service in the first instance.\r\n\r\nWhile it is deemed to be our true policy to prosecute the war in the\r\nmanner indicated, and thus make the enemy feel its pressure and its\r\nevils, I shall be at all times ready, with the authority conferred on\r\nme by the Constitution and with all the means which may be placed at\r\nmy command by Congress, to conclude a just and honorable peace.\r\n\r\nOf equal importance with an energetic and vigorous prosecution of the\r\nwar are the means required to defray its expenses and to uphold and\r\nmaintain the public credit.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of the 8th December last I submitted for the\r\nconsideration of Congress the propriety of imposing, as a war measure,\r\nrevenue duties on some of the articles now embraced in the free list.\r\nThe principal articles now exempt from duty from which any considerable\r\nrevenue could be derived are tea and coffee. A moderate revenue duty on\r\nthese articles it is estimated would produce annually an amount\r\nexceeding $2,500,000. Though in a period of peace, when ample means\r\ncould be derived from duties on other articles for the support of the\r\nGovernment, it may have been deemed proper not to resort to a duty on\r\nthese articles, yet when the country is engaged in a foreign war and all\r\nour resources are demanded to meet the unavoidable increased expenditure\r\nin maintaining our armies in the field no sound reason is perceived why\r\nwe should not avail ourselves of the revenues which may be derived from\r\nthis source. The objections which have heretofore existed to the\r\nimposition of these duties were applicable to a state of peace, when\r\nthey were not needed. We are now, however, engaged in a foreign war. We\r\nneed money to prosecute it and to maintain the public honor and credit.\r\nIt can not be doubted that the patriotic people of the United States\r\nwould cheerfully and without complaint submit to the payment of this\r\nadditional duty or any other that may be necessary to maintain the honor\r\nof the country, provide for the unavoidable expenses of the Government,\r\nand to uphold the public credit. It is recommended that any duties which\r\nmay be imposed on these articles be limited in their duration to the\r\nperiod of the war.\r\n\r\nAn additional annual revenue, it is estimated, of between half a million\r\nand a million of dollars would be derived from the graduation and\r\nreduction of the price of such of the public lands as have been long\r\noffered in the market at the minimum price established by the existing\r\nlaws and have remained unsold. And in addition to other reasons\r\ncommending the measure to favorable consideration, it is recommended as\r\na financial measure. The duty suggested on tea and coffee and the\r\ngraduation and reduction of the price of the public lands would secure\r\nan additional annual revenue to the Treasury of not less than\r\n$3,000,000, and would thereby prevent the necessity of incurring a\r\npublic debt annually to that amount, the interest on which must be paid\r\nsemiannually, and ultimately the debt itself by a tax on the people.\r\n\r\nIt is a sound policy and one which has long been approved by the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States never to resort to loans\r\nunless in cases of great public emergency, and then only for the\r\nsmallest amount which the public necessities will permit.\r\n\r\nThe increased revenues which the measures now recommended would produce\r\nwould, moreover, enable the Government to negotiate a loan for any\r\nadditional sum which may be found to be needed with more facility and at\r\ncheaper rates than can be done without them.\r\n\r\nUnder the injunction of the Constitution which makes it my duty \"from\r\ntime to time to give to Congress information of the state of the Union\r\nand to recommend to their consideration such measures\" as shall be\r\njudged \"necessary and expedient,\" I respectfully and earnestly invite\r\nthe action of Congress on the measures herein presented for their\r\nconsideration. The public good, as well as a sense of my responsibility\r\nto our common constituents, in my judgment imperiously demands that I\r\nshould present them for your enlightened consideration and invoke\r\nfavorable action upon them before the close of your present session.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

Captain Hawkins, who distinguished himself in\r\nthe defense of Fort Brown, is passed over on the ground of mental\r\nalienation, it being officially reported that he is \"insane,\" on which\r\naccount he was recently sent from the Army in Mexico. He is now in New\r\nYork, and is reported to be \"unable to perform any duty.\" An officer\r\njust returned from the Army in Mexico, and who had recently served with\r\nCaptain Hawkins, informed the Adjutant-General that he was quite\r\nderanged, but that he had hopes of his recovery, as the malady was\r\nprobably caused by sickness. Should these hopes be realized at some\r\nfuture day, Captain Hawkins will then of course be promoted without loss\r\nof rank; meanwhile I respectfully recommend that he be passed over, as\r\nthe declared object of these additional majors (as set forth in the\r\nAdjutant-General's report to this Department of the 30th of July last)\r\nwas to insure the presence of an adequate number of _efficient_ field\r\nofficers for duty with the marching regiments, which object would be\r\nneutralized in part should Captain Hawkins now receive the appointment.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L.

I deem it proper to state that the vacancy\r\nof first lieutenant in the Eighth Infantry, now proposed to be filled by\r\nMr. Hanson's restoration and reappointment, has been occasioned by the\r\nappointment of the senior captain of the regiment to be major under the\r\nrecent act authorizing an additional major to each regiment, being an\r\noriginal vacancy, and therefore the less reason for any objection in\r\nrespect to the general principles and usages of the service, which\r\nguarantee regular promotions to fill vacancies which occur by accident,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L. MARCY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 26, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate the officers named in the accompanying list[13] for brevet\r\npromotion in the Army of the United States, for gallant conduct in the\r\nactions at Monterey.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n  _February 19, 1847_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I present to you the following list[14] of officers engaged in the\r\nactions at Monterey, whose distinguished conduct therein entitles them,\r\nin my judgment, to the promotion by brevet. This list has been prepared\r\nafter a particular and careful examination of all the documents in this\r\nDepartment in relation to the military operations at that place.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Garland and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Childs (then a\r\ncaptain of the line) also behaved in the actions of Monterey in a manner\r\ndeserving of particular notice, but as their names are now before the\r\nSenate for colonelcies by brevet, I have not presented them for further\r\npromotion. I am not aware that any officer below the lineal rank of\r\ncolonel has ever been made a brigadier-general by brevet.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L. MARCY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 27, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report of the Secretary of War, with the\r\naccompanying documents, in answer to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 1st instant, requesting the President \"to\r\ncommunicate to the House of Representatives all the correspondence with\r\nGeneral Taylor since the commencement of hostilities with Mexico which\r\nhas not yet been published, and the publication of which may not be\r\ndeemed detrimental to the public service; also the correspondence of the\r\nQuartermaster-General in relation to transportation for General Taylor's\r\nArmy; also the reports of Brigadier-Generals Hamer and Quitman of the\r\noperations of their respective brigades on the 21st of September last.\"\r\n\r\nAs some of these documents relate to military operations of our forces\r\nwhich may not have been fully executed, I might have deemed it proper to\r\nwithhold parts of them under the apprehension that their publication at\r\nthis time would be detrimental to the public service; but I am satisfied\r\nthat these operations are now so far advanced and that the enemy has\r\nalready received so much information from other sources in relation to\r\nthe intended movements of our Army as to render this precaution\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report of the Secretary of War, with the\r\naccompanying documents, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of the\r\n27th ultimo, requesting to be informed \"why the name of Captain\r\nTheophilus H. Holmes was not sent in for brevet promotion amongst the\r\nother officers who distinguished themselves at the military operations\r\nat Monterey.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War discloses the reasons for the\r\nomission of the name of Captain Holmes in the list of brevet promotions\r\nin my message of the ____ ultimo. Upon the additional testimony in\r\nCaptain Holmes's case which has been received at the War Department, and\r\nto which the Secretary of War refers in his report, I deem it proper to\r\nnominate him for brevet promotion.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate Captain Theophilus H. Holmes, of the Seventh\r\nRegiment of Infantry, to be major by brevet from the 23d September,\r\n1846, in the Army of the United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n  _March,1 1847_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: With a special reference to the resolution of the Senate of the\r\n27th ultimo, requesting to be informed \"why the name of Captain\r\nTheophilus H. Holmes was not sent in for brevet promotion amongst the\r\nother officers who distinguished themselves at the military operations\r\nat Monterey,\" I have again examined the official reports of those\r\noperations. I do not find that Captain Holmes is mentioned in General\r\nTaylor's report, nor in that of any other officer except the report of\r\nBrigadier-General Worth. The following extract from the latter contains\r\nall that is said having relation to the conduct of Captain Holmes:\r\n\r\n\"My thanks are also especially due to Lieutenant-Colonel Stanford,\r\nEighth, commanding First Brigade; Major Munroe, chief of artillery,\r\ngeneral staff; Brevet Major Brown and Captain J.R. Vinton, artillery\r\nbattalion; Captain J.B. Scott, artillery battalion, light troops; Major\r\nScott (commanding) and Captain Merrill, Fifth; Captain Miles\r\n(commanding), Holmes, and Ross, Seventh Infantry, and Captain Screven,\r\ncommanding Eighth Infantry; to Lieutenant-Colonel Walker, captain of\r\nrifles; Major Chevalier and Captain McCulloch, of the Texan, and Captain\r\nBlanchard, of the Louisiana, Volunteers; to Lieutenant Mackall,\r\ncommanding battery; Roland, Martin, Hays, Irons, Clark, and Curd, horse\r\nartillery; Lieutenant Longstreet, commanding light company, Eighth;\r\nLieutenant Ayers, artillery battalion, who was among the first in the\r\nassault upon the place and who secured the colors. Each of the officers\r\nnamed either headed special detachments, columns of attack, storming\r\nparties, or detached guns, and all were conspicuous for conduct and\r\ncourage.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that in this list there are twenty-one officers\r\n(besides the medical staff and officers of volunteers) who are highly\r\ncommended by General Worth for gallant conduct. That they were justly\r\nentitled to the praise bestowed on them is not doubted; but if I had\r\nrecommended all of them to be brevetted, together with all those in the\r\nreports of other generals also in like manner highly commended, the\r\nnumber of officers in my list submitted for your consideration would\r\nhave been probably trebled. Indeed, the whole Army behaved most\r\ngallantly on that occasion. It was deemed proper to discriminate and\r\nselect from among the well deserving those who had peculiar claims to\r\ndistinction. In making this selection I exercised my best judgment,\r\nregarding the official reports as the authentic source of information.\r\nSix or seven only of the officers named in the foregoing extract from\r\nGeneral Worth's report were placed on the list. A close examination of\r\nthe reports will, I think, disclose the ground for the discrimination,\r\nand I hope justify the distinction which I felt it my duty to make.\r\nWithout disparagement to Captain Holmes, whose conduct was highly\r\ncreditable, it appears to me that a rule of selection which would have\r\nbrought him upon the list for promotion by brevet would also have placed\r\non the same list nearly everyone named with him in General Worth's\r\nreport, and many of the reports of other generals not presented in my\r\nreport to you of the 19th ultimo. There is not time before the\r\nadjournment of the Senate to make the thorough examination which a due\r\nregard to the relative claims of the gallant officers engaged in the\r\nactions of Monterey would require if the list of brevet promotions is to\r\nbe enlarged to this extent. Such enlargement would not accord with my\r\nown views on the subject of bestowing brevet rewards.\r\n\r\nThere are on file other papers relative to Captain Holmes. They were not\r\nwritten with reference to his brevet promotion, but for an appointment\r\nin the new regiments. Copies of those are herewith transmitted. The\r\nletter of the Hon. W.P. Mangum inclosing the statement from Generals\r\nTwiggs and Smith is dated the 26th, and my report the 19th ultimo, and\r\nwas not, consequently, received at this Department until some days after\r\nthe list for brevets was made out and presented to you.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts and recommendations of the official reports of the\r\nactions at Monterey I should not feel warranted in presenting Captain\r\nHolmes for brevet promotion without at the same time including on the\r\nsame list many others not recommended in my report of the 19th ultimo;\r\nbut as his conduct fell under the immediate observation of General Smith\r\n(General Twiggs commanded in a different part of the town), it may be\r\nproper to regard their statement, received since my former report was\r\nprepared and handed to you, as additional evidence of his gallantry and\r\nof claims to your particular notice. I therefore recommend him to be\r\npromoted major by brevet.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L.

POLK.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES BUCHANAN,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 23, 1847_.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nSIR: The Government of Mexico having repeatedly rejected the friendly\r\novertures of the United States to open negotiations with a view to the\r\nrestoration of peace, sound policy and a just regard to the interests of\r\nour own country require that the enemy should be made, as far as\r\npracticable, to bear the expenses of a war of which they are the\r\nauthors, and which they obstinately persist in protracting.\r\n\r\nIt is the right of the conqueror to levy contribution upon the enemy in\r\ntheir seaports, towns, or provinces which may be in his military\r\npossession by conquest and to apply the same to defray the expenses of\r\nthe war. The conqueror possesses the right also to establish a temporary\r\nmilitary government over such seaports, towns, or provinces and to\r\nprescribe the conditions and restrictions upon which commerce with such\r\nplaces may be permitted. He may, in his discretion, exclude all trade,\r\nor admit it with limitation or restriction, or impose terms the\r\nobservance of which will be the condition of carrying it on. One of\r\nthese conditions may be the payment of a prescribed rate of duties on\r\ntonnage and imports.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of these unquestioned rights of war, I have, on full\r\nconsideration, determined to order that all the ports or places in\r\nMexico which now are or hereafter may be in the actual possession of our\r\nland and naval forces by conquest shall be opened while our military\r\noccupation may continue to the commerce of all neutral nations, as well\r\nas our own, in articles not contraband of war, upon the payment of\r\nprescribed rates of duties, which will be made known and enforced by our\r\nmilitary and naval commanders.\r\n\r\nWhile the adoption of this policy will be to impose a burden on the\r\nenemy, and at the same time to deprive them of the revenue to be derived\r\nfrom trade at such ports or places, as well as to secure it to\r\nourselves, whereby the expenses of the war maybe diminished, a just\r\nregard to the general interests of commerce and the obvious advantages\r\nof uniformity in the exercise of these belligerent rights require that\r\nwell-considered regulations and restrictions should be prepared for the\r\nguidance of those who may be charged with carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nYou are therefore instructed to examine the existing Mexican tariff of\r\nduties and report to me a schedule of articles of trade to be admitted\r\nat such ports or places as may be at any time in our military\r\npossession, with such rates of duty on them and also on tonnage as will\r\nbe likely to produce the greatest amount of revenue. You will also\r\ncommunicate the considerations which may recommend the scale of duties\r\nwhich you may propose, and will submit such regulations as you may deem\r\nadvisable in order to enforce their collection.\r\n\r\nAs the levy of the contribution proposed is a military right, derived\r\nfrom the laws of nations, the collection and disbursement of the duties\r\nwill be made, under the orders of the Secretary of War and the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, by the military and naval commanders at the ports or places\r\nin Mexico which may be in possession of our arms. The report requested\r\nis therefore necessary in order to enable me to give the proper\r\ndirections to the War and Navy Departments.\r\n\r\nJAMES K POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT, _March 30, 1847_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your instructions of the 23d instant have been received by this\r\nDepartment, and in conformity thereto I present you herewith, for your\r\nconsideration, a scale of duties proposed to be collected as a military\r\ncontribution during the war in the ports of Mexico in possession of our\r\nArmy or Navy by conquest, with regulations for the ascertainment and\r\ncollection of such duties, together with the reasons which appear to me\r\nto recommend their adoption.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we must either adopt our own tariff or that of Mexico,\r\nor establish a new system of duties. Our own tariff could not be\r\nadopted, because the Mexican exports and imports are so different from\r\nour own that different rates of duties are indispensable in order to\r\ncollect the largest revenue. Thus upon many articles produced in great\r\nabundance here duties must be imposed at the lowest rate in order to\r\ncollect any revenue, whereas many of the same articles are not produced\r\nin Mexico, or to a very inconsiderable extent, and would therefore bear\r\nthere a much higher duty for revenue. A great change is also rendered\r\nnecessary by the proposed exaction of duties on all imports to any\r\nMexican port in our possession from any other Mexican port occupied by\r\nus in the same manner. This measure would largely increase the revenue\r\nwhich we might collect. It is recommended, however, for reasons of\r\nobvious safety, that this Mexican coastwise trade should be confined to\r\nour own vessels, as well as the interior trade above any port of entry\r\nin our possession, but that in all other respects the ports of Mexico\r\nheld by us should be freely opened at the rate of duties herein\r\nrecommended to the vessels and commerce of all the world. The _ad\r\nvalorem_ system of duties adopted by us, although by far the most just\r\nand equitable, yet requires an appraisement to ascertain the actual\r\nvalue of every article. This demands great mercantile skill, knowledge,\r\nand experience, and therefore, for the want of skillful appraisers (a\r\nclass of officers wholly unknown in Mexico), could not at once be put\r\ninto successful operation there. If also, as proposed, these duties are\r\nto be ascertained and collected as a military contribution through the\r\nofficers of our Army and Navy, those brave men would more easily perform\r\nalmost any other duty than that of estimating the value of every\r\ndescription of goods, wares, and merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe system of specific duties already prevails in Mexico, and may be put\r\nby us into immediate operation; and if, as conceded, specific duties\r\nshould be more burdensome upon the people of Mexico, the more onerous\r\nthe operation of these duties upon them the sooner it is likely that\r\nthey will force their military rulers to agree to a peace. It is certain\r\nthat a mild and forbearing system of warfare, collecting no duties in\r\ntheir ports in our possession on the Gulf and levying no contributions,\r\nwhilst our armies purchase supplies from them at high prices, by\r\nrendering the war a benefit to the people of Mexico rather than an\r\ninjury has not hastened the conclusion of a peace. It may be, however,\r\nthat specific duties, onerous as they are, and heavy contributions,\r\naccompanied by a vigorous prosecution of the war, may more speedily\r\ninsure that peace which we have failed to obtain from magnanimous\r\nforbearance, from brilliant victories, or from proffered negotiation.\r\nThe duties, however, whilst they may be specific, and therefore more\r\nonerous than _ad valorem_ duties, should not be so high as to defeat\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to adopt as a basis the tariff of Mexico, because the\r\nduties are extravagantly high, defeating importation, commerce, and\r\nrevenue and producing innumerable frauds and smuggling. There are also\r\nsixty articles the importation of which into Mexico is strictly\r\nprohibited by their tariff, embracing most of the necessaries of life\r\nand far the greater portion of our products and fabrics.\r\n\r\nAmong the sixty prohibited articles are sugar, rice, cotton, boots and\r\nhalf-boots, coffee, nails of all kinds, leather of most kinds, flour,\r\ncotton yarn and thread, soap of all kinds, common earthenware, lard,\r\nmolasses, timber of all kinds, saddles of all kinds, coarse woolen\r\ncloth, cloths for cloaks, ready-made clothing of all kinds, salt,\r\ntobacco of all kinds, cotton goods or textures, chiefly such as are made\r\nby ourselves; pork, fresh or salted, smoked or corned; woolen or cotton\r\nblankets or counterpanes, shoes and slippers, wheat and grain of all\r\nkinds. Such is a list of but part of the articles whose importation is\r\nprohibited by the Mexican tariff. These prohibitions should not be\r\npermitted to continue, because they exclude most of our products and\r\nfabrics and prevent the collection of revenue. We turn from the\r\nprohibitions to the actual duties imposed by Mexico. The duties are\r\nspecific throughout, and almost universally by weight, irrespective of\r\nvalue; are generally protective or exorbitant, and without any\r\ndiscrimination for revenue. The duties proposed to be substituted are\r\nmoderate when compared with those imposed by Mexico, being generally\r\nreduced to a standard more than one-half below the Mexican duties. The\r\nduties are also based upon a discrimination throughout for revenue, and,\r\nkeeping in view the customs and habits of the people of Mexico, so\r\ndifferent from our own, are fixed in each case at that rate which it is\r\nbelieved will produce in the Mexican ports the largest amount of\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize from this system the largest amount of revenue, it\r\nwould be necessary that our Army and Navy should seize every important\r\nport or place upon the Gulf of Mexico or California, or on the Pacific,\r\nand open the way through the interior for the free transit of exports\r\nand imports, and especially that the interior passage through the\r\nMexican isthmus should be secured from ocean to ocean, for the benefit\r\nof our commerce and that of all the world. This measure, whilst it would\r\ngreatly increase our revenue from these duties and facilitate\r\ncommunication between our forces upon the eastern and western coasts of\r\nMexico, would probably lead at the conclusion of a peace to results of\r\nincalculable importance to our own commerce and to that of all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Mexican Government monopoly in tobacco, from which a\r\nconsiderable revenue is realized by Mexico, together with the culture\r\nthere which yields that revenue, should be abolished, so as to diminish\r\nthe resources of that Government and augment our own by collecting the\r\nduty upon all the imported tobacco. The Mexican interior transit duties\r\nshould also be abolished, and also their internal Government duty on\r\ncoin and bullion. The prohibition of exports and the duties upon exports\r\nshould be annulled, and especially the heavy export duty on coin and\r\nbullion, so as to cheapen and facilitate the purchase of imports and\r\npermit the precious metals, untaxed, to flow out freely from Mexico into\r\ngeneral circulation. Quicksilver and machinery for working the mines of\r\nprecious metals in Mexico, for the same reasons, should also be admitted\r\nduty free, which, with the measures above indicated, would largely\r\nincrease the production and circulation of the precious metals, improve\r\nour own commerce and industry and that of all neutral powers.\r\n\r\nIn thus opening the ports of Mexico to the commerce of the world you\r\nwill present to all nations with whom we are at peace the best evidence\r\nof your desire to maintain with them our friendly relations, to render\r\nthe war to them productive of as little injury as possible, and even to\r\nadvance their interests, so far as it safely can be done, by affording\r\nto them in common with ourselves the advantages of a liberal commerce\r\nwith Mexico. To extend this commerce, you will have unsealed the ports\r\nof Mexico, repealed their interior transit duties, which obstruct the\r\npassage of merchandise to and from the coast; you will have annulled the\r\nGovernment duty on coin and bullion and abolished the heavy export\r\nduties on the precious metals, so as to permit them to flow out freely\r\nfor the benefit of mankind; you will have expunged the long list of\r\ntheir prohibited articles and reduced more than one-half their duties on\r\nimports, whilst the freest scope would be left for the mining of the\r\nprecious metals. These are great advantages which would be secured to\r\nfriendly nations, especially when compared with the exclusion of their\r\ncommerce by rigorous blockades. It is true, the duties collected from\r\nthese imports would be for the benefit of our own Government, but it is\r\nequally true that the expenses of the war, which Mexico insists upon\r\nprosecuting, are borne exclusively by ourselves, and not by foreign\r\nnations. It can not be doubted but that all neutral nations will see in\r\nthe adoption of such a course by you a manifestation of your good will\r\ntoward them and a strong desire to advance those just and humane\r\nprinciples which make it the duty of belligerents, as we have always\r\ncontended, to render the war in which they are engaged as little\r\ninjurious as practicable to neutral powers.\r\n\r\nThese duties would not be imposed upon any imports into our own country,\r\nbut only upon imports into Mexico, and the tax would fall upon the\r\npeople of Mexico in the enhancement to them of the prices of these\r\nimports. Nearly all our own products are excluded by the Mexican tariff\r\neven in time of peace; they are excluded also during the war so far as\r\nwe continue the system of blockading any of the ports of Mexico; and\r\nthey are also excluded even from the ports not blockaded in possession\r\nof Mexico; whereas the new system would soon open to our commerce all\r\nthe ports of Mexico as they shall fall into our military possession.\r\nNeither our own nor foreign merchants are required to send any goods to\r\nMexico, and if they do so voluntarily it will be because they can make a\r\nprofit upon the importation there, and therefore they will have no right\r\nto complain of the duties levied in the ports of Mexico upon the\r\nconsumers of those goods--the people of Mexico. The whole money\r\ncollected would inure to the benefit of our own Government and people,\r\nto sustain the war and to prevent to that extent new loans and increased\r\ntaxation. Indeed, in view of the fact that the Government is thrown upon\r\nthe ordinary revenues for peace, with no other additional resources but\r\nloans to carry on the war, the income to be derived from the new system,\r\nwhich it is believed will be large if these suggestions are adopted,\r\nwould be highly important to sustain the credit of the Government, to\r\nprevent the embarrassment of the Treasury, and to save the country from\r\nsuch ruinous sacrifices as occurred during the last war, including the\r\ninevitable legacy to posterity of a large public debt and onerous\r\ntaxation. The new system would not only arrest the expensive transfer\r\nand ruinous drain of specie to Mexico, but would cause it, in duties and\r\nin return for our exports, to reflow into our country to an amount,\r\nperhaps, soon exceeding the $9,000,000 which it had reached in 1835 even\r\nunder the restrictive laws of Mexico, thus relieving our own people from\r\na grievous tax and imposing it where it should fall, upon our enemies,\r\nthe people of Mexico, as a contribution levied upon them to conquer a\r\npeace as well as to defray the expenses of the war; whereas by admitting\r\nour exports freely, without duty, into the Mexican ports which we may\r\noccupy from time to time, and affording those goods, including the\r\nnecessaries of life, at less than one-half the prices which they had\r\nheretofore paid for them, the war might in time become a benefit instead\r\nof a burden to the people of Mexico, and they would therefore be\r\nunwilling to terminate the contest. It is hoped also that Mexico, after\r\na peace, will never renew her present prohibitory and protective system,\r\nso nearly resembling that of ancient China or Japan, but that,\r\nliberalized, enlightened, and regenerated by the contact and intercourse\r\nwith our people and those of other civilized nations, she will continue\r\nthe far more moderate system of duties resembling that prescribed by\r\nthese regulations.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is not just that Mexico, by her obstinate persistence\r\nin this contest, should compel us to overthrow our own financial policy\r\nand arrest this great nation in her high and prosperous career. To\r\nreimpose high duties would be alike injurious to ourselves and to all\r\nneutral powers, and, unless demanded by a stern necessity, ungenerous to\r\nthose enlightened nations which have adopted cotemporaneously with us a\r\nmore liberal commercial policy. The system you now propose of imposing\r\nthe burden as far as practicable upon our enemies, the people of Mexico,\r\nand not upon ourselves or upon friendly nations, appears to be most just\r\nin itself, and is further recommended as the only policy which is likely\r\nto hasten the conclusion of a just and honorable peace.\r\n\r\nA tonnage duty on all vessels, whether our own or of neutral powers, of\r\n$1 per ton, which is greatly less than that imposed by Mexico, is\r\nrecommended in lieu of all port duties and charges. Appended to these\r\nregulations are tables of the rates at which foreign money is fixed by\r\nlaw, as also a separate table of currencies by usage, in which a\r\ncertificate of value is required to be attached to the invoice. There is\r\nalso annexed a table of foreign weights and measures reduced to the\r\nstandard of the United States, together with blank forms to facilitate\r\nthe transaction of business.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the duties herein suggested shall be collected\r\nexclusively in gold or silver coin. These duties can only be collected\r\nas a military contribution through the agency of our brave officers of\r\nthe Army and Navy, who will no doubt cheerfully and faithfully collect\r\nand keep these moneys and account for them, not to the Treasury, but to\r\nthe Secretaries of War or of the Navy, respectively.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that these duties be performed by the commandant of\r\nthe port, whether naval or military, aided by the paymaster or purser or\r\nother officer, the accounts of each being countersigned by the other, as\r\na check upon mistakes or error, in the same manner as is now the case\r\nwith the collector and naval officer of our several principal ports,\r\nwhich has introduced so much order and accuracy in our system. It is\r\nsuggested that as in some cases the attention of the commandant of the\r\nport might be necessary for the performance of other duties that he be\r\npermitted to substitute some other officer, making known the fact to the\r\nSecretaries of War or of the Navy, and subject to their direction.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nR.J. WALKER,\r\n  _Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 31, 1847_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[15] Being charged by the Constitution with the prosecution of the\r\nexisting war with Mexico, I deem it proper, in the exercise of an\r\nundoubted belligerent right, to order that military contributions be\r\nlevied upon the enemy in such of their ports or other places as now are\r\nor may be hereafter in the possession of our land and naval forces by\r\nconquest, and that the same be collected and applied toward defraying\r\nthe expenses of the war. As one means of effecting this object, the\r\nblockade at such conquered ports will be raised, and they will be opened\r\nto our own commerce and that of all neutral nations in articles not\r\ncontraband of war during our military occupation of them, and duties on\r\ntonnage and imports will be levied and collected through the agency of\r\nour military and naval officers in command at such ports, acting under\r\norders from the War and Navy Departments.\r\n\r\nI transmit to you herewith, for your information and guidance, a copy of\r\na communication addressed by me to the Secretary of the Treasury on the\r\n23d instant, instructing him to examine the existing Mexican tariff and\r\nto report to me, for my consideration, a scale of duties which he would\r\nrecommend to be levied on tonnage and imports in such conquered ports,\r\ntogether with such regulations as he would propose as necessary and\r\nproper in order to carry this policy into effect; and also a copy of the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury made on the 30th instant in\r\nanswer to my communication to him. The scale of duties and the\r\nregulations for their collection as military contributions exacted from\r\nthe enemy, recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury in this report,\r\nhave been approved by me.\r\n\r\nYou will, after consulting with the Secretary of the Navy, so as to\r\nsecure concert of action between the War and Navy Departments, issue\r\nthe necessary orders to carry the measure proposed into immediate effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Addressed to the Secretaries of War and of the Navy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT, _June 10, 1847_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: In compliance with your directions, I have examined the questions\r\npresented by the Secretary of War in regard to the military\r\ncontributions proposed to be levied in Mexico under the tariff and\r\nregulations sanctioned by you on the 31st of March last, and\r\nrespectfully recommend the following modifications, namely:\r\n\r\nFirst. On all manufactures of cotton, or of cotton mixed with any other\r\nmaterial except wool, worsted, and silk, in the piece or in any other\r\nform, a duty, as a military contribution, of 30 per cent _ad valorem_.\r\n\r\nSecond. When goods on which the duties are levied by weight are imported\r\ninto said ports in the package, the duties shall be collected on the net\r\nweight only; and in all cases an allowance shall be made for all\r\ndeficiencies, leakage, breakage, or damage proved to have actually\r\noccurred during the voyage of importation, and made known before the\r\ngoods are warehoused.\r\n\r\nThird. The period named in the eighth of said regulations during which\r\nthe goods may remain in warehouse before the payment of duties is\r\nextended from thirty to ninety days, and within said period of ninety\r\ndays any portion of the said goods on which the duties, as a military\r\ncontribution, have been paid may be taken, after such payment, from the\r\nwarehouse and entered free of any further duty at any other port or\r\nports of Mexico in our military possession, the facts of the case, with\r\na particular description of said goods and a statement that the duties\r\nthereon have been paid, being certified by the proper officer of the\r\nport or ports of reshipment.\r\n\r\nFourth. It is intended to provide by the treaty of peace that all goods\r\nimported during the war into any of the Mexican ports in our military\r\npossession shall be exempt from any new import duty or confiscation by\r\nMexico in the same manner as if said goods had been imported and paid\r\nthe import duties prescribed by the Government of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMost respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nR.J. WALKER,\r\n  _Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 11, 1847.\r\n\r\nThe modifications as above recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nare approved by me, and the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the\r\nNavy will give the proper orders to carry them into effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT, _November 5, 1847_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: The military contributions in the form of duties upon imports into\r\nMexican ports have been levied by the Departments of War and of the Navy\r\nduring the last six months under your order of the 31st of March last,\r\nand in view of the experience of the practical operation of the system\r\nI respectfully recommend the following modifications in some of its\r\ndetails, which will largely augment the revenue:\r\n\r\nThat the duty on silk, flax, hemp or grass, cotton, wool, worsted or any\r\nmanufactures of the same, or of either or mixtures thereof; coffee,\r\nteas, sugar, molasses, tobacco and all manufactures thereof, including\r\ncigars and cigarritos; glass, china, and stoneware, iron and steel and\r\nall manufactures of either not prohibited, be 30 per cent _ad valorem_;\r\non copper and all manufactures thereof, tallow, tallow candles, soap,\r\nfish, beef, pork, hams, bacon, tongues, butter, lard, cheese, rice,\r\nIndian corn and meal, potatoes, wheat, rye, oats, and all other grain,\r\nrye meal and oat meal, flour, whale and sperm oil, clocks, boots and\r\nshoes, pumps, bootees and slippers, bonnets, hats, caps, beer, ale,\r\nporter, cider, timber, boards, planks, scantling, shingles, laths,\r\npitch, tar, rosin, turpentine, spirits of turpentine, vinegar, apples,\r\nship bread, hides, leather and manufactures thereof, and paper of all\r\nkinds, 20 per cent _ad valorem;_ and these reduced rates shall also\r\napply to all goods on which the duties are not paid remaining not\r\nexceeding ninety days in deposit in the Mexican ports, introduced under\r\nprevious regulations enforcing military contributions.\r\n\r\nYours, most respectfully,\r\n\r\nR.J. WALKER,\r\n  _Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 6, 1847.\r\n\r\nThe modifications as above recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nare approved by me, and the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the\r\nNavy will give the proper orders to carry them into effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT, _November 16, 1847_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: With a view to augment the military contributions now collected by\r\nthe Departments of War and of the Navy under your order of the 31st of\r\nMarch last, I recommend that the export duty exacted before the war by\r\nthe Government of Mexico be now collected at the port of exportation by\r\nthe same officers of the Army or Navy of the United States in the\r\nMexican ports in our possession who are authorized to collect the import\r\nduties, abolishing, however, the prohibition of export established in\r\ncertain cases by the Mexican Government, as also all interior transit\r\nduties; dispensing also with the necessity of any certificate of having\r\npaid any duty to the Mexican Government.\r\n\r\nThe export duty would then be as follows:\r\n\r\n  _____________________________________________________________\r\n                                                      Per cent.\r\n  Gold, coined or wrought                                 3\r\n  Silver, coined                                          6\r\n  Silver, wrought, with or without certificate\r\n    of having paid any duty to the Mexican Government     7\r\n  Silver, refined or pure, wrought in ingots,\r\n    with or without certificate of having paid\r\n    the Mexican Government duty                           7\r\n  Gold, unwrought or in a state of ore or dust            3\r\n  Silver, unwrought or in a state of ore                  7\r\n  _____________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWhere gold or silver in any form is taken from any interior Mexican city\r\nin our military possession, the export duty must be paid there to the\r\nofficer of the United States commanding, and his certificate of such\r\nprepayment must be produced at the Mexican port of exportation;\r\notherwise a double duty will be collected upon the arrival of such gold\r\nor silver at the Mexican port of exportation. Whenever it is\r\npracticable, all internal taxes of every description, whether upon\r\npersons or property, exacted by the Government of Mexico, or by any\r\ndepartment, town, or city thereof, should be collected by our military\r\nofficers in possession and appropriated as a military contribution\r\ntoward defraying the expenses of the war, excluding however, all duties\r\non the transit of goods from one department to another, which duties,\r\nbeing prejudicial to revenue and restrictive of the exchange of imports\r\nfor exports, were abolished by your order of the 31st of March last.\r\n\r\nYours, most respectfully,\r\n\r\nR.J. WALKER\r\n  _Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 16, 1847.\r\n\r\nThe modifications and military contributions as above recommended by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury are approved by me, and the Secretary of War\r\nand the Secretary of the Navy will give the proper orders to carry them\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of Congress is always an interesting event. The\r\nrepresentatives of the States and of the people come fresh from their\r\nconstituents to take counsel together for the common good.\r\n\r\nAfter an existence of near three-fourths of a century as a free and\r\nindependent Republic, the problem no longer remains to be solved whether\r\nman is capable of self-government. The success of our admirable system\r\nis a conclusive refutation of the theories of those in other countries\r\nwho maintain that a \"favored few\" are born to rule and that the mass of\r\nmankind must be governed by force. Subject to no arbitrary or hereditary\r\nauthority, the people are the only sovereigns recognized by our\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nNumerous emigrants, of every lineage and language, attracted by the\r\ncivil and religious freedom we enjoy and by our happy condition,\r\nannually crowd to our shores, and transfer their heart, not less than\r\ntheir allegiance, to the country whose dominion belongs alone to the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nNo country has been so much favored, or should acknowledge with deeper\r\nreverence the manifestations of the divine protection. An all-wise\r\nCreator directed and guarded us in our infant struggle for freedom and\r\nhas constantly watched over our surprising progress until we have become\r\none of the great nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is in a country thus favored, and under a Government in which the\r\nexecutive and legislative branches hold their authority for limited\r\nperiods alike from the people, and where all are responsible to their\r\nrespective constituencies, that it is again my duty to communicate with\r\nCongress upon the state of the Union and the present condition of public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the most gratifying proofs are presented that our\r\ncountry has been blessed with a widespread and universal prosperity.\r\nThere has been no period since the Government was founded when all the\r\nindustrial pursuits of our people have been more successful or when\r\nlabor in all branches of business has received a fairer or better\r\nreward. From our abundance we have been enabled to perform the pleasing\r\nduty of furnishing food for the starving millions of less favored\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn the enjoyment of the bounties of Providence at home such as have\r\nrarely fallen to the lot of any people, it is cause of congratulation\r\nthat our intercourse with all the powers of the earth except Mexico\r\ncontinues to be of an amicable character.\r\n\r\nIt has ever been our cherished policy to cultivate peace and good will\r\nwith all nations, and this policy has been steadily pursued by me.\r\n\r\nNo change has taken place in our relations with Mexico since the\r\nadjournment of the last Congress. The war in which the United States\r\nwere forced to engage with the Government of that country still\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\nI deem it unnecessary, after the full exposition of them contained in my\r\nmessage of the 11th of May, 1846, and in my annual message at the\r\ncommencement of the session of Congress in December last, to reiterate\r\nthe serious causes of complaint which we had against Mexico before she\r\ncommenced hostilities.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient on the present occasion to say that the wanton\r\nviolation of the rights of person and property of our citizens committed\r\nby Mexico, her repeated acts of bad faith through a long series of\r\nyears, and her disregard of solemn treaties stipulating for indemnity to\r\nour injured citizens not only constituted ample cause of war on our\r\npart, but were of such an aggravated character as would have justified\r\nus before the whole world in resorting to this extreme remedy. With an\r\nanxious desire to avoid a rupture between the two countries, we forbore\r\nfor years to assert our clear rights by force, and continued to seek\r\nredress for the wrongs we had suffered by amicable negotiation in the\r\nhope that Mexico might yield to pacific counsels and the demands of\r\njustice. In this hope we were disappointed. Our minister of peace sent\r\nto Mexico was insultingly rejected. The Mexican Government refused even\r\nto hear the terms of adjustment which he was authorized to propose, and\r\nfinally, under wholly unjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries\r\nin war by invading the territory of the State of Texas, striking the\r\nfirst blow, and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil.\r\n\r\nThough the United States were the aggrieved nation, Mexico commenced the\r\nwar, and we were compelled in self-defense to repel the invader and to\r\nvindicate the national honor and interests by prosecuting it with vigor\r\nuntil we could obtain a just and honorable peace.\r\n\r\nOn learning that hostilities had been commenced by Mexico I promptly\r\ncommunicated that fact, accompanied with a succinct statement of our\r\nother causes of complaint against Mexico, to Congress, and that body, by\r\nthe act of the 13th of May, 1846, declared that \"by the act of the\r\nRepublic of Mexico a state of war exists between that Government and the\r\nUnited States.\" This act declaring \"the war to exist by the act of the\r\nRepublic of Mexico,\" and making provision for its prosecution \"to a\r\nspeedy and successful termination,\" was passed with great unanimity by\r\nCongress, there being but two negative votes in the Senate and but\r\nfourteen in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the war having thus been declared by Congress, it\r\nbecame my duty under the Constitution and the laws to conduct and\r\nprosecute it. This duty has been performed, and though at every stage of\r\nits progress I have manifested a willingness to terminate it by a just\r\npeace, Mexico has refused to accede to any terms which could be accepted\r\nby the United States consistently with the national honor and interest.\r\n\r\nThe rapid and brilliant successes of our arms and the vast extent of the\r\nenemy's territory which had been overrun and conquered before the close\r\nof the last session of Congress were fully known to that body. Since\r\nthat time the war has been prosecuted with increased energy, and, I am\r\ngratified to state, with a success which commands universal admiration.\r\nHistory presents no parallel of so many glorious victories achieved by\r\nany nation within so short a period. Our Army, regulars and volunteers,\r\nhave covered themselves with imperishable honors. Whenever and wherever\r\nour forces have encountered the enemy, though he was in vastly superior\r\nnumbers and often intrenched in fortified positions of his own selection\r\nand of great strength, he has been defeated. Too much praise can not be\r\nbestowed upon our officers and men, regulars and volunteers, for their\r\ngallantry, discipline, indomitable courage, and perseverance, all\r\nseeking the post of danger and vying with each other in deeds of noble\r\ndaring.\r\n\r\nWhile every patriot's heart must exult and a just national pride animate\r\nevery bosom in beholding the high proofs of courage, consummate military\r\nskill, steady discipline, and humanity to the vanquished enemy exhibited\r\nby our gallant Army, the nation is called to mourn over the loss of many\r\nbrave officers and soldiers, who have fallen in defense of their\r\ncountry's honor and interests. The brave dead met their melancholy fate\r\nin a foreign land, nobly discharging their duty, and with their\r\ncountry's flag waving triumphantly in the face of the foe. Their\r\npatriotic deeds are justly appreciated, and will long be remembered by\r\ntheir grateful countrymen. The parental care of the Government they\r\nloved and served should be extended to their surviving families.\r\n\r\nShortly after the adjournment of the last session of Congress the\r\ngratifying intelligence was received of the signal victory of Buena\r\nVista, and of the fall of the city of Vera Cruz, and with it the strong\r\ncastle of San Juan de Ulloa, by which it was defended. Believing that\r\nafter these and other successes so honorable to our arms and so\r\ndisastrous to Mexico the period was propitious to afford her another\r\nopportunity, if she thought proper to embrace it, to enter into\r\nnegotiations for peace, a commissioner was appointed to proceed to the\r\nheadquarters of our Army with full powers to enter upon negotiations and\r\nto conclude a just and honorable treaty of peace. He was not directed to\r\nmake any new overtures of peace, but was the bearer of a dispatch from\r\nthe Secretary of State of the United States to the minister of foreign\r\naffairs of Mexico, in reply to one received from the latter of the 22d\r\nof February, 1847, in which the Mexican Government was informed of his\r\nappointment and of his presence at the headquarters of our Army, and\r\nthat he was invested with full powers to conclude a definitive treaty of\r\npeace whenever the Mexican Government might signify a desire to do so.\r\nWhile I was unwilling to subject the United States to another indignant\r\nrefusal, I was yet resolved that the evils of the war should not be\r\nprotracted a day longer than might be rendered absolutely necessary by\r\nthe Mexican Government.\r\n\r\nCare was taken to give no instructions to the commissioner which could\r\nin any way interfere with our military operations or relax our energies\r\nin the prosecution of the war. He possessed no authority in any manner\r\nto control these operations. He was authorized to exhibit his\r\ninstructions to the general in command of the Army, and in the event of\r\na treaty being concluded and ratified on the part of Mexico he was\r\ndirected to give him notice of that fact. On the happening of such\r\ncontingency, and on receiving notice thereof, the general in command was\r\ninstructed by the Secretary of War to suspend further active military\r\noperations until further orders. These instructions were given with a\r\nview to intermit hostilities until the treaty thus ratified by Mexico\r\ncould be transmitted to Washington and receive the action of the\r\nGovernment of the United States. The commissioner was also directed on\r\nreaching the Army to deliver to the general in command the dispatch\r\nwhich he bore from the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign\r\naffairs of Mexico, and on receiving it the general was instructed by the\r\nSecretary of War to cause it to be transmitted to the commander of the\r\nMexican forces, with a request that it might be communicated to his\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner did not reach the headquarters of the Army until after\r\nanother brilliant victory had crowned our arms at Cerro Gordo.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch which he bore from the Secretary of War to the general in\r\ncommand of the Army was received by that officer, then at Jalapa, on the\r\n7th of May, 1847, together with the dispatch from the Secretary of State\r\nto the minister of foreign affairs of Mexico, having been transmitted to\r\nhim from Vera Cruz. The commissioner arrived at the headquarters of the\r\nArmy a few days afterwards. His presence with the Army and his\r\ndiplomatic character were made known to the Mexican Government from\r\nPuebla on the 12th of June, 1847, by the transmission of the dispatch\r\nfrom the Secretary of State to the minister of foreign affairs of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nMany weeks elapsed after its receipt, and no overtures were made nor was\r\nany desire expressed by the Mexican Government to enter into\r\nnegotiations for peace.\r\n\r\nOur Army pursued its march upon the capital, and as it approached it was\r\nmet by formidable resistance. Our forces first encountered the enemy,\r\nand achieved signal victories in the severely contested battles of\r\nContreras and Churubusco. It was not until after these actions had\r\nresulted in decisive victories and the capital of the enemy was within\r\nour power that the Mexican Government manifested any disposition to\r\nenter into negotiations for peace, and even then, as events have proved,\r\nthere is too much reason to believe they were insincere, and that in\r\nagreeing to go through the forms of negotiation the object was to gain\r\ntime to strengthen the defenses of their capital and to prepare for\r\nfresh resistance.\r\n\r\nThe general in command of the Army deemed it expedient to suspend\r\nhostilities temporarily by entering into an armistice with a view to the\r\nopening of negotiations. Commissioners were appointed on the part of\r\nMexico to meet the commissioner on the part of the United States. The\r\nresult of the conferences which took place between these functionaries\r\nof the two Governments was a failure to conclude a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner of the United States took with him the project of a\r\ntreaty already prepared, by the terms of which the indemnity required by\r\nthe United States was a cession of territory.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the only indemnity which it is in the power of\r\nMexico to make in satisfaction of the just and long-deferred claims of\r\nour citizens against her and the only means by which she can reimburse\r\nthe United States for the expenses of the war is a cession to the United\r\nStates of a portion of her territory. Mexico has no money to pay, and no\r\nother means of making the required indemnity. If we refuse this, we can\r\nobtain nothing else. To reject indemnity by refusing to accept a cession\r\nof territory would be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the\r\nwar, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite object.\r\n\r\nA state of war abrogates treaties previously existing between the\r\nbelligerents and a treaty of peace puts an end to all claims for\r\nindemnity for tortious acts committed under the authority of one\r\ngovernment against the citizens or subjects of another unless they are\r\nprovided for in its stipulations. A treaty of peace which would\r\nterminate the existing war without providing for indemnity would enable\r\nMexico, the acknowledged debtor and herself the aggressor in the war, to\r\nrelieve herself from her just liabilities. By such a treaty our citizens\r\nwho hold just demands against her would have no remedy either against\r\nMexico or their own Government. Our duty to these citizens must forever\r\nprevent such a peace, and no treaty which does not provide ample means\r\nof discharging these demands can receive my sanction.\r\n\r\nA treaty of peace should settle all existing differences between the two\r\ncountries. If an adequate cession of territory should be made by such a\r\ntreaty, the United States should release Mexico from all her liabilities\r\nand assume their payment to our own citizens. If instead of this the\r\nUnited States were to consent to a treaty by which Mexico should again\r\nengage to pay the heavy amount of indebtedness which a just indemnity to\r\nour Government and our citizens would impose on her, it is notorious\r\nthat she does not possess the means to meet such an undertaking. From\r\nsuch a treaty no result could be anticipated but the same irritating\r\ndisappointments which have heretofore attended the violations of similar\r\ntreaty stipulations on the part of Mexico. Such a treaty would be but a\r\ntemporary cessation of hostilities, without the restoration of the\r\nfriendship and good understanding which should characterize the future\r\nintercourse between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThat Congress contemplated the acquisition of territorial indemnity when\r\nthat body made provision for the prosecution of the war is obvious.\r\nCongress could not have meant when, in May, 1846, they appropriated\r\n$10,000,000 and authorized the President to employ the militia and naval\r\nand military forces of the United States and to accept the services of\r\n50,000 volunteers to enable him to prosecute the war, and when, at their\r\nlast session, and after our Army had invaded Mexico, they made\r\nadditional appropriations and authorized the raising of additional\r\ntroops for the same purpose, that no indemnity was to be obtained from\r\nMexico at the conclusion of the war; and yet it was certain that if no\r\nMexican territory was acquired no indemnity could be obtained. It is\r\nfurther manifest that Congress contemplated territorial indemnity from\r\nthe fact that at their last session an act was passed, upon the\r\nExecutive recommendation, appropriating $3,000,000 with that express\r\nobject. This appropriation was made \"to enable the President to conclude\r\na treaty of peace, limits, and boundaries with the Republic of Mexico,\r\nto be used by him in the event that said treaty, when signed by the\r\nauthorized agents of the two Governments and duly ratified by Mexico,\r\nshall call for the expenditure of the same or any part thereof.\" The\r\nobject of asking this appropriation was distinctly stated in the several\r\nmessages on the subject which I communicated to Congress. Similar\r\nappropriations made in 1803 and 1806, which were referred to, were\r\nintended to be applied in part consideration for the cession of\r\nLouisiana and the Floridas. In like manner it was anticipated that in\r\nsettling the terms of a treaty of \"limits and boundaries\" with Mexico a\r\ncession of territory estimated to be of greater value than the amount of\r\nour demands against her might be obtained, and that the prompt payment\r\nof this sum in part consideration for the territory ceded, on the\r\nconclusion of a treaty and its ratification on her part, might be an\r\ninducement with her to make such a cession of territory as would be\r\nsatisfactory to the United States; and although the failure to conclude\r\nsuch a treaty has rendered it unnecessary to use any part of the\r\n$3,000,000 appropriated by that act, and the entire sum remains in the\r\nTreasury, it is still applicable to that object should the contingency\r\noccur making such application proper.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of no territory is the doctrine of no indemnity, and if\r\nsanctioned would be a public acknowledgment that our country was wrong\r\nand that the war declared by Congress with extraordinary unanimity was\r\nunjust and should be abandoned--an admission unfounded in fact and\r\ndegrading to the national character.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the treaty proposed by the United States were not only just\r\nto Mexico, but, considering the character and amount of our claims, the\r\nunjustifiable and unprovoked commencement of hostilities by her, the\r\nexpenses of the war to which we have been subjected, and the success\r\nwhich had attended our arms, were deemed to be of a most liberal\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner of the United States was authorized to agree to the\r\nestablishment of the Rio Grande as the boundary from its entrance into\r\nthe Gulf to its intersection with the southern boundary of New Mexico,\r\nin north latitude about 32°, and to obtain a cession to the United\r\nStates of the Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias and the\r\nprivilege of the right of way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The\r\nboundary of the Rio Grande and the cession to the United States of New\r\nMexico and Upper California constituted an ultimatum which our\r\ncommissioner was under no circumstances to yield.\r\n\r\nThat it might be manifest, not only to Mexico, but to all other nations,\r\nthat the United States were not disposed to take advantage of a feeble\r\npower by insisting upon wresting from her all the other Provinces,\r\nincluding many of her principal towns and cities, which we had conquered\r\nand held in our military occupation, but were willing to conclude a\r\ntreaty in a spirit of liberality, our commissioner was authorized to\r\nstipulate for the restoration to Mexico of all our other conquests.\r\n\r\nAs the territory to be acquired by the boundary proposed might be\r\nestimated to be of greater value than a fair equivalent for our just\r\ndemands, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the payment of\r\nsuch additional pecuniary consideration as was deemed reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe terms of a treaty proposed by the Mexican commissioners were wholly\r\ninadmissible. They negotiated as if Mexico were the victorious, and not\r\nthe vanquished, party. They must have known that their ultimatum could\r\nnever be accepted. It required the United States to dismember Texas by\r\nsurrendering to Mexico that part of the territory of that State lying\r\nbetween the Nueces and the Rio Grande, included within her limits by her\r\nlaws when she was an independent republic, and when she was annexed to\r\nthe United States and admitted by Congress as one of the States of our\r\nUnion. It contained no provision for the payment by Mexico of the just\r\nclaims of our citizens. It required indemnity to Mexican citizens for\r\ninjuries they may have sustained by our troops in the prosecution of the\r\nwar. It demanded the right for Mexico to levy and collect the Mexican\r\ntariff of duties on goods imported into her ports while in our military\r\noccupation during the war, and the owners of which had paid to officers\r\nof the United States the military contributions which had been levied\r\nupon them; and it offered to cede to the United States, for a pecuniary\r\nconsideration, that part of Upper California lying north of latitude\r\n37°. Such were the unreasonable terms proposed by the Mexican\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\nThe cession to the United States by Mexico of the Provinces of New\r\nMexico and the Californias, as proposed by the commissioner of the\r\nUnited States, it was believed would be more in accordance with the\r\nconvenience and interests of both nations than any other cession of\r\nterritory which it was probable Mexico could be induced to make.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest to all who have observed the actual condition of the\r\nMexican Government for some years past and at present that if these\r\nProvinces should be retained by her she could not long continue to hold\r\nand govern them. Mexico is too feeble a power to govern these Provinces,\r\nlying as they do at a distance of more than 1,000 miles from her\r\ncapital, and if attempted to be retained by her they would constitute\r\nbut for a short time even nominally a part of her dominions. This would\r\nbe especially the case with Upper California.\r\n\r\nThe sagacity of powerful European nations has long since directed their\r\nattention to the commercial importance of that Province, and there can\r\nbe little doubt that the moment the United States shall relinquish their\r\npresent occupation of it and their claim to it as indemnity an effort\r\nwould be made by some foreign power to possess it, either by conquest or\r\nby purchase. If no foreign government should acquire it in either of\r\nthese modes, an independent revolutionary government would probably be\r\nestablished by the inhabitants and such foreigners as may remain in or\r\nremove to the country as soon as it shall be known that the United\r\nStates have abandoned it. Such a government would be too feeble long to\r\nmaintain its separate independent existence, and would finally become\r\nannexed to or be a dependent colony of some more powerful state.\r\n\r\nShould any foreign government attempt to possess it as a colony, or\r\notherwise to incorporate it with itself, the principle avowed by\r\nPresident Monroe in 1824, and reaffirmed in my first annual message,\r\nthat no foreign power shall with our consent be permitted to plant or\r\nestablish any new colony or dominion on any part of the North American\r\ncontinent must be maintained. In maintaining this principle and in\r\nresisting its invasion by any foreign power we might be involved in\r\nother wars more expensive and more difficult than that in which we are\r\nnow engaged.\r\n\r\nThe Provinces of New Mexico and the Californias are contiguous to the\r\nterritories of the United States, and if brought under the government of\r\nour laws their resources--mineral, agricultural, manufacturing, and\r\ncommercial--would soon be developed.\r\n\r\nUpper California is bounded on the north by our Oregon possessions, and\r\nif held by the United States would soon be settled by a hardy,\r\nenterprising, and intelligent portion of our population. The Bay of San\r\nFrancisco and other harbors along the Californian coast would afford\r\nshelter for our Navy, for our numerous whale ships, and other merchant\r\nvessels employed in the Pacific Ocean, and would in a short period\r\nbecome the marts of an extensive and profitable commerce with China and\r\nother countries of the East.\r\n\r\nThese advantages, in which the whole commercial world would participate,\r\nwould at once be secured to the United States by the cession of this\r\nterritory; while it is certain that as long as it remains a part of the\r\nMexican dominions they can be enjoyed neither by Mexico herself nor by\r\nany other nation.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico is a frontier Province, and has never been of any\r\nconsiderable value to Mexico. From its locality it is naturally\r\nconnected with our Western settlements. The territorial limits of the\r\nState of Texas, too, as defined by her laws before her admission into\r\nour Union, embrace all that portion of New Mexico lying east of the Rio\r\nGrande, while Mexico still claims to hold this territory as a part of\r\nher dominions. The adjustment of this question of boundary is important.\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration which induced the belief that the Mexican\r\nGovernment might even desire to place this Province under the protection\r\nof the Government of the United States. Numerous bands of fierce and\r\nwarlike savages wander over it and upon its borders. Mexico has been and\r\nmust continue to be too feeble to restrain them from committing\r\ndepredations, robberies, and murders, not only upon the inhabitants of\r\nNew Mexico itself, but upon those of the other northern States of\r\nMexico. It would be a blessing to all these northern States to have\r\ntheir citizens protected against them by the power of the United States.\r\nAt this moment many Mexicans, principally females and children, are in\r\ncaptivity among them. If New Mexico were held and governed by the United\r\nStates, we could effectually prevent these tribes from committing such\r\noutrages, and compel them to release these captives and restore them to\r\ntheir families and friends.\r\n\r\nIn proposing to acquire New Mexico and the Californias, it was known\r\nthat but an inconsiderable portion of the Mexican people would be\r\ntransferred with them, the country embraced within these Provinces being\r\nchiefly an uninhabited region.\r\n\r\nThese were the leading considerations which induced me to authorize the\r\nterms of peace which were proposed to Mexico. They were rejected, and,\r\nnegotiations being at an end, hostilities were renewed. An assault was\r\nmade by our gallant Army upon the strongly fortified places near the\r\ngates of the City of Mexico and upon the city itself, and after several\r\ndays of severe conflict the Mexican forces, vastly superior in number to\r\nour own, were driven from the city, and it was occupied by our troops.\r\n\r\nImmediately after information was received of the unfavorable result of\r\nthe negotiations, believing that his continued presence with the Army\r\ncould be productive of no good, I determined to recall our commissioner.\r\nA dispatch to this effect was transmitted to him on the 6th of October\r\nlast. The Mexican Government will be informed of his recall, and that in\r\nthe existing state of things I shall not deem it proper to make any\r\nfurther overtures of peace, but shall be at all times ready to receive\r\nand consider any proposals which may be made by Mexico.\r\n\r\nSince the liberal proposition of the United States was authorized to be\r\nmade, in April last, large expenditures have been incurred and the\r\nprecious blood of many of our patriotic fellow-citizens has been shed in\r\nthe prosecution of the war. This consideration and the obstinate\r\nperseverance of Mexico in protracting the war must influence the terms\r\nof peace which it may be deemed proper hereafter to accept.\r\n\r\nOur arms having been everywhere victorious, having subjected to our\r\nmilitary occupation a large portion of the enemy's country, including\r\nhis capital, and negotiations for peace having failed, the important\r\nquestions arise, in what manner the war ought to be prosecuted and what\r\nshould be our future policy. I can not doubt that we should secure and\r\nrender available the conquests which we have already made, and that with\r\nthis view we should hold and occupy by our naval and military forces all\r\nthe ports, towns, cities, and Provinces now in our occupation or which\r\nmay hereafter fall into our possession; that we should press forward our\r\nmilitary operations and levy such military contributions on the enemy as\r\nmay, as far as practicable, defray the future expenses of the war.\r\n\r\nHad the Government of Mexico acceded to the equitable and liberal terms\r\nproposed, that mode of adjustment would have been preferred. Mexico\r\nhaving declined to do this and failed to offer any other terms which\r\ncould be accepted by the United States, the national honor, no less than\r\nthe public interests, requires that the war should be prosecuted with\r\nincreased energy and power until a just and satisfactory peace can be\r\nobtained. In the meantime, as Mexico refuses all indemnity, we should\r\nadopt measures to indemnify ourselves by appropriating permanently a\r\nportion of her territory. Early after the commencement of the war New\r\nMexico and the Californias were taken possession of by our forces. Our\r\nmilitary and naval commanders were ordered to conquer and hold them,\r\nsubject to be disposed of by a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThese Provinces are now in our undisputed occupation, and have been so\r\nfor many months, all resistance on the part of Mexico having ceased\r\nwithin their limits. I am satisfied that they should never be\r\nsurrendered to Mexico. Should Congress concur with me in this opinion,\r\nand that they should be retained by the United States as indemnity, I\r\ncan perceive no good reason why the civil jurisdiction and laws of the\r\nUnited States should not at once be extended over them. To wait for a\r\ntreaty of peace such as we are willing to make, by which our relations\r\ntoward them would not be changed, can not be good policy; whilst our own\r\ninterest and that of the people inhabiting them require that a stable,\r\nresponsible, and free government under our authority should as soon as\r\npossible be established over them. Should Congress, therefore, determine\r\nto hold these Provinces permanently, and that they shall hereafter be\r\nconsidered as constituent parts of our country, the early establishment\r\nof Territorial governments over them will be important for the more\r\nperfect protection of persons and property; and I recommend that such\r\nTerritorial governments be established. It will promote peace and\r\ntranquillity among the inhabitants, by allaying all apprehension that\r\nthey may still entertain of being again subjected to the jurisdiction of\r\nMexico. I invite the early and favorable consideration of Congress to\r\nthis important subject.\r\n\r\nBesides New Mexico and the Californias, there are other Mexican\r\nProvinces which have been reduced to our possession by conquest. These\r\nother Mexican Provinces are now governed by our military and naval\r\ncommanders under the general authority which is conferred upon a\r\nconqueror by the laws of war. They should continue to be held, as a\r\nmeans of coercing Mexico to accede to just terms of peace. Civil as well\r\nas military officers are required to conduct such a government. Adequate\r\ncompensation, to be drawn from contributions levied on the enemy, should\r\nbe fixed by law for such officers as may be thus employed. What further\r\nprovision may become necessary and what final disposition it may be\r\nproper to make of them must depend on the future progress of the war and\r\nthe course which Mexico may think proper hereafter to pursue.\r\n\r\nWith the views I entertain I can not favor the policy which has been\r\nsuggested, either to withdraw our Army altogether or to retire to a\r\ndesignated line and simply hold and defend it. To withdraw our Army\r\naltogether from the conquests they have made by deeds of unparalleled\r\nbravery, and at the expense of so much blood and treasure, in a just war\r\non our part, and one which, by the act of the enemy, we could not\r\nhonorably have avoided, would be to degrade the nation in its own\r\nestimation and in that of the world. To retire to a line and simply hold\r\nand defend it would not terminate the war. On the contrary, it would\r\nencourage Mexico to persevere and tend to protract it indefinitely. It\r\nis not to be expected that Mexico, after refusing to establish such a\r\nline as a permanent boundary when our victorious Army are in possession\r\nof her capital and in the heart of her country, would permit us to hold\r\nit without resistance. That she would continue the war, and in the most\r\nharassing and annoying forms, there can be no doubt. A border warfare of\r\nthe most savage character, extending over a long line, would be\r\nunceasingly waged. It would require a large army to be kept constantly\r\nin the field, stationed at posts and garrisons along such a line, to\r\nprotect and defend it. The enemy, relieved from the pressure of our arms\r\non his coasts and in the populous parts of the interior, would direct\r\nhis attention to this line, and, selecting an isolated post for attack,\r\nwould concentrate his forces upon it. This would be a condition of\r\naffairs which the Mexicans, pursuing their favorite system of guerrilla\r\nwarfare, would probably prefer to any other. Were we to assume a\r\ndefensive attitude on such a line, all the advantages of such a state of\r\nwar would be on the side of the enemy. We could levy no contributions\r\nupon him, or in any other way make him feel the pressure of the war, but\r\nmust remain inactive and await his approach, being in constant\r\nuncertainty at what point on the line or at what time he might make an\r\nassault. He may assemble and organize an overwhelming force in the\r\ninterior on his own side of the line, and, concealing his purpose, make\r\na sudden assault upon some one of our posts so distant from any other as\r\nto prevent the possibility of timely succor or reenforcements, and in\r\nthis way our gallant Army would be exposed to the danger of being cut\r\noff in detail; or if by their unequaled bravery and prowess everywhere\r\nexhibited during this war they should repulse the enemy, their numbers\r\nstationed at any one post may be too small to pursue him. If the enemy\r\nbe repulsed in one attack, he would have nothing to do but to retreat to\r\nhis own side of the line, and, being in no fear of a pursuing army, may\r\nreenforce himself at leisure for another attack on the same or some\r\nother post. He may, too, cross the line between our posts, make rapid\r\nincursions into the country which we hold, murder the inhabitants,\r\ncommit depredations on them, and then retreat to the interior before a\r\nsufficient force can be concentrated to pursue him. Such would probably\r\nbe the harassing character of a mere defensive war on our part. If our\r\nforces when attacked, or threatened with attack, be permitted to cross\r\nthe line, drive back the enemy, and conquer him, this would be again to\r\ninvade the enemy's country after having lost all the advantages of the\r\nconquests we have already made by having voluntarily abandoned them.\r\n\r\nTo hold such a line successfully and in security it is far from being\r\ncertain that it would not require as large an army as would be necessary\r\nto hold all the conquests we have already made and to continue the\r\nprosecution of the war in the heart of the enemy's country. It is also\r\nfar from being certain that the expenses of the war would be diminished\r\nby such a policy.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that the best means of vindicating the national honor and\r\ninterest and of bringing the war to an honorable close will be to\r\nprosecute it with increased energy and power in the vital parts of the\r\nenemy's country.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message to Congress of December last I declared that--\r\n\r\n  The war has not been waged with a view to conquest, but, having been\r\n  commenced by Mexico, it has been carried into the enemy's country and\r\n  will be vigorously prosecuted there with a view to obtain an honorable\r\n  peace, and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war,\r\n  as well as to our much-injured citizens, who hold large pecuniary\r\n  demands against Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch, in my judgment, continues to be our true policy; indeed, the only\r\npolicy which will probably secure a permanent peace.\r\n\r\nIt has never been contemplated by me, as an object of the war, to make a\r\npermanent conquest of the Republic of Mexico or to annihilate her\r\nseparate existence as an independent nation. On the contrary, it has\r\never been my desire that she should maintain her nationality, and under\r\na good government adapted to her condition be a free, independent, and\r\nprosperous Republic. The United States were the first among the nations\r\nto recognize her independence, and have always desired to be on terms of\r\namity and good neighborhood with her. This she would not suffer. By her\r\nown conduct we have been compelled to engage in the present war. In its\r\nprosecution we seek not her overthrow as a nation, but in vindicating\r\nour national honor we seek to obtain redress for the wrongs she has done\r\nus and indemnity for our just demands against her. We demand an\r\nhonorable peace, and that peace must bring with it indemnity for the\r\npast and security for the future. Hitherto Mexico has refused all\r\naccommodation by which such a peace could be obtained.\r\n\r\nWhilst our armies have advanced from victory to victory from the\r\ncommencement of the war, it has always been with the olive branch of\r\npeace in their hands, and it has been in the power of Mexico at every\r\nstep to arrest hostilities by accepting it.\r\n\r\nOne great obstacle to the attainment of peace has undoubtedly arisen\r\nfrom the fact that Mexico has been so long held in subjection by one\r\nfaction or military usurper after another, and such has been the\r\ncondition of insecurity in which their successive governments have been\r\nplaced that each has been deterred from making peace lest for this very\r\ncause a rival faction might expel it from power. Such was the fate of\r\nPresident Herrera's administration in 1845 for being disposed even to\r\nlisten to the overtures of the United States to prevent the war, as is\r\nfully confirmed by an official correspondence which took place in the\r\nmonth of August last between him and his Government, a copy of which is\r\nherewith communicated. \"For this cause alone the revolution which\r\ndisplaced him from power was set on foot\" by General Paredes. Such may\r\nbe the condition of insecurity of the present Government.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the peaceable and well-disposed inhabitants\r\nof Mexico are convinced that it is the true interest of their country to\r\nconclude an honorable peace with the United States, but the apprehension\r\nof becoming the victims of some military faction or usurper may have\r\nprevented them from manifesting their feelings by any public act. The\r\nremoval of any such apprehension would probably cause them to speak\r\ntheir sentiments freely and to adopt the measures necessary for the\r\nrestoration of peace. With a people distracted and divided by contending\r\nfactions and a Government subject to constant changes by successive\r\nrevolutions, the continued successes of our arms may fail to secure a\r\nsatisfactory peace. In such event it may become proper for our\r\ncommanding generals in the field to give encouragement and assurances of\r\nprotection to the friends of peace in Mexico in the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of a free republican government of their own choice, able\r\nand willing to conclude a peace which would be just to them and secure\r\nto us the indemnity we demand. This may become the only mode of\r\nobtaining such a peace. Should such be the result, the war which Mexico\r\nhas forced upon us would thus be converted into an enduring blessing to\r\nherself. After finding her torn and distracted by factions, and ruled by\r\nmilitary usurpers, we should then leave her with a republican government\r\nin the enjoyment of real independence and domestic peace and prosperity,\r\nperforming all her relative duties in the great family of nations and\r\npromoting her own happiness by wise laws and their faithful execution.\r\n\r\nIf, after affording this encouragement and protection, and after all the\r\npersevering and sincere efforts we have made from the moment Mexico\r\ncommenced the war, and prior to that time, to adjust our differences\r\nwith her, we shall ultimately fail, then we shall have exhausted all\r\nhonorable means in pursuit of peace, and must continue to occupy her\r\ncountry with our troops, taking the full measure of indemnity into our\r\nown hands, and must enforce the terms which our honor demands.\r\n\r\nTo act otherwise in the existing state of things in Mexico, and to\r\nwithdraw our Army without a peace, would not only leave all the wrongs\r\nof which we complain unredressed, but would be the signal for new and\r\nfierce civil dissensions and new revolutions--all alike hostile to\r\npeaceful relations with the United States. Besides, there is danger, if\r\nour troops were withdrawn before a peace was concluded, that the Mexican\r\npeople, wearied with successive revolutions and deprived of protection\r\nfor their persons and property, might at length be inclined to yield to\r\nforeign influences and to cast themselves into the arms of some European\r\nmonarch for protection from the anarchy and suffering which would ensue.\r\nThis, for our own safety and in pursuance of our established policy, we\r\nshould be compelled to resist. We could never consent that Mexico should\r\nbe thus converted into a monarchy governed by a foreign prince.\r\n\r\nMexico is our near neighbor, and her boundaries are coterminous with our\r\nown through the whole extent across the North American continent, from\r\nocean to ocean. Both politically and commercially we have the deepest\r\ninterest in her regeneration and prosperity. Indeed, it is impossible\r\nthat, with any just regard to our own safety, we can ever become\r\nindifferent to her fate.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the Mexican Government and people have misconstrued or\r\nmisunderstood our forbearance and our objects in desiring to conclude an\r\namicable adjustment of the existing differences between the two\r\ncountries. They may have supposed that we would submit to terms\r\ndegrading to the nation, or they may have drawn false inferences from\r\nthe supposed division of opinion in the United States on the subject of\r\nthe war, and may have calculated to gain much by protracting it, and,\r\nindeed, that we might ultimately abandon it altogether without insisting\r\non any indemnity, territorial or otherwise. Whatever may be the false\r\nimpressions under which they have acted, the adoption and prosecution of\r\nthe energetic policy proposed must soon undeceive them.\r\n\r\nIn the future prosecution of the war the enemy must be made to feel its\r\npressure more than they have heretofore done. At its commencement it was\r\ndeemed proper to conduct it in a spirit of forbearance and liberality.\r\nWith this end in view, early measures were adopted to conciliate, as far\r\nas a state of war would permit, the mass of the Mexican population; to\r\nconvince them that the war was waged, not against the peaceful\r\ninhabitants of Mexico, but against their faithless Government, which had\r\ncommenced hostilities; to remove from their minds the false impressions\r\nwhich their designing and interested rulers had artfully attempted to\r\nmake, that the war on our part was one of conquest, that it was a war\r\nagainst their religion and their churches, which were to be desecrated\r\nand overthrown, and that their rights of person and private property\r\nwould be violated. To remove these false impressions, our commanders in\r\nthe field were directed scrupulously to respect their religion, their\r\nchurches, and their church property, which were in no manner to be\r\nviolated; fhey were directed also to respect the rights of persons and\r\nproperty of all who should not take up arms against us.\r\n\r\nAssurances to this effect were given to the Mexican people by\r\nMajor-General Taylor in a proclamation issued in pursuance of\r\ninstructions from the Secretary of War in the month of June, 1846, and\r\nagain by Major-General Scott, who acted upon his own convictions of the\r\npropriety of issuing it, in a proclamation of the 11th of May, 1847. In\r\nthis spirit of liberality and conciliation, and with a view to prevent\r\nthe body of the Mexican population from taking up arms against us, was\r\nthe war conducted on our part. Provisions and other supplies furnished\r\nto our Army by Mexican citizens were paid for at fair and liberal\r\nprices, agreed upon by the parties. After the lapse of a few months it\r\nbecame apparent that these assurances and this mild treatment had failed\r\nto produce the desired effect upon the Mexican population. While the war\r\nhad been conducted on our part according to the most humane and liberal\r\nprinciples observed by civilized nations, it was waged in a far\r\ndifferent spirit on the part of Mexico. Not appreciating our\r\nforbearance, the Mexican people generally became hostile to the United\r\nStates, and availed themselves of every opportunity to commit the most\r\nsavage excesses upon our troops. Large numbers of the population took up\r\narms, and, engaging in guerrilla warfare, robbed and murdered in the\r\nmost cruel manner individual soldiers or small parties whom accident or\r\nother causes had separated from the main body of our Army; bands of\r\nguerrilleros and robbers infested the roads, harassed our trains, and\r\nwhenever it was in their power cut off our supplies.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans having thus shown themselves to be wholly incapable of\r\nappreciating our forbearance and liberality, it was deemed proper to\r\nchange the manner of conducting the war, by making them feel its\r\npressure according to the usages observed under similar circumstances by\r\nall other civilized nations.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as early as the 22d of September, 1846, instructions were\r\ngiven by the Secretary of War to Major-General Taylor to \"draw supplies\"\r\nfor our Army \"from the enemy without paying for them, and to require\r\ncontributions for its support, if in that way he was satisfied he could\r\nget abundant supplies for his forces.\" In directing the execution of\r\nthese instructions much was necessarily left to the discretion of the\r\ncommanding officer, who was best acquainted with the circumstances by\r\nwhich he was surrounded, the wants of the Army, and the practicability\r\nof enforcing the measure. General Taylor, on the 26th of October, 1846,\r\nreplied from Monterey that \"it would have been impossible hitherto, and\r\nis so now, to sustain the Army to any extent by forced contributions of\r\nmoney or supplies.\" For the reasons assigned by him, he did not adopt\r\nthe policy of his instructions, but declared his readiness to do so\r\n\"should the Army in its future operations reach a portion of the country\r\nwhich may be made to supply the troops with advantage.\" He continued to\r\npay for the articles of supply which were drawn from the enemy's\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSimilar instructions were issued to Major-General Scott on the 3d of\r\nApril, 1847, who replied from Jalapa on the 20th of May, 1847, that if\r\nit be expected \"that the Army is to support itself by forced\r\ncontributions levied upon the country we may ruin and exasperate the\r\ninhabitants and starve ourselves.\" The same discretion was given to him\r\nthat had been to General Taylor in this respect. General Scott, for the\r\nreasons assigned by him, also continued to pay for the articles of\r\nsupply for the Army which were drawn from the enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter the Army had reached the heart of the most wealthy portion of\r\nMexico it was supposed that the obstacles which had before that time\r\nprevented it would not be such as to render impracticable the levy of\r\nforced contributions for its support, and on the 1st of September and\r\nagain on the 6th of October, 1847, the order was repeated in dispatches\r\naddressed by the Secretary of War to General Scott, and his attention\r\nwas again called to the importance of making the enemy bear the burdens\r\nof the war by requiring them to furnish the means of supporting our\r\nArmy, and he was directed to adopt this policy unless by doing so there\r\nwas danger of depriving the Army of the necessary supplies. Copies of\r\nthese dispatches were forwarded to General Taylor for his government.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of March last I caused an order to be issued to our military\r\nand naval commanders to levy and collect a military contribution upon\r\nall vessels and merchandise which might enter any of the ports of Mexico\r\nin our military occupation, and to apply such contributions toward\r\ndefraying the expenses of the war. By virtue of the right of conquest\r\nand the laws of war, the conqueror, consulting his own safety or\r\nconvenience, may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all\r\nsuch ports or permit it upon such terms and conditions as he may\r\nprescribe. Before the principal ports of Mexico were blockaded by our\r\nNavy the revenue derived from import duties under the laws of Mexico was\r\npaid into the Mexican treasury. After these ports had fallen into our\r\nmilitary possession the blockade was raised and commerce with them\r\npermitted upon prescribed terms and conditions. They were opened to the\r\ntrade of all nations upon the payment of duties more moderate in their\r\namount than those which had been previously levied by Mexico, and the\r\nrevenue, which was formerly paid into the Mexican treasury, was directed\r\nto be collected by our military and naval officers and applied co the\r\nuse of our Army and Navy. Care was taken that the officers, soldiers,\r\nand sailors of our Army and Navy should be exempted from the operations\r\nof the order, and, as the merchandise imported upon which the order\r\noperated must be consumed by Mexican citizens, the contributions exacted\r\nwere in effect the seizure of the public revenues of Mexico and the\r\napplication of them to our own use. In directing this measure the object\r\nwas to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the\r\nexpenses of the war.\r\n\r\nFor the amount of contributions which have been levied in this form I\r\nrefer you to the accompanying reports of the Secretary of War and of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, by which it appears that a sum exceeding half a\r\nmillion of dollars has been collected. This amount would undoubtedly\r\nhave been much larger but for the difficulty of keeping open\r\ncommunications between the coast and the interior, so as to enable the\r\nowners of the merchandise imported to transport and vend it to the\r\ninhabitants of the country. It is confidently expected that this\r\ndifficulty will to a great extent be soon removed by our increased\r\nforces which have been sent to the field.\r\n\r\nMeasures have recently been adopted by which the internal as well as the\r\nexternal revenues of Mexico in all places in our military occupation\r\nwill be seized and appropriated to the use of our Army and Navy.\r\n\r\nThe policy of levying upon the enemy contributions in every form\r\nconsistently with the laws of nations, which it may be practicable for\r\nour military commanders to adopt, should, in my judgment, be rigidly\r\nenforced, and orders to this effect have accordingly been given. By such\r\na policy, at the same time that our own Treasury will be relieved from a\r\nheavy drain, the Mexican people will be made to feel the burdens of the\r\nwar, and, consulting their own interests, may be induced the more\r\nreadily to require their rulers to accede to a just peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the last session of Congress events transpired\r\nin the prosecution of the war which in my judgment required a greater\r\nnumber of troops in the field than had been anticipated. The strength of\r\nthe Army was accordingly increased by \"accepting\" the services of all\r\nthe volunteer forces authorized by the act of the 13th of May, 1846,\r\nwithout putting a construction on that act the correctness of which was\r\nseriously questioned. The volunteer forces now in the field, with those\r\nwhich had been \"accepted\" to \"serve for twelve months\" and were\r\ndischarged at the end of their term of service, exhaust the 50,000 men\r\nauthorized by that act. Had it been clear that a proper construction of\r\nthe act warranted it, the services of an additional number would have\r\nbeen called for and accepted; but doubts existing upon this point, the\r\npower was not exercised. It is deemed important that Congress should at\r\nan early period of their session confer the authority to raise an\r\nadditional regular force to serve during the war with Mexico and to be\r\ndischarged upon the conclusion and ratification of a treaty of peace. I\r\ninvite the attention of Congress to the views presented by the Secretary\r\nof War in his report upon this subject.\r\n\r\nI recommend also that authority be given by law to call for and accept\r\nthe services of an additional number of volunteers, to be exercised at\r\nsuch time and to such extent as the emergencies of the service may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nIn prosecuting the war with Mexico, whilst the utmost care has been\r\ntaken to avoid every just cause of complaint on the part of neutral\r\nnations, and none has been given, liberal privileges have been granted\r\nto their commerce in the ports of the enemy in our military occupation.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with the Brazilian Government, which at one time\r\nthreatened to interrupt the friendly relations between the two\r\ncountries, will, I trust, be speedily adjusted. I have received\r\ninformation that an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to\r\nthe United States will shortly be appointed by His Imperial Majesty, and\r\nit is hoped that he will come instructed and prepared to adjust all\r\nremaining differences between the two Governments in a manner acceptable\r\nand honorable to both. In the meantime, I have every reason to believe\r\nthat nothing will occur to interrupt our amicable relations with Brazil.\r\n\r\nIt has been my constant effort to maintain and cultivate the most\r\nintimate relations of friendship with all the independent powers of\r\nSouth America, and this policy has been attended with the happiest\r\nresults. It is true that the settlement and payment of many just claims\r\nof American citizens against these nations have been long delayed. The\r\npeculiar position in which they have been placed and the desire on the\r\npart of my predecessors as well as myself to grant them the utmost\r\nindulgence have hitherto prevented these claims from being urged in a\r\nmanner demanded by strict justice. The time has arrived when they ought\r\nto be finally adjusted and liquidated, and efforts are now making for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to inform you that the Government of Peru has in good faith\r\npaid the first two installments of the indemnity of $30,000 each, and\r\nthe greater portion of the interest due thereon, in execution of the\r\nconvention between that Government and the United States the\r\nratifications of which were exchanged at Lima on the 31st of October,\r\n1846. The Attorney-General of the United States early in August last\r\ncompleted the adjudication of the claims under this convention, and made\r\nhis report thereon in pursuance of the act of the 8th of August, 1846.\r\nThe sums to which the claimants are respectively entitled will be paid\r\non demand at the Treasury.\r\n\r\nI invite the early attention of Congress to the present condition of our\r\ncitizens in China. Under our treaty with that power American citizens\r\nare withdrawn from the jurisdiction, whether civil or criminal, of the\r\nChinese Government and placed under that of our public functionaries in\r\nthat country. By these alone can our citizens be tried and punished for\r\nthe commission of any crime; by these alone can questions be decided\r\nbetween them involving the rights of persons and property, and by these\r\nalone can contracts be enforced into which they may have entered with\r\nthe citizens or subjects of foreign powers. The merchant vessels of the\r\nUnited States lying in the waters of the five ports of China open to\r\nforeign commerce are under the exclusive jurisdiction of officers of\r\ntheir own Government. Until Congress shall establish competent tribunals\r\nto try and punish crimes and to exercise jurisdiction in civil cases in\r\nChina, American citizens there are subject to no law whatever. Crimes\r\nmay be committed with impunity and debts may be contracted without any\r\nmeans to enforce their payment. Inconveniences have already resulted\r\nfrom the omission of Congress to legislate upon the subject, and still\r\ngreater are apprehended. The British authorities in China have already\r\ncomplained that this Government has not provided for the punishment of\r\ncrimes or the enforcement of contracts against American citizens in that\r\ncountry, whilst their Government has established tribunals by which an\r\nAmerican citizen can recover debts due from British subjects.\r\n\r\nAccustomed, as the Chinese are, to summary justice, they could not be\r\nmade to comprehend why criminals who are citizens of the United States\r\nshould escape with impunity, in violation of treaty obligations, whilst\r\nthe punishment of a Chinese who had committed any crime against an\r\nAmerican citizen would be rigorously exacted. Indeed, the consequences\r\nmight be fatal to American citizens in China should a flagrant crime be\r\ncommitted by any one of them upon a Chinese, and should trial and\r\npunishment not follow according to the requisitions of the treaty. This\r\nmight disturb, if not destroy, our friendly relations with that Empire\r\nand cause an interruption of our valuable commerce.\r\n\r\nOur treaties with the Sublime Porte, Tripoli, Tunis, Morocco, and Muscat\r\nalso require the legislation of Congress to carry them into execution,\r\nthough the necessity for immediate action may not be so urgent as in\r\nregard to China.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has submitted an estimate to defray the expense\r\nof opening diplomatic relations with the Papal States. The interesting\r\npolitical events now in progress in these States, as well as a just\r\nregard to our commercial interests, have, in my opinion, rendered such a\r\nmeasure highly expedient.\r\n\r\nEstimates have also been submitted for the outfits and salaries of\r\nchargés d'affaires to the Republics of Bolivia, Guatemala, and Ecuador.\r\nThe manifest importance of cultivating the most friendly relations with\r\nall the independent States upon this continent has induced me to\r\nrecommend appropriations necessary for the maintenance of these\r\nmissions.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress that an appropriation be made to be paid to the\r\nSpanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the claimants\r\nin the _Amistad_ case. I entertain the conviction that this is due to\r\nSpain under the treaty of the 20th of October, 1795, and, moreover, that\r\nfrom the earnest manner in which the claim continues to be urged so long\r\nas it shall remain unsettled it will be a source of irritation and\r\ndiscord between the two countries, which may prove highly prejudicial to\r\nthe interests of the United States. Good policy, no less than a faithful\r\ncompliance with our treaty obligations, requires that the inconsiderable\r\nappropriation demanded should be made.\r\n\r\nA detailed statement of the condition of the finances will be presented\r\nin the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The imports for\r\nthe last fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1847, were of the\r\nvalue of $146,545,638, of which the amount exported was $8,011,158,\r\nleaving $138,534,480 in the country for domestic use. The value of the\r\nexports for the same period was $158,648,622, of which $150,637,464\r\nconsisted of domestic productions and $8,011,158 of foreign articles.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the same period amounted to\r\n$26,346,790.37, of which there was derived from customs $23,747,864.66,\r\nfrom sales of public lands $2,498,335.20, and from incidental and\r\nmiscellaneous sources $100,570.51. The last fiscal year, during which\r\nthis amount was received, embraced five months under the operation of\r\nthe tariff act of 1842 and seven months during which the tariff act of\r\n1846 was in force. During the five months under the act of 1842 the\r\namount received from customs was $7,842,306.90, and during the seven\r\nmonths under the act of 1846 the amount received was $15,905,557.76.\r\n\r\nThe net revenue from customs during the year ending on the 1st of\r\nDecember, 1846, being the last year under the operation of the tariff\r\nact of 1842, was $22,971,403.10, and the net revenue from customs during\r\nthe year ending on the 1st of December, 1847, being the first year under\r\nthe operations of the tariff act of 1846, was about $31,500,000, being\r\nan increase of revenue for the first year under the tariff of 1846 of\r\nmore than $8,500,000 over that of the last year under the tariff of\r\n1842.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last\r\nwere $59,451,177.65, of which $3,522,082.37 was on account of payment of\r\nprincipal and interest of the public debt, including Treasury notes\r\nredeemed and not funded. The expenditures exclusive of payment of public\r\ndebt were $55,929,095.28.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1848, including the balance in the Treasury\r\non the 1st of July last, will amount to $42,886,545.80, of which\r\n$31,000,000, it is estimated, will be derived from customs, $3,500,000\r\nfrom the sale of the public lands, $400,000 from incidental sources,\r\nincluding sales made by the Solicitor of the Treasury, and $6,285,294.55\r\nfrom loans already authorized by law, which, together with the balance\r\nin the Treasury on the 1st of July last, make the sum estimated.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period, if peace with Mexico shall not be\r\nconcluded and the Army shall be increased as is proposed, will amount,\r\nincluding the necessary payments on account of principal and interest of\r\nthe public debt and Treasury notes, to $58,615,660.07.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of the present month the amount of the public debt actually\r\nincurred, including Treasury notes, was $45,659,659.40. The public debt\r\ndue on the 4th of March, 1845, including Treasury notes, was\r\n$17,788,799.62, and consequently the addition made to the public debt\r\nsince that time is $27,870,859.78.\r\n\r\nOf the loan of twenty-three millions authorized by the act of the 28th\r\nof January, 1847, the sum of five millions was paid out to the public\r\ncreditors or exchanged at par for specie; the remaining eighteen\r\nmillions was offered for specie to the highest bidder not below par, by\r\nan advertisement issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and published\r\nfrom the 9th of February until the 10th of April, 1847, when it was\r\nawarded to the several highest bidders at premiums varying from\r\none-eighth of 1 per cent to 2 per cent above par. The premium has been\r\npaid into the Treasury and the sums awarded deposited in specie in the\r\nTreasury as fast as it was required by the wants of the Government.\r\n\r\nTo meet the expenditures for the remainder of the present and for the\r\nnext fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1849, a further loan in\r\naid of the ordinary revenues of the Government will be necessary.\r\nRetaining a sufficient surplus in the Treasury, the loan required for\r\nthe remainder of the present fiscal year will be about $18,500,000. If\r\nthe duty on tea and coffee be imposed and the graduation of the price of\r\nthe public lands shall be made at an early period of your session, as\r\nrecommended, the loan for the present fiscal year may be reduced to\r\n$17,000,000. The loan may be further reduced by whatever amount of\r\nexpenditures can be saved by military contributions collected in Mexico.\r\nThe most vigorous measures for the augmentation of these contributions\r\nhave been directed and a very considerable sum is expected from that\r\nsource. Its amount can not, however, be calculated with any certainty.\r\nIt is recommended that the loan to be made be authorized upon the same\r\nterms and for the same time as that which was authorized under the\r\nprovisions of the act of the 28th of January, 1847.\r\n\r\nShould the war with Mexico be continued until the 30th of June, 1849, it\r\nis estimated that a further loan of $20,500,000 will be required for the\r\nfiscal year ending on that day, in case no duty be imposed on tea and\r\ncoffee, and the public lands be not reduced and graduated in price, and\r\nno military contributions shall be collected in Mexico. If the duty on\r\ntea and coffee be imposed and the lands be reduced and graduated in\r\nprice as proposed, the loan may be reduced to $17,000,000, and will be\r\nsubject to be still further reduced by the amount of the military\r\ncontributions which may be collected in Mexico. It is not proposed,\r\nhowever, at present to ask Congress for authority to negotiate this loan\r\nfor the next fiscal year, as it is hoped that the loan asked for the\r\nremainder of the present fiscal year, aided by military contributions\r\nwhich may be collected in Mexico, may be sufficient. If, contrary to\r\nmy expectation, there should be a necessity for it, the fact will be\r\ncommunicated to Congress in time for their action during the present\r\nsession. In no event will a sum exceeding $6,000,000 of this amount be\r\nneeded before the meeting of the session of Congress in December, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe act of the 30th of July, 1846, \"reducing the duties on imports,\" has\r\nbeen in force since the 1st of December last, and I am gratified to\r\nstate that all the beneficial effects which were anticipated from its\r\noperation have been fully realized. The public revenue derived from\r\ncustoms during the year ending on the 1st of December, 1847, exceeds by\r\nmore than $8,000,000 the amount received in the preceding year under the\r\noperation of the act of 1842, which was superseded and repealed by it.\r\nIts effects are visible in the great and almost unexampled prosperity\r\nwhich prevails in every branch of business.\r\n\r\nWhile the repeal of the prohibitory and restrictive duties of the act of\r\n1842 and the substitution in their place of reasonable revenue rates\r\nlevied on articles imported according to their actual value has\r\nincreased the revenue and augmented our foreign trade, all the great\r\ninterests of the country have been advanced and promoted.\r\n\r\nThe great and important interests of agriculture, which had been not\r\nonly too much neglected, but actually taxed under the protective policy\r\nfor the benefit of other interests, have been relieved of the burdens\r\nwhich that policy imposed on them; and our farmers and planters, under a\r\nmore just and liberal commercial policy, are finding new and profitable\r\nmarkets abroad for their augmented products. Our commerce is rapidly\r\nincreasing, and is extending more widely the circle of international\r\nexchanges. Great as has been the increase of our imports during the past\r\nyear, our exports of domestic products sold in foreign markets have been\r\nstill greater.\r\n\r\nOur navigating interest is eminently prosperous. The number of vessels\r\nbuilt in the United States has been greater than during any preceding\r\nperiod of equal length. Large profits have been derived by those who\r\nhave constructed as well as by those who have navigated them. Should the\r\nratio of increase in the number of our merchant vessels be progressive,\r\nand be as great for the future as during the past year, the time is not\r\ndistant when our tonnage and commercial marine will be larger than that\r\nof any other nation in the world.\r\n\r\nWhilst the interests of agriculture, of commerce, and of navigation have\r\nbeen enlarged and invigorated, it is highly gratifying to observe that\r\nour manufactures are also in a prosperous condition. None of the ruinous\r\neffects upon this interest which were apprehended by some as the result\r\nof the operation of the revenue system established by the act of 1846\r\nhave been experienced. On the contrary, the number of manufactories and\r\nthe amount of capital invested in them is steadily and rapidly\r\nincreasing, affording gratifying proofs that American enterprise and\r\nskill employed in this branch of domestic industry, with no other\r\nadvantages than those fairly and incidentally accruing from a just\r\nsystem of revenue duties, are abundantly able to meet successfully all\r\ncompetition from abroad and still derive fair and remunerating profits.\r\nWhile capital invested in manufactures is yielding adequate and fair\r\nprofits under the new system, the wages of labor, whether employed in\r\nmanufactures, agriculture, commerce, or navigation, have been augmented.\r\nThe toiling millions whose daily labor furnishes the supply of food and\r\nraiment and all the necessaries and comforts of life are receiving\r\nhigher wages and more steady and permanent employment than in any other\r\ncountry or at any previous period of our own history.\r\n\r\nSo successful have been all branches of our industry that a foreign war,\r\nwhich generally diminishes the resources of a nation, has in no\r\nessential degree retarded our onward progress or checked our general\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nWith such gratifying evidences of prosperity and of the successful\r\noperation of the revenue act of 1846, every consideration of public\r\npolicy recommends that it shall remain unchanged. It is hoped that the\r\nsystem of impost duties which it established may be regarded as the\r\npermanent policy of the country, and that the great interests affected\r\nby it may not again be subject to be injuriously disturbed, as they have\r\nheretofore been, by frequent and sometimes sudden changes.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of increasing the revenue, and without changing or\r\nmodifying the rates imposed by the act of 1846 on the dutiable articles\r\nembraced by its provisions, I again recommend to your favorable\r\nconsideration the expediency of levying a revenue duty on tea and\r\ncoffee. The policy which exempted these articles from duty during peace,\r\nand when the revenue to be derived from them was not needed, ceases to\r\nexist when the country is engaged in war and requires the use of all\r\nof its available resources. It is a tax which would be so generally\r\ndiffused among the people that it would be felt oppressively by none and\r\nbe complained of by none. It is believed that there are not in the list\r\nof imported articles any which are more properly the subject of war\r\nduties than tea and coffee.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that $3,000,000 would be derived annually by a moderate\r\nduty imposed on these articles.\r\n\r\nShould Congress avail itself of this additional source of revenue, not\r\nonly would the amount of the public loan rendered necessary by the war\r\nwith Mexico be diminished to that extent, but the public credit and the\r\npublic confidence in the ability and determination of the Government to\r\nmeet all its engagements promptly would be more firmly established, and\r\nthe reduced amount of the loan which it may be necessary to negotiate\r\ncould probably be obtained at cheaper rates.\r\n\r\nCongress is therefore called upon to determine whether it is wiser to\r\nimpose the war duties recommended or by omitting to do so increase the\r\npublic debt annually $3,000,000 so long as loans shall be required to\r\nprosecute the war, and afterwards provide in some other form to pay the\r\nsemiannual interest upon it, and ultimately to extinguish the principal.\r\nIf in addition to these duties Congress should graduate and reduce the\r\nprice of such of the public lands as experience has proved will not\r\ncommand the price placed upon them by the Government, an additional\r\nannual income to the Treasury of between half a million and a million of\r\ndollars, it is estimated, would be derived from this source. Should both\r\nmeasures receive the sanction of Congress, the annual amount of public\r\ndebt necessary to be contracted during the continuance of the war would\r\nbe reduced near $4,000,000. The duties recommended to be levied on tea\r\nand coffee it is proposed shall be limited in their duration to the end\r\nof the war, and until the public debt rendered necessary to be\r\ncontracted by it shall be discharged. The amount of the public debt to\r\nbe contracted should be limited to the lowest practicable sum, and\r\nshould be extinguished as early after the conclusion of the war as the\r\nmeans of the Treasury will permit.\r\n\r\nWith this view, it is recommended that as soon as the war shall be over\r\nall the surplus in the Treasury not needed for other indispensable\r\nobjects shall constitute a sinking fund and be applied to the purchase\r\nof the funded debt, and that authority be conferred by laws for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe act of the 6th of August, 1846, \"to establish a warehousing system,\"\r\nhas been in operation more than a year, and has proved to be an\r\nimportant auxiliary to the tariff act of 1846 in augmenting the revenue\r\nand extending the commerce of the country. Whilst it has tended to\r\nenlarge commerce, it has been beneficial to our manufactures by\r\ndiminishing forced sales at auction of foreign goods at low prices to\r\nraise the duties to be advanced on them, and by checking fluctuations in\r\nthe market. The system, although sanctioned by the experience of other\r\ncountries, was entirely new in the United States, and is susceptible of\r\nimprovement in some of its provisions. The Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nupon whom was devolved large discretionary powers in carrying this\r\nmeasure into effect, has collected and is now collating the practical\r\nresults of the system in other countries where it has long been\r\nestablished, and will report at an early period of your session such\r\nfurther regulations suggested by the investigation as may render it\r\nstill more effective and beneficial.\r\n\r\nBy the act to \"provide for the better organization of the Treasury and\r\nfor the collection, safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public\r\nrevenue\" all banks were discontinued as fiscal agents of the Government,\r\nand the paper currency issued by them was no longer permitted to be\r\nreceived in payment of public dues. The constitutional treasury created\r\nby this act went into operation on the 1st of January last. Under the\r\nsystem established by it the public moneys have been collected, safely\r\nkept, and disbursed by the direct agency of officers of the Government\r\nin gold and silver, and transfers of large amounts have been made from\r\npoints of collection to points of disbursement without loss to the\r\nTreasury or injury or inconvenience to the trade of the country.\r\n\r\nWhile the fiscal operations of the Government have been conducted with\r\nregularity and ease under this system, it has had a salutary effect in\r\nchecking and preventing an undue inflation of the paper currency issued\r\nby the banks which exist under State charters. Requiring, as it does,\r\nall dues to the Government to be paid in gold and silver, its effect is\r\nto restrain excessive issues of bank paper by the banks disproportioned\r\nto the specie in their vaults, for the reason that they are at all times\r\nliable to be called on by the holders of their notes for their\r\nredemption in order to obtain specie for the payment of duties and other\r\npublic dues. The banks, therefore, must keep their business within\r\nprudent limits, and be always in a condition to meet such calls, or run\r\nthe hazard of being compelled to suspend specie payments and be thereby\r\ndiscredited. The amount of specie imported into the United States during\r\nthe last fiscal year was $24,121,289, of which there was retained in the\r\ncountry $22,276,170. Had the former financial system prevailed and the\r\npublic moneys been placed on deposit in the banks, nearly the whole of\r\nthis amount would have gone into their vaults, not to be thrown into\r\ncirculation by them, but to be withheld from the hands of the people as\r\na currency and made the basis of new and enormous issues of bank paper.\r\nA large proportion of the specie imported has been paid into the\r\nTreasury for public dues, and after having been to a great extent\r\nrecoined at the Mint has been paid out to the public creditors and gone\r\ninto circulation as a currency among the people. The amount of gold and\r\nsilver coin now in circulation in the country is larger than at any\r\nformer period.\r\n\r\nThe financial system established by the constitutional treasury has been\r\nthus far eminently successful in its operations, and I recommend an\r\nadherence to all its essential provisions, and especially to that vital\r\nprovision which wholly separates the Government from all connection with\r\nbanks and excludes bank paper from all revenue receipts.\r\n\r\nIn some of its details, not involving its general principles, the system\r\nis defective and will require modification. These defects and such\r\namendments as are deemed important were set forth in the last annual\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury. These amendments are again\r\nrecommended to the early and favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the coinage at the Mint and its branches has\r\nexceeded $20,000,000. This has consisted chiefly in converting the coins\r\nof foreign countries into American coin.\r\n\r\nThe largest amount of foreign coin imported has been received at New\r\nYork, and if a branch mint were established at that city all the foreign\r\ncoin received at that port could at once be converted into our own coin\r\nwithout the expense, risk, and delay of transporting it to the Mint for\r\nthat purpose, and the amount recoined would be much larger.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that foreign coin, and especially foreign gold\r\ncoin, will not circulate extensively as a currency among the people. The\r\nimportant measure of extending our specie circulation, both of gold and\r\nsilver, and of diffusing it among the people can only be effected by\r\nconverting such foreign coin into American coin. I repeat the\r\nrecommendation contained in my last annual message for the establishment\r\nof a branch of the Mint of the United States at the city of New York.\r\n\r\nAll the public lands which had been surveyed and were ready for market\r\nhave been proclaimed for sale during the past year. The quantity offered\r\nand to be offered for sale under proclamations issued since the 1st of\r\nJanuary last amounts to 9,138,531 acres. The prosperity of the Western\r\nStates and Territories in which these lands lie will be advanced by\r\ntheir speedy sale. By withholding them from market their growth and\r\nincrease of population would be retarded, while thousands of our\r\nenterprising and meritorious frontier population would be deprived of\r\nthe opportunity of securing freeholds for themselves and their families.\r\nBut in addition to the general considerations which rendered the early\r\nsale of these lands proper, it was a leading object at this time to\r\nderive as large a sum as possible from this source, and thus diminish by\r\nthat amount the public loan rendered necessary by the existence of a\r\nforeign war.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that not less than 10,000,000 acres of the public lands\r\nwill be surveyed and be in a condition to be proclaimed for sale during\r\nthe year 1848.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I presented the reasons which in my judgment\r\nrendered it proper to graduate and reduce the price of such of the\r\npublic lands as have remained unsold for long periods after they had\r\nbeen offered for sale at public auction.\r\n\r\nMany millions of acres of public lands lying within the limits of\r\nseveral of the Western States have been offered in the market and been\r\nsubject to sale at private entry for more than twenty years and large\r\nquantities for more than thirty years at the lowest price prescribed by\r\nthe existing laws, and it has been found that they will not command that\r\nprice. They must remain unsold and uncultivated for an indefinite period\r\nunless the price demanded for them by the Government shall be reduced.\r\nNo satisfactory reason is perceived why they should be longer held at\r\nrates above their real value. At the present period an additional reason\r\nexists for adopting the measure recommended. When the country is engaged\r\nin a foreign war, and we must necessarily resort to loans, it would seem\r\nto be the dictate of wisdom that we should avail ourselves of all our\r\nresources and thus limit the amount of the public indebtedness to the\r\nlowest possible sum.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the existing laws on the subject of preemption rights\r\nbe amended and modified so as to operate prospectively and to embrace\r\nall who may settle upon the public lands and make improvements upon\r\nthem, before they are surveyed as well as afterwards, in all cases where\r\nsuch settlements may be made after the Indian title shall have been\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIf the right of preemption be thus extended, it will embrace a large and\r\nmeritorious class of our citizens. It will increase the number of small\r\nfreeholders upon our borders, who will be enabled thereby to educate\r\ntheir children and otherwise improve their condition, while they will be\r\nfound at all times, as they have ever proved themselves to be in the\r\nhour of danger to their country, among our hardiest and best volunteer\r\nsoldiers, ever ready to attend to their services in cases of emergencies\r\nand among the last to leave the field as long as an enemy remains to be\r\nencountered. Such a policy will also impress these patriotic pioneer\r\nemigrants with deeper feelings of gratitude for the parental care of\r\ntheir Government, when they find their dearest interests secured to them\r\nby the permanent laws of the land and that they are no longer in danger\r\nof losing their homes and hard-earned improvements by being brought into\r\ncompetition with a more wealthy class of purchasers at the land sales.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress was invited at their last and the preceding\r\nsession to the importance of establishing a Territorial government over\r\nour possessions in Oregon, and it is to be regretted that there was no\r\nlegislation on the subject. Our citizens who inhabit that distant region\r\nof country are still left without the protection of our laws, or any\r\nregularly organized government. Before the question of limits and\r\nboundaries of the Territory of Oregon was definitely settled, from the\r\nnecessity of their condition the inhabitants had established a temporary\r\ngovernment of their own. Besides the want of legal authority for\r\ncontinuing such a government, it is wholly inadequate to protect them in\r\ntheir rights of person and property, or to secure to them the enjoyment\r\nof the privileges of other citizens, to which they are entitled under\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. They should have the right of\r\nsuffrage, be represented in a Territorial legislature and by a Delegate\r\nin Congress, and possess all the rights and privileges which citizens of\r\nother portions of the territories of the United States have heretofore\r\nenjoyed or may now enjoy.\r\n\r\nOur judicial system, revenue laws, laws regulating trade and intercourse\r\nwith the Indian tribes, and the protection of our laws generally should\r\nbe extended over them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the inhabitants in that Territory who had previously\r\nemigrated to it, large numbers of our citizens have followed them during\r\nthe present year, and it is not doubted that during the next and\r\nsubsequent years their numbers will be greatly increased.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session established post routes leading to Oregon,\r\nand between different points within that Territory, and authorized the\r\nestablishment of post-offices at \"Astoria and such other places on the\r\ncoasts of the Pacific within the territory of the United States as the\r\npublic interests may require.\" Post-offices have accordingly been\r\nestablished, deputy postmasters appointed, and provision made for the\r\ntransportation of the mails.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of peace with the Indian tribes residing west of the\r\nRocky Mountains will render it proper that authority should be given by\r\nlaw for the appointment of an adequate number of Indian agents to reside\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nI recommend that a surveyor-general's office be established in that\r\nTerritory, and that the public lands be surveyed and brought into market\r\nat an early period.\r\n\r\nI recommend also that grants, upon liberal terms, of limited quantities\r\nof the public lands be made to all citizens of the United States who\r\nhave emigrated, or may hereafter within a prescribed period emigrate, to\r\nOregon and settle upon them. These hardy and adventurous citizens, who\r\nhave encountered the dangers and privations of a long and toilsome\r\njourney, and have at length found an abiding place for themselves and\r\ntheir families upon the utmost verge of our western limits, should be\r\nsecured in the homes which they have improved by their labor.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War for a\r\ndetailed account of the operations of the various branches of the public\r\nservice connected with the Department under his charge. The duties\r\ndevolving on this Department have been unusually onerous and responsible\r\nduring the past year, and have been discharged with ability and success.\r\n\r\nPacific relations continue to exist with the various Indian tribes, and\r\nmost of them manifest a strong friendship for the United States. Some\r\ndepredations were committed during the past year upon our trains\r\ntransporting supplies for the Army, on the road between the western\r\nborder of Missouri and Santa Fe. These depredations, which are supposed\r\nto have been committed by bands from the region of New Mexico, have been\r\narrested by the presence of a military force ordered out for that\r\npurpose. Some outrages have been perpetrated by a portion of the\r\nnorthwestern bands upon the weaker and comparatively defenseless\r\nneighboring tribes. Prompt measures were taken to prevent such\r\noccurrences in future.\r\n\r\nBetween 1,000 and 2,000 Indians, belonging to several tribes, have been\r\nremoved during the year from the east of the Mississippi to the country\r\nallotted to them west of that river as their permanent home, and\r\narrangements have been made for others to follow.\r\n\r\nSince the treaty of 1846 with the Cherokees the feuds among them appear\r\nto have subsided, and they have become more united and contented than\r\nthey have been for many years past. The commissioners appointed in\r\npursuance of the act of June 27, 1846, to settle claims arising under\r\nthe treaty of 1835-36 with that tribe have executed their duties, and\r\nafter a patient investigation and a full and fair examination of all the\r\ncases brought before them closed their labors in the month of July last.\r\nThis is the fourth board of commissioners which has been organized under\r\nthis treaty. Ample opportunity has been afforded to all those interested\r\nto bring forward their claims. No doubt is entertained that impartial\r\njustice has been done by the late board, and that all valid claims\r\nembraced by the treaty have been considered and allowed. This result and\r\nthe final settlement to be made with this tribe under the treaty of\r\n1846, which will be completed and laid before you during your session,\r\nwill adjust all questions of controversy between them and the United\r\nStates and produce a state of relations with them simple, well defined,\r\nand satisfactory.\r\n\r\nUnder the discretionary authority conferred by the act of the 3d of\r\nMarch last the annuities due to the various tribes have been paid during\r\nthe present year to the heads of families instead of to their chiefs or\r\nsuch persons as they might designate, as required by the law previously\r\nexisting. This mode of payment has given general satisfaction to the\r\ngreat body of the Indians. Justice has been done to them, and they are\r\ngrateful to the Government for it. A few chiefs and interested persons\r\nmay object to this mode of payment, but it is believed to be the only\r\nmode of preventing fraud and imposition from being practiced upon the\r\ngreat body of common Indians, constituting a majority of all the tribes.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to perceive that a number of the tribes have recently\r\nmanifested an increased interest in the establishment of schools among\r\nthem, and are making rapid advances in agriculture, some of them\r\nproducing a sufficient quantity of food for their support and in some\r\ncases a surplus to dispose of to their neighbors. The comforts by which\r\nthose who have received even a very limited education and have engaged\r\nin agriculture are surrounded tend gradually to draw off their less\r\ncivilized brethren from the precarious means of subsistence by the chase\r\nto habits of labor and civilization.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a\r\nsatisfactory and gratifying account of the condition and operations of\r\nthe naval service during the past year. Our commerce has been pursued\r\nwith increased activity and with safety and success in every quarter of\r\nthe globe under the protection of our flag, which the Navy has caused to\r\nbe respected in the most distant seas.\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific the officers and men of our\r\nsquadrons have displayed distinguished gallantry and performed valuable\r\nservices. In the early stages of the war with Mexico her ports on both\r\ncoasts were blockaded, and more recently many of them have been captured\r\nand held by the Navy. When acting in cooperation with the land forces,\r\nthe naval officers and men have performed gallant and distinguished\r\nservices on land as well as on water, and deserve the high commendation\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nWhile other maritime powers are adding to their navies large numbers of\r\nwar steamers, it was a wise policy on our part to make similar additions\r\nto our Navy. The four war steamers authorized by the act of the 3d of\r\nMarch, 1847, are in course of construction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the four war steamers authorized by this act, the\r\nSecretary of the Navy has, in pursuance of its provisions, entered into\r\ncontracts for the construction of five steamers to be employed in the\r\ntransportation of the United States mail \"from New York to New Orleans,\r\ntouching at Charleston, Savannah, and Havana, and from Havana to\r\nChagres;\" for three steamers to be employed in like manner from Panama\r\nto Oregon, \"so as to connect with the mail from Havana to Chagres across\r\nthe Isthmus;\" and for five steamers to be employed in like manner from\r\nNew York to Liverpool. These steamers will be the property of the\r\ncontractors, but are to be built \"under the superintendence and\r\ndirection of a naval constructor in the employ of the Navy Department,\r\nand to be so constructed as to render them convertible at the least\r\npossible expense into war steamers of the first class.\" A prescribed\r\nnumber of naval officers, as well as a post-office agent, are to be on\r\nboard of them, and authority is reserved to the Navy Department at all\r\ntimes to \"exercise control over said steamships\" and \"to have the right\r\nto take them for the exclusive use and service of the United States upon\r\nmaking proper compensation to the contractors therefor.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst these steamships will be employed in transporting the mails of\r\nthe United States coastwise and to foreign countries upon an annual\r\ncompensation to be paid to the owners, they will be always ready, upon\r\nan emergency requiring it, to be converted into war steamers; and the\r\nright reserved to take them for public use will add greatly to the\r\nefficiency and strength of this description of our naval force. To the\r\nsteamers authorized under contracts made by the Secretary of the Navy\r\nshould be added five other steamers authorized under contracts made in\r\npursuance of laws by the Postmaster-General, making an addition, in the\r\nwhole, of eighteen war steamers subject to be taken for public use. As\r\nfurther contracts for the transportation of the mail to foreign\r\ncountries may be authorized by Congress, this number may be enlarged\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened policy by which a rapid communication with the various\r\ndistant parts of the globe is established, by means of American-built\r\nsea steamers, would find an ample reward in the increase of our commerce\r\nand in making our country and its resources more favorably known abroad;\r\nbut the national advantage is still greater--of having our naval\r\nofficers made familiar with steam navigation and of having the privilege\r\nof taking the ships already equipped for immediate service at a moment's\r\nnotice, and will be cheaply purchased by the compensation to be paid for\r\nthe transportation of the mail in them over and above the postages\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nA just national pride, no less than our commercial interests, would Seem\r\nto favor the policy of augmenting the number of this description of\r\nvessels. They can be built in our country cheaper and in greater numbers\r\nthan in any other in the world.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General for a\r\ndetailed and satisfactory account of the condition and operations of\r\nthat Department during the past year. It is gratifying to find that\r\nwithin so short a period after the reduction in the rates of postage,\r\nand notwithstanding the great increase of mail service, the revenue\r\nreceived for the year will be sufficient to defray all the expenses, and\r\nthat no further aid will be required from the Treasury for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first of the American mail steamers authorized by the act of the 3d\r\nof March, 1845, was completed and entered upon the service on the 1st of\r\nJune last, and is now on her third voyage to Bremen and other\r\nintermediate ports. The other vessels authorized under the provisions of\r\nthat act are in course of construction, and will be put upon the line as\r\nsoon as completed. Contracts have also been made for the transportation\r\nof the mail in a steamer from Charleston to Havana.\r\n\r\nA reciprocal and satisfactory postal arrangement has been made by the\r\nPostmaster-General with the authorities of Bremen, and no difficulty is\r\napprehended in making similar arrangements with all other powers with\r\nwhich we may have communications by mail steamers, except with Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the first of the American steamers bound to Bremen at\r\nSouthampton, in the month of June last, the British post-office directed\r\nthe collection of discriminating postages on all letters and other\r\nmailable matter which she took out to Great Britain or which went into\r\nthe British post-office on their way to France and other parts of\r\nEurope. The effect of the order of the British post-office is to subject\r\nall letters and other matter transported by American steamers to double\r\npostage, one postage having been previously paid on them to the United\r\nStates, while letters transported in British steamers are subject to pay\r\nbut a single postage. This measure was adopted with the avowed object of\r\nprotecting the British line of mail steamers now running between Boston\r\nand Liverpool, and if permitted to continue must speedily put an end to\r\nthe transportation of all letters and other matter by American steamers\r\nand give to British steamers a monopoly of the business. A just and fair\r\nreciprocity is all that we desire, and on this we must insist. By our\r\nlaws no such discrimination is made against British steamers bringing\r\nletters into our ports, but all letters arriving in the United States\r\nare subject to the same rate of postage, whether brought in British or\r\nAmerican vessels. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General\r\nfor a full statement of the facts of the case and of the steps taken by\r\nhim to correct this inequality. He has exerted all the power conferred\r\nupon him by the existing laws.\r\n\r\nThe minister of the United States at London has brought the subject to\r\nthe attention of the British Government, and is now engaged in\r\nnegotiations for the purpose of adjusting reciprocal postal arrangements\r\nwhich shall be equally just to both countries. Should he fail in\r\nconcluding such arrangements, and should Great Britain insist on\r\nenforcing the unequal and unjust measure she has adopted, it will become\r\nnecessary to confer additional powers on the Postmaster-General in order\r\nto enable him to meet the emergency and to put our own steamers on an\r\nequal footing with British steamers engaged in transporting the mails\r\nbetween the two countries, and I recommend that such powers be\r\nconferred.\r\n\r\nIn view of the existing state of our country, I trust it may not be\r\ninappropriate, in closing this communication, to call to mind the words\r\nof wisdom and admonition of the first and most illustrious of my\r\npredecessors in his Farewell Address to his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThat greatest and best of men, who served his country so long and loved\r\nit so much, foresaw with \"serious concern\" the danger to our Union of\r\n\"characterizing parties by _geographical_ discriminations--_Northern_\r\nand _Southern_, _Atlantic_ and _Western_--whence designing men may\r\nendeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local\r\ninterests and views,\" and warned his countrymen against it.\r\n\r\nSo deep and solemn was his conviction of the importance of the Union and\r\nof preserving harmony between its different parts, that he declared to\r\nhis countrymen in that address:\r\n\r\n  It is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense\r\n  value of your national union to your collective and individual\r\n  happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable\r\n  attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of\r\n  the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its\r\n  preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest\r\n  even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly\r\n  frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion\r\n  of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now\r\n  link together the various parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of half a century these admonitions of Washington fall\r\nupon us with all the force of truth. It _is_ difficult to estimate the\r\n\"immense value\" of our glorious Union of confederated States, to which\r\nwe are so much indebted for our growth in population and wealth and for\r\nall that constitutes us a great and a happy nation. How unimportant are\r\nall our differences of opinion upon minor questions of public policy\r\ncompared with its preservation, and how scrupulously should we avoid all\r\nagitating topics which may tend to distract and divide us into\r\ncontending parties, separated by geographical lines, whereby it may be\r\nweakened or endangered.\r\n\r\nInvoking the blessing of the Almighty Ruler of the Universe upon your\r\ndeliberations, it will be my highest duty, no less than my sincere\r\npleasure, to cooperate with you in all measures which may tend to\r\npromote the honor and enduring welfare of our common country.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 20, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate, for their consideration and advice\r\nwith regard to its ratification, a convention between the United States\r\nand the Swiss Confederation, signed in this city by their respective\r\nplenipotentiaries on the 18th day of May last, for the mutual abolition\r\nof the _droit d'aubaine_ and of taxes on emigration.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 21, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith, for the consideration and constitutional action of\r\nthe Senate, two treaties with the Chippewa Indians of Lake Superior and\r\nthe Upper Mississippi, for a portion of the lands possessed by those\r\nIndians west of the Mississippi River. The treaties are accompanied by\r\ncommunications from the Secretary of War and Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs, which fully explain their nature and objects.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 22, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report of the Secretary of the Navy, containing\r\na statement of the measures which have been taken in execution of the\r\nact of 3d March last, relating to the construction of floating dry docks\r\nat Pensacola, Philadelphia, and Kittery.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 4, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report of the Secretary of War, with\r\naccompanying documents, being in addition to a report made on the 27th\r\nof February, 1847, in answer to a resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 1st of that month, requesting the President \"to\r\ncommunicate to the House of Representatives all the correspondence with\r\nGeneral Taylor since the commencement of hostilities with Mexico which\r\nhas not yet been published, and the publication of which may not be\r\ndeemed detrimental to the public service; also the correspondence of the\r\nQuartermaster-General in relation to transportation for General Taylor's\r\nArmy; also the reports of Brigadier-Generals Hamer and Quitman of the\r\noperations of their respective brigades on the 21st of September last\"\r\n(1846).\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 12, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have carefully considered the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 4th instant, requesting the President to\r\ncommunicate to that House \"any instructions which may have been given to\r\nany of the officers of the Army or Navy of the United States, or other\r\npersons, in regard to the return of President General Lopez de Santa\r\nAnna, or any other Mexican, to the Republic of Mexico prior or\r\nsubsequent to the order of the President or Secretary of War issued in\r\nJanuary, 1846, for the march of the Army from the Nueces River, across\r\nthe 'stupendous deserts' which intervene, to the Rio Grande; that the\r\ndate of all such instructions, orders, and correspondence be set forth,\r\ntogether with the instructions and orders issued to Mr. Slidell at any\r\ntime prior or subsequent to his departure for Mexico as minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States to that Republic;\" and requesting\r\nthe President also to \"communicate all the orders and correspondence of\r\nthe Government in relation to the return of General Paredes to Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith reports from the Secretary of State, the Secretary\r\nof War, and the Secretary of the Navy, with the documents accompanying\r\nthe same, which contain all the information in the possession of the\r\nExecutive which it is deemed compatible with the public interests to\r\ncommunicate.\r\n\r\nFor further information relating to the return of Santa Anna to Mexico I\r\nrefer you to my annual message of December 8, 1846. The facts and\r\nconsiderations stated in that message induced the order of the Secretary\r\nof the Navy to the commander of our squadron in the Gulf of Mexico a\r\ncopy of which is herewith communicated. This order was issued\r\nsimultaneously with the order to blockade the coasts of Mexico, both\r\nbearing date the 13th of May, 1846, the day on which the existence of\r\nthe war with Mexico was recognized by Congress. It was issued solely\r\nupon the views of policy presented in that message, and without any\r\nunderstanding on the subject, direct or indirect, with Santa Anna or any\r\nother person.\r\n\r\nGeneral Paredes evaded the vigilance of our combined forces by land and\r\nsea, and made his way back to Mexico from the exile into which he had\r\nbeen driven, landing at Vera Cruz after that city and the castle of San\r\nJuan de Ulloa were in our military occupation, as will appear from the\r\naccompanying reports and documents.\r\n\r\nThe resolution calls for the \"instructions and orders issued to Mr.\r\nSlidell at any time prior or subsequent to his departure for Mexico as\r\nminister plenipotentiary of the United States to that Republic.\" The\r\ncustomary and usual reservation contained in calls of either House of\r\nCongress upon the Executive for information relating to our intercourse\r\nwith foreign nations has been omitted in the resolution before me. The\r\ncall of the House is unconditional. It is that the information requested\r\nbe communicated, and thereby be made public, whether in the opinion of\r\nthe Executive (who is charged by the Constitution with the duty of\r\nconducting negotiations with foreign powers) such information, when\r\ndisclosed, would be prejudicial to the public interest or not. It has\r\nbeen a subject of serious deliberation with me whether I could,\r\nconsistently with my constitutional duty and my sense of the public\r\ninterests involved and to be affected by it, violate an important\r\nprinciple, always heretofore held sacred by my predecessors, as I should\r\ndo by a compliance with the request of the House. President Washington,\r\nin a message to the House of Representatives of the 30th of March, 1796,\r\ndeclined to comply with a request contained in a resolution of that\r\nbody, to lay before them \"a copy of the instructions to the minister of\r\nthe United States who negotiated the treaty with the King of Great\r\nBritain, together with the correspondence and other documents relative\r\nto that treaty, excepting such of the said papers as any existing\r\nnegotiation may render improper to be disclosed.\" In assigning his\r\nreasons for declining to comply with the call he declared that--\r\n\r\n  The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success\r\n  must often depend on secrecy; and even when brought to a conclusion a\r\n  full disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions\r\n  which may have been proposed or contemplated would be extremely\r\n  impolitic; for this might have a pernicious influence on future\r\n  negotiations, or produce immediate inconveniences, perhaps danger and\r\n  mischief, in relation to other powers. The necessity of such caution and\r\n  secrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making treaties\r\n  in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, the\r\n  principle on which that body was formed confining it to a small number\r\n  of members. To admit, then, a right in the House of Representatives to\r\n  demand and to have as a matter of course all the papers respecting a\r\n  negotiation with a foreign power would be to establish a dangerous\r\n  precedent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that case the instructions and documents called for related to a\r\ntreaty which had been concluded and ratified by the President and\r\nSenate, and the negotiations in relation to it had been terminated.\r\nThere was an express reservation, too, \"excepting\" from the call all\r\nsuch papers as related to \"any existing negotiations\" which it might be\r\nimproper to disclose. In that case President Washington deemed it to be\r\na violation of an important principle, the establishment of a \"dangerous\r\nprecedent,\" and prejudicial to the public interests to comply with the\r\ncall of the House. Without deeming it to be necessary on the present\r\noccasion to examine or decide upon the other reasons assigned by him for\r\nhis refusal to communicate the information requested by the House, the\r\none which is herein recited is in my judgment conclusive in the case\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the objections to complying with the request of the House\r\ncontained in the resolution before me are much stronger than those which\r\nexisted in the case of the resolution in 1796. This resolution calls for\r\nthe \"instructions and orders\" to the minister of the United States to\r\nMexico which relate to negotiations which have not been terminated, and\r\nwhich may be resumed. The information called for respects negotiations\r\nwhich the United States offered to open with Mexico immediately\r\npreceding the commencement of the existing war. The instructions given\r\nto the minister of the United States relate to the differences between\r\nthe two countries out of which the war grew and the terms of adjustment\r\nwhich we were prepared to offer to Mexico in our anxiety to prevent the\r\nwar. These differences still remain unsettled, and to comply with the\r\ncall of the House would be to make public through that channel, and to\r\ncommunicate to Mexico, now a public enemy engaged in war, information\r\nwhich could not fail to produce serious embarrassment in any future\r\nnegotiation between the two countries. I have heretofore communicated to\r\nCongress all the correspondence of the minister of the United States to\r\nMexico which in the existing state of our relations with that Republic\r\ncan, in my judgment, be at this time communicated without serious injury\r\nto the public interest.\r\n\r\nEntertaining this conviction, and with a sincere desire to furnish any\r\ninformation which may be in possession of the executive department, and\r\nwhich either House of Congress may at any time request, I regard it to\r\nbe my constitutional right and my solemn duty under the circumstances of\r\nthis case to decline a compliance with the request of the House\r\ncontained in their resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 21, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate, for its consideration, a declaration\r\nof the Government of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, bearing\r\ndate at the city of Schwerin on the 9th December, 1847, acceding\r\nsubstantially to the stipulations of our treaty of commerce and\r\nnavigation with Hanover of the 10th June, 1846.\r\n\r\nUnder the twelfth article of this treaty--\r\n\r\n  The United States agree to extend all the advantages and privileges\r\n  contained in the stipulations of the present treaty to one or more of\r\n  the other States of the Germanic Confederation which may wish to accede\r\n  to them, by means of an official exchange of declarations, provided that\r\n  such State or States shall confer similar favors upon the said United\r\n  States to those conferred by the Kingdom of Hanover, and observe and be\r\n  subject to the same conditions, stipulations, and obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis declaration of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin is submitted\r\nto the Senate, because in its eighth and eleventh articles it is not the\r\nsame in terms with the corresponding articles of our treaty with\r\nHanover. The variations, however, are deemed unimportant, while the\r\nadmission of our \"paddy,\" or rice in the husk, into Mecklenburg-Schwerin\r\nfree of import duty is an important concession not contained in the\r\nHanoverian treaty. Others might be mentioned, which will appear upon\r\ninspection. Still, as the stipulations in the two articles just\r\nmentioned in the declaration are not the same as those contained in the\r\ncorresponding articles of our treaty with Hanover, I deem it proper to\r\nsubmit this declaration to the Senate for their consideration before\r\nissuing a proclamation to give it effect.\r\n\r\nI also communicate a dispatch from the special agent on the part of the\r\nUnited States, which accompanied the declaration.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 10, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 1st instant, requesting\r\nto be informed whether \"any taxes, duties, or imposts\" have been \"laid\r\nand collected upon goods and merchandise belonging to citizens of the\r\nUnited States exported by such citizens from the United States to\r\nMexico, and, if so, what is the rate of such duties, and what amount has\r\nbeen collected, and also by what authority of law the same have been\r\nlaid and collected,\" I refer the Senate to my annual message of the 7th\r\nof December last, in which I informed Congress that orders had been\r\ngiven to our military and naval commanders in Mexico to adopt the\r\npolicy, as far as practicable, of levying military contributions upon\r\nthe enemy for the support of our Army.\r\n\r\nAs one of the modes adopted for levying such contributions, it was\r\nstated in that message that--\r\n\r\n  On the 31st of March last I caused an order to be issued to our military\r\n  and naval commanders to levy and collect a military contribution upon\r\n  all vessels and merchandise which might enter any of the ports of Mexico\r\n  in our military occupation, and to apply such contributions toward\r\n  defraying the expenses of the war. By virtue of the right of conquest\r\n  and the laws of war, the conqueror, consulting his own safety or\r\n  convenience, may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all\r\n  such ports or permit it upon such terms and conditions as he may\r\n  prescribe. Before the principal ports of Mexico were blockaded by our\r\n  Navy the revenue derived from import duties under the laws of Mexico was\r\n  paid into the Mexican treasury. After these ports had fallen into our\r\n  military possession the blockade was raised and commerce with them\r\n  permitted upon prescribed terms and conditions. They were opened to the\r\n  trade of all nations upon the payment of duties more moderate in their\r\n  amount than those which had been previously levied by Mexico, and the\r\n  revenue, which was formerly paid into the Mexican treasury, was directed\r\n  to be collected by our military and naval officers and applied to the\r\n  use of our Army and Navy. Care was taken that the officers, soldiers,\r\n  and sailors of our Army and Navy should be exempted from the operations\r\n  of the order, and, as the merchandise imported upon which the order\r\n  operated must be consumed by Mexican citizens, the contributions exacted\r\n  were in effect the seizure of the public revenues of Mexico and the\r\n  application of them to our own use. In directing this measure the object\r\n  was to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the\r\n  expenses of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nA copy of the order referred to, with the documents accompanying it, has\r\nbeen communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe order operated upon the vessels and merchandise of all nations,\r\nwhether belonging to citizens of the United States or to foreigners,\r\narriving in any of the ports in Mexico in our military occupation. The\r\ncontributions levied were a tax upon Mexican citizens, who were the\r\nconsumers of the merchandise imported. But for the permit or license\r\ngranted by the order all vessels and merchandise belonging to citizens\r\nof the United States were necessarily excluded from all commerce with\r\nMexico from the commencement of the war. The coasts and ports of Mexico\r\nwere ordered to be placed under blockade on the day Congress declared\r\nthe war to exist, and by the laws of nations the blockade applied to the\r\nvessels of the United States as well as to the vessels of all other\r\nnations. Had no blockade been declared, or had any of our merchant\r\nvessels entered any of the ports of Mexico not blockaded, they would\r\nhave been liable to be seized and condemned as lawful prize by the\r\nMexican authorities. When the order was issued, it operated as a\r\nprivilege to the vessels of the United States as well as to those of\r\nforeign countries to enter the ports held by our arms upon prescribed\r\nterms and conditions. It was altogether optional with citizens of the\r\nUnited States and foreigners to avail themselves of the privileges\r\ngranted upon the terms prescribed.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the United States and foreigners have availed themselves of\r\nthese privileges.\r\n\r\nNo principle is better established than that a nation at war has the\r\nright of shifting the burden off itself and imposing it on the enemy by\r\nexacting military contributions. The mode of making such exactions must\r\nbe left to the discretion of the conqueror, but it should be exercised\r\nin a manner conformable to the rules of civilized warfare.\r\n\r\nThe right to levy these contributions is essential to the successful\r\nprosecution of war in an enemy's country, and the practice of nations\r\nhas been in accordance with this principle. It is as clearly necessary\r\nas the right to fight battles, and its exercise is often essential to\r\nthe subsistence of the army.\r\n\r\nEntertaining no doubt that the military right to exclude commerce\r\naltogether from the ports of the enemy in our military occupation\r\nincluded the minor right of admitting it under prescribed conditions,\r\nit became an important question at the date of the order whether there\r\nshould be a discrimination between vessels and cargoes belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States and vessels and cargoes belonging to\r\nneutral nations.\r\n\r\nHad the vessels and cargoes belonging to citizens of the United States\r\nbeen admitted without the payment of any duty, while a duty was levied\r\non foreign vessels and cargoes, the object of the order would have been\r\ndefeated. The whole commerce would have been conducted in American\r\nvessels, no contributions could have been collected, and the enemy would\r\nhave been furnished with goods without the exaction from him of any\r\ncontribution whatever, and would have been thus benefited by our\r\nmilitary occupation, instead of being made to feel the evils of the war.\r\nIn order to levy these contributions and to make them available for the\r\nsupport of the Army, it became, therefore, absolutely necessary that\r\nthey should be collected upon imports into Mexican ports, whether in\r\nvessels belonging to citizens of the United States or to foreigners.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed proper to extend the privilege to vessels and their\r\ncargoes belonging to neutral nations. It has been my policy since the\r\ncommencement of the war with Mexico to act justly and liberally toward\r\nall neutral nations, and to afford to them no just cause of complaint;\r\nand we have seen the good consequences of this policy by the general\r\nsatisfaction which it has given.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the inquiry contained in the resolution as to the rates of\r\nduties imposed, I refer you to the documents which accompanied my annual\r\nmessage of the 7th of December last, which contain the information.\r\n\r\nFrom the accompanying reports of the Secretary of War and the Secretary\r\nof the Navy it will be seen that the contributions have been collected\r\non all vessels and cargoes, whether American or foreign; but the returns\r\nto the Departments do not show with exactness the amounts collected on\r\nAmerican as distinguishable from foreign vessels and merchandise.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 10, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 7th\r\ninstant, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nNo communication has been received from Mexico \"containing propositions\r\nfrom the Mexican authorities or commissioners for a treaty of peace,\"\r\nexcept the \"counter projet\" presented by the Mexican commissioners to\r\nthe commissioners of the United States on the 6th of September last,\r\na copy of which, with the documents accompanying it, I communicated\r\nto the Senate of the United States on the 2d instant. A copy of my\r\ncommunication to the Senate embracing this \"projet\" is herewith\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 14, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce, and navigation\r\nbetween the United States and the Republic of Peru, concluded and signed\r\nin this city on the 9th instant by the Secretary of State and the\r\nminister plenipotentiary of Peru, in behalf of their respective\r\nGovernments. I also transmit a copy of the correspondence between them\r\nwhich led to the treaty.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 15, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report of the Secretary of War, together with\r\nthe accompanying report of the Adjutant-General, in answer to the\r\nresolution of the Senate of the 7th instant, calling for information in\r\nregard to the order or law by virtue of which certain words \"in relation\r\nto the promotion of cadets have been inserted in the Army Register of\r\nthe United States, page 45, in the year 1847.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 22, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their consideration and advice as to its\r\nratification, a treaty of peace, friendship, limits, and settlement,\r\nsigned at the city of Guadalupe Hidalgo on the 2d day of February, 1848,\r\nby N.P. Trist on the part of the United States, and by plenipotentiaries\r\nappointed for that purpose on the part of the Mexican Government.\r\n\r\nI deem it to be my duty to state that the recall of Mr. Trist as\r\ncommissioner of the United States, of which Congress was informed in my\r\nannual message, was dictated by a belief that his continued presence\r\nwith the Army could be productive of no good, but might do much harm by\r\nencouraging the delusive hopes and false impressions of the Mexicans,\r\nand that his recall would satisfy Mexico that the United States had no\r\nterms of peace more favorable to offer. Directions were given that any\r\npropositions for peace which Mexico might make should be received and\r\ntransmitted by the commanding general of our forces to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt was not expected that Mr. Trist would remain in Mexico or continue in\r\nthe exercise of the functions of the office of commissioner after he\r\nreceived his letter of recall. He has, however, done so, and the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the Government of Mexico, with a knowledge of the\r\nfact, have concluded with him this treaty. I have examined it with a\r\nfull sense of the extraneous circumstances attending its conclusion and\r\nsignature, which might be objected to, but conforming as it does\r\nsubstantially on the main questions of boundary and indemnity to the\r\nterms which our commissioner, when he left the United States in April\r\nlast, was authorized to offer, and animated as I am by the spirit which\r\nhas governed all my official conduct toward Mexico, I have felt it to be\r\nmy duty to submit it to the Senate for their consideration with a view\r\nto its ratification.\r\n\r\nTo the tenth article of the treaty there are serious objections, and no\r\ninstructions given to Mr. Trist contemplated or authorized its\r\ninsertion. The public lands within the limits of Texas belong to that\r\nState, and this Government has no power to dispose of them or to change\r\nthe conditions of grants already made. All valid titles to lands within\r\nthe other territories ceded to the United States will remain unaffected\r\nby the change of sovereignty; and I therefore submit that this article\r\nshould not be ratified as a part of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThere may be reason to apprehend that the ratification of the\r\n\"additional and secret article\" might unreasonably delay and embarrass\r\nthe final action on the treaty by Mexico. I therefore submit whether\r\nthat article should not be rejected by the Senate.\r\n\r\nIf the treaty shall be ratified as proposed to be amended, the cessions\r\nof territory made by it to the United States as indemnity, the provision\r\nfor the satisfaction of the claims of our injured citizens, and the\r\npermanent establishment of the boundary of one of the States of the\r\nUnion are objects gained of great national importance, while the\r\nmagnanimous forbearance exhibited toward Mexico, it is hoped, may insure\r\na lasting peace and good neighborhood between the two countries.\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a copy of the instructions given to Mr. Slidell\r\nin November, 1845, as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\r\nto Mexico; a copy of the instructions given to Mr. Trist in April last,\r\nand such of the correspondence of the latter with the Department of\r\nState, not heretofore communicated to Congress, as will enable the\r\nSenate to understand the action which has been had with a view to the\r\nadjustment of our difficulties with Mexico.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 24th instant,\r\nrequesting to be informed whether the active operations of the Army of\r\nthe United States in Mexico have been, and now are, suspended, and, if\r\nso, by whose agency and in virtue of what authority such armistice has\r\nbeen effected, I have to state that I have received no information\r\nrelating to the subject other than that communicated to the Senate with\r\nmy executive message of the 22d instant.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 29, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate passed in \"executive\r\nsession\" on yesterday, requesting the President \"to communicate to the\r\nSenate, _in confidence_, the entire correspondence between Mr. Trist and\r\nthe Mexican commissioners from the time of his arrival in Mexico until\r\nthe time of the negotiation of the treaty submitted to the Senate; and\r\nalso the entire correspondence between Mr. Trist and the Secretary of\r\nState in relation to his negotiations with the Mexican commissioners;\r\nalso all the correspondence between General Scott and the Government and\r\nbetween General Scott and Mr. Trist since the arrival of Mr. Trist in\r\nMexico which may be in the possession of the Government,\" I transmit\r\nherewith the correspondence called for. These documents are very\r\nvoluminous, and presuming that the Senate desired them in reference to\r\nearly action on the treaty with Mexico submitted to the consideration of\r\nthat body by my message of the 22d instant, the originals of several of\r\nthe letters of Mr. Trist are herewith, communicated, in order to save\r\nthe time which would necessarily be required to make copies of them.\r\nThese original letters, it is requested, may be returned when the Senate\r\nshall have no further use for them.\r\n\r\nThe letters of Mr. Trist to the Secretary of State, and especially such\r\nof them as bear date subsequent to the receipt by him of his letter of\r\nrecall as commissioner, it will be perceived, contain much matter that\r\nis impertinent, irrelevant, and highly exceptionable. Four of these\r\nletters, bearing date, respectively, the 29th December, 1847, January\r\n12, January 22, and January 25, 1848, have been received since the\r\ntreaty was submitted to the Senate. In the latter it is stated that the\r\nMexican commissioners who signed the treaty derived \"their full powers,\r\nbearing date on the 30th December, 1847, from the President _ad interim_\r\nof the Republic (General Anaya), constitutionally elected to that office\r\nin November by the Sovereign Constituent Congress\" of Mexico. It is\r\nimpossible that I can approve the conduct of Mr. Trist in disobeying the\r\npositive orders of his Government contained in the letter recalling him,\r\nor do otherwise than condemn much of the matter with which he has chosen\r\nto encumber his voluminous correspondence. Though all of his acts since\r\nhis recall might have been disavowed by his Government, yet Mexico can\r\ntake no such exception. The treaty which the Mexican commissioners have\r\nnegotiated with him, with a full knowledge on their part that he had\r\nbeen recalled from his mission, _is_ binding on Mexico.\r\n\r\nLooking at the actual condition of Mexico, and believing that if the\r\npresent treaty be rejected the war will probably be continued at great\r\nexpense of life and treasure for an indefinite period, and considering\r\nthat the terms, with the exceptions mentioned in my message of the 22d\r\ninstant, conform substantially, so far as relates to the main question\r\nof boundary, to those authorized by me in April last, I considered it to\r\nbe my solemn duty to the country, uninfluenced by the exceptionable\r\nconduct of Mr. Trist, to submit the treaty to the Senate with a\r\nrecommendation that it be ratified, with the modifications suggested.\r\n\r\nNothing contained in the letters received from Mr. Trist since it was\r\nsubmitted to the Senate has changed my opinion on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe resolution also calls for \"all the correspondence between General\r\nScott and the Government since the arrival of Mr. Trist in Mexico.\" A\r\nportion of that correspondence, relating to Mr. Trist and his mission,\r\naccompanies this communication. The remainder of the \"correspondence\r\nbetween General Scott and the Government\" relates mainly, if not\r\nexclusively, to military operations. A part of it was communicated to\r\nCongress with my annual message, and the whole of it will be sent to the\r\nSenate if it shall be desired by that body. As coming within the purview\r\nof the resolution, I also communicate copies of the letters of the\r\nSecretary of War to Major-General Butler in reference to Mr. Trist's\r\nremaining at the headquarters of the Army in the assumed exercise of his\r\npowers of commissioner.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

Sevier, recently appointed\r\ncommissioner to Mexico, from departing on his mission. The public\r\ninterest requires that a diplomatic functionary should proceed without\r\ndelay to Mexico, bearing with him the treaty between the United States\r\nand the Mexican Republic, lately ratified, with amendments, by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate of the United States. It is deemed\r\nproper, with this view, to appoint an associate commissioner, with full\r\npowers to act separately or jointly with Mr. Sevier.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate Nathan Clifford, of the State of Maine, to be a\r\ncommissioner, with the rank of envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary, of the United States to the Mexican Republic.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

Larkin, esq., forwarded in\r\nNovember, 1845, by Captain Gillespie, of the Marine Corps, and which was\r\nby him destroyed before entering the port of Vera Cruz, if a\r\ncommunication of the same be not, in his opinion, incompatible with the\r\npublic interests,\" I communicate herewith a report of the Secretary of\r\nState, with a copy of the dispatch referred to. The resolution of the\r\nSenate appears to have been passed in legislative session. Entertaining\r\nthe opinion that the publication of this dispatch at this time will not\r\nbe \"compatible with the public interests,\" but unwilling to withhold\r\nfrom the Senate information deemed important by that body, I communicate\r\na copy of it to the Senate in executive session.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\nMARCH 27, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 3, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress, for their information, a copy of a dispatch,\r\nwith the accompanying documents, received at the Department of State\r\nfrom the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates at Paris, giving official information of the overthrow of the\r\nFrench Monarchy, and the establishment in its stead of a \"provisional\r\ngovernment based on republican principles.\"\r\n\r\nThis great event occurred suddenly, and was accomplished almost without\r\nbloodshed. The world has seldom witnessed a more interesting or sublime\r\nspectacle than the peaceful rising of the French people, resolved to\r\nsecure for themselves enlarged liberty, and to assert, in the majesty of\r\ntheir strength, the great truth that in this enlightened age man is\r\ncapable of governing himself.\r\n\r\nThe prompt recognition of the new Government by the representative of\r\nthe United States at the French Court meets my full and unqualified\r\napprobation, and he has been authorized in a suitable manner to make\r\nknown this fact to the constituted authorities of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nCalled upon to act upon a sudden emergency, which could not have been\r\nanticipated by his instructions, he judged rightly of the feelings and\r\nsentiments of his Government and of his countrymen, when, in advance of\r\nthe diplomatic representatives of other countries, he was the first to\r\nrecognize, so far as it was in his power, the free Government\r\nestablished by the French people.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States has ever been that of nonintervention in\r\nthe domestic affairs of other countries, leaving to each to establish\r\nthe form of government of its own choice. While this wise policy will be\r\nmaintained toward France, now suddenly transformed from a monarchy into\r\na republic, all our sympathies are naturally enlisted on the side of a\r\ngreat people who, imitating our example, have resolved to be free. That\r\nsuch sympathy should exist on the part of the people of the United\r\nStates with the friends of free government in every part of the world,\r\nand especially in France, is not remarkable. We can never forget that\r\nFrance was our early friend in our eventful Revolution, and generously\r\naided us in shaking off a foreign yoke and becoming a free and\r\nindependent people.\r\n\r\nWe have enjoyed the blessings of our system of well-regulated\r\nself-government for near three-fourths of a century, and can properly\r\nappreciate its value. Our ardent and sincere congratulations are\r\nextended to the patriotic people of France upon their noble and thus far\r\nsuccessful efforts to found for their future government liberal\r\ninstitutions similar to our own.\r\n\r\nIt is not doubted that under the benign influence of free institutions\r\nthe enlightened statesmen of republican France will find it to be for\r\nher true interests and permanent glory to cultivate with the United\r\nStates the most liberal principles of international intercourse and\r\ncommercial reciprocity, whereby the happiness and prosperity of both\r\nnations will be promoted.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 13, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 28th of March, 1848, I\r\ncommunicate herewith a report of the Secretary of War, transmitting a\r\nreport of the head of the Ordnance Bureau, with the accompanying papers,\r\nrelative to \"the repeating firearms invented by Samuel Colt.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the favorable opinion entertained of the value of this arm,\r\nparticularly for a mounted corps, that the Secretary of War, as will be\r\nseen by his report, has contracted with Mr. Colt for 2,000 of his\r\npistols. He has offered to contract for an additional number at liberal\r\nprices, but the inventor is unwilling to furnish them at the prices\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nThe invention for the construction of these arms being patented, the\r\nUnited States can not manufacture them at the Government armories\r\nwithout a previous purchase of the right so to do. The right to use his\r\npatent by the United States the inventor is unwilling to dispose of at a\r\nprice deemed reasonable.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 25, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report of the Secretary of War, with\r\naccompanying documents, submitted by him as embracing the papers and the\r\ncorrespondence[18] between the Secretary of War and Major-General Scott,\r\ncalled for by the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Relating to the conduct of the war in Mexico and the\r\nrecall of General Scott from the command of the Army.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 29, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit for the consideration of Congress several communications\r\nreceived at the Department of State from Mr. Justo Sierra, commissioner\r\nof Yucatan, and also a communication from the Governor of that State,\r\nrepresenting the condition of extreme suffering to which their country\r\nhas been reduced by an insurrection of the Indians within its limits,\r\nand asking the aid of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese communications present a case of human suffering and misery which\r\ncan not fail to excite the sympathies of all civilized nations. From\r\nthese and other sources of information it appears that the Indians of\r\nYucatan are waging a war of extermination against the white race. In\r\nthis civil war they spare neither age nor sex, but put to death,\r\nindiscriminately, all who fall within their power. The inhabitants,\r\npanic stricken and destitute of arms, are flying before their savage\r\npursuers toward the coast, and their expulsion from their country or\r\ntheir extermination would seem to be inevitable unless they can obtain\r\nassistance from abroad.\r\n\r\nIn this condition they have, through their constituted authorities,\r\nimplored the aid of this Government to save them from destruction,\r\noffering in case this should be granted to transfer the \"dominion and\r\nsovereignty of the peninsula\" to the United States. Similar appeals for\r\naid and protection have been made to the Spanish and the English\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is not my purpose to recommend the adoption of any measure\r\nwith a view to the acquisition of the \"dominion and sovereignty\" over\r\nYucatan, yet, according to our established policy, we could not consent\r\nto a transfer of this \"dominion and sovereignty\" either to Spain, Great\r\nBritain, or any other European power. In the language of President\r\nMonroe in his message of December, 1823--\r\n\r\n  We should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to\r\n  any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December, 1845, I declared that--\r\n\r\n  Near a quarter of a century ago the principle was distinctly announced\r\n  to the world, in the annual message of one of my predecessors, that \"the\r\n  American continents, by the free and independent condition which they\r\n  have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as\r\n  subjects for future colonization by any European powers.\" This principle\r\n  will apply with greatly increased force should any European power\r\n  attempt to establish any new colony in North America. In the existing\r\n  circumstances of the world, the present is deemed a proper occasion to\r\n  reiterate and reaffirm the principle avowed by Mr. Monroe, and to state\r\n  my cordial concurrence in its wisdom and sound policy. The reassertion\r\n  of this principle, especially in reference to North America, is at this\r\n  day but the promulgation of a policy which no European power should\r\n  cherish the disposition to resist. Existing rights of every European\r\n  nation should be respected, but it is due alike to our safety and our\r\n  interests that the efficient protection of our laws should be extended\r\n  over our whole territorial limits, and that it should be distinctly\r\n  announced to the world as our settled policy that no future European\r\n  colony or dominion shall with our consent be planted or established on\r\n  any part of the North American continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur own security requires that the established policy thus announced\r\nshould guide our conduct, and this applies with great force to the\r\npeninsula of Yucatan. It is situate in the Gulf of Mexico, on the North\r\nAmerican continent, and, from its vicinity to Cuba, to the capes of\r\nFlorida, to New Orleans, and, indeed, to our whole southwestern coast,\r\nit would be dangerous to our peace and security if it should become a\r\ncolony of any European nation.\r\n\r\nWe have now authentic information that if the aid asked from the United\r\nStates be not granted such aid will probably be obtained from some\r\nEuropean power, which may hereafter assert a claim to \"dominion and\r\nsovereignty\" over Yucatan.\r\n\r\nOur existing relations with Yucatan are of a peculiar character, as will\r\nbe perceived from the note of the Secretary of State to their\r\ncommissioner dated on the 24th of December last, a copy of which is\r\nherewith transmitted. Yucatan has never declared her independence, and\r\nwe treated her as a State of the Mexican Republic. For this reason we\r\nhave never officially received her commissioner; but whilst this is the\r\ncase, we have to a considerable extent recognized her as a neutral in\r\nour war with Mexico. Whilst still considering Yucatan as a portion of\r\nMexico, if we had troops to spare for this purpose I would deem it\r\nproper, during the continuance of the war with Mexico, to occupy and\r\nhold military possession of her territory and to defend the white\r\ninhabitants against the incursions of the Indians, in the same way that\r\nwe have employed our troops in other States of the Mexican Republic in\r\nour possession in repelling the attacks of savages upon the inhabitants\r\nwho have maintained their neutrality in the war. But, unfortunately, we\r\ncan not at the present time, without serious danger, withdraw our forces\r\nfrom other portions of the Mexican territory now in our occupation and\r\nsend them to Yucatan. All that can be done under existing circumstances\r\nis to employ our naval forces in the Gulf not required at other points\r\nto afford them relief; but it is not to be expected that any adequate\r\nprotection can thus be afforded, as the operations of such naval forces\r\nmust of necessity be confined to the coast.\r\n\r\nI have considered it proper to communicate the information contained in\r\nthe accompanying correspondence, and I submit to the wisdom of Congress\r\nto adopt such measures as in their judgment may be expedient to prevent\r\nYucatan from becoming a colony of any European power, which in no event\r\ncould be permitted by the United States, and at the same time to rescue\r\nthe white race from extermination or expulsion from their country.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 29, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress the accompanying memorial and papers, which have\r\nbeen transmitted to me, by a special messenger employed for that\r\npurpose, by the governor and legislative assembly of Oregon Territory,\r\nwho constitute the temporary government which the inhabitants of that\r\ndistant region of our country have, from the necessity of their\r\ncondition, organized for themselves. The memorialists are citizens of\r\nthe United States. They express ardent attachment to their native land,\r\nand in their present perilous and distressed situation they earnestly\r\ninvoke the aid and protection of their Government.\r\n\r\nThey represent that \"the proud and powerful tribes of Indians\" residing\r\nin their vicinity have recently raised \"the war whoop and crimsoned\r\ntheir tomahawks in the blood of their citizens;\" that they apprehend\r\nthat \"many of the powerful tribes inhabiting the upper valley of the\r\nColumbia have formed an alliance for the purpose of carrying on\r\nhostilities against their settlements;\" that the number of the white\r\npopulation is far inferior to that of the savages; that they are\r\ndeficient in arms and money, and fear that they do not possess strength\r\nto repel the \"attack of so formidable a foe and protect their families\r\nand property from violence and rapine.\" They conclude their appeal to\r\nthe Government of the United States for relief by declaring:\r\n\r\n  If it be at all the intention of our honored parent to spread her\r\n  guardian wing over her sons and daughters in Oregon, she surely will not\r\n  refuse to do it now, when they are struggling with all the ills of a\r\n  weak and temporary government, and when perils are daily thickening\r\n  around them and preparing to burst upon their heads. When the ensuing\r\n  summer's sun shall have dispelled the snow from the mountains, we shall\r\n  look with glowing hope and restless anxiety for the coming of your laws\r\n  and your arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my message of the 5th of August, 1846, communicating \"a copy of the\r\nconvention for the settlement and adjustment of the Oregon boundary,\"\r\nI recommended to Congress that \"provision should be made by law, at\r\nthe earliest practicable period, for the organization of a Territorial\r\ngovernment in Oregon.\" In my annual message of December, 1846, and again\r\nin December, 1847, this recommendation was repeated.\r\n\r\nThe population of Oregon is believed to exceed 12,000 souls, and it is\r\nknown that it will be increased by a large number of emigrants during\r\nthe present season. The facts set forth in the accompanying memorial and\r\npapers show that the dangers to which our fellow-citizens are exposed\r\nare so imminent that I deem it to be my duty again to impress on\r\nCongress the strong claim which the inhabitants of that distant country\r\nhave to the benefit of our laws and to the protection of our Government.\r\n\r\nI therefore again invite the attention of Congress to the subject, and\r\nrecommend that laws be promptly passed establishing a Territorial\r\ngovernment and granting authority to raise an adequate volunteer force\r\nfor the defense and protection of its inhabitants. It is believed that a\r\nregiment of mounted men, with such additional force as may be raised in\r\nOregon, will be sufficient to afford the required protection. It is\r\nrecommended that the forces raised for this purpose should engage to\r\nserve for twelve months, unless sooner discharged. No doubt is\r\nentertained that, with proper inducements in land bounties, such a force\r\ncan be raised in a short time. Upon the expiration of their service many\r\nof them will doubtless desire to remain in the country and settle upon\r\nthe land which they may receive as bounty. It is deemed important that\r\nprovision be made for the appointment of a suitable number of Indian\r\nagents to reside among the various tribes in Oregon, and that\r\nappropriations be made to enable them to treat with these tribes with a\r\nview to restore and preserve peace between them and the white\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nShould the laws recommended be promptly passed, the measures for their\r\nexecution may be completed during the present season, and before the\r\nseverity of winter will interpose obstacles in crossing the Rocky\r\nMountains. If not promptly passed, a delay of another year will be the\r\nconsequence, and may prove destructive to the white settlements in\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 1, 1848_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to submit herewith a report from the\r\nAdjutant-General of the Army, inviting attention to a difficulty arising\r\nfrom the terms of certain confirmations made by the resolutions of the\r\nSenate of the 15th and 27th ultimo, the former advising and consenting\r\nto the reappointment of Captain Edward Deas, Fourth Artillery, who had\r\nbeen dismissed the service, and the latter advising and consenting to\r\nthe promotion of First Lieutenant Joseph Roberts to be captain, _vice_\r\nDeas, dismissed, and Second Lieutenant John A. Brown to be first\r\nlieutenant, _vice_ Roberts, promoted.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L. MARCY,\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n  _Washington, June 29, 1848_.\r\n\r\nHon. W.L. MARCY,\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In a list of confirmations of regular promotions just received from\r\nthe Senate, dated the 27th instant, it is observed, under the heading\r\n\"Fourth Regiment of Artillery,\" that First Lieutenant Joseph Roberts is\r\nconfirmed as a captain, _vice_ Deas, dismissed, and Second Lieutenant\r\nJohn A. Brown as first lieutenant, _vice_ Roberts, promoted.\r\n\r\nThe President, having decided to reinstate Captain Deas, nominated him\r\nfor restoration to the Senate the 12th instant, withdrawing, as the\r\nrecords show, at the same time the names of Lieutenants Roberts and\r\nBrown. This nomination of Captain Deas was confirmed the 15th of June,\r\nand he has been commissioned accordingly. I respectfully bring this\r\nmatter to your notice under the impression that as the resolutions of\r\nJune 15 and June 27 conflict with each other it may be the wish of the\r\nSenate to reconcile them by rescinding that portion of the latter which\r\nadvises and consents to the promotions of Lieutenants Roberts and Brown.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nR. JONES,\r\n  _Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 6, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of a treaty of peace, friendship, limits,\r\nand settlement between the United States and the Mexican Republic, the\r\nratifications of which were duly exchanged at the city of Queretaro, in\r\nMexico, on the 30th day of May, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe war in which our country was reluctantly involved, in the necessary\r\nvindication of the national rights and honor, has been thus terminated,\r\nand I congratulate Congress and our common constituents upon the\r\nrestoration of an honorable peace.\r\n\r\nThe extensive and valuable territories ceded by Mexico to the United\r\nStates constitute indemnity for the past, and the brilliant achievements\r\nand signal successes of our arms will be a guaranty of security for the\r\nfuture, by convincing all nations that our rights must be respected. The\r\nresults of the war with Mexico have given to the United States a\r\nnational character abroad which our country never before enjoyed. Our\r\npower and our resources have become known and are respected throughout\r\nthe world, and we shall probably be saved from the necessity of engaging\r\nin another foreign war for a long series of years. It is a subject of\r\ncongratulation that we have passed through a war of more than two years'\r\nduration with the business of the country uninterrupted, with our\r\nresources unexhausted, and the public credit unimpaired.\r\n\r\nI communicate for the information of Congress the accompanying documents\r\nand correspondence, relating to the negotiation and ratification of the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nBefore the treaty can be fully executed on the part of the United States\r\nlegislation will be required.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper to make the necessary appropriations for the payment\r\nof the $12,000,000 stipulated by the twelfth article to be paid to\r\nMexico in four equal annual installments. Three million dollars were\r\nappropriated by the act of March 3, 1847, and that sum was paid to the\r\nMexican Government after the exchange of the ratifications of the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe fifth article of the treaty provides that--\r\n\r\n  In order to designate the boundary line with due precision upon\r\n  authoritative maps, and to establish upon the ground landmarks which\r\n  shall show the limits of both Republics as described in the present\r\n  article, the two Governments shall each appoint a commissioner and a\r\n  surveyor, who, before the expiration of one year from the date of the\r\n  exchange of ratifications of this treaty, shall meet at the port of San\r\n  Diego and proceed to run and mark the said boundary in its whole course\r\n  to the mouth of the Rio Bravo del Norte.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary that provision should be made by law for the\r\nappointment of a commissioner and surveyor on the part of the United\r\nStates to act in conjunction with a commissioner and surveyor appointed\r\nby Mexico in executing the stipulations of this article.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper also to provide by law for the appointment of a \"board\r\nof commissioners\" to adjudicate and decide upon all claims of our\r\ncitizens against the Mexican Government, which by the treaty have been\r\nassumed by the United States.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico and Upper California have been ceded by Mexico to the United\r\nStates, and now constitute a part of our country. Embracing nearly ten\r\ndegrees of latitude, lying adjacent to the Oregon Territory, and\r\nextending from the Pacific Ocean to the Rio Grande, a mean distance of\r\nnearly 1,000 miles, it would be difficult to estimate the value of these\r\npossessions to the United States. They constitute of themselves a\r\ncountry large enough for a great empire, and their acquisition is second\r\nonly in importance to that of Louisiana in 1803. Rich in mineral and\r\nagricultural resources, with a climate of great salubrity, they embrace\r\nthe most important ports on the whole Pacific coast of the continent of\r\nNorth America. The possession of the ports of San Diego and Monterey and\r\nthe Bay of San Francisco will enable the United States to command the\r\nalready valuable and rapidly increasing commerce of the Pacific. The\r\nnumber of our whale ships alone now employed in that sea exceeds 700,\r\nrequiring more than 20,000 seamen to navigate them, while the capital\r\ninvested in this particular branch of commerce is estimated at not less\r\nthan $40,000,000. The excellent harbors of Upper California will under\r\nour flag afford security and repose to our commercial marine, and\r\nAmerican mechanics will soon furnish ready means of shipbuilding and\r\nrepair, which are now so much wanted in that distant sea.\r\n\r\nBy the acquisition of these possessions we are brought into immediate\r\nproximity with the west coast of America, from Cape Horn to the Russian\r\npossessions north of Oregon, with the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and\r\nby a direct voyage in steamers we will be in less than thirty days of\r\nCanton and other ports of China.\r\n\r\nIn this vast region, whose rich resources are soon to be developed by\r\nAmerican energy and enterprise, great must be the augmentation of our\r\ncommerce, and with it new and profitable demands for mechanic labor in\r\nall its branches and new and valuable markets for our manufactures and\r\nagricultural products.\r\n\r\nWhile the war has been conducted with great humanity and forbearance and\r\nwith complete success on our part, the peace has been concluded on terms\r\nthe most liberal and magnanimous to Mexico. In her hands the territories\r\nnow ceded had remained, and, it is believed, would have continued to\r\nremain, almost unoccupied, and of little value to her or to any other\r\nnation, whilst as a part of our Union they will be productive of vast\r\nbenefits to the United States, to the commercial world, and the general\r\ninterests of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe immediate establishment of Territorial governments and the extension\r\nof our laws over these valuable possessions are deemed to be not only\r\nimportant, but indispensable to preserve order and the due\r\nadministration of justice within their limits, to afford protection to\r\nthe inhabitants, and to facilitate the development of the vast resources\r\nand wealth which their acquisition has added to our country.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico having terminated, the power of the Executive to\r\nestablish or to continue temporary civil governments over these\r\nterritories, which existed under the laws of nations whilst they were\r\nregarded as conquered provinces in our military occupation, has ceased.\r\nBy their cession to the United States Mexico has no longer any power\r\nover them, and until Congress shall act the inhabitants will be without\r\nany organized government. Should they be left in this condition,\r\nconfusion and anarchy will be likely to prevail.\r\n\r\nForeign commerce to a considerable amount is now carried on in the ports\r\nof Upper California, which will require to be regulated by our laws. As\r\nsoon as our system shall be extended over this commerce, a revenue of\r\nconsiderable amount will be at once collected, and it is not doubted\r\nthat it will be annually increased. For these and other obvious reasons\r\nI deem it to be my duty earnestly to recommend the action of Congress on\r\nthe subject at the present session.\r\n\r\nIn organizing governments over these territories, fraught with such vast\r\nadvantages to every portion of our Union, I invoke that spirit of\r\nconcession, conciliation, and compromise in your deliberations in which\r\nthe Constitution was framed, in which it should be administered, and\r\nwhich is so indispensable to preserve and perpetuate the harmony and\r\nunion of the States. We should never forget that this Union of\r\nconfederated States was established and cemented by kindred blood and by\r\nthe common toils, sufferings, dangers, and triumphs of all its parts,\r\nand has been the ever-augmenting source of our national greatness and of\r\nall our blessings.\r\n\r\nThere has, perhaps, been no period since the warning so impressively\r\ngiven to his countrymen by Washington to guard against geographical\r\ndivisions and sectional parties which appeals with greater force than\r\nthe present to the patriotic, sober-minded, and reflecting of all\r\nparties and of all sections of our country. Who can calculate the value\r\nof our glorious Union? It is a model and example of free government to\r\nall the world, and is the star of hope and haven of rest to the\r\noppressed of every clime. By its preservation we have been rapidly\r\nadvanced as a nation to a height of strength, power, and happiness\r\nwithout a parallel in the history of the world. As we extend its\r\nblessings over new regions, shall we be so unwise as to endanger its\r\nexistence by geographical divisions and dissensions?\r\n\r\nWith a view to encourage the early settlement of these distant\r\npossessions, I recommend that liberal grants of the public lands be\r\nsecured to all our citizens who have settled or may in a limited period\r\nsettle within their limits.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the provisions of the treaty, orders have been issued to\r\nour military and naval forces to evacuate without delay the Mexican\r\nProvinces, cities, towns, and fortified places in our military\r\noccupation, and which are not embraced in the territories ceded to the\r\nUnited States. The Army is already on its way to the United States. That\r\nportion of it, as well regulars as volunteers, who engaged to serve\r\nduring the war with Mexico will be discharged as soon as they can be\r\ntransported or marched to convenient points in the vicinity of their\r\nhomes. A part of the Regular Army will be employed in New Mexico and\r\nUpper California to afford protection to the inhabitants and to guard\r\nour interests in these territories.\r\n\r\nThe old Army, as it existed before the commencement of the war with\r\nMexico, especially if authority be given to fill up the rank and file of\r\nthe several corps to the maximum number authorized during the war, it is\r\nbelieved, will be a sufficient force to be retained in service during a\r\nperiod of peace. A few additional officers in the line and staff of the\r\nArmy have been authorized, and these, it is believed, will be necessary\r\nin the peace establishment, and should be retained in the service.\r\n\r\nThe number of the general officers may be reduced, as vacancies occur by\r\nthe casualties of the service, to what it was before the war.\r\n\r\nWhile the people of other countries who live under forms of government\r\nless free than our own have been for ages oppressed by taxation to\r\nsupport large standing armies in periods of peace, our experience has\r\nshown that such establishments are unnecessary in a republic. Our\r\nstanding army is to be found in the bosom of society. It is composed of\r\nfree citizens, who are ever ready to take up arms in the service of\r\ntheir country when an emergency requires it. Our experience in the war\r\njust closed fully confirms the opinion that such an army may be raised\r\nupon a few weeks' notice, and that our citizen soldiers are equal to any\r\ntroops in the world. No reason, therefore, is perceived why we should\r\nenlarge our land forces and thereby subject the Treasury to an annual\r\nincreased charge. Sound policy requires that we should avoid the\r\ncreation of a large standing army in a period of peace. No public\r\nexigency requires it. Such armies are not only expensive and\r\nunnecessary, but may become dangerous to liberty.\r\n\r\nBesides making the necessary legislative provisions for the execution of\r\nthe treaty and the establishment of Territorial governments in the ceded\r\ncountry, we have, upon the restoration of peace, other important duties\r\nto perform. Among these I regard none as more important than the\r\nadoption of proper measures for the speedy extinguishment of the\r\nnational debt. It is against sound policy and the genius of our\r\ninstitutions that a public debt should be permitted to exist a day\r\nlonger than the means of the Treasury will enable the Government to pay\r\nit off. We should adhere to the wise policy laid down by President\r\nWashington, of \"avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by\r\nshunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of\r\npeace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars have occasioned, not\r\nungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves\r\nought to bear.\"\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the present Administration the public debt\r\namounted to $17,788,799.62. In consequence of the war with Mexico, it\r\nhas been necessarily increased, and now amounts to $65,778,450.41,\r\nincluding the stock and Treasury notes which may yet be issued under the\r\nact of January 28, 1847, and the $16,000,000 loan recently negotiated\r\nunder the act of March 31, 1848.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the amount of the debt, the treaty stipulates that\r\n$12,000,000 shall be paid to Mexico, in four equal annual installments\r\nof $3,000,000 each, the first of which will fall due on the 30th day of\r\nMay, 1849. The treaty also stipulates that the United States shall\r\n\"assume and pay\" to our own citizens \"the claims already liquidated and\r\ndecided against the Mexican Republic,\" and \"all claims not heretofore\r\ndecided against the Mexican Government,\" \"to an amount not exceeding\r\nthree and a quarter millions of dollars.\" The \"liquidated\" claims of\r\ncitizens of the United States against Mexico, as decided by the joint\r\nboard of commissioners under the convention between the United States\r\nand Mexico of the 11th of April, 1839, amounted to $2,026,139.68. This\r\nsum was payable in twenty equal annual installments. Three of them have\r\nbeen paid to the claimants by the Mexican Government and two by the\r\nUnited States, leaving to be paid of the principal of the liquidated\r\namount assumed by the United States the sum of $1,519,604.76, together\r\nwith the interest thereon. These several amounts of \"liquidated\" and\r\nunliquidated claims assumed by the United States, it is believed, may be\r\npaid as they fall due out of the accruing revenue, without the issue of\r\nstock or the creation of any additional public debt.\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly recommend to Congress the importance of\r\nhusbanding all our national resources, of limiting the public\r\nexpenditures to necessary objects, and of applying all the surplus at\r\nany time in the Treasury to the redemption of the debt. I recommend that\r\nauthority be vested in the Executive by law to anticipate the period of\r\nreimbursement of such portion of the debt as may not be now redeemable,\r\nand to purchase it at par, or at the premium which it may command in the\r\nmarket, in all cases in which that authority has not already been\r\ngranted. A premium has been obtained by the Government on much the\r\nlarger portion of the loans, and if when the Government becomes a\r\npurchaser of its own stock it shall command a premium in the market,\r\nit will be sound policy to pay it rather than to pay the semiannual\r\ninterest upon it. The interest upon the debt, if the outstanding\r\nTreasury notes shall be funded, from the end of the last fiscal year\r\nuntil it shall fall due and be redeemable will be very nearly equal to\r\nthe principal, which must itself be ultimately paid.\r\n\r\nWithout changing or modifying the present tariff of duties, so great has\r\nbeen the increase of our commerce under its benign operation that the\r\nrevenue derived from that source and from the sales of the public lands\r\nwill, it is confidently believed, enable the Government to discharge\r\nannually several millions of the debt and at the same time possess the\r\nmeans of meeting necessary appropriations for all other proper objects.\r\nUnless Congress shall authorize largely increased expenditures for\r\nobjects not of absolute necessity, the whole public debt existing before\r\nthe Mexican war and that created during its continuance may be paid off\r\nwithout any increase of taxation on the people long before it falls due.\r\n\r\nUpon the restoration of peace we should adopt the policy suited to a\r\nstate of peace. In doing this the earliest practicable payment of the\r\npublic debt should be a cardinal principle of action. Profiting by the\r\nexperience of the past, we should avoid the errors into which the\r\ncountry was betrayed shortly after the close of the war with Great\r\nBritain in 1815. In a few years after that period a broad and\r\nlatitudinous construction of the powers of the Federal Government\r\nunfortunately received but too much countenance. Though the country was\r\nburdened with a heavy public debt, large, and in some instances\r\nunnecessary and extravagant, expenditures were authorized by Congress.\r\nThe consequence was that the payment of the debt was postponed for more\r\nthan twenty years, and even then it was only accomplished by the stern\r\nwill and unbending policy of President Jackson, who made its payment a\r\nleading measure of his Administration. He resisted the attempts which\r\nwere made to divert the public money from that great object and apply it\r\nin wasteful and extravagant expenditures for other objects, some of them\r\nof more than doubtful constitutional authority and expediency.\r\n\r\nIf the Government of the United States shall observe a proper economy in\r\nits expenditures, and be confined in its action to the conduct of our\r\nforeign relations and to the few general objects of its care enumerated\r\nin the Constitution, leaving all municipal and local legislation to the\r\nStates, our greatness as a nation, in moral and physical power and in\r\nwealth and resources, can not be calculated.\r\n\r\nBy pursuing this policy oppressive measures, operating unequally and\r\nunjustly upon sections and classes, will be avoided, and the people,\r\nhaving no cause of complaint, will pursue their own interests under the\r\nblessings of equal laws and the protection of a just and paternal\r\nGovernment. By abstaining from the exercise of all powers not clearly\r\nconferred, the current of our glorious Union, now numbering thirty\r\nStates, will be strengthened as we grow in age and increase in\r\npopulation, and our future destiny will be without a parallel or example\r\nin the history of nations.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 7, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor the reasons mentioned in the accompanying letter of the Secretary of\r\nWar, I ask that the date in the promotion of Captain W.J. Hardee, Second\r\nDragoons, to be major by brevet for gallant and meritorious conduct in\r\nthe affair at Madellin, Mexico, be changed to the 25th of March, 1847,\r\nthe day on which the action occurred.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 7, 1848_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: Captain W.J. Hardee, Second Dragoons, has been promoted to be major\r\nby brevet for gallant and meritorious conduct in the affair at Madellin,\r\nMexico, to date from the 26th of March, 1847. As this affair took place\r\non the 25th of that month, I respectfully recommend that the Senate be\r\nasked to change the date of Captain Hardee's brevet rank so as to\r\ncorrespond with the date of the action, to wit, the 25th of March, 1847.\r\nBrevets which have been conferred upon other officers in the same affair\r\ntake the latter date.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L. MARCY,\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 12, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate, of the 21st June, 1848, I\r\nherewith communicate to the Senate a report of the Secretary of War,\r\nwith the accompanying documents, containing the proceedings of a court\r\nof inquiry which convened at Saltillo, Mexico, January 12, 1848, and\r\nwhich was instituted for the purpose of obtaining full information\r\nrelative to an alleged mutiny in the camp of Buena Vista, Mexico, on or\r\nabout the 15th of August, 1847.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 14, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of July 13, 1848, I\r\ntransmit herewith a report of the Secretary of War and accompanying\r\ndocuments, containing all the proceedings of the two courts of inquiry\r\nin the case of Major-General Pillow, the one commenced and terminated in\r\nMexico, the other commenced in Mexico and terminated in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 24, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolutions of the House of Representatives of the 10th\r\ninstant, requesting information in relation to New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia, I communicate herewith reports from the Secretary of State,\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, with the documents which accompany the same. These reports\r\nand documents contain information upon the several points of inquiry\r\nembraced by the resolutions. \"The proper limits and boundaries of New\r\nMexico and California\" are delineated on the map referred to in the late\r\ntreaty with Mexico, an authentic copy of which is herewith transmitted;\r\nand all the additional information upon that subject, and also the most\r\nreliable information in respect to the population of these respective\r\nProvinces, which is in the possession of the Executive will be found in\r\nthe accompanying report of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions request information in regard to the existence of civil\r\ngovernments in New Mexico and California, their \"form and character,\" by\r\n\"whom instituted,\" by \"what authority,\" and how they are \"maintained and\r\nsupported.\"\r\n\r\nIn my message of December 22, 1846, in answer to a resolution of the\r\nHouse of Representatives calling for information \"in relation to the\r\nestablishment or organization of civil government in any portion of the\r\nterritory of Mexico which has or might be taken possession of by the\r\nArmy or Navy of the United States,\" I communicated the orders which had\r\nbeen given to the officers of our Army and Navy, and stated the general\r\nauthority upon which temporary military governments had been established\r\nover the conquered portion of Mexico then in our military occupation.\r\n\r\nThe temporary governments authorized were instituted by virtue of the\r\nrights of war. The power to declare war against a foreign country, and\r\nto prosecute it according to the general laws of war, as sanctioned by\r\ncivilized nations, it will not be questioned, exists under our\r\nConstitution. When Congress has declared that war exists with a foreign\r\nnation, \"the general laws of war apply to our situation,\" and it becomes\r\nthe duty of the President, as the constitutional \"Commander in Chief of\r\nthe Army and Navy of the United States,\" to prosecute it.\r\n\r\nIn prosecuting a foreign war thus duly declared by Congress, we have the\r\nright, by \"conquest and military occupation,\" to acquire possession of\r\nthe territories of the enemy, and, during the war, to \"exercise the\r\nfullest rights of sovereignty over it.\" The sovereignty of the enemy is\r\nin such case \"suspended,\" and his laws can \"no longer be rightfully\r\nenforced\" over the conquered territory \"or be obligatory upon the\r\ninhabitants who remain and submit to the conqueror. By the surrender the\r\ninhabitants pass under a temporary allegiance\" to the conqueror, and are\r\n\"bound by such laws, and such only, as\" he may choose to recognize and\r\nimpose. \"From the nature of the case, no other laws could be obligatory\r\nupon them, for where there is no protection or allegiance or sovereignty\r\nthere can be no claim to obedience.\" These are well-established\r\nprinciples of the laws of war, as recognized and practiced by civilized\r\nnations, and they have been sanctioned by the highest judicial tribunal\r\nof our own country.\r\n\r\nThe orders and instructions issued to the officers of our Army and Navy,\r\napplicable to such portions of the Mexican territory as had been or\r\nmight be conquered by our arms, were in strict conformity to these\r\nprinciples. They were, indeed, ameliorations of the rigors of war upon\r\nwhich we might have insisted. They substituted for the harshness of\r\nmilitary rule something of the mildness of civil government, and were\r\nnot only the exercise of no excess of power, but were a relaxation in\r\nfavor of the peaceable inhabitants of the conquered territory who had\r\nsubmitted to our authority, and were alike politic and humane.\r\n\r\nIt is from the same source of authority that we derive the unquestioned\r\nright, after the war has been declared by Congress, to blockade the\r\nports and coasts of the enemy, to capture his towns, cities, and\r\nprovinces, and to levy contributions upon him for the support of our\r\nArmy. Of the same character with these is the right to subject to our\r\ntemporary military government the conquered territories of our enemy.\r\nThey are all belligerent rights, and their exercise is as essential to\r\nthe successful prosecution of a foreign war as the right to fight\r\nbattles.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico and Upper California were among the territories conquered and\r\noccupied by our forces, and such temporary governments were established\r\nover them. They were established by the officers of our Army and Navy in\r\ncommand, in pursuance of the orders and instructions accompanying my\r\nmessage to the House of Representatives of December 22, 1846. In their\r\nform and detail, as at first established, they exceeded in some\r\nrespects, as was stated in that message, the authority which had been\r\ngiven, and instructions for the correction of the error were issued in\r\ndispatches from the War and Navy Departments of the 11th of January,\r\n1847, copies of which are herewith transmitted. They have been\r\nmaintained and supported out of the military exactions and contributions\r\nlevied upon the enemy, and no part of the expense has been paid out of\r\nthe Treasury of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the routine of duty some of the officers of the Army and Navy who\r\nfirst established temporary governments in California and New Mexico\r\nhave been succeeded in command by other officers, upon whom light duties\r\ndevolved; and the agents employed or designated by them to conduct the\r\ntemporary governments have also, in some instances, been superseded by\r\nothers. Such appointments for temporary civil duty during our military\r\noccupation were made by the officers in command in the conquered\r\nterritories, respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion and exchange of ratifications of a treaty of peace\r\nwith Mexico, which was proclaimed on the 4th instant, these temporary\r\ngovernments necessarily ceased to exist. In the instructions to\r\nestablish a temporary government over New Mexico, no distinction was\r\nmade between that and the other Provinces of Mexico which might be\r\nconquered and held in our military occupation.\r\n\r\nThe Province of New Mexico, according to its ancient boundaries, as\r\nclaimed by Mexico, lies on both sides of the Rio Grande. That part of it\r\non the east of that river was in dispute when the war between the United\r\nStates and Mexico commenced. Texas, by a successful revolution in April,\r\n1836, achieved, and subsequently maintained, her independence. By an act\r\nof the Congress of Texas passed in December, 1836, her western boundary\r\nwas declared to be the Rio Grande from its mouth to its source, and\r\nthence due north to the forty-second degree of north latitude. Though\r\nthe Republic of Texas, by many acts of sovereignty which she asserted\r\nand exercised, some of which were stated in my annual message of\r\nDecember, 1846, had established her clear title to the country west of\r\nthe Nueces, and bordering upon that part of the Rio Grande which lies\r\nbelow the Province of New Mexico, she had never conquered or reduced to\r\nactual possession and brought under her Government and laws that part of\r\nNew Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande, which she claimed to be within\r\nher limits. On the breaking out of the war we found Mexico in possession\r\nof this disputed territory. As our Army approached Sante Fe (the capital\r\nof New Mexico) it was found to be held by a governor under Mexican\r\nauthority, with an armed force collected to resist our advance. The\r\ninhabitants were Mexicans, acknowledging allegiance to Mexico. The\r\nboundary in dispute was the line between the two countries engaged in\r\nactual war, and the settlement of it of necessity depended on a treaty\r\nof peace. Finding the Mexican authorities and people in possession, our\r\nforces conquered them, and extended military rule over them and the\r\nterritory which they actually occupied, in lieu of the sovereignty which\r\nwas displaced. It was not possible to disturb or change the practical\r\nboundary line in the midst of the war, when no negotiation for its\r\nadjustment could be opened, and when Texas was not present, by her\r\nconstituted authorities, to establish and maintain government over a\r\nhostile Mexican population who acknowledged no allegiance to her. There\r\nwas, therefore, no alternative left but to establish and maintain\r\nmilitary rule during the war over the conquered people in the disputed\r\nterritory who had submitted to our arms, or to forbear the exercise of\r\nour belligerent rights and leave them in a state of anarchy and without\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nWhether the country in dispute rightfully belonged to Mexico or to\r\nTexas, it was our right in the first case, and our duty as well as our\r\nright in the latter, to conquer and hold it. Whilst this territory was\r\nin our possession as conquerors, with a population hostile to the United\r\nStates, which more than once broke out in open insurrection, it was our\r\nunquestionable duty to continue our military occupation of it until the\r\nconclusion of the war, and to establish over it a military government,\r\nnecessary for our own security as well as for the protection of the\r\nconquered people.\r\n\r\nBy the joint resolution of Congress of March 1, 1845, \"for annexing\r\nTexas to the United States,\" the \"adjustment of all questions of\r\nboundary which may arise with other governments\" was reserved to this\r\nGovernment. When the conquest of New Mexico was consummated by our arms,\r\nthe question of boundary remained still unadjusted. Until the exchange\r\nof the ratifications of the late treaty, New Mexico never became an\r\nundisputed portion of the United States, and it would therefore have\r\nbeen premature to deliver over to Texas that portion of it on the east\r\nside of the Rio Grande, to which she asserted a claim. However just the\r\nright of Texas may have been to it, that right had never been reduced\r\ninto her possession, and it was contested by Mexico.\r\n\r\nBy the cession of the whole of New Mexico, on both sides of the Rio\r\nGrande, to the United States, the question of disputed boundary, so far\r\nas Mexico is concerned, has been settled, leaving the question as to the\r\ntrue limits of Texas in New Mexico to be adjusted between that State and\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances existing during the pendency of the war, and\r\nwhile the whole of New Mexico, as claimed by our enemy, was in our\r\nmilitary occupation, I was not unmindful of the rights of Texas to that\r\nportion of it which she claimed to be within her limits. In answer to a\r\nletter from the governor of Texas dated on the 4th of January, 1847, the\r\nSecretary of State, by my direction, informed him in a letter of the\r\n12th of February, 1847, that in the President's annual message of\r\nDecember, 1846--\r\n\r\n  You have already perceived that New Mexico is at present in the\r\n  temporary occupation of the troops of the United States, and the\r\n  government over it is military in its character. It is merely such a\r\n  government as must exist under the laws of nations and of war to\r\n  preserve order and protect the rights of the inhabitants, and will cease\r\n  on the conclusion of a treaty of peace with Mexico. Nothing, therefore,\r\n  can be more certain than that this temporary government, resulting from\r\n  necessity, can never injuriously affect the right which the President\r\n  believes to be justly asserted by Texas to the whole territory on this\r\n  side of the Rio Grande whenever the Mexican claim to it shall have been\r\n  extinguished by treaty. But this is a subject which more properly\r\n  belongs to the legislative than the executive branch of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole is that Texas had asserted a right to that part\r\nof New Mexico east of the Rio Grande, which is believed, under the acts\r\nof Congress for the annexation and admission of Texas into the Union as\r\na State, and under the constitution and laws of Texas, to be well\r\nfounded; but this right had never been reduced to her actual possession\r\nand occupancy. The General Government, possessing exclusively the\r\nwar-making power, had the right to take military possession of this\r\ndisputed territory, and until the title to it was perfected by a treaty\r\nof peace it was their duty to hold it and to establish a temporary\r\nmilitary government over it for the preservation of the conquest itself,\r\nthe safety of our Army, and the security of the conquered inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions further request information whether any persons have\r\nbeen tried and condemned for \"treason against the United States in that\r\npart of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande since the same has been\r\nin the occupancy of our Army,\" and, if so, before \"what tribunal\" and\r\n\"by what authority of law such tribunal was established.\" It appears\r\nthat after the territory in question was \"in the occupancy of our Army\"\r\nsome of the conquered Mexican inhabitants, who had at first submitted to\r\nour authority, broke out in open insurrection, murdering our soldiers\r\nand citizens and committing other atrocious crimes. Some of the\r\nprincipal offenders who were apprehended were tried and condemned by a\r\ntribunal invested with civil and criminal jurisdiction, which had been\r\nestablished in the conquered country by the military officer in command.\r\nThat the offenders deserved the punishment inflicted upon them there is\r\nno reason to doubt, and the error in the proceedings against them\r\nconsisted in designating and describing their crimes as \"treason against\r\nthe United States.\" This error was pointed out, and its recurrence\r\nthereby prevented, by the Secretary of War in a dispatch to the officer\r\nin command in New Mexico dated on the 26th of June, 1847, a copy of\r\nwhich, together with copies of all communications relating to the\r\nsubject which have been received at the War Department, is herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions call for information in relation to the quantity of the\r\npublic lands acquired within the ceded territory, and \"how much of the\r\nsame is within the boundaries of Texas as defined by the act of the\r\nCongress of the Republic of Texas of the 19th day of December, 1836.\" No\r\nmeans of making an accurate estimate on the subject is in the possession\r\nof the executive department. The information which is possessed will be\r\nfound in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe country ceded to the United States lying west of the Rio Grande, and\r\nto which Texas has no title, is estimated by the commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office to contain 526,078 square miles, or 336,689,920\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe period since the exchange of ratifications of the treaty has been\r\ntoo short to enable the Government to have access to or to procure\r\nabstracts or copies of the land titles issued by Spain or by the\r\nRepublic of Mexico. Steps will be taken to procure this information at\r\nthe earliest practicable period. It is estimated, as appears from the\r\naccompanying report of the Secretary of the Treasury, that much the\r\nlarger portion of the land within the territories ceded remains vacant\r\nand unappropriated, and will be subject to be disposed of by the United\r\nStates. Indeed, a very inconsiderable portion of the land embraced in\r\nthe cession, it is believed, has been disposed of or granted either by\r\nSpain or Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhat amount of money the United States may be able to realize from the\r\nsales of these vacant lands must be uncertain, but it is confidently\r\nbelieved that with prudent management, after making liberal grants to\r\nemigrants and settlers, it will exceed the cost of the war and all the\r\nexpenses to which we have been subjected in acquiring it.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions also call for \"the evidence, or any part thereof, that\r\nthe 'extensive and valuable territories ceded by Mexico to the United\r\nStates constitute indemnity for the past.'\"\r\n\r\nThe immense value of the ceded country does not consist alone in the\r\namount of money for which the public lands may be sold. If not a dollar\r\ncould be realized from the sale of these lands, the cession of the\r\njurisdiction over the country and the fact that it has become a part of\r\nour Union and call not be made subject to any European power constitute\r\nample \"indemnity for the past\" in the immense value and advantages which\r\nits acquisition must give to the commercial, navigating, manufacturing,\r\nand agricultural interests of our country.\r\n\r\nThe value of the public lands embraced within the limits of the ceded\r\nterritory, great as that value may be, is far less important to the\r\npeople of the United States than the sovereignty over the country. Most\r\nof our States contain no public lands owned by the United States, and\r\nyet the sovereignty and jurisdiction over them is of incalculable\r\nimportance to the nation. In the State of New York the United States is\r\nthe owner of no public lands, and yet two-thirds of our whole revenue is\r\ncollected at the great port of that State, and within her limits is\r\nfound about one-seventh of our entire population. Although none of the\r\nfuture cities on our coast of California may ever rival the city of New\r\nYork in wealth, population, and business, yet that important cities will\r\ngrow up on the magnificent harbors of that coast, with a rapidly\r\nincreasing commerce and population, and yielding a large revenue, would\r\nseem to be certain. By the possession of the safe and capacious harbors\r\non the Californian coast we shall have great advantages in securing the\r\nrich commerce of the East, and shall thus obtain for our products new\r\nand increased markets and greatly enlarge our coasting and foreign\r\ntrade, as well as augment our tonnage and revenue.\r\n\r\nThese great advantages, far more than the simple value of the public\r\nlands in the ceded territory, \"constitute our indemnity for the past.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 28, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received from the Senate the \"convention for the mutual delivery\r\nof criminals, fugitives from justice, in certain cases, concluded on the\r\n29th of January, 1845, between the United States on the one part and\r\nPrussia and other States of the German Confederation on the other part,\"\r\nwith a copy of their resolution of the 21st of June last, advising and\r\nconsenting to its ratification, with an amendment extending the period\r\nfor the exchange of ratifications until the 28th of September, 1848.\r\n\r\nI have taken this subject into serious and deliberate consideration, and\r\nregret that I can not ratify this convention, in conformity with the\r\nadvice of the Senate, without violating my convictions of duty. Having\r\narrived at this conclusion, I deem it proper and respectful, considering\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of the present case and the intimate\r\nrelations which the Constitution has established between the President\r\nand Senate, to make known to you the reasons which influence me to come\r\nto this determination.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of December, 1845, I communicated this convention to the\r\nSenate for its consideration, at the same time stating my objections to\r\nthe third article. I deemed this to be a more proper and respectful\r\ncourse toward the Senate, as well as toward Prussia and the other\r\nparties to it, than if I had withheld it and disapproved it altogether.\r\nHad the Senate concurred with me in opinion and rejected the third\r\narticle, then the convention thus amended would have conformed to our\r\ntreaties of extradition with Great Britain and France.\r\n\r\nBut the Senate did not act upon it within the period limited for the\r\nexchange of ratifications. From this I concluded that they had concurred\r\nwith me in opinion in regard to the third article, and had for this and\r\nother reasons deemed it proper to take no proceedings upon the\r\nconvention. After this date, therefore, I considered the affair as\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nUpon the presumption that this was the fact, new negotiations upon the\r\nsubject were commenced, and several conferences were held between the\r\nSecretary of State and the Prussian minister. These resulted in a\r\nprotocol signed at the Department of State on the 27th of April, 1847,\r\nin which the Secretary proposed either that the two Governments might\r\nagree to extend the time for the exchange of ratifications, and thus\r\nrevive the convention, provided the Prussian Government would previously\r\nintimate its consent to the omission of the third article, or he\r\n\"expressed his willingness immediately to conclude with Mr. Gerolt a new\r\nconvention, if he possessed the requisite powers from his Government,\r\nembracing all the provisions contained in that of the 29th January,\r\n1845, with the exception of the third article. To this Mr. Gerolt\r\nobserved that he had no powers to conclude such a convention, but would\r\nsubmit the propositions of Mr. Buchanan to the Prussian Government for\r\nfurther instructions.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gerolt has never yet communicated in writing to the Department of\r\nState the answer of his Government to these propositions, but the\r\nSecretary of State, a few months after the date of the protocol, learned\r\nfrom him in conversation that they insisted upon the third article of\r\nthe convention as a _sine qua non_. Thus the second negotiation had\r\nfinally terminated by a disagreement between the parties, when, more\r\nthan a year afterwards, on the 21st June, 1848, the Senate took the\r\noriginal convention into consideration and ratified it, retaining the\r\nthird article.\r\n\r\nAfter the second negotiation with the Prussian Government, in which the\r\nobjections to the third article were stated, as they had been previously\r\nin my message of the 16th December, 1845, a strong additional difficulty\r\nwas interposed to the ratification of the convention; but I might\r\novercome this difficulty if my objections to the third article had not\r\ngrown stronger by further reflection. For a statement of them in detail\r\nI refer you to the accompanying memorandum, prepared by the Secretary of\r\nState by my direction.\r\n\r\nI can not believe that the sovereign States of this Union, whose\r\nadministration of justice would be almost exclusively affected by such a\r\nconvention, will ever be satisfied with a treaty of extradition under\r\nwhich if a German subject should commit murder or any other high crime\r\nin New York or New Orleans, and could succeed in escaping to his own\r\ncountry, he would thereby be protected from trial and punishment under\r\nthe jurisdiction of our State laws which he had violated. It is true, as\r\nhas been stated, that the German States, acting upon a principle\r\nspringing from the doctrine of perpetual allegiance, still assert the\r\njurisdiction of trying and punishing their subjects for crimes committed\r\nin the United States or any other portion of the world. It must,\r\nhowever, be manifest that individuals throughout our extended country\r\nwould rarely, if ever, follow criminals to Germany with the necessary\r\ntestimony for the purpose of prosecuting them to conviction before\r\nGerman courts for crimes committed in the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Constitution and laws of the United States, as\r\nwell as of the several States, would render it impossible that crimes\r\ncommitted by our citizens in Germany could be tried and punished in any\r\nportion of this Union.\r\n\r\nBut if no other reason existed for withholding my ratification from this\r\ntreaty, the great change which has recently occurred in the organization\r\nof the Government of the German States would be sufficient. By the last\r\nadvices we learn that the German Parliament, at Frankfort, have already\r\nestablished a federal provisional Executive for all the States of\r\nGermany, and have elected the Archduke John of Austria to be\r\n\"Administrator of the Empire.\" One of the attributes of this Executive\r\nis \"to represent the Confederation in its relations with foreign nations\r\nand to appoint diplomatic agents, ministers, and consuls.\" Indeed, our\r\nminister at Berlin has already suggested the propriety of his transfer\r\nto Frankfort. In case this convention with nineteen of the thirty-nine\r\nGerman States should be ratified, this could amount to nothing more than\r\na proposition on the part of the Senate and President to these nineteen\r\nStates who were originally parties to the convention to negotiate anew\r\non the subject of extradition. In the meantime a central German\r\nGovernment has been provisionally established, which extinguishes the\r\nright of these separate parties to enter into negotiations with foreign\r\nGovernments on subjects of several interest to the whole.\r\n\r\nAdmitting such a treaty as that which has been ratified by the Senate to\r\nbe desirable, the obvious course would now be to negotiate with the\r\nGeneral Government of Germany. A treaty concluded with it would embrace\r\nall the thirty-nine States of Germany, and its authority, being\r\ncoextensive with the Empire, fugitives from justice found in any of\r\nthese States would be surrendered up on the requisition of our minister\r\nat Frankfort. This would be more convenient and effectual than to\r\naddress such separate requisitions to each of the nineteen German States\r\nwith which the convention was concluded.\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith, for the information of the Senate, copies of a\r\ndispatch from our minister at Berlin and a communication from our consul\r\nat Darmstadt.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 29, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th\r\ninstant, requesting the President \"to communicate, if not inconsistent\r\nwith the public interests, copies of all instructions given to the Hon.\r\nAmbrose H. Sevier and Nathan Clifford, commissioners appointed to\r\nconduct negotiations for the ratification of the treaty lately concluded\r\nbetween the United States and the Republic of Mexico,\" I have to state\r\nthat in my opinion it would be \"inconsistent with the public interests\"\r\nto give publicity to these instructions at the present time.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to observe that, as a general rule\r\napplicable to all our important negotiations with foreign powers, it\r\ncould not fail to be prejudicial to the public interest to publish the\r\ninstructions to our ministers until some time had elapsed after the\r\nconclusion of such negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn the present case the object of the mission of our commissioners to\r\nMexico has been accomplished. The treaty, as amended by the Senate of\r\nthe United States, has been ratified. The ratifications have been\r\nexchanged and the treaty has been proclaimed as the supreme law of the\r\nland. No contingency occurred which made it either necessary or proper\r\nfor our commissioners to enter upon any negotiations with the Mexican\r\nGovernment further than to urge upon that Government the ratification of\r\nthe treaty in its amended form.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 1, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of War, containing\r\nthe information called for by the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 17th July, 1848, in relation to the number of\r\nIndians in Oregon, California, and New Mexico, the number of military\r\nposts, the number of troops which will be required in each, and \"the\r\nwhole military force which should constitute the peace establishment.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen no rfeason to change the opinion expressed in my message to\r\nCongress of the 6th July, 1848, transmitting the treaty of peace with\r\nMexico, that \"the old Army, as it existed before the commencement of the\r\nwar with Mexico, especially if authority be given to fill up the rank\r\nand file of the several corps to the maximum number authorized during\r\nthe war, will be a sufficient force to be retained in service during a\r\nperiod of peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Army consists of fifteen regiments. By the act of the 13th of\r\nMay, 1846, the President was authorized, by \"voluntary enlistments, to\r\nincrease the number of privates in each or any of the companies of the\r\nexisting regiments of dragoons, artillery, and infantry to any number\r\nnot exceeding 100,\" and to \"reduce the same to 64 when the exigencies\r\nrequiring the present increase shall cease.\" Should this act remain in\r\nforce, the maximum number of the rank and file of the Army authorized by\r\nit would be over 16,000 men, exclusive of officers. Should the authority\r\nconferred by this act be continued, it would depend on the exigencies of\r\nthe service whether the number of the rank and file should be increased,\r\nand, if so, to what amount beyond the minimum number of 64 privates to a\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nAllowing 64 privates to a company, the Army would be over 10,000 men,\r\nexclusive of commissioned and noncommissioned officers, a number which,\r\nit is believed, will be sufficient; but, as a precautionary measure, it\r\nis deemed expedient that the Executive should possess the power of\r\nincreasing the strength of the respective corps should the exigencies of\r\nthe service be such as to require it. Should these exigencies not call\r\nfor such increase, the discretionary power given by the act to the\r\nPresident will not be exercised.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the report of the Secretary of War that a portion\r\nof the forces will be employed in Oregon, New Mexico, and Upper\r\nCalifornia; a portion for the protection of the Texas frontier adjoining\r\nthe Mexican possessions, and bordering on the territory occupied by the\r\nIndian tribes within her limits. After detailing the force necessary for\r\nthese objects, it is believed a sufficient number of troops will remain\r\nto afford security and protection to our Indian frontiers in the West\r\nand Northwest and to occupy with sufficient garrisons the posts on our\r\nnorthern and Atlantic borders.\r\n\r\nI have no reason at present to believe that any increase of the number\r\nof regiments or corps will be required during a period of peace.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 10, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith reports from the Secretary of the Treasury and\r\nthe Secretary of War, together with the accompanying documents, in\r\nanswer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of\r\nJuly, 1848, requesting the President to inform that body what amount of\r\npublic moneys had been respectively paid to Lewis Cass and Zachary\r\nTaylor from the time of their first entrance into the public service up\r\nto this time, distinguishing between regular and extra compensation;\r\nthat he also state what amount of extra compensation has been claimed by\r\neither; the items composing the same; when filed; when and by whom\r\nallowed; if disallowed, when and by whom; the reasons for such\r\ndisallowance; and whether or not any items so disallowed were\r\nsubsequently presented for payment, and, if allowed, when and by whom.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 14, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWhen the President has given his official sanction to a bill which has\r\npassed Congress, usage requires that he shall notify the House in which\r\nit originated of that fact. The mode of giving this notification has\r\nbeen by an oral message delivered by his private secretary.\r\n\r\nHaving this day approved and signed an act entitled \"An act to establish\r\nthe Territorial government of Oregon,\" I deem it proper, under the\r\nexisting circumstances, to communicate the fact in a more solemn form.\r\nThe deeply interesting and protracted discussions which have taken place\r\nin both Houses of Congress and the absorbing interest which the subject\r\nhas excited throughout the country justify, in my judgment, this\r\ndeparture from the form of notice observed in other cases. In this\r\ncommunication with a coordinate branch of the Government, made proper by\r\nthe considerations referred to, I shall frankly and without reserve\r\nexpress the reasons which have constrained me not to withhold my\r\nsignature from the bill to establish a government over Oregon, even\r\nthough the two territories of New Mexico and California are to be left\r\nfor the present without governments. None doubt that it is proper to\r\nestablish a government in Oregon. Indeed, it has been too long delayed.\r\nI have made repeated recommendations to Congress to this effect. The\r\npetitions of the people of that distant region have been presented to\r\nthe Government, and ought not to be disregarded. To give to them a\r\nregularly organized government and the protection of our laws, which, as\r\ncitizens of the United States, they claim, is a high duty on our part,\r\nand one which we are bound to perform, unless there be controlling\r\nreasons to prevent it.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of all governments questions of such transcendent\r\nimportance occasionally arise as to cast in the shade all those of a\r\nmere party character. But one such question can now be agitated in this\r\ncountry, and this may endanger our glorious Union, the source of our\r\ngreatness and all our political blessings. This question is slavery.\r\nWith the slaveholding States this does not embrace merely the rights of\r\nproperty, however valuable, but it ascends far higher, and involves the\r\ndomestic peace and security of every family.\r\n\r\nThe fathers of the Constitution, the wise and patriotic men who laid the\r\nfoundation of our institutions, foreseeing the danger from this quarter,\r\nacted in a spirit of compromise and mutual concession on this dangerous\r\nand delicate subject, and their wisdom ought to be the guide of their\r\nsuccessors. Whilst they left to the States exclusively the question of\r\ndomestic slavery within their respective limits, they provided that\r\nslaves who might escape into other States not recognizing the\r\ninstitution of slavery shall be \"delivered up on the claim of the party\r\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this foundation the matter rested until the Missouri question\r\narose.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1819, application was made to Congress by the people of the\r\nMissouri Territory for admission into the Union as a State. The\r\ndiscussion upon the subject in Congress involved the question of\r\nslavery, and was prosecuted with such violence as to produce excitements\r\nalarming to every patriot in the Union. But the good genius of\r\nconciliation, which presided at the birth of our institutions, finally\r\nprevailed, and the Missouri compromise was adopted. The eighth section\r\nof the act of Congress of the 6th of March, 1820, \"to authorize the\r\npeople of the Missouri Territory to form a constitution and State\r\ngovernment,\" etc., provides:\r\n\r\n  That in all that territory ceded by France to the United States under\r\n  the name of Louisiana which lies north of 36 degrees 30 minutes north\r\n  latitude, not included within the limits of the State contemplated by\r\n  this act, slavery and involuntary servitude, otherwise than in the\r\n  punishment of crimes, whereof the parties shall have been duly\r\n  convicted, shall be, and is hereby, forever prohibited: _Provided\r\n  always_, That any person escaping into the same from whom labor or\r\n  service is lawfully claimed in any State or Territory of the United\r\n  States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the\r\n  person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis compromise had the effect of calming the troubled waves and\r\nrestoring peace and good will throughout the States of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri question had excited intense agitation of the public mind,\r\nand threatened to divide the country into geographical parties,\r\nalienating the feelings of attachment which each portion of our Union\r\nshould bear to every other. The compromise allayed the excitement,\r\ntranquilized the popular mind, and restored confidence and fraternal\r\nfeelings. Its authors were hailed as public benefactors.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that a similar adjustment of the questions which now\r\nagitate the public mind would produce the same happy results. If the\r\nlegislation of Congress on the subject of the other Territories shall\r\nnot be adopted in a spirit of conciliation and compromise, it is\r\nimpossible that the country can be satisfied or that the most disastrous\r\nconsequences shall fail to ensue.\r\n\r\nWhen Texas was admitted into the Union, the same spirit of compromise\r\nwhich guided our predecessors in the admission of Missouri a quarter of\r\na century before prevailed without any serious opposition. The joint\r\nresolution for annexing Texas to the United States, approved March 1,\r\n1845, provides that--\r\n\r\n  Such States as may be formed out of that portion of said territory lying\r\n  south of 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, commonly known as the\r\n  Missouri compromise line, shall be admitted into the Union with or\r\n  without slavery, as the people of each State asking admission may\r\n  desire; and in such State or States as shall be formed out of said\r\n  territory north of the Missouri compromise line slavery or involuntary\r\n  servitude (except for crime) shall be prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Oregon lies far north of 36 degrees 30 minutes, the\r\nMissouri and Texas compromise line. Its southern boundary is the\r\nparallel of 42 degrees, leaving the intermediate distance to be 330\r\ngeographical miles. And it is because the provisions of this bill are\r\nnot inconsistent with the laws of the Missouri compromise, if extended\r\nfrom the Rio Grande to the Pacific Ocean, that I have not felt at\r\nliberty to withhold my sanction. Had it embraced territories south of\r\nthat compromise, the question presented for my consideration would have\r\nbeen of a far different character, and my action upon it must have\r\ncorresponded with my convictions.\r\n\r\nOught we now to disturb the Missouri and Texas compromises? Ought we at\r\nthis late day, in attempting to annul what has been so long established\r\nand acquiesced in, to excite sectional divisions and jealousies, to\r\nalienate the people of different portions of the Union from each other,\r\nand to endanger the existence of the Union itself?\r\n\r\nFrom the adoption of the Federal Constitution, during a period of sixty\r\nyears, our progress as a nation has been without example in the annals\r\nof history. Under the protection of a bountiful Providence, we have\r\nadvanced with giant strides in the career of wealth and prosperity. We\r\nhave enjoyed the blessings of freedom to a greater extent than any other\r\npeople, ancient or modern, under a Government which has preserved order\r\nand secured to every citizen life, liberty, and property. We have now\r\nbecome an example for imitation to the whole world. The friends of\r\nfreedom in every clime point with admiration to our institutions. Shall\r\nwe, then, at the moment when the people of Europe are devoting all their\r\nenergies in the attempt to assimilate their institutions to our own,\r\nperil all our blessings by despising the lessons of experience and\r\nrefusing to tread in the footsteps which our fathers have trodden? And\r\nfor what cause would we endanger our glorious Union? The Missouri\r\ncompromise contains a prohibition of slavery throughout all that vast\r\nregion extending twelve and a half degrees along the Pacific, from the\r\nparallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes to that of 49 degrees, and east from\r\nthat ocean to and beyond the summit of the Rocky Mountains. Why, then,\r\nshould our institutions be endangered because it is proposed to submit\r\nto the people of the remainder of our newly acquired territory lying\r\nsouth of 36 degrees 30 minutes, embracing less than four degrees of\r\nlatitude, the question whether, in the language of the Texas compromise,\r\nthey \"shall be admitted [as a State] into the Union with or without\r\nslavery.\" Is this a question to be pushed to such extremities by excited\r\npartisans on the one side or the other, in regard to our newly acquired\r\ndistant possessions on the Pacific, as to endanger the Union of thirty\r\nglorious States, which constitute our Confederacy? I have an abiding\r\nconfidence that the sober reflection and sound patriotism of the people\r\nof all the States will bring them to the conclusion that the dictate of\r\nwisdom is to follow the example of those who have gone before us, and\r\nsettle this dangerous question on the Missouri compromise, or some other\r\nequitable compromise which would respect the rights of all and prove\r\nsatisfactory to the different portions of the Union.\r\n\r\nHolding as a sacred trust the Executive authority for the whole Union,\r\nand bound to guard the rights of all, I should be constrained by a sense\r\nof duty to withhold my official sanction from any measure which would\r\nconflict with these important objects.\r\n\r\nI can not more appropriately close this message than by quoting from the\r\nFarewell Address of the Father of his Country. His warning voice can\r\nnever be heard in vain by the American people. If the spirit of prophecy\r\nhad distinctly presented to his view more than a half century ago the\r\npresent distracted condition of his country, the language which he then\r\nemployed could not have been more appropriate than it is to the present\r\noccasion. He declared:\r\n\r\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now\r\n  dear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the edifice of\r\n  your real independence, the support of your tranquillity at home, your\r\n  peace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty\r\n  which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from\r\n  different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken,\r\n  many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this\r\n  truth, as this is the point in your political fortress against which the\r\n  batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and\r\n  actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of\r\n  infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of\r\n  your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that\r\n  you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it;\r\n  accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of\r\n  your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with\r\n  jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion\r\n  that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the\r\n  first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country\r\n  from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the\r\n  various parts.\r\n\r\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens\r\n  by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to\r\n  concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to\r\n  you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of\r\n  patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.\r\n  With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners,\r\n  habits, and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and\r\n  triumphed together. The independence and liberty you possess are the\r\n  work of joint councils and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings,\r\n  and successes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  With such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts\r\n  of our country, while experience shall not have demonstrated its\r\n  impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the\r\n  patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its\r\n  bands.\r\n\r\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as\r\n  matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for\r\n  characterizing parties by _geographical_ discriminations--_Northern_ and\r\n  _Southern_, _Atlantic_ and _Western_--whence designing men may endeavor\r\n  to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests\r\n  and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within\r\n  particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other\r\n  districts. You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies\r\n  and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend\r\n  to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by\r\n  fraternal affection.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Pocket veto.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 15, 1847_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the last session of Congress a bill entitled \"An act\r\nto provide for continuing certain works in the Territory of Wisconsin,\r\nand for other purposes,\" which had passed both Houses, was presented to\r\nme for my approval. I entertained insuperable objections to its becoming\r\na law, but the short period of the session which remained afforded me no\r\nsufficient opportunity to prepare my objections and communicate them\r\nwith the bill to the House of Representatives, in which it originated.\r\nFor this reason the bill was retained, and I deem it proper now to state\r\nmy objections to it.\r\n\r\nAlthough from the title of the bill it would seem that its main object\r\nwas to make provision for continuing certain works already commenced in\r\nthe Territory of Wisconsin, it appears on examination of its provisions\r\nthat it contains only a single appropriation of $6,000 to be applied\r\nwithin that Territory, while it appropriates more than half a million of\r\ndollars for the improvement of numerous harbors and rivers lying within,\r\nthe limits and jurisdiction of several of the States of the Union.\r\n\r\nAt the preceding session of Congress it became my duty to return with my\r\nobjections to the House in which it originated a bill making similar\r\nappropriations and involving like principles, and the views then\r\nexpressed remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which this heavy expenditure of public money was\r\nproposed were of imposing weight in determining upon its expediency.\r\nCongress had recognized the existence of war with Mexico, and to\r\nprosecute it to \"a speedy and successful termination\" had made\r\nappropriations exceeding our ordinary revenues. To meet the emergency\r\nand provide for the expenses of the Government, a loan of $23,000,000\r\nwas authorized at the same session, which has since been negotiated. The\r\npractical effect of this bill, had it become a law, would have been to\r\nadd the whole amount appropriated by it to the national debt. It would,\r\nin fact, have made necessary an additional loan to that amount as\r\neffectually as if in terms it had required the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto borrow the money therein appropriated. The main question in that\r\naspect is whether it is wise, while all the means and credit of the\r\nGovernment are needed to bring the existing war to an honorable close,\r\nto impair the one and endanger the other by borrowing money to be\r\nexpended in a system of internal improvements capable of an expansion\r\nsufficient to swallow up the revenues not only of our own country, but\r\nof the civilized world? It is to be apprehended that by entering upon\r\nsuch a career at this moment confidence at home and abroad in the wisdom\r\nand prudence of the Government would be so far impaired as to make it\r\ndifficult, without an immediate resort to heavy taxation, to maintain\r\nthe public credit and to preserve the honor of the nation and the glory\r\nof our arms in prosecuting the existing war to a successful conclusion.\r\nHad this bill become a law, it is easy to foresee that largely increased\r\ndemands upon the Treasury would have been made at each succeeding\r\nsession of Congress for the improvements of numerous other harbors,\r\nbays, inlets, and rivers of equal importance with those embraced by its\r\nprovisions. Many millions would probably have been added to the\r\nnecessary amount of the war debt, the annual interest on which must also\r\nhave been borrowed, and finally a permanent national debt been fastened\r\non the country and entailed on posterity.\r\n\r\nThe policy of embarking the Federal Government in a general system of\r\ninternal improvements had its origin but little more than twenty years\r\nago. In a very few years the applications to Congress for appropriations\r\nin furtherance of such objects exceeded $200,000,000. In this alarming\r\ncrisis President Jackson refused to approve and sign the Maysville road\r\nbill, the Wabash River bill, and other bills of similar character. His\r\ninterposition put a check upon the new policy of throwing the cost of\r\nlocal improvements upon the National Treasury, preserved the revenues of\r\nthe nation for their legitimate objects, by which he was enabled to\r\nextinguish the then existing public debt and to present to an admiring\r\nworld the unprecedented spectacle in modern times of a nation free from\r\ndebt and advancing to greatness with unequaled strides under a\r\nGovernment which was content to act within its appropriate sphere in\r\nprotecting the States and individuals in their own chosen career of\r\nimprovement and of enterprise. Although the bill under consideration\r\nproposes no appropriation ior a road or canal, it is not easy to\r\nperceive the difference in principle or mischievous tendency between\r\nappropriations for making roads and digging canals and appropriations to\r\ndeepen rivers and improve harbors. All are alike within the limits and\r\njurisdiction of the States, and rivers and harbors alone open an abyss\r\nof expenditure sufficient to swallow up the wealth of the nation and\r\nload it with a debt which may fetter its energies and tax its industry\r\nfor ages to come.\r\n\r\nThe experience of several of the States, as well as that of the United\r\nStates, during the period that Congress exercised the power of\r\nappropriating the public money for internal improvements is full of\r\neloquent warnings. It seems impossible, in the nature of the subject, as\r\nconnected with local representation, that the several objects presented\r\nfor improvement shall be weighed according to their respective merits\r\nand appropriations confined to those whose importance would justify a\r\ntax on the whole community to effect their accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIn some of the States systems of internal improvements have been\r\nprojected, consisting of roads and canals, many of which, taken\r\nseparately, were not of sufficient public importance to justify a tax on\r\nthe entire population of the State to effect their construction, and yet\r\nby a combination of local interests, operating on a majority of the\r\nlegislature, the whole have been authorized and the States plunged into\r\nheavy debts. To an extent so ruinous has this system of legislation been\r\ncarried in some portions of the Union that the people have found it\r\nnecessary to their own safety and prosperity to forbid their\r\nlegislatures, by constitutional restrictions, to contract public debts\r\nfor such purposes without their immediate consent.\r\n\r\nIf the abuse of power has been so fatal in the States, where the systems\r\nof taxation are direct and the representatives responsible at short\r\nperiods to small masses of constituents, how much greater danger of\r\nabuse is to be apprehended in the General Government, whose revenues are\r\nraised by indirect taxation and whose functionaries are responsible to\r\nthe people in larger masses and for longer terms.\r\n\r\nRegarding only objects of improvement of the nature of those embraced in\r\nthis bill, how inexhaustible we shall find them. Let the imagination run\r\nalong our coast from the river St. Croix to the Rio Grande and trace\r\nevery river emptying into the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico to its source;\r\nlet it coast along our lakes and ascend all their tributaries; let it\r\npass to Oregon and explore all its bays, inlets, and streams; and then\r\nlet it raise the curtain of the future and contemplate the extent of\r\nthis Republic and the objects of improvement it will embrace as it\r\nadvances to its high destiny, and the mind will be startled at the\r\nimmensity and danger of the power which the principle of this bill\r\ninvolves.\r\n\r\nAlready our Confederacy consists of twenty-nine States. Other States may\r\nat no distant period be expected to be formed on the west of our present\r\nsettlements. We own an extensive country in Oregon, stretching many\r\nhundreds of miles from east to west and seven degrees of latitude from\r\nsouth to north. By the admission of Texas into the Union we have\r\nrecently added many hundreds of miles to our seacoast. In all this vast\r\ncountry, bordering on the Atlantic and Pacific, there are many thousands\r\nof bays, inlets, and rivers equally entitled to appropriations for their\r\nimprovement with the objects embraced in this bill.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in our States that the interests of individuals or\r\nneighborhoods, combining against the general interest, have involved\r\ntheir governments in debts and bankruptcy; and when the system prevailed\r\nin the General Government, and was checked by President Jackson, it had\r\nbegun to be considered the highest merit in a member of Congress to be\r\nable to procure appropriations of public money to be expended within his\r\ndistrict or State, whatever might be the object. We should be blind to\r\nthe experience of the past if we did not see abundant evidences that if\r\nthis system of expenditure is to be indulged in combinations of\r\nindividual and local interests will be found strong enough to control\r\nlegislation, absorb the revenues of the country, and plunge the\r\nGovernment into a hopeless indebtedness.\r\n\r\nWhat is denominated a harbor by this system does not necessarily mean a\r\nbay, inlet, or arm of the sea on the ocean or on our lake shores, on the\r\nmargin of which may exist a commercial city or town engaged in foreign\r\nor domestic trade, but is made to embrace waters, where there is not\r\nonly no such city or town, but no commerce of any kind. By it a bay or\r\nsheet of shoal water is called a _harbor_, and appropriations demanded\r\nfrom Congress to deepen it with a View to draw commerce to it or to\r\nenable individuals to build up a town or city on its margin upon\r\nspeculation and for their own private advantage.\r\n\r\nWhat is denominated a river which may be improved in the system is\r\nequally undefined in its meaning. It may be the Mississippi or it may be\r\nthe smallest and most obscure and unimportant stream bearing the name of\r\nriver which is to be found in any State in the Union.\r\n\r\nSuch a system is subject, moreover, to be perverted to the\r\naccomplishment of the worst of political purposes. During the few years\r\nit was in full operation, and which immediately preceded the veto of\r\nPresident Jackson of the Maysville road bill, instances were numerous of\r\npublic men seeking to gain popular favor by holding out to the people\r\ninterested in particular localities the promise of large disbursements\r\nof public money. Numerous reconnoissances and surveys were made during\r\nthat period for roads and canals through many parts of the Union, and\r\nthe people in the vicinity of each were led to believe that their\r\nproperty would be enhanced in value and they themselves be enriched by\r\nthe large expenditures which they were promised by the advocates of the\r\nsystem should be made from the Federal Treasury in their neighborhood.\r\nWhole sections of the country were thus sought to be influenced, and the\r\nsystem was fast becoming one not only of profuse and wasteful\r\nexpenditure, but a potent political engine.\r\n\r\nIf the power to improve a harbor be admitted, it is not easy to perceive\r\nhow the power to deepen every inlet on the ocean or the lakes and make\r\nharbors where there are none can be denied. If the power to clear out or\r\ndeepen the channel of rivers near their mouths be admitted, it is not\r\neasy to perceive how the power to improve them to their fountain head\r\nand make them navigable to their sources can be denied. Where shall the\r\nexercise of the power, if it be assumed, stop? Has Congress the power\r\nwhen an inlet is deep enough to admit a schooner to deepen it still\r\nmore, so that it will admit ships of heavy burden, and has it not the\r\npower when an inlet will admit a boat to make it deep enough to admit a\r\nschooner? May it improve rivers deep enough already to float ships and\r\nsteamboats, and has it no power to improve those which are navigable\r\nonly for flatboats and barges? May the General Government exercise power\r\nand jurisdiction over the soil of a State consisting of rocks and sand\r\nbars in the beds of its rivers, and may it not excavate a canal around\r\nits waterfalls or across its lands for precisely the same object?\r\n\r\nGiving to the subject the most serious and candid consideration of which\r\nmy mind is capable, I can not perceive any intermediate grounds. The\r\npower to improve harbors and rivers for purposes of navigation, by\r\ndeepening or clearing out, by dams and sluices, by locking or canalling,\r\nmust be admitted without any other limitation than the discretion of\r\nCongress, or it must be denied altogether. If it be admitted, how broad\r\nand how susceptible of enormous abuses is the power thus vested in the\r\nGeneral Government! There is not an inlet of the ocean or the Lakes, not\r\na river, creek, or streamlet within the States, which is not brought for\r\nthis purpose within the power and jurisdiction of the General\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nSpeculation, disguised under the cloak of public good, will call on\r\nCongress to deepen shallow inlets, that it may build up new cities on\r\ntheir shores, or to make streams navigable which nature has closed by\r\nbars and rapids, that it may sell at a profit its lands upon their\r\nbanks. To enrich neighborhoods by spending within them the moneys of the\r\nnation will be the aim and boast of those who prize their local\r\ninterests above the good of the nation, and millions upon millions will\r\nbe abstracted by tariffs and taxes from the earnings of the whole people\r\nto foster speculation and subserve the objects of private ambition.\r\n\r\nSuch a system could not be administered with any approach to equality\r\namong the several States and sections of the Union. There is no equality\r\namong them in the objects of expenditure, and if the funds were\r\ndistributed according to the merits of those objects some would be\r\nenriched at the expense of their neighbors. But a greater practical evil\r\nwould be found in the art and industry by which appropriations would be\r\nsought and obtained. The most artful and industrious would be the most\r\nsuccessful. The true interests of the country would be lost sight of in\r\nan annual scramble for the contents of the Treasury, and the Member of\r\nCongress who could procure the largest appropriations to be expended in\r\nhis district would claim the reward of victory from his enriched\r\nconstituents. The necessary consequence would be sectional discontents\r\nand heartburnings, increased taxation, and a national debt never to be\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIn view of these portentous consequences, I can not but think that this\r\ncourse of legislation should be arrested, even were there nothing to\r\nforbid it in the fundamental laws of our Union. This conclusion is\r\nfortified by the fact that the Constitution itself indicates a process\r\nby which harbors and rivers within the States may be improved--a process\r\nnot susceptible of the abuses necessarily to flow from the assumption of\r\nthe power to improve them by the General Government, just in its\r\noperation, and actually practiced upon, without complaint or\r\ninterruption, during more than thirty years from the organization of the\r\npresent Government.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that \"no State shall, without the consent of\r\nCongress, lay any duty of tonnage.\" With the \"consent\" of Congress, such\r\nduties may be levied, collected, and expended by the States. We are not\r\nleft in the dark as to the objects of this reservation of power to the\r\nStates. The subject was fully considered by the Convention that framed\r\nthe Constitution. It appears in Mr. Madison's report of the proceedings\r\nof that body that one object of the reservation was that the States\r\nshould not be restrained from laying duties of tonnage for the purpose\r\nof clearing harbors. Other objects were named in the debates, and among\r\nthem the support of seamen. Mr. Madison, treating on this subject in the\r\nFederalist, declares that--\r\n\r\n  The restraint on the power of the States over imports and exports is\r\n  enforced by all the arguments which prove the necessity of submitting\r\n  the regulation of trade to the Federal councils. It is needless,\r\n  therefore, to remark further on this head than that the manner in which\r\n  the restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to\r\n  the States a reasonable discretion in providing for the conveniency of\r\n  their imports and exports, and to the United States a reasonable check\r\n  against the abuse of this discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe States may lay tonnage duties for clearing harbors, improving\r\nrivers, or for other purposes, but are restrained from abusing the\r\npower, because before such duties can take effect the \"consent\" of\r\nCongress must be obtained. Here is a safe provision for the improvement\r\nof harbors and rivers in the reserved powers of the States and in the\r\naid they may derive from duties of tonnage levied with the consent of\r\nCongress. Its safeguards are, that both the State legislatures and\r\nCongress have to concur in the act of raising the funds; that they are\r\nin every instance to be levied upon the commerce of those ports which\r\nare to profit by the proposed improvement; that no question of\r\nconflicting power or jurisdiction is involved; that the expenditure,\r\nbeing in the hands of those who are to pay the money and be immediately\r\nbenefited, will be more carefully managed and more productive of good\r\nthan if the funds were drawn from the National Treasury and disbursed by\r\nthe officers of the General Government; that such a system will carry\r\nwith it no enlargement of Federal power and patronage, and leave the\r\nStates to be the sole judges of their own wants and interests, with only\r\na conservative negative in Congress upon any abuse of the power which\r\nthe States may attempt.\r\n\r\nUnder this wise system the improvement of harbors and rivers was\r\ncommenced, or rather continued, from the organization of the Government\r\nunder the present Constitution. Many acts were passed by the several\r\nStates levying duties of tonnage, and many were passed by Congress\r\ngiving their consent to those acts. Such acts have been passed by\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, and have been sanctioned by the\r\nconsent of Congress. Without enumerating them all, it may be instructive\r\nto refer to some of them, as illustrative of the mode of improving\r\nharbors and rivers in the early periods of our Government, as to the\r\nconstitutionality of which there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1790, the State of Rhode Island passed a law levying a\r\ntonnage duty on vessels arriving in the port of Providence, \"for the\r\npurpose of clearing and deepening the channel of Providence River and\r\nmaking the same more navigable.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of February, 1798, the State of Massachusetts passed a law\r\nlevying a tonnage duty on all vessels, whether employed in the foreign\r\nor coasting trade, which might enter into the Kennebunk River, for the\r\nimprovement of the same by \"rendering the passage in and out of said\r\nriver less difficult and dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of April, 1805, the State of Pennsylvania passed a law\r\nlevying a tonnage duty on vessels, \"to remove the obstructions to the\r\nnavigation of the river Delaware below the city of Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of January, 1804, the State of Virginia passed a law levying\r\na tonnage duty on vessels, \"for improving the navigation of James\r\nRiver.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of February, 1826, the State of Virginia passed a law levying\r\na tonnage duty on vessels, \"for improving the navigation of James River\r\nfrom Warwick to Rocketts landing.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of December, 1824, the State of Virginia passed a law levying\r\na tonnage duty on vessels, \"for improving the navigation of Appomattox\r\nRiver from Pocahontas Bridge to Broadway.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, 1821, the State of North Carolina passed a law levying a\r\ntonnage duty on vessels, \"for the purpose of opening an inlet at the\r\nlower end of Albemarle Sound, near a place called Nags Head, and\r\nimproving the navigation of said sound, with its branches;\" and in\r\nNovember, 1828, an amendatory law was passed.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of December, 1804, the State of South Carolina passed a law\r\nlevying a tonnage duty, for the purpose of \"building a marine hospital\r\nin the vicinity of Charleston,\" and on the 17th of December, 1816,\r\nanother law was passed by the legislature of that State for the\r\n\"maintenance of a marine hospital.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of February, 1787, the State of Georgia passed a law levying\r\na tonnage duty on all vessels entering into the port of Savannah, for\r\nthe purpose of \"clearing\" the Savannah River of \"wrecks and other\r\nobstructions\" to the navigation.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December, 1804, the State of Georgia passed a law levying\r\na tonnage duty on vessels, \"to be applied to the payment of the fees of\r\nthe harbor master and health officer of the ports of Savannah and St.\r\nMarys.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1783, the State of Maryland passed a law laying a tonnage duty\r\non vessels, for the improvement of the \"basin\" and \"harbor\" of Baltimore\r\nand the \"river Patapsco.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of December, 1791, the State of Maryland passed a law\r\nlevying a tonnage duty on vessels, for the improvement of the \"harbor\r\nand port of Baltimore.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of December, 1793, the State of Maryland passed a law\r\nauthorizing the appointment of a health officer for the port of\r\nBaltimore, and laying a tonnage duty on vessels to defray the expenses.\r\n\r\nCongress has passed many acts giving its \"consent\" to these and other\r\nState laws, the first of which is dated in 1790 and the last in 1843. By\r\nthe latter act the \"consent\" of Congress was given to the law of the\r\nlegislature of the State of Maryland laying a tonnage duty on vessels\r\nfor the improvement of the harbor of Baltimore, and continuing it in\r\nforce until the 1st day of June, 1850. I transmit herewith copies of\r\nsuch of the acts of the legislatures of the States on the subject, and\r\nalso the acts of Congress giving its \"consent\" thereto, as have been\r\ncollated.\r\n\r\nThat the power was constitutionally and rightfully exercised in these\r\ncases does not admit of a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe injustice and inequality resulting from conceding the power to both\r\nGovernments is illustrated by several of the acts enumerated. Take that\r\nfor the improvement of the harbor of Baltimore. That improvement is paid\r\nfor exclusively by a tax on the commerce of that city, but if an\r\nappropriation be made from the National Treasury for the improvement of\r\nthe harbor of Boston it must be paid in part out of taxes levied on the\r\ncommerce of Baltimore. The result is that the commerce of Baltimore pays\r\nthe full cost of the harbor improvement designed for its own benefit,\r\nand in addition contributes to the cost of all other harbor and river\r\nimprovements in the Union. The facts need but be stated to prove the\r\ninequality and injustice which can not but flow from the practice\r\nembodied in this bill. Either the subject should be left as it was\r\nduring the first third of a century, or the practice of levying tonnage\r\nduties by the States should be abandoned altogether and all harbor and\r\nriver improvements made under the authority of the United States, and by\r\nmeans of direct appropriations. In view not only of the constitutional\r\ndifficulty, but as a question of policy, I am clearly of opinion that\r\nthe whole subject should be left to the States, aided by such tonnage\r\nduties on vessels navigating their waters as their respective\r\nlegislatures may think proper to propose and Congress see fit to\r\nsanction. This \"consent\" of Congress would never be refused in any case\r\nwhere the duty proposed to be levied by the State was reasonable and\r\nwhere the object of improvement was one of importance. The funds\r\nrequired for the improvement of harbors and rivers may be raised in this\r\nmode, as was done in the earlier periods of the Government, and thus\r\navoid a resort to a strained construction of the Constitution not\r\nwarranted by its letter. If direct appropriations be made of the money\r\nin the Federal Treasury for such purposes, the expenditures will be\r\nunequal and unjust. The money in the Federal Treasury is paid by a tax\r\non the whole people of the United States, and if applied to the purposes\r\nof improving harbors and rivers it will be partially distributed and be\r\nexpended for the advantage of particular States, sections, or localities\r\nat the expense of others.\r\n\r\nBy returning to the early and approved construction of the Constitution\r\nand to the practice under it this inequality and injustice will be\r\navoided and at the same time all the really important improvements be\r\nmade, and, as our experience has proved, be better made and at less cost\r\nthan they would be by the agency of officers of the United States. The\r\ninterests benefited by these improvements, too, would bear the cost\r\nof making them, upon the same principle that the expenses of the\r\nPost-Office establishment have always been defrayed by those who derive\r\nbenefits from it. The power of appropriating money from the Treasury for\r\nsuch improvements was not claimed or exercised for more than thirty\r\nyears after the organization of the Government in 1789, when a more\r\nlatitudinous construction was indicated, though it was not broadly\r\nasserted and exercised until 1825. Small appropriations were first made\r\nin 1820 and 1821 for surveys. An act was passed on the 3d of March,\r\n1823, authorizing the President to \"cause an examination and survey to\r\nbe made of the obstructions between the harbor of Gloucester and the\r\nharbor of Squam, in the State of Massachusetts,\" and of \"the entrance of\r\nthe harbor of the port of Presque Isle, in Pennsylvania,\" with a view to\r\ntheir removal, and a small appropriation was made to pay the necessary\r\nexpenses. This appears to have been the commencement of harbor\r\nimprovements by Congress, thirty-four years after the Government went\r\ninto operation under the present Constitution. On the 30th of April,\r\n1824, an act was passed making an appropriation of $30,000, and\r\ndirecting \"surveys and estimates to be made of the routes of such roads\r\nand canals\" as the President \"may deem of national importance in a\r\ncommercial or military point of view or necessary for the transportation\r\nof the mails.\" This act evidently looked to the adoption of a general\r\nsystem of internal improvements, to embrace roads and canals as well\r\nas harbors and rivers. On the 26th May, 1824, an act was passed making\r\nappropriations for \"deepening the channel leading into the harbor of\r\nPresque Isle, in the State of Pennsylvania,\" and to \"repair Plymouth\r\nBeach, in the State of Massachusetts, and thereby prevent the harbor\r\nat that place from being destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe yielded his approval to these measures, though he\r\nentertained, and had, in a message to the House of Representatives on\r\nthe 4th of May, 1822, expressed, the opinion that the Constitution had\r\nnot conferred upon Congress the power to \"adopt and execute a system of\r\ninternal improvements.\" He placed his approval upon the ground, not that\r\nCongress possessed the power to \"adopt and execute\" such a system by\r\nvirtue of any or all of the enumerated grants of power in the\r\nConstitution, but upon the assumption that the power to make\r\nappropriations of the public money was limited and restrained only by\r\nthe discretion of Congress. In coming to this conclusion he avowed that\r\n\"in the more early stage of the Government\" he had entertained a\r\ndifferent opinion. He avowed that his first opinion had been that \"as\r\nthe National Government is a Government of limited powers, it has no\r\nright to expend money except in the performance of acts authorized by\r\nthe other specific grants, according to a strict construction of their\r\npowers,\" and that the power to make appropriations gave to Congress no\r\ndiscretionary authority to apply the public money to any other purposes\r\nor objects except to \"carry into effect the powers contained in the\r\nother grants.\" These sound views, which Mr. Monroe entertained \"in the\r\nearly stage of the Government,\" he gave up in 1822, and declared that--\r\n\r\n  The right of appropriation is nothing more than a right to apply the\r\n  public money to this or that purpose. It has no incidental power, nor\r\n  does it draw after it any consequences of that kind. All that Congress\r\n  could do under it in the case of internal improvements would be to\r\n  appropriate the money necessary to make them. For every act requiring\r\n  legislative sanction or support the State authority must be relied on.\r\n  The condemnation of the land, if the proprietors should refuse to sell\r\n  it, the establishment of tumpikes and tolls, and the protection of the\r\n  work when finished must be done by the State. To these purposes the\r\n  powers of the General Government are believed to be utterly incompetent.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to conceive on what principle the power of\r\nappropriating public money when in the Treasury can be construed to\r\nextend to objects for which the Constitution does not authorize Congress\r\nto levy taxes or imposts to raise money. The power of appropriation is\r\nbut the consequence of the power to raise money; and the true inquiry is\r\nwhether Congress has the right to levy taxes for the object over which\r\npower is claimed.\r\n\r\nDuring the four succeeding years embraced by the Administration of\r\nPresident Adams the power not only to appropriate money, but to apply\r\nit, under the direction and authority of the General Government, as well\r\nto the construction of roads as to the improvement of harbors and\r\nrivers, was fully asserted and exercised.\r\n\r\nAmong other acts assuming the power was one passed on the 20th of May,\r\n1826, entitled \"An act for improving certain harbors and the navigation\r\nof certain rivers and creeks, and for authorizing surveys to be made of\r\ncertain bays, sounds, and rivers therein mentioned.\" By that act large\r\nappropriations were made, which were to be \"applied, under the direction\r\nof the President of the United States,\" to numerous improvements\r\nin ten of the States. This act, passed thirty-seven years after\r\nthe organisation of the present Government, contained the first\r\nappropriation ever made for the improvement of a navigable river,\r\nunless it be small appropriations for examinations and surveys in 1820.\r\nDuring the residue of that Administration many other appropriations of\r\na similar character were made, embracing roads, rivers, harbors, and\r\ncanals, and objects claiming the aid of Congress multiplied without\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThis was the first breach effected in the barrier which the universal\r\nopinion of the framers of the Constitution had for more than thirty\r\nyears thrown in the way of the assumption of this power by Congress.\r\nThe general mind of Congress and the country did not appreciate the\r\ndistinction taken by President Monroe between the right to appropriate\r\nmoney for an object and the right to apply and expend it without the\r\nembarrassment and delay of applications to the State governments.\r\nProbably no instance occurred in which such an application was made, and\r\nthe flood gates being thus hoisted the principle laid down by him was\r\ndisregarded, and applications for aid from the Treasury, virtually to\r\nmake harbors as well as improve them, clear out rivers, cut canals, and\r\nconstruct roads, poured into Congress in torrents until arrested by the\r\nveto of President Jackson. His veto of the Maysville road bill was\r\nfollowed up by his refusal to sign the \"Act making appropriations for\r\nbuilding light-houses, light-boats, beacons, and monuments, placing\r\nbuoys, improving harbors, and directing surveys;\" \"An act authorizing\r\nsubscriptions for stock in the Louisville and Portland Canal Company;\"\r\n\"An act for the improvement of certain harbors and the navigation of\r\ncertain rivers;\" and, finally, \"An act to improve the navigation of\r\nthe Wabash River.\" In his objections to the act last named he says:\r\n\r\n  The desire to embark the Federal Government in works of internal\r\n  improvement prevailed in the highest degree during the first session of\r\n  the first Congress that I had the honor to meet in my present situation.\r\n  When the bill authorizing a subscription on the part of the United\r\n  States for stock in the Maysville and Lexington Tumpike Company passed\r\n  the two Houses, there had been reported by the Committees of Internal\r\n  Improvements bills containing appropriations for such objects, inclusive\r\n  of those for the Cumberland road and for harbors and light-houses, to\r\n  the amount of $106,000,000. In this amount was included authority to\r\n  the Secretary of the Treasury to subscribe for the stock of different\r\n  companies to a great extent, and the residue was principally for the\r\n  direct construction of roads by this Government, in addition to these\r\n  projects, which had been presented to the two Houses under the sanction\r\n  and recommendation of their respective Committees on Internal\r\n  Improvements, there were then still pending before the committees and in\r\n  memorials to Congress presented but not referred different projects for\r\n  works of a similar character, the expense of which can not be estimated\r\n  with certainty, but must have exceeded $100,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, within the brief period of less than ten years after the\r\ncommencement of internal improvements by the General Government the sum\r\nasked for from the Treasury for various projects amounted to more than\r\n$200,000,000. President Jackson's powerful and disinterested appeals to\r\nhis country appear to have put down forever the assumption of power to\r\nmake roads and cut canals, and to have checked the prevalent disposition\r\nto bring all rivers in any degree navigable within the control of the\r\nGeneral Government. But an immense field for expending the public money\r\nand increasing the power and patronage of this Government was left open\r\nin the concession of even a limited power of Congress to improve harbors\r\nand rivers--a field which millions will not fertilize to the\r\nsatisfaction of those local and speculating interests by which these\r\nprojects are in general gotten up. There can not be a just and equal\r\ndistribution of public burdens and benefits under such a system, nor can\r\nthe States be relieved from the danger of fatal encroachment, nor the\r\nUnited States from the equal danger of consolidation, otherwise than by\r\nan arrest of the system and a return to the doctrines and practices\r\nwhich prevailed during the first thirty years of the Government.\r\n\r\nHow forcibly does the history of this subject illustrate the tendency of\r\npower to concentration in the hands of the General Government. The power\r\nto improve their own harbors and rivers was clearly reserved to the\r\nStates, who were to be aided by tonnage duties levied and collected by\r\nthemselves, with the consent of Congress. For thirty-four years\r\nimprovements were carried on under that system, and so careful was\r\nCongress not to interfere, under any implied power, with the soil or\r\njurisdiction of the States that they did not even assume the power to\r\nerect lighthouses or build piers without first purchasing the ground,\r\nwith the consent of the States, and obtaining jurisdiction over it.\r\nAt length, after the lapse of thirty-three years, an act is passed\r\nproviding for the examination of certain obstructions at the mouth of\r\none or two harbors almost unknown. It is followed by acts making small\r\nappropriations for the removal of those obstructions. The obstacles\r\ninterposed by President Monroe, after conceding the power to\r\nappropriate, were soon swept away. Congress virtually assumed\r\njurisdiction of the soil and waters of the States, without their\r\nconsent, for the purposes of internal improvement, and the eyes of eager\r\nmillions were turned from the State governments to Congress as the\r\nfountain whose golden streams were to deepen their harbors and rivers,\r\nlevel their mountains, and fill their valleys with canals. To what\r\nconsequences this assumption of power was rapidly leading is shown by\r\nthe veto messages of President Jackson, and to what end it is again\r\ntending is witnessed by the provisions of this bill and bills of similar\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn the proceedings and debates of the General Convention which formed\r\nthe Constitution and of the State conventions which adopted it nothing\r\nis found to countenance the idea that the one intended to propose or the\r\nothers to concede such a grant of power to the General Government as the\r\nbuilding up and maintaining of a system of internal improvements within\r\nthe States necessarily implies. Whatever the General Government may\r\nconstitutionally create, it may lawfully protect. If it may make a road\r\nupon the soil of the States, it may protect it from destruction or\r\ninjury by penal laws. So of canals, rivers, and harbors. If it may put\r\na dam in a river, it may protect that dam from removal or injury, in\r\ndirect opposition to the laws, authorities, and people of the State in\r\nwhich it is situated. If it may deepen a harbor, it may by its own laws\r\nprotect its agents, and contractors from being driven from their work\r\neven by the laws and authorities of the State. The power to make a road\r\nor canal or to dig up the bottom of a harbor or river implies a right in\r\nthe soil of the State and a jurisdiction over it, for which it would be\r\nimpossible to find any warrant.\r\n\r\nThe States were particularly jealous of conceding to the General\r\nGovernment any right of jurisdiction over their soil, and in the\r\nConstitution restricted the exclusive legislation of Congress to such\r\nplaces as might be \"purchased with the consent of the States in which\r\nthe same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, dockyards, and\r\nother needful buildings.\" That the United States should be prohibited\r\nfrom purchasing lands within the States without their consent, even for\r\nthe most essential purposes of national defense, while left at liberty\r\nto purchase or seize them for roads, canals, and other improvements of\r\nimmeasurably less importance, is not to be conceived.\r\n\r\nA proposition was made in the Convention to provide for the appointment\r\nof a \"Secretary of Domestic Affairs,\" and make it his duty, among other\r\nthings, \"to attend to the opening of roads and navigation and the\r\nfacilitating communications through the United States.\" It was referred\r\nto a committee, and that appears to have been the last of it. On a\r\nsubsequent occasion a proposition was made to confer on Congress the\r\npower to \"provide for the cutting of canals when deemed necessary,\"\r\nwhich was rejected by the strong majority of eight States to three.\r\nAmong the reasons given for the rejection of this proposition, it was\r\nurged that \"the expense in such cases will fall on the United States\r\nand the benefits accrue to the places where the canals may be cut.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the consideration of this proposition a motion was made to\r\nenlarge the proposed power for \"cutting canals\" into a power \"to grant\r\ncharters of incorporation when the interest of the United States might\r\nrequire and the legislative provisions of the individual States may be\r\nincompetent;\" and the reason assigned by Mr. Madison for the proposed\r\nenlargement of the power was that it would \"secure an easy communication\r\nbetween the States, which the free intercourse now to be opened seemed\r\nto call for. The political obstacles being removed, a removal of the\r\nnatural ones, as far as possible, ought to follow.\"\r\n\r\nThe original proposition and all the amendments were rejected, after\r\ndeliberate discussion, not on the ground, as so much of that discussion\r\nas has been preserved indicates, that no direct grant was necessary,\r\nbut because it was deemed inexpedient to grant it at all. When it is\r\nconsidered that some of the members of the Convention, who afterwards\r\nparticipated in the organization and administration of the Government,\r\nadvocated and practiced upon a very liberal construction of the\r\nConstitution, grasping at many high powers as implied in its various\r\nprovisions, not one of them, it is believed, at that day claimed the\r\npower to make roads and canals, or improve rivers and harbors, or\r\nappropriate money for that purpose. Among our early statesmen of the\r\nstrict-construction class the opinion was universal, when the subject\r\nwas first broached, that Congress did not possess the power, although\r\nsome of them thought it desirable.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson, in his message to Congress in 1806, recommended an\r\namendment of the Constitution, with a view to apply an anticipated\r\nsurplus in the Treasury \"to the great purposes of the public education,\r\nroads, rivers, canals, and such other objects of public improvement as\r\nit may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of\r\nFederal powers.\" And he adds:\r\n\r\n  I suppose an amendment to the Constitution, by consent of the States,\r\n  necessary, because the objects now recommended are not among those\r\n  enumerated in the Constitution, and to which it permits the public\r\n  moneys to be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1825 he repeated, in his published letters, the opinion that no such\r\npower has been conferred upon Congress.\r\n\r\nPresident Madison, in a message to the House of Representatives of the\r\n3d of March, 1817, assigning his objections to a bill entitled \"An act\r\nto set apart and pledge certain funds for internal improvements,\"\r\ndeclares that--\r\n\r\n  \"The power to regulate commerce among the several States\" can not\r\n  include a power to construct roads and canals and to _improve the\r\n  navigation of water courses_ in order to facilitate, promote, and\r\n  secure such a commerce without a latitude of construction departing\r\n  from the ordinary import of the terms, strengthened by the known\r\n  inconveniences which doubtless led to the grant of this remedial\r\n  power to Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe, in a message to the House of Representatives of the\r\n4th of May, 1822, containing his objections to a bill entitled \"An act\r\nfor the preservation and repair of the Cumberland road,\" declares:\r\n\r\n  Commerce between independent powers or communities is universally\r\n  regulated by duties and imposts. It was so regulated by the States\r\n  before the adoption of this Constitution, equally in respect to each\r\n  other and to foreign powers. The goods and vessels employed in the trade\r\n  are the only subjects of regulation. It can act on none other. A power,\r\n  then, to impose such duties and imposts in regard to foreign nations\r\n  and to prevent any on the trade between the States was the only power\r\n  granted.\r\n\r\n  If we recur to the causes which produced the adoption of this\r\n  Constitution, we shall find that injuries resulting from the regulation\r\n  of trade by the States respectively and the advantages anticipated from\r\n  the transfer of the power to Congress were among those which had the\r\n  most weight. Instead of acting as a nation in regard to foreign powers,\r\n  the States individually had commenced a system of restraint on each\r\n  other whereby the interests of foreign powers were promoted at their\r\n  expense. If one State imposed high duties on the goods or vessels of a\r\n  foreign power to countervail the regulations of such power, the next\r\n  adjoining States imposed lighter duties to invite those articles into\r\n  their ports, that they might be transferred thence into the other\r\n  States, securing the duties to themselves. This contracted policy in\r\n  some of the States was soon counteracted by others. Restraints were\r\n  immediately laid on such commerce by the suffering States; and thus had\r\n  grown up a state of affairs disorderly and unnatural, the tendency of\r\n  which was to destroy the Union itself and with it all hope of realizing\r\n  those blessings which we had anticipated from the glorious Revolution\r\n  which had been so recently achieved. From this deplorable dilemma, or,\r\n  rather, certain ruin, we were happily rescued by the adoption of the\r\n  Constitution.\r\n\r\n  Among the first and most important effects of this great Revolution\r\n  was the complete abolition of this pernicious policy. The States\r\n  were brought together by the Constitution, as to commerce, into one\r\n  community, equally in regard to foreign nations and each other. The\r\n  regulations that were adopted regarded us in both respects as one\r\n  people. The duties and imposts that were laid on the vessels and\r\n  merchandise of foreign nations were all uniform throughout the United\r\n  States, and in the intercourse between the States themselves no duties\r\n  of any kind were imposed other than between different ports and\r\n  counties within the same State.\r\n\r\n  This view is supported by a series of measures, all of a marked\r\n  character, preceding the adoption of the Constitution. As early as the\r\n  year 1781 Congress recommended it to the States to vest in the United\r\n  States a power to levy a duty of 5 per cent on all goods imported from\r\n  foreign countries into the United States for the term of fifteen years.\r\n  In 1783 this recommendation, with alterations as to the kind of duties\r\n  and an extension of this term to twenty-five years, was repeated and\r\n  more earnestly urged. In 1784 it was recommended to the States to\r\n  authorize Congress to prohibit, under certain modifications, the\r\n  importation of goods from foreign powers into the United States for\r\n  fifteen years. In 1785 the consideration of the subject was resumed,\r\n  and a proposition presented in a new form, with an address to the\r\n  States explaining fully the principles on which a grant of the power to\r\n  regulate trade was deemed indispensable. In 1786 a meeting took place\r\n  at Annapolis of delegates from several of the States on this subject,\r\n  and on their report a convention was formed at Philadelphia the ensuing\r\n  year from all the States, to whose deliberations we are indebted for\r\n  the present Constitution.\r\n\r\n  In none of these measures was the subject of internal improvement\r\n  mentioned or even glanced at. Those of 1784, 1785, 1786, and 1787,\r\n  leading step by step to the adoption of the Constitution, had in view\r\n  only the obtaining of a power to enable Congress to regulate trade with\r\n  foreign powers. It is manifest that the regulation of trade with the\r\n  several States was altogether a secondary object, suggested by and\r\n  adopted in connection with the other. If the power necessary to this\r\n  system of improvement is included under either branch of this grant,\r\n  I should suppose that it was the first rather than the second. The\r\n  pretension to it, however, under that branch has never been set up.\r\n  In support of the claim under the second no reason has been assigned\r\n  which appears to have the least weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief history of the origin, progress, and consequences of\r\na system which for more than thirty years after the adoption of the\r\nConstitution was unknown. The greatest embarrassment upon the subject\r\nconsists in the departure which has taken place from the early\r\nconstruction of the Constitution and the precedents which are found in\r\nthe legislation of Congress in later years. President Jackson, in his\r\nveto of the Wabash River bill, declares that \"to inherent embarrassments\r\nhave been added others resulting from the course of our legislation\r\nconcerning it.\" In his vetoes on the Maysville road bill, the Rockville\r\nroad bill, the Wabash River bill, and other bills of like character he\r\nreversed the precedents which existed prior to that time on the subject\r\nof internal improvements. When our experience, observation, and\r\nreflection have convinced us that a legislative precedent is either\r\nunwise or unconstitutional, it should not be followed.\r\n\r\nNo express grant of this power is found in the Constitution. Its\r\nadvocates have differed among themselves as to the source from which it\r\nis derived as an incident. In the progress of the discussions upon this\r\nsubject the power to regulate commerce seems now to be chiefly relied\r\nupon, especially in reference to the improvement of harbors and rivers.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the regulation of commerce, the language of the grant in\r\nthe Constitution is:\r\n\r\n  Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,\r\n  and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat to \"regulate commerce\" does not mean to make a road, or dig a\r\ncanal, or clear out a river, or deepen a harbor would seem to be obvious\r\nto the common understanding. To \"regulate\" admits or affirms the\r\npreexistence of the thing to be regulated. In this case it presupposes\r\nthe existence of commerce, and, of course, the means by which and the\r\nchannels through which commerce is carried on. It confers no creative\r\npower; it only assumes control over that which may have been brought\r\ninto existence through other agencies, such as State legislation and the\r\nindustry and enterprise of individuals. If the definition of the word\r\n\"regulate\" is to include the provision of means to carry on commerce,\r\nthen have Congress not only power to deepen harbors, clear out rivers,\r\ndig canals, and make roads, but also to build ships, railroad cars, and\r\nother vehicles, all of which are necessary to commerce. There is no\r\nmiddle ground. If the power to regulate can be legitimately construed\r\ninto a power to create or facilitate, then not only the bays and\r\nharbors, but the roads and canals and all the means of transporting\r\nmerchandise among the several States, are put at the disposition of\r\nCongress. This power to regulate commerce was construed and exercised\r\nimmediately after the adoption of the Constitution, and has been\r\nexercised to the present day, by prescribing general rules by which\r\ncommerce should be conducted. With foreign nations it has been regulated\r\nby treaties defining the rights of citizens and subjects, as well as by\r\nacts of Congress imposing duties and restrictions embracing vessels,\r\nseamen, cargoes, and passengers. It has been regulated among the States\r\nby acts of Congress relating to the coasting trade and the vessels\r\nemployed therein, and for the better security of passengers in vessels\r\npropelled by steam, and by the removal of all restrictions upon internal\r\ntrade. It has been regulated, with the Indian tribes by our intercourse\r\nlaws, prescribing the manner in which it shall be carried on. Thus each\r\nbranch of this grant of power was exercised soon after the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution, and has continued to be exercised to the present day.\r\nIf a more extended construction be adopted, it is impossible for the\r\nhuman mind to fix on a limit to the exercise of the power other than the\r\nwill and discretion of Congress. It sweeps into the vortex of national\r\npower and jurisdiction not only harbors and inlets, rivers and little\r\nstreams, but canals, turnpikes, and railroads--every species of\r\nimprovement which can facilitate or create trade and intercourse \"with\r\nforeign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian\r\ntribes.\"\r\n\r\nShould any great object of improvement exist in our widely extended\r\ncountry which can not be effected by means of tonnage duties levied by\r\nthe States with the concurrence of Congress, it is safer and wiser to\r\napply to the States in the mode prescribed by the Constitution for an\r\namendment of that instrument whereby the powers of the General\r\nGovernment may be enlarged, with such limitations and restrictions as\r\nexperience has shown to be proper, than to assume and exercise a power\r\nwhich has not been granted, or which may be regarded as doubtful in the\r\nopinion of a large portion of our constituents. This course has been\r\nrecommended successively by Presidents Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and\r\nJackson, and I fully concur with them in opinion. If an enlargement of\r\npower should be deemed proper, it will unquestionably be granted by the\r\nStates; if otherwise, it will be withheld; and in either case their\r\ndecision should be final. In the meantime I deem it proper to add that\r\nthe investigation of this subject has impressed me more strongly than\r\never with the solemn conviction that the usefulness and permanency of\r\nthis Government and the happiness of the millions over whom it spreads\r\nits protection will be best promoted by carefully abstaining from the\r\nexercise of all powers not clearly granted by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas a treaty of peace, friendship, limits, and settlement between\r\nthe United States of America and the Mexican Republic was concluded and\r\nsigned at the city of Guadalupe Hidalgo on the 2d day of February, 1848,\r\nwhich treaty, as amended by the Senate of the United States, and being\r\nin the English and Spanish languages, is word for word as follows:\r\n\r\n[Here follows the treaty.]\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the said treaty, as amended, has been duly ratified on both\r\nparts, and the respective ratifications of the same were exchanged at\r\nQueretaro on the 30th day of May last by Ambrose H. Sevier and Nathan\r\nClifford, commissioners on the part of the Government of the United\r\nStates, and by Señor Don Luis de la Rosa, minister of relations of the\r\nMexican Republic, on the part of that Government:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, James K. Polk, President of the\r\nUnited States of America, have caused the said treaty to be made public,\r\nto the end that the same and every clause and article thereof may be\r\nobserved and fulfilled with good faith by the United States and the\r\ncitizens thereof.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 4th day of July, 1848, and of the\r\nIndependence of the United States the seventy-third.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JAMES BUCHANAN,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 9.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, Adjutant-General's Office,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 24, 1848_.\r\n\r\nI. The following orders of the President of the United States and\r\nSecretary of War announce to the Army the death of the illustrious\r\nex-President John Quincy Adams:\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 24, 1848_.\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Divine Providence to call hence a great and patriotic\r\ncitizen. John Quincy Adams is no more. At the advanced age of more than\r\nfourscore years, he was suddenly stricken from his seat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives by the hand of disease on the 21st, and expired in the\r\nCapitol a few minutes after 7 o'clock on the evening of the 23d of\r\nFebruary, 1848.\r\n\r\nHe had for more than half a century filled the most important public\r\nstations, and among them that of President of the United States. The\r\ntwo Houses of Congress, of one of which he was a venerable and most\r\ndistinguished member, will doubtless prescribe appropriate ceremonies to\r\nbe observed as a mark of respect for the memory of this eminent citizen.\r\n\r\nThe nation mourns his loss; and as a further testimony of respect for\r\nhis memory I direct that all the executive offices at Washington be\r\nplaced in mourning and that all business be suspended during this day\r\nand to-morrow.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _February 24, 1848_.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States with deep regret announces to the\r\nArmy the death of John Quincy Adams, our eminent and venerated\r\nfellow-citizen.\r\n\r\nWhile occupying his seat as a member of the House of Representatives, on\r\nthe 21st instant he was suddenly prostrated by disease, and on the 23d\r\nexpired, without having been removed from the Capitol. He had filled\r\nmany honorable and responsible stations in the service of his country,\r\nand among them that of President of the United States; and he closed his\r\nlong and eventful life in the actual discharge of his duties as one of\r\nthe Representatives of the people.\r\n\r\nFrom sympathy with his relatives and the American people for his loss\r\nand from respect for his distinguished public services, the President\r\norders that funeral honors shall be paid to his memory at each of the\r\nmilitary stations.\r\n\r\nThe Adjutant-General will give the necessary instructions for carrying\r\ninto effect the foregoing orders.\r\n\r\nW.L. MARCY,\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. On the day succeeding the arrival of this general order at each\r\nmilitary post the troops will be paraded at 10 o'clock a.m. and the\r\norder read to them, after which all labors for the day will cease.\r\n\r\nThe national flag will be displayed at half-staff.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of day thirteen guns will be fired, and afterwards, at intervals\r\nof thirty minutes between the rising and setting sun, a single gun, and\r\nat the close of the day a national salute of twenty-nine guns.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Army will wear crape on the left arm and on their\r\nswords and the colors of the several regiments will be put in mourning\r\nfor the period of six months.\r\n\r\nBy order:\r\n\r\nR. JONES,\r\n  _Adjutant-General._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nUnder the benignant providence of Almighty God the representatives of\r\nthe States and of the people are again brought together to deliberate\r\nfor the public good. The gratitude of the nation to the Sovereign\r\nArbiter of All Human Events should be commensurate with the boundless\r\nblessings which we enjoy.\r\n\r\nPeace, plenty, and contentment reign throughout our borders, and our\r\nbeloved country presents a sublime moral spectacle to the world.\r\n\r\nThe troubled and unsettled condition of some of the principal European\r\npowers has had a necessary tendency to check and embarrass trade and to\r\ndepress prices throughout all commercial nations, but notwithstanding\r\nthese causes, the United States, with their abundant products, have felt\r\ntheir effects less severely than any other country, and all our great\r\ninterests are still prosperous and successful.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the great events of the past year and contrasting the\r\nagitated and disturbed state of other countries with our own tranquil\r\nand happy condition, we may congratulate ourselves that we are the most\r\nfavored people on the face of the earth. While the people of other\r\ncountries are struggling to establish free institutions, under which man\r\nmay govern himself, we are in the actual enjoyment of them--a rich\r\ninheritance from our fathers. While enlightened nations of Europe are\r\nconvulsed and distracted by civil war or intestine strife, we settle all\r\nour political controversies by the peaceful exercise of the rights of\r\nfreemen at the ballot box.\r\n\r\nThe great republican maxim, so deeply engraven on the hearts of our\r\npeople, that the will of the majority, constitutionally expressed, shall\r\nprevail, is our sure safeguard against force and violence. It is a\r\nsubject of just pride that our fame and character as a nation continue\r\nrapidly to advance in the estimation of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nTo our wise and free institutions it is to be attributed that while\r\nother nations have achieved glory at the price of the suffering,\r\ndistress, and impoverishment of their people, we have won our honorable\r\nposition in the midst of an uninterrupted prosperity and of an\r\nincreasing individual comfort and happiness.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that our relations with all nations are\r\nfriendly and pacific. Advantageous treaties of commerce have been\r\nconcluded within the last four years with New Granada, Peru, the Two\r\nSicilies, Belgium, Hanover, Oldenburg, and Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\r\nPursuing our example, the restrictive system of Great Britain, our\r\nprincipal foreign customer, has been relaxed, a more liberal commercial\r\npolicy has been adopted by other enlightened nations, and our trade has\r\nbeen greatly enlarged and extended. Our country stands higher in the\r\nrespect of the world than at any former period. To continue to occupy\r\nthis proud position, it is only necessary to preserve peace and\r\nfaithfully adhere to the great and fundamental principle of our foreign\r\npolicy of noninterference in the domestic concerns of other nations. We\r\nrecognize in all nations the right which we enjoy ourselves, to change\r\nand reform their political institutions according to their own will and\r\npleasure. Hence we do not look behind existing governments capable of\r\nmaintaining their own authority. We recognize all such actual\r\ngovernments, not only from the dictates of true policy, but from a\r\nsacred regard for the independence of nations. While this is our settled\r\npolicy, it does not follow that we can ever be indifferent spectators of\r\nthe progress of liberal principles. The Government and people of the\r\nUnited States hailed with enthusiasm and delight the establishment of\r\nthe French Republic, as we now hail the efforts in progress to unite the\r\nStates of Germany in a confederation similar in many respects to our own\r\nFederal Union. If the great and enlightened German States, occupying, as\r\nthey do, a central and commanding position in Europe, shall succeed in\r\nestablishing such a confederated government, securing at the same time\r\nto the citizens of each State local governments adapted to the peculiar\r\ncondition of each, with unrestricted trade and intercourse with each\r\nother, it will be an important era in the history of human events.\r\nWhilst it will consolidate and strengthen the power of Germany, it must\r\nessentially promote the cause of peace, commerce, civilization, and\r\nconstitutional liberty throughout the world.\r\n\r\nWith all the Governments on this continent our relations, it is\r\nbelieved, are now on a more friendly and satisfactory footing than they\r\nhave ever been at any former period.\r\n\r\nSince the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace with Mexico\r\nour intercourse with the Government of that Republic has been of the\r\nmost friendly character. The envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States to Mexico has been received and\r\naccredited, and a diplomatic representative from Mexico of similar rank\r\nhas been received and accredited by this Government. The amicable\r\nrelations between the two countries, which had been suspended, have been\r\nhappily restored, and are destined, I trust, to be long preserved. The\r\ntwo Republics, both situated on this continent, and with coterminous\r\nterritories, have every motive of sympathy and of interest to bind them\r\ntogether in perpetual amity.\r\n\r\nThis gratifying condition of our foreign relations renders it\r\nunnecessary for me to call your attention more specifically to them.\r\n\r\nIt has been my constant aim and desire to cultivate peace and commerce\r\nwith all nations. Tranquillity at home and peaceful relations abroad\r\nconstitute the true permanent policy of our country. War, the scourge of\r\nnations, sometimes becomes inevitable, but is always to be avoided when\r\nit can be done consistently with the rights and honor of a nation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important results of the war into which we were recently\r\nforced with a neighboring nation is the demonstration it has afforded of\r\nthe military strength of our country. Before the late war with Mexico\r\nEuropean and other foreign powers entertained imperfect and erroneous\r\nviews of our physical strength as a nation and of our ability to\r\nprosecute war, and especially a war waged out of our own country. They\r\nsaw that our standing Army on the peace establishment did not exceed\r\n10,000 men. Accustomed themselves to maintain in peace large standing\r\narmies for the protection of thrones against their own subjects, as well\r\nas against foreign enemies, they had not conceived that it was possible\r\nfor a nation without such an army, well disciplined and of long service,\r\nto wage war successfully. They held in low repute our militia, and were\r\nfar from regarding them as an effective force, unless it might be for\r\ntemporary defensive operations when invaded on our own soil. The events\r\nof the late war with Mexico have not only undeceived them, but have\r\nremoved erroneous impressions which prevailed to some extent even among\r\na portion of our own countrymen. That war has demonstrated that upon the\r\nbreaking out of hostilities not anticipated, and for which no previous\r\npreparation had been made, a volunteer army of citizen soldiers equal to\r\nveteran troops, and in numbers equal to any emergency, can in a short\r\nperiod be brought into the field. Unlike what would have occurred in any\r\nother country, we were under no necessity of resorting to drafts or\r\nconscriptions. On the contrary, such was the number of volunteers who\r\npatriotically tendered their services that the chief difficulty was\r\nin making selections and determining who should be disappointed and\r\ncompelled to remain at home. Our citizen soldiers are unlike those\r\ndrawn from the population of any other country. They are composed\r\nindiscriminately of all professions and pursuits--of farmers, lawyers,\r\nphysicians, merchants, manufacturers, mechanics, and laborers--and this\r\nnot only among the officers, but the private soldiers in the ranks.\r\nOur citizen soldiers are unlike those of any other country in other\r\nrespects. They are armed, and have been accustomed from their youth up\r\nto handle and use firearms, and a large proportion of them, especially\r\nin the Western and more newly settled States, are expert marksmen. They\r\nare men who have a reputation to maintain at home by their good conduct\r\nin the field. They are intelligent, and there is an individuality of\r\ncharacter which is found in the ranks of no other army. In battle each\r\nprivate man, as well as every officer, fights not only for his country,\r\nbut for glory and distinction among his fellow-citizens when he shall\r\nreturn to civil life.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico has demonstrated not only the ability of the\r\nGovernment to organize a numerous army upon a sudden call, but also to\r\nprovide it with all the munitions and necessary supplies with dispatch,\r\nconvenience, and ease, and to direct its operations with efficiency. The\r\nstrength of our institutions has not only been displayed in the valor\r\nand skill of our troops engaged in active service in the field, but in\r\nthe organization of those executive branches which were charged with the\r\ngeneral direction and conduct of the war. While too great praise can not\r\nbe bestowed upon the officers and men who fought our battles, it would\r\nbe unjust to withhold from those officers necessarily stationed at home,\r\nwho were charged with the duty of furnishing the Army in proper time and\r\nat proper places with all the munitions of war and other supplies so\r\nnecessary to make it efficient, the commendation to which they are\r\nentitled. The credit due to this class of our officers is the greater\r\nwhen it is considered that no army in ancient or modern times was ever\r\nbetter appointed or provided than our Army in Mexico. Operating in an\r\nenemy's country, removed 2,000 miles from the seat of the Federal\r\nGovernment, its different corps spread over a vast extent of territory,\r\nhundreds and even thousands of miles apart from each other, nothing\r\nshort of the untiring vigilance and extraordinary energy of these\r\nofficers could have enabled them to provide the Army at all points and\r\nin proper season with all that was required for the most efficient\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIt is but an act of justice to declare that the officers in charge of\r\nthe several executive bureaus, all under the immediate eye and\r\nsupervision of the Secretary of War, performed their respective duties\r\nwith ability, energy, and efficiency. They have reaped less of the glory\r\nof the war, not having been personally exposed to its perils in battle,\r\nthan their companions in arms; but without their forecast, efficient\r\naid, and cooperation those in the field would not have been provided\r\nwith the ample means they possessed of achieving for themselves and\r\ntheir country the unfading honors which they have won for both.\r\n\r\nWhen all these facts are considered, it may cease to be a matter of so\r\nmuch amazement abroad how it happened that our noble Army in Mexico,\r\nregulars and volunteers, were victorious upon every battlefield, however\r\nfearful the odds against them.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico has thus fully developed the capacity of republican\r\ngovernments to prosecute successfully a just and necessary foreign war\r\nwith all the vigor usually attributed to more arbitrary forms of\r\ngovernment. It has been usual for writers on public law to impute to\r\nrepublics a want of that unity, concentration of purpose, and vigor of\r\nexecution which are generally admitted to belong to the monarchical and\r\naristocratic forms; and this feature of popular government has been\r\nsupposed to display itself more particularly in the conduct of a war\r\ncarried on in an enemy's territory. The war with Great Britain in 1812\r\nwas to a great extent confined within our own limits, and shed but\r\nlittle light on this subject; but the war which we have just closed by\r\nan honorable peace evinces beyond all doubt that a popular\r\nrepresentative government is equal to any emergency which is likely to\r\narise in the affairs of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe war with Mexico has developed most strikingly and conspicuously\r\nanother feature in our institutions. It is that without cost to the\r\nGovernment or danger to our liberties we have in the bosom of our\r\nsociety of freemen, available in a just and necessary war, virtually a\r\nstanding army of 2,000,000 armed citizen soldiers, such as fought the\r\nbattles of Mexico. But our military strength does not consist alone in\r\nour capacity for extended and successful operations on land. The Navy is\r\nan important arm of the national defense. If the services of the Navy\r\nwere not so brilliant as those of the Army in the late war with Mexico,\r\nit was because they had no enemy to meet on their own element. While the\r\nArmy had opportunity of performing more conspicuous service, the Navy\r\nlargely participated in the conduct of the war. Both branches of the\r\nservice performed their whole duty to the country. For the able and\r\ngallant services of the officers and men of the Navy, acting\r\nindependently as well as in cooperation with our troops, in the conquest\r\nof the Californias, the capture of Vera Cruz, and the seizure and\r\noccupation of other important positions on the Gulf and Pacific coasts,\r\nthe highest praise is due. Their vigilance, energy, and skill rendered\r\nthe most effective service in excluding munitions of war and other\r\nsupplies from the enemy, while they secured a safe entrance for abundant\r\nsupplies for our own Army. Our extended commerce was nowhere\r\ninterrupted, and for this immunity from the evils of war the country is\r\nindebted to the Navy.\r\n\r\nHigh praise is due to the officers of the several executive bureaus,\r\nnavy-yards, and stations connected with the service, all under the\r\nimmediate direction of the Secretary of the Navy, for the industry,\r\nforesight, and energy with which everything was directed and furnished\r\nto give efficiency to that branch of the service. The same vigilance\r\nexisted in directing the operations of the Navy as of the Army. There\r\nwas concert of action and of purpose between the heads of the two arms\r\nof the service. By the orders which were from time to time issued, our\r\nvessels of war on the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico were stationed in\r\nproper time and in proper positions to cooperate efficiently with the\r\nArmy. By this means their combined power was brought to bear\r\nsuccessfully on the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe great results which have been developed and brought to light by\r\nthis war will be of immeasurable importance in the future progress of\r\nour country. They will tend powerfully to preserve us from foreign\r\ncollisions, and to enable us to pursue uninterruptedly our cherished\r\npolicy of \"peace with all nations, entangling alliances with none.\"\r\n\r\nOccupying, as we do, a more commanding position among nations than at\r\nany former period, our duties and our responsibilities to ourselves\r\nand to posterity are correspondingly increased. This will be the more\r\nobvious when we consider the vast additions which have been recently\r\nmade to our territorial possessions and their great importance and\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nWithin less than four years the annexation of Texas to the Union has\r\nbeen consummated; all conflicting title to the Oregon Territory south of\r\nthe forty-ninth degree of north latitude, being all that was insisted on\r\nby any of my predecessors, has been adjusted, and New Mexico and Upper\r\nCalifornia have been acquired by treaty. The area of these several\r\nTerritories, according to a report carefully prepared by the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office from the most authentic\r\ninformation in his possession, and which is herewith transmitted,\r\ncontains 1,193,061 square miles, or 763,559,040 acres; while the area of\r\nthe remaining twenty-nine States and the territory not yet organized\r\ninto States east of the Rocky Mountains contains 2,059,513 square miles,\r\nor 1,318,126,058 acres. These estimates show that the territories\r\nrecently acquired, and over which our exclusive jurisdiction and\r\ndominion have been extended, constitute a country more than half as\r\nlarge as all that which was held by the United States before their\r\nacquisition. If Oregon be excluded from the estimate, there will still\r\nremain within the limits of Texas, New Mexico, and California 851,598\r\nsquare miles, or 545,012,720 acres, being an addition equal to more than\r\none-third of all the territory owned by the United States before their\r\nacquisition, and, including Oregon, nearly as great an extent of\r\nterritory as the whole of Europe, Russia only excepted. The Mississippi,\r\nso lately the frontier of our country, is now only its center. With the\r\naddition of the late acquisitions, the United States are now estimated\r\nto be nearly as large as the whole of Europe. It is estimated by the\r\nSuperintendent of the Coast Survey in the accompanying report that the\r\nextent of the seacoast of Texas on the Gulf of Mexico is upward of 400\r\nmiles; of the coast of Upper California on the Pacific, of 970 miles,\r\nand of Oregon, including the Straits of Fuca, of 650 miles, making the\r\nwhole extent of seacoast on the Pacific 1,620 miles and the whole extent\r\non both the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico 2,020 miles. The length of\r\nthe coast on the Atlantic from the northern limits of the United States\r\naround the capes of Florida to the Sabine, on the eastern boundary of\r\nTexas, is estimated to be 3,100 miles; so that the addition of seacoast,\r\nincluding Oregon, is very nearly two-thirds as great as all we possessed\r\nbefore, and, excluding Oregon, is an addition of 1,370 miles, being\r\nnearly equal to one-half of the extent of coast which we possessed\r\nbefore these acquisitions. We have now three great maritime fronts--on\r\nthe Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific--making in the whole\r\nan extent of seacoast exceeding 5,000 miles. This is the extent of the\r\nseacoast of the United States, not including bays, sounds, and small\r\nirregularities of the main shore and of the sea islands. If these be\r\nincluded, the length of the shore line of coast, as estimated by the\r\nSuperintendent of the Coast Survey in his report, would be 33,063 miles.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to calculate the value of these immense additions\r\nto our territorial possessions. Texas, lying contiguous to the western\r\nboundary of Louisiana, embracing within its limits a part of the\r\nnavigable tributary waters of the Mississippi and an extensive seacoast,\r\ncould not long have remained in the hands of a foreign power without\r\nendangering the peace of our southwestern frontier. Her products in the\r\nvicinity of the tributaries of the Mississippi must have sought a market\r\nthrough these streams, running into and through our territory, and the\r\ndanger of irritation and collision of interests between Texas as a\r\nforeign state and ourselves would have been imminent, while the\r\nembarrassments in the commercial intercourse between them must have been\r\nconstant and unavoidable. Had Texas fallen into the hands or under the\r\ninfluence and control of a strong maritime or military foreign power, as\r\nshe might have done, these dangers would have been still greater. They\r\nhave been avoided by her voluntary and peaceful annexation to the United\r\nStates. Texas, from her position, was a natural and almost indispensable\r\npart of our territories. Fortunately, she has been restored to our\r\ncountry, and now constitutes one of the States of our Confederacy, \"upon\r\nan equal footing with the original States.\" The salubrity of climate,\r\nthe fertility of soil, peculiarly adapted to the production of some of\r\nour most valuable staple commodities, and her commercial advantages must\r\nsoon make her one of our most populous States.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico, though situated in the interior and without a seacoast, is\r\nknown to contain much fertile land, to abound in rich mines of the\r\nprecious metals, and to be capable of sustaining a large population.\r\nFrom its position it is the intermediate and connecting territory\r\nbetween our settlements and our possessions in Texas and those on the\r\nPacific Coast.\r\n\r\nUpper California, irrespective of the vast mineral wealth recently\r\ndeveloped there, holds at this day, in point of value and importance,\r\nto the rest of the Union the same relation that Louisiana did when that\r\nfine territory was acquired from France forty-five years ago. Extending\r\nnearly ten degrees of latitude along the Pacific, and embracing the only\r\nsafe and commodious harbors on that coast for many hundred miles, with\r\na temperate climate and an extensive interior of fertile lands, it is\r\nscarcely possible to estimate its wealth until it shall be brought under\r\nthe government of our laws and its resources fully developed. From its\r\nposition it must command the rich commerce of China, of Asia, of the\r\nislands of the Pacific, of western Mexico, of Central America, the South\r\nAmerican States, and of the Russian possessions bordering on that ocean.\r\nA great emporium will doubtless speedily arise on the Californian coast\r\nwhich may be destined to rival in importance New Orleans itself. The\r\ndepot of the vast commerce which must exist on the Pacific will probably\r\nbe at some point on the Bay of San Francisco, and will occupy the same\r\nrelation to the whole western coast of that ocean as New Orleans does to\r\nthe valley of the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico. To this depot our\r\nnumerous whale ships will resort with their cargoes to trade, refit,\r\nand obtain supplies. This of itself will largely contribute to build\r\nup a city, which would soon become the center of a great and rapidly\r\nincreasing commerce. Situated on a safe harbor, sufficiently capacious\r\nfor all the navies as well as the marine of the world, and convenient to\r\nexcellent timber for shipbuilding, owned by the United States, it must\r\nbecome our great Western naval depot.\r\n\r\nIt was known that mines of the precious metals existed to a considerable\r\nextent in California at the time of its acquisition. Recent discoveries\r\nrender it probable that these mines are more extensive and valuable than\r\nwas anticipated. The accounts of the abundance of gold in that territory\r\nare of such an extraordinary character as would scarcely command belief\r\nwere they not corroborated by the authentic reports of officers in the\r\npublic service who have visited the mineral district and derived the\r\nfacts which they detail from personal observation. Reluctant to credit\r\nthe reports in general circulation as to the quantity of gold, the\r\nofficer commanding our forces in California visited the mineral district\r\nin July last for the purpose of obtaining accurate information on the\r\nsubject. His report to the War Department of the result of his\r\nexamination and the facts obtained on the spot is herewith laid before\r\nCongress. When he visited the country there were about 4,000 persons\r\nengaged in collecting gold. There is every reason to believe that the\r\nnumber of persons so employed has since been augmented. The explorations\r\nalready made warrant the belief that the supply is very large and that\r\ngold is found at various places in an extensive district of country.\r\n\r\nInformation received from officers of the Navy and other sources, though\r\nnot so full and minute, confirms the accounts of the commander of our\r\nmilitary force in California. It appears also from these reports that\r\nmines of quicksilver are found in the vicinity of the gold region. One\r\nof them is now being worked, and is believed to be among the most\r\nproductive in the world.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced by the discovery of these rich mineral deposits and\r\nthe success which has attended the labors of those who have resorted to\r\nthem have produced a surprising change in the state of affairs in\r\nCalifornia. Labor commands a most exorbitant price, and all other\r\npursuits but that of searching for the precious metals are abandoned.\r\nNearly the whole of the male population of the country have gone to the\r\ngold districts. Ships arriving on the coast are deserted by their crews\r\nand their voyages suspended for want of sailors. Our commanding officer\r\nthere entertains apprehensions that soldiers can not be kept in the\r\npublic service without a large increase of pay. Desertions in his\r\ncommand have become frequent, and he recommends that those who shall\r\nwithstand the strong temptation and remain faithful should be rewarded.\r\n\r\nThis abundance of gold and the all-engrossing pursuit of it have already\r\ncaused in California an unprecedented rise in the price of all the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThat we may the more speedily and fully avail ourselves of the\r\nundeveloped wealth of these mines, it is deemed of vast importance\r\nthat a branch of the Mint of the United States be authorized to be\r\nestablished at your present session in California. Among other signal\r\nadvantages which would result from such an establishment would be that\r\nof raising the gold to its par value in that territory. A branch mint of\r\nthe United States at the great commercial depot on the west coast would\r\nconvert into our own coin not only the gold derived from our own rich\r\nmines, but also the bullion and specie which our commerce may bring from\r\nthe whole west coast of Central and South America. The west coast of\r\nAmerica and the adjacent interior embrace the richest and best mines of\r\nMexico, New Granada, Central America, Chili, and Peru. The bullion and\r\nspecie drawn from these countries, and especially from those of western\r\nMexico and Peru, to an amount in value of many millions of dollars, are\r\nnow annually diverted and carried by the ships of Great Britain to her\r\nown ports, to be recoined or used to sustain her national bank, and thus\r\ncontribute to increase her ability to command so much of the commerce of\r\nthe world. If a branch mint be established at the great commercial point\r\nupon that coast, a vast amount of bullion and specie would flow thither\r\nto be recoined, and pass thence to New Orleans, New York, and other\r\nAtlantic cities. The amount of our constitutional currency at home would\r\nbe greatly increased, while its circulation abroad would be promoted. It\r\nis well known to our merchants trading to China and the west coast of\r\nAmerica that great inconvenience and loss are experienced from the fact\r\nthat our coins are not current at their par value in those countries.\r\n\r\nThe powers of Europe, far removed from the west coast of America by\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, which intervenes, and by a tedious and dangerous\r\nnavigation around the southern cape of the continent of America, can\r\nnever successfully compete with the United States in the rich and\r\nextensive commerce which is opened to us at so much less cost by the\r\nacquisition of California.\r\n\r\nThe vast importance and commercial advantages of California have\r\nheretofore remained undeveloped by the Government of the country of\r\nwhich it constituted a part. Now that this fine province is a part of\r\nour country, all the States of the Union, some more immediately and\r\ndirectly than others, are deeply interested in the speedy development of\r\nits wealth and resources. No section of our country is more interested\r\nor will be more benefited than the commercial, navigating, and\r\nmanufacturing interests of the Eastern States. Our planting and farming\r\ninterests in every part of the Union will be greatly benefited by it.\r\nAs our commerce and navigation are enlarged and extended, our exports of\r\nagricultural products and of manufactures will be increased, and in the\r\nnew markets thus opened they can not fail to command remunerating and\r\nprofitable prices.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of California and New Mexico, the settlement of the\r\nOregon boundary, and the annexation of Texas, extending to the Rio\r\nGrande, are results which, combined, are of greater consequence and will\r\nadd more to the strength and wealth of the nation than any which have\r\npreceded them since the adoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut to effect these great results not only California, but New Mexico,\r\nmust be brought under the control of regularly organized governments.\r\nThe existing condition of California and of that part of New Mexico\r\nlying west of the Rio Grande and without the limits of Texas imperiously\r\ndemands that Congress should at its present session organize Territorial\r\ngovernments over them.\r\n\r\nUpon the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace with Mexico,\r\non the 30th of May last, the temporary governments which had been\r\nestablished over New Mexico and California by our military and naval\r\ncommanders by virtue of the rights of war ceased to derive any\r\nobligatory force from that source of authority, and having been ceded\r\nto the United States, all government and control over them under the\r\nauthority of Mexico had ceased to exist. Impressed with the necessity\r\nof establishing Territorial governments over them, I recommended the\r\nsubject to the favorable consideration of Congress in my message\r\ncommunicating the ratified treaty of peace, on the 6th of July last, and\r\ninvoked their action at that session. Congress adjourned without making\r\nany provision for their government. The inhabitants by the transfer\r\nof their country had become entitled to the benefit of our laws and\r\nConstitution, and yet were left without any regularly organized\r\ngovernment. Since that time the very limited power possessed by the\r\nExecutive has been exercised to preserve and protect them from the\r\ninevitable consequences of a state of anarchy. The only government which\r\nremained was that established by the military authority during the war.\r\nRegarding this to be a _de facto_ government, and that by the presumed\r\nconsent of the inhabitants it might be continued temporarily, they were\r\nadvised to conform and submit to it for the short intervening period\r\nbefore Congress would again assemble and could legislate on the subject.\r\nThe views entertained by the Executive on this point are contained in a\r\ncommunication of the Secretary of State dated the 7th of October last,\r\nwhich was forwarded for publication to California and New Mexico,\r\na copy of which is herewith transmitted. The small military force of\r\nthe Regular Army which was serving within the limits of the acquired\r\nterritories at the close of the war was retained in them, and additional\r\nforces have been ordered there for the protection of the inhabitants and\r\nto preserve and secure the rights and interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nNo revenue has been or could be collected at the ports in California,\r\nbecause Congress failed to authorize the establishment of custom-houses\r\nor the appointment of officers for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, by a circular letter addressed to\r\ncollectors of the customs on the 7th day of October last, a copy of\r\nwhich is herewith transmitted, exercised all the power with which he\r\nwas invested by law.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act of the 14th of August last, extending the\r\nbenefit of our post-office laws to the people of California, the\r\nPostmaster-General has appointed two agents, who have proceeded, the\r\none to California and the other to Oregon, with authority to make the\r\nnecessary arrangements for carrying its provisions into effect.\r\n\r\nThe monthly line of mail steamers from Panama to Astoria has been\r\nrequired to \"stop and deliver and take mails at San Diego, Monterey, and\r\nSan Francisco.\" These mail steamers, connected by the Isthmus of Panama\r\nwith the line of mail steamers on the Atlantic between New York and\r\nChagres, will establish a regular mail communication with California.\r\n\r\nIt is our solemn duty to provide with the least practicable delay for\r\nNew Mexico and California regularly organized Territorial governments.\r\nThe causes of the failure to do this at the last session of Congress are\r\nwell known and deeply to be regretted. With the opening prospects of\r\nincreased prosperity and national greatness which the acquisition of\r\nthese rich and extensive territorial possessions affords, how irrational\r\nit would be to forego or to reject these advantages by the agitation of\r\na domestic question which is coeval with the existence of our Government\r\nitself, and to endanger by internal strifes, geographical divisions, and\r\nheated contests for political power, or for any other cause, the harmony\r\nof the glorious Union of our confederated States--that Union which binds\r\nus together as one people, and which for sixty years has been our shield\r\nand protection against every danger. In the eyes of the world and of\r\nposterity how trivial and insignificant will be all our internal\r\ndivisions and struggles compared with the preservation of this Union\r\nof the States in all its vigor and with all its countless blessings!\r\nNo patriot would foment and excite geographical and sectional divisions.\r\nNo lover of his country would deliberately calculate the value of the\r\nUnion. Future generations would look in amazement upon the folly of such\r\na course. Other nations at the present day would look upon it with\r\nastonishment, and such of them as desire to maintain and perpetuate\r\nthrones and monarchical or aristocratical principles will view it with\r\nexultation and delight, because in it they will see the elements of\r\nfaction, which they hope must ultimately overturn our system. Ours is\r\nthe great example of a prosperous and free self-governed republic,\r\ncommanding the admiration and the imitation of all the lovers of freedom\r\nthroughout the world. How solemn, therefore, is the duty, how impressive\r\nthe call upon us and upon all parts of our country, to cultivate a\r\npatriotic spirit of harmony, of good-fellowship, of compromise and\r\nmutual concession, in the administration of the incomparable system of\r\ngovernment formed by our fathers in the midst of almost insuperable\r\ndifficulties, and transmitted to us with the injunction that we should\r\nenjoy its blessings and hand it down unimpaired to those who may come\r\nafter us.\r\n\r\nIn view of the high and responsible duties which we owe to ourselves and\r\nto mankind, I trust you may be able at your present session to approach\r\nthe adjustment of the only domestic question which seriously threatens,\r\nor probably ever can threaten, to disturb the harmony and successful\r\noperations of our system.\r\n\r\nThe immensely valuable possessions of New Mexico and California are\r\nalready inhabited by a considerable population. Attracted by their great\r\nfertility, their mineral wealth, their commercial advantages, and the\r\nsalubrity of the climate, emigrants from the older States in great\r\nnumbers are already preparing to seek new homes in these inviting\r\nregions. Shall the dissimilarity of the domestic institutions in the\r\ndifferent States prevent us from providing for them suitable\r\ngovernments? These institutions existed at the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, but the obstacles which they interposed were overcome\r\nby that spirit of compromise which is now invoked. In a conflict of\r\nopinions or of interests, real or imaginary, between different sections\r\nof our country, neither can justly demand all which it might desire to\r\nobtain. Each, in the true spirit of our institutions, should concede\r\nsomething to the other.\r\n\r\nOur gallant forces in the Mexican war, by whose patriotism and\r\nunparalleled deeds of arms we obtained these possessions as an indemnity\r\nfor our just demands against Mexico, were composed of citizens who\r\nbelonged to no one State or section of our Union. They were men from\r\nslave-holding and nonslaveholding States, from the North and the South,\r\nfrom the East and the West. They were all companions in arms and\r\nfellow-citizens of the same common country, engaged in the same common\r\ncause. When prosecuting that war they were brethren and friends, and\r\nshared alike with each other common toils, dangers, and sufferings. Now,\r\nwhen their work is ended, when peace is restored, and they return again\r\nto their homes, put off the habiliments of war, take their places in\r\nsociety, and resume their pursuits in civil life, surely a spirit of\r\nharmony and concession and of equal regard for the rights of all and of\r\nall sections of the Union ought to prevail in providing governments for\r\nthe acquired territories--the fruits of their common service. The whole\r\npeople of the United States, and of every State, contributed to defray\r\nthe expenses of that war, and it would not be just for any one section\r\nto exclude another from all participation in the acquired territory.\r\nThis would not be in consonance with the just system of government which\r\nthe framers of the Constitution adopted.\r\n\r\nThe question is believed to be rather abstract than practical, whether\r\nslavery ever can or would exist in any portion of the acquired territory\r\neven if it were left to the option of the slaveholding States\r\nthemselves. From the nature of the climate and productions in much the\r\nlarger portion of it it is certain it could never exist, and in the\r\nremainder the probabilities are it would not. But however this may be,\r\nthe question, involving, as it does, a principle of equality of rights\r\nof the separate and several States as equal copartners in the\r\nConfederacy, should not be disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn organizing governments over these territories no duty imposed on\r\nCongress by the Constitution requires that they should legislate on the\r\nsubject of slavery, while their power to do so is not only seriously\r\nquestioned, but denied by many of the soundest expounders of that\r\ninstrument. Whether Congress shall legislate or not, the people of\r\nthe acquired territories, when assembled in convention to form State\r\nconstitutions, will possess the sole and exclusive power to determine\r\nfor themselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their\r\nlimits. If Congress shall abstain from interfering with the question,\r\nthe people of these territories will be left free to adjust it as they\r\nmay think proper when they apply for admission as States into the Union.\r\nNo enactment of Congress could restrain the people of any of the\r\nsovereign States of the Union, old or new, North or South, slaveholding\r\nor nonslaveholding, from determining the character of their own domestic\r\ninstitutions as they may deem wise and proper. Any and all the States\r\npossess this right, and Congress can not deprive them of it. The people\r\nof Georgia might if they chose so alter their constitution as to abolish\r\nslavery within its limits, and the people of Vermont might so alter\r\ntheir constitution as to admit slavery within its limits. Both States\r\nwould possess the right, though, as all know, it is not probable that\r\neither would exert it.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the peace and harmony of the Union that this\r\nquestion is in its nature temporary and can only continue for the brief\r\nperiod which will intervene before California and New Mexico may be\r\nadmitted as States into the Union. From the tide of population now\r\nflowing into them it is highly probable that this will soon occur.\r\n\r\nConsidering the several States and the citizens of the several States as\r\nequals and entitled to equal rights under the Constitution, if this were\r\nan original question it might well be insisted on that the principle of\r\nnoninterference is the true doctrine and that Congress could not, in the\r\nabsence of any express grant of power, interfere with their relative\r\nrights. Upon a great emergency, however, and under menacing dangers\r\nto the Union, the Missouri compromise line in respect to slavery was\r\nadopted. The same line was extended farther west in the acquisition of\r\nTexas. After an acquiescence of nearly thirty years in the principle of\r\ncompromise recognized and established by these acts, and to avoid the\r\ndanger to the Union which might follow if it were now disregarded,\r\nI have heretofore expressed the opinion that that line of compromise\r\nshould be extended on the parallel of 36° 30' from the western boundary\r\nof Texas, where it now terminates, to the Pacific Ocean. This is the\r\nmiddle ground of compromise, upon which the different sections of the\r\nUnion may meet, as they have heretofore met. If this be done, it is\r\nconfidently believed a large majority of the people of every section of\r\nthe country, however widely their abstract opinions on the subject of\r\nslavery may differ, would cheerfully and patriotically acquiesce in it,\r\nand peace and harmony would again fill our borders.\r\n\r\nThe restriction north of the line was only yielded to in the case of\r\nMissouri and Texas upon a principle of compromise, made necessary for\r\nthe sake of preserving the harmony and possibly the existence of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nIt was upon these considerations that at the close of your last session\r\nI gave my sanction to the principle of the Missouri compromise line by\r\napproving and signing the bill to establish \"the Territorial government\r\nof Oregon.\" From a sincere desire to preserve the harmony of the Union,\r\nand in deference for the acts of my predecessors, I felt constrained\r\nto yield my acquiescence to the extent to which they had gone in\r\ncompromising this delicate and dangerous question. But if Congress shall\r\nnow reverse the decision by which the Missouri compromise was effected,\r\nand shall propose to extend the restriction over the whole territory,\r\nsouth as well as north of the parallel of 36° 30', it will cease to be\r\na compromise, and must be regarded as an original question.\r\n\r\nIf Congress, instead of observing the course of noninterference, leaving\r\nthe adoption of their own domestic institutions to the people who may\r\ninhabit these territories, or if, instead of extending the Missouri\r\ncompromise line to the Pacific, shall prefer to submit the legal and\r\nconstitutional questions which may arise to the decision of the judicial\r\ntribunals, as was proposed in a bill which passed the Senate at your\r\nlast session, an adjustment may be effected in this mode. If the whole\r\nsubject be referred to the judiciary, all parts of the Union should\r\ncheerfully acquiesce in the final decision of the tribunal created by\r\nthe Constitution for the settlement of all questions which may arise\r\nunder the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nCongress is earnestly invoked, for the sake of the Union, its harmony,\r\nand our continued prosperity as a nation, to adjust at its present\r\nsession this, the only dangerous question which lies in our path, if\r\nnot in some one of the modes suggested, in some other which may be\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of the establishment of regular governments over the\r\nacquired territories, a joint commission of officers of the Army and\r\nNavy has been ordered to proceed to the coast of California and Oregon\r\nfor the purpose of making reconnoissances and a report as to the proper\r\nsites for the erection of fortifications or other defensive works on\r\nland and of suitable situations for naval stations. The information\r\nwhich may be expected from a scientific and skillful examination of the\r\nwhole face of the coast will be eminently useful to Congress when they\r\ncome to consider the propriety of making appropriations for these great\r\nnational objects. Proper defenses on land will be necessary for the\r\nsecurity and protection of our possessions, and the establishment of\r\nnavy-yards and a dock for the repair and construction of vessels will\r\nbe important alike to our Navy and commercial marine. Without such\r\nestablishments every vessel, whether of the Navy or of the merchant\r\nservice, requiring repair must at great expense come round Cape Horn to\r\none of our Atlantic yards for that purpose. With such establishments\r\nvessels, it is believed, may be built or repaired as cheaply in\r\nCalifornia as upon the Atlantic coast. They would give employment\r\nto many of our enterprising shipbuilders and mechanics and greatly\r\nfacilitate and enlarge our commerce in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAs it is ascertained that mines of gold, silver, copper, and quicksilver\r\nexist in New Mexico and California, and that nearly all the lands where\r\nthey are found belong to the United States, it is deemed important to\r\nthe public interest that provision be made for a geological and\r\nmineralogical examination of these regions. Measures should be adopted\r\nto preserve the mineral lands, especially such as contain the precious\r\nmetals, for the use of the United States, or, if brought into market, to\r\nseparate them from the farming lands and dispose of them in such manner\r\nas to secure a large return of money to the Treasury and at the same\r\ntime to lead to the development of their wealth by individual\r\nproprietors and purchasers. To do this it will be necessary to provide\r\nfor an immediate survey and location of the lots. If Congress should\r\ndeem it proper to dispose of the mineral lands, they should be sold in\r\nsmall quantities and at a fixed minimum price.\r\n\r\nI recommend that surveyors-general's offices be authorized to be\r\nestablished in New Mexico and California and provision made for\r\nsurveying and bringing the public lands into market at the earliest\r\npracticable period. In disposing of these lands, I recommend that the\r\nright of preemption be secured and liberal grants made to the early\r\nemigrants who have settled or may settle upon them.\r\n\r\nIt will be important to extend our revenue laws over these territories,\r\nand especially over California, at an early period. There is already a\r\nconsiderable commerce with California, and until ports of entry shall be\r\nestablished and collectors appointed no revenue can be received.\r\n\r\nIf these and other necessary and proper measures be adopted for the\r\ndevelopment of the wealth and resources of New Mexico and California and\r\nregular Territorial governments be established over them, such will\r\nprobably be the rapid enlargement of our commerce and navigation and\r\nsuch the addition to the national wealth that the present generation may\r\nlive to witness the controlling commercial and monetary power of the\r\nworld transferred from London and other European emporiums to the city\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions which were entertained by some of our statesmen in the\r\nearlier periods of the Government that our system was incapable of\r\noperating with sufficient energy and success over largely extended\r\nterritorial limits, and that if this were attempted it would fall to\r\npieces by its own weakness, have been dissipated by our experience. By\r\nthe division of power between the States and Federal Government the\r\nlatter is found to operate with as much energy in the extremes as in the\r\ncenter. It is as efficient in the remotest of the thirty States which\r\nnow compose the Union as it was in the thirteen States which formed our\r\nConstitution. Indeed, it may well be doubted whether if our present\r\npopulation had been confined within the limits of the original thirteen\r\nStates the tendencies to centralization and consolidation would not have\r\nbeen such as to have encroached upon the essential reserved rights of\r\nthe States, and thus to have made the Federal Government a widely\r\ndifferent one, practically, from what it is in theory and was intended\r\nto be by its framers. So far from entertaining apprehensions of the\r\nsafety of our system by the extension of our territory, the belief is\r\nconfidently entertained that each new State gives strength and an\r\nadditional guaranty for the preservation of the Union itself.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the provisions of the thirteenth article of the treaty\r\nof peace, friendship, limits, and settlement with the Republic of\r\nMexico, and of the act of July 29, 1848, claims of our citizens, which\r\nhad been \"already liquidated and decided, against the Mexican Republic\"\r\namounting, with the interest thereon, to $2,023,832.51 have been\r\nliquidated and paid. There remain to be paid of these claims $74,192.26.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session having made no provision for executing the\r\nfifteenth article of the treaty, by which the United States assume to\r\nmake satisfaction for the \"unliquidated claims\" of our citizens against\r\nMexico to \"an amount not exceeding three and a quarter millions of\r\ndollars,\" the subject is again recommended to your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of ratifications of the treaty with Mexico took place on\r\nthe 30th of May, 1848. Within one year after that time the commissioner\r\nand surveyor which each Government stipulates to appoint are required\r\nto meet \"at the port of San Diego and proceed to run and mark the said\r\nboundary in its whole course to the mouth of the Rio Bravo del Norte.\"\r\nIt will be seen from this provision that the period within which a\r\ncommissioner and surveyor of the respective Governments are to meet at\r\nSan Diego will expire on the 30th of May, 1849. Congress at the close of\r\nits last session made an appropriation for \"the expenses of running and\r\nmarking the boundary line\" between the two countries, but did not fix\r\nthe amount of salary which should be paid to the commissioner and\r\nsurveyor to be appointed on the part of the United States. It is\r\ndesirable that the amount of compensation which they shall receive\r\nshould be prescribed by law, and not left, as at present, to Executive\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nMeasures were adopted at the earliest practicable period to organize the\r\n\"Territorial government of Oregon,\" as authorized by the act of the 14th\r\nof August last. The governor and marshal of the Territory, accompanied\r\nby a small military escort, left the frontier of Missouri in September\r\nlast, and took the southern route, by the way of Santa Fe and the river\r\nGila, to California, with the intention of proceeding thence in one of\r\nour vessels of war to their destination. The governor was fully advised\r\nof the great importance of his early arrival in the country, and it is\r\nconfidently believed he may reach Oregon in the latter part of the\r\npresent month or early in the next. The other officers for the Territory\r\nhave proceeded by sea.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May last I communicated information to Congress that\r\nan Indian war had broken out in Oregon, and recommended that authority\r\nbe given to raise an adequate number of volunteers to proceed without\r\ndelay to the assistance of our fellow-citizens in that Territory. The\r\nauthority to raise such a force not having been granted by Congress,\r\nas soon as their services could be dispensed with in Mexico orders were\r\nissued to the regiment of mounted riflemen to proceed to Jefferson\r\nBarracks, in Missouri, and to prepare to march to Oregon as soon as\r\nthe necessary provision could be made. Shortly before it was ready to\r\nmarch it was arrested by the provision of the act passed by Congress\r\non the last day of the last session, which directed that all the\r\nnoncommissioned officers, musicians, and privates of that regiment who\r\nhad been in service in Mexico should, upon their application, be\r\nentitled to be discharged. The effect of this provision was to disband\r\nthe rank and file of the regiment, and before their places could be\r\nfilled by recruits the season had so far advanced that it was\r\nimpracticable for it to proceed until the opening of the next spring.\r\n\r\nIn the month of October last the accompanying communication was received\r\nfrom the governor of the temporary government of Oregon, giving\r\ninformation of the continuance of the Indian disturbances and of the\r\ndestitution and defenseless condition of the inhabitants. Orders were\r\nimmediately transmitted to the commander of our squadron in the Pacific\r\nto dispatch to their assistance a part of the naval forces on that\r\nstation, to furnish them with arms and ammunition, and to continue to\r\ngive them such aid and protection as the Navy could afford until the\r\nArmy could reach the country.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of humanity, and one which has always been pursued by\r\nthe United States, to cultivate the good will of the aboriginal tribes\r\nof this continent and to restrain them from making war and indulging in\r\nexcesses by mild means rather than by force. That this could have been\r\ndone with the tribes in Oregon had that Territory been brought under the\r\ngovernment of our laws at an earlier period, and had other suitable\r\nmeasures been adopted by Congress, such as now exist in our intercourse\r\nwith the other Indian tribes within our limits, can not be doubted.\r\nIndeed, the immediate and only cause of the existing hostility of the\r\nIndians of Oregon is represented to have been the long delay of the\r\nUnited States in making to them some trifling compensation, in such\r\narticles as they wanted, for the country now occupied by our emigrants,\r\nwhich the Indians claimed and over which they formerly roamed. This\r\ncompensation had been promised to them by the temporary government\r\nestablished in Oregon, but its fulfillment had been postponed from time\r\nto time for nearly two years, whilst those who made it had been\r\nanxiously waiting for Congress to establish a Territorial government\r\nover the country. The Indians became at length distrustful of their good\r\nfaith and sought redress by plunder and massacre, which finally led to\r\nthe present difficulties. A few thousand dollars in suitable presents,\r\nas a compensation for the country which had been taken possession of by\r\nour citizens, would have satisfied the Indians and have prevented the\r\nwar. A small amount properly distributed, it is confidently believed,\r\nwould soon restore quiet. In this Indian war our fellow-citizens of\r\nOregon have been compelled to take the field in their own defense, have\r\nperformed valuable military services, and been subjected to expenses\r\nwhich have fallen heavily upon them. Justice demands that provision\r\nshould be made by Congress to compensate them for their services and to\r\nrefund to them the necessary expenses which they have incurred.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation heretofore made to Congress, that provision\r\nbe made for the appointment of a suitable number of Indian agents to\r\nreside among the tribes of Oregon, and that a small sum be appropriated\r\nto enable these agents to cultivate friendly relations with them. If\r\nthis be done, the presence of a small military force will be all that is\r\nnecessary to keep them in check and preserve peace. I recommend that\r\nsimilar provisions be made as regards the tribes inhabiting northern\r\nTexas, New Mexico, California, and the extensive region lying between\r\nour settlements in Missouri and these possessions, as the most effective\r\nmeans of preserving peace upon our borders and within the recently\r\nacquired territories.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will present in his annual report a highly\r\nsatisfactory statement of the condition of the finances.\r\n\r\nThe imports for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were of\r\nthe value of $154,977,876, of which the amount exported was $21,128,010,\r\nleaving $133,849,866 in the country for domestic use. The value of the\r\nexports for the same period was $154,032,131, consisting of domestic\r\nproductions amounting to $132,904,121 and $21,128,010 of foreign\r\narticles. The receipts into the Treasury for the same period, exclusive\r\nof loans, amounted to $35,436,750.59, of which there was derived from\r\ncustoms $31,757,070.96, from sales of public lands $3,328,642.56, and\r\nfrom miscellaneous and incidental sources $351,037.07.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that the revenue from customs for the last fiscal\r\nyear exceeded by $757,070.96 the estimate of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury in his last annual report, and that the aggregate receipts\r\nduring the same period from customs, lands, and miscellaneous sources\r\nalso exceeded the estimate by the sum of $536,750.59, indicating,\r\nhowever, a very near approach in the estimate to the actual result.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last,\r\nincluding those for the war and exclusive of payments of principal and\r\ninterest for the public debt, were $42,811,970.03.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1849, including the balance in the Treasury\r\non the 1st of July last, will amount to the sum of $57,048,969.90, of\r\nwhich $32,000,000, it is estimated, will be derived from customs,\r\n$3,000,000 from the sales of the public lands, and $1,200,000 from\r\nmiscellaneous and incidental sources, including the premium upon the\r\nloan, and the amount paid and to be paid into the Treasury on account of\r\nmilitary contributions in Mexico, and the sales of arms and vessels and\r\nother public property rendered unnecessary for the use of the Government\r\nby the termination of the war, and $20,695,435.30 from loans already\r\nnegotiated, including Treasury notes funded, which, together with the\r\nbalance in the Treasury on the 1st of July last, make the sum estimated.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period, including the necessary payment on\r\naccount of the principal and interest of the public debt, and the\r\nprincipal and interest of the first installment due to Mexico on the\r\n30th of May next, and other expenditures growing out of the war to be\r\npaid during the present year, will amount, including the reimbursement\r\nof Treasury notes, to the sum of $54,195,275.06, leaving an estimated\r\nbalance in the Treasury on the 1st of July, 1849, of $2,853,694.84.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will present, as required by law, the\r\nestimate of the receipts and expenditures for the next fiscal year. The\r\nexpenditures as estimated for that year are $33,213,152.73, including\r\n$3,799,102.18 for the interest on the public debt and $3,540,000 for the\r\nprincipal and interest due to Mexico on the 30th of May, 1850, leaving\r\nthe sum of $25,874,050.35, which, it is believed, will be ample for the\r\nordinary peace expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the tariff act of 1846 have been such during the past\r\nyear as fully to meet the public expectation and to confirm the opinion\r\nheretofore expressed of the wisdom of the change in our revenue system\r\nwhich was effected by it. The receipts under it into the Treasury for\r\nthe first fiscal year after its enactment exceeded by the sum of\r\n$5,044,403.09 the amount collected during the last fiscal year under the\r\ntariff act of 1842, ending the 30th of June, 1846. The total revenue\r\nrealized from the commencement of its operation, on the 1st of December,\r\n1846, until the close of the last quarter, on the 30th of September\r\nlast, being twenty-two months, was $56,654,563.79, being a much larger\r\nsum than was ever before received from duties during any equal period\r\nunder the tariff acts of 1824, 1828, 1832, and 1842. Whilst by the\r\nrepeal of highly protective and prohibitory duties the revenue has been\r\nincreased, the taxes on the people have been diminished. They have been\r\nrelieved from the heavy amounts with which they were burthened under\r\nformer laws in the form of increased prices or bounties paid to favored\r\nclasses and pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe predictions which were made that the tariff act of 1846 would reduce\r\nthe amount of revenue below that collected under the act of 1842, and\r\nwould prostrate the business and destroy the prosperity of the country,\r\nhave not been verified. With an increased and increasing revenue, the\r\nfinances are in a highly flourishing condition. Agriculture, commerce,\r\nand navigation are prosperous; the prices of manufactured fabrics and of\r\nother products are much less injuriously affected than was to have been\r\nanticipated from the unprecedented revulsions which during the last and\r\nthe present year have overwhelmed the industry and paralyzed the credit\r\nand commerce of so many great and enlightened nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nSevere commercial revulsions abroad have always heretofore operated to\r\ndepress and often to affect disastrously almost every branch of American\r\nindustry. The temporary depression of a portion of our manufacturing\r\ninterests is the effect of foreign causes, and is far less severe than\r\nhas prevailed on all former similar occasions.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that, looking to the great aggregate of all our\r\ninterests, the whole country was never more prosperous than at the\r\npresent period, and never more rapidly advancing in wealth and\r\npopulation. Neither the foreign war in which we have been involved, nor\r\nthe loans which have absorbed so large a portion of our capital, nor the\r\ncommercial revulsion in Great Britain in 1847, nor the paralysis of\r\ncredit and commerce throughout Europe in 1848, have affected injuriously\r\nto any considerable extent any of the great interests of the country or\r\narrested our onward march to greatness, wealth, and power.\r\n\r\nHad the disturbances in Europe not occurred, our commerce would\r\nundoubtedly have been still more extended, and would have added still\r\nmore to the national wealth and public prosperity. But notwithstanding\r\nthese disturbances, the operations of the revenue system established\r\nby the tariff act of 1846 have been so generally beneficial to the\r\nGovernment and the business of the country that no change in its\r\nprovisions is demanded by a wise public policy, and none is recommended.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the constitutional treasury established by the act of\r\nthe 6th of August, 1846, in the receipt, custody, and disbursement of\r\nthe public money have continued to be successful. Under this system the\r\npublic finances have been carried through a foreign war, involving the\r\nnecessity of loans and extraordinary expenditures and requiring distant\r\ntransfers and disbursements, without embarrassment, and no loss has\r\noccurred of any of the public money deposited under its provisions.\r\nWhilst it has proved to be safe and useful to the Government, its\r\neffects have been most beneficial upon the business of the country. It\r\nhas tended powerfully to secure an exemption from that inflation and\r\nfluctuation of the paper currency so injurious to domestic industry\r\nand rendering so uncertain the rewards of labor, and, it is believed,\r\nhas largely contributed to preserve the whole country from a serious\r\ncommercial revulsion, such as often occurred under the bank deposit\r\nsystem. In the year 1847 there was a revulsion in the business of Great\r\nBritain of great extent and intensity, which was followed by failures\r\nin that Kingdom unprecedented in number and amount of losses. This is\r\nbelieved to be the first instance when such disastrous bankruptcies,\r\noccurring in a country with which we have such extensive commerce,\r\nproduced little or no injurious effect upon our trade or currency.\r\nWe remained but little affected in our money market, and our business\r\nand industry were still prosperous and progressive.\r\n\r\nDuring the present year nearly the whole continent of Europe has been\r\nconvulsed by civil war and revolutions, attended by numerous\r\nbankruptcies, by an unprecedented fall in their public securities, and\r\nan almost universal paralysis of commerce and industry; and yet,\r\nalthough our trade and the prices of our products must have been\r\nsomewhat unfavorably affected by these causes, we have escaped a\r\nrevulsion, our money market is comparatively easy, and public and\r\nprivate credit have advanced and improved.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently believed that we have been saved from their effect by\r\nthe salutary operation of the constitutional treasury. It is certain\r\nthat if the twenty-four millions of specie imported into the country\r\nduring the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1847, had gone into\r\nthe banks, as to a great extent it must have done, it would in the\r\nabsence of this system have been made the basis of augmented bank paper\r\nissues, probably to an amount not less than $60,000,000 or $70,000,000,\r\nproducing, as an inevitable consequence of an inflated currency,\r\nextravagant prices for a time and wild speculation, which must have been\r\nfollowed, on the reflux to Europe the succeeding year of so much of that\r\nspecie, by the prostration of the business of the country, the\r\nsuspension of the banks, and most extensive bankruptcies. Occurring, as\r\nthis would have done, at a period when the country was engaged in a\r\nforeign war, when considerable loans of specie were required for distant\r\ndisbursements, and when the banks, the fiscal agents of the Government\r\nand the depositories of its money, were suspended, the public credit\r\nmust have sunk, and many millions of dollars, as was the case during the\r\nWar of 1812, must have been sacrificed in discounts upon loans and upon\r\nthe depreciated paper currency which the Government would have been\r\ncompelled to use.\r\n\r\nUnder the operations of the constitutional treasury not a dollar has\r\nbeen lost by the depreciation of the currency. The loans required to\r\nprosecute the war with Mexico were negotiated by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury above par, realizing a large premium to the Government. The\r\nrestraining effect of the system upon the tendencies to excessive paper\r\nissues by banks has saved the Government from heavy losses and thousands\r\nof our business men from bankruptcy and ruin. The wisdom of the system\r\nhas been tested by the experience of the last two years, and it is\r\nthe dictate of sound policy that it should remain undisturbed. The\r\nmodifications in some of the details of this measure, involving none of\r\nits essential principles, heretofore recommended, are again presented\r\nfor your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nIn my message of the 6th of July last, transmitting to Congress the\r\nratified treaty of peace with Mexico, I recommended the adoption of\r\nmeasures for the speedy payment of the public debt. In reiterating that\r\nrecommendation I refer you to the considerations presented in that\r\nmessage in its support. The public debt, including that authorized to be\r\nnegotiated in pursuance of existing laws, and including Treasury notes,\r\namounted at that time to $65,778,450.41.\r\n\r\nFunded stock of the United States amounting to about half a million of\r\ndollars has been purchased, as authorized by law, since that period, and\r\nthe public debt has thus been reduced, the details of which will be\r\npresented in the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of expenditures for the next fiscal year, submitted by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, it is believed will be ample for all\r\nnecessary purposes. If the appropriations made by Congress shall not\r\nexceed the amount estimated, the means in the Treasury will be\r\nsufficient to defray all the expenses of the Government, to pay off the\r\nnext installment of $3,000,000 to Mexico, which will fall due on the\r\n30th of May next, and still a considerable surplus will remain, which\r\nshould be applied to the further purchase of the public stock and\r\nreduction of the debt. Should enlarged appropriations be made, the\r\nnecessary consequence will be to postpone the payment of the debt.\r\nThough our debt, as compared with that of most other nations, is small,\r\nit is our true policy, and in harmony with the genius of our\r\ninstitutions, that we should present to the world the rare spectacle of\r\na great Republic, possessing vast resources and wealth, wholly exempt\r\nfrom public indebtedness. This would add still more to our strength,\r\nand give to us a still more commanding position among the nations of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures should be economical, and be confined to such\r\nnecessary objects as are clearly within the powers of Congress. All such\r\nas are not absolutely demanded should be postponed, and the payment of\r\nthe public debt at the earliest practicable period should be a cardinal\r\nprinciple of our public policy.\r\n\r\nFor the reason assigned in my last annual message, I repeat the\r\nrecommendation that a branch of the Mint of the United States be\r\nestablished at the city of New York. The importance of this measure is\r\ngreatly increased by the acquisition of the rich mines of the precious\r\nmetals in New Mexico and California, and especially in the latter.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation heretofore made in favor of the graduation\r\nand reduction of the price of such of the public lands as have been long\r\noffered in the market and have remained unsold, and in favor of\r\nextending the rights of preemption to actual settlers on the unsurveyed\r\nas well as the surveyed lands.\r\n\r\nThe condition and operations of the Army and the state of other branches\r\nof the public service under the supervision of the War Department are\r\nsatisfactorily presented in the accompanying report of the Secretary of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nOn the return of peace our forces were withdrawn from Mexico, and the\r\nvolunteers and that portion of the Regular Army engaged for the war were\r\ndisbanded. Orders have been issued for stationing the forces of our\r\npermanent establishment at various positions in our extended country\r\nwhere troops may be required. Owing to the remoteness of some of these\r\npositions, the detachments have not yet reached their destination.\r\nNotwithstanding the extension of the limits of our country and the\r\nforces required in the new territories, it is confidently believed that\r\nour present military establishment is sufficient for all exigencies so\r\nlong as our peaceful relations remain undisturbed.\r\n\r\nOf the amount of military contributions collected in Mexico, the sum of\r\n$769,650 was applied toward the payment of the first installment due\r\nunder the treaty with Mexico. The further sum of $346,369.30 has been\r\npaid into the Treasury, and unexpended balances still remain in the\r\nhands of disbursing officers and those who were engaged in the\r\ncollection of these moneys. After the proclamation of peace no further\r\ndisbursements were made of any unexpended moneys arising from this\r\nsource. The balances on hand were directed to be paid into the Treasury,\r\nand individual claims on the fund will remain unadjusted until Congress\r\nshall authorize their settlement and payment. These claims are not\r\nconsiderable in number or amount.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the suggestions of the\r\nSecretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy in regard to legislation\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nOur Indian relations are presented in a most favorable view in the\r\nreport from the War Department. The wisdom of our policy in regard to\r\nthe tribes within our limits is clearly manifested by their improved and\r\nrapidly improving condition.\r\n\r\nA most important treaty with the Menomonies has been recently negotiated\r\nby the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in person, by which all their land\r\nin the State of Wisconsin--being about 4,000,000 acres--has been ceded\r\nto the United States. This treaty will be submitted to the Senate for\r\nratification at an early period of your present session.\r\n\r\nWithin the last four years eight important treaties have been negotiated\r\nwith different Indian tribes, and at a cost of $1,842,000; Indian lands\r\nto the amount of more than 18,500,000 acres have been ceded to the\r\nUnited States, and provision has been made for settling in the country\r\nwest of the Mississippi the tribes which occupied this large extent of\r\nthe public domain. The title to all the Indian lands within the several\r\nStates of our Union, with the exception of a few small reservations, is\r\nnow extinguished, and a vast region opened for settlement and\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy gives a\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the operations and condition of that branch of\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\nA number of small vessels, suitable for entering the mouths of rivers,\r\nwere judiciously purchased during the war, and gave great efficiency to\r\nthe squadron in the Gulf of Mexico. On the return of peace, when no\r\nlonger valuable for naval purposes, and liable to constant\r\ndeterioration, they were sold and the money placed in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe number of men in the naval service authorized by law during the war\r\nhas been reduced by discharges below the maximum fixed for the peace\r\nestablishment. Adequate squadrons are maintained in the several quarters\r\nof the globe where experience has shown their services may be most\r\nusefully employed, and the naval service was never in a condition of\r\nhigher discipline or greater efficiency.\r\n\r\nI invite attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy\r\non the subject of the Marine Corps. The reduction of the Corps at the\r\nend of the war required that four officers of each of the three lower\r\ngrades should be dropped from the rolls. A board of officers made the\r\nselection, and those designated were necessarily dismissed, but without\r\nany alleged fault. I concur in opinion with the Secretary that the\r\nservice would be improved by reducing the number of landsmen and\r\nincreasing the marines. Such a measure would justify an increase of\r\nthe number of officers to the extent of the reduction by dismissal,\r\nand still the Corps would have fewer officers than a corresponding\r\nnumber of men in the Army.\r\n\r\nThe contracts for the transportation of the mail in steamships,\r\nconvertible into war steamers, promise to realize all the benefits to\r\nour commerce and to the Navy which were anticipated. The first steamer\r\nthus secured to the Government was launched in January, 1847. There are\r\nnow seven, and in another year there will probably be not less than\r\nseventeen afloat. While this great national advantage is secured, our\r\nsocial and commercial intercourse is increased and promoted with\r\nGermany, Great Britain, and other parts of Europe, with all the\r\ncountries on the west coast of our continent, especially with Oregon and\r\nCalifornia, and between the northern and southern sections of the United\r\nStates. Considerable revenue may be expected from postages, but the\r\nconnected line from New York to Chagres, and thence across the Isthmus\r\nto Oregon, can not fail to exert a beneficial influence, not now to be\r\nestimated, on the interests of the manufactures, commerce, navigation,\r\nand currency of the United States. As an important part of the system,\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the establishment of the\r\nproposed line of steamers between New Orleans and Vera Cruz. It promises\r\nthe most happy results in cementing friendship between the two Republics\r\nand extending reciprocal benefits to the trade and manufactures of both.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General will make known to you the\r\noperations of that Department for the past year.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to find the revenues of the Department, under the rates\r\nof postage now established by law, so rapidly increasing. The gross\r\namount of postages during the last fiscal year amounted to $4,371,077,\r\nexceeding the annual average received for the nine years immediately\r\npreceding the passage of the act of the 3d of March, 1845, by the sum of\r\n$6,453, and exceeding the amount received for the year ending the 30th\r\nof June, 1847, by the sum of $425,184.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the year, excluding the sum of $94,672, allowed by\r\nCongress at its last session to individual claimants, and including the\r\nsum of $100,500, paid for the services of the line of steamers between\r\nBremen and New York, amounted to $4,198,845, which is less than the\r\nannual average for the nine years previous to the act of 1845 by\r\n$300,748.\r\n\r\nThe mail routes on the 30th day of June last were 163,208 miles in\r\nextent, being an increase during the last year of 9,390 miles. The mails\r\nwere transported over them during the same time 41,012,579 miles, making\r\nan increase of transportation for the year of 2,124,680 miles, whilst\r\nthe expense was less than that of the previous year by $4,235.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the mail transportation within the last three years has\r\nbeen 5,378,310 miles, whilst the expenses were reduced $456,738, making\r\nan increase of service at the rate of 15 per cent and a reduction in the\r\nexpenses of more than 15 per cent.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year there have been employed, under contracts with the\r\nPost-Office Department, two ocean steamers in conveying the mails\r\nmonthly between New York and Bremen, and one, since October last,\r\nperforming semimonthly service between Charleston and Havana; and a\r\ncontract has been made for the transportation of the Pacific mails\r\nacross the Isthmus from Chagres to Panama.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority given to the Secretary of the Navy, three ocean\r\nsteamers have been constructed and sent to the Pacific, and are expected\r\nto enter upon the mail service between Panama and Oregon and the\r\nintermediate ports on the 1st of January next; and a fourth has been\r\nengaged by him for the service between Havana and Chagres, so that a\r\nregular monthly mail line will be kept up after that time between the\r\nUnited States and our territories on the Pacific.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this great increase in the mail service, should the\r\nrevenue continue to increase the present year as it did in the last,\r\nthere will be received near $450,000 more than the expenditures.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have satisfied the Postmaster-General that, with\r\ncertain modifications of the act of 1845, the revenue may be still\r\nfurther increased and a reduction of postages made to a uniform rate of\r\n5 cents, without an interference with the principle, which has been\r\nconstantly and properly enforced, of making that Department sustain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nA well-digested cheap-postage system is the best means of diffusing\r\nintelligence among the people, and is of so much importance in a country\r\nso extensive as that of the United States that I recommend to your\r\nfavorable consideration the suggestions of the Postmaster-General for\r\nits improvement.\r\n\r\nNothing can retard the onward progress of our country and prevent us\r\nfrom assuming and maintaining the first rank among nations but a\r\ndisregard of the experience of the past and a recurrence to an unwise\r\npublic policy. We have just closed a foreign war by an honorable\r\npeace--a war rendered necessary and unavoidable in vindication of the\r\nnational rights and honor. The present condition of the country is\r\nsimilar in some respects to that which existed immediately after the\r\nclose of the war with Great Britain in 1815, and the occasion is deemed\r\nto be a proper one to take a retrospect of the measures of public policy\r\nwhich followed that war. There was at that period of our history a\r\ndeparture from our earlier policy. The enlargement of the powers of the\r\nFederal Government by _construction_, which obtained, was not warranted\r\nby any just interpretation of the Constitution. A few years after the\r\nclose of that war a series of measures was adopted which, united and\r\ncombined, constituted what was termed by their authors and advocates the\r\n\"American system.\"\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the new policy was for a time favored by the\r\ncondition of the country, by the heavy debt which had been contracted\r\nduring the war, by the depression of the public credit, by the deranged\r\nstate of the finances and the currency, and by the commercial and\r\npecuniary embarrassment which extensively prevailed. These were not the\r\nonly causes which led to its establishment. The events of the war with\r\nGreat Britain and the embarrassments which had attended its prosecution\r\nhad left on the minds of many of our statesmen the impression that our\r\nGovernment was not strong enough, and that to wield its resources\r\nsuccessfully in great emergencies, and especially in war, more power\r\nshould be concentrated in its hands. This increased power they did not\r\nseek to obtain by the legitimate and prescribed mode--an amendment of\r\nthe Constitution--but by _construction_. They saw Governments in the Old\r\nWorld based upon different orders of society, and so constituted as to\r\nthrow the whole power of nations into the hands of a few, who taxed and\r\ncontrolled the many without responsibility or restraint. In that\r\narrangement they conceived the strength of nations in war consisted.\r\nThere was also something fascinating in the ease, luxury, and display of\r\nthe higher orders, who drew their wealth from the toil of the laboring\r\nmillions. The authors of the system drew their ideas of political\r\neconomy from what they had witnessed in Europe, and particularly in\r\nGreat Britain. They had viewed the enormous wealth concentrated in few\r\nhands and had seen the splendor of the overgrown establishments of an\r\naristocracy which was upheld by the restrictive policy. They forgot to\r\nlook down upon the poorer classes of the English population, upon whose\r\ndaily and yearly labor the great establishments they so much admired\r\nwere sustained and supported. They failed to perceive that the scantily\r\nfed and half-clad operatives were not only in abject poverty, but were\r\nbound in chains of oppressive servitude for the benefit of favored\r\nclasses, who were the exclusive objects of the care of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible to reconstruct society in the United States upon the\r\nEuropean plan. Here there was a written Constitution, by which orders\r\nand titles were not recognized or tolerated. A system of measures was\r\ntherefore devised, calculated, if not intended, to withdraw power\r\ngradually and silently from the States and the mass of the people, and\r\nby _construction_ to approximate our Government to the European models,\r\nsubstituting an aristocracy of wealth for that of orders and titles.\r\n\r\nWithout reflecting upon the dissimilarity of our institutions and of the\r\ncondition of our people and those of Europe, they conceived the vain\r\nidea of building up in the United States a system similar to that which\r\nthey admired abroad. Great Britain had a national bank of large capital,\r\nin whose hands was concentrated the controlling monetary and financial\r\npower of the nation--an institution wielding almost kingly power, and\r\nexerting vast influence upon all the operations of trade and upon the\r\npolicy of the Government itself. Great Britain had an enormous public\r\ndebt, and it had become a part of her public policy to regard this\r\nas a \"public blessing.\" Great Britain had also a restrictive policy,\r\nwhich placed fetters and burdens on trade and trammeled the productive\r\nindustry of the mass of the nation. By her combined system of policy the\r\nlandlords and other property holders were protected and enriched by the\r\nenormous taxes which were levied upon the labor of the country for their\r\nadvantage. Imitating this foreign policy, the first step in establishing\r\nthe new system in the United States was the creation of a national bank.\r\nNot foreseeing the dangerous power and countless evils which such an\r\ninstitution might entail on the country, nor perceiving the connection\r\nwhich it was designed to form between the bank and the other branches of\r\nthe miscalled \"American system,\" but feeling the embarrassments of the\r\nTreasury and of the business of the country consequent upon the war,\r\nsome of our statesmen who had held different and sounder views were\r\ninduced to yield their scruples and, indeed, settled convictions of its\r\nunconstitutionality, and to give it their sanction as an expedient which\r\nthey vainly hoped might produce relief. It was a most unfortunate error,\r\nas the subsequent history and final catastrophe of that dangerous and\r\ncorrupt institution have abundantly proved. The bank, with its numerous\r\nbranches ramified into the States, soon brought many of the active\r\npolitical and commercial men in different sections of the country into\r\nthe relation of debtors to it and dependents upon it for pecuniary\r\nfavors, thus diffusing throughout the mass of society a great number of\r\nindividuals of power and influence to give tone to public opinion and\r\nto act in concert in cases of emergency. The corrupt power of such a\r\npolitical engine is no longer a matter of speculation, having been\r\ndisplayed in numerous instances, but most signally in the political\r\nstruggles of 1832, 1833, and 1834 in opposition to the public will\r\nrepresented by a fearless and patriotic President.\r\n\r\nBut the bank was but one branch of the new system. A public debt of more\r\nthan $120,000,000 existed, and it is not to be disguised that many of\r\nthe authors of the new system did not regard its speedy payment as\r\nessential to the public prosperity, but looked upon its continuance as\r\nno national evil. Whilst the debt existed it furnished aliment to the\r\nnational bank and rendered increased taxation necessary to the amount of\r\nthe interest, exceeding $7,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\nThis operated in harmony with the next branch of the new system, which\r\nwas a high protective tariff. This was to afford bounties to favored\r\nclasses and particular pursuits at the expense of all others. A\r\nproposition to tax the whole people for the purpose of enriching a few\r\nwas too monstrous to be openly made. The scheme was therefore veiled\r\nunder the plausible but delusive pretext of a measure to protect \"home\r\nindustry,\" and many of our people were for a time led to believe that a\r\ntax which in the main fell upon labor was for the benefit of the laborer\r\nwho paid it. This branch of the system involved a partnership between\r\nthe Government and the favored classes, the former receiving the\r\nproceeds of the tax imposed on articles imported and the latter the\r\nincreased price of similar articles produced at home, caused by such\r\ntax. It is obvious that the portion to be received by the favored\r\nclasses would, as a general rule, be increased in proportion to the\r\nincrease of the rates of tax imposed and diminished as those rates were\r\nreduced to the revenue standard required by the wants of the Government.\r\nThe rates required to produce a sufficient revenue for the ordinary\r\nexpenditures of Government for necessary purposes were not likely to\r\ngive to the private partners in this scheme profits sufficient to\r\nsatisfy their cupidity, and hence a variety of expedients and pretexts\r\nwere resorted to for the purpose of enlarging the expenditures and\r\nthereby creating a necessity for keeping up a high protective tariff.\r\nThe effect of this policy was to interpose artificial restrictions upon\r\nthe natural course of the business and trade of the country, and to\r\nadvance the interests of large capitalists and monopolists at the\r\nexpense of the great mass of the people, who were taxed to increase\r\ntheir wealth.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of this system was a comprehensive scheme of internal\r\nimprovements, capable of indefinite enlargement and sufficient to\r\nswallow up as many millions annually as could be exacted from the\r\nforeign commerce of the country. This was a convenient and necessary\r\nadjunct of the protective tariff. It was to be the great absorbent of\r\nany surplus which might at any time accumulate in the Treasury and of\r\nthe taxes levied on the people, not for necessary revenue purposes, but\r\nfor the avowed object of affording protection to the favored classes.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary to the same end, if it was not an essential part of the system\r\nitself, was the scheme, which at a later period obtained, for distributing\r\nthe proceeds of the sales of the public lands among the States. Other\r\nexpedients were devised to take money out of the Treasury and prevent\r\nits coming in from any other source than the protective tariff. The\r\nauthors and supporters of the system were the advocates of the largest\r\nexpenditures, whether for necessary or useful purposes or not, because\r\nthe larger the expenditures the greater was the pretext for high taxes\r\nin the form of protective duties.\r\n\r\nThese several measures were sustained by popular names and plausible\r\narguments, by which thousands were deluded. The bank was represented to\r\nbe an indispensable fiscal agent for the Government; was to equalize\r\nexchanges and to regulate and furnish a sound currency, always and\r\neverywhere of uniform value. The protective tariff was to give\r\nemployment to \"American labor\" at advanced prices; was to protect\r\n\"home industry\" and furnish a steady market for the farmer. Internal\r\nimprovements were to bring trade into every neighborhood and enhance the\r\nvalue of every man's property. The distribution of the land money was to\r\nenrich the States, finish their public works, plant schools throughout\r\ntheir borders, and relieve them from taxation. But the fact that for\r\nevery dollar taken out of the Treasury for these objects a much larger\r\nsum was transferred from the pockets of the people to the favored\r\nclasses was carefully concealed, as was also the tendency, if not the\r\nultimate design, of the system to build up an aristocracy of wealth, to\r\ncontrol the masses of society, and monopolize the political power of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe several branches of this system were so intimately blended\r\ntogether that in their operation each sustained and strengthened the\r\nothers. Their joint operation was to add new burthens of taxation and to\r\nencourage a largely increased and wasteful expenditure of public money.\r\nIt was the interest of the bank that the revenue collected and the\r\ndisbursements made by the Government should be large, because, being the\r\ndepository of the public money, the larger the amount the greater would\r\nbe the bank profits by its use. It was the interest of the favored\r\nclasses, who were enriched by the protective tariff, to have the rates\r\nof that protection as high as possible, for the higher those rates the\r\ngreater would be their advantage. It was the interest of the people\r\nof all those sections and localities who expected to be benefited by\r\nexpenditures for internal improvements that the amount collected should\r\nbe as large as possible, to the end that the sum disbursed might also be\r\nthe larger. The States, being the beneficiaries in the distribution of\r\nthe land money, had an interest in having the rates of tax imposed by\r\nthe protective tariff large enough to yield a sufficient revenue from\r\nthat source to meet the wants of the Government without disturbing\r\nor taking from them the land fund; so that each of the branches\r\nconstituting the system had a common interest in swelling the public\r\nexpenditures. They had a direct interest in maintaining the public debt\r\nunpaid and increasing its amount, because this would produce an annual\r\nincreased drain upon the Treasury to the amount of the interest and\r\nrender augmented taxes necessary. The operation and necessary effect of\r\nthe whole system were to encourage large and extravagant expenditures,\r\nand thereby to increase the public patronage, and maintain a rich and\r\nsplendid government at the expense of a taxed and impoverished people.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that this scheme of enlarged taxation and expenditures,\r\nhad it continued to prevail, must soon have converted the Government of\r\nthe Union, intended by its framers to be a plain, cheap, and simple\r\nconfederation of States, united together for common protection and\r\ncharged with a few specific duties, relating chiefly to our foreign\r\naffairs, into a consolidated empire, depriving the States of their\r\nreserved rights and the people of their just power and control in the\r\nadministration of their Government. In this manner the whole form and\r\ncharacter of the Government would be changed, not by an amendment of the\r\nConstitution, but by resorting to an unwarrantable and unauthorized\r\nconstruction of that instrument.\r\n\r\nThe indirect mode of levying the taxes by a duty on imports prevents\r\nthe mass of the people from readily perceiving the amount they pay, and\r\nhas enabled the few who are thus enriched, and who seek to wield the\r\npolitical power of the country, to deceive and delude them. Were the\r\ntaxes collected by a direct levy upon the people, as is the case in the\r\nStates, this could not occur.\r\n\r\nThe whole system was resisted from its inception by many of our\r\nablest statesmen, some of whom doubted its constitutionality and its\r\nexpediency, while others believed it was in all its branches a flagrant\r\nand dangerous infraction of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThat a national bank, a protective tariff--levied not to raise the\r\nrevenue needed, but for protection merely--internal improvements, and\r\nthe distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the public lands are\r\nmeasures without the warrant of the Constitution would, upon the\r\nmaturest consideration, seem to be clear. It is remarkable that no one\r\nof these measures, involving such momentous consequences, is authorized\r\nby any express grant of power in the Constitution. No one of them is\r\n\"incident to, as being necessary and proper for the execution of, the\r\nspecific powers\" granted by the Constitution. The authority under which\r\nit has been attempted to justify each of them is derived from inferences\r\nand constructions of the Constitution which its letter and its whole\r\nobject and design do not warrant. Is it to be conceived that such\r\nimmense powers would have been left by the framers of the Constitution\r\nto mere inferences and doubtful constructions? Had it been intended to\r\nconfer them on the Federal Government, it is but reasonable to conclude\r\nthat it would have been done by plain and unequivocal grants. This was\r\nnot done; but the whole structure of which the \"American system\"\r\nconsisted was reared on no other or better foundation than forced\r\nimplications and inferences of power, which its authors assumed might\r\nbe deduced by construction from the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut it has been urged that the national bank, which constituted so\r\nessential a branch of this combined system of measures, was not a new\r\nmeasure, and that its constitutionality had been previously sanctioned,\r\nbecause a bank had been chartered in 1791 and had received the official\r\nsignature of President Washington. A few facts will show the just weight\r\nto which this precedent should be entitled as bearing upon the question\r\nof constitutionality.\r\n\r\nGreat division of opinion upon the subject existed in Congress. It is\r\nwell known that President Washington entertained serious doubts both as\r\nto the constitutionality and expediency of the measure, and while the\r\nbill was before him for his official approval or disapproval so great\r\nwere these doubts that he required \"the opinion in writing\" of the\r\nmembers of his Cabinet to aid him in arriving at a decision. His Cabinet\r\ngave their opinions and were divided upon the subject, _General\r\nHamilton_ being in favor of and _Mr. Jefferson_ and _Mr. Randolph_ being\r\nopposed to the constitutionality and expediency of the bank. It is well\r\nknown also that President Washington retained the bill from Monday, the\r\n14th, when it was presented to him, until Friday, the 25th of February,\r\nbeing the last moment permitted him by the Constitution to deliberate,\r\nwhen he finally yielded to it his reluctant assent and gave it his\r\nsignature. It is certain that as late as the 23d of February, being the\r\nninth day after the bill was presented to him, he had arrived at no\r\nsatisfactory conclusion, for on that day he addressed a note to General\r\nHamilton in which he informs him that \"this bill was presented to me by\r\nthe joint committee of Congress at 12 o'clock on Monday, the 14th\r\ninstant,\" and he requested his opinion \"to what precise period, by legal\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution, can the President retain it in his\r\npossession before it becomes a law by the lapse of ten days.\" If the\r\nproper construction was that the day on which the bill was presented to\r\nthe President and the day on which his action was had upon it were both\r\nto be counted inclusive, then the time allowed him within which it would\r\nbe competent for him to return it to the House in which it originated\r\nwith his objections would expire on Thursday, the 24th of February.\r\nGeneral Hamilton on the same day returned an answer, in which he states:\r\n\r\n  I give it as my opinion that you have ten days exclusive of that on\r\n  which the bill was delivered to you and Sundays; hence, in the present\r\n  case if it is returned on Friday it will be in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this construction, which the President adopted, he gained another day\r\nfor deliberation, and it was not until the 25th of February that he\r\nsigned the bill, thus affording conclusive proof that he had at last\r\nobtained his own consent to sign it not without great and almost\r\ninsuperable difficulty. Additional light has been recently shed upon the\r\nserious doubts which he had on the subject, amounting at one time to a\r\nconviction that it was his duty to withhold his approval from the bill.\r\nThis is found among the manuscript papers of _Mr. Madison_, authorized\r\nto be purchased for the use of the Government by an act of the last\r\nsession of Congress, and now for the first time accessible to the\r\npublic. From these papers it appears that President Washington, while he\r\nyet held the bank bill in his hands, actually requested _Mr. Madison_,\r\nat that time a member of the House of Representatives, to prepare the\r\ndraft of a veto message for him. _Mr. Madison_, at his request, did\r\nprepare the draft of such a message, and sent it to him on the 21st of\r\nFebruary, 1791. A copy of this original draft, in Mr. Madison's own\r\nhandwriting, was carefully preserved by him, and is among the papers\r\nlately purchased by Congress. It is preceded by a note, written on the\r\nsame sheet, which is also in Mr. Madison's handwriting, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _February 21, 1791_.--Copy of a paper made out and sent to the\r\n  President, _at his request,_ to be ready in case his judgment should\r\n  finally decide against the bill for incorporating a national bank,\r\n  the bill being then before him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the objections assigned in this paper to the bill, and which were\r\nsubmitted for the consideration of the President, are the following:\r\n\r\n  I object to the bill, because it is an essential principle of the\r\n  Government that powers not delegated by the Constitution can not be\r\n  rightfully exercised; because the power proposed by the bill to be\r\n  exercised is not expressly delegated, and because I can not satisfy\r\n  myself that it results from any express power by fair and safe rules\r\n  of interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weight of the precedent of the bank of 1791 and the sanction of\r\nthe great name of Washington, which has been so often invoked in its\r\nsupport, are greatly weakened by the development of these facts.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of that bank satisfied the country that it ought not to\r\nbe continued, and at the end of twenty years Congress refused to\r\nrecharter it. It would have been fortunate for the country, and saved\r\nthousands from bankruptcy and ruin, had our public men of 1816 resisted\r\nthe temporary pressure of the times upon our financial and pecuniary\r\ninterests and refused to charter the second bank. Of this the country\r\nbecame abundantly satisfied, and at the close of its twenty years'\r\nduration, as in the case of the first bank, it also ceased to exist.\r\nUnder the repeated blows of _President Jackson_ it reeled and fell, and\r\na subsequent attempt to charter a similar institution was arrested by\r\nthe _veto_ of President Tyler.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Madison_, in yielding his signature to the charter of 1816, did so\r\nupon the ground of the respect due to precedents; and, as he\r\nsubsequently declared--\r\n\r\n  The Bank of the United States, though on the original question held\r\n  to be unconstitutional, received the Executive signature.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable that neither the bank of 1791 nor that of 1816 would have\r\nbeen chartered but for the embarrassments of the Government in its\r\nfinances, the derangement of the currency, and the pecuniary pressure\r\nwhich existed, the first the consequence of the War of the Revolution\r\nand the second the consequence of the War of 1812. Both were resorted to\r\nin the delusive hope that they would restore public credit and afford\r\nrelief to the Government and to the business of the country.\r\n\r\nThose of our public men who opposed the whole \"American system\"\r\nat its commencement and throughout its progress foresaw and predicted\r\nthat it was fraught with incalculable mischiefs and must result in\r\nserious injury to the best interests of the country. For a series of\r\nyears their wise counsels were unheeded, and the system was established.\r\nIt was soon apparent that its practical operation was unequal and unjust\r\nupon different portions of the country and upon the people engaged\r\nin different pursuits. All were equally entitled to the favor and\r\nprotection of the Government. It fostered and elevated the money power\r\nand enriched the favored few by taxing labor, and at the expense of the\r\nmany. Its effect was to \"make the rich richer and the poor poorer.\" Its\r\ntendency was to create distinctions in society based on wealth and to\r\ngive to the favored classes undue control and sway in our Government. It\r\nwas an organized money power, which resisted the popular will and sought\r\nto shape and control the public policy.\r\n\r\nUnder the pernicious workings of this combined system of measures the\r\ncountry witnessed alternate seasons of temporary apparent prosperity,\r\nof sudden and disastrous commercial revulsions, of unprecedented\r\nfluctuation of prices and depression of the great interests of\r\nagriculture, navigation, and commerce, of general pecuniary suffering,\r\nand of final bankruptcy of thousands. After a severe struggle of more\r\nthan a quarter of a century, the system was overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe bank has been succeeded by a practical system of finance, conducted\r\nand controlled solely by the Government. The constitutional currency has\r\nbeen restored, the public credit maintained unimpaired even in a period\r\nof a foreign war, and the whole country has become satisfied that banks,\r\nnational or State, are not necessary as fiscal agents of the Government.\r\nRevenue duties have taken the place of the protective tariff. The\r\ndistribution of the money derived from the sale of the public lands has\r\nbeen abandoned and the corrupting system of internal improvements, it is\r\nhoped, has been effectually checked.\r\n\r\nIt is not doubted that if this whole train of measures, designed to take\r\nwealth from the many and bestow it upon the few, were to prevail the\r\neffect would be to change the entire character of the Government. One\r\nonly danger remains. It is the seductions of that branch of the system\r\nwhich consists in internal improvements, holding out, as it does,\r\ninducements to the people of particular sections and localities to\r\nembark the Government in them without stopping to calculate the\r\ninevitable consequences. This branch of the system is so intimately\r\ncombined and linked with the others that as surely as an effect is\r\nproduced by an adequate cause, if it be resuscitated and revived and\r\nfirmly established it requires no sagacity to foresee that it will\r\nnecessarily and speedily draw after it the reestablishment of a national\r\nbank, the revival of a protective tariff, the distribution of the land\r\nmoney, and not only the postponement to the distant future of the\r\npayment of the present national debt, but its annual increase.\r\n\r\nI entertain the solemn conviction that if the internal-improvement\r\nbranch of the \"American system\" be not firmly resisted at this time the\r\nwhole series of measures composing it will be speedily reestablished and\r\nthe country be thrown back from its present high state of prosperity,\r\nwhich the existing policy has produced, and be destined again to witness\r\nall the evils, commercial revulsions, depression of prices, and\r\npecuniary embarrassments through which we have passed during the last\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nTo guard against consequences so ruinous is an object of high national\r\nimportance, involving, in my judgment, the continued prosperity of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI have felt it to be an imperative obligation to withhold my\r\nconstitutional sanction from two bills which had passed the two Houses\r\nof Congress, involving the principle of the internal-improvement branch\r\nof the \"American system\" and conflicting in their provisions with the\r\nviews here expressed.\r\n\r\nThis power, conferred upon the President by the Constitution, I have on\r\nthree occasions during my administration of the executive department of\r\nthe Government deemed it my duty to exercise, and on this last occasion\r\nof making to Congress an annual communication \"of the state of the\r\nUnion\" it is not deemed inappropriate to review the principles and\r\nconsiderations which have governed my action. I deem this the more\r\nnecessary because, after the lapse of nearly sixty years since the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, the propriety of the exercise of this\r\nundoubted constitutional power by the President has for the first time\r\nbeen drawn seriously in question by a portion of my fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that--\r\n\r\n  Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the\r\n  Senate shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of\r\n  the United States. If he approve he _shall_ sign it, but if not he\r\n  _shall_ return it with his objections to that House in which it shall\r\n  have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their\r\n  Journal and proceed to reconsider it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the Constitution from infraction is the President's\r\nhighest duty. He is bound to discharge that duty at whatever hazard of\r\nincurring the displeasure of those who may differ with him in opinion.\r\nHe is bound to discharge it as well by his obligations to the people who\r\nhave clothed him with his exalted trust as by his oath of office, which\r\nhe may not disregard. Nor are the obligations of the President in any\r\ndegree lessened by the prevalence of views different from his own in one\r\nor both Houses of Congress. It is not alone hasty and inconsiderate\r\nlegislation that he is required to check; but if at any time Congress\r\nshall, after apparently full deliberation, resolve on measures which he\r\ndeems subversive of the Constitution or of the vital interests of the\r\ncountry, it is his solemn duty to stand in the breach and resist them.\r\nThe President is bound to approve or disapprove every bill which passes\r\nCongress and is presented to him for his signature. The Constitution\r\nmakes this his duty, and he can not escape it if he would. He has no\r\nelection. In deciding upon any bill presented to him he must exercise\r\nhis own best judgment. If he can not approve, the Constitution commands\r\nhim to return the bill to the House in which it originated with his\r\nobjections, and if he fail to do this within ten days (Sundays excepted)\r\nit shall become a law without his signature. Right or wrong, he may be\r\noverruled by a vote of two-thirds of each House, and in that event the\r\nbill becomes a law without his sanction. If his objections be not thus\r\noverruled, the subject is only postponed, and is referred to the States\r\nand the people for their consideration and decision. The President's\r\npower is negative merely, and not affirmative. He can enact no law. The\r\nonly effect, therefore, of his withholding his approval of a bill passed\r\nby Congress is to suffer the existing laws to remain unchanged, and the\r\ndelay occasioned is only that required to enable the States and the\r\npeople to consider and act upon the subject in the election of public\r\nagents who will carry out their wishes and instructions. Any attempt to\r\ncoerce the President to yield his sanction to measures which he can not\r\napprove would be a violation of the spirit of the Constitution, palpable\r\nand flagrant, and if successful would break down the independence of the\r\nexecutive department and make the President, elected by the people and\r\nclothed by the Constitution with power to defend their rights, the mere\r\ninstrument of a majority of Congress. A surrender on his part of the\r\npowers with which the Constitution has invested his office would effect\r\na practical alteration of that instrument without resorting to the\r\nprescribed process of amendment.\r\n\r\nWith the motives or considerations which may induce Congress to pass any\r\nbill the President can have nothing to do. He must presume them to be as\r\npure as his own, and look only to the practical effect of their measures\r\nwhen compared with the Constitution or the public good.\r\n\r\nBut it has been urged by those who object to the exercise of this\r\nundoubted constitutional power that it assails the representative\r\nprinciple and the capacity of the people to govern themselves; that\r\nthere is greater safety in a numerous representative body than in the\r\nsingle Executive created by the Constitution, and that the Executive\r\nveto is a \"one-man power,\" despotic in its character. To expose the\r\nfallacy of this objection it is only necessary to consider the frame and\r\ntrue character of our system. Ours is not a consolidated empire, but a\r\nconfederated union. The States before the adoption of the Constitution\r\nwere coordinate, coequal, and separate independent sovereignties, and by\r\nits adoption they did not lose that character. They clothed the Federal\r\nGovernment with certain powers and reserved all others, including their\r\nown sovereignty, to themselves. They guarded their own rights as States\r\nand the rights of the people by the very limitations which they\r\nincorporated into the Federal Constitution, whereby the different\r\ndepartments of the General Government were checks upon each other. That\r\nthe majority should govern is a general principle controverted by none,\r\nbut they must govern according to the Constitution, and not according to\r\nan undefined and unrestrained discretion, whereby they may oppress the\r\nminority.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are not blind to the fact that they may\r\nbe temporarily misled, and that their representatives, legislative and\r\nexecutive, may be mistaken or influenced in their action by improper\r\nmotives. They have therefore interposed between themselves and the laws\r\nwhich may be passed by their public agents various representations, such\r\nas assemblies, senates, and governors in their several States, a House\r\nof Representatives, a Senate, and a President of the United States. The\r\npeople can by their own direct agency make no law, nor can the House of\r\nRepresentatives, immediately elected by them, nor can the Senate, nor\r\ncan both together without the concurrence of the President or a vote of\r\ntwo-thirds of both Houses.\r\n\r\nHappily for themselves, the people in framing our admirable system of\r\ngovernment were conscious of the infirmities of their representatives,\r\nand in delegating to them the power of legislation they have fenced them\r\naround with checks to guard against the effects of hasty action, of\r\nerror, of combination, and of possible corruption. Error, selfishness,\r\nand faction have often sought to rend asunder this web of checks and\r\nsubject the Government to the control of fanatic and sinister\r\ninfluences, but these efforts have only satisfied the people of the\r\nwisdom of the checks which they have imposed and of the necessity of\r\npreserving them unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe true theory of our system is not to govern by the acts or decrees\r\nof any one set of representatives. The Constitution interposes checks\r\nupon all branches of the Government, in order to give time for error to\r\nbe corrected and delusion to pass away; but if the people settle down\r\ninto a firm conviction different from that of their representatives they\r\ngive effect to their opinions by changing their public servants. The\r\nchecks which the people imposed on their public servants in the adoption\r\nof the Constitution are the best evidence of their capacity for\r\nself-government. They know that the men whom they elect to public\r\nstations are of like infirmities and passions with themselves, and not\r\nto be trusted without being restricted by coordinate authorities and\r\nconstitutional limitations. Who that has witnessed the legislation of\r\nCongress for the last thirty years will say that he knows of no instance\r\nin which measures not demanded by the public good have been carried? Who\r\nwill deny that in the State governments, by combinations of individuals\r\nand sections, in derogation of the general interest, banks have been\r\nchartered, systems of internal improvements adopted, and debts entailed\r\nupon the people repressing their growth and impairing their energies for\r\nyears to come?\r\n\r\nAfter so much experience it can not be said that absolute unchecked\r\npower is safe in the hands of any one set of representatives, or that\r\nthe capacity of the people for self-government, which is admitted in its\r\nbroadest extent, is a conclusive argument to prove the prudence, wisdom,\r\nand integrity of their representatives.\r\n\r\nThe people, by the Constitution, have commanded the President, as\r\nmuch as they have commanded the legislative branch of the Government,\r\nto execute their will. They have said to him in the Constitution, which\r\nthey require he shall take a solemn oath to support, that if Congress\r\npass any bill which he can not approve \"he shall return it to the House\r\nin which it originated with his objections.\" In withholding from it\r\nhis approval and signature he is executing the will of the people,\r\nconstitutionally expressed, as much as the Congress that passed it.\r\nNo bill is presumed to be in accordance with the popular will until it\r\nshall have passed through all the branches of the Government required\r\nby the Constitution to make it a law. A bill which passes the House of\r\nRepresentatives may be rejected by the Senate, and so a bill passed by\r\nthe Senate may be rejected by the House. In each case the respective\r\nHouses exercise the veto power on the other.\r\n\r\nCongress, and each House of Congress, hold under the Constitution a\r\ncheck upon the President, and he, by the power of the qualified veto, a\r\ncheck upon Congress. When the President recommends measures to Congress,\r\nhe avows in the most solemn form his opinions, gives his voice in their\r\nfavor, and pledges himself in advance to approve them if passed by\r\nCongress. If he acts without due consideration, or has been influenced\r\nby improper or corrupt motives, or if from any other cause Congress,\r\nor either House of Congress, shall differ with him in opinion, they\r\nexercise their _veto_ upon his recommendations and reject them; and\r\nthere is no appeal from their decision but to the people at the ballot\r\nbox. These are proper checks upon the Executive, wisely interposed by\r\nthe Constitution. None will be found to object to them or to wish them\r\nremoved. It is equally important that the constitutional checks of the\r\nExecutive upon the legislative branch should be preserved.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that the Representatives in the popular branch of Congress\r\nare chosen directly by the people, it is answered, the people elect the\r\nPresident. If both Houses represent the States and the people, so does\r\nthe President. The President represents in the executive department the\r\nwhole people of the United States, as each member of the legislative\r\ndepartment represents portions of them.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of restriction upon legislative and executive power, while\r\na well-settled public opinion is enabled within a reasonable time to\r\naccomplish its ends, has made our country what it is, and has opened to\r\nus a career of glory and happiness to which all other nations have been\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of the power of the veto the President is responsible\r\nnot only to an enlightened public opinion, but to the people of the\r\nwhole Union, who elected him, as the representatives in the legislative\r\nbranches who differ with him in opinion are responsible to the people\r\nof particular States or districts, who compose their respective\r\nconstituencies. To deny to the President the exercise of this power\r\nwould be to repeal that provision of the Constitution which confers it\r\nupon him. To charge that its exercise unduly controls the legislative\r\nwill is to complain of the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\nIf the Presidential veto be objected to upon the ground that it checks\r\nand thwarts the popular will, upon the same principle the equality of\r\nrepresentation of the States in the Senate should be stricken out of\r\nthe Constitution. The vote of a Senator from Delaware has equal weight\r\nin deciding upon the most important measures with the vote of a Senator\r\nfrom New York, and yet the one represents a State containing, according\r\nto the existing apportionment of Representatives in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, but one thirty-fourth part of the population of the\r\nother. By the constitutional composition of the Senate a majority of\r\nthat body from the smaller States represent less than one-fourth of the\r\npeople of the Union. There are thirty States, and under the existing\r\napportionment of Representatives there are 230 Members in the House\r\nof Representatives. Sixteen of the smaller States are represented in\r\nthat House by but 50 Members, and yet the Senators from these States\r\nconstitute a majority of the Senate. So that the President may recommend\r\na measure to Congress, and it may receive the sanction and approval of\r\nmore than three-fourths of the House of Representatives and of all the\r\nSenators from the large States, containing more than three-fourths of\r\nthe whole population of the United States, and yet the measure may be\r\ndefeated by the votes of the Senators from the smaller States. None, it\r\nis presumed, can be found ready to change the organization of the Senate\r\non this account, or to strike that body practically out of existence by\r\nrequiring that its action shall be conformed to the will of the more\r\nnumerous branch.\r\n\r\nUpon the same principle that the _veto_ of the President should be\r\npractically abolished the power of the Vice-President to give the\r\ncasting vote upon an equal division of the Senate should be abolished\r\nalso. The Vice-President exercises the _veto_ power as effectually by\r\nrejecting a bill by his casting vote as the President does by refusing\r\nto approve and sign it. This power has been exercised by the\r\nVice-President in a few instances, the most important of which was the\r\nrejection of the bill to recharter the Bank of the United States in\r\n1811. It may happen that a bill may be passed by a large majority of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and may be supported by the Senators from the\r\nlarger States, and the Vice-President may reject it by giving his vote\r\nwith the Senators from the smaller States; and yet none, it is presumed,\r\nare prepared to deny to him the exercise of this power under the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nBut it is, in point of fact, untrue that an act passed by Congress\r\nis conclusive evidence that it is an emanation of the popular will.\r\nA majority of the whole number elected to each House of Congress\r\nconstitutes a quorum, and a majority of that quorum is competent to pass\r\nlaws. It might happen that a quorum of the House of Representatives,\r\nconsisting of a single member more than half of the whole number elected\r\nto that House, might pass a bill by a majority of a single vote, and in\r\nthat case a fraction more than one-fourth of the people of the United\r\nStates would be represented by those who voted for it. It might happen\r\nthat the same bill might be passed by a majority of one of a quorum of\r\nthe Senate, composed of Senators from the fifteen smaller States and a\r\nsingle Senator from a sixteenth State; and if the Senators voting for it\r\nhappened to be from the eight of the smallest of these States, it would\r\nbe passed by the votes of Senators from States having but fourteen\r\nRepresentatives in the House of Representatives, and containing less\r\nthan one-sixteenth of the whole population of the United States. This\r\nextreme case is stated to illustrate the fact that the mere passage of\r\na bill by Congress is no conclusive evidence that those who passed it\r\nrepresent the majority of the people of the United States or truly\r\nreflect their will. If such an extreme case is not likely to happen,\r\ncases that approximate it are of constant occurrence. It is believed\r\nthat not a single law has been passed since the adoption of the\r\nConstitution upon which all the members elected to both Houses have been\r\npresent and voted. Many of the most important acts which have passed\r\nCongress have been carried by a close vote in thin Houses. Many\r\ninstances of this might be given. Indeed, our experience proves that\r\nmany of the most important acts of Congress are postponed to the last\r\ndays, and often the last hours, of a session, when they are disposed of\r\nin haste, and by Houses but little exceeding the number necessary to\r\nform a quorum.\r\n\r\nBesides, in most of the States the members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives are chosen by pluralities, and not by majorities of all\r\nthe voters in their respective districts, and it may happen that a\r\nmajority of that House may be returned by a less aggregate vote of the\r\npeople than that received by the minority.\r\n\r\nIf the principle insisted on be sound, then the Constitution should be\r\nso changed that no bill shall become a law unless it is voted for by\r\nmembers representing in each House a majority of the whole people of the\r\nUnited States. We must remodel our whole system, strike down and abolish\r\nnot only the salutary checks lodged in the executive branch, But must\r\nstrike out and abolish those lodged in the Senate also, and thus\r\npractically invest the whole power of the Government in a majority of\r\na single assembly--a majority uncontrolled and absolute, and which may\r\nbecome despotic. To conform to this doctrine of the right of majorities\r\nto rule, independent of the checks and limitations of the Constitution,\r\nwe must revolutionize our whole system; we must destroy the\r\nconstitutional compact by which the several States agreed to form a\r\nFederal Union and rush into consolidation, which must end in monarchy or\r\ndespotism. No one advocates such a proposition, and yet the doctrine\r\nmaintained, if carried out, must lead to this result.\r\n\r\nOne great object of the Constitution in conferring upon the President\r\na qualified negative upon the legislation of Congress was to protect\r\nminorities from injustice and oppression by majorities. The equality of\r\ntheir representation in the Senate and the veto power of the President\r\nare the constitutional guaranties which the smaller States have that\r\ntheir rights will be respected. Without these guaranties all their\r\ninterests would be at the mercy of majorities in Congress representing\r\nthe larger States. To the smaller and weaker States, therefore, the\r\npreservation of this power and its exercise upon proper occasions\r\ndemanding it is of vital importance. They ratified the Constitution and\r\nentered into the Union, securing to themselves an equal representation\r\nwith the larger States in the Senate; and they agreed to be bound by all\r\nlaws passed by Congress upon the express condition, and none other, that\r\nthey should be approved by the President or passed, his objections to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding, by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses.\r\nUpon this condition they have a right to insist as a part of the compact\r\nto which they gave their assent.\r\n\r\nA bill might be passed by Congress against the will of the whole people\r\nof a particular State and against the votes of its Senators and all its\r\nRepresentatives. However prejudicial it might be to the interests of\r\nsuch State, it would be bound by it if the President shall approve it or\r\nit shall be passed by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses; but it has\r\na right to demand that the President shall exercise his constitutional\r\npower and arrest it if his judgment is against it. If he surrender this\r\npower, or fail to exercise it in a case where he can not approve, it\r\nwould make his formal approval a mere mockery, and would be itself a\r\nviolation of the Constitution, and the dissenting State would become\r\nbound by a law which had not been passed according to the sanctions of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the exercise of the _veto_ power is founded upon an\r\nidea respecting the popular will, which, if carried out, would\r\nannihilate State sovereignty and substitute for the present Federal\r\nGovernment a consolidation directed by a supposed numerical majority.\r\nA revolution of the Government would be silently effected and the\r\nStates would be subjected to laws to which they had never given their\r\nconstitutional consent.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is invested with the power to\r\ndeclare, and has declared, acts of Congress passed with the concurrence\r\nof the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the approval of the\r\nPresident to be unconstitutional and void, and yet none, it is presumed,\r\ncan be found who will be disposed to strip this highest judicial\r\ntribunal under the Constitution of this acknowledged power--a power\r\nnecessary alike to its independence and the rights of individuals.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason that the Executive veto should, according to the\r\ndoctrine maintained, be rendered nugatory, and be practically expunged\r\nfrom the Constitution, this power of the court should also be rendered\r\nnugatory and be expunged, because it restrains the legislative and\r\nExecutive will, and because the exercise of such a power by the court\r\nmay be regarded as being in conflict with the capacity of the people to\r\ngovern themselves. Indeed, there is more reason for striking this power\r\nof the court from the Constitution than there is that of the qualified\r\nveto of the President, because the decision of the court is final, and\r\ncan never be reversed even though both Houses of Congress and the\r\nPresident should be unanimous in opposition to it, whereas the veto of\r\nthe President may be overruled by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses\r\nof Congress or by the people at the polls.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that to preserve the system established by the\r\nConstitution each of the coordinate branches of the Government--the\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial--must be left in the exercise of\r\nits appropriate powers. If the executive or the judicial branch be\r\ndeprived of powers conferred upon either as checks on the legislative,\r\nthe preponderance of the latter will become disproportionate and\r\nabsorbing and the others impotent for the accomplishment of the great\r\nobjects for which they were established. Organized, as they are, by the\r\nConstitution, they work together harmoniously for the public good. If\r\nthe Executive and the judiciary shall be deprived of the constitutional\r\npowers invested in them, and of their due proportions, the equilibrium\r\nof the system must be destroyed, and consolidation, with the most\r\npernicious results, must ensue--a consolidation of unchecked, despotic\r\npower, exercised by majorities of the legislative branch.\r\n\r\nThe executive, legislative, and judicial each constitutes a separate\r\ncoordinate department of the Government, and each is independent of\r\nthe others. In the performance of their respective duties under the\r\nConstitution neither can in its legitimate action control the others.\r\nThey each act upon their several responsibilities in their respective\r\nspheres. But if the doctrines now maintained be correct, the executive\r\nmust become practically subordinate to the legislative, and the\r\njudiciary must become subordinate to both the legislative and the\r\nexecutive; and thus the whole power of the Government would be merged in\r\na single department. Whenever, if ever, this shall occur, our glorious\r\nsystem of well-regulated self-government will crumble into ruins, to be\r\nsucceeded, first by anarchy, and finally by monarchy or despotism. I am\r\nfar from believing that this doctrine is the sentiment of the American\r\npeople; and during the short period which remains in which it will\r\nbe my duty to administer the executive department it will be my aim to\r\nmaintain its independence and discharge its duties without infringing\r\nupon the powers or duties of either of the other departments of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Executive veto was exercised by the first and most\r\nillustrious of my predecessors and by four of his successors who\r\npreceded me in the administration of the Government, and it is believed\r\nin no instance prejudicially to the public interests. It has never been\r\nand there is but little danger that it ever can be abused. No President\r\nwill ever desire unnecessarily to place his opinion in opposition to\r\nthat of Congress. He must always exercise the power reluctantly, and\r\nonly in cases where his convictions make it a matter of stern duty,\r\nwhich he can not escape. Indeed, there is more danger that the\r\nPresident, from the repugnance he must always feel to come in collision\r\nwith Congress, may fail to exercise it in cases where the preservation\r\nof the Constitution from infraction, or the public good, may demand it\r\nthan that he will ever exercise it unnecessarily or wantonly.\r\n\r\nDuring the period I have administered the executive department of\r\nthe Government great and important questions of public policy, foreign\r\nand domestic, have arisen, upon which it was my duty to act. It may,\r\nindeed, be truly said that my Administration has fallen upon eventful\r\ntimes. I have felt most sensibly the weight of the high responsibilities\r\ndevolved upon me. With no other object than the public good, the\r\nenduring fame, and permanent prosperity of my country, I have pursued\r\nthe convictions of my own best judgment. The impartial arbitrament of\r\nenlightened public opinion, present and future, will determine how far\r\nthe public policy I have maintained and the measures I have from time\r\nto time recommended may have tended to advance or retard the public\r\nprosperity at home and to elevate or depress the estimate of our\r\nnational character abroad.\r\n\r\nInvoking the blessings of the Almighty upon your deliberations at your\r\npresent important session, my ardent hope is that in a spirit of harmony\r\nand concord you may be guided to wise results, and such as may redound\r\nto the happiness, the honor, and the glory of our beloved country.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

Grant (since promoted first\r\nlieutenant), of the Fourth Regiment of Infantry, to be first lieutenant\r\nby brevet for gallant and meritorious services in the battle of\r\nChapultepec, September 13, 1847, as proposed in the accompanying\r\ncommunication from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _December_ 11, _1848_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The brevet of captain conferred on Second Lieutenant Ulysses S.\r\nGrant (since promoted first lieutenant), of the Fourth Regiment of\r\nInfantry, and confirmed by the Senate on the 13th of July, 1848, \"for\r\ngallant and meritorious conduct in the battle of Chapultepec, September\r\n13, 1847,\" being the result of a misapprehension as to the grade held by\r\nthat officer on the 13th of September, 1847 (he being then a second\r\nlieutenant), I have to propose that the brevet of captain be canceled\r\nand that the brevet of first lieutenant \"for gallant and meritorious\r\nservices in the battle of Chapultepec, September 13, 1847,\" be conferred\r\nin lieu thereof.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L. MARCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and advice of the Senate with\r\nregard to its ratification, a treaty concluded on the 6th of August,\r\n1848, by L.E. Powell, on the part of the United States, and the chiefs\r\nand headmen of the confederated bands of the Pawnee Indians, together\r\nwith a report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and other papers\r\nexplanatory of the same.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and advice of the Senate with\r\nregard to its ratification, a treaty concluded on the 18th of October,\r\n1848, by William Medill, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, on the part of\r\nthe United States, and the chiefs and headmen of the Menomonee Indians,\r\ntogether with a report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and other\r\npapers explanatory of the same.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 27, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of the 11th instant,\r\nrequesting the President to inform that body \"whether he has received\r\nany information that American citizens have been imprisoned or arrested\r\nby British authorities in Ireland, and, if so, what have been the causes\r\nthereof and what steps have been taken for their release, and if not, in\r\nhis opinion, inconsistent with public interest to furnish this House\r\nwith copies of all correspondence in relation thereto,\" I communicate\r\nherewith a report of the Secretary of State, together with the\r\naccompanying correspondence upon the subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 27, 1848_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith, in compliance with the request contained in the\r\nresolution of the Senate of the 19th instant, a report of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, with the accompanying statement, prepared by the\r\nRegister of the Treasury, which exhibits the annual amount appropriated\r\non account of the Coast Survey from the commencement of said Survey.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 2, 1849_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 18th\r\nof December, 1848, requesting information \"under what law or provision\r\nof the Constitution, or by what other authority,\" the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, with the \"sanction and approval\" of the President, established\r\n\"a tariff of duties in the ports of the Mexican Republic during the war\r\nwith Mexico,\" and \"by what legal, constitutional, or other authority\"\r\nthe \"revenue thus derived\" was appropriated to \"the support of the Army\r\nin Mexico,\" I refer the House to my annual message of the 7th of\r\nDecember, 1847, to my message to the Senate of the 10th of February,\r\n1848, responding to a call of that body, a copy of which is herewith\r\ncommunicated, and to my message to the House of Representatives of the\r\n24th of July, 1848, responding to a call of that House. The resolution\r\nassumes that the Secretary of the Treasury \"established a tariff of\r\nduties in the ports of the Mexican Republic.\" The contributions\r\ncollected in this mode were not established by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, but by a military order issued by the President through the\r\nWar and Navy Departments. For his information the President directed the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to prepare and report to him a scale of\r\nduties. That report was made, and the President's military order of the\r\n31st of March, 1847, was based upon it. The documents communicated to\r\nCongress with my annual message of December, 1847, show the true\r\ncharacter of that order.\r\n\r\nThe authority under which military contributions were exacted and\r\ncollected from the enemy and applied to the support of our Army during\r\nthe war with Mexico was stated in the several messages referred to. In\r\nthe first of these messages I informed Congress that--\r\n\r\n  On the 31st of March last I caused an order to be issued to our military\r\n  and naval commanders to levy and collect a military contribution upon\r\n  all vessels and merchandise which might enter any of the ports of Mexico\r\n  in our military occupation, and to apply such contributions toward\r\n  defraying the expenses of the war. By virtue of the right of conquest\r\n  and the laws of war, the conqueror, consulting his own safety or\r\n  convenience, may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all\r\n  such ports or permit it upon such terms and conditions as he may\r\n  prescribe. Before the principal ports of Mexico were blockaded by our\r\n  Navy the revenue derived from import duties under the laws of Mexico was\r\n  paid into the Mexican treasury. After these ports had fallen into our\r\n  military possession the blockade was raised and commerce with them\r\n  permitted upon prescribed terms and conditions. They were opened to the\r\n  trade of all nations upon the payment of duties more moderate in their\r\n  amount than those which had been previously levied by Mexico, and the\r\n  revenue, which was formerly paid into the Mexican treasury, was directed\r\n  to be collected by our military and naval officers and applied to the\r\n  use of our Army and Navy. Care was taken that the officers, soldiers,\r\n  and sailors of our Army and Navy should be exempted from the operations\r\n  of the order, and, as the merchandise imported upon which the order\r\n  operated must be consumed by Mexican citizens, the contributions exacted\r\n  were in effect the seizure of the public revenues of Mexico and the\r\n  application of them to our own use. In directing this measure the object\r\n  was to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the\r\n  expenses of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was also stated in that message that--\r\n\r\n  Measures have recently been adopted by which the internal as well as the\r\n  external revenues of Mexico in all places in our military occupation\r\n  will be seized and appropriated to the use of our Army and Navy.\r\n\r\n  The policy of levying upon the enemy contributions in every form\r\n  consistently with the laws of nations, which it may be practicable for\r\n  our military commanders to adopt, should, in my judgment, be rigidly\r\n  enforced, and orders to this effect have accordingly been given. By such\r\n  a policy, at the same time that our own Treasury will be relieved from a\r\n  heavy drain, the Mexican people will be made to feel the burdens of the\r\n  war, and, consulting their own interests, may be induced the more\r\n  readily to requite their rulers to accede to a just peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same message I informed Congress that the amount of the \"loan\"\r\nwhich would be required for the further prosecution of the war might be\r\n\"reduced by whatever amount of expenditures can be saved by military\r\ncontributions collected in Mexico,\" and that \"the most rigorous measures\r\nfor the augmentation of these contributions have been directed, and a\r\nvery considerable sum is expected from that source.\" The Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, in his annual report of that year, in making his estimate\r\nof the amount of loan which would probably be required, reduced the sum\r\nin consideration of the amount which would probably be derived from\r\nthese contributions, and Congress authorized the loan upon this reduced\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nIn the message of the 10th of February, 1848, to the Senate, it was\r\nstated that--\r\n\r\n  No principle is better established than that a nation at war has the\r\n  right of shifting the burden off itself and imposing it on the enemy by\r\n  exacting military contributions. The mode of making such exactions must\r\n  be left to the discretion of the conqueror, but it should be exercised\r\n  in a manner conformable to the rules of civilized warfare.\r\n\r\n  The right to levy these contributions is essential to the successful\r\n  prosecution of war in an enemy's country, and the practice of nations\r\n  has been in accordance with this principle. It is as clearly necessary\r\n  as the right to fight battles, and its exercise is often essential to\r\n  the subsistence of the army.\r\n\r\n  Entertaining no doubt that the military right to exclude commerce\r\n  altogether from the ports of the enemy in our military occupation\r\n  included the minor right of admitting it under prescribed conditions, it\r\n  became an important question at the date of the order whether there\r\n  should be a discrimination between vessels and cargoes belonging to\r\n  citizens of the United States and vessels and cargoes belonging to\r\n  neutral nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the message to the House of Representatives of the 24th of July,\r\n1848, it was stated that--\r\n\r\n  It is from the same source of authority that we derive the unquestioned\r\n  right, after the war has been declared by Congress, to blockade the\r\n  ports and coasts of the enemy, to capture his towns, cities, and\r\n  provinces, and to levy contributions upon him for the support of our\r\n  Army. Of the same character with these is the right to subject to our\r\n  temporary military government the conquered territories of our enemy.\r\n  They are all belligerent rights, and their exercise is as essential to\r\n  the successful prosecution of a foreign war as the right to fight\r\n  battles.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution the power to \"declare war\" is vested in Congress,\r\nand by the same instrument it is provided that \"the President shall be\r\nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\" and that\r\n\"he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Congress have exerted their power by declaring war against a\r\nforeign nation, it is the duty of the President to prosecute it. The\r\nConstitution has prescribed no particular mode in which he shall perform\r\nthis duty. The manner of conducting the war is not defined by the\r\nConstitution. The term _war_ used in that instrument has a\r\nwell-understood meaning among nations. That meaning is derived from the\r\nlaws of nations, a code which is recognized by all civilized powers as\r\nbeing obligatory in a state of war. The power is derived from the\r\nConstitution and the manner of exercising it is regulated by the laws of\r\nnations. When Congress have declared war, they in effect make it the\r\nduty of the President in prosecuting it, by land and sea, to resort to\r\nall the modes and to exercise all the powers and rights which other\r\nnations at war possess. He is invested with the same power in this\r\nrespect as if he were personally present commanding our fleets by sea or\r\nour armies by land. He may conduct the war by issuing orders for\r\nfighting battles, besieging and capturing cities, conquering and holding\r\nthe provinces of the enemy, or by capturing his vessels and other\r\nproperty on the high seas. But these are not the only modes of\r\nprosecuting war which are recognized by the laws of nations and to which\r\nhe is authorized to resort. The levy of contributions on the enemy is a\r\nright of war well established and universally acknowledged among\r\nnations, and one which every belligerent possessing the ability may\r\nproperly exercise. The most approved writers on public law admit and\r\nvindicate this right as consonant with reason, justice, and humanity.\r\n\r\nNo principle is better established than that--\r\n\r\n  We have a right to deprive our enemy of his possessions, of everything\r\n  which may augment his strength and enable him to make war. This everyone\r\n  endeavors to accomplish in the manner most suitable to him. Whenever we\r\n  have an opportunity we seize on the enemy's property and convert it to\r\n  our own use, and thus, besides diminishing the enemy's power, we augment\r\n  our own and obtain at least a partial indemnification or equivalent,\r\n  either for what constitutes the subject of the war or for the expenses\r\n  and losses incurred in its prosecution. In a word, we do ourselves\r\n  justice.\r\n\r\n  \"Instead of the custom of pillaging the open country and defenseless\r\n  places,\" the levy of contributions has been \"substituted.\"\r\n\r\n  Whoever carries on a just war has a right to make the enemy's country\r\n  contribute to the support of his army and toward defraying all the\r\n  charges of the war. Thus he obtains a part of what is due to him, and\r\n  the enemy's subjects, by consenting to pay the sum demanded, have their\r\n  property secured from pillage and the country is preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese principles, it is believed, are uncontroverted by any civilized\r\nnation in modern times. The public law of nations, by which they are\r\nrecognized, has been held by our highest judicial tribunal as a code\r\nwhich is applicable to our \"situation\" in a state of war and binding on\r\nthe United States, while in admiralty and maritime cases it is often the\r\ngoverning rule. It is in a just war that a nation has the \"right to make\r\nthe enemy's country contribute to the support of his army.\" Not doubting\r\nthat our late war with Mexico was just on the part of the United States,\r\nI did not hesitate when charged by the Constitution with its prosecution\r\nto exercise a power common to all other nations, and Congress was duly\r\ninformed of the mode and extent to which that power had been and would\r\nbe exercised at the commencement of their first session thereafter.\r\n\r\nUpon the declaration of war against Mexico by Congress the United States\r\nwere entitled to all the rights which any other nation at war would have\r\npossessed. These rights could only be demanded and enforced by the\r\nPresident, whose duty it was, as \"Commander in Chief of the Army and\r\nNavy of the United States,\" to execute the law of Congress which\r\ndeclared the war. In the act declaring war Congress provided for raising\r\nmen and money to enable the President \"to prosecute it to a speedy and\r\nsuccessful termination.\" Congress prescribed no mode of conducting it,\r\nbut left the President to prosecute it according to the laws of nations\r\nas his guide. Indeed, it would have been impracticable for Congress to\r\nhave provided for all the details of a campaign.\r\n\r\nThe mode of levying contributions must necessarily be left to the\r\ndiscretion of the conqueror, subject to be exercised, however, in\r\nconformity with the laws of nations. It may be exercised by requiring\r\na given sum or a given amount of provisions to be furnished by the\r\nauthorities of a captured city or province; it may be exercised by\r\nimposing an internal tax or a tax on the enemy's commerce, whereby he\r\nmay be deprived of his revenues, and these may be appropriated to the\r\nuse of the conqueror. The latter mode was adopted by the collection of\r\nduties in the ports of Mexico in our military occupation during the late\r\nwar with that Republic.\r\n\r\nSo well established is the military right to do this under the laws of\r\nnations that our military and naval officers commanding our forces on\r\nthe theater of war adopted the same mode of levying contributions from\r\nthe enemy before the order of the President of the 31st of March, 1847,\r\nwas issued. The general in command of the Army at Vera Cruz, upon his\r\nown view of his powers and duties, and without specific instructions to\r\nthat effect, immediately after the capture of that city adopted this\r\nmode. By his order of the 28th of March, 1847, heretofore communicated\r\nto the House of Representatives, he directed a \"temporary and moderate\r\ntariff of duties to be established.\" Such a tariff was established, and\r\ncontributions were collected under it and applied to the uses of our\r\nArmy. At a still earlier period the same power was exercised by the\r\nnaval officers in command of our squadron on the Pacific coast. ...\r\nNot doubting the authority to resort to this mode, the order of the 31st\r\nof March, 1847, was issued, and was in effect but a modification of the\r\nprevious orders of these officers, by making the rates of contribution\r\nuniform and directing their collection in all the ports of the enemy in\r\nour military occupation and under our temporary military government.\r\n\r\nThe right to levy contributions upon the enemy in the form of import and\r\nexport duties in his ports was sanctioned by the treaty of peace with\r\nMexico. By that treaty both Governments recognized ... and confirmed\r\nthe exercise of that right. By its provisions \"the customhouses at all\r\nthe ports occupied by the forces of the United States\" were, upon the\r\nexchange of ratifications, to be delivered up to the Mexican\r\nauthorities, \"together with all bonds and evidences of debt for duties\r\non importations and exportations _not yet fallen due_;\" and \"all duties\r\non imports and on exports collected at such custom-houses or elsewhere\r\nin Mexico by authority of the United States\" before the ratification of\r\nthe treaty by the Mexican Government were to be retained by the United\r\nStates, and only the net amount of the duties collected after this\r\nperiod was to be \"delivered to the Mexican Government.\" By its\r\nprovisions also all merchandise \"imported previously to the restoration\r\nof the custom-houses to the Mexican authorities\" or \"exported from any\r\nMexican port whilst in the occupation of the forces of the United\r\nStates\" was protected from confiscation and from the payment of any\r\nimport or export duties to the Mexican Government, even although the\r\nimportation of such merchandise \"be prohibited by the Mexican tariff.\"\r\nThe treaty also provides that should the custom-houses be surrendered to\r\nthe Mexican authorities in less than sixty days from the date of its\r\nsignature, the rates of duty on merchandise imposed by the United States\r\nwere in that event to survive the war until the end of this period; and\r\nin the meantime Mexican custom-house officers were bound to levy no\r\nother duties thereon \"than the duties established by the tariff found in\r\nforce at such custom-houses at the time of the restoration of the same.\"\r\nThe \"tariff found in force at such custom-houses,\" which is recognized\r\nand sustained by this stipulation, was that established by the military\r\norder of the 31st of March, 1847, as a mode of levying and collecting\r\nmilitary contributions from the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe right to blockade the ports and coasts of the enemy in war is no\r\nmore provided for or prescribed by the Constitution than the right\r\nto levy and collect contributions from him in the form of duties or\r\notherwise, and yet it has not been questioned that the President had the\r\npower after war had been declared by Congress to order our Navy to\r\nblockade the ports and coasts of Mexico. The right in both cases exists\r\nunder the laws of nations. If the President can not order military\r\ncontributions to be collected without an act of Congress, for the same\r\nreason he can not order a blockade; nor can he direct the enemy's\r\nvessels to be captured on the high seas; nor can he order our military\r\nand naval officers to invade the enemy's country, conquer, hold, and\r\nsubject to our military government his cities and provinces; nor can he\r\ngive to our military and naval commanders orders to perform many other\r\nacts essential to success in war.\r\n\r\nIf when the City of Mexico was captured the commander of our forces had\r\nfound in the Mexican treasury public money which the enemy had provided\r\nto support his army, can it be doubted that he possessed the right to\r\nseize and appropriate it for the use of our own Army? If the money\r\ncaptured from the enemy could have been thus lawfully seized and\r\nappropriated, it would have been by virtue of the laws of war,\r\nrecognized by all civilized nations; and by the same authority the\r\nsources of revenue and of supply of the enemy may be cut off from him,\r\nwhereby he may be weakened and crippled in his means of continuing or\r\nwaging the war. If the commanders of our forces, while acting under the\r\norders of the President, in the heart of the enemy's country and\r\nsurrounded by a hostile population, possess none of these essential and\r\nindispensable powers of war, but must halt the Army at every step of its\r\nprogress and wait for an act of Congress to be passed to authorize them\r\nto do that which every other nation has the right to do by virtue of the\r\nlaws of nations, then, indeed, is the Government of the United States in\r\na condition of imbecility and weakness, which must in all future time\r\nrender it impossible to prosecute a foreign war in an enemy's country\r\nsuccessfully or to vindicate the national rights and the national honor\r\nby war.\r\n\r\nThe contributions levied were collected in the enemy's country, and were\r\nordered to be \"applied\" in the enemy's country \"toward defraying the\r\nexpenses of the war,\" and the appropriations made by Congress for that\r\npurpose were thus relieved, and considerable balances remained undrawn\r\nfrom the Treasury. The amount of contributions remaining unexpended at\r\nthe close of the war, as far as the accounts of collecting and\r\ndisbursing officers have been settled, have been paid into the Treasury\r\nin pursuance of an order for that purpose, except the sum \"applied\r\ntoward the payment of the first installment due under the treaty with\r\nMexico,\" as stated in my last annual message, for which an appropriation\r\nhad been made by Congress. The accounts of some of these officers, as\r\nstated in the report of the Secretary of War accompanying that message,\r\nwill require legislation before they can be finally settled.\r\n\r\nIn the late war with Mexico it is confidently believed that the levy of\r\ncontributions and the seizure of the sources of public revenue upon\r\nwhich the enemy relied to enable him to continue the war essentially\r\ncontributed to hasten peace. By those means the Government and people of\r\nMexico were made to feel the pressure of the war and to realize that if\r\nit were protracted its burdens and inconveniences must be borne by\r\nthemselves. Notwithstanding the great success of our arms, it may well\r\nbe doubted whether an honorable peace would yet have been obtained but\r\nfor the very contributions which were exacted.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.

Martin and Albert G. Ellis, commissioners\r\non the part of the United States, and the sachem, councilors, and\r\nheadmen of the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, together with a report of\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs and other papers explanatory of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nJAMES K. POLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 8, 1849_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolutions of the House of Representatives of the 5th\r\ninstant, I communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of State,\r\naccompanied with all the documents and correspondence relating to the\r\ntreaty of peace concluded between the United States and Mexico at\r\nGuadalupe Hidalgo on the 2d February, 1848, and to the amendments of the\r\nSenate thereto, as requested by the House in the said resolutions.\r\n\r\nAmongst the documents transmitted will be found a copy of the\r\ninstructions given to the commissioners of the United States who took to\r\nMexico the treaty as amended by the Senate and ratified by the President\r\nof the United States. In my message to the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 29th of July, 1848, I gave as my reason for declining to furnish\r\nthese instructions in compliance with a resolution of the House that \"in\r\nmy opinion it would be inconsistent with the public interests to give\r\npublicity to them at the present time.\" Although it may still be doubted\r\nwhether giving them publicity in our own country, and, as a necessary\r\nconsequence, in Mexico, may not have a prejudicial influence on our\r\npublic interests, yet, as they have been again called for by the House,\r\nand called for in connection with other documents, to the correct\r\nunderstanding of which they are indispensable, I have deemed it my duty\r\nto transmit them.\r\n\r\nI still entertain the opinion expressed in the message referred to,\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  As a general rule applicable to all our important negotiations with\r\n  foreign powers, it could not fail to be prejudicial to the public\r\n  interests to publish the instructions to our ministers until some time\r\n  had elapsed after the conclusion of such negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these instructions of the 18th of March, 1848, it will be perceived\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  The task was assigned to the commissioners of the United States of\r\n  consummating the treaty of peace, which was signed at Guadalupe Hidalgo\r\n  on the 2d day of February last, between the United States and the\r\n  Mexican Republic, and which on the 10th of March last was ratified by\r\n  the Senate with amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were informed that--\r\n\r\n  This brief statement will indicate to you clearly the line of your duty.\r\n  You are not sent to Mexico for the purpose of negotiating any new\r\n  treaty, or of changing in any particular the ratified treaty which you\r\n  will bear with you. None of the amendments adopted by the Senate can be\r\n  rejected or modified except by the authority of that body. Your whole\r\n  duty will, then, consist in using every honorable effort to obtain from\r\n  the Mexican Government a ratification of the treaty in the form in which\r\n  it has been ratified by the Senate, and this with the least practicable\r\n  delay. ... For this purpose it may, and most probably will, become\r\n  necessary that you should explain to the Mexican minister for foreign\r\n  affairs, or to the authorized agents of the Mexican Government, the\r\n  reasons which have influenced the Senate in adopting these several\r\n  amendments to the treaty. This duty you will perform as much as possible\r\n  by personal conferences. Diplomatic notes are to be avoided unless in\r\n  case of necessity. These might lead to endless discussions and\r\n  indefinite delay. Besides, they could not have any practical result, as\r\n  your mission is confined to procuring a ratification from the Mexican\r\n  Government of the treaty as it came from the Senate, and does not extend\r\n  to the slightest modification in any of its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commissioners were sent to Mexico to procure the ratification of\r\nthe treaty _as amended by the Senate_. Their instructions confined them\r\nto this point. It was proper that the amendments to the treaty adopted\r\nby the United States should be explained to the Mexican Government, and\r\nexplanations were made by the Secretary of State in his letter of the\r\n18th of March, 1848, to the Mexican minister for foreign affairs,\r\nunder my direction. This dispatch was communicated to Congress with my\r\nmessage of the 6th of July last, communicating the treaty of peace,\r\nand published by their order. This dispatch was transmitted by our\r\ncommissioners from the City of Mexico to the Mexican Government, then at\r\nQueretaro, on the 17th of April, 1848, and its receipt acknowledged on\r\nthe 19th of the same month. During the whole time that the treaty, as\r\namended, was before the Congress of Mexico these explanations of the\r\nSecretary of State, and these alone, were before them.\r\n\r\nThe President of Mexico, on these explanations, on the 8th day of May,\r\n1848, submitted the amended treaty to the Mexican Congress, and on the\r\n25th of May that Congress approved the treaty as amended, without\r\nmodification or alteration. The final action of the Mexican Congress\r\nhad taken place before the commissioners of the United States had been\r\nofficially received by the Mexican authorities, or held any conference\r\nwith them, or had any other communication on the subject of the treaty\r\nexcept to transmit the letter of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIn their dispatch transmitted to Congress with my message of the 6th of\r\nJuly last, communicating the treaty of peace, dated \"City of Queretaro,\r\nMay 25, 1848, 9 o'clock p.m.,\" the commissioners say:\r\n\r\n  We have the satisfaction to inform you that we reached this city this\r\n  afternoon at about 5 o'clock, and that the treaty, as amended by the\r\n  Senate of the United States, passed the Mexican Senate about the hour of\r\n  our arrival by a vote of 33 to 5. It having previously passed the House\r\n  of Deputies, nothing now remains but to exchange the ratifications of\r\n  the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next day (the 26th of May) the commissioners were for the first\r\ntime presented to the President of the Republic and their credentials\r\nplaced in his hands. On this occasion the commissioners delivered an\r\naddress to the President of Mexico, and he replied. In their dispatch of\r\nthe 30th of May the commissioners say:\r\n\r\n  We inclose a copy of our address to the President, and also a copy of\r\n  his reply. Several conferences afterwards took place between Messrs.\r\n  Rosa, Cuevas, Conto, and ourselves, which it is not thought necessary to\r\n  recapitulate, as we inclose a copy of the protocol, which contains the\r\n  substance of the conversations. We have now the satisfaction to announce\r\n  that the exchange of ratifications was effected to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dispatch was communicated with my message of the 6th of July last,\r\nand published by order of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe treaty, as amended by the Senate of the United States, with the\r\naccompanying papers and the evidence that in that form it had been\r\nratified by Mexico, was received at Washington on the 4th day of July,\r\n1848, and immediately proclaimed as the supreme law of the land. On the\r\n6th of July I communicated to Congress the ratified treaty, with such\r\naccompanying documents as were deemed material to a full understanding\r\nof the subject, to the end that Congress might adopt the legislation\r\nnecessary and proper to carry the treaty into effect. Neither the\r\naddress of the commissioners, nor the reply of the President of\r\nMexico on the occasion of their presentation, nor the memorandum of\r\nconversations embraced in the paper called a protocol, nor the\r\ncorrespondence now sent, were communicated, because they were not\r\nregarded as in any way material; and in this I conformed to the\r\npractice of our Government. It rarely, if ever, happens that all the\r\ncorrespondence, and especially the instructions to our ministers, is\r\ncommunicated. Copies of these papers are now transmitted, as being\r\nwithin the resolutions of the House calling for all such \"correspondence\r\nas appertains to said treaty.\"\r\n\r\nWhen these papers were received at Washington, peace had been restored,\r\nthe first installment of three millions paid to Mexico, the blockades\r\nwere raised, the City of Mexico evacuated, and our troops on their\r\nreturn home. The war was at an end, and the treaty, as ratified by the\r\nUnited States, was binding on both parties, and already executed in a\r\ngreat degree. In this condition of things it was not competent for the\r\nPresident alone, or for the President and Senate, or for the President,\r\nSenate, and House of Representatives combined, to abrogate the treaty,\r\nto annul the peace and restore a state of war, except by a solemn\r\ndeclaration of war.\r\n\r\nHad the protocol varied the treaty as amended by the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, it would have had no binding effect.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that the commissioners of the United States did not\r\nregard the protocol as in any degree a part of the treaty, nor as\r\nmodifying or altering the treaty as amended by the Senate. They\r\ncommunicated it as the substance of conversations held after the Mexican\r\nCongress had ratified the treaty, and they knew that the approval of the\r\nMexican Congress was as essential to the validity of a treaty in all its\r\nparts as the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States. They\r\nknew, too, that they had no authority to alter or modify the treaty in\r\nthe form in which it had been ratified by the United States, but that,\r\nif failing to procure the ratification of the Mexican Government\r\notherwise than with amendments, their duty, imposed by express\r\ninstructions, was to ask of Mexico to send without delay a commissioner\r\nto Washington to exchange ratifications here if the amendments of the\r\ntreaty proposed by Mexico, on being submitted, should be adopted by the\r\nSenate of the United States.\r\n\r\nI was equally well satisfied that the Government of Mexico had agreed to\r\nthe treaty as amended by the Senate of the United States, and did not\r\nregard the protocol as modifying, enlarging, or diminishing its terms or\r\neffect. The President of that Republic, in submitting the amended treaty\r\nto the Mexican Congress, in his message on the 8th day of May, 1848,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  If the treaty could have been submitted to your deliberation precisely\r\n  as it came from the hands of the plenipotentiaries, my satisfaction at\r\n  seeing the war at last brought to an end would not have been lessened as\r\n  it this day is in consequence of the modifications introduced into it by\r\n  the Senate of the United States, and which have received the sanction of\r\n  the President. ... At present it is sufficient for us to say to you\r\n  that if in the opinion of the Government justice had not been evinced\r\n  on the part of the Senate and Government of the United States in\r\n  introducing such modifications, it is presumed, on the other hand, that\r\n  they are not of such importance that they should set aside the treaty.\r\n  I believe, on the contrary, that it ought to be ratified upon the same\r\n  terms in which it has already received the sanction of the American\r\n  Government. My opinion is also greatly strengthened by the fact that a\r\n  new negotiation is neither expected nor considered, possible. Much less\r\n  could another be brought forward upon a basis more favorable for the\r\n  Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the Mexican Congress, with no explanation before\r\nthat body from the United States except the letter of the Secretary of\r\nState, resulted in the ratification of the treaty, as recommended by the\r\nPresident of that Republic, in the form in which it had been amended and\r\nratified by the United States. The conversations embodied in the paper\r\ncalled a protocol took place after the action of the Mexican Congress\r\nwas complete, and there is no reason to suppose that the Government of\r\nMexico ever submitted the protocol to the Congress, or ever treated or\r\nregarded it as in any sense a new negotiation, or as operating any\r\nmodification or change of the amended treaty. If such had been its\r\neffect, it was a nullity until approved by the Mexican Congress; and\r\nsuch approval was never made or intimated to the United States. In the\r\nfinal consummation of the ratification of the treaty by the President of\r\nMexico no reference is made to it. On the contrary, this ratification,\r\nwhich was delivered to the commissioners of the United States, and is\r\nnow in the State Department, contains a full and explicit recognition of\r\nthe amendments of the Senate just as they had been communicated to that\r\nGovernment by the Secretary of State and been afterwards approved by the\r\nMexican Congress. It declares that--\r\n\r\n  Having seen and examined the said treaty and the modifications made by\r\n  the Senate of the United States of America, and having given an account\r\n  thereof to the General Congress, conformably to the requirement in the\r\n  fourteenth paragraph of the one hundred and tenth article of the federal\r\n  constitution of these United States, that body has thought proper to\r\n  approve of the said treaty, with the modifications thereto, in all their\r\n  parts; and in consequence thereof, exerting the power granted to me by\r\n  the constitution, I accept, ratify, and confirm the said treaty with its\r\n  modifications, and promise, in the name of the Mexican Republic, to\r\n  fulfill and observe it, and to cause it to be fulfilled and observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon an examination of this protocol, when it was received with the\r\nratified treaty, I did not regard it as material or as in any way\r\nattempting to modify or change the treaty as it had been amended by the\r\nSenate of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first explanation which it contains is:\r\n\r\n  That the American Government, by suppressing the ninth article of the\r\n  treaty of Guadalupe and substituting the third article of the treaty of\r\n  Louisiana, did not intend to diminish in any way what was agreed upon\r\n  by the aforesaid article (ninth) in favor of the inhabitants of the\r\n  territories ceded by Mexico. Its understanding is that all of that\r\n  agreement is contained in the third article of the treaty of Louisiana.\r\n  In consequence, all the privileges and guaranties--civil, political,\r\n  and religious--which would have been possessed by the inhabitants of\r\n  the ceded territories if the ninth article of the treaty had been\r\n  retained will be enjoyed by them without any difference under the\r\n  article which has been substituted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ninth article of the original treaty stipulated for the\r\nincorporation of the Mexican inhabitants of the ceded territories and\r\ntheir admission into the Union \"as soon as possible, according to the\r\nprinciples of the Federal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all the\r\nrights of citizens of the United States.\" It provided also that in the\r\nmeantime they should be maintained in the enjoyment of their liberty,\r\ntheir property, and their civil rights now vested in them according to\r\nthe Mexican laws. It secured to them similar political rights with the\r\ninhabitants of the other Territories of the United States, and at least\r\nequal to the inhabitants of Louisiana and Florida when they were in a\r\nTerritorial condition. It then proceeded to guarantee that ecclesiastics\r\nand religious corporations should be protected in the discharge of the\r\noffices of their ministry and the enjoyment of their property of every\r\nkind, whether individual or corporate, and, finally, that there should\r\nbe a free communication between the Catholics of the ceded territories\r\nand their ecclesiastical authorities \"even although such authority\r\nshould reside within the limits of the Mexican Republic as defined by\r\nthis treaty.\"\r\n\r\nThe ninth article of the treaty, as adopted by the Senate, is much more\r\ncomprehensive in its terms and explicit in its meaning, and it clearly\r\nembraces in comparatively few words all the guaranties inserted in the\r\noriginal article. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Mexicans who, in the territories aforesaid, shall not preserve the\r\n  character of citizens of the Mexican Republic, conformably with what\r\n  is stipulated in the preceding article, shall be incorporated into the\r\n  Union of the United States and be admitted at the proper time (to be\r\n  judged of by the Congress of the United States) to the enjoyment of all\r\n  the rights of citizens of the United States, according to the principles\r\n  of the Constitution, and in the meantime shall be maintained and\r\n  protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and\r\n  secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article, which was substantially copied from the Louisiana treaty,\r\nprovides equally with the original article for the admission of these\r\ninhabitants into the Union, and in the meantime, whilst they shall\r\nremain in a Territorial state, by one sweeping provision declares that\r\nthey \"shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their\r\nliberty and property and secured in the free exercise of their religion\r\nwithout restriction.\"\r\n\r\nThis guaranty embraces every kind of property, whether held by\r\necclesiastics or laymen, whether belonging to corporations or\r\nindividuals. It secures to these inhabitants the free exercise of their\r\nreligion without restriction, whether they choose to place themselves\r\nunder the spiritual authority of pastors resident within the Mexican\r\nRepublic or the ceded territories. It was, it is presumed, to place this\r\nconstruction beyond all question that the Senate superadded the words\r\n\"without restriction\" to the religious guaranty contained in the\r\ncorresponding article of the Louisiana treaty. Congress itself does not\r\npossess the power under the Constitution to make any law prohibiting the\r\nfree exercise of religion.\r\n\r\nIf the ninth article of the treaty, whether in its original or amended\r\nform, had been entirely omitted in the treaty, all the rights and\r\nprivileges which either of them confers would have been secured to the\r\ninhabitants of the ceded territories by the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe protocol asserts that \"the American Government, by suppressing the\r\ntenth article of the treaty of Guadalupe, did not in any way intend to\r\nannul the grants of lands made by Mexico in the ceded territories;\" that\r\n\"these grants, notwithstanding the suppression of the article of the\r\ntreaty, preserve the legal value which they may possess; and the\r\ngrantees may cause their legitimate titles to be acknowledged before the\r\nAmerican tribunals;\" and then proceeds to state that, \"conformably to\r\nthe law of the United States, legitimate titles to every description of\r\nproperty, personal and real, existing in the ceded territories are those\r\nwhich were legitimate titles under the Mexican law in California and New\r\nMexico up to the 13th of May, 1846, and in Texas up to the 2d of March,\r\n1836.\" The former was the date of the declaration of war against Mexico\r\nand the latter that of the declaration of independence by Texas.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the tenth article of the original treaty was not that\r\nit protected legitimate titles, which our laws would have equally\r\nprotected without it, but that it most unjustly attempted to resuscitate\r\ngrants which had become a mere nullity by allowing the grantees the same\r\nperiod after the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty to which\r\nthey had been originally entitled after the date of their grants for the\r\npurpose of performing the conditions on which they had been made. In\r\nsubmitting the treaty to the Senate I had recommended the rejection of\r\nthis article. That portion of it in regard to lands in Texas did not\r\nreceive a single vote in the Senate. This information was communicated\r\nby the letter of the Secretary of State to the minister for foreign\r\naffairs of Mexico, and was in possession of the Mexican Government\r\nduring the whole period the treaty was before the Mexican Congress; and\r\nthe article itself was reprobated in that letter in the strongest terms.\r\nBesides, our commissioners to Mexico had been instructed that--\r\n\r\n  Neither the President nor the Senate of the United States can ever\r\n  consent to ratify any treaty containing the tenth article of the treaty\r\n  of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in favor of grantees of land in Texas or\r\n  elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n  Should the Mexican Government persist in retaining this article, then\r\n  all prospect of immediate peace is ended; and of this you may give\r\n  them an absolute assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this point the language of the protocol is free from ambiguity, but\r\nif it were otherwise is there any individual American or Mexican who\r\nwould place such a construction upon it as to convert it into a vain\r\nattempt to revive this article, which had been so often and so solemnly\r\ncondemned? Surely no person could for one moment suppose that either the\r\ncommissioners of the United States or the Mexican minister for foreign\r\naffairs ever entertained the purpose of thus setting at naught the\r\ndeliberate decision of the President and Senate, which had been\r\ncommunicated to the Mexican Government with the assurance that their\r\nabandonment of this obnoxious article was essential to the restoration\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nBut the meaning of the protocol is plain. It is simply that the\r\nnullification of this article was not intended to destroy valid,\r\nlegitimate titles to land which existed and were in full force\r\nindependently of the provisions and without the aid of this article.\r\nNotwithstanding it has been expunged from the treaty, these grants were\r\nto \"preserve the legal value which they may possess.\" The refusal to\r\nrevive grants which had become extinct was not to invalidate those which\r\nwere in full force and vigor. That such was the clear understanding of\r\nthe Senate of the United States, and this in perfect accordance with the\r\nprotocol, is manifest from the fact that whilst they struck from the\r\ntreaty this unjust article, they at the same time sanctioned and\r\nratified the last paragraph of the eighth article of the treaty, which\r\ndeclares that--\r\n\r\n  In the said territories property of every kind now belonging to Mexicans\r\n  not established there shall be inviolably respected. The present owners,\r\n  the heirs of these, and all Mexicans who may hereafter acquire said\r\n  property by contract shall enjoy with respect to it guaranties equally\r\n  ample as if the same belonged to citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout any stipulation in the treaty to this effect, all such valid\r\ntitles under the Mexican Government would have been protected under the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe third and last explanation contained in the protocol is that--\r\n\r\n  The Government of the United States, by suppressing the concluding\r\n  paragraph of article 12 of the treaty, did not intend to deprive the\r\n  Mexican Republic of the free and unrestrained faculty of ceding,\r\n  conveying, or transferring at any time (as it may judge best) the sum of\r\n  the $12,000,000 which the same Government of the United States is to\r\n  deliver in the places designated by the amended article.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concluding paragraph of the original twelfth article, thus\r\nsuppressed by the Senate, is in the following language:\r\n\r\n  Certificates in proper form for the said installments, respectively,\r\n  in such sums as shall be desired by the Mexican Government, and\r\n  transferable by it, shall be delivered to the said Government by that\r\n  of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this bare statement, of facts the meaning of the protocol is\r\nobvious. Although the Senate had declined to create a Government stock\r\nfor the $12,000,000, and issue transferable certificates for the amount\r\nin such sums as the Mexican Government might desire, yet they could not\r\nhave intended thereby to deprive that Government of the faculty which\r\nevery creditor possesses of transferring for his own benefit the\r\nobligation of his debtor, whatever this may be worth, according to his\r\nwill and pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that the twelfth article of the treaty as it\r\nnow stands contains a positive obligation, \"in consideration of the\r\nextension acquired by the boundaries of the United States,\" to pay to\r\nthe Mexican Republic $12,000,000 in four equal annual installments of\r\nthree millions each. This obligation may be assigned by the Mexican\r\nGovernment to any person whatever, but the assignee in such case would\r\nstand in no better condition than the Government. The amendment of the\r\nSenate prohibiting the issue of a Government transferable stock for the\r\namount produces this effect and no more.\r\n\r\nThe protocol contains nothing from which it can be inferred that the\r\nassignee could rightfully demand the payment of the money in case the\r\nconsideration should fail which is stated on the face of the obligation.\r\n\r\nWith this view of the whole protocol, and considering that the\r\nexplanations which it contained were in accordance with the treaty, I\r\ndid not deem it necessary to take any action upon the subject. Had it\r\nvaried from the terms of the treaty as amended by the Senate, although\r\nit would even then have been a nullity in itself, yet duty might have\r\nrequired that I should make this fact known to the Mexican Government,\r\nThis not being the case, I treated it in the same manner I would have\r\ndone had these explanations been made verbally by the commissioners to\r\nthe Mexican minister for foreign affairs and communicated in a dispatch\r\nto the State Department.\r\n\r\nJAMES K.
