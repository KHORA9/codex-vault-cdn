Inconsistencies in punctuation kept as in\r\n   original.\r\n Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation made consistent, e.g.: handbook,\r\n   shipboard, to-day, chargé(s) d’affaires.\r\n Spelling of Quebec and Colombia made consistent, but otherwise\r\n   spellings of city and country names left as printed in the original.\r\n Unclear name suffix in the original was confirmed as Jacob Meyer Jr.\r\n   elsewhere.\r\n Page number in Table of Contents for Lecture III—Consular\r\n   Service—Duties changed to 83 to match actual start of chapter.\r\n The Diplomatic Service and Consular Service tables in the Appendix have\r\n   footnotes that are referenced in multiple entries across the original\r\n   pages in the text. Rather than retain multiple footnotes with\r\n   identical content, multiple anchors in the text may refer to a single\r\n   note.\r\n P. 208 in the original indicates a footnote * that has no corresponding\r\n   anchor on that page, so it does not appear here.\r\n The column headers with vertical text in the Synopsis of Commercial\r\n   Treaties table on pp. 212-213 have been moved to a Key.\r\n The Synopsis of Commercial Treaties table uses Unicode characters\r\n   dagger (U+2020) and double dagger (U+2021). If the device font does\r\n   not support these characters, † and ‡, they may not appear correctly.\r\n Indent of Lethbridge, Alberta in table on p. 226 made to match\r\n   surrounding entries since it falls in alphabetical order of those.\r\n If the device allows, some full page images can be clicked on to view a\r\n   larger version.\r\n Italic text indicated by underscores surrounding _italic text_.\r\n Small capitals have been converted to ALL CAPS.\r\n Some descriptions of illustrations have been added.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           UNCLE SAM ABROAD.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frontispiece - Uncle Sam carrying suitcase]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Uncle Sam\r\n                           Abroad\r\n                           By J.

Instead, however, he chose a method to which he\r\nwas more accustomed, the “university extension” plan, aiming primarily\r\nto stimulate interest in his subject, and secondarily, in some small\r\nmeasure to gratify it.\r\n\r\nThe reader is indebted to the notes of a shorthand reporter who happened\r\nto hear the entire course, both for the text here given and for the\r\nillustrations with which it is adorned. If he thinks that the latter are\r\nnot always in harmony with the text he must remember that the Professor\r\nand the Scribe did not see things from the same standpoint. Moreover he\r\nmust not hold the Professor too strictly to account for his language,\r\nfor it is not to be wondered at if he occasionally forgets himself and\r\nuses large words, which might be considered out of place in a popular\r\nlecture; and again, in his effort to impart life and present-day\r\ninterest to his subject he at times introduces a levity which he hopes\r\nwill not too seriously offend the sober-minded, or make them distrust\r\nhis statements of fact.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the first lecture the speaker, having been presented\r\nwith the usual complimentary remarks, first spoke briefly in explanation\r\nof the nature of the course and of such courses in general. He mentioned\r\namong other matters that syllabi or leaflets containing outlines of the\r\nlectures, together with copies of the “Diplomatic and Consular\r\nRegister,” would be distributed to all in attendance. He also announced\r\nthat opportunity would be given at the close of each lecture for\r\nquestions from the audience, and he promised to attempt to answer the\r\nsame. Then he turned to the subject of the evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\r\n]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Scribe]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Man standing next to table with pitcher and glass]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LECTURE I\r\n\r\n                         THE STATE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nWhat is the attitude of Great Britain, Germany, France, Russia or the\r\nUnited States upon this or that question?\r\n\r\nSuch a query you often hear, and perhaps you stop to wonder how it is\r\nwhen the collective opinion of any one country cannot be known in a\r\nshort time, that there can be such a thing as a German attitude, an\r\nEnglish or an American attitude, or who has a right to determine upon\r\nthis or that as our attitude.\r\n\r\nWell, it is evident that in domestic affairs, that is to say in national\r\naffairs, we as a people can take time to deliberate and choose our path;\r\nand it is just as evident that in international affairs we cannot always\r\ndo so. “It is the unexpected that happens”, and we must have some means\r\nof meeting emergencies that will not wait. Hence a free people is least\r\nfree, theoretically, when it has to do with the claims of treaties and\r\ninternational law, for it cannot take time to consider and decide upon\r\nall the facts; nay, even legislatures may interfere seriously with the\r\nproper discharge of such duties; so that in actual practice, even the\r\nmost democratic nations have found it best to entrust the management of\r\nforeign affairs, or in other words, the preservation of their national\r\nequilibrium, to a Premier, Chancellor or Foreign Secretary, who is\r\ngenerally the ablest statesman that the country can afford.\r\n\r\nThis officer, with slightly differing functions, is known in our country\r\nas the Secretary of State, and he presides over the State Department.\r\nProbably there is no office under our Constitution that requires greater\r\nsagacity, greater breadth of intellectual grasp and practical training\r\nthan this one of Secretary of State, and the fact that it has been held\r\nby such men as Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, James Madison, James\r\nMonroe, John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun,\r\nWilliam H. Seward and James G. Blaine is sufficient evidence of its\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIt was intended at first that the cabinet officers should be as nearly\r\nequal as possible, and the salaries were fixed and remain the same to\r\nthis day; but in the nature of the case they could not remain of equal\r\nimportance, for the Department of State is more intimately associated\r\nwith the President than any other. Washington would not allow foreign\r\nministers to address him—they must reach him properly through the State\r\nDepartment,—hence, if for no other reason, it is easy to see how the\r\nSecretary of State assumed an official dignity that does not belong to\r\nthe other cabinet officers.\r\n\r\nLet us see how he stands related to the general government. Suppose we\r\nassume the attitude of an intelligent foreigner, looking at the “Great\r\nRepublic” from the outside, and trying to discover into whose hands the\r\nlogical working out of the Constitution has placed the real power.\r\n\r\nIt has been said[1] that we will at length discover that in all ordinary\r\ntimes of peace the government is practically in the hands of six men,\r\nnamely,—\r\n\r\n  the President and two men whom he appoints—\r\n  the Secretary of State, and\r\n  the Secretary of the Treasury;\r\n  the Speaker and two men whom he appoints—\r\n  the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, and\r\n  the Chairman of the Committee of Appropriations.\r\n\r\nOf these six, one-half are concerned with the finances of the\r\ngovernment; and of the other half, one is the Chief Executive, another\r\nmay be called the chief legislative factor, while the third is our\r\nofficial representative to the rest of the world. This practical\r\ndivision of the functions of government does not seem to agree very well\r\nwith the more theoretical division into legislative, executive and\r\njudicial. In other words, finance has assumed an importance it was not\r\nintended to have, just as was observed concerning the Secretary of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  See “American Diplomacy,” by Eugene Schuyler.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may seem rather strange to speak of one of our officials as the chief\r\n_social_ functionary in our governmental machinery, but we have such a\r\none, and he is no other than the Secretary of State. The office of\r\nfunctionary host for the government might be supposed to belong\r\nnaturally to the President, who is spared this duty, however, owing to\r\nthe multiplicity of others that are unavoidable. Consequently the\r\nSecretary of State, because of the breadth of the field of his\r\noperations, bringing him into touch with representatives of other\r\nnations as well as the principal statesmen of our own, and because,\r\nmoreover, diplomacy’s natural atmosphere has always been that of\r\nsociety, must “keep open house”, as it were, for the Republic. This\r\nalone would be a sufficient burden for any one man, but it is expected\r\nthat the Assistant Secretaries of State shall share it with him. Thus\r\nour Secretary maintains the only semblance of a court that will be\r\ntolerated by our “fierce democracie”, and even for this we do not\r\ncontribute a cent of support, though around it and through it operate\r\nvast interests, both national and international. It is a manifest\r\ninjustice to these officials that we do not provide for such legitimate\r\nexpenses as must necessarily occur on these semi-official, semi-social\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow let us see what is the scope of the State Department, for it is much\r\nmore than a foreign office, though that is its principle function. It\r\nembraces the duties which in other countries are given to the Keeper of\r\nthe Seal, the Minister of Justice, etc., such as—\r\n\r\n  (1) keeping, promulgating and publishing the laws,\r\n  (2) custody of the Great Seal,\r\n  (3) preservation of the Government Archives, and\r\n  (4) charge of all official relations between the general Government\r\n  and the several States.\r\n\r\nIts scope is more particularly indicated by the bureaus into which it is\r\ndivided, namely,—\r\n\r\n  the Bureau of Indexes and Archives;\r\n  the Bureau of Accounts of the State Department;\r\n  the Bureau of Rolls and Library;\r\n  the Bureau of Appointments;\r\n  the Bureau of Statistics, or Foreign Commerce;\r\n  the Consular Bureau;\r\n  the Diplomatic Bureau.\r\n\r\nEach of these bureaus is presided over by a chief, and at the head of\r\nthem all is the chief clerk, who is “the executive officer of the\r\nDepartment of State under the direction of the Secretary.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Indexes and Archives is a sort of postoffice and\r\nrecorder’s office combined, for it receives the incoming mail, opens it\r\nand classifies it as either diplomatic, consular or miscellaneous, then\r\nindexes it so that if necessary it can be readily traced, and then turns\r\nover to the Chief Clerk the diplomatic correspondence and the more\r\nimportant consular and miscellaneous correspondence. This the Chief\r\nClerk reads, and the most important is submitted to the Assistant\r\nSecretaries of State, while the remainder is turned over to the various\r\nbureaus for their attention. Likewise after the Secretary and his\r\nAssistants have signified the replies which are to be made to the most\r\nimportant of the mail and have examined and signed the same, it is\r\ncollected from all the bureaus, and the out-going mail is indexed in\r\nanother set of books.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Accounts of the State Department classifies its business\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n(1) International indemnities, or trust funds. If you are an American\r\ncitizen living abroad and suffer a loss of property unlawfully, you may\r\nexpect the loss to be made good through this Bureau of Accounts; that is\r\nunless you happen to be a missionary, for Uncle Sam doesn’t always\r\nextend, or try to extend, to missionaries the same protection that is\r\nenjoyed by other citizens living abroad.\r\n\r\n(2) Diplomatic and consular accounts, i. e., the salaries paid to these\r\nofficers, together with all expenses incidental to the service.\r\n\r\n(3) Accounts of the Department proper.\r\n\r\n(4) Passports. If you wish to secure passports before going abroad, it\r\nmust be done through the State Department, as they are issued nowhere\r\nelse in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe telegraphic correspondence of the State Department, mostly in\r\ncipher, is conducted by this bureau.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Rolls and Library has the custody of the laws and treaties\r\nof the United States, together with the Revolutionary archives, etc. Its\r\nchief business is the “publication of the laws, treaties, proclamations\r\nand executive orders, work which must be performed with the utmost\r\nattainable promptness, speed and accuracy”, and its busy time is just\r\nafter the adjournment of Congress. It is this Bureau that is honored\r\nwith the custody of the original draft of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. It also has charge of the following:\r\n\r\n  The records and papers of the Continental Congress,\r\n  The Washington papers,\r\n  The Madison papers,\r\n  The Jefferson papers,\r\n  The Hamilton papers,\r\n  The Monroe papers,\r\n  The Franklin papers,\r\n  The papers of the Quartermaster General’s Department during the\r\n  Revolutionary period.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Appointments receives applications and recommendations for\r\noffice. It issues commissions, exequaturs and warrants of\r\nextradition—terms to be explained in connection with the consular\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIt also has charge of the Great Seal of the United States, a symbol of\r\nauthority which has been carefully guarded by one faithful man for\r\nnearly fifty-three years.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Statistics, or of Foreign Commerce as it is now called,\r\ntakes charge of the data gathered all over the world by the consular\r\nservice. Whatever is of immediate importance is published without delay\r\nin the “Advance Sheets” of the Consular Reports, and these are\r\ndistributed to boards of trade, the press and elsewhere. This prompt\r\ndistribution of valuable information was begun in January, 1898, and\r\nsince that time the American system of Consular Reports is freely\r\nacknowledged the best in the world.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Consular Bureau is charged with correspondence with the consular\r\nservice. The variety of this correspondence cannot be guessed by those\r\nunfamiliar with the Consular Reports, but its extent may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that out of 1,000 officers in this service, perhaps half\r\nof them correspond with the Department. In addition to the above, this\r\nbureau has much to do by way of interview with consular officers coming\r\nand going. Moreover, this bureau has charge of examinations of\r\napplicants, and after a candidate is appointed it furnishes the\r\nparticular instructions for the position in view. This Bureau must keep\r\nitself informed as to the personnel of the service, and must even send\r\ninspectors to the various consulates and report thereupon. “Recently”,\r\nwe are told, “the Chief of the Bureau personally visited over one\r\nhundred consulates in Cuba, Mexico, Canada, Europe, India, China, and\r\nJapan”.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLast and most important of all, politically, is the Diplomatic Bureau.\r\nIts dealings are with our own diplomatic officials at foreign capitals,\r\nand with foreign diplomats at Washington. It is chiefly concerned, as we\r\nare told, with the “examination, consideration and discussion of\r\ndiplomatic subjects, such as treaties, claims, questions of\r\ninternational law, and policy, etc.”\r\n\r\nSo this last sentence is the only tantalizing peep we are allowed to\r\nhave within the sanctuary of the State Department. This Bureau with\r\nwhich the Secretary and his three Assistants are chiefly concerned\r\nshares its secrets with very few. The expediency of observing secrecy in\r\ninternational politics was noticed before; but there is another side to\r\nthe question which most of us see and perhaps some of us talk about, and\r\nthat is the point in negotiations at which the government may take the\r\npublic into its confidence.\r\n\r\nFor the public feels, and has a right to feel, that it has a proprietary\r\ninterest in public affairs. More than this, it is in an unhealthy state\r\nwhen it doesn’t feel such an interest. The public, at least the\r\nenlightened public, knows that secrecy is apt to be troublesome\r\nanywhere, especially in government. It knows of many a historic instance\r\nof corruption fostered by secrecy, of intrigue, cabal, plot and\r\ncounterplot, until the whole fabric of the state became vitiated. The\r\npublic,—that is, the American public,—may have some reason to dread\r\nsecrecy in local government, for many an alderman wants nothing better\r\nthan to be let alone, and many a “convention boss” with a few “ring”\r\nassociates would prefer to “fix the ticket” without any inspection by\r\nthe public whom he expects in a few days to browbeat into supporting it.\r\n\r\nGranting that we haven’t been watchful enough as to local politics, how\r\nis it nationally? How about the Department of State—for that alone is\r\nthe place where secrecy is justifiable?\r\n\r\nIt was said by an authority on American diplomacy about fifteen years\r\nago that “there is scarcely a country, even Russia or Germany, where so\r\nlittle is known by the public of the negotiations carried on at any one\r\ntime by the Secretary of State”. What did this indicate? the efficiency\r\nof our government as a negotiating machine? Did it indicate an\r\nindifference of our people to their welfare? Well, however it may have\r\nbeen at that time, it is certain that there has been a growing and\r\ninsistent demand during the present decade that negotiations shall be\r\nrevealed at the earliest possible moment. Public opinion has even been\r\nknown to dictate foreign policy—nay, more, to reverse it after it had\r\nonce been determined upon by the State Department, as in the case of the\r\nnotorious “Queen Lil”. Indeed, this instance in our diplomatic history\r\nshows very satisfactorily that no administration can stand or ought to\r\nstand against the overwhelming volume of enlightened public opinion\r\nraised against an unpopular measure or a distrusted service. The public\r\nis bound to know whenever it can, and when it can not it is bound to\r\nguess, and its guessing may be more disturbing to foreign negotiations\r\nthan a knowledge of the facts. Thus, while it may not always be able to\r\ndetermine the course of negotiations, it is always in its power to\r\nseriously affect them and ultimately to overthrow them.\r\n\r\nBut such cases as that of the Hawaiian queen are rare, and the American\r\npublic fortunately has seldom had reason to apprehend that state affairs\r\nwere being grossly mismanaged. Perhaps, on the other hand, it has needed\r\nat times to be cautioned against over-insistence upon its right to\r\nnews—a vulgar itching for a sensational stimulant. Perhaps it has needed\r\nthe reminder that it “had its say”, directly or indirectly, in the\r\nchoice of officers, and that having chosen them, it should, as a rule,\r\nreserve criticism until election time returns; for between an eternal\r\n“nagging” of public officials and a profound indifference to public\r\naffairs there isn’t much to choose. The New England town-meeting has\r\noften been justly commended for cultivating an interest in public\r\naffairs; but, on the other hand, it frequently sets up its select-men\r\nmerely to be targets of abuse. No nation and no community can have, or\r\ndeserves to have, the best possible government when its officials are\r\nsubjected to a perpetual cross fire of criticism.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State should have as free a hand as possible in the\r\ngreat game of world politics, for the state being a gigantic business\r\nfirm, must, like all such firms, keep its business to itself.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a standing objection to federal governments such as\r\nours that they are “weak in the conduct of foreign affairs”, the\r\nimputation being that they are weak because the Secretary of State lacks\r\nthe initiative afforded by a more centralized government. But, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the same official in England, France, Italy, or Spain,\r\nis more likely to be called upon for the progress of foreign\r\nnegotiations than in our own country.\r\n\r\nBut the Constitution does not grant the Secretary, that is to say, the\r\nExecutive, entire freedom in foreign affairs, for it explicitly states\r\nthat “_the President shall have power, by and with the consent and\r\nadvice of the Senate_, to make treaties ... to appoint ambassadors,\r\nother public ministers and consuls,” etc. However, this restraint is not\r\nalways irksome, and it may sometimes prove salutary. It is always a\r\nmeasure of assurance to the people that the administration will not\r\ncommit the government to an unwise policy; and more than this, it is an\r\nassurance to a power with which we may be dealing that the result of the\r\nnegotiations is not likely to be repudiated by the people when the chief\r\nexecutive is backed by the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe Senate entrusts its diplomatic functions, except in the ratification\r\nof treaties and the approval of the appointments of ambassadors, to its\r\nCommittee on Foreign Affairs. This Committee leaves the initiative in\r\ndiplomacy to the State Department, taking care, nevertheless, to keep\r\ntrack of any negotiations that may be pending. Whenever the Senate\r\nwishes to know the progress of negotiations it passes resolutions\r\ncalling for them, the Chief Clerk of the Department gets them ready, and\r\nthe Senate then meets in closed session during their consideration. Thus\r\ndiplomatic business is fairly well guarded and at the same time a\r\nreassuring degree of legislative oversight is maintained. To be sure, we\r\nhear more or less criticism of Senate control, which in the nature of\r\nthe case must mean a sacrifice of expediency, yet it remains to be seen\r\nwhether or not our system is too cumbersome for prompt, prudent and\r\nadroit statesmanship when brought into closer rivalry with Europe.\r\n\r\nFor there is no doubt that for good or for ill we are entering upon a\r\ndegree of activity in world politics such as we have never known\r\nheretofore. Consequently it becomes a matter of the highest necessity\r\nthat our whole diplomatic machinery be in a condition to afford the\r\ngreatest utility. Diplomacy in these modern times is said to be the art\r\nof maintaining peace; but it sometimes implies a rivalry, nevertheless,\r\nwhich is far from pacific. We should remember, therefore, that European\r\ndiplomats have behind them the advantage of many years of study of their\r\ngreat problems from their own standpoint and the judgment of men of the\r\ngreatest sagacity upon intricacies of long standing, and that most of\r\nthem have governments more centralized than our own. It means a great\r\ndeal to be able to quote in support of a position the weight of an\r\nauthority like Metternich, Cavour, Bismarck, Gortschakoff, Richelieu,\r\nGrotius or Canning. But if anyone thinks that America is putting herself\r\nin a fair way to be worsted in this greatest of fields of intellectual\r\nbattle, let him read the history of American diplomacy and let him study\r\nthe part she has recently played in the world drama. If he thinks she is\r\ntaking this greater part without adequate prestige, let him but observe\r\nthe flattering attention she is now receiving, the coquetry for her\r\nfavor and the dread of her rivalry to be observed in every quarter.\r\n\r\nThe State Department, therefore, may be expected to meet its new\r\nobligation successfully, provided it is allowed to act without too much\r\ninterruption by people or legislature, and provided that the same wise\r\ndiscretion is observed in the choice of its chief officer that has\r\nusually been exercised.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to mention here another provision which lies\r\noutside of the province of the State Department but affects its\r\nusefulness, nevertheless. A well-known case which occurred in Louisiana\r\na few years ago, illustrates the point. A number of Italians, members of\r\na band called the Mafia, were killed by a mob, and as a consequence loud\r\ncomplaints came from the Italian people, and many bitter criticisms were\r\nurged against a government which must needs leave the administration of\r\njustice for aliens within its borders to any locality where prejudice\r\nwas evidently high. Our government could only give assurances of a\r\nsatisfactory settlement of the matter; but it was humiliating to feel\r\nthe powerlessness of the United States to take the administration of\r\njustice in a case involving foreigners out of the hands of the State of\r\nLouisiana and into its own. Such cases have happened more than once in\r\nour history, and the fact that they are liable to occur at any time is a\r\nstanding menace to our peace, and will be so until the proper\r\nlegislation is enacted. This is an acknowledged weakness in our\r\ngovernment, a source of annoyance and humiliation to every patriotic\r\nAmerican, and of embarrassment to the State Department. One cannot do\r\nbetter in view of such a defect and our comparative indifference to it,\r\nthan to quote the warning comment of James Bryce: “As it is, that which\r\nmight prove to a European nation a mortal disease is here nothing worse\r\nthan a teasing ailment. This is why Americans submit, not merely\r\npatiently but hopefully, to the defects of their government. The vessel\r\nmay not be any better built or formed or rigged than are those which\r\ncarry the fortunes of the great nations of Europe. She is certainly not\r\nbetter navigated. But for the present at least,—it may not always be\r\nso,—she sails upon a summer sea.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have been considering the State Department thus far with respect to\r\nits relation to the general government, its chief officer, its division\r\ninto the various bureaus and some general remarks upon its most\r\ndistinctive feature, the Diplomatic Bureau. There remain several minor\r\ntopics to be briefly presented, leaving until the next lecture the\r\nmethod of choosing men for the consular and diplomatic service, a\r\nsubject which might profitably be considered here.\r\n\r\nThe Department has varied in its scope somewhat from time to time, now\r\nenlarging its domain as the country grew, and greater needs developed,\r\nand now surrendering some of its functions to other departments, mainly\r\nthe Department of the Interior. It was first known before the outbreak\r\nof the Revolution as the “Committee of Secret Correspondence”, with\r\nBenjamin Franklin at its head. Next it was known (1777) as the\r\n“Committee for Foreign Affairs”, and its first Secretary, Thomas Paine,\r\nwas dismissed for making an official matter public. Next (1789) it was\r\nknown as the Department for Foreign Affairs, and finally as the\r\nDepartment of State, with Thomas Jefferson as the Secretary. The Patent\r\nOffice originated under this Department, but in 1849, when the\r\nDepartment of the Interior was organized, it was formally transferred to\r\nthat department. In the same way the Census Bureau was transferred to\r\nthe Department of the Interior in 1850. Likewise, until the organization\r\nof the Department of the Interior, the affairs of the Territories\r\nremained under the Department of State.\r\n\r\nOne important functionary not mentioned among the bureaus is the\r\nSolicitor. This officer is detailed from the Department of Justice to\r\n“examine claims by or against foreign governments” and to advise upon\r\npoints of international law involved in treaties, protocols, etc. The\r\nSolicitor is not subject, in the discharge of his duties, to the\r\ndirection of the Attorney General.\r\n\r\nBesides the regular business of this department, and in addition to the\r\nwork of the Diplomatic Service, there are a number of bureaus and\r\nforeign commissions appointed for purposes more or less temporary, many\r\nof which require diplomatic ability of the highest order and others\r\ntechnical skill and knowledge. There are at present under commission the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(1) Bureau of the American Republics, with a Director, a Secretary, five\r\ntranslators, an Editor of the Monthly Bulletin, a Chief Clerk and a\r\nChief of the Division of Information.\r\n\r\n(2) Intercontinental Railway Commission, four members.\r\n\r\n(3) United States and Mexican Water Boundary Commission, three American\r\nand three Mexican members.\r\n\r\n(4) Nicaragua Canal Commission, three members.\r\n\r\n(5) Commission to the Paris Exposition of 1900, three members.\r\n\r\n(6) Reciprocity Commission, a special Commissioner, a Secretary, an\r\nAssistant Secretary and a Messenger.\r\n\r\n(7) Consular Board of Examiners, under Executive Order of Sept. 20,\r\n1895, three members.\r\n\r\n(8) Joint High Commission, six members besides a Secretary and a\r\nMessenger.\r\n\r\n(9) International Tribunal of Egypt, three members.\r\n\r\n(10) Dispatch Agents, three; at New York, San Francisco and London,\r\nEngland, respectively.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the State Department to-day. Is it likely to assume a\r\ngreater importance in the future? That may well be, for though it may\r\nlose still other functions besides those it has already parted with,\r\nthere will always remain the one characteristic class of business known\r\nas foreign relations, and this seems likely to increase in volume and\r\ninterest. It is possible that it may yet become the department through\r\nwhich the influence of the Executive shall reach the dependencies, when\r\nthe necessity for military occupation shall have gone by.\r\n\r\nNow, before throwing the subject open for discussion, I wish to refer\r\nyou for further information to the publications with which the State\r\nDepartment has kindly furnished me and from which I have gathered most\r\nof the data that I have given you. Among the most interesting and\r\ninstructive of its publications are the “Historical Papers”, previously\r\nmentioned, its works on “international law, diplomacy, and the laws of\r\nforeign nations”, the “Consular Regulations”, “Consular Reports” and\r\nvarious editions of “State Papers”, “Messages and Documents” and the\r\n“Report of the Committee on the Conduct of Business in the Executive\r\nDepartments”. The subject is now open for question or discussion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter some moments’ silence the Professor remarked—“I should have said\r\nat the proper time that there is a House Committee for Foreign Affairs,\r\nas well as a Senate Committee. However, it has no diplomatic\r\nfunctions—it merely serves as an auditing committee.”\r\n\r\nQ. “How much does the Secretary of State get a year?”\r\n\r\nA. “$8,000. It was once raised to $10,000 and the very next year it was\r\nreduced to $8,000.”\r\n\r\nQ. “And on that salary he ‘keeps open house’, as you say, for the\r\nRepublic?”\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“Humph!”\r\n\r\n“But, Professor”, said a wise-looking man near the platform, “I suppose\r\nyou think it is good policy to stick to our traditional simplicity?\r\nWhat’s the use of so much entertaining? Is that a necessary part of\r\ngovernment?”\r\n\r\n“Well”, said the Professor, “I would say that our traditional\r\nsimplicity is all right as an ideal, provided we don’t make a religion\r\nout of it. Hospitality is also a good ideal to keep before the\r\npeople,—international courtesy, if you please,—and perhaps there is as\r\nmuch virtue in the one as in the other. At any rate, if there were no\r\nother reason, no self-respecting nation would allow its\r\nrepresentatives abroad to receive every courtesy and not make an equal\r\nendeavor to return the courtesy. Now, entertaining costs money, and\r\nthere is no government appropriation for any such purpose, thanks to\r\nour democratic ideals, and as was shown before, the burden of it falls\r\non the Secretary of State, which is unjust; for it is well known that\r\nthe salaries we pay our national officers are ridiculously small when\r\ncompared with those of other nations. Some measures should be taken,\r\napparently, to meet this legitimate expenditure. Have I answered your\r\nquestion?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I think just the same as I did before.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“Professor,” said another man, “you have spoken of the Secretary of\r\nState as if he were responsible for our foreign policy; but do you not\r\nmean that the President is responsible?”\r\n\r\n“The Secretary is responsible to the President and the President to the\r\npeople”, said the Professor; “that is to say, the Secretary is\r\nresponsible potentially and the President officially. If they were to\r\ndiffer in opinion, why, of course, that of the President would prevail.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not think that our Secretary of State should be elected by\r\nCongress, in some such way as the Premier and Secretary of State for\r\nForeign Affairs is elected in England?”\r\n\r\n“No, not by any means. Foreign affairs belong essentially to the\r\nexecutive, not the legislative branch of government. France, in my\r\nopinion, is particularly unfortunate in that its Foreign Secretary is\r\nchosen by the President and the Premier, but is responsible to the\r\nlegislature. In Germany, according to the constitution, ‘the Emperor\r\nrepresents the Empire internationally’. He can even ‘declare war if it\r\nis defensive, make peace, enter into treaties with other nations, and\r\nappoint and receive ambassadors’. Hence, you see, as between Germany and\r\nthe rest of the world, the Kaiser can almost say, ‘I am the State’;\r\nwhich, if the Kaiser is infallible, is a very fine thing. But to return\r\nto your question, it is not quite exact to say that in Great Britain the\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs is elected by and responsible to\r\nParliament. He is not always the Premier as he is at present; besides,\r\nyou must remember that with us the Cabinet is an advisory board to the\r\nexecutive, while in Great Britain, the Cabinet virtually _is_ the\r\nexecutive. Hence, no good analogy can be drawn.”\r\n\r\n“Do I understand, Professor, that in your opinion, our system compares\r\nfavorably with the corresponding systems of other countries?”\r\n\r\n“That is certainly my opinion. The Senate oversight—the only feature\r\nthat is severely criticized—may at times be troublesome and costly, but\r\nit is a valuable check and can not be dispensed with safely. After all,\r\nthe great advantage enjoyed by American diplomacy is that we are more\r\nable than any other nation to act the part of the umpire, or peacemaker.\r\nThis follows not only from our geographical position, but from the fact\r\nthat at the very beginning we were free to choose advanced ethical\r\npositions because we were not tied to precedents.”\r\n\r\nAs there seemed to be no further questions, the audience was dismissed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Man gestures as pieces of paper fly in the air towards\r\nstudent with head on desk]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: Portrait of man]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LECTURE\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                     THE CONSULAR SERVICE—OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall speak more particularly this evening, said the Professor, upon\r\nfacts associated with the persons employed in the consular service; the\r\nselection, preparation and such other matter as may be of interest,\r\nleaving the duties of the service until the next lecture. Of course,\r\nthis division is arbitrary, and is adopted merely as a matter of\r\nconvenience. The data which I shall adduce may be found for the most\r\npart in the “Consular Regulations”, which anyone may purchase from the\r\nSuperintendent of Documents in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Consular Service, as was said before, makes a small army of about\r\n1,000 men. These men are chosen from all parts of the United States\r\n(aside from the foreigners in the service), and are sent to all parts of\r\nthe world. They are above all things else, agents of trade—messengers of\r\ncommerce. Yet they stand in so many relations to our government and\r\npeople that it is doubtful if any other position in our modern\r\ncivilization calls into service a greater versatility—a wider exercise\r\nof intellectual capacity.\r\n\r\nWe shall consider the method by which these officers are chosen, then\r\nsome reforms in that method which should have been adopted long ago, and\r\nwhich, it is hoped, we shall soon see in operation. But before\r\ndescribing these methods and reforms, let us notice briefly the _grade_,\r\n_rank_ and _classification_ of the service, likewise the definition of a\r\nfew technical terms, in order that we may know exactly what we are\r\ntalking about.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal grades in the consular service, namely:\r\n\r\n  (1) Consul General.\r\n  (2) Consul.\r\n  (3) Commercial Agent.\r\n\r\nThese three are “full, principal and permanent consular officers as\r\ndistinguished from subordinates and substitutes”. These latter include\r\nVice Consuls General, Deputy Consuls General, Vice Consuls, Deputy\r\nConsuls, Vice Commercial Agents, Consular Agents, Consular Clerks,\r\nInterpreters, Marshals and Clerks at Consulate.\r\n\r\nThe term consul, as applied to the second grade, has also a common,\r\ngeneric meaning, including every consular officer, and it is in the\r\nlatter sense that we shall generally use it.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the word consulate seems to waver in meaning, sometimes\r\ncovering the entire region over which a consul has jurisdiction, i. e.,\r\nthe consular district, and sometimes implying only the official\r\nresidence—the room or building in which the consul does business. The\r\nboundaries of the consulate—using the term in its broadest sense—are\r\nprescribed by the President, and are usually defined in the consul’s\r\ncommission. The general rule is that all places nearer to the official\r\nresidence than to any other consulate within the same country are to be\r\nincluded in a consulate just forming. These boundaries in most cases\r\nhave long since been determined.\r\n\r\nNow as to the difference in power between these three principal grades\r\nthere is little to say, for there is very little difference except that\r\nof grade. Their functions as consuls are quite the same. The only\r\ndifference is that the Consul General, except in three cases, Calcutta,\r\nDresden and Mexico, has limited supervision over consuls within his\r\njurisdiction. This supervision is confined to such as “can be exercised\r\nby correspondence” and is intended to insure that the Consular\r\nRegulations are complied with and the Consular Reports prepared for the\r\nState Department. The Consuls General are “in no sense auditing\r\nofficers”.\r\n\r\nA Consulate General usually includes all the consulates within any one\r\ncountry, though in a large or important country there may be several\r\nconsulates general. In some cases also there are no Consuls General\r\nwhatever, and the Consuls are then subordinated to the Diplomatic\r\nService.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Agent is simply a consul of a lower grade and under\r\nanother name. The title is quite unfortunately chosen, especially since\r\nthe same term is used in other countries to designate an officer quite\r\ninferior in rank and privileges.\r\n\r\nAs to subordinate officers and substitutes, a word may be said in\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nVice Consuls General, Vice Consuls and Vice Commercial Agents are just\r\nwhat might be inferred from their titles—appointees to take the place of\r\ntheir principals whenever the latter are absent.\r\n\r\nThe deputy officers, on the other hand, may discharge the duties of\r\ntheir superiors while the latter are at their posts, though they may\r\nnever “assume the responsible charge of the office”.\r\n\r\nConsular Agents represent their principals in places throughout the\r\nconsulate where the latter do not reside; but their functions are\r\nlimited. In certain cases citizens of the country may be appointed to\r\nthis office.\r\n\r\nAs to Consular Clerks, the President is authorized to appoint as many as\r\nthirteen who may be assigned to duty as the Secretary of State may\r\nchoose. They may not be removed from office “except for cause, stated in\r\nwriting, which shall be submitted to Congress”. This is a peculiar freak\r\nof legislation, but it has some valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\nInterpreters are stationed only at certain consulates in China, Japan,\r\nKorea, the Turkish domains, and Zanzibar. They are usually natives of\r\nthe country. Marshals are appointed only for certain consular courts in\r\nthe less civilized countries.\r\n\r\nLastly Clerks at Consulates are such as attend to the routine clerical\r\nwork of the office.\r\n\r\nFor all these subordinate positions it is recommended that American\r\ncitizens be employed whenever possible.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Showing\r\n  Off\r\n\r\n  See page 50\r\n]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RANK.\r\n\r\nSince a consular officer generally holds office such a short time, one\r\nwould not expect him to rank with Navy and Army officers, but such is\r\nthe case. Here are the equivalents in rank:\r\n\r\n  Consuls General\r\n                           rank with\r\n                           Commodores in the Navy or\r\n                           Brigadier Generals in the Army.\r\n\r\n  Consuls and\r\n  Commercial Agents\r\n                           rank with\r\n                           Captains in the Navy or\r\n                           Colonels in the Army.\r\n\r\n  Vice Consular officers,\r\n  Deputy Consular officers,\r\n  Consular Clerks and\r\n  Consular Agents\r\n                           rank with\r\n                           Lieutenants in the Navy or\r\n                           Captains in the Army.\r\n\r\nIt is an event of some consequence when a United States naval squadron,\r\nor even a lone cruiser, enters a foreign port where an American consular\r\nofficer is stationed; for the time to “put on airs” and “show off”, if\r\nyou ever do such things, is when you are away from home. On such an\r\noccasion a commander of a squadron sends an officer ashore to visit the\r\nconsular officer and to invite him on board the flag-ship. Or, in case\r\nit is but a single war-vessel, the commander thereof first goes ashore,\r\nvisits the consul and invites him on board. In either case the consul\r\naccepts the invitation, as in duty bound, goes on board and “tenders his\r\nofficial services to the commander”. Usually upon his return to the\r\nshore a salute is fired in his honor—nine guns if a consul general,\r\nseven if a consul or five if a commercial agent. While it is being fired\r\nhe faces the vessel and at the end of the salute lifts his hat in token\r\nof acknowledgment and the formalities are over.\r\n\r\nConsular officers are expected to advance the interests of the Navy\r\nsocially and otherwise whenever they can do so without expense to the\r\nGovernment. One cannot but smile at the frequency with which these words\r\nor their equivalent occur throughout the “Regulations”.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\nThus far we have considered the grade and the rank of consular officers.\r\nTurning now to classification, we find that it is merely a matter of\r\nconvenience to the State Department—an arrangement according to salary.\r\nAgain there are three classes, or schedules, namely:\r\n\r\n(1) Schedule B. This includes 38 consuls general, 196 consuls and 10\r\ncommercial agents. It embraces all those who “receive a fixed salary and\r\nare not allowed to transact (private) business”. These, of course,\r\noccupy the more responsible positions and receive the highest salaries,\r\nranging from $5,000 down.\r\n\r\n(2) Schedule C. This includes only 10 consuls. It embraces those who\r\n“receive a fixed salary and are allowed to transact (private) business”.\r\nThe salaries of these ten consuls are lower than those in the first\r\nschedule, but they may make it up if they can by going into business for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n(3) The third schedule (which apparently ought to be D), comprises all\r\nothers who receive no salary, but who are allowed to retain the fees of\r\ntheir respective offices and to engage in business. Of these there are\r\n48 consuls and 20 commercial agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n            SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF CONSULAR OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThe time has been when our consular service was simply a plaything for\r\npoliticians, and the diplomatic service was not essentially different.\r\nThe improvement has been very slow for the reason that it has been at\r\nthe mercy of Congress for the annual appropriation which enables it to\r\nlive, and to politicians everywhere for the frequent changes in its\r\npersonnel. Or to go farther back for causes, its improvement has been\r\ndelayed because the people have had more interest in the home market\r\nthan in the foreign market. When our merchants send bales of advertising\r\nmatter printed in English to a country where English is unknown, what\r\ncan you expect of our people?\r\n\r\nBut there has been some improvement; so that notwithstanding the present\r\nweaknesses of the system there are some reasons for congratulation that\r\nit is as good as it is. There was an executive order issued in\r\nSeptember, 1895, which recognized the justice of some of the complaints\r\nmade against the service and provided for some measures of reform. Among\r\nthese we notice that consulates or commercial agencies paying between\r\n$1,000 and $2,500 per year shall be filled in one of three ways—\r\n\r\n(1) “By transfer or promotion from some other position under the\r\nDepartment of State of a character tending to qualify the incumbent for\r\nthe position to be filled.”\r\n\r\nThis enables the Department to be something of a training school for the\r\nservice, in a small way.\r\n\r\n(2) “By appointment of some one not under the Department of State, but\r\nhaving served thereunder to its satisfaction in a capacity tending to\r\nqualify him for the position to be filled”.\r\n\r\nThis gives second preference to those who may have been discharged for\r\npolitical reasons.\r\n\r\n(3) “By the appointment of a person who, having furnished the customary\r\nevidence of character, responsibility and capacity, and being thereupon\r\nselected by the President for examination, is found upon such\r\nexamination to be qualified for the position.”\r\n\r\nThe order of preference given above seems to be very judicious and\r\nthoroughly in harmony with the spirit of civil service reform. The\r\nPresident further stated that “a vacancy in a consulate will be filled\r\nat discretion only when a suitable appointment cannot be made in any of\r\nthe modes indicated”.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, however, that this order makes provision for\r\nfilling only the less important consular positions, that is, those\r\npaying between $1,000 and $2,500 per annum. As to the method of filling\r\nthe others it is silent.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this order the Secretary of State added a list of the\r\nsubjects to which the examination should relate, namely—\r\n\r\n(1) General education, knowledge of languages, business training and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n(2) The country in which the consul or commercial agent is to reside,\r\nits government, chief magistrate, geographical features, principal\r\ncities, chief production and its commercial intercourse and relations\r\nwith the United States.\r\n\r\n(3) The exequatur, its nature and use.\r\n\r\n(4) Functions of a consul or commercial agent as compared with those of\r\na vice consul or consular agent; relation of former to latter, also to\r\nthe United States minister or ambassador at the capital of the country.\r\n\r\n(5) Duties of a consul or commercial agent as regards:\r\n\r\n    (a) Correspondence with the State Department and the form thereof.\r\n    (b) Passports, granting and visaing.\r\n    (c) United States merchant vessels in a foreign port, and their\r\n      crews, whether seeking discharge, deserting or destitute.\r\n    (d) Wrecks within jurisdiction.\r\n    (e) Wrongs to United States citizens within jurisdiction.\r\n    (f) Invoices.\r\n    (g) Official fees and accounts.\r\n\r\n(6) Treaties between the United States and the foreign country.\r\n\r\n(7) Relation of ambassador and minister to laws of the country to which\r\nthey are accredited, as compared with those of consul or commercial\r\nagent to those of the countries where they reside.\r\n\r\n(8) Acts of ambassador or minister, how far binding upon his country.\r\n\r\n(9) Diplomatic, judicial, and commercial functions of consuls or\r\ncommercial agents.\r\n\r\n(10) Piracy, what it is and where punishable.\r\n\r\n(11) Consular Regulations of the United States—copy of which (to be\r\nreturned to the Department) will be supplied to each candidate upon\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n(12) Such other subject or subjects as the Board may deem important and\r\nappropriate in any particular case.\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that a man who could pass a good examination on the\r\nabove subjects would be pretty well qualified for the service, with one\r\nglaring exception, namely, that nothing is said about _requiring_ an\r\nacquaintance with modern languages, especially that of the country where\r\nthe consul is to be located.\r\n\r\nMoreover, complaints are still coming in as before, so that, although it\r\nis somewhat the fashion to condemn our consular system as the “worst in\r\nthe world”, it is evident that we haven’t got to the bottom of the\r\ndifficulty yet.\r\n\r\nIt needs no argument to show that the “spoils system”, pure and simple,\r\nis the most suicidal policy possible. The logic of history—our own\r\nhistory—upon this very point, is conclusive. But to throw the consular\r\nand diplomatic service into the “classified list”, or, in other words,\r\nto decide upon the fitness of a candidate merely upon the merits of a\r\ncivil service examination would make but small improvement. It would\r\ntinker the old machine instead of replacing it with a new one. Such a\r\nprocess may determine upon a candidate’s preparation—if an examination\r\nmay be said to determine anything—but it can not reach his\r\npersonality—what he is,—nor can it reveal his capacity for work—what he\r\ncan do.\r\n\r\nNow these three points are to be considered in determining a candidate’s\r\nfitness for any position whatever—what he is, what he knows, and what he\r\ncan do. The practical problems for the State Department are how to\r\ndetermine what a man is when in the majority of cases he is an entire\r\nstranger, how to discover what he can do when he has never been tested\r\nby experience, and how to expect him to know much about the business\r\nwhen there is not a school anywhere prepared to give the needed\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nSuppose you want to prepare for this service, how would you go about it?\r\nHow would you find what was needed, what you should study and where to\r\nlook for it? The government provides no means whatever of preparing men\r\nfor foreign service. They simply get into it somehow—always, of course,\r\nthrough political influence—and then learn it necessarily at government\r\nexpense. Just about the time they have mastered the language and are\r\nprepared to do their best work, along comes a change of administration\r\nand turns them out of office, and then the government begins again the\r\nexpensive task of training a new set of men. This is not a hypothetical\r\ncase. It is the rule rather than the exception.\r\n\r\nWell, what ought to be done?\r\n\r\nWhy, establish some means of instruction for one thing. No one will\r\ndoubt the wisdom of maintaining the academies at West Point and\r\nAnnapolis for the Army and Navy, and are not the needs of the foreign\r\nservice, Diplomatic, Consular, and lately Colonial, as urgent and\r\nimportant as the others? We have often heard the need of a great\r\nnational university urged, and we occasionally hear a timid plea for a\r\nnational school at Washington for the training of consuls and diplomats,\r\nbut it is gratifying to notice the declaration in favor of the latter by\r\nsuch an eminent body of educators as those university presidents\r\nconstituting the committee chosen by the National Educational\r\nAssociation to consider this very subject.\r\n\r\nThe need of a school of political science, economics, and modern\r\nlanguages, and the need of its location at the capital of the nation and\r\nunder national control, is all the more urgent and unmistakable now that\r\nquestions in colonial government are coming up for solution; and when\r\none considers the multitude of problems afforded by the work of the\r\nconsular service, together with the statecraft of the diplomatic, it is\r\neasy to see that there should be such an institution. A government which\r\nhas provided so liberally for general education ought not to neglect\r\nthat wise provision where its own efficient service demands it and\r\nnothing else can well supply it.\r\n\r\nBut the school cannot do it all, and its work must be supplemented by\r\nexperience—say a year or more of residence for successful candidates at\r\na foreign consulate or legation. And whenever a new man is appointed it\r\nshould evidently be to one of the lower positions, leaving the higher\r\nones to be filled by promotion.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to notice that an honest and intelligent effort is\r\nbeing made in Congress to bring about some needed reforms in the\r\nconsular service. A bill[2] is before the present House of\r\nRepresentatives which provides that “appointments shall be made to\r\ngrades and not to specific places”. “A consul’s station”, says one\r\nauthority[3] commenting upon the bill, “should depend on the exigencies\r\nof the service, and should not necessarily be permanent. Good consuls\r\nmay thus be obtained for undesirable places, a thing which is now well\r\nnigh impossible”. “It provides also”, says the same authority, that\r\n“removals shall not be made by caprice or for other than specified\r\ncause. To put a check upon appointments only or removals only is to\r\nleave at either end a loophole for evasion of the spirit of the reform.\r\nBy crowding one man in, another may be crowded out”.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  H. R. 1026, 56th Congress. A Bill to increase the efficiency of the\r\n  foreign service of the U. S. and to provide for the reorganization of\r\n  the consular service, by Mr. Adams of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  See article by Mr. Gaillard Hunt, Independent, Oct. 26, ’99.\r\n\r\nOne would be astonished that such common-sense measures as these have\r\nnot been in operation this long time, were it not for the power of\r\n“practical politics”. The “practical politician” is discovered easily\r\nand in every precinct. You have only to speak of efficiency or merit as\r\nthe chief test of a candidate’s fitness for office, and he will have\r\nsomething to say about “giving every man a chance”, “changing around”,\r\n“getting out of the ruts”, etc. Should a consul’s station depend upon\r\nthe “exigencies of the service”? Certainly; what is the service for? May\r\nhe not be “removed by caprice”? Certainly not; for again, what is the\r\nservice for?\r\n\r\nAppointment to grades instead of to particular positions allows a\r\nshifting of men from one post to another whenever it is desirable, and\r\nit does so without sacrificing valuable experience. For it is true that\r\na long residence at one consulate may so familiarize a man with his\r\nsurroundings, especially if he finds himself in a lucrative business,\r\nthat he becomes in some degree alienated from his own country without\r\nbeing aware of it. He may lose track of events at home or else become\r\naccustomed to viewing them from a foreign standpoint, so that as a\r\nresult he falls into an apologetic tone toward those who criticize or a\r\ncritical attitude toward the home government. He is then in a fit\r\ncondition to be sent home. It has been suggested as a preventative to\r\nthis that consuls be recalled from time to time to give lectures\r\nthroughout the country, or instruction in a school for the consular\r\nservice. Otherwise the same result will be accomplished so far as the\r\nconsul is concerned, by shifting him to another position along with some\r\nsalutary advice as to what his business is. This provision also puts the\r\nservice more on a footing with the Army and Navy, which in many respects\r\nwould be a decided gain.\r\n\r\nSince this bill or a similar one is likely to become a law, and in any\r\nevent has already earned strong endorsement, I append a few more of its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nInstead of consul general, consul and commercial agent there are to be\r\nfour grades, namely consul general of the first and the second class and\r\nconsul of the first and the second class.\r\n\r\nAll consular officers shall receive compensation in salaries—none in\r\nfees.\r\n\r\nSubjects in examination shall relate “chiefly but not exclusively to the\r\nduties of the consular service, and for consul of the first class\r\nexamination in one foreign language will be required”.\r\n\r\nThe President is to appoint a board of five examiners, “who are to be\r\nthe Civil Service Commissioners and two officials of the State\r\nDepartment”. These, however, shall have no connection with the\r\nreorganization of the entire service, which is entrusted to a committee\r\nconsisting of two Senators, three Representatives and one officer of the\r\nState Department. It is intended that this committee shall have a pretty\r\nfree hand in the inauguration of desirable changes, and the President is\r\ngiven large discretion as to the manner of putting such changes into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThere remains one important subject to be mentioned—the very difficult\r\nsubject of the selection of men for examination, or after examination it\r\nmay be. The present system is purely political. If you happen to have\r\n“influence” which will secure you a recommendation to the President you\r\nmay be permitted to take the examination whenever a vacancy occurs.\r\nHence the way is pretty effectually barred as far as unsupported merit\r\nis concerned; so it depends much more upon the “influence” than upon\r\nyour merit. This is open to obvious abuses, and in case restrictions as\r\nto preparation are set aside, what have we but the “spoils system”?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the Department must know something more about you than\r\nan examination can show. It must have some assurance of your powers of\r\nobservation, your business acumen, your vigilance and alertness, and\r\nespecially your dignity and integrity of character, so that you may well\r\nrepresent your country’s interests among foreigners, and defend the\r\ninternational rights of your fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nWhether any better way can be devised remains to be seen, but in justice\r\nto the present system it must be said that it has secured many good\r\nofficials—so many, indeed, that the American consular system, according\r\nto one writer[4], has become a subject of careful study by European\r\nnations. The same writer quotes from _La Revue Diplomatique_ as follows:\r\n\r\n“The Americans are practical men and their instinct for business is\r\nmarvelous. Nothing is more characteristic in this respect than the\r\norganization of their consular corps. Its duty is that of a sort of\r\nbureau of information at the expense of the state. It is recruited\r\nprincipally from journalists, who carry into their official career the\r\ntrained instinct of observation, the quick grasp of passing events which\r\nbelong to their former profession.\r\n\r\n“The American consul does not understand that he has a commercial\r\nsituation to maintain but always a commercial situation to conquer. His\r\ningenuity is exercised to invent and find new markets, and in his study\r\nof ways and means, he descends to the most minute details. Despite their\r\ncolonial conquests, the Americans have comprehended that the real\r\nstruggle remains in the old markets—that there especially is the hard\r\nschool that will force them to manufacture and sell better than all\r\nothers”.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Francis B. Loomis, North American Review, Sept., 1899.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the above quotation, as well as others, that, in the\r\njudgment of Europeans, the peculiar excellence of the American consul is\r\nanalogous to that of the American soldier—his ability to take the\r\ninitiative, to be his own commander.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the man is more important than the equipment and harder to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AFTER APPOINTMENT.\r\n\r\nNow let us watch our candidate get ready for business after he has\r\nreceived notice of his appointment. Every consular officer before\r\nentering upon his duties must take the prescribed oath of office and\r\ngive bond for a sum of not less than one thousand nor more than ten\r\nthousand dollars. Then his commission is made out and given to the\r\nDiplomatic Bureau along with a special passport and an order on his\r\npredecessor to turn over the office to him. The commission is forwarded\r\nto the diplomatic representative in the country where he is to be\r\nstationed with instructions to procure from the government an exequatur.\r\n\r\nAn exequatur, in a word, is _permission to act_. It is simply a formal\r\nrecognition of the right of any country to grant or refuse to any other\r\ncountry, or any of its representatives, the right to do business within\r\nits territory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our newly made consul is supposed to be very hard at work\r\ncompleting his preparation, for he is to be at his post within thirty\r\ndays of the date of his commission, his salary having begun on the date\r\nof his taking the oath of office. Having arrived at his post he notifies\r\nthe American legation of that fact and receives his exequatur. Then he\r\napplies to the person in charge of the consulate for the government\r\narchives, the seal and all other government property. In company with\r\nhis predecessor or the one in charge of the office, he makes an\r\ninventory of all the effects, and transmits a copy of it to the State\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the consulate shall remain in the same place; but if\r\nour consul prefers to move he may move. He must do so, however, subject\r\nto instructions, for he is expected to establish his office “at the most\r\nconvenient, central location that the sum allowed for office rent will\r\npermit”, and then give in minute detail a description of the new office\r\nin a report to the State Department. “The arms of the United States\r\nshould be placed over the entrance to the consulate, unless prohibited\r\nby the laws of the country.” The flag may be hoisted occasionally, on\r\nnational holidays, etc., if there is no objection, and it is always\r\nhoisted when required for protection.\r\n\r\nNothing is stipulated as to his residence except that it must be within\r\nthe town in which he is doing business. Though he is expected to have\r\nregular office hours, he must be willing to be at the service of the\r\npublic if called upon outside of those hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PRIVILEGES.\r\n\r\nThe consular service originally comprised some of the functions and\r\nenjoyed many of the privileges of the diplomatic. It lost those\r\nfunctions and most of the privileges when the diplomatic service\r\ndeveloped and became common, except in uncivilized countries. The consul\r\nhas lost, in the main, his representative character and has retained in\r\nuncivilized countries his judicial power—capacity to act as a judge. The\r\nconsul has lost the right of exterritoriality, that is, the right to be\r\nsubject to the laws of his own country and not to those of the country\r\nwhere he is stationed. However, he is under the special protection of\r\ninternational law and is regarded as the officer “both of the state\r\nwhich appoints and the state which receives him”. The extent of his\r\nauthority is derived from his commission and his exequatur, and the\r\nextent of his privileges is defined for the most part by treaties\r\nbetween his own government and the one where he is stationed. Among\r\nthese we will notice the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TREATY RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n_The-most-favored-nation_ clause in a commercial or consular treaty\r\nbetween two powers entitles the consuls of those two countries to all\r\nthe privileges that those countries grant to the consuls of other\r\npowers. It is no more than an agreement between Smith and Jones that in\r\na certain particular they will treat each other as decently as they\r\ntreat any of their other neighbors.\r\n\r\n_Inviolability of the archives and papers_ of the consulate means that\r\nthey cannot be seized or examined by anybody.\r\n\r\n_Inviolability of the consular office and dwelling_ secures those places\r\nfrom invasion even by officers of the law; but it is understood that\r\nthey are not to be used as an asylum or place of refuge for fugitives\r\nfrom the law. If it is known that they are so used it is doubtful if\r\nthere are many countries where this would hold.\r\n\r\n_Exemption from arrest_ secures to a consul the freedom of a diplomatic\r\nofficer, but this is seldom enjoyed in full. Usage inclines to grant\r\nevery liberty to a consul consistent with public welfare. He is seldom\r\nexempt from arrest for crime.\r\n\r\n_Exemption from obligation to appear as a witness_ “except for defense\r\nof persons accused of crime” is secured in several countries.\r\n\r\n_Exemption from taxation_ of personal property is secured in a number of\r\ncountries, provided the officer is not a citizen of that country, and\r\nprovided also he is not engaged in business.\r\n\r\nThis first proviso may sound a little strange, yet it is a fact that\r\nUncle Sam has often jeopardized his reputation for shrewdness by\r\nemploying citizens of a country to represent his commercial interests\r\nright in their own home. A study of treaties will show that foreign\r\ngovernments do not look upon this arrangement with more favor than we\r\nshould, hence it is a good practice to abandon.\r\n\r\n_Exemption from military billetings and public services_ is granted upon\r\nthe same proviso mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThese are not all the points covered by treaties in reference to the\r\nconsular service, but the remainder contemplate his duties rather than\r\nhis privileges and may be mentioned, possibly, in the next lecture. Bear\r\nin mind that these privileges do not exist in any country unless it is\r\nso stipulated in a treaty between the United States and that particular\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PROHIBITIONS.\r\n\r\nUncle Sam doesn’t propose to have his public servants abroad\r\nintermeddling in foreign politics. Consuls are desired to “cultivate\r\nfriendly social relations with the community in which they reside”, but\r\nto “refrain from expressing harsh or disagreeable opinions upon local,\r\npolitical or other questions which divide the community within their\r\njurisdiction. They are forbidden to participate in any manner in the\r\npolitical concerns of the country. In their (public) dispatches upon\r\nsuch subjects, they will confine themselves to the communication of\r\nimportant or interesting public events as they occur, avoiding all\r\nunnecessary reflections upon the character or conduct of individuals or\r\ngovernments, and they will not give publicity, through the press or\r\notherwise, to opinions injurious to the public institutions of the\r\ncountry or the persons concerned in their administration”.\r\n\r\nThis is good, sound diplomacy; and the same paragraph goes on to say,\r\n“It is at the same time no less their duty to report freely and\r\nseasonably to their own government all important facts which may come to\r\ntheir knowledge touching the political condition of the country,\r\nespecially if their communications can be made to subserve or may affect\r\nthe interests of their own country”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U.S. CONSUL]\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SPEECHES.—He is “not allowed to allude in public speeches to any\r\nmatters in dispute between the United States and any other government,\r\nnor to any matters pending in the consulate. It is a still better rule\r\nto avoid public speeches when it can be done without exciting feeling”.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS.—The prohibitions extend also to correspondence with the\r\npress, not literary or non-political articles, but to such as touch upon\r\npublic affairs in any foreign government, or communications to\r\nnewspapers relative to epidemic diseases abroad.\r\n\r\nGIFTS, TESTIMONIALS.—Consuls are not permitted to ask or accept for\r\nthemselves or anybody else “any present, emolument, pecuniary favor,\r\noffice or title of any kind from any foreign government”. If any such\r\noffers are made to them “they may apply to Congress through the\r\nDepartment of State for permission to accept the same”.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR OFFICE.—Consuls are forbidden to recommend any one\r\nfor any governmental office or trust of profit. By permission of the\r\nSecretary of State they may make recommendations to offices subject to\r\ntheir own jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nUNIFORM.—Consular officers are forbidden to wear any distinguishing\r\nuniform. The Regulations are indulgent enough to allow them to wear an\r\nArmy uniform if they happen to have been in the Army of the United\r\nStates during the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nABSENCE.—Consuls are forbidden to be absent from their posts longer than\r\nforty-eight hours without reporting to the Department about it. No one\r\nis permitted to be absent more than ten days at any one time without\r\npermission from the President. Special permission must be obtained in\r\norder to return to the United States, and the statutes do not provide\r\nfor a continuance of salary for an absence of longer than sixty days.\r\n\r\nThis is about all that need be said about the consuls themselves. What\r\nremains to be considered will come up in connection with the duties of\r\nthe consular office. We will wait a few moments for questions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nQ. “Professor, aren’t there other needed reforms in the consular service\r\nbesides those you have mentioned”?\r\n\r\nA. “Certainly, but I preferred to dwell only upon the most difficult and\r\nat the same time the most vital of them all; namely, the choice and\r\npreparation of the men. I think it might be well to emphasize just a\r\npoint or two more in this connection. The first is that the consular\r\nservice ought not to be filled with foreigners. The Consular Register of\r\nJuly, 1899, shows that out of 706 subordinate positions, including\r\ncommercial agencies, 412 are filled by men born in the country where\r\nthey are stationed. In fact, out of a total of 1,020 men in the consular\r\nservice only 547 are of American birth or parentage. The reason for this\r\nis that so many of the positions don’t pay enough to induce Americans to\r\nundertake them. Four or five hundred dollars a year may mean something\r\nto a man who is on the spot, small as the sum is, but it shuts Americans\r\nout of a large majority of the subordinate positions.\r\n\r\n“The second point to be mentioned is the effect of this\r\nparsimony—miscalled economy—upon the higher positions. For instance,\r\nsuppose a man is appointed to a place, the duties of which involve some\r\ndiplomatic responsibility. Such a man must live on a scale becoming his\r\nposition, or bring himself and his country into contempt. As a matter of\r\nfact it has frequently happened that a thrifty consul, profiting by the\r\nexample in frugality set by his government, has tried to save money by\r\nliving in rented rooms above his business office, only to find when the\r\ninspector came around that he had to move out and live in a more\r\nsumptuous fashion. Aside from the question of sentiment, democratic or\r\nundemocratic, the government is best served by a consul who, other\r\nthings being the same, enters a great deal into society and is not too\r\ncareful to live within his income. It gives him an influence, a prestige\r\namong his surroundings which inures to the financial advantage of his\r\ncountry. Uncle Sam pays less for his consular service than does any\r\nother power of equal wealth, but those who know best the service and its\r\npossibilities have always claimed that it is poor economy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barking dog on a chain standing between man and money\r\nbag]\r\n\r\nQ. “Will you please distinguish again between Consular Clerks and Clerks\r\nat Consulate”?\r\n\r\nA. “Certainly; Consular Clerks are not stationed at consulates at all.\r\nThey are specialists who work upon some task assigned by the State\r\nDepartment. Such a one may specialize upon a certain line of textile\r\nfabrics in all its degrees of quality and the methods employed in its\r\nmanufacture. Another may become an expert authority on chemicals or iron\r\nand steel products, etc. Clerks at Consulate are, as you may suppose,\r\nthose engaged in ordinary clerical duties at the consulates.”\r\n\r\nQ. “Do you think that the present movement in favor of consular reform\r\nhas any partisan purpose”?\r\n\r\nA. “Not at all. The last two administrations, i. e., Cleveland’s and\r\nMcKinley’s, have done more for this cause, perhaps, than all the others\r\nput together. Moreover, the time just now is ripe for this reform and\r\nCongressmen should be more than ever awake to the necessity of it,\r\nirrespective of party”.\r\n\r\nQ. “How about that school for consuls and diplomats, Professor? It seems\r\nto me that however desirable it may be, it is hardly feasible for\r\npartisan reasons.”\r\n\r\nA. “That, of course, is the stock objection to such a proposition. Yet I\r\nfail to see why such a school might not be put into the hands of a\r\nnon-partisan board—say the second and third Assistant Secretaries of\r\nState, who do not change with the administration as a rule. And we might\r\nadd to these the Civil Service Commissioners, or any other competent\r\nmen, provided they are not to be meddled with on the score of\r\npartisanship. Partisanship does not enter into the management of West\r\nPoint or Annapolis to any noticeable extent, nor does it prevent our\r\nnumerous State universities from being as well managed as other\r\ninstitutions of learning.”\r\n\r\nQ. “But why not leave all this to the institutions already established?”\r\n\r\nA. “Well, perhaps as good a reason as any is that none of them are in\r\nWashington. The government has here its great scientific museum, the\r\nSmithsonian Institute; also its historical museum, various experiment\r\nstations, and above all, perhaps, its Congressional Library and\r\ncollections of State papers and archives. Besides, diplomacy should be\r\nlearned from diplomats in active service—men acquainted with their\r\noccupation both past and present, European and American. Such a school\r\nneed not be continuous, perhaps, or conducted as many months of the year\r\nas other schools, its chief purpose being to satisfy the exigencies of\r\nthe Government, rather than to furnish a liberal education”.\r\n\r\nQ. “I suppose, Professor, that our Government has treaties with most\r\nother countries covering the principal points of commercial importance”?\r\n\r\nA. “Yes, in the main, though there are some surprising exceptions. For\r\ninstance, ‘the-most-favored-nation’ clause is not in the treaties with\r\neither Great Britain or Sweden and Norway. With many of our neighboring\r\nstates we have no extradition treaties whatever. A glance at the\r\nsynopsis[5] given will show that our treaties are fullest with the\r\nfollowing named countries: Austria, Belgium, Colombia, France, Germany,\r\nItaly, Holland, Roumania, San Salvador and Servia. Evidently the\r\ntreaties with some of the other countries need overhauling.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Empty chair next to desk stacked with books]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: Woman with broom]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LECTURE\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                      THE CONSULAR SERVICE—DUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsular duties, like household duties, are very numerous; and about as\r\nmultiform as they are numerous. The mere mention of them, aside from any\r\ndescription or dwelling upon particulars, would leave little time for\r\nanything else to be said in the same lecture. We shall content\r\nourselves, therefore, with a cursory view, a glance over the whole field\r\nof those duties, without stopping to distinguish between those of a\r\nconsul and those of a consul general, or of a seaport and of an inland\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe following classification will be found to be helpful and very nearly\r\ncomprehensive:\r\n\r\n  (1) Duties commercial.\r\n  (2) Duties in connection with customs regulations.\r\n  (3) Duties to merchant vessels.\r\n  (4) Duties in case of wrecks.\r\n  (5) Duties to officers, naval, diplomatic and departmental.\r\n  (6) Duties to seamen.\r\n  (7) Duties in regard to immigration and quarantine.\r\n  (8) Duties to citizens other than seamen.\r\n  (9) Duties judicial—in non-Christian countries.\r\n  (10) Duties to the State Department.\r\n\r\nThere are a few others, such as duties in regard to extradition, the\r\npurchase and transference of foreign built vessels, etc., etc., which we\r\nshall term miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DUTIES COMMERCIAL.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these—the one indeed which is now, as it always\r\nhas been, of central importance in the consular service, is the one\r\nfirst mentioned—commercial duties. Owing to its importance I will quote\r\nin full from the Consular Regulations, pages 248-51, the list of\r\nsubjects upon which the consul is expected to report to the State\r\nDepartment:\r\n\r\n“1. Conditions of foreign commerce and internal trade, manufacturers,\r\nmechanical industries, agriculture, etc., especially—\r\n\r\n“(a) Statistics of exports and imports, of shipping and of revenue and\r\nexpenditure of the country; amount of public debts, national and local;\r\nrates of taxation, character of taxable basis, how taxation is levied\r\nand collected, amount of taxation per capita, etc.; value, actual value\r\nin exchange, and also as measured by the dollar of the United States;\r\nchanges in purchasing power of the currency; banking—new systems,\r\nespecially of savings banks and of banks as associations for lending\r\nmoney to agriculturists, mechanics, and factory operatives; public loans\r\nand the matters of finance affecting the industry or commerce of the\r\ncountry; commercial credits—rates and periods usually granted to foreign\r\npurchasers, and those expected from foreign shippers; trade usages and\r\npeculiarities; special demands of consumers as to demand and quality of\r\ngoods or supplies already in use or capable of being introduced among\r\nthem, with suggestions as to the best and most economical style of\r\npacking to conform to local requirements of sale and transportation.\r\n\r\n“(b) Improvement of old and development of new industries, including\r\ninventions or discoveries, and the result obtained from the practical\r\napplication of them.\r\n\r\n“(c) Introduction of inventions made in the United States or imitations\r\nof them; application of business or mechanical methods employed in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n“(d) Importation and use of food supplies, raw materials and\r\nmanufactures from the United States, or the possibility of introducing\r\nthem, and local or race requirements to make them acceptable to foreign\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n“2. Facilities for direct and indirect communication with the United\r\nStates—establishment of new ocean or international railroad lines or\r\nagencies; development of internal transportation lines—railroads,\r\nhighways and steamboat or other carriage on rivers and canals, or\r\nbetterment of them; opening up of new trade routes or abandonment of old\r\nones; changes in transportation rates, both freight and passenger, which\r\nare of general interest to commerce; bounties or subsidies to railroads\r\nand shipping.\r\n\r\n“3. Development or decline of commercial and manufacturing centers;\r\ncauses of drift of agricultural population to towns and cities;\r\ndiversion of trade from one local market or district to another;\r\nprojects for great manufacturing or other industrial enterprises for\r\nharbor or river improvement, for better methods of lighting, street\r\npaving, water supply, sewerage and disposal of sewage, economy of\r\nmunicipal taxation and expenditure; hygienic and quarantine measures;\r\npolice systems, urban and rural.\r\n\r\n“4. Changes in economic condition of producing communities, urban and\r\nrural; fluctuations in rates of wages, cost of living, prices of\r\nproducts, raw and manufactured, especially for food supplies, wearing\r\napparel, agricultural and domestic implements, machinery, etc.; scarcity\r\nor glut of articles of consumption of all kinds, particularly those\r\nproduced in the United States; changes in hours of labor or other\r\nconditions affecting workingmen, trades’ unions; strikes and lockouts;\r\nsystems of co-operation and profit sharing; government measures\r\n(national, municipal or local) or private (organized) projects for\r\ninsurance or care of infirm or superannuated laborers, for improved\r\nsanitation of factories and dwellings, for regulating the labor of women\r\nand children, and for combating usury in the lending of money; technical\r\nand commercial education; museums, exhibitions, merchants’ unions and\r\nsimilar organizations for promoting trade, and the functions assumed by\r\nthe state in connection therewith.\r\n\r\n“5. All changes in tariff legislation, including new rates of export,\r\nimport, or transit duties, special care being taken to state whether\r\nthey discriminate in favor of or against the United States as compared\r\nwith other countries. When a wholly new tariff law is enacted it should\r\nbe given in full with an explanatory statement of increase or decrease\r\nin duties as compared with the tariff previously existing. Prompt notice\r\nof contemplated tariff legislation should be sent to the Department. By\r\ntariff legislation are meant not only measures affecting export and\r\nimport duties, but also those relating to customs administration,\r\ntransit duties, octroi or municipal taxes upon supplies entering cities\r\nand towns, taxes imposed upon the import or export of articles from one\r\npolitical district of a country (such as a state, province, canton,\r\narrondissement, etc.) to another, tonnage, taxes and port dues, or other\r\ntaxes upon shipping, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Man surrounded by stacks of paper]\r\n\r\n“6. Legislation or proposed legislation of interest to farmers,\r\nmerchants, mechanics, inventors, etc., such as changes in patent, trade\r\nmark, and copyright laws; laws to prevent adulteration of food, or to\r\nprohibit importation or sale of adulterated or impure food; laws\r\nprohibitory of importation of diseased animals, impure seeds, etc.;\r\nmeasures discriminating for or against any particular class of products\r\nor against imports from any country; bounties granted to special lines\r\nof manufacture or agricultural production; changes in legislation\r\nconcerning agricultural, commercial or industrial concessions, such as\r\ngovernment land grants, railroad bonuses, special privileges, and\r\nexemptions for colonists; encouragements to or restrictions of\r\nimmigration; rights of citizenship; taxation or exemption of\r\nmanufacturing plants, machinery and implements; licenses to trade;\r\ntaxation of commercial travelers; legislation as to bankruptcy and\r\ncollection of debts, etc. Also decisions of courts or of government\r\nofficers on important commercial questions; government regulations\r\nrelating to law changes; changes in commercial procedure.\r\n\r\n“7. Undertakings and enterprises of moment—the construction of public\r\nworks, the opening of mines, the granting of concessions for working\r\nminerals or forests, or for other similar purposes”.\r\n\r\nThis is an admirable list for any one to study if he would learn what\r\nare the signs of a nation’s material prosperity. It deserves further\r\ncomment because of its importance to the consular service, but we must\r\npass on.\r\n\r\n\r\n           DUTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CUSTOMS REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nA large share of the routine of every consulate is concerned with the\r\ncustoms regulations, certifying to invoices, guarding against fraud,\r\nkeeping account of all transactions and reporting the same to the State\r\nDepartment. If you are engaged in importing “fancy Scotch cheviots”\r\n(your imported Scotch goods are made in America, however), the goods\r\nmust be described in full in a consular invoice. This invoice must be\r\nsigned by yourself or agent and accompanied by an “official shipper’s\r\ncertificate”, which amounts to saying that the invoice is “all right”,\r\nand this again must be signed by the shipper and certified by the\r\nconsul. Thus the consular service facilitates the work of the customs\r\nofficials by having imported goods invoiced before arrival at the “port\r\nof entry”.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DUTIES TO MERCHANT VESSELS.\r\n\r\nAn American merchant vessel sailing from an American to a foreign port\r\nis required under penalty to deposit its register and also its sea\r\nletter with the American consul immediately upon reaching its\r\ndestination. “It is usual also to deposit its crew list and shipping\r\narticles”. These documents are known as the “ship’s papers”, and are\r\nkept by the consul until the ship has received “clearance”.\r\n\r\nThe consul is required to give the masters of vessels all information in\r\nhis possession concerning coast surveys, pilot and hydrographic charts,\r\netc., such as are published by the Navy Department, and to furnish to\r\nthe State Department any information that may be of service to\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DUTIES IN CASE OF WRECKS.\r\n\r\nNo consular officer is permitted to take any action in case of a wreck,\r\nif the “owner, master or consignee thereof is present and capable of\r\ntaking possession of the same”. If no such person is present, the consul\r\nis required, so far as the laws of the land permit, to take all\r\nnecessary action for the preservation of vessel and cargo, and keep\r\ninventories of the same, together with the expense involved. The consul\r\nmust make a full report of such wrecks to the State Department, whether\r\nthey occur within his jurisdiction or are brought in.\r\n\r\nIn case Americans are shipwrecked the consuls are required to “render\r\nsuch assistance as may be in their power”, but they are not authorized\r\nto incur any expense with the expectation that it will be met by the\r\nState Department.\r\n\r\nWhenever foreigners render aid to shipwrecked Americans, the Consul is\r\nrequired to forward to the State Department an account of the facts,\r\ngiving the name of the master of the foreign vessel and those of the\r\ncrew who especially distinguished themselves for heroism or humanity.\r\nThese details should be quite exact, as they are to be laid before the\r\nPresident, who is authorized by Congress to make suitable\r\nacknowledgment. In some cases the consul may reward a rescuing crew out\r\nof funds at his disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                DUTIES TO OFFICERS—NAVAL AND DIPLOMATIC.\r\n\r\nDuties to naval officers were mentioned in connection with “rank” in the\r\npreceding lecture. Officers of the Navy are under a reciprocal duty to\r\nconsuls, however, which should be mentioned. On this point I quote the\r\nexact words of the Regulations.\r\n\r\n“The Navy is an independent branch of the service, not subject to the\r\norders of the Department of State, and its officers have fixed duties\r\nprescribed for them; consuls will, therefore, be careful to ask for the\r\npresence of a naval force at their posts only when public exigencies\r\nabsolutely require it, and will then give the officers in command the\r\nfull reasons for the request and leave with them the responsibility of\r\naction. If the request is addressed to the Department of State, the\r\nreasons should likewise be fully stated for its information.”\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic service has general supervision over the consular service\r\nin any one country. When there is a consul general, this supervision is\r\nexercised through him, and the consuls will not correspond officially\r\nwith the diplomatic officers—except in reply to inquiries. Where there\r\nis no consul general the consuls will correspond directly with the\r\ndiplomatic officials and “endeavor in all cases to comply with their\r\nrequests and wishes”. Leaves of absence and recommendations for\r\nappointment of subordinate officers are usually sent through the\r\ndiplomatic officers.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the absence of a diplomatic officer a consul general or\r\nconsul may discharge the duties of a diplomatic officer. Sometimes the\r\ntwo offices are united in the one representative.\r\n\r\n“Consular officers will confer freely with the Treasury revenue agents\r\nwho may be appointed to visit and examine the consulates. They will\r\nremember, however, that these agents have no authority to instruct them\r\nas to their official acts”.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DUTIES OR RELATIONS TO SEAMEN.\r\n\r\nTo no other class of citizens, save in uncivilized countries, does the\r\nconsul stand in such immediate relationship as to seamen. This would\r\nseem to be because as a class, since their occupation takes them to all\r\nparts of the world and away from the protection of their own country,\r\nand, moreover, because they are laborers and not men of means, they are\r\nmore at the mercy of circumstances as well as of unscrupulous masters in\r\nforeign lands. On the other hand, justice to the masters also requires\r\nnational authority to enforce contracts and assist in securing harmony\r\noften-times on shipboard. Fully 57 pages of the Regulations are taken up\r\nwith this subject under the following heads:\r\n\r\n  1. Shipment of seamen.\r\n  2. Discharge of seamen.\r\n  3. Wages and effects of seamen.\r\n  4. Relief of seamen.\r\n  5. Transportation of seamen.\r\n  6. Desertion of seamen.\r\n  7. Disputes between masters, officers and crews.\r\n\r\nA master of an American merchant vessel who engages any seamen in a\r\nforeign port must do so under penalty in the presence of the American\r\nconsul and only with his sanction. The engagement must be signed in\r\nduplicate by both master and men in the presence of the consul, who must\r\nsee to it that the seamen understand clearly the terms of the contract.\r\nSeamen may be engaged for a definite time, for a round trip, for a\r\nsingle voyage or “by the lay”, and the terms of the agreement are called\r\nthe “shipping articles”. In case of desertion or casualty the master may\r\nengage a number of seamen equal to the number lost and report to the\r\nfirst consul he sees. In case a vessel is purchased abroad and the\r\nseamen “have not character of American seamen” (subsequently defined),\r\nthey do not come within the jurisdiction of the consul.\r\n\r\nAn American seaman is (1) an American citizen or (2) a foreigner shipped\r\nin an American vessel in an American port or (3) a foreign seaman\r\nshipped in an American vessel in either an American or a foreign port,\r\nwho has declared his intention in a competent court to become a citizen\r\nof the United States and has served three years thereafter on American\r\nmerchant vessels. For purposes of protection the filing of the\r\ndeclaration is sufficient.\r\n\r\nA consular officer may discharge a seaman upon his own or his master’s\r\napplication, provided the terms of the agreement have been fulfilled. He\r\nis also to give a certificate to that effect to the seaman. Other cases\r\nwhere American seamen are discharged abroad are for sickness,\r\nmisconduct, on the sale of American vessel, on account of ill treatment,\r\nwhen vessel is wrecked or condemned as unseaworthy, etc. The general\r\npolicy of the government is to “discountenance the discharge of seamen\r\nin a foreign port”, and any master who knowingly abandons a seaman\r\nabroad is subject to fine and imprisonment. “Cases have occurred in\r\nwhich the consular officers have, with the subsequent approval of the\r\nDepartment of State, removed masters of vessels and appointed others in\r\ntheir places to complete the voyage”, but this was only when the “gross\r\nincompetency” of the masters endangered the lives of passengers and\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nA consul in discharging a seaman, must see to it that his wages are\r\npaid, otherwise “he shall be held accountable to the United States for\r\nthe full amount thereof”.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the consul to provide for destitute seamen, to secure\r\ntheir transportation to the United States at government expense, subject\r\nalways to certain conditions, and to take charge of their effects upon\r\ntheir death at sea or in port.\r\n\r\nThe consular officers must help to reclaim deserters and call in the\r\nassistance of the local authorities for this purpose if necessary, which\r\nthey are authorized to do by treaty with several countries and by comity\r\nor usage with others.\r\n\r\nOne of the many interesting points in international law is that of\r\n“mixed jurisdiction”, as it is called, or jurisdiction within a harbor.\r\nA dispute on shipboard on the high seas is clearly within the\r\njurisdiction of the country under whose flag the vessel is sailing, but\r\nwhen the vessel comes into the harbor of another country it is just as\r\nclear that the jurisdiction of that country is superior. As a matter of\r\npractice, however, it has long been found best to allow all such\r\ncontroversies occurring on shipboard within a harbor to be tried by the\r\nlaw and authorities to which the vessel is subject, provided, of course,\r\nthat “it does not involve the peace or dignity of the country, or the\r\ntranquility of the port” where it occurs. In all such cases the consul,\r\nas the representative of his government, acts as an officer of justice.\r\nWhere he is authorized by treaty to call for local aid he is cautioned\r\nnot to do so if it can be avoided. If such aid is refused, he should lay\r\nclaim to his treaty rights and then report at once to the diplomatic\r\nofficers in the country and to the State Department.\r\n\r\nThis hurried review of the consul’s relations to seamen leaves a great\r\ndeal unsaid, but the main points, at least, have been touched upon. Let\r\nus now turn to\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IMMIGRATION.\r\n\r\nThe old idea that this land is an asylum for all kinds and conditions of\r\nmen is now happily exploded. The classes of aliens now excluded are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  (a) Chinese laborers.\r\n  (b) Contract laborers.\r\n  (c) All idiots and insane persons.\r\n  (d) Paupers or persons likely to become a public charge.\r\n  (e) Persons suffering from a loathsome or contagious disease.\r\n  (f) Felons and all criminals except political offenders; (and these\r\n  latter are excluded if the penalty is removed upon condition of\r\n  immigration).\r\n  (g) Polygamists.\r\n  (h) Assisted immigrants.\r\n  (i) Abandoned women.\r\n\r\nEvery master of a vessel having on board immigrants bound for any port\r\nin the United States is obliged upon arrival to submit a manifest to the\r\ninspector of immigration. A manifest is a list of the immigrants on\r\nboard, with a general description of each one, giving name, age, sex,\r\nnationality, ability to read and write, calling or occupation, means,\r\ndestination, etc. This must be subscribed and sworn to by the master in\r\nthe presence of the consul before the vessel can leave port, and in like\r\nmanner the surgeon of the vessel must take oath that he has made a\r\npersonal examination of each one and finds everything satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              QUARANTINE.\r\n\r\nBefore clearing for any American port any vessel in a foreign port must\r\nprocure from the consul a “bill of health”, which is a certificate to\r\nthe effect that the sanitary conditions of the vessel are satisfactory\r\nand that all rules and regulations in such cases have been complied\r\nwith. The consul must take pains to satisfy himself before granting the\r\n“bill of health”, and for this purpose a medical officer is often\r\ndetailed by the Government. A master of a vessel who sails into an\r\nAmerican port without having procured a “bill of health” is liable to a\r\nfine not to exceed $5,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DUTIES TO CITIZENS OTHER THAN SEAMEN.\r\n\r\nCitizens going abroad for business or pleasure may find it to their\r\nadvantage to inquire into the consideration that Uncle Sam is prepared\r\nto show them when abroad. The freedom of travel you enjoy at home is a\r\nsmall thing until, in a foreign land, you find yourself confronted by an\r\nofficer of the law demanding your passports. Besides, there are numerous\r\nlittle official courtesies for which the traveler or sojourner will be\r\nvery grateful, and in cases of emergency assistance may be rendered far\r\nbeyond all adequate reward.\r\n\r\nAs was said before, passports may be procured from the State Department,\r\notherwise through the diplomatic officers, or in their absence, through\r\nthe consular service. If the applicant is accompanied by his wife, minor\r\nchildren, servant, etc., the one passport answers for all.\r\n\r\nA consular officer may verify or visé (pronounced vee-záy) a passport by\r\nwriting on it the word “good” in the language of the country, and\r\naffixing his official signature and seal. Diplomatic representatives\r\nshould visé passports only when there is no consulate in the city where\r\nthe legation is situated. A visé is good only in the country where it is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Restricted\r\n  Immigration\r\n\r\n  See page 101.\r\n]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe government affords all the protection it can under the\r\ncircumstances. Of course it can have no jurisdiction in criminal cases,\r\nexcept in uncivilized countries, and it can have no civil jurisdiction\r\nexcept by treaty or by the law of the land. “The right of a citizen to\r\nclaim protection is founded upon the ‘correlative right’ of his country\r\nto his ‘allegiance and support.’” Consuls are “particularly cautioned\r\nnot to enter into any contentions that can be avoided, either with their\r\ncountrymen or with the subjects or authorities of the country. They\r\nshould use every endeavor,” continues the “Regulations”, “to settle in\r\nan amicable manner all disputes in which their countrymen may be\r\nconcerned, but they should take no part in litigation between citizens.\r\nThey should countenance and protect them before the authorities of the\r\ncountry in all cases in which they may be injured or oppressed, but\r\ntheir efforts should not be extended to those who have been wilfully\r\nguilty of an infraction of the local laws. It is incumbent upon citizens\r\nof the United States to observe the reasonable laws of the country where\r\nthey may be. It is their duty to endeavor on all occasions to maintain\r\nand promote all the rightful interests of citizens, and to protect them\r\nin all privileges that are provided for by treaty or are conceded by\r\nusage. If representations are made to the local authorities and fail to\r\nsecure the proper redress, the case should be reported to the consul\r\ngeneral, if there be one, or to the diplomatic representative if there\r\nbe no consul general, and to the Department of State.”\r\n\r\nI have quoted this passage almost entirely because it is the best\r\nexpression to be found, probably, of the general attitude of the\r\nGovernment of the United States toward its citizens abroad.\r\n\r\nCitizens intending to sojourn abroad should register at the consulate\r\nwithin which they are to reside. This is not required, but it may be a\r\ngreat convenience both ways.\r\n\r\nWho are citizens? (1) “All persons born in the United States and subject\r\nto the jurisdiction thereof”; (2) all children born to such natives,\r\neven if beyond the jurisdiction of the United States; (3) “any white\r\nwoman, or woman of African nativity or descent, or Indian woman, married\r\nto a citizen of the United States, is a citizen thereof”; (4)\r\nnaturalized citizens; (5) the minor children of naturalized citizens.\r\n\r\n“An official letter of introduction, when given to a citizen of the\r\nUnited States, is valuable to the holder for prompt identification in\r\ncase he needs the intervention of a consular officer in his behalf. But\r\nin no case must the letter be understood or taken as implying any claim\r\nupon the consul for hospitality or personal courtesies beyond the\r\npoliteness always due to citizens of the United States when they have\r\nlegitimate business with a consulate”.\r\n\r\nConsuls are not allowed to give their names as business references, nor\r\nto report the financial standing of houses in their districts. Such\r\nrequests should be referred to banks or business agencies.\r\n\r\n“Consular officers are not authorized to indorse notes or bills of\r\nexchange, nor in other ways to become responsible pecuniarily for\r\nAmerican citizens or others who have no personal claims upon them.” Such\r\ntransactions are not a part of the official duties of a consular\r\nofficer. He is “not authorized to lend money to indigent citizens of the\r\nUnited States or others, nor to incur expenses or liabilities for any\r\npersons except seamen of the United States, in the expectation of\r\nreimbursement by the Government”.\r\n\r\nConsular officers are forbidden to solemnize marriages. A marriage may\r\nbe solemnized in the presence of a consular officer as a witness, and in\r\nthat case it has certain peculiarities, as will be seen from the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nAccording to international law the mode of solemnizing marriage conforms\r\nto the law of the place where it is performed. But there are many\r\nconceivable circumstances which might make this undesirable, and in such\r\ncases it is declared by the statutes that “marriages in presence of any\r\nconsular officer of the United States in a foreign country, between\r\npersons who would be authorized to marry if residing in the District of\r\nColumbia, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, and shall have the\r\nsame effect as if solemnized within the United States”. In all such\r\ncases the consul must give a certificate to each of the parties and\r\nforward a copy to the Department of State.\r\n\r\nIn case of the death of an American citizen abroad, it is the duty of\r\nthe consul to take possession of his estate, provided there is no other\r\nlegal representative, and provided, also, the laws of the country so\r\npermit,—to inventory the same with the help of two merchants (Americans,\r\npreferably), to make collections and to discharge the debts due from the\r\nestate, to sell at public auction such part as is of a perishable\r\nnature, and at the expiration of one year the remainder, and finally to\r\ntransmit the proceeds to the Treasury of the United States to be held in\r\ntrust for the legal claimants, who, however, are at liberty to appear at\r\nany time and take charge of the proceedings and the estate themselves.\r\nThis applies to personal property only—real estate being administered\r\naccording to the laws of the locality. In the absence of a treaty\r\ncovering such points the consul is to proceed in the above manner unless\r\nit is known that the local authorities are unwilling, for “he should\r\navoid the appearance of opposing or disregarding actual local\r\nrequirements”.\r\n\r\nThe same proceedings as the above are followed in case a citizen dies on\r\nthe high seas “on either an American or a foreign vessel, and his\r\neffects are brought within a consular district”.\r\n\r\n\r\n              JUDICIAL DUTIES—IN NON-CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\nThe use of the term “non-christian”, which in the present day is giving\r\nplace to “uncivilized”, is as old as the consular system itself; that is\r\nto say, it has come down to us from mediaeval times when the consular\r\nsystem originated. It might still have been retained had it not been for\r\nthe progress of one country, Japan, which may be better described as\r\ncivilized rather than Christian.\r\n\r\nThe judicial power of a consul, therefore, remains as a relic of\r\nmediaevalism, and it remains because the need remains; for just as\r\ncivilized countries five hundred years ago were unwilling to look to the\r\nTurk for justice, so they are to-day, and treaties to that effect secure\r\nTurkish recognition of this humiliating state of things. As it is with\r\nTurkey so it is with China, Korea, Siam, Persia, Madagascar, Borneo,\r\netc., the treaties varying considerably in each case.\r\n\r\nThis assumption of superiority by the self-styled civilized countries\r\nwould be hard to justify on the ground of theoretical ethics, but\r\napparently theoretical and practical or applied ethics sometimes diverge\r\nvery widely, and when they do diverge no statesman hesitates as to which\r\nhe shall follow.\r\n\r\nFrom the tiresome details of Title XLVII, U. S. Revised Statutes, which\r\ndeals fully with courts of this character, the following points may be\r\ngleaned:\r\n\r\n(1) Cases arising between Americans are tried before American officers.\r\n\r\n(2) Cases arising between Americans and others not natives are arranged\r\nby their respective consular officers; in Turkey they are tried in the\r\nconsulate of the defendant.\r\n\r\n(3) Cases arising between Americans and natives are tried before an\r\nAmerican tribunal in China, Siam and Madagascar; before a mixed tribunal\r\nin Persia, the Barbary States and Turkey.\r\n\r\nIt is rather startling to notice the power entrusted to one man, as is\r\ndone by our government in the case of the consuls to these countries. A\r\nconsul, for instance, can issue a warrant for the arrest of a man merely\r\nupon his own initiative, and can then proceed to try him, he himself\r\nacting as judge and jury. He first submits a list of men to the\r\nminister, who selects from one to four to sit with him in the trial as\r\nadvisers. These advisers must record and sign their judgment of the\r\ncase, but it is the consul’s judgment that condemns or acquits.\r\n\r\nIn trials for capital offenses there must be four advisers, and their\r\njudgment must concur with the consul’s, and their combined judgment must\r\nbe approved by the minister before there can be conviction. In some\r\ncases appeal may be made to the minister and rarely to a U. S. circuit\r\ncourt, but in general the decision of the consul is final. Hence,\r\nalthough the power of life and death is lodged in the hands of the\r\nconsul, it is well safeguarded, and the danger of its abuse is more\r\napparent than real.\r\n\r\nThere are some miscellaneous duties devolving upon the consular service\r\nwhich we will notice briefly before turning finally to the duties to the\r\nState Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXTRADITION.\r\n\r\nWhenever a criminal attempts to escape justice by fleeing to another\r\ncountry it is a delicate matter to recapture him, necessarily; for aside\r\nfrom the ordinary difficulties of the case the powers add a few by their\r\ncarefulness to preserve each other’s dignity in such matters. Thus the\r\npursuit of a criminal by the officers of one country into the territory\r\nof another, even when permitted by treaty, may result in a rather\r\nawkward state of things, especially if what is regarded as a crime in\r\nthe one is not so much of a crime in the other. For instance, suppose\r\nthat the laws of Canada regarding embezzlement are not as stringent as\r\nare those of the United States, or suppose she hasn’t any at all: one\r\ncan see that a request by our Government for the extradition of an\r\nembezzler might strain international courtesy more than a trifle. A\r\ntreaty is a prerequisite to extradition in any country, and fortunately\r\nour Government has such treaties with most of her neighbors, though\r\nthere are some startling exceptions.\r\n\r\nWhenever a warrant or “requisition” is made for a fugitive criminal it\r\nis usual to act through a diplomatic officer. If it is made through a\r\nconsul it must first be with the sanction of the State Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TRANSFER OF FOREIGN VESSELS.\r\n\r\nThe right of citizens to purchase foreign-made vessels abroad involves\r\nthe right to the protection of those vessels. A vessel cannot sail the\r\nhigh seas without registration and a flag; for if she does she is liable\r\nto seizure as a pirate. Hence the ceremony of transfer in such a case\r\nmust be attended to by the consul.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily this does not imply any great responsibility, but while a war\r\nis in progress it is a very different thing, no matter whether we are\r\nneutrals or belligerents. To illustrate: Suppose during the recent war\r\nthe owner of an American vessel wished to put it out of danger by\r\nputting it under a neutral flag. This he might do by a pretended sale to\r\na citizen of a foreign country through the connivance of a consul. It is\r\nthe consul’s duty, therefore, to prevent such fraudulent sales, to take\r\nall possible pains to satisfy himself that the sale is or is not a\r\ngenuine transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WATCHING ENEMY’S VESSEL.\r\n\r\nIn case of war with another power the consuls are required to keep watch\r\non the movements of the enemy’s vessels and report promptly to the\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AS A FOREIGN AGENT.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of a war between two foreign states our consuls may\r\nas a matter of courtesy to one or both of them take charge of its\r\nconsular offices and effects. This must be with the permission of the\r\nSecretary of State, however, and the Government assumes no\r\nresponsibility for the acts of the consuls.\r\n\r\n\r\n               DUTIES TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT—AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nThe consular service may be likened to a great reporting system. The\r\nconsuls are reporters, their offices are news agencies, their field the\r\nworld, their managing and publishing office the State Department, their\r\norgan the Consular Reports, their readers—just a few persons, here and\r\nthere, whose numbers, by the way, are increasing. In addition to the\r\ncorrespondence which must be carried on in connection with the duties\r\nmentioned, the consul may have occasional correspondence on public\r\nbusiness with “the Secretary of the Treasury, the Comptroller, the\r\nAuditor for the State and other Departments, the Register of the\r\nTreasury, collectors of customs as to invoices and prices current, the\r\ndiplomatic representative of the United States in the country where he\r\nresides, other consular officers, and with naval or military officers in\r\nthe service of the United States who may be employed in the\r\nneighborhood, and to whom it may be necessary to communicate immediately\r\nany event of public interest, and with no other person”.\r\n\r\nThis, I trust, will serve as a brief conspectus of consular duties, and\r\nnow we will listen to questions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter dismissal a group of men including a banker, a merchant, two\r\nmanufacturers, a grain dealer, some traveling men, etc., made their way\r\nto the platform and were introduced to Professor Loyal as some of the\r\nbusiness men of the place.\r\n\r\n“We suppose, Professor,” said one of them, “that it is rather aside from\r\nyour purpose to tell us how to reach foreign trade—how to get our goods\r\non the market—and yet it is the very thing we need to know; so if you\r\ncan give us any further light we shall appreciate it”.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to hear you say so”, said the Professor, “for that is\r\njust what the consular service is intended to do, while my purpose is to\r\nserve as an introduction committee between you and the service. You will\r\nfind in the syllabi the name and address of every member of the consular\r\nand diplomatic services all over the world, and they, no doubt, will\r\nfurnish you all the information you need. The Regulations, indeed, have\r\nthis to say: ‘Inquiries made by citizens of the United States touching\r\nbusiness matters, or other matters not of mere curiosity, should be\r\nanswered as far as they can be consistently with the consul’s other\r\nduties. All inquiries of this character should be acknowledged, even\r\nwhen it is impracticable to answer them’”.\r\n\r\n“But why not write at once to the State Department”?\r\n\r\n“That may be just as well. The supposition is, however, if you know in\r\nwhat country you expect to find your market the consular service there\r\ncan give you the most help, because the local conditions are known. If\r\nyou do not know where to find your market, you should at least\r\nfamiliarize yourself with the Consular Reports, the ‘advance sheets’ of\r\nwhich give the latest news from foreign markets. If you are exporters\r\nyou will have no difficulty in obtaining these through your\r\nCongressmen”.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you suppose, Professor, that a handbook of directions to shippers\r\ncould be prepared by the Government—something to show how goods should\r\nbe manufactured or packed, as well as cost of transportation, customs\r\nduties in foreign ports, etc.”?\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you would find your handbook growing to enormous size, until\r\nfinally it would be no less and no other than the Consular Reports. The\r\ntrouble is, or has been, that people don’t read these enough. Now, let\r\nus get an idea of what such a handbook would contain. What do you\r\nmanufacture”?\r\n\r\n“Farming machinery”.\r\n\r\n“Well, now let us suppose you have discovered that there is a market for\r\nyour merchandise in Argentina. Suppose, too, that the horses in that\r\ncountry are of lighter draft than ours: then your machines must be\r\nlightened correspondingly, and this involves a good deal of detail.\r\nAgain, their soil will differ from that for which you are manufacturing,\r\nconsequently you may have to change the shape of your plows, or the\r\nconstruction of your harrows, or the size of your drills. Again, one\r\nmust make sure that the natives can handle intricate machinery before\r\nsending any twine-binders, steam-engines, etc. Then, too, you must learn\r\nthe strong and the weak points of the machinery with which you are to\r\ncompete. So you see, when it is remembered that we have been considering\r\na few contingencies in regard to only one line of industry, and that,\r\ntoo, in only one country, the sum of the contingencies is enormous. When\r\nit comes to cottons or woolens the case is much the same; the width,\r\ntexture, color, pattern, price—everything which makes goods salable in\r\nany one country—must be known, and the advertisements put in a way that\r\nappeals to native sentiment and taste. In the Consular Reports you will\r\nget the information you need, and you will find it hard to be put in a\r\nhandbook”.\r\n\r\n“Well, as a matter of fact, I haven’t seen much of the Consular\r\nReports”, said one.\r\n\r\n“Nor I, either”, said several others, as they turned to go.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Man carrying suitcase and oversized passport]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: Pen, ink bottle and scroll.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LECTURE\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                          DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1815 the Congress of Vienna adopted seven rules for the regulation of\r\ndiplomatic intercourse. The United States was not represented at this\r\nhistoric congress—wasn’t important enough and perhaps wasn’t interested\r\nenough; but it has chosen to conform to the rules, nevertheless. The\r\nfact that we had nothing to do with the promulgation of these rules and\r\nthat we are the only power that has since grown into a commanding\r\nposition, gives us a diplomatic advantage, an independence agreeable to\r\nour national ideals and geographical situation. The first of these rules\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n“Article 1. Diplomatic agents are divided into three classes: That of\r\nAmbassadors, legates or nuncios; that of envoys, ministers or other\r\npersons accredited to sovereigns; that of chargés d’affaires accredited\r\nto ministers for foreign affairs”.\r\n\r\nThree years after the Congress of Vienna the Congress of Aix la Chapelle\r\nadds an eighth article, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“Article VIII.—It is agreed that ministers resident accredited to them”\r\n(to sovereigns, presumably) “shall form, with respect to their\r\nprecedence, an intermediate class between ministers of the second class\r\nand chargés d’affaires”.\r\n\r\nConsequently the classification of our diplomatic officers is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Ambassadors. We do not send or receive legates or nuncios, as there\r\nare representatives of the Pope, and to do so would be contrary to our\r\nnational policy respecting church and state.\r\n\r\n2. Envoys, ministers or other persons accredited to sovereigns. This\r\nclass includes that official with the ridiculously lengthy title of\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary—usually called minister\r\n“for short”.\r\n\r\n3. Ministers resident, who are usually also consuls general. There are\r\nbut four of these in our service, and as there is little justification\r\nfor this grade it will probably some day be abolished.\r\n\r\n4. Chargés d’affaires (pronounced shar-zha-daffair), who are not\r\naccredited to sovereigns, but to the minister for foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that this classification has nothing whatever\r\nto do with the transaction of business. All diplomats have essentially\r\nthe same duties to perform. It is merely a matter of precedence, which\r\nwas considered much more important at the time of the Vienna congress\r\nthan it is now. Indeed, there are good reasons for thinking that we have\r\noutgrown these distinctions and should straightway abandon them. This\r\nmuch, at least, is apparent to all—that the chief diplomatic officer at\r\nevery legation ought to be an ambassador, thus making no invidious\r\ndistinctions between countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIPLOMACY]\r\n\r\nAs it is at present we send ambassadors to the most important countries,\r\nenvoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary to those that are\r\nnext important to us, and so on. Thus there are five ambassadors; one\r\neach at London, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg and Mexico respectively,\r\nthirty envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary, four\r\nministers resident, and one who is classed as a chargé d’affaires.\r\n\r\nThere are secretaries of legation at twenty-three different capitals,\r\nwho in the absence of their chief may become chargés d’affaires\r\nexercising all the functions of a diplomatic officer. At fourteen\r\ndifferent capitals there are military or naval attachés, sometimes both,\r\nand an interpreter at six of them.\r\n\r\nLegation, or embassy, formerly meant the particular business, the\r\nerrand, so to speak, upon which the ambassador was sent.\r\n\r\nThese terms are now used more often to designate the officers themselves\r\nwho are sent on an embassy, and finally by the extension of the term\r\nthey also mean the official residence of those officers.\r\n\r\nAmerican legations as a rule have fewer members than those of other\r\ngreat nations and are much less expensive. The American diplomatic\r\nservice costs only one fourth as much as the British. Whether or not the\r\nresult is desirable upon the whole you may judge for yourselves; for\r\nwhile it must be said that we have as a rule been very well served\r\ndiplomatically, yet on the other hand one direct result of our economy\r\nis that only men of wealth can afford to be ambassadors. The cost of\r\nliving, and especially of entertaining, is so high and the salary is so\r\ninadequate that no man in ordinary circumstances can occupy a high\r\ndiplomatic position where the social requirements are burdensome.\r\n\r\nIn several cases the parsimony of the Government has been quite contrary\r\nto its own best interests. In Central and South America, for instance,\r\nwhere we ought, by all means, to be well represented, the same officer\r\nis frequently accredited to two, or even three different countries. Now,\r\nno country likes to have a representative of an inferior grade\r\naccredited to it, certainly not when a mere change of title would mend\r\nthe matter, but when it comes to being bunched together with another\r\ncountry or two by a powerful and wealthy neighbor it is almost\r\ninsulting, and the countries in question show a justifiable resentment.\r\nIn such countries we will find European nations well represented, and\r\nyet we wonder at our own loss of prestige.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nAs long as the nations have any dealings with each other as nations, so\r\nlong will it be necessary for them to have representatives, honored and\r\ntrusted by those who receive them as well as those who send them, at\r\neach other’s capitals. It might almost be said that they exist for the\r\nprevention of business—the business arising from misunderstandings—for\r\ntheir primary duty is, while representing their own nation with dignity\r\nand reserve, to cultivate friendly relations with the power to which\r\nthey are accredited, as far as circumstances will allow. To do this they\r\ninterpret the public acts of their own government as it wishes to be\r\nunderstood, and are frequently entrusted with large discretionary powers\r\nfor this purpose. Moreover, they expedite business and help to avoid\r\nannoyances in a very large measure. The government at Washington, for\r\ninstance, wishes to know the attitude of the government at Berlin upon a\r\ncertain matter without making it too formal or exaggerating its\r\nimportance, and accordingly application is made at once either to the\r\nGerman ambassador residing at Washington or to the American ambassador\r\nin Berlin, either of whom, if it lies within his discretion, gives the\r\ndesired information. If the whole thing is quietly done, so as to escape\r\ngeneral notice, it saves needless wild guessing as to what it all means;\r\nand this is greatly to be desired when things are in an acute stage, if\r\nnot at other times. The recent triumph of the “open door” policy in\r\nChina was accomplished in this quiet, effective way.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the modern conception of the function of a\r\ndiplomat makes him a resident of the country of his embassage during the\r\ntime of his appointment. Moreover, that he is not sent on any stated\r\nerrand, as for instance, the negotiation of a treaty, or as a member of\r\nan international congress. This latter, to be sure, is diplomatic\r\nbusiness, but the agents employed are usually termed commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ORIGIN.\r\n\r\nIt was in this latter sense, however, that the term ambassador was\r\noriginally used.\r\n\r\nJust when it had its origin it would be hard to say, but it was so far\r\nback in antiquity that the sanctity of religion must needs be thrown\r\nabout the persons of the officials to shield them from violence. In\r\nancient times when an ambassador went to a foreign court he went with a\r\nspecial message, and having delivered it and received a reply, his\r\nbusiness was ended and he returned homeward. His official dignity was\r\nbut little inferior to that of the sovereign. Indeed he represented not\r\nonly his country but the person of his sovereign, and he was accredited\r\nnot to any foreign minister, but directly to the sovereign. Hence his\r\nvisit, especially if friendly, was attended with an elaborate display of\r\npomp and ceremony, the exchange of gifts and courtly compliments, and it\r\nwould have been a royal sight to have beheld his journey through the\r\n\r\n                                 “lovely land ...\r\n           Whose loveliness was more resplendent made\r\n           By the mere passing of that cavalcade\r\n           With plumes and cloaks and housings, and the stir\r\n           Of jeweled bridle and of golden spur”.\r\n\r\nWhen he began to stay abroad, some four or five hundred years ago, his\r\npurpose was mischievous. He stayed to act as a court spy and intriguer,\r\nto find out secrets while keeping his own. A certain diplomat of the\r\nseventeenth century is said to have written in praise of his occupation,\r\ndiplomacy “causes sudden revolutions in great states. It excites\r\nhatreds, jealousies and seditions. It arms princes and whole nations\r\nagainst their own interests; it forms leagues and other treaties among\r\nsovereigns and peoples whose interests are quite opposed to one another;\r\nit destroys those leagues and snaps the closest ties asunder”. There is\r\nno doubt as to what this means. It is war—polite war, if you please,\r\nwhere the weapons are deception, hypocrisy, insinuation and innuendo—the\r\nmeanest kind of war, where cowards may be greater than heroes.\r\n\r\n“If they lie to you, lie still more to them”, was the naive instruction\r\ngiven by one sovereign to his ambassadors.\r\n\r\nNot to multiply instances on a point where history is unfortunately too\r\nfull, it is interesting to notice, as some one has pointed out, that\r\nwith rapid communication by train and by telegraph, court intrigues have\r\ngradually died away; for now that the capitals of the world are within\r\n“whispering distance” of each other, as it were, ambassadors have\r\nassumed a position of secondary importance to the minister for foreign\r\naffairs (or in America the Secretary of State), an officer who resides\r\nat the home capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PRECEDENCE.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, one of the questions of greatest concern at a\r\nmediaeval court was that of precedence—who was the biggest man, and the\r\nnext and so on. Talk about comic opera! In more than one historic\r\ninstance the question of precedence among diplomats, or the consequent\r\nsquabbles between their trains of attendants, fairly “out-Herods Herod”\r\nin farcicalness. “The Conferences of Ryswyk”, we are told, “were held in\r\na house which seemed to have been built for the purpose, with three\r\nseparate entrances and every convenience for preventing collisions; but\r\nit was found impossible from first to last to sit at the single table in\r\nthe rooms assigned to the mediators, because no agreement could be come\r\nto about the order of sitting; in that room they could only stand; they\r\nsat in a circle in another room where there was no table. A Latin\r\nprotocol, which had been preserved of the proceedings at Nymegen\r\neighteen years before, was produced as a precedent, but in vain; it\r\ncontained a plan of the room used at Nymegen, showing the arrangement of\r\nseats in it, together with the positions of the doors, windows and\r\nfireplace—for these things may be important in determining which is the\r\ntop and which the bottom of a table. A round table was used at Cambray,\r\nSoissons and Aix la Chapelle; but even a round table loses its\r\naccommodating quality when it is discovered that the place of honor is\r\nthat opposite the door, and that every place of honor has a right hand\r\nand a left.” A quarrel between two ambassadors’ wives has seriously\r\ninterfered with international negotiations, and a coachman’s obstinacy\r\nhas added thirty pages to the “Compleate History of the Treaty of\r\nUtrecht.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MODERN DIPLOMACY—CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that modern diplomacy has so completely changed\r\ncharacter as to lose all of its disagreeable features, for there is\r\nstill more or less mediaevalism attaching to it—at least if the popular\r\nconception be true. And perhaps in some degree it must always be so; for\r\nthe office is unique in its opportunities as well as its inducements to\r\ndissimulate, mislead and misrepresent. In the first place, the diplomat\r\nundertakes his mission under secret instructions. The public may know\r\nwhat are the duties of the consular service as fully as the consuls\r\nthemselves; but not so with the diplomatic service, for to the public it\r\nis a closed door. Moreover, our diplomat may reason with himself that\r\nbusiness of any kind involving competition is a kind of warfare; that\r\ndiplomatic business is especially so because it is international, that\r\nthere is no penalty for the breaking of an international law, and thus\r\nhe may be led to conclude that “all’s fair in love and war”, especially\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary for some if not all of the members of a legation to\r\nmaintain a “discreet inquisitiveness”; it certainly is necessary for all\r\nto know how to meet indiscreet questions with non-committal answers; yet\r\nthe finesse of diplomatic intrigue is dangerous ground and British and\r\nAmerican diplomats have, in the main, done well to avoid it. The chief\r\nof a legation especially should remember that his office is a noble one\r\nand should be kept above the stifling air of intrigue; that the dignity\r\nof a nation may easily be compromised by the mere suspicion of\r\ncomplicity therein, and that to those among whom he moves he both\r\nrepresents his country officially and typifies his countrymen\r\npersonally. The American diplomat has gained something of a reputation\r\nfor going straight at the mark—of leaving no doubt as to the attitude of\r\nhis government and the policy he is to follow, and is not this the true\r\ndiplomacy? The ruling purpose should not be to gain one’s point, but to\r\npreserve the national dignity while using all honorable means to gain\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nSo much depends upon the manner of a diplomat. Men ordinarily admire and\r\ncovet a certain plainness and directness of speech which in business may\r\namount even to bluntness. But frankness of speech which in any other\r\noccupation might prove only disadvantageous, in diplomacy amounts to a\r\ncomplete disqualification. In business a diplomat must be all ears and\r\nno tongue until the time comes for him to speak, then he must know\r\nexactly what to say and what not to say. He may feel that every man has\r\na right to an opinion and to the expression of it, but being a diplomat\r\nhe must remember that his opinion will be regarded as official whether\r\nor not he intends it so, and therefore it must be guarded religiously.\r\n\r\nIn society, somewhat to the contrary, there should be no outward\r\nindication of a studied reserve—nothing that would serve as a restraint\r\nupon his freedom of movement and conversation. He should be a man of\r\nengaging manners, of suave and polite address, and of affability and\r\nurbanity in conversation. He should not only be well trained in the\r\nusages of good society, but should also thoroughly acquaint himself with\r\nthe traditional usages and customs, the etiquette of the court where he\r\nis to reside.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ACCEPTABILITY.\r\n\r\nSince the principal purpose in sending ambassadors is to secure peace by\r\ncultivating friendly relations with other governments, it is evidently\r\nwise before making an appointment to any country to learn whether the\r\nperson whom it is expected to send is acceptable to that country.\r\nAccordingly it is customary before making the appointment public to make\r\nthe nomination privately to the foreign government and to express the\r\nhope that it will be found acceptable. Even the nominee knows nothing of\r\nit, and is thus saved the pain of rejection in case that should occur.\r\nIf there is no personal objection to the nominee, and if there is no\r\ndoubt that his country possesses full sovereignty and is therefore\r\nentitled to send ambassadors, his government is notified of the fact\r\nthat he is acceptable; but should there be any objection to him—and\r\nsometimes very trifling ones will suffice—his government is notified\r\nthat he is _persona non grata_ (not an agreeable person), and it\r\nproceeds to make other nominations. Not only has the foreign government\r\nthe right to reject a nominee but also to demand his recall at any time\r\nif there is any well grounded dissatisfaction with him. One American\r\nambassador was recalled because complaint was made about his bad\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SOVEREIGNTY OF A STATE.\r\n\r\nSince the power to send ambassadors is conditioned upon the sovereignty\r\nof a state we may be pardoned for a glance at international law for the\r\nmeaning of sovereignty. The essential attributes of a state are—\r\n\r\n  (1) Equality—in a legal sense—a small country the equal of a larger\r\n  one.\r\n  (2) Independence, freedom from all other states.\r\n  (3) Sovereignty.\r\n  (4) Fixed locality—boundary.\r\n  (5) Its people must be organized into a political society.\r\n\r\nWoolsey, who mentions the first three only, says that they “cannot exist\r\napart, and perhaps the single conception of sovereignty, or of\r\nself-protection, may include them all”. It is “the power of entering\r\ninto relations with other states and of governing its own subjects”.\r\nThus it follows that no dependency or colony can send a diplomat of any\r\nrank whatever.\r\n\r\nAfter the appointment of any one to the diplomatic service, the manner\r\nof which will be mentioned later, he must take the oath of allegiance\r\nand is then given a pamphlet of printed instructions by the State\r\nDepartment. He is furnished with a letter of credence from the President\r\nto the foreign government and is expected to reach his post within a\r\ngiven time, and to stay there until the expiration of his appointment\r\nunless he is given special permission to leave. Having reached his\r\ndestination, he is formally presented to the sovereign, unless he is a\r\nchargé d’affaires, makes calls upon his colleagues, and secures his\r\nexequatur. It is wise to make an early call upon the dean of the\r\ndiplomatic body, who is generally the oldest official member of the\r\ndiplomatic corps, for instruction as to local customs, ceremonies and\r\netiquette.\r\n\r\nOur government has generally assumed an attitude of indifference to\r\nmatters of form and ceremony—an independence which has cost it no little\r\nprestige, and its diplomats a great deal of annoyance. It should be\r\ngranted that forms and ceremonies have their place in diplomatic\r\naffairs, and that each court or capital has a right to its own\r\nlong-established usages. But we have rather been inclined to turn up our\r\nnoses at such foreign nonsense, forgetting that in matters of form there\r\nis sound discretion in the precept, “When in Rome do as the Romans do”.\r\nBut the government seems to have cared less for the art of being\r\nagreeable than for the science of being successful, regardless of the\r\nfact that in diplomacy the one is a prerequisite to the other. Two\r\nillustrations of this may be given—the appointment of ambassadors and\r\nthe question of a diplomatic uniform.\r\n\r\nIt is only within the present decade that the United States has begun to\r\nexercise its constitutional right to be represented wherever it chooses\r\nby diplomats of the first rank, i. e., ambassadors. Previously its\r\nhighest representatives abroad were diplomats of the second rank, i. e.,\r\nministers, who though thoroughly competent to handle the business were\r\nsimply out-ranked by every ambassador of every second or third rate\r\npower in the world. This we could afford to ignore so far as it is\r\nmerely a question of sentiment, but when it compels an American diplomat\r\nafter waiting hours for an audience to give place to any ambassador who\r\nhappens along, and when it implies an acceptance on our part of a\r\nsecondary place among the nations, it is sheer nonsense to continue the\r\npractice. Our reasons were, first an ambassador is supposed to represent\r\nthe person of his sovereign, and as we have no sovereign we should have\r\nno ambassadors; and second, the office itself was supposed to involve a\r\ngreater outlay of money and a more gorgeous and elaborate display than\r\nwas consistent with the simplicity of republican tastes.\r\n\r\nAs to the diplomatic uniform, which is not the same thing as a court\r\ndress, by the way, the same objections have been urged. The mistake that\r\nwe have made is in assuming that “the rule should emanate from home, and\r\nnot from abroad”; for while we have an undoubted right to establish our\r\nown customs at our national capital, others might be excused for\r\nthinking us priggish when we attempt to carry those customs abroad,\r\nespecially when in defiance of customs in general usage and of long\r\nstanding. But so it stands recorded in the statutes, that American\r\ndiplomatic officers shall wear no distinguishing uniform; and as a\r\nconsequence, at an evening reception in some brilliant foreign capital\r\nyou will see the diplomatic corps of other nations appropriately\r\ndistinguished, while the American diplomat appears in the costume worn\r\nby the servants and waiters, that is, plain evening dress. What\r\ndiplomats sometime complain of in this connection is not the lack of\r\ndistinction, but that they are rather unpleasantly distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PRIVILEGES.\r\n\r\nAn ambassador enjoys unusual privileges from the time he enters until\r\nthe time he leaves the country where he is sent, and these we will now\r\nbriefly consider. They have been classified under the heads of\r\ninviolability and exterritoriality, though they may be considered\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nInviolability means that “neither public authority nor private persons\r\ncan use any force or do any violence to him, without offending against\r\nthe law of nations”. Of course if he attempts any violence toward other\r\nindividuals he becomes amenable to the local authorities.\r\n\r\nExterritoriality means the right while sojourning in a foreign country\r\nto remain subject to the laws of his own, in both criminal and civil\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThese privileges are granted because it is thought that an ambassador\r\ncannot fully and freely represent his own country if he is liable to be\r\ninterfered with by the state to which he is accredited. When carried out\r\nto their practical application some curious results are reached; for\r\ninstance—\r\n\r\n1. These privileges extend to his goods and his lodgings. “His house is\r\na sanctuary—except in case of a gross crime—for himself and his\r\nretinue”. His official papers and archives are inviolate. He cannot\r\nshelter any fugitive from law, although even this—the right of\r\nasylum—was at one time general.\r\n\r\n2. The courtesy of exemption from taxation is usually extended to\r\nambassadors, as well as exemption from duties on all necessary articles\r\nof his household.\r\n\r\n3. Owing to the inviolability of his property it is hard to collect a\r\ndebt from an ambassador when he has a mind not to pay—a thing which has\r\nhappened more than once.\r\n\r\n4. The right to his own form of worship is granted to an ambassador and\r\nhis retinue, even when his religion is not otherwise tolerated by the\r\nlaws of the land. In this latter case it is sometimes provided that it\r\nmust be simply “house worship—without bell, organ or other sign\r\nindicating to passengers in the street that a chapel is near by”;—“a\r\nnative of the country cannot attend”, and the “chaplain must not appear\r\nabroad in his canonicals”.\r\n\r\n5. Exemptions from local jurisdiction apply to the secretary of\r\nlegation, the chaplain, physician, private secretary and even to\r\ndomestic servants. They apply even to domestic servants who are natives\r\nof the country though in a limited degree.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Diplomatic Ball\r\n\r\n  See page 141\r\n]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n6. The jurisdiction of an ambassador over the members of his train is\r\nlimited to minor matters. A criminal would be sent home for trial, the\r\nambassador collecting and forwarding all the evidence.\r\n\r\nI have purposely deferred the subject of the selection of diplomatic\r\nofficers until after a consideration of the service itself, in order\r\nthat we may the better understand what is needed in such an officer.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the requirements for a successful diplomat are\r\nwholly unlike those for a consul. To be successful in the consular\r\nservice one must first of all be a good business man. One should have a\r\nmind for details, a quick and keen commercial insight, an acquaintance\r\nwith the material facts of life, and the proper training would be that\r\nof the merchant or the journalist, supplemented in some cases by that of\r\nthe lawyer and jurist. There is a definite, body of information which a\r\nconsul should have at his command, a body of rules whose authority he\r\nmust not transgress, and in the transaction of his business if he looks\r\nto precedent it is only for present guidance.\r\n\r\nThe diplomat on the other hand should first of all be a statesman. To\r\nbelong to the first rank, along with the greatest in the world, he must\r\nhave the gift of prophecy and the grace to keep it quiet. In the pursuit\r\nof a great national ambition he should have wisdom to foresee, genius to\r\nplan and tact to execute. His study is of men, the history and the\r\npolitical institutions of men, the history and tendencies of his own\r\ntimes, and the capacities and characteristics of different races. These\r\nthings are his science, furnishing the basis for his art, that art which\r\nBacon called the highest of all—the art of “working” men. He cannot, in\r\nthe nature of the case, expect to receive very definite instruction from\r\nhis government, unless it be upon a specific line of policy and an\r\nacquaintance with the treaties between the two countries. Precedents are\r\nof value to him as a guide to present action, but more especially as\r\naffecting future policy; for a nation’s foreign policy is influential\r\namong other nations and satisfactory at home in proportion as it is\r\nself-consistent and just. In great international emergencies the\r\ndiplomat sometimes does the work of a military chieftain, but with these\r\ndifferences: his means are peaceful, his warfare is necessarily in\r\nsecret, the results are bloodless, and, when all is done, the skill with\r\nwhich he has fought is seldom recognized except by the historian.\r\n\r\nFortunately the practical problem of choosing men for the diplomatic\r\nservice does not contemplate deeds of such momentous character—at least\r\nnot for beginners—but it does indicate the magnitude of the scale of\r\noperations sometimes carried on by this service which makes history no\r\nless than do military campaigns. It is evident, moreover, that no course\r\nof study however long can prepare a man for the diplomatic service,\r\nexcept in an elementary way. It goes without saying that such elementary\r\npreparation should be made before entering the service, and that it\r\nshould include among other essentials a knowledge of French, Spanish or\r\nGerman, especially the first which has been called the language of\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the only satisfactory preparation for the diplomatic\r\nservice is experience. Some years ago the United States began a system,\r\npursued more or less by other nations, of appointing young men to\r\nvarious legations as attachés without salary. In this capacity they\r\nbecame acquainted with diplomats and the “ins and outs” of diplomacy,\r\nand incidentally gave their superiors a chance to discover their fitness\r\nor unfitness for the service. The advantages of such a system, which has\r\nbeen abandoned except as to the appointment of military and naval\r\nattachés, must be apparent to all, and it is hard to see why it should\r\nnot be reinstated.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of definite training and knowledge to furnish a basis for\r\nexamination the diplomatic service is either exceptionally fortunate or\r\nexceptionally unfortunate. As long as the good of the service is kept\r\nchiefly in view in the selection of candidates, even though the service\r\nbe regarded as political, it is well that technical knowledge cannot\r\ninterfere seriously with the appointment of the most promising\r\ncandidate. On the other hand, when the service is regarded as a\r\nlegitimate means of rewarding political friends it will suffer all the\r\nmore for the want of a restraint such as the examination affords, just\r\nas with the consular service, only in a greater degree.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic officers are more apt to change with the change of\r\nadministration than are consular officers, for the reason that the\r\nservice itself is more political in character. Some authorities go so\r\nfar as to justify the change on the ground that the administration ought\r\nto be unrestricted in carrying out its policy, and therefore should be\r\nrepresented abroad by those of its own political faith just as it is in\r\nthe cabinet. It must be admitted that there is a great deal to justify\r\nthis contention, but it should be said that the analogy with the\r\nPresident’s cabinet is hardly fair; for in the latter case the parties\r\nare the units, and we recognize the right of the stronger party to full\r\nexecutive power; but in the case of the ambassadors the nation is the\r\nunit which he represents, not the party. Theoretically the change of\r\ndiplomatic officials with the change of administration cannot be\r\njustified, and practically a sweeping change is certainly demoralizing\r\nto our interests. In the most important positions, however, it may\r\nsometimes be best that the President be allowed to substitute those of\r\nhis own party.\r\n\r\nWith the present system of recruiting the diplomatic service the most\r\nessential point is to lodge the testing power in the hands of capable\r\nand incorruptible men, so that those who are “appointed for examination”\r\nwill not necessarily pass because of the influence which supports them.\r\n\r\nI will now leave the subject with you, merely remarking in closing that\r\ndiplomacy, especially American diplomacy, which lies outside of and\r\nbeyond our present theme, is of fascinating interest and will well repay\r\ncareful study. Our diplomatic history is brief, but it is glorious,\r\nchiefly because it has made for righteousness and peace, not to\r\nourselves only but to all the world.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Professor, will you kindly give the remainder of the articles of the\r\nCongress of Vienna”?\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Besides the first and the last which have already been\r\ngiven, they are as follows:\r\n\r\n“Art. II. Ambassadors, legates, or nuncios only have the representative\r\ncharacter; (that is, can represent the person of the sovereign).\r\n\r\n“Art. III. Diplomatic agents on an extraordinary mission have not, on\r\nthat account, any superiority of rank; (e. g., our commissioners at the\r\nHague conference would not for that reason outrank our diplomatic\r\nrepresentative there, supposing the latter not to be a commissioner).\r\n\r\n“Art. IV. Diplomatic officers shall take precedence in their respective\r\nclasses according to the date of the official notification of their\r\narrival. The present regulation shall not cause any innovation with\r\nregard to the representative of the Pope.\r\n\r\n“Art. V. A uniform mode shall be determined in each state for the\r\nreception of diplomatic agents of each class.\r\n\r\n“Art. VI. Relations of consanguinity or of family alliance between\r\ncourts confer no precedence on their diplomatic agents. The same rule\r\napplies also to political alliances.\r\n\r\n“Art. VII. In acts or treaties between several powers which grant\r\nalternate precedence, the order which is to be observed in the\r\nsignatures shall be decided by lot between the ministers.”\r\n\r\nQ. “Are these the only international rules concerning diplomats”?\r\n\r\nA. “They are the only ones given in the Diplomatic and Consular\r\nRegister”.\r\n\r\nQ. “Are they universally accepted”?\r\n\r\nA. “By all except Turkey, which recognizes but three grades—ambassadors,\r\nministers and chargés d’affaires”.\r\n\r\nQ. “Suppose we send a diplomat of the second rank to any country: have\r\nwe a right to receive one of the same grade in return”?\r\n\r\nA. “Certainly, and no more. Italy, however, sends us an ambassador,\r\nwhile our representative to Italy is a minister”.\r\n\r\nQ. “Professor, you will allow me to disagree with you upon the propriety\r\nof wearing a uniform”?\r\n\r\nA. “Certainly, what have you to say”?\r\n\r\nQ. “Well, nothing new; it is only that as a people we have taken a\r\nwise stand in favor of simplicity as opposed to meaningless\r\nconventionalities, and that it should characterize all our official\r\nrelations with foreign powers, otherwise we would seem to compromise\r\nour position”.\r\n\r\nA. “I’ll admit,” said the Professor, “that yours is the view ordinarily\r\ntaken and officially adopted in our country. But I still maintain that\r\nit is a wrong view because it is founded upon a wrong principle, namely\r\nthat ‘the rule should emanate from home’. Why, suppose you go to visit a\r\nneighbor and you find that the rules of his household are somewhat\r\nunlike your own: would you not as far as possible try to conform to\r\nthem? Of course you would; and the complaisance that is to be expected\r\nbetween neighbors is a duty as between ambassadors, because it is their\r\nbusiness to remove friction, not to create it. Oh, well, these are\r\ntrifles and need not be dwelt upon were it not that they are conspicuous\r\ntrifles.\r\n\r\n“But the mention of these matters of etiquette reminds me of a\r\nsuggestion by Schuyler, to the effect that a bureau of ceremonies should\r\nbe added to the State Department—just as in Paris there is a Service du\r\nProtocol—both to facilitate its correspondence and to serve as an\r\nintermediary between the Department and foreign diplomats in Washington.\r\nThere are many reasons—small in themselves, but rather weighty taken\r\ntogether, why this suggestion is worth heeding. The Master of Ceremonies\r\nplays a very important as well as a conspicuous part in nearly every\r\ncapital except Washington; and perhaps he is all the more necessary with\r\nus because we have so little ceremony”.\r\n\r\nAfter dismission a group of ladies was observed in earnest conversation\r\nwaiting for a word with the Professor, who soon advanced with: “Do you\r\nwish to speak to me”?\r\n\r\n“Oh, we were just wondering”, said one of them, “why women wouldn’t make\r\ngood ambassadors”.\r\n\r\n“They do”, said the Professor, “and excellent ones, too, for women are\r\ngenerally diplomats both by nature and training”.\r\n\r\n“I never heard of one’s being appointed”.\r\n\r\n“No, it is always her husband that is appointed; but this is dangerous\r\nground. It is a fact well known in the service that a discreet wife can\r\nalmost double her husband’s efficiency. In the first place she hears as\r\nmuch gossip as he does—as much, I say—and if she can keep it, why that\r\nis the best way that a diplomat can learn what is going on. But aside\r\nfrom court gossip, a great deal of an ambassador’s influence depends\r\nupon his position in society and this in turn depends very much upon the\r\nkind of wife he has. An indiscreet wife, one who is over fond of gossip,\r\nor under fond of society, might be a positive disqualification for the\r\nbest kind of ambassador. It should go without saying that the wife\r\nshould be patriotic; only sometimes diplomats will marry abroad. On this\r\npoint Schuyler says that Bismarck always insisted that German diplomats\r\nshould marry German wives. Women are very important social factors at\r\nevery capital, and even sovereigns find that they are to be reckoned\r\nwith. A good story is told by Schuyler which illustrates this fact and\r\nwhich shows at the same time what diplomacy can do in small things. I\r\ngive it as nearly as I recall in his words:\r\n\r\n“The court of Vienna is bound by very strict rules of etiquette, which\r\nnot even the Emperor feels at liberty to overstep. And the society of\r\nVienna has adopted still stricter ones. In order for an Austrian lady to\r\nbe able to appear at court, she must show at least four generations of\r\nnobility. It is said that some years ago when the first bourgeois\r\nministers were appointed in Austria, while they were officially invited\r\nto a court ball, their wives were omitted. The ladies were indignant and\r\nbrought a sufficient pressure to bear upon the husbands to induce them\r\nto resign their offices if their wives were not invited to the ball. The\r\nEmperor was in a dilemma, for he could not dispense with such useful\r\nministers, neither could he override the rules of court etiquette. He\r\nadopted, however, a very simple expedient—he ennobled the long-deceased\r\ngreat-grandfathers of the ladies in question, which thus gave them the\r\npersonal right to appear”.\r\n\r\n“Have diplomats nothing better to do than simply to get along peaceably\r\nwith each other”?\r\n\r\n“It must be confessed that in spite of the grand part they are expected\r\nto play upon occasion, a large share of their time and attention is\r\ndevoted to the art of being agreeable—not a mean art in its way, though\r\nit demands attention to trifles after a fashion that would be\r\nexasperating to some minds.”\r\n\r\n“Then I understand that it is in this exasperating art, the minor\r\ntactics of diplomacy, that women have the credit of excelling”?\r\n\r\n“It is in this that they certainly do excel; and indeed in major tactics\r\nor world politics one need not ask for a better diplomat for her day and\r\nher nation than ‘Good Queen Bess’, not to mention other illustrious\r\nexamples”.\r\n\r\n“Well”, said one of the ladies, as they turned to go, “since to be an\r\nambassador a woman must either be born one or marry one, why we might as\r\nwell settle down to minor tactics where we are; so have a care,\r\nProfessor, for we may not have learned the art of being agreeable”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRECEDENCE]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Man looking at large map on desktop]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LECTURE\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                        UNCLE SAM AND EXPANSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Sam has lately gone abroad after an entirely new fashion—new at\r\nleast to him.\r\n\r\nHe went to Hawaii only after repeated and urgent invitation; hesitating\r\nbecause he thought it was against his principles.\r\n\r\nHe went to Cuba to help the people to get rid of their rubbish.\r\n\r\nHe went to Porto Rico because he thought that he was needed.\r\n\r\nHe went to the Philippines on a business trip, and is there yet. He will\r\nprobably make up his mind to stay there though he is still halting a\r\nlittle. In less than a year he will have decided, and in the meantime he\r\nwill do some hard thinking about it, just as he has been doing since May\r\n1, 1898.\r\n\r\nIt is to this problem that we will now address ourselves—for it is still\r\na problem with some—not to questions of method in administration, which\r\nshould be determined by experience, but to the ethical, political and\r\npractical considerations involved in the term expansion, or if you\r\nplease, imperialism.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the occupation of the Philippines by the United States is\r\nregarded by the average American citizen as a moral question. “Is it\r\nright to extend our authority over the Philippines, even, if necessary,\r\nby force of arms”? This is the question we all have been asking\r\nourselves, the question that the “anti-imperialists” have promptly\r\nanswered in the negative, while the great majority of opinion seems to\r\nbe slowly swinging in the opposite direction, in agreement with the\r\npresent administration.\r\n\r\nBut the answer to this question, startling as it may seem, is that it is\r\nnot primarily an ethical question, whatever ethical phases it may have.\r\n“What,” you ask, “do not all governments derive their just powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed?” Well, let us see about that; and in order\r\nto see clearly and dispassionately let us get outside of America as it\r\nwere, so that we may look at this proposition from a convenient\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nPeople sometimes make mistakes. Whole nations sometimes make the same\r\nmistake. Indeed, on a fundamental proposition a whole civilization\r\nduring successive periods of history covering many centuries has been\r\nknown to swing from one extreme to the other and backward again. Such\r\nmovements are often likened to the swing of a mighty pendulum, or better\r\nstill, to the rising and narrowing coils of a spiral.\r\n\r\nNaturally, one of the subjects upon which men have thought the most and\r\ndisagreed the most and therefore made the most mistakes is the relation\r\nof the individual to the state. Less than three centuries ago one of the\r\nfundamental maxims of government was that the individual exists for the\r\nstate and not the state for the individual. This is one extreme. Up to\r\nthe time of Rousseau there was no marked philosophical change upon this\r\nsubject on the continent of Europe. With him and those after him began\r\nthat marvelous reaction—that tidal wave of philosophic thought and\r\npopular conviction away from absolutism and in the direction of the\r\nrights of man. If this movement should reach its climax in the opposite\r\nextreme it would mean anarchy—and that is what it reached in the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nIt was but a few years before its climax, however, that our own\r\nDeclaration of Independence was written, the writers whereof were\r\nthoroughly in sympathy with the movement toward the rights of man. Hence\r\nwe hear in America the calm statement, “We believe that all men are by\r\nnature free and equal”, while in France we hear the frenzied cry,\r\n“Liberty! Equality! Fraternity!”\r\n\r\nThe individual has at last secured his long coveted freedom. But it is\r\nonly to be confronted with a still greater question, namely: What is he\r\nto do with his freedom? How is he to use it?\r\n\r\nWell, what has he done with it? In America, as elsewhere,\r\nnotwithstanding his political creed, he has wisely decided that the\r\ninsane must not enjoy either freedom or equality with other men. No more\r\ncan criminals; no more do women. Why? If all have a right to these\r\nthings, who dares take it away?\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a point beyond the statement of the Declaration, a\r\npoint, however, that must have been in the minds of the writers, namely,\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n      SELF-GOVERNMENT IS NOT SO MUCH A RIGHT AS IT IS A CAPACITY.\r\n\r\nHave you a right to vote, and if so where did you get it? You may answer\r\nthese questions just as you please; but the fact is, if you go insane or\r\ncommit a crime the government takes away your right to vote because of\r\nyour incapacity. You are assumed to have the capacity and therefore the\r\nright unless it is proved to the contrary; but let it not be forgotten\r\nthat the capacity is fundamental and antecedent to the right, otherwise\r\nour theory will always seem inconsistent with our practice.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what mystifies so many of us just now. We have made no\r\nmistake in our practice, but we have made a mistake in trying to justify\r\nthe practice by an unfounded theory, and it doesn’t work. We as a nation\r\nhave simply been idealizing the rights of man, liberty and\r\nself-government, forgetting that these are all secondary to capacity,\r\njust as did the eighteenth century doctrinaires.\r\n\r\nSo far with the analogy. Now, can any one give a good, valid reason why\r\nthe same conclusions would not apply to a community or tribe or race\r\nwithin a state which is held to be incapable—the Indians, for instance,\r\nor the emancipated slaves? Certainly not. Now, is there any ethical\r\nreason why the same conclusions would not apply to an incompetent\r\nnation? Certainly not. The difficulty to be encountered is a practical\r\none, because, first, there is no international court to decide upon the\r\ncapacity of a race to govern itself, and, second, there is no\r\ninternational power to act as guardian for incompetent or backward\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nHow is it with the family of nations to-day? A few of them are forging\r\nahead at a marvelous rate, a good many more are like Micawber’s wife,\r\ncontinually _in statu quo_, while others still are suffering a\r\nnoticeable decline, and finally there are races or tribes which have\r\nnever been organized into states or nations, and which if left to\r\nthemselves probably never will be. And to what shall we liken this\r\nfamily of nations? It is like a settlement beyond the frontier of\r\ncivilization, with no law above them except a neighborhood agreement—a\r\nsettlement made up of a few progressive men, a number of “ne’er do\r\nweels”, several idiots and insane and a number of dissolutes. The best\r\nthat one could hope for in such a situation would be for the progressive\r\nmen to infuse some life and energy into the “ne’er do weels”, remove all\r\ndestructive agencies from the hands of the idiots and insane and put the\r\ndissolutes under watch and ward. Instead, however, the state of things\r\nthat we actually see is this: the dissolutes are rebellious, the idiots\r\nare idiots, the “ne’er do weels” are suspicious, and worst of all, the\r\nprogressive men are jealous of each other. In the absence of\r\ncohesiveness and harmony in this settlement, one of these progressive\r\nmen has shown a disposition sometimes domineering, sometimes kindly, but\r\na disposition nevertheless to maintain law and order, and a fondness for\r\nhaving a hand in enforcing it, and that man is Mr. Anglo-Saxon. He never\r\nputs his hand to this business without calling down the imprecations of\r\nthe whole neighborhood upon himself as a tyrant, and yet freedom,\r\nprosperity and progress go with him. He doesn’t believe much in passive\r\ngoodness. He has learned the lesson of self-government and he proposes\r\nto teach it to his less progressive neighbors whether or no; and when\r\nthey have once learned it they may stay under his protection or not,\r\njust as they please, and the significant fact is that they are not only\r\nglad to stay but to fight for him when they have once learned his idea\r\nof freedom.\r\n\r\nA fanatic may say, “I prefer my own government, not because it is the\r\nbest, but because it is mine”. That may well be as between two\r\nprogressive nations, but as between a progressive and a retrograde or\r\nincompetent government, it is sheer fanaticism. It avails nothing in\r\nsuch a case to quote the words of Lincoln: “No man is good enough to\r\ngovern another man against that other man’s consent”, for these words\r\nwere uttered concerning human bondage which is by no means analogous to\r\na loss of independence by a state. Canada has no political independence,\r\ntechnically, but are Canadians in bondage? Are the Australians, the\r\nHindus, the Egyptians, in bondage?\r\n\r\nNo nation has a right to remain in the backwoods (pardon the homely\r\nexpression). The facilities for travel and inter-communication are so\r\nvastly improved the “double coincidence of wants and possessions” has\r\nbecome so general, the bar of language, custom, religion and race is so\r\nrapidly disappearing—in a word, the nations of the earth are becoming\r\nsuch near neighbors to each other that each must be personally\r\ninterested, so to speak, in the welfare of the others. If a man’s\r\nnearest neighbors are some miles distant, the way they get their living\r\nor govern their households may be of small interest to him; but let them\r\nmove up to adjoining lots and it makes a world of difference whether\r\ntheir business is reputable, and whether their households are quiet and\r\norderly.\r\n\r\nNo nation is safe when it remains in the backwoods. When two races, a\r\nmore civilized and a less civilized, come into close quarters as\r\nneighbors the latter must improve or go to the wall. And this is not so\r\nmuch a moral as it is a physical question; for an area of land that will\r\nsupport one hunter will support a hundred farmers, and nature is\r\neconomic in this as in every other matter. It is not so much that the\r\nweak must yield to the strong as it is that the ineffectual must give\r\nway to the effectual—just the ordinary law of evolution.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “No Nation has a right\r\n  to remain\r\n  in the backwoods”\r\n\r\n  See page 169.\r\n]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLike all natural laws it is merciless; and being a natural law it is\r\nneither to be condemned nor justified; yet again, like other natural\r\nlaws, its rigor may and should be mitigated. In short, the superior race\r\nshould regard the inferior much as a schoolmaster does an intractable\r\nyouth, who must be dealt with kindly and patiently, admonished\r\nrepeatedly and perhaps punished severely.\r\n\r\nNo nation has a right to remain in the backwoods. A country that shuts\r\nits eyes to progress in other lands, a people whose all-sufficient\r\nanswer is, “What was good enough for our fathers is good enough for us”,\r\na nation which stands for tyranny, for corruption, for instability, for\r\nretrogression, of any sort, has no one to blame but itself when the\r\nwidening breach which separates it from advancing civilization is closed\r\nwith a violence that destroys its identity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MENACE.]\r\n\r\nAn unstable government is a standing menace to all neighboring\r\ngovernments. It is the rottenness of Turkey, more than the cupidity of\r\nthe powers, that constantly endangers the peace of Europe. It was the\r\nrottenness of Spanish colonial administration and not our own cupidity,\r\nthat brought on the Spanish war. It is the turbulence of the South\r\nAmerican republics rather than their weakness, that in spite of the\r\nprotection of the Monroe doctrine may yet invite European intervention.\r\nThe culpability of the incompetent powers is a theme we hear much less\r\nabout than the “rapacity” of the “harpy powers”—and why? Because of that\r\nchildish tendency to take the part of the “under dog”, no matter whose\r\nthe fault.\r\n\r\nIt would seem a necessary conclusion, therefore, that whenever a people\r\ndemonstrates its incapacity to learn self-government by its own unaided\r\neffort, or whenever from any cause its civilization is far in the rear\r\nof the times, that the best interests both of itself and of the rest of\r\nhumanity demand that it be placed under a governmental pedagogue, at\r\nleast until it attains its majority. And this is no less true though the\r\npeople rebel and many lives be lost, provided that it means progress for\r\nthe race—“the greatest good to the greatest number”. Who would claim\r\nthat Egypt would be better off without the wise guidance of England, or\r\nwho now counts the lives that were lost in India in the establishment of\r\nher beneficent reign?\r\n\r\nHence, not all governments derive their just powers from the consent of\r\nthe governed, for this sublime statement of the Declaration applies to\r\nthose only who are fit for self-government. We hold it now as we always\r\nhave held it, a governmental ideal which we mean to realize; for in\r\npractice we never have followed it in our dealings with the Indians, and\r\nwe never made a greater mistake than in following it too literally in\r\nthe days of “reconstruction”.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the Philippine question, coming upon us as it\r\ndid, all unlooked for and unsought, made our duty all the more\r\nunmistakable. No time was given to judge of the capacity of the people\r\nfor self-government, nor to ask whether ours was the nation to assume\r\nsovereignty. We were simply confronted with a situation. The logic of\r\nevents (or shall we not say the hand of Providence?) had placed upon us\r\na responsibility which, whether desirable or undesirable, we could not\r\nshirk. We stood sponsor to the world for the islands, the sovereignty\r\nover which we had destroyed. As a question of international law there\r\ncould be no doubt of our sovereignty.\r\n\r\n“But”, says the anti-imperialist, “this is ignoring the rights of the\r\ninhabitants”, and then he proceeds in academic fashion to solve the\r\nwhole problem by a very simple syllogism, thus:\r\n\r\nMajor premise—All just government is founded upon the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nMinor premise—The natives of the Philippines are in need of a just\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nConclusion—The Philippines should be left to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd this pleasant bit of sophistry actually passes for argument among\r\nthose who do not stop to see the gaps in it—who do not reflect that a\r\ngovernment is a growth, and not a mere artificial structure to be\r\nerected by inexperienced hands—who do not reflect that something is due\r\nto international comity, and that the nations would certainly have to be\r\nreckoned with in the advent of a new power—and finally, who will not\r\ngive candid consideration to the unanimous testimony of such men as\r\nSchurman, Worcester, Denby, Otis and Dewey to the effect that “no tie of\r\nrace, religion, sympathy or common interest of any kind holds the\r\nnatives together or justifies a belief in their capacity for\r\nself-government”!\r\n\r\nBut other objections are raised against American occupation of the\r\nPhilippines. It is alleged that it is contrary to our traditional\r\npolicy; that it is in disregard of the advice of Washington to “avoid\r\nentangling alliances”; that it sacrifices our “splendid isolation”, and\r\nmakes us more vulnerable to a foreign enemy.\r\n\r\nAll these objections—if objections they are—must be met by a frank\r\nadmission. But it is worth while to inquire into their validity as\r\nobjections—to see whether they should have as much weight henceforth as\r\nthey have had in the past; for we must all see very plainly that the\r\npolicy of “expansion” involves a radical change in our world relations—a\r\nchange somewhat at variance with our historic policy.\r\n\r\nLet me not be misunderstood when I say that a certain reserve (to use no\r\nstronger term) has always characterized our government—not our citizens,\r\nmind you, but our government—that we have exhibited toward the “Old\r\nWorld” such an attitude as, who should say—“We have come out into this\r\nNew World to escape the tyranny of the Old. We have explored it,\r\nconquered it, settled it, and then won our independence from the Old. We\r\nconsider our land and its government peculiarly suited to become the\r\n‘land of the free and the home of the brave’—‘a home for the oppressed\r\nof all nations’. We intend to stay at home and not meddle in your\r\naffairs, and we expect you to do the same”.\r\n\r\nAn attitude such as this is just what one would expect in the light of\r\ncolonial and revolutionary history. But there is another—a politic\r\nreason: a weak power with a flattering prospect of becoming a great one\r\nis just such a prize as would tempt the cupidity of stronger powers;\r\nhence it would desire nothing so much as to be let alone. Such a power\r\nshould above all things “avoid entangling alliances”—keep to itself\r\nuntil its strength is developed. Such a power we were when those words\r\nwere uttered, and such we remained as long as the schism of slavery\r\nexisted, so that never did we realize our full, united strength until\r\ncalled into action against Spain. Up to the present, then, Washington’s\r\nadvice has proved sound policy.\r\n\r\nWhat then; are we about to abandon it? No, but we are about to abandon a\r\nperverted interpretation of it and that, too, not so much from choice as\r\nfrom necessity. We are beginning to see that a measure of prudence for a\r\nweak power is by no means equally wise when that power has grown strong.\r\nWe are beginning to see, also, that a false interpretation of it has\r\nsomehow become common, which would confine our activities, save in a\r\ncommercial way, to our own boundaries. It somehow assumes that we are as\r\nlarge and influential now as we were ever intended to be; that our\r\nfuture development is to be altogether internal.\r\n\r\nTo admit the truth of this—to admit that there is a limit to the area of\r\nour country beyond which it is imprudent to go, to admit that our\r\ncountry, being a republic, cannot consistently possess or successfully\r\nadminister any foreign territory, whether detached points of military\r\nand commercial importance or portions of mainland—to admit all this is\r\nto admit the inability of our government to hold its own with the best.\r\nThe “government” in England is no less democratic than the\r\n“administration” in America, and yet England leads the world in\r\ncolonization.\r\n\r\nExpansion in its broadest sense is not new. It is as old, almost, as the\r\ngovernment itself. We have merely come to the point of extending its\r\napplication to other lands, as England has long been doing, and that,\r\ntoo, at a time when rapid transit and communication have simplified the\r\ntask inconceivably. The policy of expansion was in the air in\r\n1893—though it had not yet received a name—when the weight of public\r\nopinion demanded of our executive that the Hawaiian Islands should not\r\nbe restored to an incompetent queen. Americans have not yet forgotten\r\ntheir chagrin, nor how European diplomats laughed at the spectacle of\r\nthe “Great Republic”, wanting so much to do the thing it ought while\r\nimagining that its hands were tied by the stay-at-home tradition. This\r\nsame timidity or reticence or reserve or self-distrust or\r\nself-satisfaction, call it by whichever term you choose, has already\r\nlost for us the Samoan Islands (save one), Hayti and other strategic\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThere is some gratification to be sure in being able to show the world,\r\nas we have done, an example of a country which is not grasping for\r\nterritory—which can even reject a point of advantage offered by the\r\ninhabitants thereof, feeling that the sacrifice of territory is better\r\nfor us than the sacrifice of the principle of self-government for them.\r\nBut in neither Samoa nor Hayti has the subsequent history of those\r\nplaces justified our rejection of them, either for their sake or our\r\nown. Moreover as far as its influence on the world is concerned it seems\r\nto have failed of its effect, if one may judge by the accusation of\r\navarice that assailed us at the outbreak of the Spanish war.\r\n\r\nIt took more than the Philippine question, more than the Spanish war, to\r\ninaugurate the policy of “expansion”. These merely furnished the\r\noccasion for that toward which the progress of the world was leading us.\r\nTo put it in a word—we have expanded because our “splendid isolation” is\r\ngone, rather than that our isolation is gone because we have expanded;\r\nand our isolation is gone because of the progress of the world.\r\n\r\nThe great international factors of to-day, bringing the nations into\r\ncommon markets and common councils, pouring the commerce, news,\r\nliterature, customs, life, of each into all the others, are the\r\nsteamship and the cable. These have done more for America, probably,\r\nthan for any other nation; for more than any other agency they have\r\ndestroyed her isolation. But they have done even more than that; for\r\nthey have made her virtually central.\r\n\r\nIt was customary a few years ago—is yet in some quarters—to speak of the\r\nPacific Ocean as if it were the backyard of the globe. It was imagined\r\nby one devout geographer that the hand of an all-wise Providence could\r\nbe seen in arranging it so that the most civilized countries of the\r\nearth front upon the same ocean—the Atlantic. But the improvement of the\r\nsteamship is equivalent to the reduction of distance, and this added to\r\nthe establishment of bases of traffic virtually narrows the Pacific down\r\nto a smaller ocean than the Atlantic used to be. Thus America, between\r\nthe great manufacturing centers of Europe and the greatest of markets in\r\nAsia, with the best of pathways to each, seems destined to become the\r\ncentral market of the world; and with the Nicaragua canal severing the\r\nIsthmus and the cable crossing the Pacific her position will be made all\r\nthe more central as well as defensible.\r\n\r\nAs a mere matter of policy, why should we not adopt expansion? Who ever\r\nknew a recluse of a nation to attain to national greatness of any kind,\r\nor to send forth leaders of men? In such a nation one inevitable result\r\nmust be the provincializing and sectionalizing of men and measures,\r\nuntil breadth of statesmanship and catholicity of sympathy are unknown.\r\nAmericans may well profit by contrasting the statesmanship of her\r\nconsuls and diplomats abroad with that of certain leaders at home. The\r\nformer, accustomed to view the national policy from without are\r\npractically unanimous so far as they have expressed themselves in urging\r\nthat we come out of our seclusion. “Happily”, says one, “such an ideal\r\nis as impossible as it is ignoble and retrograde. Impelled by\r\nirresistible forces we are already beginning to look outward, and are\r\npreparing to take the high place among the nations to which our strength\r\nentitles us. We should be unworthy members of the stout-hearted race to\r\nwhich we belong if we were daunted by the dangers and burdens of the\r\nwider activities upon which we are entering”.\r\n\r\nThe matter of greatest concern in the policy of expansion is, after all,\r\nnot financial or political gain, but the reflex influence upon the\r\nindividual citizen, and here we can only speculate. It is alleged on the\r\none hand that expansion offers opportunities for corruption such as we\r\nnever have known in municipal misgovernment, that it will lodge power in\r\nthe hands of officials at a distance from those to whom they are\r\nresponsible, that our treatment of inferior races at home does not\r\njustify our undertaking the same thing abroad, and that it is downright\r\nhypocrisy for us, a democratic people, to attempt the government of any\r\nother people.\r\n\r\nThere are certain defects common to all of these objections. It should\r\nbe noticed, in the first place, that they seize upon the most\r\nconspicuous features of misgovernment in America as if they were\r\ntypical, and consequently the very thing to be expected in foreign\r\nservice; secondly, they indicate a pessimistic distrust of men—a\r\ndistrust masquerading as prudence and conservatism—which is neither\r\njustified by the sum of the facts nor is it healthful for those who urge\r\nthem; thirdly, they assume the equal right of all men to govern\r\nthemselves regardless of capacity.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed, moreover, that, as a rule, officers who receive\r\ntheir positions by appointment are held more strictly to account than\r\nare those who are elected by ballot; for the latter are not as apt to be\r\nremoved for inefficiency or corruption as the former. Besides they have\r\nthe machine back of them instead of the people or the President. Hence,\r\nsince officers for the foreign administrative service would necessarily\r\nbe chosen by the administration, as are those in the consular and\r\ndiplomatic service, it is not too much to expect even a better\r\ngovernment for the dependencies than for ourselves—however strange it\r\nmay seem to say so.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed again that good government is more likely to be the\r\nrule than the exception in our dependencies for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst, oppression, or misgovernment of any kind, does not pay. As has\r\noften been pointed out, this is the one great lesson that England\r\nlearned in the Revolutionary War, and she has made good use of it ever\r\nsince. The primary object, first, last and always, must be the welfare\r\nof the dependency; otherwise it is all a hypocritical delusion,\r\ncontaining nothing so good as the seeds of its own destruction. Second,\r\nAmerican pride in what Americans can do will not accept any but the best\r\nresults, especially when nearly all the world is looking on\r\ndistrustfully.\r\n\r\nThird, the one race which by common consent has best solved the problem\r\nof self-government is the Anglo-Saxon, and the Philippines are to be\r\ncongratulated upon being under its instruction.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that there are reasons for believing that instead\r\nof having a harmful influence upon the American commonwealth the\r\ninfluence of expansion will be healthful. Corruption in politics is\r\ngenerally a direct result of the indifference of the citizen, an\r\nindifference arising from an unwarranted sense of security. The citizen\r\nmust learn to feel that he has now an added responsibility, a deeper\r\nobligation to humanity to make his own government as pure as possible;\r\nfor the idea of expansion involves an assumption of superiority upon our\r\npart—an assumption that we must make good in every particular. Lynch law\r\nand municipal corruption must cease altogether; for we have given\r\nourselves to the world as an example not only of good government, but of\r\ngood self-government, and we cannot afford that even occasional\r\nexceptions shall be tolerated. We should have more politicians, not\r\nfewer—so that scoundrels could find no room in the business.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “Splendid Isolation”\r\n\r\n  See page 179\r\n]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMoreover, our newly assumed responsibilities will have the effect of\r\ndeveloping and training in leadership. It is a most significant lesson\r\nto Americans that this practical training of leaders and rulers of men\r\nhas enabled England, according to some writers, to make such great\r\nadvancement in municipal government.\r\n\r\nSome notice is due to the objection that these outlying possessions\r\nrender us more vulnerable in case of war; that because of their wide\r\nseparation and the enormous increase of coast line the task of defense\r\nwill be greatly augmented. This is evidently true; and it is no less\r\ntrue and no less evident that in the same ratio will our means of\r\ndefense be augmented; for the fighting of the future will be naval more\r\nand more as the years go by; and naval warfare demands, first, a navy,\r\nand, second, bases of operation.\r\n\r\nBut a navy is expensive both to create and to maintain, and our new\r\npolicy will demand a largely increased navy and an enormous outlay of\r\nmoney. Yes, but this has long been needed by our foreign commerce, and\r\nthe lack of it for this purpose has been disastrous. A nation whose\r\nmerchants pay out half a million dollars every day for transportation in\r\nforeign vessels (I quote the words of the chief engineer of the navy),\r\ncertainly ought to do all in its power to encourage its own merchant\r\nmarine, at least by furnishing adequate protection. Think of it! a half\r\na million saved every day would build a $3,000,000 battleship in one\r\nweek. Why, we paid out enough in pensions in one year to build\r\ntwenty-five such vessels. This ought to suggest to every one that “an\r\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”. Hence, though a navy is\r\nexpensive, it is still more so to do without one.\r\n\r\nBut, you say, we are incurring a vast expense in subduing and\r\ncontrolling the country, and apparently there is no income to balance\r\nit. Add to all this the $20,000,000 conceded by the Treaty of Paris, and\r\ndon’t you think it a rather poor investment?\r\n\r\nHere again let us seek our answer from the experience of England in\r\nEgypt and in India. In both of these countries her outlay of money\r\noriginally was enormous, and from neither of them does she now receive a\r\npenny of revenue. She taxes them to be sure, but the taxes are spent for\r\nthe local administration—none for England. It is from trade with these\r\ncountries—the greater because of her greater prestige—trade which is of\r\nmutual benefit, that England derives any revenue whatsoever, but that is\r\nenormous. Yet she does not forbid other nations to trade with them nor\r\nplace any obstacle in their way. She has had simply the advantage of\r\ngreater prestige and commercial ability.\r\n\r\nFinally one other objection must be noticed and that is the\r\nconstitutional objection. As to the merits of this question, let\r\nconstitutional lawyers decide; but if the country has been expanding\r\never since it began, and all the arguments of statesmen, big and little,\r\nhave not prevented it from expanding, it would seem to be not so much a\r\nconstitutional question as it is one of national policy and\r\ninternational law. At any rate the constitution was made for America and\r\nnot America for the constitution; and while it is one of the ablest of\r\ndocuments, nobody considers it faultless or supposes it ever could be.\r\nJames Bryce in a burst of enthusiasm says of us: “Such a people could\r\nwork any constitution”.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak in so short a time of all the points involved\r\nin expansion, or even of the one case we have been considering, the\r\ndetails of which we can well afford to omit, if it is justified by\r\npolitical, international, commercial and especially ethical\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nWe will now listen to questions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as the opportunity was given there were several ready to take\r\nadvantage of it, and the questions came fast and furious—almost.\r\n\r\n“Professor”, said one, “it seems to me that I see several\r\ninconsistencies in your position. You will not mind my saying so?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. Proceed.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, you say that a government is a ‘growth’, and yet\r\nyou would impose the authority of our government upon the Philippines.\r\nWhy not give their government a chance to grow?”\r\n\r\n“Very good; but suppose instead of resulting in a growth the Philippine\r\nattempt proves abortive, as we have every reason to suppose that it\r\nwould? You seem to assume that growth must result necessarily; but an\r\negg is more likely to spoil than to hatch when left without protection,\r\nand so it has proved with republics. The trouble with you theorizers is\r\nthat you begin at the wrong end in building up your Philippine republic.\r\nYou begin at the top, the general government, the president and\r\nlegislature, instead of beginning at the bottom, the precinct or\r\ntownship. To be sure the need of a general government is imperative and\r\nimmediate, but things never grow in that way. Now, what do we propose to\r\ndo in the Philippines? We propose to substitute our own power for the\r\ngeneral government while the real government is growing up among the\r\npeople. In all self-government life begins at the extremities, not at\r\nthe center.”\r\n\r\n“And do you propose to withdraw as soon as it has attained full growth?”\r\n\r\n“We propose to let that question alone until full growth has been\r\nattained. It is quite unlikely that the American people will ever care\r\nto impose their government upon an unwilling people who are abundantly\r\nable to take care of themselves. It is much more likely when that time\r\nshall come, that as a Filipino has expressed it, ‘the Filipinos will be\r\nbetter Americans than the Americans themselves’, just like the English\r\ncolonists in their loyalty to the mother country”.\r\n\r\n“That is all very well; but I still discover some assumptions in your\r\nanswers. In the first place you assume that the Filipinos are incapable\r\nof organizing a government for themselves, and in the second place you\r\nassume that we Americans will be entirely disinterested in maintaining\r\nour authority over them. If you can satisfy me upon these points I will\r\naccept all you have said.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I can’t prove everything, and must therefore make some\r\nassumptions”, said the Professor, “but as to the first I shall simply\r\nrefer you to the testimony of those who know them best, which to me is\r\nconclusive upon this point. But the point itself is secondary to our\r\ninternational obligation to re-establish law and order. As to the second\r\nassumption, again I have little to say, though there is much to be said.\r\nI am happy to believe not only in the general efficiency of our\r\ngovernment, particularly the general or Federal government, but also in\r\nits integrity of character and the honesty of its administration.”\r\n\r\n“Professor”, said another man, “I suppose I am what you would call a\r\nfanatic; for I am foolish enough to prefer my own government simply\r\nbecause it is mine and not because it is the best.”\r\n\r\n“You may be uninformed rather than fanatical, my friend. Did you ever\r\nlive any length of time in Central or South America?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose you go down to Nicaragua, or Venezuela, or Colombia, or\r\nHayti for four or five years; then when you come back—that is if you\r\ncome back alive—count up the annual and semi-annual revolutions you have\r\nseen, and then tell us what you think about it. Don’t you see that you\r\nare getting the sentiment of patriotism and the science of government\r\nsomewhat mixed. You may love your country all you will and independently\r\nof its government, but the only justification for the latter should be\r\nits efficiency—efficiency in securing life, liberty and justice to all.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to ask a question”, said another man.\r\n\r\n“Very well.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know how you would prove that the Anglo-Saxon is the\r\none race which by common consent has best solved the problem of\r\nself-government.”\r\n\r\n“Let me refer you for your answer to ‘Anglo-Saxon Superiority’ by Edward\r\nDemolin, a gifted French writer; also for the influence of the British\r\nand the American constitutions let me refer you to the history of almost\r\nany legislative body in the world. I think this last reference in itself\r\nis sufficient.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me, Professor, that your frequent references to England,\r\nespecially at this time, are rather unfortunate, if you will allow me\r\nthe liberty to say so; for a country with so shady a reputation as hers,\r\ncannot be held up for admiration. Will not your advocacy of expansion\r\nsuffer from such an unsavory comparison?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps”, said the Professor, “I may be pardoned for departing so far\r\nfrom the subject of the evening as to reply to your criticism, since it\r\nleads up to the answer to your question.\r\n\r\n“Has England a ‘shady reputation’? Certainly, among those who are\r\njealous of her, and everybody outside of Anglo-Saxon sovereignty has\r\ngood reason to be jealous of her. But is there no better foundation for\r\nthis reputation than mere jealousy? Certainly; in her dealings with\r\nIreland, in the early days in India, and in her treatment of the\r\nAmerican colonists her policy was sometimes uninformed, sometimes unwise\r\nand even cruel and oppressive, and her historians offer no defense for\r\nit. Has she displayed unusual cruelty in her conquests? By no means; she\r\nhas displayed such unusual activity in colonization—in doing police duty\r\nfor the world, in substituting intelligent force for misdirected force,\r\nthat as a natural result she is disliked by a great many people. It is\r\nnot to be supposed that her purposes in colonization have always been\r\nunselfish—perhaps they never have been so; but her purposes and methods\r\nin administration are unselfish, and thus she has taught the world the\r\nsecret that Rome failed to find—how to knit together a great colonial\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n“You speak of the present unfortunate Transvaal war. So far as this\r\nbears upon your question I have only this to say; my sympathies are with\r\nthe English, because, disregarding the merits of the original\r\ncontroversy, about which none of us who read both sides dare be\r\npositive, the English are our own kindred; and because we could never\r\nforgive ourselves if we were to forget the noble, generous and fraternal\r\npart that England played in 1898, the consequences of which she is now\r\nsuffering in the hostility to the Anglo-Saxon. I do not dismiss the\r\noriginal controversy because it is unimportant—for the question of right\r\nor wrong far outweighs all other considerations—but in the conflict of\r\nopinions and the appeals to passion the American, it seems to me, should\r\ndismiss all; and if he feels that he must take sides, he will find that\r\nthe considerations of race, national interest and national gratitude, as\r\nwell as the greater probability of just government, are all on the side\r\nof the British arms.\r\n\r\n“And now as to the point of your question: England can scarcely be held\r\nup to us as a ‘horrible example’ of what is likely to happen to a nation\r\nwhich allows itself to expand, because at the very worst the example\r\nisn’t sufficiently horrible. But more than that, our acquisitions have\r\nall come to us peacefully and gladly, except one fifth of the Filipinos,\r\nand our whole course has been singularly devoid of mistakes, and I can\r\nimagine that in the future this period, safely passed, will be regarded\r\nas one of the most brilliant and successful in our history.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE

synopsis it means\r\nthat there is a proviso in our treaty with that country touching more or\r\nless definitely upon the subject indicated. The sign (†) means that the\r\nsubject is covered by the proviso or nearly so; a (‡) means that it is\r\nmodified in some measure; a (§) means that it applies only to American\r\ncitizens in the consular service, not to foreigners, and a (¶) means\r\nthat the requisitions for the extradition of criminals may be made\r\n“through the superior consular officer; otherwise through the diplomatic\r\nservice.” A blank space means that the point is not touched upon by any\r\ntreaty now in force.\r\n\r\nThis synopsis of our commercial treaties shows at a glance their\r\nrelative fullness or deficiency, and the most remarkable thing about it\r\nis their deficiency. Sometimes, it is true, by virtue of international\r\ncomity, much larger discretion is exercised by consuls and diplomats\r\nthan is vouchsafed by the terms of the treaty; but it is not to be\r\ninferred that this is always the case.\r\n\r\nTreaties are sometimes intended to last forever (_in perpetuo_), and\r\nsometimes they are concluded for only a term of years. Political\r\ntreaties, the purposes of which is usually to terminate wars, establish\r\nboundaries, award indemnities, etc., naturally belong, as a rule, to the\r\nfirst class, while commercial treaties usually have a time limit. This\r\naccounts for a good many of the blank spaces in the above synopsis.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that there are some countries in the above list which\r\nhave not at present the treaty making power—such, for instance, as\r\nEgypt, the Hanseatic Republic, Prussia, Hawaii, Samoa, Madagascar,\r\nBorneo, Kongo Free State, etc. In such cases the government which\r\nassumes the sovereignty assumes the treaty obligations, or else\r\nconcludes new ones.\r\n\r\nIt may be noticed, on the other hand, that there are no commercial\r\ntreaties with either Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay or Chile. This does not\r\nmean that there are no political treaties with those countries, or that\r\nthere never have been any commercial treaties, but merely that in some\r\ncases the latter have been allowed to lapse or have been abrogated, and\r\nno new ones have been concluded. Canada, Australia, India, and all other\r\ncolonies have no sovereignty, and therefore are not states in\r\ninternational law. Hence they cannot appoint or receive ambassadors nor\r\ncan they make treaties except through the sovereign power.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DIPLOMATIC SERVICE\r\n\r\n     To What Country                   Name and Rank.\r\n       Accredited.\r\n\r\n   Argentine Republic   William P.
