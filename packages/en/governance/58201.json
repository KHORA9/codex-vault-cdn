Alice had no time to wonder how it managed to do it, she was\r\nbusy taking in the appearance of the creature, which was something like\r\na badly-written note of interrogation and something like a guillemot,\r\nand seemed to have been trying to preen its rather untidy plumage with\r\nwhitewash. “What a dreadful mess it’s in!” she remarked, after gazing at\r\nit for a few moments in silence. “What is it, and why is it here?”\r\n\r\n“It hasn’t any meaning,” said the Cat, “it simply _is_.”\r\n\r\n“Can it talk?” asked Alice eagerly.\r\n\r\n“It has never done anything else,” chuckled the Cat.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me what you are doing here?” Alice inquired politely. The\r\nIneptitude shook its head with a deprecatory motion and commenced to\r\ndrawl, “I haven’t an idea.”\r\n\r\n“It never has, you know,” interrupted the Cheshire Cat rudely, “but in\r\nits leisure moments” (Alice thought it must have a good many of them)\r\n“when it isn’t playing with a gutta-percha ball it unravels the\r\ngroundwork of what people believe--or don’t believe, I forget which.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\nwith apologies to Sir John Tenniel]\r\n\r\n“It really doesn’t matter which,” said the Ineptitude, with languid\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Of course it doesn’t,” the Cat went on cheerfully, “because the\r\nunravelling got so tangled that no one could follow it. Its theory is,”\r\nhe continued, seeing that Alice was waiting for more, “that you mustn’t\r\ninterfere with the Inevitable. Slide and let slide, you know.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you keep it here for?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, somehow you can’t help it; it’s so perfectly harmless and amiable\r\nand says the nastiest things in the nicest manner, and the King just\r\ncouldn’t do without it. The King is only made of pasteboard, you know,\r\nwith sharp edges; and the Queen”--here the Cat sank its voice to a\r\nwhisper--“the Queen comes from another pack, made of Brummagem ware,\r\nwithout polish, but absolutely indestructible; always pushing, you know;\r\nbut you can’t push an Ineptitude. Might as well try to hustle a\r\nglacier.”\r\n\r\n“That’s why you keep so many of them about,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Of course. But its temper is not what it used to be. Lots of things\r\nhave happened to worry it.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of things?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, people have been dying off in round numbers, in the most\r\nostentatious manner, and the Ineptitude dislikes fuss--but hush, here’s\r\nthe King coming.”\r\n\r\nHis Majesty was looking doleful and grumpy, Alice thought, as though he\r\nhad been disturbed in an afternoon nap. “Who is this, and what is that\r\nCat doing here?” he asked, glancing gloomily at Alice and her companion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KING WAS FAST ASLEEP.]\r\n\r\n“I really must ask you to give me notice of these questions,” said the\r\nIneptitude, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n“There’s a dragon loose somewhere in the garden,” the King went on\r\npeevishly, “and I am expected to help in getting it under control. Do I\r\nlook as if I could control dragons?”\r\n\r\nAlice thought he certainly did not.\r\n\r\n“What do you propose doing?” drawled the Ineptitude.\r\n\r\n“That’s just it,” said the King. “I say that whatever is done must be\r\ndone cautiously and deliberately; the Treasurer says that whatever is\r\ndone must be done cheaply--I am afraid the Treasurer is the weakest\r\nmember of the pack,” he added anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Only made of Bristol board, you know,” explained the Cat aside to\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n“What does the Queen say about it?” asked the Ineptitude.\r\n\r\n“The Queen says that if something is not done in less than no time\r\nthere’ll be a Dissolution.”\r\n\r\nBoth looked very grave at this, and nothing was said for some minutes.\r\nThe King was the first to break the silence. “What are you doing with\r\nthat whitewash?” he demanded. “The Queen said everything was to be\r\npainted khaki.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said the creature pathetically, “but I had run out of khaki;\r\nthe Unforeseen again, you know; and things needed whitewash so badly.”\r\n\r\nThe Cat had been slowly vanishing during the last few minutes, till\r\nnothing remained of it but an eye. At the last remark it gave a wink at\r\nAlice and completed its eclipse.\r\n\r\nWhen Alice turned round she found that both the King and the Ineptitude\r\nwere fast asleep.\r\n\r\n“It’s no good remaining here,” she thought, and as she did not want to\r\nmeet either the Queen or the dragon, she turned to make her way out of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” she said to herself, “I know what an Ineptitude is\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE IN PALL MALL_\r\n\r\n\r\n“The great art in falling off a horse,” said the White Knight, “is to\r\nhave another handy to fall on to.”\r\n\r\n“But wouldn’t that be rather difficult to arrange?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“Difficult, of course,” replied the Knight, “but in my Department one\r\nhas to be provided for emergencies. Now, for instance, have you ever\r\nconducted a war in South Africa?”\r\n\r\nAlice shook her head.\r\n\r\n“I have,” said the Knight, with a gentle complacency in his voice.\r\n\r\n“And did you bring it to a successful conclusion?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly to a _conclusion_--not a _definite_ conclusion, you\r\nknow--nor entirely successful either. In fact, I believe it’s going on\r\nstill.... But you can’t think how much forethought it took to get it\r\nproperly started. I dare say, now, you are wondering at my equipment?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALICE AND THE WHITE KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n(_With apologies to Sir John Tenniel._)]\r\n\r\nAlice certainly was; the Knight was riding rather uncomfortably on a\r\nsober-paced horse that was prevented from moving any faster by an\r\nelaborate housing of red-tape trappings. “Of course, I see the reason\r\nfor that,” thought Alice; “if it were to move any quicker the Knight\r\nwould come off.” But there were a number of obsolete weapons and\r\nappliances hanging about the saddle that didn’t seem of the least\r\npractical use.\r\n\r\n“You see, I had read a book,” the Knight went on in a dreamy, far-away\r\ntone, “written by some one to prove that warfare under modern conditions\r\nwas impossible. You may imagine how disturbing that was to a man of my\r\nprofession. Many men would have thrown up the whole thing and gone home.\r\nBut I grappled with the situation. You will never guess what I did.”\r\n\r\nAlice pondered. “You went to war, of course----”\r\n\r\n“Yes; _but not under modern conditions_.”\r\n\r\nThe Knight stopped his horse so that he might enjoy the full effect of\r\nthis announcement.\r\n\r\n“Now, for instance,” he continued kindly, seeing that Alice had not\r\nrecovered her breath, “you observe this little short-range gun that I\r\nhave hanging to my saddle? Why do you suppose I sent out guns of that\r\nparticular kind? Because if they happened to fall into the hands of the\r\nenemy they’d be very little use to him. That was my own invention.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Alice gravely; “but supposing you wanted to use them\r\nagainst the enemy?”\r\n\r\nThe Knight looked worried. “I know there is that to be thought of, but\r\nI didn’t choose to be putting dangerous weapons into the enemy’s hands.\r\nAnd then, again, supposing the Basutos had risen, those would have been\r\njust the sort of guns to drive them off with. Of course they _didn’t_\r\nrise; but they might have done so, you know.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the horse suddenly went on again, and the Knight clutched\r\nconvulsively at its mane to prevent himself from coming off.\r\n\r\n“That’s the worst of horses,” he remarked apologetically; “they are so\r\nUnforeseen in their movements. Now, if I had had my way I would have\r\ndone without them as far as possible--in fact, I began that way, only it\r\ndidn’t answer. And yet,” he went on in an aggrieved tone, “at Cressy it\r\nwas the footmen who did the most damage.”\r\n\r\n“But,” objected Alice, “if your men hadn’t got horses how could they get\r\nabout from place to place?”\r\n\r\n“They couldn’t. That would be the beauty of it,” said the White Knight\r\neagerly; “the fewer places your army moves to, the fewer maps you have\r\nto prepare. And we hadn’t prepared very many. I’m not very strong at\r\ngeography, but,” he added, brightening, “you should hear me talk\r\nFrench.”\r\n\r\n“But,” persisted Alice, “supposing the enemy went and attacked you at\r\nsome other place----”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANOTHER HANDY TO FALL ON TO.]\r\n\r\n“They did,” interrupted the Knight gloomily; “they appeared in strength\r\nat places that weren’t even marked on the ordinary maps. But how do you\r\nthink they got there?”\r\n\r\nHe paused and fixed his gentle eyes upon Alice as she walked beside him,\r\nand then continued in a hollow voice--\r\n\r\n“They rode. Rode and carried rifles. They were no mortal foes--they were\r\nMounted Infantry.”\r\n\r\nThe Knight swayed about so with the violence of his emotion that it was\r\ninevitable that he should lose his seat, and Alice was relieved to\r\nnotice that there was another horse with an empty saddle ready for him\r\nto scramble on to. There was a frightful dust, of course, but Alice saw\r\nhim gathering the reins of his new mount into a bunch, and smiling down\r\nupon her with increased amiability.\r\n\r\n“It’s not an easy animal to manage,” he called out to her, “but if I pat\r\nit and speak to it in French it will probably understand where I want it\r\nto go. And,” he added hopefully, “it may go there. A knowledge of French\r\nand an amiable disposition will see one out of most things.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” thought Alice as she watched him settling down uneasily into the\r\nsaddle, “it ought not to take long to see him out of that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE AT LAMBETH_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was so much noise inside that Alice thought she might as well go\r\nin without knocking.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was as noticeable as the noise when Alice got in, and\r\nseemed to be heavily charged with pepper. There was a faint whiff of\r\nburning incense, and some candles that had just been put out were\r\nsmouldering unpleasantly. Quite a number of Articles were strewn about\r\non the floor, some of them more or less broken. The Duchess was seated\r\nin the middle of the kitchen, holding, as well as she could, a very\r\nunmanageable baby that kept wriggling itself into all manner of postures\r\nand uncompromising attitudes. At the back of the kitchen a cook was\r\nbusily engaged in stirring up a large cauldron, pausing every now and\r\nthen to fling a reredos or half a rubric at the Duchess, who maintained\r\nan air of placid unconcern in spite of the combined fractiousness of the\r\nbaby and cook and the obtrusiveness of the pepper.\r\n\r\n“Your cook seems to have a very violent temper,” said Alice, as soon as\r\na lull in the discord enabled her to make herself heard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUCHESS, THE BABY, AND THE COOK.\r\n\r\n(_With apologies to Sir John Tenniel._)]\r\n\r\n“Drat her!” said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice, not quite sure whether she had heard\r\naright; “your Grace was remarking----”\r\n\r\n“_Pax vobiscum_, was what I said,” answered the Duchess; “there’s\r\nnothing like a dead language when you’re dealing with a live volcano.”\r\n\r\n“But aren’t you going to do something to set matters straight a bit?”\r\nasked Alice, dodging a whole set of Ornaments that went skimming through\r\nthe air, and watching with some anxiety the contortions of the baby,\r\nwhich was getting more difficult to hold every moment.\r\n\r\n“Of course something must be done,” said the Duchess, with decision,\r\n“but quietly and gradually--the leaden foot within the velvet shoe, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nAlice seemed to recognise the quotation, but she did not notice that\r\nanything particular was being done. “At the rate you’re going, it will\r\nbe years before you get settled,” she remarked.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it will,” said the Duchess resignedly. “I’m paid by the year,\r\nyou know. _Festina lente_, say I.”\r\n\r\n“But surely you can keep some sort of order in your Establishment?” said\r\nAlice. “Why don’t you exert your authority?”\r\n\r\n“My dear, it takes me all the exertion I can spare to have any\r\nauthority. I give orders, and it’s my endeavour not to see that they’re\r\ndisobeyed. I’m sure I’ve given this child my Opinion--but there, you\r\nmight as well opine to a limpet. As to the cook----”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I ALWAYS SAID IT WOULD,” SAID THE CAT.]\r\n\r\nHere the cook sent the pepper-pot straight at the Duchess, who broke off\r\nin a violent fit of sneezing. In the midst of the commotion the baby\r\nsuddenly disappeared, and as the cook had taken up a new caster labelled\r\n“cayenne” Alice thought she might as well go and see where it had gone\r\nto. As she slipped out of the kitchen she heard the Duchess gasping\r\nbetween her sneezes, “Must ... be done ... quietly ... and ...\r\ngradually.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“What happened to the baby?” asked the Cheshire Cat, appearing suddenly\r\na few minutes later.\r\n\r\n“It went out--to roam, I think,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“I always said it would,” said the Cat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE AND THE LIBERAL PARTY_\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite a number of them were going past, and the noise was considerable,\r\nbut they were marching in sixes and sevens and didn’t seem to be guided\r\nby any fixed word of command, so that the effect was not so imposing as\r\nit might have been. Some of them, Alice noticed, had the letters “I.L.”\r\nembroidered on their tunics and headpieces and other conspicuous places\r\n(“I wonder,” she thought, “if it’s marked on their underclothing as\r\nwell”); others simply had a big “L,” and others again were branded with\r\na little “e.” They got dreadfully in each other’s way, and were always\r\nfalling over one another in little heaps, while many of the mounted ones\r\ndid not seem at all sure of their seats. “They won’t go very far if they\r\ndon’t fall into better order,” thought Alice, and she was glad to find\r\nherself the next minute in a spacious hall with a large marble staircase\r\nat one end of it. The White King was sitting on one of the steps,\r\nlooking rather anxious and just a little uncomfortable under his heavy\r\ncrown, which needed a good deal of balancing to keep it in its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMROSE MESSENGER.\r\n“_Out of reach._”\r\n\r\nTHE UNKHAKI MESSENGER.\r\n“_Out of touch._”]\r\n\r\n“Did you happen to meet any fighting men?” he asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“A great many--two or three hundred, I should think.”\r\n\r\n“Not quite two hundred, all told,” said the King, referring to his\r\nnote-book.\r\n\r\n“Told what?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“Well, they haven’t been told anything, exactly--yet. The fact is,” the\r\nKing went on nervously, “we’re rather in want of a messenger just now. I\r\ndon’t know how it is, there are two or three of them about, but lately\r\nthey have always been either out of reach or else out of touch. You\r\ndon’t happen to have passed any one coming from the direction of\r\nBerkeley Square?” he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nAlice shook her head.\r\n\r\n“There’s the Primrose Courier, for instance,” the King continued\r\nreflectively, “the most reliable Messenger we have; he understands all\r\nabout Open Doors and Linked Hands and all that sort of thing, and he’s\r\nquite as useful at home. But he frightens some of them nearly out of\r\ntheir wits by his Imperial Anglo-Saxon attitudes. I wouldn’t mind his\r\nskipping about so if he’d only come back when he’s wanted.”\r\n\r\n“And haven’t you got any one else to carry your messages?” asked Alice\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\n“There’s the Unkhaki Messenger,” said the King, consulting his\r\npocket-book.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“You know what Khaki means?” I suppose.\r\n\r\n“It’s a sort of colour,” said Alice promptly; “something like dust.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said the King; “thou dost--he doesn’t. That’s why he’s called\r\nthe Unkhaki Messenger.”\r\n\r\nAlice gave it up.\r\n\r\n“Such a dear, obliging creature,” the King went on, “but so dreadfully\r\nunpunctual. He’s always half a century in front of his times or half a\r\ncentury behind them, and that puts one out so.”\r\n\r\nAlice agreed that it would make a difference.\r\n\r\n“It’s helped to put us out quite six years already,” the King went on\r\nplaintively; “but you can’t cure him of it. You see he will wander about\r\nin byways and deserts, hunting for Lost Causes, and whenever he comes\r\nacross a stream he always wades against the current. All that takes him\r\nout of his way, you know; he’s somewhere up in the Grampian Hills by\r\nthis time.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Alice; “that’s what you mean by being out of touch. And\r\nthe other Messenger is--”\r\n\r\n“Out of reach,” said the King. “Precisely.”\r\n\r\n“Then it follows----” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean by ‘it,’” interrupted the King sulkily. “No\r\none follows. That is why we stick in the same place. DON’T!” he\r\nsuddenly screamed, jumping up and down in his agitation. “Don’t do it, I\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“Do what?” asked Alice, in some alarm.\r\n\r\n“Give advice. I know you’re going to. They’ve all been doing it for the\r\nlast six weeks. I assure you the letters I get----”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t going to give you advice,” said Alice indignantly, “and as to\r\nletters, you’ve got too much alphabet as it is.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you’re doing it now,” said the King angrily. “Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nAs Alice took the hint and walked away towards the door she heard him\r\ncalling after her in a kinder tone: “If you _should_ meet any one coming\r\nfrom the direction of Berkeley Square----”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE ANYWHERE BUT IN DOWNING STREET_\r\n\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what business you have here,” the Red Queen was saying,\r\n“if you don’t belong to the Cabinet; of course,” she added more kindly,\r\n“you may be one of the outer ring. There are so many of them, and\r\nthey’re mostly so unimportant that one can’t be expected to remember\r\n_all_ their faces.”\r\n\r\n“What is _your_ business?” asked Alice, by way of evading the question.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any business really,” said the White Queen. “Her Red\r\nMajesty sometimes says more than she means. Fancy,” she added eagerly,\r\n“I went round in 85 yesterday!”\r\n\r\n“Round what?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“The Links, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Talking about a Lynx,” said the Red Queen, “are you any good at Natural\r\nHistory? Take prestige from a Lion, what would remain?”\r\n\r\n“The prestige wouldn’t, of course,” said Alice, “and the Lion might not\r\ncare to be without it. I suppose nothing----”\r\n\r\n“_I_ should remain, whatever happened,” said the Red Queen, with\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_With apologies to Sir John Tenniel._)]\r\n\r\n“She’s no good at Natural History,” observed the White Queen. “Shall I\r\ntry her with Christian Science? If there was a sort of warfare going on\r\nin a kind of a country, and you wanted to stop it, and didn’t know how\r\nto, what course of inaction would you pursue?”\r\n\r\n“Action you mean. Her White Majesty occasionally muddles things,”\r\ninterposed the Red Queen.\r\n\r\n“It amounts to much the same thing with us,” said the White Queen.\r\n\r\nAlice pondered. “I suppose I should resign,” she hazarded.\r\n\r\nBoth Queens gasped and held up their hands in reprobation.\r\n\r\n“A most improper suggestion,” said the White Queen severely. “Now I\r\nshould simply convince my reasoning faculty that the war didn’t\r\nexist--and there’d be an end of it.”\r\n\r\n“But,” objected Alice, “supposing the war was to assume that your\r\nreasoning faculty was wanting, and went on all the same?”\r\n\r\n“The child is talking nonsense,” said the Red Queen; “she doesn’t know\r\nanything of Christian Science. Let’s try Political Economy. Supposing\r\nyou were pledged to introduce a scheme for Old-Age Pensions, what would\r\nbe your next step?”\r\n\r\nAlice considered. “I should think----”\r\n\r\n“Of course you’d think,” said the White Queen, “ever so much. You’d go\r\non thinking off and on for years. I can’t tell you how much I’ve thought\r\nabout it myself; I still think about it a little, just for\r\npractice--principally on Tuesdays.”\r\n\r\n“I should think,” continued Alice, without noticing the interruption,\r\n“that the first thing would be to find the money.”\r\n\r\n“Dear, no,” said the Red Queen pityingly, “_that_ wouldn’t be Political\r\nEconomy. The first thing would be to find an excuse for dropping the\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_With apologies to Sir John Tenniel._)]\r\n\r\n“What a dreadful lot of unnecessary business we’re talking!” said the\r\nWhite Queen fretfully. “It makes me quite miserable--carries me back to\r\nthe days when I was in Opposition. Can’t she sing us something?”\r\n\r\n“What shall I sing you?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, anything soothing; the ‘Intercessional,’ if you like.”\r\n\r\nAlice began, but the words didn’t come a bit right, and she wasn’t at\r\nall sure how the Queens would take it:\r\n\r\n    “Voice of the People, lately polled,\r\n      Awed by our broad-cast battle scheme,\r\n    By virtue of whose vote we hold\r\n      Our licence still to doze and dream,\r\n    Still, falt’ring Voice, complaisant shout,\r\n    Lest we go out, lest we go out.”\r\n\r\nAlice looked anxiously at the Queens when she had finished, but they\r\nwere both fast asleep.\r\n\r\n“It will take a deal of shouting to rouse them,” she thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE IN DIFFICULTIES_\r\n\r\n\r\n“How are you getting on?” asked the Cheshire Cat.\r\n\r\n“I’m not,” said Alice.\r\n\r\nWhich was certainly the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was the most provoking and bewildering game of croquet she had ever\r\nplayed in. The other side did not seem to know what they were expected\r\nto do, and, for the most part, they weren’t doing anything, so Alice\r\nthought she might have a good chance of winning--though she was ever so\r\nmany hoops behind. But the ground she had to play over was all lumps and\r\nfurrows, and some of the hoops were three-cornered in shape, which made\r\nthem difficult to get through, while as for the balls (which were live\r\nhedgehogs and very opinionated), it was all she could do to keep them in\r\nposition for a minute at a time. Then the flamingo which she was using\r\nas a mallet kept stiffening itself into uncompromising attitudes, and\r\nhad to be coaxed back into a good temper.\r\n\r\n“I think I can manage _him_ now,” she said, “since I let him have a\r\nlatchkey and allowed him to take up the position he wanted he has been\r\nquite amiable. The other flamingo I was playing with,” she added\r\nregretfully, “strayed off into a furrow. The last I saw of it, it was\r\ntrying to bore a tunnel.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON?” ASKED THE CHESHIRE CAT.]\r\n\r\n“A tunnel?” said the Cat.\r\n\r\n“Yes; under the sea, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I see; to avoid the cross-current, of course.”\r\n\r\nAlice waited till the Cat had stopped grinning at its own joke, and then\r\nwent on--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OTHER FLAMINGO.]\r\n\r\n“As for the hedgehogs, there’s no doing anything with them; they’ve got\r\nsuch prickly tempers. And they’re _so_ short-sighted; if they don’t\r\nhappen to be looking the same way they invariably run against each\r\nother. I should have won that last hoop if both hedgehogs hadn’t tried\r\nto get through at the same time.”\r\n\r\n“Both?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the one I was playing with and the one I wasn’t. And every one\r\nbegan shouting out all sorts of different directions till I scarcely\r\nknew which I was playing with. Really,” she continued plaintively, “it’s\r\nthe most discouraging croquet-party I was ever at; if we go on like this\r\nthere soon won’t be any party at all.”\r\n\r\n“It’s no use swearing and humping your back,” said the Cat\r\nsympathetically. (Alice hadn’t done either.) “Keep your temper and your\r\nflamingo.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the Cat; “keep on playing _with the right ball_.”\r\n\r\n“Which _is_ the right ball?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\nBut the Cat had discreetly vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE AT ST. STEPHEN’S_\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s very provoking,” said Alice to herself; she had been trying for\r\nthe previous quarter of an hour to attract the attention of a large and\r\nvery solemn caterpillar that was perched on the top of a big mushroom\r\nwith a Gothic fringe. “I’ve heard that the only chance of speaking to it\r\nis to catch its eye,” she continued, but she found out that however\r\nperseveringly she thrust herself into the Caterpillar’s range of vision\r\nits eye persistently looked beyond her, or beneath her, or around\r\nher--never at her. Alice had read somewhere that little girls should be\r\nseen and not heard; “but,” she thought, “I’m not even seen here, and if\r\nI’m not to be heard, what am I here at all for?” In any case she\r\ndetermined to make an attempt at conversation.\r\n\r\n“If you please----” she began.\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” said the Caterpillar shortly, without seeming to take any\r\nfurther notice of her.\r\n\r\nAfter an uncomfortable pause she commenced again.\r\n\r\n“I should like----”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t,” said the Caterpillar, with decision.\r\n\r\nAlice felt discouraged, but it was no use to be shut up in this way, so\r\nshe started again as amiably as she could.\r\n\r\n“You can’t think, Mr. Caterpillar----”\r\n\r\n“I can, and I often do,” he remarked stiffly; adding, “You mustn’t make\r\nsuch wild statements. They’re not relevant to the discussion.”\r\n\r\n“But I only said that in order----”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t,” said the Caterpillar angrily. “I tell you it was not in\r\norder.”\r\n\r\n“You are so dreadfully short,” exclaimed Alice; the Caterpillar drew\r\nitself up.\r\n\r\n“In manner, I mean; no--in memory,” she added hastily, for it was\r\nthoroughly angry by this time.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I didn’t mean anything,” she continued humbly, for she felt\r\nthat it was absurd to quarrel with a caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThe Caterpillar snorted.\r\n\r\n“What’s the good of talking if you don’t mean anything? If you’ve talked\r\nall this time without meaning anything you’re not worth listening to.”\r\n\r\n“But you put a wrong construction----” Alice began.\r\n\r\n“You can’t discuss Construction now, you know; that comes on the\r\nEstimates. Shrivel!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Shrivel. Dry up,” explained the Caterpillar, and proceeded to look in\r\nanother direction, as if it had forgotten her existence.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Alice, after waiting a moment; she half hoped that the\r\nCaterpillar might say, “See you later,” but it took not the slightest\r\nnotice of her remark, so she got up reluctantly and walked away.\r\n\r\n“Well, of all the gubernatorial----” said Alice to herself when she got\r\noutside. She did not quite know what it meant, but it was an immense\r\nrelief to be able to come out with a word of six syllables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE LUNCHES AT WESTMINSTER_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_With apologies to Everybody._)]\r\n\r\n“I think I would rather not hear it just now,” said Alice politely.\r\n\r\n“It is expressly intended for publication,” said Humpty Dumpty; “I don’t\r\nsuppose there’ll be a paper to-morrow that won’t be talking about it.”\r\n\r\n“In that case I suppose I may as well hear it,” said Alice, with\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n“The scene,” said Humpty Dumpty, “is Before Ladysmith, and the\r\ntime--well, the time is After Colenso:\r\n\r\n    I sent a message to the White\r\n    To tell him--if you _must_, you might.\r\n\r\n    But then, I said, you p’raps might not\r\n    (The weather was _extremely_ hot).\r\n\r\n    This query, too, I spatchcock-slid,\r\n    How would you do it, if you did?\r\n\r\n    I did not know, I rather thought--\r\n    And then I wondered if I ought.”\r\n\r\n“It’s dreadfully hard to understand,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“It gets easier as it goes on,” said Humpty Dumpty, and resumed--\r\n\r\n    They tried a most malignant scheme,\r\n    They put dead horses in the stream;\r\n\r\n    (With One at home I saw it bore\r\n    On preference for a horseless war).\r\n\r\n    But though I held the war might cease,\r\n    At least I never held my peace.\r\n\r\n    I held the key; it was a bore\r\n    I could not hit upon the door.\r\n\r\n    Then One suggested, in my ear,\r\n    It would be well to persevere.\r\n\r\n    The papers followed in that strain,\r\n    _They_ said it very loud and plain.\r\n\r\n    I simply answered with a grin,\r\n    “Why, what a hurry they are in!”\r\n\r\n    I went and played a waiting game;\r\n    Observe, I got there just the same.\r\n\r\n    And if you _have_ a better man,\r\n    Well, show him to me, _if_ you can.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much,” said Alice; “it’s very interesting, but I’m\r\nafraid it won’t help to cool the atmosphere much.”\r\n\r\n“I could tell you lots more like that,” Humpty Dumpty began, but Alice\r\nhastily interrupted him.\r\n\r\n“I hear a lot of fighting going on in the wood; don’t you think I had\r\nbetter hear the rest some other time?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE IN A FOG_\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Duke and Duchess!” said the White Rabbit nervously, as it went\r\nscurrying past; “they may be here at any moment, and I haven’t got it\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n“Hasn’t got what?” wondered Alice.\r\n\r\n“A rhyme for Cornwall,” said the Rabbit, as if in answer to her thought;\r\n“borne well, yawn well”--and he pattered away into the distance,\r\ndropping in his hurry a folded paper that he had been carrying.\r\n\r\n“What have you got there?” asked the Cheshire Cat as Alice picked up the\r\npaper and opened it.\r\n\r\n“It seems to be a kind of poetry,” said Alice doubtfully; “at least,”\r\nshe added, “some of the words rhyme and none of them appear to have any\r\nparticular meaning.”\r\n\r\n“What is it about?” asked the Cat.\r\n\r\n“Well, some one seems to be coming somewhere from everywhere else, and\r\nto get a mixed reception:\r\n\r\n    _ ... Your Father smiles,_\r\n    _Your Mother weeps._”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard something like that before,” said the Cat; “it went on, if I\r\nremember, ‘Your aunt has the pen of the gardener.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITE RABBIT.]\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing about that here,” said Alice; “supposing she didn’t\r\nweep when the time came?”\r\n\r\n“She would if she had to read all that stuff,” said the Cat.\r\n\r\n“And then it goes on--\r\n\r\n    _You went as came the swallow._”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t help us unless we know how the swallow came,” observed the\r\nCat. “If he went as the swallow usually travels he would have won the\r\nDeutsch Prize.”\r\n\r\n    “ ..._homeward draw_\r\n     _Now it hath winged its way to winters green._”\r\n\r\n“There seems to have been some urgent reason for avoiding the swallow,”\r\ncontinued Alice. “Then all sorts of things happened to the Almanac:\r\n\r\n    _Twice a hundred dawns, a hundred noons, a hundred eves._\r\n\r\n“You see there were two dawns to every noon and evening--it must have\r\nbeen dreadfully confusing.”\r\n\r\n“It would be at first, of course,” agreed the Cat.\r\n\r\n“I think it must have been that extra dawn that\r\n\r\n    _Never swallow or wandering sea-bird saw_\r\n\r\nor else it was the Flag.”\r\n\r\n“What flag?”\r\n\r\n“Well, the flag that some one found,\r\n\r\n    _Scouring the field or furrowing the sea._”\r\n\r\n“Would you mind explaining,” said the Cat, “which was doing the scouring\r\nand furrowing?”\r\n\r\n“The flag,” said Alice, “or the some one. It isn’t exactly clear, and\r\nit doesn’t make sense either way. Anyhow, wherever the flag was it\r\nfloated o’er the Free.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING?” SAID THE CAT.]\r\n\r\n“Come, that tells us something. Whoever it was must have avoided\r\nDartmoor and St. Helena.”\r\n\r\n    “_You, wandering, saw,_\r\n     _Young Commonwealths you found._”\r\n\r\n“There’s a great deal of wandering in the poem,” observed the Cat.\r\n\r\n“You sailed from us to them, from them to us,” continued Alice.\r\n\r\n“That isn’t new, either. It _should_ go on: ‘You all returned from him\r\nto them, though they were mine before.’”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t go on quite like that,” said Alice; “it ends up with a lot\r\nof words that I suppose were left over and couldn’t be fitted in\r\nanywhere else:\r\n\r\n    _Therefore rejoicing mightier hath been made_\r\n    _Imperial Power._”\r\n\r\n“That,” said the Cat, “is the cleverest thing in the whole poem. People\r\nsee that at the end, and then they read it through to see what on earth\r\nit’s about.”\r\n\r\n“I’d give sixpence to any one who can explain it,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE HAS TEA AT THE HOTEL CECIL_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe March Hare and the Dormouse and the Hatter were seated at a very\r\nneglected-looking tea-table; they were evidently in agonised\r\nconsideration of something--even the Dormouse, which was asleep, had a\r\nnote of interrogation in its tail.\r\n\r\n“No room!” they shouted, as soon as they caught sight of Alice.\r\n\r\n“There’s lots of room for improvement,” said Alice, as she sat down.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got no business to be here,” said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n“And if you had any business you wouldn’t be here, you know,” said the\r\nHatter; “I hope you don’t suppose this is a business gathering. What\r\nwill you have to eat?” he continued.\r\n\r\nAlice looked at a long list of dishes with promising names, but nearly\r\nall of them seemed to be crossed off.\r\n\r\n“That list was made nearly seven years ago, you know,” said the March\r\nHare, in explanation.\r\n\r\n“But you can always have patience,” said the Hatter. “You begin with\r\npatience and we do the rest.” And he leaned back and seemed prepared to\r\ndo a lot of rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEA AT THE HOTEL CECIL.\r\n\r\n(_With apologies to Everybody Concerned._)]\r\n\r\n“Your manners want mending,” said the March Hare suddenly to Alice.\r\n\r\n“They don’t,” she replied indignantly.\r\n\r\n“It’s very rude to contradict,” said the Hatter; “you would like to hear\r\nme sing something.”\r\n\r\nAlice felt that it would be unwise to contradict again, so she said\r\nnothing, and the Hatter began:\r\n\r\n    Dwindle, dwindle, little war,\r\n    How I wonder more and more,\r\n    As about the veldt you hop\r\n    When you really mean to stop.\r\n\r\n“Talking about stopping,” interrupted the March Hare anxiously, “I\r\nwonder how my timepiece is behaving.”\r\n\r\nHe took out of his pocket a large chronometer of complicated\r\nworkmanship, and mournfully regarded it.\r\n\r\n“It’s dreadfully behind the times,” he said, giving it an experimental\r\nshake. “I would take it to pieces at once if I was at all sure of\r\ngetting the bits back in their right places.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with it?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“The wheels seem to get stuck,” said the March Hare. “There is too much\r\nIrish butter in the works.”\r\n\r\n“Ruins the thing from a dramatic point of view,” said the Hatter; “too\r\nmany scenes, too few acts.”\r\n\r\n“The result is we never have time to get through the day’s work. It’s\r\nnever even time for a free breakfast-table; we do what we can for\r\neducation at odd moments, but we shall all die of old age before we have\r\na moment to spare for social duties.”\r\n\r\n“You might lose a lot if you run your business in that way,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “DWINDLE, DWINDLE, LITTLE WAR.”]\r\n\r\n“Not in this country,” said the March Hare. “You see, we have a\r\nCommission on everything that we don’t do.”\r\n\r\n“The Dormouse must tell us a story,” said the Hatter, giving it a sharp\r\npinch.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse awoke with a start, and began as though it had been awake\r\nall the time: “There was an old woman who lived in a shoe----”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Alice, “she had so many children that she didn’t know\r\nwhat to do.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRYING TO MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE A LION.]\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the sort,” said the Dormouse, “you lack the gift of\r\nimagination. She put most of them into Treasuries and Foreign Offices\r\nand Boards of Trade, and all sorts of unlikely places where they could\r\nlearn things.”\r\n\r\n“What did they learn?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“Painting in glowing colours, and attrition, and terminology (that’s the\r\nscience of knowing when things are over), and iteration (that’s the same\r\nthing over again), and drawing----”\r\n\r\n“What did they draw?”\r\n\r\n“Salaries. And then there were classes for foreign languages. And such\r\nlanguage!” (Here the March Hare and the Hatter shut their eyes and took\r\na big gulp from their tea-cups.) “However, I don’t think anybody\r\nattended to them.”\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse broke off into a chuckle which ended in a snore, and as no\r\none seemed inclined to wake it up again Alice thought she might as well\r\nbe going.\r\n\r\nWhen she looked back the Hatter and the March Hare were trying to\r\nstiffen the Dormouse out into the attitude of a lion guardant. “But it\r\nwill never pass for anything but a Dormouse if it will snore so,” she\r\nremarked to herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ALICE GOES TO CHESTERFIELD_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice noticed a good deal of excitement going on among the Looking-Glass\r\ncreatures: some of them were hurrying off expectantly in one direction,\r\nas fast as their legs would carry them, while others were trying to look\r\nas if nothing in particular was about to happen.\r\n\r\n“Those mimsy-looking birds,” she said, catching sight of a group that\r\ndid not look in the best of spirits, “those must be Borogoves. I’ve read\r\nabout them somewhere; in some parts of the country they have to be\r\nprotected. And, I declare, there is the White King coming through the\r\nWood.”\r\n\r\nAlice went to meet the King, who was struggling with a very unwieldy\r\npencil to write something in a notebook. “It’s a memorandum of my\r\nfeelings, in case I forget them,” he explained. “Only,” he added, “I’m\r\nnot quite sure that I meant to put it that way.”\r\n\r\nAlice peeped over his shoulder and read: “The High Commissioner may\r\ntumble off his post; he balances very badly.”\r\n\r\n“Could you tell me,” she asked, “what all the excitement is about just\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t an idea,” said the White King, “unless it’s the awakening.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AWAKENING.]\r\n\r\n“The what?” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“The Red King, you know; he’s been asleep for ever so long, and he’s\r\ngoing to wake up to-day. Not that it makes any difference that I can\r\nsee--he talks just as loud when he’s asleep.”\r\n\r\nAlice remembered having seen the Red King, in rose-coloured armour that\r\nhad got a little rusty, sleeping uneasily in the thickest part of the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” the White King went on, “some of them think we’re only a\r\npart of his dream, and that we shall all go ‘piff’ when he wakes up.\r\nThat is what makes them so jumpy just now. Oh,” he cried, giving a\r\nlittle jump himself, “there go some more!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RED KING IN THE WOOD.]\r\n\r\n“What are they?” asked Alice, as several strange creatures hurtled past,\r\nlike puff-balls in a gale.\r\n\r\n“They’re the Slithy Toves,” said the King, “Libimps and Jubjubs and\r\nBandersnatches. They’re always gyring and gimbling wherever they can\r\nfind a wabe.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITE KING.]\r\n\r\n“Where are they all going in such a hurry?” Alice asked.\r\n\r\n“They’re going to the meeting to hear the Red King,” the White King\r\nsaid, in rather a dismal tone. “They’ve all got latchkeys,” he went on,\r\n“but they’d better not stay out too late.”\r\n\r\nHere the White King gave another jump. “What’s the matter?” asked Alice.\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ve just remembered that I’ve got a latchkey too, my very own! I\r\nmust go and find it.” And away went the White King into the wood.\r\n\r\n“How these kings do run about!” thought Alice. “It seems to be one of\r\nthe Rules of the Game that when one moves the other moves also.”\r\n\r\nThe next moment there was a deafening outburst of drums, and Alice saw\r\nthe Red King rushing through the wood with a big roll of paper.\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” she heard him say to himself as he passed, “I hope I sha’n’t\r\nbe late for the meeting, and I wonder how they’ll take my speech.”\r\n\r\nAlice noticed that the Borogoves made no attempt to follow, but tried to\r\nlook as if they didn’t care a bit. And away in the distance she heard a\r\nsort of derisive booing, with a brogue in it. “That must be the Mome\r\nRaths outgribing,” she thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE AGED MAN_\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Westminster Gazette_, May 16, 1901.]\r\n\r\n(_With apologies to Sir John Tenniel._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n    I shook him well from side to side\r\n      Until his face was blue.\r\n    “Come, tell me where’s the Bill,” I cried,\r\n      “And what you’re going to do.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    He said, “I hunt for gibes and pins\r\n      To prick the Bishops’ calves,\r\n    I search for Royal Commissions, too,\r\n      To use as safety valves.”\r\n\r\n[_See the Debate on Temperance Legislation in the House of Lords, May\r\n14, 1901._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SPADES IN WONDERLAND_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _Westminster Gazette_, January 24, 1902.]\r\n\r\nTHE RED KING: Harcourt, Grey, and Lloyd-George are all putting their own\r\ncolours on, I think I’d better paint it myself.]\r\n\r\n                          The Gresham Press,\r\n\r\n                       UNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED,\r\n\r\n                          WOKING AND LONDON.",
