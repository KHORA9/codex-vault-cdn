But many men of great literature\r\n     say there is no purgatory: and that if there were and that\r\n     the Pope may deliver one soul for money, he may deliver him\r\n     as well without money; if one, a thousand; if a thousand,\r\n     all; and so destroy purgatory.                                     10\r\n\r\n  6. _But what remedy?

And seynge there ys no way for attaynyng theyr\r\nentent but one of the twayn / yat ys to wyt eyther playnly to wryte\r\nagaynst the fayth and the sacramentys (wheryn yf they gat them credence\r\nand obtaynyd / they then se[e] well the church must nedys fall therwyth)\r\nor els to labour agaynst the church alone / and get the clergye dystroyd /\r\nwhereuppon they parceyue well that the fayth and sacramentes wo[u]ld not\r\nfayle to decay: they parceyuyng thys / haue therfore furste assayd the\r\nfurst way all redy / sendyng forth Tyndals translacyon of the _new\r\ntestament_ in such wyse handled as yt shuld haue bene the fountayn and\r\nwell spryng of all theyr hole heresyes. For he had corrupted and purposely\r\nchanged in many placys the text / wyth such wordys as he myght make yt\r\nseme to the vnlerned people / that the scripture affirmed theyr heresyes\r\nit selfe. Then cam sone after out in prynt _the dyaloge_ of freere Roy and\r\nfrere Hyerome / _betwene ye father and ye sonne_ [_Preface dated\r\nArgentine_ (Strasburg), _31 August, 1527_] agaynst ye sacrament of ye\r\naulter: and the blasphemouse boke entytled _the beryeng of the masse_\r\n[i.e. _Rede me and be not wroth_ / printed at Strasburg early in 1528].\r\nThen cam forth after Tyndals wykkyd boke of _Mammona_ [_Dated Marburg, 8\r\nMay 1528_] / and after that his more wykkyd boke of obydyence [_Dated\r\nMarburg, 2 October 1528_]. In whych bokys afore specyfyed they go forth\r\nplaynly agaynst the fayth and holy sacramentis of Crystys church / and\r\nmost especyally agaynst the blyssed sacrament of ye aulter / wyth as\r\nvylanous wordes as the wre[t]ches cou[l]d deuyse. But when they haue\r\nperceuyd by experyence yat good people abhorred theyr abomynable bokes:\r\nthen they beyng therby lerned yat the furst way was not ye best for ye\r\nfurtherance of theyr purpose / haue now determined them selfe to assay the\r\nsecunde way / that ys to witte yat forberynge to wryte so openly and\r\ndyrectly agaynste all the fayth and the sacramentys as good crysten men\r\ncoulde not abyde the redyng / they wolde / wyth lyttell towchyng of theyre\r\nother heresyes / make one boke specially agaynst ye church and loke how\r\nthat wold proue.\r\n\r\nThe previous controversial work produced by Sir THOMAS MORE had but\r\nrecently appeared under the title of\r\n\r\n¶ A dialoge of syr Thomas More knighte: one of the counsayll of oure\r\nsouerayne lorde the kyng and chauncellor of hys duchy of Lancaster. Wherin\r\nbe treatyd diuers matters / as of the veneration and worshyp of ymagys and\r\nrelyques / prayng to sayntys / and goyng on pylgrymage. Wyth many othere\r\nthyngys touchyng the pestelent sect of Luther and Tyndale / by th[e] one\r\nbegone in Saxony / and by th[e] other laboryd to be brought in to Englond.\r\n\r\n[COLOPHON]. Emprynted at London at the sygne of the meremayd at Powlys\r\ngate next to chepe syde in the moneth of June the yere of our lord.\r\nM.C.C.XXIX. _Cum priuilegio Regali._\r\n\r\nOf this extraordinarily scarce first edition, there is a copy in the\r\nCorporation Library, London.\r\n\r\nAs Sir THOMAS MORE felt it necessary to write this second work, of the\r\n_Supplicacyon of Soulys, after_ he had composed his _Dialogue_ the\r\nprinting of which was finished in June 1529; and as his _Supplicacyon_\r\ncertainly was written and published prior to his advancement on the 24th\r\nOctober following: it is conclusive that S. Fish's tract had not appeared\r\n_before_ he was writing the _Dialogue_, and therefore that the date of its\r\ndistribution must by this internal evidence, be fixed as in the spring or\r\nsummer of 1529; however that date may conflict with early testimony, such\r\nas incorrect lists of prohibited books, assigning it to 1524, 1526, etc.\r\n\r\nYet JOHN FOX in his _Actes and Monumentes_, [Third Edition] _fol._ 987,\r\n_Ed._ 1576, states that was\r\n\r\n     \"Throwen and scattered at the procession in Westminster vpon\r\n     Candlemas day [? _2nd February 1529_] before kyng Henry the viij, for\r\n     him to read and peruse.\"\r\n\r\nWe have been unable to verify this procession at Westminster on this\r\nparticular date, and think that if it had been so, Sir THOMAS MORE would\r\nhave surely noticed to the _Supplicacyon_ while writing the _Dialogue_,\r\nthe printing of which was in progress during the next four months. He may,\r\nhowever, have thought it necessary to write a special book against S.\r\nFISH's tract, with its distinct line of attack as he has accurately stated\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the Bibliography that this date of the Spring of 1529\r\nquite harmonizes with those of the contemporary German and Latin\r\ntranslations; which, naturally, would be prompt. It is also not\r\ninconsistent with the following allusion at p. 30 to Cardinal WOLSEY's\r\nstill holding the Lord Chancellorship.\r\n\r\n¶ And this is by the reason that the chief instrument of youre lawe ye[a]\r\nthe chief of your counsell and he whiche hath your swerde in his hond to\r\nwhome also all the other instrumentes are obedient is alweys a spirituell\r\nman.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, as to the certain approximate date of the publication. FOX\r\nis quite wrong in assuming as he does in the following paragraph that this\r\nwork was the occasion of Bishop TONSTAL's _Prohibition_ of the 24th\r\nOctober 1526, _i.e._ more than two years previously.\r\n\r\nAfter that the Clergye of England, and especially the Cardinall,\r\nvnderstoode these bookes of the _Beggars supplication_ aforesayd, to be\r\nstrawne abroade in the streetes of London, and also before the kyng. The\r\nsayd Cardinall caused not onely his seruauntes diligently to attend to\r\ngather them vp, that they should not come into the kynges handes, but also\r\nwhen he vnderstode, that the king had receaued one or two of them, he came\r\nvnto the kynges Maiesty saying: \"If it shall please your grace, here are\r\ndiuers seditious persons which haue scattered abroad books conteyning\r\nmanifest errours and heresies\" desiryng his grace to beware of them.\r\nWhereupon the kyng putting his hand in his bosome, tooke out one of the\r\nbookes and deliuered it vnto the Cardinall. Then the Cardinall, together\r\nwith the Byshops, consulted _&c._\r\n\r\n                                   _Eccles. Hist. &c., p. 900. Ed. 1576._\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the only authoritative account of our Author, as it is\r\nrecorded in the same Third Edition of the _Actes and Monumentes &c., p.\r\n896. Ed. 1576_.\r\n\r\n¶ _The story of M_[_aster_]. _Simon Fishe._\r\n\r\nBefore the tyme of M[aster]. Bilney, and the fall of the Cardinall, I\r\nshould haue placed the story of Symon Fish with the booke called the\r\n_Supplication of Beggars_, declaryng how and by what meanes it came to the\r\nkynges hand, and what effect therof followed after, in the reformation of\r\nmany thynges, especially of the Clergy. But the missyng of a few yeares in\r\nthis matter, breaketh no great square in our story, though it be now\r\nentred here which should haue come in sixe yeares before.\r\n\r\nFOX is writing of 1531, and therefore intends us to understand that the\r\npresent narrative begins in 1525.\r\n\r\nThe maner and circumstaunce of the matter is this:\r\n\r\nAfter that the light of the Gospel workyng mightely in Germanie, began to\r\nspread his beames here also in England, great styrre and alteration\r\nfollowed in the harts of many: so that colored hypocrisie and false\r\ndoctrine, and painted holynes began to be espyed more and more by the\r\nreadyng of Gods word. The authoritie of the Bishop of Rome, and the glory\r\nof his Cardinals was not so high, but such as had fresh wittes sparcled\r\nwith Gods grace, began to espy Christ from Antichrist, that is, true\r\nsinceritie, from counterfait religion. In the number of whom, was the sayd\r\nM[aster]. Symon Fish, a Gentleman of Grayes Inne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ex certa relatione, vivoque testimonio propriæ ipsius\r\nconiugis._]\r\n\r\nIt happened the first yeare that this Gentleman came to London to dwell,\r\nwhich was about the yeare of our Lord 1525 [_i.e. between 25 Mar. 1525 and\r\n24 Mar. 1526_] that there was a certaine play or interlude made by one\r\nMaster Roo of the same Inne Gentleman, in which play partly was matter\r\nagaynst the Cardinal Wolsey. And where none durst take vpon them to play\r\nthat part, whiche touched the sayd Cardinall, this foresayd M. Fish tooke\r\nupon him to do it, whereupon great displeasure ensued agaynst him, vpon\r\nthe Cardinals part: In so much as he beyng pursued by the sayd Cardinall,\r\nthe same night that this Tragedie was playd, was compelled of force to\r\nvoyde his owne house, and so fled ouer the Sea vnto Tyndall.\r\n\r\nWe will here interrupt the Martyrologist's account, with EDWARD HALLE's\r\ndescription of this \"goodly disguisyng.\" It occurs at _fol._ 155 of the\r\nhistory of the eighteenth year of the reign of Henry VIII. [22 April 1526\r\nto 21 April 1527] in his _Vnion of the two noble and illustrate families\r\nof Lancastre and York &c._ 1548.\r\n\r\nThis Christmas [1526] was a goodly disguisyng plaied at Greis inne, whiche\r\nwas compiled for the moste part, by Master Jhon Roo, seriant at the law.\r\n[some] xx. yere past, and long before the Cardinall had any aucthoritie,\r\nthe effecte of the plaie was, that lord Gouernaunce was ruled by\r\nDissipacion and Negligence, by whose misgouernance and euil order, lady\r\nPublike Wele was put from gouernance: which caused _Rumor Populi_, Inward\r\nGrudge and Disdain of Wanton Souereignetie, to rise with a greate\r\nmultitude, to expell Negligence and Dissipacion, and to restore Publike\r\nWelth again to her estate, which was so doen.\r\n\r\nThis plaie was so set furth with riche and costly apparel, with straunge\r\ndiuises of Maskes and morrishes [_morris dancers_] that it was highly\r\npraised of all menne, sauing of the Cardinall, whiche imagined that the\r\nplaie had been diuised of hym, and in a great furie sent for the said\r\nmaster Roo, and toke from hym his Coyfe, and sent hym to the Flete, and\r\nafter he sent for the yong gentlemen, that plaied in the plaie, and them\r\nhighley rebuked and thretened, and sent one of them called Thomas Moyle of\r\nKent to the Flete. But by the meanes of frendes Master Roo and he were\r\ndeliuered at last.\r\n\r\nThis plaie sore displeased the Cardinall, and yet it was neuer meante to\r\nhym, as you haue harde, wherfore many wisemen grudged to see hym take it\r\nso hartely, and euer the Cardinall saied that the kyng was highly\r\ndispleased with it, and spake nothyng of hymself.\r\n\r\nThere is no question as to the date of this \"disguisyng.\" Archbishop\r\nWARHAM on the 6th February 1527, wrote to his chaplain, HENRY GOLDE, from\r\nKnolle that he \"Has received his letters, dated London, 6 Feb., stating\r\nthat Mr. Roo is committed to the Tower for making a certain play. Is sorry\r\nsuch a matter should be taken in earnest.\" _Letters &c. HENRY VIII._ Ed.\r\nby J. S. BREWER, _p._ 1277. _Ed._ 1872.\r\n\r\nIt would seem however that FISH either did not go or did not stay long\r\nabroad at this time. STRYPE (_Eccles. Mem. I. Part II, pp. 63-5. Ed.\r\n1822_) has printed, from the Registers of the Bishops of LONDON, the\r\nConfession in 1528 of ROBERT NECTON (a person of position, whose brother\r\nbecame Sheriff of Norwich in 1530), by which it appears that during the\r\nprevious eighteen months, that is from about the beginning of 1527, our\r\nAuthor was \"dwellyng by the Wight Friars in London;\" and was actively\r\nengaged in the importation and circulation of TYNDALE's _New Testaments_,\r\na perfectly hazardous work at that time.\r\n\r\nPossibly this Confession was the occasion of a first or a renewed flight\r\nby FISH to the Continent, and therefore the ultimate cause of the present\r\nlittle work in the following year.\r\n\r\nWe now resume FOX's account, which was evidently derived from FISH's wife,\r\nwhen she was in old age.\r\n\r\nVpon occasion wherof the next yeare folowyng this booke was made (being\r\nabout the yeare 1527) and so not long after in the yeare (as I suppose)\r\n1528 [_which by the old reckoning ended on the 24 Mar. 1529_]. was sent\r\nouer to the Lady Anne Bulleyne, who then lay at a place not farre from the\r\nCourt. Which booke her brother seyng in her hand, tooke it and read it,\r\nand gaue it [to] her agayne, willyng her earnestly to giue it to the kyng,\r\nwhich thyng she so dyd.\r\n\r\nThis was (as I gather) about the yeare of our Lord 1528 [-1529].\r\n\r\nThe kyng after he had receaued the booke, demaunded of her \"who made it.\"\r\nWhereunto she aunswered and sayd, \"a certaine subiect of his, one Fish,\r\nwho was fled out of the Realme for feare of the Cardinall.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the kyng had kept the booke in his bosome iij. or iiij. dayes, as is\r\ncredibly reported, such knowledge was giuen by the kynges seruauntes to\r\nthe wife of ye sayd Symon Fishe, yat she might boldly send for her\r\nhusband, without all perill or daunger. Whereupon she thereby beyng\r\nincouraged, came first and made sute to the kyng for the safe returne of\r\nher husband. Who vnderstandyng whose wife she was, shewed a maruelous\r\ngentle and chearefull countenaunce towardes her, askyng \"where her husband\r\nwas.\" She aunswered, \"if it like your grace, not farre of[f].\" Then sayth\r\nhe, \"fetch him, and he shal come and go safe without perill, and no man\r\nshal do him harme,\" saying moreouer, \"that hee had [had] much wrong that\r\nhee was from her so long:\" who had bene absent now the space of two yeares\r\nand a halfe,\r\n\r\n     Which from Christmas 1526 would bring us to June 1529, which\r\n     corroborates the internal evidence above quoted. FOX evidently now\r\n     confuses together two different interviews with the King. The first\r\n     at the Court in June 1529; the other on horseback with the King,\r\n     followed afterwards by his Message to Sir T. MORE in the winter of\r\n     1529-30, within six months after which S. FISH dies. His wife never\r\n     would have been admitted to the Court, if she had had a daughter ill\r\n     of the plague at home.\r\n\r\nIn the whiche meane tyme, the Cardinall was deposed, as is aforeshewed,\r\nand M[aster]. More set in his place of the Chauncellourshyp.\r\n\r\nThus Fishes wife beyng emboldened by the kynges wordes, went immediatly to\r\nher husband beyng lately come ouer, and lying priuely within a myle of the\r\nCourt, and brought him to the kyng: which appeareth to be about the yeare\r\nof our Lord. 1530.\r\n\r\nWhen the kyng saw hym, and vnderstood he was the authour of the booke, he\r\ncame and embraced him with louing countenance: who after long talke: for\r\nthe space of iij. or iiij. houres, as they were ridyng together on\r\nhuntyng, at length dimitted him, and bad him \"take home his wife, for she\r\nhad taken great paynes for him.\" Who answered the kyng agayne and sayd, he\r\n\"durst not so do, for fear of Syr Thomas More then Chauncellor, and\r\nStoksley then Bishop of London. This seemeth to be about the yeare of our\r\nLord. 1530.\r\n\r\nThis bringing in of STOKESLEY as Bishop is only making confusion worse\r\nconfounded. STOKESLEY was consecrated to the see of London on the 27th\r\nNov. 1530. By that time, S. FISH had died of the plague which occurred in\r\nLondon and its suburbs in the summer of 1530; and which was so severe,\r\nthat on 22nd June of that year, the King prorogued the Parliament to the\r\nfollowing 1st October. _Letters &c. HENRY VIII._ Ed. by J. S. BREWER,\r\nM.A., IV, Part 3, No. 6469. _Ed._ 1876.\r\n\r\nThe Martyrologist, throughout, seems to be right as to his facts, but\r\nwrong as to his dates.\r\n\r\nThe kyng takyng his signet of[f] his finger, willed hym to haue hym\r\nreommended to the Lord Chauncellour, chargyng him not to bee so hardy to\r\nworke him any harme.\r\n\r\nMaster Fishe receiuyng the kynges signet, went and declared hys message to\r\nthe Lord Chauncellour, who tooke it as sufficient for his owne discharge,\r\nbut asked him \"if he had any thynge for the discharge of his wife:\" for\r\nshe a litle before had by chaunce displeased the Friers, for not sufferyng\r\nthem to say their Gospels in Latine in her house, as they did in others,\r\nvnlesse they would say it in English. Whereupon the Lord Chauncellour,\r\nthough he had discharged the man, yet leauyng not his grudge towardes the\r\nwife, the next morning sent his man for her to appeare before hym: who,\r\nhad it not bene for her young daughter, which then lay sicke of the\r\nplague, had bene lyke to come to much trouble.\r\n\r\nOf the which plague her husband, the said Master Fish deceasing with in\r\nhalf a yeare, she afterward maryed to one Master James Baynham, Syr\r\nAlexander Baynhams sonne, a worshypful Knight of Glo[uce]stershyre. The\r\nwhich foresayd Master James Baynham, not long after, [1 May 1532] was\r\nburned, as incontinently after in the processe of this story, shall\r\nappeare.\r\n\r\nAnd thus much concernyng Symon Fishe the author of the _booke of beggars_,\r\nwho also translated a booke called _the Summe of the Scripture_ out of the\r\nDutch [_i.e. German_].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow commeth an other note of one Edmund Moddys the kynges footeman,\r\ntouchyng the same matter.\r\n\r\nThis M[aster]. Moddys beyng with the kyng in talke of religion, and of the\r\nnew bookes that were come from beyond the seas, sayde \"if it might please\r\nhys grace, he should see such a booke, as was maruell to heare of.\" The\r\nkyng demaunded \"what they were.\" He sayd, \"two of your Merchauntes, George\r\nElyot, and George Robinson.\" The kyng [ap]poynted a tyme to speake with\r\nthem. When they came before his presence in a priuye [_private_] closet,\r\nhe demaunded \"what they had to saye, or to shew him\" One of them said \"yat\r\nthere was a boke come to their hands, which they were there to shew his\r\ngrace.\" When he saw it, hee demaunded \"if any of them could read it.\"\r\n\"Yea\" sayd George Elyot, \"if it please your grace to heare it,\" \"I thought\r\nso\" sayd the kyng, \"for if neede were thou canst say it without booke.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole booke beyng read out, the kyng made a long pause, and then sayd,\r\n\"if a man should pull downe an old stone wall and begyn at the lower part,\r\nthe vpper part thereof might chaunce to fall vpon his head:\" and then he\r\ntooke the booke and put it into his deske, and commaunded them vpon their\r\nallegiance, that they should not tell to any man, that he had sene the\r\nbooke.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTo this account we may add two notices. Sir T. MORE replying in his\r\n_Apology_ to the \"Pacifier\" [CHRISTOPHER SAINT GERMAIN] in the spring of\r\n1533, gives at _fol._ 124, the following account of our Author's death--\r\n\r\nAnd these men in the iudgement of thys pytuouse pacyfyer be not dyscrete /\r\nbut yet they haue he sayth a good zele though. And thys good zele hadde,\r\nye wote well, Simon Fysshe when he made the supplycacyon of beggers. But\r\ngod gaue hym such grace afterwarde, that he was sory for that good zele,\r\nand repented hym selfe and came into the chyrche agayne, and forsoke and\r\nforsware all the whole hyll of those heresyes, out of whiche the fountayne\r\nof that same good zele sprange. [Also at _p._ 881, _Workes. Ed. 1557_.]\r\n\r\nThis is contrary to the tenour of everything else that we know of the man:\r\nbut Sir T. MORE, possessing such excellent means of obtaining information,\r\nmay nevertheless be true.\r\n\r\nLastly. ANTHONY À WOOD in his _Ath. Oxon._ i. 59, _Ed._ 1813, while giving\r\nus the wrong year of his death, tells us of his place of burial.\r\n\r\nAt length being overtaken by the pestilence, died of it in fifteen hundred\r\nthirty and one, and was buried in the church of St. Dunstan (in the West).\r\n\r\nTYNDALE had often preached in this church.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nWhat a picture of the cruel, unclean and hypocritical monkery that was\r\neating at the heart's core of English society is given to us in this terse\r\nand brave little book? Abate from its calculations whatever in fairness\r\nSir T. MORE would have wished us to deduct; we cannot but shudder as we\r\ntry to realize the then social condition of our country; and all the more,\r\nwhen we remember that the fountain of all this unmercifulness, impurity\r\nand ignorance was found in the very persons who professed to be, and who\r\nshould have been the Divine Teachers of our nation. It argues, too, much\r\nfor the virility of the English race, that it could have sustained, in\r\ngradually increasing intensity, such a widespread mass of festering and\r\ncorroding blotches of vice, and could by and bye throw it off altogether;\r\nso that in subsequent ages no other nation has surpassed us in manhood.\r\n\r\nIt is marvellous to us how the ecclesiastical fungus could have ever so\r\nblotted out of sight both the royal prerogative and the people's\r\nliberties. Was not HENRY VIII the man for this hour? A bold lusty and\r\nmasterful one, imperious and impatient of check, full of the animal\r\nenjoyment of life; yet a remarkable Theologian, a crafty Statesman, a true\r\nEnglishman. Often referred to in the literature of this time as \"our Lord\r\nand Master.\" Had England ever had such a Master! ever such a Lord of life\r\nand limb since? A character to the personal humouring and gratification of\r\nwhom, such an one as WOLSEY devoted his whole soul and directed all the\r\npowers of the State.\r\n\r\nHow necessary was so strong a ruler for our national disruption with Rome!\r\nIt is not easy for us to realize what an amazingly difficult thing that\r\nwrench was. MODDYS' story witnesses to us of the King's great perplexity.\r\nBy what difficult disillusions, what slow and painful thoughtfulness did\r\nHENRY's mind travel from the _Assertio_ of 1522 and the consequent\r\n_Defensor fidei_, to the destruction of the monasteries in 1536. Truly, if\r\nin this \"passion\" he vacillated or made mistakes; we may consider the\r\ninherent difficulty of disbelief in what--despite its increasing\r\ncorruptions--had been the unbroken faith of this country for a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWe call the disillusionists, the Reformers; but FISH describes them as\r\n\r\n     men of greate litterature and iudgement that for the love they haue\r\n     vnto the trouth and vnto the comen welth haue not feared to put theim\r\n     silf ynto the greatest infamie that may be, in abiection of all the\r\n     world, ye[a] in perill of deth to declare theyre oppinion.... _p._\r\n     10.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly HENRY personally was the secular Apostle of the first phase of\r\nour Reformation. The section of doctrinal Protestants was politically\r\ninsignificant: and it may be fairly doubted whether the King could have\r\ncarried the nation with him, but that in the experience of every\r\nintelligent Englishman, the cup of the iniquity of the priesthood was full\r\nto overflowing. He was aided by the strong general reaction of our simple\r\nhumanity against the horrid sensuality, the scientific villany offered to\r\nit by the supposed special agents of Almighty GOD in the name of, and\r\ncloaked under the authority believed to have been given to them from the\r\never blessed Trinity.\r\n\r\nMorality is the lowest expression of religion, the forerunner of faith. No\r\nreligion can be of GOD which does not instinctively preassume in its\r\nvotaries the constant striving after the highest and purest moral\r\nexcellence. It is an intolerable matter, beyond all possible sufferance,\r\nwhen religion is made to pander to sensuality and extortion. How bitter a\r\nthing this was to this barrister of Gray's Inn, may be seen in the strange\r\nterms of terror and ravin with which he characterizes these \"strong,\r\npuissant, counterfeit holy, and idle beggars.\" To the untravelled\r\nEnglishman of Henry VIII's reign, \"cormorants\" must have meant some like\r\ndevouring griffins, and \"locusts\" as a ruthless irremediable and fearful\r\nplague without end. By such mental conceptions of utter desolation,\r\nimpoverishment and misery does our Author express the bitterness of the\r\nthen proved experience by Englishmen, of the combined hierarchy and\r\nmonkery of Rome.\r\n\r\nAll which is for our consideration in estimating the necessity and policy\r\nof the subsequent suppression of the monasteries.\r\n\r\nThese representations are also some mitigation of what is sometimes\r\nthought to be the Protestant frenzy of our great Martyrologist, whose\r\nwords of burning reprobation of the Papal system of his time seem often to\r\nus to be extravagant; because, by the good providence of GOD, we are\r\nhardly capable of realizing the widespread and scientific villany of the\r\ndelusions and enormities against which he protested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ A Supplicacyon for the Beggers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE KING OVRE\r\n  souereygne lorde.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost lamentably compleyneth theyre wofull mysery vnto youre highnes youre\r\npoore daily bedemen the wretched hidous monstres (on whome scarcely for\r\nhorror any yie dare loke) the foule vnhappy sorte of lepres, and other\r\nsore people, nedy, impotent, blinde, lame, and sike, that live onely by\r\nalmesse, howe that theyre nombre is daily so sore encreased that all the\r\nalmesse of all the weldisposed people of this youre realme is not halfe\r\nynough for to susteine theim, but that for verey constreint they die for\r\nhunger. And this most pestilent mischief is comen vppon youre saide poore\r\nbeedmen by the reason that there is yn the tymes of youre noble\r\npredecessours passed craftily crept ynto this your realme an other sort\r\n(not of impotent but) of strong puissaunt and counterfeit holy, and ydell\r\nbeggers and vacabundes whiche syns the tyme of theyre first entre by all\r\nthe craft and wilinesse of Satan are nowe encreased vnder your sight not\r\nonely into a great nombre, but also ynto a kingdome. These are (not the\r\nherdes, but the rauinous wolues going in herdes clothing deuouring the\r\nflocke) the Bisshoppes, Abbottes, Priours, Deacons, Archedeacons,\r\nSuffraganes, Prestes, Monkes Chanons, Freres, Pardoners and Somners. And\r\nwho is abill to nombre this idell rauinous sort whiche (setting all\r\nlaboure a side) haue begged so importunatly that they haue gotten ynto\r\ntheyre hondes more then the therd part of all youre Realme. The goodliest\r\nlordshippes, maners, londes, and territories, are theyrs. Besides this\r\nthey haue the tenth part of all the corne, medowe, pasture, grasse, wolle,\r\ncoltes, calues, lambes, pigges, gese, and chikens. Ouer and bisides the\r\ntenth part of euery seruauntes wages the tenth part of the wolle, milke,\r\nhony, waxe, chese, and butter. Ye[a] and they loke so narowly vppon theyre\r\nproufittes that the poore wyues must be countable to theym of euery tenth\r\neg or elles she gettith not her ryghtes at ester shalbe taken as an\r\nheretike. hereto haue they theire foure offering daies. whate money pull\r\nthey yn by probates of testamentes, priuy tithes, and by mennes offeringes\r\nto theyre pilgremages, and at theyre first masses? Euery man and childe\r\nthat is buried must pay sumwhat for masses and diriges to be song for him\r\nor elles they will accuse the de[a]des frendes and executours of heresie.\r\nwhate money get they by mortuaries, by hearing of confessions (and yet\r\nthey wil kepe therof no counceyle) by halowing of churches altares\r\nsuperaltares chapelles and belles, by cursing of men and absoluing theim\r\nagein for money? what a multitude of money gather the pardoners in a yere?\r\nHowe moche money get the Somners by extorcion yn a yere, by assityng the\r\npeople to the commissaries court and afterward releasing th[e] apparaunce\r\nfor money? Finally, the infinite nombre of begging freres whate get they\r\nyn a yere? Here if it please your grace to marke ye shall se a thing farre\r\nout of ioynt. There are withyn youre realme of Englond. lij. thousand\r\nparisshe churches. And this stonding that there be but tenne houshouldes\r\nyn euery parisshe yet are there fiue hundreth thousand and twenty thousand\r\nhoushouldes. And of euery of these houshouldes hath euery of the fiue\r\nordres of freres a peny a quarter for euery ordre, that is for all the\r\nfiue ordres fiue pens a quarter for every house. That is for all the fiue\r\nordres. xx.d. a yere of euery house. Summa fiue hundreth thousand and\r\ntwenty thousand quarters of angels.\r\n\r\nThat is. cclx. thousand half angels.

Oh\r\ngreuous and peynfull exactions thus yerely to be paied. from the whiche\r\nthe people of your nobill predecessours the kinges of the auncient Britons\r\neuer stode fre And this wil they haue or els they wil procure him that\r\nwill not giue it theim to be taken as an heretike. whate tiraunt euer\r\noppressed the people like this cruell and vengeable generacion? whate\r\nsubiectes shall be abill to helpe theire prince that be after this facion\r\nyerely polled? whate good christen people can be abill to socoure vs pore\r\nlepres blinde sore, and lame, that be thus yerely oppressed? Is it any\r\nmerueille that youre people so compleine of pouertie? Is it any merueile\r\nthat the taxes fiftenes and subsidies that your grace most tenderly of\r\ngreat compassion hath taken emong your people to defend theim from the\r\nthretened ruine of theire comon welth haue bin so sloughtfully, ye[a]\r\npainfully leuied? Seing that almost the vtmost peny that mought haue bin\r\nleuied hath ben gathered bifore yerely by this rauinous cruell and\r\ninsatiabill generacion The danes nether the saxons yn the time of the\r\nauncient Britons shulde neuer haue ben abill to haue brought theire armies\r\nfrom so farre hither ynto your lond to haue conquered it if they had had\r\nat that time suche a sort of idell glotons to finde at home. The nobill\r\nking Arthur had neuer ben abill to haue caried his armie to the fote of\r\nthe mountaines to resist the coming downe of lucius the Emperoure if suche\r\nyerely exaction had ben taken of his people. The grekes had neuer ben\r\nabill to haue so long continued at the siege of Troie if they had had at\r\nhome suche an idell sort of cormorauntes to finde. The auncient Romains\r\nhad neuer ben abil to haue put all the hole worlde vnder theyre obeisaunce\r\nif theyre people had byn thus yerely oppressed. The Turke nowe yn youre\r\ntyme shulde neuer be abill to get so moche grounde of cristendome if he\r\nhad yn his empire suche a sort of locustes to deuoure his substance. Ley\r\nthen these sommes to the forseid therd part of the possessions of the\r\nrealme that ye may se whether it drawe nighe vnto the half of the hole\r\nsubstaunce of the realme or not, So shall ye finde that it draweth ferre\r\naboue. Nowe let vs then compare the nombre of this vnkind idell sort vnto\r\nthe nombre of the laye people and we shall se whether it be indifferently\r\nshifted or not that they shuld haue half.\r\n\r\nCompare theim to the nombre of men, so are they not the.

CCCC. parson of\r\ntheire nombre? whate tongue is abill to tell that euer there was eny comon\r\nwelth so sore oppressed sins the worlde first began?\r\n\r\n¶ And whate do al these gredy sort of sturdy idell holy theues with these\r\nyerely exactions that they take of the people? Truely nothing but exempt\r\ntheim silues from th[e] obedience of your grace. Nothing but translate all\r\nrule power lordishippe auctorite obedience and dignite from your grace\r\nvnto theim. Nothing but that all your subiectes shulde fall ynto\r\ndisobedience and rebellion ageinst your grace and be vnder theim. As they\r\ndid vnto your nobill predecessour king Iohn: whiche forbicause that he\r\nwolde haue punisshed certeyn traytours that had conspired with the frenche\r\nking to haue deposed him from his crowne and dignite (emong the whiche a\r\nclerke called Stephen whome afterward ageinst the kinges will the Pope\r\nmade Bisshoppe of Caunterbury was one) enterdited his Lond. For the whiche\r\nmater your most nobill realme wrongfully (alas for shame) hath stond\r\ntributary (not vnto any kind temporall prince, but vnto a cruell\r\ndeuelisshe bloudsupper dronken in the bloude of the sayntes and marters of\r\nchrist) euersins. Here were an holy sort of prelates that thus cruelly\r\ncoude punisshe suche a rightuous kinge, all his realme, and succession for\r\ndoing right.\r\n\r\n¶ Here were a charitable sort of holy men that coude thus enterdite an\r\nhole realme, and plucke awey th[e] obedience of the people from theyre\r\nnaturall liege lorde and kinge, for none other cause but for his\r\nrightuousnesse. Here were a blissed sort not of meke herdes but of\r\nbloudsuppers that coude set the frenche king vppon suche a rightuous\r\nprince to cause hym to lose his crowne and dignite to make effusion of the\r\nbloude of his people, oneles this good and blissed king of greate\r\ncompassion, more fearing and lamenting the sheding of the bloude of his\r\npeople then the losse of his crowne and dignite agaynst all right and\r\nconscience had submitted him silf vnto theym. O case most horrible that\r\neuer so nobill a king Realme, and succession shulde thus be made to stoupe\r\nto suche a sort of bloodsuppers. where was his swerde, power, crowne, and\r\ndignitie become wherby he mought haue done iustice yn this maner? where\r\nwas their obedience become that shuld haue byn subiect vnder his highe\r\npower yn this mater? Ye[a] where was the obedience of all his subiectes\r\nbecome that for mainteinaunce of the comon welth shulde haue holpen him\r\nmanfully to haue resisted these bloudsuppers to the shedinge of theyre\r\nbloude? was not all to gither by theyre polycy translated from this good\r\nking vnto theim. Ye[a] and what do they more? Truely nothing but applie\r\ntheym silues by all the sleyghtes they may haue to do with euery mannes\r\nwife, euery mannes doughter and euery mannes mayde that cukkoldrie and\r\nbaudrie shulde reigne ouer all emong your subiectes, that no man shulde\r\nknowe his owne childe that theyre bastardes might enherite the possessions\r\nof euery man to put the right begotten children clere beside theire\r\ninheritaunce yn subuersion of all estates and godly ordre. These be they\r\nthat by theire absteyning from mariage do let the generation of the people\r\nwher by all the realme at length if it shulde be continued shall be made\r\ndesert and inhabitable.\r\n\r\n¶ These be they that haue made an hundreth thousand ydell hores yn your\r\nrealme whiche wolde haue gotten theyre lyuing honestly, yn the swete of\r\ntheyre faces had not theyre superfluous rychesse illected theym to vnclene\r\nlust and ydelnesse. These be they that corrupt the hole generation of\r\nmankind yn your realme, that catche the pokkes of one woman. and bere\r\ntheym to an other, that be brent wyth one woman, and bere it to an other,\r\nthat catche the lepry of one woman, and bere it to an other, ye[a] some\r\none of theym shall bo[a]st emong his felawes that he hath medled with an\r\nhundreth wymen. These be they that when they haue ones drawen mennes wiues\r\nto such incontinency spende awey theire husbondes goodes make the wimen to\r\nrunne awey from theire husbondes, ye[a], rynne awey them silues both with\r\nwif and goods, bring both man wife and children to ydelnesse theft and\r\nbeggeri.\r\n\r\n¶ Ye[a] who is abill to nombre the greate and brode botomles occean see\r\nfull of euilles that this mischeuous and sinful generacion may laufully\r\nbring vppon vs vnponisshed. where is youre swerde, power, crowne, and\r\ndignitie, become that shuld punisshe (by punisshement of deth euen as\r\nother men are punisshed) the felonies, rapes, murdres, and treasons\r\ncommitted by this sinfull generacion? where is theire obedience become\r\nthat shulde be vnder your hyghe power yn this mater? ys not all to gither\r\ntranslated and exempt from your grace vnto theim? yes truely. whate an\r\ninfinite nombre of people might haue ben encreased to haue peopled the\r\nrealme if these sort of folke had ben maried like other men. what breche\r\nof matrimonie is there brought yn by theim? suche truely as was neuer sins\r\nthe worlde began emong the hole multitude of the hethen.\r\n\r\n¶ who is she that wil set her hondes to worke to get. iij.d. a day and may\r\nhaue at lest. xx.d. a day to slepe an houre with a frere, a monke, or a\r\nprest? what is he that wolde laboure for a grote a day and may haue at\r\nlest. xij.d. a day to be baude to a prest, a monke, or a frere? whate a\r\nsort are there of theime that mari prestes souereigne ladies but to cloke\r\nthe prestes yncontinency and that they may haue a liuing of the prest\r\ntheime silues for theire laboure? Howe many thousandes doth suche\r\nlubricite bring to beggery theft and idelnesse whiche shuld haue kept\r\ntheire good name and haue set theim silues to worke had not ben this\r\nexcesse treasure of the spiritualtie?? whate honest man dare take any man\r\nor woman yn his seruice that hath ben at suche a scole with a spiritual\r\nman? Oh the greuous shipwrak of the comon welth, whiche yn auncient time\r\nbifore the coming yn of these rauinous wolues was so prosperous: that then\r\nthere were but fewe theues: ye[a] theft was at that tyme so rare that\r\nCesar was not compellid to make penalte of deth vppon felony as your grace\r\nmay well perceyue yn his institutes. There was also at that tyme but fewe\r\npore people and yet they did not begge but there was giuen theim ynough\r\nvnaxed, for there was at that time none of these rauinous wolues to axe it\r\nfrom theim as it apperith yn the actes of th[e] appostles. Is it any\r\nmerueill though there be nowe so many beggers, theues, and ydell people?\r\nNay truely.\r\n\r\n¶ whate remedy: make lawes ageynst theim. I am yn doubt whether ye be\r\nable: Are they not stronger in your owne parliament house then your silfe?\r\nwhate a nombre of Bisshopes, abbotes, and priours are lordes of your\r\nparliament? are not all the lerned men in your realme in fee with theim to\r\nspeake yn your parliament house for theim ageinst your crowne, dignitie,\r\nand comon welth of your realme a fewe of youre owne lerned counsell onely\r\nexcepted? whate lawe can be made ageinst theim that may be aduaylable? who\r\nis he (though he be greued never so sore) for the murdre of his auncestre\r\nrauisshement of his wyfe, of his doughter, robbery, trespas, maiheme,\r\ndette, or eny other offence dare ley it theyre charge by any wey of\r\naccion, and if he do then is he by and by by theyre wilynesse accused of\r\nheresie. ye[a] they will so handle him or he passe that except he will\r\nbere a fagot for theyre pleasure he shal be excommunicate and then be all\r\nhis accions dasshed. So captyue are your lawes vnto theym that no man that\r\nthey lyst to excommunicat may be admitted to sue any accion in any of your\r\ncourtes. If eny man yn your sessions dare be so hardy to endyte a prest of\r\neny suche cryme he hath or the yere [_ere he_] go out suche a yoke of\r\nheresye leyd in his necke that it maketh him wisshe that he had not done\r\nit. Your grace may se whate a worke there is in London, howe the bisshoppe\r\nrageth for endyting of certayn curates of extorcion and incontinency the\r\nlast yere in the warmoll quest. Had not Richard hunne commenced accyon of\r\npremunire ageinst a prest he had bin yet a lyue and none heretik at all\r\nbut an honest man.\r\n\r\n¶ Dyd not dyuers of your noble progenitours seynge theyre crowne and\r\ndignite runne ynto ruyne and to be thus craftely translated ynto the\r\nhondes of this myscheuous generacyon make dyuers statutes for the\r\nreformacyon therof, emong whiche the statute of mortmayne was one? to the\r\nintent that after that tyme they shulde haue no more gyuen vnto theim. But\r\nwhate avayled it? haue they not gotten ynto theyre hondes more londes sins\r\nthen eny duke in ynglond hath, the statute notwithstonding? Ye[a] haue\r\nthey not for all that translated ynto theyre hondes from your grace half\r\nyour kyngdome thoroughly? The hole name as reason is for the auncientie of\r\nyour kingdome whiche was bifore theyrs and out of the whiche theyrs is\r\ngrowen onely abiding with your grace? and of one kyngdome made tweyne: the\r\nspirituall kyngdome (as they call it) for they wyll be named first, And\r\nyour temporall kingdome, And whiche of these, ij. kingdomes suppose ye is\r\nlike to ouergrowe the other, ye[a] to put the other clere out of memory?\r\nTruely the kingdome of the bloudsuppers for to theym is giuen daily out of\r\nyour kingdome. And that that is ones gyuen theim comith neuer from theim\r\nagein. Suche lawes haue they that none of theim may nether gyue nor sell\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n¶ whate lawe can be made so stronge ageinst theim that they other with\r\nmoney or elles with other policy will not breake and set at nought? whate\r\nkingdome can endure that euer gyuith thus from him and receyueth nothing\r\nagein? O howe all the substaunce of your Realme forthwith your swerde,\r\npower, crowne, dignite, and obedience of your people, rynneth hedlong ynto\r\nthe insaciabill whyrlepole of these gredi goulafres to be swalowed and\r\ndevoured.\r\n\r\n¶ Nether haue they eny other coloure to gather these yerely exaccions ynto\r\ntheyre hondes but that they sey they pray for vs to God to delyuer our\r\nsoules out of the paynes of purgatori without whose prayer they sey or at\r\nlest without the popes pardon we coude neuer be deliuered thens whiche if\r\nit be true then is it good reason that we gyue theim all these thinges all\r\nwere it C times as moche, But there be many men of greate litterature and\r\niudgement that for the love they haue vnto the trouth and vnto the comen\r\nwelth haue not feared to put theim silf ynto the greatest infamie that may\r\nbe, in abiection of all the world, ye[a] in perill of deth to declare\r\ntheyre oppinion in this mather whiche is that there is no purgatory but\r\nthat it is a thing inuented by the couitousnesse of the spiritualtie onely\r\nto translate all kingdomes from other princes vnto theim and that there is\r\nnot one word spoken of hit is al holy scripture. They sey also that if\r\nthere were a purgatory And also if that the pope with his pardons for\r\nmoney may deliuer one soule thens: he may deliuer him aswel without money,\r\nif he may deliuer one, he may deliuer a thousand: yf he may deliuer a\r\nthousand he may deliuer theim all, and so destroy purgatory. And then is\r\nhe a cruell tyraunt without all charite if he kepe theim there in pryson\r\nand in paine till men will giue him money.\r\n\r\n¶ Lyke wyse saie they of all the hole sort of the spiritueltie that if\r\nthey will not pray for no man but for theim that gyue theim money they are\r\ntyrauntes and lakke charite, and suffer those soules to be punisshed and\r\npayned vncheritably for lacke of theyre prayers. These sort of folkes they\r\ncall heretikes, these they burne, these they rage ageinst, put to open\r\nshame and make theim bere fagottes. But whether they be heretikes or no,\r\nwell I wote that this purgatory and the Popes pardons is all the cause of\r\ntranslacion of your kingdome so fast into their hondes wherfore it is\r\nmanifest it can not be of christ, for he gaue more to the temporall\r\nkingdome, he hym silfe paid tribute to Cesar he toke nothing from hym but\r\ntaught that the highe powers shulde be alweys obei[e]d ye[a] he him silf\r\n(although he were most fre lorde of all and innocent) was obedient vnto\r\nthe highe powers vnto deth. This is the great scabbe why they will not let\r\nthe newe testament go a brode yn your moder tong lest men shulde espie\r\nthat they by theyre cloked ypochrisi do translate thus fast your kingdome\r\ninto theyre hondes, that they are not obedient vnto your highe power, that\r\nthey are cruell, vnclene, vnmerciful, and ypochrites, that thei seke not\r\nthe honour of Christ but their owne, that remission of sinnes are not\r\ngiuen by the popes pardon, but by Christ, for the sure feith and trust\r\nthat we haue in him. Here may your grace well perceyue that except ye\r\nsuffer theyre ypocrisie to be disclosed all is like to runne ynto theire\r\nhondes and as long as it is couered so long shall it seme to euery man to\r\nbe a greate ympiete not to gyue theim. For this I am sure your grace\r\nthinketh (as the truth is) I am as good as my father, whye may I not\r\naswell gyue theim as moche as my father did. And of this mynd I am sure\r\nare all the loordes knightes squir[e]s gentilmen and ye[o]men in englond\r\nye[a] and vntill it be disclosed all your peoole [_people_] will thinke\r\nthat your statute of mortmayne was neuer made with no good conscience\r\nseing that it taketh awey the liberte of your people in that they may not\r\nas laufully b[u]y theire soules out of purgatory by gyuing to the\r\nspiritualte as their predecessours did in tymes passed.\r\n\r\n¶ wherfore if ye will eschewe the ruyne of your crowne and dignitie let\r\ntheir ypocrisye be vttered and that shalbe more spedfull in this mater\r\nthen all the lawes that may be made be they never so stronge. For to make\r\na lawe for to punisshe eny offender except it were more fit to giue other\r\nmen an ensample to beware to committe suche like offence, whate shuld yt\r\nauayle. Did not doctour Alyn most presumptuously nowe yn your tyme ageynst\r\nall this allegiaunce all that ever he coude to pull from you the knowledge\r\nof suche plees as [be]long vnto your hyghe courtes vnto an other court in\r\nderogacion of your crowne and dignite? Did not also doctor Horsey and his\r\ncomplices most heynously as all the world knoweth murdre in pryson that\r\nhonest marchaunt Richard hunne? For that he sued your writ of premunire\r\nagainst a prest that wrongfully held him in ple[a] in a spirituall court\r\nfor a mater wherof the knowlege belonged vnto your hyghe courtes. And\r\nwhate punisshement was there done that eny man may take example of to be\r\nware of lyke offence? truely none but that the one payd fiue hundreth\r\npoundes (as it is said to the b[u]ildinge of your sterre chamber) and when\r\nthat payment was ones passed the capteyns of his kingdome (because he\r\nfaught so manfully ageynst your crowne and dignitie) haue heped to him\r\nbenefice vpon benefice so that he is rewarded tenne tymes as moche. The\r\nother as it is seid payde sixe hundreth poundes for him and his complices\r\nwhiche forbicause that he had lyke wyse faught so manfully ageynst your\r\ncrowne and dignite was ymmediatly (as he had opteyned your most gracyous\r\npardon) promoted by the capiteynes of his kingdome with benefice vpon\r\nbenefice to the value of. iiij. tymes as moche. who can take example of\r\nthis punisshement to be ware of suche like offence? who is he of theyre\r\nkingdome that will not rather take courage to committe lyke offence seying\r\nthe promocions that fill [_fell_] to this [_these_] men for theyre so\r\noffending. So weke and blunt is your swerde to strike at one of the\r\noffenders of this cro[o]ked and peruers generacyon.\r\n\r\n¶ And this is by the reason that the chief instrument of youre lawe ye[a]\r\nthe chief of your counsell and he whiche hath youre swerde in his hond to\r\nwhome also all the other instrumentes are obedient is alweys a spirituell\r\nman whiche hath euer suche an inordinate loue vnto his owne kingdome that\r\nhe will mainteyn that, though all the temporall kingdoms and comonwelth[s]\r\nof the worlde shulde therfore vtterly be vndone, Here leue we out the\r\ngretest mater of all lest that we declaring suche an horrible carayn of\r\neuyll ageinst the ministres of iniquite shulde seme to declare the one\r\nonely faute or rather the ignoraunce of oure best beloued ministre of\r\nrightousnesse whiche is to be hid till he may be lerned by these small\r\nenormitees that we haue spoken of to knowe it pleynly him silf. But whate\r\nremedy to releue vs your poore sike lame and sore bedemen? To make many\r\nhospitals for the relief of the poore people? Nay truely. The moo the\r\nworse, for euer the fatte of the hole foundacion hangeth on the prestes\r\nberdes. Dyuers of your noble predecessours kinges of this realme haue\r\ngyuen londes to monasteries to giue a certein somme of money yerely to the\r\npoore people wherof for the aunciente of the tyme they giue neuer one\r\npeny, They haue lyke wyse giuen to them to haue a certeyn masses said\r\ndaily for theim wherof they sey neuer one. If the Abbot of westminster\r\nshulde sing euery day as many masses for his founders as he is bounde to\r\ndo by his foundacion. M, monkes were to[o] fewe. wherfore if your grace\r\nwill bilde a sure hospitall that neuer shall faile to releue vs all your\r\npoore bedemen, so take from theim all these thynges. Set these sturdy\r\nlobies a brode in the world to get theim wiues of theire owne, to get\r\ntheire liuing with their laboure in the swete of theire faces according to\r\nthe commaundement of god. Gene. iij. to gyue other idell people by theire\r\nexample occasion to go to laboure. Tye these holy idell theues to the\r\ncartes to be whipped naked about euery market towne til they will fall to\r\nlaboure that they by theyre importunate begging take not awey the almesse\r\nthat the good christen people wolde giue vnto vs sore impotent miserable\r\npeople your bedemen. Then shall aswell the nombre of oure forsaid\r\nmonstruous sort as of the baudes, hores, theues, and idell people\r\ndecreace. Then shall these great yerely exaccions cease. Then shall not\r\nyoure swerde, power, crowne, dignite, and obedience of your people, be\r\ntranslated from you. Then shall you haue full obedience of your people.\r\nThen shall the idell people be set to worke. Then shall matrimony be moche\r\nbetter kept. Then shal the generation of your people be encreased, Then\r\nshall your comons encrease in richnesse. Then shall the gospell be\r\npreached. Then shall none begge oure almesse from vs. Then shal we haue\r\nynough and more then shall suffice vs, whiche shall be the best hospitall\r\nthat euer was founded for vs, Then shall we daily pray to god for your\r\nmost noble estate long to endure.\r\n\r\n      Domine saluum fac regem.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNWIN BROTHERS, THE GRESHAM PRESS, CHILWORTH AND LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The OLD SERIES_\r\n\r\nWill represent the following classes of books:--\r\n\r\na Early printed translations from the Classics, as those by J.
