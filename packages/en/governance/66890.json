Pension Commissioner_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to place this volume in the hands of every American\r\ncitizen I feel profoundly convinced there would follow an uplift toward\r\nright-living and right-thinking which would affect the destiny of our\r\nrace more than anything which has yet occurred in our history.\r\n\r\nThere is here presented a fearless expression of views upon the\r\nparamount problems of the age, social, economic and political, by a\r\ncitizen who has been exalted to the highest office in the\r\nworld—expressions of opinion made upon many occasions during his term of\r\nPresidency. But it is an unparalleled spectacle to see a man who has\r\nrisen to such greatness dare to discuss some of the questions which are\r\nhere treated, and still more rare to find them handled with such great\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nI ask the reader to go a little deeper than a mere reading of these\r\nvaried subjects of such vital moment to him; that he permit his mind to\r\nbe receptive of the powerful and subtle influences which run like a holy\r\npattern through the woof and warp of the whole design.\r\n\r\nHere are the eternal truths limned in a new light by one of the most\r\nforceful personalities of the day. It is true that the views expressed\r\nhere are held by a large proportion of our citizens who will rejoice to\r\nfind what they have long felt so cogently expressed by an exemplar of\r\nwhat he preaches, who adds to the simple truths he has been inspired to\r\nexpound, the dignity of the high office he holds—the highest that has\r\nbeen attained by man since the dawn of the world—that of the Presidency\r\nof the new and dominant race of the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nI bespeak of every reader the kindness of doing whatever lies in his\r\npower to make known to his fellow citizens this volume; speak of it\r\nwhenever you can; or, still better, present a volume to any friend who\r\nhas your sincerest good wishes.\r\n\r\n                                                          HORACE MARKLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“_We must treat each man on his worth and merits as a man. We must see\r\nthat each is given a square deal, because he is entitled to no more and\r\nshould receive no less._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                                 Ideals\r\n                                   of\r\n                              Citizenship\r\n\r\n\r\nMankind goes ahead but slowly, and it goes ahead mainly through each of\r\nus trying to do the best that is in him and to do it in the sanest way.\r\nWe have founded our Republic upon the theory that the average man will,\r\nas a rule, do the right thing, that in the long run the majority will\r\ndecide for what is sane and wholesome. If our fathers were mistaken in\r\nthat theory, if ever the times become such—not occasionally but\r\npersistently—that the mass of the people do what is unwholesome, what is\r\nwrong, then the Republic cannot stand, I care not how good its laws, I\r\ncare not what marvelous mechanism its Constitution may embody. Back of\r\nthe laws, back of the administration, back of the system of government\r\nlies the man, lies the average manhood of our people, and in the long\r\nrun we are going to go up or go down accordingly as the average standard\r\nof citizenship does or does not wax in growth and grace.\r\n\r\n¶¶The first requisite of good citizenship is that the man shall do the\r\nhomely, every-day, hum-drum duties well. A man is not a good citizen, I\r\ndo not care how lofty his thoughts are about citizenship in the\r\nabstract, if in the concrete his actions do not bear them out; and it\r\ndoes not make much difference how high his aspirations for mankind at\r\nlarge may be, if he does not behave well in his own family those\r\naspirations do not bear visible fruit. He must be a good breadwinner, he\r\nmust take care of his wife and his children, he must be a neighbor whom\r\nhis neighbors can trust, he must act squarely in his business\r\nrelations,—he must do all these every-day, ordinary duties first, or he\r\nis not a good citizen. But he must do more.\r\n\r\n¶In this country of ours the average citizen must devote a good deal of\r\nthought and time to the affairs of the State as a whole or those affairs\r\nwill go backward; and he must devote that thought and time steadily and\r\nintelligently. If there is any one quality that is not desirable,\r\nwhether in a nation or in an individual, it is hysterics, either in\r\nreligion or anything else. The man or woman who makes up for ten days’\r\nindifference to duty by an eleventh-day morbid repentance about that\r\nduty is of scant use in the world. Now in the same way it is of no\r\npossible use to decline to go through all ordinary duties of citizenship\r\nfor a long space of time and then suddenly to get up and feel very angry\r\nabout something or somebody, not clearly defined, and demand reform, as\r\nif it was a concrete substance to be handed out forthwith.[4]\r\n\r\n¶We cannot keep too clearly before our minds the facts that for the\r\nsuccess of our civilization what is needed is not so much brilliant\r\nability, not so much unusual genius, as the possession by the average\r\nman of the plain, homely, work-a-day virtues that make that man a good\r\nfather, a good husband, and a good friend and neighbor—a decent man with\r\nwhom to deal in all relations of life.\r\n\r\n¶We need good laws, we need honest administration of the laws, and we\r\ncannot afford to be contented with less, but more than aught else we\r\nneed that the average man shall have in him the root of righteous\r\nliving; that the average man shall have in him the feeling that will\r\nmake him ashamed to do wrong or to submit to wrong, and that will make\r\nhim feel his bounden duty to help those that are weaker, to help those\r\nespecially that are in a way dependent upon him, and while not in any\r\nway losing his power of individual initiative, to cultivate without\r\nceasing the further power of acting in combination with his fellows for\r\na common end of social uplifting and of good government.\r\n\r\n¶One word upon success in life, upon the success that each of us should\r\nstrive for. It is a great mistake—oh, such a great mistake—to measure\r\nsuccess merely by that which glitters from without, or to speak of it in\r\nterms which will mislead those about us, and especially the younger\r\npeople about us, as to what success really is.\r\n\r\n¶There must of course be for success, a certain material basis, I should\r\nthink ill of any man who did not wish to leave his children a little\r\nbetter and not a little worse off materially than he was, and I should\r\nnot feel that he was doing his duty by them; and if he cannot do his\r\nduty by his own children he is not going to do his duty by any one else.\r\n\r\n¶But after that certain amount of material prosperity has been gained\r\nthen the things that really count most are the things of the soul rather\r\nthan the things of money, and I am sure that each of you if he will\r\nreally think of what it is that made him most happy, of what it is that\r\nmade him most respect his neighbors will agree with me.\r\n\r\n¶¶Look back in your own lives, see what the things are that you are\r\nproudest of as you look back, and you will in almost every case and on\r\nevery occasion find that those memories of pride are associated, not\r\nwith days of ease, but with days of effort, the day when you had to do\r\nall that was in you for some worthy end, and the worthiest of all worthy\r\nends is to make those that are closest and nearest to you—your wife and\r\nyour children, and those near you—happy and not sorry that you are\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n¶And after that has been done, to be able so to handle yourself that you\r\ncan feel when the end comes that on the whole your community, your\r\nfellow men, are a little better off and not a little worse off because\r\nyou have lived.\r\n\r\n¶This kind of success is open to every one of us. The great prizes come\r\nmore or less by accident, and no human being knows that better than any\r\nman who has won one of them. The great prizes come more or less by\r\naccident, but to each man there comes normally the chance so to lead his\r\nlife that at the end of his days his children, his wife, those that are\r\ndear to him shall rise up and call him blessed, and so that his\r\nneighbors and those who have been brought into intimate association with\r\nhim, may feel that he has done his part as a man in a world which sadly\r\nneeds that each man should play his part well.[1]\r\n\r\n¶¶Treat each man according to his worth as a man. Don’t hold for or\r\nagainst him that he is either rich or poor. But if he is rich and\r\ncrooked, hold it against him; if not rich but crooked, then hold it\r\nagainst him. But if he is a square man, stand by him. Distrust all who\r\nwould have any one class placed before any other. Other republics have\r\nfallen because of the unscrupulous rich or the unscrupulous poor who\r\ngained ascendancy, who substituted loyalty to class for loyalty to the\r\npeople as a whole.\r\n\r\n¶Abolish the insolence and arrogance of the rich who look down upon the\r\npoor; if they lost their wealth they would be ready to plunder the rich.\r\nThe unscrupulous man who becomes rich would oppress the poor. The man\r\nwho is true to you is ultimately righteous, and the man who will steal\r\nfor you will steal from you. The man who will seek to persuade you that\r\nhe will benefit you by wronging any one else will wrong you when it will\r\nbenefit him.\r\n\r\n¶What we must do as a Nation is to stand for the immutable principles of\r\ndecency and virtue, regarding vice with abhorrence. If we make any\r\nartificial divisions we have done irreparable injury to the people.[2]\r\n\r\n¶Let us be steadfast for the right; but let us err on the side of\r\ngenerosity rather than on the side of vindictiveness toward those who\r\ndiffer from us as to the method of attaining the right. Let us never\r\nforget our duty to help in uplifting the lowly, to shield from wrong the\r\nhumble; and let us likewise act in a spirit of the broadest and frankest\r\ngenerosity toward all our brothers, all our fellow-countrymen; in a\r\nspirit proceeding not from weakness but from strength, a spirit which\r\ntakes no more account of locality than it does of class or creed; a\r\nspirit which is resolutely bent on seeing that the Union which\r\nWashington founded and which Lincoln saved from destruction shall grow\r\nnobler and greater throughout the ages.\r\n\r\n¶I believe in this country with all my heart and soul. I believe that\r\nour people will in the end rise level to every need, will in the end\r\ntriumph over every difficulty that rises before them. I could not have\r\nsuch confident faith in the destiny of this mighty people if I had it\r\nmerely as regards one portion of that people. Throughout our land things\r\non the whole have grown better and not worse, and this is as true of one\r\npart of the country as it is of another.\r\n\r\n¶For weal or woe we are knit together and we shall go up or go down\r\ntogether; and I believe that we shall go up and not down, that we shall\r\ngo forward instead of halting and falling back, because I have an\r\nabiding faith in the generosity, the courage, the resolution, and the\r\ncommon-sense of all my countrymen.\r\n\r\n¶Fundamentally our people are the same throughout this land; the same in\r\nqualities of heart and brain and hand which have made this Republic what\r\nit is in the great to-day; which will make it what it is to be in the\r\ninfinitely greater to-morrow. All of us alike, Northerners and\r\nSoutherners, Easterners and Westerners, can best prove our fealty to the\r\nNation’s past by the way in which we do the Nation’s work in the\r\npresent; for only thus can we be sure that our children’s children shall\r\ninherit Abe Lincoln’s single-hearted devotion to the great unchanging\r\ncreed that “righteousness exalteth a nation.”[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                              The Dignity\r\n                                   of\r\n                                 Labor\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law of worthy work well done is the law of successful American life.\r\nI believe in play too—play, and play hard while you play; but don’t make\r\nthe mistake of thinking that that is the main thing. The work is what\r\ncounts, and if a man does his work well and it is worth doing, then it\r\nmatters but little in which line that work is done; the man is a good\r\nAmerican citizen. If he does his work in slipshod fashion, then no\r\nmatter what kind of work it is, he is a poor American citizen.[8]\r\n\r\n¶Among ourselves we differ in many qualities, of body, head, and heart;\r\nwe are unequally developed, mentally as well as physically. But each of\r\nus has the right to ask that he shall be protected from wrong-doing as\r\nhe does his work and carries his burden through life. No man needs\r\nsympathy because he has to work, because he has a burden to carry. Far\r\nand away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at\r\nwork worth doing; and this is a prize open to every man, for there can\r\nbe no work better worth doing than that done to keep in health and\r\ncomfort and with reasonable advantages those immediately dependent upon\r\nthe husband, the father, or the son.\r\n\r\n¶There is no room in our healthy American life for the mere idler, for\r\nthe man or the woman whose object it is throughout life to shirk the\r\nduties which life ought to bring. Life can mean nothing worth meaning,\r\nunless its prime aim is the doing of duty, the achievement of results\r\nworth achieving. A recent writer has finely said: “After all the saddest\r\nthing that can happen to a man is to carry no burdens. To be bent under\r\ntoo great a load is bad; to be crushed by it is lamentable; but even in\r\nthat there are possibilities that are glorious. But to carry no load at\r\nall—there is nothing in that. No one seems to arrive at any goal really\r\nworth reaching in this world who does not come to it heavy-laden.”\r\n\r\n¶Surely from our own experience each one of us knows that this is true.\r\nFrom the greatest to the smallest, happiness and usefulness are largely\r\nfound in the same soul, and the joy of life is won in its deepest and\r\ntruest sense only by those who have not shirked life’s burdens. The men\r\nwhom we most delight to honor in all this land are those who, in the\r\niron years from ’61 to ’65, bore on their shoulders the burden of saving\r\nthe Union. They did not choose the easy task. They did not shirk the\r\ndifficult duty. Deliberately and of their own free will they strove for\r\nan ideal, upward and onward across the stony slopes of greatness. They\r\ndid the hardest work that was then to be done; they bore the heaviest\r\nburden that any generation of Americans ever had to bear; and because\r\nthey did this they have won such proud joy as it has fallen to the lot\r\nof no other men to win, and have written their names forever more on the\r\ngolden honor roll of the Nation.\r\n\r\n¶As it is with the soldier, so it is with the civilian. To win success\r\nin the business world, to become a first class mechanic, a successful\r\nfarmer, an able lawyer or doctor, means that the man has devoted his\r\nbest energy and power through long years to the achievement of his ends.\r\nSo it is in the life of the family, upon which in the last analysis the\r\nwhole welfare of the Nation rests. The man or woman who as breadwinner\r\nand home-maker, or as wife and mother, has done all that he or she can\r\ndo, patiently and uncomplainingly, is to be honored; and is to be envied\r\nby all those who have never had the good fortune to feel the need and\r\nduty of doing such work.\r\n\r\n¶The woman who has borne, and who has reared as they should be reared, a\r\nfamily of children, has in the most emphatic manner deserved well of the\r\nRepublic. Her burden has been heavy, and she has been able to bear it\r\nworthily only by the possession of resolution, of good sense, of\r\nconscience, and of unselfishness.\r\n\r\n¶¶But if she has borne it well, then to her shall come the supreme\r\nblessing, for in the words of the oldest and greatest of books, “Her\r\nchildren shall rise up and call her blessed,” and among the benefactors\r\nof the land her place must be with those who have done the best and the\r\nhardest work whether as lawgivers or as soldiers, whether in public or\r\nin private life.\r\n\r\n¶This is not a soft and easy creed to preach. It is a creed willingly\r\nlearned only by men and women who, together with their softer virtues,\r\npossess also the stronger; who can do, and dare, and die at need, but\r\nwho while life lasts will never flinch from their allotted task.... It\r\nis not enough to be well-meaning and kindly, but weak; neither is it\r\nenough to be strong, unless morality and decency go hand in hand with\r\nstrength. We must possess the qualities which make us do our duty in our\r\nhomes and among our neighbors, and in addition we must possess the\r\nqualities which are indispensable to the makeup of every great and\r\nmasterful nation—the qualities of courage and hardihood, of individual\r\ninitiative and yet of power to combine for a common end, and, above all,\r\nthe resolute determination to permit no man and no set of men to sunder\r\nus one from the other by lines of caste or creed or section.\r\n\r\n¶We must act upon the motto of all for each and each for all.\r\n\r\n¶There must be ever present in our minds the fundamental truth that in a\r\nRepublic such as ours the only safety is to stand neither for nor\r\nagainst any man because he is rich or because he is poor, because he is\r\nengaged in one occupation or another, because he works with his brains\r\nor because he works with his hands. We must treat each man on his worth\r\nand merits as a man. We must see that each is given a square deal,\r\nbecause he is entitled to no more and should receive no less. Finally we\r\nmust ever keep in mind that a Republic such as ours can exist only by\r\nvirtue of the orderly liberty which comes through the equal domination\r\nof the law over all men alike, and through its administration in such\r\nresolute and fearless fashion as shall teach all that no man is above it\r\nand no man below it.[11]\r\n\r\n¶In our present advanced civilization we have to pay certain penalties\r\nfor what we have obtained. Among the penalties is the fact that in very\r\nmany occupations there is so little demand upon nerve, hardihood, and\r\nendurance, that there is a tendency to unhealthy softening of fibre and\r\nrelaxation of fibre; and such being the case I think it is a fortunate\r\nthing for our people as a whole that there should be certain\r\noccupations, prominent among them railroading, in which the man has to\r\nshow the very qualities of courage, of hardihood, of willingness to face\r\ndanger, the cultivation of the power of instantaneous decision under\r\ndifficulties, and the other qualities which go to make up the virile\r\nside of a man’s character.... These qualities are all-important, but\r\nthey are not all-sufficient. It is necessary absolutely to have them. No\r\nnation can rise to greatness without them, but by them alone no nation\r\nwill ever become great.\r\n\r\n¶Reading through the pages of history you come upon nation after nation\r\nin which there has been a high average of individual strength, bravery,\r\nand hardihood, and yet in which there has been nothing approaching to\r\nnational greatness because those qualities were not supplemented by\r\nothers just as necessary. With the courage, with the hardihood, with the\r\nstrength, must come the power of self-restraint, the power of\r\nself-mastery, the capacity to work for and with others as well as for\r\none’s self, the power of giving to others the love which each of us must\r\nbear for his neighbor, if we are to make our civilization great.... We\r\nneed then, the two qualities—work and love, using each in its broadest\r\nsense—work, the quality which makes a man ashamed not to be able to pull\r\nhis own weight, not to be able to do for himself as well as for others\r\nwithout being beholden to any one for what he is doing.\r\n\r\n¶¶No man is happy if he does not work. Of all miserable creatures the\r\nidler, in whatever rank of society, is in the long run the most\r\nmiserable. If a man does not work, if he has not in him not merely the\r\ncapacity for work but the desire for work, then nothing can be done with\r\nhim. He is out of place in our community. We have in our scheme of\r\ngovernment no room for the man who does not wish to pay his way through\r\nlife by what he does for himself and for the community. If he has\r\nleisure which makes it unnecessary for him to devote his time to earning\r\nhis daily bread, then all the more he is bound to work just as hard in\r\nsome way that will make the community the better off for his existence.\r\nIf he fails in that, he fails to justify his existence.\r\n\r\n¶¶¶Work, the capacity for work, is absolutely necessary; and no man’s\r\nlife is full, no man can be said to live in the true sense of the word,\r\nif he does not work. This is necessary; and yet it is not enough. If a\r\nman is utterly selfish, if utterly disregardful of the rights of others,\r\nif he has no ideals, if he works simply for the sake of ministering to\r\nhis own base passions, if he works simply to gratify himself, small is\r\nhis good in the community. I think even then he is probably better off\r\nthan if he is an idler, but he is of no real use unless together with\r\nthe quality which enables him to work he has the quality which enables\r\nhim to love his fellows, to work with them and for them for the common\r\ngood of all.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                                  The\r\n                               Workingman\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the sole exception of the farming interest, no one matter is of\r\nsuch vital moment to our whole people as the welfare of the\r\nwage-workers. If the farmer and the wage-worker are well off, it is\r\nabsolutely certain that all others will be well off too. It is therefore\r\na matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wages are higher\r\nto-day in the United States than ever before. The standard of living is\r\nalso higher than ever before in our history, and far higher than in any\r\nother country. Every effort of legislator and administrator should be\r\nbent to secure the permanency of this condition of things and its\r\nimprovement wherever possible. Not only must our labor be protected by\r\nthe tariff, but it should also be protected so far as it is possible\r\nfrom the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by\r\ncontract, or of those who, coming freely, yet represent a standard of\r\nliving so depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market\r\nand drag them to a lower level. I regard it as necessary, with this end\r\nin view, to reenact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and\r\nto strengthen it wherever necessary in order to make its enforcement\r\nentirely effective.\r\n\r\n¶American wage-workers work with their heads as well as their hands.\r\nMoreover, they take a keen pride in what they are doing; so that,\r\nindependent of the reward, they wish to turn out a perfect job. This is\r\nthe great secret of success in competition with the labor of foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n¶¶When all is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as the\r\nindispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life for\r\nwhich we strive. Each man must work for himself, and unless he so works\r\nno outside help can avail him; but each man must remember also that he\r\nis indeed his brother’s keeper, and that while no man who refuses to\r\nwalk can be carried with advantage to himself or any one else, yet that\r\neach at times stumbles or halts, that each at times needs to have the\r\nhelping hand outstretched to him. To be permanently effective, aid must\r\nalways take the form of helping a man to help himself; and we can all\r\nbest help ourselves by joining together in the work that is of common\r\ninterest to all.[7]\r\n\r\n¶How to secure fair treatment alike for labor and for capital, how to\r\nhold in check the unscrupulous man, whether employer or employee,\r\nwithout weakening individual initiative, without hampering and cramping\r\nthe industrial development of the country, is a problem fraught with\r\ngreat difficulties and one which it is of the highest importance to\r\nsolve on lines of sanity and far-sighted common-sense as well as of\r\ndevotion to the right. Exactly as business men find they must often work\r\nthrough corporations, and as it is a constant tendency of these\r\ncorporations to grow larger, so it is often necessary for laboring men\r\nto work in federations, and these have become important factors of\r\nmodern industrial life. Both kinds of federation, capitalistic and\r\nlabor, can do much good, and as a necessary corollary they can both do\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n¶Opposition to each kind of organization should take the form of\r\nopposition to whatever is bad in the conduct of any given corporation or\r\nunion—not of attacks upon corporations as such nor upon unions as such;\r\nfor some of the most far-reaching beneficent work for our people has\r\nbeen accomplished through both corporations and unions. Each must\r\nrefrain from arbitrary or tyrannous interference with the rights of\r\nothers. Organized capital and organized labor alike should remember that\r\nin the long run the interest of each must be brought into harmony with\r\nthe interest of the general public; and the conduct of each must conform\r\nto the fundamental rules of obedience to the law, of individual freedom,\r\nand of justice and fair-dealing toward all. Each should remember that in\r\naddition to power it must strive after the realization of healthy,\r\nlofty, and generous ideals.\r\n\r\n¶Every employer, every wage-worker, must be guaranteed his liberty and\r\nhis right to do as he likes with his property or his labor so long as he\r\ndoes not infringe upon the rights of others. It is of the highest\r\nimportance that employer and employee alike should endeavor to\r\nappreciate each the view-point of the other and the sure disaster that\r\nwill come upon both in the long run if either grows to take as habitual\r\nan attitude of sour hostility and distrust toward the other.\r\n\r\n¶Few people deserve better of the country than those representatives of\r\nboth capital and labor—and there are many such—who work continually to\r\nbring about a good understanding of this kind, based upon wisdom and\r\nupon broad and kindly sympathy between employers and employed. Above\r\nall, we need to remember that any kind of class animosity in the\r\npolitical world is, if possible, even more destructive to national\r\nwelfare, than sectional, race, or religious animosity. We can get good\r\ngovernment only upon condition that we keep true to the principles upon\r\nwhich this Nation was founded, and judge each man not as a part of a\r\nclass, but upon his individual merits.\r\n\r\n¶All that we have a right to ask of any man, rich or poor, whatever his\r\ncreed, his occupation, his birthplace, or his residence, is that he\r\nshall act well and honorably by his neighbor and by his country. We are\r\nneither for the rich man as such nor for the poor man as such; we are\r\nfor the upright man, rich and poor. So far as the constitutional powers\r\nof the National Government touch these matters of general and vital\r\nmoment to the Nation, they should be exercised in conformity with the\r\nprinciples above set forth.[9]\r\n\r\n¶The consistent policy of the National Government, so far as it has the\r\npower, is to hold in check the unscrupulous man, whether employer or\r\nemployee; but to refuse to weaken individual initiative or to hamper or\r\ncramp the industrial development of the country. We recognize that this\r\nis an era of federation and combination, in which great capitalistic\r\ncorporations and labor unions have become factors of tremendous\r\nimportance in all industrial centers. Hearty recognition is given the\r\nfar-reaching, beneficent work which has been accomplished through both\r\ncorporations and unions, and the line as between different corporations,\r\nas between different unions, is drawn on conduct, the effort being to\r\ntreat both organized capital and organized labor alike; asking nothing\r\nsave that the interest of each shall be brought into harmony with the\r\ninterest of the general public, and that the conduct of each shall\r\nconform to the fundamental rules of obedience to law, of individual\r\nfreedom, and of justice and fair-dealing towards all.\r\n\r\n¶Whenever either corporation, labor union, or individual disregards the\r\nlaw or acts in a spirit of arbitrary and tyrannous interference with the\r\nrights of others, whether corporations or individuals, then, where the\r\nFederal Government has jurisdiction, it will see to it that the\r\nmisconduct is stopped, paying not the slightest heed to the position or\r\npower of the corporation, the union, or the individual, but only to one\r\nvital fact—that is, the question whether or not the conduct of the\r\nindividual or aggregate of individuals is in accordance with the law of\r\nthe land. Every man must be guaranteed his liberty and his right to do\r\nas he likes with his property or his labor, so long as he does not\r\ninfringe the rights of others. No man is above the law and no man is\r\nbelow it; nor do we ask any man’s permission when we require him to obey\r\nit. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as a\r\nfavor.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                              Labor Unions\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe emphatically in organized labor. I believe in organizations of\r\nwage-workers. Organization is one of the laws of our social and economic\r\ndevelopment at this time. But I feel that we must always keep before our\r\nminds the fact that there is nothing sacred in the name itself. To call\r\nan organization an organization does not make it a good one. The worth\r\nof an organization depends upon its being handled with the courage, the\r\nskill, the wisdom, the spirit of fair-dealing as between man and man.[8]\r\n\r\n¶It is no easy matter to work out a system or rule of conduct, whether\r\nwith or without the help of the lawgiver, which shall minimize that\r\njarring and clashing of interests in the industrial world which causes\r\nso much individual irritation and suffering at the present day, and\r\nwhich at times threatens baleful consequences to large portions of the\r\nbody politic. But the importance of the problem can not be\r\noverestimated, and it deserves to receive the careful thought of all\r\nmen. There should be no yielding to wrong; but there should most\r\ncertainly be not only desire to do right, but a willingness each to try\r\nto understand the view-point of his fellow, with whom, for weal or for\r\nwoe, his own fortunes are indissolubly bound.\r\n\r\n¶No patent remedy can be devised for the solution of these grave\r\nproblems in the industrial world; but we may rest assured that they can\r\nbe solved at all only if we bring to the solution certain old-time\r\nvirtues, and if we strive to keep out of the solution some of the most\r\nfamiliar and most undesirable of the traits to which mankind has owed\r\nuntold degradation and suffering throughout the ages. Arrogance,\r\nsuspicion, brutal envy of the well-to-do, brutal indifference toward\r\nthose who are not well-to-do, the hard refusal to consider the rights of\r\nothers, the foolish refusal to consider the limits of beneficent action,\r\nthe base appeal to the spirit of selfish greed, whether it take the form\r\nof plunder of the fortunate or of oppression of the unfortunate—from\r\nthese and from all kindred vices this Nation must be kept free if it is\r\nto remain in its present position in the forefront of the peoples of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n¶On the other hand, good will come, even out of the present evils, if we\r\nface them armed with the old homely virtues; if we show that we are\r\nfearless of soul, cool of head, and kindly of heart; if, without\r\nbetraying the weakness that cringes before wrong-doing, we yet show by\r\ndeeds and words our knowledge that in such a government as ours each of\r\nus must be in very truth his brother’s keeper.[20]\r\n\r\n¶In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employee\r\ninterested, but also a third party—the general public. Every\r\nconsiderable labor difficulty in which interstate commerce is involved\r\nshould be investigated by the Government and the facts officially\r\nreported to the public.\r\n\r\n¶Very much of our effort in reference to labor matters should be by\r\nevery device and expedient to try to secure a constant better\r\nunderstanding between employer and employee. Everything possible should\r\nbe done to increase the sympathy and fellow-feeling between them, and\r\nevery chance taken to allow each to look at all questions, especially at\r\nquestions in dispute, somewhat through the other’s eyes. If met with a\r\nsincere desire to act fairly by one another, and if there is,\r\nfurthermore, power by each to appreciate the other’s standpoint, the\r\nchance for trouble is minimized. I suppose every thinking man rejoices\r\nwhen by mediation or arbitration it proves possible to settle troubles\r\nin time to avert the suffering and bitterness caused by strikes.\r\nMoreover, a conciliation committee can do best work when the trouble is\r\nin its beginning, or at least has not come to a head. When the break has\r\nactually occurred, damage has been done, and each side feels sore and\r\nangry; and it is difficult to get them together—difficult to make either\r\nforget its own wrongs and remember the rights of the other. If possible\r\nthe effort at conciliation or mediation or arbitration should be made in\r\nthe earlier stages, and should be marked by the wish on the part of both\r\nsides to try and come to a common agreement which each shall think in\r\nthe interests of the other as well as of itself.[15]\r\n\r\n¶The question of securing a healthy, self-respecting, and mutually\r\nsympathetic attitude as between employer and employee, capitalist and\r\nwage-worker, is a difficult one. All phases of the labor problem prove\r\ndifficult when approached. But the underlying principles, the root\r\nprinciples, in accordance with which the problem must be solved are\r\nentirely simple. We can get justice and right dealing only if we put as\r\nof paramount importance the principle of treating a man on his worth as\r\na man rather than with a reference to his social position, his\r\noccupation, or the class to which he belongs. There are selfish and\r\nbrutal men in all ranks of life. If they are capitalists their\r\nselfishness and brutality may take the form of hard indifference to\r\nsuffering, greedy disregard of every moral restraint which interferes\r\nwith the accumulation of wealth, and coldblooded exploitation of the\r\nweak; or, if they are laborers, the form of laziness, of sullen envy of\r\nthe more fortunate, and of willingness to perform deeds of murderous\r\nviolence. Such conduct is just as reprehensible in one case as in the\r\nother, and all honest and farseeing men should join in warring against\r\nit wherever it becomes manifest.\r\n\r\n¶Individual capitalist and individual wage-worker, corporation and\r\nunion, are alike entitled to the protection of the law, and must alike\r\nobey the law. Moreover, in addition to mere obedience to the law, each\r\nman, if he be really a good citizen, must show broad sympathy for his\r\nneighbor and genuine desire to look at any question arising between them\r\nfrom the standpoint of that neighbor no less than from his own; and to\r\nthis end it is essential that capitalist and wage-worker should consult\r\nfreely one with the other, should each strive to bring closer the day\r\nwhen both shall realize that they are properly partners and not enemies.\r\nTo approach the questions which inevitably arise between them solely\r\nfrom the standpoint which treats each side in the mass as the enemy of\r\nthe other side in the mass is both wicked and foolish.\r\n\r\n¶In the past the most direful among the influences which have brought\r\nabout the downfall of republics has ever been the growth of the class\r\nspirit, the growth of the spirit which tends to make a man subordinate\r\nthe welfare of the public as a whole to the welfare of the particular\r\nclass to which he belongs, the substitution of loyalty to a class for\r\nloyalty to the Nation. This inevitably brings about a tendency to treat\r\neach man not on his merits as an individual, but on his position as\r\nbelonging to a certain class in the community. If such a spirit grows up\r\nin this Republic it will ultimately prove fatal to us, as in the past it\r\nhas proved fatal to every community in which it has become dominant.\r\nUnless we continue to keep a quick and lively sense of the great\r\nfundamental truth that our concern is with the individual worth of the\r\nindividual man, this Government can not permanently hold the place which\r\nit has achieved among the nations. The vital lines of cleavage among our\r\npeople do not correspond, and indeed run at right angles to, the lines\r\nof cleavage which divide occupation from occupation, which divide\r\nwage-workers from capitalists, farmers from bankers, men of small means\r\nfrom men of large means, men who live in the towns from men who live in\r\nthe country; for the vital line of cleavage is the line which divides\r\nthe honest man who tries to do well by his neighbor from the dishonest\r\nman who does ill by his neighbor. In other words, the standard we should\r\nestablish is the standard of conduct, not the standard of occupation, of\r\nmeans, or of social position.\r\n\r\n¶¶It is the man’s moral quality, his attitude toward the great questions\r\nwhich concern all humanity, his cleanliness of life, his power to do his\r\nduty toward himself and toward others, which really count; and if we\r\nsubstitute for the standard of personal judgment which treats each man\r\naccording to his merits, another standard in accordance with which all\r\nmen of one class are favored and all men of another class discriminated\r\nagainst, we shall do irreparable damage to the body politic. I believe\r\nthat our people are too sane, too self-respecting, too fit for\r\nself-government, ever to adopt such an attitude. This government is not\r\nand never shall be government by a plutocracy. This government is not\r\nand never shall be government by a mob. It shall continue to be in the\r\nfuture what it has been in the past, a government based on the theory\r\nthat each man, rich or poor, is to be treated simply and solely on his\r\nworth as a man, that all his personal and property rights are to be\r\nsafeguarded, and that he is neither to wrong others nor to suffer wrong\r\nfrom others.\r\n\r\n¶¶¶The noblest of all forms of government is self-government; but it is\r\nalso the most difficult. We who possess this priceless boon, and who\r\ndesire to hand it on to our children and our children’s children, should\r\never bear in mind the thought so finely expressed by Burke: “Men are\r\nqualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to\r\nput moral chains upon their own appetites; in proportion as they are\r\ndisposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good in preference to\r\nthe flattery of knaves. Society can not exist unless a controlling power\r\nupon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there be\r\nwithin the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal\r\nconstitution of things that men of intemperate minds can not be free.\r\nTheir passions forge their fetters.”[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                            The Business Man\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American business man is of a peculiar type; and probably the\r\nqualities of energy, daring, and resourcefulness which have given him\r\nhis prominence in the international industrial world find their highest\r\ndevelopment in the West. It is the merest truism to say that in the\r\nmodern world industrialism is the great factor in the growth of nations.\r\nMaterial prosperity is the foundation upon which every mighty national\r\nstructure must be built. Of course there must be more than this. There\r\nmust be a high moral purpose, a life of the spirit which finds its\r\nexpression in many different ways; but unless material prosperity exists\r\nalso there is scant room in which to develop the higher life.\r\n\r\n¶The productive activity of our vast army of workers, of those who work\r\nwith head or hands, is the prime cause of the giant growth of this\r\nnation. We have great natural resources but such resources are never\r\nmore than opportunities, and they count for nothing if the men in\r\npossession have not the power to take advantage of them.... In such\r\ndevelopment laws play a certain part, but individual characteristics a\r\nstill greater part. A great and successful commonwealth like ours in the\r\nlong run works under good laws, because a people endowed with honest and\r\npractical common-sense ultimately demands good laws. But no law can\r\ncreate industrial well-being, although it may foster and safeguard it.\r\n\r\n¶The prime factor in securing industrial well-being is the high average\r\nof citizenship found in the community. The best laws that the wit of man\r\ncan devise would not make a community of thriftless and idle men\r\nprosperous. No scheme of legislation or of social reform will ever work\r\ngood to the community unless it recognizes as fundamental the fact that\r\neach man’s own individual qualities must be the prime factors in his\r\nsuccess. Work in combination may help and the State can do a good deal\r\nin its own sphere, but in the long run each man must owe his success in\r\nlife to whatever of hardihood, of resolution, of common-sense, and of\r\ncapacity for lofty endeavor he has within his own soul. It is a good\r\nthing to act in combination for the common good, but it is a very\r\nunhealthy thing to let ourselves think for one moment that anything can\r\never supply the want of our own individual watchfulness and exertion.\r\n\r\n¶Yet given this high average of individual ability and invention, we\r\nmust ever keep in mind that it may be nullified by bad legislation, and\r\nthat it can be given a chance to develop under the most favorable\r\nconditions by good legislation. Probably the most important aid which\r\ncan be contributed by the National Government to the material well-being\r\nof the country is to insure its financial stability. An honest currency\r\nis the strongest symbol and expression of honest business life.\r\n\r\n¶The business world must exist largely on credit, and to credit\r\nconfidence is essential. Any tampering with the currency, no matter with\r\nwhat purpose, if fraught with the suspicion of dishonesty in result, is\r\nfatal in its effects on business prosperity. Very ignorant and primitive\r\ncommunities are continually obliged to learn the elementary truth that\r\nthe repudiation of debts is in the end ruinous to the debtors as a\r\nclass; and when communities have moved somewhat higher in the scale of\r\ncivilization they also learn that anything in the nature of a debased\r\ncurrency works similar damage. A financial system of assured honesty is\r\nthe first essential.\r\n\r\n¶Another essential for any community is perseverance in the economic\r\npolicy which for a course of years is found best fitted to its peculiar\r\nneeds. The question of combining such fixedness of economic policy as\r\nregards the tariff, while at the same time allowing for a necessary and\r\nproper readjustment of duties in particular schedules, as such\r\nreadjustment becomes a matter of pressing importance, is not an easy\r\none. It is, perhaps too much to expect that from the discussion of such\r\na question it would be possible wholly to eliminate political\r\npartisanship. Yet those who believe, as we all must when we think\r\nseriously of the subject, that the proper aim of the party system is,\r\nafter all, simply to subserve the public good, cannot but hope that\r\nwhere such partisanship on a matter of this kind conflicts with the\r\npublic good it shall at least be minimized. It is all right and\r\ninevitable that we should divide on party lines, but woe to us if we are\r\nnot Americans first and party men second![16]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                            Success in Life\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning our people have markedly combined practical\r\ncapacity for affairs with power of devotion to an ideal. The lack of\r\neither quality would have rendered the possession of the other of small\r\nvalue. Mere ability to achieve success in things concerning the body\r\nwould not have atoned for the failure to live the life of high endeavor;\r\nand, on the other hand, without a foundation of those qualities which\r\nbring material prosperity there would be nothing on which the higher\r\nlife could be built. The men of the Revolution would have failed if they\r\nhad not possessed alike devotion to liberty, and ability (once liberty\r\nhad been achieved) to show common-sense and self-restraint in its use.\r\nThe men of the great Civil War would have failed had they not possessed\r\nthe business capacity which developed and organized these resources in\r\naddition to the stern resolution to expend these resources as freely as\r\nthey expended their blood in furtherance of the great cause for which\r\ntheir hearts leaped.\r\n\r\n¶It is this combination of qualities that has made our people succeed.\r\nOther peoples have been as devoted to liberty, and yet, because of lack\r\nof hard-headed common-sense and of ability to show restraint and\r\nsubordinate individual passions for the general good, have failed so\r\nsignally in the struggle of life as to become a byword among the\r\nnations. Yet other peoples, again, have possessed all possible thrift\r\nand business capacity, but have been trampled under foot, or have played\r\na sordid and ignoble part in the world, because their business capacity\r\nwas unaccompanied by any of the lift toward nobler things which marks a\r\ngreat and generous nation. The stern but just rule of judgment for\r\nhumanity is that each nation shall be known by its fruits; and if there\r\nare no fruits, if the nation has failed, it matters but little whether\r\nit has failed through meanness of soul or through lack of robustness of\r\ncharacter. We must judge a nation by the net result of its life and\r\nactivity. And so we must judge the policies of those who at any time\r\ncontrol the destinies of a nation.[19]\r\n\r\n¶There was no patent device for securing victory by force of arms forty\r\nyears ago; and there is no patent device for securing victory for the\r\nforces of righteousness in civil life now. In each case the\r\nall-important factor was and is the character of the individual man.\r\nGood laws in the State, like a good organization in an army, are the\r\nexpressions of national character. Leaders will be developed in military\r\nand in civil life alike; and weapons and tactics change from generation\r\nto generation, as methods of achieving good government change in civic\r\naffairs; but the fundamental qualities which make for good citizenship\r\ndo not change any more than the fundamental qualities which make good\r\nsoldiers. In the long run, in the Civil War, the thing that counted for\r\nmore than aught else was the fact that the average American had the\r\nfighting edge; had within him the spirit which spurred him on through\r\ntoil and danger, fatigue and hardship, to the goal of the splendid\r\nultimate triumph. So in achieving good government the fundamental factor\r\nmust be the character of the average citizen; that average citizen’s\r\npower of hatred for what is mean and base and unlovely; his fearless\r\nscorn of cowardice, and his determination to war unyieldingly against\r\nthe dark and sordid forces of evil.[6]\r\n\r\n¶¶There are very different kinds of success. There is the success that\r\nbrings with it the seared soul—the success which is achieved by wolfish\r\ngreed and vulpine cunning—the success which makes honest men uneasy or\r\nindignant in its presence. Then there is the other kind of success—the\r\nsuccess which comes as the reward of keen insight, of sagacity, of\r\nresolution, of address, combined with unflinching rectitude of behavior,\r\npublic and private. The first kind of success may, in a sense,—and a\r\npoor sense at that—benefit the individual, but it is always and\r\nnecessarily a curse to the community; whereas the man who wins the\r\nsecond kind, as an incident of its winning, becomes a beneficiary to the\r\nwhole commonwealth.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                                The Man\r\n                               Who Counts\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to rendering service, that which counts chiefly with a\r\ncollege graduate, as with any other American citizen, is not intellect\r\nso much as what stands above mere power of body, or mere power of mind,\r\nbut must in a sense include them, and that is, character. It is a good\r\nthing to have a sound body and a better thing to have a sound mind; and\r\nbetter still to have that aggregate of virile and decent qualities which\r\nwe group together under the name of character. I said both decent and\r\nvirile qualities—it is not enough to have one or the other alone. If a\r\nman is strong in mind and body and misuses his strength then he becomes\r\nsimply a foe to the body politic, to be hunted down by all decent men;\r\nand if on the other hand he has thoroughly decent impulses but lacks\r\nstrength he is a nice man but does not count. You can do but little with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n¶In the unending strife for civic betterment, small is the use of those\r\npeople who mean well, but who mean well feebly. The man who counts is\r\nthe man who is decent and who makes himself felt as a force for decency,\r\nfor cleanliness, for civic righteousness. He must have several\r\nqualities; first and foremost, of course, he must be honest, he must\r\nhave the root of right thinking in him. That is not enough. In the next\r\nplace he must have courage; the timid good man counts but little in the\r\nrough business of trying to do well the world’s work. And finally, in\r\naddition to being honest and brave he must have common-sense. If he does\r\nnot have it, no matter what other qualities he may have, he will find\r\nhimself at the mercy of those who, without possessing his desire to do\r\nright, know only too well how to make the wrong effective.\r\n\r\n¶We can pardon the man who has had no chance in life if he does but\r\nlittle for the state, and we can count it greatly to his credit if he\r\ndoes much for the state. But upon you who have had so much rests a heavy\r\nburden to show that you are worthy of what you have received. A double\r\nresponsibility is upon you to use aright, not merely the talents that\r\nhave been given to you, but the chances you have to make much of these\r\ntalents. We have a right to expect service to the state from you in many\r\ndifferent lines: In the line of what, for lack of a better word, we will\r\ncall philanthropy; in all lines of effort for public decency.\r\n\r\n¶Remember always that the man who does a thing so that it is worth doing\r\nis always a man who does his work for the work’s sake. Somewhere in\r\nRuskin there is a sentence to the effect that the man who does a piece\r\nof work for the fee, normally does it in a second-rate way, and that the\r\nonly first-rate work is the work done by the man who does it for the\r\nsake of doing it well, who counts the deed as itself his reward. In no\r\nkind of work done for the public do you ever find the really best,\r\nexcept where you find the man who takes hold of it because he is\r\nirresistibly impelled to do it; because he wishes to do it for the sake\r\nof doing it well, not for the sake of any reward that comes afterward or\r\nin connection with it.\r\n\r\n¶Of course, that is true of almost every other walk of life; just\r\nexactly as true as it is in politics. A clergyman is not worth his salt\r\nif he finds himself bound to be a clergyman for the material reward of\r\nthat profession. Every doctor who has ever succeeded has been a man\r\nincapable of thinking of his fee when he did a noteworthy surgical\r\noperation. A scientific man, a writer, a historian, an artist, can only\r\nbe a good man of science, a first class artist, a first class writer, if\r\nhe does his work for the sake of doing it well; and this is exactly as\r\ntrue in political life, exactly as true in every form of social effort,\r\nin every kind of work done for the public at large. The man who does\r\nwork worth doing is the man who does it because he cannot refrain from\r\ndoing it, the man who feels it borne in on him to try that particular\r\njob and see if he cannot do it well. And so it is with a general in the\r\nfield. The man in the civil war who thought of any material reward for\r\nwhat he did was not among the men whose names you read now on the honor\r\nroll of American history.\r\n\r\n¶So the work that our colleges can do is to fit their graduates, to do\r\nservice; to fit the bulk of them, the men who cannot go in for the\r\nhighest type of scholarship, to do the ordinary citizen’s service for\r\nthe country; and they can fit them to do this service only by training\r\nthem in character. To train them in character means to train them not\r\nonly to possess, as they must possess, the softer and gentler virtues,\r\nbut also the virile powers of a race of vigorous men, the virtues of\r\ncourage, of honesty—not merely the honesty that refrains from doing\r\nwrong, but the honesty that wars aggressively for the right—the virtues\r\nof courage, honesty, and finally, hard common-sense.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                               Education\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts tend to become commonplace, and we tend to lose sight of their\r\nimportance when once they are ingrained into the life of the nation.\r\nAlthough we talk a good deal about what the widespread education of this\r\ncountry means, I question if many of us deeply consider its meaning.\r\nFrom the lowest grade of the public school to the highest form of\r\nuniversity training, education in this country is at the disposal of\r\nevery man, every woman, who chooses to work for and obtain it. The State\r\nhas done very much. Private benefaction has done much, very much. And\r\neach one of us who has obtained an education has obtained something for\r\nwhich he or she has not personally paid. No matter what the school, what\r\nthe university, every American who has a school training, a university\r\ntraining, has obtained something given to him outright by the State, or\r\ngiven to him by those dead or those living who were able to make\r\nprovision for that training because of the protection of the State,\r\nbecause of existence within its borders.\r\n\r\n¶Each one of us then who has an education, school or college, has\r\nobtained something from the community at large for which he or she has\r\nnot paid, and no self-respecting man or woman is content to rest\r\npermanently under such an obligation. Where the State has bestowed\r\neducation the man who accepts it must be content to accept it merely as\r\na charity unless he returns it to the State in full, in the shape of\r\ngood citizenship. I do not ask of you, good citizenship as a favor to\r\nthe State. I demand it of you as a right, and hold you recreant to your\r\nduty if you fail to give it.\r\n\r\n¶From all our citizens we have a right to expect good citizenship; but\r\nmost of all from those who have received most; most of all from those\r\nwho have had the training of body, of mind, of soul, which comes from\r\nassociation in and with a great university. From those to whom much has\r\nbeen given we have Biblical authority to expect and demand much in\r\nreturn; and the most that can be given to any man is education. I expect\r\nand demand in the name of the nation much more from you who have had\r\ntraining of the mind than from those of mere wealth. To the man of means\r\nmuch has been given, too, and much will be expected from him, and ought\r\nto be, but not as much as from you, because your possession is more\r\nvaluable than his. If you envy him I think poorly of you. Envy is merely\r\nthe meanest form of admiration, and a man who envies another admits\r\nthereby his own inferiority.\r\n\r\n¶We have a right to expect from the college-bred man, the college-bred\r\nwoman, a proper sense of proportion, a proper sense of perspective,\r\nwhich will enable him or her to see things in their right relation one\r\nto another, and when thus seen while wealth will have a proper place, a\r\njust place, as an instrument for achieving happiness and power, for\r\nconferring happiness and power, it will not stand as high as much else\r\nin our national life. I ask you to take that not as a conventional\r\nstatement from the university platform, but to test it by thinking of\r\nthe men whom you admire in our past history and seeing what are the\r\nqualities which have made you admire them, what are the services they\r\nhave rendered. For, as President Wheeler said to-day, it is true now as\r\nit ever has been true that the greatest good fortune, the greatest\r\nhonor, that can befall any man is that he shall serve, that he shall\r\nserve the nation, serve his people, serve mankind; and looking back in\r\nhistory the names that come up before us, the names to which we turn,\r\nthe names of the men of our own people which stand as shining honor\r\nmarks in our annals, the names of those men typifying qualities which\r\nrightly we should hold in reverence, are the names of the statesmen, of\r\nthe soldiers, of the poets, and after them, not abreast of them, the\r\nnames of the architects of our material prosperity also.[23]\r\n\r\n¶You, men and women, you who have had the advantages of a college\r\ntraining are not to be excused if you fail to do, not as well as, but\r\nmore than the average man outside who has not had your advantages. Every\r\nnow and then I meet (at least I meet him in the East and I dare say he\r\nis to be found here) the man who having gone through college feels that\r\nsomehow that confers upon him a special distinction which relieves him\r\nfrom the necessity of showing himself as good as his fellows. I see you\r\nrecognize the type. That man is not only a curse to the community, and\r\nincidentally to himself, but he is a curse to the cause of academic\r\neducation, the college and university training, because by his\r\ninsistence he serves as an excuse for those who like to denounce such\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n¶Your education, your training, will not confer on you one privilege in\r\nthe way of excusing you from effort or from work. All it can do, and\r\nwhat it should do, is to make you a little better fitted for such\r\neffort, for such work; and I do not care whether that is in business,\r\npolitics, in no matter what branch of endeavor, all it can do is by the\r\ntraining you have received, by the advantages you have received, to fit\r\nyou to do a little better than the average man that you meet.\r\n\r\n¶It is incumbent upon you to show that the training has had that effect.\r\nIt ought to enable you to do a little better for yourselves, and if you\r\nhave in you souls capable of a thrill of generous emotion, souls capable\r\nof understanding what you owe to your training, to your alma mater, to\r\nthe past and the present that have given you all that you have—if you\r\nhave such souls it ought to make you doubly bent upon disinterested work\r\nfor the State and the Nation.[22]\r\n\r\n¶Education may not make a man a good citizen, but most certainly\r\nignorance tends to prevent his being a good citizen. Washington was far\r\ntoo much of a patriot, had far too much love for his fellow citizen to\r\ntry to teach them that they could govern themselves unless they could\r\ndevelop a sound and enlightened public opinion. No nation can\r\npermanently retain free government unless it can retain a high average\r\nof citizenship, and there can be no such high average of citizenship\r\nwithout a high average of education, using the word in its broadest and\r\ntruest sense to include the things of the soul as well as the things of\r\nthe mind.\r\n\r\n¶School education can never supplant or take the place of\r\nself-education, still less can it in any way take the place of those\r\nrugged and manly qualities which we group under the name of character;\r\nbut it can be of enormous use in supplementing both. It is a source of\r\njust pride to every American that our people have so consistently acted\r\nin accordance with Washington’s principles of promoting institutions for\r\nthe diffusion of knowledge. There is nothing dearer to our hearts than\r\nour public school system, by which free primary education is provided\r\nfor every one within our borders.\r\n\r\n¶The higher education such as is provided by the University of\r\nPennsylvania and kindred bodies, not only confers great benefits to\r\nthose able to take advantage of it, but entails upon them corresponding\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n¶The men who founded this nation had to deal with theories of government\r\nand the fundamental principles of free institutions. We are now\r\nconcerned with a different set of questions for the Republic has been\r\nfirmly established, its principles fully tested and approved. To merely\r\npolitical issues have succeeded those of grave social and economic\r\nimportance, the solution of which demands the best efforts of the best\r\nmen. We have a right to expect that a wise and leading part in the\r\neffort to attain this solution will be taken by those who have been\r\nexceptionally blessed in the matter of obtaining an education.\r\n\r\n¶That college graduate is but a poor creature who does not feel when he\r\nhas left college that he has received something for which he owes a\r\nreturn. What he thus owes he can as a rule only pay by the way he bears\r\nhimself throughout life. It is but occasionally that a college graduate\r\ncan do much outright for his alma mater; he can best repay her by living\r\na life that will reflect credit upon her, by so carrying himself as a\r\ncitizen that men shall see that the years spent in training him have not\r\nbeen wasted.\r\n\r\n¶The educated man is entitled to no special privilege, save the\r\ninestimable privilege of trying to show that his education enables him\r\nto take the lead in striving to guide his fellows aright in the\r\ndifficult task which is set to us of the twentieth century. The problems\r\nbefore us to-day are very complex, and are widely different from those\r\nwhich the men of Washington’s generation had to face; but we can\r\novercome them surely if we approach them in the spirit which Washington\r\nand Washington’s great supporters brought to bear upon the problems of\r\ntheir day—the spirit of sanity and of courage, the spirit which combines\r\nhard common-sense with the loftiest idealism.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                           The School Teacher\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of the high school, especially during the last half\r\ncentury, has been literally phenomenal. Nothing like our present system\r\nof education was known in earlier times. No such system of popular\r\neducation for the people by the representatives of the people existed.\r\n\r\n¶It is, of course, a mere truism to say that the stability and future\r\nwelfare of our institutions of government depend upon the grade of\r\ncitizenship turned out from our public schools. And no body of public\r\nservants, no body of individuals associated in private life, are better\r\nworth the admiration and respect of all who value citizenship at its\r\ntrue worth, than the body composed of the teachers in the public schools\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of this Union. They have to deal with\r\ncitizenship in the raw and turn it out something like a finished\r\nproduct. I think that all of us who also endeavor to deal with that\r\ncitizenship in the raw in our own homes appreciate the burden of the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n¶The training given in the public schools must, of course, be not merely\r\na training in intellect, but a training in what counts for infinitely\r\nmore than intellect—a training in character. And the chief factors in\r\nthat training must be the personal equation of the teachers; the\r\ninfluence exerted, sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously, by\r\nthe man or woman who stands in so peculiar a relation to the boys and\r\ngirls under his or her care—a relation closer, more intimate, and more\r\nvital in its after-effects than any other relation save that of parent\r\nand child. Wherever a burden of that kind is laid, those who carry it\r\nnecessarily carry a great responsibility. There can be no greater. Scant\r\nshould be our patience with any man or woman doing a bit of work vitally\r\nworth doing, who does not approach it in the spirit of sincere love for\r\nthe work, and of desire to do it well for the sake of the work’s sake.\r\n\r\n¶Doubtless most of you remember the old distinction drawn between the\r\ntwo kinds of work, the work done for the sake of the fee and the work\r\ndone for the sake of the work itself. The man or woman in public or\r\nprivate life who ever works only for the sake of the reward that comes\r\noutside of the work, will in the long run do poor work. The man or woman\r\nwho does work worth doing is the man or woman who lives, who breathes\r\nthat work; with whom it is ever present in his or her soul; whose\r\nambition it is to do it well and to feel rewarded by the thought of\r\nhaving done it well. That man, that woman, puts the whole country under\r\nan obligation. As a body all those connected with the education of our\r\npeople are entitled to the heartiest praise from all lovers of their\r\ncountry, because as a body they are devoting heart and soul to the\r\nwelfare of those under them.\r\n\r\n¶It is a poor type of school nowadays that has not a good playground\r\nattached. It is not so long since, in my own city at least, this was\r\nheld as revolutionary doctrine, especially in the crowded quarters where\r\nplaygrounds were most needed. People said they didn’t need playgrounds.\r\nIt was a newfangled idea. They expected to make good citizens of the\r\nboys and girls who, when they were not in school, were put upon the\r\nstreets in the crowded quarters of New York to play at the kind of games\r\nalone that they could play at in the streets. We have passed that stage.\r\nI think we realize what a good healthy playground means to children. I\r\nthink we understand not only the effects for good upon their bodies, but\r\nfor good upon their minds. We need healthy bodies. We need to have\r\nschools physically developed.\r\n\r\n¶Sometimes you can develop character by the direct inculcation of moral\r\nprecept; a good deal more often you cannot. You develop it less by\r\nprecept than by your practice. Let it come as an incident of the\r\nassociation with you; as an incident to the general tone of the whole\r\nbody, the tone which in the aggregate we all create. Is not that the\r\nexperience of all of you, in dealing with these children in the schools,\r\nin dealing with them in the family, in dealing with them in bodies\r\nanywhere? They are quick to take the tone of those to whom they look up,\r\nand if they do not look up to you, then you can preach virtue all you\r\nwish, but the effect will be small.\r\n\r\n¶I should hold myself a poor citizen if I did not welcome the chance to\r\nwish you Godspeed in your work for yourselves and to wish you Godspeed\r\nin your work as representatives of that great public body of public\r\nschool teachers, upon the success of whose efforts to train aright the\r\nchildren of to-day depends the safety of our institutions of\r\nto-morrow.[21]\r\n\r\n¶It is not too much to say that the most characteristic work of the\r\nRepublic is that done by the educators, by the teachers, for whatever\r\nour shortcomings as a Nation may be—and we have certain shortcomings—we\r\nhave at least firmly grasped the fact that we cannot do our part in the\r\ndifficult and all-important work of self-government, that we cannot rule\r\nand govern ourselves unless we approach the task with developed minds,\r\nand with what counts for more even—with trained characters. You teachers\r\nmake the whole world your debtors.\r\n\r\n¶Of your profession this can be said with more truth than of any other\r\nprofession barring only that of the minister of the Gospel himself. If\r\nyou—you teachers—did not do your work well this Republic would not\r\nendure beyond the span of the generation.\r\n\r\n¶Moreover as an incident to your avowed work, you render some well-nigh\r\nunbelievable services to the country. For instance, you render to the\r\nRepublic the prime, the vital service of amalgamating into one\r\nhomogeneous body the children alike of those who are born here and of\r\nthose who come here from so many different lands abroad. You furnish a\r\ncommon training and common ideals for the children of the mixed peoples\r\nwho are here being fused into one nationality.\r\n\r\n¶It is in no small degree due to you and to your efforts that we of this\r\ngreat American Republic form one people instead of a group of jarring\r\npeoples. The pupils, no matter where they or their parents were born,\r\nwho are being educated in our public schools will be sure to become\r\nimbued with that mutual sympathy, that mutual respect and understanding,\r\nwhich is absolutely indispensable for the working out of the problems we\r\nas a people have before us.\r\n\r\n¶And one service you render which I regard as wholly indispensable. In\r\nour country, where altogether too much prominence is given to the mere\r\npossession of wealth, we are under heavy obligations to such a body as\r\nthis[A] which substitutes for the ideal of accumulating money the\r\ninfinitely loftier, non-materialistic ideal of devotion to work worth\r\ndoing simply for that work’s sake.\r\n\r\n¶I do not in the least underestimate the need of having material\r\nprosperity as the basis of our civilization, but I most earnestly insist\r\nthat if our civilization does not build a lofty super structure on this\r\nbasis, we can never rank among the really great peoples.[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                              The Nobility\r\n                                   of\r\n                               Parenthood\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our modern industrial civilization there are many and grave dangers\r\nto counterbalance the splendors and the triumphs. It is not a good thing\r\nto see cities grow at disproportionate speed relatively to the country;\r\nfor the small land owners, the men who own their little home, and,\r\ntherefore, to a very large extent, the men who till farms, the men of\r\nthe soil, have hitherto made the foundation of lasting National life in\r\nevery State; and, if the foundation becomes either too weak or too\r\nnarrow, the superstructure, no matter how attractive, is in imminent\r\ndanger of falling.\r\n\r\n¶¶But far more important than the question of the occupation of our\r\ncitizens is the question of how their family life is conducted. No\r\nmatter what that occupation may be, so long as there is a real home and\r\nso long as those who make up that home do their duty to one another, to\r\ntheir neighbors, and to the State, it is of minor consequence whether\r\nthe man’s trade is plied in the country or the city, whether it calls\r\nfor the work of the hands or for the work of the head.\r\n\r\n¶But the Nation is in a bad way if there is no real home, if the family\r\nis not of the right kind, if the man is not a good husband and father,\r\nif he is brutal or cowardly or selfish; if the woman has lost her sense\r\nof duty, if she is sunk in vapid self-indulgence or has let her nature\r\nbe twisted so that she prefers a sterile pseudo-intellectuality to that\r\ngreat and beautiful development of character which comes only to those\r\nwhose lives know the fulness of duty done, of effort made, and\r\nself-sacrifice undergone.\r\n\r\n¶In the last analysis the welfare of the State depends absolutely on\r\nwhether or not the average family, the average man and woman, and their\r\nchildren, represent the kind of citizenship for the foundation of a\r\ngreat Nation, and if we fail to appreciate this we fail to appreciate\r\nthe root morality upon which all healthy civilization is based.\r\n\r\n¶No piled-up wealth, no splendor of material growth, no brilliance of\r\nartistic development, will permanently avail any people unless its home\r\nlife is healthy, unless the average man possesses honesty, courage,\r\ncommon-sense, and decency; unless he works hard and is willing at need\r\nto fight hard, and unless the average woman is a good wife, a good\r\nmother, able and willing to perform the first and greatest duty of\r\nwomanhood, able and willing to bear and to bring up as they should be\r\nbrought up, healthy children, sound in body, mind and character, and\r\nnumerous enough so that the race shall increase and not decrease.\r\n\r\n¶¶There are certain old truths which will be true as long as this world\r\nendures, and which no amount of progress can alter. One of these is the\r\ntruth that the primary duty of the husband is to be the home-maker, the\r\nbreadwinner for his wife and children, and that the primary duty of the\r\nwoman is to be the helpmeet, the housewife, the mother.\r\n\r\n¶The woman should have ample educational advantages; but save in\r\nexceptional cases the man must be, and the woman need not be, and\r\ngenerally ought not to be, trained for a life long career as the family\r\nbreadwinner; and, therefore, after a certain point the training of the\r\ntwo must normally be different because the duties of the two are\r\nnormally different.\r\n\r\n¶This does not mean inequality of function, but it does mean that\r\nnormally there must be dissimilarity of function. On the whole, I think\r\nthe duty of the woman the more important, the more difficult, and the\r\nmore honorable of the two; on the whole I respect the woman who does her\r\nduty even more than I respect the man who does his.\r\n\r\n¶¶No ordinary work done by a man is either as hard or as responsible as\r\nthe work of a woman who is bringing up a family of small children; for\r\nupon her time and strength demands are made not only every hour of the\r\nday but often every hour of the night. She may have to get up night\r\nafter night to take care of a sick child, and yet must by day continue\r\nto do all her household duties as well; and if the family means are\r\nscant she must usually enjoy even her rare holidays taking her whole\r\nbrood of children with her. The birth-pangs make all men the debtors of\r\nall women.\r\n\r\n¶Above all our sympathy and regard are due to the struggling wives among\r\nthose whom Abraham Lincoln called the plain people, and whom he so loved\r\nand trusted; for the lives of these women are often led on the lonely\r\nheights of quiet, self-sacrificing heroism.\r\n\r\n¶Just as the happiest and most honorable and most useful task that can\r\nbe set any man is to earn enough for the support of his wife and family,\r\nfor the bringing up and starting in life of his children, so the most\r\nimportant, the most honorable and desirable task which can be set any\r\nwoman is to be a good and wise mother in a home marked by self-respect\r\nand mutual forbearance, by willingness to perform duty, and by refusal\r\nto sink into self-indulgence or avoid that which entails effort and\r\nself-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n¶Of course there are exceptional men and exceptional women who can do\r\nand ought to do more than this, who can lead and ought to lead great\r\ncareers of outside usefulness in addition to—not as a substitute\r\nfor—their home work; but I am not speaking of exceptions; I am speaking\r\nof the primary duties. I am speaking of the average citizens, the\r\naverage men and women who make up the Nation.\r\n\r\n¶No mother has an easy time, and most mothers have very hard times; and\r\nyet what true mother would barter her experience of joy and sorrow in\r\nexchange for a life of cold selfishness, which insists upon perpetual\r\namusement and the avoidance of care, and which often finds its fit\r\ndwelling place in some flat designed to furnish with the least possible\r\nexpenditure of effort the maximum of comfort and of luxury, but in which\r\nthere is literally no place for children?\r\n\r\n¶¶The woman who is a good wife, a good mother, is entitled to our\r\nrespect as is no one else, but she is entitled to it only because, and\r\nso long as, she is worthy of it. Effort and self-sacrifice are the law\r\nof worthy life for the man as for the woman, though neither the effort\r\nnor the self-sacrifice may be the same for the one as for the other.\r\n\r\n¶I do not in the least believe in the patient Griselda type of woman, in\r\nthe woman who submits to gross and long-continued ill-treatment, any\r\nmore than I believe in a man who tamely submits to wrongful aggression.\r\nNo wrong-doing is so abhorrent as wrong-doing by a man toward the wife\r\nand the children who should arouse every tender feeling in his nature.\r\n\r\n¶Selfishness toward them, lack of tenderness toward them, lack of\r\nconsideration for them, above all, brutality in any form toward them,\r\nshould arouse the heartiest scorn and indignation in every upright soul.\r\n\r\n¶I believe in the woman’s keeping her self-respect just as I believe in\r\nthe man’s doing so. I believe in her rights just as much as I believe in\r\nthe man’s and, indeed, a little more, and I regard marriage as a\r\npartnership in which each partner is in honor bound to think of the\r\nrights of the other as well as of his or her own.\r\n\r\n¶But I think the duties are even more important than the rights, and in\r\nthe long run, I think, that the reward is ampler and greater for duty\r\nwell done than for the insistence upon individual rights necessary\r\nthough this, too, must often be.\r\n\r\n¶¶¶Into the woman’s keeping is committed the destiny of the generation\r\nto come after us. In bringing up children mothers must remember that\r\nwhile it is essential to be loving and tender, it is no less essential\r\nto be wise and firm. Foolishness and affection must not be treated as\r\ninterchangeable terms, and besides training sons and daughters in the\r\nsofter and milder virtues mothers must seek to give them those stern and\r\nhardy qualities which in after life they will surely need.\r\n\r\n¶Some children will go wrong in spite of the best training, and some\r\nwill go right even where their surroundings are most unfortunate;\r\nnevertheless, an immense amount depends upon the family training.\r\n\r\n¶If mothers, through weakness, bring up sons to be selfish and to think\r\nonly of themselves, they will be responsible for much sadness among the\r\nwomen who are to be their wives in the future. If they let their\r\ndaughters grow up idle, perhaps under the mistaken impression that as\r\nthey have had to work hard, their daughters shall know only enjoyment,\r\nthey are preparing them to be useless to others and burdens to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n¶¶¶Teach boys and girls alike that they are not to look forward to lives\r\nspent in avoiding difficulties, but to lives spent in overcoming\r\ndifficulties. Teach them that work, for themselves and also for others,\r\nis not a curse, but a blessing. Seek to make them happy, to make them\r\nenjoy life, but seek also to make them face life with the steadfast\r\nresolution to wrest success from labor and adversity, and to do their\r\nwhole duty before God and to man. Surely she who can thus train her sons\r\nand her daughters is thrice fortunate among women.\r\n\r\n¶There are a good many people who are denied the supreme blessing of\r\nchildren, and for these we have the respect and sympathy always due to\r\nthose who, from no fault of their own, are denied any of the other great\r\nblessings of life.\r\n\r\n¶But the man or woman who deliberately foregoes these blessings, whether\r\nfrom viciousness, coldness, shallow-heartedness, self-indulgence, or\r\nmere failure to appreciate aright the difference between the\r\nall-important and the unimportant—why, such a creature merits contempt\r\nas hearty as any visited upon the soldier who runs away in battle, or\r\nupon the man who refuses to work for the support of those dependent upon\r\nhim, and who, though able-bodied, is yet content to eat in idleness the\r\nbread which others provide.\r\n\r\n¶The existence of women of this type forms one of the most unpleasant\r\nand unwholesome features of modern life. If any one is so dim of vision\r\nas to fail to see what a thoroughly unlovely creature such a woman is I\r\nwish they would read Judge Robert Grant’s novel “Unleavened Bread,”\r\nponder seriously the character of Selma, and think of the fate that\r\nwould surely overcome any nation which developed its average and typical\r\nwomen along such lines.\r\n\r\n¶Unfortunately it would be untrue to say that this type exists only in\r\nAmerican novels. That it also exists in American life is made\r\nunpleasantly evident by statistics as to the dwindling families in some\r\nlocalities. It is made evident in equally sinister fashion by the census\r\nstatistics as to divorce, which are fairly appalling; for easy divorce\r\nis now as it ever has been, a bane to any nation, a curse to society, a\r\nmenace to the home, an incitement to married unhappiness and to\r\nimmorality, an evil thing for men, and a still more hideous evil for\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n¶These unpleasant tendencies in our American life are made evident by\r\narticles such as those which I actually read not long ago in a certain\r\npaper, where a clergyman was quoted seemingly with approval, as\r\nexpressing the general American attitude when he said that the ambition\r\nof any save a very rich man should be to rear two children only, so as\r\nto give his children an opportunity “to taste a few of the good things\r\nof life.”\r\n\r\n¶This man whose profession and calling should have made him a moral\r\nteacher, actually set before others the ideal, not of training children\r\nto do their duty, not of sending them forth with stout hearts and ready\r\nminds to win triumphs for themselves and their country, not of allowing\r\nthem the opportunity and giving them the privilege of making their own\r\nplace in the world, but forsooth, of keeping the number of children so\r\nlimited that they might “taste a few good things!”\r\n\r\n¶¶The way to give a child a fair chance in life is not to bring it up in\r\nluxury, but to see that it has the kind of training that will give\r\nstrength of character. Even apart from the question of National life,\r\nand regarding only the individual interest of the children themselves,\r\nhappiness in the true sense is a hundredfold more apt to come to any\r\ngiven member of a healthy family of healthy-minded children, well\r\nbrought up, well educated, but taught that they must shift for\r\nthemselves, must win their own way, and by their own exertions make\r\ntheir own positions of usefulness, than it is apt to come to those whose\r\nparents themselves have acted on and have trained their children to act\r\non, the selfish and sordid theory that the whole end of life is “to\r\ntaste a few of the good things!”\r\n\r\n¶The intelligence of the remark is on a par with its morality, for the\r\nmost rudimentary mental process would have shown the speaker that if the\r\naverage family in which there are children contained but two children\r\nthe nation as a whole would decrease in population so rapidly that in\r\ntwo or three generations it would very deservedly be on the point of\r\nextinction, so that the people who had acted on this base and selfish\r\ndoctrine would be giving place to others with braver and more robust\r\nideals.\r\n\r\n¶Nor would such a result be in any way regrettable; for a race\r\nthat practiced such doctrine,—that is a race that practiced\r\nrace-suicide—would thereby conclusively show that it was unfit to\r\nexist, and that it had better give place to people who had not\r\nforgotten the primary laws of their being.\r\n\r\n¶To sum up, then, the whole matter is simple enough. If either a race or\r\nan individual prefers the pleasures of mere effortless ease, of\r\nself-indulgence, to the infinitely deeper, the infinitely higher\r\npleasures that come to those who know the toil and the weariness, but\r\nalso the joy, of hard duty well done, why, that race or that individual\r\nmust inevitably in the end pay the penalty of leading a life both vapid\r\nand ignoble.\r\n\r\n¶No man and no woman really worthy of the name can care for the life\r\nspent solely or chiefly in the avoidance of risk and trouble and labor.\r\nSave in exceptional cases the prizes worth having in life must be paid\r\nfor, and the life worth living must be a life of work for a worthy end,\r\nand ordinarily of work more for others than for one’s self.\r\n\r\n¶The man is but a poor creature whose effort is not rather for the\r\nbetterment of his wife and children than for himself; and as for the\r\nmother, her very name stands for loving unselfishness and\r\nself-abnegation, and, in any society fit to exist, is fraught with\r\nassociations which render it holy.\r\n\r\n¶The woman’s task is not easy—no task worth doing is easy—but in doing\r\nit, and when she has done it, there shall come to her the highest and\r\nholiest joy known to mankind; and, having done it, she shall have the\r\nreward prophesied in Scripture; for her husband and her children, yes,\r\nand all people who realize that her work lies at the foundation of all\r\nNational happiness and greatness, shall rise up and call her\r\nblessed.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                              Great Riches\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this world of ours it is practically impossible to get success of any\r\nkind on a large scale without paying something for it. The exceptions to\r\nthe rule are too few to warrant our paying heed to them, and as a rule\r\nit may be said that something must be paid as an offset for everything\r\nwe get and for everything we accomplish. This is notably true of our\r\nindustrial life.\r\n\r\n¶The problems which we of America have to face to-day are very serious,\r\nbut we will do well to remember that after all they are only part of the\r\nprice which we have to pay for the triumphs we have won, for the high\r\nposition to which we have attained. If we were a backward and stationary\r\ncountry we would not have to face these problems at all, but I think\r\nthat most of us are agreed that to be backward and stationary would be\r\naltogether too heavy a price to pay for the avoidance of the problems in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n¶There are no labor troubles where there is no work to be done by labor.\r\nThere are no troubles about corporations where the poverty of the\r\ncommunity is such that it is not worth while to form corporations. There\r\nis no difficulty in regulating railroads where the resources of a region\r\nare so few that it does not pay to build railroads. There are many\r\nexcellent people who shake their heads over the difficulties that as a\r\nNation we now have to face; but their melancholy is not warranted save\r\nin a very partial degree, for most of the things of which they complain\r\nare the inevitable accompaniments of the growth and greatness of which\r\nwe are proud.\r\n\r\n¶There is every reason why we should be vigilant in searching out what\r\nis wrong and unflinchingly resolute in striving to remedy it. But at the\r\nsame time we must not blind ourselves to what has been accomplished for\r\ngood, and above all we must not lose our heads and become either\r\nhysterical or rancorous in grappling with what is bad.\r\n\r\n¶Take such a question, for instance, as the question, or rather the\r\ngroup of questions, connected with the growth of corporations in this\r\ncountry. This growth has meant, of course, the growth of individual\r\nfortunes. Undoubtedly the growth of wealth in this country has had some\r\nvery unfortunate accompaniments, but it seems to me that much the worse\r\ndamage that people of wealth can do the rest of us is not any actual\r\nphysical harm, but the awakening in our breasts of either the mean vice\r\nof worshipping mere wealth, and the man of mere wealth, for the wealth’s\r\nsake, or the equally mean vice of viewing with rancorous envy and hatred\r\nthe men of wealth merely because they are men of wealth.\r\n\r\n¶Envy is, of course, merely a kind of crooked admiration, and we often\r\nsee the very man who in public is most intemperate in his denunciation\r\nof wealth in his private life most eager to obtain wealth, in no matter\r\nwhat fashion, and at no matter what moral cost.\r\n\r\n¶It is impossible too strongly to insist upon what ought to be the\r\npatent fact that it is not only in the interest of the people of wealth\r\nthemselves, but in our interest, in the interest of the public as a\r\nwhole, that they should be treated fairly and justly; that if they show\r\nexceptional business ability they should be given exceptional reward for\r\nthat ability.\r\n\r\n¶The tissues of our industrial fabric are interwoven in such complex\r\nfashion that what strengthens or weakens part also strengthens or\r\nweakens the whole.\r\n\r\n¶If we penalize industry we will ourselves in the end have to pay a\r\nconsiderable part of the penalty. If we make conditions such that the\r\nmen of exceptional ability are able to secure marked benefits by the\r\nexercise of that ability, then we shall ourselves benefit somewhat. It\r\nis our interest no less than our duty to treat them fairly.\r\n\r\n¶On the other hand, it is no less their interest to treat us fairly—by\r\n“us” I mean the great body of the people, the men of moderate or small\r\nfortunes, the farmers, the wage-workers, the smaller business men and\r\nprofessional men.\r\n\r\n¶The man of great means who achieves fortune by crooked methods does\r\nwrong to the whole body politic. But he not merely does wrong to, he\r\nbecomes a source of imminent danger to other men of great means; for his\r\nill-won success tends to arouse a feeling of resentment, which if it\r\nbecomes inflamed, fails to differentiate between the men of wealth who\r\nhave done decently and the men of wealth who have not done decently.\r\n\r\n¶The conscience of our people has been deeply shocked by the revelations\r\nmade of recent years as to the way in which some of the great fortunes\r\nhave been obtained and used, and there is, I think, in the minds of the\r\npeople at large a strong feeling that a serious effort must be made to\r\nput a stop to the cynical dishonesty and contempt for right which have\r\nthus been revealed.\r\n\r\n¶I believe that something, and I hope that a good deal, can be done by\r\nlaw to remedy the state of things complained of. But when all that can\r\nbe has thus been done, there will yet remain much which the law cannot\r\ntouch, and which must be reached by the force of public opinion.\r\n\r\n¶There are men who do not divide actions merely into those that are\r\nhonest and those that are not, but create a third subdivision—that of\r\nlaw honesty; of that kind of honesty which consists in keeping clear of\r\nthe penitentiary. It is hard to reach astute men of this type save by\r\nmaking them feel the weight of an honest public indignation.\r\n\r\n¶We can not afford in this country to draw the distinction as between\r\nrich man and poor man. The distinction upon which we must insist is the\r\nvital, deep-lying, unchangeable distinction between the honest man and\r\nthe dishonest man, between the man who acts decently and fairly by his\r\nneighbor and with a quick sense of his obligations, and the man who\r\nacknowledges no internal law save that of his own will and appetite.\r\nAbove all we should treat with a peculiarly contemptuous abhorrence the\r\nman who in a spirit of sheer cynicism debauches either our business life\r\nor our political life.\r\n\r\n¶There are men who use the word “practical politics” as merely a\r\neuphemism for dirty politics, and it is such men who have brought the\r\nword “politician” into discredit. There are other men who use the\r\nnoxious phrase “business is business” as an excuse and justification for\r\nevery kind of mean and crooked work, and these men make honest Americans\r\nhang their heads because of some of the things they do.\r\n\r\n¶It is the duty of every honest patriot to rebuke in emphatic fashion\r\nalike the politician who does not understand that the only kind of\r\n“practical politics” which a nation can with safety tolerate is that\r\nkind which we know as clean politics, and that we are as severe in our\r\ncondemnation of the business trickery which succeeds as of the business\r\ntrickery which fails. The scoundrel who fails can never by any\r\npossibility be as dangerous to the community as the scoundrel who\r\nsucceeds, and of all the men in the country the worst citizens, those\r\nwho should excite in our minds the most contemptuous abhorrence, are the\r\nmen who have achieved great wealth, or any other form of success, in any\r\nsave a clean and straightforward manner.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                               The Farmer\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions have changed in the country far less than they have changed\r\nin the cities, and in consequence there has been little breaking away\r\nfrom the methods of life which have produced the great majority of the\r\nleaders of the Republic in the past. Almost all our great Presidents\r\nhave been brought up in the country, and most of them worked hard on the\r\nfarms in their youth and got their early mental training in the healthy\r\ndemocracy of farm life.\r\n\r\n¶The forces which made these farm bred boys leaders of men when they had\r\ncome to their full manhood are still at work in our country districts.\r\nSelf-help and individual initiative remain to a peculiar degree typical\r\nof life in the country, life on a farm, in a lumbering camp, on a ranch.\r\nNeither the farmers nor their hired hands can work through combinations\r\nas readily as the capitalists or wage-workers of cities can work.\r\n\r\n¶It must not be understood from this that there has been no change in\r\nfarming and farm life. The contrary is the case. There has been much\r\nchange, much progress. The granges and similar organizations, the\r\nfarmers’ institutes, and all the agencies which promote intelligent\r\nco-operation and give opportunity for social and intellectual\r\nintercourse among the farmers, have played a large part in raising the\r\nlevel of life and work in the country districts.\r\n\r\n¶In the domain of government, the Department of Agriculture since its\r\nfoundation has accomplished results as striking as those obtained under\r\nany other branch of the national administration. By scientific study of\r\nall matters connected with the advancement of farm life; by experimental\r\nstations: by the use of trained agents, sent to the uttermost countries\r\nof the globe; by the practical application of anything which in theory\r\nhas been demonstrated to be efficient; in these ways, and in many\r\nothers, great good has been accomplished in raising the standard of\r\nproductiveness in farm work throughout the country.\r\n\r\n¶We live in an age when the best results can only be achieved, if to\r\nindividual self-help, we add the mutual self-help which comes by\r\ncombination, both of citizens in their individual capacity and of\r\ncitizens working through the State as an instrument. The farmers of the\r\ncountry have grown more and more to realize this, and farming has tended\r\nmore and more to take its place as an applied science—though as with\r\neverything else the theory must be tested in practical work and can\r\navail only when applied in practical fashion.\r\n\r\n¶But after all this has been said it remains true that the\r\ncountryman—the man on the farm, more than any other of our citizens\r\nto-day, is called upon continually to exercise the qualities which we\r\nlike to think of as typical of the United States throughout its\r\nhistory—the qualities of rugged independence, masterful resolution, and\r\nindividual energy and resourcefulness. He works hard (for which no man\r\nis to be pitied), and often he lives hard (which may not be pleasant):\r\nbut his life is passed in healthy surroundings, surroundings which tend\r\nto develop a fine type of citizenship. In the country moreover, the\r\nconditions are fortunately such as to allow a closer touch between man\r\nand man, than, too often, we find to be the case in the city. Men feel\r\nmore vividly the underlying sense of brotherhood of community of\r\ninterest. I do not mean by this that there are not plenty of problems\r\nconnected with life in our rural districts. There are many problems; and\r\ngreat wisdom and earnest disinterestedness in effort are needed for\r\ntheir solution.\r\n\r\n¶¶After all, we are one people, with the same fundamental\r\ncharacteristics, whether we live in the city or in the country, in the\r\nEast or in the West, in the North or in the South. Each of us, unless he\r\nis contented to be a cumberer of the earth’s surface, must strive to do\r\nhis life work with his whole heart. Each must remember that while he\r\nwill be noxious to every one unless he first do his duty by himself, he\r\nmust also strive ever to do his duty by his fellow. The problem of how\r\nto do these duties is acute everywhere. It is most acute in great\r\ncities, but it exists in the country too. A man to be a good citizen,\r\nmust first be a good breadwinner, a good husband, a good father—I hope\r\nthe father of many children; just as a woman’s first duty is to be a\r\ngood housewife and mother. The business duties, the home duties, the\r\nduties to one’s family come first. The couple who bring up plenty of\r\nhealthy children, who leave behind them many sons and daughters fitted\r\nin their turn to be good citizens, emphatically deserve well of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n¶But duty to one’s self and one’s family does not exclude duty to one’s\r\nneighbor. Each of us, rich or poor, can help his neighbor at times; and\r\nto do this he must be brought up in touch with him, into sympathy with\r\nhim. Any effort is to be welcomed that brings people closer together, so\r\nas to secure a better understanding among those whose walks of life are\r\nin ordinary circumstances far apart.\r\n\r\n¶Probably the good done is almost equally great on both sides, no matter\r\nwhich one may seem to be helping the other. But it must be kept in mind\r\nthat no good will be accomplished at all by any philanthropic or\r\ncharitable work, unless it is done along certain definite lines. In the\r\nfirst place, if the work is done in a spirit of condescension it would\r\nbe better never to attempt it. It is almost as irritating to be\r\npatronized as to be wronged. The only safe way of working is to try to\r\nfind out some scheme by which it is possible to make a common effort for\r\nthe common good. Each of us needs at times to have a helping hand\r\nstretched out to him or her.\r\n\r\nEvery one of us slips on some occasion, shame to his fellow who then\r\nrefuses to stretch out the hand that should always be ready to help the\r\nman who stumbles. It is our duty to lift him up; but it is also our duty\r\nto remember that there is no earthly use in trying to carry him. If a\r\nman will submit to being carried, that is sufficient to show that he is\r\nnot worth carrying. In the long run, the only kind of help that really\r\navails is the help which teaches a man to help himself. Such help every\r\nman who has been blessed in life should try to give to those who are\r\nless fortunate, and such help can be accepted with entire self-respect.\r\n\r\n¶The aim to set before ourselves in trying to aid one another is to give\r\nthat aid under conditions which will harm no man’s self-respect and\r\nwhich will teach the less fortunate how to help themselves as their\r\nstronger brothers do. To give such aid it is necessary not only to\r\npossess the right kind of heart, but also the right kind of head.\r\nHardness of heart is a dreadful quality, but it is doubtful whether, in\r\nthe long run, it works more damage than softness of head. At any rate\r\nboth are undesirable. The prerequisite to doing good work in the field\r\nof philanthropy—in the field of social effort, undertaken with one’s\r\nfellows for the common good—is that it shall be undertaken in a spirit\r\nof broad sanity no less than of broad and loving charity.\r\n\r\n¶¶The sinews of virtue lie in a man’s capacity to care for what is\r\noutside himself. The man who gives himself up to the service of his\r\nappetites, the man who the more goods he has the more he wants, has\r\nsurrendered himself to destruction. It makes little difference whether\r\nhe achieves his purpose or not. If his point of view is all wrong, he is\r\na bad citizen whether he be rich or poor. It is a small matter to the\r\ncommunity whether in arrogance and insolence he has misused great wealth\r\nor whether though poor, he is possessed by the mean and fierce desire to\r\nseize a morsel, the biggest possible, of that prey which the fortunate\r\nof earth consume. The man who lives simply, and justly, and honorably,\r\nwhether rich or poor, is a good citizen. Those who dream only of\r\nidleness and pleasure, who hate others, and fail to recognize the duty\r\nof each man to his brother, these, be they rich or poor, are the enemies\r\nof the State. The misuse of property is one manifestation of the same\r\nevil spirit which under changed circumstances denies the right of\r\nproperty because this right is in the hands of others. In a purely\r\nmaterial civilization the bitterness of attack on another’s possession\r\nis only additional proof of the extraordinary importance attached to\r\npossession itself. When outward well-being instead of being regarded as\r\na valuable foundation on which happiness may with wisdom be built, is\r\nmistaken for happiness itself, so that material prosperity becomes the\r\none standard, then, alike by those who enjoy such prosperity in slothful\r\nor criminal ease, and by those who in no less evil manner rail at, envy,\r\nand long for it, poverty is held to be shameful, and money, whether well\r\nor ill gotten, to stand for merit.\r\n\r\n¶All this does not mean condemnation of progress. It is mere folly to\r\ntry to dig up the dead past, and scant is the good that comes from\r\nasceticism and retirement from the world. But let us make sure that our\r\nprogress is in the essentials as well as in the incidentals. Material\r\nprosperity without the moral lift toward righteousness means a\r\ndiminishing capacity for happiness and a debased character. The worth of\r\na civilization is the worth of the man at its centre. When this man\r\nlacks moral rectitude, material progress only makes bad worse, and\r\nsocial problems still darker and more complex.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                               The Trusts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on\r\nwith ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, with\r\nvery serious social problems. The old laws, and the old customs which\r\nhad almost the binding force of law, were once quite sufficient to\r\nregulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the\r\nindustrial changes which have so enormously increased the productive\r\npower of mankind, they are no longer sufficient.\r\n\r\n¶The growth of the cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the\r\ngrowth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial\r\ncentres has meant a startling increase, not merely in the aggregate of\r\nwealth, but in the number of very large individual, and especially of\r\nvery large corporate fortunes. The creation of these great corporate\r\nfortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental\r\naction, but to natural causes in the business world, operating in other\r\ncountries as they operate in our own.\r\n\r\n¶The process has aroused much antagonism, a great part of which is\r\nwholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown\r\nricher the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before has the\r\naverage man, the wage-worker, the farmer, the small trader, been so well\r\noff as in this country and at the present time. There have been abuses\r\nconnected with the accumulation of wealth; yet it remains true that a\r\nfortune accumulated in legitimate business can be accumulated by the\r\nperson specially benefited only on condition of conferring immense\r\nincidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise, of the type\r\nwhich benefits all mankind, can only exist if the conditions are such as\r\nto offer great prizes as the rewards of success.\r\n\r\n¶The captains of industry who have driven the railway systems across\r\nthis continent, who have built up our commerce, who have developed our\r\nmanufactures, have on the whole done great good for our people. Without\r\nthem the material development of which we are so justly proud could\r\nnever have taken place. Moreover, we should recognize the immense\r\nimportance to this material development of leaving as unhampered as is\r\ncompatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom\r\nthe success of business operations inevitably rests. The slightest study\r\nof business conditions will satisfy any one capable of forming a\r\njudgment that the personal equation is the most important factor in a\r\nbusiness operation; that the business ability of the man at the head of\r\nany business concern, big or little, is usually the factor which fixes\r\nthe gulf between striking success and hopeless failure.\r\n\r\n¶An additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to be\r\nfound in the international commercial conditions of to-day. The same\r\nbusiness conditions which have produced the great aggregations of\r\ncorporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors in\r\ninternational commercial competition. Business concerns which have the\r\nlargest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are\r\nnaturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial\r\nsupremacy among the nations of the world.\r\n\r\n¶America has only just begun to assume that commanding position in the\r\ninternational business world which we believe will more and more be\r\nhers. It is of the utmost importance that this position be not\r\njeoparded, especially at a time when the overflowing abundance of our\r\nown natural resources and the skill, business energy, and mechanical\r\naptitude of our people make foreign markets essential. Under such\r\nconditions it would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful\r\nstrength of our Nation.\r\n\r\n¶Moreover, it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with\r\nignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably\r\nendangers the interests of all. The fundamental rule in our national\r\nlife—the rule which underlies all others—is that, on the whole, and in\r\nthe long run, we shall go up or down together. There are exceptions; and\r\nin times of prosperity some will prosper far more, and in times of\r\nadversity some will suffer far more, than others; but speaking\r\ngenerally, a period of good times means that all share more or less in\r\nthem, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or\r\nless degree.\r\n\r\n¶It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any proof of this\r\nstatement; the memory of the lean years which began in 1893 is still\r\nvivid, and we can contrast them with the conditions in this very year\r\nwhich is now closing. Disaster to great business enterprises can never\r\nhave its effects limited to the men at the top. It spreads throughout,\r\nand while it is bad for everybody, it is worst for those farthest down.\r\nThe capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries; but the wage-worker may be\r\ndeprived of even bare necessities.\r\n\r\n¶The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must\r\nbe taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.\r\nMany of those who have made it their vocation to denounce the great\r\nindustrial combinations which are popularly, although with technical\r\ninaccuracy, known as “trusts,” appeal especially to hatred and fear.\r\n\r\n¶These are precisely the two emotions, particularly when combined with\r\nignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steady judgment.\r\nIn facing new industrial conditions, the whole history of the world\r\nshows that legislation will generally be both unwise and ineffective\r\nunless undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober self-restraint. Much\r\nof the legislation directed at the trusts would have been exceedingly\r\nmischievous had it not also been entirely ineffective. In accordance\r\nwith a well-known sociological law, the ignorant or reckless agitator\r\nhas been the really effective friend of the evils which he has been\r\nnominally opposing.\r\n\r\n¶In dealing with business interests, for the Government to undertake by\r\ncrude and ill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad,\r\nwould be to incur the risk of such far-reaching national disaster that\r\nit would be preferable to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand\r\nthe impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with\r\nwhich they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would\r\nendeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and\r\nto what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply remedies.\r\n\r\n¶All this is true; and yet it is also true that there are real and grave\r\nevils, one of the chief being over-capitalization because of its many\r\nbaleful consequences; and a resolute and practical effort must be made\r\nto correct these evils.\r\n\r\n¶There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people\r\nthat the great corporations known as the trusts are in certain of their\r\nfeatures and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. This springs\r\nfrom no spirit of envy or uncharitableness, nor lack of pride in the\r\ngreat industrial achievements that have placed this country at the head\r\nof the nations struggling for commercial supremacy. It does not rest\r\nupon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the necessity of meeting\r\nchanging and changed conditions of trade with new methods, nor upon\r\nignorance of the fact that combination of capital in the effort to\r\naccomplish great things is necessary when the world’s progress demands\r\nthat great things be done. It is based upon sincere conviction that\r\ncombination and concentration should be, not prohibited, but supervised\r\nand within reasonable limits controlled; and in my judgment this\r\nconviction is right.\r\n\r\n¶It is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to\r\nrequire that when men receive from Government the privilege of doing\r\nbusiness under corporate form, which frees them from individual\r\nresponsibility, and enables them to call into their enterprise the\r\ncapital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful\r\nrepresentations as to the value of the property in which the capital is\r\nto be invested. Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should be\r\nregulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public\r\ninjury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social\r\nbetterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the\r\nentire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corporations exist only\r\nbecause they are created and safeguarded by our institutions; and it is\r\ntherefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with\r\nthese institutions.\r\n\r\n¶The first essential in determining how to deal with the great\r\nindustrial combinations is knowledge of the facts—publicity. In the\r\ninterest of the public, the Government should have the right to inspect\r\nand examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in interstate\r\nbusiness. Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke.\r\nWhat further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation,\r\nor taxation, can only be determined after publicity has been obtained,\r\nby process of law, and in the course of administration. The first\r\nrequisite is knowledge, full and complete—knowledge which may be made\r\npublic to the world.\r\n\r\n¶Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint-stock or other\r\nassociations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or\r\nprivileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and\r\nfull and accurate information as to their operations should be made\r\npublic regularly at reasonable intervals.\r\n\r\n¶The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one\r\nState, always do business in many States, often doing very little\r\nbusiness in the State where they are incorporated. There is utter lack\r\nof uniformity in the State laws about them; and as no State has any\r\nexclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practice\r\nproved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action.\r\nTherefore, in the interest of the whole people, the Nation should,\r\nwithout interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself,\r\nalso assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations\r\ndoing an interstate business. This is especially true where the\r\ncorporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some\r\nmonopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would be no\r\nhardship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in their case\r\nit is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it is probable\r\nthat supervision of corporations by the National Government need not go\r\nso far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so\r\nconservative a State as Massachusetts, in order to produce excellent\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n¶When the constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in\r\nindustrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a\r\nmatter of course that the several States were the proper authorities to\r\nregulate, so far as was then necessary, the comparatively insignificant\r\nand strictly localized corporate bodies of the day. The conditions are\r\nnow wholly different and wholly different action is called for. I\r\nbelieve that a law can be framed which will enable the National\r\nGovernment to exercise control along the lines above indicated;\r\nprofiting by the experience gained through the passage and\r\nadministration of the Interstate-Commerce Act. If, however the judgment\r\nof the Congress is that it lacks the constitutional power to pass such\r\nan act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer\r\nthe power.\r\n\r\n¶There should be created a Cabinet officer, to be known as Secretary of\r\nCommerce and Industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the last\r\nsession of the Congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce\r\nin its broadest sense; including among many other things whatever\r\nconcerns labor and all matters affecting the great business corporations\r\nand our merchant marine.\r\n\r\n¶The course proposed is one phase of what should be a comprehensive and\r\nfar-reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose of\r\nbroadening our markets, securing our business interests on a safe basis,\r\nand making firm our new position in the international industrial world;\r\nwhile scrupulously safeguarding the rights of wage-worker and\r\ncapitalist, of investor and private citizen, so as to secure equity as\r\nbetween man and man in this Republic.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                              The Problem\r\n                                   of\r\n                               the South\r\n\r\n\r\nAll good Americans who dwell in the North must, because they are good\r\nAmericans, feel the most earnest friendship for their fellow-countrymen\r\nwho dwell in the South, a friendship all the greater because it is in\r\nthe South that we find in its most acute phase one of the gravest\r\nproblems before our people: the problem of so dealing with the man of\r\none color as to secure him the right that no one would grudge him if he\r\nwere of another color. To solve this problem it is of course necessary\r\nto educate him to perform the duties, a failure to perform which will\r\nrender him a curse to himself and to all around him.\r\n\r\n¶Most certainly all clear-sighted and generous men in the North\r\nappreciate the difficulty and perplexity of this problem, sympathize\r\nwith the South in the embarrassment of conditions for which she is not\r\nalone responsible, feel an honest wish to help her where help is\r\npracticable, and have the heartiest respect for those brave and earnest\r\nmen of the South who, in the face of fearful difficulties, are doing all\r\nthat men can do for the betterment both of white and of black. The\r\nattitude of the North toward the negro is far from what it should be,\r\nand there is need that the North also should act in good faith upon the\r\nprinciple of giving to each man what is justly due him, of treating him\r\non his worth as a man, granting him no special favor, but denying him no\r\nproper opportunity for labor and the reward of labor.\r\n\r\n¶But the peculiar circumstances of the South render the problem there\r\nfar greater and far more acute. Neither I nor any other man can say that\r\nany given way of approaching that problem will present in our time even\r\nan approximately perfect solution, but we can safely say that there can\r\nnever be such solution at all unless we approach it with the effort to\r\ndo fair and equal justice among all men; and to demand from them in\r\nreturn just and fair treatment for others.\r\n\r\n¶Our efforts should be to secure to each man, whatever his color,\r\nequality of opportunity, equality of treatment before the law. As a\r\npeople striving to shape our actions in accordance with the great law of\r\nrighteousness we cannot afford to take part in or be indifferent to the\r\noppression or maltreatment of any man who, against overwhelming\r\ndisadvantages, has by his own industry, energy, self-respect and\r\nperseverance struggled upward to a position which would entitle him to\r\nthe respect of his fellows, if only his skin were of a different hue.\r\n\r\n¶Every generous impulse in us revolts at the thought of thrusting down\r\ninstead of helping up such a man. To deny any man the fair treatment\r\ngranted to others no better than he is to commit a wrong upon him—a\r\nwrong sure to react in the long run upon those guilty of such denial.\r\nThe only safe principle upon which Americans can act is that of “all men\r\nup,” not that of “some men down.” If in any community the level of\r\nintelligence, morality, and thrift among the colored men can be raised,\r\nit is, humanely speaking, sure that the same level among the whites will\r\nbe raised to an even higher degree; and it is no less sure that the\r\ndebasement of the blacks will in the end carry with it an attendant\r\ndebasement of the whites.\r\n\r\n¶The problem is so to adjust the relations between two races of\r\ndifferent ethical type that the rights of neither be abridged nor\r\njeopardized; that the backward race be trained so that it may enter into\r\nthe possession of true freedom while the forward race is enabled to\r\npreserve unharmed the high civilization wrought out by its forefathers.\r\nThe working out of this problem must necessarily be slow; it is not\r\npossible in offhand fashion to obtain or to confer the priceless boon of\r\nfreedom, industrial efficiency, political capacity, and domestic\r\nmorality. Nor is it only necessary to train the colored man; it is quite\r\nas necessary to train the white man, for on his shoulders rest a well\r\nnigh unparalleled sociological responsibility. It is a problem demanding\r\nthe best thought; the utmost patience, the most earnest effort, the\r\nbroadest charity, of the statesman, the student, the philanthropist; of\r\nthe leaders of thought in every department of our national life. The\r\nChurch can be a most important factor in solving it aright. But above\r\nall else we need for its successful solution the sober, kindly,\r\nsteadfast, unselfish performance of duty by the average plain citizen in\r\nhis every-day dealings with his fellows.\r\n\r\n¶The ideal of elemental justice meted out to every man is the ideal we\r\nshould keep ever before us. It will be many a long day before we attain\r\nto it and unless we show not only devotion to it, but also wisdom and\r\nself-restraint in the exhibition of that devotion, we shall defer the\r\ntime for its realization still further. In striving to attain to so much\r\nof it as concerns dealing with men of different colors, we must remember\r\ntwo things.\r\n\r\n¶In the first place it is true of the colored man, as it is true of the\r\nwhite man, that in the long run his fate must depend far more upon his\r\nown effort than upon the efforts of any outside friend. Every vicious,\r\nvenal, or ignorant colored man is an even greater foe to his own race\r\nthan to the community as a whole. The colored man’s self-respect\r\nentitles him to do that share in the political work of the country which\r\nis warranted by his individual ability and integrity and the position he\r\nhas won for himself. But the prime requisite of the race is moral and\r\nindustrial uplifting.\r\n\r\n¶Laziness and shiftlessness, then, and above all, vice and criminality\r\nof every kind, are evils more potent for harm to the black race than all\r\nacts of oppression of white men put together. The colored man who fails\r\nto condemn crime in another colored man, who fails to co-operate in all\r\nlawful ways in bringing colored criminals to justice, is the worst enemy\r\nof his own people, as well as an enemy to all the people. Law-abiding\r\nblack men should, for the sake of their race, be foremost in relentless\r\nand unceasing warfare against lawbreaking black men. If the standards of\r\nprivate morality and industrial efficiency can be raised high enough\r\namong the black race, then its future on this continent is secure. The\r\nstability and purity of the home is vital to the welfare of the black\r\nrace, as it is to the welfare of every race.\r\n\r\n¶The white man who can be of most use to the colored man is that colored\r\nman’s neighbor. It is the southern people themselves who must and can\r\nsolve the difficulties that exist in the South. What help the people of\r\nthe rest of the Union can give them must and will be gladly and\r\ncheerfully given. The hope of advancement for the colored man in the\r\nSouth lies in his steady common-sense effort to improve his moral and\r\nmaterial conditions and to work in harmony with the white man in\r\nupbuilding the commonwealth. The future of the South now depends upon\r\nthe people of both races living up to the spirit and letter of the laws\r\nof their several states and working out the destinies of both races not\r\nas races, but as law-abiding citizens.[29]\r\n\r\n¶It is a good thing that the guard around the tomb of Lincoln should be\r\ncomposed of colored soldiers. It was my own good fortune at Santiago to\r\nserve beside colored troops. A man who is good enough to shed his blood\r\nfor the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.\r\nMore than that no man is entitled to, and less than that no man shall\r\nhave.[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                               Lynch Law\r\n\r\n\r\nAll thoughtful men must feel the gravest alarm over the growth of\r\nlynching in this country, and especially over the peculiarly hideous\r\nform so often taken by mob violence when colored men are the victims, on\r\nwhich occasions the mob seems to lay most weight, not on the crime but\r\non the color of the criminal. In a certain proportion of these cases the\r\nman lynched has been guilty of a crime horrible beyond description a\r\ncrime so horrible that as far as he himself is concerned he has\r\nforfeited the right to any kind of sympathy whatsoever.\r\n\r\n¶The feeling of all good citizens that such a hideous crime shall not be\r\nhideously punished by mob violence is due not in the least to sympathy\r\nfor the criminal, but to a very lively sense of the dreadful\r\nconsequences which follow the course taken by the mob in exacting\r\ninhuman vengeance from an inhuman wrong.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, moreover, it is well to remember that the criminal not\r\nmerely sins against humanity in inexpiable and unpardonable fashion, but\r\nsins particularly against his own race and does them a wrong far greater\r\nthan any white man can possibly do them.\r\n\r\n¶Therefore, in such cases the colored people throughout the land should\r\nin every possible way show their belief that they, more than all others\r\nin the community are horrified at the commission of such a crime, and\r\nare peculiarly concerned in taking every possible measure to prevent its\r\nrecurrence and to bring the criminal to immediate justice.\r\n\r\n¶The slightest lack of vigor either in denunciation of the crime or in\r\nbringing the criminal to justice is itself unpardonable. Moreover, every\r\neffort should be made under the law to expedite the proceedings of\r\njustice in the case of such an awful crime. But it cannot be necessary,\r\nin order to accomplish this, to deprive any citizen, of those\r\nfundamental rights to be heard in his own defence which are so dear to\r\nus all and which lie at the root of our liberty.\r\n\r\n¶It certainly ought to be possible by the proper administration of the\r\nlaws to secure swift vengeance upon the criminal; and the best and\r\nimmediate efforts of all legislators, judges and citizens should be\r\naddressed to securing such reforms in our legal procedure as to leave no\r\nvestige of excuse for those misguided men who undertake to wreak\r\nvengeance through violent methods.\r\n\r\n¶Men who have been guilty of a crime like rape or murder should be\r\nvisited with swift and certain punishment, and the just efforts made by\r\nthe courts to protect them in their rights should under no circumstances\r\nbe perverted into permitting any mere technicality to avert or delay\r\ntheir punishment. The substantial rights of the prisoner to a fair trial\r\nmust, of course, be guaranteed; but subject to this guarantee, the law\r\nmust work swiftly and surely, and all the agents of the law should\r\nrealize the wrong they do when they permit justice to be delayed or\r\nthwarted for technical or insufficient reasons.\r\n\r\n¶We must show that the law is adequate to deal with crime by freeing it\r\nfrom every vestige of technicality and delay.\r\n\r\n¶But the fullest recognition of the horror of the crime and the most\r\ncomplete lack of sympathy with the criminal can not in the least\r\ndiminish our horror at the way in which it has become customary to\r\navenge these crimes, and at the consequences that are already proceeding\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\n¶It is, of course, inevitable that where vengeance is taken by a mob it\r\nshould frequently light on innocent people; and the wrong done in such a\r\ncase to the individual is one for which there is no remedy. But even\r\nwhere the real criminal is reached, the wrong done by the mob to the\r\ncommunity itself is well nigh as great. Especially is this true where\r\nthe lynching is accompanied by torture. There are certain hideous sights\r\nwhich when once seen, can never be wholly erased from the mental retina.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact of having seen them implies degradation. This is a\r\nthousandfold stronger when, instead of merely seeing the dead, the man\r\nhas participated in it. Whoever in any part of our country has ever\r\ntaken part in lawlessly putting to death a criminal by the dreadful\r\ntorture of fire must forever after have the awful spectacle of his own\r\nhandiwork seared into his brain and soul. He can never again be the same\r\nman.\r\n\r\n¶This matter of lynching would be a terrible thing even if it stopped\r\nwith the lynching of men guilty of the inhuman and hideous crime of\r\nrape; but as a matter of fact, lawlessness of this type never does stop\r\nand never can stop in such fashion. Every violent man in the community\r\nis encouraged by every case of lynching in which the lynchers go\r\nunpunished to himself take the law into his own hands whenever it suits\r\nhis own convenience. In the same way the use of torture by the mob in\r\ncertain cases is sure to spread until it is applied more or less\r\nindiscriminately in other cases.\r\n\r\n¶The spirit of lawlessness grows with what it feeds on, and when mobs\r\nwith impunity lynch criminals for one crime they are certain to begin to\r\nlynch real or alleged criminals for other causes. Mob violence is simply\r\none form of anarchy, and anarchy is now, as it always has been, the\r\nhandmaiden and forerunner of tyranny.\r\n\r\n¶Surely no patriot can fail to see the fearful brutalization and\r\ndebasement which the indulgence of such a spirit and such practices\r\ninevitably portend. Surely all public men, all writers for the daily\r\npress, all clergymen, all teachers, all who in any way have a right to\r\naddress the public, should with every energy unite to denounce such\r\ncrimes and to support those engaged in putting them down. As a people we\r\nclaim the right to speak with peculiar emphasis for freedom and for fair\r\ntreatment of all men without regard to differences of race, fortune,\r\ncreed or color. We forfeit the right so to speak when we commit or\r\ncondone such crimes as those of which I speak.\r\n\r\n¶The nation, like the individual, can not commit a crime with impunity.\r\nIf we are guilty of lawlessness and brutal violence, whether our guilt\r\nconsists in active participation therein or in mere connivance and\r\nencouragement, we shall assuredly suffer later on because of what we\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\n¶The cornerstone of this Republic, as of all free governments, is\r\nrespect for and obedience to the law. Where we permit the law to be\r\ndefied or evaded, whether by rich man or poor man, by black man or\r\nwhite, we are by just so much weakening the bonds of our civilization\r\nand increasing the chances of its overthrow, and of the substitution\r\ntherefor of a system in which there shall be violent alternations of\r\nanarchy and tyranny.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                              The Indians\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the Indians our aim should be their ultimate absorption\r\ninto the body of our people. But in many cases this absorption must and\r\nshould be very slow. In portions of the Indian territory the mixture of\r\nblood has gone on at the same time with progress in wealth and\r\neducation, so that there are plenty of men with varying degrees of\r\npurity of Indian blood who are absolutely indistinguishable in point of\r\nsocial, political, and economic ability from their white associates.\r\nThere are other tribes which have as yet made no perceptible advance\r\ntoward such equality. To try to force such tribes too fast is to prevent\r\ntheir going forward at all. Moreover, the tribes live under widely\r\ndifferent conditions.\r\n\r\n¶Where a tribe has made considerable advance and lives on fertile\r\nfarming soil it is possible to allot the members lands in severalty much\r\nas is the case with white settlers. There are other tribes where such a\r\ncourse is not desirable. On the arid prairie lands the effort should be\r\nto induce the Indians to lead pastoral rather than agricultural lives,\r\nand permit them to settle in villages rather than to force them into\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\n¶The large Indian schools situated remote from any Indian reservation do\r\na special and peculiar work of great importance. But, excellent though\r\nthese are, an immense amount of additional work must be done on the\r\nreservations themselves among the old, and above all among the young\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n¶The first and most important step toward the absorption of the Indian\r\nis to teach him to earn his living; yet it is not necessarily to be\r\nassumed that in each community all Indians must become either tillers of\r\nthe soil or stock-raisers. Their industries may properly be diversified,\r\nand those who show special desire or adaptability for industrial or even\r\ncommercial pursuits should be encouraged so far as practicable to follow\r\nout each his own bent.\r\n\r\n¶Every effort should be made to develop the Indian along the lines of\r\nnatural aptitude, and to encourage the existing native industries\r\npeculiar to certain tribes, such as the various kinds of basket-weaving,\r\ncanoe-building, smithwork, and blanket-work. Above all, the Indian boys\r\nand girls should be given confident command of colloquial English, and\r\nshould ordinarily be prepared for a vigorous struggle with the\r\nconditions under which their people live, rather than for immediate\r\nabsorption into some more highly developed community.\r\n\r\n¶The officials who represent the Government in dealing with the Indians\r\nwork under hard conditions and also under conditions which render it\r\neasy to do wrong and very difficult to detect wrong. Consequently they\r\nshould be amply paid on the one hand, and on the other hand a\r\nparticularly high standard of conduct should be demanded from them, and\r\nwhere misconduct can be proved the punishment should be exemplary.[9]\r\n\r\n¶In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up\r\nour minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a member\r\nof a tribe. The General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engine to\r\nbreak up the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the family and the\r\nindividual. Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have\r\nalready become citizens of the United States. We should now break up the\r\ntribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands;\r\nthat is, they should be divided into individual holdings. There will be\r\na transition period during which the funds will in many cases have to be\r\nheld in trust. This is the case also with the lands. A stop should be\r\nput upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease their\r\nallotments. The effort should be steadily to make the Indian work like\r\nany other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the Indians should\r\nbe made the same as those of the whites.\r\n\r\n¶In the schools the education should be elementary and largely\r\nindustrial. The need of higher education among the Indians is very, very\r\nlimited. On the reservation care should be taken to try to suit the\r\nteaching to the needs of the particular Indian. There is no use in\r\nattempting to induce agriculture in a country suited only for cattle\r\nraising, where the Indian should be made a stock grower. The ration\r\nsystem, which is merely the corral and the reservation system, is highly\r\ndetrimental to the Indians. It promotes beggary, perpetuates pauperism,\r\nand stifles industry. It is an effectual barrier to progress. It must\r\ncontinue to a greater or less degree as long as tribes are herded on\r\nreservations and have everything in common. The Indian should be treated\r\nas an individual—like the white man. During the change of treatment\r\ninevitable hardships will occur; every effort should be made to minimize\r\nthese hardships; but we should not because of them hesitate to make the\r\nchange. There should be a continuous reduction in the number of\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n¶In dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important than\r\nto preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation\r\nresulting from the liquor traffic. We are doing all we can to save our\r\nown Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by international agreement\r\nthis same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess\r\nexclusive control, every effort should be made to bring it about.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                              Immigration\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of immigration is of vital interest to this country. In the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1905, there came to the United States 1,026,000\r\nalien immigrants. In other words, in the single year that has just\r\nelapsed there came to this country a greater number of people than came\r\nhere during the one hundred and sixty-nine years of our Colonial life\r\nwhich intervened between the first landing at Jamestown and the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. It is clearly shown in the report of the\r\nCommissioner-General of Immigration that while much of this enormous\r\nimmigration is undoubtedly healthy and natural, a considerable\r\nproportion is undesirable for one reason or another; moreover, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of it, probably a very large proportion,\r\nincluding most of the undesirable class, does not come here of its own\r\ninitiative but because of the activity of the agents of the great\r\ntransportation companies. These agents are distributed throughout\r\nEurope, and by the offer of all kinds of inducements they wheedle and\r\ncajole many immigrants, often against their best interest, to come here.\r\nThe most serious obstacle we have to encounter in the effort to secure a\r\nproper regulation of the immigration to these shores arises from the\r\ndetermined opposition of the foreign steamship lines who have no\r\ninterest whatever in the matter save to increase the returns on their\r\ncapital by carrying masses of immigrants hither in the steerage quarters\r\nof their ships.\r\n\r\n¶We can not have too much immigration of the right sort, and we should\r\nhave none whatever of the wrong sort. Of course it is desirable that\r\neven the right kind of immigration should be properly distributed in\r\nthis country. We need more of such immigration for the South; and\r\nspecial effort should be made to secure it. Perhaps it would be possible\r\nto limit the number of immigrants allowed to come in any one year to New\r\nYork and other northern cities, while leaving unlimited the number\r\nallowed to come to the South; always provided, however, that a stricter\r\neffort is made to see that only immigrants of the right kind come to our\r\ncountry anywhere.\r\n\r\n¶In actual practice it has proved so difficult to enforce the\r\nimmigration laws where long stretches of frontier marked by an imaginary\r\nline alone intervene between us and our neighbors that I recommend that\r\nno immigrants be allowed to come in from Canada and Mexico, save natives\r\nof the two countries themselves. As much as possible should be done to\r\ndistribute the immigrants upon the land and keep them away from the\r\ncongested tenement-house districts of the great cities. But the\r\ndistribution is a palliative, not a cure. The prime need is to keep out\r\nall immigrants who will not make good American citizens. The laws now\r\nexisting for the exclusion of undesirable immigrants should be\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\n¶Adequate means should be adopted, enforced by sufficient penalties, to\r\ncompel steamship companies engaged in the passenger business to observe\r\nin good faith the law which forbids them to encourage or solicit\r\nimmigration to the United States. Moreover, there should be a sharp\r\nlimitation imposed upon vessels coming to our ports as to the number of\r\nimmigrants in ratio to the tonnage which each vessel can carry. This\r\nratio should be high enough to insure the coming hither of as good a\r\nclass of aliens as possible. Provision should be made for the surer\r\npunishment of those who induce aliens to come to this country under\r\npromise or assurance of employment. It should be made possible to\r\ninflict a sufficiently heavy penalty on any employer violating this law\r\nto deter him from taking the risk. It seems to me wise that there should\r\nbe an international conference held to deal with this question of\r\nimmigration, which has more than a merely national significance; such a\r\nconference could among other things enter at length into the methods for\r\nsecuring a thorough inspection of would-be immigrants at the ports from\r\nwhich they desire to embark before permitting them to embark.\r\n\r\n¶In dealing with this question it is unwise to depart from the old\r\nAmerican tradition and to discriminate for or against any man who\r\ndesires to come here and become a citizen, save on the ground of that\r\nman’s fitness for citizenship. It is our right and duty to consider his\r\nmoral and social quality. His standard of living should be such that he\r\nwill not, by pressure of competition, lower the standard of living of\r\nour own wage-workers; for it must ever be a prime object of our\r\nlegislation to keep high their standard of living. If the man who seeks\r\nto come here is from the moral and social standpoint of such a character\r\nas to bid fair to add value to the community he should be heartily\r\nwelcomed. We can not afford to pay heed to whether he is of one creed or\r\nanother, of one nation or another. We cannot afford to consider whether\r\nhe is Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whether he is Englishman\r\nor Irishman, Frenchman or German, Japanese, Italian, Scandinavian, Slav,\r\nor Magyar. What we should endeavor to find out is the individual quality\r\nof the individual man. In my judgment, with this end in view, we shall\r\nhave to prepare through our own agents a far more rigid inspection in\r\nthe countries from which the immigrants come.\r\n\r\n¶It will be a great deal better to have fewer immigrants, but all of the\r\nright kind, than a great number of immigrants, many of whom are\r\nnecessarily of the wrong kind. As far as possible we wish to limit the\r\nimmigration to this country to persons who propose to become citizens of\r\nthis country, and we can well afford to insist upon adequate scrutiny of\r\nthe character of those who are thus proposed for future citizenship.\r\nThere should be an increase in the stringency of the laws to keep out\r\nthe insane, the idiotic, the epileptic, and pauper immigrants. But this\r\nis by no means enough. Not merely the anarchist, but every man of\r\nanarchistic tendencies, all violent and disorderly people, all people of\r\nbad character, the incompetent, the lazy, the vicious, the physically\r\nunfit, defective, or degenerate should be kept out. The stocks out of\r\nwhich American citizenship is to be built should be strong and healthy,\r\nsound in body, mind and character. If it be objected that the Government\r\nagents would not always select well, the answer is that they would\r\ncertainly select better than do the agents and brokers of foreign\r\nsteamship companies, the people who now do what ever selection is\r\ndone.[14]\r\n\r\n¶Our present immigration laws are unsatisfactory. We need every honest\r\nand efficient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen, every\r\nimmigrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a strong body, a stout\r\nheart, a good head, and a resolute purpose to do his duty well in every\r\nway and to bring up his children as law-abiding and God-fearing members\r\nof the community. But there should be a comprehensive law enacted with\r\nthe object of working a threefold improvement over our present system.\r\nFirst, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who are\r\nknown to be believers in anarchistic principles or members of\r\nanarchistic societies, but also all persons who are of a low moral\r\ntendency or of unsavory reputation. This means that we should require a\r\nmore thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigid system of\r\nexamination at our immigration ports, the former being especially\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n¶The second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure by\r\na careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligent\r\ncapacity to appreciate American institutions and act sanely as American\r\ncitizens. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many of them\r\nbelong to the intelligent criminal class. But it would do what is also\r\nin point, that is, tend to decrease the sum of ignorance, so potent in\r\nproducing the envy, suspicion, malignant passion, and hatred of order,\r\nout of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs. Finally, all\r\npersons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economic\r\nfitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American\r\nlabor. There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an\r\nAmerican living and enough money to ensure a decent start under American\r\nconditions. This would stop the influx of cheap labor, and the resulting\r\ncompetition which gives rise to so much of bitterness in American\r\nindustrial life; and it would dry up the springs of the pestilential\r\nsocial conditions in our great cities, where anarchistic organizations\r\nhave their greatest possibility of growth.\r\n\r\n¶Both educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law should be\r\ndesigned to protect and elevate the general body politic and social. A\r\nvery close supervision should be exercised over the steamship companies\r\nwhich mainly bring over the immigrants, and they should be held to a\r\nstrict accountability for any infraction of the law.[7]\r\n\r\n¶The United States Government endeavors to do its duty by the immigrants\r\nwho come to these shores, but unless people have had some experience\r\nwith the dangers and difficulties surrounding the newly arrived\r\nimmigrant they can hardly realize how great they are.\r\n\r\n¶The immigrant comes here almost unprotected; he does not as a rule know\r\nour language, he is wholly unfamiliar with our institutions, our\r\ncustoms, our habits of life and ways of thought, and there are, I am\r\nsorry to say, great numbers of evil and wicked people who hope to make\r\ntheir livelihood by preying on him. He is exposed to innumerable\r\ntemptations, innumerable petty oppressions, on almost every hand, and\r\nunless some one is there to help him he literally has no idea where to\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n¶No greater work can be done by a philanthropic or religious society\r\nthan to stretch out the helping hand to the man and the woman who come\r\nhere to this country to become citizens, and the parent of citizens, and\r\ntherefore, to do their part in making up for weal or woe the future of\r\nour land. If we do not take care of them, if we do not try to uplift\r\nthem, then as sure as fate our own children will pay the penalty. If we\r\ndo not see that the immigrant and the children of the immigrant are\r\nraised up most assuredly the result will be that our own children and\r\nchildren’s children are pulled down. Either they will rise or we shall\r\nsink.\r\n\r\n¶The level of well-being in this country will be a level for all of us.\r\nWe cannot keep that level down for a part and not have it sink more or\r\nless for the whole. Therefore it means much, not merely to the\r\nimmigrants but to every good American that there should be at Ellis\r\nIsland, the colporteurs and the representatives of religious and\r\nphilanthropic societies to try to care for the immigrant’s body, and\r\nabove all to try to care for the immigrant’s soul.\r\n\r\n¶It is of course unnecessary to say that the things of the body must be\r\ncared for; that the first duty of any man, especially of the man who has\r\nothers dependent upon him, is to take care of them and to take care of\r\nhimself. Nobody can help others if he begins by being a burden upon\r\nothers. Each man must be able to pull his own weight; and therefore each\r\nman must show his capacity to earn for himself and his family enough to\r\nsecure a certain amount of material well-being. That must be the\r\nfoundation. But on that foundation he must build as a superstructure the\r\nspiritual life.[17]\r\n\r\n¶This government is based upon the fundamental idea that each man, no\r\nmatter what his occupation, his race, or his religious belief, is\r\nentitled to be treated on his worth as a man, and neither favored nor\r\ndiscriminated against because of any accident in his position. Even here\r\nat home there is painful difficulty in the effort to realize this ideal;\r\nand the attempt to secure from other nations acknowledgment of it\r\nsometimes encounters obstacles that are well-nigh insuperable; for there\r\nare many nations which in the slow procession of the ages have not yet\r\nreached that point where the principles which Americans regard as\r\naxiomatic obtain any recognition whatever. One of the chief difficulties\r\narises in connection with certain American citizens of foreign birth or\r\nof particular creed, who desire to travel abroad. Russia for instance,\r\nrefuses to admit and protect Jews. Turkey refuses to admit and protect\r\ncertain sects of Christians.\r\n\r\n¶This Government has consistently demanded equal protection abroad for\r\nall American citizens, whether native or naturalized. On March 27, 1899,\r\nSecretary Hay sent a letter of instructions to all the diplomatic and\r\nconsular officers of the United States in which he said: “This\r\nDepartment does not discriminate between native-born and naturalized\r\ncitizens in according them protection while they are abroad, equality of\r\ntreatment being required by the laws of the United States.”\r\n\r\n¶These orders to our agents abroad have been repeated again and again,\r\nand are treated as the fundamental rule of conduct laid down for them,\r\nproceeding upon the theory “that all naturalized citizens of the United\r\nStates while in foreign countries are entitled to and shall receive from\r\nthis Government the same protection of persons and property which is\r\naccorded to native-born citizens.”\r\n\r\n¶In issuing passports the State Department never discriminates, or\r\nalludes to any man’s religion; and in granting to every American\r\ncitizen, native or naturalized, Christian or Jew, the same passport, so\r\nfar as it has power it insists that all foreign governments shall accept\r\nthe passport as prima facie proof that the person therein described is a\r\ncitizen of the United States and entitled to protection as such. It is a\r\nstanding order to every American diplomatic and consular officer to\r\nprotect every American citizen of whatever faith, from unjust\r\nmolestation, and officers abroad have been stringently required to\r\ncomply with this order.... The steady pressure which the Department has\r\nbeen keeping up in the past will be continued in the future. This\r\nAdministration has on all proper occasions given clear expression to the\r\nbelief of the American people that discrimination and oppression because\r\nof religion, wherever practiced, are acts of injustice before God and\r\nman, and in making evident to the world the depth of American conviction\r\nin this regard we have gone to the very limit of diplomatic usage.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                          The Chinese Question\r\n\r\n\r\nThe questions arising in connection with Chinese immigration stand by\r\nthemselves. The conditions in China are such that the entire Chinese\r\ncoolie class, that is, the class of Chinese laborers, skilled and\r\nunskilled, legitimately come under the head of undesirable immigrants to\r\nthis country, because of their numbers, the low wages for which they\r\nwork and their low standard of living. Not only is it to the interest of\r\nthis country to keep them out, but the Chinese authorities do not desire\r\nthat they should be admitted. At present their entrance is prohibited by\r\nlaws amply adequate to accomplish this purpose. These laws have been,\r\nare being, and will be, thoroughly enforced. The violations of them are\r\nso few in number as to be infinitesimal and can be entirely disregarded.\r\nThere is no serious proposal to alter the immigration law as regards the\r\nChinese laborer, skilled or unskilled, and there is no excuse for any\r\nman feeling or affecting to feel the slightest alarm on the subject.\r\n\r\n¶But in the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese\r\nlaborers, Chinese coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done by\r\nthis nation to the people of China, and therefore ultimately to this\r\nNation itself. Chinese students, business and professional men of all\r\nkinds—not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers,\r\nprofessors, travelers, and the like—should be encouraged to come here\r\nand treated on precisely the same footing that we treat students,\r\nbusiness men, travelers, and the like of other nations.\r\n\r\n¶Our laws and treaties should be framed, not so as to put these people\r\nin the excepted classes, but to state that we will admit all Chinese,\r\nexcept Chinese of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or unskilled\r\nlaborers. There would not be the least danger that any such provision\r\nwould result in any relaxation of the law about laborers. These will,\r\nunder all conditions, be kept out absolutely. But it will be more easy\r\nto see that both justice and courtesy are shown, as they ought to be\r\nshown, to other Chinese, if the law or treaty is framed as above\r\nsuggested. Examinations should be completed at the port of departure\r\nfrom China. For this purpose there should be provided a more adequate\r\nconsular service in China than we now have. The appropriations, both for\r\nthe offices of the consuls and for the office forces in the consulates,\r\nshould be increased.\r\n\r\n¶As a people we have talked much of the open door in China, and we\r\nexpect, and quite rightly intend to insist upon, justice being shown us\r\nby the Chinese. But we cannot expect to receive equity unless we do\r\nequity. We can not ask the Chinese to do to us what we are unwilling to\r\ndo to them. They would have a perfect right to exclude our laboring men\r\nif our laboring men threatened to come into their country in such\r\nnumbers as to jeopardize the well-being of the Chinese population; and\r\nas, mutatis mutandis, these were the conditions with which Chinese\r\nimmigration actually brought this people face to face, we had and have a\r\nperfect right, which the Chinese Government in no way contests, to act\r\nas we have acted in the matter of restricting coolie immigration. That\r\nthis right exists for each country was explicitly acknowledged in the\r\nlast treaty between the two countries. But we must treat the Chinese\r\nstudent, traveler, and business man in a spirit of the broadest justice\r\nand courtesy if we expect similar treatment to be accorded to our own\r\npeople of similar rank who go to China. Much trouble has come during the\r\npast year from the organized boycott against American goods which has\r\nbeen started in China. The main factor in producing this boycott has\r\nbeen the resentment felt by the students and business people of China,\r\nby all the Chinese leaders, against the harshness of our law toward\r\neducated Chinamen of the professional and business classes.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                          Official Corruption\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need civic righteousness. The best constitution that the wit of man\r\nhas ever devised, the best institutions that the ablest statesmen in the\r\nworld ever have reduced to practice by law or by custom, will be of no\r\navail if they are not vivified by the spirit which makes a State great\r\nby making its citizens honest, just, and brave. I do not ask you as\r\npractical believers in applied Christianity to take part one way or the\r\nother in matters that are merely partisan. There are plenty of questions\r\nabout which honest men can and do differ very greatly and very\r\nintensely, but as to which the triumph of either side may be compatible\r\nwith the welfare of the State—a lesser degree of welfare or a greater\r\ndegree of welfare—but compatible with the welfare of the State.\r\n\r\n¶But there are certain great principles, such as those which Cromwell\r\nwould have called “fundamentals,” concerning which no man has a right to\r\nhave more than one opinion. Such a principle is honesty. If you have not\r\nhonesty in the average private citizen, or public servant, then all else\r\ngoes for nothing. The abler a man is, the more dexterous, the shrewder,\r\nthe bolder, why, the more dangerous he is if he has not the root of\r\nright living and right thinking in him—and that in private life, and\r\neven more in public life.\r\n\r\n¶Exactly as in time of war, although you need in each fighting man far\r\nmore than courage, yet all else counts for nothing if there is not that\r\ncourage upon which to base it; so in our civil life, although we need\r\nthat the average man in private life, that the average public servant,\r\nshall have far more than honesty, yet all other qualities go for nothing\r\nor for worse than nothing unless honesty underlie them—not only the\r\nhonesty that keeps its skirts technically clear, but the honesty that is\r\nsuch according to the spirit as well as the letter of the law; the\r\nhonesty that is aggressive, the honesty that not merely deplores\r\ncorruption,—it is easy enough to deplore corruption,—but that wars\r\nagainst it and tramples it under foot.\r\n\r\n¶¶I ask for that type of honesty, I ask for militant honesty, for the\r\nhonesty of the kind that makes those who have it discontented with\r\nthemselves as long as they have failed to do everything that in them\r\nlies to stamp out dishonesty wherever it can be found, in high place or\r\nin low. And let us not flatter ourselves, we who live in countries where\r\nthe people rule, that it is ultimately possible for the people to cast\r\nupon any but themselves the responsibilities for the shape the\r\ngovernment and the social and political life of the community assume. I\r\nask, then, that our people feel quickened within them indignation\r\nagainst wrong in every shape, and condemnation of that wrong, whether\r\nfound in private or in public life.\r\n\r\n¶We have a right to demand courage of every man who wears the uniform;\r\nit is not so much a credit to him to have it as it is shame unutterable\r\nto him if he lacks it. So when we demand honesty we demand it not as\r\nentitling the possessor to praise, but as warranting the heartiest\r\ncondemnation possible if he lacks it. Surely in every movement for the\r\nbetterment of our life, our life social in the truest and deepest sense,\r\nour life political, we have a special right to ask not merely support,\r\nbut leadership from those of the Church. We ask that you to whom much\r\nhas been given will remember that from you rightly much will be expected\r\nin return. For all of us here the lines have been cast in pleasant\r\nplaces. Each of us has been given one talent, or five, or ten talents,\r\nand each of us is in honor bound to use that talent or those talents\r\naright, and to show at the end that he is entitled to the praise of\r\nhaving done well as a faithful servant.[31]\r\n\r\n¶Steps have been taken by the State Department looking to the making of\r\nbribery an extraditable offence with foreign powers. The need of more\r\neffective treaties covering this crime is manifest. The exposures and\r\nprosecutions of official corruption in St. Louis, Mo., and other cities\r\nand States have resulted in a number of givers and takers of bribes\r\nbecoming fugitives in foreign lands. Bribery has not been included in\r\nextradition treaties heretofore, as the necessity has not arisen. While\r\nthere may have been as much official corruption in former years, there\r\nhas been more developed and brought to light in the immediate past than\r\nin the preceding century of our country’s history.\r\n\r\n¶It should be the policy of the United States to leave no place on earth\r\nwhere a corrupt man fleeing from this country can rest in peace. There\r\nis no reason why bribery should not be included in all treaties as\r\nextraditable. The recent amended treaty with Mexico, whereby this crime\r\nwas put in the list of extraditable offences, has established a salutary\r\nprecedent in this regard. Under this treaty the State Department has\r\nasked, and Mexico has granted, the extradition of one of the St. Louis\r\nbribe-givers.\r\n\r\n¶There can be no crime more serious than bribery. Other offenses violate\r\none law, while corruption strikes at the foundation of all law. Under\r\nour form of government all authority is vested in the people and by them\r\ndelegated to those who represent them in official capacity. There can be\r\nno offence heavier than that of him in whom such a sacred trust has been\r\nreposed, who sells it for his own gain and enrichment; and no less heavy\r\nis the offence of the bribe-giver.\r\n\r\n¶He is worse than the thief, for the thief robs the individual, while\r\nthe corrupt official plunders an entire city or State. He is as wicked\r\nas the murderer, for the murderer may only take one life against the\r\nlaw, while the corrupt official and the man who corrupts the official\r\nalike aim at the assassination of the commonwealth itself. Government of\r\nthe people, by the people, for the people will perish from the face of\r\nthe earth if bribery is tolerated. The givers and takers of bribes stand\r\non an evil pre-eminence of infamy. The exposure and punishment of public\r\ncorruption is an honor to a nation, not a disgrace. The shame lies in\r\ntoleration, not in correction.\r\n\r\n¶No city or State, still less the Nation, can be injured by the\r\nenforcement of law. As long as public plunderers when detected can find\r\na haven of refuge in any foreign land and avoid punishment, just so long\r\nencouragement is given them to continue their practices. If we fail to\r\ndo all that in us lies to stamp out corruption we cannot escape our\r\nshare of responsibility for the guilt. The first requisite of successful\r\nself-government is unflinching enforcement of the law and the cutting\r\nout of corruption.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                          The Monroe Doctrine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine is not a part of international law. But it is the\r\nfundamental feature of our entire foreign policy so far as the Western\r\nHemisphere is concerned, and it has more and more been meeting with\r\nrecognition abroad. The reason why it is meeting with this recognition\r\nis because we have not allowed it to become fossilized, but have adapted\r\nour construction of it to meet the growing, changing needs of this\r\nhemisphere. Fossilization, of course, means death, whether to an\r\nindividual, a government, or a doctrine.\r\n\r\nIt is out of the question to claim a right and yet shirk the\r\nresponsibility for exercising that right, when we announce a policy such\r\nas the Monroe Doctrine we thereby commit ourselves to accepting the\r\nconsequences of the policy and these consequences from time to time\r\nalter.\r\n\r\n¶Let us look for a moment at what the Monroe Doctrine really is. It\r\nforbids the territorial encroachment of non-American powers on American\r\nsoil. Its purpose is partly to secure this Nation against seeing great\r\nmilitary powers obtain new footholds in the Western Hemisphere, and\r\npartly to secure to our fellow republics south of us the chance to\r\ndevelop along their own lines without being oppressed or conquered by\r\nnon-American powers. As we have grown more and more powerful our\r\nadvocacy of this doctrine has been received with more and more respect;\r\nbut what has tended most to give the Doctrine standing among the nations\r\nis our growing willingness to show that we not only mean what we say and\r\nare prepared to back it up, but that we mean to recognize our\r\nobligations to foreign peoples no less than to insist upon our own\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n¶We cannot permanently adhere to the Monroe Doctrine unless we succeed\r\nin making it evident in the first place that we do not intend to treat\r\nit in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandisement on our part at\r\nthe expense of the republics to the south of us; second that we do not\r\nintend to permit it to be used by any of those republics as a shield to\r\nprotect that republic from the consequences of its own misdeeds against\r\nforeign nations; third, that inasmuch as by this doctrine we prevent\r\nother nations from interfering on this side of the water, we shall\r\nourselves in good faith try to help those of our sister republics, which\r\nneed such help, upward toward peace and order.\r\n\r\n¶As regards the first point we must recognize the fact that in some\r\nSouth American countries there has been much suspicion lest we should\r\ninterpret the Monroe Doctrine in some way inimical to their interests.\r\nNow let it be understood once for all that no just and orderly\r\ngovernment on this continent has anything to fear from us. There are\r\ncertain of the republics south of us which have already reached such a\r\npoint of stability, order and prosperity that they are themselves,\r\nalthough as yet hardly consciously, among the guarantors of this\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n¶No stable and growing American republic wishes to see some great\r\nnon-American military power acquire territory in its neighborhood. It is\r\nthe interest of all of us on this continent that no such event should\r\noccur, and in addition to our own Republic there are now already\r\nrepublics in the regions south of us which have reached a point of\r\nprosperity and power that enables them to be considerable factors in\r\nmaintaining this doctrine which is so much to the advantage of all of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n¶It must be understood that under no circumstances will the United\r\nStates use the Monroe Doctrine as a cloak for territorial aggression.\r\nShould any of our neighbors, no matter how turbulent, how disregardful\r\nof our rights, finally get into such a position that the utmost limits\r\nof our forbearance are reached, all the people south of us may rest\r\nassured that no action will ever be taken save what is absolutely\r\ndemanded by our self-respect; that this action will not take the form of\r\nterritorial aggrandisement on our part, and that it will only be taken\r\nat all with the most extreme reluctance and not without having exhausted\r\nevery effort to avert it.\r\n\r\n¶As to the second point, if a republic to the south of us commits a tort\r\nagainst a foreign nation, such for instance, as wrongful action against\r\nthe persons or citizens of that nation, then the Monroe Doctrine does\r\nnot force us to interfere to prevent punishment of the tort, save to see\r\nthat the punishment does not directly or indirectly assume the form of\r\nterritorial occupation of the offending country. The case is more\r\ndifficult when the trouble comes from the failure to meet contractual\r\nobligations. Our own government has always refused to enforce such\r\ncontractual obligations on behalf of its citizens by the appeal to arms.\r\nIt is much to be wished that all foreign Governments would take the same\r\nview, but at present this country would certainly not be willing to go\r\nto war to prevent a foreign Government from collecting a just debt, or\r\nto back up some one of our sister republics in a refusal to pay just\r\ndebts, and the alternative may in any case prove to be that we shall\r\nourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as\r\nis possible of the just obligations shall be paid. Personally, I should\r\nalways prefer to see this country step in and put through such an\r\narrangement rather than let any foreign country undertake it.\r\n\r\n¶I do not want to see any foreign power take possession permanently or\r\ntemporarily of the Custom Houses of an American republic in order to\r\nenforce its obligations, and the alternative may at any time be that we\r\nshall be forced to do so ourselves.\r\n\r\n¶Finally, and what is in my view really the most important thing of all,\r\nit is our duty, so far as we are able, to try to help upward our weaker\r\nbrothers. Just as there has been a gradual growth of the ethical element\r\nin the relations of one individual to another, so that with all the\r\nfaults of our Christian civilization it yet remains true that we are, no\r\nmatter how slowly, more and more coming to recognize the duty of bearing\r\none another’s burdens, similarly I believe that the ethical element is\r\nby degrees entering into the dealings of one nation with another. Under\r\nstrain of emotion caused by sudden disaster this feeling is very\r\nevident. A famine or a plague in our country brings much sympathy and\r\nsome assistance from other countries. Moreover, we are now beginning to\r\nrecognize that weaker peoples have a claim upon us, even when the appeal\r\nis made, not to our emotions by some sudden calamity, but to our\r\nconsciences by a long-continuing condition of affairs.\r\n\r\n¶I do not mean to say that nations have more than begun to approach the\r\nproper relationship one to another, and I fully recognize the folly of\r\nproceeding upon the assumption that this ideal condition can now be\r\nrealized in full for, in order to proceed upon such an assumption, we\r\nwould first require some method of forcing recalcitrant nations to do\r\ntheir duty, as well as of seeing that they are protected in their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n¶In the interest of justice it is as necessary to exercise the police\r\npower as to show charity and helpful generosity. But something can even\r\nnow be done toward the end in view. That something, for instance, this\r\nnation has already done as regards Cuba, and is now trying to do as\r\nregards Santa Domingo. There are few things in our history in which we\r\nshould take more genuine pride than the way in which we liberated Cuba,\r\nand then, instead of instantly abandoning it to chaos, stayed in\r\ndirection of the affairs of the island until we had put it on the right\r\npath, and finally gave it freedom and helped it as it started on the\r\nlife of an independent republic.[30]\r\n\r\nBoasting and blustering are as objectionable among nations as among\r\nindividuals, and the public men of a great nation owe it to their sense\r\nof national self-respect to speak courteously of foreign powers just as\r\na brave and self-respecting man treats all around him courteously. But\r\nthough to boast is bad and causelessly to insult another, worse; yet\r\nworse than all is it to be guilty of boasting, even without insult, and\r\nwhen called to the proof to be unable to make such boasting good. There\r\nis a homely old adage which runs: “Speak softly and carry a big stick;\r\nyou will go far.” If the American nation will speak softly and yet\r\nbuild, and keep at a pitch of the highest training, a thoroughly\r\nefficient navy, the Monroe Doctrine will go far. I ask you to think over\r\nthis. If you do, you will come to the conclusion that it is mere plain\r\ncommon-sense, so obviously sound that only the blind can fail to see its\r\ntruth and only the weakest and most irresolute can fail to desire to put\r\nit into force.[32]\r\n\r\n¶One of the most effective instruments for peace is the Monroe Doctrine\r\nas it has been and is being gradually developed by this Nation and\r\naccepted by other nations. No other policy could have been as efficient\r\nin promoting peace in the Western Hemisphere and in giving to each\r\nnation thereon the chance to develop along its own lines. If we had\r\nrefused to apply the Doctrine to changing conditions it would now be\r\ncompletely outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present day,\r\nand indeed would probably by this time have sunk into complete oblivion.\r\nIt is useful at home, and is meeting with recognition abroad because we\r\nhave adapted our application of it to meet the growing and changing\r\nneeds of the Hemisphere. When we announce a policy, such as the Monroe\r\nDoctrine, we thereby commit ourselves to the consequences of the policy,\r\nand those consequences from time to time alter. It is out of the\r\nquestion to claim a right and yet shirk the responsibility for its\r\nexercise. Not only we, but all American Republics who are benefited by\r\nthe existence of the Doctrine, must recognize the obligations each\r\nnation is under as regards foreign peoples no less than its duty to\r\ninsist upon its own rights.\r\n\r\nThat our rights and interests are deeply concerned in the maintenance of\r\nthe Doctrine is so clear as hardly to need argument. This is especially\r\ntrue in view of the construction of the Panama Canal. As a mere matter\r\nof self-defense we must exercise a close watch over the approaches to\r\nthis canal; and this means that we must be thoroughly alive to our\r\ninterests in the Caribbean Sea.[14]\r\n\r\n¶The Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign\r\npolicy of all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United\r\nStates. Just seventy-eight years have passed since President Monroe in\r\nhis Annual Message announced that “The American continents are\r\nhenceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by\r\nany European power.”\r\n\r\n¶In other words, the Monroe Doctrine is a declaration that there must be\r\nno territorial aggrandizement by any non-American power at the expense\r\nof any American power on American soil. It is in no wise intended as\r\nhostile to any nation in the Old World. Still less is it intended to\r\ngive cover to any aggression by one New World power at the expense of\r\nany other. It is simply a step, and a long step, toward assuring the\r\nuniversal peace of the world by securing the possibility of permanent\r\npeace on this hemisphere.\r\n\r\n¶During the past century other influences have established the\r\npermanence and independence of the smaller states of Europe. Through the\r\nMonroe Doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like independence and\r\nsecure like permanence for the lesser among the New World nations.\r\n\r\n¶This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any\r\nAmerican power, save that it in truth allows each of them to form such\r\nas it desires. In other words, it is really a guaranty of the commercial\r\nindependence of the Americans. We do not ask under this doctrine for any\r\nexclusive commercial dealings with any other American state. We do not\r\nguarantee any state against punishment if it misconducts itself,\r\nprovided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of\r\nterritory by any non-American power.\r\n\r\n¶Our attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith. We\r\nhave not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense of\r\nany of our neighbors. We wish to work with them hand in hand, so that\r\nall of us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice over the good fortune\r\nof any of them, we gladly hail their material prosperity and political\r\nstability, and are concerned and alarmed if any of them fall into\r\nindustrial or political chaos. We do not wish to see any Old World\r\nmilitary power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to become a\r\nmilitary power ourselves. The peoples of the Americas can prosper best\r\nif left to work out their own salvation in their own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                           The World’s Peace\r\n\r\n\r\nMore and more war is coming to be looked upon as in itself a lamentable\r\nand evil thing. A wanton or useless war, or a war of mere aggression—in\r\nshort, any war begun or carried on in a conscienceless spirit, is to be\r\ncondemned as a peculiarly atrocious crime against all humanity. We can,\r\nhowever, do nothing of permanent value for peace unless we keep ever\r\nclearly in mind the ethical element which lies at the root of the\r\nproblem. Our aim is righteousness. Peace is normally the handmaiden of\r\nrighteousness; but when peace and righteousness conflict then a great\r\nand upright people can never for a moment hesitate to follow the path\r\nwhich leads towards righteousness, even though that path also leads to\r\nwar. There are persons who advocate peace at any price; there are others\r\nwho, following a false analogy, think that because it is no longer\r\nnecessary in civilized countries for individuals to protect their rights\r\nwith a strong hand, it is therefore unnecessary for nations to be ready\r\nto defend their rights. These persons would do irreparable harm to any\r\nnation that adopted their principles, and even as it is they seriously\r\nhamper the cause which they advocate by tending to render it absurd in\r\nthe eyes of sensible and patriotic men.\r\n\r\n¶There can be no worse foe of mankind in general, and of his own country\r\nin particular, than the demagogue of war, the man who in mere folly or\r\nto serve his own selfish ends continually rails at and abuses other\r\nnations, who seeks to excite his countrymen against foreigners on\r\ninsufficient pretexts, who excites and inflames a perverse and\r\naggressive national vanity, and who may on occasions wantonly bring on\r\nconflict between his nation and some other nation. But there are\r\ndemagogues of peace just as there are demagogues of war, and in any such\r\nmovements as that for The Hague conference it is essential not to be\r\nmisled by one set of extremists any more than by the other.\r\n\r\n¶Whenever it is possible for a nation or an individual to work for real\r\npeace, assuredly it is failure of duty not so to strive; but if war is\r\nnecessary and righteous then either the man or the nation shrinking from\r\nit forfeits all title to self-respect. We have scant sympathy with the\r\nsentimentalist who dreads oppression less than physical suffering, who\r\nwould prefer a shameful peace to the pain and toil sometimes lamentably\r\nnecessary in order to secure a righteous peace. As yet there is only a\r\npartial and imperfect analogy between international law and internal or\r\nmunicipal law, because there is no sanction of force for executing the\r\nformer while there is in the case of the latter.\r\n\r\n¶The private citizen is protected in his rights by the law, because the\r\nlaw rests in the last resort upon force exercised through the forms of\r\nlaw. A man does not have to defend his rights with his own hand, because\r\nhe can call upon the police, upon the sheriff’s posse, upon the militia,\r\nor in extreme cases upon the Army, to defend him. But there is no such\r\nsanction of force for international law. At present there could be no\r\ngreater calamity than for the free peoples, the enlightened,\r\nindependent, and peace-loving peoples, to disarm while yet leaving it\r\nopen to any barbarism or despotism to remain armed.\r\n\r\n¶So long as the world is as unorganized as now, the armies and navies of\r\nthose peoples who on the whole stand for justice, offer not only the\r\nbest, but the only possible, security for a just peace. For instance, if\r\nthe United States alone, or in company only with the other nations that\r\non the whole tend to act justly, disarmed, we might sometimes avoid\r\nbloodshed, but we would cease to be of weight in securing the peace of\r\njustice—the real peace for which the most law-abiding and high-minded\r\nmen must at times be willing to fight. As the world is now, only that\r\nnation is equipped for peace that knows how to fight and that will not\r\nshrink from fighting if ever the conditions become such that war is\r\ndemanded in the name of the highest morality.\r\n\r\n¶So much it is emphatically necessary to say in order both that the\r\nposition of the United States may not be misunderstood, and that a\r\ngenuine effort to bring nearer the day of the peace of justice among the\r\nnations may not be hampered by a folly which, in striving to achieve the\r\nimpossible, would render it hopeless to attempt the achievement of the\r\npractical. But while recognizing most clearly all above set forth, it\r\nremains our clear duty to strive in every practicable way to bring\r\nnearer the time when the sword shall not be the arbiter among nations.\r\n\r\n¶At present the practical thing to do is to try to minimize the number\r\nof cases in which it must be the arbiter, and to offer, at least to all\r\ncivilized powers, some substitute for war which will be available in at\r\nleast a considerable number of instances. Very much can be done through\r\nanother Hague conference in this direction, and I most earnestly urge\r\nthat this Nation do all in its power to try to further the movement and\r\nto make the result of the decisions of The Hague conference effective. I\r\nearnestly hope that the conference may be able to devise some way to\r\nmake arbitration between nations the customary way of settling\r\ninternational disputes in all save a few classes of cases, which should\r\nthemselves be as sharply defined and rigidly limited as the present\r\ngovernmental and social development of the world will permit. If\r\npossible, there should be a general arbitration treaty negotiated among\r\nall the nations represented at the conference. Neutral rights and\r\nproperty should be protected at sea as they are protected on land. There\r\nshould be an international agreement to this purpose and a similar\r\nagreement defining contraband of war.\r\n\r\n¶During the last century there has been a distinct diminution in the\r\nnumber of wars between the most civilized nations. International\r\nrelations have become closer, and the development of The Hague tribunal\r\nis not only a symptom of this growing closeness of relationship, but is\r\na means by which the growth can be furthered. Our aim should be from\r\ntime to time to take such steps as may be possible toward creating\r\nsomething like an organization of the civilized nations, because as the\r\nworld becomes more highly organized the need for navies and armies will\r\ndiminish.\r\n\r\n¶It is not possible to secure anything like an immediate disarmament,\r\nbecause it would first be necessary to settle what peoples are on the\r\nwhole a menace to the rest of mankind, and to provide against the\r\ndisarmament of the rest being turned into a movement which would really\r\nchiefly benefit these obnoxious peoples; but it may be possible to\r\nexercise some check upon the tendency to swell indefinitely the budgets\r\nfor military expenditure.\r\n\r\nOf course such an effort could succeed only if it did not attempt to do\r\ntoo much; and if it were undertaken in a spirit of sanity as far removed\r\nas possible from a merely hysterical pseudo-philanthropy. It is worth\r\nwhile pointing out that since the end of the insurrection in the\r\nPhilippines this Nation has shown its practical faith in the policy of\r\ndisarmament by reducing its little army one-third. But disarmament can\r\nnever be of prime importance; there is more need to get rid of the\r\ncauses of war than of the implements of war.\r\n\r\n¶I have dwelt much on the dangers to be avoided by steering clear of any\r\nmere foolish sentimentality because my wish for peace is so genuine and\r\nearnest; because I have a real and great desire that this second Hague\r\nconference may mark a long stride forward in the direction of securing\r\nthe peace of justice throughout the world. No object is better worthy\r\nthe attention of enlightened statesmanship than the establishment of a\r\nsurer method than now exists of securing justice as between nations,\r\nboth for the protection of the little nations and for the prevention of\r\nwar between the big nations. To this aim we should endeavor not only to\r\navert bloodshed, but, above all, effectively to strengthen the forces of\r\nright. The Golden Rule should be, and as the world grows in morality it\r\nwill be, the guiding rule of conduct among nations as among individuals;\r\nthough the Golden Rule must not be construed, in fantastic manner, as\r\nforbidding the exercise of the police power. This mighty and free\r\nRepublic should ever deal with all other states, great or small, on a\r\nbasis of high honor, respecting their rights as jealously as it\r\nsafeguards its own.[14]\r\n\r\n¶Among Washington’s maxims which he bequeathed to his countrymen were\r\nthe following: “Observe good faith and justice toward all nations” and\r\n“To be prepared for war is the most effective means to promote peace.”\r\nThese two principles taken together should form the basis of our whole\r\nforeign policy. Neither is sufficient taken by itself. It is not merely\r\nan idle dream but a most mischievous dream to believe that mere\r\nrefraining from wrong-doing will insure us against being wronged. Yet,\r\non the other hand, a nation prepared for war is a menace to mankind\r\nunless the national purpose is to treat other nations with good faith\r\nand justice. In any community it is neither the conscientious man who is\r\na craven at heart nor yet the bold and strong without the moral sense,\r\nwho is of real use to the community, it is the man who to strength and\r\ncourage adds a realizing sense of the moral obligations resting upon\r\nhim, the man who has not only the desire but the power to do his full\r\nduty by his neighbor and by the State.\r\n\r\n¶So in the world at large the nation which is of use in the progress of\r\nmankind is that nation which combines strength of character, force of\r\ncharacter and insistence upon its own rights, with a full acknowledgment\r\nof its own duties toward them.\r\n\r\n¶Just at present the best way in which we can show that our loyalty to\r\nthe teachings of Washington is a loyalty of the heart and not of the\r\nlips only is to see to it that the work of building up our Navy goes\r\nsteadily on, and that at the same time our stand for international\r\nrighteousness is clear and emphatic.\r\n\r\n¶Never since the beginning of our country’s history has the Navy been\r\nused in an unjust war. Never has it failed to render great and sometimes\r\nvital service to the Republic. It has not been too strong for our good,\r\nthough often not strong enough to do all the good it should have\r\ndone.... Our possession of the Philippines, our interest in the trade of\r\nthe Orient, our building the Isthmian Canal, our insistence upon the\r\nMonroe Doctrine all demand that our navy shall be of adequate size and,\r\nfor its size, of unsurpassed efficiency. If it is strong enough I\r\nbelieve it would minimize the chance of our being drawn into foreign\r\nwar. If we let it run down it is as certain as the day that sooner or\r\nlater we shall have to choose between a probably disastrous foreign war\r\nor a peace kept on terms that imply national humiliation.\r\n\r\n¶¶Our navy is the surest guaranty of peace and the cheapest insurance\r\nagainst war, and those who, in whatever capacity, have helped to build\r\nit up during the past twenty years have been in good faith observing and\r\nliving up to one of the most important of the principles which\r\nWashington laid down for the guidance of his countrymen. Nor was\r\nWashington the only one of our presidents who showed far-sighted\r\npatriotism by support of the Navy. When Andrew Jackson was in Congress\r\nhe voted for the first warships we ever built as part of our regular\r\nnavy, and he voted against the grant of money to pay an humiliating\r\ntribute to the pirates of the Barbary States. Old Hickory was a patriot\r\nthrough and through, and there was not an ounce of timidity in his\r\nnature, and of course he felt only indignant contempt for a policy which\r\npurchased an ignoble peace by cowardice instead of exacting a just peace\r\nby showing we were as little willing to submit to as to inflict\r\noppression. Had a majority of Jackson’s colleagues and successors felt\r\nas he did about the navy, had it been built up instead of being brought\r\nto a standstill, it would probably never have been necessary to fight\r\nthe War of 1812.\r\n\r\n¶With the great powers of the world we desire no rivalry that is not\r\nhonorable to both parties. We wish them well. We believe that the trend\r\nof the modern spirit is ever stronger toward peace, not war; toward\r\nfriendship, not hostility, as the normal international attitude. We are\r\nglad indeed that we are on good terms with all the other peoples of\r\nmankind, and no effort on our part shall be spared to secure a\r\ncontinuance of these relations. And remember that we shall be a potent\r\nfactor for peace largely in proportion to the way in which we make it\r\nevident that our attitude is due, not to weakness, not to inability to\r\ndefend ourselves, but to a genuine repugnance to wrong-doing, a genuine\r\ndesire for self-respecting friendship with our neighbors.\r\n\r\n¶The voice of the weakling or the craven counts for nothing when he\r\nclamors for peace; but the voice of the just man armed is potent. We\r\nneed to keep in a condition of preparedness, especially as regards our\r\nnavy, not because we want war, but because we desire to stand with those\r\nwhose plea for peace is listened to with respectful attention.[5]\r\n\r\n¶The true end of every great and free people should be self-respecting\r\npeace; and this Nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial\r\nfriendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years, wars\r\nbetween the great civilized powers have become less and less frequent.\r\nWars with barbarous or semi-barbarous peoples come in an entirely\r\ndifferent category, being merely a most regrettable but necessary\r\ninternational police duty which must be performed for the sake of the\r\nwelfare of mankind.\r\n\r\n¶Peace can only be kept with certainty where both sides wish to keep it;\r\nbut more and more the civilized peoples are realizing the wicked folly\r\nof war and are attaining that condition of just and intelligent regard\r\nfor the rights of others which will in the end, as we hope and believe,\r\nmake world-wide peace possible. The peace conference at The Hague gave\r\ndefinite expression to this hope and belief and marked a stride toward\r\ntheir attainment.\r\n\r\n¶Probably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace as\r\nwe are. There is not a single civilized power which has anything\r\nwhatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part. All we want is peace;\r\nand toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for\r\nour rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend to their\r\nrights in return, to insure fair treatment to us commercially, and to\r\nguarantee the safety of the American people.\r\n\r\n¶Our people intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon it\r\nas the one sure means of securing the peace of the Western Hemisphere.\r\nThe Navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the\r\nMonroe Doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever nation\r\nchooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which comes as of right to\r\nthe just man armed; not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the\r\ncraven and the weakling.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A Square Deal\r\n                                  and\r\n                              The Essence\r\n                                   of\r\n                          Christian Character\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that each one of us who has a large experience grows to realize\r\nmore and more that the essentials of experience are alike for all of us.\r\nThe things that move us most are the things of the home, of the Church;\r\nthe intimate relations that knit a man to his family, to his close\r\nfriends; that make him try to do his duty by his neighbor, by his God,\r\nare in their essentials just the same for one man as for another,\r\nprovided the man is in good faith trying to do his duty.\r\n\r\n¶I feel that the progress of our country really depends upon the sum of\r\nthe efforts of the individuals acting by themselves, but especially upon\r\nthe sum of the efforts of the individuals acting in associations for the\r\nbetterment of themselves, for the betterment of the communities in which\r\nthey dwell. There is never any difficulty about the forces of evil being\r\norganized. Every time that we get an organization of the forces that are\r\nplainly striving for good, we are doing our part to offset, and a little\r\nmore than offset the forces of evil.\r\n\r\n¶I want to read several different texts which it seems to me have\r\nespecial bearing upon the work of brotherhoods like this, upon the\r\nspirit in which not only all of us who are members of this brotherhood,\r\nbut all of us who strive to be decent Christians are to apply our\r\nChristianity on week days as well as on Sundays. The first verse I want\r\nto read can be found in the seventh chapter of Matthew, the first and\r\nsixteenth verses.\r\n\r\n¶First: “Judge not, that ye be not judged,” sixteenth, “Ye shall know\r\nthem by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs of\r\nthistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a\r\ncorrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth\r\nevil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.”\r\n\r\n¶“Judge not that ye be not judged.” That means, treat each of us his\r\nbrethren with charity. Be not quick to find fault. Above all be not\r\nquick to judge another man who according to his light is striving to do\r\nhis duty as each of us hopes he is striving to do his. Let us ever\r\nremember that we have not only divine authority for the statement that\r\nby our fruits we shall be known, but also that it is true that mankind\r\nwill tend to judge us by our fruits.\r\n\r\n¶It is an especially lamentable thing to see ill done by any man who\r\nfrom his associations with the Church, who from the fact that he has had\r\nthe priceless benefits of the teachings of Christian religion, should be\r\nexpected to take a position of leadership in the work for good.\r\n\r\n¶The next quotation I wish to read is found in the twenty-fifth chapter\r\nof Matthew, thirty-seventh to fortieth verses inclusive: “Then shall the\r\nrighteous answer them, saying, ‘Lord, when saw we thee a hungered, and\r\nfed thee, or thirsty, and gave thee drink?’\r\n\r\n¶“‘When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in, or naked, and clothed\r\nthee?’\r\n\r\n¶“‘Or, when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?’\r\n\r\n¶“And the King shall answer and say unto them, ‘Verily, I say unto you,\r\ninasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren\r\nye have done it unto me.’”\r\n\r\n¶That is what this brotherhood means; by trying to worship our Creator\r\nby acting toward his creatures as He would have us act; to try to make\r\nour religion a living force in our lives; to do unto others as we would\r\nhave them do unto us.\r\n\r\n¶The next text I wish to read is found in I Corinthians, thirteenth\r\nchapter, beginning, with the first verse. “Though I speak with the\r\ntongues of men and of angels, and have not charity I am become as\r\nsounding brass, as a tinkling cymbal.”\r\n\r\n¶“And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries,\r\nand all knowledge; and though I have all faith so that I would remove\r\nmountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.\r\n\r\n¶“And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give\r\nmy body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\r\nCharity suffereth long and is kind, charity envieth not, charity\r\nvaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.\r\n\r\n¶“And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three, but the greatest of\r\nthese is charity.”\r\n\r\n¶Let each of us exercise the largest tolerance for his brother who is\r\ntrying, though in a different way to lead a decent life; who is trying\r\nto do good in his own fashion; let each try to show practical sympathy\r\nwith that brother; not be too quick to criticise.\r\n\r\n¶In closing I want to read a few verses from the Epistle of James, from\r\nthe first chapter twenty-seventh verse:\r\n\r\n¶“Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this: To\r\nvisit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction and to keep\r\nhimself unspotted before the world.”\r\n\r\n¶If a man will try to serve God the Father by being kindly to the many\r\naround him who need such kindness and by being upright and honest\r\nhimself, then we have the authority of the Good Book for saying that we\r\nare in honor bound to treat him as a good Christian and extend the hand\r\nof brotherhood to him.\r\n\r\n¶Every thinking man, when he thinks, realizes what a very large\r\nnumber of people tend to forget that the teachings of the Bible are\r\nso interwoven and entwined with our whole civic and social life that\r\nit would be literally—I do not mean figuratively, I mean\r\nliterally—impossible for us to figure to ourselves what this life\r\nwould be if these teachings were removed. We would lose almost all\r\nthe standards by which we now judge both public and private morals;\r\nall the standards toward which we, with more or less resolution,\r\nstrive to raise ourselves. Almost every man who has, by his life\r\nwork, added to the sum of human achievement of which the race is\r\nproud, of which our people are proud, almost every such man has\r\nbased his life work largely upon the teachings of the Bible.\r\nSometimes it has been done unconsciously, more often consciously,\r\nand among the very greatest men a disproportionately large number\r\nhave been diligent and close students of the Bible at first hand.\r\n\r\n¶Lincoln,—sad, patient, kindly Lincoln, who after bearing upon his weary\r\nshoulders for four years a greater burden than that borne by any other\r\nman of the Nineteenth Century, laid down his life for the people whom,\r\nliving, he had served so well,—built up his entire reading upon his\r\nearly study of the Bible. He had mastered it absolutely; mastered it as,\r\nlater he mastered only one or two other books, notably Shakespeare;\r\nmastered it so that he became almost a man of one book, who knew that\r\nbook and who instinctively put into practice what he had been taught\r\ntherein; and he left his life as a part of the crowning work of the\r\nNineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n¶You may look through the Bible from cover to cover, and nowhere will\r\nyou find a line that can be construed into an apology for the man of\r\nbrains who sins against the light. On the contrary, in the Bible, taking\r\nthat as a guide, you will find that because much has been given to you\r\nmuch will be expected of you, and a heavier condemnation is to be\r\nvisited upon the able man who goes wrong than upon his weaker brother\r\nwho cannot do the harm that the other does, because it is not in him to\r\ndo it. I plead, not merely for training of the mind, but for the moral\r\nand spiritual training of the home and the church; the moral and\r\nspiritual training that have always been found in, and that have ever\r\naccompanied the study of this book; this book, which, in almost every\r\ncivilized tongue, can be described as ‘The Book,’ with the certainty of\r\nall understanding you when you so describe it.\r\n\r\n¶The immense moral influence of the Bible, though of course, infinitely\r\nthe most important, is not the only power it has for good. In addition\r\nthere is the increasing influence it exerts on the side of good taste,\r\nof good literature, of proper sense of proportion, of simple and\r\nstraightforward writing and thinking.\r\n\r\n¶The Bible does not teach us to shirk difficulties, but to overcome\r\nthem. That is a lesson that each one of us who has children is bound in\r\nhonor to teach these children if he or she expects to see them become\r\nfitted to play the part of men and women in our world.\r\n\r\n¶If we read the Bible aright we read a book which teaches us to go forth\r\nand do the work of the Lord; to do the work of the Lord in the world as\r\nwe find it; to try to make things better in this world, even if only a\r\nlittle better, because we have lived in it. That kind of work can be\r\ndone only by the man who is neither a weakling nor a coward, by the man\r\nwho, in the fullest sense of the word is a true Christian—like Great\r\nHeart, Bunyan’s hero. We plead for a closer and wider and deeper study\r\nof the Bible, so that our people may be in fact as well as in theory,\r\n‘doers of the word, and not hearers only.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            REFERENCE NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figures which appear in the text have reference to the source from\r\nwhich that particular extract was made, and the reader can refer here if\r\nneed be to the occasion and time when such words were uttered. Of course\r\neverything of a purely local or ephemeral nature has been omitted, and\r\nonly the more vital truths which concern our daily lives and the\r\ncommonweal have been gathered here, and these the average reader will\r\nfind a help and guide in which he will be inclined to put an abiding\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A:\r\n\r\n  National Teachers Association.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  From an address before the Hungarian Club, N.
