Mr. John Quincy\r\nAdams, recalling, perhaps, the death of his own father and of Jefferson\r\non the same Fourth of July, and that of Monroe on a subsequent\r\nanniversary of that day, may possibly have seen a generous propriety in\r\nfinding some equally appropriate commemoration for the death of another\r\nVirginian President. For it was quite possible that Virginia might think\r\nhim capable of an attempt to conceal, what to her mind would seem to be\r\nan obvious intention of Providence: that all the children of the \"Mother\r\nof Presidents\" should be no less distinguished in their deaths than in\r\ntheir lives--that the \"other dynasty,\" which John Randolph was wont to\r\ntalk about, should no longer pretend to an equality with them, not\r\nmerely in this world, but in the manner of going out of it. At any\r\nrate, he notes the date of Madison's death, the twenty-eighth day of\r\nJune, as \"the anniversary of the day on which the ratification of the\r\nConvention of Virginia in 1788 had affixed the seal of James Madison as\r\nthe father of the Constitution of the United States, when his earthly\r\npart sank without a struggle into the grave, and a spirit, bright as the\r\nseraphim that surround the throne of Omnipotence, ascended to the bosom\r\nof his God.\" There can be no doubt of the deep sincerity of this\r\ntribute, whatever question there may be of its grammatical construction\r\nand its rhetoric, and although the date is erroneous. The ratification\r\nof the Constitution of the United States by the Virginia Convention was\r\non June 25, not on June 28. It is the misfortune of our time that we\r\nhave no living great men held in such universal veneration that their\r\ndying on common days like common mortals seems quite impossible. Half a\r\ncentury ago, however, the propriety of such providential arrangements\r\nappears to have been recognized almost as one of the \"institutions.\" It\r\nwas the newspaper gossip of that time that a \"distinguished physician\"\r\ndeclared that he would have kept a fourth ex-President alive to die on a\r\nFourth of July, had the illustrious sick man been under his treatment.\r\nThe patient himself, had he been consulted, might, in that case,\r\npossibly have declined to have a fatal illness prolonged a week to\r\ngratify the public fondness for patriotic coincidence. But Mr. Adams's\r\nappropriation of another anniversary answered all the purpose, for that\r\nhe made a mistake as to the date does not seem to have been discovered.\r\n\r\nIt was accidental that Port Conway was the birthplace of Madison. His\r\nmaternal grandfather, whose name was Conway, had a plantation at that\r\nplace, and young Mrs. Madison happened to be there on a visit to her\r\nmother when her first child, James, was born. In the stately--not to say\r\nstilted--biography of him by William C. Rives, the christened name of\r\nthis lady is given as Eleanor. Mr. Rives may have thought it not in\r\naccordance with ancestral dignity that the mother of so distinguished a\r\nson should have been burdened with so commonplace and homely a name as\r\nNelly. But we are afraid it is true that Nelly was her name. No other\r\nbiographer than Mr. Rives, that we know of, calls her Eleanor. Even\r\nMadison himself permits \"Nelly\" to pass under his eyes and from his\r\nhands as his mother's name.\r\n\r\nIn 1833-34 there was some correspondence between him and Lyman C.\r\nDraper, the historian, which includes some notes upon the Madison\r\ngenealogy. These, the ex-President writes, were \"made out by a member of\r\nthe family,\" and they may be considered, therefore, as having his\r\nsanction. The first record is, that \"James Madison was the son of James\r\nMadison and Nelly Conway.\" On such authority Nelly, and not Eleanor,\r\nmust be accepted as the mother's name. This, of course, is to be\r\nregretted from the Rives point of view; but perhaps the name had a less\r\nfamiliar sound a century and a half ago; and no doubt it was chosen by\r\nher parents without a thought that their daughter might go into history\r\nas the mother of a President, or that any higher fortune could befall\r\nher than to be the respectable head of a tobacco planter's family on the\r\nbanks of the Rappahannock.\r\n\r\nThis genealogical record further says that \"his [Madison's] ancestors,\r\non both sides, were not among the most wealthy of the country, but in\r\nindependent and comfortable circumstances.\" If this comment was added at\r\nthe ex-President's own dictation, it was quite in accordance with his\r\nunpretentious character.[1] One might venture to say as much of a\r\nNorthern or a Western farmer. But they did not farm in Virginia; they\r\nplanted. Mr. Rives says that the elder James was \"a large landed\r\nproprietor;\" and he adds, \"a large landed estate in Virginia ... was a\r\nmimic commonwealth, with its foreign and domestic relations, and its\r\nregular administrative hierarchy.\" The \"foreign relations\" were the\r\nshipping, once a year, a few hogsheads of tobacco to a London factor;\r\nthe \"mimic commonwealths\" were clusters of negro huts; and the\r\n\"administrative hierarchy\" was the priest, who was more at home at the\r\ntavern or a horse-race than in the discharge of his clerical duties.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Madison had only to say of his immediate ancestors--which seems\r\nto be all he knew about them--that they were in \"independent and\r\ncomfortable circumstances,\" so he was, apparently, as little inclined to\r\ntalk about himself; even at that age when it is supposed that men who\r\nhave enjoyed celebrity find their own lives the most agreeable of\r\nsubjects. In answer to Dr. Draper's inquiries he wrote this modest\r\nletter, now for the first time published:--\r\n\r\nMONTPELLIER, _August 9, 1833_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since your letter of the 3d of June came to hand, my\r\nincreasing age and continued maladies, with the many attentions due from\r\nme, had caused a delay in acknowledging it, for which these\r\ncircumstances must be an apology, in your case, as I have been obliged\r\nto make them in others.\r\n\r\nYou wish me to refer you to sources of printed information on my career\r\nin life, and it would afford me pleasure to do so; but my recollection\r\non the subject is very defective. It occurs [to me] that there was a\r\nbiographical volume in an enlarged edition compiled by General or Judge\r\nRodgers of Pennsylvania, and which may perhaps have included my name,\r\namong others. When or where it was published I cannot say. To this\r\nreference I can only add generally the newspapers at the seat of\r\ngovernment and elsewhere during the electioneering periods, when I was\r\none of the objects under review. I need scarcely remark that a life,\r\nwhich has been so much a public life, must of course be traced in the\r\npublic transactions in which it was involved, and that the most\r\nimportant of them are to be found in documents already in print, or soon\r\nto be so.\r\n\r\n   With friendly respects, JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n   LYMAN C. DRAPER, Lockport, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe genealogical statement, it will be observed, does not go farther\r\nback than Mr. Madison's great-grandfather, John. Mr. Rives supposes that\r\nthis John was the son of another John who, as \"the pious researches of\r\nkindred have ascertained,\" took out a patent for land about 1653 between\r\nthe North and York rivers on the shores of Chesapeake Bay. The same\r\nwriter further assumes that this John was descended from Captain Isaac\r\nMadison, whose name appears \"in a document in the State Paper Office at\r\nLondon containing a list of the Colonists in 1623.\" From Sainsbury's\r\nCalendar[2] we learn something more of this Captain Isaac than this mere\r\nmention. Under date of January 24, 1623, there is this record: \"Captain\r\nPowell, gunner, of James City, is dead; Capt. Nuce (?), Capt. Maddison,\r\nLieut. Craddock's brother, and divers more of the chief men reported\r\ndead.\" But either the report was not altogether true or there was\r\nanother Isaac Maddison, for the name appears among the signatures to a\r\nletter dated about a month later--February 20--from the governor,\r\ncouncil, and Assembly of Virginia to the king. It is of record, also,\r\nthat four months later still, on June 4, \"Capt. Isaac and Mary Maddison\"\r\nwere before the governor and council as witnesses in the case of\r\nGreville Pooley and Cicely Jordan, between whom there was a \"supposed\r\ncontract of marriage,\" made \"three or four days after her husband's\r\ndeath.\" But the lively widow, it seems, afterward \"contracted herself to\r\nWill Ferrar before the governor and council, and disavowed the former\r\ncontract,\" and the case therefore became so complicated that the court\r\nwas \"not able to decide so nice a difference.\" What Captain Isaac and\r\nMary Maddison knew about the matter the record does not tell us; but the\r\nevidence is conclusive that if there was but one Isaac Maddison in\r\nVirginia in 1623 he did not die in January of that year. Probably there\r\nwas but one, and he, as Rives assumes, was the Captain Madyson of whose\r\n\"achievement,\" as Rives calls it, there is a brief narrative in John\r\nSmith's \"General History of Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the record in Sainsbury's Calendar of the rumor of the death of\r\nthis Isaac in Virginia, in January, 1623, his signature to a letter to\r\nthe king in February, and his appearance as a witness before the council\r\nin the case of the widow Jordan, in June, it appears by Hotten's Lists\r\nof colonists, taken from the Records in the English State Paper\r\nDepartment, that Captain Isacke Maddeson and Mary Maddeson were living\r\nin 1624 at West and Sherlow Hundred Island. The next year, at the same\r\nplace, he is on the list of dead; and there is given under the same date\r\n\"The muster of Mrs. Mary Maddison, widow, aged 30 years.\" Her family\r\nconsisted of \"Katherin Layden, child, aged 7 years,\" and two servants.\r\nKatherine, it may be assumed, was the daughter of the widow Mary and\r\nCaptain Isaac, and their only child. These \"musters,\" it should be said,\r\nappear always to have been made with great care, and there is therefore\r\nhardly a possibility that a son, if there were one, was omitted in the\r\nnumeration of the widow's family, while the name and age of the little\r\ngirl, and the names and ages of the two servants, the date of their\r\narrival in Virginia, and the name of the ship that each came in, are all\r\ncarefully given. The conclusion is inevitable: Isaac Maddison left no\r\nmale descendants, and President Madison's earliest ancestor in Virginia,\r\nif it was not his great-grandfather John, must be looked for somewhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nMr. Rives knew nothing of these Records. His first volume was published\r\nbefore either Sainsbury's Calendar or Hotten's Lists; and the researches\r\non which he relied, \"conducted by a distinguished member of the\r\nHistorical Society of Virginia\" in the English State Paper Office, were,\r\nso far as they related to the Madisons, incomplete and worthless. The\r\nfamily was not, apparently, \"coeval with the foundation of the Colony,\"\r\nand did not arrive \"among the earliest of the emigrants in the New\r\nWorld.\" That distinction cannot be claimed for James Madison, nor is\r\nthere any reason for supposing that he believed it could be. He seemed\r\nquite content with the knowledge that so far back as his\r\ngreat-grandfather his ancestors had been respectable people, \"in\r\nindependent and comfortable circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nOf his own generation there were seven children, of whom James was the\r\neldest, and alone became of any note, except that the rest were\r\nreputable and contented people in their stations of life. A hundred\r\nyears ago the Arcadian Virginia, for which Governor Berkeley had\r\nthanked God so devoutly,--when there was not a free school nor a press\r\nin the province,--had passed away. The elder Madison resolved, so Mr.\r\nRives tells us, that his children should have advantages of education\r\nwhich had not been within his own reach, and that they should all enjoy\r\nthem equally. James was sent to a school where he could at least begin\r\nthe studies which should fit him to enter college. Of the master of that\r\nschool we know nothing except that he was a Scotchman, of the name of\r\nDonald Robertson, and that many years afterward, when his son was an\r\napplicant for office to Madison, then secretary of state, the pupil\r\ngratefully remembered his old master, and indorsed upon the application\r\nthat \"the writer is son of Donald Robertson, the learned Teacher in King\r\nand Queen County, Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nThe preparatory studies for college were finished at home under the\r\nclergyman of the parish, the Rev. Thomas Martin, who was a member of Mr.\r\nMadison's family, perhaps as a private tutor, perhaps as a boarder. It\r\nis quite likely that it was by the advice of this gentleman--who was\r\nfrom New Jersey--that the lad was sent to Princeton instead of to\r\nWilliam and Mary College in Virginia. At Princeton, at any rate, he\r\nentered at the age of eighteen, in 1769; or, to borrow Mr. Rives's\r\neloquent statement of the fact, \"the young Virginian, invested with the\r\n_toga virilis_ of anticipated manhood, we now see launched on that\r\ndisciplinary career which is to form him for the future struggles of\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his biographers says that he shortened his collegiate term by\r\ntaking in one year the studies of the junior and senior years, but that\r\nhe remained another twelve-month at Princeton for the sake of acquiring\r\nHebrew. On his return home he undertook the instruction of his younger\r\nbrothers and sisters, while pursuing his own studies. Still another\r\nbiographer asserts that he began immediately to read law, but Rives\r\ngives some evidence that he devoted himself to theology. This and his\r\ngiving himself to Hebrew for a year point to the ministry as his chosen\r\nprofession. But if we rightly interpret his own words, he had little\r\nstrength or spirit for a pursuit of any sort. His first \"struggle of\r\nlife\" was apparently with ill-health, and the career he looked forward\r\nto was a speedy journey to another world. In a letter to a friend\r\n(November, 1772) he writes: \"I am too dull and infirm now to look out\r\nfor extraordinary things in this world, for I think my sensations for\r\nmany months have intimated to me not to expect a long or healthy life;\r\nthough it may be better with me after some time; but I hardly dare\r\nexpect it, and therefore have little spirit or elasticity to set about\r\nanything that is difficult in acquiring, and useless in possessing after\r\none has exchanged time for eternity.\" In the same letter he assures his\r\nfriend that he approves of his choice of history and morals as the\r\nsubjects of his winter studies; but, he adds, \"I doubt not but you\r\ndesign to season them with a little divinity now and then, which, like\r\nthe philosopher's stone in the hands of a good man, will turn them and\r\nevery lawful acquirement into the nature of itself, and make them more\r\nprecious than fine gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe bent of his mind at this time seems to have been decidedly\r\nreligious. He was a diligent student of the Bible, and, Mr. Rives says,\r\n\"he explored the whole history and evidences of Christianity on every\r\nside, through clouds of witnesses and champions for and against, from\r\nthe fathers and schoolmen down to the infidel philosophers of the\r\neighteenth century.\" So wide a range of theological study is remarkable\r\nin a youth of only two or three and twenty years of age; but,\r\nremembering that he was at this time living at home, it is even more\r\nremarkable that in the house of an ordinary planter in Virginia a\r\nhundred and twenty years ago could be found a library so rich in\r\ntheology as to admit of study so exhaustive. But in Virginia history\r\nnothing is impossible.\r\n\r\nHis studies on this subject, however, whether wide or limited, bore good\r\nfruit. Religious intolerance was at that time common in his immediate\r\nneighborhood, and it aroused him to earnest and open opposition; nor did\r\nthat opposition cease till years afterward, when freedom of conscience\r\nwas established by law in Virginia, largely by his labors and influence.\r\nEven in 1774, when all the colonies were girding themselves for the\r\ncoming revolutionary conflict, he turned aside from a discussion of the\r\nmomentous question of the hour, in a letter to his friend[3] in\r\nPhiladelphia, and exclaimed with unwonted heat:--\r\n\r\n     \"But away with politics!... That diabolical, hell-conceived\r\n     principle of persecution rages among some; and, to their eternal\r\n     infamy, the clergy can furnish their quota of imps for such\r\n     purposes. There are at this time in the adjacent country not less\r\n     than five or six well-meaning men in close jail for publishing\r\n     their religious sentiments, which in the main are very orthodox. I\r\n     have neither patience to hear, talk, or think of anything relative\r\n     to this matter; for I have squabbled and scolded, abused and\r\n     ridiculed so long about it to little purpose that I am without\r\n     common patience.\"\r\n\r\nThese are stronger terms than the mild-tempered Madison often indulged\r\nin. But he felt strongly. Probably he, no more than many other wiser and\r\nolder men, understood what was to be the end of the political struggle\r\nwhich was getting so earnest; but evidently in his mind it was religious\r\nrather than civil liberty which was to be guarded. \"If the Church of\r\nEngland,\" he says in the same letter, \"had been the established and\r\ngeneral religion in all the Northern colonies, as it has been among us\r\nhere, and uninterrupted harmony had prevailed throughout the continent,\r\nit is clear to me that slavery and subjection might and would have been\r\ngradually insinuated among us.\"\r\n\r\nHe congratulated his friend that they had not permitted the tea-ships to\r\nbreak cargo in Philadelphia; and Boston, he hoped, would \"conduct\r\nmatters with as much discretion as they seem to do with boldness.\" These\r\nthings were interesting and important; but \"away with politics! Let me\r\naddress you as a student and philosopher, and not as a patriot.\" Shut\r\noff from any contact with the stirring incidents of that year in the\r\ntowns of the coast, he lost something of the sense of proportion. To a\r\nyoung student, solitary, ill in body, perhaps a trifle morbid in mind, a\r\nlittle discontented that all the learning gained at Princeton could find\r\nno better use than to save schooling for the six youngsters at home,--to\r\nhim it may have seemed that liberty was more seriously threatened by\r\nthat outrage, under his own eyes, of \"five or six well-meaning men in\r\nclose jail for publishing their religious sentiments,\" than by any tax\r\nwhich Parliament could contrive. Not that he overestimated the\r\nimportance of this wrong, but that he underestimated the importance of\r\nthat. He was not long, however, in getting the true perspective.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Draper has kindly put into our hands the correspondence\r\nbetween himself and Mr. Madison, and we copy these genealogical notes in\r\nfull, with the letter in which they were sent, as all that the\r\nex-President had to say about his ancestry:--\r\n\r\nMONTPELLIER, _February 1, 1834_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your letter of December 31st, and inclose a\r\nsketch on the subject of it, made out by a member of the family.

One of his early biographers says\r\nthat he joined a military company, raised in his own county, in\r\npreparation for war; but this, there can hardly be a doubt, is an error.\r\nHe speaks with enthusiasm of the \"high-spirited\" volunteers, who came\r\nforward to defend \"the honor and safety of their country;\" but there is\r\nno intimation that he chose for himself that way of showing his\r\npatriotism. But of the Committee of Safety, appointed in his county in\r\n1774, he was made a member,--perhaps the youngest, for he was then only\r\ntwenty-three years old.\r\n\r\nEighteen months afterward he was elected a delegate to the Virginia\r\nConvention of 1776, and this he calls \"my first entrance into public\r\nlife.\" It gave him also an opportunity for some distinction, which,\r\nwhatever may have been his earlier plans, opened public life to him as a\r\ncareer. The first work of the convention was to consider and adopt a\r\nseries of resolutions instructing the Virginian delegates in the\r\nContinental Congress, then in session at Philadelphia, to urge an\r\nimmediate declaration of independence. The next matter was to frame a\r\nBill of Rights and a Constitution of government for the province.\r\nMadison was made a member of the committee to which this latter subject\r\nwas referred. One question necessarily came up for consideration which\r\nhad for him a peculiar interest, and in any discussion of which he, no\r\ndoubt, felt quite at ease. This was concerning religious freedom. An\r\narticle in the proposed Declaration of Rights provided that \"all men\r\nshould enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion,\r\naccording to the dictates of conscience, unpunished and unrestrained by\r\nthe magistrate, unless, under color of religion, any man disturb the\r\npeace, happiness, or safety of society.\" It does not appear that Mr.\r\nMadison offered any objection to the article in the committee; but when\r\nthe report was made to the convention he moved an amendment. He pointed\r\nout the distinction between the recognition of an absolute right and the\r\ntoleration of its exercise; for toleration implies the power of\r\njurisdiction. He proposed, therefore, instead of providing that \"all men\r\nshould enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion,\" to\r\ndeclare that \"all men are equally entitled to the full and free exercise\r\nof it according to the dictates of conscience;\" and that \"no man or\r\nclass of men ought, on account of religion, to be invested with peculiar\r\nemoluments or privileges, nor subjected to any penalties or\r\ndisabilities, unless, under color of religion, the preservation of\r\nequal liberty and the existence of the state be manifestly endangered.\"\r\nThis distinction between the assertion of a right and the promise to\r\ngrant a privilege only needed to be pointed out. But Mr. Madison\r\nevidently meant more; he meant not only that religious freedom should be\r\nassured, but that an Established Church, which, as we have already seen,\r\nhe believed to be dangerous to liberty, should be prohibited. Possibly\r\nthe convention was not quite ready for this latter step; or possibly its\r\nmembers thought that, as the greater includes the less, should freedom\r\nof conscience be established a state church would be impossible, and the\r\narticle might therefore be stripped of supererogation and verbiage. At\r\nany rate, it was reduced one half, and finally adopted in this simpler\r\nform: \"That religion, or the duty we owe to our Creator, and the manner\r\nof discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by\r\nforce or violence; and, therefore, all men are equally entitled to the\r\nfree exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience.\" Thus\r\nit stands to this day in the Bill of Rights of Virginia, and of other\r\nStates which subsequently made it their own, possessing for us the\r\npersonal interest of being the first public work of the coming\r\nstatesman.\r\n\r\nMadison was thenceforth for the next forty years a public man. Of the\r\nfirst Assembly under the new Constitution he was elected a member. For\r\nthe next session also he was a candidate, but failed to be returned for\r\na reason as creditable to him as it was uncommon then, whatever it may\r\nbe now, in Virginia. \"The sentiments and manners of the parent nation,\"\r\nMr. Rives says, still prevailed in Virginia, \"and the modes of\r\ncanvassing for popular votes in that country were generally practiced.\r\nThe people not only tolerated, but expected and even required, to be\r\ncourted and treated. No candidate who neglected those attentions could\r\nbe elected.\" But the times, Mr. Madison thought, seemed \"to favor a more\r\nchaste mode of conducting elections,\" and he \"determined to attempt, by\r\nan example, to introduce it.\" He failed signally; \"the sentiments and\r\nmanners of the parent nation\" were too much for him. He solicited no\r\nvotes; nobody got drunk at his expense; and he lost the election. An\r\nattempt was made to contest the return of his opponent on the ground of\r\ncorrupt influence, but, adds Mr. Rives, in his sesquipedalian measure,\r\n\"for the want of adequate proof to sustain the allegations of the\r\npetition which in such cases it is extremely difficult to obtain with\r\nthe requisite precision, the proceeding was unavailing except as a\r\nperpetual protest, upon the legislative records of the country, against\r\na dangerous abuse, of which one of her sons, so qualified to serve her,\r\nand destined to be one of her chief ornaments, was the early though\r\ntemporary victim.\" Mr. Rives does not mean that Mr. Madison was for a\r\nlittle while in early life the victim of a vicious habit, but that he\r\nlost votes because he would do nothing to encourage it in others.\r\n\r\nThe country lost a good representative, but their loss was his gain. The\r\nAssembly immediately elected him a member of the governor's council, and\r\nin this position he so grew in public favor that, two years afterward\r\n(1780), he was chosen as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was\r\nstill under thirty, and had he been even a more brilliant young man than\r\nhe really was, it would not have been to his discredit had he only been\r\nseen for the next year or two, if seen at all, in the background. He had\r\ntaken his seat among men, every one of whom, probably, was his senior,\r\nand among whom were many of the wisest men in the country, not \"older\"\r\nmerely, but \"better soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nIf not the darkest, at least there was no darker year in the Revolution\r\nthan that of 1780. Within a few days of his arrival at Philadelphia,\r\nMadison wrote to Jefferson--then governor of Virginia--his opinion of\r\nthe state of the country. It was gloomy but not exaggerated. The only\r\nbright spot he could see was the chance that Clinton's expedition to\r\nSouth Carolina might be a failure; but within little more than a month\r\nfrom the date of his letter, Lincoln was compelled to surrender\r\nCharleston, and the whole country south of Virginia seemed about to fall\r\ninto the hands of the enemy. Could he have foreseen that calamity, his\r\napprehensions might have been changed to despair; for he writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"Our army threatened with an immediate alternative of disbanding or\r\n     living on free quarter; the public treasury empty; public credit\r\n     exhausted, nay, the private credit of purchasing agents employed, I\r\n     am told, as far as it will bear; Congress complaining of the\r\n     extortion of the people, the people of the improvidence of\r\n     Congress, and the army of both; our affairs requiring the most\r\n     mature and systematic measures, and the urgency of occasions\r\n     admitting only of temporary expedients, and these expedients\r\n     generating new difficulties; Congress recommending plans to the\r\n     several States for execution, and the States separately rejudging\r\n     the expediency of such plans, whereby the same distrust of\r\n     concurrent exertions that had damped the ardor of patriotic\r\n     individuals must produce the same effect among the States\r\n     themselves; an old system of finance discarded as incompetent to\r\n     our necessities, an untried and precarious one substituted, and a\r\n     total stagnation in prospect between the end of the former and the\r\n     operation of the latter. These are the outlines of the picture of\r\n     our public situation. I leave it to your own imagination to fill\r\n     them up.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw more clearly, perhaps, after the experience of one session of\r\nCongress, the true cause of all these troubles; at any rate, he was\r\nable, in a letter written in November of that year (1780), to state it\r\ntersely and explicitly. The want of money, he wrote to a friend, \"is the\r\nsource of all our public difficulties and misfortunes. One or two\r\nmillions of guineas properly applied would diffuse vigor and\r\nsatisfaction throughout the whole military department, and would expel\r\nthe enemy from every part of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nBut nobody knew better than he the difficulty of raising funds except by\r\nborrowing abroad, and that this was a precarious reliance. There must be\r\nsome sort of substitute for money. In specific taxation he had no faith.\r\nSuch taxes, if paid at all, would be paid, virtually, in the paper\r\ncurrency or certificates of the States, and these had already fallen to\r\nthe ratio of one hundred to one; they kept on falling till they reached\r\nthe rate of a thousand to one, and then soon became altogether\r\nworthless. When the estimate for the coming year was under\r\nconsideration, he proposed to Congress that the States should be advised\r\nto abandon the issue of this paper currency. \"It met,\" he says, \"with so\r\ncool a reception that I did not much urge it.\" The sufficient answer to\r\nthe proposition was, that \"the practice was manifestly repugnant to the\r\nActs of Congress,\" and as these were disregarded and could not be\r\nenforced, a mere remonstrance would be quite useless. The Union was\r\nlittle more than a name under the feeble bonds of the Confederation, and\r\neach State was a law unto itself. Not that in this case there was much\r\nreasonable ground for complaint; for what else could the States do?\r\nWhere there was no money there must be something to take its place; a\r\npromise to pay must be accepted instead of payment. The paper answered a\r\ntemporary purpose, though it was plain that in the end it would be good\r\nfor nothing.\r\n\r\nThe evil, however, was manifestly so great that there was only the more\r\nreason for trying to mitigate it, if it could not be cured. Madison,\r\nlike the rest, had his remedy. He proposed, in a letter to one of his\r\ncolleagues, that the demand for army supplies should be duly apportioned\r\namong the people, their collection rigorously enforced, and payment made\r\nin interest-bearing certificates, not transferable, but to be redeemed\r\nat a specified time after the war was over. The plan would undoubtedly\r\nhave put a stop to the circulation of a vast volume of paper money if\r\nthe producers would have exchanged the products of their labor for\r\ncertificates, useless at the time of exchange, and having only a\r\npossible prospective value in case of the successful termination of an\r\nuncertain war. Patriotic as the people were, they neither would nor\r\ncould have submitted to such a law, nor had Congress the power to\r\nenforce it. But Mr. Madison did not venture apparently to urge his plan\r\nbeyond its suggestion to his colleague.\r\n\r\nWhy the Assembly of Virginia should have proposed to elect an extra\r\ndelegate to Congress, early in 1781, is not clear, unless it be that one\r\nof the number, Joseph Jones, being also a member of the Assembly, passed\r\nmuch of his time in Richmond. It does not appear, however, that the\r\ndelegate extraordinary was ever sent, perhaps because it was known to\r\nMr. Madison's friends that it would be a mortification to him. There was\r\ncertainly no good reason for any distrust of either his ability or his\r\nindustry. One could hardly be otherwise than industrious who had it in\r\nhim--if the story be true--to take but three hours out of the\r\ntwenty-four for sleep during the last year of his college course, that\r\nhe might crowd the studies of two years into one. He seemed to love work\r\nfor its own sake, and he was a striking example of how much virtue there\r\nis in steadiness of pursuit. Not that he had at this time any special\r\ngoal for his ambition. His aim seemed to be simply to do the best he\r\ncould wherever he might be placed; to discharge faithfully, and to the\r\nbest of such ability as he had, whatever duty was intrusted to him. His\r\nreport of the proceedings in the congressional session of 1782-83, and\r\nthe letters written during those years and the year before, show that he\r\nwas not merely diligent but absorbed in the duties of his office.\r\n\r\nHe was more faithful to his constituents than his constituents sometimes\r\nwere to him. Anything that might happen at that period for want of money\r\ncan hardly be a matter of surprise; but Virginia, even then, should have\r\nbeen able, it would seem, to find enough to enable its members of\r\nCongress to pay their board-bills. He complains gently in his Addisonian\r\nway of the inconvenience to which he was put for want of funds. \"I\r\ncannot,\" he writes to Edmund Randolph, \"in any way make you more\r\nsensible of the importance of your kind attention to pecuniary\r\nremittances for me, than by informing you that I have for some time past\r\nbeen a pensioner on the favor of Hayne Solomon, a Jew broker.\" A month\r\nlater he writes, that to draw bills on Virginia has been tried, \"but in\r\nvain;\" nobody would buy them; and he adds, \"I am relapsing fast into\r\ndistress. The case of my brethren is equally alarming.\" Within a week he\r\nagain writes: \"I am almost ashamed to reiterate my wants so incessantly\r\nto you, but they begin to be so urgent that it is impossible to suppress\r\nthem.\" But the Good Samaritan, Solomon, is still an unfailing reliance.\r\n\"The kindness of our little friend in Front Street, near the coffee\r\nhouse, is a fund which will preserve me from extremities; but I never\r\nresort to it without great mortification, as he obstinately rejects all\r\nrecompense. The price of money is so usurious that he thinks it ought to\r\nbe extorted from none but those who aim at profitable speculations. To a\r\nnecessitous delegate he gratuitously spares a supply out of his private\r\nstock.\" It is a pretty picture of the simplicity of the early days of\r\nthe Republic. Between the average modern member and the money-broker,\r\nunder such circumstances, there would lurk, probably, a contract for\r\ncarrying the mails or for Indian supplies.\r\n\r\nRelief, however, came at last. An appeal was made in a letter to the\r\ngovernor of Virginia, which was so far public that anybody about the\r\nexecutive office might read it. The answer to this letter, says Mr.\r\nMadison, \"seems to chide our urgency.\" But there soon came a bill for\r\ntwo hundred dollars, which, he adds, \"very seasonably enabled me to\r\nreplace a loan by which I had anticipated it. About three hundred and\r\nfifty more (not less) would redeem me completely from the class of\r\ndebtors.\" It is to be hoped it came without further chiding.[4]\r\n\r\nThe young member was not less attentive to his congressional duties\r\nbecause of these little difficulties in the personal ways and means.\r\nMilitary movements seem, without altogether escaping his attention, to\r\nhave interested him the least. In his letters to the public men at home,\r\nwhich were meant in some degree to give such information as in later\r\ntimes the newspapers supplied, questions relating to army affairs, even\r\nnews directly from the army, occupy the least space. They are not\r\nalways, for that reason, altogether entertaining reading. One would be\r\nglad, occasionally, to exchange their sonorous and rounded periods for\r\nany expression of quick, impulsive feeling. \"I return you,\" he writes to\r\nPendleton, \"my fervent congratulations on the glorious success of the\r\ncombined armies at York and Gloucester. We have had from the\r\nCommander-in-Chief an official report of the fact,\"--and so forth and so\r\nforth; and then for a page or more is a discussion of the condition of\r\nBritish possessions in the East Indies, that \"rich source of their\r\ncommerce and credit, severed from them, perhaps forever;\" of \"the\r\npredatory conquest of Eustatia;\" and of the \"relief of Gibraltar, which\r\nwas merely a negative advantage;\"--all to show that \"it seems scarcely\r\npossible for them much longer to shut their ears against the voice of\r\npeace.\" There is not a word in all this that is not quite true,\r\npertinent, reflective, and becoming a statesman; but neither is there a\r\nword of sympathetic warmth and patriotic fervor which at that moment\r\nmade the heart of a whole people beat quicker at the news of a great\r\nvictory, and in the hope that the cause was gained at last.\r\n\r\nAll the letters have this preternatural solemnity, as if each was a\r\nstudy in style after the favorite Addisonian model. One wonders if he\r\ndid not, in the privacy of his own room and with the door locked,\r\nventure to throw his hat to the ceiling and give one hurrah under his\r\nbreath at the discomfiture of the vain and self-sufficient Cornwallis.\r\nBut he seems never to have been a young man. At one and twenty he\r\ngravely warned his friend Bradford not \"to suffer those impertinent fops\r\nthat abound in every city to divert you from your business and\r\nphilosophical amusements.... You will make them respect and admire you\r\nmore by showing your indignation at their follies, and by keeping them\r\nat a becoming distance.\" It was his loss, however, and our gain. He was\r\none of the men the times demanded, and without whom they would have been\r\nquite different times and followed by quite different results. The\r\nsombre hue of his life was due partly, no doubt, to natural temperament;\r\npartly to the want of health in his earlier manhood, which led him to\r\nbelieve that his days were numbered; but quite as much, if not more than\r\neither, to a keen sense of the responsibility resting upon those to whom\r\nhad fallen the conduct of public affairs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The members of Congress were paid, at that time, by the\r\nStates they represented. Virginia allowed her delegates their family\r\nexpenses, including three servants and four horses, house rent and fuel,\r\ntwo dollars a mile for travel, and twenty dollars a day when in\r\nattendance on Congress. The members were required to render an account\r\nquarterly of their household expenses, and the State paid them when she\r\nhad any money.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nIN CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison had grown steadily in the estimation of his colleagues, as is\r\nshown, especially in 1783, by the frequency of his appointment upon\r\nimportant committees. He was a member of that one to which was intrusted\r\nthe question of national finances, and it is plain, even in his own\r\nmodest report of the debates of that session, that he took an important\r\npart in the long discussions of the subject, and exercised a marked\r\ninfluence upon the result. The position of the government was one of\r\nextreme difficulty. To tide over an immediate necessity, a further loan\r\nhad been asked of France in 1782, and bills were drawn against it\r\nwithout waiting for acceptance. It was not very likely, but it was not\r\nimpossible, that the bills might go to protest; but even should they be\r\nhonored, so irregular a proceeding was a humiliating acknowledgment of\r\npoverty and weakness, to which some of the delegates, Mr. Madison among\r\nthem, were extremely sensitive.\r\n\r\nThe national debt altogether was not less than forty million dollars. To\r\nprovide for the interest on this debt, and a fund for expenses, it was\r\nnecessary to raise about three million dollars annually. But the sum\r\nactually contributed for the support of the confederate government in\r\n1782 was only half a million dollars. This was not from any absolute\r\ninability on the part of the people to pay more; for the taxes before\r\nthe war were more than double that sum, and for the first three or four\r\nyears of the war it was computed that, with the depreciation of paper\r\nmoney, the people submitted to an annual tax of about twenty million\r\ndollars. The real difficulty lay in the character of the Confederation.\r\nCongress might contrive but it could not command. The States might\r\nagree, or they might disagree, or any two or more of them might only\r\nagree to disagree; and they were more likely to do either of the last\r\ntwo than the first. There was no power of coercion anywhere. All that\r\nCongress could do was to try to frame laws that would reconcile\r\ndifferences, and bring thirteen supreme governments upon some common\r\nground of agreement. To distract and perplex it still more, it stood\r\nface to face with a well-disciplined and veteran army which might at any\r\nmoment, could it find a leader to its mind, march upon Philadelphia and\r\ndeal with Congress as Cromwell dealt with the Long Parliament. There\r\nwere some men, probably, in that body, who would not have been sorry to\r\nsee that precedent followed. Washington might have done it if he would.\r\nGates probably would have done it if he could.\r\n\r\nTo avert this threatened danger; to contrive taxation that should so\r\nfar please the taxed that they would refrain from using the power in\r\ntheir hands to escape altogether any taxation for general purposes,--was\r\nthe knotty problem this Congress had to solve in order to save the\r\nConfederacy from dissolution. There was no want of plans and expedients;\r\nneither were there wanting men in that body who clearly understood the\r\nconditions of the problem, and how it might be solved, and whose aim was\r\ndirect and unfaltering. Chief among them were Hamilton, Wilson,\r\nEllsworth, and Madison. However wrong-headed, or weak, or intemperate\r\nothers may have been, these men were usually found together on important\r\nquestions; differing sometimes in details, but unmoved by passion or\r\nprejudice, and strong from reserved force, they overwhelmed their\r\nopponents at the right moment with irresistible argument and by weight\r\nof character.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the more important questions Mr. Madison is\r\nconspicuous--conspicuous without being obtrusive. A reader of the\r\ndebates can hardly fail to be struck with his familiarity with English\r\nconstitutional law, and its application to the necessities of this\r\noffshoot of the English people in setting up a government for\r\nthemselves. The stores of knowledge he drew upon must needs have been\r\nlaid up in the years of quiet study at home before he entered upon\r\npublic life. For there was no congressional library then where a member\r\ncould \"cram\" for debate; and--though Philadelphia already had a fair\r\npublic library--the member who was armed at all points must have\r\nequipped himself before entering Congress. In this respect Madison\r\nprobably had no equal, except Hamilton, and possibly Ellsworth. To the\r\nneed of such a library, however, he and others were not insensible. As\r\nchairman of a committee he reported a list of books \"proper for the use\r\nof Congress,\" and advised their purchase. The report declared that\r\ncertain authorities upon international law, treaties, negotiations, and\r\nother questions of legislation were absolutely indispensable, and that\r\nthe want of them \"was manifest in several Acts of Congress.\" But the\r\nCongress was not to be moved by a little thing of that sort.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of his own State sometimes embarrassed him in the\r\nsatisfactory discharge of his duty as a legislator. The earliest\r\ndistinction he won after entering Congress was as chairman of a\r\ncommittee to enforce upon Mr. Jay, then minister to Spain, the\r\ninstructions to adhere tenaciously to the right of navigation on the\r\nMississippi in his negotiations for an alliance with that power. Mr.\r\nMadison, in his dispatch, maintained the American side of the question\r\nwith a force and clearness to which no subsequent discussion of the\r\nsubject ever added anything. He left nothing unsaid that could be said\r\nto sustain the right either on the ground of expediency, of national\r\ncomity, or of international law; and his arguments were not only in\r\naccordance with his own convictions, but with the instructions of the\r\nAssembly of his own State. It was a question of deep interest to\r\nVirginia, whose western boundary at that time was the Mississippi. But\r\nVirginia soon afterward shifted her position. The course of the war in\r\nthe Southern States in the winter of 1780-81 aroused in Georgia and the\r\nCarolinas renewed anxiety for an alliance with Spain. The fear of their\r\npeople was that, in case of the necessity for a sudden peace while the\r\nBritish troops were in possession of those States or parts of them, they\r\nmight be compelled to remain as British territory under the application\r\nof the rule of _uti possidetis_. It was urged, therefore, that the right\r\nto the Mississippi should be surrendered to Spain, if it were made the\r\ncondition of an alliance. In deference to her neighbors, Virginia\r\nproposed that Mr. Jay should be reinstructed accordingly.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison was not in the least shaken in his conviction. With him, the\r\nquestion was one of right rather than of expediency. But not many at\r\nthat time ventured to doubt that representatives must implicitly obey\r\nthe instructions of their constituents. He yielded; but not till he had\r\nappealed to the Assembly to reconsider their decision. The scale was\r\nturned; in deference to the wishes of the Southern States new orders\r\nwere sent to Mr. Jay. Mr. Madison, however, had not long to wait for his\r\njustification. When the immediate danger, which had so alarmed the\r\nSouth, had passed away, Virginia returned to her original position. New\r\ninstructions were again sent to her representatives, and Mr. Jay was\r\nonce more advised by Congress that on the Mississippi question his\r\ngovernment would yield nothing.\r\n\r\nOn another question, two years afterward, Mr. Madison refused to accept\r\na position of inconsistency in obedience to instructions which his State\r\nattempted to force upon him. No one saw more clearly than he how\r\nabsolutely necessary to the preservation of the Confederacy was the\r\nsettlement of its financial affairs on some sound and just basis; and no\r\none labored more earnestly and more intelligently than he to bring about\r\nsuch a settlement. Congress had proposed in 1781 a tax upon imports,\r\neach State to appoint its own collectors, but the revenue to be paid\r\nover to the federal government to meet the expenses of the war. Rhode\r\nIsland alone, at first, refused her assent to this scheme. An impost law\r\nof five per cent. upon certain imports and a specific duty upon others\r\nfor twenty-five years were an essential part of the plan of 1783 to\r\nprovide a revenue to meet the interest on the public debt and for other\r\ngeneral purposes. That Rhode Island would continue obstinate on this\r\npoint was more than probable; and the only hope of moving her was that\r\nshe should be shamed or persuaded into compliance by the combined\r\ninfluence of all the other States.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison was as bitter as he could ever be in his reflections upon\r\nthat State, whose course, he thought, showed a want of any sense of\r\nhonor or of patriotism. Virginia, he argued, should rebuke her by making\r\nher own compliance with the law the more emphatic, as an example for all\r\nthe rest. But Virginia did exactly the other thing. At the moment when\r\ndebate upon the revenue law was the most earnest, and the prospect of\r\ncarrying it the most hopeful; when a committee appointed by Congress had\r\nalready started on their journey northward to expostulate with, and if\r\npossible conciliate, Rhode Island,--at that critical moment came news\r\nfrom Virginia that she had revoked her assent of a previous session to\r\nthe impost law. This was equivalent to instructing her delegates in\r\nCongress to oppose any such measure. The situation was an awkward one\r\nfor a representative who had put himself among the foremost of those who\r\nwere pushing this policy, and who had been making invidious reflections\r\nupon a State which opposed it. The rule that the will of the\r\nconstituents should govern the representative, he now declared, had its\r\nexceptions, and here was a case in point. He continued to enforce the\r\nnecessity of a general law to provide a revenue, though his arguments\r\nwere no longer pointed with the selfishness and want of patriotism shown\r\nby the people of Rhode Island. In the end his firmness was justified by\r\nVirginia, who again shifted her position when the new act was submitted\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the law was limited to five and twenty years. This\r\nHamilton opposed and Madison supported; and in this difference some of\r\nthe biographers of both see the foreshadowing of future parties. But it\r\nis more likely that neither of those statesmen thought of their\r\ndifference of opinion as difference of principle. The question was,\r\nwhether anything could be gained by a deference to that party which,\r\nboth felt at that time, threatened to throw away, in adhering to the\r\nstate-rights doctrine, all that was gained by the Revolution. They were\r\nagreed upon the necessity of a general law, supreme in all the States,\r\nto meet the obligation of a debt contracted for the general good.\r\nUnless--wrote Madison in February--\"unless some amicable and adequate\r\narrangements be speedily taken for adjusting all the subsisting accounts\r\nand discharging the public engagements, a dissolution of the Union will\r\nbe inevitable.\" He was willing, therefore, to temporize, that the\r\nnecessary assent of the State to such a law might be gained. Nobody\r\nhoped that the public debt would be paid off in twenty-five years; but\r\nto assume to levy a federal tax in the States for a longer period, or\r\ntill the debt should be discharged, might so arouse state jealousy that\r\nit would be impossible to get an assent to the law anywhere. If the law\r\nfor twenty-five years should be accepted, the threatened destruction of\r\nthe government would be escaped for the present, and it might, at the\r\nend of a quarter of a century, be easy to reënact the law. At any rate,\r\nthe evil day would be put off. This was Madison's reasoning.\r\n\r\nBut Hamilton did not believe in putting off a crisis. He had no faith in\r\nthe permanency of the government as then organized. If he were right,\r\nwhat was the use or the wisdom of postponing a catastrophe till\r\nto-morrow? A possible escape from it might be even more difficult\r\nto-morrow than to-day. The essential difference between the two men was,\r\nthat Madison only feared what Hamilton positively knew, or thought he\r\nknew. It was a difference of faith. Madison hoped something would turn\r\nup in the course of twenty-five years. Hamilton did not believe that\r\nanything good could turn up under the feeble rule of the Confederation.\r\nHe would have presented to the States, then and there, the question,\r\nWould they surrender to the confederate government the right of taxation\r\nso long as that government thought it necessary? If not, then the\r\nConfederation was a rope of sand, and the States had resolved themselves\r\ninto thirteen separate and independent governments. Therefore he opposed\r\nthe condition of twenty-five years, and voted against the bill.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when it became the law he gave it his heartiest support,\r\nand was appointed one of a committee of three to prepare an address,\r\nwhich Madison wrote, to commend it to the acceptance of the States.\r\nIndeed, the last serious effort made on behalf of the measure was made\r\nby Hamilton, who used all his eloquence and influence to induce the\r\nlegislature of his own State to ratify it. It was the law against his\r\nbetter judgment; but being the law, he did his best to secure its\r\nrecognition. But it failed of hearty support in most of the States,\r\nwhile in New York and Pennsylvania compliance with it was absolutely\r\nrefused. Nothing, therefore, would have been lost had Hamilton's\r\nfirmness prevailed in Congress; and nothing was gained by Madison's\r\ndeference to the doctrine of state rights, unless it was that the\r\nquestion of a \"more perfect Union\" was put off to a more propitious\r\ntime, when a reconstruction of the government under a new federal\r\nConstitution was possible. Meanwhile Congress borrowed the money to pay\r\nthe interest on money already borrowed; the confederate government\r\nfloundered deeper and deeper into inextricable difficulties; the\r\nthirteen ships of state drifted farther and farther apart, with a fair\r\npromise of a general wreck.\r\n\r\nBut the bill contained another compromise which was not temporary, and\r\nonce made could not be easily unmade. Agreed to now, it became a\r\ncondition of the adoption of the federal Constitution four years later;\r\nand there, as nobody now is so blind as not to see, it was the source of\r\ninfinite mischief for nearly a century, till a third reconstruction of\r\nthe Union was brought about by the war of 1861-65. The Articles of\r\nConfederation required that \"all charges of war and all other expenses\r\nthat shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare\" should\r\nbe borne by the States in proportion to the value of their lands. It was\r\nproposed to amend this provision of the Constitution, and for lands\r\nsubstitute population, exclusive of Indians not taxed, as the basis for\r\ntaxation. But here arose at once a new and perplexing question. There\r\nwere, chiefly in one portion of the country, about 750,000 \"persons held\r\nto service or labor,\"--the euphuism for negro slaves which, evolved from\r\nsome tender and sentimental conscience, came into use at this period.\r\nShould these, recognized only as property by state law, be counted as\r\n750,000 persons by the laws of the United States?[5] Or should they, in\r\nthe enumeration of population, be reckoned, in accordance with the civil\r\nlaw, as _pro nullis_, _pro mortuis_, _pro quadrupedibus_, and therefore\r\nnot to be counted at all? Or should they, as those who owned them\r\ninsisted, be counted, if included in the basis of taxation, as fractions\r\nof persons only?\r\n\r\nThe South contended that black slaves were not equal to white men as\r\nproducers of wealth, and that, by counting them as such, taxation would\r\nbe unequal and unjust. But whether counted as units or as fractions of\r\nunits, the slaveholders insisted that representation should be according\r\nto that enumeration. The Northern reply was that, if representation was\r\nto be according to population, the slaves being included, then the slave\r\nStates would have a representation of property, for which there would be\r\nno equivalent in States where there were no slaves; but if slaves were\r\nenumerated as a basis of representation, then that enumeration should\r\nalso be taken to fix the rate of taxation.\r\n\r\nHere, at any rate, was a basis for an interesting deadlock. One simple\r\nway out of it would have been to insist upon the doctrine of the civil\r\nlaw; to count the slaves only as _pro quadrupedibus_, to be left out of\r\nthe enumeration of population as being no part of the State, as horses\r\nand cattle were left out. But the bonds of union hung loosely upon the\r\nsisters a hundred years ago; there was not one of them who did not think\r\nshe was able to set up for herself and take her place among the nations\r\nas an independent sovereign; and it is more than likely that half of\r\nthem would have refused to wear those bonds any longer on such a\r\ncondition. There was no apprehension then that slavery was to become a\r\npower for evil in the State; but there was intense anxiety lest the\r\nStates should fly asunder, form partial and local unions among\r\nneighbors, or become entangled in alliances with foreign nations, at the\r\nsacrifice of all, or much, that was gained by the Revolution. To make\r\nany concession, therefore, to slavery for the sake of the Union was\r\nhardly held to be a concession.\r\n\r\nThe curious student of history, however, who loves to study those\r\nproblems of what might have happened if events that did not happen had\r\ncome to pass, will find ample room for speculation in the possibilities\r\nof this one. Had there been no compromise, it is as easy to see now, as\r\nit was easy to foresee then, how quickly the feeble bond of union would\r\nhave snapped asunder. But nevertheless, if the North had insisted that\r\nthe slaves should neither be counted nor represented at all, or else\r\nshould be reckoned in full and taxes levied accordingly, the consequent\r\ndissolution of the Confederacy might have had consequences which then\r\nnobody dreamed of. For it is not impossible, it is not even improbable,\r\nthat, in that event, the year 1800 would have seen slavery in the\r\nprocess of rapid extinction everywhere except in South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia. Had the event been postponed in those States to a later period,\r\nit would only have been because they had already found in the\r\ncultivation of indigo and rice a profitable use for slave-labor, which\r\ndid not exist in the other slave States, where the supply of slaves was\r\nrapidly exceeding the demand. There can hardly be a doubt that, in case\r\nof the dissolution of the Confederacy, the Northern free-labor States\r\nwould soon have consolidated into a strong union of their own. There was\r\nevery reason for hastening it, and none so strong for hindering it as\r\nthose which were overborne in the union which was actually formed soon\r\nafterward between the free-labor and slave-labor States. To such a\r\nNorthern union the border States, as they sloughed off the old system,\r\nwould have been naturally attracted; nor can there be a doubt that a\r\nfederal union so formed would ultimately have proved quite as strong,\r\nquite as prosperous, quite as happy, and quite as respectable among the\r\nnations, as one purchased by compromises with slavery, followed, as\r\nthose compromises were, by three quarters of a century of bitter\r\npolitical strife ending in a civil war.\r\n\r\nBut the Northern members were no less ready to make compromises than\r\nSouthern members were to insist upon them, these no more understanding\r\nwhat they conceded than those understood what they gained; for the\r\nfuture was equally concealed from both. A committee reported that two\r\nblacks should be rated as one free man. This was unsatisfactory. To some\r\nit seemed too large, to others too small. Other ratios, therefore, were\r\nproposed,--three to one, three to two, four to one, and four to three.\r\nMr. Madison at last, \"in order,\" as he said, \"to give a proof of the\r\nsincerity of his professions of liberality,\"--and doubtless he meant to\r\nbe liberal,--proposed \"that slaves should be rated as five to three.\"\r\nHis motion was adopted, but afterward reconsidered. Four days\r\nlater--April 1st--Mr. Hamilton renewed the proposition, and it was\r\ncarried, Madison says, \"without opposition.\"[6] The law on this point\r\nwas the precedent for the mischievous three fifths rule of the\r\nConstitution adopted four years later.\r\n\r\nYouth finally overtook the young man during the last winter of his term\r\nin Congress, for he fell in love. But it was an unfortunate experience,\r\nand the outcome of it doubtless gave a more sombre hue than ever to his\r\nlife. His choice was not a wise one. Probably Mr. Madison seemed a much\r\nolder man than he really was at that period of his life, and to a young\r\ngirl may have appeared really advanced in years. At any rate, it was his\r\nunhappy fate to be attached to a young lady of more than usual beauty\r\nand of irrepressible vivacity,--Miss Catherine Floyd, a daughter of\r\nGeneral William Floyd of Long Island, N. Y., who was one of the signers\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, and who was a delegate to Congress\r\nfrom 1774 to 1783. Miss Catherine's sixteenth birthday was in April of\r\nthe latter year; Madison was double her age, as his thirty-second\r\nbirthday was a month earlier. His suit, however, was accepted, and they\r\nbecame engaged. But it was the father rather than the daughter who\r\nadmired the suitor; for the older statesman better understood the\r\ncharacter, and better appreciated the abilities, of his young colleague,\r\nand predicted a brilliant career for him. The girl's wisdom was of\r\nanother kind. The future career which she foresaw and wanted to share\r\nbelonged to a young clergyman, who--according to the reminiscences of an\r\naged relative of hers--\"hung round her at the harpsichord,\" and made\r\nlove in quite another fashion than that of the solemn statesman whom\r\nthe old general so approved of. It is altogether a pretty love story,\r\nand one's sympathy goes out to the lively young beauty, who was thinking\r\nof love and not of ambition, as she turned from the old young gentleman,\r\ndiscussing, with her wise father, the public debt and the necessity of\r\nan impost, to that really young young gentleman who knew how to hang\r\nover the harpsichord, and talked more to the purpose with his eyes than\r\never the other could with his lips. There is a tradition that she was\r\nencouraged to be thus on with the new love before she was off with the\r\nold, by a friend somewhat older than herself; and possibly this maturer\r\nlady may have thought that Madison would be better mated with one nearer\r\nhis own age. At any rate, the engagement was broken off before long by\r\nthe dismissal of the older lover, much to the father's disappointment,\r\nand in due time the young lady married the other suitor. There is no\r\nreason that I know of for supposing that she ever regretted that her\r\nmore humble home was in a rectory, when it might have been, in due time,\r\nhad she chosen differently, in the White House at Washington, and that\r\nafterward she might have lived, the remaining sixteen years of her life,\r\nthe honored wife of a revered ex-President. Perhaps, however, she smiled\r\nin those later years at the recollection of having laughed in her gay\r\nand thoughtless youth at her solemn lover, and that, when at last she\r\ndismissed him, she sealed her letter--conveying to him alone, it may\r\nbe, some merry but mischievous meaning--with a bit of rye-dough.[7]\r\n\r\nMr. Rives gives a letter from Jefferson to Madison at this time, which\r\nshows that he stood in need of consolation from his friends. \"I\r\nsincerely lament,\" Mr. Jefferson wrote in his philosophical way, \"the\r\nmisadventure which has happened, from whatever cause it may have\r\nhappened. Should it be final, however, the world presents the same and\r\nmany other resources of happiness, and you possess many within yourself.\r\nFirmness of mind and unintermitting occupation will not long leave you\r\nin pain. No event has been more contrary to my expectations, and these\r\nwere founded on what I thought a good knowledge of the ground. But of\r\nall machines ours is the most complicated and inexplicable.\" It was\r\nSolomon who said, \"there be three things which are too wonderful for me,\r\nyea, four which I know not.\" This fourth was, \"the way of a man with a\r\nmaid.\" He might have added a fifth,--the way of a maid with a man,\r\nwhich, evidently, is what Jefferson meant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: In some of the States slaves were reckoned as \"chattels\r\npersonal;\" in others as \"real estate.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: J. C. Hamilton says, in his _History of the Republic_, that\r\n\"the motion prevailed by a vote of all the States excepting\r\nMassachusetts and Rhode Island.\" But his understanding of the question\r\nis in other respects incorrect,--misunderstood, one may hope, rather\r\nthan misstated lest he should give credit, for what he considered a\r\nmeritorious action, to Madison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: For the details, so far as they can now be recalled, of\r\nthis single romantic incident in Mr. Madison's life, I am indebted to\r\nNicoll Floyd, Esq., of Moriches, Long Island, a great-grandson of\r\nGeneral William Floyd.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the election of the same delegate to Congress for consecutive\r\nsessions was then forbidden by the law of Virginia, Mr. Madison was not\r\nreturned to that body in 1784. For a brief interval of three months he\r\nmade good use of his time, we are told, by continuing his law studies,\r\ntill in the spring of that year he was chosen to represent his county in\r\nthe Virginia Assembly. It may be that \"the sentiments and manners of the\r\nparent nation,\" which he lamented seven years before, had passed away,\r\nand nobody now insisted upon the privilege of getting drunk at the\r\ncandidate's expense before voting for him. But it is more likely that\r\nthe electors had not changed. The difference was in the candidate; they\r\ndid not need to be allured to give their votes to a man whom they were\r\nproud to call upon to represent the county. Mr. Madison's reputation was\r\nalready made by his three years in Congress, and he now easily took a\r\nplace among the political leaders of his own State.\r\n\r\nThe position was hardly less conspicuous or less influential than that\r\nwhich he had held in the national Congress. What each State might do\r\nwas of quite as much importance as anything the federal government might\r\nor could do. Congress could neither open nor close a single port in\r\nVirginia to commerce, whether domestic or foreign, without the consent\r\nof the State; it could not levy a tax of a penny on anything, whether\r\ngoods coming in or products going out, if the State objected. As a\r\nmember of Congress, Mr. Madison might propose or oppose any of these\r\nthings; as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, he might, if his\r\ninfluence was strong enough, carry or forbid any or all of them,\r\nwhatever might be the wishes of Congress. It was in the power of\r\nVirginia to influence largely the welfare of her neighbors, so far as it\r\ndepended upon commerce, and indirectly that of every State in the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the Assembly, as in Congress, Mr. Madison's aim was to increase the\r\npowers of the federal government, for want of which it was rapidly\r\nsinking into imbecility and contempt. \"I acceded,\" he says, \"to the\r\ndesire of my fellow-citizens of the county that I should be one of its\r\nrepresentatives in the legislature,\" to bring about \"a rescue of the\r\nUnion and the blessings of liberty staked on it from an impending\r\ncatastrophe.\" Early in the session the Assembly assented to the\r\namendment to the Articles of Confederation proposed at the late session\r\nof Congress, which substituted population for a land valuation as the\r\nbasis of representation and of taxation. The Assembly also asserted that\r\nall requisitions upon the States for the support of the general\r\ngovernment and to provide for the public debt should be complied with,\r\nand payment of balances on old accounts should be enforced; and it\r\nassented to the recommendation of Congress that that body should have\r\npower for a limited period to control the trade with foreign nations\r\nhaving no treaty with the United States, in order that it might\r\nretaliate upon Great Britain for excluding American ships from her West\r\nIndia colonies. All these measures were designed for \"the rescue of the\r\nUnion,\" and they had, of course, Madison's hearty support. For it was\r\nabsolutely essential, as he believed, that something should be done if\r\nthe Union was to be saved, or to be made worth saving. But there were\r\nobstacles on all sides. The commercial States were reluctant to\r\nsurrender the control over trade to Congress; in the planting States\r\nthere was hardly any trade that could be surrendered. In Virginia the\r\ntobacco planter still clung to the old ways. He liked to have the\r\nEnglish ship take his tobacco from the river bank of his own plantation,\r\nand to receive from the same vessel such coarse goods as were needed to\r\nclothe his slaves, with the more expensive luxuries for his own\r\nfamily,--dry goods for his wife and daughter; the pipe of madeira, the\r\ncoats and breeches, the hats, boots, and saddles for himself and his\r\nsons. He knew that this year's crop went to pay--if it did pay--for last\r\nyear's goods, and that he was always in debt. But the debt was on\r\nrunning account, and did not matter. The London factor was skillful in\r\ncharges for interest and commissions, and the account for this year was\r\nalways a lien on next year's crop. He knew, and the planter knew, that\r\nthe tobacco could be sold at a higher price in New York or Philadelphia\r\nthan the factor got, or seemed to get, for it in London; that the goods\r\nsent out in exchange were charged at a higher price than they could be\r\nbought for in the Northern towns. Nevertheless, the planter liked to see\r\nhis own hogsheads rolled on board ship by his own negroes at his own\r\nwharf, and receive in return his own boxes and bales shipped direct from\r\nLondon at his own order, let it cost what it might. It was a shiftless\r\nand ruinous system; but the average Virginia planter was not over-quick\r\nat figures, nor even at reading and writing. He was proud of being lord\r\nof a thousand or two acres, and one or two hundred negroes, and fancied\r\nthat this was to rule over, as Mr. Rives called it, \"a mimic\r\ncommonwealth, with its foreign and domestic relations, and its regular\r\nadministrative hierarchy.\" He did not comprehend that the isolated life\r\nof a slave plantation was ordinarily only a kind of perpetual barbecue,\r\nwith its rough sports and vacuous leisure, where the roasted ox was\r\nlargely wasted and not always pleasant to look at. There was a rude\r\nhospitality, where food, provided by unpaid labor, was cheap and\r\nabundant, and where the host was always glad to welcome any guest who\r\nwould relieve him of his own tediousness; but there was little luxury\r\nand no refinement where there was almost no culture. Of course there\r\nwere a few homes and families of another order, where the women were\r\nrefined and the men educated; but these were the exceptions. Society\r\ngenerally, with its bluff, loud, self-confident but ignorant planters,\r\nits numerous poor whites destitute of lands and of slaves, and its mass\r\nof slaves whose aim in life was to avoid work and escape the whip, was\r\nnecessarily only one remove from semi-civilization.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to indoctrinate such a people, more arrogant than\r\nintelligent, with new ideas. By the same token it might be possible to\r\nlead them into new ways before they would find out whither they were\r\ngoing. Mr. Madison hoped to change the wretched system of plantation\r\ncommerce by a port bill, which he brought into the Assembly. Imposts\r\nrequire custom-houses, and obviously there could not be custom-houses\r\nnor even custom-officers on every plantation in the State. The bill\r\nproposed to leave open two ports of entry for all foreign ships. It\r\nwould greatly simplify matters if all the foreign trade of the State\r\ncould be limited to these two ports only. It would then be easy enough\r\nto enforce imposts, and the State would have something to surrender to\r\nthe federal government to help it to a revenue, if, happily, the time\r\nshould ever come when all the States should assent to that measure of\r\nsalvation for the Union. Not that this was the primary object of those\r\nwho favored this port law; but the question of commerce was the\r\nquestion on which everything hinged, and its regulation in each State\r\nmust needs have an influence, one way or the other, upon the possibility\r\nof strengthening, even of preserving, the Union. Everything depended\r\nupon reconciling these state interests by mutual concessions. The South\r\nwas jealous of the North, because trade flourished at the North and did\r\nnot flourish at the South. It seemed as if this was at the expense of\r\nthe South, and so, in a certain sense, it was. The problem was to find\r\nwhere the difficulty lay, and to apply the remedy.\r\n\r\nIf commerce flourished at the North, where each of the States had one or\r\ntwo ports of entry only, why should it not flourish in Virginia if\r\nregulated in the same way? If those centres of trade bred a race of\r\nmerchants, who built their own ships, bought and sold, did their own\r\ncarrying, competed with and stimulated each other, and encroached upon\r\nthe trade of the South, why should not similar results follow in\r\nVirginia if she should confine her trade to two or three ports? If the\r\nbuyer and the seller, the importer and the consumer, went to a common\r\nplace of exchange in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, and prosperity\r\nfollowed as a consequence, why should they not do the same thing at\r\nNorfolk? This was what Madison aimed to bring about by the port bill.\r\nBut it was impossible to get it through the legislature till three more\r\nports were added to the two which the bill at first proposed. When the\r\nplanters came to understand that such a law would take away their\r\ncherished privilege of trade along the banks of the rivers, wherever\r\nanybody chose to run out a little jetty, the opposition was persistent.\r\nAt every succeeding session, till the new federal Constitution was\r\nadopted, an attempt was made to repeal the act; and though that was not\r\nsuccessful, each year new ports of entry were added. It did not, indeed,\r\nmatter much whether the open ports of Virginia were two or whether they\r\nwere twenty. There was a factor in the problem which neither Mr. Madison\r\nnor anybody else would take into the account. It was possible, of\r\ncourse, if force enough were used, to break up the traffic with English\r\nships on the banks of the rivers; but when that was done, commerce would\r\nfollow its own laws, in spite of the acts of the legislature, and flow\r\ninto channels of its own choosing. It was not possible to transmute a\r\nplanting State, where labor was enslaved, into a commercial State, where\r\nlabor must be free.\r\n\r\nHowever desirous Mr. Madison might be to transfer the power over\r\ncommerce to the federal government, he was compelled, as a member of the\r\nVirginia legislature, to care first for the trade of his own State. No\r\nState could afford to neglect its own commercial interests so long as\r\nthe thirteen States remained thirteen commercial rivals. It was becoming\r\nplainer and plainer every day that, while that relation continued, the\r\nless chance there was that thirteen petty, independent States could\r\nunite into one great nation. No foreign power would make a treaty with a\r\ngovernment which could not enforce that treaty among its own people.\r\nNeither could any separate portion of that people make a treaty, as any\r\nother portion, the other side of an imaginary line, need not hold it in\r\nrespect. What good was there in revenue laws, or, indeed, in any other\r\nlaws in Massachusetts which Connecticut and Rhode Island disregarded? or\r\nin New York, if New Jersey and Pennsylvania laughed at them? or in\r\nVirginia, if Maryland held them in contempt?\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Madison felt that, if he could bring about a healthful state of\r\nthings in the trade of his own State, there was at least so much done\r\ntowards bringing about a healthful state of things in the commerce of\r\nthe whole country. There came up a practical, local question which, when\r\nthe time came, he was quick to see had a logical bearing upon the\r\ngeneral question. The Potomac was the boundary line between Virginia and\r\nMaryland; but Lord Baltimore's charter gave to Maryland jurisdiction\r\nover the river to the Virginia bank; and this right Virginia had\r\nrecognized, claiming only for herself the free navigation of the Potomac\r\nand the Pocomoke. Of course the laws of neither State were regarded when\r\nit was worth while to evade them; and nothing was easier than to evade\r\nthem, since to the average human mind there is no privilege so precious\r\nas a facility for smuggling. Nobody, at any rate, seems to have thought\r\nanything about the matter till it came under Madison's observation after\r\nhis return home from Congress. To him it meant something more than mere\r\nevasion of state laws and frauds on the state revenue. The subject fell\r\ninto line with his reflections upon the looseness of the bonds that held\r\nthe States together, and how unlikely it was that they would ever grow\r\ninto a respectable or prosperous nation while their present relations\r\ncontinued. Virtually there was no maritime law on the Potomac, and\r\nhardly even the pretense of any. What could be more absurd than to\r\nprovide ports of entry on one bank of a river, while on the other bank,\r\nfrom the source to the sea, the whole country was free to all comers? If\r\nthe laws of either State were to be regarded on the opposite bank, a\r\ntreaty was as necessary between them as between any two contiguous\r\nstates in Europe.\r\n\r\nMadison wrote to Jefferson, who was now a delegate in Congress, pointing\r\nout this anomalous condition of things on the Potomac, and suggesting\r\nthat he should confer with the Maryland delegates upon the subject. The\r\nproposal met with Jefferson's approbation; he sought an interview with\r\nMr. Stone, a delegate from Maryland, and, as he wrote to Madison,\r\n\"finding him of the same opinion, [I] have told him I would, by letters,\r\nbring the subject forward on our part. They will consider it, therefore,\r\nas originated by this conversation.\" Why \"they\" should not have been\r\npermitted to \"consider it as originated\" from Madison's suggestion that\r\nJefferson should have such a conversation is not quite plain; for it was\r\nMadison, not Jefferson, who had discovered that here was a wrong that\r\nought to be righted, and who had proposed that each State should appoint\r\ncommissioners to look into the matter and apply a remedy. So, also, so\r\nfar as subsequent negotiation on this subject had any influence in\r\nbringing about the Constitutional Convention of 1787, it was only\r\nbecause Mr. Madison, having suggested the first practical step in the\r\none case, seized an opportune moment in that negotiation to suggest a\r\nsimilar practical step in the other case. As it is so often said that\r\nthe Annapolis Convention of 1786 was the direct result of the discussion\r\nof the Potomac question, it is worth while to explain what they really\r\nhad to do with each other.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia commissioners were appointed early in the session on Mr.\r\nMadison's motion. Maryland moved more slowly, and it was not till the\r\nspring of 1785 that the commissioners met. They soon found that any\r\nefficient jurisdiction over the Potomac involved more interests than\r\nthey, or those who appointed them, had considered. Existing difficulties\r\nmight be disposed of by agreeing upon uniform duties in the two States,\r\nand this the commissioners recommended. But when the subject came before\r\nthe Maryland legislature it took a wider range.\r\n\r\nThe Potomac Company, of which Washington was president, had been\r\nchartered only a few months before. The work it proposed to do was to\r\nmake the upper Potomac navigable, and to connect it by a good road with\r\nthe Ohio River. This was to encourage the settlement of Western lands.\r\nAnother company was chartered about the same time to connect the Potomac\r\nand Delaware by a canal, where interstate traffic would be more\r\nimmediate. Pennsylvania and Delaware must necessarily have a deep\r\ninterest in both these projects, and the Maryland legislature proposed\r\nthat those States be invited to appoint commissioners to act with those\r\nwhom Maryland and Virginia had already appointed to settle the conflict\r\nbetween them upon the question of jurisdiction on the Potomac. Then it\r\noccurred to somebody: if four States can confer, why should not\r\nthirteen? The Maryland legislature thereupon suggested that all the\r\nStates be invited to send delegates to a convention to take up the whole\r\nquestion of American commerce.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on in Maryland, the Virginia legislature was\r\nconsidering petitions from the principal ports of the State praying that\r\nsome remedy might be devised for the commercial evils from which they\r\nwere all suffering. The port bill had manifestly proved a failure. It\r\nwas only a few weeks before that Madison had complained, in a letter to\r\na friend, that \"the trade of the country is in a most deplorable\r\ncondition;\" that the most \"shameful frauds\" were committed by the\r\nEnglish merchants upon those in Virginia, as well as upon the planters\r\nwho shipped their own tobacco; that the difference in the price of\r\ntobacco at Philadelphia and in Virginia was from eleven shillings to\r\nfourteen shillings in favor of the Northern ports; and that \"the price\r\nof merchandise here is, at least, as much above, as that of tobacco is\r\nbelow, the Northern standard.\" He was only the more confirmed in his\r\nopinion that there was no cure for these radical evils except to\r\nsurrender to the confederate government complete control over commerce.\r\nThe debate upon these petitions was hot and long. It brought out the\r\nstrongest men on both sides, Madison leading those who wished to give to\r\nCongress the power to regulate trade with foreign countries when no\r\ntreaty existed; to make uniform commercial laws for all the States; and\r\nto levy an impost of five per cent. on imported merchandise, as a\r\nprovision for the public debt and for the support of the federal\r\ngovernment generally. A committee, of which he was a member, at length\r\nreported instructions to the delegates of the State in Congress to labor\r\nfor the consent of all the States to these propositions. But in\r\nCommittee of the Whole the resolutions were so changed and\r\nqualified--especially in limiting to thirteen years the period for which\r\nCongress was to be intrusted with a power so essential to the existence\r\nof the government--that the measure was given up by its friends as\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nBut before the report was disposed of Mr. Madison prepared a\r\nresolution, to be offered as a substitute, with the hope of reaching the\r\nsame end in another way. This resolution provided for the appointment of\r\nfive commissioners,--Madison to be one of them,--\"who, or any three of\r\nwhom, shall meet such commissioners as may be appointed in the other\r\nStates of the Union, at a time and place to be agreed on, to take into\r\nconsideration the trade of the United States; to examine the relative\r\nsituations and trade of said States; to consider how far a uniform\r\nsystem in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common\r\ninterest and their permanent harmony; and to report to the several\r\nStates such an act, relative to this great object, as, when unanimously\r\nratified by them, will enable the United States, in Congress,\r\neffectually to provide for the same.\" This he was careful not to offer\r\nhimself, but, as he says, it was \"introduced by Mr. Tyler, an\r\ninfluential member, who, having never served in Congress, had more the\r\near of the House than those whose services there exposed them to an\r\nimputable bias.\" He adds that \"it was so little acceptable that it was\r\nnot then persisted in.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the action of the Maryland legislature on the\r\nPotomac question, and the report of the Potomac commissioners, came up\r\nfor consideration. Mr. Madison said afterward that, as Maryland thought\r\nthe concurrence of Pennsylvania and Delaware were necessary to the\r\nregulation of trade on that river, so those States would, probably,\r\nwish to ask for the concurrence of their neighbors in any proposed\r\narrangement. \"So apt and forcible an illustration,\" he adds, \"of the\r\nnecessity of an uniformity throughout all the States could not but favor\r\nthe passage of a resolution which proposed a convention having that for\r\nits object.\"\r\n\r\nAs one of the Potomac commissioners, he knew, of course, what was coming\r\nfrom Maryland, and \"how apt and forcible an illustration\" it would seem,\r\nwhen it did come, of that resolution which he had written and had\r\ninduced Mr. Tyler to offer. It did not matter that the resolution had\r\nbeen at the moment \"so little acceptable,\" and therefore \"not then\r\npersisted in.\" It was where it was sure, in the political slang of our\r\nday, to do the most good. And so it came about. All that Maryland had\r\nproposed, growing out of the consideration of the Potomac question, the\r\nVirginia legislature acceded to. Then, on the last day of the session,\r\nthe Madison-Tyler resolution was taken from the table, where it had lain\r\nquietly for nearly two months, and passed. If some, who had been\r\ncontending all winter against any action which should lead to a\r\npossibility of strengthening the federal government, failed to see how\r\nimportant a step they had taken to that very end; if any, who were\r\nfearful of federal usurpation and tenacious of state rights, were blind\r\nto the fact that the resolution had pushed aside the Potomac question\r\nand put the Union question in its place, Mr. Madison, we may be sure,\r\nwas not one of that number. He had gained that for which he had been\r\nstriving for years.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed by the resolution soon came together. They\r\nappointed Annapolis as the place, and the second Monday of the following\r\nSeptember (1786) as the time, of the proposed national convention; and\r\nthey sent to all the other States an invitation to send delegates to\r\nthat convention.\r\n\r\nOn September 11 commissioners from Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New\r\nJersey, and New York assembled at Annapolis. Others had been appointed\r\nby North Carolina, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, but\r\nthey were not present. Georgia, South Carolina, Maryland, and\r\nConnecticut had taken no action upon the subject. As five States only\r\nwere represented, the commissioners \"did not conceive it advisable to\r\nproceed on the business of their mission,\" but they adopted an address,\r\nwritten by Alexander Hamilton, to be sent to all the States.\r\n\r\nAll the represented States, the address said, had authorized their\r\ncommissioners \"to take into consideration the trade and commerce of the\r\nUnited States; to consider how far an uniform system in their commercial\r\nintercourse and regulations might be necessary to their common interest\r\nand permanent harmony.\" But New Jersey had gone farther than this; her\r\ndelegates were instructed \"to consider how far an uniform system in\r\ntheir commercial regulations _and other important matters_ might be\r\nnecessary to the common interest and permanent harmony of the several\r\nStates.\" This, the commissioners present thought, \"was an improvement on\r\nthe original plan, and will deserve to be incorporated into that of a\r\nfuture convention.\" They gave their reasons at length for this opinion,\r\nand, in conclusion, urged that commissioners from all the States be\r\nappointed to meet in convention at Philadelphia on the second Monday of\r\nthe following May (1787), \"to devise such further provisions as shall\r\nappear to them necessary to render the Constitution of the federal\r\ngovernment adequate to the exigencies of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of the winter delegates to this convention were chosen by\r\nthe several States. Virginia was the first to choose her delegates;\r\nMadison was among them, and at their head was George Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIN THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Annapolis Convention ever met to make smooth the way for the\r\nmore important one which came together eight months afterward and framed\r\na permanent Constitution for the United States was unquestionably due to\r\nthe persistence and the political adroitness of Mr. Madison. But it was\r\nnot exceptional work. The same diligence and devotion to public duty\r\nmark the whole of this period of three years through which he continued\r\na member of the state legislature. As chairman of the judiciary\r\ncommittee he reduced with much labor the old colonial statutes to a body\r\nof laws befitting the condition of free citizens in an independent\r\nState. From his first to his last session he contended, though without\r\nsuccess, for the faith of treaties and the honest payment of debts. The\r\ntreaty with England provided that there should be \"no lawful impediment\r\non either side to the recovery of debts heretofore contracted.\" The\r\nlegislature notified Congress that it should disregard this provision,\r\non the plea that in relation to \"slaves and other property\" it had not\r\nbeen observed by Great Britain. Mr. Madison did not then know that--as\r\nhe said three years later--\"the infractions [of the treaty] on the part\r\nof the United States preceded even the violation on the other side in\r\nthe instance of the negroes.\" He maintained, nevertheless, that the\r\nsettlement of the difficulty, if it had any real foundation, belonged to\r\nCongress, the party to the treaty, and not to a State which had\r\nsurrendered the treaty-making power; and that in common honesty one\r\nplanter was not relieved from his obligation to pay a London merchant\r\nfor goods and merchandise received before the war, because other\r\nplanters had not been paid for the negroes and horses they had lost when\r\nthe British troops invaded Virginia. At each of the three sessions of\r\nthe legislature, while he was a member, he tried to bring that body to\r\nadopt some line of conduct which should not--to use his own\r\nwords--\"extremely dishonor us and embarrass Congress.\" It was useless;\r\nthe repudiators were quite deaf to any appeals either to their honor or\r\ntheir patriotism.\r\n\r\nOn another question both he and his State were more fortunate. Religious\r\nfreedom had to be once more fought for, and he was quick to come to the\r\ndefense of a right which had first called forth his youthful enthusiasm.\r\nTwo measures were brought forward from session to session to secure for\r\nthe church the support of the state. The first was a bill for the\r\nincorporation of religious societies; but when it was pushed to its\r\nfinal passage it provided for the incorporation of Episcopal churches\r\nonly. For this Mr. Madison consented to vote, though with reluctance, in\r\nthe hope that the church party would be so far satisfied with this\r\nmeasure as to abstain from pushing another which was still more\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nHe was disappointed. Naturally those who had carried their first point\r\nwere the more, not the less, anxious for further success. Now it was\r\ninsisted that there should be a universal tax \"for the support of\r\nteachers of the Christian religion.\" The tax-payer was to be permitted\r\nto name the religious society for the support of which he preferred to\r\ncontribute. If he declined this voluntary acquiescence in the law, the\r\nmoney would be used in aid of a school; but from the tax itself none\r\nwere to be exempt on any pretext. Madison was quick to see in such a law\r\nthe possibility of religious intolerance, of compulsory uniformity\r\nenforced by the civil power, and of the suppression of any freedom of\r\nconscience or opinion. The act did not define who were and who were not\r\n\"teachers of the Christian religion,\" and that necessarily would be left\r\nto the courts to decide. A state church would be the inevitable\r\nconsequence; for it was not to be supposed that any dominant sect would\r\nrest till it secured the recognition by law of its own denomination as\r\nthe sole representative of the Christian religion. To expect anything\r\nelse was to ignore the teachings of all history.\r\n\r\nThe burden of opposition and debate fell, at first, almost solely upon\r\nMadison. Some of the wisest and best men of the State were slow to see,\r\nas he saw, that religious freedom was in danger from such legislation.\r\nThere was, it was said, a sad falling-off in public morality as\r\nindifference to religion increased. There was no cure, it was declared,\r\nfor prevalent and growing corruption except in the culture of the\r\nreligious sentiment, and the teachers of religion, therefore, must be\r\nupheld and supported. But granting all this, Madison saw that the\r\nproposed remedy would be to give, not bread but a stone, and a stone\r\nthat would be used in return as a weapon. It was impossible to regulate\r\nreligious belief by act of the Assembly, and therefore it was worse than\r\nfoolish to try.\r\n\r\nIt was due to him that the question was postponed from one session to\r\nthe next. A copy of the bill was sent, meanwhile, into every county of\r\nthe State for the consideration of the people, and that was aided by a\r\n\"Memorial and Remonstrance,\" written by Madison, which was circulated\r\neverywhere for signature, in readiness for presentation to the next\r\nlegislature. The bill, the memorial said, would be \"a dangerous abuse of\r\npower,\" and the signers protested against it with unanswerable\r\narguments, taking for a starting-point the assertion of the Bill of\r\nRights, \"that religion, or the duty we owe to our Creator, and the\r\nmanner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and\r\nconviction, not by force or violence.\" It is not at all improbable that\r\nmany signed this remonstrance, not so much because they believed it to\r\nbe true as because it was a protest against a tax; that others were more\r\nmoved by jealousy of the power of the Episcopal Church than they were by\r\nanxiety to protect religious liberty outside of their own sects. But\r\nwhatever the motives, the movement was too formidable to be disregarded.\r\nIt was made a test question in the election of members for the\r\nlegislature of 1785-86; at that session the bill for the support of\r\nreligious teachers was rejected, and in place of it was passed \"an act\r\nfor establishing religious freedom,\" written by Jefferson seven years\r\nbefore. This provided \"that no man shall be compelled to frequent or\r\nsupport any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall\r\nbe enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods,\r\nnor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or\r\nbelief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument\r\nmaintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall\r\nin no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\"[8]\r\n\r\nIn the memorial and remonstrance Madison had said: \"If this freedom be\r\nabused, it is an offense against God, not against man. To God,\r\ntherefore, not to man, must an account of it be rendered.\" If the people\r\nof Virginia did not clearly comprehend this doctrine in all its length\r\nand breadth a hundred years ago, it is not quite easy to say who were\r\nthen, or who are now, at liberty to throw stones at them. The assertion\r\nof the broadest religious freedom was no more new then than it is true\r\nthat persecution for opinion's sake is now only an ancient evil. It was\r\nnot till fifty years after Virginia had refused to tax her citizens for\r\nthe support of religious teachers that Massachusetts repealed the law\r\nthat had long imposed a similar burden upon her people.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1786, the last year of Madison's service in the Virginia\r\nAssembly before he returned to Congress, that the craze of paper money\r\nbroke out again through all the States. The measure was carried in most\r\nof them, followed in the end by the usual disastrous consequences.\r\nMadison's anxiety was great lest his own State should be carried away by\r\nthis delusion, and he led the opposition against some petitions sent to\r\nthe Assembly praying for an issue of currency. The vote against it was\r\ntoo large to be due altogether to his influence; but he gave great\r\nstrength and concentration to the opposition. In Virginia, tobacco\r\ncertificates supplied in some measure the want of a circulating medium,\r\nand it was, therefore, easier there than in some of the other States to\r\nresist the clamor for a paper substitute for real money. A tobacco\r\ncertificate at least represented something worth money. Madison assented\r\nto a bill which authorized the use of such certificates. But his\r\n\"acquiescence,\" he wrote to Washington, \"was extorted by a fear that\r\nsome greater evil, under the name of relief to the people, would be\r\nsubstituted.\" He was \"far from being sure,\" he added, that he \"did\r\nright.\" But no evils with which he had to reproach himself followed that\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThese three years of his life were probably among the happiest, if they\r\nwere not altogether the happiest, in his long public career. There was\r\nlittle disappointment or anxiety, and evidently much genuine\r\nsatisfaction as he saw how certainly he was gaining a high place in the\r\nestimation of his fellow-citizens for his devotion to the best interests\r\nof his native State. In the recesses of the legislature he had leisure\r\nfor studies in which he evidently found great contentment. He traveled a\r\ngood deal at intervals, especially at the North; learned much of the\r\nresources and character of the people outside of Virginia, and became\r\nacquainted with the leading men among them. Jefferson urged him to pass\r\na summer with him in Paris; and some foreign diplomatic service was open\r\nto him, had he expressed a willingness to accept it. But he preferred to\r\nknow something more of his own country while he had the leisure; and if\r\nhis life was to be passed in public service, as now seemed probable to\r\nhim, he chose, at least for the present, to serve his country at home,\r\nwhere he thought he was more needed, rather than abroad. In his orders\r\nfor books sent to Jefferson the direction of his studies is evident. He\r\nsought largely for those which treated of the science of government; but\r\nthey were not confined to that subject. Natural history had great charms\r\nfor him. He was a diligent student of Buffon, and was anxious to find,\r\nif possible, the plates of his thirty-one volumes, in colors, that he\r\nmight adorn the walls of his room with them. He made careful comparisons\r\nbetween the animals of other continents, as described and portrayed by\r\nthe naturalist, and similar orders in America. All new inventions\r\ninterested him. \"I am so pleased,\" he writes, \"with the new invented\r\nlamp that I shall not grudge two guineas for one of them.\" He had seen\r\n\"a pocket compass of somewhat larger diameter than a watch, and which\r\nmay be carried in the same way. It has a spring for stopping the\r\nvibration of the needle when not in use. One of these would be very\r\nconvenient in case of a ramble into the western country.\" A small\r\ntelescope, he suggests, might be fitted on as a handle to a cane, which\r\nmight \"be a source of many little gratifications,\" when \"in walks for\r\nexercise or amusement objects present themselves which it might be\r\nmatter of curiosity to inspect, but which it was difficult or impossible\r\nto approach.\" Jefferson writes him of a new invention, a pedometer; and\r\nhe wants one for his own pocket. Trifles like these show the bent of his\r\nmind; and they show a contented mind as well.\r\n\r\nWhile writing of important acts of the legislature of 1785, he is\r\ncareful to give other information in a letter to Jefferson, which is not\r\nuninteresting as written ninety-eight years ago, and written by him.\r\n\r\n     \"I. Rumsey,\" he says, \"by a memorial to the last session,\r\n     represented that he had invented a mechanism by which a boat might\r\n     be worked with little labor, at the rate of from twenty-five to\r\n     forty miles a day, against a stream running at the rate of ten\r\n     miles an hour, and prayed that the disclosure of his invention\r\n     might be purchased by the public. The apparent extravagance of his\r\n     pretensions brought a ridicule upon them, and nothing was done. In\r\n     the recess of the Assembly he exemplified his machinery to General\r\n     Washington and a few other gentlemen, who gave a certificate of the\r\n     reality and importance of the invention, which opened the ears of\r\n     this Assembly to a second memorial. The act gives a monopoly for\r\n     ten years, reserving a right to abolish it at any time by paying\r\n     £10,000. The inventor is soliciting similar acts from other States,\r\n     and will not, I suppose, publish the secret till he either obtains\r\n     or despairs of them.\"\r\n\r\nThis intelligence was evidently not unheeded by Jefferson. In writing,\r\nsome months after he received it, to a friend on the application of\r\nsteam-power to grist-mills, then lately introduced in England, he adds:\r\n\"I hear you are applying the same agent in America to navigate boats,\r\nand I have little doubt but that it will be applied generally to\r\nmachines, so as to supersede the use of water-ponds, and of course to\r\nlay open all the streams for navigation.\" Nor does Madison seem to have\r\nbeen one of those who doubted if anything was to come of Rumsey's\r\ninvention. All this was less than a hundred years ago, and now there is\r\na steam-ferry between New York and Europe running about twice a day.\r\n\r\nIn a similar letter, a year later, he is careful, among grave political\r\nmatters, to remember and report to the same friend that in the sinking\r\nof a well in Richmond, on the declivity of a hill, there had been found,\r\n\"about seventy feet below the surface, several large bones, apparently\r\nbelonging to a fish not less than the shark; and, what is more\r\nsingular, several fragments of potter's ware in the style of the\r\nIndians. Before he [the digger] reached these curiosities he passed\r\nthrough about fifty feet of soft blue clay.\" Mr. Madison had only just\r\nheard of this discovery, and he had not seen the unearthed fragments.\r\nBut he evidently accepts the story as true in coming from\r\n\"unexceptionable witnesses.\" He adds, as a corroboration, that he is\r\ntold by a friend from Washington County of the finding there, in the\r\nsinking of a salt-well, \"of the hip-bone of the incognitum, the socket\r\nof which was about eight inches in diameter.\" Such things were\r\npeculiarly interesting to Jefferson, and Madison was too devoted a\r\nfriend to him to leave them unnoticed. But they were hardly less\r\ninteresting to himself, though he had not much of Jefferson's habit of\r\nscientific investigation. That \"the potter's ware in the style of the\r\nIndians\" should be found so deeply buried only seems to him \"singular;\"\r\nnor, indeed, is there any record, so far as we know, that this\r\nparticular fact was any more suggestive to Jefferson, though apparently\r\nso likely to arouse his inquiring mind to seek for some satisfactory\r\nexplanation. But his geological notions were too positive to admit even\r\nof a doubt as to the age of man. Supposing a Creator, he assumed that\r\n\"he created the earth at once, nearly in the state in which we see it,\r\nfit for the preservation of the beings he placed on it.\" Theorist as he\r\nwas himself, he had little patience with the other theorists who were\r\nalready beginning to discover in the structure of the earth the evidence\r\nof successive geological eras. The different strata of rocks and their\r\ninclination gave him no trouble. He explained them all by the assumption\r\nthat \"rock grows, and it seems that it grows in layers in every\r\ndirection, as the branches of trees grow in all directions.\" That\r\nevidences of the existence of man should be found with a superimposed\r\nweight of earth seventy feet in thickness would present to him no\r\ndifficulty. If the fact had specially aroused his attention he would\r\nhave explained it in some ingenious way as the result of accident.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: With how much interest Jefferson watched the progress of\r\nthis controversy he showed in his letters from Paris. In February, 1786,\r\nhe wrote to Madison: \"I thank you for the communication of the\r\nremonstrance against the assessment. Mazzei, who is now in Holland,\r\npromised me to have it published in the _Leyden Gazette_. It will do us\r\ngreat honor. I wish it may be as much approved by our Assembly as by the\r\nwisest part of Europe.\" Again, in December of the same year, he says:\r\n\"The Virginia Act for religious freedom has been received with infinite\r\napprobation in Europe, and propagated with enthusiasm. I do not mean by\r\nthe governments, but by the individuals who compose them. It has been\r\ntranslated into French and Italian, has been sent to most of the courts\r\nof Europe, and has been the best evidence of the falsehood of those\r\nreports which stated us to be in anarchy. It is inserted in the\r\n_Encyclopédie_, and is appearing in most of the publications respecting\r\nAmerica. In fact, it is comfortable to see the standard of reason at\r\nlength erected, after so many ages, during which the human mind had been\r\nheld in vassalage by kings, priests, and nobles; and it is honorable for\r\nus to have produced the first legislature who had the courage to declare\r\nthat the reason of man may be trusted with the formation of his own\r\nopinions!\" This latter passage is characteristic, and many who do not\r\nlike Jefferson will read between the lines the exultation of a man who\r\nwas not always careful to draw the line between religious liberty and\r\nirreligious license.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DISTURBANCES AND ANXIETIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1787, Madison again took a seat in Congress. It was an\r\nanxious period. Shays's rebellion in Massachusetts had assumed rather\r\nformidable possibilities, and seemed not unlikely to spread to other\r\nStates. Till this storm should blow over, the important business of\r\nCongress was to raise money and troops; in reality, to go to the help of\r\nMassachusetts, if need should be, though the object ostensibly was to\r\nprotect a handful of people on the frontier against the Indians. It was\r\na striking instance of the imbecility of the government under the\r\nArticles of Confederation, that it could only undertake to suppress\r\nrebellion in a State under the pretense of doing something else which\r\ncame within the law. Massachusetts, it is true, was quite able to deal\r\nwith her insurgents; but when Congress convened it was not known in New\r\nYork that Lincoln had dispersed the main body of them at Petersham.\r\nNevertheless, a like difficulty might arise at any moment in any other\r\nof the States, where the strength to meet it might be quite inadequate.\r\n\r\nMadison's ideal still was, the Union before the States, and for the\r\nsake of the States; the whole before the parts, to save the parts; the\r\nbinding the fagot together that the sticks might not be lost. \"Our\r\nsituation,\" he wrote to Edmund Randolph in February, \"is becoming every\r\nday more and more critical. No money comes into the federal treasury; no\r\nrespect is paid to the federal authority; and people of reflection\r\nunanimously agree that the existing Confederacy is tottering to its\r\nfoundation. Many individuals of weight, particularly in the eastern\r\ndistrict, are suspected of leaning toward monarchy. Other individuals\r\npredict a partition of the States into two or more confederacies. It is\r\npretty certain that if some radical amendment of the single one cannot\r\nbe devised and introduced, one or the other of these revolutions, the\r\nlatter no doubt, will take place.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that Madison himself may have had some faith in\r\nthis suspicion that \"individuals of weight in the eastern district\" were\r\ninclined to a monarchy. For such suspicion, however there could be\r\nlittle real foundation. There were, doubtless, men of weight who thought\r\nand said that monarchy was better than anarchy. There were, doubtless,\r\nimpatient men then who thought and said, as there are impatient men now\r\nwho think and say, that the rule of a king is better than the rule of\r\nthe people. But there was no disloyalty to government by the people\r\namong those who only maintained that the English in America must draw\r\nfrom the common heritage of English institutions and English law the\r\nmaterial wherewith to build up the foundations of a new nation. No\r\nintelligent and candid man doubts now that they were wise; nor would it\r\nhave been long doubted then, had it not so speedily become manifest\r\nthat, if the stigma of \"British\" was once affixed to a political party,\r\nany appeal from popular prejudice to reason and common sense was\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nThere were a few persons who would have done away with the divisions of\r\nStates and establish in their place a central government. Those most\r\nearnest in maintaining the autonomy of States declared that such a\r\ngovernment was, as Luther Martin of Maryland called it, of \"a\r\nmonarchical nature.\" What else could that be but a monarchy? An\r\ninsinuation took on the form of a logical deduction and became a popular\r\nfallacy. Yet those most earnest for a central government only sought to\r\nestablish a stable rule in place of no rule at all; or, worse still, of\r\nthe tyranny of an ignorant and vicious mob under the outraged name of\r\ndemocracy, into which there was danger of drifting. Whether their plan\r\nwas wise or foolish, it did not mean a monarchy. Even of Shays's\r\nmisguided followers Jefferson said: \"I believe you may be assured that\r\nan idea or desire of returning to anything like their ancient government\r\nnever entered into their heads.\" As Madison knew and said, the real\r\ndanger was that the States would divide into two confederacies, and only\r\nby a new and wiser and stronger union could that calamity be averted.\r\n\r\nTo gain the assent of most of the States to a convention was surmounting\r\nonly the least of the difficulties. Three weeks before the time of\r\nmeeting Madison wrote: \"The nearer the crisis approaches, the more I\r\ntremble for the issue. The necessity of gaining the concurrence of the\r\nconvention in some system that will answer the purpose, the subsequent\r\napprobation of Congress, and the final sanction of the States, present a\r\nseries of chances which would inspire despair in any case where the\r\nalternative was less formidable.\" He said, in the first month of the\r\nsession of that body, that \"the States were divided into different\r\ninterests, not by their difference of size, but by other circumstances;\r\nthe most material of which resulted partly from climate, but principally\r\nfrom the effects of their having or not having slaves. These two causes\r\nconcurred in forming the great division of interests in the United\r\nStates. It did not lie between the large and small States. It lay\r\nbetween the Northern and Southern.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier weeks of this session of Congress, and, indeed, for\r\nsome months before, events had made so manifest this difference of\r\ninterest, coincident with the difference in latitude, that there seemed\r\nlittle ground for hope that any good would come out of a constitutional\r\nconvention. The old question of the navigation of the Mississippi was\r\nagain agitated. The South held her right to that river to be of much\r\nmore value than anything she could gain by a closer union with the\r\nNorth, and she was quite ready to go to war with Spain in defense of it.\r\nOn the other hand, the Northern States were quite indifferent to the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi, and not disposed apparently to make any\r\nexertion or sacrifice to secure it. Just now they were anxious to secure\r\na commercial treaty with Spain; but Spain insisted, as a preliminary\r\ncondition, that the United States should relinquish all claim to\r\nnavigation upon a river whose mouths were within Spanish territory. In\r\nthe Northern mind there was no doubt of the value of trade with Spain;\r\nand there was a good deal of doubt whether there was anything worth\r\ncontending for in the right to sail upon a river running through a\r\nwilderness where, as yet, there were few inhabitants, and hardly any\r\ntrade worth talking about. More than that, there was unquestionably a\r\nnot uncommon belief at the North and East that the settlement and\r\nprosperity of the West would be at the expense of the Atlantic States.\r\nPerhaps that view of the matter was not loudly insisted upon; but many\r\nwere none the less persuaded that, if population was attracted westward\r\nby the hope of acquiring rich and cheap lands, prosperity and power\r\nwould go with it. At any rate, those of this way of thinking were not\r\ninclined to forego a certain good for that which would profit them\r\nnothing, and might do them lasting harm.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, spoken and unspoken, the Northern members of Congress\r\nwere at first quite willing, for the sake of a commercial treaty, to\r\nconcede to Spain the exclusive control of the Mississippi. But to pacify\r\nthe South it was proposed that the concession to Spain should be for\r\nonly five and twenty years. If at the end of that period the navigation\r\nof the Mississippi should be worth contending for, the question could be\r\nreopened. The South was, of course, rather exasperated than pacified by\r\nsuch a proposition. The navigation of the river had not only a certain\r\nvalue to them now, but it was theirs by right, and that was reason\r\nenough for not parting with it even for a limited period. Concessions\r\nnow would make the reassertion of the right the more difficult by and\r\nby. If it must be fought for, it would lessen the chance of success to\r\nput off the fighting five and twenty years. Indeed, it could not be put\r\noff, for war was already begun in a small way. The Spaniards had seized\r\nAmerican boats on trading voyages down the river, and the Americans had\r\nretaliated upon some petty Spanish settlements. Spain, moreover, seemed\r\nat first no more inclined to listen to compromise than the South was.\r\n\r\nEngland watched this controversy with interest. She had no expectation\r\nof recovering for herself the Floridas, which she had lost in the war of\r\nthe Revolution, and had finally ceded to Spain by the treaty of 1783;\r\nbut she was quite willing to see that power get into trouble on the\r\nMississippi question, and more than willing that it should threaten the\r\npeace and union of the States. Her own boundary line west of the\r\nAlleghanies might possibly be extended far south of the Great Lakes, if\r\nthe Northern and Southern States should divide into two confederacies;\r\nbut, apart from any lust of territory, she rejoiced at anything that\r\nthreatened to check the growth of her late colonies.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, the question was disposed of, before the\r\nConstitutional Convention met at Philadelphia, by the failure to secure\r\na treaty. The Spanish minister, Guardoqui, consented, at length, after\r\nlong resistance, to accept as a compromise the navigation of the river\r\nfor five and twenty years; but Mr. Jay, who was willing, could he have\r\nhad his way, to concede anything, found at that stage of the\r\nnegotiations he could not command votes enough in Congress to secure a\r\ntreaty even in that modified form. Hitherto he had relied upon a\r\nresolution passed by Congress in August, 1786, by the vote of seven\r\nNorthern States against five Southern. This, it was assumed, repealed a\r\nresolution of the year before, and authorized the secretary to make a\r\ntreaty. The resolution of the year before, August, 1785, had been passed\r\nby the votes of nine States, and was in confirmation of a provision of\r\nthe Articles of Confederation declaring that \"no treaties with foreign\r\npowers should be entered into but by the assent of nine States.\" The\r\nminority contended that such a resolution could not be repealed by the\r\nvote of only seven States, for that would be to violate a fundamental\r\ncondition of the Articles of Confederation. It is easy to see now that\r\nthere ought not to have been a difference among honorable men on such a\r\npoint as that. Nevertheless Mr. Jay, supported by some of the strongest\r\nNorthern men, held that the votes of seven States could be made, in a\r\nroundabout way, to authorize an act which the Constitution declared\r\nshould never be lawful except with the assent of nine States. So the\r\nsecretary went on with his negotiations and came to terms with the\r\nSpanish minister.\r\n\r\nIn April the secretary was called upon to report to Congress what was\r\nthe position of these negotiations. Then it first publicly appeared that\r\na treaty was actually agreed upon which gave up the right to the\r\nMississippi for a quarter of a century. But it was also speedily made\r\nplain by various parliamentary motions that the seven votes, which the\r\nfriends of such a treaty had relied upon, had fallen from seven--even\r\ncould that number in the end have been of use--to, at best, four. The\r\nNew Jersey delegates had been instructed not to consent to the surrender\r\nof the American right to the use of the Mississippi; a new delegate from\r\nPennsylvania had changed the vote of that State; and Rhode Island had\r\nalso gone over to the other side. \"It was considered, on the whole,\"\r\nwrote Madison, \"that the project for shutting the Mississippi was at an\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\nThese details are not unimportant. Forty-five years afterward Madison\r\nwrote that \"his main object, in returning to Congress at this time, was\r\nto bring about, if possible, the canceling of Mr. Jay's project for\r\nshutting the Mississippi.\" Probably it had occurred to nobody then that\r\nwithin less than twenty years the Province of Louisiana would belong to\r\nthe United States, when their right to the navigation of the river could\r\nbe no longer disputed. But so long as both its banks from the\r\nthirty-first degree of latitude southward to the Gulf remained foreign\r\nterritory, it was of the last importance to the Southern States, whose\r\nterritory extended to the Mississippi, that the right of way should not\r\nbe surrendered. If a treaty with Spain could be carried that gave up\r\nthis right, and the Southern States should be compelled to choose\r\nbetween the loss of the Mississippi and the loss of the Union, there\r\ncould be little doubt as to what their choice would be. It was not a\r\nquestion to be postponed till after the Philadelphia Convention had\r\nconvened; if not disposed of before, the convention might as well not\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nMadison's letters, while the question was pending, show great anxiety.\r\nHe was glad to know that the South was of one mind on this subject and\r\nwould not yield an inch. He was quite confident that his own State would\r\ntake the lead, as she soon did, in the firm avowal of Southern opinion.\r\nBut he rejoiced that the question did not come up in the Virginia\r\nlegislature till after the act was passed to send delegates to the\r\nPhiladelphia Convention. That he looked upon as a point gained, and the\r\ndelegates were presently appointed; but he still despaired of any good\r\ncoming of the convention, unless \"Mr. Jay's project for shutting the\r\nMississippi\" could be first got rid of.\r\n\r\nIn a recent work[9] Mr. Madison is represented as having \"struck a\r\nbargain\" with the Kentucky delegates to the Virginia Assembly, agreeing\r\nto speak on behalf of a petition relating to the Mississippi question,\r\nprovided the delegates from Kentucky--then a part of Virginia--would\r\nvote for the representation of Virginia at Philadelphia. A \"bargain\"\r\nimplies an exchange of one thing for another, and Madison had no\r\nconvictions in favor of closing the Mississippi to exchange for a\r\nservice rendered on behalf of a measure for which he wished to secure\r\nvotes. Moreover, no bargain was necessary. It was not easy to find\r\nanybody in Virginia who needed to be persuaded that the right to the\r\nMississippi must not be surrendered. Madison wrote to Monroe in October,\r\n1786, that it would \"be defended by the legislature with as much zeal as\r\ncould be wished. Indeed, the only danger is that too much resentment may\r\nbe indulged by many against the federal councils.\" His only apprehension\r\nwas lest the Mississippi question should come up in the Assembly before\r\nthe report from the Annapolis Convention should be disposed of, for if\r\nthat were accepted the appointment of delegates to Philadelphia was\r\nassured. \"I hope,\" he wrote to Washington in November, \"the report will\r\nbe called for before the business of the Mississippi begins to ferment.\"\r\nIt happened as he wished. \"The recommendation from Annapolis,\" he wrote\r\nagain a week later, \"in favor of a general revision of the federal\r\nsystem was _unanimously_ agreed to\" (the emphasis is his own). He\r\nafterward reported to Jefferson \"that the project for bartering the\r\nMississippi to Spain was brought before the Assembly after the preceding\r\nmeasure had been adopted.\" There was neither delay nor difficulty in\r\nsecuring the unanimous consent of the Assembly to resolutions\r\ninstructing the members of Congress to oppose any concession to Spain.\r\nBut Madison's anxiety was not in the least relieved by the speedy\r\nappointment of delegates to the Philadelphia Convention; for, he wrote\r\npresently to Washington, \"I am entirely convinced, from what I observe\r\nhere (at Richmond), that, unless the project of Congress can be\r\nreversed, the hopes of carrying this State into a proper federal system\r\nwill be demolished.\" He had already said, in the same letter, that the\r\nresolutions on the Mississippi question had been \"agreed to unanimously\r\nin the House of Delegates,\" and three days before the letter was written\r\nthe delegates to Philadelphia had been appointed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _A History of the People of the United States._ Vol. i. By\r\nJohn Bach McMaster.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Madison is called \"the Father of the Constitution.\" A paper written\r\nby him was laid before his colleagues of Virginia, before the meeting of\r\nthe Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia, and was made the basis of\r\nthe \"Virginia plan,\" as it was called, out of which the Constitution was\r\nevolved. In another way his name is so identified with it that one\r\ncannot be forgotten so long as the other is remembered. From that full\r\nand faithful report of the proceedings of the convention, in which his\r\nown part was so active and conspicuous, we know most that we do or ever\r\ncan know of the perplexities and trials, the concessions and triumphs,\r\nthe acts of wisdom and the acts of weakness, of that body of men whose\r\ncoming together time has shown to have been one of the important events\r\nin the history of mankind.\r\n\r\nThen it is also true that no man had worked harder, perhaps none had\r\nworked so hard, to bring the public mind to a serious consideration of\r\naffairs and a recognition of the necessity of reorganizing the\r\ngovernment, if the States were to be held together. Never, it seemed,\r\nhad men better reason to be satisfied with the result of their labors\r\nwhen, a few months later, the new Constitution was accepted by all the\r\nStates. Yet the time was not far distant when even Madison would be in\r\ndoubt as to the character of this new bond of union, and as to what sort\r\nof government had been secured by it. Nor till he had been dead near\r\nthirty years was it to be determined what union under the Constitution\r\nreally meant; nor till three quarters of a century after the adoption of\r\nthat instrument was the more perfect union formed, justice established,\r\ndomestic tranquillity insured, the general welfare promoted, and the\r\nblessings of liberty secured to all the people, which by that great\r\ncharter it was intended, in 1787, to ordain and establish. All the\r\ndifficulties, which they who framed it escaped by their work, were as\r\nnothing to those which it entailed upon their descendants.\r\n\r\nTwo parties went into the convention. On one point, of course, they were\r\nagreed, else they would never have come together at all,--that a united\r\ngovernment under the Articles of Confederation was a failure, and,\r\nunless some remedy should be speedily devised, States with common local\r\ninterests would gravitate into separate and perhaps antagonistic\r\nnationalities. But the differences between these two parties were\r\nradical, and for a time seemed insurmountable. One proposed simply to\r\nrepair the Articles of Confederation as they might overhaul a machine\r\nthat was out of gear; the other proposed to form an altogether new\r\nConstitution. One wanted a merely federal government; not, however,\r\nmeaning by that term what the other party--soon, nevertheless, to be\r\nknown as Federalists--were striving for, but a confederation of States,\r\neach independent of all the rest and supreme in its own right, while\r\nconsenting to unite with the rest in a limited government for the\r\nadministration of certain common interests.[10]\r\n\r\nThis idea of the independence of the States was a survival of the old\r\ncolonial system, when each colony under its distinct relation to the\r\ncrown had attained a growth of its own with its separate interests. Each\r\nof these colonies had become a State. The Revolution had secured to\r\neach, it was maintained, a separate independence, achieved, it was true,\r\nby united efforts, but not therefore binding them together as a single\r\nnation. It was held as a legitimate result of that doctrine that each\r\nState, not the people of the State, whether many or few, should be\r\nrepresented by the same number of votes in a federal government as they\r\nwere under the Articles of Confederation, because such a government was\r\na union of States, not of a people.\r\n\r\nAll men, it was argued,--going back to a state of nature,--are equally\r\nfree and independent; and when a government is formed every man has an\r\nequal share by natural right in its formation and in its subsequent\r\nconduct. While numbers are few, every member of the State exercises his\r\nindividual right in person, and none can rightfully do more than this,\r\nhowever wise, or powerful, or rich he may be. But when government by the\r\nwhole body of the people becomes cumbersome and inconvenient through\r\nincrease of numbers, the individual citizen loses none of his rights by\r\nintrusting their exercise to representatives, in choosing and\r\ninstructing whom all have an equal voice. So when States are united in a\r\nconfederacy each State has the same relation to that government that\r\nindividuals have to each other in a single State. They are free and\r\nequal, and none has a larger share of rights in the confederacy because\r\nits people are more numerous, or because it is richer or more powerful,\r\nthan the rest. In such a confederacy it is not the individual citizen\r\nwho is to be represented, but the individual State. In such a\r\nconfederacy there would be the same representation for a State, say of\r\nten thousand inhabitants, as for one of fifty thousand. This, it was\r\nmaintained, preserved equality of suffrage in the equality of States;\r\nwhile the representation of the individual citizens of the States would\r\nbe in reality inequality of suffrage, because the autonomy of the State\r\nwould be lost sight of. If in such a case it were asked what had become\r\nof the rights which the majority of forty thousand had inherited from\r\nnature, the answer was that those rights were preserved and represented\r\nin the state government. The difficulty, nevertheless, remained: how to\r\nreconcile in practice this doctrine of the equal rights of States, where\r\nthere might be a minority of persons, with the actual rights of the\r\nwhole people where, according to the underlying democratic doctrine, the\r\ngood of the whole must be decided by the larger number.\r\n\r\nThose who proposed only to amend the old Articles of Confederation, and\r\nopposed a new Constitution, objected that a government formed under such\r\na Constitution would be not a federal but a national government. Luther\r\nMartin said, when he returned to Maryland, that the delegates \"appeared\r\ntotally to have forgot the business for which we were sent.... We had\r\nnot been sent to form a government over the inhabitants of America\r\nconsidered as individuals.... That the system of government we were\r\nintrusted to prepare was a government over these thirteen States, but\r\nthat in our proceedings we adopted principles which would be right and\r\nproper only on the supposition that there were no state governments at\r\nall, but that all the inhabitants of this extensive continent were in\r\ntheir individual capacity, without government, and in a state of\r\nnature.\" He added that \"in the whole system there was but one federal\r\nfeature, the appointment of the senators by the States in their\r\nsovereign capacity, that is, by their legislatures, and the equality of\r\nsuffrage in that branch; but it was said that this feature was only\r\nfederal in appearance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate, the second house as it was called in the convention, was in\r\npart created, it is needless to say, to meet, or rather in obedience to,\r\nreasoning like this. There was almost nobody who would have been willing\r\nto abandon the state governments, as there was next to nobody who wanted\r\na monarchy. \"We were eternally troubled,\" Martin said, \"with arguments\r\nand precedents from the British government.\" He could not get beyond the\r\nfixed notion that those whom he opposed were determined to establish\r\n\"one general government over this extensive continent, of a monarchical\r\nnature.\" If he, and those who agreed with him, sincerely believed this\r\nto be true, it was natural enough that the frequent allusions to British\r\nprecedents, as wise rules for American guidance in constructing a\r\ngovernment, should be looked upon as an unmistakable hankering after\r\nlost flesh-pots. Should the state governments be swept away, it might be\r\nthat, in time of danger from without or of peril from internal\r\ndissensions, the country, under \"a government of a monarchical nature,\"\r\nmight drift back to its old allegiance. If those who feared, or said\r\nthey feared, this were not quite sincere, the temptation was almost\r\nirresistible to use such arguments to arouse popular prejudice against\r\npolitical opponents. It is curious that Madison seemed quite unconscious\r\nof how much the frequent allusions in his articles in \"The Federalist\"\r\nto the British Constitution might strengthen these accusations of the\r\nopposition; while he half believed that the same thing in others showed\r\nin them a leaning toward England, from which he knew that he himself was\r\nquite free.\r\n\r\nThe Luther Martin protestants were too radical to remain in the\r\nconvention to the end, when they saw that such a confederacy as they\r\nwanted was impossible. But there were not many who went the length they\r\ndid in believing that a strong central government was necessarily the\r\ndestruction of the state governments. Still fewer were those who would\r\nhave brought this about if they could. That the rights of the States\r\nmust be preserved was the general opinion and determination, and it was\r\nnot difficult to do this by limiting the powers of the higher\r\ngovernment, or federal as it soon came to be called, and by the\r\norganization of the second house, the Senate, in which all the States\r\nhad an equal representation. The smaller States were satisfied with this\r\nconcession, and the larger were willing to make it, not only for the\r\nsake of the Union, but because of the just estimate in which they held\r\nthe rights belonging to all the States alike. The real difficulty, as\r\nMadison said in the debate on that question, and as he repeated again\r\nand again after that question was settled, was not between the larger\r\nand smaller States, but between the North and the South; between those\r\nStates that held slaves and those that had none.\r\n\r\nSlavery in the Constitution, which has given so much trouble to the\r\nAbolitionists of this century, and indeed to everybody else, gave quite\r\nas much in the last century to those who put it there. Many of the\r\nwisest and best men of the time, Southerners as well as Northerners, and\r\namong them Madison, were opposed to slavery. They could see little good\r\nin it, hardly even any compensation for the existence of a system so\r\nfull of evil. There was hardly a State in the Union at that time that\r\nhad not its emancipation society; and there was hardly a man of any\r\neminence in the country who was not an officer, or at least a member, of\r\nsuch a society. Everywhere north of South Carolina, slavery was looked\r\nupon as a misfortune which it was exceedingly desirable to be free from\r\nat the earliest possible moment; everywhere north of Mason and Dixon's\r\nline, measures had already been taken, or were certain soon to be taken,\r\nto put an end to it; and by the ordinance for the government of all the\r\nterritory north of the Ohio River it was absolutely prohibited by\r\nCongress in the same year in which the Constitutional Congress met.\r\n\r\nBut it was, nevertheless, a thing to the continued existence of which\r\nthe anti-slavery people of that time could consent without any violation\r\nof conscience. Bad as it was, unwise, wasteful, cruel, a mockery of\r\nevery pretense of respect for the rights of man, they did not believe it\r\nto be absolutely wicked. If they had so believed, let us hope they would\r\nhave washed their hands of it. As it was, it was only a question of\r\nexpediency whether, for the sake of the Union, they should protect the\r\nsystem of slavery, and give to the slaveholders, as slaveholders, a\r\ncertain degree of political power. To refuse to admit a slaveholding\r\nState into the Union did not occur, probably, to the most earnest\r\nopponent of the system; for that would have been simply to say that\r\nthere should be no Union. That was what Madison meant in saying so\r\nrepeatedly that the real difficulty in the way was, not the difference\r\nbetween the large and the small States, but the difference between the\r\nslaveholding and the non-slaveholding States. If there could be no\r\nconciliation on that point there could be no Union.\r\n\r\nSome hoped, perhaps, rather than believed, that slavery was likely to\r\ndisappear ere long at the South as it was disappearing at the North. It\r\nis an impeachment of their intelligence, however, to suppose that they\r\nrelied much upon any such hope. The simple truth is that slavery was\r\nthen, as it continued to be for three quarters of a century longer, the\r\nparamount interest of the South. To withstand or disregard it was not\r\nmerely difficult, but was to brave immediate possible dangers and\r\nsufferings, which are never voluntarily encountered except in obedience\r\nto the highest sense of duty; or to meet a necessity, from which there\r\nwas no manly way of escape. The sense of absolute duty was wanting; the\r\nnecessity, it was hoped, might be avoided by concessions. It can only be\r\nsaid for those who made them that they did not see what fruitful seeds\r\nof future trouble they were sowing in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Those who were zealous for state rights, and opposed to a\r\ncentral government, called the system they wished to reëstablish a\r\nFederal System,--a confederacy of States. It was too convenient and\r\nprobably too popular a term to be lost, and the other party adopted it\r\nwhen the new Constitution was formed. _The Federalist_ was the name\r\nchosen for the volume in which were collected the papers, written first\r\nunder the signature of \"A Citizen of New York,\" but afterward changed to\r\n\"Publius,\" in support of the new Constitution, by Hamilton, Madison, and\r\nJay. In one of the earlier papers Mr. Hamilton refers to the Articles of\r\nConfederation, which were to be superseded, as the Federal Constitution;\r\nbut in the later papers Madison is careful to refer to the proposed form\r\nof government as the Federal Constitution, and Federal soon came to be\r\nthe distinguishing name of the party which first came into power under\r\nthe new Constitution. Whatever may be said of Madison's other title, his\r\nright to that of father of the Federal party can hardly be disputed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\"THE COMPROMISES\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question with the North was, how far could it yield; with the South,\r\nhow far could it encroach. It turned mainly on representation,--on \"the\r\nunimportant anomaly,\" as Mr. George Ticknor Curtis calls it in his\r\n\"History of the Constitution,\" \"of a representation of men without\r\npolitical rights or social privileges.\" However much they differed upon\r\nthe subject in the convention, there was nobody then and there who\r\nregarded the question as \"unimportant;\" nor was there a political event\r\nto happen for the coming eighty years that it did not influence and\r\ngenerally govern. There were some who maintained at first that the slave\r\npopulation should not be represented at all. Hamilton proposed in the\r\nfirst days of the convention \"that the rights of suffrage in the\r\nnational legislature ought to be proportioned to the number of free\r\ninhabitants.\" Madison was willing to concede this in one branch of the\r\nlegislature, provided that in the representation in the other house the\r\nslaves were counted as free inhabitants. The constitution of the Senate\r\nsubsequently disposed of that proposition.\r\n\r\nBut why should slaves be represented at all? \"They are not free agents,\"\r\nsaid Patterson, a delegate to the convention from New Jersey; they \"have\r\nno personal liberty, no faculty of acquiring property, but, on the\r\ncontrary, are themselves property, and, like other property, entirely at\r\nthe will of the master. Has a man in Virginia a number of votes in\r\nproportion to the number of his slaves? And if negroes are not\r\nrepresented in the States to which they belong, why should they be\r\nrepresented in the general government?... If a meeting of the people was\r\nactually to take place in a slave State, would the slaves vote? They\r\nwould not. Why, then, should they be represented in a federal\r\ngovernment?\" There could be but one reply, but that was one which it\r\nwould not have been wise to make. It was slave property that was to be\r\nrepresented, and this would not be submitted to among slaveholders as\r\nagainst each other, while yet they were a unit in insisting upon it in a\r\nunion with those who were not slaveholders. Among themselves slavery\r\nneeded no protection; their safety was in equality. But to their great\r\ninterest every non-slaveholder was, in the nature of things, an enemy;\r\nand prudence required that the power either to vote him down or to buy\r\nhim up should never be wanting. It was as much a matter of instinct as\r\nof deliberation, for love of life is the first law. The truth was\r\ncovered up in Madison's specious assertion that \"every peculiar\r\ninterest, whether in any class of citizens or any description of\r\nStates, ought to be secured as far as possible.\" The only \"peculiar\"\r\ninterest, however, belonging either to citizens or States, that was\r\nimbedded in the Constitution, was slavery.\r\n\r\nSo Wilson of Pennsylvania asked: \"Are they [the slaves] admitted as\r\ncitizens--then why are they not admitted on an equality with white\r\ncitizens? Are they admitted as property--then why is not other property\r\nadmitted into the computation?\" He was willing, however, to concede that\r\nit was a difficulty to be \"overcome by the necessity of compromise.\"\r\n\r\nNever, probably, in the history of legislation, was there a more serious\r\nquestion debated. Compromise is ordinarily understood to mean an\r\nadjustment by mutual concessions, where there are rights on both sides.\r\nHere it meant whether the side which had no shadow of right whatever to\r\nthat which it demanded would consent to take a little less than the\r\nwhole. It was the kind of compromise made between the bandit and his\r\nvictim when the former decides that he will not put himself to the\r\ntrouble of shooting the other, and will even leave him his shirt. It was\r\nnot difficult to understand that horses and cattle could be justly\r\ncounted only where property was to be the basis of representation. Yet\r\nthe slaves, who were counted, were, in the eye of the law, either\r\npersonal property or real estate, and were no more represented as\r\ncitizens than if they also had gone upon all fours. Their enumeration,\r\nnevertheless, was carried, and it so increased the representative power\r\nof their masters that inequality of citizenship became the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the government. This, of course, was to form an oligarchy,\r\nnot a democracy. Practically the government was put in the hands of a\r\nclass, and there it remained from the moment of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution to the rebellion of 1860; while that class, including those\r\nof so little consequence as to own only a slave or two, in its best\r\nestate, probably never exceeded ten per centum of the whole people.\r\n\r\nThere was, if one may venture to say so, a singular confusion in the\r\nminds of the venerable fathers of the republic on this subject. They\r\ncould not quite get rid of the notion that the slaves, being human,\r\nought to be included in the enumeration of population, notwithstanding\r\nthat their enumeration as citizens must necessarily disappear in their\r\nrepresentation as chattels. Slaves, as slaves, were the wealth of the\r\nSouth, as ships, for example, were the wealth of the North; but, being\r\nhuman, the mind was not shocked at having the slaves reckoned as\r\npopulation in fixing the basis of representation, though in reality they\r\nonly represented the masters' ownership. But nobody would have been at a\r\nloss to see the absurdity of counting three fifths of the Northern ships\r\nas population. Even a Webster Whig of sixty-five years later could,\r\nperhaps, have understood that that was something more than an\r\n\"unimportant anomaly.\" There was no clearer-headed man in the\r\nconvention than Gouverneur Morris; yet he said that he was \"compelled to\r\ndeclare himself reduced to the dilemma of doing injustice to the\r\nSouthern States or to human nature, and he must do it to the former.\" C.\r\nC. Pinckney of South Carolina declared that he was \"alarmed\" at such an\r\navowal as that. Yet had the question been one of counting three fifths\r\nof the Northern ships in the enumeration of population, Morris would\r\nhave discovered no \"dilemma,\" and Pinckney nothing to be \"alarmed\" at.\r\nSo palpable an outrage on common sense would have been merely laughed at\r\nby both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]\r\n\r\nIn reply to Pinckney, however, Morris grew bolder. \"It was high time,\"\r\nhe said, \"to speak out.\" He came there \"to form a compact for the good\r\nof America. He hoped and believed that all would enter into such\r\ncompact. If they would not, he was ready to join with any States that\r\nwould. But as the compact was to be voluntary, it is in vain for the\r\nEastern States to insist on what the Southern States will never agree\r\nto. It is equally vain for the latter to require what the other States\r\ncan never admit, and he verily believed the people of Pennsylvania will\r\nnever agree to a representation of negroes;\" of negroes, he meant,\r\ncounted as human beings, not for their own representation, but, as ships\r\nmight be counted, for the increased representation of those who held\r\nthem as property. The next day he \"spoke out\" still more plainly. \"If\r\nnegroes,\" he said, \"were to be viewed as inhabitants, ... they ought to\r\nbe added in their entire number, and not in the proportion of three\r\nfifths. If as property, the word 'wealth' was right,\"--as the basis,\r\nthat is, of representation. The distinction that had been set up by\r\nMadison and others between the Northern and Southern States he\r\nconsidered as heretical and groundless. But it was persisted in, and \"he\r\nsaw that the Southern gentlemen will not be satisfied unless they see\r\nthe way open to their gaining a majority in the public councils....\r\nEither this distinction [between the North and the South] is fictitious\r\nor real; if fictitious, let it be dismissed, and let us proceed with due\r\nconfidence. If it be real, instead of attempting to blend incompatible\r\nthings, let us at once take a friendly leave of each other.\"\r\n\r\nBut could they take \"a friendly leave of each other\"? Should a union be\r\nsecured on the terms the South offered? or should it be declined, as\r\nMorris proposed, if it could not be a union of equality? The next day\r\nMadison again set forth the real issue, quietly but unmistakably. \"It\r\nseemed now,\" he said, \"to be pretty well understood that the real\r\ndifference of interests lay, not between the large and small, but\r\nbetween the Northern and Southern States. The institution of slavery and\r\nits consequences formed the line of discrimination.\" There is sometimes\r\ngreat power, as he well knew, in firm reiteration. So long as slavery\r\nlasted, the lesson he then inculcated was never forgotten.\r\nThenceforward, as then, \"the line of discrimination,\" in Southern\r\npolitics, lay with \"slavery and its consequences.\" One side would abate\r\nnothing of its demands; there could be no \"friendly leave\" unless the\r\ndetermination, on the other side, to overcome the desire for union and\r\ntake the consequences was equally firm.\r\n\r\nWhen the question again came up, however, Morris had not lost heart. His\r\ntalk was the talk of a modern abolitionist:--\r\n\r\n     \"He never would concur in upholding domestic slavery. It was a\r\n     nefarious institution. It was the curse of Heaven on the States\r\n     where it prevailed. Compare the free regions of the Middle States,\r\n     where a rich and noble cultivation marks the prosperity and\r\n     happiness of the people, with the misery and poverty which\r\n     overspread the barren wastes of Virginia, Maryland, and the other\r\n     States having slaves. Travel through the whole continent, and you\r\n     behold the prospect continually varying with the appearance and\r\n     disappearance of slavery.... Proceed southwardly, and every step\r\n     you take through the great regions of slavery presents a desert\r\n     increasing with the increasing proportion of these wretched beings.\r\n     Upon what principle is it that the slaves shall be computed in the\r\n     representation? Are they men? Then make them citizens, and let them\r\n     vote. Are they property? Why then is no other property included?\r\n     The houses in this city [Philadelphia] are worth more than all the\r\n     wretched slaves who cover the rice swamps of South Carolina.... And\r\n     what is the proposed compensation to the Northern States for a\r\n     sacrifice of every principle of right, of every impulse of\r\n     humanity? They are to bind themselves to march their militia for\r\n     the defense of the Southern States, for their defense against those\r\n     very slaves of whom they complain. They must supply vessels and\r\n     seamen in case of foreign attack. The legislature will have\r\n     indefinite power to tax them by excises and duties on imports, both\r\n     of which will fall heavier on them than on the Southern\r\n     inhabitants; for the Bohea tea used by a Northern freeman will pay\r\n     more tax than the whole consumption of the miserable slave, which\r\n     consists of nothing more than his physical subsistence and the rags\r\n     that cover his nakedness.... Let it not be said that direct\r\n     taxation is to be proportioned to representation. It is idle to\r\n     suppose that the general government can stretch its hand directly\r\n     into the pockets of the people scattered over so vast a country....\r\n     He would sooner submit himself to a tax for paying for all the\r\n     negroes in the United States than saddle posterity with such a\r\n     Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nSo much of this as was not already fact was prophecy. Yet not many weeks\r\nlater this impassioned orator put his name to the Constitution, though\r\nit had grown meanwhile into larger pro-slavery proportions. There was\r\nundoubtedly some sympathy with him among a few of the members; but the\r\ngeneral feeling was more truly expressed a few days later by Rutledge of\r\nSouth Carolina, in the debate on the continuance of the African slave\r\ntrade. \"Religion and humanity,\" he said, \"had nothing to do with this\r\nquestion. Interest alone is the governing principle with nations. The\r\ntrue question at present is, whether the Southern States shall or shall\r\nnot be parties to the Union. If the Northern States consult their\r\ninterest, they will not oppose the increase of slaves, which will\r\nincrease the commodities of which they will become the carriers.\" The\r\nresponse came from Connecticut, Oliver Ellsworth saying: \"Let every\r\nState import what it pleases. The morality or wisdom of slavery are\r\nconsiderations belonging to the States themselves. What enriches a part\r\nenriches the whole,\"--especially Newport and its adjacent coasts, he\r\nmight have added, with its trade to the African coast.\r\n\r\nBut a Virginian, George Mason, had another tone. He called the traffic\r\n\"infernal.\" \"Slavery,\" he went on, \"discourages arts and manufactures.\r\nThe poor despise labor when performed by slaves. They prevent the\r\nemigration of whites, who really enrich and strengthen a country. They\r\nproduce the most pernicious effect on manners. Every master of slaves is\r\nborn a petty tyrant. They bring the judgment of Heaven on a country. As\r\nnations cannot be rewarded or punished in the next world, they must be\r\nin this. By an inevitable chain of causes and effects, Providence\r\npunishes national sins by national calamities.\"\r\n\r\nThese were warnings worth heeding. But Ellsworth retorted with a sneer:\r\n\"As he had never owned a slave, he could not judge of the effect of\r\nslavery on character.\" He said, however, that, \"if it was to be\r\nconsidered in a moral light, we ought to go farther, and free those\r\nalready in the country.\" But, so far from that, he thought it would be\r\n\"unjust toward South Carolina and Georgia,\" in whose \"sickly rice\r\nswamps\" negroes died so fast, should there be any intermeddling to\r\nprevent the importation of fresh Africans to labor, and, of course, to\r\nperish there. Perhaps it was this shrewd argument of the Connecticut\r\ndelegate that suggested, half a century afterward, to a Mississippi\r\nagricultural society, the economical calculation that it was cheaper to\r\nuse up a gang of negroes every few years, and supply its place by a\r\nfresh gang from Virginia, than rely upon the natural increase that would\r\nfollow their humane treatment as men and women. His colleague, Roger\r\nSherman, came to Ellsworth's aid. It would be, he thought, the duty of\r\nthe general government to prohibit the foreign trade in slaves, and,\r\nshould this be left in its power, it would probably be done. But he\r\nwould not, if the Southern States made it the condition of consenting to\r\nthe Constitution that the trade should be protected, leave it in the\r\npower of the general government to do that which he acknowledged that it\r\nshould and probably would do.\r\n\r\nDelegates from Georgia and the Carolinas declared that to be the\r\ncondition,--among them C. C. Pinckney of South Carolina. \"He should\r\nconsider,\" he said, \"a rejection of the clause as an exclusion of South\r\nCarolina from the Union.\" Nevertheless he said to the people at home,\r\nwhen they came together to consider the Constitution: \"We are so weak\r\nthat by ourselves we could not form a union strong enough for the\r\npurpose of effectually protecting each other. Without union with the\r\nother States, South Carolina must soon fall.\" On the part of that State\r\nit had been a game of brag all along. The first lesson in the South\r\nCarolinian policy was given in the Constitutional Convention. Of the\r\nresult, this was Pinckney's summing up to his constituents:--\r\n\r\n     \"By this settlement we have secured an unlimited importation of\r\n     negroes for twenty years; nor is it declared that the importation\r\n     shall be then stopped; it may be continued. We have a security that\r\n     the general government can never emancipate them, for no such\r\n     authority is granted.... We have obtained a right to recover our\r\n     slaves, in whatever part of America they may take refuge, which is\r\n     a right we had not before. In short, considering all circumstances,\r\n     we have made the best terms, for the security of this species of\r\n     property, it was in our power to make. We would have made better if\r\n     we could, but on the whole I do not think them bad.\"\r\n\r\nA more moderate and a more significant statement could hardly have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nOn the foreign slave trade Madison had little to say, but, like most of\r\nthe Southern delegates north of the Carolinas, he was opposed to it.\r\n\"Twenty years,\" he said, \"will produce all the mischief that can be\r\napprehended from the liberty to import slaves. So long a term will be\r\nmore dishonorable to the American character than to say nothing about\r\nit in the Constitution.\" The words are a little ambiguous, though he is\r\nhis own reporter. But what he meant evidently was, that any protection\r\nof the trade would dishonor the nation; for at another point of the\r\ndebate, on the same day, he said that \"he thought it wrong to admit in\r\nthe Constitution the idea that there could be property in men.\" Such\r\nproperty he was anxious to protect as the great Southern interest, so\r\nlong as it lasted; but he was not willing to strengthen it by permitting\r\nthe continuance of the African slave trade for twenty years longer under\r\nthe sanction of the Constitution. But he held it to be, as he wrote in\r\n\"The Federalist,\" \"a great point gained in favor of humanity that a\r\nperiod of twenty years may terminate forever within these States a\r\ntraffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the barbarism of\r\nmodern policy.\" He added, \"The attempt that had been made to pervert\r\nthis clause into an objection against the Constitution, by representing\r\nit as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice,\" was a\r\nmisconstruction which he did not think deserving of an answer.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, a bargain which he had not approved of, and did not now\r\nprobably care to talk about. It was made at the suggestion of Gouverneur\r\nMorris, who moved that the foreign slave trade, a navigation act, and a\r\nduty on exports be referred for consideration to a committee. \"These\r\nthings,\" he said, \"may form a bargain among the Northern and Southern\r\nStates.\" When the committee reported in favor of the slave trade, C. C.\r\nPinckney proposed that its limitation should be extended from 1800 to\r\n1808. Gorham of Massachusetts seconded the motion, and it was carried by\r\nthe addition of the votes of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and\r\nConnecticut to those of Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nThe committee also reported the substitution of a majority vote for that\r\nof two thirds in legislation relating to commerce. The concession was\r\nmade without much difficulty, a Georgia delegate and three of the four\r\nSouth Carolina delegates favoring it, two of the latter frankly saying\r\nthey did so to gratify New England. It was, C. C. Pinckney said, \"the\r\ntrue interest of the Southern States to have no regulation of commerce;\"\r\nbut he assented to this proposition, and his constituents \"would be\r\nreconciled to this liberality,\" because, among other considerations, of\r\n\"the liberal conduct [of the New England States] towards the views of\r\nSouth Carolina.\" There was no question of the meaning of this sudden\r\navowal of friendly feeling. Jefferson relates in his \"Ana,\" on the\r\nauthority of George Mason, a member of the convention, that Georgia and\r\nSouth Carolina had \"struck up a bargain with the three New England\r\nStates, that if they would admit slaves for twenty years, the two\r\nsouthernmost States would join in changing the clause which required two\r\nthirds of the legislature in any vote.\"\r\n\r\nThe settlement of these questions was an opportune moment for the\r\nintroduction of that relating to fugitive slaves. Butler of South\r\nCarolina immediately proposed a section which should secure their return\r\nto their masters, and it was passed without a word. As Pinckney said in\r\nthe passage already quoted, when he went back to report to his\r\nconstituents, \"it is a right to recover our slaves, in whatever part of\r\nAmerica they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before.\"\r\n\r\nIt is notable how complete and final a settlement of the slavery\r\nquestion \"these compromises,\" as they were called, seemed to be to those\r\nwho made them. They were meant to be, as Mr. Madison called them,\r\n\"adjustments of the different interests of different parts of the\r\ncountry,\" and being once agreed upon they were considered as having the\r\nbinding force and stability of a contract. The evils of slavery were set\r\nforth as an element in the negotiation, but no question of essential\r\nmorality was raised that brought the system within the category of\r\nforbidden wrong. Whatever results might follow would be limited, it was\r\nthought, by the terms of the contract; whereas, in fact, the actual\r\nresults were not foreseen, and could not be guarded against, except by\r\nthe refusal to enter into any contract whatever.\r\n\r\nOn all other questions involving political principles,--the just\r\nrelations of the federal government and the governments of the States;\r\nthe relations between the larger and the smaller States; the regulation\r\nof the functions of the executive, the legislative, and the judicial\r\ndepartments of government,--on all these the framers of the\r\nConstitution brought to bear the profoundest wisdom. When one reflects\r\nupon the magnitude and character of the work, Madison's conclusion seems\r\nhardly extravagant, that \"adding to these considerations the natural\r\ndiversity of human opinions on all new and complicated subjects, it is\r\nimpossible to consider the degree of concord which ultimately prevailed\r\nas less than a miracle.\" There were, nevertheless, the gravest and most\r\nanxious doubts how far the Constitution would stand the test of time;\r\nyet as a system of government for a nation of freemen it remains to this\r\nday practically unchanged. But where its architects thought themselves\r\nwisest they were weakest. That which they thought they had settled\r\nforever was the one thing which they did not settle. Of all the\r\n\"adjustments\" of the Constitution, slavery was precisely that one which\r\nwas not adjusted.\r\n\r\nMadison's responsibility for this result was that of every other\r\ndelegate,--no more and no less. Neither he nor they, whether more or\r\nless opposed to slavery, saw in it a system so subversive of the rights\r\nof man that no just government should tolerate it. That was reserved for\r\na later generation, and even that was slow to learn. To the fathers it\r\nwas, at worst, only an unfortunate and unhappy social condition, which\r\nit would be well to be rid of if this could be done without too much\r\nsacrifice; but otherwise, to be submitted to, like any other\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nWhile it did exist, however, Madison believed it should be protected,\r\nthough not encouraged, as a Southern interest. The question resolved\r\nitself into one of expediency,--of union or disunion. What disunion\r\nwould be, he knew, or thought he knew. Perhaps he was mistaken.\r\nDisunion, had it come then, might have been the way to a true union. \"We\r\nare so weak,\" said C. C. Pinckney, \"that by ourselves we could not form\r\na union strong enough for the purpose of effectually protecting each\r\nother. Without union with the other States, South Carolina must soon\r\nfall.\" But he was careful to say this at home, not in Philadelphia. In\r\nthe convention, Madison wrote a month after it adjourned, \"South\r\nCarolina and Georgia were inflexible on the point of the slaves.\" What\r\nwas to be the union which that inflexibility carried was not foreseen.\r\nIt was the children's teeth that were to be set on edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison's labors for the Constitution did not cease when the convention\r\nadjourned, although he was not at that moment in a hopeful frame of mind\r\nin regard to it. Within a week of the adjournment he wrote to Jefferson:\r\n\"I hazard an opinion that the plan, should it be adopted, will neither\r\neffectually answer its national object, nor prevent the local mischiefs\r\nwhich excite disgusts against the state governments.\"\r\n\r\nBut this feeling seems to have soon passed away. Perhaps, when he\r\ndevoted himself to a careful study of what had been done, he saw, in\r\nlooking at it as a whole, how just and true it was in its fair\r\nproportions. He now diligently sought to prove how certainly the\r\nConstitution would answer its purpose; how wisely all its parts were\r\nadjusted; how successfully the obstacles to a perfect union of the\r\nStates had been, as he thought, overcome; how carefully the rights of\r\nthe separate States had been guarded, while the needed general\r\ngovernment would be secured. Whether there should be an American nation\r\nor not depended, as he had believed for years, upon whether a national\r\nConstitution could be agreed upon. Now that it was framed he believed\r\nthat upon its adoption depended whether there should be, or should not\r\nbe, a nation. In September, as he wrote to Jefferson, he was in doubt;\r\nin February he wrote to Pendleton: \"I have for some time been persuaded\r\nthat the question on which the proposed Constitution must turn is the\r\nsimple one, whether the Union shall or shall not be continued. There is,\r\nin my opinion, no middle ground to be taken.\"\r\n\r\nThose who would have called a second convention to revise the labors of\r\nthe first had no sympathy from him. He not only doubted if the work\r\ncould be done so well again; he doubted if it could be done at all. With\r\nhim, it was this Constitution or none. \"Every man,\" he said in \"The\r\nFederalist,\" referring to a picture he had just drawn of the perils of\r\ndisunion,--\"every man who loves peace, every man who loves his country,\r\nevery man who loves liberty, ought to have it ever before his eyes, that\r\nhe may cherish in his heart a due attachment to the Union of America,\r\nand be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it.\" This\r\n\"means\" was the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOf the eighty papers of \"The Federalist\" he wrote twenty-nine; Hamilton\r\nwriting forty-six, and Jay only five. These famous essays, of wider\r\nrepute than any other American book, are yet more generally accepted\r\nupon faith than upon knowledge. But at that time, when the new\r\nConstitution was in the mind and on the tongue of every thoughtful man,\r\nthey were eagerly read as they followed each other rapidly in the\r\ncolumns of a New York newspaper. They were an armory, wherein all who\r\nentered into the controversy could find such weapons as they could best\r\nhandle. What governments had been, what governments ought to be, and\r\nwhat the political union of these American States would be under their\r\nnew Constitution, were questions on which the writers of these papers\r\nundertook to answer all reasonable inquiries, and to silence all cavils.\r\nMadison would undoubtedly have written more than his two fifths of them,\r\nhad he not been called upon early in March to return to Virginia; for\r\nthe work was of the deepest interest to him, and the popularity of the\r\npapers would have stimulated to exertion one as indolent as he was\r\nindustrious.\r\n\r\nBut the canvass for the election of delegates to the Constitutional\r\nConvention of Virginia called him home. He had been nominated as the\r\nrepresentative of his county, and his friends had urged him to return\r\nbefore the election, for there was reason to fear that the majority was\r\non the wrong side. Henry, Mason, Randolph, Lee, and others among the\r\nmost influential men of Virginia, were opposed to the Constitution.\r\nThere must be somebody in the convention to meet strong men like these,\r\nand Madison was urged to take the stump and canvass for his own\r\nelection. Even this he was willing to do at this crisis, if need be,\r\nthough he said it would be at the sacrifice of every private\r\ninclination, and of the rule which hitherto from the beginning of his\r\npublic career he had strictly adhered to,--never to ask, directly or\r\nindirectly, for votes for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible, even quite probable, that Mr. Madison had little\r\nof that gift which has always passed for eloquence, and is, indeed,\r\neloquence of a certain kind. If we may trust the reports of his\r\ncontemporaries, though he wanted some of the graces of oratory, he was\r\nnot wanting in the power of winning and convincing. His arguments were\r\noften, if not always, prepared with care. If there was no play of fancy,\r\nthere was no forgetfulness of facts. If there was lack of imagination,\r\nthere was none of historical illustration, when the subject admitted it.\r\nIf manner was forgotten, method was not. His aim was to prove and to\r\nhold fast; to make the wrong clear, and to put the right in its place;\r\nto appeal to reason, not to passion, nor to prejudice; to try his cause\r\nby the light of clear logic, hard facts, and sound learning; to convince\r\nhis hearers of the truth, as he believed in it, not to take their\r\njudgment captive by surprise with harmonious modulation and grace of\r\nmovement. Not his neighbors only, but the most zealous of the\r\nFederalists of the State, sent him to the convention. It was there that\r\nsuch eloquence as he possessed was peculiarly needed. The ground was to\r\nbe fought over inch by inch, and with antagonists whom it would be\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to beat. There was to be contest over\r\nevery word of the Constitution from its first to its last. \"Give me\r\nleave,\" cried Patrick Henry in his opening speech, \"to demand what right\r\nhad they to say 'We the people' instead of 'We the States'?\" He began at\r\nthe beginning. It was the gage of the coming battle; the defenders were\r\nchallenged to show that any better union than that already in existence\r\nwas needed, and that in this new Constitution a better union was\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nAs month after month passed away while the Constitution was before the\r\npeople for adoption, the anxiety of the Federalists grew, lest the\r\nrequisite nine States should not give their assent. But when eight were\r\nsecured there was room to hope even for unanimity, if Virginia should\r\ncome in as the ninth. Should she say Yes, the Union might be perfect;\r\nfor the remaining States would be almost sure to follow her lead. But\r\nshould she say No, the final result would be doubtful, even if the\r\nrequisite nine should be secured by the acquiescence of one of the\r\nsmaller States. This answer could not, of course, depend altogether upon\r\none man, but it did depend more upon Madison than upon anybody else.\r\n\r\nThe convention was in session nearly a month. At the end of a fortnight\r\nhe was not hopeful. \"The business,\" he wrote to Washington, \"is in the\r\nmost ticklish state that can be imagined. The majority will certainly be\r\nvery small, on whatever side it may finally lie; and I dare not\r\nencourage much expectation that it will be on the favorable side.\" But\r\nhis fears stimulated rather than discouraged him. He was always on his\r\nfeet; always ready to meet argument with argument; always prompt to\r\nappeal from passion to reason; quick to brush aside mere declamation,\r\nand to bring the minds of his hearers back to a calm consideration of\r\nhow much was at stake, and of the weight of the responsibility resting\r\non that convention. Others were no less earnest and diligent than he;\r\nbut he was easily chief, and the burden and heat of the day fell mainly\r\nupon him. Probably when the convention assembled the majority were\r\nopposed to the Constitution; but its adoption was carried at last by a\r\nvote of eighty-nine to seventy-nine. Thenceforth opposition in the\r\nremaining States was hopeless.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire--though the fact was not known in Virginia--preceded that\r\nState by a few days in accepting the Constitution, so that the requisite\r\nnine were secured before the convention at Richmond came to a decision.\r\nBut it was her decision, nevertheless, that really settled, so far as\r\ncan be seen now, the question of a permanent Union. Had the vote of\r\nVirginia been the other way it is not likely that Hamilton would have\r\ncarried New York, or that North Carolina and Rhode Island would have\r\nfinally decided not to be left in solitude outside. What the history of\r\nthe nine united States only, with four disunited States among them,\r\nmight have been, it is impossible to know, and quite useless to\r\nconjecture. The conditions which some of the States attached to the act\r\nof adoption, the addition of a Bill of Rights, proposed amendments to\r\nthe Constitution, and the suggestion of submitting it to a second\r\nconvention, were matters of comparatively little moment, when the\r\nmajority of ten delegates was secured at Richmond. These were questions\r\nthat could be postponed. \"The delay of a few years,\" Madison wrote to\r\nJefferson, \"will assuage the jealousies which have been artificially\r\ncreated by designing men, and will at the same time point out the faults\r\nwhich call for amendment.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the adjournment of the Richmond Convention he returned\r\nto New York, where the confederate Congress was still in session. That\r\nbody had little to do now but decide upon the time and place of the\r\ninauguration of the new government. Madison had entered upon his\r\nthirty-eighth year, and we get an interesting glimpse of him as he\r\nappeared at this time of his life to an intelligent foreigner. \"Mr.\r\nWarville Brissot has just arrived here,\" he wrote to Jefferson in\r\nAugust, 1788. This was Brissot de Warville, a Frenchman of the new\r\nphilosophy,--whose head, nevertheless, his compatriots cut off a few\r\nyears later,--then traveling in America to observe the condition and\r\nprogress of the new republic. His tour extended to nearly all the\r\nStates; he met with most of the distinguished men of the country; and he\r\nmade a careful and intelligent use of his many opportunities for\r\nobservation. On his return to France he wrote an entertaining\r\nvolume,--\"New Travels in the United States of America,\"--still to be\r\nfound in some old libraries. What he says of Madison is worth repeating,\r\nnot only for the impression he made upon an observant stranger, but as\r\nthe evidence of the contemporary estimate of his character and\r\nreputation, which De Warville must have gathered from others.\r\n\r\n     \"The name of Madison,\" he writes, \"celebrated in America, is well\r\n     known in Europe by the merited eulogium made of him by his\r\n     countryman and friend, Mr. Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     \"Though still young, he has rendered the greatest services to\r\n     Virginia, to the American Confederation, and to liberty and\r\n     humanity in general. He contributed much, with Mr. White, in\r\n     reforming the civil and criminal codes of his country. He\r\n     distinguished himself particularly in the convention for the\r\n     acceptation of the new federal system. Virginia balanced a long\r\n     time in adhering to it. Mr. Madison determined to it the members of\r\n     the convention by his eloquence and logic. This republican appears\r\n     to be about thirty-eight years of age. He had, when I saw him, an\r\n     air of fatigue; perhaps it was the effect of the immense labors to\r\n     which he has devoted himself for some time past. His look announces\r\n     a censor, his conversation discovers the man of learning, and his\r\n     reserve was that of a man conscious of his talents and of his\r\n     duties.\r\n\r\n     \"During the dinner, to which he invited me, they spoke of the\r\n     refusal of North Carolina to accede to the new Constitution. The\r\n     majority against it was one hundred. Mr. Madison believed that this\r\n     refusal would have no weight on the minds of the Americans, and\r\n     that it would not impede the operations of Congress. I told him\r\n     that though this refusal might be regarded as a trifle in America,\r\n     it would have great weight in Europe; that they would never inquire\r\n     there into the motives which dictated it, nor consider the small\r\n     consequence of this State in the confederation; that it would be\r\n     regarded as a germ of division, calculated to retard the operations\r\n     of Congress; and that certainly this idea would prevent the\r\n     resurrection of American credit.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Madison attributed this refusal to the attachment of a great\r\n     part of the inhabitants of that State to their paper money and\r\n     their tender act. He was much inclined to believe that this\r\n     disposition would not remain a long time.\"\r\n\r\nIn October the Virginia Assembly met. Two thirds of its members were\r\nopposed to the new Constitution, and at their head was Patrick Henry,\r\nhis zeal against it not in the least abated because he had been defeated\r\nin the late convention. The acceptance of the Constitution by that\r\nrepresentative body could not be recalled. But the Assembly could, at\r\nleast, protest against it, and was led by Henry to call upon Congress to\r\nconvene a second national convention to do over again the work of the\r\nfirst. The legislature was to elect senators for the first Senate under\r\nthe new government; and it was also to divide the State into districts\r\nfor its representation in the lower house of Congress. In ordinary\r\nfairness, as the State had, in a popular convention, so recently\r\naccepted the Constitution, the party then in the majority was entitled\r\nto at least one of the representatives in the Senate. But Henry\r\nnominated both, and could command votes enough to elect them. In modern\r\nparty usage this would seem quite unobjectionable; indeed, a modern\r\npolitician who should not use such an advantage for his party would be\r\nconsidered as unfit for practical politics. But a hundred years ago it\r\nwas thought sharp practice, and a fair proportion of Henry's partisans\r\nrefused to be bound by it. One of Henry's nominees was elected by a\r\nmajority of twenty over Madison; but in the case of the other that\r\nmajority was reduced more than half, and a change of five more votes\r\nwould have elected Madison.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, neither expected nor wished to be sent to the Senate,\r\nwhile he did hope to be elected to the House of Representatives. The\r\nSenate was intended to be the more dignified body, requiring in its\r\nmembers a certain style of living for which wealth was indispensable.\r\nMadison had not the means to give that kind of social support to\r\nofficial position; but he could afford to belong to that body where a\r\nmember was not the less respectable because his whole domestic\r\nestablishment might be a bachelor's room in a boarding-house.\r\n\r\nVirginia was, as he wrote to Washington, \"the only instance among the\r\nratifying States in which the politics of the legislature are at\r\nvariance with the sense of the people, expressed by their\r\nrepresentatives in convention.\" This had enabled Henry and a majority\r\nof his friends to elect senators who, representing \"the politics of the\r\nlegislature,\" did not represent \"the sense of the people\" in regard to\r\nthe national Constitution. But in the election of members of the House\r\nof Representatives, the sense of the people was to be again appealed to,\r\nand a new way must be devised for asserting the supremacy of legislative\r\npower. The cleverness of Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, many years\r\nlater, under similar circumstances, introduced a new word into the\r\nlanguage of the country, and, it was supposed at the time, a new device\r\nin American politics. But what has since been known as \"Gerrymandering\"\r\nwas really the invention of Patrick Henry. This method of arranging\r\ncounties into congressional districts in accordance with their political\r\naffinities, without regard to their geographical lines, Henry attempted\r\nto do with Mr. Madison's own county. By joining it to distant counties\r\nit was expected that an anti-Federal majority would be secured large\r\nenough to insure his defeat. The attempt to elect him to the Senate was,\r\nMadison wrote to Jefferson, \"defeated by Mr. Henry, who is omnipotent in\r\nthe present legislature.\" He adds that Henry \"has taken equal pains, in\r\nforming the counties into districts for the election of representatives,\r\nto associate with Orange such as are most devoted to his politics, and\r\nmost likely to be swayed by the prejudices excited against me.\" The\r\nscheme, however, was unsuccessful, perhaps partly because of the\r\nindignation which so dishonorable a measure to defeat a political\r\nopponent excited throughout the State. Madison entered upon an active\r\ncanvass of his district against James Monroe, who had been nominated as\r\na moderate anti-Federalist, and defeated him. It was winter time, and in\r\nthe exposure of some of his long rides his ears were frozen. In later\r\nlife he sometimes laughingly pointed to the scars of these wounds\r\nreceived, he said, in the service of his country.\r\n\r\nThus Henry's \"Gerrymander,\" like many another useful and curious device,\r\nbrought neither profit nor credit to the original inventor. Had Henry\r\nacted in the broader spirit of the modern politician, who sees that he\r\nserves himself best who serves his party best, he would have disposed of\r\nevery Federal county in the State as he disposed of Orange. As it was,\r\nhe only aroused a good deal of indignation and defeated himself by\r\nopenly aiming to gratify his personal resentments. Had he scattered his\r\nshot for the general good of the party, he would, perhaps, have brought\r\ndown his particular bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe confederate Congress, at its final session in 1788, had fixed the\r\ntime for the election of President and Vice-President under the\r\nConstitution, and the time and place for the meeting of the first\r\nCongress of the new government. The day appointed was the first\r\nWednesday of the following March, and, as that date fell on the fourth\r\nof the month, a precedent was established which has ever since been\r\nobserved in the installation of a new President. The place was not so\r\neasily determined. The choice lay between New York and Philadelphia, and\r\nthe struggle was prolonged, not because the question of the temporary\r\nseat of government was of much moment, but because of the influence the\r\ndecision might have upon the future settlement of the permanent place\r\nfor the capital.\r\n\r\nNo quorum of the new Congress was present at New York on March 4, 1789,\r\nand neither house was organized until early in April. On the 23rd\r\nWashington arrived; and on the 30th he took the oath of office as first\r\nPresident of the United States, standing on the balcony of Federal\r\nHall, at the corner of Wall and Broad streets, a site now occupied by\r\nanother building used as the subtreasury. A week before, when the\r\nceremonies proper for such an occasion were a subject of discussion in\r\nCongress, the question of fitting titles for the President and\r\nVice-President came up for consideration. It was decided that when the\r\nPresident arrived the Vice-President should meet him at the door of the\r\nsenate chamber, lead him to the chair, and then, in a formal address,\r\ninform him that the two houses were ready to witness the administration\r\nof the oath of office. \"Upon this,\" says John Adams in a letter written\r\nthree years afterward, \"I arose in my place and asked the advice of the\r\nSenate, in what form I should address him, whether I should say 'Mr.\r\nWashington,' 'Mr. President,' 'Sir,' 'May it please your Excellency,' or\r\nwhat else? I observed that it had been common while he commanded the\r\narmy to call him 'His Excellency,' but I was free to own it would appear\r\nto me better to give him no title but 'Sir,' or 'Mr. President,' than to\r\nput him on a level with a governor of Bermuda, or one of his own\r\nambassadors, or a governor of any one of our States.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the question went to a conference committee of both houses,\r\nwho reported that no other title would be proper for either President or\r\nVice-President, at any time, than those which were given by the\r\nConstitution. To this report the Senate disagreed and appointed a new\r\ncommittee. This proposed that the President should be called \"His\r\nHighness the President of the United States and Protector of their\r\nLiberties.\" When wise men are absurd they presume on their prerogative.\r\nThe Senate accepted the report, but the House had the good sense to\r\nreject it, consenting, however, to leave the question in abeyance. On\r\nthese proceedings Mr. Madison thus commented in a letter to Jefferson:--\r\n\r\n     \"My last inclosed copies of the President's inaugural speech, and\r\n     the answer of the House of Representatives. I now add the answer of\r\n     the Senate. It will not have escaped you that the former was\r\n     addressed with a truly republican simplicity to George Washington,\r\n     President of the United States. The latter follows the example,\r\n     with the omission of the personal name, but without any other than\r\n     the constitutional title. The proceeding on this point was, in the\r\n     House of Representatives, spontaneous. The imitation by the Senate\r\n     was extorted. The question became a serious one between the two\r\n     houses. J. Adams espoused the cause of titles with great\r\n     earnestness. His friend, R. H. Lee, although elected as a\r\n     republican enemy to an aristocratic Constitution, was a most\r\n     zealous second. The projected title was, His Highness the President\r\n     of the United States and the Protector of their Liberties. Had the\r\n     project succeeded, it would have subjected the President to a\r\n     severe dilemma, and given a deep wound to our infant government.\"\r\n\r\nWashington has sometimes been accused of wishing for the title of \"His\r\nHighness,\" and of having suggested it. Had this been true, Madison\r\nwould have been certain to know it, and he was quite incapable of\r\nasserting in that case that such a title would have been to the\r\nPresident \"a severe dilemma.\" About Mr. Adams he was perhaps mistaken,\r\nas he might easily have been, since he was not a member of the Senate,\r\nand probably heard only a confused report of how the question was\r\nbrought before that body. As Mr. Adams's letter, quoted just now, shows,\r\nhe regarded the charge as a calumny and resented it. He gave them,\r\naccording to his own statement, no other opinion than that he preferred\r\n\"Sir,\" or \"Mr. President,\" as a more proper address than \"Excellency,\" a\r\ntitle then, as now, pertaining to governors of States. He probably took\r\nno further part in the debate, but it is not impossible that he may in\r\nprivate have avowed a preference for some other and higher title than\r\neither \"Mr. President\" or \"Your Excellency.\" \"For,\" he said in the\r\nexplanatory letter to his friend, \"I freely own that I think decent and\r\nmoderate titles, as distinctions of offices, are not only harmless, but\r\nuseful in society; and that in this country, where I know them to be\r\nprized by the people as well as their magistrates as highly as by any\r\npeople or any magistrates in the world, I should think some distinction\r\nbetween the magistrates of the national government and those of the\r\nstate governments proper.\" A distinction might be proper enough if there\r\nwere to be any titles whatever; but certainly they were the wiser who\r\npreferred good homespun to threadbare old clothes. Had rags of that sort\r\nbeen made a legal uniform, it is almost appalling to reflect upon the\r\nabsurdities to which the national fondness for titles would have carried\r\nus.\r\n\r\nFrom March 4 to April 1, though the House of Representatives met daily,\r\nthere were not members enough present to make a quorum. The first real\r\nbusiness brought before the House, except that relating to its\r\norganization, was introduced by Madison, two days after the\r\ninauguration. It was a proposition to raise a revenue by duties on\r\nimports, and by a tonnage duty on all vessels, American and foreign,\r\nbringing goods, wares, or merchandise into the United States. The\r\nessential weakness of the late Confederacy was, first of all, to be\r\nremedied by uniform rules for the regulation of trade. Revenue must be\r\nprovided for the support of government, and that in a way which should\r\nnot be oppressive to the people. Commerce, Mr. Madison said, \"ought to\r\nbe as free as the policy of nations will admit,\" but government must be\r\nsupported, and taxes the least burdensome and most easily collected are\r\nthose derived from duties on imports. He agreed, however, as he said on\r\nthe second day of the debate, with those who would so adjust the duties\r\non foreign goods as to protect the \"infant manufactories\" of the\r\ncountry. With little interruption this subject was debated for the first\r\nsix weeks of the opening session of the First Congress. No other could\r\nhave been hit upon to test so thoroughly the strength of the new bond\r\nof union. It was to brush aside all those trade regulations in the\r\nseveral States which each had hitherto thought essential to its\r\nprosperity. Every interest in the country was to be considered, and\r\ntheir different, sometimes opposing, claims to be reconciled.\r\n\r\nNew England was sure that, should the tax on molasses be too high, the\r\ndistilleries would be shut up, and a great New England industry\r\ndestroyed. Nor would the injury stop there. The fisheries, as well as\r\nthe distilleries, would be ruined. For three fifths of the fish put up\r\nfor the West Indies could find no market anywhere else; and a market\r\nexisted there only because molasses was taken in exchange. A prohibitory\r\nduty on that article, or a duty that should seriously interfere with its\r\nimportation, would wellnigh destroy the fisheries. What then would\r\nbecome of the nursery of American seamen? With no seamen there would be\r\nno shipbuilding. What sadder picture than this of a New England without\r\nrum, without codfish, without seamen, and without ships! One can easily\r\nconceive that even in that restrained and dignified First Congress there\r\nwas no want of serious and alarmed expostulation, and even some\r\nthreatening talk from such men as the tranquil Goodhue, the thoughtful\r\nand scholarly Ames, and the impulsive Gerry.\r\n\r\nThen the South, for her part, was alarmed lest, among other things, too\r\nhigh a tonnage duty should leave her tobacco, her rice and indigo,\r\nrotting in the fields and warehouses for want of ships to take them to\r\nmarket. She had no ships of her own and could have none, and she invited\r\nthe ships of the rest of the world to come for her products and bring in\r\nreturn all she needed for her own consumption. The picture of the\r\npossible ruin of New England was as nothing to that of the Southern\r\nplanter scanning the horizon with weary eyes in vain for the sight of a\r\nsail, while behind him was a dangerous crowd of hungry blacks with\r\nnothing to do. That desolation seemed complete to the southernmost\r\nStates when it was also proposed to levy a tax of ten dollars upon every\r\nslave imported. In short, the whole subject bristled with difficulties.\r\nThe problem was nothing more nor less than how to tax everything, and at\r\nthe same time convince everybody that the scheme was for the general\r\ngood, while nobody's special interests were sacrificed. The \"infant\r\nindustries,\" to which Mr. Madison alluded, really received no special\r\nconsideration in the final adjustment, and they were too feeble then\r\neven to cry for nursing. They have grown stronger since, though they are\r\n\"infants\" still; and they should never cease to be grateful to him who,\r\nhowever unwittingly, gave them a name to live by for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable part of the debate was that upon the proposition\r\nof Mr. Parker of Virginia to impose a duty upon the importation of\r\nslaves. Could the progress of events have been foreseen, that proposal\r\nmight have been regarded as meant to protect an \"infant industry\" of the\r\nnorthernmost slave States. But the wildest imagination then could not\r\nconceive of the domestic slave trade of a few years later, when a chief\r\nsource of the prosperity of Virginia would be her perennial crop of\r\nyoung men and women to be shipped for New Orleans and a market. But Mr.\r\nParker had no ulterior motive when he avowed his regret that the\r\nConstitution had failed to prohibit the importation of slaves from\r\nAfrica, and hoped that the duty he proposed would prevent, in some\r\ndegree, a traffic which he pronounced \"irrational and inhuman.\" It would\r\nhave been difficult to have found a Virginian of that day who would not\r\nhave taken down his shotgun on hearing that there were miscreants\r\nprowling about his kitchen doors in the hope of buying up the strongest\r\nyoung people of his household for export to the Southwest.\r\n\r\nJudging from the imperfect report of the debate upon the subject, it\r\nwould seem that the bargain relative to the slave trade, made in the\r\nConstitutional Convention of two years before between New England and\r\nthe two southernmost States, might still hold good. Or there may have\r\nbeen a new bargain; or, perhaps, both sides trusted to a tacit\r\nrecognition of the eternal fitness of things, and made common cause\r\nwhere legislation threatened at the same time the distillery and the\r\nslave-ship.[11] At any rate, the extreme Southerners expressed surprise\r\nat the audacity which would disturb a compromise of the Constitution;\r\nthe extreme Northerners deprecated it as quite uncalled for in any\r\nconsideration of the subject of revenue. The principle of Mr. Parker's\r\nmotion, Mr. Sherman of Connecticut thought, was to correct a moral evil;\r\nthe principle of the bill before the House was to raise a revenue. At\r\nsome other time he would be willing to consider the question of taxing\r\nthe importation of negroes on the ground of humanity and policy; but it\r\nwas a sufficient reason with him for not admitting it as an object of\r\nrevenue that the burden would fall upon two States only. Fisher Ames of\r\nMassachusetts could only take counsel of his conscience. From his soul,\r\nhe said, he detested slavery; and--forgetting, apparently, that this\r\ntax was provided for by the Constitution--he doubted whether imposing it\r\n\"would not have the appearance of authorizing the practice\" of trading\r\nin slaves. This was his reason for wishing to postpone the subject. But\r\nMr. Livermore of New Hampshire was more ingenious still. If the imported\r\nnegroes were goods, wares, or merchandise, they would come within the\r\ntitle of the bill, and be taxed under the general rule of five per\r\ncentum, which would be about the same rate as ten dollars a head; but if\r\nthey were not goods, wares, or merchandise, then such importation could\r\nnot properly be included in the consideration of the question of a\r\nrevenue from duties on such articles of trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison came to the help of his colleague, and brushed aside the\r\nsophistries of the New England allies of the slave traders. If there\r\nwere anything wanting in the title of the bill to cover this particular\r\nduty, it was easy to add it. If the question was not one of taxation\r\nbecause it was one of humanity, it would be quite as difficult to deal\r\nwith it under any other bill for levying a duty as under this. If the\r\ntax seemed unjust because it bore heavily upon a single class, that\r\nwould be a good reason for remitting many taxes which there was no\r\nhesitation in imposing. If ten dollars seemed a heavy duty, a little\r\ncalculation would show that it was only about the proposed _ad valorem_\r\nduty of five per centum on most other importations. \"It is to be\r\nhoped,\" he added, \"that by expressing a national disapprobation of this\r\ntrade we may destroy it, and save ourselves from reproaches, and our\r\nposterity the imbecility ever attendant on a country filled with\r\nslaves.\" \"If there is any one point,\" he continued, \"in which it is\r\nclearly the policy of this nation, so far as we constitutionally can, to\r\nvary the practice obtaining under some of the state governments, it is\r\nthis.... It is as much the interest of Georgia and South Carolina as of\r\nany in the Union. Every addition they receive to their number of slaves\r\ntends to weaken and render them less capable of self-defense.... It is a\r\nnecessary duty of the general government to protect every part of the\r\nempire against danger, as well internal as external. Everything,\r\ntherefore, which tends to increase this danger, though it may be a local\r\naffair, yet, if it involves national expense or safety, becomes of\r\nconcern to every part of the Union, and is a proper subject for the\r\nconsideration of those charged with the general administration of the\r\ngovernment.\" No Northern man, except Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts,\r\nsupported this measure; and none from the Southern States, except three\r\nof the Virginia members, with Madison leading. As the foreign slave\r\ntrade was protected in the Constitution for twenty years by a bargain\r\nbetween the two southernmost States and New England, so now the same\r\ninfluence staved off the imposition of the tax which was a part of the\r\nconsideration to be given for that constitutional protection of the\r\ntrade. It is not a creditable fact; but it is, nevertheless, a fact and\r\na representative one in the history of the United States. And it is to\r\nMadison's great honor that he had neither part nor lot in it.\r\n\r\nAfter six weeks of earnest debate, an amicable and satisfactory\r\nagreement was made to impose a moderate duty upon pretty much everything\r\nimported, except slaves from Africa. It was literally a tariff for\r\nrevenue; but it was a settlement that settled nothing definitely, except\r\nthat the provision of the Constitution for a tax of ten dollars on\r\nimported slaves should be a dead letter. Thenceforth the policy of free\r\ntrade was established, so far as African slaves were concerned, till the\r\ntraffic was supposed to cease by constitutional limitation and Act of\r\nCongress in 1808.[12]\r\n\r\nThe determination to protect the commercial interests of the country,\r\nbeyond the point of mere revenue, was more manifest in fixing the rate\r\nof duty upon tonnage than in duties upon importations. It was generally\r\nagreed, after much debate, that American commerce had better be in\r\nAmerican hands, and a difference of twenty cents a ton was made between\r\nthe tax upon domestic and that upon foreign ships, as a measure of\r\nprotection to American shipping. Mr. Madison proposed to make it still\r\nlarger, but the House would only agree to increase it to forty cents on\r\nships belonging to powers with which the United States had no treaties.\r\nThe Senate, however, refused to admit this distinction, and insisted\r\nthat all foreign ships should be subject to the same tonnage duty\r\nwithout regard to existing treaties. The House assented, lest the bill\r\nshould be lost altogether. This proposed differential duty on foreign\r\nvessels was as clearly aimed at Great Britain as if that power had been\r\nnamed in the bill. Nor, indeed, was there any attempt at concealment;\r\nfor it was openly avowed that America had no formidable rival except the\r\nEnglish, who already largely controlled the commerce of the United\r\nStates. In the debates and in the final decision of the question is\r\nshown clearly enough the difference of opinion and of feeling, which\r\nsoon made the dividing line between the two great parties of the first\r\nquarter of a century under the Constitution. Nobody then foresaw how\r\nbitter that difference of party was to be, nor what disastrous\r\nconsequences would follow it.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison was among the most zealous of those who insisted upon a\r\ndiscrimination against Great Britain. He thought it should be made for\r\nthe dignity no less than for the interest of the United States. He had\r\nno fear, he said, \"of entering into a commercial warfare with that\r\nnation.\" England, he believed, could do this country no harm by any\r\npeaceful reprisals she could devise. She supplied the United States with\r\nno article either of necessity or of luxury that the people of the\r\nUnited States could not manufacture for themselves. He called those\r\n\"Anglicists\" who did not agree with him, and who believed that it was in\r\nthe power of Great Britain to hinder or to help immensely the prosperity\r\nof the United States. It was not of so much moment what America bought\r\nof England as it was that England should consent to free trade with her\r\ncolonies; and on every account it was wiser to conciliate than to defy\r\nGreat Britain; wiser to induce her to enter into a friendly commercial\r\nalliance than to provoke her to retaliate upon the feeble commerce of\r\nthis country, upon which she had so strong a grip. Madison had shown\r\nhimself, before this time, half credulous of the charges of a leaning\r\ntoward England, and toward monarchy, made by those who wanted a congress\r\nof petty states against those who wanted a strong national government.\r\nIf, however, there were Anglicism on one side, so there was quite as\r\nmuch Gallicism, if not a good deal more, on the other. In writing to\r\nJefferson of the probability that the Senate would make no\r\ndiscrimination in the tonnage duties, he said that in that case \"Great\r\nBritain will be quieted in the enjoyment of our trade as she may please\r\nto regulate it, and France discouraged from her efforts at a competition\r\nwhich it is not less our interest than hers to promote.\" Whatever may be\r\nthought of this first concession of the new government to England, it is\r\nquite as much the coming party leader as the statesman who speaks here.\r\nIt may not be doubted that he sincerely thought it to be, as he said,\r\n\"impolitic, in every view that can be taken of the subject, to put Great\r\nBritain at once on the footing of the most favored nation.\" But the\r\nrelation of American interests to English interests was evidently\r\nalready associated in his mind with the relations of France and England,\r\nso soon to be the absorbing question in American politics.\r\n\r\nThe impost act was followed by others hardly less important in putting\r\nthe new Constitution into operation under its first Congress. The\r\ndirection of business seems, by common consent, to have been intrusted\r\nto Mr. Madison among the many able men of that body; doubtless because\r\nof his thorough familiarity with the Constitution, and of his\r\nmethodical ways. He was sure to bring things forward in their due order,\r\nto provide judiciously for the more immediate needs. The impost bill\r\nsecured the means to work with; the next necessity was to organize the\r\nmachinery to do the work. Resolutions to create the executive\r\ndepartments of Foreign Affairs, of the Treasury, and of War were offered\r\nby Mr. Madison. These were required in general terms by the\r\nConstitution, with a single officer at the head of each, to be appointed\r\nby the President \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" The\r\nmanner of the appointment of subordinate officers was provided for by\r\nthe Constitution, but the manner of their removal from office was not.\r\nWas the tenure of office to be good behavior? Were the incumbents\r\nremovable, with or without cause? If the power of removal existed, did\r\nit vest in the power that appointed, that is, in the President and\r\nSenate conjointly, or in the President alone?\r\n\r\nAs the Constitution was silent, the question had to be settled on its\r\nown merits. With all the arguments that could be urged, either on one\r\nside or the other, we are familiar enough in our time, coming up as the\r\nquestion so often does in changes in state constitutions and municipal\r\ncharters, and in the discussion of the necessity for civil service\r\nreform. There is this essential difference, however, between now and\r\nthen: we know the mischiefs that come from the power of official\r\nremoval, which were then only dimly apprehended. The power of removal\r\nfrom office belonged, Mr. Madison believed, rightfully to the chief\r\nmagistrate, and, if by some unhappy chance the wrong man should find his\r\nway to that position and abuse the power intrusted to him, \"the wanton\r\nremoval of meritorious officers would,\" he said, \"subject the President\r\nto impeachment and removal from his own high trust.\"\r\n\r\nLofty political principles like these may still be found in the\r\nplatforms of modern political parties,--\r\n\r\n   \"The souls of them fumed-forth, the hearts of them torn-out.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Madison believed, at least, that he believed in them. There is\r\nin politics as in religion an accepted doctrine of justification by\r\nfaith; and this, perhaps, sustained him when, twelve years later, as\r\nJefferson's secretary of state, he learned from his chief that, as\r\n\"Federalists seldom died and never resigned,\" party necessities must\r\nfind a way of supplementing the law of nature. Jefferson was a little\r\ntimid in applying the remedy, but Madison lived long enough to see\r\nJackson boldly remove, in the course of his administration, about two\r\nthousand office-holders, whose places he wanted as rewards for his own\r\npolitical followers. From that time to this, there has not been a\r\nPresident who might not, if Madison's doctrine was sound, have been\r\nimpeached for a \"wanton\" abuse of power.\r\n\r\nThough the Constitution had been adopted by the States, it was not\r\nwithout objections by some of them. To meet these objections Mr. Madison\r\nproposed twelve amendments declaratory of certain fundamental popular\r\nrights, which, it was thought by many persons, were not sufficiently\r\nguarded by the original articles. This, also, was left to him to do, no\r\ndoubt because of his thorough knowledge of the Constitution and of the\r\npoints wherein it was still imperfect, as well as those wherein it had\r\nbetter not be meddled with. The amendments, as finally agreed to after\r\nlong debate, were essentially those which he proposed, and in due time\r\nten of them were ratified by the States. The two that were not accepted\r\nreferred only to the number of representatives in the House, and to the\r\npay of members of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the selection of a place for the permanent seat of\r\ngovernment would be made by this Congress. There was much talk of the\r\ncentres of wealth, of territory, and of population then, and of where\r\nsuch centres might be in the future. But the question was really a\r\nsectional one. The Northern members were accused of having made a\r\nbargain out of doors with the members of the Middle States. The bargain,\r\nhowever, was only this: that, inasmuch as it was hopeless that the\r\nactual centre should be chosen as the site for a capital city, a place\r\nas near as possible to it should be insisted upon. The South, on the\r\nother hand, determined that the seat of government should be within the\r\nboundaries of the Southern States. That was a foregone conclusion with\r\nthem, that needed no bargain. The nearest navigable river to the centre\r\nof population was the Delaware; but the jealousy of New York stood in\r\nthe way of any selection that favored Philadelphia. The Susquehanna was\r\nproposed. It empties into Chesapeake Bay. North of it was, as Mr.\r\nSherman showed, a population of 1,400,000; and south of it, 1,200,000.\r\nThe South wanted the capital on the Potomac, not because it was the\r\ncentre of population then, but because it might be at some future time,\r\nfrom the growth of the West. On the other hand, it was insisted that the\r\npopulation south of the Potomac was then only 960,000, while north of it\r\nthere were 1,680,000 people, and that it was no more accessible from the\r\nWest than the Susquehanna was. To many members, moreover, this talk of\r\nthe great future of the West seemed hardly worthy of consideration. It\r\nwas \"an unmeasurable wilderness,\" and \"when it would be settled was past\r\ncalculation,\" Fisher Ames said. \"It was,\" he added, \"perfectly romantic\r\nto make this decision depend upon that circumstance. Probably it will be\r\nnear a century before these people will be considerable.\" He was nearer\r\nright when he said in the same speech \"that trade and manufactures will\r\naccumulate people in the Eastern States in proportion of five to three,\r\ncompared with the Southern. The disproportion will, doubtless, continue\r\nto be much greater than I have calculated. It is actually greater at\r\npresent, for the climate and negro slavery are acknowledged to be\r\nunfavorable to population, so that husbandry as well as commerce and\r\nmanufactures will give more people in the Eastern than in the Southern\r\nStates.\" It was, however, finally resolved by the House \"that the\r\npermanent seat of the government of the United States ought to be at\r\nsome convenient place on the banks of the river Susquehanna in the State\r\nof Pennsylvania;\" and a bill accordingly was sent to the Senate.\r\n\r\nHad the Senate agreed to this bill, there are some luminous pages of\r\nAmerican history that would never have been written; for the progress of\r\nevents would have taken quite another direction had the influences\r\nsurrounding the national capital for the first half of this century been\r\nNorthern instead of Southern. But the Senate did not agree. For \"the\r\nconvenient place on the banks of the Susquehanna\" it substituted ten\r\nmiles square on the river Delaware, beginning one mile from Philadelphia\r\nand including the village of Germantown. To this amendment the House\r\nagreed, and there, but for Madison, the matter would have ended. He had\r\nlabored earnestly for the site on the Potomac; but failing in that, he\r\nhoped to postpone the question till the next session of Congress, when\r\nthe representatives from North Carolina would be present. He moved a\r\nproviso that the laws of Pennsylvania should remain in force within the\r\ndistrict ceded by the State till Congress should otherwise provide by\r\nlaw. It seems to have been accepted without consideration, a single\r\nmember only saying that he saw no necessity for it. At any rate, whether\r\nthat was Mr. Madison's motive or not, time was gained, for it compelled\r\nthe return of the bill to the Senate. This was on September 28, and the\r\nnext day the session was closed by adjournment till the following\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nWhen in that next session the bill came back from the Senate to the\r\nHouse, a member from South Carolina said, in the course of debate, that\r\n\"a Quaker State was a bad neighborhood for the South Carolinians.\" The\r\nSenate had also come to that conclusion, for the bill now proposed that\r\nthe capital should be at Philadelphia for ten years only, and should\r\nthen be removed to the banks of the Potomac. It was done, Madison wrote\r\nto Monroe, by a single vote, for two Southern senators voted against it.\r\nBut the two senators from North Carolina were now present, and the\r\nmajority of one was made sure of somehow.\r\n\r\nSo much was gained by gaining time, and Madison thought the passage of\r\nthe bill through the House was possible, \"but attended with great\r\ndifficulties.\" Did he know how these difficulties were to be overcome?\r\n\"If the Potomac succeeds,\" he adds, \"it will have resulted from a\r\nfortuitous coincidence of circumstances which might never happen again.\"\r\nWhat the \"fortuitous coincidence\" was he does not explain; but the term\r\nwas a felicitous euphuism to cover up what in the blunter political\r\nlanguage of our time is called \"log-rolling.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader of this series of biographies is already familiar with\r\nHamilton's skillful barter of votes for the Potomac site of the capital\r\nin exchange for votes in favor of his scheme for the assumption of the\r\nstate debts. Madison seems not to have been ignorant of the progress of\r\nthat bargain, with which Jefferson was afterward so anxious to prove\r\nthat he had nothing to do. Madison earnestly opposed the assumption of\r\nthe state debts from first to last; but, when he saw that the measure\r\nwas sure to pass the House, he wrote to Monroe: \"I cannot deny that the\r\ncrisis demands a spirit of accommodation to a certain extent. If the\r\nmeasure should be adopted, I shall wish it to be considered as an\r\nunavoidable evil, and _possibly_ not the worst side of the dilemma.\" In\r\nother words, he was willing to assent silently to what he believed to be\r\na great injustice to several of the States, provided that the bargain\r\nshould be a gain to his own State. If Hamilton and Jefferson were\r\nsinners in this business, Madison will hardly pass for a saint.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Eleven years afterward, when the question of prohibiting\r\nthe carrying on the slave trade from American ports came up, one John\r\nBrown of Rhode Island said in Congress, \"Our distilleries and\r\nmanufactories were all lying idle for want of an extended commerce. He\r\nhad been well informed that on those coasts [African] New England rum\r\nwas much preferred to the best Jamaica spirits, and would fetch a better\r\nprice. Why should it not be sent there, and a profitable return be made?\r\nWhy should a heavy fine and imprisonment [of slave traders] be made the\r\npenalty for carrying on a trade so advantageous?\" Sixty years later\r\nstill, there was another Brown in Providence, Rhode Island, who was a\r\nmember of the Committee of the Kansas Aid Society of New England. He was\r\nabout to withdraw from it for want of time to attend to its\r\nduties,--had, indeed, actually sent in his resignation,--when news came\r\nof the doings of another John Brown at Harper's Ferry. The resignation\r\nwas instantly recalled, with the remark that it was not a time for\r\nBrowns to seem to be backward on the question of slavery. Such is the\r\nirony of coincidence in names.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The subsequent legislation on this subject is a curious\r\nexemplification of the ingenuity with which any law obnoxious to the\r\nowners of slaves was got rid of, when it was clear that it could not be\r\ndefeated by force of numbers. In 1806 a final attempt was made to impose\r\nthe duty of ten dollars upon slaves imported, and a resolution passed in\r\nfavor of it. This was referred to a committee, with instructions to\r\nbring in a bill. A bill was reported and pushed so far as a third\r\nreading, when it was recommitted, which put it off for a year. When it\r\nnext appeared it was a bill for the prohibition of the importation of\r\nslaves, in accordance with the constitutional provision that the traffic\r\nshould cease in 1808. The new question, after some debate, in which\r\nthere was no allusion to the tax, was postponed for further\r\nconsideration. But it never again came before the House. A month later,\r\nFebruary 13, 1807, a bill from the Senate, providing that the foreign\r\nslave trade should cease on the first day of the following January, was\r\nreceived and immediately concurred in, and that seems to have been\r\nsilently accepted as disposing of the whole subject. No tax was ever\r\npaid; but the importation of slaves, notwithstanding the law to put an\r\nend to importation in 1808, continued at the rate, it was estimated, of\r\nabout fifteen thousand a year. Probably it never ceased altogether till\r\nthe beginning of the rebellion of 1860.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nNATIONAL FINANCES--SLAVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nHamilton's famous report to the First Congress, as secretary of the\r\ntreasury, was made at the second session in January, 1790. Near the\r\nclose of the previous session a petition asking for some settlement of\r\nthe public debt was received and referred to a committee of which\r\nMadison was chairman. The committee reported in favor of the petition,\r\nand the House accordingly called upon the secretary to prepare a plan\r\n\"for the support of the public credit.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as Hamilton's funding scheme provided for that portion of the\r\ndebt due to foreigners, it was accepted without demur. There could be no\r\ndoubt that there the ostensible creditor was the real creditor, who\r\nshould be paid in full. The report assumed that this was equally true of\r\nthe domestic debt. A citizen holding a certificate of the indebtedness\r\nof the government, no matter how he came by it, nor at what price, was\r\nentitled to payment at its face value. But here the question was raised,\r\nWas this ostensible creditor the sole creditor? Was he, whose\r\nnecessities had compelled him to part with the government's note of hand\r\nat a large discount when full payment was impossible, to receive\r\nnothing now when at last government was able to pay in full? Was it\r\nequity to let all the loss fall upon the original creditor, and all the\r\ngain go to him who had lost nothing originally, and had only assumed at\r\nsmall cost the risk of a profitable speculation? Moreover it was\r\ncharged, and not denied, that in some of these speculations there had\r\nbeen no risk whatever; and that, so soon as the tenor of the report was\r\nknown, fast-sailing vessels were dispatched from New York to the\r\nCarolinas and Georgia to buy up public securities held by persons\r\nignorant of their recent rapid rise in value. As hitherto they had been\r\nworth only about fifteen cents on the dollar; as upon the publication of\r\nthe secretary's report they had risen to fifty cents on the dollar; and\r\nas, if the secretary's advice should be taken, they would rise to a\r\nhundred cents on the dollar,--it would be securing what in the slang of\r\nthe modern stock exchange is called \"a good thing\" to send agents into\r\nthe rural districts in advance of the news to buy up government paper.\r\n\"My soul rises indignant,\" exclaimed a member, \"at the avaricious and\r\nmoral turpitude which so vile a conduct displays.\" Nor on that point did\r\nanybody venture then to disagree with him openly.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the question as to who were in reality the public\r\ncreditors, a doubt was also raised whether the debt ought to be paid in\r\nfull to anybody. Every dollar of the foreign debt was for an actual\r\ndollar borrowed. But the domestic debt was not incurred to any large\r\namount for money borrowed, but in payment for services, or for\r\nprovisions and goods purchased, for which double, or more than double,\r\nprices had been exacted by those who exchanged them for government\r\npaper. If the exigencies of war had compelled the government to promise\r\nto pay for fifty bushels of wheat the price of a hundred bushels, the\r\ncreditor, now that the government was in a condition to redeem its\r\npromise, was not entitled in equity to receive more than the actual\r\nvalue of the fifty bushels at the time of the purchase. Moreover, it was\r\ncontended, there was no injustice in such a settlement of the debt, for\r\nthe war had been carried on and brought to a successful end, for the\r\nbenefit of the creditor as well as of everybody else. The argument was\r\nanalogous in a measure to that used by a certain class of politicians in\r\nour time, who maintained that the bonds of the United States, bought at\r\na discount for \"greenbacks\" during the late rebellion, should not be\r\nredeemed in gold when the war was over.\r\n\r\nThe answer to all this was obvious. The nation must first be just by\r\npaying its debts to those who could present the evidence that they were\r\nits creditors. If, when that was done, it could afford to be generous,\r\nit might, if so disposed, reimburse those who had lost by parting with\r\nthe certificates of debt at a discount. The government could not in\r\nhonor go behind its own contracts. The Constitution provided that \"all\r\ndebts and engagements, entered into before the adoption of this\r\nConstitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this\r\nConstitution as under the Confederation.\" Here was a debt which the\r\nConfederation had contracted, and the federal government had no more\r\nright \"to impair the obligation of contracts\" for its own benefit than\r\nthe separate States had; and that they were expressly forbidden by the\r\nConstitution to do.\r\n\r\nMadison listened quietly day after day to the long and earnest debates\r\nupon the subject, and then advanced an entirely new proposition. He\r\nagreed with one party in maintaining the inviolability of contracts. The\r\nConfederacy had incurred a debt to its own citizens which the new\r\ngovernment had agreed to assume. But he also agreed with the other party\r\nthat there was a question as to whom that debt was due. Were those who\r\nnow held the certificates entitled to the payment of their face value,\r\ndollar for dollar, although the cost to them was only somewhere from\r\nfifteen to fifty cents on the dollar? It was true that the original\r\ncontract was transferable, and these present creditors held the evidence\r\nof the transfer. But did that transfer entitle the holder to the full\r\nvalue without regard to the price paid for it? Was there not in equity a\r\nreserved right in the original holder, who, having given a full\r\nequivalent for the debt, had only parted with the evidence of it, under\r\nthe compulsion of his own poverty, and the inability of the government\r\nat that time to meet its obligations? Was not this specially true in\r\nthe case of the soldiers of the late war, to whose devotion and\r\nsacrifices the nation owed its existence?\r\n\r\nMr. Madison thought that an affirmative reply to the last two queries\r\nwould present the true view of the case, and he proposed, therefore, to\r\npay both classes of creditors,--those who now held the evidence of\r\nindebtedness, acquired by purchase at no matter what price; and those\r\nwho had parted with that evidence without receiving the amount which the\r\ngovernment had promised to pay for services rendered. It was not,\r\nhowever, to be expected that the entire debt should be paid in full to\r\nboth classes. That was beyond the ability of the government. But it\r\nwould be an equitable settlement, he contended, to pay the present\r\nholders the highest price the certificates had ever reached, and to\r\naward the remainder to those who were the original creditors.\r\n\r\nThis proposition received only thirteen votes out of forty-nine. Many of\r\nthose opposed to it were quite ready to grant that it was hard upon the\r\nveterans of the war that they, who had received so little and who had\r\nborne so much, should not now be recognized as creditors when at last\r\nthe government was able to pay its debts. But the House could not\r\nindulge in sentimental legislation. That would be to launch the ship of\r\nstate upon another sea of bankruptcy. There were in the hands of the\r\npeople tens of millions of paper money not worth at the current rate a\r\ncent on the dollar. If everybody who had lost was to be paid, the point\r\nwould soon be reached where nobody would be paid at all. A limit must be\r\nfixed somewhere; let it be at these certificates of debt which were the\r\nevidence of a contract made between the government and its creditors.\r\nThese could be paid, and they should be paid, to those who were in\r\nlawful possession of them. The law, if not the equity, of the case was\r\nclearly against Madison. That the government should be absolutely just\r\nto everybody who had ever trusted to it, and lost by it, was impossible.\r\nIt was a bankrupt compelled to name its preferred creditors, and it\r\nnamed those whom it was in honor and law bound to take care of, and over\r\nwhose claims there was, on the whole, the least shadow of doubt. That\r\nthe loss should remain chiefly with the soldiers of the Revolution, and\r\nthe gain fall chiefly to those who were shrewd enough, or had the means\r\nto speculate in the public funds, was a lamentable fact; but to\r\ndiscriminate between them was not within the right of the government.\r\nThat he would have had it discriminate was creditable to Madison's\r\nheart; it was rather less creditable to his head.\r\n\r\nOf course, underneath all this debate there lay other considerations\r\nthan those merely of debtor and creditor, of moral and legal obligation,\r\nof pity for the soldiers, and of strict regard for the letter of a\r\ncontract. Mr. Hamilton and his friends, it was said, were anxious to\r\nestablish the public credit, not so much because they wished to keep\r\nfaith with creditors as because they wished to strengthen the government\r\nand build up their own party. The reply to these accusations was, that\r\nthe other side, under pretense of consideration for the soldiers and\r\nothers on whom the burden of the war had borne most heavily, concealed\r\nhostility to the Constitution and a consolidated government. These were\r\nnot reflections to be spoken of in debate, but they were not the less\r\ncherished, and gave to it piquancy and spirit. There was truth on both\r\nsides without doubt.\r\n\r\nThough defeated in this measure, Madison was not less determined in his\r\nopposition to the assumption of the debts of the States. Of these debts\r\nsome States had discharged more than others; and he complained, not\r\nwithout reason, of the injustice of compelling those which had borne\r\ntheir own burdens unaided to share in the obligations which others had\r\nneglected. He was unfortunate, however, in assuming a superiority for\r\nVirginia over some of the Eastern States, and especially over\r\nMassachusetts, in services rendered in the struggle for independence.\r\nThe comparison provoked a call for official inquiry; and that proved\r\nthat Massachusetts alone had sent more men into the field during the war\r\nthan all the Southern States together. It was not much to be wondered\r\nat, when this fact was considered, that the debt of Massachusetts should\r\nbe larger than that of Virginia by $800,000. The difference between\r\nVirginia and South Carolina was the same, the truth being that the war\r\nhad cost Massachusetts more money to pay her soldiers for the general\r\nservice, and South Carolina more to repel the enemy upon her own soil,\r\nthan it had cost Virginia for either purpose. Massachusetts and South\r\nCarolina were again found acting together, simply because each of them\r\nhad a debt--$4,000,000--larger than that of any other State. The total\r\ndebt of all the States was about $21,000,000; and as that of North\r\nCarolina, Pennsylvania, or Connecticut, when added to the $8,000,000 of\r\nMassachusetts and South Carolina, amounted to half, or more, of the\r\nwhole sum, there was no difficulty in forming a strong combination in\r\nfavor of assumption. No combination, however, was strong enough to carry\r\nthe measure on its own merits, notwithstanding its advocates attempted\r\nto defeat the funding of the domestic debt of the Federal Union unless\r\nthe debts of the several States were assumed at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe domestic debt, however, was at length provided for, and the\r\nassumption of the debts of the States was rejected till that bargain,\r\nreferred to in the preceding chapter, which gave to the Southern States\r\nthe permanent seat of government, was concluded. It would not have been\r\ndifficult, probably, to defeat that piece of political jobbery by a\r\npublic exposure of its terms. Why Madison did not resort to it, if, as\r\nseems certain, he knew that such a bargain had been privately made, can\r\nonly be conjectured. Perhaps he saw that Hamilton, who was applauded by\r\nhis friends and denounced by his enemies for his clever management, had,\r\nafter all, only made a temporary gain; and that Jefferson, whose defense\r\nwas that Hamilton had taken advantage of his ignorance and innocence,\r\nwould not, had he not been short-sighted, have made any defense at all.\r\nFor the assumption of the state debts by the general government was only\r\na distribution of a single local burden; and this was a small price for\r\nVirginia and the other Southern States to pay for the permanent\r\npossession of the federal capital.\r\n\r\nWhile these questions were pending, another was thrown into the House\r\nwhich was not disposed of for nearly two months. The debates upon it,\r\nMadison said in one of his letters, \"were shamefully indecent,\" though\r\nhe thought the introduction of the subject into Congress injudicious.\r\nThe Yearly Meeting of Friends in New York and in Pennsylvania sent a\r\nmemorial against the continued toleration of the slave trade; and this\r\nwas followed the next day by a petition from the Pennsylvania Society\r\nfor the Promotion of the Abolition of Slavery, signed by Benjamin\r\nFranklin as president, asking for a more radical measure.\r\n\r\n     \"They earnestly entreat,\" they said, \"your serious attention to the\r\n     subject of slavery; that you will be pleased to countenance the\r\n     restoration of liberty to these unhappy men, who alone in this land\r\n     of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage, and who, amidst\r\n     the general joy of surrounding freemen, are groaning in servile\r\n     subjection; that you will devise means for removing this\r\n     inconsistency from the character of the American people; that you\r\n     will promote mercy and justice towards this distressed race; and\r\n     that you will step to the very verge of the power vested in you for\r\n     discouraging every species of traffic in the persons of our\r\n     fellow-men.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were probably Franklin's own, and, as he died a few weeks\r\nafter they were written, they may be considered as his dying words to\r\nhis countrymen,--counsel wise and merciful as his always was.\r\n\r\nA memorable debate followed the presentation of these memorials. Even in\r\nthe imperfect report of it that has come down to us, the \"shameful\r\nindecency\" of which Madison speaks is visible enough. Franklin,\r\nvenerable in years, exalted in character, and eminent above almost all\r\nthe men of the time for services to his country, was sneered at for\r\nsenility and denounced as disregarding the obligations of the\r\nConstitution. But the wrath of the pro-slavery extremists was specially\r\naroused against the Society of Friends, and was unrestrained by any\r\nconsiderations of either decency or truth. In this respect the debate\r\nwas the precursor of every contest in Congress upon the subject that was\r\nto follow for the coming seventy years. The Quakers were the\r\nrepresentative abolitionists of that day, and the measure of bitter and\r\nangry denunciation that was meted out to them was the same measure\r\nwhich, heaped up and overflowing, was poured out upon those who, in\r\nlater times, took upon themselves the burden of the cause of the slave.\r\nThe line of argument, the appeals to prejudice, the disregard of facts\r\nand the false conclusions, the misrepresentation of past history and the\r\nmisapprehension of the future, the contempt of reason, of common sense,\r\nand common humanity, then laboriously and unscrupulously arrayed in\r\ndefense of slavery, left nothing for the exercise of the ingenuity of\r\nmodern orators. A single difference only between the earlier and the\r\nlater time is conspicuous; the \"plantation manners,\" as they were called\r\nfive and twenty years ago, which the Wises, the Brookses, the\r\nBarksdales, and the Priors of the modern South relied upon as potent\r\nweapons of defense and assault, were unknown in the earlier Congresses.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison and some other members from the South, particularly those\r\nfrom Virginia, opposed the majority of their colleagues, who were\r\nunwilling that these memorials should be referred to a committee. \"The\r\ntrue policy of the Southern members,\" Madison wrote to a friend, \"was to\r\nhave let the affair proceed with as little noise as possible, and to\r\nhave made use of the occasion to obtain, along with an assertion of the\r\npowers of Congress, a recognition of the restraints imposed by the\r\nConstitution.\" This in effect was done in the end, but not till near two\r\nmonths had passed, within which time the more violent of the Southern\r\nmembers had ample opportunity to free their minds and exhaust the\r\nsubject. The more these people talked the worse it was, of course, for\r\ntheir cause. Had Madison's moderate advice been accepted then, and had\r\nthat example been followed for the next sixty or seventy years, it is\r\nquite likely that the colored race would still be in bondage in at least\r\none half of the States. But there was never a more notable example of\r\nmanifest destiny than the gradual but certain progress of the opposition\r\nto slavery; for there never was a system, any attempt to defend which\r\nshowed how utterly indefensible such a system must needs be. Every\r\nargument advanced in its favor was so manifestly absurd, or so shocking\r\nto the ordinary sense of mankind, that the more it was discussed the\r\nmore widespread and earnest became the opposition. Had the slaveholders\r\nbeen wise, they would never have opened their mouths upon the subject.\r\nBut, like the man possessed of the devil, they never ceased to cry, \"Let\r\nme alone!\" And the more they cried, the more there were who understood\r\nwhere that cry came from.\r\n\r\nIn one respect Mr. Madison declared that the memorial of the Friends\r\ndemanded attention. If the American flag was used to protect foreigners\r\nin carrying on the slave trade in other countries, that was a proper\r\nsubject for the consideration of Congress. \"If this is the case,\" he\r\nsaid, \"is there any person of humanity that would not wish to prevent\r\nthem?\"[13] But he recognized the limitations of the Constitution in\r\nrelation to the importation of slaves into the United States, and the\r\nwant of any authority in the letter of the Constitution, or of any wish\r\non the part of Congress, to interfere with slavery in the States. On\r\nthese points he would have a decisive declaration, without agitation,\r\nand with as little discussion as possible, and there would have dropped\r\nthe subject. It only needed, he evidently thought, that everybody, North\r\nand South, should understand the Constitution to be a mutual agreement\r\nto let slavery altogether alone, when the bargain would be on both sides\r\nfaithfully adhered to.\r\n\r\nThis was all very well with the numerous persons who were quite\r\nindifferent to the subject, or who thought it very unreasonable in the\r\nblacks not to be quite willing to remain slaves a few hundred years\r\nlonger. But there were two other classes to reckon with, and Mr. Madison\r\nwas not much inclined to be patient with either of them. To let the\r\nsubject alone was precisely what the hot-headed members from the South\r\nwere incapable of doing then, as they proved to be incapable of doing\r\nfor the next seventy years. On the other hand, all the petitioners could\r\nreally hope for was that there should be discussion. The galleries were\r\ncrowded at those earliest debates, as they continued to be crowded on\r\nall such occasions in subsequent years. Many went to learn what could be\r\nsaid on behalf of slavery, who came away convinced that the least said\r\nthe better. Agitation might disturb the harmony of the Union, which was\r\nMadison's dread; it might lead to the death of an abolitionist, as it\r\nsometimes did in later times; but it was sure in the end to be the death\r\nof slavery, though its short-sighted defenders could never understand\r\nwhy. They could never be made to see that its most dangerous foes were\r\nthe friends of its own household, who could not hold their tongues; that\r\nfor their case all wisdom was epitomized in the vulgar caution \"to lie\r\nlow and keep dark;\" that the exposure of the true character of slavery\r\nmust needs be its destruction, and that nothing so exposed it as any\r\nattempt to defend it. Slavery was quite safe under the Constitution, as\r\nMr. Madison intimated, if its friends would only leave it there and\r\nclaim no other protection.\r\n\r\nAdvocates are never wanting in any court who believe that the most\r\neffective line of defense is to abuse the plaintiff. The Quakers, it was\r\nsaid, \"notwithstanding their outward pretenses,\" had no \"more virtue or\r\nreligion than other people, nor perhaps so much.\" They had not made\r\nthe Constitution, nor risked their lives and fortunes by fighting for\r\ntheir country. Why should they \"set themselves up in such a particular\r\nmanner against slavery\"? Did they not know that the Bible not only\r\nallowed but commended it, \"from Genesis to Revelation\"? That the Saviour\r\nhad permitted it? That the Apostles, in spreading Christianity, had\r\nnever preached against it? That it had been--the illustration was not\r\naltogether a happy one--\"no novel doctrine since the days of Cain\"? The\r\ncondition of these American slaves was said to be one of great happiness\r\nand comfort; yet almost in the same breath it was asserted that to\r\nexcite in their minds any hope of change would lead to the most\r\ndisastrous consequences, and possibly to massacre. The memorialists were\r\nbidden to remember that, even if slavery \"were an evil, it was one for\r\nwhich there was no remedy;\" for that reason the North had acquiesced in\r\nit; \"a compromise was made on both sides,--we took each other, with our\r\nmutual bad habits and respective evils, for better, for worse; the\r\nNorthern States adopted us with our slaves, and we adopted them with\r\ntheir Quakers.\" Without such a compromise there could have been no\r\nUnion, and any interference now with slavery by the government would end\r\nin a civil war. These people were meddling with what was none of their\r\nbusiness, and exciting the slaves to insurrection. Yet how forbearing\r\nwere the people of the Southern States who, notwithstanding all this,\r\n\"had not required the assistance of Congress to exterminate the\r\nQuakers!\"\r\n\r\nThis was not conciliatory. Those who had been disposed at the beginning\r\nto meet the petitions with a quiet reply that the subject was out of the\r\njurisdiction of Congress were now provoked to give them a much warmer\r\nreception. They could not listen patiently to the abuse of the Quakers,\r\nand, though they might acquiesce in the toleration of slavery, they were\r\nnot inclined to have it crammed down their throats as a wise,\r\nbeneficent, and consistent condition of society under a republican\r\ngovernment. Even Madison, who at first was most anxious that nothing\r\nshould be said or done to arouse agitation, while acknowledging that all\r\ncitizens might rightfully appeal to Congress for a redress of what they\r\nconsidered grievances, was moved at last to say that the memorial of the\r\nFriends was \"well worthy of consideration.\" While admitting that under\r\nthe Constitution the slave trade could not be prohibited for twenty\r\nyears, \"yet,\" he declared, \"there are a variety of ways by which it\r\n[Congress] could countenance the abolition, and regulations might be\r\nmade in relation to the introduction of [slavery] into the new States to\r\nbe formed out of the western territory.\"\r\n\r\nGerry was still more emphatic in the assertion of the right of\r\ninterference. He boldly asserted that \"flagrant acts of cruelty\" were\r\ncommitted in carrying on the African slave trade; and, while nobody\r\nproposed to violate the Constitution, \"that we have a right to regulate\r\nthis business is as clear as that we have any right whatever; nor has\r\nthe contrary been shown by anybody who has spoken on the occasion.\" Nor\r\ndid he stop there. He told the slaveholders that the value of their\r\nslaves in money was only about ten million dollars, and that Congress\r\nhad the right to propose \"to purchase the whole of them; and their\r\nresources in the western territory might furnish them with the means.\"\r\nThe Southern members would, perhaps, have been startled by such a\r\nproposition as this, had he not immediately added that \"he did not\r\nintend to suggest a measure of this kind; he only instanced these\r\nparticulars to show that Congress certainly had a right to intermeddle\r\nin the business.\" It is quite likely, had he pushed such a measure with\r\nhis well-known zeal and determination, that it would have been at least\r\nreceived with a good deal of favor; and, as the admirers of Jefferson\r\nare tenacious of his fame as the author of the original Northwest\r\nOrdinance, so Gerry, had he seriously and earnestly urged the policy of\r\nusing the proceeds of the sales of territorial lands to remunerate the\r\nowners of slaves for their liberation, would have left behind him a more\r\nfragrant memory than that which clings to him as a minister to France,\r\nand as the \"Gerrymandering\" governor of Massachusetts. The debate,\r\nhowever, came to an end at last with no other result than that which\r\nwould have been reached at the beginning without debate, except,\r\nperhaps, that the vote in favor of the reports upon the memorials was\r\nsmaller than it might have been had there been no discussion.\r\n\r\nWithin less than two years, however, Warner Mifflin of Delaware, an\r\neminent member of the Society of Friends, who was one of the first, if\r\nnot the first, of that society to manumit his own slaves, petitioned\r\nCongress to take some measure for general emancipation. The petition was\r\nentered upon the journal; but on a subsequent day a North Carolina\r\nmember, Mr. Steele, said that, \"after what had passed at New York on\r\nthis subject, he had hoped the House would have heard no more of it;\"\r\nand he moved that the petition be returned to Mifflin and be expunged\r\nfrom the journal. Fisher Ames explained in a rather apologetic tone that\r\nhe had presented the petition at Mr. Mifflin's request, because the\r\nmember from Delaware was absent, and because he believed in the right of\r\npetition, though \"he considered it as totally inexpedient to interfere\r\nwith the subject.\" The House agreed that the petition should be\r\nreturned, and Steele then withdrew the motion to expunge it from the\r\njournal.\r\n\r\nIn the next Congress, eighteen months afterward, the House took up the\r\nsubject of the slave trade, apparently of its own motion, and a bill was\r\npassed prohibiting the carrying on of that traffic from the ports of the\r\nUnited States in foreign vessels. The question was as inexorable as\r\ndeath, and the difference in regard to it then was precisely what it\r\nwas in the final discussion of the next century which settled it\r\nforever. One set of men was given over to perdition if they dared so\r\nmuch as talk; the other set talked all the more, and went to the very\r\nverge of the Constitution in act all the more, because they were bidden\r\nneither to speak nor to move. Courage was not one of Madison's marked\r\ncharacteristics, but he never showed more of it than in his hostility to\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fisher Ames]\r\n\r\nAt the third session of the First Congress, which had adjourned from New\r\nYork to Philadelphia, where it met in December, 1790, Madison led his\r\nparty in opposition to the establishment of a national bank, which\r\nHamilton had recommended; and again, as in the adjustment of the\r\ndomestic debt, he and his party were defeated. He compared the\r\nadvantages and the disadvantages of banks, and possibly he did not\r\nsatisfy himself, as he certainly did not the other side, that the weight\r\nof the argument was against their utility. At any rate, he fell back\r\nupon the Constitution as his strongest position. To incorporate a bank\r\nwas not, he maintained, among the powers conferred upon Congress. The\r\nFederalists, who were beginning to recognize him as the leader of the\r\nopposition, were quite ready to accept that challenge. \"Little doubt\r\nremains,\" said Fisher Ames in rising to reply, \"with respect to the\r\nutility of banks.\" Assuming that to be settled,--whether he meant, or\r\nnot, that such was the conclusion to be drawn from Madison's argument\r\non that point,--he addressed himself to the constitutional question. If\r\nthe incorporation of a bank was forbidden by the Constitution, there was\r\nan end of the matter. If it was not forbidden, but if Congress may\r\nexercise powers not expressly bestowed upon it, and if by a bank some of\r\nthe things which the federal government had to do could be best done, it\r\nwould be not only right but wise to establish such an agency. This was\r\nthe burden of the argument of the Federalists, and Madison and his\r\nfriends had no sufficient answer. The bill was at length passed by a\r\nvote of thirty-nine to twenty.\r\n\r\nBut it had still to pass the ordeal of the cabinet. The President was\r\nnot disposed to rely upon his own judgment either one way or the other.\r\nHe asked, therefore, for the written opinions of the secretaries of the\r\ntreasury and of state, Hamilton and Jefferson, and the attorney-general,\r\nRandolph. The same request was made to Madison, probably more because\r\nWashington held his ability and knowledge of constitutional law in high\r\nesteem than because of the prominent part he had taken in the debate.\r\nHamilton's argument in favor of the bill was an answer to the papers of\r\nthe three other gentlemen, and was accepted as conclusive by the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The most serious difficulty in the way of the final\r\nsuppression of the African slave trade in the present century was, that\r\nit could be carried on without molestation in American bottoms, under\r\nthe American flag. The ruling power in the United States, from 1787 to\r\n1860, was never willing that their own cruisers should meddle with the\r\nslavers, and resented as an insult to the flag the search, by the\r\ncruisers of other powers, of any vessel under the American flag, though\r\nit might be absolutely certain that she had come straight from the coast\r\nof Africa, and that her \"between-decks\" was crowded full of negroes to\r\nbe sold as slaves in Cuba.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFEDERALISTS AND REPUBLICANS\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison was a Federalist until, unfortunately, he drifted into the\r\nopposition. He was swept away partly, perhaps, by the influence of\r\npersonal friends, particularly of Jefferson, and partly by the influence\r\nof locality,--that \"go-with-the-State\" doctrine, which is a harmless\r\nkind of patriotism when kept within proper limits, but dangerous in a\r\nmixed government like ours when unrestrained. Had he been born in a free\r\nState it seems more than probable that he would never have been\r\nPresident; but it is quite possible that his place in the history of his\r\ncountry would have been higher. The better part of his life was before\r\nhe became a party leader. As his career is followed the presence of the\r\nstatesman grows gradually dimmer in the shadow of the successful\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the three sessions of the First Congress the line was\r\ndistinctly drawn between the Federal and Republican (or Democratic)\r\nparties. The Federalists, it was evident, had succeeded in firmly\r\nuniting thirteen separate States into one great nation, or into what, in\r\ndue time, was sure to become a great nation. It was no longer a loose\r\nassemblage of thirteen independent bodies, revolving, indeed, around a\r\ncentral power, but with a centrifugal motion that might at any time send\r\nthem flying off into space, or destroy them by collisions at various\r\ntangents. Those who opposed the Federalists, however, had no fear of a\r\ntendency to tangents; the danger was, as they believed, of too much\r\ncentripetal forces and that the circling planets might fall into the\r\ncentral sun and disappear altogether. Even if there were no flying off\r\ninto space, and no falling into the sun, they had no faith in this sort\r\nof political astronomy. They were unwilling to float in fixed orbits\r\nobedient to a supreme law other than their own.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to doubt the honesty of either party then, whatever\r\ncame to pass in later years. Nor, however, is there any more doubt now\r\nwhich was the wiser. Before the end of the century the administration of\r\ngovernment was wrested from the hands of those who had created the\r\nUnion; and within fifteen years more the Federal party, under that name,\r\nhad disappeared. It would not be quite just to say that they were\r\nopposed for no better reason than because they were in power. But it is\r\nquite true that the principles and the policy of the Federalists\r\nsurvived the party organization; and they not only survived, but, so far\r\nas the opposite party was ever of service to the country, it was when\r\nthat party adopted the federal measures. It was in accordance with the\r\nearly principles of Federalism that the republic was defended and saved\r\nin the war of 1860-65; as it was the principles of the Democratic\r\nstate-rights party, administered by a slaveholding oligarchy, that made\r\nthat war inevitable.\r\n\r\nHamilton said, in the well-known Carrington letter in the spring of\r\n1792, that he was thoroughly convinced by Madison's course in the late\r\nCongress that he, \"coöperating with Mr. Jefferson, is at the head of a\r\nfaction decidedly hostile to me and my administration, and actuated by\r\nviews, in my judgment, subversive of the principles of good government,\r\nand dangerous to the union, peace, and happiness of the country.\" At\r\nfirst he was disposed to believe, because of his \"previous impressions\r\nof the fairness of Mr. Madison's character,\" that there was nothing\r\npersonal or factious in this hostility. But he soon changed his mind. Up\r\nto the time of the meeting of the First Congress there had always been\r\nperfect accord between them, and Hamilton accepted his seat in the\r\ncabinet \"under the full persuasion,\" he said, \"that from similarity of\r\nthinking, conspiring with personal good-will, I should have the firm\r\nsupport of Mr. Madison in the general course of my administration.\" But\r\nwhen he found in Madison his most determined opponent, either open or\r\ncovert, in the most important measures he urged upon Congress,--the\r\nsettlement of the domestic debt, the assumption of the debts of the\r\nStates, and the establishment of a national bank,--he was compelled to\r\nseek for other than public motives for this opposition. \"It had been,\"\r\nhe declared, \"more uniform and persevering than I have been able to\r\nresolve into a sincere difference of opinion. I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat Mr. Madison and I, whose politics had formerly so much the same\r\npoint of departure, should now diverge so widely in our opinions of the\r\nmeasures which are proper to be pursued.\"\r\n\r\nIn the letter from which these extracts are made Jefferson and Madison\r\nare painted as almost equally black, though the color was laid the\r\nthicker on Jefferson, if there was any difference. Hamilton seemed to\r\nthink that, if Jefferson was the more malicious, Madison was the more\r\nartful. He is accused of an attempt to get the better of the secretary\r\nof the treasury by a trick which was dishonorable in itself, and at the\r\nsame time an abuse of the confidence reposed in him by Washington.\r\nBefore sending in his message at the opening of the Second Congress the\r\nPresident submitted it to Madison, who, Hamilton declares, so altered\r\nit, by transposing a passage and by the addition of a few words, that\r\nthe President was made to seem, unconsciously to himself, to approve of\r\nJefferson's proposal to establish the same unit for coins as for\r\nweights. This would have been to disapprove of the proposal of the\r\nsecretary of the treasury that the dollar should remain the unit of\r\ncoinage. The statement rests on Hamilton's assertion; and as he had\r\nforgotten the words which made the change he complained of, and as the\r\nmessage was restored to its original form by the President when its\r\npossible interpretation was pointed out to him, it is impossible now to\r\njudge whether Madison may not have been quite innocent of the intention\r\nimputed to him. It is plain enough, however, that Hamilton was sore and\r\ndisappointed at Madison's conduct, and that he was quick to seize upon\r\nany incident that justified him in saying, \"The opinion I once\r\nentertained of the candor and simplicity and fairness of Mr. Madison's\r\ncharacter has, I acknowledge, given way to a decided opinion that it is\r\none of a peculiarly artificial and complicated kind.\" To justify this\r\nopinion, and as an evidence of how bitter Madison's political and\r\npersonal enmity toward him had become, he refers in the same letter to\r\nMadison's relation to Freneau and his paper, \"The National Gazette.\" \"As\r\nthe coadjutor of Jefferson,\" he wrote, \"in the establishment of this\r\npaper, I include Mr. Madison in the consequences imputable to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of Freneau need not be repeated here at length, having been\r\nalready told in another volume of this series of biographies. If there\r\nwere anything in that affair, however, for which Jefferson could be\r\nfairly called to account, Madison may be held as not less responsible.\r\nWhen the charge was made that he had a sinister motive in procuring for\r\nFreneau a clerkship in the State Department, and in aiding him to\r\nestablish a newspaper, Madison frankly related the facts in a letter to\r\nEdmund Randolph. He had nothing to deny except to repel with some\r\nindignation the charge that he had helped to establish the journal in\r\norder that it might \"sap the Constitution,\" or that there was the\r\nslightest expectation or intention on his part of any relation between\r\nthe State Department and the newspaper. Freneau was one of his college\r\nfriends, a deserving man, to whom he was attached, and whom he was glad\r\nto help. There was nothing improper in commending one well qualified to\r\ndischarge its duties for the post of translator in a government office;\r\nand as those duties, for which the yearly salary was only two hundred\r\nand fifty dollars, were light, there was no good reason why the clerk\r\nshould not find other employment for leisure hours.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Madison, having said this, had stopped there, his critics would\r\nhave been silenced. But when he added that he advised his friend with\r\nanother motive besides that of helping him to start a newspaper, then,\r\nas the expressive modern phrase is, he \"gave himself away.\" There is a\r\nfeeling, common even in those early and innocent days when such things\r\nwere rare, that the editor, whose daily bread, whether it be cake or\r\ncrust, comes from the bounty of the man in office or other place of\r\npower,--that an editor so fed, and perhaps fattened, is only a servant\r\nbought at a price. Madison said that to help a needy man whom he held in\r\nhigh esteem was his \"primary and governing motive.\" But he adds: \"That,\r\nas a consequential one, I entertained hopes that a free paper ... would\r\nbe an antidote to the doctrines and discourses circulated in favor of\r\nmonarchy and aristocracy; would be an acceptable vehicle of public\r\ninformation in many places not sufficiently supplied with it,--this also\r\nis a certain truth.\" What was this but an acknowledgment of the\r\nessential truth of the charge brought against Jefferson and himself? Not\r\nthat he might not devoutly hope for an antidote to the poisonous\r\ndoctrines of monarchy and aristocracy, though in very truth the\r\nexistence of any such poison was only one of the maggots which, bred in\r\nthe muck of party strife, had found a lodgment in his brain; not that it\r\nwas not a commendable public spirit to wish for a good newspaper to\r\ncirculate where it was most needed; not that it was not a most excellent\r\nthing in him to hold out a helping hand to the friend who had been less\r\nfortunate than himself,--but that, in helping his friend to a clerkship\r\nin a department of the government, his motive was in part that the\r\npossession of a public office would enable the man to establish a party\r\norgan. That was precisely the point of the charge which he seems to have\r\nfailed to apprehend,--that public patronage was used at his suggestion\r\nto further party ends.\r\n\r\nFreneau had intended to start a newspaper somewhere in New Jersey.\r\nWhether or not that known intention suggested that the project could be\r\nbetter carried out in Philadelphia, and a clerkship in the State\r\nDepartment would be an aid to it, the change of plan was adopted and the\r\nclerkship bestowed upon him. The paper--the first number of which\r\nappeared five days after his appointment--was, as it was known that it\r\nwould be, an earnest defender of Jefferson and his friends, and a\r\nformidable opponent of Hamilton and his party. The logical conclusion\r\nwas that the man, being put in place for a purpose, was diligent in\r\nusing the opportunities the place afforded him to fulfill the hopes of\r\nthose to whom he was indebted. Madison and Jefferson both denied, with\r\nmuch heat and indignation, that they had anything to do with the\r\neditorial conduct of the paper. No doubt they spoke the truth. They had\r\nto draw the line somewhere; they drew it there; and an exceedingly sharp\r\nand fine line it was. For it is plain that Freneau knew very well what\r\nhe was about and what was expected of him, and his powerful friends knew\r\nvery well that he knew it. They could feel in him the most implicit\r\nconfidence as an untamed and untamable democrat, and one, perhaps, whose\r\ngratitude would be kept alive by the remembrance of poverty and the hope\r\nof future favors. There was clearly no need of a board of directors for\r\nthe editorial supervision of \"The National Gazette,\" and it was quite\r\nsafe to deny that any existed. The fact, nevertheless, remained that a\r\nseat had been given the editor at Mr. Jefferson's elbow.\r\n\r\nThree months before Madison heard that his relation to Freneau was\r\nbringing him under public censure, he showed an evident interest in the\r\n\"Gazette\" hardly consistent with his subsequent avowal of having nothing\r\nto do with its management. In a letter to Jefferson he refers to the\r\npostage on newspapers established by the bill for the regulation of\r\npost-offices, and fears that it will prove a grievance in the loss of\r\nsubscribers. He suggests that a notice be given that the papers \"will\r\nnot be put into the mail, but _sent as heretofore_,\" meaning by that,\r\nprobably, that they would be sent under the franks of members of\r\nCongress, or by any other chance that might offer. \"Will you,\" he adds,\r\n\"hint this to Freneau? His subscribers in this quarter seem pretty well\r\nsatisfied with the degree of regularity and safety with which they get\r\nthe papers, and highly pleased with the paper itself.\" This was careful\r\ndry-nursing for the bantling which had been provided with so comfortable\r\na cradle in the State Department.\r\n\r\nThe political casuist of our time may wonder at the importance which\r\nattached to this Freneau affair. We are taught that \"there were giants\r\nin those days,\" but we may also remember that in the modern science of\r\n\"practical politics\" they were as babes and sucklings. Madison was\r\nmaking good his place as a leader of the opposition hardly second to\r\nJefferson himself. As with Hamilton, so with the Federalists generally,\r\nhe fell more even than Jefferson fell in their esteem. He fell more,\r\nbecause he had farther to fall. No man had been more earnest than he\r\nfor a consolidated government; no one had shown more activity to bring\r\nabout a convention to frame a federal Constitution; and when at last\r\nthat work was done, no one, not even Hamilton himself, was more zealous\r\nto convince his countrymen that national salvation depended upon union,\r\nand that union was hopeless unless the Constitution should be adopted.\r\nThe disappointment and the shock were all the greater when he gradually\r\ndrew off from those who had hitherto counted him as on their side. They\r\ncould not understand how he could find so much to oppose in the\r\nlegitimate administration--as they believed it to be--of a Constitution\r\nhe had done so much to create, and the beneficent results of which he\r\nhad foreseen and foretold. Or, if they understood him, it was on the\r\nsupposition that he had thrown his convictions and his principles to the\r\nwinds, abandoned his old friends and attached himself to new ones, from\r\nmotives of personal ambition. This, of course, may not have been\r\nabsolutely just. It is quite possible that he did not deliberately\r\nsurrender his principles, but persuaded himself that he was as true as\r\never to the Constitution. It is, nevertheless, certainly true that the\r\nmen with whom he was now acting were the men who, having failed to\r\nprevent the adoption of the Constitution, now aimed, by zealous\r\nendeavors for an assumed strict construction, to defeat the purpose for\r\nwhich it was framed.[14]\r\n\r\nNaturally his motives were suspected, and his conduct narrowly watched.\r\nJefferson's influence over him was known to be great, and Jefferson had\r\nhad nothing to do with the framing of the Constitution, had been\r\ndoubtful at first of its wisdom, and gave his assent to it at last with\r\nmany doubts. The Anti-Federal party was growing gradually stronger in\r\nVirginia as in all the Southern States; most of Madison's warmest\r\npersonal friends, as well as Jefferson, were of that party. What chance\r\nwould he have in the public career he had marked out for himself if his\r\npath and theirs led in opposite directions? How much he was influenced\r\nby these considerations it is impossible to tell; perhaps he himself\r\ncould not have told. Perhaps they were not even considerations, but only\r\nunconscious influences, which he would have thrown behind him had he\r\nrecognized them as possible motives. To others, however, whether justly\r\nor not, they were quite sufficient to explain his course, and, once\r\naccepted, no other explanation was sought for. The appointment of\r\nFreneau to office at Madison's request, followed by the almost immediate\r\nappearance of a violent party organ, edited by this clerk in Mr.\r\nJefferson's department, was quite enough to raise an outcry among the\r\nFederalists; and Madison's explanation, when it came to be known, of his\r\nshare in that business, did not add to his reputation either for\r\nfrankness or political rectitude. Perhaps it was at first more the\r\nseeming want of frankness that disgusted his old friends. They could\r\nhave more readily forgiven him had he openly declared that he had gone\r\nover to the enemy, instead of professing to find in the Constitution\r\nsufficient ground for hostility to their measures. These constitutional\r\nscruples they sometimes thought so thin a disguise of other motives as\r\nto be better deserving of ridicule than of argument.\r\n\r\nAll he said and did was watched with suspicion. In the interval between\r\nthe First and Second Congresses, he and Jefferson made a tour through\r\nsome of the Eastern States, as they said, for relaxation and pleasure.\r\nBut it was looked upon as a strategic movement. Interviews between them\r\nand Livingston and Burr in New York were reported to Hamilton as \"a\r\npassionate courtship.\" They visited Albany, it was said, \"under the\r\npretext of a botanical excursion,\" but in reality to meet with Clinton.\r\nBotany naturally suggests agriculture, and as they continued on their\r\njourney into New England they were accused of \"sowing tares\" as they\r\ntraveled. Such treachery would have been considered as aggravated by\r\nhypocrisy had it been known then that on his return Mr. Madison wrote to\r\nhis father from New York: \"The tour I lately made with Mr. Jefferson,\r\nof which I have given the outlines to my brother, was a very agreeable\r\none, and carried us through interesting country, new to us both.\" This\r\nwas cool, if the journey really was a political reconnoissance.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Madison may have been for a time a special target for this\r\nkind of partisan rancor, it was by no means confined to him. Jefferson\r\nhad a very pretty talent for exasperating his enemies, and nobody could\r\nlong divide with him the distinction of being the best hated man in the\r\ncountry. A curious instance of it was given when the question was\r\ndiscussed, both in the First and Second Congresses, as to the successor\r\nto the presidency in case the office should become vacant by the deaths\r\nof both President and Vice-President. A bill was sent down from the\r\nSenate to the House providing, in case such a thing should ever happen,\r\nthat the president _pro tempore_ of the Senate, or, should the Senate\r\nhave no temporary president, the speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, should succeed to the vacant office. The House sent\r\nback the bill with an amendment substituting the secretary of state for\r\nthe succession in the possible vacancy instead of the presiding officers\r\nof the two houses of Congress. Madison was very earnest for this\r\namendment, but the Senate rejected it, and the House finally assented to\r\nthe original bill. It was shown in the course of the debate that\r\naccording to the doctrine of chances the office of president would not\r\ndevolve, through the accident of death, upon a third person oftener than\r\nonce in about eight hundred and forty years. The rejection of the\r\namendment naming the secretary of state as the proper person to succeed\r\nto the presidency, in the improbable event supposed, was nevertheless\r\nresented by the Republicans as a direct reflection upon Mr. Jefferson.\r\nNor did the Federalists deny it. With grim humor they seized upon the\r\nopportunity, apparently, to announce that not with their consent should\r\nhe ever be president, even by accident, though he should wait literally\r\neight hundred and forty years. It was a long-range shot, but there could\r\nnot have been one better aimed.\r\n\r\nIf before there had been some room for hope, Madison's course in the\r\nSecond Congress left no doubt as to which party he had cast his lot\r\nwith. His hostility to the establishment of a bank was, he thought,\r\njustified by what he saw at the opening of the subscription books in New\r\nYork. The anxiety to get possession of the stock was not to him an\r\nevidence of public confidence, and an argument, therefore, in favor of\r\nsuch an institution, but \"a mere scramble for so much public plunder.\"\r\nHe could only see that \"stock-jobbing drowns every other subject. The\r\ncoffee-house is in an eternal buzz with the gamblers.\" \"It pretty\r\nclearly appears also,\" he said, \"in what proportions the public debt\r\nlies in the country, what sort of hands holding it, and by whom the\r\npeople of the United States are to be governed.\" Here, perhaps, was one\r\ncause of his hostility to Hamilton's financial policy. Its immediate\r\nbenefit was for that class whose pecuniary stake in the stability of the\r\ngovernment was the largest. This class was chiefly in the Northern\r\nStates, where capital was in money and was always on the lookout for\r\nsafe and profitable investment. At the South, capital was in slaves and\r\nland, and could not be easily changed. If the Bank and the bondholders\r\nwere to exercise--as he feared they would, and as he believed that the\r\nFederalists meant they should--a controlling influence over the\r\ngovernment, it was certainly pretty apparent \"by whom the people of the\r\nUnited States were to be governed.\" It would be the North, not the\r\nSouth; and he was a Virginian before he was a Unionist.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was influenced by this consideration when he proposed that\r\nthe payment of the domestic debt should be divided between those who had\r\noriginally held, and those who had acquired by purchase, the\r\ncertificates of indebtedness. The public creditors would in that case\r\nhave been more widely distributed in different sections of the country\r\nand among different classes. The thought, at any rate, does not seem to\r\nhave been a new one when he saw and reported the eagerness with which\r\nthe bank stock was sought for, denounced it as stock-jobbing and\r\ngambling, and indignantly reflected that in these men he saw the future\r\ngovernors of the country, and particularly of his own people. No doubt\r\nthere was a good deal of speculation; and, as at all such times, there\r\nwere a few who made fortunes, while many, who had at first much money\r\nand no stock, next much stock and no money, had at last neither stock\r\nnor money. But Mr. Madison's indignation was quite wasted, and his fears\r\nquite unfounded. Neither the stock-jobbers, the Bank, nor the\r\nbondholders ever usurped the government, whatever may have been\r\nHamilton's hopes or schemes, if he had any other than to serve his\r\ncountry. The money-power of the North built cities and ships, factories\r\nand towns, and stretched out its hands to the great lakes and over the\r\nbroad prairies, to add to its dominion, to extend its civilization, and\r\nto give to labor and industry their due reward. It was the South that\r\ndevoted itself to the business of politics, and, united by stronger\r\nbonds than can ever be forged of gold alone, soon entered into\r\npossession of the government, which it retained and used for its own\r\ninterests, without regard to the interests or the rights of the North,\r\nfor nearly three quarters of a century. Mr. Madison had no prescience of\r\nany such future in the history of the country, nor, indeed, then had\r\nanybody else. He may have really believed that the holders of a large\r\npublic debt and the owners of a great national bank, through which the\r\nmonetary affairs of the country could be controlled, were aiming to lay\r\nhold of the government. If all this were true, imminent peril was\r\nimpending over republican institutions. The inconsistency of which\r\nHamilton accused Madison was therefore not necessarily a crime. It\r\nmight even be a virtue, and Madison be applauded for his courage in\r\navowing a change of opinion, if he saw in the practical application of\r\nHamilton's principles dangers that had not occurred to him when looking\r\nat them only as abstract theories. But the Federalists believed that\r\nMadison, governed by these purely selfish motives, sacrificed his\r\nconvictions of what was best for the country that he might secure for\r\nhimself a position on what he foresaw was the winning side. It is quite\r\nlikely that the more pronounced enmity he showed towards Hamilton during\r\nthe second session of Congress was due in some measure to his knowledge\r\nof this feeling towards himself among Federalists. He seemed, at any\r\nrate, to be animated by something more than the proverbial zeal of the\r\nnew convert. If it was not always shown in debate, it lurked in his\r\nletters. Anything that came from the secretary, or anything that favored\r\nthe secretary's measures, was sure to be opposed by him. He was not, of\r\ncourse, always in the wrong, and sometimes he was very right. There was\r\na manifest disposition on the part of the Federalists in the House to\r\ndefer to the secretary in a way to provoke opposition from those who did\r\nnot share in their estimate of his great ability. There was some\r\nresentment, for example, when it was proposed that Congress should\r\nsubmit to the secretary the question of ways and means to carry on the\r\nIndian war at the West, after St. Clair's disastrous defeat, and when, a\r\nfew days later, it was suggested that he should be called upon to\r\nreport a plan for the reduction of the public debt. Members, chief among\r\nthem Madison, thought that they were quite capable of discharging the\r\nduties belonging to their branch of the government without instructions\r\nfrom a head of department whom many of them looked upon as only an\r\nofficial subordinate of Congress. For the same reason they refused with\r\nprompt decision to permit the secretary to appear upon the floor of the\r\nHouse to explain some proposed measure. In the Carrington letter\r\nHamilton said that he had \"openly declared\" a \"determination to treat\r\nhim [Madison] as a political enemy.\" He probably took care that Madison\r\nshould hear of it, for he was not a man who made idle threats. He was\r\nsometimes arrogant and overbearing in manner, was always ready for a\r\nfight, which he rather preferred to quietude, and had little disposition\r\nto spare an enemy. These were not conciliating qualities likely to\r\ntemper the asperities of political warfare, and they may have provoked\r\neven Madison, mild-mannered and almost timid as he was, to unusual heat.\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, is aside from the question whether the party, to\r\nwhich Mr. Madison had given his allegiance, was right or wrong. On that\r\npoint there may be an honest difference of opinion. It is apart also\r\nfrom the question whether a man may not honestly change sides in\r\npolitics, notwithstanding the suspicion that always follows him who runs\r\nfrom one side to the other, when in neither has there been any change\r\nin principles or measures. It is quite possible that he may be governed\r\nby the most sincere convictions; and if he obeys them and abandons old\r\nfriends for new ones, or consents to be friendless, it is the strongest\r\nproof the statesman or politician can give of a moral courage which\r\nought to gain for him all the more respect. But whether that respect\r\nmust be denied to Mr. Madison, because he was governed by other and\r\nlower motives, is the question. There had been no change of political\r\nprinciples either in the party he had left or the party he had joined;\r\nbut each was striving with all its might to adapt the old doctrines to\r\nthe altered condition of affairs under the new Union. The change was\r\nwholly in Mr. Madison. That which had been white to him was now black;\r\nthat which had been black was now as the driven snow. Why was this? Had\r\nhe come to see that in all those years he had been wrong? Or had he\r\nsuddenly learned, not that he was wrong, but that he had mistaken a\r\nstraight and narrow path for the broad road which would lead to the goal\r\nhe was seeking? These are not pleasant questions. He had served his\r\ncountry well; one does not like to doubt whether it was with a selfish\r\nrather than a noble purpose. But of any public man who changed front as\r\nhe changed, the question always will be, What moved him? Not to ask it\r\nin regard to Madison is to drop out of sight the turning-point of his\r\ncareer; not to consider it is to leave unheeded essential light upon\r\none side of his character. For his own fortunes the choice he made was\r\njudicious, if to \"gain the whole world\" is always the wisest and best\r\nthing to do. He gained his world, and was wise and virtuous in his\r\ngeneration according to the vote of a large majority. Whether that\r\ndecision still holds good it is not so easy to say; probably it does,\r\nhowever; for the popular estimate of men often remains unchanged long\r\nafter the judgment upon the events which gave them celebrity is\r\ncompletely reversed. But history, in the long run, weighs with even\r\nscales; and the verdict on Madison's character usually comes with that\r\npitiful recommendation to mercy from a jury loath to condemn. Admiration\r\nfor his great services in the Constitutional Convention and after it,\r\nwhen its work was presented to the people for their approval, has never\r\nbeen withheld; upon his official integrity and his high sense of honor\r\nin all his personal relations, except when obligation to party may have\r\novershadowed it, there rests no cloud; and his intellectual power is\r\nnever questioned. One having these recognized qualities, and who for\r\nfive and twenty years was generally high in office, must needs be held\r\nin high estimation, especially in a new country where fame, like\r\neverything else, is cheap. Nevertheless, impartial historians, who\r\nventure to believe that nature admits of imperfections in a native of\r\nVirginia, declare their conviction that Mr. Madison either wanted the\r\nstrength and courage to resist the influence of those about him, or that\r\nthe ambition of the politician was strong enough to overcome any\r\nconsideration of principles that might stand in his way.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: \"I reverence the Constitution,\" said Fisher Ames in\r\ndebate, \"and I readily admit that the frequent appeal to that as a\r\nstandard proceeds from a respectful attachment to it. So far it is a\r\nsource of agreeable reflection. But I feel very different emotions when\r\nI find it almost daily resorted to in questions of little importance.\r\nWhen by strained and fanciful constructions it is made an instrument of\r\ncasuistry, it is to be feared it may lose something in our minds in\r\npoint of certainty, and more in point of dignity.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFRENCH POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any proof were wanting of how completely Madison had gone over to the\r\nopposition, he gave it in the memorable attack upon the secretary of the\r\ntreasury in the spring of 1793, within four days of the close of the\r\nsecond session of the Second Congress. It was hoped by that proceeding\r\nto overwhelm Hamilton with disgrace, and that the President would feel\r\nhimself obliged to expel him from the cabinet. When the resolutions with\r\nthis aim were offered, a member said that delicacy, decency, and every\r\nrule of justice had been violated; \"a more unhandsome proceeding he had\r\nnever seen in Congress;\" he might have remained a member to this day,\r\nand, save for the attempts in our time to expel John Quincy Adams and\r\nJoshua R. Giddings, not have changed his opinion.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the preceding year Hamilton, under various signatures,\r\nhad met his opponents in the newspapers. But it was a veil, not a visor,\r\nbehind which he fought; for everybody knew from whom came the vigorous\r\nblows that he dealt about him right and left. It was a boast always of\r\nJefferson that he never condescended to newspaper controversy; but it\r\nwas pretty well understood that he himself did not enter upon that\r\nrather unsatisfactory mode of warfare because he preferred the safer\r\nmethod of fighting by proxy. Hamilton never was in doubt as to who was\r\nhis real antagonist, and he aimed his blows over the heads of his petty\r\nassailants to where he knew they would hit home. They left bad bruises\r\nupon his colleague in the cabinet. Among other papers of the time,\r\nthough not a newspaper article, was an official letter to the President,\r\nin which Hamilton defended his principles and his measures. Early in\r\n1792 the President, longing to escape the toils of public life and to\r\nspend the rest of his days in tranquillity, had consulted Madison and\r\nhis two secretaries, Jefferson and Hamilton, upon the propriety of his\r\ndeclining a reëlection. He soon changed his mind, influenced, perhaps,\r\nas much by the dissensions, so evident in the expostulations of his\r\nfriends, as by the expostulations themselves. He deprecated this open\r\nfeud between his secretaries as a public misfortune, and sought, if he\r\ncould not reconcile them, to silence it. That the Federalists were\r\nmonarchists, as Jefferson and Madison never ceased asserting, he knew\r\nwas not true, without the emphatic and indignant declarations of\r\nHamilton, Adams, and other leading men of that party, when they\r\ncondescended to notice a charge which they deemed so absurd that it was\r\ndifficult to believe that anybody could make it in earnest. But, while\r\nhe knew there was no real danger from that quarter, he could not fail\r\nto see that the reverence and love in which he was held constituted a\r\nbond of unity, so long as he remained chief magistrate; and he may have\r\nfelt that, should he retire, there was no other common tie strong enough\r\nat that moment to hold together a Union, the possible dissolution of\r\nwhich was, both at the North and at the South, considered with calmness,\r\nsometimes with complacency, and, when party passion was at a red heat,\r\neven as a thing to be prayed for. At any rate, the President consented\r\nto take the advice of the counselors whom he had consulted; but in\r\nasking that advice he unwittingly aggravated the quarrel among them\r\nwhich caused him so much uneasiness.\r\n\r\nJefferson, in the arguments he set forth both in conversation and by\r\nletter to influence Washington's decision, dwelt upon the unhappy\r\ncondition of public affairs. It was a storm which he himself meant to\r\nget out of by retiring to Monticello, though he thought it was\r\nWashington's duty to remain at the helm and keep an eye to windward.\r\nThis unhappy condition of affairs, he said, had all come from the course\r\npursued by the secretary of the treasury, and was the natural\r\nconsequence of the acts of Congress in relation to the public debt, the\r\nBank, excise, currency, and other important measures passed in\r\naccordance with the secretary's policy. Whether this policy was meant to\r\ndestroy the Union, subvert the republic, and establish a monarchy upon\r\nits ruins, at any rate such must be the inevitable result of those\r\nmischievous measures. He urged this view of the subject with such\r\npertinacity that Washington, either because he was impressed by so much\r\nearnestness, or because he was curious to know how the assertions could\r\nbest be answered, sent them to Hamilton, with other objections of a\r\nsimilar character from other persons, and asked for a reply. No names\r\nwere given, but it is not likely that Hamilton was at any loss in\r\nguessing where such strictures upon his administration of affairs came\r\nfrom. \"I have not fortitude enough,\" he said in his answer, \"always to\r\nhear with calmness calumnies which necessarily include me as a principal\r\nobject in the measures censured, of the falsehood of which I have the\r\nmost unqualified consciousness.... I acknowledge that I cannot be\r\nentirely patient under charges which impeach the integrity of my public\r\nmotives or conduct. I feel that I merit them in no degree, and\r\nexpressions of indignation sometimes escape me in spite of every effort\r\nto suppress them.\" There were only two men in the country whom he could\r\nhave had in mind when he wrote such words as these. In all Washington's\r\ncareer there is nowhere a stronger proof of his strong will,\r\nself-reliance, and passionless impartiality than that he could stand\r\nbetween two such furnaces as Hamilton on one side and Jefferson and\r\nMadison on the other, both glowing at the intensest white heat, while he\r\nremained usually as calm and as unmoved as if breathing the softest,\r\nbalmiest, and gentlest airs of a day in June. But all this personal\r\ncontroversy in the public prints, and in the official intercourse of the\r\ncabinet, left on both sides an intense exasperation, which could not\r\nfail to have a controlling influence in the conduct of political\r\nparties. Whether Jefferson was conscious or not--and whatever his\r\nfeeling was, Madison shared it with him--that in this paper warfare he\r\nwas signally defeated, the attempt to ruin Hamilton by an attack upon\r\nhim in Congress followed, if it was not the consequence of, the\r\nmortification of defeat.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1793, Mr. Giles, a representative from Virginia, offered a\r\nseries of resolutions calling upon the President for certain information\r\nrelating to the finances. They were a bold attack upon the secretary of\r\nthe treasury, and, should it prove that they could not be satisfactorily\r\nanswered, would convict him of mismanagement of the financial affairs of\r\nthe government, of a disregard of law, of usurpation of power, and even\r\nof embezzlement of the public funds. Any reasonable ground for believing\r\nsuch charges to be well-founded would be quite sufficient to bring the\r\nsecretary to trial by impeachment. There was probably little doubt at\r\nthe moment as to whence this blow came; for though the hand might seem\r\nthe hand of Esau, the voice was the voice of Jacob. Behind Giles was\r\nMadison; and behind Madison, of course, was Jefferson. Mr. John C.\r\nHamilton, in his \"History of the Republic,\" asserts that the resolutions\r\nwere still--when he wrote, twenty-five years ago--in the archives of\r\nthe State Department at Washington, in Madison's handwriting; and he\r\nfurther declares that Giles assured Rufus King that Madison was their\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nHamilton's reply, so far as any intentional wrong-doing was imputed to\r\nhim, was conclusive. There had been technical violations of acts of\r\nCongress in one instance, but it was only to carry out the acts\r\nthemselves. Congress had, three years before, passed two acts\r\nauthorizing the negotiation of two loans, one for twelve million dollars\r\nfor the discharge of the foreign debt, and another for two million\r\ndollars to be used at home. It had been convenient, and had conduced to\r\nthe success of the negotiation, to offer in Holland to contract a loan\r\nfor fourteen million dollars, without the unnecessary, and to foreigners\r\nprobably the confusing, statement that the authority for borrowing that\r\namount was derived from two separate acts of Congress. It was only in\r\nthis borrowing of the money that there was any seeming disregard of the\r\nletter of the law. The loans and their purposes were kept entirely\r\ndistinct in the accounts of the department. Other questions touching the\r\nmanagement of these loans were so clearly and frankly explained that\r\nnothing but the captiousness of party could refuse to be satisfied. On\r\none point--the charge of an alleged deficit--the opposition was\r\nabsolutely silenced. The secretary indignantly explained that the\r\nsum--as anybody could have known for the asking from any officer in the\r\nTreasury Department--which was made to appear as missing was in credits\r\nfor customs bonds not yet due, and bills of exchange on Europe sold but\r\nnot yet paid for.\r\n\r\nThough there was enough of decency, or of prudence which took the place\r\nof decency, to drop the insinuation that the secretary had stolen what\r\nhad never been in his possession, it was not so with the rest of the\r\naccusations. Only four days before Congress was to adjourn, Giles\r\noffered another set of resolutions. These assumed that the defiance of\r\nlaw and unwarranted assumption of power, which, at first, were only\r\nsuggested by the inquiries, were now proved to be true by the\r\nexplanations that had been given. The indictment, therefore, was made to\r\ninclude the verdict and the sentence; the criminal was accused, was to\r\nbe found guilty, and condemned to capital punishment in one proceeding,\r\nwithout the privilege of trial, or a recognition of the right to be\r\nheard. The argument of the resolutions was, that certain acts were a\r\nviolation of law; that the secretary had committed all those acts; and\r\ntherefore it was the will of the House that the facts be reported to the\r\nPresident. The presumption obviously was, that the President would\r\nimmediately dismiss from office a disgraced and faithless public\r\nservant. But the prosecution was an utter failure. The largest vote\r\nreceived for any of the resolutions was only fifteen; that on the others\r\nwas from seven to twelve, in a quorum of from fifty to sixty members.\r\nIn the course of the debate Mr. Madison had said that \"his colleague\r\n[Giles] had rendered a service highly valuable to the legislature, and\r\nno less important and acceptable to the public.\" The House showed by its\r\nvotes how very far it was from agreeing with him. But Fisher Ames wrote\r\nabout that time: \"Madison is become a desperate party leader, and I am\r\nnot sure of his stopping at any ordinary point of extremity.\" If it be\r\nreally true that he instigated this attack upon Hamilton, and was the\r\nauthor of the resolutions, using Giles as his tool to get them before\r\nthe House, Ames's reflection was not uncharitable.\r\n\r\nIt would not be just, however, to leave the impression that the\r\nhostility shown in this affair was purely personal. Both Jefferson and\r\nMadison had a hearty hatred for Hamilton which would have been greatly\r\ngratified could they have made it the plain duty of the President to put\r\nhim out of the Treasury Department a dishonored and ruined man. But this\r\nparticular outbreak of their enmity was intensified by their sincere and\r\nearnest enthusiasm for France. They were quite willing to bring Hamilton\r\nto grief at any time because he was Hamilton; they were more than\r\nordinarily exasperated against him just now because in recent newspaper\r\nand other controversies he had altogether got the better of them; but in\r\nthis particular instance they wanted to punish him because of delay of\r\npayments in discharge of the indebtedness of the United States to\r\nFrance. This was the essential delinquency at which the Giles\r\nresolutions were pointed. The difficulty was, not that the secretary of\r\nthe treasury was not careful enough of the public money, but that he was\r\ntoo careful. He insisted upon being quite certain, when paying off a\r\npublic debt, that he was paying it to the right persons, and that no\r\nrisk should be incurred of its being demanded a second time. He felt\r\nthere was no such certainty about payments to France. The king was\r\ndethroned; but it was not wise, the secretary thought, to be hasty in\r\nrecognizing revolutionary governments. It was a republic to-day; it\r\nmight be a regency to-morrow; a monarchy again the third day. It was\r\nmore prudent to await a reasonable period for the evidence of permanency\r\non one side or the other. Those old enough to remember the late war of\r\nthe rebellion know how important the maintenance of this doctrine was in\r\nregard to the recognition of the rebel confederacy by England and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBut to all this Jefferson did not in the least agree; neither did\r\nMadison. They were in full, even passionate, sympathy with the men who\r\nbrought Louis XVI. to the guillotine. Money, they knew, was needed, and\r\nit was a crime against liberty to delay payment when payment was due to\r\nthe French government. With Hamilton the question was, not whether the\r\nrevolutionists ought to be, but whether they were, France. With\r\nJefferson and Madison they were France, because they ought to be.\r\nHesitation to acknowledge that the Revolution was the nation, they\r\nthought, could only come from an \"Anglican party,\" the \"enemies of\r\nFrance and of Liberty,\" who would lead the American people \"into the\r\narms and ultimately into the government of Great Britain,\"--to use the\r\nterms in which Madison spoke, a little later, of the Federalists. Which\r\nof these men, in this regard at least, were the thoughtful and prudent\r\nstatesmen, and which were _doctrinaires_, nobody now, probably,\r\nquestions. The larger proportion of the people, however, were then\r\ncarried away by the enthusiasm for the French revolutionists. It was so,\r\nno doubt, at first without much distinction of party; but it was\r\ninevitable, when the government should be called upon to take some\r\ndecisive stand in relation to European politics, that the country should\r\ndivide into two hostile camps; or, rather, that the two camps already\r\nexisting should become more hostile to each other than ever. It is not\r\nnecessary to assume that the mass of the people gave themselves up to\r\nany very hard thinking about the matter. For the most part they\r\nfollowed, as the way is with parties, the political leaders to whom they\r\nwere already accustomed, never doubting that not to do so would be\r\ntreacherous to the gratitude America owed to France, and to the cause of\r\nliberty and democracy, which, in the hands of the Frenchmen, was\r\nhurling monarchs from their thrones--at least one monarch from his, and\r\nmore, it was hoped, would follow. But when the revolution ran into the\r\nterrible excesses of a later stage, if any Federalists had wavered in\r\ntheir allegiance to their chiefs they soon returned, persuaded that the\r\nwild and bloody anarchy of Paris was not the road that led to the\r\nestablishment of a wise and safe popular government.\r\n\r\nThere was no need now of pretexts for quarreling; real causes came fast\r\nenough. France declared war against England, and the United States had\r\nits part to play in this strife of giants. Its real interest was to keep\r\nout of trouble; and, if all were agreed on that point, it does not seem\r\nthat there should have been much difficulty in saying so. \"It behooves\r\nthe government of this country,\" wrote Washington to Hamilton, \"to use\r\nevery means in its power to prevent the citizens thereof from embroiling\r\nus with either of those powers, by endeavoring to maintain a strict\r\nneutrality.\" It is difficult to conceive of a man being sincerely\r\ndesirous of helping neither one side nor the other; of injuring neither\r\none side nor the other; of maintaining, so far as help or harm could go,\r\nan attitude of absolute impartiality towards both,--it is difficult to\r\nconceive of such a man quarreling with the word \"neutrality\" as applied\r\nto his position. But Jefferson, nevertheless, quarreled with it; not\r\nfrankly and directly as a thing he did not want, but captiously and\r\nhypercritically objecting to the word to cover his dislike to the thing\r\nitself. \"A declaration of neutrality,\" he said, \"was a declaration that\r\nthere should be no war, to which the Executive was not competent.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true that the Executive was not competent to declare that there\r\nshould be no war; it was not true that the use of the word \"neutrality\"\r\ncould have any such application to the future as to prevent Congress,\r\nwhen it should assemble, from declaring war should it see fit to do so.\r\nBut meanwhile, Congress not being in session, and no exigency having\r\narisen that made it desirable in the President's judgment to call an\r\nextra session, he, with the assent of the cabinet,--for Jefferson did\r\nnot venture upon direct opposition,--issued a proclamation \"to exhort\r\nand warn the citizens of the United States carefully to avoid all acts\r\nand proceedings whatsoever\" that might interfere with \"the duty and\r\ninterest of the United States\" to \"adopt and pursue a conduct friendly\r\nand impartial towards the belligerent powers.\" The objectionable word\r\nwas left out in deference to Mr. Jefferson, who, really preferring that\r\nthere should be no proclamation at all, hoped to take the sting out of\r\nit by the omission of a phrase. It was the thing said, not the way of\r\nsaying it, that the President insisted upon, as it was his duty to\r\npreserve the peace till the legislature should declare for war, and his\r\ninclination to preserve it altogether.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that Jefferson and his friends saw as plainly\r\nas the other party saw how perilous to the interests of the United\r\nStates a foreign war would probably be. But, while professing a desire\r\nto avoid it, they were far more anxious, apparently, to give aid, moral\r\nas well as material, to France, with whose revolutionary struggles they\r\nsympathized so deeply, than they were to avoid offense to England, whom\r\nthey hated and would gladly see crippled. Not to be an enemy of England\r\nthey held was to be an enemy of France; and not of France merely, but of\r\nthe \"rights of man.\" They could not or would not comprehend any wisdom\r\nin moderation, any prudence in delay. It is curious to see how party\r\nanimosity blinded even the best of them. The objection to the word\r\n\"neutrality\" was a mere quibble; for the proclamation called upon all\r\ngood citizens to maintain at their peril that state which, in all\r\ndictionaries, neutrality is defined to be. Mr. Jefferson, in instructing\r\nas secretary of state the American ministers abroad as to the attitude\r\nassumed by the government, could find no better term than \"a fair\r\nneutrality.\" The fact was, the Republican leaders wished to avoid taking\r\nany positive stand, partly because delay might be a help to France, and\r\npartly in obedience to the law of party politics, in opposition to the\r\nother side. They were not at first quite sure of their ground, and\r\nwanted to gain time. Mr. Madison seems to have waited about six weeks\r\nbefore he could venture upon a positive opinion as to the proclamation.\r\nThe newspapers helped him to a knowledge of party opinion, and party\r\nopinion helped him to make up his own. \"Every 'Gazette' I see,\"--he\r\nwrote in June, about eight weeks after the proclamation was\r\npublished,--\"every 'Gazette' I see (except that of the United States\r\n[Federalist]) exhibits a spirit of criticism on the Anglified complexion\r\ncharged on the Executive politics.... The proclamation was, in truth, a\r\nmost unfortunate error.\" A week before, he had been seemingly cautious\r\neven in writing to Jefferson. Then he had observed that newspaper\r\ncriticisms aroused attention, and he had heard expressions of surprise\r\n\"that the President should have declared the United States to be neutral\r\nin the unqualified terms used, when we were so notoriously and\r\nunequivocally under eventual engagements to defend the American\r\npossessions of France. I have heard it remarked, also, that the\r\nimpartiality enjoined on the people was as little reconcilable with\r\ntheir moral obligations as the unconditional neutrality proclaimed by\r\nthe government is with the express articles of the treaty.\" He adds: \"I\r\nhave been mortified that on these points I could offer no _bona fide_\r\nexplanations that might be satisfactory.\" He was not in doubt long,\r\nhowever. Mr. Jefferson sent him within two or three weeks a series of\r\npapers by Hamilton, under the signature of \"Pacificus,\" in defense of\r\nthe proclamation, and urged him to reply. This Madison undertook to do\r\nat once, and in five papers, under the signature of \"Helvidius,\" he\r\ntook up all the points in dispute.\r\n\r\nThe question relating to treaty obligations was the more serious. By the\r\ntreaty of 1778 the United States had guaranteed \"to his Most Christian\r\nMajesty the present possessions of the Crown of France in America.\" An\r\nattempt on the part of Great Britain to take any of the French West\r\nIndia Islands would involve the United States in the war. How, then, Mr.\r\nMadison's friends might well ask, as in the letter just quoted he said\r\nthey did, could \"the President declare the United States to be neutral\r\nin the unqualified terms used, when we were so notoriously and\r\nunequivocally under eventual engagements to defend the American\r\npossessions of France\"? Hamilton's ground was that the treaty, by its\r\nterms, was \"a defensive alliance,\" and therefore not binding in this\r\ncase, inasmuch as the present war against England was offensive; and\r\nthat, besides, the treaty was in suspension, as France herself was, in a\r\nsense, in suspension, having only a provisional government, the\r\npermanent and legitimate successor to which was uncertain. But an\r\nimportant point was gained, it was thought, in the decision to receive\r\nGenet as the French minister. Hamilton, still acting in accordance with\r\nthat cautious policy which he thought to be, in such a crisis, the most\r\njudicious, questioned whether a minister from the provisional government\r\nin Paris should be recognized without reservations. Such an ambassador\r\nmight be followed presently by another accredited by a new power in the\r\nrevolutionary progress. This would, at the least, be an awkward dilemma\r\nnot to be recovered from without the loss of some dignity by the\r\ngovernment of the United States. But this point also was yielded in\r\ndeference to Jefferson, and much to his mortification the concession\r\nturned out to be before he was many weeks older.\r\n\r\n\"I anxiously wish,\" Madison wrote to Jefferson, \"that the reception of\r\nGenet may testify what I believe to be the real affections of the\r\npeople.\" He was amply gratified. From Charleston, where he landed, to\r\nPhiladelphia, Genet was received with the warmest enthusiasm by all who\r\nsympathized with France, and by that larger number among Americans who\r\nare always ready to hurrah for anything or anybody that has caught the\r\npopular fancy. Madison watched his progress with great interest, and\r\napparently with some misgivings. Writing again a few days later to\r\nJefferson, he says that \"the fiscal party in Alexandria was an overmatch\r\nfor those who wished to testify the American sentiment.\" Indeed, he\r\nthinks it certain, he says in the same letter, \"that Genet will be\r\nmisled if he takes either the fashionable cant of the cities or the cold\r\ncaution of the government for the sense of the public,\"--falling\r\nhimself, before he reaches the end of the sentence, into the cant of\r\nassuming neutrality in the government to be only a \"mask\" behind which\r\nto hide its \"secret Anglomany.\" But he was quite mistaken in supposing\r\nthat Genet was likely to be misled, or led at all, by anybody. He was\r\nalmost capable, as General Knox said, of declaring the United States a\r\ndepartment of France, and of levying troops here to reduce the Americans\r\nto obedience. The man's conduct, if it had not been so outrageous, would\r\nhave been ludicrous in its assumption of power, its disregard of the\r\nlaws of the country, and its defiance of the government. Within three\r\nmonths of his arrival Jefferson himself was constrained to acknowledge\r\nthat he had developed \"a character and conduct so unexpected and so\r\nextraordinary as to place us in the most distressing dilemma, between\r\nour regard for his nation, which is constant and sincere, and a regard\r\nfor our laws, the authority of which must be maintained; for the peace\r\nof our country, which the executive magistrate is charged to preserve;\r\nfor its honor, offended in the person of that magistrate; and for its\r\ncharacter, grossly traduced in the conversations and letters of this\r\ngentleman.\" Though this was in an official letter, it gave, no doubt,\r\nJefferson's real opinion; for no man had more reason than he for\r\nresenting the conduct of the irrepressible Frenchman. Jefferson has been\r\naccused of too much familiarity with the French minister in private, and\r\nof tardiness in the discharge of his own duty as secretary where it was\r\nlikely to clash with the other's schemes. Genet himself complained that\r\nhe was thrown over by Jefferson after receiving from him every\r\nencouragement. This is, of course, true, but not in the least\r\ndiscreditable to Jefferson. When Genet arrived in Philadelphia, he was,\r\nalthough he had already committed some illegal acts in Charleston,\r\nprofuse in his promises of good behavior. The secretary of state had\r\nwelcomed him as the representative of France and the Revolution, and\r\nnaturally he meant to make the most he could out of him, for the sake of\r\nthe Republican party, as well as for the sake of the sacred cause of\r\n\"liberty, equality, and fraternity.\" But he soon saw that he was dealing\r\nwith one who was a cross between a mountebank and a madman, as we learn\r\nfrom a letter of Madison to Jefferson, written within two months of\r\nJefferson's first interview with Genet. \"Your account of Genet,\" says\r\nthe letter, \"is dreadful. He must be brought right if possible. His\r\nfolly will otherwise do mischief which no wisdom can repair.\"\r\n\r\nThe mischief dreaded was that the administration party would take\r\nadvantage of the insolent and outrageous conduct of the French minister\r\nto show the folly of precipitancy, and to gain popularity and strength\r\nfor itself. Madison soon writes to Jefferson to acquaint him with the\r\nreaction taking place in Virginia, \"in the surprise and disgust of those\r\nwho are attached to the French cause, and who viewed this minister as\r\nthe instrument for cementing, instead of alienating, the two republics.\"\r\nHe asserts that \"the Anglican party is busy, as you may suppose, in\r\nmaking the worst of everything, and in turning the public feelings\r\nagainst France and thence in favor of England.\" In a sense this must\r\nhave been true. The \"fiscals,\" the \"Anglomanys,\" the \"Anglican party,\"\r\nthe \"monarchists,\"--which were Mr. Madison's pet names for his old\r\nfriends,--were good enough politicians to take great satisfaction in\r\nkeeping well stirred and in lively use the muddy waters into which their\r\nopponents had floundered. They were not, probably, careful always to\r\nremember that France was neither the better nor worse, neither the wiser\r\nnor the less wise, because one of the mad fanatics, bred of the\r\nRevolution, had found his way, unfortunately, to the United States as a\r\nminister plenipotentiary. But, on the other hand, it was not true that\r\nthere was any \"Anglican party,\" in the sense in which Madison used the\r\nterm,--a party led by men who were \"the enemies of France and of\r\nliberty, at work to lead the well-meaning from their honorable\r\nconnection with those [the French people] into the arms and ultimately\r\ninto the government of Great Britain.\" Washington said that he did not\r\nbelieve there were ten men in the United States, whose opinions deserved\r\nany respect, who would change the form of government to a monarchy. But\r\nif there were only ten men in the country whose opinions, in the\r\nestimate of Jefferson and Madison, were not worth much, Washington was\r\namong them. The affection and reverence, with which he was regarded by\r\nthe people, they would have been glad to appeal to on behalf of their\r\nown party; but it is easy to read between the lines in Jefferson's\r\n\"Ana,\" and in his and Madison's correspondence, that they looked upon\r\nthe President as the dupe of his secretary of the treasury. Not that\r\nthey were ever wanting in terms of respect and even of veneration for\r\nthe President, but the tone was often one of pitiful regret almost akin\r\nto contempt.\r\n\r\n\"I am extremely afraid,\" Madison wrote to Jefferson, \"that the President\r\nmay not be sufficiently aware of the snares that may be laid for his\r\ngood intentions by men whose politics at bottom are very different from\r\nhis own.\" Again he says, a few days later: \"I regret extremely the\r\nposition into which the President has been thrown. The unpopular cause\r\nof Anglomany is openly laying claim to him. His enemies, masking\r\nthemselves under the popular cause of France, are playing off the most\r\ntremendous batteries on him.... It is mortifying to the real friends of\r\nthe President that his fame and his influence should have anything to\r\napprehend from the success of liberty in another country, since he owes\r\nhis preëminence to the success of it in his own. If France triumphs, the\r\nill-fated proclamation will be a millstone, which would sink any other\r\ncharacter and will force a struggle even on his.\" Yet it is certain that\r\nWashington was not in the least doubt as to his own political\r\nprinciples; that he was never in danger of being inveigled into the\r\nbetrayal of those principles, whatever they might be; and that he was\r\nquite capable of due care for his own reputation.\r\n\r\nIf Madison did not know that these tears over Washington, if sincere,\r\nwere quite uncalled for, Jefferson was not in the least deceived. He\r\nrecords in his \"Ana\" that the President, referring to certain articles\r\nthat had recently appeared in Freneau's \"Gazette,\" said that \"he\r\nconsidered those papers as attacking him [Washington] directly; for he\r\nmust be a fool indeed to swallow the little sugar-plums here and there\r\nthrown out to him; that in condemning the administration of the\r\ngovernment they condemned him, for if they thought there were measures\r\npursued contrary to his sentiments, they must conceive him too careless\r\nto attend to them, or too stupid to understand them.\" Again, some months\r\nlater, the President, alluding to another article in Freneau's\r\npaper,--that \"rascal Freneau,\" as he called him,--said \"that he despised\r\nall their attacks on him personally, but there never had been an act of\r\nthe government--not meaning in the executive line only, but in any\r\nline--which that paper had not abused. He was evidently sore and warm,\"\r\ncontinues the candid secretary, \"and I took his intention to be, that I\r\nshould interpose in some way with Freneau, perhaps withdraw his\r\nappointment of translating clerk in my office. But I will not do it.\"\r\n\r\nThese frank and indignant avowals of feeling and opinion were not, if we\r\nmay believe Jefferson, unusual with Washington, even in cabinet\r\nmeetings; and it seems hardly likely that Madison, who was on the most\r\nfriendly and intimate terms with the President, could have been so\r\nignorant of how he felt and thought as to suppose him the mere dupe of\r\ndesigning men. The truth is, probably, that Madison did not, any more\r\nthan Jefferson, believe this. It was only a bit of party tactics to\r\nassume, lest the President should have too much influence over the minds\r\nof the people, that, in the hands of the wicked \"Anglicists,\" he was as\r\nclay in the hands of the potter. The two friends, whether in writing or\r\nby speech they lamented and excused the unhappy position, as they were\r\npleased to call it, of the President, must have appeared to each other\r\nlike the Roman augurs in Gérôme's picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHIS LATEST YEARS IN CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nGenet was at last got rid of, but the evil that he did lived after him.\r\nHis presence had provoked an outbreak, to some degree, of the phenomena\r\nof the French Revolution, which, however significant they might be in\r\nthe upheaval of an old monarchical despotism, were an unwholesome growth\r\namong a simple people, where one man was as good as another before the\r\nlaw; where, from the first settlement of the country, all had largely\r\npossessed the advantages of a popular government; and where any other\r\nthan a republican government for the future was wellnigh impossible. For\r\nmen to address each other as \"citizen,\" as if the word had the new\r\nsignificance in America that it had just gained in France; to swear\r\neternal fidelity to liberty, equality, and fraternity, as if these were\r\nlately discovered rights which had been denied the common people for\r\ncenturies by kings and nobles, who had always lived in the next street\r\nin inconceivable luxury wrung from the blood and sweat of the poor; to\r\nform Jacobin clubs pledged to the suppression of the tyranny of\r\naristocrats in a country where, as Samuel Dexter said of New England,\r\nthere was hardly a man rich enough to own a carriage, and few so poor as\r\nnot to own a horse; for men thus to ape those revolutionary ways, which\r\nmeant so much in Paris, may have seemed at the moment, to sober-minded\r\npeople, more fantastic than harmful. It was harmful, however, insomuch\r\nas it substituted sentiment for common sense, and made enthusiasm, not\r\nreason, the guide of conduct. A character was given to political\r\nconflict which obtained for years to come. There was, it is true, a\r\ncertain manliness about it in remarkable contrast with that maudlin\r\nsentimentality of our time which is rather inclined to ask pardon of the\r\nrebels of the late civil war for having put them to the trouble of\r\ngetting up a rebellion. It was a conflict, nevertheless, more of party\r\npassion than of principle, wherein it is impossible to see that either\r\nparty was absolutely right, or either absolutely wrong. The Francomania\r\nphase of it disappeared for a time in John Adams's administration; but\r\nit revived again, and gave intensity and virulence to the political\r\nstruggles, in the first decade of this century. Then it was that men\r\nwent about their daily affairs with cockades on their hats as\r\ndistinctive party badges. In their social as well as in their business\r\nrelations they were governed by party affinities. Neighbors differing in\r\npolitics would hardly speak to each other, and each was always ready to\r\naccept the other's political crookedness as the measure of his possible\r\ndepravity in everything else. They would hardly walk on the same side\r\nof the street; or sail in the same packet; or ride in the same\r\nstage-coach; or buy their groceries at the same shop; or listen to the\r\npreaching of the gospel from the same pulpit; indeed, if the preacher\r\nwas known to have pronounced political opinions, he was held, by those\r\nwho did not agree with him, as one from whose shoulders the clerical\r\ngown should be torn.\r\n\r\nGratitude to France had not yet even become traditional, and it was\r\nintensified by the deepest sympathy for a people struggling for what, by\r\ntheir aid, Americans had so recently gained. Added to this was the old\r\nhatred to England, which England as carefully nursed as if it were her\r\nsettled policy, by exciting Indian hostilities on the borders, by\r\noutrages on the high seas, and by an interference with American\r\ncommerce, exercised with as little consideration of the rights of an\r\nindependent nation as if the States were still colonies in revolt. Never\r\ndid a party find, ready made and close at hand, so many elements of\r\npopularity; and these being appealed to as Genet appealed to them, it\r\nwas easy to set the country in a blaze. When the administration was\r\ndetermined that he should be recalled, and the Republican leaders were\r\nanxious to get rid of him, as they could not restrain him, Jefferson\r\nopposed, in a meeting of the cabinet, the proposition to ask for his\r\nrecall, lest such popular indignation should be aroused as would enable\r\nthe French minister to defy the government itself. The seed sowed by\r\nsuch a man, on such a soil, bore fruit a thousand fold for almost a\r\ngeneration. It is not to be wondered at that the Federalists could not\r\nlong hold their own against a party that did not ask the people to\r\nthink, but bade them only to remember--much, indeed, that ought to be\r\nremembered--and to feel. That is always so much easier to do than the\r\nother, and it is always so much easier to appeal effectually to\r\nsentiment than to reflection, that the wonder rather is that the\r\nFederalists could hold their own so long as they did. All things were\r\nagainst them but one. Washington, though altogether above any partisan\r\nbias, as he believed to be the imperative duty of the chief magistrate\r\nof the nation, conducted his administration by the principles which\r\ndistinguished the Federalists. He was neither, as he intimated to\r\nJefferson, so careless as not to know what was done, nor such a fool as\r\nnot to understand why it was done; and so greatly was he revered for his\r\nexalted character, so universal was the confidence in his integrity,\r\nsagacity, and sound judgment, that, so long as he remained President,\r\nthe party that surrounded him was immovable as a mountain. His policy\r\nwas to stave off a rupture with England, and, if possible, to bring that\r\npower into pacific and rational relations with the United States. The\r\ngovernment aimed to keep itself clear of entanglement with all foreign\r\npolitics; to maintain that perfect neutrality which should violate no\r\ntreaties, offend no national friendships, provoke no jealousies, and\r\nleave England and France to fight their own battles, content that the\r\nUnited States should be an impartial spectator. Thirty years afterward,\r\nwhen the Federal party had ceased to exist under that title, this was\r\nannounced as the true American policy, and was thenceforth known as \"The\r\nMonroe Doctrine,\" though the merit, even of re-discovery, did not belong\r\nto President Monroe.\r\n\r\nIn nine cases out of ten, perhaps in ninety-nine out of a hundred, the\r\nwisest statesmanship is the knowledge when and how to compromise.\r\nCertainly that was all John Jay, whom the President sent to England to\r\nmake a treaty, could do. The treaty was a bad one; that is, it was not\r\nsuch an one as any President and Senate would have dared to consent to\r\nfor the last sixty years; it was not so good an one as that which Monroe\r\nand Pinkney negotiated ten years later, and which President Jefferson,\r\nlest it should help England and hurt France, then quietly locked up in\r\nhis desk without permitting the Senate even to know of its existence;\r\nnor was it so bad as the treaty of peace made with England in 1814. But\r\nit was undoubtedly the best that could be done at the time. The question\r\nwas between it and nothing; and the best its warmest defenders could say\r\nwas that it was better than nothing. No treaty meant war; and war at\r\nthat moment with England meant ruin. At least so the Federalists\r\nthought, and, so far as human foresight could go, they were probably\r\nright.\r\n\r\nBut never was a treaty more unpopular than this, when its provisions\r\ncame to be understood. The government, in delaying to make it public,\r\nseemed to fear for its reception, and by that hesitation helped to raise\r\nthe very doubts it was afraid of. But when it was published the whole\r\nSouth was aroused as one man on finding that the payment for fugitive\r\nslaves, who during the war of the Revolution had sought refuge with the\r\nBritish army, was not provided for. Other concessions made to England\r\nwere, in other parts of the country, deemed not less humiliating and\r\ninjurious to the national honor than this refusal to pay for runaway\r\nnegroes. Also, there was a one-sided stipulation relating to commerce in\r\nthe West Indies, so injurious to American interests that the President\r\nand Senate, rather than ratify it, determined to reject the whole treaty\r\nand take the consequences. There was hardly a town of any note that did\r\nnot hold its indignation meeting. Jay was burned in effigy, or the\r\nattempt was made so to express the public disapprobation, in more than\r\none of the larger towns. Hamilton, when at a public meeting in New York\r\nhe tried to explain and defend the treaty, was stoned and compelled to\r\nretire. If the more violent opponents of the administration were to be\r\nbelieved, its members, from the President down, and all the leading men\r\nof the party supporting it, were bought by \"British gold,\" or were ready\r\nwithout being bought, but from pure original depravity, to betray their\r\nown country and help to destroy France. The name of the ingenious\r\ninventor of the argument of \"British gold,\" then used for the first\r\ntime, has unfortunately been lost; but it has stood the test of a\r\nhundred years' usage, and is as startling and conclusive to-day as it\r\nwas a century ago.\r\n\r\nThere soon came, however, the sober second thought which took into\r\nconsideration the circumstances under which the treaty was made, the\r\npossible and even probable consequences of its rejection, as well as the\r\nobjections to the treaty itself. After the first excitement had passed\r\naway, many thought it worth while to read for themselves what hitherto\r\nthey had only reviled at the suggestion of others, or from sympathy with\r\nthe popular clamor. The commercial community, the New York Chamber of\r\nCommerce leading the way, came to the conclusion that their rights and\r\ninterests were reasonably protected; that to be recognized as a neutral\r\nbetween two such belligerent powers as England and France was a great\r\npoint gained; that partial indemnity was better than total loss; and\r\nthat the chance of a fairly profitable trade in the future was\r\npreferable to the ruin of all foreign commerce. It was universally\r\nagreed that peace was better than war; but there was this difference\r\nbetween the two parties: while one maintained that war was not a\r\nnecessary consequence of the rejection of the treaty, the other declared\r\nit must be inevitable, where there were so many points of collision\r\nwhich could only be escaped by mutual agreement. This was especially\r\ntrue on the frontier, where Indian hostilities were sure to follow, and\r\nlead to general war, if the military posts, which should have been given\r\nup at the close of the Revolution, should remain longer in the hands of\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the real question with the Republicans was the influence\r\nwhich a treaty with England might have upon the relations of France and\r\nthe United States. They detested England for her own sake; they detested\r\nher still more for the sake of France. If there had been no question of\r\nFrance in the way they would, perhaps, have been willing, like the\r\nFederalists, to consider the relations of England and the United States\r\non their merits,--to remember that the commerce between them was greater\r\nthan that which the United States had with any other country, the loss\r\nof which might be a disastrous check to her prosperity; that the peoples\r\nof the two countries were, after all, of one blood, and that theirs was\r\na common heritage in the institutions, laws, language, and character\r\nthat distinguished the race; that the quarrel between them was--though\r\nit might be the more bitter on that account--a family quarrel, and ought\r\nfor that reason to be the more speedily settled. But, if England would\r\nnot remember these things,--as she never has to this day,--if, on the\r\ncontrary, she chose to be overbearing, contemptuous, insolent, quite\r\nregardless of American rights,--as she always has been when she could be\r\nso safely,--then it behooved the United States, inasmuch as she was a\r\nyoung and as yet a feeble nation, to conciliate this powerful enemy\r\nwhenever she could do so consistently with her self-respect, to avoid\r\ngiving unnecessary offense or provoking fresh injuries, and, in the mean\r\nwhile, to nurture and husband her strength, to keep an accurate account\r\nof all the wrongs that in her weakness she should be compelled to submit\r\nto, and to bide her time. These were the principles of the Federalists.\r\nTheir aim was, not the good of England, but the good of the United\r\nStates. They were an American party; to them foreign relations were of\r\nimportance mainly for the influence these might have upon the\r\nprosperity, happiness, and power of their own country. They did not\r\nforget the gratitude due to France for the aid she had given to the\r\nstruggling colonies, though that aid was given not so much for love of\r\nAmerica as for hatred of England. The pacific and friendly relations\r\nalready established with France they held in due estimation; and their\r\nsympathies went out to her people in full measure in their struggle for\r\na popular government, so long as that struggle was kept within the\r\nbounds of reason and humanity. But sympathy with and gratitude to France\r\ndid not blind them to the wisdom and expediency of pacific and friendly\r\nrelations with England, provided such could be established without the\r\nsacrifice of their own prosperity, independence, and national pride. It\r\nwas only to add to that prosperity, to gain new security for that\r\nindependence, and to build up a nation of which they and their\r\nchildren, to the latest generation, might well be proud, that they ought\r\nto be on good terms with that powerful state with whom they were\r\nco-heirs in all the ideas and institutions constituting the civilization\r\nthat made her great. They hoped to build up, west of the Atlantic Ocean,\r\n\"an Inglishe Nation\" in its broadest sense, of which Walter Raleigh had\r\nhoped that he might live to see the beginning, and which the latest\r\nhistorical writers in England are just now recognizing as the most\r\nimportant part of the modern empire of the English race.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives was not in session when the Jay treaty was\r\nratified by the President and Senate, but Mr. Madison's letters show\r\nthat he could see in it nothing but evil. In February, 1796, the\r\nratification by both governments was announced to both houses of\r\nCongress, and measures were at once taken by the Republicans in the\r\nlower house to render the treaty, if possible, null and void. A\r\nresolution, warmly supported by Mr. Madison, was offered, calling upon\r\nthe President for copies of the instructions under which Mr. Jay acted,\r\nwith the correspondence and any other papers, proper to be made public,\r\nrelating to the negotiation. The resolution was subjected to a debate of\r\nthree weeks, but was finally passed. The request was refused by the\r\nPresident, on the ground that the treaty-making power was, by the\r\nConstitution, confided to the President and Senate. It was on this point\r\nmainly that the debate had turned; and the President, in support of his\r\nopinion as well as that of the Federalists generally, referred to his\r\nrecollection of the plain intention of the Constitutional Convention,\r\nand to the fact that a proposition, \"that no treaty should be binding on\r\nthe United States which was not ratified by law,\" was \"explicitly\r\nrejected.\" Mr. Madison said a day or two after, that, while he did not\r\ndoubt \"the case to be as stated, he had no recollection of it.\" Of the\r\nmessage itself, he said that it was \"as unexpected as its tone and tenor\r\nare improper and indelicate.\" But Hamilton, he thought, wrote it, and\r\nthe President was, as usual, lamented over for having been taken in. A\r\nresolution, however, was finally passed in favor of the treaty, though\r\nby a majority of three only. The debate upon it was earnest and long,\r\nMr. Madison leading the opposition. His disappointment was bitter. \"The\r\nprogress of this business throughout,\" he wrote to Jefferson, \"has been\r\nto me the most worrying and vexatious that I ever encountered; and the\r\nmore so, as the causes lay in the unsteadiness, the follies, the\r\nperverseness, and the defections among our friends, more than in the\r\nstrength, or dexterity, or malice of our opponents.\"\r\n\r\nThough the Jay treaty was not--as was said on a previous page--such an\r\none as the United States would have acceded to in latter times, the\r\nresult proved it to be a wise and timely measure. Notwithstanding the\r\ndisturbed condition of affairs in Europe, its influence upon the United\r\nStates, and the increasing violence of faction here, the increase for\r\nthe next ten or twelve years of the commerce, and the consequent growth\r\nand prosperity, of the country were greater than the most sanguine\r\nsupporters of the treaty had dared to hope for. Their immediate\r\nexpectations that it might be possible to establish better relations\r\nwith England, without disturbing essentially those existing with France,\r\nwere, however, signally disappointed. Their opponents were wiser; for\r\nthey not only measured accurately the indignation of the French by their\r\nown, but they took good care that it should not languish for want of\r\nencouragement. The French Directory might have been reconciled to the\r\nsituation had it been plain to them that there was neither an\r\n\"Anglicized\" party nor a French party in the United States, but that the\r\npeople were united in the determination to maintain, for their own\r\nprotection, whatever their personal sympathies might be, an absolute\r\nneutrality between the belligerent powers. But as they were assured that\r\ntheir friends in America meant also to be their effectual allies, so\r\nthey believed that those who professed neutrality used it only as a mask\r\nfor friendship to England.\r\n\r\nJames Monroe had been received in Paris as American minister, literally\r\nas well as morally, with open arms, in that memorable scene when, in the\r\npresence and amid the cheers of the National Convention, the president,\r\nMerlin de Douai, imprinted upon his cheeks, in the name of France, the\r\nkiss of fraternity. Till he was recalled in the latter days of\r\nWashington's administration, Monroe was the representative not so much\r\nof the government to which he owed allegiance as of the faction to which\r\nhe belonged at home. He was not, it is true, unmindful of the hundreds\r\nof outrages perpetrated by French naval vessels and privateers upon\r\nAmerican merchantmen; that their crews were thrown into French prisons,\r\nand that the detention of their cargoes had brought ruin upon many\r\nAmerican citizens; nor did he neglect to demand redress. But he seemed\r\nabsolutely incapable of understanding that if there were anything to\r\nchoose between the insults and wrongs which America was compelled to\r\nsubmit to from England and France, it was only in the greater ability of\r\nEngland to inflict them. English ships swept the ocean, and pretexts\r\nwere never wanting for overhauling American vessels, stripping them of\r\nsome of their men, or confiscating both ships and cargoes. France had as\r\nmany pretexts, and quite as good a will to enforce them; but she had\r\nfewer ships, and for that reason, and that only, did rather less damage.\r\n\r\nBut however earnest Monroe was in insisting upon the rights of neutrals,\r\nin urging upon the French ministry the strict observance of treaty\r\nobligations, and in complaining of the constant injuries done in their\r\ndespite, there was another thing about which he was far more earnest.\r\nHe was as anxious to aid the French to baffle, if possible, Jay's\r\nnegotiations in London as if he were uncovering a plot against his own\r\ngovernment. When the ratification of the treaty was made known in Paris,\r\nthe indignation of the Directory was hardly kept within bounds. The\r\nminister of foreign affairs notified Monroe that the Directory\r\nconsidered the stipulations of the treaty of 1778 as altered and\r\nsuspended in their most essential parts by this treaty with England.\r\nUnder any circumstances the French would, no doubt, have resented the\r\nestablishment of friendly relations between the United States and the\r\nold enemy of France, with whom she at that moment was engaged in a war\r\narousing more than the bitter inherited enmity of the two peoples. But\r\nthe course Monroe had seen fit to pursue had done much to assure the\r\nFrench that the strong party in the United States, which he represented,\r\nwould never permit the virgin republic to be delivered, as it was\r\nassumed the treaty did deliver her, bound and gagged, into the hands of\r\nthe power which Jefferson loved to call \"the harlot England.\" The first\r\nenthusiasm of the Revolution was fast growing into cant in both\r\ncountries, and the language of devotion to liberty, equality, and\r\nfraternity was beginning to lose all meaning. But it was easy to be\r\ndeceived by the assurances, more significant in actions than in words,\r\nof an official representative, that the American people, save an\r\nAnglicized and decreasing minority, were the friends, and meant to be\r\nthe allies, of France. Of course the French were all the more\r\nexasperated because they had permitted themselves to be deluded. Monroe\r\nwas first rebuked by his own government for neglecting to do all that\r\nmight have been done to reconcile the Directory to a treaty between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain; and soon after, his conduct continuing\r\nunsatisfactory, he was recalled.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, possible that the French Directory were not misled;\r\nthat nothing would have reconciled them to the British treaty; and that\r\ntheir subsequent course would have been the same had they believed the\r\nAmerican people were desirous to be on good terms with England solely\r\nfor their own tranquillity and interest, and not at all because any\r\nlarge portion of them were at enmity with France. This, however, would\r\nnot be a valid excuse for Monroe's course as a representative of his\r\ngovernment. The only defense for him is, that he was deceived by his\r\nfriends at home; they must share, therefore, the responsibility for his\r\nconduct, inasmuch as they encouraged a man not over strong in mind or\r\ncharacter, and more likely to be governed by impulse than by good\r\njudgment, to abuse the confidence placed in him by the administration.\r\n\r\nFrom any share in this responsibility, however, Madison must be\r\nrelieved. He was in very constant correspondence with Monroe, and kept\r\nhim carefully advised as to the progress of the treaty. No man desired\r\nits defeat more earnestly than he, and he believed that a majority of\r\nthe people were opposed to it. But he evidently doubted its rejection\r\nfrom the first, and his discussion of possibilities in his letters to\r\nMonroe was always frank and discriminating. In the end he accounted for\r\nthe vote in its favor in the House of Representatives by the activity\r\nand influence of its friends, which its opponents wanted the ability or\r\nthe time to overcome. It is probable that his colleagues of his own\r\nparty in the House did not agree with him that public opinion was\r\nagainst the treaty, as it was by votes from their side that its\r\nacceptance was carried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D P Madison]\r\n\r\nWith the ensuing session of Congress, at the close of Washington's\r\nadministration, Madison's congressional service ended. The leadership of\r\nthe opposition, whatever may be thought of its influence upon the\r\nwelfare of the country, or of the personal motives by which he may have\r\nbeen governed, had devolved upon him, almost from the beginning, by\r\nnatural selection of the fittest for that position. It was not an easy\r\nplace to take, either by one's own choice or by the suffrages of others;\r\nfor at the head of the administration to be opposed stood the man most\r\nrevered by a grateful country, surrounded by men among those, at least,\r\nwho were best known for their past services and most esteemed for their\r\nability and character. It was the more difficult for one whose personal\r\nrelation to the President was that of the warmest friendship; to whom\r\nthe President was accustomed to turn for counsel and even for\r\nguidance; and who, being among those eminent men to whom the people owed\r\ntheir new Constitution, was counted upon to strengthen the union of the\r\nStates and build up a strong and stable government. He played his\r\ndifficult part, nevertheless, with dignity; if not brilliant, he was\r\nalways ready with the best reasons that could be given for the measures\r\nhe supported; and his zeal was invariably tempered with a wise\r\nmoderation and a courtesy toward opponents which made him always\r\nrespected, and sometimes feared for reserved force, in debate.\r\n\r\nSomewhat more than a year before his retirement from Congress Mr.\r\nMadison had married, and it is quite possible that this may in part have\r\nmoved him to seek rest in the tranquillity of a country life. Tradition\r\nsays that Mrs. Madison was a beautiful woman. She has in our time been a\r\nmarked figure in the society of Washington, and many remember her for\r\nher fine presence, her powers of conversation, and that beauty which\r\nsometimes belongs to the aged, though it may not have been preceded by\r\nyouthful comeliness. Her maiden name was Dolly Payne, and her parents\r\nwere members of the Society of Friends. When Madison married her she was\r\nMrs. Todd, the widow of John Todd, a lawyer of Philadelphia. Her age at\r\nthis time was twenty-six years, Mr. Madison being forty-three, and she\r\nsurvived him thirteen years, dying in 1849. On her tombstone she is\r\ncalled \"Dolley;\" but Mr. Rives, in his life of her husband, ever\r\nmindful of the proprieties, calls her \"Dorothea,\" or rather, Mrs.\r\nDorothea Payne Madison; for, like the Vicar of Wakefield, he loved to\r\ngive the whole name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nAT HOME--\"RESOLUTIONS OF '98 AND '99\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Madison, in retiring for a time from public office, did not lose his\r\ninterest in public affairs. Of few Americans can it be said with more\r\ntruth that he had a genius for politics, and the subject, wherever he\r\nmight be, was never out of his mind. There is not much else in the\r\nvolumes of his published letters, while there is just enough else to\r\nshow that in these he said all he had to say about anything. His more\r\nambitious writings, the papers in \"The Federalist,\" the essay on The\r\nBritish Doctrine of Neutral Trade, his controversial articles in the\r\nnewspapers under various pseudonyms, are all political, all able, and\r\nall of great value as a part of the history of the times. Those which\r\nare controversial, however, must be taken, like his letters, as aids to\r\nknowledge rather than as definite conclusions to be accepted without\r\nquestion. It does not detract from the value of these letters, however,\r\nthat they are written from the point of view of a party leader. Affairs\r\nof only temporary importance sometimes loom up before him merely because\r\nof their influence upon some immediate party movement; and others, of\r\nfar-reaching consequences, which have no such bearing, escape his\r\nnotice altogether; but the reader soon learns that he may, at any rate,\r\nconfide in the sincerity of the writer, and accept as freely the reasons\r\ngiven for his course as they are frankly stated.\r\n\r\nOf the literary value of his writings, aside from their historical\r\ninterest, there is not much to be said, though Mr. Madison always wrote,\r\neven in his letters, as if writing for posterity. He was not felicitous\r\nin the use of language; the style is turgid, heavy with resounding words\r\nof many syllables, unillumined by any ray of imagination, any flash of\r\nwit or of humor; and the sentences are often involved and badly put\r\ntogether. But there is a genuineness, an evident sincerity of purpose,\r\nin all he wrote, and occasionally an expression of deep feeling, which\r\nare always impressive. We search for glimpses of his private life and\r\ncharacter in such letters, for they are not easily apparent. In one\r\nsense he had no private life, or, at least, none that was not so\r\nsubordinate to his public career that there was little in it either\r\nsignificant or attractive. There is, in this respect, a marked contrast\r\nbetween his correspondence and that of Jefferson. There was, possibly, a\r\nlittle affectation in Jefferson's frequent assertions of his intense\r\ndesire for the quiet of the country and the tranquillity of home, and of\r\nhis distaste for the turmoils and anxieties of public office. But he was\r\ncertainly fond of country life, with the leisure to potter about among\r\nhis sheep and his trees; to watch the growth of his wheat and his\r\nclover; to contrive new coulters for his plows; to talk of philosophy,\r\nof the Social Contract, of mechanics, and of natural history: if he was\r\naverse to public life, it was not because political power and\r\ndistinction were a burden to him, except as they brought with them\r\nstrife and unpopularity, which truly his soul loathed for himself,\r\nthough he rather liked to set other people by the ears. His private life\r\nwas unquestionably as full of interest to himself as it is entertaining\r\nto look upon in the unconscious revelation of his own letters.\r\n\r\nBut with Madison it was apparently quite otherwise. He unbent with\r\ndifficulty. Always solemn and dignified, it was rather painful than\r\npleasant to him to stoop to the petty matters of every-day existence. He\r\nhad no small affectations, and was not forever asserting that he was\r\nwithout ambition; as if that, without which nobody is of much use in the\r\nworld either to himself or to others, were a weakness akin to depravity.\r\nWith brief intervals, covering only a few months altogether, he was\r\nwhere he best liked to be, from his entrance upon public life in 1775\r\ntill he stepped down in 1817 from that political elevation beyond which\r\nthere are no ascending steps. During these forty-two years he found a\r\ncertain enjoyment in a country home for a little while at a time, but it\r\nwas chiefly the enjoyment of needed rest from official labor. The price\r\nof tobacco and the promise of the wheat crop interested him then, but\r\nonly as they interested him always as a source of his own income, and\r\nas the index to the general prosperity. At the end of a letter upon\r\npolitical matters, he announces with satisfaction that his merino ewe\r\nhas dropped a lamb, and both mother and offspring are as well as could\r\nbe expected; but it was probably Mr. Jefferson's gratification rather\r\nthan his own that he had in mind, for it was Mr. Jefferson who had\r\nimported the sheep. Again, in a similar letter, he takes a little\r\nremaining space to express a hope that Mr. Jefferson may permit the use\r\nof the rams of that flock to improve the breed of the native stock; not,\r\napparently, that he cared so much about wool as that he wished to show a\r\ncourteous and friendly interest in one of Mr. Jefferson's many projects\r\nfor the improvement of things generally.\r\n\r\nIt was probably during the year of comparative leisure after he left\r\nCongress that Mr. Madison built his house at Montpellier, though some\r\nquestion has been raised on this point. He certainly was building a\r\nhouse at that time, and it is not likely that he ever employed himself\r\nin that way more than once. Scattered among discussions of Alien and\r\nSedition Laws, the war in Europe, free goods in neutral ships, and other\r\npublic topics, are brief allusions to lathing nails which he depended\r\nupon Mr. Jefferson to supply; that gentleman having recently set up a\r\nmachine for their manufacture, which, however, like a good many other of\r\nhis contrivances, seems to have had a hitch in it. So also he asks the\r\nVice-President to see to it that, when the window-glass and the pulleys\r\nare forwarded, the \"chord\" for the latter shall not be forgotten; and\r\norders for other articles, only to be found in Philadelphia, are sent to\r\nhis obliging friend. Mr. Jefferson, it is easy to believe, found them\r\nrather the most interesting part of the political letters to which they\r\nwere appended; and he was quite willing, no doubt, to relieve the tedium\r\nof presiding over the Senate by searching through the Market Street\r\nshops for the latest improvements in builders' hardware. To Mr. Monroe,\r\nMadison wrote that, as he is sending off a wagon to fetch nails for his\r\ncarpenters, \"it will receive the few articles which you have been so\r\ngood as to offer from the superfluities of your stock, and which\r\ncircumstances will permit me now to lay in.\" Evidently he was getting\r\nready to go to housekeeping with his young wife. Monroe's stock of\r\nhousehold goods had been replenished, perhaps by importations from\r\nFrance on his recent return, and he was disposing of his old supplies,\r\nby gift or sale, among his neighbors. Madison, at any rate, sends this\r\nmodest list of what he would like to have: \"To wit, two table-cloths for\r\na dining-room of about eighteen feet; two, three, or four, as may be\r\nconvenient, for a more limited scale; four dozen napkins, which will not\r\nin the least be objectionable for having been used; and two mattresses.\"\r\nIt was not an extravagant outfit, even though it had not been meant\r\nfor one of those lordly Virginia homes of which some modern historians\r\ngive us such charming pictures. \"We are so little acquainted,\"--Mr.\r\nMadison continues in that stately way which nothing ever surprised him\r\ninto forgetting,--\"we are so little acquainted with the culinary\r\nutensils in detail that it is difficult to refer to such by name or\r\ndescription as would be within our wants.\"\r\n\r\nBut pots and kettles,--though that may not be the name they were known\r\nby in Virginia,--table-cloths and mattresses, however moderate in\r\nnumber, are sure indications that the house, which was to be his\r\nresidence when he should be content to retire from public service, was\r\nfinished early in 1798. He had rested long enough, and was busy that\r\nyear in attendance upon the state Assembly at Richmond, to which he\r\nconsented the next year to be returned as a member. Perhaps it was\r\nbecause he could not keep longer out of the fray. Perhaps he felt called\r\nto a special duty. Affairs, foreign and domestic, were in a critical\r\ncondition. France, in her resentment at the Jay treaty, had committed so\r\nmany fresh outrages upon American commerce; had so exasperated the\r\nAmerican people by these outrages; and, by refusing to receive the\r\nministers from the United States, had so insulted them and the\r\ngovernment they represented in the proposed arrangements,--disclosed in\r\nthe X. Y. Z. correspondence,--that all friendly relations between the\r\ntwo countries had ceased, and it had seemed impossible that war could be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nFor a while the popular sympathy was entirely with Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration, and the promise could hardly be fairer that the\r\nFederalists, if they managed wisely, might remain in power and be\r\nsustained by the whole country. But in some respects they were as unwise\r\nas in others they were unfortunate. President Adams, though possessing\r\nmany great qualities, was of too irascible and jealous a temper to be a\r\nsuccessful leader or a good ruler. But there were other men of\r\ndistinction among the Federalists who were hardly less fond of having\r\ntheir own way than the President was of having his. The incompatibility\r\nof temper was not altogether on one side in that family quarrel. But all\r\nwere equally responsible for such a blunder as the enactment of the\r\nAlien and Sedition Laws. The provocation, it is true, was unquestionably\r\ngreat. Refugees from abroad had crowded to the United States, many of\r\nwhom were professional agitators, and some were very sorry vagabonds.\r\nWhatever reason they might have had for fomenting discontent with\r\ngovernment in England or in France, there was nothing to justify any\r\nsuch violent measures in this country. But from their conduct as\r\npolitical partisans, particularly as newspaper editors, they soon came\r\nto be looked upon by the Federalists--for they all joined the other\r\nparty--as a dangerous class. There grew up a feeling that it would be\r\nwiser for civil affairs to remain, in city, state, and nation, in the\r\nhands of those who were born and educated under republican\r\ninstitutions, and not to fall altogether under control of those who were\r\nalien in blood and religion, and who were inclined to look upon\r\npolitics, not in the light of the citizen's duty to the common weal, but\r\nas an easy and profitable calling where the least scrupulous scoundrel\r\ncould gather the largest share of spoils. It may be that the authors of\r\nthose laws were so determined to forestall the apprehended evils of such\r\na dispensation because use had not accustomed them, as it has later\r\ngenerations of American citizens, to live under it in humility if not\r\ncontent. Or, perhaps, they wanted that profound faith of our time that\r\nthe longer this subversion of government is submitted to, the easier it\r\nwill be to get back to the rule of the honest and wise.\r\n\r\nBut, at any rate, whatever their reasons, they meant by these laws\r\nrelating to aliens to put the acquirement of citizenship under more\r\nstringent regulations, and to check the growth and promulgation of\r\nseditious doctrines. If it be true, as is sometimes maintained with some\r\nplausibility, that citizens, to be intrusted with self-government,\r\nshould be endowed with a certain degree of intelligence and virtue, then\r\nthe aim of the framers of the laws, in the first case, was a good one;\r\nand, in the second case, the country has had some experience in later\r\ntimes which tends to show that they were not altogether wrong in\r\nbelieving that doctrines and practices which may lead to insurrection\r\nand civil war might best be met, so far as is possible, at the outset.\r\nNevertheless, the laws, under the circumstances of the time, were\r\nill-considered and injudicious. For one reason, they put an efficient\r\nweapon into the hands of the opposition at a moment when it was at a\r\nloss where to turn for one. \"Anglicism\" and \"British gold\" were\r\nblunderbusses which, in the present popular irritation against France,\r\nhad for a time lost their usefulness, and were apt to miss fire. But an\r\nappeal to a generous and impulsive people on behalf of the unfortunate\r\nrefugees, who had fled from the tyranny of the Old World to find liberty\r\nand a home in the New, was sure to be listened to. A good many, besides\r\nthose who assumed that republicanism and the rights of man were in their\r\nspecial keeping, believed that an unfortunate class had been dealt with\r\nhastily, and even cruelly. The clamor, once begun, told heavily against\r\nthe Federalists. They could be denounced now, not only as the enemies of\r\nliberty in France, but as refusing it to men of any nation or any race\r\nwho should seek it in the United States,--it being, of course,\r\nunderstood that races of black or yellow complexion need not apply. It\r\nwas, indeed, advanced as an argument against one of the acts,--which\r\ngave the President power to order out of the country all aliens whose\r\npresence he thought dangerous,--that it might be used to prevent the\r\nimportation of persons from Africa. On this point Mr. Gallatin, a native\r\nof Switzerland, was exceedingly anxious lest there be a violation of\r\nthe Constitution. But the outrage upon the rights of man here\r\napprehended was the right of white men to make black men slaves.\r\n\r\nAgainst the enactment of these laws Mr. Jefferson did nothing as\r\nVice-President. But whatever was his motive for official inaction, it\r\nwas not because he approved them. He wrote the Kentucky \"resolutions of\r\n'98,\"--the strongest protest that could be made against them, and to be\r\nthenceforth held by nullifiers and secessionists as their covenant of\r\nfaith. But he acted secretly, taking counsel only with George Nicholas\r\nof Kentucky and William C. Nicholas of Virginia (brothers), and,\r\nHildreth says, \"probably with Madison.\" The resolutions were to be\r\noffered in the Kentucky legislature by George Nicholas, and, with some\r\nmodifications, were passed by that body in November. A year afterward\r\nother resolutions were passed to reassert the opinions of the previous\r\nsession, and to record against the laws the \"solemn protest\" of the\r\nlegislature; and further declaring \"that a nullification by those\r\nsovereignties [the States] of all unauthorized acts done under color of\r\nthat instrument [the Constitution] is the rightful remedy.\" In the\r\nresolutions which Mr. Jefferson had prepared for Nicholas the year\r\nbefore, this essential doctrine is found in that portion which Nicholas\r\nhad omitted, in these words,--\"where powers are assumed which have not\r\nbeen delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy.\" As\r\noriginally prepared, the resolutions were found in Jefferson's\r\nhandwriting after his death. Hildreth's conjecture that Madison, as well\r\nas the brothers Nicholas, was consulted in the preparation of these\r\nresolutions, rests only on circumstantial evidence. The Kentucky\r\nresolutions were passed in November; those of Virginia in December; the\r\nformer were written by Jefferson, the latter by Madison; and the\r\ndoctrines in each are essentially the same. It would have been a\r\nperfectly natural thing for the two friends to consult together upon a\r\nmeasure of so much importance; there is no reason why they should not\r\nhave done so; and these coincidences suggest that they probably did.\r\nJefferson clearly shirked the responsibility of an act which he knew\r\nwould endanger the Union; but Madison made no secret, so far as can be\r\nseen now, of his going to Richmond, though not a member of the Assembly,\r\napparently for the express purpose of writing these resolutions and\r\nurging their adoption. But Jefferson was not a man of courage even in\r\ndoing that which he believed to be wise. In Madison it was only the\r\nconscience that was timid; and having once convinced himself that the\r\nthing he proposed to do was right, he was always ready to face the\r\nconsequences. It may be that neither of them foresaw that the real\r\nimportance of this particular act was rather prospective than immediate;\r\nand if so, their conduct is to be measured by its instant purpose. If\r\nJefferson meant then and there to dissolve the Union, or even to\r\nweaken the constitutional bond that held it together, he was not\r\novercautious in keeping out of sight. But if Madison's intention was to\r\nstrengthen the Union by withstanding what he believed to be a perilous\r\nviolation of the Constitution, then his courage, though it is to be\r\ncommended, is not to be wondered at. That, he said, was his motive, and\r\nto defend the resolutions and his own part in regard to them was the\r\nchief interest and serious labor of the latter years of his life. He was\r\nelected a member of the Assembly for the session of 1799-1800, probably\r\nbecause he and his friends thought his official presence desirable when\r\nthe subject should again come up for consideration at the reading of the\r\nreplies from other States, to all which the resolutions had been sent.\r\nThe report on those replies was also written by him, and the position\r\ntaken the year before was therein reaffirmed, explained, and elaborated\r\nat length.\r\n\r\nIn 1827-28 the doctrines of nullification and of secession were assumed\r\nto be the legitimate corollary of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions\r\nof 1798 and 1799. Jefferson was dead; but Madison felt called upon to\r\ndeny, in his own defense and the defense of the memory of his friend,\r\nthat there was any similarity between them. From 1830 to 1836 his mind\r\nseems to have been chiefly occupied with this subject, upon which he\r\nwrote many letters, and a paper of thirty pages, entitled \"On\r\nNullification,\" which bears the date of 1835-36, the latter year being\r\nthe last of his life. He resents the charge of any political\r\ninconsistency in the course of his long career, and most of all such an\r\ninconsistency as would impugn his attachment to the Constitution and the\r\nUnion. The resolutions of 1798, he maintains, do not and were not meant\r\nto assert a right in any one State to arrest or annul an act of the\r\ngeneral government, as that is a right that can only belong to them\r\ncollectively. Nullification and Secession he denounces as \"twin\r\nheresies,\" that \"ought to be buried in the same grave.\" \"A political\r\nsystem,\" he declares, \"which does not contain an effective provision for\r\na peaceable decision of all controversies arising within itself would be\r\na government in name only.\" He asserts that \"the essential difference\r\nbetween a free government and governments not free is that the former is\r\nfounded in compact, the parties to which are mutually and equally bound\r\nby it. Neither of them, therefore, can have a greater right to break off\r\nfrom the bargain than the other or others have to hold them to it.... It\r\nis high time that the claim to secede at will should be put down by the\r\npublic opinion.\" What,--he writes to another friend,--\"what can be more\r\npreposterous than to say that the States, as united, are in no respect\r\nor degree a nation, which implies sovereignty, ... and on the other\r\nhand, and at the same time, to say that the States separately are\r\ncompletely nations and sovereigns?... The words of the Constitution are\r\nexplicit, that the Constitution and laws of the United States shall be\r\nsupreme over the Constitution and laws of the several States; supreme in\r\ntheir exposition and execution, as well as in their authority. Without a\r\nsupremacy in these respects, it would be like a scabbard, in the hand of\r\na soldier, without a sword in it.\" Abraham Lincoln might have said this\r\ntwenty-eight years later when he determined that his first duty as\r\nPresident was to suppress insurrection.\r\n\r\nSuch is the drift of the many pages Mr. Madison wrote upon the subject\r\nduring the last five or six years of his life. He looked then, whatever\r\nhe may have thought in the closing years of the preceding century, upon\r\nthe United States as a nation, and not as a confederacy having its parts\r\nheld together only by \"a treaty or league\" called a constitution. But\r\nhis object is to show that there is nothing inconsistent in the\r\nresolutions of 1798 with these opinions upon the sovereignty of the\r\nUnited States; that he held them just as strongly then as he held them\r\nnow; and that they, and he as their author, looked to the States as a\r\nwhole, not to a single State, to find and apply a remedy, in a\r\nconstitutional way, for an unconstitutional measure of which an\r\nadministration of the government might be guilty. His position is\r\nmaintained with all the acuteness, ingenuity, and logical skill which\r\nmark his earlier writings. There is no sign of failure of mental power,\r\nof which those accused him who could not answer him. Such an imputation\r\nhe resented with as much indignation as he did a charge of\r\ninconsistency, which here could only mean falsehood. There is no\r\npossibility, then, of misunderstanding his opinions during the last six\r\nyears of his life; and the world has no right to doubt his repeated and\r\nearnest assurances that these were his opinions when he wrote the\r\nresolutions of 1798. It can only be said that the construction he gave\r\nthem thirty years afterward is opposed to the universal understanding of\r\nthem at the time they were written.\r\n\r\nBut if his defense of himself be considered complete, it is not even\r\nspecious when presented on behalf of Jefferson. Mr. Madison wrote in\r\n1830: \"That the term 'nullification' in the Kentucky resolutions belongs\r\nto those of 1799, with which Mr. Jefferson had nothing to do.... The\r\nresolutions of 1798, drawn by him, contain neither that nor any\r\nequivalent term.\" It was not then generally known, whether Mr. Madison\r\nknew it or not, that one of the resolutions and part of another which\r\nJefferson wrote to be offered in the Kentucky legislature in 1798 were\r\nomitted by Mr. Nicholas, and that therein was the assertion already\r\nquoted,--\"where powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a\r\nnullification of the act is the rightful remedy.\" The next year, when\r\nadditional resolutions were offered by Mr. Breckenridge, this idea, in\r\nsimilar though not in precisely the same language, was presented in the\r\nwords, \"that a nullification by those sovereignties [the States] of all\r\nunauthorized acts, done under color of that instrument, is the rightful\r\nremedy.\" In 1832, this fact, on the authority of Jefferson's grandson\r\nand executor, was made public; and, further, that another declaration of\r\nMr. Jefferson's in the resolution not used was an exhortation to the\r\nco-States \"that each will take measures of its own for providing that\r\nneither these acts nor any others of the general government, not plainly\r\nand intentionally authorized by the Constitution, shall be exercised\r\nwithin their respective territories.\" All this must have been known to\r\nMr. Madison then, if not before. Yet, three years later, in that paper\r\n\"On Nullification\" which has been mentioned, he wrote: \"The amount of\r\nthis modified right of nullification is, that a single State may arrest\r\nthe operation of a law of the United States.... And this newfangled\r\ntheory is attempted to be fathered on Mr. Jefferson, the apostle of\r\nrepublicanism.\" It would be charitable here to believe that there was\r\nsome lapse of memory in these latter days, and that he had forgotten\r\nthat Jefferson was, above all things, his own words being witness, the\r\napostle of nullification.\r\n\r\nThe Alien and Sedition Laws--of which the more obnoxious of the former\r\nwas never enforced, and the latter expired by limitation in two\r\nyears--had their influence in the presidential election of 1800. But it\r\nwas due more to differences between the President and some of the\r\nleaders of the Federal party that that party lost its hold upon power,\r\nnever to be regained. With the election of Jefferson, Madison entered\r\nupon another sphere of duty, which was politically a promotion, but\r\nwhere his influence, if it was so large, was not so evident as when an\r\nactive leader of his party. It was at Mr. Jefferson's \"pressing desire,\"\r\nMr. Madison himself says, in a letter written many years afterward, that\r\nhe took the office of secretary of state. In the same letter he explains\r\nthat he had declined an executive appointment under Washington, because,\r\nin taking a seat in the House of Representatives, he would be less\r\nexposed to the imputation of selfish views in the part he had taken in\r\n\"the origin and adoption of the Constitution;\" because there, if\r\nanywhere, he could be of service in sustaining it against its\r\nadversaries, especially as it was, \"in its progress, encountering trials\r\nof a new sort in the formation of new parties attaching adverse\r\nconstructions to it.\" The latter reason seems to be one of those happy\r\nafter-thoughts which public men not unfrequently flatter themselves will\r\nanticipate a question they would prefer should not be asked. Mr. Madison\r\nwas a member of the First Congress from the first day it met, before the\r\nnew Constitution had encountered new trials from new parties by any\r\nconstructions either one way or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 4, 1801, Mr. Jefferson tied his horse to the\r\nfence and walked alone into the Capitol to take the oath of office as\r\nPresident. Mr. Madison was not present at that perfunctory ceremony, the\r\ndeath of his aged father detaining him at home. He soon after, however,\r\nassumed the duties of the station to which Mr. Jefferson had called him,\r\nand there he remained till he took the presidential office, in his turn,\r\neight years afterward.\r\n\r\nThe new dynasty entered upon its course under happy circumstances. There\r\nwas, of course, much to fear from the condition of affairs in Europe;\r\nfor the United States must needs be in a perilous position so long as\r\nthe struggle for supremacy continued between France and England, and\r\nthat would be while Napoleon could command an army. But the danger of\r\nwar with France was no longer imminent, since Mr. Adams had wisely\r\nreëstablished friendly relations, though many of the leading Federalists\r\nbelieved it was at the cost of ruin to his own party. English\r\naggressions upon American commerce had for the moment ceased, as\r\nfourteen years afterward they ceased altogether, when the provocation\r\ndisappeared with the permanent establishment of peace in Europe. In the\r\ntemporary lull of the tempest the sun shone out of a serene sky, and the\r\nland was blessed with quiet and prosperity. \"Peace, commerce, and honest\r\nfriendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none,\" the\r\nPresident said in his inaugural address, were among \"the essential\r\nprinciples of our government, and consequently those which ought to\r\nshape its administration.\" The condition of the country was in accord\r\nwith the thought and may even have suggested it. \"We are all\r\nRepublicans; we are all Federalists,\" said Jefferson in his inaugural:\r\nit was meant, however, as an avowal of a tolerant belief in the\r\npatriotism of both parties, rather than, as has sometimes been supposed,\r\nan assertion that party lines, so clearly drawn in the election, were at\r\nlength obliterated. But hardly a year had passed before this seemed to\r\nbe almost literally true. One after another, States hitherto Federal,\r\nboth at the North and at the South, went over in their state elections\r\nto the Republican or Democratic party; till, with the exception of\r\nDelaware, there was not a single Federal State outside of New England;\r\nand even in that stronghold one State, Rhode Island, had marched off\r\nwith the majority. \"Everywhere,\" wrote Madison in October, \"the progress\r\nof the public sentiment mocks the cavils and clamors of the malignant\r\nadversaries of the administration.\"\r\n\r\nIf it may not be asserted that this overthrow of the Federal rule was\r\nfortunate at that juncture,--as nothing is more idle in history than\r\nspeculation upon what might have been,--it may at least be said that\r\nJefferson's administration for his first four years was a happy one for\r\nhis country and acceptable to his countrymen. None since Washington's\r\nhas ever been so popular; and no other, except Lincoln's, has ever been\r\nso successful. Nor can it be said of it that it was a happy period\r\nbecause it is without a history; for it included acts of moment,\r\naccepted then with an approbation and enthusiasm which time has\r\njustified. Not less shallow is that view of his character and of those\r\nyears of his administration, taken by many of his contemporaries, who\r\nneither loved nor respected him, and who attributed his success and his\r\npopularity to his good fortune. This was a favorite and easy way, among\r\nhis political opponents, of explaining a disagreeable fact. Parton notes\r\nin his Life that C. C. Pinckney could only understand Jefferson's hold\r\nupon public confidence as \"the infatuation of the people.\" John Quincy\r\nAdams said: \"Fortune has taken a pleasure in making Jefferson's greatest\r\nweaknesses and follies issue more successfully than if he had been\r\ninspired with the profoundest wisdom.\" \"When the people,\" said\r\nGouverneur Morris, \"have been long enough drunk, they will get sober;\r\nbut while the frolic lasts, to reason with them is useless.\" There has\r\nbeen more than one occasion of late years, and in more than one place,\r\nwhere this may be truly said of popular political enthusiasm; but it was\r\nnot true of that which prevailed for the first four years of this\r\ncentury; and Mr. Adams's sarcasm can hardly fail to recall the fact that\r\nwhen Mr. Jefferson, in his second term, was really guilty of a great\r\nfolly in adhering to a prolonged embargo, it was Mr. Adams who committed\r\none of the few follies of his own life in abandoning his party to give\r\nhis support to the President's blunder.\r\n\r\nThough there were many changes in Mr. Jefferson's cabinet in the course\r\nof eight years, they were not the result of dissensions. Yet he was,\r\nperhaps, more an absolute President than any other man who has ever held\r\nthat position. He sought and listened to counsel, no doubt; but taking\r\nit was another matter. He certainly did not take it if it did not suit\r\nhim; and if it was not likely to suit him, he was in no hurry to ask for\r\nit. It was in his own fertile brain, not in the suggestions of others,\r\nthat important measures had their birth. That trait in his character\r\nwhich phrenologists have named secretiveness largely governed his\r\nactions. It was natural for him to bring things about quietly and\r\nskillfully by setting others to do what he wanted done, without himself\r\nbeing seen, though sometimes there was no other motive than the mere\r\ngratification of secretiveness. He preferred often to suggest measures\r\nquietly to congressmen rather than to Congress, though the result in\r\neither case might be the same. At other times, where the end to be\r\nattained was of great importance and he was absolutely sure only of\r\nhimself, he boldly took the responsibility, as he did in the purchase of\r\nLouisiana, and in the suppression of the Monroe-Pinckney treaty with\r\nEngland in his second term. It is not surprising, therefore, that\r\nMadison's part, during the eight years of Jefferson's presidency, is\r\nfound to be more a secondary one than is usual with a secretary of\r\nstate, or than was usual with him. He was in perfect accord with his\r\nchief, who held always in the highest esteem his knowledge and judgment,\r\nand sought, no doubt, his sound and moderate advice when he thought he\r\nneeded advice from anybody. But Madison's influence is less visible in\r\nJefferson's administration than in Washington's, when he was in the\r\nopposition. Washington, where he doubted his own ability to decide a\r\nquestion and felt the need of enlightenment, was accustomed to call in\r\nMadison, though he did not always accept his friend's conclusions. It\r\nwas rarely that Jefferson was troubled with any doubt of his own\r\njudgment in the discussion or decision of any question that might come\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nThe most important measure of his administration was peculiarly his own,\r\nand when once determined upon it was pushed to a conclusion with vigor\r\nand courage. Nobody doubts now, or has doubted since the abolition of\r\nslavery, that the purchase of Louisiana was an act of sound\r\nstatesmanship. Jefferson did not foresee that the acquisition of that\r\nfertile territory would stimulate a domestic trade in slaves, as\r\nprofitable to the slave-breeding as to the slave-consuming States; or\r\nthat, as slavery increased and brought prosperity and power to a class,\r\nthere would grow up an oligarchy, resting on ownership in negroes,\r\nwhich, within sixty years, would have to be uprooted at an enormous\r\ncost. But his aim was to secure the peaceful possession of the\r\nMississippi territory on both its banks, as a permanent settlement of a\r\nquestion which, so long as it remained open, was a perpetual menace of\r\nwar with one or another European power. That danger would always involve\r\nthe possibility of the Appalachian range becoming the western boundary\r\nof the United States; in which case the valley of the Mississippi, and\r\nthe vast region west of it, would fall into the power of an alien\r\npeople. So far was plain to Mr. Jefferson; but the result of the\r\nrebellion of 1861 proves that he was wiser than he knew when he acquired\r\nthe territory stretching to the Sabine and the foot of the Rocky\r\nMountains for the occupation of a free people.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to repeat here the story of the purchase. The news\r\nof it reached Washington in July and was received with enthusiasm. That\r\nthere was no warrant in the Constitution for an acquisition of territory\r\nby purchase was manifest; and Mr. Jefferson's opponents were not in the\r\nleast backward in heaping reproaches and ridicule upon the great\r\nchampion of strict construction, who had no hesitation in violating the\r\nConstitution when it seemed to him wise to do so. Both the President and\r\nhis secretary frankly met the accusation by acknowledging its entire\r\njustice; but at the same time they put in, as a sufficient defense, the\r\nplea of the general welfare. This did not abate the ridicule, though the\r\nargument was a hard one for the Federalists to withstand; for it could\r\nnot be forgotten that it was on this ground that Hamilton, as secretary\r\nof the treasury, had justified the imposition of certain taxes, and the\r\nRepublicans had maintained that the plain limitations of the\r\nConstitution could not be overstepped on such a plea, even for the\r\ngeneral good. Jefferson was so sensitive to this constitutional\r\nobjection that he proposed to meet it by an amendment to the\r\nConstitution; but it was soon evident that the unwritten law of manifest\r\ndestiny did not need the appeal to the ballot-box. \"The grumblers,\"\r\nJefferson wrote to a friend soon after the news of the treaty was\r\nreceived, \"gave all the credit of the acquisition to the accident of\r\nwar.\" \"They would see,\" he added, in records on file, \"that though we\r\ncould not say when war would arise, yet we said with energy what would\r\ntake place when it should arise.\" He only meant by this, probably, that\r\nfrom the beginning of his administration he had been prepared to take\r\nadvantage of circumstances when war should break out again between\r\nEngland and France, as it was evident enough to the whole world that it\r\nmust break out sooner or later. That the particular conjunction of\r\ncircumstances, however, would occur that did occur, could not have been\r\nforeseen. Jefferson could have had no prescience that Spain would\r\nreconvey Louisiana to France; that Napoleon would enter at once upon\r\nextensive preparations for colonization on the banks of the Mississippi;\r\nand that he would be willing to relinquish this important step in his\r\ngreat scheme of a universal Latin Empire, that he might devote himself\r\nto the necessary preliminary work of subduing his most formidable enemy\r\nof the rival race. But it is Jefferson's best title to fame that he was\r\nready to take advantage of this conjunction of incidents at exactly the\r\nright moment. Doubtless the progress of civilization would have been\r\nessentially the same had he never been born. But having been born it\r\nfell to him to contribute largely to the events that have distributed\r\nthe race speaking the English tongue the most widely over the globe, and\r\nto exercise a powerful influence upon the age. It does not detract from\r\nthe merit of his act, however, that he by no means saw all its\r\nimportance, nor even dreamed of its consequences. The region beyond the\r\nMississippi, he thought, might be made useful as a refuge for Indian\r\ntribes of the East; but he neither saw nor could see then that the\r\npurchase of Louisiana was the essential though only the preliminary step\r\ntoward the occupation of the continent to the Pacific by the English\r\nrace. The expedition of Lewis and Clarke, which he sent out the next\r\nyear, was in the interest of science, and especially of geography,\r\nrather than of any possible settlement of that distant region. Indeed,\r\nhe said that if the new acquisition of territory were wisely managed, so\r\nas to induce the eastern Indians to cross the great river, the result\r\nwould be the \"condensing, instead of scattering, our population.\" But\r\n\"man proposes and God disposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate consequences, however, of the acquisition of Louisiana\r\nwere enough to bring almost universal popularity to the President,\r\nespecially at the South and West, without any revelation of the future.\r\nNor was the act the less popular because it was an immediate stimulus to\r\nthe foreign slave trade, partly because at the North that excited but\r\nlittle interest, and partly because at the South it excited a great\r\ndeal. The abolition societies, it is true, asked that the importation of\r\nslaves from Africa into the annexed territory should be forbidden; and\r\nan act was passed prohibiting their introduction, except by those\r\npersons from other parts of the United States who intended to be actual\r\nsettlers, and were, therefore, permitted to bring slaves imported\r\nprevious to 1798. But the law might properly have been entitled An Act\r\nfor the Encouragement of the Trade in Negroes; and so it seems to have\r\nbeen regarded by the older slave States. South Carolina reopened the\r\ntrade to Africa, and, as Congress failed to levy the constitutional tax\r\nof ten dollars a head, the raw material, so to speak, came in free. The\r\nrest could be safely left to the law of supply and demand. Neither\r\nSouth Carolina nor any other State had imported slaves since 1798. The\r\nwhole slave population, therefore, could be legally taken into Louisiana\r\nby actual settlers, and its place supplied in the old States by new\r\nimportations. The demand regulated the supply, and the supply came from\r\nAfrica as truly as if the importation had been direct to New Orleans.\r\nThis was the legal course of trade till 1808; thenceforward it\r\nflourished, without the protection of law but in spite of it, so long as\r\nit was profitable,--so long, that is, as the natural increase of the\r\neastern negro was insufficient to answer the demand of the south-western\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the peaceful extension of the national domain, there was\r\nmuch else in the first four or five years of Jefferson's administration\r\nto commend it to his countrymen. His party had nothing to complain of,\r\ndespite that genial and generous assurance of the inaugural which could\r\nnot be forgotten,--\"we are all Republicans; we are all Federalists;\" and\r\nthe other party had reason to be thankful that, considering, as he said,\r\n\"a Federalist seldom died, and never resigned,\" the number was not large\r\nwho were reminded, by their removal from office, of their unreasonable\r\ndelay in doing either the one thing or the other. It was only the\r\npoliticians, however, a class much smaller then than it is now, who were\r\nconcerned in such matters; the people at large were influenced by other\r\nconsiderations. Credit was given to the President for things that he\r\ndid not do, as well as for things that he did. It was due to him that\r\nthe administration was an economical one, but it was through Mr.\r\nGallatin's skillful management of the finances that the old public debt\r\nwas in process of speedy extinction. Occasional impeachments enlivened\r\nthe proceedings of Congress, which otherwise were as harmless as they\r\nwere dull. Jefferson was never so much out of his proper element as in\r\nwar, yet a successful one was carried on, during his first term, with\r\nthe Barbary States which put an end for many years to the exactions and\r\noutrages which had long been needlessly submitted to. It was a war,\r\nhowever, of only a few naval vessels in the hands of such energetic and\r\nbrave men, destined to become famous in later years, as Bainbridge,\r\nDecatur, Preble, and Barron; and to send off the expedition was about\r\nall the government had to do with it. It was easy to keep clear of\r\n\"entangling alliances,\" or entanglements of any sort with European\r\npowers, so long as they left the commerce of the United States to pursue\r\nits peaceful and profitable course without molestation. This both\r\nEngland and France did for several years, and there fell, in\r\nconsequence, an immense carrying trade into the hands of American\r\nmerchants, which brought prosperity to the whole country such as was\r\nnever known before, and was not known again, after it was lost, for near\r\na quarter of a century. All these things made Mr. Jefferson acceptable\r\nto the people as almost a heaven-appointed President. If, as John\r\nQuincy Adams thought, Fortune delighted to beam upon him with her\r\nsunniest smiles, he knew, at least, how best to take advantage of them.\r\nWhile they lasted, his secretary of state sat in their light and warmth,\r\nquietly and contentedly busy and in the diligent and faithful discharge\r\nof official duty, which could not in those years of prosperous\r\ntranquillity be over-burdensome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE EMBARGO\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost at the beginning of his second term, Jefferson found himself in\r\ntroubled waters, as the United States was drawn slowly but surely into\r\nthe vortex of European war. The carrying trade at home and abroad had\r\nfallen very much into the hands of Americans, and this became the root\r\nof bitterness. The tonnage of their vessels employed in foreign trade\r\nand entered at the custom-houses of the United States was equal to\r\nnearly four fifths of the tonnage of British vessels engaged in the same\r\ntraffic and entered at home. But there was this difference: the foreign\r\ncommerce of Great Britain was almost all carried on from her own ports,\r\nand the returns, therefore, showed its full volume. On the other hand,\r\nthe American ships were largely the carriers between the ports of the\r\nbelligerents and of other powers in Europe, and there were no entries at\r\nthe American custom-houses of their employment, or that they were\r\nemployed at all. As early as 1804-5, the aggregate value of this foreign\r\ntrade in the hands of Americans was probably much larger than that\r\ncontrolled by English merchants; and the former increased to the time\r\nof the promulgation of the Berlin decree of 1806, and the British orders\r\nin council of the next year. Nor was it only that wealth flowed into the\r\ncountry as the immediate return from this trade abroad. It stimulated\r\nenterprise and industry at home by the increase of capital; and there\r\nwas not only more money to work with, but more to spend. Consequently\r\nthe increase in exports and in imports grew steadily. In 1805, 1806, and\r\n1807, about one half the average total exports, something over the value\r\nof twenty million dollars, went to Great Britain alone; and the value of\r\nthe imports from that country for the same period was about sixty\r\nmillion dollars a year. Nor did this disproportion, though increasing\r\nwith the growing prosperity, represent a general balance of trade\r\nagainst the United States, as one school of political economists would\r\ninsist it must have done. For the imports were small from other European\r\ncountries in exchange for American products; and the difference,\r\ntogether with the profits of the carrying trade abroad, was remitted in\r\nEnglish manufactures. In other words, the imports from England\r\nrepresented the returns for all exports to Europe, and the returns\r\nalso--available in the first instance through bills of exchange--of the\r\ntrade which had been gained by Americans, and lost by those nations\r\nwhose ships the war had driven from the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe British manufacturer had no reason for discontent with this state of\r\nthings. The best market for his goods was constantly improving, and he\r\ndid not much care who took them to America. But the English government,\r\nand the English merchants who owned ships, looked on with neither\r\npleasure nor patience. It was impossible not to see that the United\r\nStates was fast becoming a great commercial rival. This in itself was\r\nbad enough; but it was the harder to bear when it was remembered--and it\r\ncould not be forgotten--that the rivalry came from States so lately in\r\nrevolt against England, and that their President at that moment was one\r\nof the most obnoxious of the rebels. Then what did it avail that England\r\nwas mistress of the seas, if her formidable enemy could laugh at any\r\neffort of hers to destroy the commerce of France, so long as that\r\ncommerce could be carried on in safety under a neutral flag? If that\r\nflag must be respected, English naval vessels and privateers would\r\ncruise in vain for prizes, for the merchant ships of any belligerent,\r\nnot strong enough to protect them, stayed in port. It had not yet come\r\nto be the acknowledged law of nations that free ships make free goods.\r\nBut nearly the same purpose was answered if the property of belligerents\r\ncould be safely carried in neutral ships under the pretense of being\r\nowned by neutrals. The products of the French colonies, for example,\r\ncould be loaded on board of American vessels, taken to the United States\r\nand reshipped there for France as American property. England looked upon\r\nthis as an evasion of the recognized public law that property of\r\nbelligerents was good prize. Accordingly, when she saw that French\r\ncommerce was thus put out of her reach, and that the rival she most\r\ndreaded was growing rich and powerful in the possession of it, she\r\nsought a remedy and was not long in finding one.\r\n\r\nIt was denied that neutrals could take advantage of a state of war to\r\nenter upon a trade which had not existed in time of peace; and American\r\nships were seized on the high seas, taken into port, and condemned in\r\nthe admiralty courts for carrying enemy's goods in such a trade. The\r\nexercise of that right, if it were one by the recognized law of nations,\r\nwould be of great injury to American commerce, unless it could be\r\nsuccessfully resisted. To show that it was not good law, Mr. Madison\r\nwrote his \"Examination of the British Doctrine which Subjects to Capture\r\na Neutral Trade not Open in the Time of Peace.\" The essay was a careful\r\nand thorough discussion of the whole question, and showed by citations\r\nfrom the most eminent writers on international law, by the terms of\r\ntreaties, and by the conduct of nations in the past, that the British\r\ndoctrine was erroneous and would lead to other infringements of the\r\nrights of neutrals. But argument, however unanswerable, has never yet\r\nbrought the British government to reason, unless there was something\r\nbehind it not so easy to disregard. The appropriation for Mr.\r\nJefferson's gunboats could not get that naval arm ready for effective\r\nservice much before the year 1815, even if it could then be of use; and\r\nthere was, moreover, this further difficulty in the way of its\r\nefficiency at the time,--that, as it could not go to the enemy, it must\r\nwait for the enemy to come to it; the conflagration would have to be\r\nbrought to the fire-engines. A war with England must be a naval war; and\r\nthe United States not only had no navy of any consequence, but it was a\r\npart of Mr. Jefferson's policy, in contrast with the policy of the\r\npreceding administrations, that there should be none, except these\r\ngunboats kept on wheels and under cover in readiness to repel an\r\ninvasion. But there was no fear of invasion, for by that England could\r\ngain nothing. \"She is renewing,\" Madison wrote in the autumn of 1805,\r\n\"her depredations on our commerce in the most ruinous shapes, and has\r\nkindled a more general indignation among our merchants than was ever\r\nbefore expressed.\"\r\n\r\nThese depredations were not confined to the seizing and confiscating\r\nAmerican ships under the pretense that their cargoes were contraband.\r\nSeamen were taken out of them on the charge of being British subjects\r\nand deserters, not only on the high seas in larger numbers than ever\r\nbefore, but within the waters of the United States. No doubt these\r\nseamen were often British subjects and their seizure was justifiable,\r\nprovided England could rightfully extend to all parts of the globe and\r\nto the ships of all nations the merciless system of impressment to which\r\nher own people were compelled to submit at home. Monroe, in a note to\r\nMadison, said that the British minister had informed him that \"great\r\nabuses were committed in granting protections\" in America, and\r\nacknowledged that \"he gave me some examples which were most shameful.\"\r\nBut even if it could be granted that English naval officers might seize\r\nsuch men without recourse to law, wherever they should be found and\r\nwithout respect for the flag of another nation, it was a national insult\r\nand outrage, calling for resentment and resistance, to impress American\r\ncitizens under the pretense that they were British subjects. But what\r\nwas the remedy? As a last resort in such cases, nations have but one.\r\nDiplomacy and legislation may be first tried, but, if these fail, war\r\nmust be the final ordeal. For this the administration made no\r\npreparation, and the more evident the unreadiness the less was the\r\nchance of redress in any other way. Immediate war would, of course, have\r\nbeen unwise; for what could a nation almost without a ship hope from a\r\ncontest with a power having the largest and most efficient navy in the\r\nworld? If this, however, was true from 1805 to 1807, it was not less\r\ntrue in 1812. But it need not have been true when war was actually\r\nresorted to, had the intervening years been years of preparation. The\r\nfact was, however, that the party which supported the administration was\r\nno more in favor of war at the earlier period than the administration\r\nitself was; and meanwhile, till a war party had come into existence and\r\ngained the ascendency, the country had been growing every year less and\r\nless in a condition to appeal to war.\r\n\r\nThe first measure adopted to meet the aggressions of the English was an\r\nact prohibiting the importation of certain British products. This had\r\nalways been a favorite policy with Madison. He had advanced and upheld\r\nit in former years, when a member of Congress, and when Great Britain\r\nhad first violated the rights and dignity of the United States by\r\ninterference with her foreign trade and by impressing her citizens.\r\nNon-intercourse had been an effective measure thirty years before, and\r\nhad a kind of prestige as an American policy. It was not seen, perhaps\r\ncould not be seen without experience, that a measure suited to the\r\ncolonial condition was not sufficient for an independent nation. But the\r\nPresident and secretary were in perfect accord; for Jefferson preferred\r\nanything to war, and Madison was persuaded that England would be brought\r\nto terms by the loss of the best market for her manufactures. Others,\r\nand notably John Randolph, saw in the measure only the first step which,\r\nif persisted in, must lead to war; while, in the mean time, to interfere\r\nwith importations would be quite as great an injury to the United States\r\nas to Great Britain. Randolph was apt to blurt out a good deal of truth\r\nwhen it happened to suit him. Impressment, he said, was an old grievance\r\nwhich had been thought a sufficient provocation for war when the nation\r\nwas not prepared; and it was no more ready to resort to that desperate\r\nremedy now than it had been in the past. Without a navy it would be\r\nimpossible to prevent the blockading of all the principal American ports\r\nby English squadrons. The United States would need an ally, and he was\r\nnot willing she should throw herself into the arms of that power which\r\nwas seeking universal conquest. France, he said, would be the tyrant of\r\nthe ocean if the British navy should be driven from it. The commerce,\r\nmoreover, which it was proposed to protect, was not the \"honest trade of\r\nAmerica,\" but \"a mushroom, a fungus of war,--a trade which, so soon as\r\nthe nations of Europe are at peace, will no longer exist.\" It was only\r\n\"a carrying trade which covers enemy's property;\" and he did not believe\r\nin plunging a great agricultural country into war for the benefit of the\r\nshipping merchants of a few seaports. There were many who agreed with\r\nhim; for it was one of the cardinal principles of the Jeffersonian\r\nschool of politics that between commerce and agriculture there was a\r\nnatural antagonism.\r\n\r\nBut the administration did not rely upon legislation alone in this\r\nemergency. The President followed up the act prohibiting the\r\nintroduction of British goods by sending William Pinkney to England in\r\nthe spring of 1806 to join Monroe, the resident minister, in an attempt\r\nat negotiation. These commissioners soon wrote that there was good\r\nreason for hoping that a treaty would be concluded, and thereupon the\r\nnon-importation act was for a time suspended. In December came the\r\nnews that a treaty was agreed upon, and soon after it was received by\r\nthe President. The most serious difficulty in the way of negotiation had\r\nbeen the question of impressment. The British government claimed the\r\nright to arrest deserters from its service anywhere outside the\r\njurisdiction of other nations, and that jurisdiction, it was maintained,\r\ncould not extend beyond the coast limit over the open sea, the highway\r\nof all nations. There was an evident disposition, however, to come to\r\nsome compromise. The English commissioners proposed that their\r\ngovernment should prohibit, under penalty, the seizure of American\r\ncitizens anywhere, and that the United States should forbid, on her\r\npart, the granting of certificates of citizenship to British subjects,\r\nof which deserters took advantage. But as this would be an\r\nacknowledgment virtually of the right of search on board American ships,\r\nand the denial of citizenship in the United States to foreigners, the\r\nAmerican commissioners could not entertain that proposition. They were\r\nwilling, however, if the assumed right to board American ships were\r\ngiven up, to agree, on behalf of their government, to aid in the arrest\r\nand return of British deserters when seeking a refuge in the United\r\nStates. But to this the British commissioners would not accede.\r\n\r\nMonroe and Pinkney were enjoined, in the instructions written by the\r\nsecretary of state, to make the abandonment of impressment the first\r\ncondition of a treaty. A treaty, nevertheless, was agreed upon, without\r\nthis provision. But when it was sent to the President, the ministers\r\nexplained:--\r\n\r\n     \"That, although this government [the British] did not feel at\r\n     liberty to relinquish, formally, by treaty, its claim to search our\r\n     merchant vessels for British seamen, its practice would\r\n     nevertheless be essentially, if not completely, abandoned. That\r\n     opinion has since been confirmed by frequent conferences on the\r\n     subject with the British commissioners, who have repeatedly assured\r\n     us that, in their judgment, we were made as sure against the\r\n     exercise of their pretension by the policy which their government\r\n     had adopted in regard to that very delicate and important question,\r\n     as we could have been made by treaty.\"\r\n\r\nThese assurances did not satisfy the President. Without consulting the\r\nSenate, though Congress was in session when the treaty was received, and\r\nalthough the Senate had been previously informed that one had been\r\nagreed upon, the President rejected it. On several other points it was\r\nnot acceptable; but, as Mr. Madison wrote to a friend, \"the case of\r\nimpressments particularly having been brought to a formal issue, and\r\nhaving been the primary object of an extraordinary mission, a treaty\r\ncould not be closed which was silent on that subject.\" The\r\ncommissioners, therefore, were ordered to renew negotiations. This they\r\nfaithfully tried to do for a year, but were finally told by the British\r\nminister that a treaty once concluded and signed, but afterward rejected\r\nin part by one of the contracting powers, could not again be taken up\r\nfor consideration. The opponents of the administration made the most of\r\nthis action of Mr. Jefferson. The country was not permitted to forget,\r\neven were forgetfulness possible, that thousands of seamen had been\r\ntaken from American vessels, and that the larger proportion of these\r\nwere native-born citizens of the United States. Not that these opponents\r\nwanted war; that, they believed, would be ruinous without a navy, and\r\ntherefore some reasonable compromise was all that could be hoped for.\r\nBut what was to be thought of an administration that would not go to war\r\nbecause it was not prepared; would not prepare in the hope that some\r\nfuture conjunction of circumstances would stave off that last resort;\r\nand, meanwhile, would accept no terms which might at least mitigate the\r\ninjuries visited upon the sea-faring people of the United States, and\r\npossibly relieve the nation from an insolent exercise of power which it\r\nwas not strong enough to resent?\r\n\r\nAs England's need of seamen increased, the captains of her cruisers,\r\nencouraged by the failure of negotiation, grew bolder in overhauling\r\nAmerican ships and taking out as many men as they believed, or pretended\r\nto believe, were deserters. In the summer of 1807 an outrage was\r\nperpetrated on the frigate Chesapeake, as if to emphasize the contempt\r\nwith which a nation must be looked upon which only screamed like a woman\r\nat wrongs which it wanted the courage and strength to resent, or the\r\nwisdom to compound for. The Chesapeake was followed out of the harbor\r\nof Norfolk by the British man-of-war Leopard, and when a few miles at\r\nsea, the Chesapeake being brought to under the pretense that the English\r\ncaptain wished to put some dispatches on board for Europe, a demand was\r\nmade for certain deserters supposed to be on the American frigate.\r\nCommodore Barron replied that he knew of no deserters on his ship, and\r\nthat he could permit no search to be made, even if there were. After\r\nsome further altercation the Englishman fired a broadside, killing and\r\nwounding a number of the Chesapeake's crew. Commodore Barron could do\r\nnothing else but surrender, for he had only a single gun in readiness\r\nfor use, and that was fired only once and then with a coal from the\r\ncook's galley. The ship was then boarded, the crew mustered, and four\r\nmen arrested as deserters. Three of them were negroes,--two natives of\r\nthe United States, the other of South America. The fourth man, probably,\r\nwas an Englishman. They were all deserters from English men-of-war lying\r\noff Norfolk; but the three negroes declared that they had been kidnaped,\r\nand their right to escape could not be justly questioned; indeed, the\r\nEnglish afterward took this view of it apparently, for the men were\r\nreleased on the arrival of the Leopard at Halifax. But the fourth man\r\nwas hanged.\r\n\r\nFor this direct national insult, explanation, apology, and reparation\r\nwere demanded, and at the same time the President put forth a\r\nproclamation forbidding all British ships of war to remain in American\r\nwaters. Of how much use the latter was we learn from a letter of Madison\r\nto Monroe: \"They continue to defy it,\" he wrote, \"not only by remaining\r\nwithin our waters, but by chasing merchant vessels arriving and\r\ndeparting.\" Some preparation was made for war, but it was only to call\r\nupon the militia to be in readiness, and to order Mr. Jefferson's\r\ngunboats to the most exposed ports. Great Britain was not alarmed. The\r\ncaptain of the Leopard, indeed, was removed from his command, as having\r\nexceeded his duty; but a proclamation on that side was also issued,\r\nrequiring all ships of war to seize British seamen on board foreign\r\nmerchantmen, to demand them from foreign ships of war, and if the demand\r\nwas refused to report the fact to the admiral of the fleet. It was not\r\ntill after four years of irritating controversy that any settlement was\r\nreached in regard to the affair of the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nNew perils all the while were besetting American commerce. In November,\r\n1806, Napoleon's Berlin decree was promulgated, forbidding the\r\nintroduction into France of the products of Great Britain and her\r\ncolonies, whether in her own ships or those of other nations. This was\r\nin violation of the convention between France and the United States, if\r\nit was meant that American vessels should come under the prohibition;\r\nbut for a time there was some hope that they might be excepted. In the\r\ncourse of the year, however, it was officially declared in Paris that\r\nthe treaty would not be allowed to weaken the force of a war measure\r\naimed at Great Britain. Under this decision, cargoes already seized were\r\nconfiscated and the trade of the United States faced a new calamity. The\r\ndecree, it was declared, was a rightful retaliation of a British order\r\nin council of six months before, which had established a partial\r\nblockade of a portion of the French coast. In the kidnaping business,\r\nFrance could not, of course, compete with England; for there were few of\r\nher citizens to be found on board of American vessels, and to seize a\r\nYankee sailor, under the pretense that he was a Frenchman, was an\r\nabsurdity never thought of. But hundreds of Americans, the crews of\r\nships seized for violation of the terms of the Berlin decree, were\r\nthrown into French prisons. So far, therefore, as the United States had\r\ngood ground of complaint on any score against either power, there was\r\nlittle to choose between them. Mr. Jefferson's repugnance to war was\r\nsufficient to hold him back from one with England, though he might have\r\nhad France for an ally; still more unwilling was he, by a war with\r\nFrance, to make a friend of England, whom he still looked upon as the\r\nnatural enemy of the United States; for, notwithstanding all that had\r\ncome and gone, he still regarded France with something of the old\r\naffection. In the autumn of 1807 he called a special session of Congress\r\nin consideration of the increasing aggressions of Great Britain,\r\nespecially in the attack upon the Chesapeake, and the injury done by the\r\ninterdiction of neutral trade with any country with which that power\r\nwas at war. But he had no recommendations to offer of resistance nor\r\neven of defense, except that some additions be made to the gunboats, and\r\nthat sailors on shore be enrolled as a sort of gunboat militia. The\r\nprobable real purpose of calling the extra session, however, appeared in\r\nabout two weeks, when he sent a special message to the Senate\r\nrecommending an embargo.\r\n\r\nAn act was almost immediately passed which, if anything more was needed\r\nto complete the ruin of American commerce, supplied that deficiency. A\r\nmonth before this time the English ministry had issued a new order in\r\ncouncil--the news of which reached Jefferson as he was about to send in\r\nhis message--proclaiming a blockade of pretty much all Europe, and\r\nforbidding any trade in neutral vessels unless they had first gone into\r\nsome British port and paid duties on their cargoes; and within\r\ntwenty-four hours of the President's message recommending the embargo,\r\nNapoleon proclaimed a new decree from Milan, by which it was declared\r\nthat any ship was lawful prize that had anything whatever to do with\r\nGreat Britain,--that should pay it tribute, that should carry its\r\nmerchandise, that should be bound either to or from any of its ports.\r\nAll that these powers could do to shut every trading vessel out of all\r\nEuropean ports was now done; and at this opportune moment Mr. Jefferson\r\ncame to their aid by compelling all American vessels to stay at home. It\r\nis not easy in our time to conceive of a President proposing, or of a\r\nparty accepting, or of the people submitting to, such a measure as this.\r\nBut Mr. Jefferson's followers were very obedient, and there was,\r\nundoubtedly, a very general belief that trade with the United States was\r\nso important to the nations at war that for the sake of its renewal the\r\nobnoxious decrees and orders in council would soon be repealed. But,\r\nexcept upon certain manufacturers in England, little influence was\r\nvisible. General Armstrong, the American minister in France, wrote:\r\n\"Here it is not felt; and in England, amid the more recent and\r\ninteresting events of the day, it is forgotten.\" When, however, the\r\neffect was evident at home of a law forbidding any American vessels from\r\ngoing to sea, even to catch fish, and prohibiting the export of any of\r\nthe products of the United States, either in their own ships or those of\r\nany other country, then there arose a popular clamor for the abandonment\r\nof a policy so ruinous. Within four months of its enactment, Josiah\r\nQuincy of Massachusetts declared, in a debate in Congress, that \"an\r\nexperiment such as is now making was never before--I will not say\r\ntried--it never before entered into the human imagination. There is\r\nnothing like it in the narrations of history or in the tales of fiction.\r\nAll the habits of a mighty nation are at once counteracted. All their\r\nproperty depreciated. All their external connections violated. Five\r\nmillions of people are engaged. They cannot go beyond the limits of\r\nthat once free country; now they are not even permitted to thrust their\r\nown property through the grates.\" While American ships at home were kept\r\nthere, those which had remained abroad to escape the embargo were met by\r\na new peril. Some of them were in French ports awaiting a turn in\r\naffairs; others ventured to load with English goods in English ports, to\r\nbe landed in France under the pretense, supported by fraudulent papers,\r\nthat they were direct from the United States or other neutral country.\r\nThe fraud was too transparent to escape detection long, and Napoleon\r\nthereupon issued, in the spring of 1808, the Bayonne decree authorizing\r\nthe seizure and confiscation of all American vessels. They were either\r\nEnglish or American, he said; if the former, they were enemy's ships and\r\nliable to capture; but if the latter, they should be at home, and he was\r\nonly enforcing the embargo law of the United States, which she ought to\r\nthank him for.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity and tranquillity which marked the earlier years of\r\nJefferson's administration disappeared in its last year. Congress, both\r\nin its spring and winter sessions, could talk of little else but the\r\ndisastrous embargo; proposing, on the one hand, to make it the more\r\nstringent by an enforcement act, and, on the other, to substitute for it\r\nnon-intercourse with England and France, restoring trade with the rest\r\nof the world, and leaving the question of decrees and orders in council\r\nopen for future consideration. The President no longer held his party\r\nunder perfect control. The mischievous results of the embargo policy\r\nwere evident enough to a sufficient number of Republicans to secure in\r\nFebruary, 1809, the repeal of that measure, to take effect the next\r\nmonth as to all countries except England and France, and, with regard to\r\nthem, at the adjournment of the next Congress. But the prohibition of\r\nimportation from both these latter countries was continued till the\r\nobnoxious orders in council and the decrees should be repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMADISON AS PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson named his own successor. Of the three Democratic\r\ncandidates, Madison, Monroe, and George Clinton, he preferred Madison\r\nnow, and urged Monroe to wait patiently as next in succession. Beyond\r\ntwo lives he did not, perhaps, think proper to dictate; and, besides,\r\nClinton was not a Virginian. What little opposition there was to Madison\r\nin his own party came from those who feared that he was too thoroughly\r\nidentified with Jefferson's policy to untie the knot in which the\r\nforeign relations of the country had become entangled. Of the 175\r\nelectoral votes, however, he received 122; but that was fewer by 39 than\r\nhad been cast for Jefferson four years before. Of the New England\r\nStates, Vermont alone gave him its votes, changing places with Rhode\r\nIsland, which had wheeled into line again with the Federalists.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1808-9, after Madison's election but before his\r\ninauguration, he had quietly conferred with Erskine, the British\r\nminister at Washington, upon the condition of affairs. Much was hoped\r\nfrom these conferences; but the end which they helped to bring about\r\nwas the reverse of what was hoped for. Could Madison have had his way,\r\nhe would probably have preferred that Congress should have left\r\nuntouched at that session the questions of embargo and non-intercourse;\r\nfor the tone of the debates and the tendency of legislation naturally\r\nled the English ministry to doubt the assurances which Erskine gave that\r\nthese proceedings did not truly represent the friendly disposition of\r\nthe incoming President. In answer to those representations, however,\r\nthere came in April from Canning, the foreign secretary, certain\r\npropositions which were so presented by Erskine, and so received by the\r\nadministration, as to promise a settlement of all differences between\r\nthe two governments. Erskine was a young man, anxious very likely for\r\ndistinction; but a laudable ambition to be of service in a good cause\r\nmade him over-zealous. He exceeded the letter of his instructions, while\r\nkeeping, as he thought, to their spirit. Probably he mistook their\r\nspirit in assuming that his government cared more to secure a settlement\r\nof existing difficulties than for the precise terms and minor details by\r\nwhich it should be reached. At any rate, he agreed that Great Britain\r\nwould withdraw her orders in council provided the United States would\r\nmaintain the non-intercourse acts against France so long as the Berlin\r\nand Milan decrees remained in force. This being secured, he did not\r\ninsist upon two other conditions--partly because it was represented to\r\nhim that they would need some action by Congress, and partly because he\r\nbelieved that the essential point was gained by an agreement on the part\r\nof the United States to enforce non-intercourse against France while her\r\ndecrees were unrepealed. These other conditions were, first, that the\r\nUnited States should cease to insist upon the right to carry on in time\r\nof war the colonial trade of a belligerent which had not been open in\r\ntime of peace to neutrals; and, second, the acknowledgment that British\r\nmen-of-war might rightfully seize American merchant vessels when\r\ntransgressing the non-intercourse laws against France. He also proposed\r\na settlement of the Chesapeake question, but omitted to say, as Canning\r\nhad instructed him to say, that some provision would be made, as an act\r\nof generosity and not of right, for the wives and children of the men\r\nwho were killed on board that ship. But when that settlement was\r\naccepted by the administration, he failed to resent some reflections\r\nfrom Robert Smith, the secretary of state, on the conduct of Great\r\nBritain in that affair, which Canning, when he heard of them, thought\r\nshould have been resented and their recall demanded, or the negotiation\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nOn the terms, however, as Erskine chose to present them, an agreement\r\nwas reached, and the President issued a proclamation repealing the acts\r\nof embargo and non-intercourse as against Great Britain and her colonies\r\nafter June 10. On that day more than a thousand ships, loaded and\r\nriding at anchor in all the principal ports in anxious readiness for\r\nthe signal for flight, spread their wings, like a flock of\r\nlong-imprisoned birds, and flew out to sea. There was an almost\r\nuniversal shout of gratitude to the new President, who, in the first\r\nthree months of his administration, had banished the fear of war abroad,\r\nand at home was sweeping away involuntary idleness, want, and ominous\r\ndiscontent. Madison had known something of popularity during his long\r\ncareer; but never before had he felt the exultation of riding upon the\r\nvery crest of a mighty wave of popular applause. But it was one of those\r\nwaves that collapse suddenly into a surprising flatness. Canning\r\nrepudiated all that Erskine had done and immediately recalled him. The\r\nships that had gone to sea, under the sanction of the President's\r\nproclamation, were permitted by an order in council to complete their\r\nvoyages unmolested; but otherwise all commerce was once more brought to\r\na standstill. It would have been easier to bear some fresh misfortune\r\nthan to be compelled to struggle again with calamities so well\r\nunderstood and which it was hoped had been left behind forever. Gallatin\r\nhad been retained in the Treasury Department and was the President's\r\nchief adviser, and the two were now accused of having been either\r\nimbecile or treacherous. It was openly said that they had led the young\r\nminister to agree to an arrangement which they knew his government would\r\nnot sanction. But they could hardly have been so foolish as to make a\r\nbargain with the certainty that it would stand only so long as a ship\r\ncould go and come across the Atlantic. Nobody understood better than\r\nMadison how grateful a reconciliation with England would be to a large\r\nproportion of the people, and nobody was more disappointed that the\r\nnegotiations came to worse than nothing, inasmuch as their failure led\r\nto new embarrassments.\r\n\r\nHe said with some bitterness, in a letter to Jefferson, early in August:\r\n\"You will see by the instructions to Erskine, as published by Canning,\r\nthat the latter was as much determined that there should be no\r\nadjustment as the former was that there should be one.\" He was unjust to\r\nCanning; the real fault was with Erskine, and with him only because his\r\nzeal outran his judgment. In another letter to Jefferson, the President\r\nsays: \"Erskine is in a ticklish situation with his government. I suspect\r\nhe will not be able to defend himself against the charges of exceeding\r\nhis instructions, notwithstanding the appeal he makes to sundry others\r\nnot published. But he will make out a strong case against Canning, and\r\nbe able to avail himself much of the absurdity and evident\r\ninadmissibility of the articles disregarded by him.\" Possibly Mr.\r\nErskine considered that his government would approve of his not urging\r\nthese points too earnestly, inasmuch as the other side refrained from\r\ninsisting upon the abandonment of impressment of seamen on board\r\nAmerican ships. But Mr. Madison's indignation must have covered up a\r\ngood deal of mortification. He could hardly have been without the\r\nsensation of one hoisted by his own petard. It was only two years since\r\nMr. Jefferson, with his approval, had rejected the Monroe-Pinkney treaty\r\nbecause instructions had not been literally complied with. Mr. Canning,\r\nin following that example, could have pleaded, had he chosen, much the\r\nstronger justification, under the circumstances of the two cases; and\r\nMr. Madison could not fail to remember, without being reminded of it,\r\nwhen this agreement was thrown back in his face, that he had been\r\nwilling to accept it without any protection of the rights of American\r\nseamen, the want of which was the ostensible reason for rejecting the\r\nMonroe-Pinkney treaty.\r\n\r\nHowever, the administration was now compelled to meet anew the old\r\ndifficulties which the Erskine agreement had failed to dispose of. The\r\nPresident's first duty was to issue a second proclamation, recalling the\r\nprevious one which had sent to sea every American ship in port. They\r\ncould all come back, if they would, to be made fast again at their\r\nwharves, till the recurrent tides at last should ripple in and out of\r\ntheir open seams, and their yards and masts drop piecemeal upon the\r\nrotting decks. But many never came back, preferring rather the risk of\r\nbeing sunk or burned at sea, which happened to not a few, or of capture\r\nand confiscation by the belligerents whose laws they defied. Erskine was\r\nfollowed by a new ambassador from England, Mr. Jackson. His mission,\r\nhowever, had no other result than to widen the breach between the two\r\nnations. A controversy almost immediately arose between the minister and\r\nMr. Smith, the secretary of state,--or rather Mr. Madison himself, who,\r\nas he complained at a later period, did most of Smith's work as well as\r\nhis own,--touching the arrangement with Erskine. Jackson intimated, or\r\nwas understood as intimating, that the administration must have known\r\nthe precise terms on which Erskine was empowered to treat with the\r\ngovernment of the United States; and when a denial was made with a good\r\ndeal of emphasis on the part of the administration, the insinuation was\r\nrepeated almost as a direct charge. Of course there could be but one\r\nconclusion to correspondence of this sort; further communication with\r\nJackson was declined and his recall asked for.\r\n\r\nIt was plain enough in the latter months of Jefferson's administration,\r\nto himself as well as to everybody else, that the embargo had not only\r\nfailed to bring the belligerents to terms abroad, but that it had added\r\ngreatly to the distress at home. That the measure was a failure, Madison\r\nhimself acknowledged in one of his retrospective letters written in the\r\nretirement of Montpellier, sixteen years afterward. It was meant, he\r\nsaid in that letter, as an experimental measure, preferable to naked\r\nsubmission or to war at a time when war was inexpedient. It failed, he\r\nadded, \"because the government did not sufficiently distrust those in a\r\ncertain quarter whose successful violation of the law led to the general\r\ndiscontent, which called for its repeal.\" That is to say, the government\r\nrelied too confidently upon the submission of New England; was too ready\r\nto believe that her merchants would not let their ships slip quietly out\r\nto sea whenever they could evade the officers of the customs, nor slip\r\nin to land a cargo at some unfrequented place where there was no\r\ncustom-house. \"The patriotic fishermen of Marblehead,\" he says, \"at one\r\ntime offered their services;\" and he regrets they were not sent out as\r\nprivateers to seize these contraband ships as prizes, and to \"carry them\r\ninto ports where the tribunals would enforce the law.\" Apparently there\r\nwas not a reasonable doubt in his mind whether such tribunals could be\r\nfound in any port along the coast of New England. It is also rather more\r\nthan doubtful--even assuming that there was much of the kind of\r\npatriotism which he says existed in Marblehead--how long, had the\r\ngovernment offered commissions to private citizens to prey upon their\r\nneighbors, the embargo would have been respected at all east of Long\r\nIsland Sound. But this was the afterthought of 1826. Madison's policy in\r\n1809-10 was rather to conciliate than provoke \"those in a certain\r\nquarter.\" He could not command entire unanimity even in his own party.\r\nCongress passed the winter in vain efforts to find some common ground,\r\nnot merely for Democrats and Federalists, but for the Democrats alone.\r\nVarious measures were proposed to meet the critical condition of the\r\ncountry. Some were too radical; some not radical enough; and none were\r\nso acceptable that it was not easy to form combinations for their\r\ndefeat. All were agreed that the non-importation act must be got rid of;\r\nbut the difficulty was to find a way to be rid of it so that the nation\r\nshould at once maintain its dignity, assert its rights, and escape a\r\nwar. The President would have preferred that all British and French\r\nships be excluded from American ports, and that importations from both\r\ncountries should be prohibited except in American vessels; and a bill to\r\nthis effect was one of several that was defeated in the course of the\r\nsession. But at last, in May (1810), an act was passed excluding only\r\nthe men-of-war of both nations, but suspending the non-importation act\r\nfor three months after the adjournment of Congress. The President was\r\nthen authorized, when the three months were passed, to declare the act\r\nagain in force against either Great Britain or France, should the\r\ncommercial orders or decrees of either nation be continued in force\r\nwhile those of the other were repealed.\r\n\r\nIf the aim of the dominant party had been to devise a scheme sure to\r\nlead to fresh complications more difficult to manage than any that had\r\ngone before, it could not have hit upon a better one than this.\r\nHitherto, in all the perplexities and anxieties of the situation, the\r\ngovernment had, at least, kept its relations to other powers in its own\r\nhands, to conduct them, whether wisely or unwisely, in its own way. It\r\ncould resent or submit to encroachments upon the commerce of the\r\ncountry, as seemed most prudent; it could close or open the ports, as\r\nseemed most judicious; or it could join forces with that one of its two\r\nenemies whose alliance promised to secure respect on the one hand, and\r\ncompel it on the other. But now it had tied itself up in a knot of\r\nprovisos. It would do something if England would do something else, or\r\nif France would do something else. If the proposition was accepted by\r\nEngland and was not accepted by France, then the United States would\r\nremain in friendly relations with England, and assume by comparison an\r\nunfriendly attitude toward France; and if France accepted the condition\r\nand England declined it, then the situation would be reversed. Nothing\r\nwould be gained in either case that might not have been gained by direct\r\nnegotiation, and, no doubt, on better terms. But if the proposition now\r\noffered should be disregarded by both powers, the situation would be\r\nworse than before. This evidently was Madison's view of the question. He\r\nwrote to Pinkney, the minister at the Court of St. James, a month after\r\nthe act was passed: \"At the next meeting of Congress, it will be found,\r\naccording to present appearances, that instead of an adjustment with\r\neither of the belligerents, there is an increasing obstinacy in both;\r\nand that the inconveniences of embargo and non-intercourse have been\r\nexchanged for the greater sacrifices, as well as disgrace, resulting\r\nfrom a submission to the predatory system in force.\" Not that he wanted\r\nwar; his faith in passive resistance was still unshaken; embargo and\r\nnon-intercourse he was still confident would, if persisted in long\r\nenough, surely bring the belligerents to terms. But as to this act, he\r\nweighs the chances as in a balance. In England some impression may be\r\nmade by the prices of cotton and tobacco,--\"cotton down at ten or eleven\r\ncents in Georgia; and the great mass of tobacco in the same situation.\"\r\nHe has, however, no \"very favorable expectations.\" But as to France, he\r\nevidently is not without hope that she will be wise enough to see that\r\n\"she ought at once to embrace the arrangement held out by Congress, the\r\nrenewal of a non-intercourse with Great Britain being the very species\r\nof resistance most analogous to her professed views.\" But he was clearly\r\nnot sanguine.\r\n\r\nIf that was his wish, however, it was gratified. Napoleon did take\r\nadvantage of the act, but in such a way as to reverse the relative\r\npositions of the two nations by seizing for France and taking from the\r\nUnited States the power or the will to dictate terms. The French\r\nminister, Champagny, announced in a letter merely, in August, the\r\nrevocation of the Berlin and Milan decrees from the 1st of the following\r\nNovember; and, a day or two after, such new restrictions were imposed\r\nupon American trade, by prohibitory duties and a navigation act, as\r\npretty much to ruin what little there was left of it. The revocation of\r\nthe edicts, moreover, was coupled with the conditions that Great Britain\r\nshould not only recall her order in council, but renounce her \"new\r\nprinciples of blockade,\" or that the United States should \"cause their\r\nrights to be respected by the English.\" Napoleon had in this three ends\r\nto gain, and he gained them all: First, to secure France against a\r\nrenewal of the non-importation act of the United States, if the\r\nPresident should accept this conditional recall of the decrees as\r\nsatisfactory; second, to leave those decrees virtually unrepealed, by\r\nmaking their recall depend upon the action of England, who, he well\r\nknew, would not listen to the proposed conditions; and, third, to\r\ninvolve the United States and England in new disputes, which might lead\r\nto war. Everything turned out as the emperor wished. The President\r\naccepted the conditional withdrawal of the French decrees, as in\r\naccordance with the act of Congress; England refused to recognize a\r\ncontingent withdrawal as a withdrawal at all; and the result at length\r\nwas war between England and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe acquiescence of the President in the decision of Napoleon was the\r\nmore significant inasmuch as Mr. Smith, the secretary of state, had\r\nassured the French government, when a copy of the act of May was sent to\r\nit, that there could be no negotiation under the act until another\r\nmatter was disposed of. A decree, issued at Rambouillet in March, 1810,\r\nand enforced in May, ordered the confiscation of all American ships then\r\ndetained in the ports of France, and in Spanish, Dutch, and Neapolitan\r\nports under the control of France. The loss to American merchants,\r\nincluding ships and cargoes, was estimated to be about forty million\r\ndollars. This decree was ostensibly in retaliation of that act of\r\nnon-intercourse passed by Congress more than a year before, and was,\r\ntherefore, a retrospective law. The non-intercourse act, moreover, had\r\nexpired by its own limitation months before many of these ships were\r\nseized; but all, nevertheless, were confiscated, though some of them had\r\nentered the ports merely for shelter. By order of the President, Smith\r\nwrote to Armstrong, the American minister at Paris, that \"a satisfactory\r\nprovision for restoring the property lately surprised and seized, by the\r\norder or at the instance of the French government, must be combined with\r\na repeal of the French edicts, with a view to a non-intercourse with\r\nGreat Britain; such a provision being an indispensable evidence of the\r\njust purpose of France toward the United States.\" The injunction was\r\nrepeated a few weeks later; but when the emperor's decision upon the\r\ndecrees was announced, in August, the \"indispensable\" was dispensed\r\nwith, and a few months later an absolute refusal of any compensation for\r\nthe spoliation under the Rambouillet decree was quietly submitted to.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the President, in November, issued a proclamation\r\nannouncing that France had complied with the act of the previous May and\r\nrevoked the decrees, while the English orders in council remained\r\nunrepealed. But England still had three months, according to the act, in\r\nwhich to make her choice between a recall of her orders in council or\r\nthe alternative of seeing the American non-intercourse act revived\r\nagainst her. But, it is to be observed, the French minister's\r\nannouncement of the acceptance of the act of May was not made till\r\nAugust, and then the revocation of the decrees was not to take effect\r\ntill November. November came bringing with it the President's\r\nproclamation, when it soon appeared that there was still to be \"tarrying\r\nin the eating of the cake.\" The decrees were to remain in force at least\r\nthree months longer, till it should be known whether Great Britain would\r\ncomply with those terms which France--not the United States--made the\r\ncondition of revoking the orders in council; and if Great Britain did\r\nnot comply, then the French decrees were not revoked. The legality of\r\nthe President's proclamation, of course, was questioned. There was, as\r\nJosiah Quincy said in debate in the House, the following February\r\n(1811), \"a continued seizure of all the vessels which came within the\r\ngrasp of the French custom-house, from the 1st of November down to the\r\ndate of our last accounts.\" Other members, not more earnest, were less\r\ntemperate in the expression of their indignation at what, one of them\r\nsaid, would be called swindling in the conduct of private affairs;\r\nwhile another declared that the President was throwing the people \"into\r\nthe embrace of that monster at whose perfidy Lucifer blushed and hell\r\nstands astonished.\" France knew all this while what England's decision\r\nwould be. She was ready to rescind the orders in council when the French\r\nedicts were revoked, but she did not recognize a mere letter from the\r\nFrench minister, Champagny, to the American ambassador as such\r\nrevocation. The second French condition, that England should abandon her\r\n\"new principles of blockade\" and accept in their place a new French\r\nprinciple, was peremptorily rejected by the English ministry. That\r\nproposition opened a question not properly belonging to an agreement\r\ntouching the decrees and orders,--a question of what was a blockade, and\r\nwhat could properly be subject to it. Napoleon's doctrine was, not only\r\nthat a paper blockade was not permissible by the law of nations, but\r\nthat there could be no right of blockade \"to ports not fortified, to\r\nharbors and mouths of rivers, which, according to reason and the usage\r\nof civilized nations, is applicable only to strong or fortified places.\"\r\nMr. Emott, a member of the House from New York, said in debate that the\r\nUnited States might well be grateful to both England and France, if they\r\nwould agree upon this doctrine as good international law; since in that\r\ncase, as there were no fortified places in the United States, she would\r\nnever be in peril of a blockade. But it was precisely what England\r\nwould not admit nor even discuss as relevant to an agreement to revoke\r\nthe orders and decrees.\r\n\r\nTo \"this curious gallamatry,\" as Quincy called it, \"of time present and\r\ntime future, of doing and refraining to do, of declaration and\r\nunderstanding of English duties and American duties,\" was added another\r\ningredient of Madison's own devising. The American ministers in England\r\nand France were instructed that Great Britain would be expected to\r\ninclude in the revocation of her orders in council the blockade of a\r\nportion of the coast of France, declared in May, 1806; and the President\r\noffered, unasked, a pledge to the French emperor, that this should be\r\ninsisted upon. Whether he meant to make it easier for Napoleon and\r\nharder for Great Britain to respond to the act of May is a question\r\nimpossible to answer; but the opponents of the policy he was pursuing\r\nwere careful to point out that the act of May said nothing whatever,\r\neither of this or any other blockade; that when, the year before, the\r\nagreement was made with Erskine, the President did not pretend that the\r\norders in council included blockades; and that it was remarkable that he\r\nshould forget his own declaration regarding the monstrous spoliation of\r\na few months before by the French, under the Rambouillet decree, and yet\r\nremember this British order of blockade of four years before, which\r\neverybody else had forgotten. Indeed, so completely had it passed out of\r\nmind, that the American minister in London, Mr. Pinkney, was obliged to\r\nask the British foreign secretary whether that order had been revoked or\r\nwas still considered as in force. It had never been formally withdrawn,\r\nwas the answer, though it had been comprehended in the subsequent order\r\nin council of January, 1807. England refused, however, to recall\r\nspecifically this blockade of 1806, for that would have been construed\r\nas a recognition of Napoleon's right to demand an abandonment of her\r\n\"new principles of blockade;\" but in fact--as the British minister in\r\nWashington afterward acknowledged--the recall of the order in council of\r\n1807 would have annulled the order of blockade of 1806, which it had\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the whole negotiation was a trial of skill at diplomatic\r\nfence, in which England would not yield an inch to the United States or\r\nto France. Madison and his party were more than willing to aid Napoleon;\r\nand Napoleon hoped to defeat both his antagonists by turning their\r\nswords against each other. A quite different result would have followed\r\nhad France been as willing as England apparently was that the commercial\r\nedicts should be considered without regard to other questions; or if the\r\nAmerican Executive had insisted that it would accept their unconditional\r\nrevocation, pure and simple and not otherwise, from either power, as was\r\ncontemplated in the act of May, 1810. But instead, when Congress rose in\r\nMarch, 1811, it left behind it an act renewing non-intercourse with\r\nEngland, in accordance with Napoleon's demand that the United States\r\nshould \"cause their rights to be respected by the English.\" This meant\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWAR WITH ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, 1811, there occurred one of those accidents which happen on\r\npurpose, and often serve as a relief when the public temper is in an\r\nexasperated and almost dangerous condition. This was the fight between\r\nthe American frigate President, of forty-four guns, and the English\r\nsloop-of-war Little Belt, of eighteen guns. This vessel belonged to the\r\nBritish squadron which was ordered to the American coast to break up the\r\ntrade from the United States to France; and the President was one of the\r\nfew ships the government had for the protection of its commerce. The\r\nships met a few miles south of Sandy Hook, chased each other in turn,\r\nthen fired into each other without any reasonable pretext for the first\r\nshot, which each accused the other of having fired. The loss on board\r\nthe English ship, in an encounter which lasted only a few minutes, was\r\nover thirty in killed and wounded, while only a single man was slightly\r\nwounded on board the President. It was, as Mr. Madison said, an\r\n\"occurrence not unlikely to bring on repetitions,\" and that these would\r\n\"probably end in an open rupture or a better understanding, as the\r\ncalculations of the British government may prompt or dissuade from war.\"\r\nThis certainly was obvious enough; though it would be a great deal\r\neasier for England to bring on a war than to avert it, in the angry mood\r\nin which the majority of the Democratic party then was. But Mr. Madison\r\npreserved his equanimity. Considering his old proclivity for France, and\r\nhis old dislike of England, his impartiality between them is rather\r\nremarkable. But his aim was still to keep the peace while he abated\r\nnothing of the well-founded complaints he had against both powers. When\r\na new Congress assembled in the autumn he was careful to point out in\r\nhis message the delinquencies of France as well as the offenses of\r\nEngland. He insisted that while England should have acknowledged the\r\nBerlin and Milan decrees to be revoked and have acted accordingly,\r\nFrance showed no disposition to repair the many wrongs she had inflicted\r\nupon American merchants, and had lately imposed such \"rigorous and\r\nunexpected restrictions\" upon commerce that it would be necessary,\r\nunless they were speedily discontinued, to meet them by \"corresponding\r\nrestrictions on importations from France.\"\r\n\r\nThis tone is even more pronounced in his letters for some following\r\nmonths. If anything, it is France rather than England that seems to be\r\nlooked upon as the chief offender, with whom there was the greater\r\ndanger of armed collision. A fortnight after Congress had assembled he\r\nwrote to Barlow, the new minister to France, that though justified in\r\nassuming the French decrees to be so far withdrawn that a withdrawal of\r\nthe British orders might be looked for, \"yet the manner in which the\r\nFrench government has managed the repeal of the decrees, and evaded a\r\ncorrection of other outrages, has mingled with the conciliatory tendency\r\nof the repeal as much of irritation and disgust as possible.\" \"In fact,\"\r\nhe adds, \"without a systematic change from an appearance of crafty\r\ncontrivance and insatiate cupidity, for an open, manly, and upright\r\ndealing with a nation whose example demands it, it is impossible that\r\ngood-will can exist; and that the ill-will which her policy aims at\r\ndirecting against her enemy should not, by her folly and iniquity, be\r\ndrawn off against herself.\" French depredations upon American commerce\r\nin the Baltic were \"kindling a fresh flame here,\" and, if they were not\r\nstopped, \"hostile collisions will as readily take place with one nation\r\nas the other;\" nor would there be any hesitation in sending American\r\nfrigates to that sea, \"with orders to suppress by force the French and\r\nDanish depredations,\" were it not for the \"danger of rencounters with\r\nBritish ships of superior force in that quarter.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, Congress, under the lead of younger, vigorous\r\nmen--chief among them Clay and Calhoun--panting for leadership and\r\ndistinction, was beginning its clamor for war with England. How much\r\nrespect had Madison for this movement, and how much faith in it? A\r\nletter to Jefferson of February 7 answers both questions. Were he not\r\nevidently amused, he would seem to be contemptuous. \"To enable the\r\nExecutive to step at once into Canada,\" he says, \"they have provided,\r\nafter two months' delay, for a regular force requiring twelve to raise\r\nit, and after three months for a volunteer force, on terms not likely to\r\nraise it at all for that object. The mixture of good and bad, avowed and\r\ndisguised motives, accounting for these things, is curious enough, but\r\nnot to be explained in the compass of a letter.\" This is not the tone of\r\neither hope or fear. If war was in his mind at that time, it was not war\r\nwith England. Three weeks later he writes to Barlow at Paris. On various\r\npoints of negotiation between that minister and the French government,\r\nhe observes much that \"suggests distrust rather than expectation.\" He\r\ncomplains of delay, of vagueness, of neglect, of discourtesy, of a\r\ndisregard of past obligations as to the liberation of ships and cargoes\r\nseized, and of late condemnations of ships captured in the Baltic; and\r\nconcerning all these and other grievances he says: \"We find so little of\r\nexplicit dealing or substantial redress mingled with the compliments and\r\nencouragements, which cost nothing because they mean nothing, that\r\nsuspicions are unavoidable; and if they be erroneous, the fault does not\r\nlie with those who entertain them.\" He believed that France, in asking\r\nfor a new treaty, which he thinks unnecessary, is only seeking to gain\r\ntime in order to take advantage of future events. The commercial\r\nrelations between the two countries are so intolerable that trade \"will\r\nbe prohibited if no essential change take place.\" Unless there be\r\nindemnity for the great wrongs committed under the Rambouillet decree,\r\nand for other spoliations, he declares that \"there can be neither\r\ncordiality nor confidence here; nor any restraint from self-redress in\r\nany justifiable mode of effecting it.\" The letter concludes with the\r\nemphatic assertion that, if dispatches soon looked for \"do not exhibit\r\nthe French government in better colors than it has yet assumed, there\r\nwill be but one sentiment in this country; and I need not say what that\r\nwill be.\"\r\n\r\nCongress all this while was lashing itself into fury against England.\r\nThe ambitious young leaders of the Democratic party in the House were,\r\nso to speak, \"spoiling for a fight,\" and they chose to have it out with\r\nEngland rather than with France. Not that there was not quite as much\r\nreason for resentment against France as against England. Some, indeed,\r\nof the more hot-headed were anxious for war with both; but these were of\r\nthe more impulsive kind, like Henry Clay, who laughed in scorn at the\r\ndoubt that he could not at a blow subdue the Canadas with a few\r\nregiments of Kentucky militia. But war with England was determined upon,\r\npartly because the old enmity toward her made that intolerable which to\r\nthe old affection for France was a burden lightly borne; and partly\r\nbecause the instinctive jealousy of the commercial interest, on the part\r\nof the planter-interest, preferred that policy which would do the most\r\nharm to the North. On April 1, 1812, just five weeks after the writing\r\nof this letter to Barlow, Mr. Madison sent to Congress a message of five\r\nlines recommending the immediate passage of an act to impose \"a general\r\nembargo on all vessels now in port or hereafter arriving for the period\r\nof sixty days.\" It was meant to be a secret measure; but the intention\r\nleaked out in two or three places, and the news was hurried North by\r\nseveral of the Federalist members in time to enable some of their\r\nconstituents to send their ships to sea before the act was passed. Nor,\r\nprobably, was it a surprise to anybody; for war with England had been\r\nthe topic of debate in one aspect or another all winter, and the purpose\r\nof the party in power was plain to everybody. That the embargo was\r\nintended as a preparation for war was frankly acknowledged. An act was\r\nspeedily passed, though the period was extended from sixty to ninety\r\ndays. Within less than sixty days, however, another message from the\r\nPresident recommended a declaration of war. On June 3 the Committee on\r\nForeign Relations, of which Calhoun was chairman, reported in favor of\r\n\"an immediate appeal to arms,\" and the next day a declaratory act was\r\npassed. Of the seventy-nine affirmative votes in the House, forty-eight\r\nwere from the South and West, and of the other thirty-one votes from the\r\nNorthern States, fourteen were from Pennsylvania alone. Of the\r\nforty-nine votes against it, thirty-four were from the Northern States,\r\nincluding two from Pennsylvania. On the 17th, a fortnight later, the\r\nbill was got through the Senate by a majority of six.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison for years had opposed a war with England as unwise and\r\nuseless,--unwise, because the United States was not in a condition to go\r\nto war with the greatest naval power in the world; and useless, because\r\nthe end to be reached by war could be gained more certainly, and at\r\ninfinitely less cost, by peaceful measures. The situation had not\r\nchanged. Indeed, up to within a month of the message recommending an\r\nembargo as a precursor of war, his letters show that, if he thought war\r\nwas inevitable, it must be with France, not England. But the faction\r\ndetermined upon war must have at their command an administration to\r\ncarry out that policy. Their choice was not limited to Madison for an\r\navailable candidate. Whoever was nominated by the Democrats was sure to\r\nbe chosen, and Madison had two formidable rivals in James Monroe,\r\nsecretary of state, and De Witt Clinton, mayor of New York, both eager\r\nfor war. The choice depended on that question and between the embargo\r\nmessage of April 1 and the war message of June 1, the nomination was\r\ngiven to Madison by the congressional caucus. It was understood, and\r\nopenly asserted at the time by the opponents of the administration,\r\nthat the nomination was the price of a change of policy. At the next\r\nsession of Congress, before a year had passed away, Mr. Quincy said in\r\nthe House: \"The great mistake of all those who reasoned concerning the\r\nwar and the invasion of Canada, and concluded that it was impossible\r\nthat either should be seriously intended, resulted from this, that they\r\nnever took into consideration the connection of both those events with\r\nthe great election for the chief magistracy which was then pending. It\r\nwas never sufficiently considered by them that plunging into a war with\r\nGreat Britain was among the conditions on which the support for the\r\npresidency was made dependent.\" The assertion, so plainly aimed at\r\nMadison, passed unchallenged, though the charge of any distinct bargain\r\nwas vehemently denied.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Madison's conscience was not always vigorous enough to enable him\r\nto resist temptation, it was so sensitive as to prompt him to look for\r\nexcuses for yielding. In a sense this was to his credit as one of the\r\nbetter sort of politicians, without assuming it to be akin to that\r\nhypocrisy which is the homage vice pays to virtue. Perhaps it was this\r\nsentiment which led him to accept so readily the pretended disclosures\r\nof John Henry, and to make the use of them he did. These were contained\r\nin twenty-four letters, for which the President, apparently without\r\nhesitation, paid fifty thousand dollars. On March 9 he sent them to\r\nCongress with a message, and on the same day, in a letter to Jefferson,\r\nalludes to them as \"this discovery, or rather formal proof of the\r\ncoöperation between the Eastern Junto and the British cabinet.\" In the\r\nmessage he intimates that this secret agent was sent directly by the\r\nBritish government to Massachusetts to foment disaffection, to intrigue\r\n\"with the disaffected for the purpose of bringing about resistance to\r\nthe laws, and eventually, in concert with a British force, of destroying\r\nthe Union\" and reannexing the Eastern States to England. In the war\r\nmessage of June 1 these charges are repeated as among the reasons for an\r\nappeal to arms. Mr. Calhoun's committee followed this lead and improved\r\nupon it in the report recommending an immediate declaration of war. The\r\nHenry affair was declared an \"act of still greater malignity\" than any\r\nof the other outrages against the United States of which Great Britain\r\nhad been guilty, and that which \"excited the greatest horror.\" The\r\nincident was seized upon, apparently, to answer a temporary purpose, and\r\nthen, so far as Mr. Madison was concerned, was permitted to sink into\r\noblivion. In the hundreds of pages of his published letters, written in\r\nlater life, in which he reviews and explains so many of the events of\r\nhis public career, there is no allusion whatever to the Henry\r\ndisclosures, which in 1812 were held, with the ruin of American commerce\r\nand the impressment of thousands of American citizens, as an equally\r\njust cause for war. In truth there was nothing whatever in these\r\ndisclosures, for which was paid an amount equal to the salary of half a\r\npresidential term, to warrant the assumptions of either Mr. Madison's\r\nmessages or Mr. Calhoun's report. The man had been sent, at his own\r\nsuggestion, early in 1809, by the governor of Canada to Massachusetts to\r\nlearn the state of affairs there and observe the drift of public\r\nopinion. His national proclivity--he was an Irishman--to conspiracy and\r\nrevolution had led him to see in the dissatisfaction with the embargo a\r\ndetermination in the New England people to destroy the Union, reannex\r\nthemselves to England, and return to the flesh-pots of the colonial\r\nperiod. To learn how far gone they were in these designs, to put himself\r\nin intimate relations with the leading conspirators and to bring them\r\ninto communication with Sir James Craig, the governor-general of Canada,\r\nthat sufficient aid should come through him at the proper moment from\r\nthe British government, was Henry's mission. Of this truly Irish plot\r\nHenry was the villain and Craig the fool; but it is hardly possible that\r\nthree years afterward Madison and his friends, with all the letters\r\nspread before them, could really have been the dupes.\r\n\r\nHenry went to Boston and remained there about three months, living at a\r\ntavern. He found out nothing because there was nothing to be found out.\r\nHe knew nobody, and nobody of any note knew him, and all the information\r\nhe sent to Craig might have been, and doubtless was, picked up in the\r\nordinary political gossip of the tavern barroom, or culled from the\r\ncolumns of the newspapers of both parties. He compromised nobody,\r\nfor--as Mr. Monroe, as secretary of state, testified in a report to the\r\nSenate--he named no person or persons in the United States who had, \"in\r\nany way or manner whatever, entered into or countenanced the project or\r\nviews\" of himself and Craig; and all he had to say was pointless and\r\nunimportant, except so far as his opinions might have some interest as\r\nthose of a shrewd observer of public events. Indeed, his own conclusion\r\nwas that there was no conspiracy in the Eastern States; that the Federal\r\nparty was strong enough to keep the peace with England; and that there\r\nwas no talk of disunion, nor any likelihood of it unless it should be\r\nbrought about by war. The correspondence itself showed, in a letter from\r\nRobert Peel, then secretary to Lord Liverpool, that the letters of Henry\r\nwere found, as a matter of course, among Canadian official papers, as\r\nthey related to public affairs; but they had either never attracted any\r\nattention or had been entirely forgotten, and Lord Liverpool was quite\r\nignorant of any \"arrangement or agreement\" that had been made between\r\nthe governor of Canada and his emissary to New England. It was only\r\nbecause of his failure to get any reward from the British government or\r\nfrom Craig's successor in Canada, for what he was pleased to call his\r\nservices, that the adventurer came to Washington in search of a market\r\nfor himself and his papers. He came at an opportune moment.\r\nNotwithstanding the secretary of state frankly declared, that neither by\r\nwriting nor by word of mouth did the man implicate by name anybody in\r\nthe United States; notwithstanding one of the letters was evidence, the\r\nmore conclusive because incidental, that the British secretary of state\r\nhad known nothing of this mission contrived between Henry and\r\nCraig,--yet Mr. Madison pronounced the letters to be the \"formal proof\r\nof the coöperation between the Eastern Junto and the British cabinet.\"\r\nThe charge was monstrous, for this pretended proof had no existence. If\r\nthe President, however, could persuade himself that the story was true,\r\nit would help him to justify himself to himself for a change of policy,\r\nthe result of which would be the coveted renomination for the\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nNot that there had never been talk of disunion in New England. There had\r\nbeen in years past, as there was to be in years to come. But talk of\r\nthat kind did not belong exclusively to that particular period, nor was\r\nit confined to that particular region of country. Ever since the\r\nadoption of the Constitution the one thing that orators, North and\r\nSouth, inside the halls of Congress and outside them, were agreed upon\r\nwas, that in all debate there was one argument, equally good on both\r\nsides, to which there could be no reply; that in all legislation there\r\nwas one possible supreme move that would bring all the wheels of\r\ngovernment to a dead stop. The solemn warning or the angry threat was\r\nalways in readiness for instant use, that the bonds of the Union, in one\r\nor another contingency, were to be rent asunder. But so frequent had\r\nbeen these warning cries of the coming wolf that they were listened to\r\nwith indifference, except when some positive act indicated real danger,\r\nas in the Jefferson-Madison \"resolutions of '98.\" It was easy,\r\ntherefore, to alarm the public with confessions of a secret emissary, as\r\nhe pretended, who had turned traitor to the government which had\r\nemployed him and to the conspirators to whom he had been sent; and the\r\nmore reprehensible was it, therefore, in a President of the United\r\nStates, to make the use that was made of this story, which an impartial\r\nexamination would have shown was essentially absurd and infamously\r\nfalse. Mr. Madison's intelligence is not to be impugned. He was too\r\nsagacious, as well as too unimpassioned a man, to be taken in by the\r\ningenious tale of such an adventurer as Henry. In a letter to Colonel\r\nDavid Humphreys, written the next spring, in defense of the policy of\r\ncommercial restrictions, he says: \"I have never allowed myself to\r\nbelieve that the Union was in danger, or that a dissolution of it could\r\nbe desired, unless by a few individuals, if such there be, in desperate\r\nsituations or of unbridled passions.\" New England, he continues, \"would\r\nbe the greatest loser by such an event, and not likely therefore\r\ndeliberately to rush into it.\" \"On what basis,\" he asks, \"could New\r\nEngland and Old England form commercial stipulations?\" Their commercial\r\njealousy, he contends, forbade an alliance between them, for that was\r\n\"the real source of our Revolution.\" He closes with the significant\r\nassertion that, \"if there be links of common interest between the two\r\ncountries, they would connect the Southern and not the Northern States\r\nwith that part of Europe.\" How, then, could he seriously accept Henry's\r\npretended disclosures as \"formal proof,\" as he wrote to Jefferson at\r\nthat time, \"of the coöperation between the Eastern Junto and the British\r\ncabinet\"? By the Eastern Junto is meant the Federal party, or at least\r\nthe influential and able leaders of that party; and he could not\r\nconsider, nor would he have spoken of them as \"a few individuals, if\r\nsuch there be, in desperate situations or of unbridled passions.\" He\r\naccepted, then, the Henry story in spite of his deliberate opinions, as\r\na help to involve the country in a party war.\r\n\r\nEven at the risk of some prolixity it is needful to follow the course of\r\nevents that led to this war a little farther; for here was the\r\nculmination of Mr. Madison's career, and from his course in shaping and\r\ndirecting these events we best learn what manner of man he was, and\r\nwhere his true place is among the public men of our earlier history. For\r\na year and a half the United States had acted on the assumption that\r\nFrance had recalled her decrees, and that England had not revoked her\r\norders. The extracts from Mr. Madison's letters, given on previous\r\npages, show his conviction that the revocation of either decrees or\r\norders was practically no more true of one power than it was of the\r\nother. The government of the United States, nevertheless, submitted to\r\nthe one, and against the other it first reënacted the non-intercourse\r\nact, then proclaimed an embargo preparatory to war, and finally declared\r\nwar. Yet the whole world knew, and nobody so surely as the emperor of\r\nFrance, that the Berlin and Milan decrees had never been formally\r\nrepealed at all; meanwhile French outrages upon American commerce had\r\ncontinued, and all redress so persistently refused that, so late as the\r\nlast week in February, 1812, the President intimated that war--war with\r\nFrance, not England--might prove the only remedy. But he suddenly\r\nyielded to the clamors of the war party at home, whatever may have been\r\nhis motive. Then, and not till then, were the decrees actually revoked\r\nby Napoleon. In May, 1812, more than a month after the President had\r\nrecommended an embargo, the hostile purport of which was so well\r\nunderstood, a decree was proclaimed by the emperor which for the first\r\ntime really revoked those of Berlin and Milan. True, it was\r\ndated--\"purported to be dated,\" it was said in an official English\r\ndocument--April, 1811. But that was of no moment; the essential point\r\nwas, that it had never seen the light; that any hint of its existence\r\nhad never been given to the American government, or its representatives\r\nabroad, till the United States had taken measures to \"cause their rights\r\nto be respected by the English,\" which was the original condition of a\r\nrevocation of the decrees. Its ostensible date was when the news reached\r\nFrance that non-intercourse had been again enforced against England in\r\nMarch, 1811; but its promulgation was to all intents and purposes the\r\nreal date, when news reached France, in April or May, 1812, that war\r\nagainst England was finally determined upon.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bassano, the French minister, had not, moreover, brought out\r\nthis year-old decree without pressure from the American minister,\r\nBarlow. The President had written Barlow, in that February letter\r\nalready quoted, that if his expected dispatches did not \"exhibit the\r\nconduct of the French government in better colors than it has yet\r\nassumed, there will be but one sentiment in this country, and I need not\r\nsay what that will be.\" When the dispatches came, Mr. Madison received\r\nno assurances of redress for past wrongs and no promises for the future;\r\nbut he learned, on the contrary, that Bassano, in a recent report to the\r\nemperor, had referred to the decrees of Berlin and Milan as still in\r\nforce against all neutral nations which submitted to the seizure of\r\ntheir ships by the British when containing contraband goods or enemy's\r\nproperty. Naturally the British ministry was not slow in presenting this\r\nprecious acknowledgment to the United States as a proof that she had all\r\nalong been in the wrong, and that in common justice to England the\r\nnon-importation act should now be repealed. The assurance was at the\r\nsame time repeated, possibly in a tone of considerable satisfaction,\r\nthat when Napoleon really should revoke his decrees Great Britain was\r\nready, as she always had been, to follow his example with her orders. It\r\nwas an awkward dilemma for the President and his minister to France. But\r\nby this time, the Presidential nomination impending, Mr. Madison had\r\nmade up his mind what to do. He was not exactly a wolf; neither was\r\nGreat Britain a lamb; but the argument he used was the argument of the\r\nfable. Instead of advising--Bassano having declared the decrees still in\r\nforce--a repeal of the non-importation act, as Great Britain claimed was\r\nin justice and comity her due, he recommended a war measure. But Barlow\r\nevidently felt himself to be under some decent restraint of logic and\r\nconsistency. He urged upon the French minister the necessity now of a\r\npositive and imperial declaration that the decrees, so far as regarded\r\nthe United States, were absolutely revoked; for this recent assertion of\r\nBassano, that they were still in force, put the United States in an\r\nattitude both towards France and England utterly and absurdly in the\r\nwrong. Barlow represented that, should the revocation be extended only\r\nto the United States, Great Britain would not for that alone repeal her\r\norders. In that case France would lose nothing of the advantage of her\r\npresent position, while everything would be lost should the United\r\nStates be compelled to repeal her non-importation laws against England.\r\nBassano was quick to see the necessity of jumping into the bramble-bush\r\nand scratching his eyes in again, and he then produced his year-old\r\nedict. Being a year old, it of course covered all questions. But was it\r\na year old? Who knew? It had never been published? No, the duke said;\r\nbut it had been shown to Mr. Jonathan Russell, who at that time was\r\nchargé d'affaires at Paris. Mr. Russell denied it, though a denial was\r\nhardly needed. He would not have ventured to withhold information so\r\nimportant from his government; and it was evident, from the tone of his\r\ndispatches of a subsequent date, that he had no suspicion of its\r\nexistence. For he had maintained it, as a point of \"national honor,\"\r\nthat the revocation of the French decrees must have preceded the\r\nPresident's proclamation of November 1, 1810; and this he would not have\r\ndared to do had he known that the actual revocation by the French\r\nminister was not made till six months after the date of the President's\r\nproclamation, and was then made secretly.\r\n\r\nHowever, as if to defeat all these machinations of France and the United\r\nStates, Great Britain immediately recalled her orders in council, when,\r\nin May, 1812, the Duke of Bassano announced the edict of April, 1811,\r\nrevoking the Berlin and Milan decrees, though so far only as they\r\nconcerned American vessels. The declaration of war of June 18 had not\r\nreached England, and there was still a chance for peace. Foster, the\r\nlate English minister to the United States, learned at Halifax--where he\r\nhad stopped on his way home--that the orders in council were repealed,\r\nand he took immediate steps to bring about an armistice between the\r\nnaval commanders on the coast of Nova Scotia, and between the governor\r\nof Canada and the American general, Dearborn, in command of the\r\nfrontier. The government at Washington, however, refused to ratify any\r\nsuspension of hostilities. Some negotiations followed, but, decrees and\r\norders being out of the way, there was nothing left to negotiate about\r\nexcept the question of impressment. Upon that question the two\r\ngovernments were as wide apart as ever, and not in the least likely to\r\ncome together. Mr. Madison determined that on that ground alone the war\r\nshould go on. It had been as good and sufficient ground for such a war\r\nany time for the past dozen years; but whether it could be settled by an\r\nappeal to arms was a question of possibilities and probabilities by\r\nwhich both Jefferson and Madison had hitherto been ruled. Was that still\r\nthe essential question? With the result came the answer. Two years later\r\nthe administration was glad to accept a treaty of peace in which\r\nimpressment was not even alluded to. Great Britain did not relinquish by\r\na syllable her assumed right to board American ships in search of\r\nBritish seamen; and the administration instructed its peace\r\ncommissioners not even to ask that she should.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the war Mr. Madison said to a friend, in a letter \"altogether\r\n_private_ and written in confidence,\" that the way to make the conflict\r\nboth \"short and successful would be to convince the enemy that he was to\r\ncontend with the whole and not part of the nation.\" That it was a war of\r\na party, and not of the people, was a discouragement to himself, however\r\nthe enemy may have regarded it, which he could never see any way of\r\novercoming. He could not listen to an opponent nor learn anything from\r\ndisaster. \"If the war must continue,\" said Webster within a year of its\r\nend, \"go to the ocean. Let it no longer be said that not one ship of\r\nforce, built by your hands since the war, yet floats. If you are\r\nseriously contending for maritime rights, go to the theatre where those\r\nrights can be defended.... There the united wishes and exertions of the\r\nnation will go with you. Even our party divisions, acrimonious as they\r\nare, cease at the water's edge.... In protecting naval interests by\r\nnaval means, you will arm yourself with the whole power of national\r\nsentiment, and may command the whole abundance of national forces.\"\r\nTaking now in one view the events of those years, it is easy to see in\r\nour generation how mad were Madison and his party to turn deaf ears to\r\nsuch considerations as these. Their force and wisdom had already been\r\nproved by eighteen months of disaster on land, which had made the war\r\ndaily more and more unpopular; and by brilliant success for a time at\r\nsea, when each fresh victory was hailed with universal enthusiasm. \"Our\r\nlittle naval triumphs,\" was the President's way of speaking of the\r\nlatter; and the only importance he seems to have seen in them was, that\r\nthey excited some \"rage and jealousy\" in England and moved her to\r\nincrease her naval force. How could Mr. Madison expect that the whole\r\nand not a part only of the nation could uphold an administration which,\r\nafter eighteen months of fighting, could be reproached on the floor of\r\nCongress with not having launched a ship since the war was begun? Or did\r\nhe only choose to remember that the navy, which alone so far had brought\r\neither success or honor to the national arms, was the creation of the\r\nFederalists in spite of the Jeffersonian policy? It surely would have\r\nbeen wiser to try to propitiate New England, with which he was in\r\nperpetual worry and conflict, by enlisting it in a naval war in which it\r\nhad some faith. A large proportion of her people would have been glad to\r\nescape idleness and poverty at home for service at sea, though they were\r\nreluctant to aid in a vain attempt to conquer Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Battle of Lake Erie_]\r\n\r\nEven to that purpose, however, Massachusetts contributed, in the second\r\ncampaign of 1814, more recruits than any other single State; and New\r\nEngland more than all the Southern States together. New England could\r\nhave given no stronger proof of her loyalty, if only Mr. Madison had\r\nknown how to turn it to advantage. He was absolutely deaf and blind to\r\nit; but his ears were quick to hear and his eyes to see, when he learned\r\npresently that the New Englanders were seriously calculating the value\r\nof the Union under such rule as they had had of late. It was not often\r\nthat he relieved himself by intemperate language, but he could not help\r\nsaying now, in writing to Governor Nicholas of Virginia, that \"the\r\ngreater part of the people in that quarter have been brought by their\r\nleaders, aided by their priests, under a delusion scarcely exceeded by\r\nthat recorded in the period of witchcraft; and the leaders themselves\r\nare becoming daily more desperate in the use they make of it.\" The\r\n\"delusion\" was taking a practical direction. Mr. Madison had learned\r\nbefore the letter was written that a convention was about to meet at\r\nHartford, the object of which was to weigh in a balance, upon the one\r\nside, the continuation of such government as that of the last two or\r\nthree years, and, upon the other side, the value of the Union. He\r\nardently hoped that the commissioners, then assembled at Ghent, would\r\nagree upon a treaty; and there seemed to be no good reason why there\r\nshould not be peace when nothing was to be said of the cause of the\r\nwar, no apology demanded for the past, and no stipulation for the\r\nfuture. But if by any chance the commissioners should fail, Mr. Madison\r\nsaw in the Hartford Convention the huge shadow of a coming conflict more\r\ndifficult to deal with than a foreign war. It was the first step in dead\r\nearnest for the formation of a Northern Confederacy, and it is quite\r\npossible he may have felt that he was not the man for such a crisis.\r\nEvery line of the letter pulsates with anxiety. The only consoling\r\nthought in it is that without \"foreign coöperation revolt and separation\r\nwill hardly be risked,\" and to such coöperation he hoped a majority of\r\nthe New England people would not consent. A treaty of peace, however,\r\ncame to save him and the Union. Within a few weeks the administration\r\npapers were laughing at Harrison Gray Otis of Boston, who had started\r\nfor Washington as the representative of the Hartford Convention, but\r\nturned back at the news of peace; and were advertising him as missing\r\nunder the name of Titus Oates. It was, however, the hysterical laugh of\r\nrecovery from a terrible fright.\r\n\r\nIf ambition to be a second time President led Mr. Madison to consent\r\nagainst his own better judgment to a war with England, he paid a heavy\r\npenalty. It was the act of a party politician and not of a statesman;\r\nfor the country was no more prepared for a war in 1812, when as a\r\npolitician he assented to it, than it had been for the previous half\r\ndozen years when as a statesman he had opposed it. He gave the influence\r\nof the United States in support of a despotism that aimed at the\r\nsubjugation of all Europe; he threw a fresh obstacle in the way of that\r\npower to which Europe could chiefly look to resist a common enemy; and\r\nhe did both under the pretense that the just complaints of the United\r\nStates were greater against one of these powers than against the other.\r\nHe declared war mainly to redress a wrong which ceased to exist before a\r\nblow was struck; he then rejected an offer of peace because another\r\nwrong was still persisted in; but finally, of his own motion, he\r\naccepted a treaty in which the assumed cause of war was not even alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Madison was not a good war President, either by training or by\r\ntemperament, was, if it may be said of any man, his misfortune rather\r\nthan his fault. But it was his fault rather than his misfortune that he\r\npermitted himself to be dragged in a day into a line of conduct which\r\nthe sober judgment of years had disapproved. He is usually and most\r\njustly regarded as a man of great amiability of character; of\r\nunquestionable integrity in all the purely personal relations of life;\r\nof more than ordinary intellectual ability of a solid, though not\r\nbrilliant, quality; and a diligent student of the science of government,\r\nthe practice of which he made a profession. But he was better fitted by\r\nnature for a legislator than for executive office, and his fame would\r\nhave been more spotless, though his position would have been less\r\nexalted, had his life been exclusively devoted to that branch of\r\ngovernment for which he was best fitted. It was not merely that for the\r\nsake of the Presidency he plunged the country into an unnecessary war;\r\nbut when it was on his hands he neither knew what to do with it himself\r\nnor how to choose the right men who did know.\r\n\r\nIt is our amiable weakness--if one may venture to say so of the American\r\npeople--that all our geese are swans, or rather eagles; that we are apt\r\nto mistake notoriety for reputation; that it is the popular belief of\r\nthe larger number that he who, no matter how, has reached a\r\ndistinguished position, is by virtue of that fact a great and good man.\r\nThis is not less true, in a measure, of Mr. Madison than of some other\r\nmen who have been Presidents, and of still more who have thought that\r\nthey deserved to be. But, if that false estimate surrounds his name,\r\nthere is a strong undercurrent of opinion, common among those whose\r\nbusiness or whose pleasure it is to look beneath the surface of things\r\nhistorical, that he was wanting in strength of character and in courage.\r\nHe did not lack discernment as to what was wisest and best; but he was\r\ntoo easily influenced by others, or led by the hope of gaining some\r\nglittering prize which ambition coveted, to turn his back upon his own\r\nconvictions. It was this weakness which swept him beyond his depth into\r\ntroubled waters where his struggles were hopeless. Had he refused to\r\nassume the responsibility of a war which his judgment condemned, and\r\nwhich he should have known that he wanted the peculiar ability to bring\r\nto a successful and honorable conclusion, he might never have been\r\nPresident, but his fame would have been of a higher order. History might\r\nhave overlooked the act of political fickleness in his earlier career,\r\nwhich was so warmly resented by many of his contemporaries. Abandonment\r\nof party is too common and often too justifiable to be accounted as\r\nnecessarily a crime; and it can rarely be said with positiveness,\r\nwhatever the probabilities, that a political deserter is certainly moved\r\nby base motives. It is rather from _ex post facto_ than from immediate\r\nevidence, as in Madison's case, that a just verdict is likely to be\r\nreached. But there can be neither doubt nor mistake as to the\r\nPresident's management of foreign affairs during the two years preceding\r\nthe declaration of war against England; nor of the remarkable\r\nincompetence which he showed in rallying the moral and material forces\r\nof the nation to meet an emergency of his own creation.\r\n\r\nOpposition to war generally and therefore opposition to an army and navy\r\nwere sound cardinal principles in the Jeffersonian school of politics.\r\nMr. Madison was curiously blind to the logical consequences of this\r\ndoctrine; he could not see, or he would not consider, that, when war\r\nseemed advisable to an administration, the result must depend mainly\r\nupon the success of the appeal to the people for their countenance and\r\nhelp. But he unwisely sought to raise and employ an army for the\r\ninvasion and conquest of the territory of the enemy in spite of the\r\nopposition of a large proportion of the wealthiest and most intelligent\r\npeople in the country; while at the same time he refused to see any\r\npromise or any presage in a naval warfare which had opened with\r\nunexpected brilliancy, and would, had it been followed up, have been\r\nsure of popular support. His title to fame rests, with the multitude,\r\nupon the fact that he was one of the earlier Presidents of the republic.\r\nBut it is that period of his career which least entitles him to be\r\nremembered with gratitude and respect by his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIts crowning humiliation came with the capture of Washington in August,\r\n1814, when the British admiral, Cockburn, entered the Hall of\r\nRepresentatives, at the head of a band of followers, and springing into\r\nthe speaker's chair shouted: \"Shall this harbor of Yankee Democracy be\r\nburned? All for it will say, Aye!\" Early in the war Madison had written\r\nto Jefferson, \"We do not apprehend invasion by land,\"--the one thing, it\r\nwould seem, that a commander-in-chief should have apprehended, whose\r\nsingle aim was the invasion and conquest of the enemy's territory. His\r\ndevotion to this one purpose, to the exclusion of any other idea of\r\neither offense or defense, and in spite of continued failure, was almost\r\nan infatuation. Within a year of that expression of confidence to Mr.\r\nJefferson the whole coast was blockaded from the eastern end of Long\r\nIsland Sound to the mouth of the Mississippi. For a year before\r\nWashington was taken, the shores of Chesapeake Bay were harassed and\r\nraided and devastated by a blockading force, till the people were\r\nreduced almost to the condition of a conquered country. Two months\r\nbefore the British commanders, Ross and Cockburn, went up the Potomac,\r\nMr. Gallatin, who was then in London, had informed the President that\r\nthe fleet was to be reinforced for that very purpose; but neither he nor\r\nCongress took any effective measures to meet a danger so imminent. Their\r\neyes were fixed with a far-off gaze across the Northern border, while\r\nonly five hundred regular troops, a body of untrained militia who had\r\nnever heard the whistle of a bullet, and a few gunboats on the Potomac,\r\nguarded the national capital against a British fleet, a thousand\r\nmarines, and thirty-five hundred men from Wellington's best regiments.\r\nThe President fleeing in one direction with the secretary of war, the\r\nsecretary of state, and the general in command; Mrs. Madison fleeing in\r\nanother, with her reticule filled with silver spoons snatched up in\r\nhaste as she left the White House;[15] behind them all as they fled, the\r\nhorizon red with the blaze of the largest navy yard in the country and\r\nof all the public buildings, but one, of the capital,--these incidents\r\nare an amazing commentary on the early assertion that invasion was not\r\nto be apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe end of this wretched war, which has been foolishly called the second\r\nwar of independence, came four months afterward. Never was a peace so\r\nwelcome as this was on all sides. England was exhausted with the long\r\ncontest with Napoleon; and now, that being over, as there was no\r\npractical question to differ about with the United States, the ministry\r\nwere not unwilling to listen to the demands of the commercial and\r\nmanufacturing classes. In America so great was the universal joy that\r\nthe Federalists and the Democrats forgot their differences and their\r\nhates, and wept and laughed by turns in each other's arms and kissed\r\neach other like women. One party was delivered from calamities for\r\nwhich, if continued much longer, there seemed only one desperate and\r\ndreaded remedy; the other was overjoyed to back out of a blunder which\r\nwas the straight and broad road to national ruin. Of all men, Mr.\r\nMadison had the most reason to be glad for a safe deliverance from the\r\nconsequences of his own want of foresight and want of firmness. Less\r\nthan two years remained to him of his public career. In that brief\r\nperiod much was forgotten and more forgiven--as our national way is--in\r\nthe promise of a great prosperity to be speedily achieved in the\r\nreleased energies of a vigorous and industrious people. He had not again\r\nto choose between differing factions of his own party, nor to carry out\r\na policy against the will of a formidable opposition. To the Federalists\r\nhardly a name was left in the progress of events at home and abroad;\r\nwhile all immediate vital questions of difference vanished, the party in\r\npower remained in almost undisputed ascendency. The most important\r\nDemocratic measures it then insisted upon were a national bank and a\r\nprotective tariff. To the establishment of a bank Mr. Madison assented\r\nagainst his own conviction that any provision could be found for it in\r\nthe Constitution; and a tariff, both for revenue and for the protection\r\nand encouragement of American industry, he agreed with his party was the\r\ntrue policy.\r\n\r\nFor nearly twenty years after his retirement to Montpellier--a name\r\nwhich, with rare exceptions, he always spelled correctly, and not in the\r\nAmerican way--it was his privilege to live a watchful observer of the\r\nprosperity of his country. If it ever occurred to him in his secret soul\r\nthat at the period of his preëminence he had done anything to arrest\r\nthat prosperity, he gave no sign. He loved rather to remember and\r\nsometimes to recall to others the part he had taken in the nurture of\r\nthe young republic in the feeble days of its infancy. Of his own\r\nadministration and the events of that time he had much less to say than\r\nof the true interpretation of the Constitution, of the intent of its\r\nframers, and the circumstances that influenced their deliberations. His\r\nvoluminous correspondence shows the bent of his mind as a legislator and\r\na student of fundamental law; and on that, rather than on his ability\r\nand success as the chief magistrate of the nation, rests his true fame.\r\n\r\nThese twenty years, though passed in retirement, were not years of\r\nleisure. \"I have rarely,\" he wrote in 1827, \"during the period of my\r\npublic life, found my time less at my disposal than since I took my\r\nleave of it; nor have I the consolation of finding, that as my powers of\r\napplication necessarily decline, the demands on them proportionally\r\ndecrease.\" Much as he wrote upon questions of an earlier period, there\r\nwere no topics of the current time that did not arouse his interest.\r\nUpon the subject of slavery he thought much and wrote much and always\r\nearnestly and humanely. How to get rid of it was a problem which he\r\nnever solved to his own satisfaction. Though it was one he always\r\nlonged to see through, it never occurred to him that the way to abolish\r\nslavery was--to abolish it. How kind he was as a master, Paul Jennings\r\nbears witness. \"I never,\" he says, \"saw him in a passion, and never knew\r\nhim to strike a slave, though he had over a hundred; neither would he\r\nallow an overseer to do it.\" He rebuked those who were in fault; but,\r\nadds Jennings, he would \"never mortify them by doing it before others.\"\r\nIt will be remembered that on the first occasion of his being a\r\ncandidate for public office he refused to follow the universal Virginian\r\nhabit of \"treating\" the electors. To the principle which governed him\r\nthen he adhered through life, and his letters show the warm interest he\r\nalways took in every phase of the temperance movement. \"I don't think he\r\ndrank a quart of brandy in his whole life,\" says Jennings. A single\r\nglass of wine was all he ever took at dinner, and this he diluted with\r\nwater, when, says the same witness, \"he had hard drinkers at his table\r\nwho had put away his choice madeira pretty freely.\" This will go for\r\nsomething, considering the times, with even the most zealous of the\r\nmodern supporters of that cause; but they must be quite satisfied to\r\nknow that \"for the last fifteen years of his life he drank no wine at\r\nall.\" Consideration for his own health, always feeble, may have led him\r\nto this abstinence; but it is rather remarkable that a man of his\r\nposition should have held, fifty years ago, the advanced notions which\r\nhe certainly did upon this question, and that the doubt only of the\r\npossibility of enforcing laws for prohibiting the manufacture and sale\r\nof spirits seems to have withheld him from proposing them.\r\n\r\nSocial as well as moral questions he discussed with evident interest and\r\nwithout passion or prejudice. Aside from the party meaning of the term,\r\nhe belonged to that school of democracy, now extinct, which believed\r\nthat the highest object of human exertion is to improve man's condition,\r\nand to secure to each the rights which belong to all. He did not agree\r\nwith Robert Owen as to methods; but neither did he reject his schemes as\r\ninevitably absurd because they were new and untried. One would not\r\ngather from his correspondence with Frances Wright that this was the\r\nnotorious Fanny Wright whom the world chose to consider, as its way is,\r\na disreputable and probably wicked woman, inasmuch as she proposed some\r\nradical changes in its social relations which she thought would be a\r\ngain. He gave much attention to popular education, and all the influence\r\nhe could command was devoted, through all the later years of his life,\r\nto the establishment and well-being of the University of Virginia.\r\nEducation, he maintained, was the true foundation of civil liberty, and\r\non it, therefore, rested the welfare and stability of the republic. It\r\nis probable that he would have drawn a line at difference of color then,\r\nsimply because of the difference of condition implied by color. But he\r\nmade no such distinction in sex. Sixty-three years ago he saw his way\r\nquite clearly on a question which is a sore trial now to many timid\r\nsouls. The capacity of \"the female mind\" for the highest education\r\ncannot, he said, \"be doubted, having been sufficiently illustrated by\r\nits works of genius, of erudition, and of science.\" The capacity, he\r\nassumed, carried with it the right. In short, he was ready always to\r\nconsider fairly questions relating to the well-being of society which\r\nsince his time have deeply agitated the country; and he approached them\r\nall much in the spirit of the reformer who hopes to leave the world a\r\nlittle better and happier because he has lived in it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Madison, I think,\" says Paul Jennings, \"was one of the best men\r\nthat ever lived.\" This is the testimony of an intelligent man whose\r\nopportunities of knowing the personal qualities of him of whom he was\r\nspeaking were more intimate than those of any other person could be\r\nexcept Mrs. Madison. \"He was guilty,\" says Hildreth, \"of the greatest\r\npolitical wrong and crime which it is possible for the head of a nation\r\nto commit.\" One saw the private gentleman, always conscientious and\r\nconsiderate in his personal relations to other men; the other judged the\r\npublic man, moved by ambition, entangled in party ties and supposed\r\nparty obligations, his moral sense blinded by the necessities of\r\npolitical compromises to reach party ends. It is not impossible to\r\nstrike a just balance between these opposing estimates, though one is\r\nthat of a servant, the other that of a learned and judicious historian.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison left a legacy of \"Advice to My Country,\" to be read after\r\nhis death and to \"be considered as issuing from the tomb, where truth\r\nalone can be respected, and the happiness of man alone consulted.\" It is\r\nthe lesson of his life, as he wished his countrymen to understand it.\r\n\"The advice,\" he said, \"nearest to my heart and deepest in my\r\nconvictions is, that the Union of the States be cherished and\r\nperpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her\r\nbox opened, and the disguised one as the serpent creeping with his\r\ndeadly wiles into Paradise.\" The thoughtful reader, as he turns to the\r\nfirst page of this volume to recall the date of Mr. Madison's death,\r\nwill hardly fail to note how few the years were before these open and\r\ndisguised enemies, against whom he warned his countrymen, were found\r\nonly in that party which he had done so much, from the time of the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, to keep in power.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Paul Jennings, who was a slave and the body servant of Mr.\r\nMadison, says in his _Reminiscences_: \"It has often been stated in\r\nprint, that when Mrs. Madison escaped from the White House, she cut out\r\nfrom the frame the large portrait of Washington (now in one of the\r\nparlors there) and carried it off. This is totally false. She had no\r\ntime for doing it. It would have required a ladder to get it down. All\r\nshe carried off was the silver in her reticule, as the British were\r\nthought to be but a few squares off, and were expected every moment.\r\nJohn Suse (a Frenchman, then doorkeeper, and still [1865] living), and\r\nMagraw, the President's gardener, took it down and sent it off on a\r\nwagon, with some large silver urns and such other valuables as could\r\nhastily be got hold of. When the British did arrive, they ate up the\r\nvery dinner, and drank the wines, etc., that I had prepared for the\r\nPresident's party.\" On a previous page he had related that: \"Mrs.\r\nMadison ordered dinner to be ready at three as usual; I set the table\r\nmyself, and brought up the ale, cider, and wine, and placed them in the\r\ncoolers, as all the cabinet and several military gentlemen and strangers\r\nwere expected.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n   Abolition Societies, petition for prohibition of African slave trade\r\n       to Louisiana,
