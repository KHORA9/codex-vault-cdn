FOGHT\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT SOUTH DAKOTA TEACHERS COLLEGE\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY CIVICS AND RURAL LIFE\r\n\r\nBY ARTHUR W. DUNN\r\n\r\nSPECIALIST IN CIVIC EDUCATION, UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION;\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE COMMUNITY AND THE CITIZEN\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book, like the author's earlier one, The Community and the\r\nCitizen, is a \"community civics\" text. Two purposes led to the\r\npreparation of this second volume. The first was to produce a text\r\nthat would meet the needs of pupils and teachers who live outside\r\nof the environment of the large city. Training for citizenship in\r\na democracy is a fundamentally identical process in all\r\ncommunities, whether urban or rural. But, if it really functions\r\nin the life of the citizen, this process must consist largely in\r\nderiving educational values from the actual civic situations in\r\nwhich he normally finds himself. Moreover, instruction that\r\nrelates to matters that lie beyond immediate experience must\r\nnevertheless be interpreted in terms of that experience if it is\r\nreally to have meaning. At least half of the young citizens of\r\nAmerica live in an environment that is essentially rural. Hence\r\ntheir need for civics instruction that takes its point of\r\ndeparture in, and refers back to, a body of experience that\r\ndiffers in many ways from that of the urban citizen.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply that urban conditions should be ignored in the\r\ncivic education of the rural citizen. On the contrary, one of the\r\nthings that every citizen should be led to appreciate is the\r\ninterdependence of country and city in a unified national life. In\r\nthe present volume emphasis is given to this interdependence. For\r\nthis reason, and because of the fundamental principles which have\r\ncontrolled the development of the text, it is believed that the\r\nbook may perform a distinct service even in city schools.\r\n\r\nThe second purpose in undertaking the present book has been to\r\nmake as obvious as possible the elements which, in the author's\r\njudgment, characterize \"community civics\" and give it vitality.\r\nThe Community and the Citizen was a pioneer among texts that have\r\nsought to vitalize the study of government and citizenship. The\r\nterm \"community civics\" became current only at a later time to\r\ndesignate the \"new civics\" which that book represented. It seems\r\nto the author, however, that many teachers and others have seized\r\nupon some of the more incidental, even though important, features\r\nof the \"new civics\" without apparently recognizing its really\r\nvital characteristics.\r\n\r\nFor example, the \"new civics\" performed a real service in giving\r\nemphasis to the study of the \"local community,\" which was being\r\nsadly neglected ten or fifteen years ago. It was this emphasis,\r\ndoubtless, that gave rise to the name \"community civics.\" But\r\n\"local study,\" even though labelled \"community civics,\" may be,\r\nand often is, entirely lacking in vitalizing features. On the\r\nother hand, the vitalizing methods that should characterize\r\ncommunity civics may be applied to the study of our \"national\r\ncommunity,\" and even of the embryonic \"world community,\"--and\r\nshould be so applied in any \"community civics\" that is worthy of a\r\nplace in our schools in this critical period of national and world\r\nhistory. The real significance of the term \"community civics\" is\r\nto be found in its application to an interpretation of the\r\nCOMMUNITY-CHARACTER of national and international life equally\r\nwith that of town or neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAnother service that community civics performed was in introducing\r\ncertain elements of social or \"sociological\" study into grades as\r\nlow as the grammar school. This has sometimes led to the\r\ndescription of community civics as \"elementary sociology.\" The\r\nCommunity and the Citizen was perhaps the first \"civics\" textbook\r\nto include such \"sociological\" material. So far as that book is\r\nconcerned, at least, the \"sociological\" material was included\r\nPRIMARILY to afford a viewpoint from which the better to interpret\r\nGOVERNMENT AND CITIZENSHIP. This point seems often to be missed,\r\nwith the result that in some schools we find a more or less\r\nvitalized \"social study\" labelled \"community civics,\" FOLLOWED BY\r\na formal study of government that shows no obvious, organic\r\nrelation to the earlier study. Whatever else \"community civics\"\r\nmay accomplish, one of its foremost aims should be TO MAKE\r\nGOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THAT OF THE NATION, MEAN SOMETHING TO THE\r\nYOUNG CITIZEN. In the present book the author has endeavored to\r\nkeep this aim prominent in the mind of the teacher. It is hoped\r\nthat the organic relation of the last few chapters, which deal\r\nexplicitly with governmental mechanism and operation, to the\r\nearlier chapters will be obvious.\r\n\r\nThe underlying, vitalizing features of community civics may be\r\nsummed up as:\r\n\r\n1. THE DEMONSTRATION TO THE YOUNG CITIZEN, BY REFERENCE TO HIS OWN\r\nOBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE, OF THE MEANING OF HIS COMMUNITY LIFE\r\n(LOCAL AND NATIONAL), AND OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS RELATION TO THAT\r\nLIFE;\r\n\r\n2. THE CULTIVATION OF CERTAIN HABITS, IDEALS, AND ATTITUDES\r\nESSENTIAL TO EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THAT LIFE THROUGH\r\nGOVERNMENT AND OTHERWISE.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the following text is to fix in the pupil's\r\nconsciousness a few essential ideas, which will help to determine\r\nhis ideals and attitudes, by a judicious USE of facts, which will\r\nthereby be more readily remembered and understood. \"The most\r\nimportant element of success in community life ... is TEAM WORK;\r\nand team work depends, first of all, UPON A COMMON PURPOSE\". The\r\ncontrolling ideas throughout the following chapters are:\r\n\r\n1. The common purposes in our community life;\r\n\r\n2. Our interdependence in attaining these common purposes;\r\n\r\n3. The consequent necessity for cooperation (team work);\r\n\r\n4. Government as a means of securing teamwork for the common good.\r\nThese ideas are set up in the first few chapters and exemplified\r\nin the remaining chapters. They are easily grasped by young\r\ncitizens when DEMONSTRATED by reference to their own observation\r\nand experience, which the text and the accompanying topics seek as\r\nfar as possible to compel. The last few chapters contain an\r\nanalysis of our governmental mechanism which seeks to answer the\r\nquestion, How far does our government provide the organization,\r\nthe leadership, and the control over leadership necessary to\r\nsecure the teamwork which the preceding chapters have shown to be\r\nessential?\r\n\r\nThe present volume is larger than The Community and the Citizen.\r\nThe author believes that this is an advantage, especially for\r\npupils in communities where supplementary materials are not so\r\neasily available. The increased length is due chiefly to the\r\nliberal incorporation of concrete illustrative and explanatory\r\nmatter. Young students need larger textbooks, provided the\r\nadditional matter clothes the skeleton with living flesh.\r\n\r\nWhether based on this textbook or some other, however, community\r\ncivics cannot be successfully taught if it is made primarily a\r\ntextbook study. The word \"demonstration\" has been used advisedly\r\nin the paragraphs above as applied to the ideas to be taught. The\r\ntext sets up ideas, interprets and exemplifies them; but\r\n\"demonstration\" can be made only as the pupils draw upon their own\r\nobservation and experience. Hence, numerous SUGGESTIVE topics are\r\ninterspersed throughout to divert attention from the text and to\r\ndirect it to the actualities of the pupils' experience. Even the\r\ntopics should not be followed literally in every case, but should\r\nbe diversified to meet the needs and opportunities of the\r\noccasion. But to \"omit\" such studies as suggested by the topics is\r\nto negate the value of community civics.\r\n\r\nThe successful teacher will seek to extend the pupil's opportunity\r\nto participate in group activities both within the school and in\r\nthe community outside, and will make the fullest possible use of\r\nsuch activities both as a means of demonstrating the operation of\r\nthe fundamental principles of civic life, and as a means of\r\ncultivating \"habits, ideals, and attitudes.\" \"Training for\r\ncitizenship through service\" is an essential factor in community\r\ncivics.\r\n\r\n\"Community civics\" has now been quite definitely assigned to the\r\njunior high school grades (see Report of Committee on Social\r\nStudies, Bulletin, 1916, No. 28, U.S. Bureau of Education). While\r\nthe tendency is toward continuous civics instruction in all of\r\nthese grades, practice still varies greatly. The present text has\r\nbeen written in recognition of this variation and is, in the\r\nauthor's judgment, adapt able to any of the grades in question. If\r\ncommunity civics is placed below the ninth grade, however, the\r\nauthor would suggest its distribution over both seventh and eighth\r\ngrades. An outline suggesting a vital coordination between the\r\ncivics and the history of these grades, and of particular service\r\nin the seventh grade, is given in United States Bureau of\r\nEducation Bulletin, 1919, No. 50, Part 3 (a report on Civic\r\nEducation for the Schools of Memphis, Tenn.).\r\n\r\nIt may be added that community civics in the junior high school\r\ngrades will be vastly more effective if it is preceded in the six\r\nelementary grades by some such course as that outlined in\r\nCitizenship in School and Out (Dunn and Harris, published by D.C.\r\nHeath & Company). See also Lessons in Civics for the Six\r\nElementary Grades of City Schools, by Hannah Margaret Harris\r\n(Bulletin, 1920, No. 18, U.S. Bureau of Education).\r\n\r\nA list of \"Readings\" is appended to each of the following\r\nchapters. While it is not expected that pupils in the grades for\r\nwhich the book is intended will do a great deal of reading outside\r\nof the text, an abundance of illustrative material is desirable\r\nand much more easily available, even for rural schools, than is\r\noften appreciated. Let the pupils USE THEIR GOVERNMENT, in this\r\nconnection, as freely as possible. A very large part of the\r\nreferences given are to government publications, many of which can\r\nbe obtained free of cost directly from the departments issuing\r\nthem, and all of which can be had for a nominal cost from the\r\nSuperintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,\r\nWashington, D.C. Useful publications of the state government and\r\nof state institutions can usually be had for the asking. In\r\nordering from the Superintendent of Documents the money must be\r\nsent in advance (stamps are not accepted). Lists of publications\r\nwith the prices may be obtained from the Superintendent of\r\nDocuments, or from the several Departments of the Government.\r\n\r\nFrequent reference is made to Lessons in Community and National\r\nLife. These are issued in three pamphlets (Series A, B, and C) by\r\nthe United States Bureau of Education, at 15 cents per pamphlet.\r\nThey contain a large amount of illustrative material. A very few\r\nbooks are referred to in certain chapters because of their\r\nespecial value when obtainable. Among these are two collections of\r\npatriotic selections valuable because of their emphasis upon\r\nnational ideals--Long's American Patriotic Prose (D.C. Heath &\r\nCompany), and Foerster and Pierson's American Ideals (Houghton\r\nMifflin Company). Other similar collections will be found useful.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of the book, with comparatively few exceptions,\r\nare from photographs furnished by various departments of the\r\nUnited States Government.\r\n\r\nARTHUR W. DUNN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nRural schools, and schools whose pupils have largely a background\r\nof rural experience, have not done as much as they should towards\r\ntraining for citizenship. This is largely because the text books\r\nhave failed to interpret citizenship and government in terms of\r\nthe actual experience of such pupils, or to stimulate teamwork and\r\nleadership in communities with a distinctly rural background. More\r\nover, in city and rural schools alike, there has been failure to\r\nemphasize the interdependence of rural and urban communities in a\r\nsingle national enterprise. Community Civics and Rural Life is\r\nplanned to meet these deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThere has been too much TALKING ABOUT citizenship in school, and\r\ntoo little LIVING it from day to day. Training for citizenship\r\nnecessitates its daily practice in school and out. In the hands of\r\nan able teacher, Community Civics and Rural Life should point the\r\nway to real community living, both now and in the future. It\r\nshould teach the pupils what their real civic responsibilities are\r\nas well as their civic opportunities--and assist them to embrace\r\nthem when they come. Children so trained will learn to respect,\r\nnow and later, the rights of their neighbors, and will become as\r\nfair in their dealings with the government as with their\r\nfellowmen. They will furnish their communities with the right kind\r\nof leaders, unselfish and public spirited. When the time calls,\r\nthey will be ready to accept and shed a new dignity upon the old\r\npositions of school trustee, highway engineer, sanitary inspector,\r\ntownship supervisor, county commissioner, or the more conspicuous\r\noffices of state and national government. Or as plain citizens\r\nthey will lend these officials their active support for community\r\nand national betterment.\r\n\r\nHAROLD W. FOGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Our nation gave an\r\nexample of team work during the recent war such as is seldom seen;\r\nand this was be cause every member of the nation was keenly intent\r\non WINNING. We may see the same thing in our school when Christmas\r\nentertainment is being planned, when an athletic tournament is\r\napproaching, or when some other school activity is under way in\r\nwhich all are deeply interested. It is often illustrated in our\r\ntown, or rural neighborhood when some important enterprise is on\r\nfoot, such as the building of a new railroad into town, a Red\r\nCross \"drive\" and a county fair, or the construction of a much\r\nneeded new schoolhouse.\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION OF COMMON PURPOSES\r\n\r\nAll communities have common purposes, although they are not always\r\nas clearly defined as when our nation was at war, or as in the\r\nother cases mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Sometimes the\r\npeople of a community, or a large portion of them, seem to be\r\nwholly unconscious that a common purpose exists. This may be true\r\neven in a family or in a school. And when this happens, the effect\r\nis the same as if there WERE no common purpose. No club or\r\nathletic team can be successful unless its members have a common\r\npurpose AND UNDERSTAND IT. Insofar as our communities are\r\nimperfect--and none of them, is perfect--it is largely because\r\ntheir members fail to recognize or understand their common\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nPeople in communities have common purposes because they have the\r\nsame wants. This may not at first seem to be true.\r\n\r\nCOMMON PURPOSES DUE TO COMMON WANTS\r\n\r\nIf we visit a large city, we see throngs of people hurrying hither\r\nand thither, jostling one another, apparently in the greatest\r\nconfusion. We wonder where they are all going, what they are\r\ndoing, what they are seeking. In rural communities or in small\r\ntowns there is less apparent confusion than in the bustling life\r\nof the city. Yet even here it is not always easy to see common\r\npurposes and common interests. Whether in large or small\r\ncommunities, we are more likely to be impressed by the VARIETY of\r\nmen's wants and even by the CONFLICT of their purposes.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how numerous and conflicting our wants may seem,\r\nthey may all be grouped in a very few important kinds, which are\r\ncommon to all of us alike. It will be worthwhile to test the truth\r\nof this, because it will help us to see our community life in some\r\nkind of order, and will throw a flood of light upon the common\r\npurposes that control it.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL WANTS: LIFE AND HEALTH\r\n\r\nFor example, we all want food, drink, and sleep, clothing to\r\nprotect our bodies, and houses to shelter us. But all these things\r\nsupply our PHYSICAL wants; that is, they re late to LIFE AND\r\nHEALTH. Many of the things that we do every day are important\r\nbecause of their relation to our physical well-being. One reason\r\nwhy we enjoy out door sports is that they make our blood tingle\r\nand give a sense of physical pleasure. Unless our physical wants\r\nare provided for, the other wants of life cannot well be\r\nsatisfied. Good health is a priceless possession.\r\n\r\nMention some things you have done today for your physical welfare.\r\n\r\nTHE WANT FOR ASSOCIATION WITH OTHERS\r\n\r\nAnother reason why sports and games give pleasure is be cause of\r\nthe association they afford with other people. ASSOCIATION WITH\r\nOTHERS is a second great want which explains many of the things we\r\ndo. Whatever may be our other reasons for going to school, it\r\naffords us the opportunity to meet and work and play with other\r\nboys and girls to our pleasure and profit. One of the objections\r\noften raised against life in the country is the lack of\r\nopportunity for association with other people. But life in the\r\ncountry is not so isolated as it once was; and one may be very\r\nmuch alone in a city crowd, where nearly all are strangers to one\r\nanother, and where there is very little real association among\r\nindividuals. City families often live in the same apartment house\r\nwithout knowing one another.\r\n\r\nWhat are some things you do especially for the sake of\r\ncompanionship?\r\n\r\nTHE WANT FOR KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nWhile going to school enables us to associate with others, the\r\nprincipal reason for going is to gain KNOWLEDGE. Whether we always\r\nlike our studies or not, we certainly want knowledge, and seek it\r\nin many ways. We read the newspaper or magazine that comes to the\r\nhome. We ask questions of parents and others who have had more\r\nexperience than we. We may travel to see new sights. We examine\r\nwith curiosity a new machine for the farm. The discoveries and\r\ninventions that mark man's progress in civilization are the result\r\nof his unquenchable thirst for knowledge.\r\n\r\nMention some of the different ways in which you seek knowledge.\r\n\r\nMention some geographic and scientific discoveries that have been\r\nmade through man's search for knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat is science? Name some sciences.\r\n\r\nTHE WANT FOR BEAUTY\r\n\r\nBesides health and knowledge and association with other people, we\r\nwant surroundings that are pleasant and beautiful. The want for\r\nBEAUTY is sometimes more neglected than other wants, but it is\r\nimportant, and we all have it and seek to satisfy it in some way\r\nor other. It may be at one time by a walk in the woods or fields,\r\nor at other times by cultivating flowers, by keeping our room\r\ntidy, by looking at pictures, or by exercising good taste in\r\nclothing. We also enjoy beauty in sound, as the song of birds or\r\nmusic in the home or school.\r\n\r\nIn what ways do you provide for this want?\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS WANT\r\n\r\nVery likely we go to church on Sunday. It affords opportunity to\r\nenjoy association with others, to add to our knowledge, and to\r\nhear beautiful music. But the church service is one of the chief\r\nmeans by which people satisfy another of the great wants of life\r\n--the RELIGIOUS want. Individuals differ in their religious ideas\r\nand in the depth of their religious feelings, but in every\r\ncommunity there are certain things that men do because of it.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the great religions of the world?\r\n\r\nIs religion a strong influence in your community?\r\n\r\nCan you mention any great historical events that were due to\r\nreligious causes?\r\n\r\nTHE WANT FOR WEALTH\r\n\r\nPerhaps after school, or on Saturdays, or in vacation time, we\r\nwork at tasks to earn money, or at least help in occupations that\r\ncontribute to the \"living\" of the family. Doubtless we have\r\nthought more or less about what we are going to do for a living\r\nafter we leave school. We all have a desire to own things, to have\r\nproperty, to accumulate WEALTH. This also is one of the great\r\nwants of life. We have perhaps already experienced the\r\nsatisfaction of raising our own first crop of corn or potatoes, of\r\nacquiring our first livestock, of putting away or selling our\r\nfirst supply of canned fruits or vegetables, of buying a set of\r\ntools, a bicycle, or some books, of starting a bank account. But\r\nafter all the chief reason why we want wealth, or to \"make money,\"\r\nis because of what we can do with it. It enables us to satisfy our\r\nwants. Earning a living simply means earning the things that\r\nsatisfy our wants in life.\r\n\r\nMake a blackboard list of the occupations by which the parents and\r\nother members of the families of the pupils in the class make a\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nMake a blackboard list of things done by members of the class to\r\nearn money.\r\n\r\nWhat is your choice of occupation by which to make a living in the\r\nfuture? Why? Make a blackboard list for the whole class.\r\n\r\nTHESE WANTS GIVE PURPOSE TO COMMUNITY LIFE\r\n\r\nThe six kinds of wants that we have indicated clearly account for\r\nmany of the things that we do. In fact, ALL of our wants are of\r\none or another of these kinds and EVERYTHING we do is important\r\nbecause of its relation to them. We may not be ready, yet, to\r\naccept this statement. We may think of wants that seem at first\r\nnot to fall under any of these six kinds. It will do no harm to\r\nadd other kinds to the list if we think it necessary. But, at all\r\nevents, the six kinds of wants mentioned are common to all of us.\r\nWe live in communities in order to provide for them, and a\r\ncommunity is good to live in proportion as it provides for all of\r\nthem adequately. It is these wants that give COMMON PURPOSE to our\r\ncommunity life.\r\n\r\nMake as complete a list as possible of the things you did\r\nyesterday (outside of school as well as in school). Then extend\r\nthe list to include the more important things done during the\r\nentire week.\r\n\r\nWrite the six wants across the top of a page of your notebook or a\r\nsheet of paper:\r\n\r\nHealth\r\nKnowledge\r\nAssociation\r\nBeauty\r\nReligion\r\nWealth\r\n\r\nArrange the activities in your list in the six columns according\r\nto the wants which they satisfy. If any activity clearly satisfies\r\nmore than one of the wants, write it down in EACH of the proper\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nWhich column is the longest? which comes next? which is the\r\nshortest?\r\n\r\nIs your longest column also the longest in the lists made by other\r\nmembers of your class? Compare your other columns with those of\r\nyour classmates. Which wants seem to keep you busiest?\r\n\r\nWhich do you think is most important? Why? Discuss this question\r\nin class. Do you all agree in regard to this point?\r\n\r\nIf any of the activities in your list are for the purpose of\r\nearning money, tell for what you expect to spend the money. Show\r\nhow the things you expect to buy with your money will help to\r\nsatisfy your other five wants.\r\n\r\nFor which of these six wants do you spend the most time in\r\nproviding? your father? your mother? If there is a difference in\r\nthe three answers, why is it?\r\n\r\nDo you have difficulty in classifying any of the things you do, or\r\nthat you see others do, under any of the six heads? Make note of\r\nthese things and, as your study proceeds, see if the difficulty of\r\nclassification is removed.\r\n\r\nSuppose a boy is a BULLY: what wants does he satisfy by his\r\nbullying conduct? Suppose a boy or a girl is ambitious to become a\r\nLEADER, either among present companions or later in social life,\r\nbusiness, or politics: under which head or heads would you place\r\nthis ambition?\r\n\r\nA boy wants to enlist in the army, or a girl as an army nurse: do\r\nthese wants come under any of the six heads?\r\n\r\nWould you, after your discussion of these topics, add any other\r\ngroup or kind of wants to the six mentioned? If so, what would you\r\ncall it?\r\n\r\nEvery one wants HAPPINESS. Why is it not necessary to make a\r\nspecial group under this head?\r\n\r\nMake a list of things done in your home to provide for each of the\r\nsix wants.\r\n\r\nWhat is done in your school to provide for the want for health?\r\nfor beauty? for association with others? for the religious want?\r\nHas your school work any relation to your desire to make a living?\r\nIs it the business of the school to provide for all these things\r\nas well as for the want for knowledge?\r\n\r\nMake a list of a few things done in your community outside of the\r\nhome and school to provide for each of the six wants.\r\n\r\nThink of something in which your entire community is deeply\r\ninterested, such as the improvement of the roads, or the building\r\nof a new high school, or a county fair, and explain what wants it\r\nprovides for.\r\n\r\nWhat wants do the following things provide for: rural mail\r\ndelivery; weather reports; a corn club (or a similar club); a\r\nschool garden; a library; the telephone; a hospital; a parent-\r\nteacher association?\r\n\r\nTHE PURPOSE OF DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nWe may often hear our common purposes as communities or as a\r\nnation stated in different terms than those suggested in the\r\nparagraphs above. For example, Franklin K. Lane, the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior during the war, said, \"Our national purpose is to\r\ntransmute days of dreary work into happier lives--for ourselves\r\nfirst and for all others in their time.\" Again, President Wilson\r\nsaid that our purpose in entering the world war was to help \"make\r\nthe world safe for democracy.\" Although these two statements read\r\ndifferently, they mean very much the same thing; and they both\r\nrefer in general terms to the things this chapter discusses in\r\nmore familiar and express terms. For \"happier lives\" can only\r\nresult from a more complete satisfaction of our common wants. Our\r\nown happiness comes from the satisfaction of our own wants AND\r\nFROM HELPING TO SATISFY THE WANTS OF OTHERS. And \"democracy\"\r\nmeans, in part, that the COMMON WANTS OF ALL shall be properly\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nIn the Declaration of Independence we read:\r\n\r\n WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED\r\nEQUAL THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN\r\nUNALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE\r\nPURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.\r\n\r\nOUR UNALIENABLE RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe statement that \"all men are created equal\" has troubled many\r\npeople when they have thought of the obvious inequalities that\r\nexist in natural ability and opportunity. But whatever\r\ninequalities may exist, people are absolutely equal in their RIGHT\r\nto satisfy the wants described in this chapter. These are the\r\n\"unalienable rights\" which the Declaration of Independence sums up\r\nin the phrase \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" That\r\ncommunity is best to live in that most nearly provides equal\r\nopportunity for all its citizens to enjoy these rights. From the\r\nDeclaration of Independence to the present day, our great national\r\npurpose has been to increase this opportunity, even though at\r\ntimes we have apparently not been conscious of it, and even though\r\nwe have fallen short of its fulfillment. One of the chief objects\r\nof our study is to find out how our communities are seeking to\r\naccomplish this purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The Declaration of Independence did not mention the questions of\r\nour day. It is of no consequence to us unless we can translate its\r\ngeneral terms into examples of the present day and substitute them\r\nin some vital way for the examples it itself gives, so concrete,\r\nso intimately involved in the circumstances of the day in which it\r\nwas conceived and written. It is an eminently practical document,\r\nmeant for the use of practical men ... Unless we can translate it\r\ninto the questions of our own day, we are not worthy of it, we are\r\nnot sons of the sires who acted in response to its challenge.\"--\r\nWoodrow Wilson, in The New Freedom, pp. 48, 49.\r\n\r\nA and B are two boys of the same age. One was born in a rich\r\nfamily, and one in a very poor family. So far as this accident of\r\nbirth is concerned, have they equal OPPORTUNITY to satisfy the\r\nwants of life? Have they an equal RIGHT to health? to an\r\neducation? to pleasant surroundings? to earn a good living?\r\n\r\nSuppose A is a Native American boy, and B a foreign-born boy who\r\nspeaks a foreign language: does this make any difference in their\r\nRIGHT to life and health, an education, etc.? Does it make any\r\ndifference in their OPPORTUNITY to satisfy their wants in these\r\ndirections?\r\n\r\nCan you think of persons in your community who have less\r\nOPPORTUNITY to satisfy their wants than you have? Can you think of\r\nany persons who have less RIGHT to satisfy their wants than you\r\nhave?\r\n\r\nThe first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States\r\ncomprise what is known as a \"bill of rights.\" Study together in\r\nclass this bill of rights (see Appendix) to see how many of the\r\nwants described in this chapter are there, provided for directly\r\nand indirectly.\r\n\r\nHas your state constitution a bill of rights? If so, read it\r\ntogether in class for the same purpose as suggested in the last\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nPreamble of the Constitution of the United States (see Appendix).\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nDunn, Arthur W., The Community and the Citizen, Chapters, i, iv.\r\n(Heath).\r\n\r\nTufts, James H., The Real Business of Living (Henry Holt & Co.),\r\nChapter xxxix, (\"Democracy as Equality\").\r\n\r\nVan Dyke, Henry, \"Equality of Opportunity,\" in Long's American\r\nPatriotic Prose, pp. 311, 312 (Heath).\r\n\r\nSee the note on reference materials in the Introduction to this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nIt should become a HABIT of both teacher and pupils to be on the\r\nconstant lookout for news items and discussions in available\r\nnewspapers and periodicals illustrative of the points made in each\r\nchapter or lesson.

But even as we sit in our\r\nschoolroom, whether or not we get all the pure air we need,\r\ndepends upon how the schoolhouse was built for ventilation, the\r\nnumber of people who occupy the room, the care that is taken by\r\nothers to keep the room free from dust, the health and cleanliness\r\nof those who sit in the room with us. If this dependence upon\r\nothers is true in the case of the very air we breathe, how much\r\nmore true it must be of other necessities of life that are not so\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nThis dependence of people upon one another for the satisfaction of\r\ntheir wants is one of the most important facts about community\r\nlife. It is not merely that A and B have the SAME wants, but that\r\nA is dependent upon B, and B upon A, for the satisfaction of their\r\nwants, that makes their wants COMMON.\r\n\r\nMention the people, both inside and outside of your home, who had\r\na share in providing for you the food you had for breakfast or\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nMention all the workers that occur to you who have been employed\r\nin producing the clothing you wear; the book you are reading; the\r\nmaterials of which your house is built.\r\n\r\nShow how the people who produce these things are dependent upon\r\nyour wants for their livelihood.\r\n\r\nShow that you are dependent upon other people for your education;\r\nfor recreation. Are other people dependent upon your education for\r\ntheir welfare? Are others dependent on you for their recreation?\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE OF THE PIONEER\r\n\r\nThe farmer's life is often spoken of as an independent life. His\r\nindependence was certainly much more complete in pioneer days than\r\nit is now. In regard to the early days of Indiana, it has been\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\nGive the pioneer farmer an axe and an auger, or in place of the\r\nlast a burning iron, and he could make almost any machine that he\r\nwas wont to work with. With his sharp axe he could not only cut\r\nthe logs for his cabin and notch them down, but he could make a\r\nclose-fitting door and supply it with wooden hinges and a neat\r\nlatch. From the roots of an oak or ash he could fashion his hames\r\nand sled runners; he could make an axle-tree for his wagon, a\r\nrake, a flax brake, a barrow, a scythe-snath, a grain cradle a\r\npitchfork, a loom, a reel, a washboard, a stool, a chair, a table,\r\na bedstead, a dresser, and a cradle in which to rock the baby. If\r\nhe was more than ordinarily clever, he repaired his own cooperage,\r\nand adding a drawing knife to his kit of tools, he even went so\r\nfar as to make his own casks, tubs, and buckets. He made and\r\nmended his own shoes. [Footnote: Quoted in Pioneer Indianapolis,\r\nby Ida Stearns Stickney, p. 11 (Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis).]\r\n\r\nWe also read that in early New England:\r\n\r\nEvery farmhouse was a manufactory, not of one kind of goods, but\r\nof many. All day long in the chamber or attic the sound of the\r\nspinning-wheel and loom could be heard. Carpets, shawls,\r\nbedspreads, tablecovers, towels, and cloth for garments were made\r\nfrom materials made on the farm. The kitchen of the house was a\r\nbaker's shop, a confectioner's establishment, and a chemist's\r\nlaboratory. Every kind of food for immediate use was prepared\r\nthere daily; and on special occasions sausages, head cheese,\r\npickles, apple butter, and preserves were made. It was also the\r\nplace where soap, candles, and vinegar were manufactured.\r\nAgricultural implements were then few and simple, and farmers made\r\nas many of them as they could. Every farmhouse was a creamery and\r\ncheese factory. As there were no sewing machines, the farmer's\r\nwife and daughters had to ply the hand needle most of the time\r\nwhen they were not engaged in more laborious pursuits. During the\r\nlong evenings they generally knit socks and mittens or made rag\r\ncarpets. [Footnote: Nourse, Agricultural Economics, p 64, from\r\n\"The Farmer's Changed Conditions,\" by Rodney Welsh, in the Forum,\r\nx, 689-92 (Feb., 1891).]\r\n\r\nTHE PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nBut even under such conditions as those described, the farmer and\r\nhis family were not wholly independent. Even Robinson Crusoe on\r\nhis lonely island was dependent upon the tools and equipment that\r\nhe saved from shipwrecks, and that were the product of other men's\r\nlabor. So, also, the pioneer farmer had to maintain some kind of\r\nrelation, however infrequent and slight, with the outside world.\r\nMoreover, he had to pay for his comparative independence by many\r\nprivations. He had all the wants described in the preceding\r\nchapter, but he had to provide for them in the simplest way\r\npossible, and often they were hardly provided for at all.\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF INTERDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nAs soon as a number of people come to live together, even in a\r\npioneer community, it is likely that some members will have a\r\nknack for doing certain things of use to the community better than\r\nothers can do them. Thus one man may be especially skillful in\r\nmaking axe handles. In time, the entire community comes to depend\r\nupon him for its axe handles. In addition, he probably makes other\r\ntools and does repair work of all kinds. This requires so much of\r\nhis time that he does little or no farming, and depends upon\r\nothers for his food supply. So in a course of time the community\r\nhas its blacksmiths, carpenters, shoe-makers, teachers,\r\nstorekeepers and doctors upon whom it depends for their special\r\nkinds of service, while each of them depends upon others to supply\r\nthe wants that he has neither the time nor the skill to supply for\r\nhimself. Thus interdependence develops in the simplest\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPENDENCE ON OTHERS OF THE MODERN FARMER\r\n\r\nThe farmer still does many things on the farm that in the city\r\nwould be done by special workers, such as repairing houses, barns,\r\nand tools. But he has become vastly more dependent upon others\r\nthan formerly. This is due partly to improved farming methods,\r\nrequiring the use of complicated machines and greater technical\r\nknowledge; and partly to improved means of transportation and\r\ncommunication which bring him in close touch with trade centers.\r\nIf a farmer needs a new axe handle, he can get a better one with\r\nless expenditure of time and effort by going to town in his\r\nautomobile than if he made it himself. His farm machinery is too\r\ncomplicated for him to repair except in small matters, and even\r\nthen he must go or send to town for the necessary parts, which may\r\nbe sent to him by parcel post. Not only does he get better tools\r\nand services generally through this reliance upon others who are\r\nspecialists in their lines, but also on account of it has more\r\ntime to give to the actual business of farming, for which others\r\ndepend upon him, and leisure for thoughtful study of his problems,\r\nfor social life, and for recreation.\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF SELF-RELIANCE\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that reliance upon others may be carried\r\nso far as to result in loss or disadvantage. \"Self-reliance\" is\r\none of the most admirable traits of character. The pioneer farmer\r\npossessed it from necessity to a remarkable extent. A habit of\r\ndepending upon others may quickly cause a person to lose the\r\n\"knack\" of doing things for himself, to become less \"handy about\r\nthe place,\" and less \"thrifty\" about keeping things in repair or\r\ninstalling small improvements--the casting of a cement trough,\r\nmending the harness or the fence or painting the barn.\r\n\r\nWHO MAKES OUR SHOES\r\n\r\nThe interdependence of people in community life to-day may be\r\nillustrated by starting with some of our own needs, as was\r\nsuggested in the topics on page 12. For example, if we need a pair\r\nof shoes, we must have money, which we will suppose that we earn\r\nby farming. In order to farm successfully we must have machinery.\r\nThis we also buy in town; but it is manufactured for us in distant\r\ncity factories from metals procured from mines and from wood from\r\nthe forest. The shoes bought at the store were also made in a\r\nfactory employing hundreds of men and women, perhaps in\r\nMassachusetts. They were made from leather from the hides of\r\ncattle raised in the far west, or perhaps even in the Argentine\r\nRepublic. The leather is tanned by another industry, and tanning\r\nrequires the use of an acid from the bark of certain trees from\r\nthe forest. The making of the shoes also requires machinery which\r\nis made by still other machines, the necessary metals coming from\r\nmines. To smelt the metals and to run the factories there must be\r\nfuel from other mines. Meanwhile the workers in all these\r\nindustries must be fed and clothed and housed. This means the work\r\nof farmers, food packers, millers and bakers, lumbermen,\r\ncarpenters, cotton and woolen mills, clothing factories, and many\r\nothers. At every stage transportation enters in,--by team and\r\nautomobile truck, by railway, by water. These are only a part of\r\nthe activities necessary in order that we may have a pair of\r\nshoes. It would seem that practically every kind of worker and\r\nindustry in the world had something to do with it. People in\r\ncommunities today are indeed very interdependent.\r\n\r\nThe following item appeared in a newspaper:\r\n\r\nHELD BACK BY NEIGHBORS\r\n\r\nFarmer Is Limited by Conditions in Community\r\n\r\nThe average farmer is limited in the changes he can make in his\r\nfarm business by the farm practices of the community in which he\r\nis living.\r\n\r\nThere are farmers in every community who would like to change\r\ntheir systems of agriculture but are restrained from doing so by\r\nthe fact that their neighbors will not change. Many farmers have\r\ntried to change from one type of farming to another better suited\r\nto the region, but failed because the cost of running such an\r\nentirely independent business was too great.\r\n\r\nA man owning an orchard in a locality where there are no other\r\norchards has trouble getting rid of his crop. Even when the farmer\r\nis so fortunate as to get buyers, he generally receives a lower\r\nprice for the same grade of fruit than would be received in a\r\ngeneral apple-growing region.\r\n\r\nIf a man wants to buy several purebred Holstein cows, he generally\r\ngoes to a locality where a large number of farmers keep that kind\r\nof stock. Often there is a man in his own community who has for\r\nsale Holsteins that are just as highly bred as those in other\r\ndistricts, but he either has no market for them or must sell them\r\nat a greatly reduced price.\r\n\r\nThe farmer ought not to think on account of these facts that he\r\nshould not change his system of farming just because his neighbors\r\ndo not do likewise.\r\n\r\nProbably the best way for a farmer to start such a movement is to\r\narouse the interest of his neighbors in his farming operations. As\r\nsoon as this has been accomplished he can gradually bring about\r\nthe change that he advocates. Farmers in a community profit from\r\nthe experiences of other individuals.\r\n\r\nWHAT GIVES VALUE TO LAND\r\n\r\nThe value of a man's property is dependent not upon his efforts\r\nalone, but upon what his neighbors do. The land occupied by a\r\npioneer increases in value as other people settle in the\r\nneighborhood, and BECAUSE they settle there. Men often buy land\r\nand then simply wait for it to increase in value because of\r\nimprovements in the neighborhood. The property that we own may\r\nincrease or decrease in value according to the care that neighbors\r\ntake of their property. Even if we take good care of our property,\r\nit will be less valuable if the neighbors let their fences and\r\nbuildings run down and the weeds grow than it will be if they keep\r\ntheir fences and buildings in good repair and their weeds cut.\r\n\r\nINTERDEPENDENCE IN HEALTH\r\n\r\nMalaria is carried by mosquitoes, and we know that mosquitoes\r\nbreed in standing water, as in swamps and in old barrels or tin\r\ncans that hold rainwater until it becomes stagnant. Now we may\r\nendeavor to get rid of mosquitoes, and thus of malaria, by\r\nremoving all open receptacles of water about our premises and by\r\ndraining the marshes on our land; but unless our neighbors do the\r\nsame, we are not much better off than we were before.\r\n\r\nGive other illustrations to show the dependence of people upon one\r\nanother in your community.\r\n\r\nCompare the farmer of to-day in your neighborhood with the pioneer\r\nof Indiana described on page 14 with respect to his equipment,\r\nskill in making things and kinds of implements used.\r\n\r\nCompare the average farmer's home in your neighborhood to-day with\r\nthat of the New England farmer described on page 14 with respect\r\nto household activities.\r\n\r\nAre farmers in your neighborhood to-day more or less dependent\r\nupon others to supply their wants than they were when your parents\r\nwere children? Why is it? Get all the information you can from\r\nyour parents on this point.\r\n\r\nWhich is more dependent upon others for its daily wants: a family\r\nthat lives on a farm in your neighborhood or one that lives in\r\ntown? Give examples to prove your answer.\r\n\r\nDo you know cases in your own community where land has increased\r\nin value while lying idle? What are the reasons?\r\n\r\nDo you know of cases in your community where property has\r\ndepreciated in value because of neighborhood influences such as\r\nsuggested on page 18?\r\n\r\nDo you know of cases in your community similar to the one\r\ndescribed on page 17 under the heading \"Held Back by Neighbors\"?\r\nExplain. (Consult at home.)\r\n\r\nUNEXPECTED RESULTS OF INTERDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nWe do not always realize how dependent we are upon one another\r\nuntil something happens to disturb our accustomed relations. We\r\nbest realize our dependence upon the telephone when it is out of\r\norder. The recent great war produced conditions that made us\r\nconscious of our interdependence in unexpected ways.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we had gone into a store to buy underwear in the\r\nearly part of the war, we would have found that the price had\r\ngreatly increased, and we might have been told, if the salesman\r\nwere well informed, that the high price was due to the manufacture\r\nof airplanes! The explanation is that the wire stays used in the\r\nmanufacture of airplanes are made of steel wire from which machine\r\nknitting needles are also made. In the early part of the war all\r\nof the available wire of this kind was taken for airplanes, thus\r\nlimiting the supply of knitting needles and consequently of knit\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of airplanes is also said to have affected the\r\nprice of fish! The nets used for catching certain deep-sea fish,\r\nsuch as cod, must be made of linen, which is invisible in water.\r\nThe linen which had been used for this purpose suddenly came into\r\ngreat demand for the manufacture of airplane wings. Since\r\nairplanes were necessary, linen fishing nets were sacrificed and\r\nthe price of deep-sea fish went up. This, of course, created a\r\ndemand for other kinds of fish, and the price of the latter also\r\nwent up.\r\n\r\nCONFLICTS DUE TO INTERDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nWhen people are so closely dependent upon one another conflicts\r\nare likely to occur. Sometimes they are due to selfish disregard\r\nby some persons of the rights and interests of others; but more\r\noften they are due simply to failure to see what the real results\r\nof a particular act may be and how it may affect other people. It\r\nwas not dreamed that the building of airplanes would affect the\r\nprice of underwear and fish, and it was only after careful\r\ninvestigation that the relation between these things was\r\ndiscovered. A family that is careless in the disposal of refuse\r\nfrom the household and stables may unconsciously poison the wells\r\nof neighbors half a mile away. Sometimes men oppose public\r\nimprovements, such as better roads, or a new schoolhouse, because\r\nthey see only the direct costs of the improvements, and fail to\r\nsee the more important losses to themselves and to the community\r\nif the improvements are not made.\r\n\r\nDANGER OF HASTY JUDGMENTS\r\n\r\nOne thing we may learn from such facts as these is the danger of\r\nforming hasty judgments about things that happen, or conditions\r\nthat exist, or proposals that are made, in our community life.\r\nEven those conditions or events that are apparently most simple\r\nmay be related to other conditions and events that are not at\r\nfirst apparent. Wise judgment and wise action are dependent upon\r\nthe most complete knowledge obtainable.\r\n\r\nWe shall see, as we proceed with our study, how this fact of\r\ninterdependence appears in every phase of our community life.\r\n\r\nFrom observation in your own community, give illustrations to show\r\nhow people, in attempting to satisfy their own wants, may\r\ninterfere with the efforts of others to satisfy theirs. The\r\nfollowing are given as suggestions:\r\n\r\nAn employer and those whom he employs.\r\n\r\nA man who owns a house or farm and the tenant to whom he rents it.\r\n\r\nA man who keeps a livery stable adjoining a schoolhouse.\r\n\r\nA grocer who displays his goods on the sidewalk (especially food\r\nproducts).\r\n\r\nMen who raise cattle and those who raise sheep on the western\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nA boy who raises chickens and one who has a garden adjoining.\r\n\r\nSuppose a schoolmate comes to school with measles or some other\r\ncontagious disease. How may this affect your schoolwork? your\r\nassociation with your friends? How may it even add to your\r\nfather's expenses?\r\n\r\nShow that your schoolmates are as dependent upon you as you are\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nIs the community in which you live dependent upon you in any way?\r\nGive illustrations.\r\n\r\nTaxpayers like to keep the tax rate as low as possible. In their\r\ninterest in doing this, is it possible that they might interfere\r\nwith your getting a good education in favorable surroundings?\r\nExplain. Who are the taxpayers?\r\n\r\nWe often hear of \"self-made men.\" What does it mean? Can a man be\r\nentirely \"self-made\"?\r\n\r\nDoes a child become more or less dependent upon others as he grows\r\nolder? Explain your answer.\r\n\r\nShow that as a person becomes more \"self-dependent\" other people\r\nbecome more dependent upon him; for example, in the home, and in\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nWatch the newspapers for items illustrating interdependence, or\r\nconflicts due to it.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nLessons in Community and National Life (see note on reference\r\nmaterials in Introduction)\r\n\r\nSeries A: Lesson 1, Some fundamental aspects of social organization.\r\n          Lesson 2, The western pioneer.\r\n\r\nSeries B: Lesson 1, The effect of the war on commerce in nitrate.\r\n          Lesson 2, The varied occupations of a colonial farm.\r\n          Lesson 12, Impersonality of modern life.\r\n\r\nSeries C: Lesson 1, The war and aeroplanes.\r\n          Lesson 2, Spinning and dyeing in colonial times.\r\n          Lesson 9, Inventions.\r\n          Lesson 11, The effects of machinery on rural life.\r\n\r\nDunn, Arthur W., The Community and the Citizen, Chapters i, v.\r\n\r\nTufts, James H., The Real Business of Living, Chapter xxxi\r\n(Problems of country life).\r\n\r\nEarle, Alice Morse, Home Life in Colonial Days (Macmillan).\r\n\r\nFinley, John H., \"Paths of the Pioneers,\" in Long's American\r\nPatriotic Prose, pp. 1-4.\r\n\r\nPioneer stories from any available source, especially local\r\nhistory stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE NEED FOR COOPERATION IN COMMUNITY LIFE\r\n\r\nTHE NEED FOR TEAMWORK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen people have common purposes and are dependent upon one\r\nanother in accomplishing them, there must be COOPERATION, which is\r\nanother name for \"teamwork.\" A team of horses that does not pull\r\ntogether can not haul a heavy load. A baseball team, though\r\ncomposed of good players, will seldom win games unless its\r\nteamwork is good. A few soldiers may easily disperse a large mob\r\nbecause they have teamwork, while a mob usually does not. This\r\nprinciple of \"pulling together,\" \"teamwork,\" or \"cooperation,\" is\r\nof the greatest importance in community life. There can be no real\r\ncommunity life without it.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE TYPES OF COOPERATION\r\n\r\nIn the early days there were \"barn raisings,\" when neighbors came\r\ntogether to help one of their number to \"raise\" his barn; and all\r\nthe men of a pioneer community contributed their labor in building\r\nthe community church or schoolhouse. This was a simple form of\r\ncooperation. It may be seen now at threshing time, when\r\nneighboring farmers combine to thresh the grain of each, the same\r\ngroup of men and the same threshing machine doing the work for\r\nall. The United States Department of Agriculture reports that:\r\n\r\nIn a group of 14 farmers situated in a community in one of the\r\nbest farming regions in the corn belt, ... it was found that 5 men\r\nout of the 14 failed to get all their corn planted by the last\r\nweek in May. They had worked as hard and as steadily at that\r\noperation as had their neighbors, but they were delayed by one\r\ncause or another, such as lack of labor or teams, or were handling\r\na larger acreage than their equipment would allow them to handle\r\nsatisfactorily. In this same community were 3 men who completed\r\nall their planting operations before the 20th of May, and 5 others\r\nwho completed their work by the 25th of May. ... If all these men\r\nhad considered that corn planting was a national necessity and had\r\npooled their efforts, all of the corn on all the farms could have\r\nbeen planted within the most favorable time. [Footnote: The Farm\r\nLabor Problem, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of the\r\nSecretary, Circular No. 112, p. 5.]\r\n\r\nGive other illustrations of this sort of cooperation from the farm\r\nor community life of your neighborhood.\r\n\r\nGive illustrations of such teamwork among boys and girls.\r\n\r\nGive illustrations of the failure of enterprises in which you have\r\nbeen interested because of a lack of teamwork.\r\n\r\nWhy is it an advantage for the farmers to use one threshing\r\nmachine for all the threshing of the neighborhood instead of each\r\nfarmer having his own machine?\r\n\r\nORGANIZED COOPERATION AND LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\nAs communities grow and the people become more dependent upon one\r\nanother, and especially when it becomes hard to see how one thing\r\nthat happens may affect others, as shown in Chapter II,\r\ncooperation becomes more difficult, but it becomes even more\r\nnecessary. It needs to be ORGANIZED, and it needs LEADERSHIP. The\r\nexperience of fruit growers in California affords a good\r\nillustration of this. When they acted independently of one\r\nanother, they often had difficulty in disposing of their product\r\nto advantage. Sometimes it rotted on the ground. As individuals\r\nthey did not have the means of learning where the best markets\r\nwere. They had to make their own terms separately with the\r\nrailroads for transportation and since they shipped in small\r\nquantities, they paid high freight rates. They had no adequate\r\nmeans of storing fruit while it was awaiting shipment. They were\r\ndependent upon commission merchants in the cities for such prices\r\nas they could get, which were often practically nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThese and other difficulties that made fruit growing unprofitable\r\nwere overcome by the organization of fruit growers' associations,\r\nin which each grower may become a member by purchasing shares of\r\nstock. The members elect from their number a BOARD OF DIRECTORS,\r\nwho in turn appoint a BUSINESS MANAGER who gives his entire\r\nattention to the association's business. The association has\r\ncentral offices and storage and packing houses.\r\n\r\nThe manager keeps in close touch with market conditions,--where\r\nthe demand for fruit is greatest, the kinds of fruit wanted, the\r\nbest prices paid. He contracts for the sale of fruit at fair\r\nprices. Shipping in large quantities, he gets the advantage of low\r\nrates on fast freight trains with refrigerator cars. Uniform\r\nmethods of packing fruit are adopted, sometimes the fruit being\r\npacked at the central packing house. Information is distributed as\r\nto the best methods of growing fruit, the best varieties to grow,\r\nand so on. On the other hand, supplies and provisions are bought\r\nin large quantities, securing the best quality at the lowest\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTARY COOPERATION IN CITIES\r\n\r\nIn cities there are almost innumerable organizations by which\r\ngroups of people cooperate for one purpose or another. Men in the\r\nsame line of business or in the same profession organize to\r\npromote their common interests. There are boards of trade,\r\nchambers of commerce, merchants' and manufacturers' associations.\r\nLawyers have their bar associations, physicians their medical\r\nassociations. There are associations of teachers, and work men in\r\nthe various trades have their unions. Besides such business and\r\nprofessional organizations, there are clubs and associations of\r\nall sorts for men, for women, and even for children, some of them\r\neducational, some social or recreational, some philanthropic, some\r\nreligious. Where there are so many people interested in the same\r\nthing, where it is easy for them to meet together, and where\r\ncompetent leadership is forthcoming, it is quite the usual thing\r\nto organize for united action.\r\n\r\nCOOPERATION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nIn agricultural communities cooperation has developed more slowly.\r\nFarmers have been too isolated from one another to make\r\norganization easy, they have not fully realized its advantages,\r\nand they have lacked leadership. This has been an obstacle to the\r\nfullest development of community life. The most backward\r\ncommunities are those where there is the least cooperation. In\r\nsuch communities \"the farmer works single-handed, getting no\r\nstrength from joint action or combined effort.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this is changing. Organizations like the fruit growers'\r\nassociations are becoming common and are proving their value. The\r\nmap on page 36 shows the distribution of organizations among\r\nfarmers in the United States for cooperation in business\r\nenterprises of various kinds, though it shows only about half as\r\nmany as actually exist. They include cooperative grain elevators\r\nand warehouses, creameries and cheese factories, cooperative\r\nstores, fruit and grain growers' associations, livestock\r\nassociations, cotton and tobacco associations, and many others.\r\n\r\nStudy the map on page 36 and indicate the region or regions where\r\nyou think cooperative grain elevators and warehouses would be most\r\nnumerous; livestock associations; dairies and creameries; fruit\r\ngrowers' associations; cotton growers' associations; tobacco\r\ngrowers' associations.\r\n\r\nAre there any organizations of farmers in your community similar\r\nto those in the list in the last paragraph above? Make a list of\r\nthem. What are their purposes? What are their advantages? What\r\nobstacles have they encountered? Are all the farmers in the\r\ncommunity members? If not, why? Describe their plans of\r\norganization--membership, officers, management, etc. (Discuss\r\nthese questions at home and report results.)\r\n\r\nIs there any organization of businessmen, or of workmen, in your\r\ntown or neighboring town? If so, ascertain what advantages it\r\nseeks.\r\n\r\nShow how an ordinary store, or a bank, or a grain elevator, is a\r\nmeans by which people cooperate.\r\n\r\nAre there any boys' or girls' clubs in your community? Show how\r\nsuch clubs require and secure cooperation. How is leadership\r\nprovided?\r\n\r\nIf there is a parents' association connected with your school,\r\nshow how it brings about cooperation among its members in the\r\ninterest of the school.\r\n\r\nMake a list of all the organizations you can think of in your\r\ncommunity (such as clubs, societies, associations). Opposite the\r\nname of each write the chief purposes for which it exists.\r\n\r\nWrite the six great wants across the top of a page, as suggested\r\nin the fifth topic on page 6, and arrange the list of\r\norganizations suggested in the last question above in the proper\r\ncolumns according to the wants they provide for.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the importance of leadership in school activities. What\r\nare the qualities that make a good leader?\r\n\r\nWho are some of the leaders in your community, both men and women?\r\n\r\nTHE FARM BUREAU\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1916 there were nearly three hundred \"farm\r\nbureaus\" in the northern and western states with a membership of\r\nnearly 100,000. A farm bureau is an organization to secure\r\ncooperation throughout an entire county for the promotion of\r\nagricultural interests. The members elect an executive committee\r\nto manage the affairs of the bureau. In each of the small\r\ncommunities of which the county is made up, there is a \"community\r\ncommittee.\" The chairmen of the several community committees\r\nconstitute a county agricultural council. The chairmen and members\r\nof the various committees are chosen because of their interest in\r\nspecial lines of work and their fitness to direct such work.\r\nVarious other organizations in the county, such as the fair\r\nassociation, breeders' associations, the Grange, the schools, and\r\nothers, are represented in the committees of the bureau, the\r\npurpose being to secure teamwork among them, as well as among the\r\ndifferent communities of the county and among the individual\r\nfarmers. The bureau also cooperates with the state and national\r\ngovernments in employing a COUNTY AGRICULTURAL AGENT, who is the\r\nbureau's adviser, or leader. In short, the farm bureau represents\r\nthe county working together in an organized way and under\r\nleadership for the improvement of community life.\r\n\r\nIn the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture for the year\r\n1915, the story is told of Christian County, Kentucky. [Footnote:\r\n\"How the Whole County Demonstrated,\" 1915 Year Book, U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, pp. 225-248.]\r\n\r\nA CASE OF COUNTY COOPERATION\r\n\r\nThis county is almost wholly agricultural, but the county seat is\r\na small city of 10,000. There had formerly been more or less\r\njealousy between the city and county, as too frequently happens.\r\nBut a businessmen's association was organized in the city, which\r\ninterested itself in bettering the agricultural conditions of the\r\ncounty, because the business of the city was very dependent upon\r\nthe neighboring agriculture. A \"crop improvement association\" was\r\nformed, including farmers in its membership. A county agricultural\r\nagent was employed, and local community clubs were organized in\r\ndifferent parts of the county, which held meetings attended by the\r\nfarmers and their families, and by businessmen from the city. A\r\ngood roads association was organized, and a \"good roads day\" was\r\nheld on which businessmen turned out with the farmers, stores of\r\nthe city were closed, and on one of the principal roads at least\r\n90 per cent of the workmen were city men. Stone was contributed by\r\ncontractors, concrete firms furnished men gratis to repair\r\nbridges, one company supplied outfits for trimming trees, and a\r\nlarge amount of work was done by the county and town working side\r\nby side ... Such results could only be accomplished through unity\r\nof purpose and cooperation of all the people.\r\n\r\nAmong other things accomplished in this county, a fair association\r\nhas been formed; medical instruction has been introduced into the\r\nschools; a public library and hospital have been built; the school\r\nsystem of the county has cooperated in all educational work; both\r\ntown and county merchants have offered prizes to members of the\r\nboys' clubs; also for cooking in the schools, and have put women's\r\nrestrooms in the stores for the use of the public.\r\n\r\nThere is now an active girls' canning club in every community in\r\nthe county, attended by the girls and also by their mothers. There\r\nare 12 social clubs which meet regularly; 15 parent-teachers' and\r\nmothers' clubs; and there is not a school in the county which does\r\nnot have some form of community meeting. The schoolhouses are\r\ngenerally used for the meetings of the community clubs. In some\r\ninstances farmers have given sufficient ground for amusement\r\npurposes at the schoolhouses. Here may be found the ball diamond,\r\ntennis court, and basketball courts.\r\n\r\nIt is said of this county that it \"stands as a demonstration of\r\nthe effect of education and organization under the proper\r\nleadership. THE TOWN AND THE COUNTY ARE ONE. The result is better\r\nagriculture, better business, and better living.\" Write a brief\r\ntheme on one of the following topics:\r\n\r\n(a) The importance of the telephone as a means of cooperation in\r\nmy community.\r\n\r\n(b) Instances in my community where bad roads have caused a lack\r\nof cooperation.\r\n\r\n(c) Instances in my community where improvement of roads has led\r\nto better cooperation.\r\n\r\nIn what ways do you think there is need for better cooperation in\r\nyour community? Discuss this with your parents, and report in\r\nclass the result of your talk with them.\r\n\r\nIs there any organized cooperation in your community or county as\r\na whole for the general improvement of the community or county?\r\n\r\nInvestigate the organization and work of a farm bureau. (If there\r\nis none in your county, write to your State Agricultural College\r\nor to the States Relations Service, Department of Agriculture,\r\nWashington, D.C., for information. See references at the end of\r\nthis chapter.)\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LIBRARY AS AN EXAMPLE\r\n\r\nCooperation is as necessary for the fullest satisfaction of our\r\nother wants as it is in the business of making a living. In one\r\npioneer community there were few \"books and papers and they were\r\nhanded about from house to house.\" There may be comparatively few\r\npeople in a community who can afford to buy a hundred books each\r\nyear; but there may easily be a hundred persons who could buy one\r\nbook each, and by some arrangement exchange with one another, so\r\nthat each could in the course of a year have the use of a hundred\r\nbooks. Neighborhood clubs are often organized to subscribe for\r\nmagazines on this plan. A public library provides an arrangement\r\nby which a great variety of good reading matter can be enjoyed by\r\nthe entire community at trifling cost to each member. In fact, we\r\nmay be able to draw books from such a library without any cost to\r\nourselves; but the books which we thus enjoy do cost the community\r\na large sum of money, and our free enjoyment of them is one of the\r\nadvantages of community cooperation. Our part in the cooperation\r\nis in using the books carefully and in returning them promptly, so\r\nthat as many people as possible may have the use of them.\r\n\r\nNATION-WIDE COOPERATION\r\n\r\nThe necessity for cooperation is by no means limited to our\r\nneighborhood or county or city. People with common purposes\r\norganize for cooperation on a state-wide or nation-wide scale.\r\nFollowing is a list of national organizations in the interest of\r\nagriculture. As our study proceeds, we shall have abundant\r\nillustration of the value of cooperation and of the disadvantages\r\nthat follow from its absence.\r\n\r\nFARMERS' ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\nAmerican Cooperative Association (Cooperative League of America).\r\n\r\nAmerican Dairy Farmers' Association.\r\n\r\nAmerican Federation of Organized Farmers.\r\n\r\nAmerican National Live Stock Association.\r\n\r\nAmerican Pomological Society.\r\n\r\nAmerican Poultry Association.\r\n\r\nAmerican Society of Equity.\r\n\r\nCorn Belt Meat Producers' Association,\r\n\r\nDairy Cattle Congress.\r\n\r\nFarm Women's National Congress.\r\n\r\nFarmers' Educational and Cooperative Union of America (The\r\nFarmers' Union).\r\n\r\nFarmers' Equity Union.\r\n\r\nFarmers' National Congress.\r\n\r\nFarmers' Society of Equity.\r\n\r\nFederation of Jewish Farmers of America.\r\n\r\nGleaners, The Ancient Order of.\r\n\r\nGrange, National (Patrons of Husbandry).\r\n\r\nNational Agricultural Organization Society.\r\n\r\nNational Board of Farm Organizations.\r\n\r\nNational Council of Farmers' Cooperative Associations.\r\n\r\nNational Dairy Council.\r\n\r\nNational Dairy Union.\r\n\r\nNational Farmers' Associations.\r\n\r\nNational Farmers' Cooperative Grain and Live Stock Associations.\r\n\r\nNational Nut Growers' Association.\r\n\r\nNational Society of Record Associations.\r\n\r\nNational Swine Growers' Association.\r\n\r\nNational Wool Growers' Association.\r\n\r\nNational Women's Farm and Garden Association.\r\n\r\nSouthern Rice Growers' Association.\r\n\r\nCOOPERATION A MATTER OF HABIT\r\n\r\nCooperation is largely a matter of habit. Habits can be formed\r\nonly by practice; and opportunity to practice cooperation is\r\nabundant if we are only on the lookout for it. We shall find that\r\nit not only secures better results in whatever we are doing, but\r\nthat it also adds greatly to the enjoyment of life. Let us not\r\nforget that cooperation merely means \"team work,\" working together\r\nfor the common good.\r\n\r\n\"They who cannot or will not work together are always in a weak\r\nposition when brought into competition with those who can and do.\"\r\n[Footnote: Carver, The Organization of a Rural Community, p. 5.]\r\n\r\nIf there is a public library in your community, what benefits do\r\nyou get from it? About how many books do you draw from it in the\r\ncourse of a year? What would these books cost you if you bought\r\nthem? What do they cost you when you draw them from the library?\r\n\r\nUsually a fine is imposed for keeping a book from the library\r\nbeyond a specified time.

It is a means by which to secure cooperation, or team\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIN EDUCATION\r\n\r\nWhen a schoolhouse is built to-day, it is not done by combined\r\nmanual labor, as in the pioneer community. As in all building,\r\nthere is cooperation of a highly organized kind in the production\r\nand assembling of the materials and in the construction of the\r\nbuilding by workmen of different kinds. But more than this, since\r\nthe schoolhouse is a PUBLIC BUILDING, the community cooperates in\r\npaying for it. This is done by means of TAXES. The people pay\r\ntaxes not only for the building, but also to meet the cost of\r\noperating the school, paying the teachers, buying equipment, and\r\nheating the building.\r\n\r\nThe community must know how much money is needed for the school,\r\nthe taxes must be fairly apportioned and collected, and the school\r\nmust be properly managed to perform the community's work of\r\neducation. In small communities the people may meet together to\r\nvote the taxes and to decide on other matters relating to\r\neducation, as in New England towns. But there must be leadership,\r\nand there must be an organization to perform the work which the\r\ncommunity wants done. Every community therefore has its board of\r\neducation, or school committee, a superintendent, and other\r\nofficials. Such organization corresponds to the board of directors\r\nand business manager of the fruit growers' association, only it\r\nrepresents the entire community and attends to the community's\r\nbusiness of education. It is part of the community's governing\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nAscertain from your father how much school tax he pays each year.\r\nWho determines the amount of this tax? To whom does he pay it?\r\n\r\nCould you employ a teacher at home for the amount your father pays\r\nas school tax? If you had a teacher at home, could you get as good\r\nan education as you can now get at school? Explain your answer.\r\n\r\nIn what ways do you cooperate with the community to make the\r\nschool a success?\r\n\r\nIf there is a public library in your community, is it supported by\r\ntaxation? Who manages the public library for the community?\r\n\r\nIN FIRE PROTECTION\r\n\r\nWhen a building takes fire in the country the neighbors gather as\r\nquickly as possible to fight the flames by such means as may be at\r\nhand, but seldom very effectively. In a small city or town, there\r\nmay be a volunteer fire company composed of men who, when a fire\r\nbreaks out, leave their usual occupations to save the property. In\r\nlarge cities, fully equipped and costly fire departments are\r\nmaintained, with paid firemen who are always on duty. The police\r\nusually keep the crowd away from the burning building, not only\r\nfor their own safety, but because they would hinder rather than\r\nhelp the trained and organized firemen. In each case there is\r\ncooperation for fire protection; the greater the common danger,\r\nthe more perfect the organization and the more complete the\r\ncontrol by government.\r\n\r\nIN ROAD BUILDING\r\n\r\nIt was once the usual practice, as it still is in some localities,\r\nfor each farmer to give a certain number of days each year to work\r\non the roads. Now, in the most progressive communities, the roads\r\nare better and more uniformly built and kept in better repair\r\nbecause they are placed by the community in charge of skilled\r\nroadmakers paid for by taxation. But whether the farmer\r\ncontributes money or labor, or both, cooperation is planned and\r\ndirected by the government. (See Chapter XVII.)\r\n\r\nIN HEALTH PROTECTION\r\n\r\nIn Benjamin Franklin's time, each householder in Philadelphia\r\nswept the pavement in front of his home if he wanted it kept\r\nclean. Franklin, who was a splendid example of good citizenship in\r\nthat he was always looking for opportunities to improve his\r\ncommunity, tells what happened:\r\n\r\nOne day I found a poor industrious man, who was willing to\r\nundertake keeping the pavement clean by sweeping it twice a week,\r\ncarrying off the dirt from before all the neighbors' doors, for\r\nthe sum of sixpence per month to be paid by each house. I then\r\nwrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the\r\nneighborhood that might be obtained by this small expense. ... I\r\nsent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two went\r\naround to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these\r\nsixpences; it was unanimously signed, and for a time well\r\nexecuted. This raised a general desire to have all the streets\r\npaved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThis was community cooperation under simple conditions. A hundred\r\nyears later, the one and a half million people living in\r\nPhiladelphia were just as truly cooperating to keep their city\r\nclean by means of more than 1200 miles of sewers for which they\r\nhad paid nearly 35 millions of dollars, and by means of a\r\ndepartment of highways and street-cleaning which employed a\r\ncontractor to clean the streets and to remove all ashes and\r\ngarbage at an annual cost of more than a million and a half\r\ndollars. This is all under the direction of the city government.\r\n\r\nIN STATE AND NATIONAL AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nWhat is true of our local boards of education, road supervisors,\r\nfire and street-cleaning departments, and other departments of our\r\nlocal governments, is also true of state and national governments.\r\nWe shall not stop for illustrations of this now, because they will\r\nbe numerous in later chapters. (See, for example, Chapter XII.)\r\n\r\nIs there a government in your home? If so, prove whether or not it\r\nis a means by which the members of the family cooperate.\r\n\r\nDescribe the government of your school and show how it secures\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\nIf you can get a copy of Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, find\r\nin it further instances in which he improved the cooperation of\r\nhis community, as for fire protection and street lighting.\r\n\r\nShow how street lights in town represent community cooperation.\r\nFor what purpose is this form of cooperation?\r\n\r\nGive additional illustrations to prove that government in your\r\ncommunity is a means of cooperation.\r\n\r\nIn what ways can you cooperate with the school board or trustees\r\nof your community, and thus with the community itself, for better\r\nschools?\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT TO HELP AND NOT TO REPRESS\r\n\r\nA number of boys whose lives were spent mostly in the city streets\r\nwere once asked what the word \"government\" suggested to them. Some\r\nof them at once answered, \"The policeman!\" And when they were\r\nasked \"Why?\" they replied, \"He arrests people,\" \"He makes us keep\r\noff the grass in the parks,\" \"He drives us off when we play ball\r\nin vacant lots.\" These answers represent a common idea about\r\ngovernment, that it is something over us to restrict our freedom.\r\nGovernment does restrict the freedom of individuals at times; but\r\none of the best illustrations of its real purpose is the traffic\r\npoliceman in cities. He stands at the crossing of busy streets,\r\nregulating the movement of people and vehicles in such a way as to\r\ninsure the safety of all and to keep the intersecting streams of\r\ntraffic moving smoothly and with as little interruption as\r\npossible. Now and then he leaves his post to help a child or an\r\naged person or a cripple across the street; or answers the\r\ninquiries of a stranger. If now and then he arrests a driver, it\r\nis because the latter disregards the rights or welfare of others.\r\n\r\nLAWS AS SIGNALS OF COOPERATION\r\n\r\nIn small or thinly settled communities there may be no traffic\r\npoliceman; but there may be signs at the intersection of highways\r\nto guide travelers, or warnings such as \"Dangerous Curve!\" or\r\n\"School: Drive Slowly!\" Such signs are usually posted by state or\r\nlocal authorities in accordance with LAW. And even where there are\r\nno signs, the laws themselves are supposed to regulate traffic.\r\nSome one has compared the laws in our country to the signals given\r\nto a football team by the quarterback. These signals are agreed\r\nupon in advance by the team, and tell each player not only what he\r\nhimself, but also what every other player, is to do, and thus team\r\nwork is secured. And so our laws are said to be \"signals of\r\ncooperation,\" just as much as the sign \"Drive Slowly,\" or as when\r\nthe traffic policeman holds up his hand or blows his whistle.\r\n\r\nLAWS AS RULES OF THE GAME\r\n\r\nLaws, however, are more than \"signals\" of cooperation; they are\r\nalso RULES by which cooperation is secured--\"rules of the game.\"\r\nWherever people are dependent upon one another and work together\r\nthere must be rules of conduct. One kind of rules consists of what\r\nwe call \"etiquette\" or \"good manners.\" We have doubtless all\r\nobserved how much better an athletic contest moves along, or even\r\nthe ordinary sports of the playground, where good manners prevail.\r\n\"Good manners\" include more than the \"party manners\" that we put\r\non and take off on special occasions, like \"party clothes.\" They\r\nconsist of the accepted rules of behavior toward those with whom\r\nwe associate. In the home, in school, in business, in public\r\nplaces, there are \"good manners\" that are recognized by custom and\r\nthat make the wheels move smoothly and without jar. We do not need\r\na law or a policeman to require a man to give way to a woman, or\r\neven to another man, in passing through a doorway; good manners\r\nprovide for this. Even on the public street much confusion is\r\navoided by an observance of good manners, or CUSTOM. Thoughtful\r\npeople instinctively turn to the right in passing others (in\r\nEngland and Canada the custom is to turn to the left) without\r\nthinking whether there is a law on the subject or not.\r\n\r\nLAW GIVES FREEDOM\r\n\r\nNow most of our laws that regulate the conduct of individuals are\r\nsimply rules that experience has proved to be of the greatest\r\nadvantage to the greatest number, and that are necessary because\r\nSOME people have not \"good manners.\" Most people observe them, not\r\nbecause they are laws, but because they are reasonable and helpful\r\nin avoiding friction and in securing cooperation. If they are good\r\nlaws, it is only the \"ill-mannered\" who are really conscious of\r\ntheir existence. Just laws restrict the freedom only of the \"ill-\r\nmannered,\" while they GIVE freedom to those who have \"good\r\nmanners.\"\r\n\r\nWhat street or highway signs are there in your community? Who\r\nplaced them? Are they faithfully observed? If not, why?\r\n\r\nWhat signals are there in your school? Discuss their usefulness.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the \"rules\" of your school? Are they good rules?\r\nWhy? Are they an advantage or a disadvantage to yourself? If they\r\ndid not exist, would your own conduct be different? Why?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the rules of good manners that are supposed to\r\ncontrol conduct in your school? in your home? in the street?\r\nDiscuss their reasonableness. Do they enlarge or restrict freedom?\r\n\r\nDo the rules of football, or other games, increase or decrease the\r\nfreedom of play?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the laws that control conduct in your community?\r\nWould most people observe the laws you mention even if they were\r\nnot written laws, and if there were no penalty for failing to\r\nobserve them? Why?\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe following story illustrates the difference between law and\r\ncustom, or \"manners,\" and how the former may develop out of the\r\nlatter. [Footnote: \"Rudimentary Society among Boys,\" by John\r\nJohnson, in Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and\r\nPolitical Science, vol. ii (1884). The story as here given is\r\nreproduced from Lessons in Community and National Life, Series C,\r\np. 145, U. S. Bureau of Education (Lesson C-18, \"Cooperation\r\nthrough Law,\" by Arthur W. Dunn). ] There was once a boys' school\r\nlocated in an 800-acre tract of land, in the fields and woods of\r\nwhich the boys, when free from their studies, gathered nuts,\r\ntrapped small animals, and otherwise lived much like primitive\r\nhunters.\r\n\r\nJust after midnight some morning early in October, when the first\r\nfrosts of the season loosened the grasp of the nuts upon the\r\nlimbs, parties of two or three boys might be seen rushing at full\r\nspeed over the wet fields. When the swiftest party reached a\r\nwalnut tree, one of the number climbed up rapidly, shook off half\r\na bushel of nuts and scrambled down again. Then off the boys went\r\nto the next tree, where the process was repeated unless the tree\r\nwas occupied by other boys doing likewise. Nut hunters coming to\r\nthe tree after the first party had been there, and wishing to\r\nshake the tree some more, were required by custom to pile up all\r\nthe nuts that lay under the tree. Until this was done, the\r\nunwritten law did not permit their shaking any more nuts on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nSo far this was a CUSTOM accepted by the boys because of its\r\nreasonableness. But after a while, some members of this boy\r\ncommunity thought to get ahead of the other members. One night\r\nbefore frost came they secretly went to the woods and took\r\npossession of most of the nut trees by shaking them according to\r\ncustom. When this was discovered, some of the leaders of the\r\ncommunity CALLED A MEETING of all the boys. After discussing the\r\nmatter thoroughly, they provided against a repetition of the trick\r\nby MAKING A RULE (passing a law) that thereafter the harvesting of\r\nnuts should not begin before A FIXED DATE in October.\r\n\r\nThese boys acted very much as men have often acted under simple\r\nconditions of community life. The New England \"town meeting,\" for\r\nexample, is precisely the same thing as the boys' meeting.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND ELEMENT IN DEMOCRACY: CONTROL BY THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nWe shall study the organization and methods of lawmaking in later\r\nchapters. At present we are merely noting WHY we have laws, and\r\nthe fact that they are supposed to be made, directly or\r\nindirectly, by the people themselves. And right here we see the\r\nsecond thing necessary to make a DEMOCRACY. On page 9 we saw that\r\nin a democracy all people have certain equal and \"unalienable\"\r\nrights, and that that community is most democratic that affords\r\nits members most nearly equal opportunity to enjoy these rights.\r\nNow we see further that in a democracy the people make their own\r\nlaws. Moreover, the laws of a democracy control, not only the\r\nconduct of the people, but also the government itself. The\r\ngovernment of a democracy may do only those things, and use only\r\nthose methods, for which the people give the authority. It is only\r\nwhen government exercises power without control by the people that\r\nit becomes autocratic.\r\n\r\nTWO HISTORIC DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nThe purpose of our government is clearly stated in two historic\r\ndocuments. One of these is the Declaration of Independence, which\r\nhas already been quoted in Chapter I. The same quotation is given\r\nhere with an additional sentence in italics:\r\n\r\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\r\nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\nunalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness. That, TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS\r\nARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE\r\nCONSENT OF THE GOVERNED...\r\n\r\nThe second great document is the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, the preamble to which reads:\r\n\r\nWe, the people of the United States, in order to form a more\r\nperfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,\r\nprovide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and\r\nsecure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do\r\nordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY A GOAL STILL TO BE REACHED\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that our government and our laws are\r\nperfect. They cannot be perfect as long as they are made and\r\noperated by imperfect people. It is possible, for example, that\r\nthe boys of the city had a just complaint against the government\r\nfor not permitting them to play ball in vacant lots, UNLESS THE\r\nCOMMUNITY AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDED THEM WITH ANOTHER SUITABLE\r\nPLACE FOR THE GAME--for every community should protect the right\r\nof its boys and girls to play. We are far from having attained\r\ncomplete democracy. It is a goal toward which men are struggling,\r\nand have been struggling for centuries--since long before our\r\nRevolutionary War, and in other countries as well as in our own.\r\nThe great world war which began in 1914, and which the United\r\nStates entered in 1917, was a war to establish more firmly in the\r\nworld the principles of democratic government. Whether these\r\nprinciples shall be carried out in practice, and whether our\r\ngovernments--local, state, and national--shall fulfill the\r\npurposes so clearly stated in the preamble to the Constitution,\r\ndepends upon the extent to which each citizen understands these\r\npurposes, and cooperates with his fellow-citizens and with his\r\ngovernments in support of them.\r\n\r\nTHE \"RIGHT IDEA OF IT\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that in one of the training camps during the war an\r\nofficer addressed a squad of new recruits as follows:\r\n\r\nBoys, I want you to get the right idea of the salute. I do not\r\nwant you to think that you are being compelled to salute me as an\r\nindividual. No! When you salute me, you are simply rendering\r\nrespect to the power I represent; AND THE POWER I REPRESENT IS\r\nYOU. Now let me explain. You elect the President of the United\r\nStates, and the President of the United States grants me a\r\ncommission to represent his authority in this army. His only\r\nauthority is the authority that you vest in him when you elect him\r\nPresident. Now, when you salute an officer, you salute not the\r\nman, but the representative of your own authority. The salute is\r\ngoing to be rigidly enforced in this army, and I want you boys to\r\nget the right idea of it. I want you to know what you salute and\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that we should \"get the right idea\" of what\r\nour government is. It is very much the idea that the officer gave\r\nhis soldiers about the salute. It is the idea contained in this\r\nchapter: that government is our own organization for team work in\r\ncommunity life. All through this book we shall be engaged in\r\ndiscovering how far this is true.\r\n\r\nDo you know of instances in which the national government has\r\nhelped to secure cooperation among the farmers of your locality?\r\n\r\nDiscuss the parcel post as a means of cooperation.\r\n\r\nDuring the war with Germany the United States government assumed\r\ncontrol of all the railroads of the country. Show how this was to\r\nsecure better cooperation.\r\n\r\nIs the government of your school democratic? Explain your answer.\r\nDo you think it should be made more democratic? Why?\r\n\r\nCompare the purposes stated in the preamble to the Constitution\r\nwith the common purposes stated on page 6 of Chapter I.\r\n\r\nShow how the pupil who does as he pleases in school may interfere\r\nwith the rights and liberties of other pupils. Is it right that\r\nhis liberty should then be restricted? Why? Is liberty the right\r\nto do as one pleases? If not, what is it?\r\n\r\nRead together in class the preamble to the Constitution and\r\ncarefully discuss the meaning of each phrase.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nLessons in Community and National Life:\r\n\r\nSeries B: Lesson 17, The development of a system of laws.\r\n\r\nSeries C: Lesson 17, Custom as a basis for law.\r\n          Lesson 18, Cooperation through law.\r\n\r\nIn Long's American Patriotic Prose:\r\n\r\nLincoln, \"Mob Law,\" pp. 173-177.\r\n\r\nLincoln, \"Back to the Declaration,\" pp. 170-181.\r\n\r\nMcKinley, \"Liberty is Responsibility, Not License,\" pp. 254-255.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence, pp. 67-71.\r\n\r\nBeard, Chas.

Our bodies have members, such as arms and\r\nhands. The tongue has been called an unruly member. \"It is a\r\nlittle member and boasteth great things.\" [Footnote: James iii:\r\n5.]\r\n\r\nThere are two important facts about members of the body. One is\r\nTHAT THEY GET THEIR LIFE FROM THE BODY. If the hand is cut off, it\r\nquickly ceases to be a hand because it is severed from the source\r\nof life. If the body is seriously ill, its members are unable to\r\nperform their proper work.\r\n\r\nThe second important fact is THAT THE BODY IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS\r\nMEMBERS FOR ITS LIFE. If the hand is cut off, or an eye put out,\r\nthe body does not necessarily die, but it is seriously\r\nhandicapped. If a member is paralyzed or diseased it may be a\r\npositive hindrance to the body, and the disease may spread to\r\nother members. The body may suffer merely because its members are\r\npoorly trained.\r\n\r\nIN THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nThat is what it means to be a member of the body; and membership\r\nin a family, or a school, or a club, or a community, is just the\r\nsame. We have already seen, and we shall see more fully as we go\r\non with our study, how completely we are dependent upon our\r\ncommunities for food, for the protection of life, for education,\r\nand for all else that makes up our life. The community that does\r\nnot provide for its members in these things is like a sick body.\r\nOn the other hand, as members of a community we are always\r\ncontributing something to its life--either to its advantage or\r\ndisadvantage. Of course, each of us is only one of a great many\r\nmembers in a large community, and we may seem to be very\r\nunimportant. But each performs his part, whether it be great or\r\nsmall, and whether he does it well or poorly.\r\n\r\nCITIZENSHIP MEANS MEMBERSHIP\r\n\r\nNow we often speak of members of a community as CITIZENS of that\r\ncommunity. CITIZENSHIP means practically the same thing as\r\nmembership in the community. As a good community is one that\r\nprovides well for its members, so the good citizen is the member\r\nwho does well his part in the life of the community. A bad citizen\r\nis the member who hinders the progress of the community when he\r\nmight be helping. A citizen has certain RIGHTS and certain DUTIES.\r\nHis rights are what the community owes him; his duties are what he\r\nowes the community.\r\n\r\nTRAINED AND UNTRAINED CITIZENS\r\n\r\nThere are many members of communities who are like the diseased or\r\nparalyzed hand, or like the hand that is untrained. A member of an\r\nathletic team who does not \"train\" will probably be dropped from\r\nthe team--he fails to become an athlete. A member of a community,\r\nor a citizen, who does not \"train\" still remains a member, but an\r\ninefficient one. He is a handicap to his community and interferes\r\nwith community team work. The part that a member plays in\r\ncommunity life may be more important than he realizes. Even in\r\nsmall things, \"the falling short of one may mean disaster to\r\nmany.\" Each member of a community, like each member of a body,\r\nmust be not only in a healthy condition but also well trained.\r\n\r\nWHO ARE CITIZENS\r\n\r\nLet us not make the mistake of thinking that we are not yet\r\ncitizens because we are young. The Constitution of the United\r\nStates says that \"ALL PERSONS born or naturalized in the United\r\nStates and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" (that is, subject\r\nto its laws) \"are citizens of the United States and of the state\r\nwherein they reside.\" Even persons born in foreign countries and\r\nwho have not yet been naturalized [Footnote: \"Naturalization\" is\r\nthe legal process by which persons of foreign birth renounce their\r\nallegiance to the land of their birth and pledge their allegiance\r\nto our government.] enjoy almost all the rights of native-born\r\nAmericans, and therefore have much of the responsibility of\r\ncitizenship. Until they are naturalized they are still considered\r\nmembers of the country from which they came, and therefore as\r\nowing certain duties to that country which would be inconsistent\r\nwith their duties as members of our nation. Therefore they are\r\ndenied certain POLITICAL rights, such as voting and holding\r\noffice. [Footnote: In a few states even unnaturalized persons are\r\nallowed to vote after they have declared their intention of\r\nbecoming citizens.] These same political rights are denied to\r\nnative-born citizens until they have reached maturity. But we must\r\nnot confuse this right to vote with citizenship.\r\n\r\nExplain how the idea of membership as described in the text\r\napplies to your membership in the family; to membership in a club;\r\nin a church; in a farmers' cooperative organization.\r\n\r\nCan you be a member of your class or school without doing it\r\neither good or harm? Explain your answer.\r\n\r\nRead Romans xii: 4-8 and James iii: 5-8.\r\n\r\nShow how an injury or a benefit to one pupil in the school may be\r\nan injury or a benefit to the entire school. Give illustrations to\r\nprove this.\r\n\r\nShow how a failure to save food, to buy savings stamps, or to\r\nperform other services that one is able to perform, weakened our\r\nnation and other nations who were her allies during the war with\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nMake a list of things you have done during the week for the\r\nbenefit of your school; for the welfare of your neighborhood,\r\ntown, or school district. Do you do as much for your family,\r\nschool, or community as they do for you?\r\n\r\nTurn to Amendment XIV of the Constitution of the United States\r\n(see Appendix), and read the entire first section containing the\r\ndefinition of a citizen. Discuss the meaning of the section.\r\n\r\nAt what age does the native-born citizen acquire the right to\r\nvote? Why is he not allowed to vote before that time?\r\n\r\nWhat native-born citizens of the United States do not have the\r\nright to vote even after they are of voting age?\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nIn Long's American Patriotic Prose:\r\n\r\nDoane, \"The Men to Make a State,\" pp. 236-238.\r\n\r\nLane, \"Makers of the Flag,\" pp. 314-316.\r\n\r\nSteiner, \"On Becoming an American Citizen,\" pp. 317-320.\r\n\r\nWilson, \"To Newly-Made Citizens,\" pp. 322-326.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWHAT IS OUR COMMUNITY?\r\n\r\nELEMENTS THAT MAKE A COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have often spoken of \"our community.\"\r\nAs a matter of fact, each of us is a member of a number of\r\ncommunities. It is time to consider just what they are\r\n\r\nEvery community, of course, consists of a GROUP OF PEOPLE who\r\noccupy a more or less DEFINITE LOCALITY. Much depends, in\r\ncommunity life, upon the character of both the people and the\r\nlocality they occupy. But the essential thing about a community is\r\nthat the people who comprise it are WORKING TOGETHER (cooperating)\r\nunder an ORGANIZATION (government) for the COMMON GOOD (common\r\npurposes).\r\n\r\nLARGE AND SMALL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nA neighborhood of farmers with their families may constitute a\r\ncommunity. In this case the area occupied may be extensive while\r\nthe people are few in number. Or the community may be a city with\r\na population very large in proportion to area it occupies. There\r\nare villages, towns, and small cities of varying sizes both as to\r\npopulation and area. Each state in our Union is a community and so\r\nis the nation itself because each is composed of a group of people\r\n(very large in these cases), occupying a definite territory (also\r\nlarge), and having a government through which the people are\r\nworking for common ends. There is a world community, but it is, as\r\nyet, very imperfect. The nations and peoples that comprise it have\r\nbeen slow to recognize their common purposes and have so far\r\nfailed to develop adequate means of cooperation, (See Chapter\r\nVIII.)\r\n\r\nIs your class a community? (Apply the definition given above.)\r\nWhat common interests does it have? Has it any government or laws?\r\nIs your school a community? Apply the same tests as above.\r\n\r\nIs your home a community? What are some of its common interests?\r\nAre there laws in your family?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the things in which your family and your nearest\r\nneighbors have a common interest because of living close together?\r\nDo your family and your neighbors work together to provide for\r\nthese interests?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the things in which all the people of your city\r\nor village (or the one nearest to you) have a common interest, and\r\nwhich the city, or village, government helps to provide for?\r\n\r\nINTERDEPENDENCE OF RURAL AND CITY COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nA community of farmers has interests of its own, largely centering\r\naround farming activities, or the social life of the local\r\nneighborhood. A few miles away is a village or city whose people\r\nalso have their own peculiar interests, such as the lighting of\r\nthe streets at night, or the building of a new high school, or the\r\nelection of a mayor. Yet there are interests common to both the\r\nfarming community and the city community. The city is dependent\r\nupon the country for its food supply, and the farmers are\r\ndependent upon the city for their market. Probably some of the\r\nfarmers send their children to the city schools. Thus city and\r\nrural communities are bound together into a larger community with\r\ninterests common to both.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of western settlement a community was founded in\r\nIllinois. It was an agricultural community, but in the midst of it\r\na village grew, which in the course of time became a small city.\r\nOne of the first settlers was a young farmer with a mechanical\r\nturn of mind. He began experimenting to improve the methods of\r\nplanting grain. The result was the invention of a corn planter,\r\nthe manufacture of which became one of the chief industries of the\r\ngrowing city, employing hundreds of men and sending machines to\r\nall parts of the world. Another young farmer invented a better\r\nplow than those which had been in use, the manufacture of which\r\nbecame another of the city's industries. In those pioneer days\r\neach family usually made its own brooms, but one young man in this\r\ncommunity earned his way through the local college by making\r\nbrooms from corn raised on the college farm. The college cornfield\r\ndisappeared in the course of time, but on one part of it there\r\ngrew up a broom factory employing a large number of workmen. These\r\ncity industries were thus literally \"children of the soil,\" and\r\nthe city's prosperity depended upon the agriculture of the\r\nsurrounding region. On the other hand, the city provided the\r\nfarmers with improved plows and corn planters, furnished them an\r\nimmediate market for their products, supplied them with goods\r\nthrough its shops and stores, and gave education to hundreds of\r\nfarmers' children in its schools and college.\r\n\r\nNEED FOR RURAL AND CITY TEAMWORK\r\n\r\nSometimes jealousies and antagonisms arise between small\r\nneighboring communities, and especially between rural and city\r\ncommunities. This interferes with the progress of both\r\ncommunities, and of the larger community of which each is a part.\r\nIt may be proposed to build a township high school. It is natural\r\nthat the several communities that comprise the township should\r\neach want it. But the interest of the entire township should be\r\nconsidered in determining the location of the school, and not\r\nmerely the advantage of one local district as against others. It\r\nsometimes happens that the people of a city are exempted from\r\ntaxation for county purposes outside of the city, although the\r\nbenefits would be almost, if not quite as great, for the city as\r\nfor the country. This sort of thing serves to set off city and\r\ncountry against each other instead of binding them together to\r\ntheir mutual advantage. The case of Christian County, Kentucky,\r\ndescribed in Chapter III, is an excellent illustration of teamwork\r\nbetween city and country in the interest of the entire county, and\r\nof the results achieved by it.\r\n\r\nSMALL COMMUNITIES UNITE IN LARGE ONES\r\n\r\nIn this chapter there are three maps of Dane County, Wisconsin,\r\nwhich show how small communities, both rural and urban, are united\r\ninto a large community, the county. Map I shows the school\r\ndistricts and the townships which comprise the county. The city of\r\nMadison occupies the center, and small towns and villages are\r\nscattered here and there. The country school is the chief center\r\nof interest in each school district. Here and there through the\r\ncounty are high schools. Each of these is a center of a larger\r\nirregular area, including a number of school districts and parts\r\nof several townships as shown in map 2. Map 3 shows TRADE AREAS.\r\nTrade and education are two of the chief interests that bind\r\npeople into communities. But where these interests exist, there\r\nare likely to be other interests; the high school is likely to be\r\na meeting place for social and recreational purposes.\r\n\r\nThe area and boundaries of a \"farming\" or \"rural neighborhood\"\r\ncommunity are usually rather indefinite and changeable, depending\r\nupon surface features and upon transportation conditions, or the\r\nlength of the \"day's haul.\" With improved roads and better means\r\nof transportation, larger areas and more people are included. A\r\n\"neighborhood\" or \"trade area\" with automobiles is much larger\r\nthan one where horses or ox carts are used exclusively. The\r\nconsolidated school with transportation provided for pupils\r\nexpands the rural neighborhood community.\r\n\r\nCOMMON INTERESTS OF THE LARGER COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nEach of the small dots on map 3 represents a farm home. If we\r\nselect one of these dots and imagine ourselves members of the\r\nfamily that lives there, we shall see that we are members of a\r\ncertain school district, of a certain township, of a community\r\nthat has grown up around a trade center and a high school, and of\r\ncourse of the county as a whole. No matter in what school district\r\nwe live, we have an interest in some matters in common with the\r\npeople of all other school districts in the county. For example,\r\nthere is a state university at Madison, and connected with it is a\r\ntraining school for teachers. The work done here influences the\r\nteaching in all the schools of the county, and indeed of the whole\r\nstate. There is also an agricultural college at the state\r\nuniversity which serves the farmers throughout the entire county\r\nand state. If we look closely at map 3, we shall see how highways\r\nand railroads center at Madison, which is the county seat of Dane\r\nCounty and the capital of the state of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nJust as the many small communities that make up a county are\r\ndependent upon one another, requiring organized cooperation for\r\nthe county welfare, so all the counties of a state, and all the\r\npeople who live in all the counties, are interdependent in many\r\nways. The people of the city of Madison, for example, depend for\r\ntheir food supply upon the farmers not only of Dane County but of\r\nthe entire state. The university at Madison serves not Dane County\r\nalone, but the people of all the counties of the state. The public\r\nschools of the state should be equally good in all counties and\r\nmanaged by a uniform plan. Roads and other means of transportation\r\nare a matter of concern to the entire state. And so the state is a\r\ncommunity, organized with a government, to secure cooperation\r\namong all the people and all the smaller communities that compose\r\nit. In fact, a large part of the business of the governments of\r\nthe local communities, such as city and county and township, is to\r\nadminister the laws of the central state government.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, the forty-eight states of the Union, with all\r\nthe counties and smaller communities of which they consist,\r\ncomprise our great national community, of which we are all\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITIES IN THE LARGER COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of \"our community\" we are likely to think at once of\r\nthe small community immediately around us--our neighborhood,\r\nvillage, or city. Our citizenship in these local communities is\r\nextremely important, and will demand no small part of our\r\nattention. But it is equally important to be fully alive to our\r\ncitizenship in the larger communities. This is true wherever we\r\nlive; but there is a sense in which our national community is\r\npeculiarly important to those of us who live in rural communities.\r\nThe wants of people in cities are, as a rule, looked after more\r\ncompletely by their local governments than is the case in rural\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nThe people of rural communities, and especially farmers\r\nthemselves, are directly served by the national government in a\r\ngreat variety of ways. In the next chapter we shall consider our\r\nnation as a community.\r\n\r\nShow how the different classes of your school are bound together\r\nby interests common to the entire school. Compare this union of\r\nclasses with the union of states into a nation. What constitutes\r\nthe government of your school?\r\n\r\nMention some things in which all the people of your county have a\r\nspecial interest. Are these things of equal interest to farmers\r\nand townspeople?\r\n\r\nDo the farmers and townspeople of your county work well together,\r\nor are there conflicts between them? If there are conflicts, what\r\nare the causes?\r\n\r\nPoint out some ways in which the prosperity and welfare of the\r\nfarmers of your locality depend upon a neighboring city or town.\r\nAlso some ways in which, the city or town depend upon the\r\nneighboring farmers.\r\n\r\nIf there is organized cooperation in your county, similar to that\r\ndescribed on page 32, has it been brought about or encouraged by\r\ngovernment, or solely by voluntary effort on the part of citizens?\r\nIf the government had anything to do with it, was it the county\r\ngovernment, state government, or national government?\r\n\r\nHas farmland increased or decreased in value in your locality\r\nsince your father was a boy? Can you show a relation between this\r\nchange in value of farmland and the growth of nearby towns or\r\ncities?\r\n\r\nWhat industries in your town (or a neighboring town) are dependent\r\nupon farming for their raw materials? for the sale of their\r\nproduct?\r\n\r\nWhat is the cotton gin? the spinning jenny? Show how these\r\ninventions were a benefit to agriculture. How did they promote the\r\ngrowth of cities?\r\n\r\nMake a map of your school district. Do the people of this district\r\ncooperate in matters other than those pertaining to the school?\r\n\r\nOn a map of your county, show approximately the \"trade area\"\r\nserved by the \"trade center\" nearest you.

This is not always easy to do because of its\r\nhuge size and complicated character. It would be wrong, too, to\r\nget the idea that it is a perfect community--none of our\r\ncommunities is perfect. Conflicts of interest are often more\r\napparent than community of interest. Teamwork among the different\r\nparts and groups that make up our nation is often very poor.\r\nAlthough our government is a wonderfully good one, it is still\r\nonly an imperfect means of cooperation. Our nation is far from\r\nbeing a complete democracy, for there are many people in it who do\r\nnot have the full enjoyment of life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness; and large numbers of our \"self-governing\" people really\r\nhave little or no part in government.\r\n\r\nLOYALTY TO IDEALS\r\n\r\nIt need not give us an unpatriotic feeling to acknowledge the\r\nimperfections of our nation or of our government; for communities\r\nGROW, not only in size, but also in ability to perform their\r\nproper work, just as individuals do. We call a person conceited\r\nwho thinks that he is perfect, especially if he boasts of it. But\r\nhis conceit is itself an imperfection and a hindrance to growth.\r\nSo the patriotic citizen is not one who is unable to see defects\r\nin his community, or who refuses to acknowledge them, but one who\r\nhas high CIVIC IDEALS and is loyal to them, who understands in\r\nwhat respects these ideals have not been reached, and who, as a\r\nmember of the community, contributes everything he can to keep it\r\ngrowing in THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\r\n\r\n\"The problem of government is, after all, the problem of human\r\ngrowth. ... The one constant and inconstant quantity with which\r\nman must deal is man--changing, inert, impulsive, limited,\r\nsympathetic, selfish, aspiring man. His institutions, whether\r\nsocial or political, must come out of his wants and out of his\r\ncapacities. Luther Burbank has not yet made grapes to grow on\r\nthorns or figs on thistles. Neither has any system of government\r\nmade all men wise...\"--FRANKLIN K. LANE.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for a community to be 100 percent perfect? Why?\r\n\r\nWhat people in your community take no part in government?\r\n\r\nMay people who cannot vote have any influence upon government?\r\nExplain.\r\n\r\nHas a good citizen a right to criticize his government? What is\r\nthe difference between helpful and harmful criticism?\r\n\r\nWhat is an \"ideal\"? a \"civic ideal\"?\r\n\r\nWELDING OF THE NATION BY WAR\r\n\r\nIt is easier now than usual to think of our nation as a community,\r\nbecause the war with Germany served to arouse our \"national\r\nspirit,\" and showed very clearly the importance in our national\r\nlife of those elements which characterize all community life--\r\ncommon purpose, interdependence, and organized, cooperation (see\r\nChapters I-III). The creation of a National Army did much to bring\r\nthis about.\r\n\r\nWhen the benefits which come to the nation through the creation of\r\nthe National Army are catalogued, the fact that it has welded the\r\ncountry into a homogeneous society, [Footnote: \"Homogeneous\r\nsociety\"--a society or community all of whose parts and members\r\nhave like purposes and interests.] seeking the same national ends\r\nand animated by the same national ideals, will overtop all other\r\nadvantages. The organization of the selected Army fuses the\r\nthousand separate elements making up the United States into one\r\nsteel-hard mass. Men of the North, South, East, and West meet and\r\nmingle, and on the anvil of war become citizens worthy of the\r\nliberty won by the first American armies. [Footnote: Major\r\nGranville R. Fortesque, in National Geographic Magazine, Dec.,\r\n1917]. How this welding of the parts of the nation together was\r\nbrought about by the war is suggested by the words of an old\r\nConfederate soldier who wrote to a friend in the North:\r\n\r\n\"During the war between the states I was a rebel, and continued\r\none in heart until this great war. But now I am a devoted follower\r\nof Uncle Sam and endorse him in every respect.\"\r\n\r\nDIVERSE ELEMENTS IN OUR NATION\r\n\r\nThe fact that our nation contained in its population large numbers\r\nof people from practically every country of Europe caused no\r\nlittle anxiety when we entered the European war. Our population\r\nembraces a hundred different races and nationalities. Of these,\r\nten million are negroes and three hundred thirty-six thousand are\r\nIndians. Thirty-three million are of foreign parentage, and of\r\nthese, thirteen million are foreign-born. Five million do not\r\nspeak English, and there are one thousand five hundred news papers\r\nin the United States printed in foreign languages. Five and one-\r\nhalf million above the age of ten years, including both foreign\r\nand native, cannot read or write in any language. New York City\r\nhas a larger Hebrew population than any other city in the world,\r\ncontains more Italians than Rome, and its German population is the\r\nfourth largest among the cities of the world. Pittsburgh has more\r\nSerbs than the capital of Serbia. It is said that there were more\r\nGreeks subject to draft in the American army than there were in\r\nthe entire army of Greece. Would all these people be loyal to our\r\nnation, or would they divide it against itself?\r\n\r\nLOYALTY OF DIVERSE ELEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe war, in fact, showed us that there were some among us who had\r\nnever really become \"members\" of our nation and who were dangerous\r\nto our peace and safety. It also showed us the danger that comes\r\nfrom the presence of so many illiterates, or of those who cannot\r\nuse the English language; for such people, even though loyal in\r\nspirit to the United States, cannot understand instructions either\r\nin the army or in industry, and otherwise prevent effective\r\ncooperation. And yet the most striking thing that the war showed\r\nus in regard to this mixed population is that the great mass of\r\nit, regardless of color or place of birth, is really American in\r\nspirit and loyal to our flag and the ideas which it represents.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SAFETY DEPENDS ON HARMONY\r\n\r\nAnother weakness within our nation that the war emphasized is the\r\nlack of harmony between wage earners and their employers. There\r\nwere many sharp conflicts between them. Strikes occurred, or were\r\nthreatened, in factories, shipyards, mines, and railroads, that\r\nblocked the wheels of industry at a time when the nation needed to\r\nstrain every nerve to provide the materials of war. This lack of\r\nharmony between workmen and employers, which in war threatened our\r\nnational safety, has existed for many years and has always been an\r\nobstacle to national progress. But the common purpose of winning\r\nthe war caused employers and wage earners, in most cases, to\r\nadjust their differences. In nearly every case, one side or the\r\nother, or both sides, yielded certain points and agreed not to\r\ndispute over others, at least for the period of the war. The\r\nnational government did much to bring this about by the creation\r\nof labor adjustment boards to hear complaints from either side and\r\nto settle disputes. If our national community life is to develop\r\nin a wholesome way, complete cooperation between workmen and\r\nemployers must be secured and made permanent on the basis of\r\ninterests that are common to both.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF A COMMON PURPOSE\r\n\r\nSuch facts as these show how easy it is, in a huge, complex\r\ncommunity like our nation, for conflicts to arise among different\r\nsections and groups of the population; and how difficult it is\r\nalways to see the common interests that exist. But they also show\r\nhow such conflicts tend to disappear when a situation arises which\r\nforces us to think of the common interests instead of the\r\ndifferences. All else was forgotten in the common purpose to \"win\r\nthe war.\" No sacrifice was too great on the part of any individual\r\nin order that this national purpose might be served. Everywhere\r\nthroughout the country, in cities and in remote rural districts,\r\nservice flags in the windows testified that the homes of the land\r\nwere offering members that the nation and its ideals might live.\r\nMen, women, and even children contributed their work and their\r\nsavings and denied themselves customary comforts to help win the\r\nwar. THE ENTIRE NATION WAS WORKING TOGETHER FOR A COMMON PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nOUR NATIONAL PURPOSE\r\n\r\nWe have said that this common purpose was to \"win the war.\" But\r\nthere were purposes that lie much deeper than this, without which\r\nit would not have been worth while to enter the war at all. As we\r\nsaw in Chapter I, our nation is founded on a belief in the right\r\nof every one to life and physical well-being; to be secure in\r\none's rightful possessions; to freedom of thought--education, free\r\nspeech, a free press; to freedom of religion; to happiness in\r\npleasant surroundings and a wholesome social life; and, above all,\r\nto a voice in the government which exists to protect these rights.\r\nIt was to secure a larger freedom to enjoy these rights, \"for\r\nourselves first and for all others in their time,\" that our nation\r\nwas solidly united against the enemy that threatened it from\r\nwithout. But it was with this same purpose that the War of\r\nIndependence was fought, that our Constitution was adopted, that\r\nslavery was abolished, that millions of people from foreign lands\r\nhave come to our shores. It is this common purpose that makes the\r\ngreat mass of foreigners in our country Americans, ready to fight\r\nfor America, if necessary even against the land of their birth. It\r\nis this for which the American flag stands at all times, whether\r\nin peace or in war.\r\n\r\nWhat proof can you give of a \"national spirit\" in your locality\r\nduring the war?\r\n\r\nWhat evidence can you give to show that this national spirit is or\r\nis not as strong since the war closed?\r\n\r\nWhat was the \"National Army\"? the \"National Guard\"? Which of these\r\norganizations was most likely to develop a \"national spirit\"? Why?\r\nWhat good reasons can you give for the action of the government in\r\nconsolidating the Regular Army, the National Army, and the\r\nNational Guard into a \"United States Army\"?\r\n\r\nWhat arguments can you give in favor of requiring all instruction\r\nin the public schools to be given in the English language?\r\n\r\nWhat arguments can you give in favor of teaching lessons in\r\ncitizenship in foreign-language newspapers?\r\n\r\nWhat foreign nationalities are represented in your locality?\r\n\r\nMake a blackboard table showing the nationality of the parents and\r\ngrandparents of each member of your class.\r\n\r\nGive illustrations to show that \"winning the war\" was the\r\ncontrolling purpose in your community during the war.\r\n\r\nIn what way has the war made YOU think about the right-to-life and\r\nthe need for physical well-being? about security in property?\r\nabout freedom of thought? about the desirability of an education?\r\nabout the right of people to pleasant surroundings? about self-\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\nShow how the Spanish-American war was fought for the same purpose\r\nas that mentioned in the paragraph above.\r\n\r\nWrite a brief theme on \"What the Flag Means to Me.\"\r\n\r\nNATIONAL INTERDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nThe attempt to work together in the war made it very apparent how\r\ndependent the nation is upon all its parts, and how dependent each\r\npart is upon all the others. It was often said that \"the farmers\r\nwould win the war.\" At other times it was said to be ships, or\r\nfuel, or airplanes, or railroad transportation, or trained\r\nscientists and technical workers. The truth is, of course, that\r\nall these things and many more were absolutely necessary, and that\r\nno one of them would have been of much value without all the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the winning of the war depended upon the farmers,\r\nbecause they are the producers of the food and of the raw\r\nmaterials for textiles without which the nation and every group\r\nand person in it would have been helpless. But the farmer could\r\nnot supply food to the nation without machinery for its\r\nproduction, and without city markets and railroads and ships for\r\nits distribution. Machinery could not be made, nor ships and\r\nlocomotives built, without steel. For the manufacture of steel\r\nthere must be iron and fuel and tungsten and other materials. And\r\nfor all these things there must be inventors and skilled\r\nmechanics, and to produce these there must be schools. And so we\r\ncould go on indefinitely to show how the war made us feel our\r\ninterdependence. What we need to understand, however, is that THIS\r\nINTERDEPENDENCE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE AT ALL\r\nTIMES; the war only made us feel it more keenly.\r\n\r\nNATION-BUILDING IN WAR TIME\r\n\r\nDuring the war, strange as it may seem, while we were devoting our\r\nnational energies to the work of destruction incident to war, we\r\nas a nation made astonishing progress in many ways other than in\r\nthe art of war--in what we might call nation-building.\r\n\r\nIn some ways we made progress in a year or two that under ordinary\r\ncircumstances might have required a generation. A striking\r\nillustration of this is in the development of a great fleet of\r\nmerchant ships at a rate that would have been impossible before\r\nthe war. Beginning with almost nothing when the war began, we had,\r\nin less than two years, a merchant fleet larger than that of any\r\nother nation, and that in spite of the constant destruction of\r\nships by the enemy. The chairman of the shipping board of the\r\nUnited States government says that this is because the necessities\r\nof the war made the whole nation see how much it depends upon\r\nships, and caused not only ship-builders, but also engineers and\r\nmanufacturers and businessmen and the Navy department of the\r\ngovernment, and many others, to concentrate upon this problem,\r\nwith the result that we discovered methods of shipbuilding, and of\r\nloading and unloading and operating ships when they were built,\r\nthat will probably enable us to maintain permanently a merchant\r\nmarine, the lack of which we have deplored for many years.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way we discovered and brought into use valuable\r\nnatural resources of whose existence we had largely been ignorant\r\nand for which we had been dependent upon other nations. We made\r\nastonishing progress in scientific knowledge, and especially in\r\nthe application of this knowledge to invention and to industrial\r\nenterprises. We developed a new interest in agriculture, and\r\nlearned the food values of many products that had formerly been\r\nneglected. We were led to attack seriously the great problem of\r\nsuitable housing for workmen, and had an important lesson in the\r\nrelation between wholesome home-life and industrial efficiency\r\n(see Chapter X, pp. 112-113). Foundations were laid for the\r\nadjustment of the unfortunate differences that have long existed\r\nbetween workmen and their employers. The war suggested changes in\r\nour educational methods, some of which will doubtless become\r\neffective, to the great improvement of our public schools,\r\ncolleges, and technical schools.\r\n\r\nWe shall study some of these things more fully in later chapters.\r\nThey are mentioned now to illustrate how OUR NATIONAL PROGRESS WAS\r\nSTIMULATED WHEN THE WAR FORCED US TO SEE THE RELATION OF ALL THESE\r\nTHINGS TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR NATIONAL\r\nPURPOSE. On the other hand, failure to recognize this national\r\ninterdependence means slow progress as a national community. When\r\nthe war began, our nation was said to be \"unprepared.\" Insofar as\r\nthis was true--and it was true in many particulars--it was because\r\nin the times of peace before the war we had not thought enough\r\nabout the dependence of our national strength and safety upon all\r\nthese factors in our national life WORKING TOGETHER. And so, in\r\nthe times of peace AFTER THE WAR, if the purposes for which our\r\nnation fought are to be fulfilled, we must continue to profit by\r\nthis lesson which the war has taught us.\r\n\r\nRecall your discussion of national interdependence in connection\r\nwith your study of Chapter II.\r\n\r\nReport on some of the important scientific and commercial\r\ndevelopments resulting from the war; as, for example:\r\n\r\nThe development of the commercial use of the airplane.\r\n\r\nThe development of new food supplies.\r\n\r\nThe production of fertilizer from the nitrogen of the air.\r\n\r\nThe development of new industries in the United States.\r\n\r\nChanges in methods of farming.\r\n\r\nWhat are some changes in education that are likely to result from\r\nthe war?\r\n\r\nShow how the strike of coal miners in 1919 affected the life of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nTHE \"SUPREME TEST\" OF THE NATION\r\n\r\nThe \"working together\" of all these interdependent parts is the\r\nimportant thing. \"The supreme test of the nation has come,\" said\r\nPresident Wilson. \"We must all speak, act, and serve together.\"\r\n[Footnote: Message to the American People, April 15, 1919].\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nIt is not an army that we must shape and train for war ... it is a\r\nNation. To this end our people must draw close in one compact\r\nfront against a common foe. But this cannot be if each man pursues\r\na private purpose. The Nation needs all men, but it needs each\r\nman, not in the field that will most pleasure him, but in the\r\nendeavor that will best serve the common good. ... The whole\r\nNation must be a team, in which each man must play the part for\r\nwhich he is best fitted. [Footnote: Conscription Proclamation, May\r\n18, 1917.]\r\n\r\nTHE NATION AS A TEAM\r\n\r\nWe had some suggestion on page 72 of how such national team work\r\nbecame a fact. \"Do your bit!\" was the watch-word. It was splendid\r\nto see how personal interests gave way before the desire to serve\r\nthe nation. It is a thrilling story how the racial elements in our\r\npopulation forgot their differences of race and language and\r\nremembered only that they were American; how employers and\r\nemployees laid aside their differences; how farmers and\r\nbusinessmen, manufacturers and mechanics, miners and woodsmen,\r\ninventors and teachers, women in the home and children in the\r\nschools, doctors and nurses, and every other class and group\r\nsubordinated their personal interests to the one national purpose\r\nof winning the war in order that \"the world might become a decent\r\nplace in which to live.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the United States entered the war, Washington, the\r\nnation's capital, became filled with people from all parts of the\r\ncountry who wanted to help in some way. Some were called there by\r\nthe government; others came to volunteer their services and to\r\noffer ideas that they thought useful. Many came as representatives\r\nof organizations--business and industrial organizations,\r\nscientific associations, civic societies. New committees and\r\nassociations were formed, until the number of voluntary citizen\r\norganizations eager to do \"war work\" became almost too numerous to\r\nremember. They were all an indication of the desire of the people\r\nto do their part in the national enterprise.\r\n\r\nCONFUSION WITHOUT ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nBut there followed a period of confusion. All these organizations\r\nand the people whom they represented wanted to help, but they did\r\nnot always know just what to do nor how to do it. Each\r\norganization had its own ideas which it often magnified above all\r\nothers. Different organizations wanted to accomplish the same\r\npurpose, but wanted to do it in different ways. Often they\r\nduplicated one another's efforts. A war could not be won under\r\nsuch conditions. But out of all this confusion there finally\r\ndeveloped order, and this was because the various organizations of\r\npeople realized that if they were to accomplish anything they must\r\nwork in cooperation with the national government, whose business\r\nit was, after all, to organize the nation for united action. In\r\nfact, it was for this reason that they came to Washington. Many of\r\nthem sought to influence the government to adopt this or that\r\nplan, and sometimes succeeded; but it was the government that\r\nfinally decided what plans were to be adopted, and all of the\r\neffort of the numerous organizations and of individuals must be\r\nbrought into harmony with these.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL TEAM WORK THROUGH GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe period of the war afforded many striking examples of national\r\ncooperation secured by the government. It may have seemed\r\nsometimes that our government interfered with personal freedom to\r\nan unreasonable extent, as when it limited the amount of coal we\r\ncould buy, fixed the prices of many articles, determined the wages\r\nthat should be paid for labor, took over the management of the\r\nrailroads and of the telegraph and telephone lines, and did many\r\nother things that it never had done in times of peace. We expected\r\ngovernment to exercise powers in war time that it would not be\r\npermitted to exercise in times of peace. But it can be shown that\r\neven during the war, the government, with all its unusual powers,\r\ndid not \"ride roughshod\" over the people, but sought to \"make them\r\npartners in an enterprise which after all was their own.\" The\r\nnation was fighting for its life and for the very principles upon\r\nwhich it was founded, and it was necessary that cooperation should\r\nbe complete and effective. This was what the government sought,\r\nand it exercised its powers by inviting and obtaining national\r\ncooperation to a remarkable extent.\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTIVE DRAFT AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF TEAM WORK\r\n\r\nOur national army was created by a \"selective\" draft, or\r\nconscription. Conscription had formerly been looked upon with\r\ndisfavor as a form of forced military service. A volunteer army\r\nwas thought to be more in harmony with a democratic form of\r\ngovernment. But the draft is now seen to be far more democratic\r\nthan a volunteer army because it treats all able-bodied men alike,\r\ninstead of leaving the fighting to those who are most courageous\r\nand most patriotic, while those who are inclined to shirk may\r\neasily do so. Moreover, the SELECTIVE draft means the selection of\r\nmen to serve in the capacity for which they are best fitted. In\r\nGreat Britain, under a volunteer system, and in France, under a\r\nsystem of compulsory military service for all men, thousands of\r\nbrave men went to the trenches in the early days of the war who,\r\nbecause of their training, should have been kept at home to\r\nperform the vast amount of skilled labor and scientific work which\r\nthis war demanded. War industry, without which there could be no\r\nfighting, was thus greatly hampered.\r\n\r\nBy our selective draft, on the other hand, while every man was\r\nexpected to do his share, each was selected as far as possible to\r\ndo the thing which he could do best and therefore which would best\r\nserve the country. It also sought to prevent those who had\r\nfamilies dependent upon them from going to war until they were\r\nabsolutely needed. Thus the selective draft is an example of\r\ngovernment organizing our national manpower for more effective\r\nteamwork and with less hardship than if it had been left to\r\nvoluntary action.\r\n\r\nTEAM WORK THROUGH THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nThe United States Food Administration was created by the President\r\nto carry out the provisions of a law passed by Congress\", to\r\nprovide further for the national security and defense by\r\nencouraging the production, conserving the supply, and controlling\r\nthe distribution of food products and fuel.\" The President placed\r\nat its head a man in whom the people of the country had great\r\nconfidence, because of his experience and success in organizing\r\nand managing the Belgian relief work, Mr. Herbert Hoover. He\r\ngathered around him men familiar with the problems relating to the\r\nfood supply of the nation, and then proceeded to enlighten the\r\ncountry in regard to the nature of these problems and to seek for\r\nthe cooperation of the people in solving them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was appointed, the food administrator issued a\r\nstatement containing the following facts:\r\n\r\nWhereas we exported before the war but 80,000,000 bushels of wheat\r\nper annum, this year we must find for all our allies 225,000,000\r\nbushels, and this in the face of a short crop. ... France and\r\nItaly formerly produced their own sugar, while England and Ireland\r\nimported largely from Germany. Owing to the inability of the\r\nfirst-named to produce more than one third of their needs, and the\r\nnecessity for the others to import from other markets, they must\r\nall come to the West Indies for their very large supplies, and\r\ntherefore deplete our resources.\r\n\r\nIf we can reduce our consumption of wheat flour by 1 pound, our\r\nmeat by 7 ounces, our sugar by 7 ounces, our fat by 7 ounces PER\r\nPERSON PER WEEK, these quantities, multiplied by 100,000,000 (the\r\npopulation of the United States) will immeasurably aid and\r\nencourage our allies, help our own growing armies, and so\r\neffectively serve the great and noble cause of humanity in which\r\nour nation has embarked.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY A PARTNERSHIP\r\n\r\nThis illustrates how the Food Administration sought cooperation.\r\nIt \"made partners\" of the people, explained to them the situation,\r\nand asked them to help as individuals. It showed the nation what\r\nit must do if it were to be successful in its undertaking. It is\r\ntrue that the President had large powers to enforce observance of\r\nthe rules outlined by the Food Administration, but it was only in\r\nthe exceptional case of the individual consumer and producer who\r\nrefused to cooperate for the common good that it became necessary\r\nto use the power. The method of democracy is to point out clearly\r\nhow the desired result may be obtained and to depend upon the\r\npeople to govern themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of the war a member of the Food Administration is\r\nquoted as saying, [Footnote: In an article on \"Your Wheatless\r\nDays,\" by W. A. Wolff, in Collier's Weekly, Aug. 17, 1918.]\r\n\"There's never been anything like it in history. ... We asked the\r\nAmerican people to do voluntarily more than any other people has\r\never been asked to do under compulsion. And the American people\r\nmade good!\"\r\n\r\nWhat was true in the unusual time of war is true to even a greater\r\nextent in the ordinary time of peace. We have little to fear from\r\nour national government as long as we and those to whom we entrust\r\nits management, always keep in mind its real purpose, which is to\r\nshow us how to work together effectively as a nation and to help\r\nus do it.\r\n\r\nEVERY MAN COUNTS\r\n\r\nAll through this study we are going to observe how in the ordinary\r\naffairs of life our national government serves us in this respect.\r\nOne thing that we need especially to learn is that we have a great\r\nnational purpose ALL THE TIME, in peace as well as in war. In\r\nfact, PEACE IS A PART OF THAT PURPOSE. We went to war because\r\nwithout it there could be no assurance of a lasting peace. While\r\nwe fought to defend our national purpose and our national ideals\r\nagainst a powerful foe from without, this purpose and these ideals\r\ncannot be fully achieved by the war alone. They can be finally\r\nachieved only by ourselves as we develop, day by day, our national\r\ncommunity life. To do this we must always keep in mind our great\r\nnational purpose, we must realize our dependence upon one another\r\nin achieving this purpose, and we must make our national team work\r\nas perfect as it can be made. Above all, we must realize that, in\r\npeace as in war, EVERY MAN COUNTS in our national community life.\r\nAs President Wilson said:\r\n\r\n\"THE NATION NEEDS ALL MEN, BUT IT NEEDS EACH MAN. ...\" \"THE WHOLE\r\nNATION MUST BE A TEAM, IN WHICH EACH MAN SHALL PLAY THE PART FOR\r\nWHICH HE IS BEST FITTED.\"\r\n\r\nRead and discuss President Wilson's \"Message to the American\r\nPeople,\" of April 15, 1917.\r\n\r\nWhat organizations existed in your community to secure teamwork\r\nfor war purposes?\r\n\r\nShow how boys' and girls' clubs, or the School Garden Army, made\r\ncooperation possible on a national scale. Is this true in peace\r\ntimes as well as in war time?\r\n\r\nIs there greater or less need of national teamwork today than\r\nduring the war?

A world torn by war, as our world was\r\nfrom 1914 to 1918, may not seem to give much evidence of it, and\r\nmany would at once answer \"No\" to our question. And yet such\r\nphrases as the \"brotherhood of man\" and the \"cause of humanity\"\r\nare familiar to us all. We may briefly discuss the question in\r\nthis study, because if there is such a community, we are all\r\nmembers of it, and our membership in it affects our lives as\r\nindividuals and as a nation.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE WAR DISCLOSED WITH REGARD TO A WORLD COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nThe world community is certainly very imperfectly developed, but\r\nwhile the war emphasized its imperfections, it also furnished\r\nevidence if its reality. Its existence depends upon the presence\r\nof recognized common purposes and of organized teamwork in\r\naccomplishing these purposes, as in the case of any community. The\r\nwar disclosed conflicting interests among the nations; but it\r\nunited for a common purpose a larger part of the world's\r\npopulation than had ever before acted together in a common cause.\r\nIt disclosed an interdependence among the nations and the peoples\r\nof the world that we had not thought of. And while it disclosed\r\nthe weakness of the world's organization for teamwork, it aroused\r\nus to the possibilities of such organization, made us long for it,\r\nand brought us, as many believe, a step nearer to its\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nAMERICA'S DETACHMENT FROM THE WORLD\r\n\r\nSeparated by wide oceans, from the rest of the world, our nation\r\ngrew and prospered with a sense of security from the conflicts\r\nthat from time to time disturbed the Old World. We early adopted a\r\npolicy of avoiding entanglements that might draw us into these\r\nconflicts. In his Farewell Address, Washington said:\r\n\r\nThe great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is,\r\nin extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little\r\npolitical connection as possible. ... Why, by interweaving our\r\ndestiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and\r\nposterity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest,\r\nhumor, or caprice? It is our true policy to steer clear of\r\npermanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.\r\n\r\nA few years later, President Monroe issued his famous statement,\r\nknown as the Monroe Doctrine, which, recognizing the principle\r\nthat Washington had stated, also denied the right of European\r\npowers to interfere with the free growth of the republican nations\r\nof North and South America. The United States has steadfastly held\r\nto this doctrine from that day to this.\r\n\r\nNATIONS HAVE BECOME CLOSE NEIGHBORS\r\n\r\nBut great changes have come to the world since the time of\r\nWashington. The use of steam in navigation, the submarine cable\r\nand wireless telegraphy have brought all the world into closer\r\nrelations than existed between New England and the Southern States\r\nin the early days of our national life. Our government at\r\nWashington may send messages to European capitals and receive a\r\nreply within ten minutes. The Atlantic has been crossed by\r\nairplane. The nations of the world have become very close\r\nneighbors. The murder of a prince in a little city of central\r\nEurope drew from millions of homes in America their sons to fight\r\non the soil of Europe. We entered the war because our interests\r\nwere so closely bound up with those of the world that we could not\r\nkeep out; because \"what affects mankind is inevitably our affair,\r\nas well as the affair of the nations of Europe and Asia.\"\r\n\r\nThe war did not create this interdependence; it only emphasized\r\nit. But now that we are aware of it, it will probably influence\r\nour lives to a much greater extent than before the war.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE WORLD WAS FIGHTING FOR\r\n\r\nThe nations that were associated against Germany, occupy, with\r\ntheir dependencies, two-thirds of the earth's surface and include\r\nmore than four-fifths of its population. The governments of these\r\nnations declared that they were fighting primarily, not for\r\nselfish interests such as \"ports and provinces and trade,\" but\r\n\"for the common interests of the whole family of civilized\r\nnations--for nothing less than the cause of mankind.\" [Footnote:\r\nStuart P. Sherman, American and Allied Ideals, p. 14.] Even if\r\nsome of the governments were influenced to a greater or lesser\r\nextent by selfish motives, they still recognized a common interest\r\nof the peoples of the world, a \"cause of mankind,\" and based their\r\nappeals upon it. The prime minister of England said, \"We must not\r\nallow any sense of revenge, any spirit of greed, any grasping\r\ndesire, to overcome the fundamental principles of righteousness.\"\r\nFaraway Siam declared that she entered the war \"to uphold the\r\nsanctity of international rights against nations showing a\r\ncontempt for humanity.\" And little Guatemala proclaimed that she\r\nhad \"from the first adhered to and supported the attitude of the\r\nUnited States in defense of the rights of nations, of liberty of\r\nthe seas, and of international justice.\" Our President said that\r\n\"what we demand in this war is nothing peculiar to ourselves. It\r\nis that the world be made fit and safe to live in for every peace-\r\nloving nation. ... All the peoples of the world are in effect\r\npartners in this interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe avowed purpose for which the United States entered the war,\r\nand for which \"all the peoples of the world are in effect\r\npartners,\" is the same as that for which the American\r\nRevolutionary War was fought, which was proclaimed in our\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and for which America has always\r\nstood--the equal right of all men to \"life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness,\" and to self-government. Nearly the whole\r\nworld was united against a few autocratic governments that denied\r\nthese rights.\r\n\r\nAMERICA HAS FOUGHT FOR THE FREEDOM OF OTHERS\r\n\r\nAt the time of the American Revolution the colonists had no desire\r\nto fight the English PEOPLE, but revolted against the autocratic\r\nEnglish GOVERNMENT of that time, which refused to recognize the\r\nrights of the people. The English people had many times fought for\r\nthese rights, and many of them sympathized with the American\r\ncolonists, The winning of American independence was a victory for\r\nfree government in England as well as in America, and the\r\ngovernment of England today is as democratic as our own. This\r\nunderstanding about the American Revolution throws light upon what\r\nthe President of the United States meant when he said that we\r\nfought Germany for \"the ultimate peace of the world and for the\r\nliberation of its peoples, THE GERMAN PEOPLES INCLUDED.\" Another\r\nwriter said, \"We are not fighting to put the Germans out but to\r\nget them in.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF HUMAN SYMPATHY\r\n\r\nIt has taken a long time for the peoples of the world to develop a\r\nsense of their common wants and purposes. Differences in language,\r\nin race and color, in religious beliefs and observances, in forms\r\nof government, even in such matters as dress and other habits and\r\ncustoms, have tended to obscure the common feelings of all. This\r\nlack of sympathetic understanding is suggested by Shylock, in\r\nShakespeare's Merchant of Venice:\r\n\r\nHath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,\r\nsenses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with\r\nthe same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same\r\nmeans, warmed and cooled by the same Winter and Summer, as a\r\nChristian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us,\r\ndo we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong\r\nus, shall we not revenge? if we are like you in the rest, we will\r\nresemble you in that.\r\n\r\nIncreased opportunity for travel, better means of communication,\r\nand more widespread education have greatly increased the\r\nunderstanding among peoples and nations, and have disclosed to\r\nview common purposes and ideals in spite of differences. The fact\r\nthat large numbers of people from every part of the globe have\r\ncome to the United States to live together as one nation has\r\ncontributed to the same result.\r\n\r\nGive illustrations from your own experience and reading to show\r\nthat differences in dress, language, race, and customs make\r\nsympathetic understanding difficult.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by \"America, the melting-pot\"?\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\r\n\r\nAs the peoples of the world have become better acquainted,\r\nindividuals and groups have tended to associate themselves\r\ntogether, regardless of national boundaries, for the promotion of\r\ncommon interests.\r\n\r\nOne example of this is the common movement of organized labor\r\nwhich has overstepped national boundaries.\r\n\r\nThere is an International Institute of Agriculture, with\r\nheadquarters at Rome, and representing 56 countries, the purpose\r\nof which is to promote better economic and social conditions among\r\nagricultural populations of the world. Some of its publications\r\nare published in five languages.\r\n\r\nLiterature and art bind all the world together, and science knows\r\nno national boundary lines. Christianity is one of the greatest\r\ninfluences for a \"brotherhood of man.\" Differences in religious\r\nbelief have presented most difficult barriers to overcome, but\r\nthere has been a steadily increasing tolerance of one religious\r\nfaith toward others.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of hundreds of illustrations that might be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nSERVICE OF THE RED CROSS\r\n\r\nWe have all become familiar, during the war, with the work of the\r\nRed Cross. No other organization has done more to extend the\r\nfeeling of common brotherhood in the world and the spirit of world\r\nservice. During the war a Junior Department of the Red Cross was\r\norganized, enrolling in its membership about twelve million\r\nAmerican boys and girls and organizing them for practical service\r\nto war-stricken Europe and Asia. Since the war, the Junior Red\r\nCross, whose headquarters are at Washington, D. C., has undertaken\r\nto use its organization to promote correspondence among boys and\r\ngirls of different lands, and an exchange of handiwork, pictures,\r\nand other things illustrative of their interests. The American\r\nSchool Citizenship League (405 Marlboro Street, Boston) is\r\nencouraging the same idea, and there is a Bureau of French-\r\nAmerican Education Correspondence for a similar purpose, with\r\nheadquarters at the George Peabody College for Teachers,\r\nNashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVEMENT FOR WORLD PEACE\r\n\r\nNumerous INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONGRESSES have been held, the first\r\none as early as 1843, and in the United States and other countries\r\norganizations exist for the promotion of friendly relations among\r\nthe nations, and especially for the substitution of arbitration\r\nfor war as a means of settling international disputes.\r\n\r\nAmong such organizations in the United States are the League to\r\nEnforce Peace, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the\r\nAmerican Peace and Arbitration League, the American Peace Society,\r\nthe World Peace Federation, the Church Peace Union.\r\n\r\nWhat may be gained by correspondence between the young people of\r\ndifferent lands?\r\n\r\nReport on the following (see references):\r\n\r\nThe work of the Pan-American Union.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Red Cross in war and peace.\r\n\r\nPAN-AMERICAN UNION\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful experiments in international\r\ncooperation is that of the North and South American republics. The\r\nfirst Pan-American Conference, attended by delegates from the\r\ntwenty-one American republics, was held in Washington, D.C., in\r\n1889. As a result of this Conference the Pan-American Union was\r\nestablished, with permanent headquarters in Washington. Its\r\npurpose is \"the development of commerce, friendly intercourse, and\r\ngood understanding among these countries.\"\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nTo secure anything like effective teamwork among the nations for\r\nthe common interest and to substitute arbitration for war as a\r\nmeans of settling differences, there must be some kind of\r\ninternational organization, and rules to which the governments of\r\nthe nations will agree. Civilized nations have always had their\r\nofficial means of dealing with one another through their\r\ngovernments, such as the diplomatic and consular services.\r\nAlliances have, from time immemorial, been made between nations,\r\ntreaties have been solemnly agreed to, and a body of international\r\nlaw has gradually grown up. But treaties and international law\r\nhave frequently been violated, and no international government has\r\nexisted with sufficient authority or power to force nations to\r\nobserve the law or to keep their agreements. As a result of two\r\npeace conferences held at The Hague in Holland, in 1899 and 1907,\r\nan international Court of Arbitration was established at The Hague\r\n(The Hague Tribunal), before which disputes might be brought by\r\nnations if they desired to do so. But there was no way by which a\r\nnation could be compelled to appeal to the court.\r\n\r\nNATIONALITY AND SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\nNations have a strong sense of their NATIONALITY, and are\r\nextremely jealous of their SOVEREIGNTY, which is the supreme power\r\nclaimed by every nation to form its own government and to manage\r\nits own affairs without interference by other nations. It is this\r\nthat has prevented the development of anything like a real\r\ninternational government that could control the conduct of\r\nnational governments, or that could require a nation to submit its\r\ngrievances to any judge other than itself. This has perhaps been\r\nthe chief weakness of the world community.\r\n\r\nA LEAGUE OF NATIONS\r\n\r\nMany people have long believed that the self-governing nations of\r\nthe world must sooner or later unite, in the interest of world\r\npeace, in some kind of federation or league, with a central\r\norganization to which all would agree to submit their differences.\r\nThe war made it seem even more necessary. Accordingly, the Peace\r\nConference at Versailles at the close of the war included in the\r\ntreaty of peace a Covenant (or constitution) for a League of\r\nNations. The treaty, including the Covenant, has been ratified\r\n(March, 1920) by four of the five great nations associated against\r\nGermany (France, England, Italy, and Japan; the United States\r\nbeing the exception), besides several other nations. While the\r\nPresident of the United States strongly advocated the treaty with\r\nthe Covenant, the Senate did not approve of its ratification.\r\nThose in our country who opposed the Covenant did so for a variety\r\nof reasons, but chief among them were: first, the fear that the\r\nCovenant would cause us to depart from the principles laid down by\r\nWashington and Monroe; and, second, the fear that the powers\r\nconferred upon the international government would deprive our\r\nnational government of some of its sovereign powers. The friends\r\nof the Covenant denied that either of these things would be true.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the United States should enter the League\r\n[Footnote: The Council of the new League of Nations held its first\r\nmeeting January 16, 1920, the United States, of course, not being\r\nrepresented.] we shall have to leave for the statesmen to decide;\r\nand whether or not the League will accomplish the desired ends,\r\ntime alone can prove. But two or three things may safely be said\r\nwith regard to any really effective world government.\r\n\r\nMIGHT DOES NOT MAKE RIGHT\r\n\r\nWhen people live together in communities, each person has to\r\nsacrifice something of his personal freedom in order that all may\r\nenjoy the largest possible liberty. The same is true of families\r\nin a neighborhood, of communities in a state, of the states in our\r\nnation. There is no reason why it should not be true of nations\r\nwhich are neighbors to one another. No nation has any more right\r\nto do as it pleases than a person or a family has, IF WHAT IT\r\nPLEASES TO DO IS UNJUST TO ITS NEIGHBORS. The only thing, however,\r\nthat a nation can properly be asked to give up IS BEING UNJUST TO\r\nITS NEIGHBORS. We saw in Chapter IV that government and law\r\nincrease rather than decrease the individual citizen's freedom,\r\nand that it is only the \"ill-mannered\" who feel the restrictions\r\nof a wise government. So, when we finally get a world government\r\nthat is good, it will be one that will increase the freedom of all\r\n\"good-mannered\" nations, restricting only those that are \"ill-\r\nmannered.\"\r\n\r\nWHAT \"AMERICA FIRST\" MEANS\r\n\r\nMoreover, when we finally get a league of nations that will really\r\nsecure friendly cooperation among the nations for their common\r\ninterests, it will be brought about, not by sacrificing\r\nnationality and national patriotism, but by STRENGTHENING them.\r\n\r\nWhat is required is not less loyalty to one's nationality, but\r\nmore sympathetic understanding of nationalities and national\r\nideals different from one's own, combined with a recognition of\r\nthe fundamental interests ... which unite them to each other.\r\n[Footnote: \"Thoughts on Nationalism and Internationalism,\" in\r\nHistory Teachers' Magazine, June 1918, p. 334.]\r\n\r\nThe only way to be sure of a perfect neighborhood is first to see\r\nto it that the homes of the neighborhood are strong and whole\r\nsome. No person can really be loyal to his neighborhood who is not\r\nfirst of all loyal to his home. Thoroughly efficient townships and\r\ncounties and cities are essential to a thoroughly efficient state;\r\nand no citizen is loyal to his state who is not loyal to his\r\ntownship, county, and city. The strength of our nation depends\r\nupon the strength of the states that compose it, and real national\r\npatriotism cannot well exist in the heart of a citizen who is\r\ndisloyal to his state. The first essential step toward an\r\neffective WORLD government is to see that our national government\r\nis efficient and at the same time JUST. The first and best service\r\nthat a citizen can perform for the world community is to be loyal\r\nto AMERICAN IDEALS, which are becoming the ideals of an ever-\r\nincreasing part of the world's population.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW TYPE OF PATRIOT NO LONGER CRIES, \"MY COUNTRY AGAINST THE\r\nWORLD,\" BUT \"MY COUNTRY FOR THE WORLD.\" [Footnote: Stuart P.\r\nSherman, American and Allied Ideals, p. 14.]\r\n\r\nTopics for investigation:\r\n\r\nThe Hague Tribunal.

In many respects it is also the\r\nmost important. The quotation with which this chapter opens\r\nsuggests this. It will appear at many points in our study.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think that the quotation at the head of the chapter\r\nmeans? In what respects do you think it true?\r\n\r\nSome cities take pride in the fact that they are \"cities of\r\nhomes.\" What does this mean? Why is it a cause for pride?\r\n\r\nIs your community (neighborhood or town) a community of homes?\r\nWhat is a \"home\"? When a person is \"homesick\" for what is he\r\n\"sick\"?\r\n\r\nMay a good home exist in a poor dwelling? A poor home in a fine\r\ndwelling?\r\n\r\nIs a hotel a home? May a family living in a hotel have a home\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nIs an orphan asylum a home? Would you exchange life in your own\r\nhome for life in an orphan asylum? Why? There are children who\r\nthink an orphan asylum is a fine place to live; why is this?\r\n\r\nThe home is important (1) because of what it does for its own\r\nmembers, and (2) because of what it does for the larger community\r\nof which it is a part. We shall consider first what it does for\r\nits own members.\r\n\r\nTHE PIONEER FAMILY\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions of pioneer life the wants of the members of\r\nthe family were provided for almost entirely by their own united\r\nefforts. They built their own dwelling from materials which they\r\nthemselves procured from the forest. They made their living from\r\nthe land which they occupied, with tools which were largely\r\nhomemade. They provided their own defense against attack from\r\nwithout and against sickness within. Such education as the\r\nchildren obtained was of the most practical kind, and was obtained\r\nby actual experience in their daily work supplemented by such\r\ninstruction as parents and older brothers and sisters could give.\r\nThere was little social life except within the family circle.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF COMMUNITY GROWTH\r\n\r\nWhen other homes were built in the neighborhood a larger community\r\nlife began. The neighboring homes came to depend upon one another\r\nand to cooperate in many ways. The store at the crossroads\r\nprovided for many wants that each home had formerly provided for\r\nitself. The doctor who came to live in the community relieved the\r\nhome of much anxiety in case of sickness. The education of the\r\nchildren was in part, at least, turned over to the community\r\nschool. And so, as a community grows, the home shifts much of the\r\nresponsibility for providing for the wants of its members upon\r\ncommunity agencies.\r\n\r\nDEPENDENCE OF THE CITY HOME\r\n\r\nThis shifting of responsibility for the welfare of citizens from\r\nthe home to the larger community is carried furthest in cities.\r\nAlmost everything wanted in the home may be bought in the city\r\nshops, and work that is done in the home for the family, such as\r\nrepair work, dressmaking, laundry work, and cooking, is likely to\r\nbe done by people brought in from outside. Water is piped in from\r\na public water supply and sewage is piped out through public\r\nsewers. Gas and electricity for lighting and heating are furnished\r\nby city plants. Since many city homes have not a spot of ground\r\nfor a garden or for outdoor play, they depend upon public parks\r\nand playgrounds provided by the city. These are among the many so-\r\ncalled advantages of city life.\r\n\r\nTHE OBLIGATION OF THE HOME\r\n\r\nWhen so much is done for the citizen by the larger community\r\nagencies, there is danger that the family may forget its own\r\nresponsibility for the welfare of its members in connection with\r\nevery want of life. For no matter how good the community's\r\narrangements for health protection may be, the health of every\r\ncitizen depends more upon the home than upon any other agency (see\r\nChapter XX). No matter how good the schools, the home always has\r\ngreat responsibility for the education of the children, both\r\nwithin the home itself and through cooperation with the schools\r\n(Chapter XIX). No matter how many social organizations and places\r\nof amusement the community may afford, the social and recreational\r\nlife of the home is the most important of all and the most far-\r\nreaching in its influence (Chapter XXI). No matter how excellent\r\nthe form of government in a community may be, its results will be\r\nvery imperfect unless the government in each home is good.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE HOME IN RURAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nThe home has especial importance in the rural community of to-day.\r\nThe rural home is no longer so isolated and self-dependent as the\r\npioneer home, but the life of the rural citizen is much more\r\ndependent upon efforts within the home itself than the life of the\r\ncity resident. The business of farming by which the family living\r\nis secured is carried on at home, and, as a rule, all the members\r\nof the family have some part in it. It is a cooperative family\r\nenterprise to a much greater extent than any other modern\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn cities, in the great majority of cases, the work by which the\r\nfamily living is earned is done away from home, and very often no\r\nmember of the family except the father has any direct part in it.\r\nThere are numerous cases, however, where the mother and even the\r\nchildren go out to work, and in such cases the home life may be\r\nseriously interfered with.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to find a rural home in the United States to-day\r\nthat is not near enough to a schoolhouse to enable the children to\r\nattend it, at least for an elementary education. Unfortunately,\r\nhigh schools are not yet easily accessible in all rural\r\ncommunities (see Chapter XIX). But whether the education afforded\r\nby the rural school is of the best or not, the boy or girl on the\r\nfarm gets in addition a kind of education through the varied\r\noccupations of the farm life that the city boy or girl does not\r\nget, and for which the city schools have tried in vain to find an\r\nadequate substitute. It is remarkable how many of the successful\r\nmen and women of our country were raised on farms; and they almost\r\nalways bear witness to the value of the training received there.\r\n\r\nSo in matters of health, of social life and recreation, of\r\npleasant and beautiful surroundings, the rural home must depend\r\nvery largely upon itself. The strength and happiness of the\r\ncommunity, of our nation itself, depend largely upon the extent to\r\nwhich the homes perform their proper work in providing for the\r\nwants of their members.\r\n\r\nReview what was said in Chapter II regarding the independence of\r\nthe pioneer family.\r\n\r\nReview also what was said in Chapter I regarding the growing\r\ndependence of the family upon the community.\r\n\r\nGather stories regarding pioneer home life (a) in your own\r\nlocality, (b) in the settlement of the West; (c) in colonial\r\ntimes. Illustrate from these stories how the home provided for the\r\nwants of its members.\r\n\r\nShow in detail how the various members of a farmer's family take\r\npart in the business of farming. Compare with a family in town\r\nwhose living is provided for by some other business.\r\n\r\nMake a list of the different people who come to the home of a\r\nfamily in town to provide for its wants (such as the grocer's boy,\r\nthe milkman, the postman, etc.). Compare with a farmer's home with\r\nrespect to this service from outside.\r\n\r\nLABOR SAVING IN THE HOME\r\n\r\nWe have read in an earlier chapter that \"our national purpose is\r\nto transmute days of dreary work into happier lives--for ourselves\r\nfirst and for all others in their time.\" This purpose cannot be\r\nfully achieved if it is not first of all achieved in the home. One\r\nof the objections often raised to life on the farm is that it is a\r\nlife of drudgery, of few conveniences and comforts, of long hours,\r\nhard work, and little recreation. Happily this is not so true as\r\nit once was. Labor-saving machinery, better methods of\r\ntransportation and communication, better schools, have done much\r\nto improve conditions of rural home life. But occasionally there\r\nstill come statements like the following from some of the women in\r\nfarm homes:\r\n\r\nIn many homes life on the farm is a somewhat one-sided affair.\r\nMany times the spare money above living expenses is expended on\r\ncostly machinery and farm implements to make the farmer's work\r\nlighter; on more land where there is already a sufficiency; on\r\nexpensive horses and cattle and new out-buildings; while little or\r\nnothing is done for home improvement and no provision made for the\r\ncomfort and convenience of the women of the family.\r\n\r\nIf a silo will help to reduce the man's labor, a vacuum cleaner\r\nwill do likewise for his wife. If the stock at the barn needs a\r\ngood water system to help it grow, the stock in the house needs it\r\ntoo, and needs it warm for baths.\r\n\r\nYou see many a farm where there is a cement floor in the barn,\r\nwhile the cellar in the house is awful. A sheep dip, but no\r\nbathtub; a fine buggy and a poor baby carriage. On many farms a\r\nhundred dollars in cash are not spent in the home in a year.\r\n\r\nEQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HOME\r\n\r\nThese are not meant as complaints about the purchase of labor-\r\nsaving farm machinery. Such complaints would be short-sighted, for\r\nit is only by improved methods of farming that the means and the\r\nleisure can be found to enrich the home life in every way. But the\r\nadvantages gained by improvements that increase the farmer's\r\nreturns are largely lost if they do not at the same time bring\r\n\"happier lives\" to the family as a whole. The farm home is not\r\nonly the place where the family living is EARNED; it is also the\r\nplace where the family life is LIVED. Democracy aims at EQUAL\r\nopportunity to enjoy \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness\"; \"days of dreary work\" must be transmuted into \"happier\r\nlives\" for the women and children as well as for the men. Unless\r\nthis is done in the home there is little chance of its being done\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nA story is told of a housekeeper in a farm-home in the West who\r\nsaw in the sacred rite of old-school housekeepers something more\r\nthan scrubbing and polishing ... When her housecleaning was over\r\nshe knew just what linen she would need during the coming year,\r\njust how much fruits and vegetables she would need to can or\r\npreserve or dry, just what clothing must be replaced or repaired,\r\nand what dishes would be needed to keep her set complete. She not\r\nonly made changes to improve the appearance of her house, but\r\nplanned and made the changes in her workshop which would save\r\nsteps and make her work as easy as possible. When her mind got to\r\nwork, housekeeping became a game, the object being to eliminate\r\nall unnecessary labor. Her benches and tables and sinks were\r\nraised to the proper height and she became ashamed of the back-\r\nbreaking energy she had wasted bending over them. A high stool,\r\nmade by removing the back and arms from the baby's outgrown high\r\nchair, made dishwashing and ironing much easier. She has been\r\nhousekeeping intelligently a dozen years, yet each house-cleaning\r\nor stock-taking period she installs some new labor saver.\r\n\r\nShe not only makes her head save her heels, but she takes another\r\nkind of inventory which is as well worth while. It is the\r\ninventory which we all need to take of ourselves to be sure that\r\nwe are making the best of our opportunities instead of drifting\r\nalong day by day in a rut. She searches out the hidden places in\r\nher soul to see if she is just as patient, as thoughtful, as\r\ncheerful as she might be ... [Footnote: RECLAMATION RECORD, Feb.,\r\n1918, p.55, \"Project Women and Their Materials,\" by Mrs. Louella\r\nLittlepage.]\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY COOPERATION AND THE HOME\r\n\r\nIn some rural communities the home has been relieved of much of\r\nthe household drudgery by the development of cooperative\r\ncreameries, cooperative laundries, and other community\r\ninstitutions to do work that was formerly done entirely in the\r\nhome. In such cooperative enterprises, citizens of the community\r\nbuy shares of stock as in the case of the fruit growers'\r\nassociation. In one community in Michigan \"a vote was taken, the\r\nwomen voting as well as the men, to determine the sentiment of the\r\ncommunity on the establishment of such a laundry, and the vote was\r\nso overwhelmingly in favor of the proposition that the Farmers'\r\nClub promptly called a meeting to promote the enterprise.\" An\r\naddition was built to the cooperative creamery, which the\r\ncommunity already possessed, so that the same steam plant could be\r\nused for both. The farmers brought their laundry when they brought\r\ntheir cream, and carried it back on the next trip. \"The laundry\r\nhas been successful in relieving the hard life of a farmer's wife,\r\nand in addition has been not only self-sustaining but a profitable\r\ninstitution.\" One of the women of the community says,\r\n\r\nIt has lightened the work in the home to such an extent that one\r\ncan manage the work without keeping help, which is very scarce and\r\nhigh priced, when it would be impossible to do so if the washing\r\nwas included with our other duties.\r\n\r\nAnd another writes,\r\n\r\nThis change gives me two days of recreation that I can call my own\r\nevery week and also gives me more time in which to accomplish the\r\nhousehold duties. [Footnote: \"A Successful Rural Cooperative\r\nLaundry,\" in the Year Book, Department of Agriculture, 1915, pp.\r\n189-194.]\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT SERVES THE HOME\r\n\r\nA great deal of help is now being given to the home by the\r\ngovernment, and this is especially true in the case of the rural\r\nhome. The public schools, both in city and country, now consider\r\nhome making and \"home economics\" as worthy of a place in the\r\ncourse of study as geography and mathematics (see Chapter XIX).\r\nState agricultural colleges are beginning to give as much\r\nattention to these subjects as they do to soils and fertilizers\r\nand stock-breeding. Moreover, the colleges conduct \"extension\r\ncourses,\" sending teachers trained in the art of home making to\r\ngive instruction to women and girls in every part of the state.\r\nThey assist in organizing clubs of girls and women to study\r\nvarious aspects of home making and housekeeping, and give\r\ndemonstrations of the most successful methods of cooking, of\r\ncanning, and of other activities connected with home life on the\r\nfarm, as well as of labor-saving devices in the household. The\r\nstate agricultural colleges have the cooperation of the Department\r\nof Agriculture of the national government in all this work.\r\n\r\nWHAT ONE GIRL ACCOMPLISHED\r\n\r\nIn the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture for 1916 there\r\nis an account of results derived from home demonstration work in\r\nthe Southern States. The following story of what Ruth Anderson\r\naccomplished is a good illustration of the possibilities of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nRuth Anderson, of Etowah County, Alabama, in her second year of\r\nclub work, had an excellent plot of one tenth of an acre of beans\r\nand tomatoes. She is the second girl in a family of eleven, and\r\ntakes a great interest in her club work. The family home was\r\nsmall, dark, and crowded, and somewhat unattractive. One day a\r\ncarpenter friend of her father saw her one tenth of an acre and\r\nsaid he wished he had time to plant a garden. She told him she\r\nwould furnish vegetables in exchange for some of his time. ...\r\nAfter a while a bargain was made by which the carpenter agreed to\r\nbegin work on the remodeling of the house if Ruth would furnish\r\nhim with fresh and canned vegetables for the season.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the family were soon interested in this\r\nundertaking and worked willingly to contribute their share to its\r\nsuccess. When the house was partly finished Ruth won a canning-\r\nclub prize given by a hardware merchant in Gadsden, the county\r\nseat. Silverware was offered her, but, intent upon completing the\r\nnew house she asked the merchant how much a front door of glass\r\nwould cost, and learned that she could get the door, side lights,\r\nand windows for the price of the silverware. In this way Ruth\r\nbrought light and joy to her family with her windows and door. To-\r\nday they live in a pretty bungalow that she helped to build with\r\nher gardening and canning work. At the age of 14, in the second\r\nyear of her work, Ruth put up 700 cans of tomatoes and 750 cans of\r\nbeans. [Footnote: \"Effect of Home Demonstration Work in the\r\nSouth,\" in 1916 Year Book of the Department of Agriculture, p.\r\n254.]\r\n\r\nRuth's home before and after she began her work is shown in the\r\naccompanying illustrations.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL AID TO THE HOME\r\n\r\nThe national government helps in home making in other ways than\r\nthose suggested above, and through other departments than that of\r\nagriculture. In the Department of the Interior the General Land\r\nOffice, the Bureau of Education, the Reclamation Service, the\r\nOffice of Indian Affairs are all doing work to improve the homes\r\nof the land. So, also, is the Public Health Service of the\r\nTreasury Department; the Bureau of Standards in the Department of\r\nCommerce; the Children's Bureau in the Department of Labor. We\r\nshall encounter some of this work as we proceed with our study.\r\n\r\nIn what ways has household work been relieved of its drudgery\r\nsince your mothers were girls?\r\n\r\nWhat labor-saving devices have been introduced in your home?\r\n\r\nMake a report on labor-saving inventions for the household (see\r\nreferences at end of chapter).\r\n\r\nWhat are some labor-saving household devices that could be made by\r\nboys and girls (such as fireless cookers, iceless refrigerators,\r\netc.)? (See references below). Can your school help in such\r\nprojects? To what extent could (or do) boys' and girls' clubs\r\nundertake such projects? Is there any leader in your community who\r\ncould direct or advise in such projects?\r\n\r\nIs the kitchen in your home properly arranged to save steps,\r\nlabor, and time in doing kitchen work?

The home can do more to produce\r\nthem than any other community agency. Therefore the nation is wise\r\nto look after its homes.\r\n\r\nRELATION OF HOME CONDITIONS TO INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nPeople cannot do their work well if they live in unwholesome or\r\nunpleasant homes. This was made clear during the recent war. The\r\nlack of suitable living places for workmen and their families was\r\none of the chief obstacles to shipbuilding and munitions\r\nmanufacture during the early part of the war. England found this\r\nout as well as the United States, and one of the first things both\r\ncountries had to do was to take measures to provide proper home\r\nconditions for those who were engaged in supplying the nation's\r\nneeds. During the first year of the war our Congress appropriated\r\n$200,000,000 to build houses for industrial workers.\r\n\r\nThe problem of securing good physical conditions of home life has\r\nnaturally been greatest in crowded industrial centers, but it is\r\nby no means absent in small communities, or even in the open\r\ncountry. One writer describes a certain farmhouse where five\r\npeople were accustomed to sleep in one not very large bedroom,\r\nwhich had only one small window, and even that was nailed shut,\r\none of these five had incipient tuberculosis. These people were\r\nwell-to-do farmers, living in a large twelve-room, stone house and\r\nsimply crowded into one room for the sake of mistaken economy--\r\npresumably to save coal and wood.\r\n\r\nMany such cases could be described, not only in the more remote\r\nand backward regions, but even in prosperous farming communities.\r\n\r\nWhat is the result of this overcrowding and lack of proper housing\r\nin the country? Just exactly the same as in the great cities--lack\r\nof efficiency, disease, and premature death to many ... While the\r\ngreat majority of people subjected to overcrowding and bad housing\r\nconditions do not prematurely die, yet they have a lessened\r\nphysical and mental vigor, are less able to do properly their\r\ndaily work, and not only become a loss to themselves and their\r\nfamilies, but to the state ... [Footnote: Bashore, \"Overcrowding\r\nand defective housing in the rural districts,\" quoted in Nourse,\r\nAGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, pp. 118, 119, 121.]\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH OF THE NATION DEPENDS ON THE HOME\r\n\r\nSome of our states and many of our cities have laws to regulate\r\nhousing conditions, but such laws seldom apply to small\r\ncommunities. In cities where people live crowded together in\r\nclosely built city blocks, unsanitary conditions in one home\r\nendanger the health of the entire community. There is also danger\r\nfrom fire, and vice and crime may breed and spread quickly and\r\nunseen. The community is driven, therefore, in its own defense, to\r\nregulate the people's housing. In small communities, and\r\nespecially in rural communities, where homes are more widely\r\nseparated and in some cases quite isolated, it has seemed of\r\nlittle concern to others how one citizen builds his home and what\r\nhe does in it. Thoughtful consideration of such cases as that\r\ndescribed above, however, must convince us that it IS a matter of\r\nnational concern what happens even in remote homes. Both the\r\nphysical and the economic strength of the nation are undermined by\r\nunwholesome conditions in the separate homes of the land.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY PLANNING\r\n\r\nEconomic loss to the community may result not merely from\r\nUNWHOLESOME home conditions, but also from INCONVENIENCE of\r\nlocation and arrangement of the homes. A good deal of attention is\r\nbeing given to \"community planning\" in the United States and\r\nespecially in England and other European countries. Community\r\nplanning includes not only provision for the proper location and\r\nconstruction of public buildings and streets, for water supply,\r\nlights, parks, etc., but also for the convenient, as well as\r\nwholesome and pleasant location of homes. Large cities, like\r\nLondon, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, have spent enormous\r\nsums of money in city planning after they have already grown up\r\nwithout plan. It has necessitated destroying old structures and\r\nwidening streets. Villages and small towns are in a position to\r\nintroduce a plan for future growth without this needless expense.\r\nOur beautiful capital city of Washington has grown according to a\r\nplan that was carefully laid out before a building was erected.\r\nBut even in Washington one of the greatest problems the city had\r\nto face during the war was that of providing homes for the\r\nenormous number of workers who came to the city to do the work of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nPLANNING THE FARMSTEAD\r\n\r\n\"The need of careful arrangement in country homes is much more\r\nurgent than in city homes for the reason that country people use\r\ntheir homes as the business center of their profession,\" says\r\nProf. R.J. Pearce, of Iowa State College. \"The farmer in his\r\nbusiness center must not only produce enough raw material to\r\nprovide for him self and family, but he needs to produce enough to\r\nfeed and clothe the entire human race.\" \"CONSERVATION OF SPACE\r\nmust be taken into consideration to obtain the greatest results\r\nfrom our high-priced land; CONVENIENCE must be a prime factor when\r\nexpensive labor is at a premium; and ATTRACTIVENESS must be one of\r\nthe chief motives not only to make farm property more saleable but\r\nto give greater enjoyment to the owner and his family...\" \"A\r\nfarmstead is, but a unit in a farming community, yet travelers\r\nform an impression of the entire community by individual farm\r\nhomes which they see in passing. Therefore, not only financial\r\nconsideration but personal pride and a feeling of community spirit\r\nand enterprise should urge the farm owner to develop his farmstead\r\naccording to the best of modern methods.\"\r\n\r\nWhat facts can you find in regard to what the government did to\r\nprovide homes for workers in shipbuilding or munitions plants\r\nduring the war?\r\n\r\nIn many of the war industries preference was given to men with\r\nfamilies in employing workmen. Why was this?\r\n\r\nIn some rural communities in the United States a \"teacherage\"\r\n(home for the teacher) is provided. Of what advantage to the\r\ncommunity is this?\r\n\r\nIs there a \"housing problem\" in your community?\r\n\r\nAre there any laws in your state regulating the building of homes?\r\nIf so, what are some of them? Do they apply in your community? Are\r\nthey carefully observed and enforced?\r\n\r\nMake a study of the arrangement of the buildings on farms with\r\nwhich you are familiar, drawing diagrams, and report whether or\r\nnot they are well planned with reference to ECONOMY OF SPACE\r\noccupied, CONVENIENCE, and ATTRACTIVENESS. Consider\r\n\r\n(a) Are they properly placed with reference to the highway?\r\n\r\n(b) Are they conveniently placed in relation to one another?\r\n\r\n(c) Are they suitably protected from the prevailing winds? How?\r\n\r\n(d) What makes them attractive or unattractive?\r\n\r\n(e) Are the stables properly situated to protect the health of the\r\nfamily? How?\r\n\r\nMust a home be large and costly to be attractive?\r\n\r\nWhat impression would a stranger get in regard to the \"community\r\nspirit\" of your community from the appearance of its homes? Would\r\nhe be right?\r\n\r\nTHE HOME AND COMMUNITY STABILITY\r\n\r\nHome ownership is one of the strongest influences that give\r\npermanence and stability to the community. The census taken by the\r\nUnited States government every ten years shows that home ownership\r\nhas been decreasing throughout the country as a whole. The\r\ndecrease has been greatest in cities, but it is true also of\r\nfarmhome ownership. In 1880 only 25% of the farms of the United\r\nStates were occupied by tenants (renters); in 1910, 37% were so\r\noccupied. It is true that in the ten years from 1900 to 1910 there\r\nwas a slight increase in the proportion of farms owned by their\r\noccupants in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, and in a\r\nlarge part of the West; but the increase in these parts was more\r\nthan overbalanced by the decrease in the South Atlantic and Gulf\r\nstates and in the Mississippi Valley. The smallest proportion of\r\nfarm tenancy is found in New England (8%), and the largest in the\r\nsouthern states (45.9% in the South Atlantic states, and more than\r\n50% in the South central states). A large part of the farming in\r\nthe South is done by negroes, most of whom are either laborers on\r\nthe farms of the white population or tenants on small farms which\r\nthey usually work on shares. And yet the number of negro farm\r\nowners in the South has been rapidly increasing in the last few\r\nyears, though not so rapidly as the number of tenants. In 1910\r\nnegro farm owners cultivated nearly 16,000,000 acres of land in\r\nthe South, all of which they have acquired since the Civil War.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF DECLINE OF HOME OWNERSHIP\r\n\r\nThe decline in home ownership both in the cities and in the rural\r\ndistricts of the United States has been observed with considerable\r\nanxiety because of the effect upon our national welfare and upon\r\nthe citizenship of the country. One writer says:\r\n\r\nFarming is a permanent business; it is no \"fly by night\"\r\noccupation. ... No man can pull up stakes and leave a farm at the\r\nclose of the year without sacrificing the results of labor which\r\nhe has done ... The renter who ends harvest knowing that he will\r\nmove in the spring, will not do as good a job of hauling manure\r\nand fall plowing as he would were he to stay; nor does he take as\r\ngood care of the buildings and other improvements ...\r\n\r\nThe cost to the farming business of the country each year for this\r\nannual farm moving-week mounts into the millions of dollars. And\r\nthe pity of it all is that practically no one is the winner\r\nthereby ... The renter loses, the landlord loses, the general\r\ncommunity and the nation at large lose. [Footnote: W.D. Boyce, in\r\nan editorial in THE FARMING BUSINESS, February 26, 1916, quoted in\r\nNourse, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, p. 651.]\r\n\r\nTenant farming also places obstacles in the way of community\r\nprogress in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe tenant takes little interest in community affairs. The\r\nquestions of schools, churches, or roads are of little moment to\r\nhim. He does not wish to invest in enterprises which will of\r\nnecessity be left wholly ... to his successor. In short, he is in\r\nthe community, but hardly of it. [Footnote: B.H. Hibbard, \"Farm\r\nTenancy in the United States,\" in Annals of the American Academy\r\nof Political and Social Science, March, 1912, p. 39.]\r\n\r\nA family that owns its home feels a sense of proprietorship in a\r\npart of the community land. The money value of a home increases in\r\nproportion to the prosperity of the community as a whole; its\r\nowner will therefore be inclined to do all he can to promote the\r\nwelfare of the community. A community that is made up largely of\r\nhomes owned by their occupants is likely to be more prosperous and\r\nmore progressive, and its citizens more loyal to it, than a\r\ncommunity whose families are tenants.\r\n\r\nTHE TENANT AS A CITIZEN\r\n\r\nWhile all that has been said in the preceding paragraph is true,\r\nit must not be thought that tenancy is necessarily a bad thing in\r\nall cases, nor that a man who does not own his home cannot be a\r\nthoroughly good citizen. There are circumstances that make it\r\nnecessary for many families to live in dwellings that they do not\r\nown. Tenancy may be a step toward home ownership. A citizen may\r\nhave insufficient money to buy a farm, but enough to enable him to\r\nrent one. By industry, economy, and intelligence, he may soon\r\naccumulate means with which to buy the farm he occupies or some\r\nother. The increase in the number of tenants in the Southern\r\nStates is due in large part to the breaking up of many larger\r\nplantations into small farms which are occupied by tenants, many\r\nof them negroes. That many of these tenants are on the road to\r\nhome ownership is indicated by the facts stated on page 117.\r\n\r\nIt is as much the duty of the home renter as it is of the home\r\nowner to take an interest in the community life in which he and\r\nhis family share, and to cooperate with his neighbors for the\r\ncommon good. While he lives in the community he is largely\r\ndependent upon it, like any other citizen, for the satisfaction of\r\nhis wants. Its markets and its roads are his for the\r\ntransportation and disposal of his produce and stock. He gets the\r\nbenefit of its schools for the education of his children. He may\r\nshare in its social life if he cares to do so. His property is\r\nprotected by the same agencies that protect that of his neighbors.\r\nHe cannot, therefore, escape the responsibility of contributing to\r\nthe progress of his community to the extent of his ability.\r\n\r\nTEAMWORK BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT\r\n\r\nIt is as much the duty of the man who rents a farm as it is of the\r\nman who owns one to make his farm produce to its full capacity, to\r\nprotect the soil from exhaustion and the buildings and fences from\r\ndestruction. But on the other hand, it is the duty of the\r\nlandlord, both as a good business man and as a good citizen, to\r\nmake such terms with his tenant that the latter will take an\r\ninterest in the farm and will find it profitable to farm properly.\r\nThere must be team work.\r\n\r\nThe landlord must be interested not only in his land but in his\r\ntenant. The tenant must be interested not only in himself but in\r\nhis landlord and his land. A system that favors the tenant to the\r\ninjury of the land is bad. A system that favors the land to the\r\ninjury of the tenant is equally harmful. Either system will result\r\nin the poverty of both the landlord and the tenant. [Footnote: Dr.\r\nSeaman A. Knapp, quoted by Dr. Thomas Jesse Jones in \"Negroes and\r\nthe Census of 1910,\" p 16. (Reprint from THE SOUTHERN WORKMAN for\r\nAugust, 1912.)]\r\n\r\nThe fact remains, however, that home ownership contributes to the\r\npermanence, the stability, and the progress of a community. It is\r\nalso a fact that conditions have developed in our country, both in\r\ncities and in rural communities, which make home ownership\r\nincreasingly difficult. In another chapter (Chapter XIV) we shall\r\nsee what some of these conditions are, and what our government has\r\ndone and may do to overcome them.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME A SCHOOL OF CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nOne of the most important services performed for the community by\r\nthe home is that of training its members for citizenship. The\r\nfamily has been called \"a school of all the virtues\" that go to\r\nmake good citizenship. It is a school in which not only the\r\nchildren, but also the parents, not only the boys and men, but\r\nalso the girls and women, receive training by practice. In the\r\nhome are developed thoughtfulness for others, a spirit of self-\r\nsacrifice for the common good, loyalty to the group of which the\r\nindividual is a member, respect for the opinions of others of long\r\nexperience, a spirit of teamwork, obedience to rules which exist\r\nfor the welfare of all. If these and other qualities of good\r\ncitizenship are not cultivated in the home, it is not in a healthy\r\ncondition nor performing its proper service to the community.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the exercise of these virtues in the home is not only\r\ntraining for good citizenship; it IS good citizenship. If the home\r\nis as important a factor in our national life as this chapter has\r\nindicated, then one of the greatest opportunities for good\r\ncitizenship, and one of the greatest duties of good citizenship,\r\nis that of making the home what it should be; and in this each\r\nmember of the family has his or her share.\r\n\r\nMake a study of farm tenancy in your locality (neighborhood,\r\ntownship, or county).\r\n\r\nHow many of the farms of the locality are occupied and operated by\r\ntheir owners? how many by tenants? What is the percentage of\r\ntenancy?\r\n\r\nTo what extent are the tenants men who were formerly farm\r\nlaborers, but who by renting farms are making a start on their own\r\naccount? Is this a sign of progress?\r\n\r\nWhat percentage of the tenants are white? negro?\r\n\r\nTo what extent are the tenants foreigners who have recently come\r\nto the locality?\r\n\r\nAre the tenant farms usually rented for long periods or for short\r\nperiods?\r\n\r\nWhat is the system of tenancy in your locality (i.e. cash rental,\r\nworking on shares, partnership with the owner, etc.)? If more than\r\none exists, which seems to work best? Why?\r\n\r\nIs tenancy increasing or decreasing in your locality? What reasons\r\nare given for this?\r\n\r\nDoes experience in your locality support the statement that tenant\r\nfarmers are less likely than others to interest themselves in\r\ncommunity progress?\r\n\r\nIf you live or go to school in town, make a study of home\r\nownership in the town. (If a small community, the class may study\r\nthe entire area; if large, different sections may be studied by\r\ndifferent groups of pupils.) How many homes are occupied by their\r\nowners? how many by tenants? What is the percentage of tenancy? Is\r\ntenancy increasing or decreasing? For what reasons?\r\n\r\nIs there some section of the community where most of the people\r\nown their homes, and another section where most of the people\r\nrent? If so, do you notice any difference in the general\r\nappearance of the two sections? Do you think that the difference,\r\nif any exists, is due in any part to the fact that some own and\r\nothers rent their homes?\r\n\r\nIs there a tendency for the farmers of your locality to move into\r\ntown? If so, why? What becomes of their farms?\r\n\r\nReview the points made in the discussion of topics 4 and 5 on page\r\n38 (Chapter III). Continue to develop plans for cooperation in the\r\nhome and school.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be \"in training\" for athletics? In the light\r\nof your answer to this question, what would it mean to be \"in\r\ntraining\" for citizen ship?\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nSee Readings for Chapter IX.

[Footnote: The activities by which we\r\nearn a living are also the activities by which wealth is produced.\r\nIt is important to understand that when we speak of \"wealth\" we do\r\nnot necessarily mean GREAT wealth. A boy who has a fifty-cent\r\nknife, or a girl who has a twenty-five-cent purse, has wealth as\r\ntruly as the man who owns a well-stocked farm. The difference is\r\nmerely in kind and amount. Food, clothing, houses, books, tools,\r\ncattle, are all forms of wealth. ANY material thing, for which we\r\nare willing to work and make sacrifices because it satisfies our\r\nwants, is wealth. Earning a living is merely earning or producing\r\nwealth to satisfy our wants and those of others.] Indeed, some\r\npeople become so absorbed in the business of earning a living that\r\nthey seem to be LIVING TO EARN rather than EARNING TO LIVE. It\r\ndoes not do to forget that not EARNING, but LIVING, is the real\r\nend in view. Unless we know how to use what we earn to provide\r\nproperly for all of our normal wants, the effort we spend in\r\nearning is very largely wasted.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, before we can enjoy a living it has to be earned, by\r\nourselves or by someone else; and the activities by which it is\r\nearned occupy so important a place in our lives, are so closely\r\ndependent upon the community, have so much to do with our\r\ncitizenship, and receive so much attention from government, that\r\nwe must give them some consideration in this chapter and several\r\nchapters following.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF VOCATIONAL LIFE\r\n\r\nWhile young people are spending most of their time at school or at\r\nplay, their fathers and other grown people are usually chiefly\r\noccupied in the business of making a living or \"earning money.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Gold and silver and paper and wood are forms of wealth.\r\nOut of wood we make a yardstick or a peck measure with which TO\r\nMEASURE QUANTITIES of cloth or grain. In a similar manner, out of\r\ngold, silver, paper, and other materials, we make money, and for a\r\nsimilar reason, viz. to MEASURE THE VALUE of wealth. When we speak\r\nof a FIFTY-CENT KNIFE and a TWENTY-FIVE CENT PURSE, we measure the\r\nvalue of these articles. It would take thousands of DOLLARS to\r\nmeasure the value of a well-stocked farm.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that a boy earns a dollar, or that a man earns $4.00 a\r\nday, we measure the value of his work or his service. If a man\r\nworks for a farmer, he very likely receives his \"board and\r\nlodging\" in part payment for his services; he makes a direct\r\nexchange of his services for food and shelter. But he also\r\nprobably receives in addition an amount of money, because with the\r\nmoney he can buy clothes and other things that the farmer cannot\r\ngive. He takes the money and buys with it these other things that\r\nhe needs to supply his wants. Thus money becomes something more\r\nthan a measure of wealth or of services; it is also A MEANS OF\r\nEXCHANGING WEALTH OR SERVICES.\r\n\r\nThese are the two uses of money. Money has value only because of\r\nwhat it represents in wealth, and wealth is useful because it\r\nenables us to satisfy wants. These things are mentioned because it\r\nis quite important that we should never forget that \"money\" and\r\n\"wealth\" are worth working for only because of the \"living,\" or\r\nlife, that they help us to attain.]\r\n\r\nChildren are, as a rule, wholly dependent upon their parents for\r\ntheir living. But during their period of dependence they are\r\ngaining skill and experience, in school and otherwise, that will\r\nlater enable them to earn their own living and that of other\r\npeople who may, in turn, become dependent upon them.\r\n\r\nAs adult life approaches, there comes an increasing desire for\r\nindependence of others, to have possessions, own property, or\r\naccumulate wealth. Our VOCATIONS, or occupations, by which we earn\r\na livelihood, come to occupy a prominent place in our thought, and\r\nto a large extent control our activity. Doubtless most of those\r\nwho read this chapter have begun to think more or less seriously\r\nabout what they are going to do for a living. Some may be already\r\ndoing so, in part, or helping to earn that of their families. Boys\r\nand girls who live on farms are especially likely to have a share\r\nin the work by which the family living is provided; but most boys\r\nand girls have more or less regularly \"earned money,\" even if they\r\nhave not considered it necessary for their living. An inquiry in a\r\nlarge, first-year high school class disclosed the fact that the\r\ngirls of the class, quite as much as the boys, were thinking of\r\ntheir choice of vocation. More avenues are open to girls to-day\r\nthan formerly by which to earn their living outside of the family;\r\nbut even the management of a home is a business as truly as the\r\nmanagement of a farm or factory, and is an exceedingly important\r\nfactor in the earning of the family living.\r\n\r\nWhat part, if any, do you have in helping to earn the family\r\nliving?\r\n\r\nWhat have you done during the past year to earn money (a) out of\r\nschool hours on school days, (b) on Saturdays, (c) in vacation\r\ntime? Tabulate the results for the entire class.\r\n\r\nWhat vocation would you like to follow for life? Why?\r\n\r\nIf you have not decided upon some one vocation, name several that\r\nseem attractive to you. Why are they attractive?\r\n\r\nWhat do you know about the opportunities and the qualifications\r\nnecessary for success in the vocations you have named? How may you\r\nproceed to find out more about them?\r\n\r\nWhat vocations offer special opportunities for girls and women to-\r\nday? How do these opportunities compare with those when your\r\nmothers were girls?\r\n\r\nMake a list of the occupations of the fathers (or other members of\r\nthe families) of the members of your class.\r\n\r\nMake a list of as many occupations in your community (town or\r\ncounty) as you can think of.\r\n\r\nDEPENDENCE OF THE PIONEER\r\n\r\nOur dependence upon others for a living by no means ends with\r\nchildhood. There is no such thing as an entirely \"self-made man,\"\r\nby which is meant a man who has been successful entirely by his\r\nown efforts. It is true that the primitive hunter and the pioneer\r\nfarmer were independent of others to an unusual extent. But their\r\nliving was a meager one, and they could not accumulate much\r\nwealth. The very land that a pioneer occupies, even though it is\r\nextensive and fertile, has little value as long as it is remote\r\nfrom centers of population.\r\n\r\nEven if a pioneer laid claim to a large tract of land, he could\r\nproduce little wealth from it in crops if he could get no help to\r\ncultivate it, or if he had no improved machinery (made by others);\r\nand whatever he produced, he and his family could eat but little\r\nof the product. He could feed some to his few animals, and he\r\nwould save some for seed; but anything that he raised above what\r\nhe could actually use would have no value unless he could get it\r\nto other people who wanted it. If he could not sell what he\r\nproduced, neither could he buy from others what they produced to\r\nsatisfy other wants than that for food. So the kind of living a\r\nperson enjoys, and the amount of wealth he accumulates, depend\r\nlargely upon other people, and upon the community in which he\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nDEPENDENCE OF THE MODERN FARMER\r\n\r\nUnder present-day conditions, a farmer who raises wheat probably\r\nuses none of it himself. He sells his entire crop for the use of\r\nothers, while to supply himself and his family with bread he goes\r\nto the store and buys flour that may have been milled in Minnesota\r\nfrom wheat raised by other farmers, perhaps in North Dakota or\r\nSouth Dakota. In exchange for his wheat he also gets clothing\r\nmanufactured in New York or New England from cotton raised in\r\nGeorgia or Texas, or from wool grown in Montana. He buys a wagon\r\nmade in Indiana from lumber cut in the South and iron mined in\r\nMichigan and smelted in Ohio. Thus he earns his living by\r\nproducing food for other people, while the things he uses in\r\nliving are the product of labor expended by other people in the\r\neffort to earn THEIR living. We noticed in Chapter II how many\r\npeople and occupations were concerned in producing a pair of\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nEARNING BY SERVICE\r\n\r\nWhile the farmer or other worker may be interested primarily in\r\nproviding for his own wants and those of his family, he can do\r\nthis only by producing something or performing service for others;\r\nand while each worker may be most concerned about WHAT HE RECEIVES\r\nfor his work, the community is most concerned about WHAT HE\r\nPRODUCES. Earning a living has two sides to it: rendering service\r\nto others and being paid for the service rendered. It is as if the\r\ncommunity entered into a sort of agreement with the worker to the\r\neffect that it will provide him with a living in return for\r\ndefinite service to the community or for the product of his labor.\r\nWhat we call \"business\" is SELLING A SERVICE. It may be personal\r\nservice, such as teaching, or prescribing medicine, or nursing, or\r\ngiving legal advice, or cutting hair, or driving a team, or\r\nrunning an automobile. Or it may be purchasing, storing,\r\nretailing, and delivering things which have been produced perhaps\r\nmany hundreds or thousands of miles away. Or it may be raising\r\nfoodstuffs on the farm, or mining fuels and metals from the earth,\r\nor cutting timber from the forest. Or it may be manufacturing--\r\nbuying materials and converting them into products serviceable to\r\nothers. Whatever it is, every man's business is also the\r\ncommunity's business, and the community has a right to expect\r\nindustry and honest, efficient work from every worker.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the occupations named in answer to the two questions on\r\npage 26, from the point of view of their service to the community.\r\n\r\nTo what extent is your father's business or occupation dependent\r\nupon the business or occupation of the fathers of other members of\r\nthe class?\r\n\r\nShow how your father's business is also the community's business.\r\n\r\nWhat is the price of land in your neighborhood? Consult your\r\nfather or friends in regard to the increase or decrease in price\r\nin recent years and in regard to the reasons for it.\r\n\r\nLIVING WITHOUT EARNING\r\n\r\nThere are exceptional cases where people RECEIVE a living without\r\nEARNING it. One class of such people is represented by thieves,\r\ngamblers, swindlers, and persons engaged in occupations that are\r\npositively harmful to the community. Such people may be very\r\nskillful and they may work hard enough, but they take what others\r\nhave earned without producing anything of value to the community.\r\n\r\nThen there are those who are incapable of productive work because\r\nof physical defects, or through the feebleness of old age. It is\r\nthe duty of every citizen to provide, as far as possible, during\r\nhis productive years, for the \"rainy day\" of misfortune or\r\nadvancing age. For those who cannot do so, the community must\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\nVery young children are users of wealth produced by others. It is\r\nexpected, however, that children will in later years make return\r\nto the community for what they have received during their period\r\nof dependence.\r\n\r\nINHERITED WEALTH\r\n\r\nSome people inherit wealth, or otherwise come into possession of\r\nit without effort on their part. The wealth so received, however,\r\nhas been earned by someone, or has come from the community in some\r\nway. If the person who so receives it uses it in a way that is\r\nhighly useful to the community, he may in a sense earn it even\r\nafter he receives it; but if he uses it solely for his own\r\nenjoyment, without effort to make it highly useful to the\r\ncommunity, he does not in any sense earn it, and places himself in\r\nthe class of those who are wholly dependent upon the community.\r\n\r\nUNFAIR COMPENSATION FOR SERVICE\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are people who do not get for their work\r\na living that fairly compensates them for the service they render\r\nby it to the community. If our community life were perfectly\r\nadjusted in all its parts; if all the people clearly recognized\r\ntheir common interests and their interdependence; if they had the\r\nspirit of cooperation and were wise enough to devise smoothly\r\nworking machinery of cooperation;--then the returns that a worker\r\nreceived for his work would be closely proportionate to the\r\nservice rendered by his work. That is, he would GET what he\r\nEARNED, so far as wages or profits were concerned. But this is one\r\nof the particulars in which our community life is still imperfect.\r\nWhere so many different kinds of workers are engaged in producing\r\nshoes, for example, it is extremely difficult to determine how\r\nmuch each should be paid for his share of the work. What WAGES\r\nshould be given to the different classes of workers who care for\r\ncattle, make the leather, manufacture the machines with which the\r\nshoes are made, operate the machines, mine the coal and iron for\r\nthe production of the machines, and so on? What PROFITS shall be\r\nallowed to the men who raise the cattle, to the merchants who sell\r\nthe shoes and the machines, and to the transportation companies\r\nthat carry them from the factories to the dealers? What INTEREST\r\nshall be received by the men who furnish the CAPITAL necessary to\r\nrun the factories and the farms? These questions relating to the\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH that men produce have proved very difficult\r\nto answer satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nA very useful and interesting, but rather difficult, science has\r\ngrown up to explain the PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND USE OF\r\nWEALTH. It is called the SCIENCE OF ECONOMICS. Of all the\r\ndivisions of this science, that relating to the distribution of\r\nwealth is the most perplexing. It is the inequalities in the\r\ndistribution of wealth, the sense of injustice produced by these\r\ninequalities, and sometimes a failure to understand what a fair\r\ndistribution is, that have caused all the labor disputes referred\r\nto in Chapter VII (p. 71), and the discontent sometimes felt by\r\nfarmers and other producers in regard to the prices of their\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard any one say, \"The world owes me a living\"? Is\r\nthis a true statement? If so, in what sense do you think it is\r\ntrue?\r\n\r\nWhich do you think is the truer statement: \"I have a right to a\r\nliving,\" or \"I have a right to earn a living\"? Discuss the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nA thief has been known to say, \"I was brought into the world\r\nwithout my own consent; therefore the world owes me a living, and\r\nI owe the world nothing.\" Is this good argument? Did the people\r\nupon whom he depends for a living have any more to say about their\r\nbeing brought into the world than he had?\r\n\r\nWhat things are you using to-day that were not provided for you by\r\nothers?\r\n\r\nIf a stranger should come to your community to-day to live, what\r\nare some of the things that he would find already provided by the\r\ncommunity for his use in making a living?\r\n\r\nName five important inventions and state what they have done for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWould you say that the world owes Thomas A. Edison and Luther\r\nBurbank a living? Why?\r\n\r\nHow are you indebted for your living to the pioneers who settled\r\nyour state? to Robert Fulton? to the men who built the first\r\ntranscontinental railroad?\r\n\r\nCan you think of some way in which your family is indebted for its\r\nliving to the British nation? to France? to ancient Greece? to the\r\nPhoenicians? to the people of Brazil?\r\n\r\nWhich is the greater, the debt of your family to the world or the\r\ndebt of the world to your family?\r\n\r\nWhat is a \"parasite\"? Could this term be appropriately applied to\r\nany of the people referred to in the last few paragraphs of the\r\ntext above?\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT INTERESTED IN PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nEach citizen has a right to feel that the government is interested\r\nin his individual prosperity and happiness; and it is, for unhappy\r\nand discontented citizens are seldom good citizens. But the\r\ngovernment represents community as a whole, and has the interest\r\nof the community as a whole in its keeping rather than the\r\ninterest of particular individuals. Its interest is primarily in\r\nwhat each citizen PRODUCES, for it is upon this that the strength.\r\nof the nation depends.\r\n\r\nTHE \"NATIONAL SERVICE ARMY\" OF PRODUCERS\r\n\r\nA few days after war was declared against Germany, the President\r\nmade an appeal to his fellow producers countrymen, in which he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\nIt is evident to every thinking man that our industries on the\r\nfarms, in the shipyards, in the mines, in the factories, must be\r\nmade more prolific and more efficient than ever and that they must\r\nbe more economically managed and better adapted to the particular\r\nrequirements of our task than they have been; and what I want to\r\nsay is that the men and women who devote their thought and their\r\nenergy to these things will be serving the country and conducting\r\nthe fight for peace and freedom just as truly and just as\r\neffectively as the men on the battlefield or in the trenches. The\r\nindustrial forces of the country, men and women alike, will be a\r\ngreat national, a great international Service Army,--a notable and\r\nhonored host engaged in the service of the nation and the world ...\r\nThousands, nay, hundreds of thousands, of men otherwise liable\r\nto military service will of right and necessity be excused from\r\nthat service and assigned to the fundamental, sustaining work of\r\nthe fields and factories and mines, and they will be as much part\r\nof the great patriotic forces of the nation as the men under fire.\r\n\r\nHe then appealed directly to every kind of worker in the country,\r\nand to the farmers he said:\r\n\r\nThe supreme need of our own nation and of the nations with which\r\nwe are cooperating is an abundance of supplies, and especially of\r\nfoodstuffs. ... Without abundant food ... the whole great\r\nenterprise upon which we have embarked will break down and fail ...\r\nUpon the farmers of this country, therefore, in large measure,\r\nrests the fate of the war and the fate of nations. Let me suggest,\r\nalso, that every one who creates or cultivates a garden helps, and\r\nhelps greatly, to solve the problem of the feeding of the nations;\r\nand that every housewife who practices strict economy puts herself\r\nin the ranks of those who serve the nation.\r\n\r\nThe nation needs the productive work of each citizen in time of\r\npeace as truly as in time of war, although when it is not fighting\r\nfor its very life it is more tolerant of those who do not\r\ncontribute efficiently by their work to the common good. It\r\ncarries them along somehow. But such members of the community are\r\na burden and a source of weakness at all times. Therefore, for\r\nexample, there are in most of our communities laws against\r\nvagrancy; that is, against willful and habitual idlers \"without\r\nvisible means of support,\" such as beggars and tramps.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM OF THE UNEMPLOYED\r\n\r\nThere are times when many men are \"out of work.\" In times of\r\nbusiness depression the number may become very great, while in\r\nprosperous times the number dwindles; but always there are some.\r\nIt is often through no fault of their own; it is another result of\r\nthe imperfect adjustment of our community life. It often happens\r\nthat while large numbers of men are unable to find work in\r\nindustrial centers, the farmers may be suffering for want of help.\r\nThis may be merely because there is no way by which to let workmen\r\nknow where they are needed, or of distributing them to meet the\r\nneed. Or, many of the unemployed may be unskilled, while the\r\ndemand is for skilled workmen; or they may be skilled in one line,\r\nwhile the demand is in another line. Whatever the causes, the\r\n\"problem of the unemployed\" is one of the most serious that the\r\ncommunity has to deal with. During the war the national government\r\nsought to overcome these difficulties by the organization of an\r\nemployment service in the Department of Labor, and state and local\r\ncommunities established employment bureaus.\r\n\r\nWho have been some of the builders of your own community by reason\r\nof their business life? Explain.\r\n\r\nSo far as you have observed, what boys have been most successful\r\nafter leaving school--those who make it a practice to do all they\r\ncan for their employers, or those who have tried to do the least\r\npossible?\r\n\r\nIs it true in your community that the most useful citizens are\r\nthose who care more about the excellence of their work than about\r\nwhat they receive for it?\r\n\r\nAre there many vagrants in your community? Are there laws against\r\nvagrancy? If so, what are they?\r\n\r\nAre there often many men out of work in your community? If so, why\r\nis it?\r\n\r\nIs it ever difficult to get farm labor in your locality? If so,\r\nhow do the farmers explain it?\r\n\r\nWhat experience have the farmers of your locality had during and\r\nsince the war in getting labor when it was needed? Did the\r\ngovernment help them at that time? How?\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance both to the individual and to the\r\ncommunity that every citizen: (1) should be continuously employed\r\nin a useful occupation, (2) should be free and able to choose the\r\noccupation for which he is best fitted, and in which he will be\r\nhappiest, and (3) should be thoroughly efficient in his work,\r\nwhatever it is.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT OF THE COMMUNITY TO INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n(1) The community has a right to expect every citizen to be\r\nindustrious and productive, for only in this way can he be self-\r\nsustaining and at the same time contribute his share to the well-\r\nbeing of the community. Doubtless all who read this chapter are\r\ndesirous of doing useful work. At the same time, it is easy for\r\nany of us to fall into the habit of thinking more about what we\r\ncan GET than about what we can GIVE. There ARE people who\r\nhabitually seek to do as little as possible for what they receive,\r\nor to get all they can for the least possible service. This\r\napplies not only to idlers who live entirely off the community\r\nwithout any service on their part, but also to those who have\r\nemployment, but who seek to evade, by \"time-serving\" and otherwise\r\n\"slacking,\" the full responsibility of service. We sometimes hear\r\ncomplaint in regard to public officials who draw good salaries\r\nwithout rendering adequate or honest public service in return, and\r\nto such we frequently apply the term of \"grafter.\" But the\r\nprinciple is exactly the same when any person who has undertaken\r\nto do a piece of work fritters away his time or \"loafs on the\r\njob.\"\r\n\r\nSATISFACTION IN SERVICE\r\n\r\nAfter all, the chief return that we get for our work is not the\r\nwages or the profits, important as they are to us, but the\r\nsatisfaction of doing something that is worthwhile. If this\r\npleasure is absent from the work we do, no amount of money returns\r\ncan compensate us for it. The happy man is a busy man, an\r\nindustrious man; and his happiness is more in the doing than in\r\nthe mere fact of money returns.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF A RIGHT CHOICE\r\n\r\n(2) The value of our work to the community and the pleasure that\r\nwe derive from it both depend to a large extent upon our fitness\r\nfor it. It is important to choose our work carefully. There are\r\nfour important considerations in choosing a vocation: (a) its\r\nusefulness to the community, (b) one's own fitness for it, (c)\r\none's happiness in it, and (d) whether it offers an adequate\r\nliving to one's self and dependents. The last of these is, of\r\ncourse, a most important consideration. What a person receives for\r\nhis work ought to be determined by the first two considerations,\r\ni.e. the usefulness of the work to the community and one's fitness\r\nfor it. We have seen that this is not always true. In such cases\r\nit often becomes necessary to make a further choice--a choice\r\nbetween working primarily for one's own profit and working\r\nprimarily for the satisfaction that comes from important service\r\nwell rendered. It is not always easy to make this choice; but\r\nthere are many people who have sacrificed large incomes for the\r\nsake of doing work that the community needs and for which they\r\nconsider themselves well fitted.\r\n\r\nA CHOICE OF VOCATION IS INEVITABLE\r\n\r\nMany people seem to have little choice in the matter of vocation.\r\nThe farmer's boy has to work on the farm whether he wants to or\r\nnot; and many a man is a farmer apparently for no other reason\r\nthan that he was raised on the farm and has seen no opportunity to\r\ndo anything else. Other people seem to be forced into other\r\noccupations by circumstances or drift into them by chance. But\r\neven in these cases there is something of a choice. The farmer's\r\nboy \"chooses\" to remain on the farm rather than to take the\r\nchances involved in running away, or because he would rather be at\r\nhome than in a strange city. The discontented farmer might have\r\nchosen to be a lawyer if he had been willing to make enough\r\nsacrifices to get ready for it; and even now he \"chooses\" to\r\nremain on the farm in spite of his dislike for it because to do\r\notherwise would mean sacrifice of some kind or other that he is\r\nunwilling to make.\r\n\r\nTHE MEANING OF OUR WORK TO THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nThe pleasure and effectiveness of ANY work, however, are increased\r\nif its importance to the community or to the world is clearly\r\nunderstood; for ALL productive work is important. There is no more\r\nterrible work than that of the soldier in the trenches. No man\r\nwould voluntarily choose it for his own pleasure. But millions of\r\nmen have gone into it joyfully because of the results to be\r\nattained for their country and the world. Other millions of men\r\nand women, and even children, on the farms, in the mines, in the\r\nshops, and in the homes, worked and sacrificed during the war with\r\nGermany as they had never worked and sacrificed before, produced\r\nresults such as had never been produced before, and doubtless\r\nexperienced a satisfaction in their toil that they had never\r\nexperienced before, because each one saw more definitely than\r\nbefore the relation of his work to the great national and world\r\npurpose. An understanding of the meaning of our work in its\r\nrelation to community welfare goes a long way toward \"transmuting\r\ndays of dreary work into happier lives.\"\r\n\r\nFREEDOM, EQUALITY AND JUSTICE\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to choose one's calling, to decide what service\r\none will fit himself for, the right of \"self-determination\" with\r\nregard to what one's work shall be--this is what \"freedom\" means.\r\nThis is why men are happier when they are free. The \"equality\" and\r\n\"justice\" that all men want mean EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE\r\nthat which they like to do, and AN EQUAL CHANCE TO MAKE A LIVING,\r\nor to obtain compensation for their labor or enterprise. It is for\r\nthese things more than for anything else that people have left\r\nold-world conditions and come to America. The ability to make a\r\nliving under conditions of freedom and justice depends in part\r\nupon the common wants of the community, and upon the willingness\r\nof members of the community to pay for the satisfaction of their\r\nwants enough to enable those who perform service for them also to\r\nsatisfy theirs. But it also depends upon the ability of the\r\nindividual to make a choice, and upon his willingness to spend\r\nyears in preparation, if need be, to enable him to offer a service\r\nof the kind he likes to render, and for which others are glad to\r\npay well.\r\n\r\nA DAY OF SPECIALISTS\r\n\r\nWe are living in a day of specialists. The very nature of our\r\ninterdependent life makes it necessary for each worker to do one\r\nthing and to do it exceedingly well. Even farming is broken up to\r\na considerable extent into special kinds of farming. Moreover,\r\nsince the worker must be a specialist, requiring long, special\r\ntraining, it is more difficult than it used to be for him to\r\nchange from one occupation to another after he has once started.\r\nEach person, therefore, owes it both to himself and to the\r\ncommunity to choose his vocation carefully, so far as he has\r\nopportunity to make a choice. The schools are more and more making\r\nit their business to give boys and girls the knowledge and the\r\nexperience that will enable them to choose wisely their mode of\r\nearning a living.\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY FOR TRAINING\r\n\r\n(3) Whether a citizen follows a vocation of his own voluntary\r\nchoice, or one into which he has fallen by chance or by force of\r\ncircumstances, he is under obligation to the community as well as\r\nto himself to do his work well. In these days of specialization\r\nthis inevitably means preparation, training. If the community\r\nexpects the citizen to perform efficient service, it must afford\r\nhim a fair opportunity for preparation. During the war the\r\ngovernment made special provision for training, not only for\r\nmilitary service, but also for the industrial occupations that the\r\nnation needed. Vocational training is now receiving great\r\nattention from the schools and from government.\r\n\r\nHASTY ENTRANCE UPON VOCATIONAL LIFE\r\n\r\nAs in the choice of a vocation, so in preparation for it the\r\nindividual has his share of responsibility. It is always a\r\ntemptation for young people to get out into the active work of the\r\nworld at the earliest possible moment. The desire to be\r\nindependent, to earn one's own living, to \"make money,\" is strong.\r\nIt leads many boys and girls to leave school even before they have\r\nfinished their elementary education. In the great majority of\r\ncases this results in serious economic loss both to the boy or\r\ngirl and to the community. The charts on page 137 furnish evidence\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nPATRIOTISM IN VOCATIONAL LIFE\r\n\r\nWe call it patriotism when a man gives all that he has, even his\r\nlife if necessary, for the good of his country, without stopping\r\nto consider whether or not he will receive an equal benefit in\r\nreturn. There is no higher type of patriotism than that which\r\nprompts a citizen to perform his best service for the community in\r\nhis daily calling, not for what he can get for it, but for what he\r\ncan give. This patriotism is shared by the young citizen who is\r\nwilling to defer an apparent immediate gain to himself in order to\r\nprepare himself thoroughly for more effective service later.\r\n\r\nIf your father had his life to live over again, would he choose\r\nthe same vocation that he is now following? Consult him as to his\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nWhat special kinds of farming exist in your locality? Is there a\r\ntendency in your community toward specialization in farming, or\r\ntoward general farming? Reasons?\r\n\r\nTo what extent is \"scientific farming\" practiced in your locality?\r\nWhat does it mean?\r\n\r\nMake a study of the extent to which specialization is necessary in\r\nthe industries of your town.\r\n\r\nDoes your school offer any vocational training or vocational\r\nguidance?\r\n\r\nIs there a tendency in your school for boys and girls to quit\r\nbefore completing the course? At what grades do pupils begin to\r\ndrop out in considerable numbers? Why do they leave? What sort of\r\nwork do they do when they leave school?\r\n\r\nAt what ages does the law in your state permit boys and girls to\r\ngo to work? Show how this restriction of freedom now increases\r\nfreedom later on.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nIn Lessons in Community and National Life:\r\n\r\nSeries A:  Lesson 3, The cooperation of specialists in modern society.\r\n           Lesson 5, The human resources of a community.\r\n           Lesson 7, Organization.\r\n           Lesson 8, The rise of machine industry.\r\n           Lesson 9, Social control.\r\n           Lesson 10, Indirect costs.\r\n           Lesson 11, Education as encouraged by industry.\r\n           Lesson 23, The services of money.\r\n           Lesson 28, The worker in our society.\r\n\r\nSeries B:  Lesson 8, Finding a job.\r\n           Lesson 11, The work of women.\r\n           Lesson 28, Women in industry.\r\n\r\nSeries C:  Lesson 9, Inventions.\r\n           Lesson 11, The effects of machinery on rural life.\r\n           Lesson 21, Before coins were made.\r\n           Lesson 22, The minting of coins.\r\n           Lesson 23, Paper money.\r\n           Lesson 24, Money in the community and the home.\r\n           Lesson 29, Child labor.\r\n\r\nIn Long's American Patriotic Prose:\r\n\r\nFrank A.

About 10 1/2 million were engaged in\r\nmanufacturing and mechanical trades, by which the materials\r\nextracted from the land are transformed into articles of use. The\r\nremainder of the \"breadwinners\" were engaged in trade and\r\ntransportation, and in professional, personal, and public service.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nOf the 13 1/2 million people gaining their living directly from\r\nthe land, more than 12 1/2 million were engaged in agricultural\r\npursuits. At the present time (1919) probably one half of the\r\npopulation, including women and children, is directly dependent\r\nupon agriculture as a means of livelihood, while the other half,\r\nas well, is dependent upon it for food supply and the materials\r\nfor clothing.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that agriculture is the source of the nation's\r\nfood supply and of a large part of the national wealth, and that\r\nso large a part of the people are engaged in it as a means of\r\nlivelihood, it is not surprising to find our government deeply\r\ninterested in it and performing a vast amount of service for its\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nSTATE DEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe government of every state in the Union has an organization to\r\nprotect and promote the farming industry and the welfare of the\r\nfarmer. This organization differs in its form and in the extent of\r\nservice performed in the several states, due partly to the varying\r\nimportance of agriculture in the different states, and partly to\r\nthe varying success with which the people and their\r\nrepresentatives have dealt with the problem. In some of the states\r\nthere are departments of agriculture, equal in dignity and power\r\nwith the other main divisions of the government. In others\r\nagricultural interests are placed in the hands of subordinate\r\nboards, bureaus, or commissions. In some cases the officials in\r\ncharge of the organization, such as the commissioner of\r\nagriculture, are elected directly by the people, while in others\r\nthey are appointed by the governor of the state or by the\r\nlegislature. Often the department is organized in numerous\r\nbranches with specialists at the head of each. Thus, there are\r\ndairy commissioners, horticultural boards, livestock sanitary\r\nboards, foresters, entomologists (specialists in insect life in\r\nits relation to agriculture), and others, to look after every\r\naspect of farming. In a constantly decreasing number of states the\r\npowers of the agricultural officers are slight and their work\r\nineffectual; but in others the organization is thorough and the\r\nwork efficiently done and of the greatest value to the state.\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF STATE DEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nIn general, state departments of agriculture have had two kinds of\r\nduties: first, regulative and administrative duties, such as the\r\nenforcement of laws relating to agriculture passed by the state\r\nlegislature, enforcing quarantine against diseased animals,\r\nestablishing standards for the grading of grain, making and\r\nenforcing rules for the control of animal and plant diseases, and\r\nsimilar matters. Second, investigative and educational duties,\r\nsuch as the investigation of animal and plant diseases, crop\r\nconditions, and other agricultural problems; and the distribution\r\nof information to the farmers and to the people of the state\r\ngenerally, relating to agricultural matters. Reports and bulletins\r\non special subjects are published and farmers' institutes are\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERIMENT STATIONS\r\n\r\nThe practice is growing, however, to transfer the work of\r\ninvestigation and education to the STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND\r\nEXPERIMENT STATIONS which have been established and are conducted\r\nwith the cooperation of the national Department of Agriculture.\r\nThese institutions have a corps of highly trained specialists and\r\neducators and are equipped with laboratories and experimental\r\nfarms where research may be carried on under the most favorable\r\nconditions. The agricultural colleges not only educate young men\r\nand women within their walls in agriculture and related subjects,\r\nbut carry on EXTENSION WORK throughout the state for the benefit\r\nof the farmers and the people of rural communities. With the\r\ndevelopment of these institutions the state department of\r\nagriculture is left with almost purely administrative and\r\nregulative duties. This seems to be the wiser plan of\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nWrite to your state commissioner of agriculture or to the\r\nsecretary of your state board of agriculture for a copy of the\r\nlaw, or other published document, containing a description of the\r\norganization of your state department of agriculture and its work.\r\nAlso ask for, if available, a list of publications issued by the\r\ndepartment, from which you may later select such as may seem to be\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nWrite to your state agricultural college, or to the experiment\r\nstation, for its latest report showing the work that it has done,\r\nand for a list of available publications.\r\n\r\nIn writing to public officials for materials for class use, it is\r\nwell to send but ONE letter for the class or school, and to\r\nrequest THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF COPIES that will serve the purposes\r\nof the class. Public officials are busy people, and the\r\npublications for which you ask cost the people of the community\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe members of the class may compete, if desired, in formulating a\r\nsuitable letter, and a class committee may select the best, or\r\nformulate one on the basis of suggestions from the class.\r\n\r\nMaterials collected in this way should become school property, and\r\nthe class should be conscious that it is accumulating a library\r\nfor later classes as well as for themselves. Study and report on\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nThe organization of your state department of agriculture, its\r\nofficers and how chosen, its divisions and their work.\r\n\r\nThe work done at your state experiment station (individual reports\r\nmay be made on the several important lines of work, or on\r\nparticular investigations or discoveries of interest).\r\n\r\nThe character of the extension courses offered by your state\r\nagricultural college. Courses given in your own community.\r\n\r\nInstances of regulative work done in your state and county by your\r\nstate department of agriculture.\r\n\r\nInstances in which your county or locality has been served by your\r\nstate agricultural college or by the experiment station.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the farmer in coping with animal disease or\r\nplant disease by his own effort.\r\n\r\nFacts to show that money has been saved to your community by the\r\nstate agricultural department or experiment station.\r\n\r\nWhy the people of the cities of your state should pay taxes to\r\nsupport the department of agriculture.\r\n\r\nFacts to show that your state department of agriculture and your\r\nexperiment station are really \"means of cooperation\" in your state\r\nand county.\r\n\r\nExtent to which the farmers of your locality actually cooperate\r\nthrough the governmental machinery of the department of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nConsult your parents or farmer friends as to ways in which the\r\nwork of your state department of agriculture, agricultural\r\ncollege, or experiment station should be extended.\r\n\r\nSentiment among the people of your locality, especially the\r\nfarmers, as to the usefulness of your department of agriculture,\r\nexperiment station and agricultural college.\r\n\r\nGet information from your county agent, or from your state\r\nagricultural college, as to the states having the best organized\r\ndepartments of agriculture, and then get information as to their\r\npoints of excellence.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of a state fair (A) to the farmer, (B) to the state.\r\nThe fair as a means of cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe management of your county fair (if any).\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE A NATIONAL ENTERPRISE\r\n\r\nIt does one state very little good to fight hog cholera or the\r\nboll weevil unless neighboring states do likewise. Inferior\r\nservice in one state by its department of agriculture is a\r\ndetriment not only to the farmers of that state, but to those of\r\nother states and of the country as a whole. States gradually learn\r\nfrom one another and frequently adopt from one another the best\r\nmethods that are developed. This is a slow process. The\r\nagriculture of our nation must be considered as a great national\r\nenterprise, and not as forty-eight separate enterprises. This was\r\nmade evident during the recent war. Hence the necessity for\r\nnational control.\r\n\r\nEARLY NATIONAL SUPPORT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nWashington and Jefferson, like other founders of our nation, took\r\nthe keenest interest in agriculture. But in the early years of our\r\nhistory little was done by the national government for its\r\npromotion, except by a rather generous policy of disposing of the\r\npublic lands (see Chapter XIV). In 1820 a committee on agriculture\r\nwas for the first time created in the House of Representatives,\r\nand in 1825 a similar committee in the Senate. In 1839 Congress\r\nmade its first appropriation for agricultural purposes, $1000, to\r\nbe spent in gathering information about crops and other\r\nagricultural matters. This was a small beginning when compared\r\nwith the $37,000,000 appropriated by Congress for agricultural\r\npurposes in 1918.\r\n\r\nCREATION OF DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture was created by\r\nCongress in 1862, though it was not placed on an equality with the\r\nother executive departments of the national government, with a\r\nmember of the President's cabinet at its head, until 1889. While\r\nit has some very important regulatory powers, that is, powers to\r\nenforce laws and otherwise to control the practice of the people,\r\nits service has been largely by way of scientific investigation of\r\nthe problems of agriculture and the distribution of the\r\ninformation so acquired. Its policy has been one of cooperation\r\nwith state authorities.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL COOPERATION WITH THE STATES\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Congress gave to the several states portions of the public\r\nlands, the proceeds from which were to be used for the\r\nestablishment and support of the agricultural colleges of which\r\nmention has been made. Again, in 1887, Congress made\r\nappropriations for the establishment of the agricultural\r\nexperiment stations, which are conducted cooperatively by the\r\nstate and national governments. In 1914 the Smith-Lever Act was\r\npassed by Congress, making appropriations for agricultural\r\nextension work to be conducted by the state agricultural colleges\r\nwith the cooperation of the Department of Agriculture. By the\r\nterms of this act each state must appropriate a sum of money for\r\nthe extension work equal to that received from the national\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nTHE STATES RELATIONS SERVICE of the Department of Agriculture\r\nsupervises and administers these cooperative relations with the\r\nstates under the terms of the Smith-Lever Act. In each state there\r\nis a director of extension work who represents both the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture and the state agricultural\r\ncollege. Under him there is usually a state agent or leader,\r\ndistrict agents, county agents, and specialists of various kinds.\r\nThe county agents conduct agricultural demonstration work in their\r\ncounties and assist in organizing rural communities for\r\ncooperation. Women county agents, or home demonstration agents,\r\nare rapidly being installed also, to conduct extension work in\r\nhome economics and organize cooperation among the women.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States during 1915 about 110,000 farmers carried\r\nout demonstration work under the supervision of county agents.\r\nEach such farm demonstration serves as an object lesson for the\r\nentire community. These demonstrations included corn raising in\r\n446,000 acres, cotton in 202,000 acres, tobacco in 2630 acres,\r\nsmall grains in 196,000 acres, and many other products in hundreds\r\nof thousands of acres. Stumps were removed from more than 70,000\r\nacres, 220,000 acres were drained, and there were 29,000\r\ndemonstrations in home gardens. Sixty-four thousand improved\r\nimplements were bought. Work was done with orchards involving more\r\nthan 2,000,000 trees, 29,000 farmers were instructed in the care\r\nof manure with an estimated saving of more than 3,000,000 tons.\r\nFarmers in 678 cooperative community organizations were advised\r\nwith regard to the purchase of fertilizers with a saving in cost\r\nof $125,000. One thousand six hundred fifty-four community\r\norganizations were formed to study local problems and to meet\r\nlocal business needs. Nearly 63,000 boys were enrolled in corn\r\nclubs.\r\n\r\nThere were also in the Southern States 368 counties with home\r\ndemonstration agents, who gave instruction to 32,613 girls and\r\n6871 women. Each of the girls produced a one tenth acre home\r\ngarden of tomatoes and other vegetables. They put up more than\r\n2,000,000 cans of fruit and vegetables worth $300,000. There were\r\nnearly 10,000 members in poultry clubs and 3000 in bread clubs.\r\nTwo hundred fifty women's community clubs were formed.\r\n\r\nSimilar work was done in the Northern States, where 209,000 boys\r\nand girls were enrolled in club work. Nearly 25,000 of these were\r\nengaged in profit-making enterprises in which they produced food\r\nworth more than $500,000. Reports from 3155 homes show 546,515\r\nquarts of fruits and vegetables canned, about half of which\r\nconsisted of vegetables, windfall apples, and other products that\r\nfrequently go to waste.\r\n\r\nHow much money does your state receive from the national treasury\r\nunder the terms of the Smith-Lever Act? (Discuss at home, consult\r\nyour county agent.)\r\n\r\nFind out from your county agent, and from your home demonstration\r\nagent (if there is one), what their work includes and how it is\r\ndone. Invite them to speak to your school on the subject.\r\n\r\nWhat demonstration work is being carried on in your county for men\r\nand women? Results achieved?\r\n\r\nWith the help of your county agent, make a map of your county\r\nshowing the distribution of his demonstration work.\r\n\r\nReport on boys' and girls' club work in your county. Describe\r\nparticularly any such work in which you are engaged.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the problems in regard to which the farmers of\r\nyour community need help?\r\n\r\nMake a report on George Washington the Farmer; on Thomas\r\nJefferson's contributions to agriculture.\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICE OF MARKETS AND RURAL ORGANIZATION promotes the\r\norganization of rural communities for cooperation in buying and\r\nselling, in obtaining rural credits and insurance (see Chapter\r\nXIII), in developing means of communication (Chapter XVIII), and\r\nin providing for social needs. It investigates markets and methods\r\nof marketing, and transportation and storage facilities.\r\n\r\nIt seeks to establish standards for grading and packing fruits,\r\nvegetables, and other products.\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICE OF FARM MANAGEMENT investigates and promotes the\r\napplication of business methods to farm management and farm\r\npractice. It studies the cost and profitableness of producing\r\nparticular crops, livestock, and dairy products, the use of the\r\nwoodlot, the most economic and effective farm equipment. It\r\ninvestigates the cost of the farmer's living, methods of keeping\r\naccounts, the methods and results of tenantry.\r\n\r\nTHE BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY investigates the causes, prevention,\r\nand treatment of diseases of domestic animals, and has done much\r\nto eradicate them. It studies methods of dairying and dairy\r\nmanufacturing, of breeding and feeding livestock, of producing\r\nwool and other animal fibers, of poultry raising. It cooperates\r\nwith the States Relations Service and the state agricultural\r\ncolleges in educational work, conducting livestock demonstration\r\nwork and advising with regard to the establishment and management\r\nof creameries and cheese factories. It promotes the organization\r\nof pig clubs to stimulate interest in swine production.\r\n\r\nTHE BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY investigates the causes, prevention,\r\nand treatment of plant diseases, including those of fruit, shade,\r\nand forest trees. It has introduced over 43,000 varieties of\r\nforeign seeds and plants, from which many new industries have\r\ngrown up amounting in value to many millions of dollars each year.\r\nIts explorers have brought new varieties of cereals from Russia\r\nand Siberia; alfalfas from Siberia; date palms from North Africa,\r\nArabia, and Persia; the pistachio nut from Greece and Sicily;\r\nvanilla and peaches from Mexico; barleys and hops from Europe;\r\nrices and matting rushes from Japan; forage grasses from India;\r\ntropical fruits from South America. It experiments in the breeding\r\nof hardy and disease-resisting grains, fruits, and vegetables,\r\nstudies soil fertility, investigates the medicinal qualities of\r\nplants, tests seeds, and improves agricultural implements. Its\r\nexperiments are conducted in experimental gardens in Washington,\r\nD.C., at Arlington, Va., and at the experiment stations\r\ndistributed widely over the United States.\r\n\r\nThis bureau does much educational work, instructing farmers how to\r\ncontrol plant diseases and how to organize for cooperation in the\r\nbreeding of disease-resisting plants, and conducting\r\ndemonstrations on reclaimed lands in arid regions. During 1916 it\r\ndistributed, through members of Congress, 356,000 tulip and\r\nnarcissus bulbs, 96,000 strawberry plants of 15 varieties, 14,000\r\npackages of lawn grass seed, and more than 16,000,000 packages of\r\nvegetable and flower seeds.\r\n\r\nTHE BUREAU OF CHEMISTRY studies the influence of environment on\r\ncrops and plants; investigates the quality of mill products, the\r\nmethods of bread making, of tanning leather, and of paper making.\r\nIt tests the food values of all kinds of products, the keeping\r\nquality of poultry, eggs, and fish in the course of\r\ntransportation, and the composition of drugs. It is called upon by\r\nother departments of government to make chemical analysis of many\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nTHE BUREAU OF SOILS investigates the quality of soils and their\r\nadaptation to different kinds of crops, and the fertilizer sources\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nTHE BUREAU OF ENTOMOLOGY is concerned with the study of insects\r\nand their relation to agriculture, including those that are\r\ndestructive to fruit, shade, and forest trees. Its work includes\r\nthe study and promotion of bee culture. It has carried on a\r\ncampaign for the eradication of such diseases as spotted fever,\r\nmalaria, and typhoid which are carried by ticks, mosquitoes,\r\nflies, and other insects (see Chapter XX).\r\n\r\nTHE BUREAU OF BIOLOGICAL SURVEY maintains game, mammal, and bird\r\nreservations, including among others the Montana National Bison\r\nRange, the winter elk refuge in Wyoming, the Sully's Hill National\r\nGame Preserve in South Dakota, and the Aleutian Islands\r\nReservation in Alaska. It studies the food habits of North\r\nAmerican birds and mammals in relation to agriculture,\r\nhorticulture, and forestry, and the habits, geographical\r\ndistribution, and migrations of animals and plants. It conducts\r\nexperiments and demonstrations in destroying animals harmful to\r\nagriculture and animal husbandry and in connection with rearing\r\nfur-bearing animals. It cooperates with local authorities in the\r\nprotection of migratory birds.\r\n\r\nTHE BUREAU OF CROP ESTIMATES gathers and publishes data regarding\r\nagriculture, and particularly estimates relating to crop and\r\nlivestock, production.\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER BUREAU is in charge of the forecasting of the weather,\r\nthe issuing of storm warnings, the display of weather and flood\r\nsignals for the benefit of commerce, agriculture, and navigation\r\n(see Chapter XVI).\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST SERVICE has in its keeping the great national forests\r\n(see Chapter XV).\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ROADS AND RURAL ENGINEERING administers the\r\nwork of the federal government for road improvement, and studies\r\nfarm engineering problems such as those relating to sanitation and\r\nwater supply (see Chapters XVII and XX).\r\n\r\nREGULATORY POWERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has certain important powers of\r\nregulation and control. Animals are inspected at market centers to\r\ndiscover the presence of disease, and localities infected are\r\nquarantined.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 more than 15 million sheep were inspected and nearly 4\r\nmillion dipped to cure scabies. As a result nearly one and one\r\nhalf million square miles of land were released from quarantine.\r\nIn the same year more than a million square miles were released\r\nfrom quarantine against scabies in cattle.\r\n\r\nIn quarantining a state, or portion of a state, the Department\r\nacts by authority of laws passed by Congress under its power to\r\nregulate interstate and foreign commerce (Constitution, Art. I,\r\nSec. 8, cl. 3). By the same authority, all cattle for export and\r\nall imported from foreign countries are inspected and those\r\ndiseased excluded. Slaughter houses and meat-packing\r\nestablishments where meat is packed for interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce are inspected; meat that is unfit for use being\r\ncondemned, while that which is good has the government stamp\r\nplaced upon it. Such measures are primarily health measures (see\r\nChapter XX), but they have great economic value.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner imported seeds, plants, and plant products are\r\ninspected to prevent the importation of plant diseases and plant\r\npests, and also to prevent adulteration of plant products.\r\nWarehouses are inspected and licenses granted to those that are\r\nsuitable for the proper storage of cotton, grains, tobacco,\r\nflaxseed, and wool. The Department enforces the laws that fix the\r\nstandards for grading cotton and grain, and licenses grain\r\ninspectors. It also enforces the Food and Drugs Act (see Chapter\r\nXX).\r\n\r\nTopics for investigation:\r\n\r\nDifficulties experienced by farmers in your locality in marketing\r\nproduce or livestock.\r\n\r\nAssistance received from the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture to overcome the difficulties.\r\n\r\nExperiments in cooperative marketing in your locality.\r\n\r\nProducts of your locality that require storage facilities.\r\nAdequacy of storage facilities.\r\n\r\nTransportation needs of your locality. Improvements in\r\ntransportation facilities in recent years.\r\n\r\nConsult your county agent, or write to the Office of Farm\r\nManagement, for publications relating to farm management, farm\r\naccounting, etc.\r\n\r\nDiscuss with farmers of your acquaintance the extent to which they\r\nfind farm accounts and farm records useful.\r\n\r\nDiseases of livestock prevalent in your locality and state.\r\nExperiments in cooperation to eradicate these diseases. Assistance\r\nreceived from the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nCrops of foreign origin raised in your locality.

How you cooperate in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nImportance of these various farmers' problems to the people in\r\ntown--the housekeeper, the merchant, the manufacturer, the\r\nrailroad companies.\r\n\r\nCases of animal quarantine occurring in your locality.\r\n\r\nWhy warehouses for food products, cotton, etc., should be\r\nlicensed. What \"licensing\" means.\r\n\r\nHow grain, cotton, or other products are \"graded.\" The reason for\r\ngrading. Why there needs to be a law on the subject.\r\n\r\nSERVICE OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nWhile the business interests of the farmer, and indeed many of his\r\nother interests, such as health, education, and social life, are\r\nespecially looked after by the Department of Agriculture, he\r\nshares with all other citizens the services of all the other\r\ndepartments of government, each of which also has its elaborate\r\norganization (see Chapter XXVII). It is the Treasury Department,\r\nfor example, acting under authority given to it by Congress, that\r\nprovides the people with their system of money and with a banking\r\nsystem, both of which are great cooperative devices. The\r\nDepartment of Commerce serves the farmer directly by discovering\r\nmarkets for his products in every part of the world, and\r\nindirectly by everything it does to promote the country's\r\ncommerce. The rural mail delivery, the parcel post, and the motor\r\ntruck service of the Post Office Department are of untold value to\r\nthe farmer (see Chapter XVIII). The Department of the Interior has\r\nsupervision over the public lands, the reclamation of arid lands,\r\nand the development of mineral resources (Chapters XIV, XV).\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF LABOR SUPPLY\r\n\r\nThe question of labor supply is one of the most serious questions\r\nwhich the farmer has to face. It is one that he must help to solve\r\nfor himself:\r\n\r\nAs soon as work on the farms is organized, and employment is made\r\nsteady for all help, just so soon will a better class of laborers\r\nbe attracted to the farm. As the farm-owner wishes life to be free\r\nfrom eternal drudgery for himself and family, yielding the fruits\r\nof happiness, leisure, and culture, he would do well to consent\r\nand arrange to give the farm hand who shares the shelter of his\r\nroof a fair chance at the same benefits. The laborer wants regular\r\nhours, a chance for recreation, a good place to live in, and\r\nenough wages to maintain a family according to American standards.\r\n[Footnote: W.J. Dougan and M.W. Leiserson in \"Rural Social\r\nProblems,\" Fourth Annual Report Wisconsin Country Life Conference,\r\nquoted in Nourse, AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS pp. 258-260.]\r\n\r\nBut there are aspects of the labor problem over which the farmer\r\nby his own unaided efforts can have little control. One of these\r\nis the problem of bringing the laborer and the job together (see\r\nChapter XI, p. 133). The work of the Employment Service in the\r\nDepartment of Labor during the recent war affords a striking\r\nillustration of cooperation secured through an agency of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES EMPLOYMENT SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe Employment Service had been created in 1914, but was rapidly\r\ndeveloped during the war to meet the demand for farm labor to\r\nprovide a food supply adequate to war needs. The main offices of\r\nEmployment Service were with the Department of Labor in\r\nWashington. But each state had a federal director of employment,\r\nand branch offices were established in local communities. The\r\nsuccess of the whole scheme depended, first of all, upon\r\ncooperation between national, state, and local governments.\r\n\r\nThousands of county agents and local rural community organizations\r\ndiscovered and reported local needs to local employment offices,\r\nwhich in turn distributed the information by means of the\r\ndistrict, state, and national organizations. Fifty-five thousand\r\npost offices became farm-labor employment agencies, postmasters\r\nand rural carriers acting as agents. Railroads cooperated both in\r\nreporting needs for the districts through which they run and in\r\ndistributing labor to the points where needed. Newspaper offices\r\nserved as employment bureaus. The operators of nearly 8000 rural\r\ntelephone companies weekly called up the homes of two million\r\nfarmers to inquire as to needs. State and county councils of\r\ndefense, chambers of commerce, labor unions, farmers'\r\norganizations, and other volunteer agencies afforded channels\r\nthrough which the farmer and the laborer were brought together.\r\n\r\nFrom January to the end of October 1918, approximately 2,500,000\r\nworkers were directed to employment (not all farm workers). In\r\nthat year the enormous wheat crop of the western states was\r\nentirely harvested by labor forces organized and moving northward\r\nas the harvest ripened. \"Teamwork between the county agricultural\r\nagents and farm-help specialists of the Department of Agriculture\r\nand the harvest emergency force of the United States Employment\r\nService is considered largely responsible for the excellent\r\nresults.\" In a similar manner assistance was given in harvesting\r\nthe corn and cotton crops, the fruits of orchards and vineyards,\r\nand the vegetable crops of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Boys' Working Reserve constituted one division of the\r\nEmployment Service. In 1918, 210,000 boys between the ages of 16\r\nand 20 were enrolled for work on the farms during the summer. The\r\nReserve was responsible in 1917 and 1918 for saving millions of\r\ndollars worth of crops. It is estimated that in 1918 it raised\r\nenough food to feed a million soldiers for one year.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT SERVICE IN PEACE TIME\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the war emergency, the elaborate machinery of\r\nthe Employment Service was in large measure allowed to fall to\r\npieces through lack of appropriations for its maintenance. This is\r\ntrue of much of the emergency organization of government developed\r\nduring the war period. It illustrates the tendency in our country\r\nto leave business control as fully as possible to individual\r\ninitiative excepting in times of great emergency. So important is\r\nthe problem of bringing the worker and the job together that many\r\nbelieve that the Employment Service organization should be revived\r\nand continued.\r\n\r\nThe central office at Washington is still maintained. In most\r\nstates there are still (1919) state directors. The local machinery\r\nhas been largely discontinued except in cities where volunteer\r\nagencies, such as the Red Cross and other welfare organizations,\r\nhave taken over the work, chiefly to find employment for\r\ndischarged soldiers and sailors. A few states have made\r\nappropriations to continue the Boys' Working Reserve.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE\r\n\r\nOne division of the Employment Service is the Junior Section, for\r\nthe guidance of boys and girls from 16 to 21 years of age seeking\r\nemployment. Local junior sections were organized as branches of\r\nlocal employment offices and in schools. A \"junior counselor\" was\r\nplaced in charge of each local junior section to study the needs\r\nand qualifications of those who applied for employment, and to\r\ngive them advice. The Junior Section is still maintained with a\r\ndirector in the Washington office. The duties of the junior\r\ncounselor are stated as follows:\r\n\r\nTo influence boys and girls to remain in school as long as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nTo give aid toward the right start for those who have to leave\r\nschool to go to work.\r\n\r\nTo arouse the ambitions of the boys and girls to fit themselves\r\nfor definite careers.\r\n\r\nTo direct youth who are employed toward some form of trade,\r\ntechnical, or business school for special training.\r\n\r\nTo promote the opportunities for vocational education.\r\n\r\nTo follow up all applicants in their training and at their work to\r\nsee that they have the best available advantages of study and\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT ALWAYS AT OUR SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe array of facts contained in the foregoing paragraphs is given,\r\nnot with the expectation that those who read will memorize them,\r\nbut to suggest the enormous amount of work that the United States\r\ngovernment is doing in the interest of agriculture and the farmer,\r\nand the extensive machinery necessary to do it. The facts given\r\nare only a few of those that might be given. The detailed story of\r\nhow much of this work is done is fascinating, and often of\r\nthrilling interest. All around us may be seen, if our eyes are\r\nopen, the evidences of the work of our government. Always the\r\ngovernmental machinery is at hand to serve us in a thousand ways,\r\nif we are wise enough to use it. The more we study its work, the\r\nmore we shall be impressed by the fact that its greatest service\r\nis in opening the way for cooperation, and in providing the\r\norganization and the leadership for such cooperation.\r\n\r\nTopics for investigation:\r\n\r\nHow money serves as a means of cooperation.\r\n\r\nHow a bank serves as a means of cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe attractiveness of the conditions of living for farm laborers\r\nin your community. How they could be improved.\r\n\r\nThe farm labor supply in your locality and state.\r\n\r\nThe work of the United States Employment Service in your state and\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nEmployment agencies in your community at the present time. By whom\r\nconducted. Are they free, or run for profit? Advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of the two kinds.\r\n\r\nHarvesting the wheat crop in war time.\r\n\r\nThe Boys' Working Reserve in your locality. The experience of the\r\nfarmers of your locality as to its value. Possible objections\r\nraised to it. Its continuance since the war.\r\n\r\nThe Junior Section of the Employment Service.\r\n\r\nJunior counselors in your community.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nProcure from the State Department of Agriculture, the State\r\nAgricultural College, and the State Experiment Station,\r\npublications relating to their work.\r\n\r\nSend to the U. S. Department of Agriculture for its List of\r\nPublications Available for Distribution; or for publications\r\nrelating to particular topics. Among the useful publications of\r\nthe Department are:\r\n\r\nFarmers' Bulletins (covering a wide variety of subjects).\r\n\r\nStates Relations Service Circulars.\r\n\r\nThe Year Book.\r\n\r\nAnnual Reports of the Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nProgram of Work of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1917 or\r\nlater years).\r\n\r\nReport on Agricultural Experiment Stations and Cooperative\r\nAgricultural Extension Work (1915 or later years).\r\n\r\nA very useful publication is the \"Guide to United States\r\nGovernment Publications,\" published by the U.S. Bureau of\r\nEducation as Bulletin, 1918, No. 2. It not only describes the\r\npublications of each department of government, but also the\r\norganization and work of each department and its subdivisions.\r\n(Government Printing Office, 20 cents.)\r\n\r\nMore recent and equally useful is \"The Federal Executive\r\nDepartments as Sources of Information for Libraries,\" also\r\npublished by the Bureau of Education, Bulletin, 1919, No. 74\r\n(Government Printing Office, 25 cents). The work of each\r\nDepartment and its subdivisions is described in some detail.\r\n\r\nIn Lessons in Community and National Life:\r\n\r\nSeries B: Lesson 30, Employment agencies.\r\n\r\nSeries C:  Lesson 12, Patents and inventions.\r\n           Lesson 13, Market reports on fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHRIFT\r\n\r\n\"THRIFT IS GOOD MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS OF LIVING.\"\r\n\r\nNATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF THRIFT\r\n\r\n\r\nThis definition is taken from \"Ten Lessons in Thrift,\" issued by\r\nthe Treasury Department of the United States Government (February,\r\n1919). The United States Government sent out these lessons because\r\n\"America to-day stands in the position in which all her economic\r\nproblems must be solved through thrift ... Unless our people gain\r\na deep, sincere appreciation of the absolute necessity for thrift,\r\nwe cannot hope to hold the proud position we occupy as the flag\r\nbearer of nations ...\" [Footnote: S.W. Strauss, President American\r\nSociety for Thrift, in \"The Patriotism of War Savings\" (National\r\nEducation Association pamphlet, THRIFT, 1918)]\r\n\r\nLESSONS OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe great war taught us some lessons about the importance of\r\nthrift to the nation. The enormous expenses of the war were paid\r\nand the armies and the civilian populations of the countries at\r\nwar were fed very largely by the combined small savings of our\r\npeople. Nearly 20 million people contributed to the fourth liberty\r\nloan, by which almost seven billion dollars were raised, an\r\naverage of about $350 for each contributor. Almost every one\r\nbought war savings stamps, by which about a billion dollars were\r\nraised in 1918. Practically all this money came from savings.\r\nEnormous sums were also given to the Red Cross and other causes.\r\nTo do this people saved and sacrificed \"until it hurt.\" The\r\nprovisioning of our armies and of the needy peoples of Europe was\r\nmade possible by the saving, in American homes, of slices of\r\nbread, of teaspoonfuls of sugar, of small portions of meat and\r\nfats.\r\n\r\nTHRIFT AS PATRIOTISM\r\n\r\nThrift, however, is not merely a war necessity. \"The time when\r\nthrift shall not be needed--needed as vitally as food itself--will\r\nnever come ... Through thrift alone can the rebuilding come--the\r\nrebuilding of America--the rebuilding of the world ... Thrift is\r\npatriot ism because it is the elimination of every element that\r\ntends to retard...\" [Footnote: S W Strauss, \"The Patriotism of War\r\nSavings\"]\r\n\r\nThrift is necessary both for individual success and for good\r\ncitizenship. It is only by thrift that the individual may in some\r\nmeasure repay others for the care he himself received during\r\ndependent childhood, and provide, during his productive years, for\r\nthe \"rainy day\" of sickness and old age. It is by thrift that\r\nCAPITAL is accumulated with which to carry on the world's work.\r\nThe citizen who saves and invests his savings in a home, in\r\nbusiness enterprises, in bonds or savings stamps, not only makes\r\nhis own future secure, but becomes identified with the community\r\nand takes a greater interest in it. The thrifty citizen inspires\r\nthe confidence of the community, and acquires an influence in\r\ncommunity affairs that the unthrifty citizen does not enjoy.\r\nFinnish farmers in a certain section of New England are said to be\r\nable to obtain credit from neighboring bankers and businessmen\r\nmore easily than many of their neighbors, and to be considered as\r\nespecially desirable citizens, because of their reputation for\r\nthrift and honesty. Thrift is often confused with stinginess and\r\nselfish ness. On the contrary it alone makes generosity and\r\nservice possible.\r\n\r\nTHRIFT, \"THE ESSENCE OF DEMOCRACY\"\r\n\r\n\"Thrift is the very essence of democracy.\" For democracy means\r\nfreedom, equality of opportunity, \"self-determination.\" No man is\r\na greater slave than one who is bound and driven by financial\r\nnecessity. By thrift the mind is \"unfettered by the petty\r\nannoyances that result from improvident ways.\" Thrift means\r\nproviding for the future. There is nothing in the world that will\r\nso establish one's faith in the future and that will, therefore,\r\ngive that freedom of spirit upon which democracy depends, as the\r\nwise use of to-day and of to-day's resources.\r\n\r\nTHRIFT A RIGHT AS WELL AS A DUTY\r\n\r\n\"Every man must practice thrift and every man must have the CHANCE\r\nof practicing it.\" It is a RIGHT as well as a duty. Before the war\r\nit was said that four fifths of the wage earners of our country\r\nreceived less than $750 a year for their labor. Studies in various\r\ncities also showed that an average family of five could not\r\nmaintain health and efficiency on an income of less than from $750\r\nto $1000. Under such circumstances thrift is the strictest\r\nnecessity, but it is a thrift that means pinching economy and the\r\nsacrifice of health and efficiency. It is not the thrift that\r\nprovides for the future and gives freedom to the individual, the\r\nthrift that is \"the essence of democracy itself.\" Every man should\r\nhave an opportunity to earn a \"living wage,\" which includes an\r\nopportunity to provide for the future. Democracy is not complete\r\nuntil that opportunity is afforded.\r\n\r\nThrift, or the good management of the business of living, is shown\r\n(1) in earning, (2) in spending, (3) in saving, and (4) in\r\ninvesting.\r\n\r\nTHRIFT IN EARNING\r\n\r\n(1) Since the earning of a living was the subject of Chapter XI,\r\nwe need not dwell upon it now except to note that a thrifty person\r\nis an industrious person--he makes wise use of his time; and also\r\nto note that many of those who are now in want, or who, in\r\nadvanced years, are receiving small wages, owe their condition to\r\na failure at some time or other to make use of the opportunity for\r\nthrift. Many people do not recognize the opportunity when it is\r\npresented, or lack the wisdom or the courage to seize it. Thrift\r\ninvolves MAKING A CHOICE, and in many cases a wise choice requires\r\ncourage as well as wisdom. It is a choice between the satisfaction\r\nof present wants and the sacrifice of present enjoyment for the\r\nsake of greater satisfaction and service in the future.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy in school has a chance to take a job that will pay him\r\nwages, he has to make a choice between it and remaining in school.\r\nIt may seem to be the thrifty thing to go to work; but real thrift\r\nis shown by careful choice of vocation, and by thorough\r\npreparation for it, even though it requires sacrifices that seem\r\ndifficult (see pp. 137, 139).\r\n\r\nWe may note here, also, that physical fitness is essential if\r\nearning power, which means power to perform service, is to be\r\nfully developed. The \"conservation\" of health and life is so\r\nimportant that a chapter is devoted to it later (Chapter XX).\r\n\r\nTHRIFT IN SPENDING\r\n\r\n(2) After money has been earned, thrift shows itself first of all\r\nin the way the money is spent; and many of us have the spending of\r\nthe money that some one else has earned. Every time we spend a\r\nnickel or a dollar we make a choice--we choose to spend or not to\r\nspend, how much we shall spend, for what we shall spend.\r\n\r\nA lawyer in a small town reports that in one month he made out the\r\nnecessary papers to enable 75 men to mortgage their homes to buy\r\nautomobiles.\r\n\r\nButchers say that during the war they more often sold expensive\r\ncuts of meat to wage earners who were by no means well-to-do, but\r\nwho happened for the time to be getting good wages, than to people\r\nof larger means. One reason, perhaps, for extravagance in food and\r\nclothing on the part of unintelligent people who find themselves\r\nunusually prosperous, is that they see no better way to spend\r\ntheir money. Those who find pleasure in books, in education for\r\ntheir children, in travel, in investing money in serviceable\r\nenterprises, and in the higher things of life, have to make A\r\nCHOICE in regard to what they shall enjoy, and as a rule prefer to\r\nsacrifice the grosser pleasures.\r\n\r\nCHOOSING WHAT TO SPEND\r\n\r\nPeople, and especially young people, need a certain amount of\r\nsweets in their diet. But when we know that the candy bill of the\r\npeople of the United States amounts to $400,000,000 a year, that\r\nthis is almost as much as the total amount spent for public\r\neducation, that it is about double the amount used to keep Belgium\r\nsupplied with food for a year during the war, or that it will buy\r\n234 million bushels of corn at $1.70 a bushel, we may well think\r\ntwice before deciding to spend MUCH money for candy.\r\n\r\nTESTS FOR SPENDING\r\n\r\nThe few cents difference in the price of two articles between\r\nwhich we must choose, and the nickels we spend for immediate\r\nenjoyment, may seem to amount to very little; but the New York\r\nCity street railways collected in a year $95,000,000 in five-cent\r\nfares, and the Woolworth Building in New York, one of the largest\r\noffice buildings in the United States, was built from the profits\r\nof \"5 and 10 Cent Stores.\" One thrift stamp a week amounts in five\r\nyears to $65, and 14 cents a day at 4 per cent interest amounts in\r\ntwenty years to more than $1500. In one of the \"Ten Lesson in\r\nThrift,\" the following \"tests in buying\" are given:\r\n\r\nDo I need it?\r\n\r\nDo I need it now?\r\n\r\nDo I need something else more?\r\n\r\nWill it pay for itself in the end?\r\n\r\nDo I help or injure the community in buying this?\r\n\r\nDo you have instruction in your school in home economics that\r\nrelates to wise spending or buying?\r\n\r\nIf you do not have such instruction, apply to the home\r\ndemonstration agent in your county (if there is one), or write to\r\nyour state agricultural college, or to the States Relations\r\nService, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., for\r\ncirculars or bulletins relating to thrift in buying food,\r\nclothing, etc.\r\n\r\nIn writing for such material, why is it an example of thrift to\r\nask for ONE copy of EACH publication for your CLASS or for your\r\nSCHOOL, rather than to ask for a copy for each pupil?\r\n\r\nIn what ways is thrift shown by having a class committee write one\r\nletter making the request for the class instead of having each\r\nmember of the class write?\r\n\r\nHas any home demonstration work relating to thrift been conducted\r\nin your community? What methods were employed, and what results\r\nachieved?\r\n\r\nWho in your family makes most of the expenditures for the family\r\nliving?\r\n\r\nFor what items in the family living is most of the money spent?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the things that have to be considered in buying\r\nfood? clothing? house furnishings? books? amusements?\r\n\r\nDiscuss the topics mentioned in the following statement of \"values\r\nin buying\" (from \"Ten Lessons in Thrift\"):\r\n\r\nFood: nutrition, healthfulness, cleanliness, attractiveness,\r\nflavor, quality, price, economy in preparation (of time, strength,\r\nfuel, utensils), buying from bulk or in package, buying in\r\nquantity or small unit, buying for the day or laying in stores,\r\ncalculation of portions, calculation of meals, varied diet.\r\n\r\nClothing: design related to material, color, and becomingness;\r\nstyle, durability; adaptability to fine or rough wear, to repair\r\nand remaking; suitability to season, health, occupation, comfort;\r\nhome-made VERSUS ready-made; conditions of manufacture, use of\r\nchild labor, the sweat shop, the living wage, health.\r\n\r\nMake a study at the grocery of the relative prices of articles\r\nbought in small and large quantities: for example, laundry soap by\r\nthe bar, by the quarter's worth, by the box; canned goods by the\r\ncan, by the dozen, and by the case; flour by the pound, by the 25-\r\npound sack, 50-pound sack, by the barrel; etc.\r\n\r\nMake a study of the relative prices of articles in bulk and in\r\npackage; for example, vinegar by the bottle and by the gallon;\r\nbacon in bulk and in jars, etc.\r\n\r\nWhy may it be economy to buy some food articles in packages rather\r\nthan in bulk, even at a higher price? Give examples.\r\n\r\nWhich is likely to be more economical, to buy groceries by\r\ntelephone or in person? To buy by mail order or at the store in\r\ntown? Why?\r\n\r\nAt Christmas time the Park View community center in Washington,\r\nD.C., ordered 140 turkeys from a rural neighborhood center in\r\nMaryland. The turkeys were brought by the producers to the\r\nschoolhouse of the rural neighborhood, taken by a postal service\r\nmotor-truck to the schoolhouse of the Park View center in\r\nWashington, and from there distributed to the 140 families. The\r\ncity buyers paid an average of 15 cents a pound less than the\r\nprice prevailing in the Washington markets, and the producers\r\nreceived 6 cents a pound more than the Washington markets were\r\npaying.\r\n\r\nWhy was there a saving to both producer and consumer in the above\r\ncase? What costs of marketing were cut out or reduced?\r\n\r\nWhat is the \"middleman\"? Does he perform a real service to the\r\ncommunity? Should he be paid for his service? Why? Is it just that\r\nthe middleman should be \"eliminated\" by cooperative marketing and\r\nbuying organizations? Why?\r\n\r\nIs there any cooperative buying organization in your community? If\r\nso, how has it benefited the community? If not, why? (Consult your\r\nparents, your county agent, and others.)\r\n\r\nGet publications from your state agricultural college relating to\r\ncooperative buying and selling.\r\n\r\nTHRIFT IN MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nWise expenditures depend not only upon knowledge of prices and\r\nqualities, but also upon good management, as in planning ahead.\r\nOne plan that has been the means of lifting many individuals and\r\nfamilies out of financial difficulties and of enabling them to lay\r\nby as savings a portion of their income, however small the latter\r\nmay be, is the BUDGET, which means the apportionment of\r\nexpenditures according to a plan laid out in advance. No budget\r\ncan apply to all families alike, but the following illustrates the\r\nprinciple:\r\n\r\nHouse (rent, taxes, insurance, repairs)........................25%\r\n\r\nFood (all expenditures for the table, ice, etc.)...............30%\r\n\r\nClothing (materials and making, repairing, cleaning, pressing,\r\nmillinery, shoes)..............................................13%\r\n\r\nHousekeeping (labor and materials for laundry, fuel and light,\r\ntelephone, supplies, and furnishings)..........................12%\r\n\r\nEducational (school and school books, club dues, church and charity\r\ncontributions, gifts, books, magazines, newspapers, amusements,\r\nmedical and dental treatment)...................................6%\r\n\r\nLuxuries (all items not necessaries and not coming under\r\n\"educational,\" such as candies, etc.)...........................4%\r\n\r\nSavings........................................................10%\r\n\r\nTotal.........................................................100%\r\n\r\nBefore a budget can be planned, and in order to know whether it is\r\nbeing lived up to, it is necessary to keep accounts of receipts\r\nand expenditures. With such accounts, it is possible to determine\r\nwhere savings can be made under some heads and where, perhaps, it\r\nis necessary or advisable to spend more.\r\n\r\nIs a budget used in your home? Find out from your parents their\r\nreason for using, or not using it.\r\n\r\nCould you use a budget in your own personal affairs?\r\n\r\nFind out whether a budget system is used by your local government\r\nand your state government in apportioning expenditures.\r\n\r\nHow may we \"budget\" our time? Is the time you spend in school\r\n\"budgeted\"? Make a daily time budget for yourself.\r\n\r\nWhen is clothing a necessity and when a luxury? [Footnote: This\r\nand the following topics are adapted from \"Ten Lessons in\r\nThrift.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen is food a necessity and when an amusement?\r\n\r\nWhen is amusement education and when a frivolity?\r\n\r\nWhen is fuel an item in rent and when current housekeeping\r\nexpense?\r\n\r\nWhen are club dues education and when amusement?\r\n\r\nWhen is vacation health and when amusement?\r\n\r\nWhen is the theater amusement and when indulgence?\r\n\r\nWhen is rent a necessity and when an extravagance?\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From \"Suggestion for Home Demonstration Agents\r\nregarding Methods of Teaching Thrift,\" States Relations Service\r\nCircular, Dec. 27, 1918.]\r\n\r\nTHRIFT IN SAVING\r\n\r\n(3) The object of thrift in spending is both to get the greatest\r\nvalue for our money now and to insure savings that will provide\r\nfor the future. Every budget should make as definite provision for\r\nsavings as for rent or clothing. The purpose of a budget and of\r\naccounts is to assure a surplus rather than a deficit. Successful\r\nmen and women make it a practice always to spend less than they\r\nearn, no matter how little they earn, and they cannot be sure of\r\nthis without planning ahead and keeping accounts. Saving in this\r\nway is largely a matter of habit; but it is astonishing how many\r\nfail to form the habit. Court records show that out of every 100\r\nmen who die, 82 leave no income-producing estates, or that about\r\n85 per cent who reach the age of 65 are dependent upon relatives\r\nor upon the community. \"Out of every 100 widows, only 18 are left\r\nin comfortable circumstances, while 47 are obliged to go to work\r\nand 35 are left in absolute want.\" [Footnote: S.W. Strauss, \"The\r\nGreater Thrift,\" National Education Association PROCEEDINGS, 1916,\r\np. 278.]\r\n\r\nAMERICAN EXTRAVAGANCE\r\n\r\nWise buying means saving money; and so does the wise use of what\r\nwe buy. It is said that an American ship can be distinguished from\r\nthe ships of other nations in harbor by the flocks of gulls that\r\nhover around to feast on the food thrown overboard. Whether this\r\nis true or not, Americans have a reputation for wastefulness. It\r\nhas been called our chief national sin. It is said that a family\r\nin France can live in comfort on what an American family in the\r\nsame circumstances ordinarily throws away. An average load of\r\ngarbage in New York City has been shown to contain fifty dollars'\r\nworth of good food materials.\r\n\r\nWHAT SMALL SAVINGS WILL DO\r\n\r\nInvestigations by the Food Administration showed that there is\r\nenough glycerine in a ton of garbage to make explosives for 14\r\nshells, enough fat and acid to make 75 bars of soap, and enough\r\nfertilizer to grow 8 bushels of wheat. It is said that 24 cities\r\nwasted enough garbage to make 4 million pounds of nitroglycerine,\r\n40 million cakes of soap, and fertilizer for 3 million bushels of\r\nwheat. On the other hand, 300 cities produced 52 million pounds of\r\npork by feeding their garbage to hogs.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has shown that the waste of a half-\r\ncup of milk daily by each of the 20 million families in the United\r\nStates would equal in a year the total production of 400 thousand\r\ncows; that one ounce of meat or fat saved daily would in a year\r\nmean 875 thousand steers, or a million hogs; and that if 81\r\npercent of the whole wheat were used in bread instead of 75\r\npercent, the saving in a year would feed 12 million people. During\r\nthe war our government organized a campaign for the salvage of\r\n\"junk,\" and the total amount collected had a value of 1 1/2\r\nbillion dollars. The school children of Des Moines, Iowa, are\r\nreported to have gathered and sold two thousand dollars' worth of\r\nwaste paper in one week, and those of many other communities\r\nobtained similar results.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF BY-PRODUCTS\r\n\r\nEvery successful business man is constantly vigilant to discover\r\nand remedy waste in his business--waste of materials, time, and\r\neffort. Many of the most valuable products in certain industries\r\nare \"by-products,\"--that is, products produced as an incident to\r\nthe main industry and from materials that otherwise would have\r\nbeen wasted. In the manufacture of gas from coal, for example,\r\nimportant by-products are coke, tar, and ammonia. There has been\r\ngreat waste in the lumber industry, but now practically every\r\nscrap from the tree may be used. In the Forestry Products\r\nLaboratory at the University of Wisconsin, a process has been\r\ndiscovered of producing from 15 to 25 gallons of wood alcohol from\r\na ton of sawdust--and sawdust has many other uses. These are only\r\nillustrations. Scientists and inventors, many of them employed by\r\nthe government, are constantly at work finding uses for waste\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nWASTEFULNESS IN FARMING\r\n\r\nWastefulness is found in great variety in farming activities. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nWhy plant seed only 60 or 70 per cent of which will germinate\r\nwhen, for a few dollars extra and a little work, seed may be\r\nprocured that will average 90 to 95 per cent in the germination\r\ntest? Why purchase or cultivate a worthless crab apple tree or a\r\nhybrid when Rome Beauty, Northern Spy, or Grimes Golden, and other\r\nstandard varieties of apples may be secured for a few additional\r\ncents? Why feed and care for a \"scrub\" pig, calf, or colt when it\r\nwill bring at maturity only half or two thirds the price of a\r\nthoroughbred? ... It is not thrift to invest money in second-rate\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nSome farmers are so careless ... that they do not husk their corn\r\nin the fall but leave it standing in the field until late winter\r\nor early spring. By this time the fodder is somewhat decayed and\r\nunfit for feeding purposes. Possibly a third of the corn has been\r\neaten by the birds, a third of it has rotted, and a third of it\r\nremains in a damp and moldy condition. ... Many boys could make\r\ngood wages by going over the corn field at cutting time and\r\ncollecting the ears lying on the ground. ... Often a farmer will\r\ncut down his hay, paying no attention whatever to the reports of\r\nthe weather bureau ... Apples shaken from the trees by the wind\r\ndecay on the ground ...\r\n\r\nThe bearings of mowing machines and reapers often suffer excessive\r\nwear because the owner neglects to keep them properly oiled. Often\r\na wheat drill, a mowing machine, a threshing machine, or an engine\r\nis left out of doors for a whole year, or for several months after\r\nthe farmer has ceased to use it. A good piece of machinery, if\r\njudiciously used, properly lubricated, and put away in a dry\r\nplace, may last from ten to twenty years, while the life of such\r\nmachinery will only be about half as long without proper care. If\r\na wooden handle rots loose from its fastenings it is an indication\r\nthat the handle has not been thoroughly dried after it has been\r\nused. Tools rust out very readily if they are not kept dry and\r\nthoroughly oiled ... So careless are some farmers that hoes,\r\nshovels, mattocks, wrenches, saws, and axes are thrown down in the\r\nfield or woods to lie there until it is again necessary to use\r\nthem. It often takes hours to find an article thus misplaced or\r\nthrown aside. It is economy of time to know just where to find\r\neverything on the farm. [Footnote: The Teaching of Thrift, by H.\r\nR. Bonner, Assistant State Superintendent of Schools, West\r\nVirginia, pp. 22, 23.]\r\n\r\nThe topics on page 180 from publications of the States Relations\r\nService of the Department of Agriculture are suggestive:\r\n\r\nPreventing loss of food in the home:\r\n  Suitable food storage places and equipment.\r\n  Essentials of a good refrigerator.\r\n  The care of winter vegetables and fruit.\r\n  The care of perishable vegetables and fruit.\r\n  Prevention of spoilage of milk, meat, and fish.\r\n  Preservation of eggs.\r\n  Care of bread and other baked products.\r\n  What should not go into the garbage pail.\r\n  Good cooking and attractive serving.\r\n  Failure to use perishable food promptly.\r\n  Failure to use left-overs completely.\r\n  Failure to use all food materials (fats, meat and fish bones, etc.).\r\n  Leaving small portions of food in mixing and cooking dishes.\r\n  Lack of accurate measuring and mixing, so that food is not palatable.\r\n  Allowing food to be scorched or otherwise spoiled in preparation.\r\n  Providing over-generous portions in serving.\r\n  Failure to eat all food served.\r\nPreventing loss of food in the market:\r\n  Sanitary display cases for food.\r\n  Prevention of \"sampling\" and handling of food.\r\n  Food protection in food carts and delivery wagons.\r\n  Proper care of milk.\r\n  Proper care of meat and fish.\r\n  Prevention of cereal products from deterioration.\r\n  Protection of fruits and vegetables.\r\n  The care of bread and bakery products.\r\n  Careful selection of food.\r\nFollowing are special points which might be discussed:\r\n  The well-planned house.\r\n  Saving steps by better arrangement of equipment.\r\n  Lessening work by systematizing it.\r\n  Menu-planning for lessened work in preparation.\r\n  Household lighting.\r\n  Labor-saving equipment in the laundry, the kitchen, and the sewing room.\r\n  Labor-saving devices for house cleaning.\r\n  Leading a simple life.\r\n\r\nApply to your home demonstration agent, or write to States\r\nRelations Service, for publications relating to thrift in food,\r\nclothing, fuel, etc.\r\n\r\nTHRIFT IN INVESTMENT\r\n\r\n(4) Thrift involves a wise use of savings. They may be invested in\r\na home, a wise use because of the satisfaction that a home\r\nproduces. If the home is well located, well built, and well kept\r\nup, it will probably also increase in money value. Savings may be\r\ninvested in machinery for farming, manufacturing, or mining; in a\r\nstock of goods to be sold at a profit; in houses or office\r\nbuildings to be rented to others; or they may be lent to others\r\nwho pay interest for their use. In all these cases money\r\nrepresents CAPITAL--capital being the machinery or tools and other\r\nequipment with which wealth is produced.\r\n\r\nCapital is brought into existence in only one way--that is, by\r\nconsuming less than is produced. If one has a dollar one can spend\r\nit either for an article of consumption, say confectionery, or for\r\nan article of production, say a spade. He who buys a spade becomes\r\na capitalist to the amount of a dollar--that is, he becomes the\r\nowner of tools. The process is precisely the same whether the\r\namount in question is a dollar or a million dollars. [Footnote:\r\nT.N. Carver, \"How to Use Farm Credit,\" FARMERS' BULLETIN 593, U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, p. 2.]\r\n\r\nBORROWING\r\n\r\nEvery business requires capital, some more than others. Farming\r\nrequires more capital to-day than formerly because of the\r\nincreased use of machinery. The necessary capital must either be\r\nsaved by the person who wants to use it, or borrowed from others\r\nwho have saved it.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of borrowing is that one does not have to wait so\r\nlong to get possession of the tools and equipment. One can get\r\nthem at once and make them produce the means of paying for\r\nthemselves. Without them the farmer's production might be so low\r\nas to make it difficult ever to accumulate enough with which to\r\nbuy them. With their help he may be able to pay for them--that is,\r\nto pay off the debt--in a shorter time than it would take to\r\naccumulate the purchase price without them. That is the only\r\nadvantage of credit in any business, but it is a great advantage\r\nto those who know how to use it. [Footnote 2: T.N. Carver, \"How to\r\nUse Farm Credit,\" FARMERS' BULLETIN, 593, U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, p. 2.]\r\n\r\nCREDIT\r\n\r\nCredit is simply a person's ability to borrow and depends upon the\r\nconfidence that others place in him. This confidence depends on\r\nhis reputation for honesty and his known ability to repay. A man,\r\nas a rule, has to HAVE something--land or property of other kind--\r\nthat he can offer as security before he can borrow much. It is for\r\nthis reason that thrift is essential to a man's credit--thrift and\r\nhonesty.\r\n\r\nThere is no magic about credit. It is a powerful agency for good\r\nin the hands of those who know how to use it. So is a buzz saw.\r\nThey are about equally dangerous in the hands of those who do not\r\nunderstand them. ... Many a farmer would be better off to-day if\r\nhe had never had a chance to borrow money at all, or go into debt\r\nfor the things which he bought. However, there is no reason why\r\nthose farmers who do know how to use credit should not have it.\r\n\r\nShortsighted people, however, who do not realize how inexorably\r\nthe time of payment arrives, who do not know how rapidly tools\r\nwear out and have to be replaced, or do not keep accounts in order\r\nthat they may tell exactly where they stand financially, will do\r\nwell to avoid borrowing. Debts have to be paid with deadly\r\ncertainty, and they who do not have the wherewithal when the day\r\nof reckoning arrives become bankrupt with equal certainty.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there is nothing disgraceful in borrowing for\r\nproductive purposes. The feeling that it is not quite respectable\r\nto go into debt has grown out of the old habit of borrowing to pay\r\nliving expenses. That was regarded, perhaps rightly, as a sign of\r\nincompetency. ... But to borrow for a genuinely productive\r\npurpose, for a purpose that will bring you in more than enough to\r\npay off your debt, principal and interest, is a profitable\r\nenterprise. It shows business sagacity and courage, and is not a\r\nthing to be ashamed of. But it cannot be too much emphasized that\r\nthe would-be borrower must calculate very carefully and be sure\r\nthat it is a productive enterprise before he goes into debt.\r\n[Footnote: T. N. Carver, \"How to Use Farm Credit,\" p. 2.]\r\n\r\nCOOPERATION FOR CREDIT\r\n\r\nEven though a farmer be thrifty, industrious, and honest, the\r\nconditions of farm business are such that it has not always been\r\neasy for him to borrow capital. Here again cooperation helps. In\r\nsome of our states the law permits the organization of CREDIT\r\nUNIONS. The members are farmers of a neighborhood or district and,\r\ntherefore, are acquainted with one another. Each member must buy\r\nshares of stock, which provides a certain amount of funds. The\r\nunion may also receive deposits of money, paying interest on them\r\nas a savings bank would do. This increases the funds and also\r\nencourages thrift on the part of the farmer. Idle money, or money\r\nthat might otherwise be spent unwisely, is thus made productive.\r\nIn some unions, as in Massachusetts, children are encouraged to\r\ndeposit their small savings, and in some cases half the capital of\r\nthe union is made up of such small savings deposits. From these\r\nfunds loans are made to members of the union on reasonable terms,\r\nprovided they are to be used for productive purposes. The union\r\nmay also borrow money from the bank in town on the COLLECTIVE\r\nCREDIT of its members for the improvement of agricultural\r\nconditions in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL AID TO THE FARMERS' CREDIT\r\n\r\nSimilar aid to the farmers' credit has been given by the national\r\ngovernment through the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916. This Act\r\ncreated a Federal Farm Loan Board in the Treasury Department, and\r\ntwelve Federal Land Banks, one in each of twelve districts into\r\nwhich the United States was divided for that purpose. Through the\r\norganization provided by the board and the banks, a farmer may now\r\nborrow money on more favorable terms, but only on condition that\r\nhe agrees to use the money for the purchase and improvement of\r\nland or for equipment, and to engage in the actual cultivation of\r\nthe farm for the development of which he desired the money.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act afford an excellent\r\nillustration of how government promotes citizen cooperation. The\r\ngovernment does not lend the money to the farmers; it merely\r\nprovides the machinery by which the farmers may cooperate among\r\nthemselves, and also secure the cooperation of investors in all\r\nparts of the country, to obtain capital necessary for the proper\r\ndevelopment of the land. As a rule the farmer can borrow money\r\nfrom the land bank only by being a member of a local \"national\r\nfarm loan association.\" His dealings with the bank are through\r\nthis association. His membership in the association gives him\r\nbetter standing and secures for him better terms than he could get\r\nif acting separately. Moreover, the money that the bank lends to\r\nthe farmer comes from the farmers who belong to the association,\r\nand from investors in all parts of the country, who buy shares of\r\nstock in the bank and bonds issued by the bank on the security of\r\nthe farmers' land and equipment. The whole scheme is one of\r\ncooperation which would be impossible but for the legislation,\r\nfinancial support, and supervision of the government at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nPARTNERSHIP IN THE NATION'S BUSINESS\r\n\r\nIt will be seen then that much of the capital that a farmer uses\r\nis borrowed, and is made up of small savings of other people--some\r\nof them his neighbors, others in distant places. The same is true\r\nwith respect to the capital used in all other businesses. The\r\nenormous capital of railroads is derived chiefly from the savings\r\nof millions of people, some of whom buy shares of railroad stock\r\ndirectly, but most of whom deposit their savings in banks or other\r\ninstitutions which, in turn, lend it to the railroads or invest it\r\nin their stock. The farmer or the school boy who has a savings\r\naccount in a neighboring bank thus may become a partner in various\r\nbusiness enterprises of the country. His dollars or dimes, added\r\nto the dollars and dimes of many other people, are used to buy\r\nmachinery and tools and materials, and to pay labor. Because of\r\nthe service performed by his savings he receives interest on his\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT\r\n\r\nThere are many opportunities for young people to invest savings in\r\nproductive enterprises,--perhaps more in rural communities than\r\nelsewhere. The different kinds of boys' and girls' clubs\r\nillustrate the variety of channels through which money may be both\r\nearned and invested. As soon as a boy invests a little money in a\r\npig, or a calf, or garden tools, he becomes a capitalist to that\r\nextent. It is to be hoped that not many have the experience of the\r\nboy described in the following lines: [Footnote: Read by R.H.\r\nWilson, in an address before the National Council of Education,\r\nN.E.A. PROCEEDINGS, 1917, p. 133.]\r\n\r\n    Johnnie bought a little pig with money he had earned,\r\n    He named her Nell and fed her well, and lots of tricks she learned.\r\n    But Nellie grew to be a sow, had piggies quite a few,\r\n    Then father up and sold them, and kept the money, too.\r\n\r\n    Johnnie took a little calf as pay for hoeing corn,\r\n    He loved the calf and the calf loved him as sure as you are born.\r\n    The calfie grew to be a cow, as all good calfies do,\r\n    Then father up and sold her, and kept the money, too.\r\n\r\n    Now, Johnnie loved his little pets, but father loved the pelf,\r\n    So Johnnie left his father's farm and struck out for himself.\r\n    Said Johnnie's pa, one summer day, \"I often wonder why\r\n    Boys don't like life upon the farm, 'the city' is their cry.\"\r\n\r\n    \"It always will be strange to me,\" continued Johnnie's pa,\r\n    \"It only goes to prove, though, how ungrateful children are.\"\r\n    When Johnnie heard what father said, he gave a bitter laugh,\r\n    And thought of his empty childhood and of his pig and calf.\r\n\r\nSavings may be deposited in savings banks, which accept small\r\ndeposits and pay compound interest, usually at a rate of 3 per\r\ncent or 3 1/2 per cent. Such banks operate in accordance with\r\nstate or national laws to protect the depositor against loss. Many\r\nschools conduct school savings banks. The pupils bring their small\r\namounts to the teacher or to some pupil acting as \"teller,\" the\r\ncollected funds then being deposited in some bank in the\r\ncommunity. These school banks promote habits of thrift and afford\r\nexperience in business methods, besides bringing into use in the\r\nworld's work many small amounts of money that would otherwise be\r\nlying idle or spent unwisely.\r\n\r\nPOSTAL SAVINGS SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIn 1910 Congress established the Postal Savings System under which\r\nany post office may be a savings bank. Any person over ten years\r\nof age may deposit money at the postal savings bank in amounts of\r\nfrom $1.00 to $25.00, receiving from the postmaster POSTAL SAVINGS\r\nCERTIFICATES as evidence of the deposit. Provision is made for\r\nsavings accounts of less than a dollar by selling POSTAL SAVINGS\r\nSTAMPS at ten cents each, ten of which may be exchanged for a\r\ndollar certificate. Two per cent interest is paid on postal\r\nsavings, but savings certificates may be exchanged for POSTAL\r\nSAVINGS BONDS, bearing interest at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nLENDING TO THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe purchase of Liberty Bonds or Savings Stamps and Thrift Stamps\r\nis a good investment and a patriotic act. The money raised in this\r\nway is used for the national defense and for reconstruction after\r\nthe war. The Savings Division of the United States Treasury\r\nDepartment carries on a campaign of thrift education. Among other\r\nthings, it promotes the organization of savings societies and\r\nthrift clubs, because thrift is a habit which is encouraged by the\r\nexample and cooperation of others. In Randolph County, Indiana,\r\nfor example, each consolidated school has its thrift club, and\r\nover 75 per cent of the pupils are members. One of these schools\r\nsold over $11,000 worth of thrift stamps, and others sold from\r\n$1500 to $3500 worth. Savings societies exist among the workmen of\r\nmany industries, and employers report that these have increased\r\nthe purchase of homes, and have resulted in a saving of materials\r\nand tools because of the habits of thrift established.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE\r\n\r\nAmong the many other agencies to promote thrift we shall only\r\nmention BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS and INSURANCE. The purpose\r\nof building and loan associations is to help people of small means\r\nto purchase or build homes. Insurance affords a particularly good\r\nillustration of organized cooperation. The PREMIUMS paid by\r\nthousands of policy holders produce a large sum of money, part of\r\nwhich goes to pay the expenses of the insurance company, but most\r\nof which is invested in enterprises that cause the amount rapidly\r\nto increase. Out of this fund the occasional losses of individuals\r\nare paid. Life insurance is a good form of investment. It provides\r\nfor the future of the family of the insured in case of his death.\r\nBy the ENDOWMENT plan the insured may himself receive, at the end\r\nof a specified number of years, all that he has paid in premiums\r\ntogether with interest.\r\n\r\nDuring the war our national government itself insured the soldiers\r\nagainst death or injury. This was known as WAR RISK INSURANCE. At\r\nthe end of the war the soldier had the privilege of converting the\r\nwar risk insurance into a regular form of insurance, still\r\nprovided, however, by the government itself. One of our states\r\nalso, Wisconsin, sells life insurance to its citizens.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed with our study we shall encounter other aspects of\r\nthrift in various chapters. As a nation we may be thrifty or\r\nunthrifty in the use of our resources (see Chapters XIV and XV).\r\nThrift is as essential in our \"community housekeeping,\" which is\r\ncarried on by government, as in our homes and business. But we can\r\nhardly expect thrift to become a national characteristic unless it\r\nfirst becomes a personal habit.\r\n\r\nAre you a capitalist? If so, explain in what way.\r\n\r\nWhat forms does the capital take with which your father does\r\nbusiness?\r\n\r\nWhat capital does an Eskimo have? the American Indians when the\r\ncountry was first settled?\r\n\r\nDo you belong to a thrift club? Would it be desirable to organize\r\none in your school? Confer with your teacher and principal about\r\nit. Write to the Savings Division, U.S. Treasury Department,\r\nWashington, D.C., for literature regarding organization.\r\n\r\nIs there a credit union, or a savings association, or other\r\norganization to promote thrift in your community? If so, find out\r\nhow it operates.\r\n\r\nWrite a story on the subject, \"What my five dollars may accomplish\r\nafter I put it in the savings bank, before it comes back to me\r\nwith interest.\"\r\n\r\nWhy are people willing to accept a lower rate of interest from a\r\npostal savings bank than from an ordinary savings bank?\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nIn LESSONS IN COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE:\r\n\r\nSeries A:  Lesson 6, Capital.\r\n           Lesson 13, U.S. Food Administration.\r\n           Lesson 14, Substitute foods.\r\n           Lesson 15, Woman as the family purchaser.\r\n           Lesson 21, Borrowing capital for modern business.\r\n           Lesson 22, The commercial bank and modern business.\r\n\r\nSeries B:  Lesson 7, An intelligently selected diet.\r\n           Lesson 22, Financing the war.\r\n           Lesson 23, Thrift and war savings.\r\n\r\nSeries C:  Lesson 7, Preserving foods.\r\n           Lesson 8, Preventing waste of human beings.\r\n           Lesson 14, The U.S. Fuel Administration.\r\n           Lesson 16, The Commercial Economy Board of the Council\r\n                      of National Defense.\r\n\r\nWrite Savings Division, U.S. Treasury Department, for materials;\r\nespecially \"Ten Lessons in Thrift,\" and \"Teaching Thrift in\r\nElementary Schools.\" Both of these contain lists of readings.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Office Department has publications descriptive of the\r\npostal savings service.\r\n\r\nFarmers' Bulletins, U.S. Department of Agriculture, relating to\r\nthrift.\r\n\r\nFederal Farm Loan Act, How It Benefits the Farmer, Farmers'\r\nBulletin 792.\r\n\r\nSee references in footnotes in this chapter.\r\n\r\nDunn, THE COMMUNITY AND THE CITIZEN, Chapter XIV, \"Waste and\r\nSaving.\"\r\n\r\nThe local public library, the State Library, and the State\r\nAgricultural College, will doubtless furnish lists of references\r\nand perhaps provide materials.\r\n\r\nThe United States Bureau of Education will send list of\r\nreferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NATURE WAS MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN MAN.

A BOLD RACE HAS\r\nDERIVED INSPIRATION FROM THE SIZE, THE DIFFICULTY, THE DANGER OF\r\nTHE TASK.\"\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to buy a farm, what facts would you investigate in\r\nregard to land and location?\r\n\r\nWhat farm in your neighborhood comes nearest to meeting your\r\nrequirements in these matters? Explain fully why.\r\n\r\nMake a sketch map of a farm in your neighborhood, preferably one\r\nupon which you have lived, showing as nearly as you can the\r\nboundaries, the position of highlands and lowlands, marshes,\r\ntimber, streams, etc. Also the position of house, barns, bridges,\r\nroads, and other important features.\r\n\r\nDid the features of the land indicated on your map determine the\r\nlocation of the buildings? of the roads and bridges? the kinds of\r\ncrops raised on different parts of the farm?\r\n\r\nShould the surface features of the land be taken into account in\r\ndetermining the position of the house and barns in relation to\r\neach other? Why?\r\n\r\nHas the character of the land influenced the life of the farmer's\r\nfamily in any way? Explain.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nDirectly or indirectly, geographical conditions affect every\r\naspect of community life and help or hinder us in satisfying all\r\nof our wants (see Chapter I). Their influence is chiefly felt,\r\nhowever, in their relation to the economic interest of the people;\r\nthat is, in relation to earning a living and the production of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH THE LAND\r\n\r\nEvery step that man has taken to make his relations with the land\r\npermanent and definite has been a step of progress in\r\ncivilization, as when, for example, the savage hunter became a\r\nherdsman, or the herdsman an agriculturist. We live to-day in an\r\nage of machinery, which is a result of turning to our use the\r\nmetals from the depths of the earth and the power derived from the\r\nforces of nature, as in the application of steam, electricity, and\r\nthe explosive force of gasoline. Many have had a part in this work\r\nof establishing relations with the land: explorers; scientists who\r\nhave discovered the uses of our varied mineral and vegetable\r\nresources and how to make the forces of nature serve us; engineers\r\nwho have built our railroads and bridges and tunneled our\r\nmountains. A most important part has been taken by those who win\r\ntheir living directly from nature's resources--the woodsman, the\r\nminer, the farmer; and the service of the farmer has been\r\nespecially great in giving stability to our community life.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE MEANS A SETTLED LIFE\r\n\r\nThose American Indians were most civilized who had developed\r\nagriculture to the highest point, because this meant a settled\r\nlife. If we recall the story of the colonization of America we\r\nshall remember that it was not successfully accomplished by the\r\ngold hunters and fur traders who came first, but only when those\r\ncame who, as farmers, began to cultivate the soil. Later, as the\r\npopulation moved westward across the Alleghenies into the\r\nMississippi Valley and on to the Pacific Coast, the hunters and\r\ntrappers were the scouts who found the way, while the real army\r\nthat took possession of the land was an army of farmers.\r\n\r\nDid the American Indians who formerly lived in your locality lead\r\na settled life? Why? Were they agriculturists to any extent? If\r\nso, what do you know of their method of agriculture?\r\n\r\nOf what pastoral peoples have you read? Why was their life more\r\nsettled than that of hunting peoples? Why less settled than that\r\nof farmers?\r\n\r\nWhy were settlements by gold hunters and fur traders likely not to\r\nbe permanent?\r\n\r\nDo you know of important mining towns that have had a brief life?\r\n\r\nPROTECTING OWNERSHIP OF LAND\r\n\r\nThe story of how individuals acquired the right to own land is an\r\ninteresting one, but too long to be told here. The right has long\r\nbeen recognized and protected by government. If your father owns a\r\npiece of land he doubtless has a DEED for it, containing an\r\naccurate description of the land and giving him title to\r\nownership. In each county there is an office of government where\r\nall deeds are recorded--the office of the recorder or register of\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\nThe record of every piece of land is thus kept and is open to\r\nexamination by any one. If a man wishes to buy a piece of land he\r\nwill go to the office of the recorder and find out whether the\r\ntitle to the land is clear. Only by so doing may he be protected\r\nagainst error or fraud.\r\n\r\nTRANSFERS OF LAND\r\n\r\nSince lands are likely to change hands a number of times, and\r\nsince men frequently MORTGAGE their lands as security for loans or\r\nother indebtedness, thus giving to others a claim to their land,\r\nit is sometimes a tedious and difficult task for a buyer to trace\r\nthe record back and to be sure that the title to the land is\r\nclear. It sometimes requires months. There are lawyers who make a\r\nbusiness of examining the records and making ABSTRACTS OF TITLES.\r\nThis involves expense. Besides, there is always the chance that a\r\nmistake may be made somewhere. For this reason some states have\r\nadopted a plan known as the TORRENS SYSTEM of land transfer, from\r\nthe name of the man who devised it in Australia.\r\n\r\nUnder the Torrens System the government itself, through its proper\r\nofficer, may examine the title to any piece of land. The land is\r\nthen REGISTERED, and the owner is given a certificate as evidence.\r\nIf a mortgage is placed on the land or if it changes hands the\r\ntransaction is recorded on the certificate and in the office\r\nrecords. A mere glance at the record of registry or at the\r\ncertificate is sufficient to ascertain the title to the land. Thus\r\ntime and expense are saved; and moreover the government gives its\r\nabsolute guarantee to the owner or buyer as to his rights in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe Torrens System is in use in some form in fourteen states of\r\nthe Union, in the Philippines and Hawaii, and in various other\r\ncountries of the world.\r\n\r\nTHE SURVEY OF THE PUBLIC LANDS\r\n\r\nWhen settlers began to occupy the lands west of the Alleghenies,\r\nmany of them laid claim to tracts without much regard for the\r\nclaims of others. Boundary lines were indefinite. Where surveys\r\nwere made they were often inaccurate. Much confusion resulted.\r\nDisputes arose that frequently found their way into the courts and\r\ndragged on for many years. The government sought to put an end to\r\nthis state of affairs, and in Thomas Jefferson's administration a\r\nsurvey was begun to establish lines by which any piece of land\r\nmight be located and defined with exactness.\r\n\r\nThe government survey was begun by establishing certain north and\r\nsouth lines known as PRINCIPAL MERIDIANS. There are twenty-four of\r\nthese, the first being the meridian that separates Indiana from\r\nOhio, while the last runs through the state of Oregon. At\r\nintervals of six miles east and west of the principal meridians\r\nwere established other meridians called RANGE LINES. A parallel of\r\nlatitude was then chosen as a BASE LINE, and at intervals of six\r\nmiles north and south of the base line were established TOWNSHIP\r\nLINES. These township lines with the range lines divide the\r\ncountry into areas six miles square called TOWNSHIPS. A township\r\nmay thus be located with reference to its nearest base line and\r\nprincipal meridian (see diagram I).\r\n\r\nSince meridians converge as we go north (look at a globe), the\r\ntownships are not exactly square, and become slightly smaller\r\ntoward the north. To correct this, certain parallels north and\r\nsouth of the base line were chosen as CORRECTION LINES, from which\r\nthe survey began again as from the original base line.\r\n\r\nEach township is divided into SECTIONS one mile square, and\r\ntherefore containing 640 acres each. These sections are numbered\r\nin each township from 1 to 36 as indicated in diagram III. Each\r\nsection is further subdivided into halves and quarters, which are\r\ndesignated as in diagram IV.\r\n\r\nThis government survey has been made only in the \"public lands\"\r\n(see below, p. 197). It is still being carried on by the General\r\nLand Office of the Department of the Interior. In 1917 more than\r\n10,000,000 acres, or nearly 16,000 square miles, were surveyed. In\r\nthat year there still remained unsurveyed more than 900,000 square\r\nmiles of public land, 590,000 of which were in Alaska and 320,000\r\nin the United States proper. In the original thirteen states along\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard a similar survey has been made, but either\r\nby private enterprise or under the authority of the state or\r\ncounty governments. Massachusetts has recently spent a large sum\r\nof money in a new survey of the state for the purpose of verifying\r\nand correcting doubtful boundaries.\r\n\r\nHas your father a deed to the land you live on? If so, ask him to\r\nshow it to you and explain it. How is the land described?\r\n\r\nAt the first convenient time, make a visit to the office of the\r\nrecorder of deeds in your county, and ask to have some of the\r\nrecords shown and explained to you, preferably the record of the\r\nproperty you occupy. Where is the office of the recorder? (A visit\r\nof this sort should be in company with the teacher or parent. A\r\nclass excursion for this and other purposes may well be arranged\r\nfor.)\r\n\r\nWhat is a MORTGAGE? An ABSTRACT OF TITLE? (Consult parents.)\r\n\r\nIs the Torrens System in use in your state?\r\n\r\nIs your state a \"public land state\"?\r\n\r\nFrom the deed to your father's land, or from the records in the\r\nrecorder's office, or from a map of your county showing the survey\r\nlines, locate the land you live on, as indicated in the\r\naccompanying diagrams.\r\n\r\nIn what section and township is your schoolhouse?\r\n\r\nAre there still any \"public lands\" in your state?\r\n\r\nAre the boundary lines of farms in your neighborhood regular or\r\nirregular? How does this happen?\r\n\r\nDo you know of any boundary disputes between farmers or other\r\ncitizens in your community? What machinery of government exists to\r\nsettle such disputes?\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC LANDS\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Revolutionary War, the territory of the United\r\nStates extended west as far as the Mississippi River. That part of\r\nthis territory which lay west of the Allegheny Mountains had been\r\nclaimed by seven of the thirteen states that formed the Union; but\r\nsoon after the war they ceded these western possessions to the\r\nUnited States, having received a promise from Congress that these\r\nlands, which were largely unoccupied at the time, should be\r\ndisposed of \"FOR THE COMMON BENEFIT OF THE UNITED STATES.\" They\r\nthus became PUBLIC LANDS; that is, they belonged to the people of\r\nthe nation as a whole. The common interest in these public lands\r\nwas one of the chief influences that kept the thirteen states\r\nunited under one government during the troubled times between the\r\nclose of the Revolution and the adoption of the Constitution in\r\n1789. As time went on, the public lands of the nation were\r\nincreased by the acquisition of new territory, [Footnote:\r\nLouisiana Territory was acquired in 1803, Oregon in 1805, Florida\r\nin 1812 and 1819, Texas in 1845, California and New Mexico in\r\n1846-48, the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, Alaska in 1867.] Of the\r\n3,600,000 square miles comprising the United States and Alaska\r\nmore than three fourths has at some time been public land; but of\r\nthis there now remain, exclusive of Alaska, only about 360,000\r\nsquare miles, much of which is forest and mineral land, unsuitable\r\nfor agriculture.\r\n\r\nDISPOSAL OF THE PUBLIC LANDS\r\n\r\nTo turn this great domain with all its resources to the fullest\r\nservice of the nation has been one of the greatest problems with\r\nwhich our government has had to deal. In the early part of our\r\nhistory various plans were tried by which to secure the occupancy\r\nand development of the agricultural lands by farmers, until in\r\n1862 the first Homestead Act was passed by Congress.\r\n\r\nAbout 10,000,000 acres of the public land were given to soldiers\r\nwho fought in the Revolution and in the War of 1812 in recognition\r\nof then-service to their country. About 60,000,000 acres were\r\nlater given to veterans of the Mexican War.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1800 the plan in use for the disposition of the\r\npublic lands was to sell large areas to colonizing companies, with\r\nthe expectation that these companies would find settlers to whom\r\nthey would sell the land in small quantities at a profit. This was\r\nnot successful, as actual settlers found it difficult to get land\r\nthey wanted at prices they could afford.\r\n\r\nFrom 1800 to 1820 lands were sold in small areas ON CREDIT. Many\r\nbought more than they were able to pay for, and much land so\r\ndisposed of had to be taken back by the government.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 a third plan was adopted: That of selling land for cash in\r\nany quantity to any purchaser. This led to speculation,\r\nindividuals and companies of individuals buying recklessly,\r\nwithout intention of actual settlement, but with the purpose of\r\nselling again at a profit. This brought on a financial panic in\r\n1837.\r\n\r\nThen followed the \"PREEMPTION\" plan, by which actual settlers\r\ncould \"preempt\" land (get the first right to it) by merely taking\r\npossession and paying a cash price of $1.25 an acre.\r\n\r\nThe Homestead Act of 1862 was an extension of the preemption plan;\r\nbut instead of paying a cash price, the settler could acquire the\r\nland merely by living on it for a period of five years (now three)\r\nand paying fees of about $40.00.\r\n\r\nHOMESTEAD ACTS\r\n\r\nThe Homestead Act, like earlier laws, made a direct appeal to\r\nmen's desire to earn a living, to acquire property, and especially\r\nto own homes. It has been modified from time to time, but in all\r\nessentials it still remains in force and provides that any citizen\r\nof the United States who has reached the age of twenty-one, or who\r\nis the head of a family, may acquire a farm on condition of living\r\nupon it for a period of three years, cultivating the land and\r\nerecting a dwelling, and paying to the government a small fee. The\r\nsize of the farm that he may so acquire varies according to the\r\nnature of the land, but the usual homestead on good agricultural\r\nland is limited to 160 acres.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the government has been to encourage ACTUAL\r\nSETTLEMENT in order to secure the development of the nation's\r\nresources, and for this purpose to allow each settler enough land\r\nto enable him to support a family in comfort. It was decided that\r\n160 acres of GOOD FARM LAND was enough.\r\n\r\nSome portions of the public land, however, are less productive\r\nthan others. Where the rainfall is slight and where irrigation is\r\nimpracticable, and yet where crops can be raised by the \"dry\r\nfarming\" process, the law allows a settler to take 320 acres.\r\n\r\nA settler may also obtain 320 acres in the \"desert lands\" of some\r\nof the western states. These lands may be made productive by\r\nirrigation, but the settler must construct his own irrigation\r\nsystem. Originally 640 acres were allowed in such lands, but the\r\namount has been reduced to 320 acres, and the Commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office now recommends (1916) that it be further\r\nreduced to 160 acres.\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the desert region which the government has\r\nalready reclaimed by irrigation, thus making the land extremely\r\nfruitful, the amount usually allowed a settler is from 40 to 80\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThere are regions where the land is suitable only for stock\r\nraising and for forage crops. Here Congress has decided that 640\r\nacres is a fair amount for the support of a family.\r\n\r\nLands that are valuable for their timber and mineral resources are\r\ndisposed of on different terms, but on somewhat the same\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nRECLAMATION OF LANDS BY SOLDIERS\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war in 1918 a plan was proposed by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior to secure the occupation of land by\r\nreturning soldiers. Since the lands suitable for farming in their\r\nnatural state have practically all been disposed of; the plan\r\ncontemplates the reclamation of arid and swamp lands, and of land\r\nfrom which the forests have been cut but which are still covered\r\nwith stumps. It is proposed that returned soldiers shall be\r\nemployed by the government in the work of reclaiming the land, and\r\nthat those who desire to become farmers may buy their farms in the\r\nreclaimed lands at a reasonable price, and with a period of thirty\r\nor forty years in which to pay for them. The Secretary of the\r\nInterior said: \"This plan does not contemplate anything like\r\ncharity to the soldier ... He is not to be made to feel that he is\r\na dependent. On the contrary, he is to continue in a sense in the\r\nservice of the Government. Instead of destroying our enemies he is\r\nto develop our resources.\" Much of the land whose reclamation by\r\nand for returning soldiers is thus contemplated is not now public\r\nland, but is lying idle in the hands of private owners.\r\n\r\nLAND SETTLEMENT IN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nThe state of California has recently enacted a law known as the\r\nLand Settlement Act, which provides for \"a demonstration in\r\nplanned rural development.\" \"Its first idea is educational, to\r\nshow what democracy in action can accomplish.\" Under the terms of\r\nthis act the state acting through a Land Settlement Board and with\r\nthe cooperation of experts from the University of California, has\r\npurchased several thousand acres of land at Durham, in Butte\r\nCounty, which it sells to settlers on easy terms. It also lends\r\nmoney to settlers for improvement and equipment for the farmers.\r\n\r\nThe California Land Settlement Act is significant, because it\r\neliminates speculation, it aims to create fixed communities by\r\nanticipating and providing those things essential to early and\r\nenduring success.\r\n\r\nAnother feature is the use it makes of cooperation. The settlers\r\nare at the outset brought into close business and social\r\nrelations. It reproduces the best feature of the New England town\r\nmeeting, as every member of the community has a share in the\r\ndiscussions and planning for the general welfare. This influence\r\nin rural life has been lacking in new communities in recent years.\r\nIn the great movement of people westward with its profligate\r\ndisposal of public land, settlement became migratory and\r\nspeculative. Every man was expected to look out for himself. Rural\r\nneighborhoods became separated into social and economic strata.\r\nThere was the nonresident landowner; the influential resident\r\nlandowner; the tenant, aloof and indifferent to community\r\nimprovements; and, below that, the farm laborer who had no social\r\nstatus and who in recent years, because of lack of opportunity and\r\nsocial recognition, has migrated into the cities where he could\r\nhave independence and self-respect, or has degenerated into a\r\nhobo.\r\n\r\n At Durham, for the first time in American land settlement, the\r\nfarm laborer who works for wages is recognized as having as useful\r\nand valuable a part in rural economy as the farm owner. The\r\nprovisions made for his home are intended to give to his wife and\r\nchildren comfort, independence, and self-respect; in other words,\r\nthe things that help create character and sustain patriotism. The\r\nfarm laborers' homes already built are one of the most attractive\r\nfeatures of the settlement; and when the community members gather\r\ntogether, as they do, to discuss matters that affect the progress\r\nof the settlement, or to arrange for cooperative buying and\r\nselling, the farm laborer and his family are active and respected\r\nmembers of the meetings.\r\n\r\nFrom maps in school histories study the claims of the seven states\r\nto western lands.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Ordinance of 1787?\r\n\r\nMake reports on the circumstances connected with our various\r\nterritorial acquisitions.\r\n\r\nFrom whom did the colonists get the right to the land in the\r\noriginal thirteen colonies?\r\n\r\nDo you know anyone who has ever taken up a \"homestead claim\"? If\r\nso, learn how it was done.\r\n\r\nIf possible, get a description of a \"land lottery\" and a \"land\r\nrush\" in newly opened public lands.\r\n\r\nGet all the information you can about the plan to provide land for\r\nthe soldiers, referred to above. Do you think this is a better\r\nplan than that of giving land to soldiers outright? Why? Is your\r\nstate likely to cooperate with the national government in carrying\r\nout this plan? How?\r\n\r\nTHE NATION'S INTERESTS ARE FIRST\r\n\r\nThe policy of the government of disposing of the public lands to\r\nindividuals has of course been of great benefit to the latter; but\r\nwe should not lose sight of the fact that the national well-being\r\nis the first consideration. As the Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office said in a recent report (1916), \"Every acre of public\r\nland disposed of under this line of legislation is AN INVESTMENT,\r\nthe profits to be found in the general development of the welfare\r\nof the nation at large.\"\r\n\r\nSAFEGUARDING THE INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUALS\r\n\r\nIt has been no simple matter to administer our public lands, and\r\nmistakes have been made. Sometimes the interests of individuals\r\nhave not been sufficiently safeguarded. Many settlers have\r\nsuffered serious loss, and many promising communities have failed,\r\nthrough the taking of homesteads in regions of little rainfall, as\r\nin western Kansas and Nebraska. The government now seeks to\r\nprotect homesteaders against such errors by distinguishing\r\ncarefully between lands suitable for ordinary agriculture and\r\nthose suitable only for dry-farming and stock-raising, by\r\ninforming prospective settlers in regard to the facts, and by\r\nallowing larger entries in lands of the latter classes. Another\r\nmistake was made in allowing many of the first claimants to stock-\r\nraising lands so to locate their claims as to acquire the\r\nexclusive use of the only available water supply for miles around,\r\nthus making useless other large tracts. This might have been\r\navoided by a little foresight.\r\n\r\nABUSE OF LAND LAWS\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the land laws have sometimes been abused. Large\r\nquantities of public land have fallen into the hands of\r\nspeculators whose purpose is not to develop its resources, but to\r\nmake a profit from the increased value of the land due to the\r\nefforts of others. Immense areas of land have thus been withheld\r\nfrom production, or have been made to produce to a limited extent\r\nonly, to the great loss of the nation.\r\n\r\nRAILROAD LANDS\r\n\r\nIn the days of transcontinental railroad building, large tracts of\r\nland were given to the railroad companies by the government, with\r\nthe expectation that they would dispose of it at reasonable prices\r\nto settlers attracted by the new transportation facilities, and\r\nwould use the proceeds in railway development. In fact, however,\r\nlarge quantities of this land have been held in an unproductive\r\nstate for speculative purposes.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of this is the case of the Oregon and California\r\nRailroad land grant, made by Congress in 1869 and 1870, and\r\ncomprising more than 4,200,000 acres, most of which bore a heavy\r\ngrowth of valuable timber. \"This railroad grant ... contained a\r\nspecial provision to the effect that the railroad company should\r\nsell the land it received to actual settlers only, in quantities\r\nnot greater than one-quarter section to one purchaser and at a\r\nprice not exceeding $2.50 an acre. By this precaution it was\r\nintended that in aiding the construction of the railroad an\r\nimmediate impetus should also be given to the settlement and\r\ndevelopment of the country through which the road was to be\r\nconstructed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter selling some of the lands according to the terms of the\r\nagreement, the railroad company ceased to live up to these terms\r\nand sold large bodies of the land to lumber interests, thus\r\nputting a stop to the development of the region in the way\r\nintended by the government. The government brought action against\r\nthe railroad company, the outcome of which is that the government\r\nhas bought back from the company at $2.50 an acre all of the lands\r\nof the grant which remained unsold, amounting to about 2,300,000\r\nacres and valued at from $30,000,000 to $50,000,000.\r\n\r\nThese lands are being classified \"in accordance with their chief\r\nvalue, either in power-site lands, timber lands, or agricultural\r\nlands,\" and are to be disposed of accordingly. The timber will be\r\nsold separately from the land, and the land will then be opened to\r\nhomestead entry.\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement the railroad company gets for the land all\r\nthat it was entitled to under the terms of the original grant. In\r\naddition, provision is made for the payment to the counties in\r\nwhich the land lies of the taxes which the railroad company has\r\nnot paid. As the lands are sold, the proceeds are to be divided\r\nbetween the state and the United States, the state receiving 50\r\npercent, 40 percent being paid into the general reclamation fund\r\nof the United States (see Chapter XIV, p. 213), and 10 per cent\r\ninto the general funds of the United States Treasury.\r\n\r\n(From the Report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office,\r\n1916, pp. 46-49).\r\n\r\nThis is a striking illustration of how our government, acting\r\nthrough Congress, the Courts, and the General Land Office of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, has sought to obtain justice for all\r\nparties concerned, and to fulfill the original purpose of securing\r\nthe development of the land in the interest of the state and the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nLANDS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nSomething like 133,000,000 acres of our public lands have from\r\ntime to time been turned over to the states, the proceeds to be\r\nused for the promotion of public education, for the construction\r\nof roads, and for other purposes (see Chapters XVII and XIX). In\r\nsome cases these lands have not been used altogether for the\r\npurposes for which they were granted. School lands have sometimes\r\nbeen sold at a nominal price to individuals who have reaped the\r\nprofit, whereas the lands might have been so administered by the\r\nstates as to have brought large returns for educational purposes.\r\nIn some cases, state officials have made unwise investments of the\r\nfunds derived from the sale of the lands, thereby losing them for\r\nthe use of the state.\r\n\r\nLAND MONOPOLY AND TENANTRY\r\n\r\nThe control, or \"monopolizing,\" of the public land by large\r\nholders is said to be one of the causes of increasing tenantry\r\n(Chapter X, p. 116); for as the available supply of desirable\r\nfarming land is diminished, the actual home-seeker is driven to\r\ntake less productive lands, or to purchase from the large holders\r\nat a higher price. The more recent land laws limit the amount of\r\npublic land that an individual may acquire to an area sufficient\r\nto enable him to make a comfortable living for a family (see\r\nabove, p. 199). They also exact from the homesteader an agreement\r\nthat he will actually occupy and cultivate the land.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR LAND FRAUDS\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the defects in our methods of administering\r\nthe public lands rests in part upon our governmental\r\nrepresentatives, who have not always dealt wisely with the\r\nextremely difficult problem. But it rests also upon each\r\nindividual citizen. There are those, be it said to our shame, who\r\ndeliberately seek to defeat the purpose of the laws and to\r\nappropriate to their own selfish uses the lands which belong to\r\nthe nation as a whole. There is one division of the General Land\r\nOffice in Washington known as the Contest Division. Before it\r\ncome, not only the ordinary disputes that are likely to arise\r\nbetween rival claimants, but also cases of alleged fraud and\r\nviolation of the land laws. In the year 1916 MORE THAN 12,000\r\nCASES OF ALLEGED FRAUD WERE ACTED UPON, AND NEARLY 12,000 OTHER\r\nCASES AWAITED ACTION AT THE END OF THE YEAR! But the\r\nresponsibility comes much closer home than this. Many of us who\r\nwould not think of violating the law have failed to appreciate the\r\nvalue of the gifts that nature has given us, and have apparently\r\nbeen \"too busy\" to inform ourselves as to whether or not our\r\npublic lands have been administered solely for the purpose to\r\nwhich Congress devoted them just after the Revolution. This, like\r\nevery other matter of community interest, requires team work.\r\n\r\nThe community has certain rights to a citizen's land that are\r\nclearly recognized as superior to the citizen's rights. Acting\r\nthrough its government, it may take a part of a citizen's property\r\nby taxation (see Chapter XXIII). Taxes are paid in money; but if a\r\ncitizen does not pay the tax upon his land, the government may\r\nsell the land for enough to cover the obligation.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN\r\n\r\nAgain, the government may take a citizen's land for public uses,\r\nif the interests of the community demand it, by what is called the\r\nRIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN. For example, if the interests of the\r\ncommunity demand that a new road be built, the government will\r\nseek to buy the necessary land from the farmers along the line of\r\nthe proposed highway. Some farmer may say that he does not want\r\nthe road to run through his farm, or he may try to get a price\r\nbeyond what his land is worth. The government may then CONDEMN the\r\nrequired land and fix a price despite the farmer's objections. The\r\ncitizen whose land is taken must, however, be paid for it; the\r\nConstitution of the United States protects him by the provision,\r\n\"nor shall private property be taken for public use without just\r\ncompensation\" (Amendment V, last clause).\r\n\r\nThe right of eminent domain may be exercised to secure a site for\r\na schoolhouse, a post-office, an army post, or courthouse, or for\r\nany other public purpose. The government also authorizes\r\ncorporations that perform a public service to exercise the right,\r\nas in the case of railroads which must obtain a right of way for\r\ntheir tracks, and sites for their yards and stations.\r\n\r\nTHE POLICE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nFinally, by the exercise of what is known as the POLICE POWER, the\r\ngovernment may control the use to which a citizen may put his\r\nland. Occasion for the exercise of the police power arises most\r\nfrequently in cities, where it is necessary to control the\r\nconstruction of buildings for fire protection, and to regulate the\r\nkinds of business that may be conducted. In country districts it\r\ndoes not usually make so much difference what a man does on his\r\nown land; but even there the police power may be exercised, as\r\nwhen the state of Idaho passed a law forbidding the herding of\r\nsheep within a certain distance of towns.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL RELATIONS WITH THE LAND\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which government establishes relations\r\nbetween the people and the land. Citizens of the United States\r\nhave certain political rights and duties, such as voting, holding\r\noffice, and paying taxes. These rights may be enjoyed and the\r\nduties performed only within certain districts which the\r\ngovernment creates for this purpose. Thus, a citizen has a right\r\nto vote within the state where he lives, but not in any other\r\nstate. He must cast his vote within his own county, township, and\r\nprecinct. The boundaries of the states are established by the\r\nnational government (except the original thirteen states of the\r\nUnion, whose boundaries were fixed before the national government\r\nwas organized); but they may not be changed afterward without the\r\nconsent of the states affected. The states organize their own\r\ncounties and townships [Footnote: In the public land states the\r\npolitical township usually, but not always, corresponds with the\r\ntownship surveyed by the national government. See pp. 194-196.]\r\nand other districts. Villages and cities are granted definite\r\nboundaries by the state, and organize themselves into wards and\r\nprecincts. There are legislative, congressional, judicial, and\r\nrevenue districts, the boundaries of which are fixed by state and\r\nnational governments. Locally, there are school districts. The\r\nboundaries which separate one nation from another are determined\r\nby agreement, or treaty, between the nations concerned.\r\nUncertainty or indefiniteness in regard to national boundary lines\r\nhas been the cause of much international strife, and was an\r\nimportant factor in the European war begun by Germany in 1914.\r\n\r\nIf you live in a \"public land\" state, for what uses have public\r\nlands been given to the state? Have the school lands in your state\r\nbeen wisely used?\r\n\r\nIs it easy for a young man to acquire a farm in your locality? to\r\nkeep up improvements on a farm that he owns? Has it been easy for\r\na farmer in your locality to borrow money? (Consult parents and\r\nfriends.)\r\n\r\nHave the farmers of your locality made much use of the Federal\r\nFarm Loan Act? Do they think it is a good law?\r\n\r\nHave you heard of forced sales of land in your community to pay\r\ntaxes?\r\n\r\nDo you know of cases of the exercise of the right of eminent\r\ndomain in your community? For what purposes? Was it exercised by\r\nlocal, state, or national government?\r\n\r\nIn what ways does government control the use to which you may put\r\nthe land on which you live?\r\n\r\nIn what township do you live? school district? congressional\r\ndistrict? state legislative district? revenue district?\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nAnnual reports of the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nAnnual reports of the Commissioner of the General Land Office,\r\nDepartment of the Interior, Washington.\r\n\r\nThe General Land Office has published a large wall map showing the\r\nland surveys, the national forests, and many other important\r\nitems. It may be secured from the Superintendent of Documents,\r\nGovernment Printing Office, Washington, for $1.\r\n\r\nSee the New International Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia\r\nAmericana on public lands, national forests, and other topics\r\nreferred to in this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn LESSONS IN COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE:\r\n\r\nSeries A: Lesson 4, What nature has done for a typical city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCONSERVING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nRESOURCES OF THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we learned that as a nation we have not\r\nbeen altogether thrifty in the disposal and use of our public\r\nlands. The same thing will have to be said regarding the use of\r\nthe resources of the land, of which the soil is by far the most\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nIt is said that 1200 boys in Ohio, organized in clubs, increased\r\nthe average yield of corn from 35 bushels to 81 bushels per acre.\r\nThe average returns per acre from the soil of the United States\r\nwere lower before the war than in any European country, except\r\nRussia. The following table gives the production per acre of four\r\ncereals in the United States and five European countries in 1913.\r\nThe same relative position of the United States would be shown if\r\nwe took the average production of these countries for a series of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION IN BUSHELS PER ACRE UNDER CULTIVATION IN 1913\r\n\r\nABILITY OF THE AMERICAN FARMER\r\n\r\nThe low position of the United States in agriculture is by no\r\nmeans due to inferior ability on the part of the American farmer.\r\nThe Secretary of Agriculture says that\r\n\r\nEven now no farmer in the world can compare with the American\r\nfarmer in agricultural efficiency. His adaptability to new and\r\nchanging conditions, to the use of improved machinery and\r\nprocesses, coupled with the great natural resources with which the\r\nnation is endowed, make him far superior to any of his\r\ncompetitors. It is true that he does not produce more per acre\r\nthan the farmers of some other nations. Production per acre,\r\nhowever, is not the American standard. The standard is the amount\r\nof production for each person engaged in agriculture, and by this\r\ntest the American farmer appears to be from two to six times as\r\nefficient as most of his competitors.\r\n\r\nWASTEFULNESS OF EARLY FARMING\r\n\r\nAs long as we had a great abundance of unoccupied land it would\r\nperhaps have been uneconomic to increase the production of that\r\nwhich was occupied by the costly methods of agriculture used in\r\nBelgium, Germany, and other thickly settled countries. But the old\r\nmethods of farming not only failed to get from the soil all that\r\nit was then capable of producing, they also robbed it of fertility\r\nwithout restoring to it what was taken from it. Thus the loss\r\ncaused by wasteful methods was passed on to future generations. To\r\ncontinue such methods in the light of our present knowledge and\r\nwith our growing population is thriftless in the extreme. Methods\r\nof preserving and restoring the fertility of the soil and of\r\nobtaining the largest returns from it are now receiving the most\r\ncareful attention from both state and national governments.\r\n\r\nIDLE LANDS\r\n\r\nA great deal of land lies idle that might be productive of food--\r\nnot only arid, swamp, and cut-over lands, mentioned in later\r\nparagraphs, and land held for speculation, but also vacant lots\r\nand unused back yards in cities and villages, and waste or unused\r\nportions of cultivated farms. It is largely from city and village\r\nlots that the School Garden Army obtained its remarkable results.\r\nIt is astonishing how many farmers buy instead of raising their\r\nvegetables for the table, as well as feed for their stock.\r\n\r\nTexas, for instance, has purchased $200,000,000 worth of food\r\nproducts yearly from northern markets which might have been\r\nproduced more cheaply at home. It takes 15 to 20 acres of land in\r\nTexas to grow cotton enough to buy 160 bushels of canned sweet\r\npotatoes, while one acre of Texas soil would produce the same\r\nquantity, and uncanned. [Footnote: THRIFT, a monograph published\r\nby the National Education Association, 1918.]\r\n\r\nSuch topics as the following should be studied, consulting\r\nparents, farmers of the locality, and such printed sources of\r\ninformation as are available.\r\n\r\nThe important cereal crops of your state.

In 1902 a law known as the Reclamation Act\r\nwas passed by Congress, providing that the proceeds from the sale\r\nof public lands in states containing arid regions,[Footnote: The\r\nstates to which this law applies are Arizona, California,\r\nColorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico,\r\nNorth Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington,\r\nand Wyoming. See map.] except such as were already devoted to\r\neducational and other public purposes, should be used for the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of irrigation works. This reclamation\r\nwork is in charge of the Reclamation Service of the Department of\r\nthe Interior, whose engineers have built great dams and reservoirs\r\nfrom which the water has been led by canals and ditches into the\r\ndesert. By 1916 more than 1,000,000 acres had been irrigated under\r\nthis act, the crop value in that year reaching $35,000,000. The\r\nreclaimed land is disposed of to actual settlers in accordance\r\nwith the homestead laws, each homesteader repaying the government\r\nin annual installments the cost of reclaiming the land he\r\noccupies. The fund so created is used by the government for\r\nfurther reclamation projects. The Department of Agriculture sends\r\nits experts to advise with the farmers in regard to the problems\r\npeculiar to the reclaimed regions. \"Every effort should be and is,\r\ntherefore, being made to promote the success of the farmer, and on\r\nthe basis of his success to increase the prosperity of the\r\ncountry.\" [Footnote 2: Report of the Reclamation Service, 1912-\r\n1913, p. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe Yuma project in Arizona opened a new Valley of the Nile where\r\nfour crops of alfalfa are now raised on what once were arid lands.\r\nThe streets of Yuma and Somerton are crowded with the automobiles\r\nof farmers, enriched by thousands of acres of splendid long-staple\r\ncotton, alfalfa, corn, and feterita. Another irrigated valley in\r\nArizona, that of the Salt River, has few superiors in the world\r\nand has come in three years into great prosperity. Arizona planted\r\nto cotton last year 92,000 acres. Its crop was 96 per cent\r\nperfect, the best record in the United States. [Footnote: Arthur\r\nD. Little, \"Developing the Estate,\" ATLANTIC MONTHLY, March,\r\n1919.]\r\n\r\nThe principal irrigation projects of the Reclamation Service are\r\nshown on the accompanying map.\r\n\r\nRECLAMATION BY STATES AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE\r\n\r\nFive or six times as much arid land has been reclaimed by private\r\nenterprise as by the Reclamation Service. The first extensive\r\nirrigation project in the West was a cooperative enterprise by the\r\nMormon colonists in Utah. It is said that about two fifths of the\r\nland irrigated in the United States is supplied with water by\r\nworks built and controlled by individual farmers or by a few\r\nneighbors, while another one third is supplied by stock companies.\r\nAs early as 1877 Congress passed \"a desert land law,\" by which\r\nhomesteads were granted in the arid lands on condition that the\r\nsettlers should irrigate the land. In 1894 the Carey Act was\r\npassed by Congress under which the national government may give to\r\na state as much as a million acres of arid public land within its\r\nborders, on condition that the state provides for its irrigation.\r\nThe work is done by private stock companies, with whom the state\r\nmakes a contract for the purpose. The most extensive irrigation\r\nproject undertaken by private enterprise is that of the Imperial\r\nValley in California, which derives its water from the Colorado\r\nRiver. Under the laws of California the Imperial Valley region has\r\nbeen organized as an \"irrigation district,\" with power to levy\r\ntaxes for the development and support of the irrigation work. Each\r\nstate in which irrigation is practiced has its own laws regulating\r\nthe use of water by farmers and other consumers.\r\n\r\nThe theory is that the state regulates the appropriation of the\r\nwater, exercising this power and holding the land in trust for the\r\npublic ... It is the duty of every state to which the Reclamation\r\nAct is applicable to assist with every resource under its\r\ncontrol.[Footnote: Water Supply Paper, 234, U.S. Geological\r\nSurvey, Department of the Interior, p. 66.]\r\n\r\nReference has been made in Chapter XIV to the proposed plan for\r\nthe reclamation and settlement of new areas of arid land by\r\nreturning soldiers.\r\n\r\nSWAMP LANDS\r\n\r\nThere are probably 80,000,000 acres of swamp lands in the United\r\nStates which could be made productive by drainage. Farmers\r\nthemselves could reclaim much of this land at comparatively small\r\ncost, greatly increasing their own profit and the wealth of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOne farm in Wisconsin has 40 acres of poorly drained land that in\r\nits present condition is practically worthless. $25.00 per acre\r\nspent in drainage will make this 40-acre tract the equal of any in\r\nthe district, and good land is selling there at $150.00 per acre.\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Unprofitable Acres,\" in YEAR BOOK, Department of\r\nAgriculture, 1915, P. 147.]\r\n\r\nThe national government has at various times granted to the states\r\nswamp lands aggregating 60,000,000 acres, with the expectation\r\nthat the states would reclaim them. The states have, however, done\r\nvery little to fulfill the expectation. These swamp lands are\r\namong those whose reclamation by returning soldiers is proposed by\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on the following topics:\r\n\r\nThe work of the Reclamation Service of the national government.\r\n\r\nIf you live in one of the states to which the Reclamation Act\r\napplies, report on what has been accomplished by it in your state.\r\n\r\nThe development of one of the irrigation projects shown on the\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nIrrigation by private or state enterprise in your state (if any),\r\nand what it has accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of Utah by the Mormons.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Imperial Valley of California.\r\n\r\nThe laws regulating the use of water for irrigation in your state\r\n(if an irrigated state).\r\n\r\nThe swamp areas in your locality or state. Progress made in their\r\nreclamation.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of swamp or marshy land on particular farms of\r\nyour locality.\r\n\r\nThe extent of idle cut-over land in your locality, why it is idle,\r\nthe uses to which it could be put if reclaimed.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION OF WATER POWER\r\n\r\nBy the construction of dams, reservoirs, and canals the waters of\r\na few of our streams are turned to the work of reclaiming land.\r\nOur unused water resources are very great. Niagara Falls have been\r\nharnessed for industrial uses, and with only a small part of their\r\npower in use they light the streets and houses, run the street\r\ncars, and turn the wheels of industry in Buffalo and Toronto and\r\nthe neighboring region. But so far we are making use of less than\r\n10 per cent of the power easily available from our streams. \"The\r\nwater now flowing idly from our hills to the sea could turn every\r\nfactory wheel and every electric generator, operate our railroads,\r\nand still leave much energy to spare for new developments.\"\r\n[Footnote: Arthur D. Little, \"Developing the Estate,\" ATLANTIC\r\nMONTHLY, March, 1919, p. 388.] It is probably not too much to\r\nexpect that when our undeveloped water power is utilized it will\r\nprovide electric light and power for every farm in the land. Our\r\nnation has allowed many of the best water power sites of the\r\ncountry to fall into the hands of private speculators who hold\r\nthem undeveloped, as in the case of farmlands, forests, and other\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION OF FLOOD WATERS\r\n\r\nFloods are not only immensely destructive of property, causing a\r\nloss of $100,000,000 along the Mississippi River alone in a single\r\nyear, but they carry to the sea water that might be used for\r\nirrigation and for industry. Reservoirs, such as are built for\r\nirrigating projects, regulate the flow of water in streams and\r\nprevent floods. In New England and New York reservoirs have been\r\nbuilt for this very purpose, and probably 10 per cent of the flood\r\nwaters that originate in these states is saved in this way and\r\nturned to industrial uses. Similar conservation of flood waters\r\noccurs in Minnesota, but it is estimated that for the country as a\r\nwhole not more than one per cent of the flood waters is saved.\r\n[Footnote: \"Conservation of Water Resources,\" Water Supply Paper\r\n234, U.S. Geological Survey, 1919.] There are areas in which the\r\nreservoir system is impracticable, as in the lower Mississippi\r\nValley. Here all that can be done is to protect the adjacent land\r\nby means of levees while controlling the floods farther up the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nFUEL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nLarger use of water power would conserve another valuable\r\nresource--coal. Of this fuel we have vast resources--\"in West\r\nVirginia alone more than Great Britain and Germany combined.\" But\r\nthe supply is not inexhaustible and we are mining it and using it\r\nin an extravagant manner. The loss here is not merely of heat and\r\npower and light, but of many valuable products of coal, including\r\ndyes, ammonia, vaseline, and many others.\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION BY FLOODS\r\n\r\nFloods are increasing in the United States. This is due chiefly to\r\nthe destruction of our forests by wasteful lumbering and by fire.\r\nIn forested areas the ground absorbs the rainfall more easily,\r\nwhile in areas barren of trees and other vegetation it runs off\r\nthe surface. The destruction of the forests, therefore, involves\r\nnot only the loss of the timber, but also the loss caused by the\r\nfloods, including the washing away of the soil.\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST RESERVES\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Congress authorized the President to establish \"forest\r\nreserves,\" the first to be created being the \"Yellowstone Park\r\nTimberland Reserve.\" From time to time new reserves were\r\nestablished, and in 1907 the name was changed to the National\r\nForests. In 1917, more than 176 million acres were included within\r\nthe National Forest boundaries, 21 million acres of which,\r\nhowever, belonged to private owners. They are administered by the\r\nForest Service of the Department of Agriculture, at the head of\r\nwhich is the Chief Forester. They are grouped in seven districts\r\nwith a district forester in charge of each. Over each of the 150\r\nforests in the seven districts there is a forest supervisor; and\r\neach forest is further subdivided into ranger districts under\r\ndistrict rangers who not only look after timber sales and the use\r\nof the forests generally, but also \"help build roads, trails,\r\nbridges, telephone lines, and other permanent improvements.\"\r\n\r\nA ranger must naturally be sound in body, for he is called upon to\r\nwork for long periods in all kinds of weather. He must also know\r\nhow to pack supplies and find food for himself and his horse in a\r\ncountry where it is often scarce. Besides a written test,\r\nprospective rangers are examined in compass surveying, timber\r\nwork, and the handling of horses. [Footnote: \"Government Forest\r\nWork,\" Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, p. 15.]\r\n\r\nThere are also employed in the Forests great numbers of logging\r\nengineers, lumbermen, scalers, planting assistants, guards, and\r\nothers. In the great war, the Forest Service raised two regiments\r\nof men who went to France to assist in the various kinds of\r\nforestry work necessitated by the war.\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE FOREST SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Forest Service is to secure the use of the\r\nforests \"in such a way that they will yield all their resources to\r\nthe fullest extent without exhausting them, for the benefit\r\nprimarily of the home builder. The controlling policy is serving\r\nthe public while conserving the forests.\" [Footnote: \"The Status\r\nof Forestry in the United States,\" Forest Service Circular 167,\r\n1909, p. 5.] Timber is cut and sold, but always with a view to\r\ndeveloping future growth. The forests are protected against fire.\r\nBurned-over areas are reforested by planting. Water power sites\r\nare protected. The freest possible use of forest pasture land is\r\npermitted, but under such regulations as to prevent injury to the\r\nforests and the denudation of the land by overgrazing. In 1915,\r\nnine million cattle, horses, sheep, and goats were pastured in the\r\nforests. In 1916 it was said that \"more than 20 million dollars\r\nwill probably be spent in the next ten years in building good\r\nroads in the National Forests.\" [Footnote 2: \"Opening up the\r\nNational Forests by Road Building,\" YEAR BOOK of the Department of\r\nAgriculture, 1916. Also reprinted in separate Leaflet No. 696.]\r\n\r\nWASTE OF TIMBER RESOURCES\r\n\r\nBut our timber resources are not all in the National Forests, and\r\nthe waste continues to an appalling extent.\r\n\r\nWith a total annual cut of 40,000,000,000 feet, board-measure, of\r\nmerchantable lumber, another 70,000,000,000 feet are wasted in the\r\nfield and at the mill. In the yellow-pine belt the values in\r\nrosin, turpentine, ethyl alcohol, pine oil, tar, charcoal, and\r\npaper stock lost in the waste are three or four times the value of\r\nthe lumber produced. Enough yellow-pine pulp-wood is consumed in\r\nburners, or left to rot, to make double the total tonnage of paper\r\nproduced in the United States.\r\n\r\nBut the wastes in lumbering, colossal though they are in absolute\r\namount, are trivial compared to the losses which our estate has\r\nsuffered, and still endures, from forest fires. The French\r\nproperly regard as a national calamity the destruction of perhaps\r\na thousand square miles of their fine forests by German shells.\r\nAnd yet the photographs that they show of this wreck and utter\r\ndemolition may be reproduced indefinitely on 10,000,000 acres of\r\nour forest lands swept each year by equally devastating fire for\r\nwhich our own people are responsible. You have doubtless already\r\nforgotten that forest fire which last autumn, in Minnesota, burned\r\nover an area half as large again as Massachusetts, destroying more\r\nthan twenty-five towns, killing 400 people, and leaving 13,000\r\nhomeless. [Footnote: \"Developing the Estate,\" ATLANTIC MONTHLY,\r\nMarch, 1919, pp. 384-385.]\r\n\r\nThe nation has been defrauded of a great deal of wealth in timber\r\nby speculators who have taken advantage of the homestead laws.\r\n\r\nSingle tracts of 160 acres often have a value for the timber alone\r\nof $20,000 ... Lands acquired ... under the guise of the homestead\r\nlaw are to-day in the hands of lumber companies who promptly\r\npurchased them from the settlers as soon as the title passed, and\r\nare either reserving them for later cutting or are holding the\r\nland itself after cutting for from $40 to $60 an acre, or even\r\nmore--a speculative process which effectively prevents the\r\npossibility of men of small means acquiring and establishing homes\r\nthere. [Footnote 2: \"The National Forests and the Farmer,\" in YEAR\r\nBOOK, Department of Agriculture, 1914, p. 70.]\r\n\r\nTo prevent this sort of thing, the government now sells the timber\r\nand the land separately, withholding from agricultural entry\r\nheavily timbered land until the timber is cut off.\r\n\r\nIn the Kaniksy National Forest, in Idaho and Washington, timber\r\nsales have been made to include much of the remaining agricultural\r\ntimberland. Within eight years fully 10,000 acres of land will be\r\nmade available for settlement. Permanent homes will be established\r\nand there will be available for the use of the communities\r\napproximately $225,000 for roads and schools, their share of the\r\nproceeds from the sale of the timber. [Footnote 3: IBID., p. 71.]\r\n\r\nSTATE FORESTS\r\n\r\nBesides the National Forests, there are more than 4,000,000 acres\r\nof STATE FORESTS.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four states have forestry departments, sometimes under a\r\nstate board or a commission, sometimes under the control of a\r\nsingle state forester, as in Massachusetts and Virginia. In New\r\nYork, New Jersey, and Wisconsin the state forestry is a part of\r\nthe work of a general \"conservation commission.\" In Connecticut it\r\nis centered in the state agricultural experiment station, and in\r\nTexas in the agricultural college. In South Dakota the state\r\nforester is under the \"commissioner of schools and public lands.\"\r\nSo there is great variety in the organization of forestry work,\r\nand great variation in the amount and kind of attention given to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPRIVATELY OWNED TIMBERLANDS\r\n\r\nThe difference between the number of states having state forests\r\nand the number having forestry departments is due to the fact that\r\nthe public forests embrace only a small part of the timbered land\r\nof a state. It will be noted from the table on page 225 that only\r\none southern state (North Carolina; two if Maryland is counted)\r\nhas state forests. Six of them (eight with Maryland and Virginia)\r\nhave state forestry departments. More attention is now being given\r\nto forest preservation and use in the South than these facts\r\nindicate, because of cooperation between state and national\r\ngovernments, chiefly through the county agents. Such cooperation\r\nalso exists in the northern states. The map on page 242 shows\r\ncooperation for fire protection in New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTARY PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\nThe conservation of our forest resources requires cooperation on\r\nthe part of citizens. In many states there are \"timberland owners'\r\nfire protective associations,\" in 1917 about fifty of them. There\r\nis an American Forestry Association that publishes a magazine\r\ndevoted to forestry, AMERICAN FORESTRY; a Society of American\r\nForesters; The Camp Fire Club of America, with a committee on\r\nconservation of forests and wild life. Besides, there is a\r\nconsiderable number of local associations with similar purposes.\r\n\r\nEROSION\r\n\r\nIt is not always realized how important to our welfare the forests\r\nare, especially from the point of view of agricultural production.\r\nA very large part of the timbered area of the United States is in\r\nsmall woodlands on privately owned farms. Not only are the timber\r\nresources themselves of great value, but the relation of woodland\r\nto agriculture is very close, especially in its effect upon soil\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nAltogether it has been estimated that erosion is responsible for\r\nan annual loss in this country of approximately $100,000,000. To\r\nthe farmer it means money out of pocket from start to finish. It\r\nimpairs the fertility and decreases the productivity of his land,\r\nand may even ruin it altogether; it renders irrigation more\r\ndifficult and more costly; by reducing the possibilities of cheap\r\nwater power development it tends to keep up the price and check\r\nthe more extended use of electricity; and by interfering with\r\nnavigation it helps to prevent the development of a comprehensive\r\nsystem of cheap inland water transportation. But the farmer is not\r\nthe only sufferer. The entire community is directly affected by\r\nthe loss and is justified in taking heroic measures to remedy the\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nIf the problem is to be solved we must cease to accelerate surface\r\nrun-off by burning the forests and brush fields, overgrazing the\r\nrange, clearing steep slopes for agriculture, and practicing\r\nantiquated methods of cultivation. On the contrary, the farmer,\r\nthe forester, and the stockman must cooperate in seeing that the\r\nland is so used that surface run-off, particularly at the higher\r\nelevations, is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nChildren in particular should have their interest actively aroused\r\nand their support enlisted. In one state, \"gully clubs\" have been\r\norganized by the state forester. These are composed largely of\r\nschool children who take an active part in the work of gully\r\nreclamation and particularly in finding and checking incipient\r\ngullies before it is too late. Why could not such organizations as\r\nboy scouts, girl scouts, and campfire girls be used in the same\r\nway? [Footnote: \"Farms, Forests, and Erosion,\" YEAR BOOK of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, 1916, pp. 107-134.]\r\n\r\nMINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nSoil, water, and forests are only a few of the rich natural\r\nresources of our country, although they are among the most\r\nimportant. Great as the mineral production of our country now is,\r\nwe have only begun to open the mineral storehouse. On the other\r\nhand, we have been extremely wasteful of some of our minerals, as\r\nin the case of natural gas, oil, and coal. The war has done more,\r\nperhaps, than anything else to open our eyes to our mineral wealth\r\nand to convict us of our wastefulness in the past. In the light of\r\nwhat it has shown us we should redouble our efforts to conserve\r\nour resources. Our government has been gradually developing a\r\nprogram of conservation which we should help to make effective. At\r\nthe end of this chapter will be found references to interesting\r\naccounts of our national wealth, and of what the government is\r\ndoing to conserve it in other directions than those described in\r\nthis chapter. Many of these references are to publications issued\r\nby the government itself, which can be obtained for the asking.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on.\r\n\r\nLosses in your state from periodic floods.

The farmer who has every\r\nprospect of a bumper crop after a hard season's work may have his\r\nhope dashed by smut in his grain, or by a visitation of\r\ngrasshoppers, or by storm and flood. Cholera may carry off his\r\nhogs, or hoof-and-mouth disease his cattle. Rats and other rodents\r\nmay eat his grain. Fire may destroy his barn or his home. The\r\nthief may steal his pocketbook or his automobile. His investments\r\nmay prove unfortunate, or be swept away by somebody's bad\r\nmanagement or fraud. Some thoughtless boys or deliberate vandals\r\nmay ruin in a few minutes a beautiful lawn or trees that have\r\ntaken years to grow and have involved great expense and effort.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL LOSS FROM PROPERTY DESTRUCTION\r\n\r\nThe individual's loss is also a loss to the community. It is\r\nreported by the Department of Agriculture that nearly $800,000,000\r\ndamage was done to crops by insects in a single year. Animal\r\ndiseases cause a direct loss to our country estimated at\r\n$212,000,000 annually. Hog cholera alone costs $75,000,000 a year.\r\nSmut destroys more than $50,000,000 a year in cereals. Food and\r\nfeed products to the value of $150,000,000 a year are destroyed by\r\nprairie dogs, ground squirrels, and other rodents. It is said that\r\nprairie dogs often take half the pasturage of western cattle\r\nranges. It is estimated that the killing of wolves, coyotes,\r\nmountain lions, bobcats, and lynxes saved more than $2,000,000\r\nworth of livestock in 1918. Floods have destroyed $100,000,000 in\r\nproperty in the Mississippi Valley alone.\r\n\r\nThe loss from fire in the United States is said to equal the value\r\nof our total product of gold, silver, copper, and petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe buildings consumed by fire in 1914, if placed on lots of 65\r\nfeet frontage, would line both sides of a street extending from\r\nNew York to Chicago. A person journeying along this street of\r\ndesolation would pass in every thousand feet a ruin from which an\r\ninjured person was taken. At every three fourths of a mile in this\r\njourney he would encounter the charred remains of a human being\r\nwho has been burned to death. [Footnote: \"The Fire Tax and Waste\r\nof Structural Materials in the United States,\" Bulletin 814, U. S.\r\nGeological Survey, Department of the Interior.]\r\n\r\nTHE SERVICE OF GOVERMENT\r\n\r\nProtection against loss of property is one of the chief services\r\nperformed for us by our government. We have already noted in\r\nChapter XII what a great deal of work both the national and state\r\ngovernments are doing to prevent loss of crops and of livestock\r\nfrom disease, insects, and other causes. What this may mean to the\r\nindividual farmer and to the country is suggested by the case of a\r\nfarmer who had hundreds of acres of corn destroyed in some manner\r\nunknown to him. A single visit from a representative of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture showed him the cause of the trouble, the\r\ncorn rootworm, and how it could be eradicated by a simple rotation\r\nof crops. The farmer said that this knowledge would save him\r\n$10,000 a year.\r\n\r\nLEADERSHIP AND COOPERATION\r\n\r\nThe state and national governments spend a great deal of money in\r\nequipping experimental laboratories and employing scientists to\r\nseek out these enemies of the farmer and of the nation, to find\r\nmethods of destroying them or counteracting their effects, and to\r\nadvise the farmer how he may protect himself and his neighbors.\r\nWhile the government provides leadership in these matters, it\r\ndepends upon the cooperation of the people to get results, as we\r\nhave seen in so many cases. A farmer may destroy all the rats, or\r\nground squirrels, or prairie dogs on his place, but the trouble\r\nwill be repeated unless there is community cooperation. The same\r\nthing is true of animal and plant diseases, insect enemies, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nFurther facts regarding losses to farmers of the United States due\r\nto insect and bird enemies, predatory animals, animal and plant\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nSimilar losses in your own state.\r\n\r\nEstimated losses of individual farmers in your locality from any\r\nof these causes.\r\n\r\nThe value of insect-eating birds as property savers.\r\n\r\nCampaigns against rabbits and prairie dogs in the West.\r\n\r\nBounties on wolves and other predatory animals in your state.\r\n\r\nThe work of your state experiment station to prevent loss of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL COOPERATION FOR FLOOD PREVENTION\r\n\r\nSome kinds of protection require effort beyond the powers of\r\nindividual citizens, or even of combined citizen action. This is\r\nthe case with flood protection. Millions of dollars in property\r\nhave been destroyed, thousands of lives lost, and untold suffering\r\ncaused by the periodic recurrence of floods in certain sections of\r\nthe country, as in the lower Mississippi Valley, or as in Ohio, a\r\nfew years ago. The individual farmer has some responsibility for\r\nsuch floods, because by looking after his own drainage and\r\npreserving his own timberland he may help decrease the amount of\r\nwater that flows into the streams and ultimately causes such havoc\r\nfarther down the valley. But such efforts are helpful only in\r\nconnection, with the larger efforts of the government. Even state\r\ngovernments cannot alone control the floods, because the waters\r\nthat cause damage in Louisiana and Mississippi come from the\r\nstates along the entire course of the Mississippi River and its\r\ntributaries. Moreover, the destruction caused in Louisiana or any\r\nother state is a loss to the entire nation. The control of floods\r\nrequires the combined efforts of national and state governments,\r\nas well as of local communities and individuals.\r\n\r\nLevees have been built along some of our rivers that are subject\r\nto flood, notably the lower Mississippi, where the work has been\r\ndone by the joint action of the states affected, through their\r\nlocal levee boards and their state boards of engineers, and the\r\nUnited States Mississippi River Commission. The United States\r\ngovernment has spent large sums for river improvements, but there\r\nis a general feeling that the money has not always been wisely\r\nspent. At all events the work has been restricted to navigable\r\nstreams under the power of the national government to regulate\r\ninterstate commerce. Recently, however, the President has approved\r\na law passed by Congress appropriating $45,000,000 for the control\r\nof the floods of the Mississippi by improvements from the\r\nheadwaters of the river to the mouth of the Ohio. The law also\r\nincludes the appropriation of $5,000,000 for the protection of the\r\nSacramento Valley in California. This law was passed under the\r\npower given to Congress by the Constitution \"to lay and collect\r\ntaxes...for the common defense and general welfare of the United\r\nStates\" (Art. I, sec. 8, clause i).\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU\r\n\r\nGreat saving of property has been effected by the United States\r\nWeather Bureau. The work of this Bureau is wonderful, but it is\r\nnot mysterious. Just as the movements of a ship or of a railroad\r\ntrain may be reported day by day, and hour by hour, by telegraph,\r\nso the appearance and movement of a storm center or of a cold wave\r\nor of a flood are reported from a multitude of observing stations.\r\nThere are central weather-forecasting stations at Chicago, New\r\nOrleans, Denver, San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and Washington,\r\nD.C. Weather forecasts are made up at these points from\r\nobservations telegraphed in from observing stations, and within\r\ntwo hours are telegraphed to about 1600 distributing stations,\r\nfrom which they are further distributed to about 90,000 mail\r\naddresses daily, to all newspapers, and are made available to\r\n5,500,00 x3 telephone subscribers. A farmer may call central by\r\ntelephone and learn with remarkable certainty what the weather for\r\ntwenty-four hours will be, except in the case of local thunder\r\nshowers which may drench his fields while passing by those of his\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\n\"It may be said without exaggeration that the San Francisco office\r\nof the Weather Bureau has saved to the citrus fruit growers of\r\nCalifornia more money within the last five years than the annual\r\nappropriation for the entire Bureau during a period of twenty\r\nyears.\" \"In the citrus fruit districts of California it is\r\nreported that fruit to the value of $14,000,000 was saved...\r\nduring one cold wave.\" \"The value of the orange bloom, vegetables,\r\nand strawberries protected and saved on a single night in a\r\nlimited district in Florida...was reported at over $100,000.\" \"The\r\nwarnings issued for a single cold wave... resulted in saving over\r\n$3,500,000 through the protection of property.\" \"Signals displayed\r\nfor a single hurricane are known to have detained in port on our\r\nAtlantic coast vessels valued with their cargoes at over\r\n$30,000,000.\" Flood warnings are sent in from about 60 centers\r\nalong our rivers, enabling farmers to remove their cattle from\r\nbottom lands, to save their crops when they are ready for cutting,\r\nand otherwise to determine their farming operations. They are also\r\nof the greatest service to railroads, business men, and home\r\nowners, in cities. These are but a few illustrations of the\r\nservices performed by the Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe building of levees in your state. Where, by whom, their value.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money spent in your state for river improvement (or\r\nharbor improvement).\r\n\r\nHow the Weather Bureau forecasts the weather, storms, floods.\r\n\r\nHow to read a weather map.\r\n\r\nExperiences of individual farmers of their locality with regard to\r\nbenefits derived from the Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nHow a merchant in your town may be benefited by the Weather\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\nThe losses in your state and locale from frost.\r\n\r\nPreventable Losses\r\n\r\nA great deal of the property loss referred to is due to causes for\r\nwhich we are not responsible, such as storms, the depredations of\r\ninsects, and epidemics of animal disease. But some of it is due to\r\nour own carelessness. It was said on page 176 that wastefulness is\r\nour chief national sin. Carelessness is the twin sister of\r\nwastefulness; they go hand in hand. Enormous waste is caused by\r\nfire, and most fires are due to carelessness--carelessness in\r\nhandling matches, in the use of oil stoves, in accumulations of\r\nrubbish, in disposing of hot ashes, in smoking where there are\r\ninflammable materials.\r\n\r\nFire Protection in Cities\r\n\r\nIn cities and towns the safety of our own property from fire is\r\nlargely dependent upon the care of others. If our neighbor is\r\ncareless, our property as well as his may be destroyed. Under such\r\ncircumstances it is necessary to have rules to regulate conduct\r\nfor the common safety. The materials with which we may build, the\r\nthickness of our walls, the construction of our flues, the storage\r\nof explosive or inflammable materials, the disposal of rubbish and\r\nashes, and many other things, are regulated by law. This is\r\ncooperation for fire prevention. Much money is also spent by\r\ncities for fire protection, including water supply and organized\r\nfire departments.\r\n\r\nFIRE PROTECTION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nWhere people live widely separated from one another, as in rural\r\ncommunities, such regulations are less necessary and organized\r\nfire protection is less easy to afford. A farmer's property may be\r\ndestroyed by fire from a spark from a passing locomotive, or from\r\nthe camp of a careless hunter in the adjoining woods. There may be\r\nstate laws to control such cases. But in the main, if his property\r\nburns it is due to the carelessness of some one who lives on the\r\npremises, and he is dependent upon his own efforts to control the\r\nfire. Improved farm water supply with adequate pumping facilities,\r\nthe telephone by which neighbors may be summoned, and the\r\nautomobile by which help may quickly be brought, have increased\r\nthe farmer's safety; but his chief safeguard is the exercise of\r\ncare by all who live on the farm at every point where a fire might\r\npossibly be started.\r\n\r\nFIRE INSURANCE\r\n\r\nFire insurance is a means of reducing the fire loss of individual\r\nproperty owners by a form of cooperation. Insurance companies,\r\noperating under state laws, sell insurance to property owners. The\r\nlatter pay a small premium for the protection afforded. From the\r\nfunds produced by the premiums and the interest on their\r\ninvestment, the occasional losses of individuals are paid. This\r\ndoes not prevent the destruction of the property, but it\r\ndistributes the loss among thousands of people, perhaps in all\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nFARMERS' COOPERATIVE INSURANCE\r\n\r\nThere are in the United States about 2000 FARMERS' COOPERATIVE\r\nFIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES, carrying insurance amounting to more\r\nthan 5 billion dollars. These companies are associations of\r\nfarmers who elect their own directors and manage their own\r\ninsurance business. They provide insurance at a much lower rate\r\nthan the ordinary commercial insurance companies. A usual\r\nprovision of the laws under which these cooperative companies\r\noperate is that no member may insure his property for its full\r\nvalue. His neighbors will help him bear his loss, but will not\r\nbear it all. This has the effect of causing him to exercise\r\ngreater care to prevent fire on his premises. For this reason\r\ninsurance does reduce the actual fire loss to some extent.\r\nProperty may also be insured against loss from storm and flood.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nFire losses in your community in a year.\r\n\r\nCauses of fires in your community last year.

The enforcement of\r\nthese laws is left largely in the hands of local community\r\nofficers. Cities have police departments, with large numbers of\r\npatrolmen and detectives whose business it is not only to arrest\r\nviolators of the law after the violation has taken place, but also\r\nby their vigilance to prevent the violation from occurring.\r\n\r\nRURAL POLICE PROTECTION\r\n\r\nThe state laws against the violation of property rights apply to\r\nrural communities as well as to cities, and rural communities have\r\nofficers for their enforcement--the constable in townships, the\r\nsheriff and his deputies in counties. Where the population is\r\nsmall and widely scattered, as in a rural township or county,\r\nabout all the officers can do is to arrest law violators after the\r\ncommission of the unlawful act, if they can be found. The officers\r\nare too few to watch isolated and remote property, and in case of\r\nserious disturbance, such as a riot, they are too few to handle\r\nthe situation effectively. Rural communities and many small\r\nindustrial or mining communities do not always have the protection\r\nthey need against lawlessness. In such cases the tendency is\r\nsometimes for the people to \"take the law in their own hands.\" In\r\ntimes of labor trouble mining companies and other industrial\r\ncorporations have sometimes organized their own police. Such\r\npractice is dangerous, for the enforcement of law should be in the\r\nhands of the state, and not in the hands of an interested party.\r\nIn early days on the frontier, in mining and lumber camps,\r\n\"vigilance committees\" were common; and even now, in various\r\nlocalities, we hear too frequently of \"lynching parties,\" which\r\nare as lawless as the original offenders against the law, and tend\r\nto create a disrespect for law.\r\n\r\nAnd yet disrespect for law may also result from failure on the\r\npart of the community to enforce the law through regular agencies,\r\nfrom failure of officers to apprehend offenders promptly, or of\r\ncourts to mete out justice promptly and impartially.\r\n\r\nSTATE POLICE Canada has been more efficient than the United States\r\nin affording protection to remote and rural communities, by means\r\nof her national mounted police. \"The isolated farmer and his wife\r\nslept securely in their sod hovel beyond the frontier, because\r\nthey knew that a brave and swift corps of vigilant young athletes ...\r\nkept sleepless vigil. Life and property were secure ... .\"\r\n[Footnote: C.R. Henderson, \"Rural Police,\" ANNALS American Academy\r\nof Political and Social Science, 1912, p. 228.] In our own country\r\nTexas has her \"rangers\" who protect her borders against raids; but\r\nthe best example of rural policing in the United States is in\r\nPennsylvania, where there is a well-organized state police, or\r\n\"constabulary,\" which has many times proved its efficiency in\r\nprotecting remote rural communities and homes, in bringing\r\ncriminals to justice, and in quelling riots in mining centers.\r\n\r\nVANDALISM\r\n\r\nA great deal of property is destroyed or injured by VANDALS. The\r\noriginal Vandals were a tribe of Germanic peoples who invaded\r\nsouthern and western Europe in the Middle Ages, and who were noted\r\nfor their destructiveness of the beautiful buildings and other\r\nevidences of Roman civilization. There seem to be vandals in\r\nalmost every community, and sometimes they seem to be especially\r\nnumerous in small communities, perhaps because of the lack of\r\npolice protection. Sometimes vandalism is wanton,--that is, it\r\nresults from an apparent love of being destructive. Most often it\r\nis purely thoughtless. Few people would knowingly injure the\r\nproperty of another if they would stop to think of their feelings\r\nif another should injure THEIR property. It is a case of \"bad\r\nmanners.\" Moreover, it is not a \"square deal\" to injure another's\r\nproperty while expecting one's own property to be secure. When\r\nvandalism occurs in a community it creates a general feeling of\r\ninsecurity and destroys the sense of freedom.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC PROPERTY is often more likely to suffer from vandalism than\r\nprivate property. Some people will mar the walls of public\r\nbuildings, or make their floors filthy with expectoration, when\r\nthey would not think of doing so in private buildings. They will\r\nbreak shrubbery in public parks, or despoil public flower beds,\r\nwhen they would not think of entering private premises for such\r\npurpose. There seems to be a feeling that public property belongs\r\nto no one, or else that, since it is public, any one is at liberty\r\nto do as he pleases with it. This, of course, is foolish. It is as\r\nif a stockholder in a business corporation should injure or\r\ndestroy the corporation property, forgetting that he owned a share\r\nin it and suffered a share of the loss.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nOrganization of police protection in your community.\r\n\r\nOrganization of a police department in a large city.\r\n\r\nThe Mounted Police of Canada and their work.\r\n\r\nThe Texas rangers.\r\n\r\nThe state police of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nVigilance committees in frontier towns of former times.\r\n\r\nWhy lynching is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe promptness with which justice is meted out in the courts of\r\nyour state.\r\n\r\nThe extent and causes of vandalism in your community.\r\n\r\nIs vandalism justifiable on Halloween?\r\n\r\nInspect the courthouse and other public buildings in your\r\ncommunity and report as to whether they are disfigured in any way.\r\n\r\nTHE SACREDNESS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS\r\n\r\nWhen a thief or vandal takes or destroys another person's\r\nproperty, the loss of the property is not the worst thing that\r\nhappens, but the attack upon PROPERTY RIGHTS. The right to\r\nsecurity in one's possessions is among the most sacred rights of a\r\nfree people, being classed with the right to life, the right of\r\nfree speech, the right of petition, the right to freedom of\r\nreligion. It is by securing these rights that the law makes us\r\nfree. The sacred right to property is as truly violated by one who\r\nsteals a nickel as by one who robs a bank of a thousand dollars,\r\nby one who ruins our flower bed as well as by one who burns our\r\nhouse. The amount has nothing to do with it. The tax which the\r\nEnglish government imposed on tea imported by the American\r\ncolonists was not a heavy tax, but the colonists objected because\r\nit was imposed without their consent.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF PROPERTY RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe citizens of a free country require protection of their\r\nproperty rights against infringement by their government as well\r\nas by one another. The Revolutionary War was fought in defense of\r\nthis and other rights against violation by the English government.\r\nWhen the Constitution of the United States was framed, the people\r\nrefused to ratify it unless amendments were added guaranteeing\r\nthese rights. Thus it was provided that \"no soldier shall, in time\r\nof peace, be quartered in any house without the consent of the\r\nowner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by\r\nlaw\" (Amendment III); that \"the right of the people to be secure\r\nin their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated ...\"\r\n(Amendment IV); that \"no persons shall be ... deprived of life,\r\nliberty or property, without due process of law; nor shall private\r\nproperty be taken for public use without just compensation\"\r\n(Amendment V. See also Chapter XIV, p. 207). The Constitution also\r\nprovides that \"no state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the\r\nobligation of contracts\" (Art. I, sec. 10, clause I), and in\r\nvarious other ways protects our property rights. Our state\r\nconstitutions contain many similar provisions. Our governments\r\nhave the power to take property in the form of taxes, but under\r\ncertain restrictions imposed by our constitutions to safeguard the\r\nrights of the people (see Chapter XXIII).\r\n\r\nOUR NATIONAL ARMY\r\n\r\nIt is to protect these RIGHTS, rather than property itself, that\r\ncommunities have their police, that states have their militia, and\r\nthat the nation has its army and its navy. Among the chief causes\r\nthat led us into war with Germany was the fact that Germany was\r\nviolating the property rights of our citizens. While our\r\nConstitution provides for state militia and a national army for\r\nthe defense of our rights, property rights included, it has always\r\nbeen our national policy to maintain as small a standing army as\r\nis consistent with the national safety; and this for the very\r\nreason that a large standing army and a large navy are not only a\r\ngreat burden of expense, but also, as the founders of our nation\r\nbelieved, a menace to the liberties of the people and to the peace\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nTHE SERVICE OF THE COURTS\r\n\r\nWe have seen that no person may be deprived of property by the\r\ngovernment \"without due process of law.\" This means that the\r\nprocedure provided by law must be followed, and that the citizen\r\nwhose property is taken may have his side of the case presented,\r\nthe value of the property in question appraised by impartial\r\njudges, and so on. It is the business of THE COURTS to see that\r\njustice is done. They inquire into the facts in the case, and\r\ninterpret the law bearing on it. The courts are the final\r\nsafeguard to our liberties. Our government comprises, therefore,\r\nnot only a law-making branch and a law-enforcing branch, but also\r\na LAW-INTERPRETING, OR JUDICIAL, branch--the courts.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF ACCUSED PERSONS\r\n\r\nThe Constitution guarantees justice to persons accused of\r\nviolating the property rights, or other rights of citizens, by\r\ntheft, fraud, or otherwise, as well as to the citizen who has been\r\nwronged. \"In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the\r\nright to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the\r\nState and district wherein the crime shall have been committed ...\r\nand to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to\r\nbe confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory\r\nprocess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the\r\nassistance of counsel for his defense\" (Amendment VI). \"Excessive\r\nbail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel\r\nand unusual punishments inflicted\" (Amendment VIII).\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nHow are property rights guaranteed in your state constitution? in\r\nthe national Constitution?\r\n\r\nRead the charges made in the Declaration of Independence against\r\nthe King of England with respect to the violation of property\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\"Due process of law.\"\r\n\r\nThe violation of property rights by Germany as a cause for war.\r\n\r\nAre property rights as sacred in time of war as in time of peace?\r\n\r\nWhat property rights has an American in Mexico?\r\n\r\nWhat property rights has a Mexican in the United States?\r\n\r\nWhat became of German property in the United States during the\r\nwar?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the courts.\r\n\r\nWhat courts exist in your community?\r\n\r\nThe rights of a person accused of crime.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nIn the Year Book of the Department of Agriculture:\r\n\r\n1910, pp. 413-424, Fire prevention and control on the national\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n1913, pp. 75-92, Bringing applied entomology to the farmer.\r\n\r\n1915, pp. 159-172, Animal disease and our food supply.\r\n\r\n1915, pp. 263-272, Recent grasshopper outbreaks and methods of\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n1916, pp. 217-226, Suppression of gypsy and brown-tailed moths.\r\n\r\n1916, pp. 267-272, Cooperative work for eradicating citrus canker.\r\n\r\n1916, pp. 381-398, Destroying rodent pests on the farm.\r\n\r\n1918, pp. 303-316, Federal protection of migratory birds.\r\n\r\nFarmers' mutual fire insurance, U.S. Department of Agriculture\r\nBulletin No. 530; also, Year Book, 1916, pp. 421-434.\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau (a pamphlet), Government Printing Office,\r\nWashington.

[Footnote:\r\nSpotsylvania, Dinwiddie, Lee, and Wise counties in Virginia;\r\nFranklyn County in New York; Dallas County in Alabama; Lauderdale\r\nCounty in Mississippi; and Manatee County in Florida.] The results\r\nof the investigation are described in Bulletin No. 393 (1916) of\r\nthe Department of Agriculture, which is worth sending for and\r\nstudying by any school that is interested in the improvement of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nSPOTSYLVANIA COUNTY, VA\r\n\r\nOne of these counties was Spotsylvania County, Virginia, a map of\r\nwhich is shown on the opposite page. Since the Civil War the\r\nfarmland in this county had gradually declined from its prosperous\r\ncondition before the war until it was little better than a\r\nwilderness of second-growth timber, valued at from $5 to $15 an\r\nacre. For many months of the year the roads were well-nigh\r\nimpassable. There was much wealth in timber, but it could not be\r\nmarketed to advantage. The soil was very little cultivated. More\r\nfarm products were shipped into Fredericksburg, the only city in\r\nthe county, by rail from outside than were shipped out from the\r\nfarms of the county.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nNearly one third of the population of the county lived in\r\nFredericksburg; but under the law of the state of Virginia the\r\npeople of the city could not be taxed for county purposes outside\r\nof the city. Moreover, two of the four districts of the county at\r\nfirst took little interest in the matter of road improvement,\r\nalthough they had to use the roads in going to market at\r\nFredericksburg. Courtland and Chancellor districts, however, were\r\ndetermined to have better roads, and voted to raise the necessary\r\nmoney by selling bonds to the amount of $100,000. Three years\r\nlater the other two districts, inspired by the success of\r\nCourtland and Chancellor districts, also voted bonds for road\r\nimprovement to the amount of $73,000. This debt would of course\r\nhave to be paid off by levying taxes upon the people of the\r\ndistricts. With a tax rate of $1.70 on every hundred dollars'\r\nworth of property, a farmer with a farm assessed at $3000 would\r\npay a total tax of $51, of which $19.48 would be for the roads.\r\n\r\nCOST MUST BE JUSTIFIED\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to convince the people of a community that\r\nit is worth while to spend so much money on their roads. They have\r\nto be shown that the expenditure will in due time pay for itself,\r\nas well as add to the convenience and pleasure of the community.\r\nToo much money spent in costly improvements on roads that are\r\nlittle used, or in construction that does not stand the traffic\r\nand soon wears out, is of course a bad investment. But the results\r\nin Spotsylvania County, as well as in the seven other counties\r\nstudied by the Office of Public Roads, justified the cost.\r\n\r\nSTATE AND LOCAL COOPERATION\r\n\r\nThe law of Virginia provided that all highway construction in the\r\nstate must be supervised by the STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSIONER. He\r\naccordingly appointed an engineer to supervise the work in\r\nSpotsylvania County, the engineer's salary being paid by the\r\nstate. The work of construction, however, was under the direction\r\nof a COUNTY BOARD OF PUBLIC ROADS. The board appointed a\r\nsuperintendent who hired all labor and teams and purchased all\r\nequipment and materials. Three main highways in Courtland and\r\nChancellor districts, and leading into Fredericksburg, were chosen\r\nfor improvement. Within two years more than forty miles of road\r\nwere completed, or about 10 per cent of all the roads in the\r\nentire county.\r\n\r\nMONEY FOR REPAIRS\r\n\r\nRoads have to be kept in repair after they are constructed. By\r\n1914 money was needed for this purpose. The farmers objected to\r\nfurther increase of the tax rate, so it was decided to charge\r\nTOLLS for the use of the improved highways--5 cents for a single\r\nhorse and vehicle, 10 cents for two horses and a buggy, 15 cents\r\nfor two horses and a wagon, 25 cents for four horses and a wagon,\r\nand from 20 cents to 35 cents for automobiles. More money than was\r\nneeded was raised in this way in the first month, and the tolls\r\nwere therefore reduced one half. One advantage to the county of\r\nthe toll system was that automobilists and others from other\r\ndistricts, counties, and states would contribute to the upkeep of\r\nthe roads.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF IMPROVEMENTS ON LAND VALUES\r\n\r\nOn the roads selected for improvement there were 35 farms\r\nincluding 5518 acres. In 1910, the average value of these farms,\r\nincluding buildings, was $14 per acre, and seldom did any one want\r\nto buy land in the neighborhood. But within two years after the\r\nroad improvement seven of the 35 farms had been sold, and a large\r\npart of another, as shown in the following:\r\n\r\nIn the next two or three years a number of other farms were sold\r\nat similar increased prices, and some farms that had been\r\nabandoned were reoccupied. Large areas of land were cultivated for\r\nthe first time since the Civil War. The farmers were, however,\r\nmost interested for the time being in their timber wealth, and\r\nbetween 1909 and 1913 the shipments of forest products from\r\nFredericksburg increased 78.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nTHE AVERAGE HAUL\r\n\r\nBefore the improvement of the roads, the average weight of load\r\nfor a two-horse team in the winter and spring, when the roads were\r\nbad, was about 1200 pounds; when the roads were dry, about 2400\r\npounds. The cost for hauling at this rate averaged, for the year\r\nround, about 30 cents per ton per mile. After the roads were\r\nimproved, the average load the year round was 4000 pounds, and the\r\ncost for hauling only 15 cents per ton per mile.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nResults of road improvement in others of the eight counties\r\nreferred to on page 248 (see Bulletin 393, 1916, Department of\r\nAgriculture).\r\n\r\nProcure or make a map of your county showing road improvement. Is\r\nyour county well provided with improved roads?\r\n\r\nDo the cities and towns in your county contribute to the\r\nimprovement of the country roads?\r\n\r\nDo the people of the rural districts of your county contribute to\r\nthe improvement of the streets of the cities and towns?\r\n\r\nBond issues in your county for road improvement.

How does\r\nthis cost compare with the cost in neighboring counties and\r\nstates?\r\n\r\nRelation of land values in your county to the character of the\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nMONEY VALUE OF GOOD ROADS\r\n\r\nGood roads pay, in dollars and cents, provided they are made of\r\nsuitable materials and with due regard to the kind and amount of\r\ntraffic they are to carry. They permit of larger loads, and more\r\nloads in a given time; they save wear and tear on horses, harness,\r\nwagons, and automobiles; in the case of automobiles they save\r\ngasoline; they save the time of the farmer; they make possible a\r\nmore varied agriculture by making marketing easier; they add to\r\nthe value of the land.\r\n\r\nGOOD ROADS AND COMMUNITY LIFE\r\n\r\nBut good roads pay in many other ways than in dollars and cents.\r\nIn Spotsylvania County, as in other counties investigated at the\r\nsame time, the improvement of the roads was followed by a decided\r\nimprovement in school attendance. In more than one case it led to\r\nthe improvement of the quality of the schools by the consolidation\r\nof a number of poor, one-room schoolhouses into a single larger\r\nschool with better equipment and better teachers (see Chapter\r\nXIX). The relation between good roads and good schools is clearly\r\nsuggested in one of the illustrations in this chapter. So, also,\r\ngood roads increase the ease with which the people of the\r\ncommunity may associate with one another, attend church or\r\ncommunity meetings at the schoolhouse, and enjoy the social life\r\nand entertainment of the neighboring city or village. When the\r\nroad is improved, the farmers along the way are more likely to\r\nkeep the weeds cut, to repair broken fences or build new ones, and\r\notherwise to beautify the adjoining premises, which adds both to\r\nthe money value of property and to the enjoyment of life.\r\n\r\nROAD MAKING A COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISE\r\n\r\nRoad making is necessarily a cooperative enterprise. In the first\r\nplace, a public road serves the common interest of the entire\r\ncommunity. The community may, through its government, exercise the\r\nRIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN, taking land from adjacent farms for the\r\npurpose of laying out a new road, provided, of course, that the\r\nfarmers are paid for it. In the second place, the making of a road\r\nis far too costly and difficult for an individual farmer to\r\nundertake for the benefit he himself would derive from it. It\r\nrequires a great deal of labor and a high degree of technical\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nROAD MAKING A JOB FOR EXPERTS\r\n\r\nIt has been quite common for farmers themselves to work on the\r\nroads of their locality--\"working out\" their road taxes. But roads\r\nso made are seldom very good, unless the work is supervised by\r\nsomeone trained in the business. Whether a farmer works on the\r\nroads himself or merely pays for having it done, it is to his\r\nadvantage to know something about road making. The Department of\r\nAgriculture and the state agricultural colleges now give extension\r\ncourses in road making for the benefit of the farmers. It is\r\nreported that in one county of Oklahoma the pupils of forty\r\ndifferent school districts have built more than forty miles of\r\ngood roads, of course working under supervision.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF COUNTRY ROADS TO CITIES\r\n\r\nGood country roads are of the greatest importance, not only to the\r\nfarmers and rural communities, but also to the people of cities.\r\nThe road improvement in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, was of as\r\nmuch benefit to the people and the business of Fredericksburg as\r\nto the farmers. An excellent illustration of the recognition of\r\nthe common interest of city and country in the public roads, and\r\nof effective cooperation in improving them, was given in Chapter\r\nIII, page 32, in the case of Christian County, Kentucky. The wide\r\nuse of the automobile has done a great deal to awaken the people\r\nof cities to their interest in country roads, and associations and\r\njournals devoted to the interests of automobilists have been\r\nactive in advocating the improvement of the public highways.\r\n\r\nGOOD ROADS NOT MERELY OF LOCAL CONCERN\r\n\r\nIn Spotsylvania County we saw, also, that the improvement of roads\r\nin two districts was a direct advantage to the farmers of the\r\nother two districts. Carrying this idea further, we shall see that\r\nthe roads of one county may be of the greatest importance to other\r\ncounties in the state; and those of one state of importance to\r\nother states. The crossties produced from the timber of\r\nSpotsylvania County may be wanted for railroad building in a\r\ndistant state. The cotton from the plantations of Tennessee or\r\nTexas is needed at the mills in New England. The wheat of the\r\ngreat farms of the northwest supplies the whole nation. Most of\r\nthe freight carried on the railroads and steamships has at some\r\ntime and in some form been hauled in wagons and trucks over\r\ncountry roads. It is clear, then, that the character of the\r\nhighways in any locality is a matter of national interest, and\r\neven of world-wide interest.\r\n\r\nEARLY NATIONAL INTEREST IN ROAD BUILDING\r\n\r\nWhen our nation was created, the question of highways at once\r\nbecame very important. The states needed to be bound together, and\r\nthe public lands must be settled. The Constitution gave Congress\r\nthe power \"to establish post offices and post roads,\" and \"to\r\nregulate commerce ... among the several states\"; but it was not\r\nclear how far these powers could be exercised for \"internal\r\nimprovements.\" Roads and canals were proposed in great numbers. In\r\n1806 Congress authorized the building of the Cumberland Road,\r\nwhich began at Cumberland, Md., and was finally completed as far\r\nwest as Illinois. Road building was, however, left chiefly to the\r\nstates and to private enterprise. The Cumberland Road finally\r\npassed under the control of the states through which it ran, and\r\nby them was given into the management of the counties. Many\r\n\"turnpikes\" were built by private companies, which charged tolls\r\nfor their use.\r\n\r\nPOOR ROADS IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nThe building of many canals and, later, the coming of railroads\r\ncaused interest in public highways to decline, and their building\r\nwas left almost wholly to local initiative, where it remained\r\nuntil very recently. The result is that the United States has had\r\nthe poorest roads in the civilized world. Under local management\r\nthe cost of public roads fell chiefly upon the farmers, cities\r\nescaping taxation for this purpose, except for their own streets.\r\nA road running across a state might be well kept in some\r\nlocalities while allowed to run down in others. A community was\r\nreluctant to spend money on a highway only to have the\r\nimprovements destroyed by through traffic from neighboring\r\ncommunities who had no responsibility for maintaining the road.\r\nLocal communities could not afford to employ expert officials to\r\nplan and supervise road construction.\r\n\r\nSTATE CONTROL OF HIGHWAYS\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the road situation became so bad that\r\npublic sentiment was gradually aroused on the subject, and it was\r\nseen that a road was of more than merely local importance. State\r\ncontrol was agitated. New Jersey was the first state to pass a law\r\nplacing the highways within the state under state regulation. This\r\nwas in 1891. Other states followed New Jersey's example, until by\r\n1914 forty-two states had state highway departments. These differ\r\ngreatly from one another in organization, powers, and efficiency.\r\nUnfortunately, \"political influence\" has entered into road\r\nbuilding and management in many states in such a way as to\r\ninterfere with efficiency;--that is, those in charge of roads have\r\noften been chosen for political reasons rather than for their\r\nfitness for the work, and large sums of money have been spent\r\nunwisely, if not dishonestly in some cases.\r\n\r\nRECENT PROGRESS UNDER STATE CONTROL\r\n\r\nIn a number of states, STATE HIGHWAYS have been built. These are\r\nwholly state enterprises, paid for and managed by the state.\r\nCalifornia has two trunk lines running the entire length of the\r\nstate, with branch lines connecting them with the county seats. To\r\nJanuary 1, 1914, Massachusetts had completed more than 1000 miles\r\nof state highways. New York has an extensive system, and Maryland\r\nis another example. But the plan most commonly in use is state aid\r\nand supervision in the construction of roads by counties. This was\r\nthe New Jersey plan of 1891. By it, plans for road improvement\r\nwith state aid in any county must be approved by the state highway\r\ndepartment, and construction is supervised by state engineers. The\r\ncost is divided between the state and the local community.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey the property owners along the highway, who of course\r\nare most directly benefited, were to pay one-tenth of the cost,\r\nthe state one-third, and the county the remainder. In Wisconsin,\r\nthe board of county commissioners in each county is required to\r\nplan a \"county system\" of highways to be a part of the state\r\nsystem. The cost of each county system is divided equally among\r\ntownship, county, and state. The work is directed by a county\r\nhighway commissioner, but in accordance with plans and\r\nspecifications of the state highway commission. In Ohio, a system\r\nof \"intercounty highways\" is being built, connecting all the\r\ncounty seats of the state. Counties, towns, and property owners\r\nalong the highway must provide an amount equal to that provided by\r\nthe state, and the work is under the direction of the state\r\nhighway department.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the cost of highway construction is divided equally\r\nbetween state and local communities; but the counties often accept\r\nfrom the state the labor of prison convicts instead of money.\r\nConvict labor on the roads is quite common in southern states.\r\n\r\nThe money for state aid in highway building is commonly raised by\r\nthe sale of bonds by the state. For the maintenance of the roads\r\nafter they are built, the proceeds from automobile licenses are\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nOur roads, even in remote rural districts, are of national\r\nimportance for the reasons stated on page 259. Moreover, they are\r\nbecoming more and more used for the transportation of freight and\r\npassengers over long distances, for which the introduction of the\r\nautomobile and the motor truck is responsible. Therefore, national\r\ncooperation is necessary for adequate road improvement.\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nThe work of the national government on behalf of good roads has\r\nheretofore been largely educational and advisory. In 1893 the\r\nOffice of Road Inquiry (now the Office of Public Roads) was\r\ncreated in the United States Department of Agriculture to\r\ninvestigate methods of road making and management. The results of\r\nits investigations have been published for the benefit of the\r\ncountry. Advice was given when asked for. Instruction was given\r\nthrough extension courses (p. 257). Here and there model or\r\nexperimental roads were constructed to test new methods or to\r\nserve as object lessons to the localities where they were built.\r\nGood road building has also been greatly stimulated by the\r\nextension of the rural free mail delivery, routes not being\r\nestablished unless the roads are in reasonably good condition. The\r\nnational government has also given to many states public lands\r\nwithin their borders, the proceeds from which were to be used for\r\nroad construction; and a part of the proceeds from the sale of\r\ntimber in the national forests is devoted to road building in the\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL AID ROAD ACT\r\n\r\nIn 1916, however, Congress passed the law known as the Federal Aid\r\nRoad Act. This law places the national government in the same\r\nrelation to the states, in the matter of road building, that the\r\nstate governments have borne to the counties in granting state\r\naid.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Aid Road Act appropriated 75 million dollars to aid\r\nstates in improving their \"rural post roads,\" and 10 million\r\ndollars for the construction and maintenance of roads in the\r\nnational forests. Of the 75 million dollars for state aid in\r\nbuilding post roads, 5 million dollars were to be available the\r\nfirst year, 10 million the second, 15 million the third, and so on\r\nfor five years, when the total amount will have been used. The\r\nmoney is given to the states only on their request, and on\r\ncondition that each state shall provide an amount equal to that\r\nreceived from the national treasury. The money is apportioned\r\namong the states on the basis of area, population, and the extent\r\nof post roads in the state.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE\r\n\r\nThe administration of the law is in the hands of the Office of\r\nPublic Roads. The entire country is divided into ten districts,\r\nover each of which is a district engineer. When a state desires\r\naid from the national government, its highway department must draw\r\nup plans for the improvements proposed and submit them to the\r\ndistrict engineer, who in turn submits them with recommendations\r\nto the Secretary of Agriculture, whose approval they must have.\r\nHaving obtained this approval, the work is carried on by the state\r\nas in the case of other roads entirely under state control.\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF FEDERAL AID\r\n\r\nIt is too soon yet to tell what the results of this new\r\ncooperative enterprise of the national government will be. But the\r\nfirst important effect has been to cause the organization of state\r\nhighway departments in the few states that did not already have\r\nthem, and the reorganization of such departments in the states\r\nwhere they were weak; for the Federal Aid Road Act provides that\r\naid may be given to the states only on condition that they have\r\neffective highway departments. The result is that every state in\r\nthe Union now has an active highway department, and road\r\nimprovement is going on at a rate never before known.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe amount of time saved in a year by a farmer in your locality\r\nbecause of good roads; or lost because of unimproved roads.\r\n\r\nThe wear and tear on vehicles and equipment because of unimproved\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nEffect of improved or unimproved roads in your county on school\r\nand church attendance, social life, etc.\r\n\r\nInstances of the exercise of the right of eminent domain in your\r\ncounty for road improvement.\r\n\r\nMaterials used in road making in your county.

As we have seen (p. 203), there was the\r\nclosest relation between the building of railroads and the opening\r\nof the public lands. The market of the farmer and the source of\r\nhis supplies are not merely the neighboring trading center, but in\r\nfar distant parts of the country and of the world. Without\r\nrailroads, the farmer, the manufacturer, and the city merchant\r\nwould alike be helpless.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT CONTROL OF RAILROADS\r\n\r\nWhile our government has at times given direct aid to encourage\r\nthe building of railroads, as by the gift of public lands, they\r\nhave been developed chiefly by private enterprise. They are owned\r\nby private corporations which do business under charters granted\r\nby the state governments (rarely by the national government) and\r\nregulated by law. Control over them has been exercised chiefly by\r\nthe state governments, except in matters affecting interstate\r\ncommerce, which falls under the control of Congress. As the parts\r\nof our country have become more closely bound together and\r\ninterdependent, largely by the influence of the railroads\r\nthemselves, an increasingly large part of commerce has become\r\n\"interstate\" in character, and railway transportation has become\r\nmore and more a national concern. The result is an increasing\r\ncontrol by the national government\r\n\r\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE\r\n\r\nIn 1887, Congress created an Interstate Commerce Commission with\r\npower to inquire into the management of the business of \"common\r\ncarriers,\" such as railroads, steamship lines, and express\r\ncompanies. It was later given power to fix rates which such\r\ncarriers could charge. Other laws were passed, such as the Sherman\r\nAct, or \"Anti-Trust Law,\" of 1890, which made unlawful any\r\n\"contract, combination ... or conspiracy in restraint of trade.\"\r\nThese and other laws checked abuses that characterized railroad\r\nmanagement at that time, but, on the other hand, they are said in\r\nsome respects to have hampered the economic and efficient\r\ndevelopment of the country's transportation system. The Sherman\r\nLaw, for example, absolutely forbade the consolidation of\r\ncompeting railroad lines under one management, although such\r\nconsolidation often makes for efficiency and economy.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION IN WAR\r\n\r\nWhen the United States entered the recent war, the weakness of our\r\ntransportation system quickly became apparent, and the need for\r\nthe most effective transportation service led the government to\r\ntake unusual steps to secure it. The President issued a\r\nproclamation by which, in the exercise of his WAR POWERS, he \"took\r\npossession and assumed control of each and every system of\r\ntransportation in the United States and the appurtenances\r\nthereof.\" This meant assuming control over 397,000 miles of\r\nrailways owned by 2905 corporations and employing more than\r\n1,700,000 persons. The management of this great transportation\r\nsystem was intrusted to a Railroad Administration with a Director\r\nGeneral of Railroads at its head. The ownership of these\r\nrailroads, however, remained with the private companies, which\r\nwere to receive compensation for the use of their property, and\r\nwere to receive back the railroads after the war was over.\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nThe whole purpose of the government in its management of the\r\nrailroads was to win the war, the convenience of the public being\r\na minor consideration. The people cheerfully put up with\r\ninconveniences of travel and with rates that they had not\r\nexperienced while the roads were under private management. On the\r\nother hand, there were certain decided advantages in the\r\nmanagement of all railroads as one great system. It meant the\r\nconsolidation of competing lines that the law itself prevented the\r\nrailway companies from effecting, it meant shortening routes in\r\nmany cases, the use of common freight terminals by different\r\nlines, the increase of track facilities and storage areas at\r\nseaport terminals, the selling of passenger tickets good over any\r\none of several roads running between two points.\r\n\r\nThere are those who believe that the railroads should be managed,\r\nor even owned, by the government in time of peace as well as\r\nduring war. There are others who believe as strongly in private\r\nownership and direction. Many of the latter believe, however, that\r\na more perfect control should be exercised over the privately\r\nowned roads by the government under laws that protect the\r\ninterests of the public and that at the same time permit, or even\r\nrequire, greater cooperation among the roads than has heretofore\r\nexisted. Since the war, bills have been introduced in Congress\r\nlooking to these ends, and doubtless the experience of the war\r\nwill result in an appreciable improvement in our country's railway\r\ntransportation system.\r\n\r\nWATER TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nIn the early days of our nation, rivers were used for\r\ntransportation to a large extent, and canals were proposed in\r\ngreat numbers, some of them being built and carrying a large\r\namount of traffic. The coming of the railroads caused water\r\ntransportation to decline, to the nation's great loss. The war\r\nstimulated the use of our waterways to a considerable extent, and\r\nany scheme for transportation control in the future should provide\r\nfor their fullest development as a means of marketing the products\r\nof our farms, forests, mines, and factories.\r\n\r\nThere was also a time, in the early part of our history, when our\r\nseaports swarmed with American ships that sailed every sea. Our\r\nshipping afterward declined because other nations built and manned\r\nships more cheaply than we could do. We allowed these other\r\nnations to carry our commerce. We deplored the fact that our\r\nmerchant marine had disappeared and discussed ways and means to\r\nrestore it. But all to no purpose, until the great war came; then\r\nwe HAD to have ships.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF WAR UPON OUR MERCHANT MARINE\r\n\r\nWhen we entered the war we had almost no ships. Congress created\r\nthe United States Shipping Board and its Emergency Fleet\r\nCorporation. As a result, and within a year's time, the United\r\nStates took rank as the leading shipbuilding nation in the world.\r\nIt has more shipyards, more shipways, more ship workers, more\r\nships under construction, and is building more ships every month\r\nduring the war than any other country. Prior to the war the United\r\nStates stood a poor third among the shipbuilding nations. Since\r\nAugust, 1917, more seagoing tonnage has been launched from\r\nAmerican shipyards than was ever launched before in a similar\r\nperiod anywhere. [Footnote: \"Shipping Facts,\" issued by the U.S.\r\nShipping Board, September, 1918.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, under the stress of necessity methods of shipbuilding\r\nand operation were developed that ought to make it possible for\r\nthe United States to compete successfully in the future with other\r\nnations, even though our workmen and sailors are paid more than\r\nthose of other nations.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the shipping board said, \"The American community\r\nmust think of ships as a local improvement.\" This means that the\r\nbusiness and welfare of every American community, whether a\r\nseaport or a remote farming community, are dependent upon ships.\r\nBy our merchant marine the American farmer and the American\r\nbusinessman are brought into touch with the remotest parts of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe service of the railroads to the farmers of your county.

XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nRoads and other means of transportation are important not only as\r\na means of transporting products, but also as a means of\r\ncommunication among the members of the community. Team work is\r\nimpossible without prompt and effective means of communication.\r\n\r\nTell what you know about the value of signals in getting team work\r\nin a football or baseball team.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the importance of means of communication in conducting\r\nmilitary operations. What means were used for this purpose in our\r\nArmy in France?\r\n\r\nHow were military movements reported and directed in the\r\nRevolutionary War?\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson's victory at New Orleans was won a month after the\r\nWar of 1812 was officially ended. How did this happen?\r\n\r\nWhat were some of the methods used by the American Indians to\r\nconvey information between distant points?\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting chapters in history is that relating\r\nto the development of means of communication. Language itself is\r\nthe most important of these means. It is not altogether clear what\r\nthe first steps were in the development of spoken language; but we\r\nknow that among uncivilized peoples conversation is aided, and\r\noften largely carried on, by signs made with the hands. Written\r\nlanguage certainly developed from the use of pictures, which were\r\ngradually curtailed into HIEROGLYPHICS, such as were used by the\r\nancient Egyptians, and finally developed into the ALPHABET, each\r\nletter of which was originally a picture.\r\n\r\nA story is told of a group of American Indians who some years ago\r\nvisited an eastern city. They could not make themselves\r\nunderstood, nor could they understand others, and became very\r\nlonely. They were taken to visit a deaf-and-dumb institution,\r\nwhere they were quite delighted to find that they could converse\r\nfreely by the use of a natural sign language.\r\n\r\nUncivilized peoples are in the habit of conveying ideas in the\r\nmost astonishing ways. For example, among a certain African tribe\r\nthe gift of a tooth brush carries a message of affection. These\r\nAfricans take great pride in their white teeth, and the tooth\r\nbrush carries the message, \"As I think of my teeth morning, noon,\r\nand night, so I think often of you.\"\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the development of the alphabet from pictures, our\r\nletter M represents the ears of an owl, which in Egypt was called\r\nMU, and the picture of which, later reduced to the ears, came to\r\nrepresent the sound of M..\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF ILLITERACY AND INABILITY TO USE ENGLISH\r\n\r\nThe fascinating story of the development of language cannot be\r\ntold here. It is referred to because we are likely to forget what\r\nan important factor it is in making community life possible.\r\nInability to use a common language prevents intercourse and team\r\nwork. Large numbers of men drafted in the American Army were\r\nunable to understand the English language. Between 30,000 and\r\n40,000 illiterates were taken in the first draft and it is said\r\nthat there were nearly 700,000 men of draft age in the United\r\nStates who could neither read nor write. They could not sign their\r\nnames, nor read orders or instructions. They had to be separated\r\nand taught, thus greatly delaying the complete organization of our\r\navailable fighting forces. Inability to use a common language is\r\nequally an obstacle in industrial life, for non-English speaking\r\nworkmen are unable to understand instructions, or to read signs\r\nand warnings. Many accidents are due to this cause. It is said\r\nthat approximately 5 1/2 million of our population above ten years\r\nof age cannot read or write in any language, and that 5 million of\r\nour foreign population cannot use English. An active campaign is\r\nnow being conducted to teach English to foreigners and to\r\neradicate illiteracy. A bill has recently been introduced in\r\nCongress to provide Federal aid for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIf the productive labor value of an illiterate is less by only 50\r\ncents a day than that of an educated man or woman, the country is\r\nlosing $825,000,000 a year through illiteracy ... The Federal\r\nGovernment and the States spend millions of dollars in trying to\r\ngive information to the people in rural districts about farming\r\nand home making. Yet 3,700,000, or 10 per cent, of our country\r\nfolk can not read or write a word. They can not read a bulletin on\r\nagriculture, a farm paper, a food-pledge card, a liberty-loan\r\nappeal, a newspaper, the Constitution of the United States, or\r\ntheir Bibles, nor can they keep personal or business accounts. An\r\nuninformed democracy is not a democracy. A people who cannot have\r\nmeans of access to the mediums of public opinion and to the\r\nmessages of the President and the acts of Congress can hardly be\r\nexpected to understand the full meaning of this war, to which they\r\nall must contribute in life or property or labor.--SECRETARY\r\nLANE, Annual Report, 1918, p. 30. From letter to the President.\r\n\r\nAsk at home: What is \"illiteracy\"? What is the difference between\r\nan \"illiterate\" and a non-English speaking person?\r\n\r\nDebate (or discuss):\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, That ALL persons of sound mind in the United States\r\nshould be required by law to attend school until they are able to\r\nspeak, read, and write English fluently.\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, That the elimination of illiteracy and the teaching of\r\nEnglish to foreigners should be left wholly to the states without\r\ninterference or aid from the national government.\r\n\r\nWhy are foreigners required to read sections from the Constitution\r\nof the United States before they receive their \"naturalization\"\r\npapers?\r\n\r\nWhat does \"knowing how to read\" mean?\r\n\r\nDebate:\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, That no native-born American should be permitted to vote\r\nwho cannot read intelligently.\r\n\r\nWhat is being done in your community and in your state to\r\neradicate illiteracy and to teach English to foreigners?\r\n\r\nTHE PRINTING PRESS AND NEWSPAPERS\r\n\r\nNext to language itself, the most important invention for the\r\ncommunication of ideas is the art of printing. It made possible\r\nthe book, the magazine, the newspaper. The writer of this book is\r\nenabled to communicate with boys and girls whom he will never see\r\nby means of the printed page and the pictures which the book\r\ncontains. By the same means the ideas of people who lived long ago\r\nhave been handed down to us, and the ideas of to-day will be\r\npassed on to later generations. Most wonderful is the modern\r\nnewspaper, which daily carries into almost every home of the land\r\nthe important happenings in the world during the preceding twenty-\r\nfour hours. In cities several editions are printed during the day.\r\nThe newspaper enables the merchant to communicate, through\r\nadvertisements, with possible buyers, and the farmer and business\r\nman to keep posted regarding crop conditions and market prices.\r\nMost newspapers have special departments for different classes of\r\nreaders--a woman's page, a children's column, a page devoted to\r\nsports, another to market conditions. Most of them also have a\r\ndepartment in which individuals may ask questions or express their\r\nown opinions regarding questions of the day. The \"local\r\nnewspaper,\" with a circulation that seldom extends far beyond the\r\ncounty in which it is published, is of the greatest value in\r\nstimulating a community spirit.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH\r\n\r\nThe first amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\nprovides that:\r\n\r\nCongress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech or\r\nof the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble...\r\n\r\nThe right of free speech and of a free press is a very sacred one,\r\nand its maintenance is one of the chief safeguards of democracy.\r\nIt is the means by which PUBLIC OPINION is formed and made known;\r\nand public opinion is one of the chief means of control in a\r\ndemocracy. It controls the conduct of individuals, and it controls\r\nthe actions of government. The representatives and leaders of the\r\npeople in the government seek constantly to know what public\r\nopinion is, and the public press is one of the chief channels\r\nthrough which they may find out. On the other hand, leaders and\r\nparties seek to FORM public opinion, to lead the people to think\r\nin certain ways and to support certain ideas. The press affords an\r\neffective means for doing this.\r\n\r\nPROPAGANDA\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that both good leaders and bad leaders may thus\r\ncreate public opinion, that both good and bad ideas may be spread\r\nthrough the press. During the war we heard much about German\r\nPROPAGANDA. This means that ideas were systematically spread to\r\ncreate a public opinion favorable to the German cause. It was done\r\nlargely by rumors, springing from no one knows where, and\r\nspreading by word of mouth. But it was also accomplished through\r\nthe newspapers, by news items and stories that appeared to be true\r\nand that were published innocently enough in most cases, but that\r\nafterward were found to be false.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOMENT OF PUBLIC OPINION\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that all propaganda is harmful or\r\ndangerous. There is propaganda in good causes, or on both sides of\r\na disputed question. By this means public opinion is educated.\r\nWhen the peace conference at Paris proposed a plan for a League of\r\nNations, it was at once taken up for discussion through the\r\nnewspapers and magazines. People who believed in the idea\r\norganized a campaign of PUBLICITY to support the plan and to\r\ncreate a public opinion for it, while those opposed to it were\r\nequally active in their attempt to create a public opinion against\r\nit. In this way the people became informed regarding the question,\r\nprovided they read both sides of the discussion and not one only.\r\nLeaders in the community may conduct propaganda through the\r\nnewspapers in behalf of better schools, better roads, woman\r\nsuffrage, prohibition, or any other cause.\r\n\r\nThe good citizen cannot well get along without the newspaper and\r\nmagazine. But he needs to keep in mind the fact that news items\r\nmay be in error, and that the opinions expressed by editors and\r\nother writers usually represent the opinions of but a single group\r\nof people, which may be large or small, right or wrong. In most\r\ncases these writers are sincere, but there is always the chance\r\nfor error. The intelligent citizen will not base his own opinions\r\nand actions solely on what he reads in ONE paper or magazine or\r\nbook, but will seek to understand ALL sides of a question. He is\r\nhelped to do this by the great variety of publications available\r\nrepresenting every shade of belief, and by the freedom of speech\r\nand of the press under our system of government.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTROL OF FREE SPEECH AND A FREE PRESS\r\n\r\nFreedom of speech and of the press does not mean that a citizen\r\nmay always say anything he pleases in public. At no time has one\r\nthe right to attack the character of another by false or malicious\r\nstatements. This constitutes slander, or libel, and may be\r\npunished by the courts. In time of war freedom of speech and of\r\nthe press may be restricted to an extent that would not be\r\ntolerated in time of peace, because if absolute freedom were\r\npermitted information might be made public that would be helpful\r\nto the enemy, and propaganda started that would be dangerous to\r\nthe public safety. But even in war time, the people of a democracy\r\nchafe under restrictions upon free speech and a free press, and it\r\nis often a delicate question to determine how far such restriction\r\nis justifiable or wise.\r\n\r\nMake a report on the invention of the printing press.\r\n\r\nIs there more than one \"local paper\" in your town or county? Do\r\nthese local papers take the same position in regard to public\r\nquestions? Do you read more than one?\r\n\r\nWhat is the most influential newspaper in your state (ask at\r\nhome)? Why is it so influential?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between a news story and an editorial?\r\n\r\nAsk at home what newspaper editor it was who said, \"Go West, young\r\nman.\" Also find out what you can about his influence as an editor.\r\n\r\nExamine with care the newspapers you take at home and make a list\r\nof their different \"departments\" or \"sections.\"\r\n\r\nWhat do you first look for in the newspaper when you read it? Ask\r\nyour father and mother and other members of the family what they\r\nfirst look for.\r\n\r\nWhat is the value of CARTOONS in the newspaper? Do you study them?\r\nDo they convey a story to you? Make a collection of cartoons that\r\nyou think are particularly good, and explain what each means.\r\n\r\nIs any propaganda being conducted now in the newspapers you read?\r\nIf so, explain what it is.\r\n\r\nTo what extent are newspaper and magazine advertisements useful in\r\nyour home?\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICES AND POST-ROADS\r\n\r\nCongress was given power by the Constitution \"to establish post-\r\noffices and post-roads.\" There had been a postal service in the\r\ncolonies before the Revolution. During the Revolution Benjamin\r\nFranklin was made Postmaster General, and he made the service as\r\neffective as it could well be made under the conditions that\r\nexisted in those times. The plan that he devised was continued\r\nafter the Constitution was adopted. In those days mails were sent\r\nfrom New York to Boston and to Philadelphia two or three times a\r\nweek. They were carried on horseback or by stage and by boat.\r\nSometimes a month was consumed by a trip that can now be made in a\r\nhalf-day. Postage cost from six cents to twenty-five cents for\r\neach letter, according to the distance it was carried, and had to\r\nbe paid in cash in advance. Postage stamps were not introduced\r\nuntil 1847. Often mail was allowed to accumulate until there was\r\nenough to pay for the trip. The isolation of a remote rural\r\ncommunity can well be imagined where the difficulties of\r\ncommunication were so great, and where the scarcity of money made\r\npostage an important item.\r\n\r\nRURAL MAIL ROUTES\r\n\r\nIn 1918 there were 54,345 post-offices in the United States\r\nmanaged by the Post-Office Department at Washington, besides\r\nnearly 600 in the Philippines managed by the war Department, and a\r\nfew in the Panama Canal Zone. Of the 3030 counties in the United\r\nStates, 3008 had rural mail routes aggregating more than a million\r\nmiles in extent, serving more than 6 million families, and costing\r\nfor operation more than 53 million dollars. This cost, however\r\namounts to only about $1.90 for each person served, or a little\r\nmore than one cent for each piece of mail handled. The aim is to\r\nmake the postal service pay for itself, and in 1918 the receipts\r\nexceeded the expenditures by more than 60 million dollars.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SERVICES OF THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nThe Post-Office Department not only provides for the\r\ntransportation of ordinary mail, but through its post-offices it\r\nsells money orders for the transmission of money safely through\r\nthe mails; it operates the parcel post by which merchandise may be\r\ntransported, including farm produce of many kinds; it administers\r\nthe postal savings system. One of the interesting divisions of the\r\nPost-Office Department is the Division of Dead Letters, to which\r\nis returned all mail that fails to reach its destination. In 1918\r\nthere were returned to the Dead-Letter Division 14,451,953 pieces\r\nof mail. In these \"dead letters\" there were drafts, checks, money\r\norders, and loose money, amounting to $4,194,839.68. The failure\r\nof this mail to reach its proper destination is due in very large\r\nmeasure to carelessness in addressing and to failure to place on\r\nthe envelope or package a return address. A great deal of loss and\r\ninconvenience could be avoided, and much labor and expense saved\r\nfor the postal service, if every one would see that every piece of\r\nmail sent out is properly addressed and stamped, and has a return\r\naddress in the upper left-hand corner.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION OF THE MAILS\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the postal service depends very largely upon the\r\nmeans of transportation, from steamship and railway lines down to\r\nthe country roads. Nothing else, perhaps, has stimulated the\r\nimprovement of roads so much as the rural mail service. It is the\r\npower granted by the Constitution to Congress to establish POST-\r\nroads that enables the Federal government to aid the states in\r\nroad improvement. The development of fast mail trains and the\r\nintroduction of motor-truck service have been important steps in\r\nthe improvement of the postal service in city and country. The\r\nlatest development is the transportation of mail by airplane. An\r\naerial mail route between Washington, D. C., and New York City was\r\nestablished May 15, 1918, and a round trip daily is now made over\r\nthis route, regardless of weather conditions. The flying time from\r\nWashington to New York, with a stop at Philadelphia, averages two\r\nhours and thirty minutes, or one half the time of the fastest\r\ntrains. The Post-Office Department is planning an extensive\r\nairplane mail service from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with\r\nvarious side lines; also to the West Indies, Panama, and South\r\nAmerica. The routes are partially worked out, and trial trips have\r\nbeen made in some cases, as between New York and Chicago.\r\n\r\nTHE TELEGRAPH\r\n\r\nWe need only mention the important part played by the telegraph,\r\nthe submarine cable, and RADIO-COMMUNICATION, in binding together\r\nour nation and the world as a whole. Without them the modern\r\nnewspaper, with its daily news from every corner of the globe,\r\nwould be impossible, our cooperation in the great World War would\r\nhave been extremely difficult, and the President probably would\r\nnot have left the United States to participate in the peace\r\nnegotiations at Paris. Although the first telegraph line in the\r\nUnited States was owned and operated by the government as a part\r\nof the postal service, the telegraph service of the country has\r\nsince been in the hands of private corporations; except that\r\nduring the war the Post-Office Department took over the management\r\nof the telegraph and the telephone, as the Railroad Administration\r\ntook over the transportation lines.\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONE\r\n\r\nAs this chapter is being written, word has come that the Secretary\r\nof the Navy has talked by WIRELESS TELEPHONE with the President of\r\nthe United States while the latter was 800 miles out at sea on his\r\nreturn from France. At the close of the war American aviators were\r\ntalking with one another from airplane to airplane, and receiving\r\norders from the ground, by wireless telephone. These instances\r\nsuggest new possibilities of communication in the near future.\r\nAlready the ordinary telephone has practically made over our\r\ncommunity life in many particulars. We can hardly estimate its\r\nvalue in business and home life, in the city or on the farm. There\r\nare about 8000 rural telephone systems in the United States\r\nserving the homes of two million farmers. In 1912, out of seven\r\nhundred and eighteen telephone systems in North Carolina, about\r\nsix hundred and fifty were country telephone systems owned and\r\noperated privately by groups of farmers. These included about\r\n20,000 telephones and used approximately 35,000 miles of wire.\r\n\r\nSERVICE OF THE RURAL TELEPHONE To call a neighbor and ask for the\r\nexchange of labor on certain work, as threshing, haying, etc., is\r\nonly the work of a moment. To have a definite answer immediately\r\nis often worth much. To be able to 'phone the village storekeeper,\r\nwho runs a country delivery, and ask that supplies be sent out is\r\na great convenience to the housewife. To 'phone the implement\r\ndealer and learn whether he has needed repairs in stock and, if\r\nso, to have them sent out on the next trolley car, if not to ask\r\nhim to telegraph the factory to forward them immediately by\r\nexpress, is a saving of time that often amounts to a large saving\r\nwhen the planting or harvesting of crops is delayed because of\r\nneeded repairs.\r\n\r\n... farm homes have been saved from destruction by fire because of\r\nprompt help secured by word over the telephone; ... valuable\r\nanimals have been saved through the early arrival of the\r\nveterinarian who was summoned by 'phone. ... Many an itinerant\r\nsharper's plans have been frustrated. ... The sharper in disgust\r\nturns to other fields where there are no telephones over which to\r\nnotify his prospective victims of his game.\r\n\r\nBusiness appointments, social appointments, discussions of social\r\nand church plans, to say nothing of the mere friendly exchange of\r\ngreeting over the telephone have probably compensated every owner\r\nof a rural telephone many times over for the expense of it, if all\r\nbusiness advantages were ignored.\r\n\r\n... At some seasons of the year the general summons to the 'phone\r\ngives notice that central is ready to report the weather bureau's\r\nprognostication for the following day. ...\r\n\r\n[Footnote: \"Rural Conveniences,\" by H.

The common people were\r\ntrained to be efficient workers, and thus to contribute to the\r\nnational strength; but they were trained TO SUBMIT to authority,\r\nand not to exercise control over it. The kind of education that\r\ndevelops leaders was given only to the few. The leaders of the\r\nGerman people were imposed upon them from above; in the United\r\nStates we are supposed to CHOOSE our leaders. In a nation whose\r\naim is to afford to every citizen an equal opportunity to make the\r\nmost of himself and whose people are self-governing, education\r\nmust be widespread, it must develop the power of self-direction,\r\nit must train leaders, and it must enable the people to choose\r\ntheir leaders intelligently. When Governor Berkeley of Virginia\r\nreported to the king of England in 1671, \"I thank God there are no\r\nfree schools nor printing; and I hope we shall not have these\r\nhundred years,\" he spoke for the autocratic form of government\r\nwhich a hundred years later led the colonies to revolt, and which\r\nin 1917 forced the United Stares into a world war.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT BY MEANS OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\nIn a democracy government must be carried on largely BY MEANS OF\r\neducation. There must be trained leadership. And since the aim of\r\ndemocratic government is to secure team work in public affairs,\r\nthe people must have the tools of team work, such as a common\r\nlanguage and other knowledge that makes living and working\r\ntogether possible; they must have training that will enable them\r\nto contribute effectively to the community's work, and an\r\nintelligent understanding of the community's aims and ideals. And\r\nsince government is controlled largely by public opinion, the\r\npeople must have an intelligent understanding of the community's\r\nproblems. We had abundant illustration during the recent war of\r\nthe extent to which our government not only depended upon highly\r\neducated men and women for leadership, but also used educational\r\nmethods to secure its ends.\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\nThese facts explain why public education is the largest single\r\nitem of expense in our government (except in time of war). In 1914\r\nnearly 600 million dollars were spent for public elementary and\r\nhigh schools. Some 200 million dollars more were spent for private\r\nelementary and high schools, and for universities, colleges, and\r\nnormal schools, some of which are public and some private.\r\n\r\nINEQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL REQIUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nIf democracy is to be safe and efficient, every member must have a\r\nreasonable education. Every state now has a compulsory education\r\nlaw, though these laws vary greatly. In some states every child\r\nmust attend school for seven years (7 to 14, or 8 to 15), and in\r\none state (Maryland) for eight years. In other states the period\r\nis less, sometimes as little as four years. In most of the states\r\nthere is an additional period, usually of two years (14 to 16),\r\nduring which children must remain in school unless they go to\r\nwork. As a rule there are laws that forbid the employment of\r\nchildren in industry before the age of 14. In some states they may\r\ngo to work as soon as they reach the age limit regardless of what\r\ntheir educational qualifications are; in others they must have\r\ncompleted the eight grades of the elementary school; in others\r\n\r\n[Editor's Note: Missing text.]\r\n\r\nlaws are not well enforced in some states. The facing table shows\r\nthe number of children of school age in and out of school in the\r\nseveral states in 1915-1916. For the country as a whole, 17.4 per\r\ncent of the children of school age were not in school.\r\n\r\n\"School terms are so short in many states and compulsory\r\nattendance is so badly enforced that THE SCHOOL LIFE OF THE\r\nAVERAGE PERSON GROWING UP IN RURAL SECTIONS IS ONLY 4.5 SCHOOL\r\nYEARS OF 140 DAYS EACH. In urban communities conditions are\r\nbetter, but far from satisfactory.\" [Footnote: Bulletin, 1919, No.\r\n4, U. S. Bureau of Education, \"A Manual of Educational\r\nLegislation,\" p. 6.]\r\n\r\n[PM Note: Leave this page blank. Please do not delete this note]\r\n\r\nThe facing table shows the number of days the public schools were\r\nopen, the average number of days of attendance by each pupil\r\nenrolled, and the rank of the state in each case, for each state\r\nin the school year 1915-1916.\r\n\r\nWhy would it not be more democratic to permit children to attend\r\nschool or not as they or their parents wish?\r\n\r\nDiscuss the statement that \"education makes people free.\" Compare\r\nthis statement with a somewhat similar statement made on page 136,\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\nWhat is the compulsory school age in your state?\r\n\r\nIs wide variation in the compulsory school age among the different\r\nstates a good thing? Why?\r\n\r\nIs the compulsory school law rigidly enforced in your state? How\r\nis it enforced?\r\n\r\nHow much of each year must a child spend in school during the\r\ncompulsory period in your state?\r\n\r\nInvestigate the reasons given by pupils in your community for\r\nleaving school before completing the course, and report.\r\n\r\nWhat rank does your state hold with respect to length of term? to\r\naverage daily attendance of pupils? (See table.)\r\n\r\nWhat rank does your state hold with respect to number of children\r\nof school age in and out of school? (See table.)\r\n\r\nWhat is the length of your own school year? Do you think it should\r\nbe lengthened? Why?\r\n\r\nGet from your teacher or principal the average daily attendance\r\nfor each pupil enrolled in your school; in your county. Do you\r\nthink this record could be improved?\r\n\r\nIs there any good reason why the school year should be shorter in\r\nrural communities than in cities?\r\n\r\nIt is advocated by many that schools should be open the year\r\nround. What advantages can you see in the plan? Debate the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRICT SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe pioneer family was dependent at first upon its own efforts for\r\nthe education of its children. When other families came, a\r\nschoolhouse was built, a teacher employed and the work of teaching\r\nthe elements of knowledge was handed over to the school. This was\r\nthe origin of the \"district school,\" which is characteristic of\r\npioneer conditions. As the population grew and local government\r\nwas organized, the unit of local government tended to become the\r\nunit for school administration. In New England this was the \"town\"\r\nor township; in the South it was the county; in the West it was\r\nsometimes the township and sometimes the county, or else a\r\ncombination of the two. In a large number of the western states,\r\nhowever, and in a few of the eastern states, the district school\r\npersists in many rural communities, a relic of pioneer conditions.\r\nIt is often felt that it is more democratic for each district to\r\nadminister its own school, subject only to the laws of the state.\r\n\r\nUnder the district system there is an annual school meeting of the\r\nvoters of the district, who vote the school taxes, determine the\r\nlength of the school year, and elect a board of education or\r\nschool trustees. The trustees look after the school property,\r\nchoose the teacher and fix his salary, and in a general way manage\r\nthe school business. Each school is independent of all other\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nTOWNSHIP ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nUnder the township system all of the schools of the township are\r\nadministered by a township board or committee (or by a single\r\ntrustee in Indiana) elected by the people of the township. The\r\nchief advantages over the district system are that all the schools\r\nof the township are administered by a single plan, the taxes are\r\napportioned to the schools according to needs, and pupils may be\r\ntransferred from one school to another at convenience. In New\r\nEngland two or three townships are sometimes united into a \"union\r\ndistrict\" supervised by a single superintendent.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nUnder the county system all the schools of the county are under\r\nthe management of a county board and, usually, a county\r\nsuperintendent. In 29 of the 39 states that have county\r\nsuperintendents they are elected by the people, in 8 states they\r\nare appointed by the county board, in Delaware they are appointed\r\nby the governor, and in New Jersey by the state commissioner of\r\neducation. Election of the county superintendent is losing favor\r\non the ground that there is less assurance of securing a highly\r\ntrained man. The chart on page 293 shows a plan of organization\r\nfor county schools proposed to the legislature of South Dakota by\r\nthe United States Bureau of Education.\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages of the county system are greater economy,\r\nmore nearly equal educational opportunity for all children of the\r\ncounty, and better supervision because of the larger funds\r\navailable for this purpose. It is under the county system of\r\norganization that the movement for SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION is\r\nprogressing most rapidly. By this is meant the union of a number\r\nof small, poorly equipped schools into a larger, well-graded, and\r\nwell equipped school. Its advantages may best be suggested by an\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nIn Randolph County, Indiana, there were, in 1908, 128 one-room\r\nschools in the open country, with an attendance of from 12 to 60\r\npupils doing grade work only, 6 two-room schools in hamlets, with\r\ngrade work only; 2 three room schools in villages, with grade work\r\nand two years of high school work with a six months' term; 3 four-\r\nroom village schools, with grade work and three years of high\r\nschool work with a six months' term; 1 six-room school in a town,\r\nwith grade work and four years of high school work with an eight\r\nmonths' term.\r\n\r\nBy consolidation, 113 one-room schools and 4 two-room schools were\r\nsupplanted by 20 consolidated schools with two grade teachers; 6\r\nwith four grade teachers, 6 with five grade teachers; 2 with six\r\ngrade teachers; and 1 with eight grade teachers--a total of 86\r\ngrade teachers doing the work formerly done by 148 teachers, and\r\ndoing it better. Fifteen of the schools have a four-year high\r\nschool course with an eight months' term. For the five-year period\r\npreceding consolidation not more than half of the eighth-grade\r\npupils attended high school; after consolidation, an average of 96\r\nper cent of the eighth-grade pupils went to high school.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are transported to and from school in hacks or motor-\r\nbusses heated in winter. The school buildings are equipped with\r\nrunning water, modern heating and sanitation, telephone, restrooms\r\nfor pupils and teachers, gymnasiums and outdoor physical\r\napparatus, physical training and athletic competition being\r\ncarried on under supervision. The courses of study have been\r\nenriched, increased attention is given to vocational work, and\r\nmusic and art receive attention impossible in the district\r\nschools. Eleven of the schools have orchestras, and concerts are\r\nheld which the community as well as the schools attend. There are\r\nauditoriums used for community lectures and concerts, Sunday-\r\nschool conventions, community sings, parent-teachers' meetings,\r\nand exhibits of various kinds.\r\n\r\nReport on the following:\r\n\r\nSchool life in colonial New England; in colonial Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe first schools in your own community--length of school term,\r\nattendance, whether private or public, qualifications of teachers,\r\nmethods of teaching.\r\n\r\nWhat the family does for the education of the children that the\r\nschool cannot do.

Does your board perform any\r\nduties that should be performed by the superintendent, or VICE\r\nVERSA? Explain.\r\n\r\nParent-teacher organizations in your community and their service.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE HIGH SCHOOL\r\n\r\nPublic education was long restricted to the elementary school.\r\nHigh schools were at first private academies designed to prepare\r\nfor college the few who wished to continue their education. While\r\nthey still continue to give preparation for college, their\r\ndevelopment in recent years has been largely for the benefit of\r\nthe greater number of boys and girls who do not expect to go to\r\ncollege. The high school naturally made its first appearance in\r\ncities. It requires more elaborate equipment and more highly\r\ntrained teachers, and its cost is at least twice that of\r\nelementary schools. These facts, together with the small and\r\nscattered population of rural communities, have been obstacles to\r\nthe development of rural high schools. The consolidated school has\r\nin large measure removed these obstacles, and a high school\r\neducation is rapidly becoming as available for rural boys and\r\ngirls as for those who live in cities.\r\n\r\nReport on:\r\n\r\nThe history of high school development in your community.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of pupils in your community who go to high school\r\nafter completing the elementary school.\r\n\r\n\"What the high school does for my community.\"\r\n\r\n\"My reasons for going (or not going) to high school.\"\r\n\r\nThe cost per pupil in the high school in your community as\r\ncompared with that in the elementary school.\r\n\r\nEducation must not only be within the reach of every citizen of a\r\ndemocracy, but it must be of a kind that will fit him to play well\r\nhis part as a member of the community.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION FOR PHYSICAL FITNESS\r\n\r\nThe public schools now give more attention than formerly to the\r\nphysical education and welfare of the pupils (see Chapter XX, pp.\r\n314, 315). The wide prevalence of physical defects disclosed in\r\nthe effort to raise an army during the recent war will doubtless\r\ncause still greater emphasis to be placed on this aspect of\r\neducation. Physical fitness is the foundation of good citizenship.\r\nProvision for physical education and welfare has found its way\r\ninto rural schools more slowly than in city schools, as the\r\nfollowing table shows. But our nation can be neither efficient nor\r\nfully democratic until the physical well-being of all its citizens\r\nis provided for, and the responsibility rests largely with the\r\npublic school.\r\n\r\nHEALTH WORK IN CITY AND RURAL SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Adapted from Dr. Thomas D. Wood, in New York TIMES\r\nMagazine, April 2, 1916.]\r\n\r\nEDUCATION FOR VOCATIONAL FITNESS\r\n\r\nIt is a part of the business of education to fit every citizen to\r\nearn a living, for every efficient citizen must be self-supporting\r\nand able to contribute effectively to the productive work of the\r\ncommunity. The interdependence of all occupations in modern\r\nindustry and the necessity for every worker to be a specialist\r\nmake training essential for every worker who is to attain success\r\nfor himself and contribute his full share to the community's work.\r\nThe war emphasized strongly the nation's dependence upon trained\r\nworkers in every field of industry.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL AID FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION\r\n\r\nOne of the direct results of war needs was the passage by\r\nCongress, in 1917, of the Smith-Hughes Act, providing for national\r\naid for vocational instruction for persons over 14 years of age\r\nwho have already entered upon, or are preparing to enter, some\r\ntrade. The instruction given under the terms of this act must be\r\nof less than college grade. Every state in the Union has met the\r\nconditions imposed by this law.\r\n\r\nThe Smith-Hughes Act created a Federal Board for Vocational\r\nEducation to consist of the Secretaries of the Departments of\r\nAgriculture, Commerce and Labor, the United States Commissioner of\r\nEducation, and three citizens appointed by the President, one to\r\nrepresent labor interests, one commercial and manufacturing\r\ninterests, and the third agricultural interests. The law\r\nappropriates national funds to be given to the state for the\r\nestablishment of vocational schools and for the training of\r\nteachers for these schools; but each state must appropriate an\r\namount equal to that received from the national government. Each\r\nstate must also have a board for vocational education, through\r\nwhich the national board has its dealings with the state.\r\n\r\nBREADTH OF PREPARATION FOR VOCATIONAL LIFE\r\n\r\nThe duty of the regular elementary and high schools is not to\r\ncultivate special vocational skills; not to turn out trained\r\nfarmers, or mechanics, and so on. But the work of these schools\r\nshould be such that their graduates will be better farmers, or\r\nmechanics, or lawyers, or doctors, or engineers, or teachers, than\r\nthey would be without it. First of all these schools should\r\nproduce workers who are physically fit for the work they enter.\r\nThey should educate the hand and the eye along with the brain.\r\nThey should cultivate habits of working together, give instruction\r\nregarding the significance of all work in community and national\r\nlife, and by every means possible prepare the pupil to make a wise\r\nchoice of vocation. Moreover, the schools should provide a breadth\r\nof education that will \"transmute days of dreary work into happier\r\nlives.\"\r\n\r\nMAKING LIFE EDUCATIONAL\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Quick in his story of \"The Brown Mouse,\" which is a\r\nplea for better rural schools, says:\r\n\r\nLet us cease thinking so much of agricultural education, and\r\ndevote ourselves to educational agriculture. So will the nation be\r\nmade strong.\r\n\r\nThe life we live, even on the farm, is full of science and\r\nhistory, civics and economics, arithmetic and geography, poetry\r\nand art. The modern school helps the pupil to find these things in\r\nhis daily life and, having found them, to apply them to living for\r\nhis profit and enjoyment. For this reason it works largely through\r\nthe \"home project,\" boys' and girls' clubs, gardening, and many\r\nother activities.\r\n\r\nA recent writer has said,\r\n\r\nWhat is the true end of American education? Is it life or a\r\nliving? ... Education finds itself face to face with a bigger\r\nthing than life or the getting of a living. It is face to face\r\nwith a big enough thing to die for in France, a big enough thing\r\nto go to school for in America ... Neither life nor the getting of\r\na living, but LIVING TOGETHER, this must be the single PUBLIC end\r\nof a common public education hereafter. [Footnote: D. R. Sharp,\r\n\"Patrons of Democracy,\" in ATLANTIC MONTHLY, November, 1919, p.\r\n650.]\r\n\r\nEDUCATION FOR LIVING TOGETHER\r\n\r\nThe more nearly the conditions of living in the school community\r\ncorrespond to the conditions of living in the community outside of\r\nschool, the better the training afforded for living together. In\r\nmany schools the spirit and methods of community life prevail,\r\neven to the extent of school government in which the pupils\r\nparticipate.\r\n\r\nOf this community pupils and teachers are members with certain\r\ncommon interests. Cooperation is the keynote of the community\r\nlife. The realization of this cooperation is seen in the\r\nclassrooms, in study halls, in the assembly room, in the\r\ncorridors, on the playground. It manifests itself in the method of\r\npreparing and conducting recitations; in the care of school\r\nproperty; in protecting the rights of younger children; in\r\nmaintaining the sanitary conditions of the building and grounds;\r\nin the elimination of cases of \"discipline\" and of irregularity of\r\nattendance; in the preparation and conduct of opening exercises,\r\nschool entertainments, and graduating exercises; in beautifying\r\nthe school grounds; in the making of repairs and equipment for\r\n\"our school\"; in fact, in every aspect of the school life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: \"Civic Education in Elementary Schools,\" p. 31, United\r\nStates Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1915, No. 17.]\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL AS A COMMUNITY CENTER\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse is becoming more and more the center of community\r\nlife. We have noticed how, in Randolph County, Indiana, the\r\nconsolidated school building affords a meeting place for all sorts\r\nof community activities. The school law of California provides\r\nthat:\r\n\r\nThere is hereby established a civic center at each and every\r\npublic schoolhouse within the State of California, where the\r\ncitizens of the respective public school districts ... may engage\r\nin supervised recreational activities, and where they may meet and\r\ndiscuss ... any and all subjects and questions which in their\r\njudgment may appertain to the educational, political, economic,\r\nartistic, and moral interests of the respective communities in\r\nwhich they may reside; Provided, that such use of said public\r\nschoolhouse and grounds for said meetings shall in no wise\r\ninterfere with such use and occupancy of said public schoolhouse\r\nand grounds as is now, or hereafter may be, required for the\r\npurpose of said public schools of the State of California.\r\nInvestigate and report on the following:\r\n\r\nProvision in your school and in the schools of your state for\r\nhealth work suggested in the table on page 299.\r\n\r\nOther provisions in your school for the physical well-being of\r\npupils.\r\n\r\nThe work of your school that relates directly to preparation for\r\nearning a living.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which a high school can make a farmer.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the Smith-Hughes Act in your state and in your\r\ncounty or town.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the quotation from \"The Brown Mouse\" on page 301.\r\n\r\nThe use of \"home projects\" by your school.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the statement that the end of public education is\r\n\"neither life nor the getting of a living, but living together.\"\r\n\r\nDifferences and similarities between the government of your school\r\nand that of the community in which you live.

(See references.)\r\n\r\nEducational work for adults in your community.\r\n\r\nEducational agencies in your community besides schools.\r\n\r\nSTATE ORGANIZATION FOR EDUCATION\r\n\r\nThe schools of the local community are a part of the state school\r\nsystem. Education is considered a duty of the state, though it is\r\nperformed largely by local agencies. The constitutions of all\r\nstates make provision for it. State control and support of\r\neducation are necessary if there is to be equality of educational\r\nopportunity for all children of the state. Every state has a\r\ndepartment of education, and in most states each local community\r\nreceives a portion of a general state tax for school purposes. The\r\nstate departments of education differ widely from one another both\r\nin organization and in the effectiveness of their work. In most\r\nstates there is a state board of education, composed sometimes of\r\ncertain state officials, including the governor and the state\r\nsuperintendent of education, sometimes of citizens appointed for\r\nthis purpose alone by the governor or (in four states) by the\r\nlegislature. In only one state is it elected by popular vote. In\r\nall states there is also a chief educational officer, usually\r\ncalled state superintendent or commissioner of education or of\r\npublic instruction. In several states women hold this position.\r\nThe state superintendent is sometimes elected by popular vote,\r\nsometimes appointed by the state board of education or by the\r\ngovernor. Under the state superintendent there are deputy\r\nsuperintendents, heads of departments, and supervisors of the\r\nvarious branches of educational work. The diagram on page 293\r\nshows a plan of organization proposed for one state by the United\r\nStates Bureau of Education.\r\n\r\nRELATION OF STATE TO LOCAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe extent of the supervision and control exercised by the state\r\ndepartment of education over the schools of the state varies\r\nwithin wide limits. In some cases it is very little. In many\r\nstates there are state courses of study that are followed more or\r\nless closely by local communities. In a number of states the\r\ntextbooks used by all schools are selected either by the state\r\nboard of education or by a special state textbook commission. In\r\nNew York State the examination questions used in all schools are\r\nprepared by the state educational authorities. Some states furnish\r\ntext books free, and in a very few the state even prints all\r\ntextbooks. It has not been easy to work out a well-balanced plan\r\nof state administration of schools that would ensure a\r\nthoroughgoing education for the entire state, and that would at\r\nthe same time leave sufficient freedom to local school authorities\r\nto adjust the work to local needs.\r\n\r\nHIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nMany of the states support higher educational institutions, such\r\nas state universities and state agricultural colleges, at which\r\nattendance is free for citizens of the state. There are also\r\nspecial state schools for defectives, such as the blind and the\r\ndeaf.\r\n\r\nPOLICY OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TOWARD EDUCATION\r\n\r\nThe national government gave its first support to public education\r\nby the Ordinance of 1787 under which the Northwest Territory was\r\norganized. It provided that \"religion, morality, and knowledge\r\nbeing necessary government to good government and the happiness of\r\nmankind, schools and the means of education shall be forever\r\nencouraged.\" As new states were organized, sections of the public\r\nlands were to be reserved for school purposes. Grants of public\r\nland were also made for the establishment of agricultural colleges\r\nand experiment stations.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\nWe have also noted the national cooperation with the states for\r\nagricultural extension work and for vocational education. The\r\nUnited States Bureau of Education is under the direction of the\r\nUnited States Commissioner of Education. It has exerted its chief\r\ninfluence through its investigations of educational methods and\r\nits numerous reports and other publications. It serves as a sort\r\nof educational \"clearing house\" for local and state school\r\nauthorities. One of its chief endeavors has been to increase the\r\neducational opportunities in rural communities.\r\n\r\nReport on the following:\r\n\r\nProvisions of your state constitution with regard to education.\r\n\r\nCost of public schools per year to your community; your county;\r\nyour state.\r\n\r\nHow this cost is met in your town or county.

Of more than three million men\r\nbetween the ages of 21 and 31 examined for military service in\r\n1918, only about 65 per cent were passed as physically fit to\r\nfight for their country. [Footnote: Public Health Reports, U. S.\r\nPublic Health Service, vol. 34, No. 13, p. 633 (March 28, 1919).]\r\n\r\nThe remaining 35 per cent were either totally unfit for any kind\r\nof service, or were capable only of the less strenuous activities\r\nconnected with warfare. Most of the defects found could have been\r\nremedied, or prevented altogether, if proper care had been taken\r\nin earlier years.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL DEFECTS AND THE NATION'S INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe nation loses by this physical unfitness in other ways than in\r\nfighting power. Investigations have shown that wage earners lose\r\nfrom their work an average of from six to nine days each year on\r\naccount of sickness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Public Health Reports, U. S. Public Health Service,\r\nvol. 34, No. 16, pp. 777-782 (April 18, 1919).]\r\n\r\nThe cost to the individual in loss of wages, doctors' bills, and\r\notherwise, is a serious matter, to say nothing of the absolute\r\nwant to which it reduces many families and the suffering entailed.\r\nIn addition to this, the country loses the wage earner's\r\nproduction. Sometimes death brings to the family permanent loss of\r\nincome, and to the nation complete loss of the product of the wage\r\nearner's work. The nation spends large sums of money every year in\r\nproviding for dependent families and individuals.\r\n\r\nIf each of the 38 million wage earners in the United States in\r\n1910 lost 6 days from work in a year, how many days' work would\r\nthe nation lose? How many years of work would this amount to?\r\n\r\nAt $2.50 a day (is this a high wage?) how much would be lost in\r\nwages in a year?\r\n\r\nGet information regarding the cost of a long case of sickness,\r\nsuch as typhoid fever, in some family of your acquaintance\r\n(perhaps your own), including doctor's bills, medicines, time lost\r\nfrom work, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat would such expense mean to a family living on as low wages as\r\nthose mentioned on page 167?\r\n\r\nEDUCATION AND PHYSICAL DEFECTS\r\n\r\nMoreover, the nation loses a great deal (how much cannot be\r\ncalculated) from the physical unfitness of many who keep on\r\nworking, but who are not fully efficient because of bodily defects\r\nor ailments. We see the results of this even in school. Pupils who\r\nlag behind their mates in their studies are often suffering from\r\nphysical defects of which their teachers, and even they\r\nthemselves, may be unaware. It may be that they are ill-nourished,\r\nor that they have defective vision, or hearing, or teeth, or that\r\nthey sleep in poorly ventilated rooms. The community does not get\r\nits money's worth from its schools if its children are not in\r\nphysical condition to profit by them. In a similar manner earning\r\nand productive power are reduced.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL UNFITNESS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nIt has usually been assumed that the people in rural districts are\r\nmore healthy than those who live in cities; but it has been found\r\nthat there is as much physical unfitness there as elsewhere. It is\r\ntrue that the records of the war department seem to show fewer men\r\nrejected in rural districts as totally unfit for any kind of\r\nmilitary service; but evidence of other kinds has been collected\r\nthat indicates that some kinds of disease, at least, and many\r\nphysical defects are more prevalent in the country than in the\r\ncity. In THE LURE OF THE LAND, Dr. Harvey Wiley makes a comparison\r\nof the death rate from certain diseases in a few states where the\r\nfigures are available for both city and country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Dr. Harvey Wiley, THE LURE OF THE LAND, Chapter VIII,\r\n\"Health on the Farm,\" pp. 53-60.]\r\n\r\nRURAL AND CITY SCHOOL CHILDREN COMPARED\r\n\r\nStudies have been made of the comparative health of city and rural\r\nschool children, which show results in favor of the former. Of\r\n330,179 children examined in New York City 70 percent were found\r\ndefective, while of 294,427 examined in 1831 rural districts of\r\nPennsylvania 75 per cent were defective. The preceding chart shows\r\nthe comparative prevalence of health defects among city and\r\ncountry children.\r\n\r\nInvestigate the following:\r\n\r\nMeaning of \"vital statistics.\" Importance of vital statistics to\r\nyour community. Where recorded for your county or town. What the\r\nvital statistics of your community for the last year show.\r\n\r\nCauses of deaths in your community for the last year. The\r\npercentage of these deaths that were \"preventable.\" Increase or\r\ndecrease of death rate in your community during recent years, in\r\nyour state.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the prevailing sicknesses in your community during\r\nthe last year. Per cent of these that were contagious. List of\r\ncontagious diseases in the order of their prevalence.\r\n\r\nQuarantine regulations in your community against contagious\r\ndiseases. Extent to which they are observed. Who is responsible\r\nfor their observance? For their enforcement?\r\n\r\nObserve condition of sidewalks and other public places with\r\nrespect to expectoration. Is there a law on the subject in your\r\ncommunity'? Is it observed or enforced? Who is responsible?\r\nDangers from expectoration.\r\n\r\nMedical inspection in the schools of your county, town, and state.\r\nIf any, its results. Kinds of defects most commonly found. How is\r\nit conducted? Who sends the inspectors? To what extent the homes\r\nof the community cooperate with the schools in getting results\r\nfrom medical inspection.\r\n\r\nBETTER CONDITIONS IN CITIES DUE TO ORGANIZED TEAM WORK\r\n\r\nWe may well ask why ill health and physical defects seem to be\r\nmore prevalent in rural communities than in cities. The answer\r\nprobably is, simply, that in cities they are PREVENTED more\r\neffectively. The chart on page 313 shows that while the death rate\r\nin New York City was 20.6 per thousand in 1900, it had declined to\r\n14 per thousand in 1914; while that in the rural districts of New\r\nYork State remained practically the same during these years (15.5\r\nper thousand in 1900, 15.3 in 1914).\r\n\r\nThis indicates that health conditions in the city were originally\r\nmuch worse than in the country. They were rapidly improved by\r\norganization for health protection. There is not the occasion, in\r\nrural communities, for the elaborate health-protecting\r\norganization that is now found in all large cities, because the\r\npeople in rural communities are not so completely dependent upon\r\none another nor at the mercy of conditions over which, as\r\nindividuals, they have no control. And yet even in rural\r\ncommunities physical well-being depends largely upon organized\r\nteam work.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS AS AN AGENCY FOR HEALTH CONSERVATION\r\n\r\nCities have used their school organization to combat physical\r\ndefects and weaknesses of pupils, and that is why they make a\r\nbetter showing than rural communities in such matters as those\r\nshown in the table on page 312. Removing such defects from young\r\npeople means a stronger and more efficient adult population ten or\r\ntwenty years from now; for these defects are often the causes of\r\nmore serious illness in later years. The table on page 299,\r\nChapter XIX, shows how much behind cities rural communities have\r\nbeen in the use of their school organization for this purpose. The\r\nencouraging thing is, however, that rural communities are\r\nbeginning to find the means to use their schools in this way. The\r\nway has been opened by school consolidation (p. 295), by the\r\ngrouping of all the small and isolated schools of a county under a\r\ncentral county administration (p. 294), by aid from the state,\r\nboth in money and in supervision, and by cooperation from the\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\nHEALTH EDUCATION FOR ADULTS IN CITIES\r\n\r\nCities have extended their health-educational work to the adult\r\npopulation. This takes place in part through the schools also.\r\nInstruction given to children is of course taken home by them.\r\nVisiting nurses employed by the schools visit the homes. Classes\r\nfor mothers are conducted at the school in the afternoon or\r\nevening. But more than this, city boards of health, often in\r\ncooperation with the school authorities, conduct educational\r\ncampaigns by means of literature distributed to the homes through\r\nschool children, by means of evening lectures and moving pictures,\r\nand through the newspapers.\r\n\r\nAGENCIES FOR HEALTH EDUCATION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nMeans are not wanting for similar work in rural communities. The\r\nhomes may be reached by the right kind of instruction in the\r\nschools. The classes or clubs for women conducted by women county\r\nagents may be, and often are, used as means of health instruction.\r\nPublic meetings at the \"community center\" at the schoolhouse may\r\nbe devoted at times to public health problems, with lectures,\r\nmoving pictures, and discussions. The local newspapers always\r\nafford a channel through which to get matters of this kind before\r\nthe people. Local and state boards of health, the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, and the Public Health Service may and\r\ndo use these and other agencies to reach the people.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY OF THE HOME\r\n\r\nNo matter how much machinery for cooperation we may have in our\r\ncommunity, like that described above, it cannot help much unless\r\nevery family and every citizen cooperates intelligently.\r\n\r\nIn a large city, a small group of men, constituting the city\r\ncouncil, may inaugurate measures which will accomplish sanitary\r\nimprovements at thousands of homes; but for the accomplishment of\r\nsanitary improvements at 1000 farm homes at least 1000 persons ...\r\nmust be convinced that the sanitary measures are needed, become\r\ninformed how to apply them, and be willing to put them into\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: RURAL SANITATION, by L. L. Lumsden, Public Health\r\nBulletin No. 94, United States Public Health Service, p. 10.]\r\n\r\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF PURE AIR\r\n\r\nPure air is essential to good health. It is not always easy to get\r\nin the crowded living and working conditions of cities. There it\r\nis necessary to regulate these conditions by law, and factories\r\nand tenements are inspected to see that they are properly\r\nventilated and not overcrowded. In rural communities there is less\r\nexcuse for bad air, and the responsibility for it rests more\r\ndirectly upon the individual, as illustrated on page 112, Chapter\r\nX.\r\n\r\nBAD AIR AND THE SPREAD OF DISEASE\r\n\r\nIt might seem that it is nobody's business but our own how we live\r\nin our homes or at our work. But bad air lessens vitality and\r\nnurtures disease. This reduces productive power. Moreover, colds,\r\ninfluenza, and tuberculosis (of which more than a million people\r\nare constantly sick in the United States), all of which are\r\nnourished in bad air, may be spread by contact, or by food handled\r\nby those who are sick. People who live in bad air at home mingle\r\nwith others at church, in moving picture theaters, at school, in\r\nthe courtroom, and in other public meeting places, which are\r\nthemselves often poorly ventilated. It is strange that court\r\nrooms, where justice is administered, schools where children are\r\nprepared for life, and churches where people worship, are so often\r\nbadly ventilated.\r\n\r\nReport on the following:\r\n\r\nIs your schoolroom well ventilated? How do you know? What effect\r\ndoes poor ventilation have upon your feelings and your work?\r\n\r\nIf the law requires school attendance, why should it also require\r\ngood ventilation of the school?\r\n\r\nIf the ventilation of your school is not good, what may you do\r\nabout it? Who is responsible for it?\r\n\r\nObserve and report upon the ventilation of the court rooms, moving\r\npicture theaters, churches, and other meeting places in your\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nPURE WATER AND HEALTH\r\n\r\nCities go to great expense to get an abundant pure-water supply.\r\nIt is of the greatest importance in community sanitation Impure\r\nwater is one of the chief sources of typhoid fever and other\r\ndiseases of the intestines. About 400,000 persons have typhoid\r\nfever every year in the United States, and 30,000 are killed by\r\nit; and it is unnecessary. We have from three to five times as\r\nmuch typhoid as many European countries have, and for no other\r\nreason than that we are negligent.\r\n\r\nPURE FOOD AND HEALTH\r\n\r\nPure, clean, wholesome food is equally essential. We need not\r\ndwell upon the importance of the right kinds of food and well-\r\ncooked food. Much illness is caused by \"spoiled\" foods. Disease\r\ngerms may be carried by food as well as by water. Tuberculosis may\r\nbe carried by milk, either from diseased cattle, or from victims\r\nof the disease who handle the milk at some point in its progress\r\nfrom the dairy farm to the home. The death rate among babies is\r\nappalling, especially in cities, because of the use of milk\r\ncontaining germs of intestinal diseases. Typhoid fever may be\r\ncontracted from milk, green vegetables, and oysters from beds\r\ncontaminated with sewage.\r\n\r\nThe food supply of cities passes through many hands before it\r\nreaches the consumer. At almost every point it is protected by\r\nregulations and inspection. Most of it, however, comes originally\r\nfrom the farm which is beyond the control of the city authorities.\r\nThe producers and handlers of food products in rural districts\r\ntherefore owe it not only to themselves but also to their city\r\nneighbors to exercise every possible precaution against the spread\r\nof disease. Such precautions consist in cleanliness in handling\r\nand storing milk, butter, and meats; in the cleansing of milk\r\nreceptacles with pure water; in the proper location and\r\nconstruction of wells; in protecting springs from surface\r\ndrainage; in sanitary disposal of sewage and other wastes from the\r\nhousehold; in protection of food against flies.\r\n\r\nSANITATION IN CITIES\r\n\r\nIn cities a great deal of attention is given to sanitation. Sewage\r\nis carried off by public sewers. Householders are required to\r\nplace garbage in sanitary cans, whence it is collected and\r\ndisposed of in such a way as not to pollute the soil. Ashes and\r\nrefuse are carried away from homes and shops, and the streets are\r\ncleaned daily. In rural communities such matters are left almost\r\nentirely to the householder.\r\n\r\nFLIES AS DISEASE CARRIERS\r\n\r\nExposed garbage, improperly built outdoor toilets, and stable\r\nmanure are breeding places of flies; and flies are notorious\r\ncarriers of disease. Yet, out of more than 3000 homes in one\r\ncounty in Indiana only 31 made provision to prevent stable manure\r\nfrom breeding flies, and the same was true of only 1 out of more\r\nthan 2000 homes in a county in North Carolina, and only 86 out of\r\nnearly 5000 homes in an Alabama county.\r\n\r\nDANGER FROM MOSQUITOES\r\n\r\nMalaria is widespread in the United States and imposes a heavy\r\ntoll upon the nation's health. It is carried from one victim to\r\nanother by a certain kind of mosquito, of which it is\r\ncomparatively easy to get rid by proper drainage of breeding\r\nplaces, by treating the surface of pools with kerosene, by\r\nscreening, and by seeing to it that rain barrels are covered and\r\nthat tin cans and other receptacles of water are not left lying\r\naround. But flies and mosquitoes do not stop with fences, nor do\r\nthey recognize city or county boundaries. Hence, individual effort\r\nwithout community cooperation is likely to be useless.\r\n\r\nPOLLUTED SOIL AND HOOKWORM DISEASE\r\n\r\nThe terrible hookworm disease so prevalent in our southern states\r\nis caused by a minute worm that infests soil polluted with sewage.\r\nIt penetrates the soles of the feet of those who go barefoot and\r\nthe palms of the hands of those who work in the soils, finds its\r\nway through the blood to the intestines, and thence to the soil\r\nagain. An investigation in 770 counties in 11 states where\r\nhookworm disease is prevalent showed that out of 287,606 farm\r\nhomes only six tenths of one per cent disposed of their sewage in\r\nsuch a way as to prevent soil pollution.\r\n\r\nOut of 305 homes in a little community in Mississippi, only 4\r\nproperly disposed of sewage. When the first investigations were\r\nmade, there were 407 cases of hookworm disease out of 1002\r\nresidents. Besides, there had been recently 12 cases of\r\ntuberculosis, 47 of typhoid fever, 184 of malaria, and 384 of\r\ndysentery.\r\n\r\nSafe methods of disposing of sewage were introduced, houses were\r\nscreened, an artesian well was bored for a public water supply,\r\nand the community cleaned up generally. After these improvements\r\nthe various diseases almost entirely disappeared. Similar results\r\nwere obtained in 99 other communities in the southern states.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Report of the Rockefeller Foundation, 1917, pp. 136-\r\n138.]\r\n\r\nTopics for investigation:\r\n\r\nThe water supply of farms in your locality.

But many conditions affecting health have\r\narisen that the state cannot completely control. Chiefly under the\r\npower given to it by the Constitution to regulate foreign and\r\ninterstate commerce (p. 451), Congress has passed many laws that\r\nprotect health, placing their enforcement in the hands of the\r\nseveral departments of the national government.\r\n\r\nHEALTH WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture conducts much public health work,\r\nthrough its home demonstration agents, its Office of Rural\r\nEngineering, which deals with problems of farm water supply and\r\nrural sanitation, its Bureau of Entomology which wages war against\r\nflies and other disease-carrying insects, and its Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry which inspects cattle, meats, and dairy products. The\r\nDepartment of Agriculture also administers the Food and Drugs Act,\r\nthe purpose of which is to secure purity of food products and to\r\nrequire that they and medicinal drugs shall be labeled in such a\r\nway as to show what they contain. Fraudulent and harmful \"cures\"\r\nand \"patent medicines\" may thus be exposed.\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe United States Public Health Service investigates diseases and\r\nhealth conditions and the means of controlling them. It has given\r\nconsiderable attention to rural sanitation. It issues reports and\r\nother publications of great value to the citizen, some of them\r\nbeing listed at the end of this chapter. It has representatives in\r\nall important foreign ports, inspects all ships that enter\r\nAmerican harbors, and holds them in quarantine until they and\r\ntheir passengers are given a clean bill of health. Cholera and\r\nother dangerous diseases have thus been prevented from gaining a\r\nfoothold on American soil.\r\n\r\nHEALTH WORK OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS\r\n\r\nThe War Department has also waged a relentless warfare against\r\ndisease, not only in the army itself, but also in the Panama Canal\r\nZone, Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and other regions\r\noccupied by the army. The Department of Labor seeks to improve the\r\nphysical conditions of labor for both men and women, and its\r\nChildren's Bureau is charged with a study of all matters\r\npertaining to the welfare of children. In the Department of the\r\nInterior the Census Bureau collects national vital statistics; the\r\nBureau of Mines has done valuable work for the prevention of\r\naccidents in mines and mining industries; and the Bureau of\r\nEducation seeks to promote physical education, instruction in home\r\neconomics, and education in the home relating to the care of\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HEALTH PROTECTION\r\n\r\nA very large part of the duty of health protection must, however,\r\nremain with the states. Every state has its department of health,\r\nheaded by a state board of health, or a commissioner of health, or\r\nboth. These departments differ greatly in their organization and\r\nin the extent and effectiveness of their work.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK STATE ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nOne of the best organized state departments of health is that of\r\nNew York. Among its most important features are (1) a PUBLIC\r\nHEALTH COUNCIL which has power to establish a state-wide SANITARY\r\nCODE; (2) the concentration of all administrative power in the\r\nhands of a single state COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH, who has a staff of\r\nexperts to direct special lines of health work; and (3) a well-\r\norganized scheme of cooperation between the state department and\r\nlocal health authorities.\r\n\r\nLOCAL ORGANIZATION FOR HEALTH PROTECTION\r\n\r\nThe absence or weakness of local organization for health\r\nprotection has been one of the obstacles to progress in physical\r\nwell-being in the United States. Driven by an appalling death rate\r\nand frequent epidemics, our large cities have developed health\r\ndepartments which in many cases have proved very effective. But in\r\nsmaller communities, while health departments or health officers\r\nusually exist, the organization has for the most part been very\r\nineffective. The people themselves have not been sufficiently\r\naroused to their needs and to methods of meeting them. New York\r\nand Massachusetts are among the most progressive states in this\r\nmatter. Each local community in these states (town, village, or\r\nsmall city) has its board of health and health officer; but these\r\ncommunities are grouped into HEALTH DISTRICTS (8 in Massachusetts,\r\n20 in New York), each district being in charge of a health officer\r\nappointed by the state commissioner or board of health. In New\r\nYork the district health officer, who is there called the SANITARY\r\nSUPERVISOR, has the following duties:\r\n\r\nTo keep informed regarding the work of each local health officer\r\nwithin his sanitary district.\r\n\r\nTo aid the local health officers in making health surveys of the\r\ncommunity under their control.\r\n\r\nTo aid each local health officer in the performance of his duties,\r\nparticularly on the appearance of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nTo hold conferences of local health officers.\r\n\r\nTo study the causes of excessive death rates.\r\n\r\nTo promote efficient registration of births and deaths.\r\n\r\nTo inspect all labor camps and to enforce in them all public\r\nhealth regulations.\r\n\r\nTo inspect Indian reservations and to enforce all provisions of\r\nthe sanitary code in them.\r\n\r\nTo secure the cooperation of medical organizations for the\r\nimprovement of the public health.\r\n\r\nTo promote the information of the public in matters pertaining to\r\nthe public health.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\nAnother type of local health organization and of cooperation\r\nbetween local and state authorities for health protection and\r\npromotion has been developed in North Carolina, where 85 per cent\r\nof the population is rural. Here the county has been taken as the\r\nunit of local organization. Health conditions had been very bad in\r\nthis state, hookworm disease, tuberculosis, malaria, and other\r\ndiseases being prevalent. The state board of health, assisted by\r\nthe Rockefeller Sanitary Commission (see above, page 320, and\r\nreferences below), began an investigation and an educational\r\ncampaign among the people, with the result that many of the\r\ncounties of the state now have an organization for health\r\ncooperation unsurpassed, perhaps, in any other state. Each county\r\nhas a health department, which is controlled jointly by the state\r\nboard of health and a county board of health. The county board of\r\nhealth consists of the mayor of the county seat, the chairman of\r\nthe board of county commissioners, the county superintendent of\r\nschools, and two physicians of the county elected by the other\r\nthree members. The work of the health department is directed by a\r\ncounty health officer, who is appointed by the state board of\r\nhealth of which he is also a member. He has a staff of trained\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nIn this plan note the cooperation between state and local\r\ncommunities, between town and county officials, and between the\r\nschool authorities and the health organization. Note, also, the\r\nleadership of specialists in health matters.\r\n\r\nTopics for investigation:\r\n\r\nOrganization of the department of health in your community (both\r\ncounty and town): the board of health; the executive health\r\nofficer or officers; the kinds of work done.\r\n\r\nAmount of money spent by your local health department for all\r\npurposes and for each purpose separately.

Happiness\r\nIN work depends largely upon our freedom and ability to choose the\r\nkind of service for which we are best fitted, and upon the extent\r\nto which we prepare ourselves for it. It also depends to a large\r\nextent upon good health (p. 309).\r\n\r\nSATISFACTION OF HIGHER WANTS\r\n\r\nBut there never was a truer statement than that \"all work and no\r\nplay makes Jack a dull boy.\" In return for his work every citizen\r\nis entitled to enough compensation to enable him to provide not\r\nonly for the bare necessities of life, such as food and shelter,\r\nbut also for the pleasure that he derives from the satisfaction of\r\nhis higher wants, such as social life and recreation, an education\r\nthat will give him a richer enjoyment of life, pleasant\r\nsurroundings, religious advantages.\r\n\r\nEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY LIFE\r\n\r\nAll these things have much to do with our national well-being and\r\nour citizenship. Our nation is democratic only in proportion to\r\nthe equality of opportunity enjoyed by all citizens to satisfy\r\nthese wants. Moreover, the efficiency of each citizen in\r\nproductive work and as a participator in self-government depends\r\nmore than we sometimes think upon his opportunity to \"enjoy life\"\r\nin pleasant surroundings and in wholesome social relations. In the\r\npast the citizen has been left largely to his own resources and to\r\npurely voluntary cooperation to provide for these wants.\r\nGovernment has not even adequately PROTECTED his rights of this\r\nkind, to say nothing of positively PROMOTING them. At present,\r\nhowever, community team work through government is being organized\r\nas never before both to promote and to protect the interests of\r\nall citizens in the fullest possible enjoyment of life.\r\n\r\nRECREATION AND SOCIAL LIFE\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF PLAY\r\n\r\nChildren enjoy play because it satisfies physical, mental, and\r\nsocial wants. But it is also the principal means by which they\r\nprepare for the more serious duties of later life. It builds up\r\nhealth, trains the muscles and the senses, and sharpens the wits.\r\nIt gives practice in team work, develops leadership, and teaches\r\nthe value of \"rules of the game.\" Every child is entitled to an\r\nabundant opportunity to play, both because of the happiness it\r\naffords him and because by it he is trained for membership in the\r\ncommunity. It is to the interest of the community to afford him\r\nthe opportunity. It is largely for this reason that most of the\r\nstates protect children by law from being put to work for a living\r\nat too early an age.\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR PLAY IN CITIES\r\n\r\nIn large cities thousands of children live in crowded districts\r\nwhere there is no place to play except in the public streets. So\r\nlittle appreciative have we been of the importance of play in the\r\ndevelopment of young citizens that great numbers of city schools\r\nhave been built with no provision whatever for playgrounds. This\r\nmistake is slowly being corrected, often at great expense. No city\r\nschool is now considered first-class if it does not have an ample\r\nand well-equipped playground, with competent directors to teach\r\nchildren how to get the most out of their play. Most cities are\r\nalso establishing public playgrounds apart from the schools,\r\nsometimes under the management of the school board, but often\r\nunder that of a special playground or recreation commission.\r\n\r\nPLAY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nPlay for the children of rural communities is as important as for\r\nthose of cities, but even less attention has been given to it.\r\nMany a country school has no playground, and if it has one it is\r\nlikely to be small and not equipped with play apparatus. Why\r\nshould there be playgrounds when there is all outdoors in which to\r\nplay? Why should there be expensive play apparatus and play\r\ndirectors when boys and girls can get all the \"exercise\" they need\r\nat home or on the farm? \"Play\" means more than mere physical\r\nexercise, and must be pleasurable if it is to have value.\r\nOrganized play is as truly a means of education as any school\r\ninstruction, and must have competent leadership or direction. In\r\nrural districts, where the children live far apart, there is\r\nparticular need for a common meeting place for organized group\r\nplay, and the school is the most appropriate place for it.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT FOR SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION\r\n\r\nThe need for organized play in rural communities is one of the\r\nbest arguments for school consolidation, for it brings together\r\nlarger numbers and makes possible the employment of a competent\r\nplay director and the proper equipment of the playground. Teacher-\r\ntraining schools now make a point of training play leaders as well\r\nas teachers of arithmetic and geography.\r\n\r\nMEANING OF RECREATION\r\n\r\nAs children grow older, an increasing part of their time must be\r\ngiven to work--school work, tasks at home, remunerative employment\r\noutside of the home. After leaving school and throughout adult\r\nlife, work absorbs the major part of one's time and attention. But\r\neven then, \"all work and no play\" will continue to \"make Jack a\r\ndull boy.\" We now call play \"recreation,\" for by it body and mind\r\nand spirit are refreshed, renewed, RE-CREATED, after close\r\napplication to work. That is why school work is broken by\r\n\"recesses.\" Recreation is necessary as a means of providing for\r\nphysical, mental, and social wants; for the pleasure that it\r\naffords. But it is also important in its relation to work, for\r\nwithout it body and mind become \"fagged,\" people grow \"stale\" at\r\ntheir work, producing power and power of service are reduced.\r\n\r\nTHE HABIT OF PLAY\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to get out of the habit of play, and especially\r\ndifficult to form the habit in adult life if it has not been done\r\nin youth. People often become so absorbed in work that there seems\r\nto be no time for recreation. In such cases not only is the\r\nenjoyment of life narrowed, but there is a risk of damaging the\r\nquality of one's work and even of shortening one's life of\r\nproductive activity, or of service.\r\n\r\nLEISURE A REQUIREMENT\r\n\r\nEvery worker is entitled to opportunity for recreation, both for\r\nhis own sake and for the well-being of the community. This means,\r\nfirst of all, that he must have LEISURE for it. When people have\r\nto work hard for ten or twelve or more hours a day, year in and\r\nyear out, as was once customary in industry, there is neither time\r\nnor energy for wholesome recreation. That such conditions existed,\r\nand still exist to a considerable extent, is due to gross\r\nimperfections in the industrial organization of the community. One\r\nof the evidences of progress toward \"transmuting days of dreary\r\nwork into happier lives\" is the reduction in the hours of toil in\r\nmany industries, and the consequent increase of leisure for the\r\nenjoyment of life and for self-improvement.\r\n\r\nOne of the things for which labor unions have struggled is the\r\nshortening of the working day. Through their efforts, and through\r\nthe awakening of public interest and knowledge in regard to the\r\nmatter, the working day is now fixed by law at eight hours in most\r\nindustries, often with a half holiday on Saturdays. Experience has\r\nshown that this change has in no way reduced the product of\r\nindustry. There are still some industries, however, in which men\r\ntoil at the hardest kind of labor for twelve or more hours a day,\r\nsometimes even including Sundays.\r\n\r\nA LIVING WAGE A NECESSITY\r\n\r\nA second thing necessary to afford opportunity for recreation is\r\nan income from one's work sufficient to provide more than the bare\r\nnecessities of life. Before the war, it is said, more than five\r\nmillion families, or about one fourth of the families in the\r\nUnited States, were trying to live on a wage of $50 a month, or\r\nless. During the war, wages of skilled and unskilled labor shot\r\nupward; but so, also, did the cost of living. It is not easy to\r\ndetermine just what share of the proceeds of industry should, in\r\njustice, go to the laborer in wages. But it should be enough to\r\nprovide not only for food and clothing and shelter, but also for\r\ndecent family life, for healthful surroundings, for education for\r\nthe children, and for wholesome recreation.\r\n\r\nLabor unions and others interested in a fairer distribution of the\r\nproceeds of industry have long been working for the enactment of\r\n\"minimum wage laws,\" that is, laws fixing the least wage that may\r\nbe paid for each class of labor, this to be enough to provide a\r\nreasonable satisfaction of all the wants of life. Some states have\r\nalready enacted such laws, and during the recent war the federal\r\ngovernment in some cases fixed rates of wages, and appointed labor\r\nboards to adjust wages to the rising cost of living.\r\n\r\nTHE WISE USE OF LEISURE\r\n\r\nNeither leisure nor income, however, suffice for recreation unless\r\nthey are wisely used. Mere idleness is not recreation; and many\r\npeople use their leisure in DISSIPATION instead of in recreation.\r\n\"Dissipation\" is the opposite of thrift. It means to \"throw away,\"\r\nor to be wasteful. A person may \"dissipate\" his income. We have\r\ncome to understand the word \"dissipation,\" however, to mean\r\nexcessive indulgence in pleasures or amusements that are wasteful\r\nof time, energy, or health, or all three, and we call the person\r\n\"dissipated\" who is addicted to such indulgence. Any amusement,\r\neven though harmless in itself, may become dissipation if indulged\r\nin to excess, or at the sacrifice of other things that are better.\r\n\r\nRURAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECREATION\r\n\r\nOne of the principal disadvantages often put forward against life\r\nin rural communities is the lack of opportunity for recreation. It\r\npartly explains the difficulty of obtaining an abundance of farm\r\nlabor, and is one of the obstacles to inducing young people to\r\nremain on the farm. Unfortunately, too, the women on the farm have\r\noften been the chief sufferers from close confinement to the\r\ndrudgery of housework, with little opportunity for recreation and\r\nless chance than the men have to enjoy the companionship of other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe very nature of farming entails hard work and long hours,\r\nespecially at certain seasons. Under existing conditions it is\r\nhard to see how the farmer's working day could be limited to eight\r\nhours as in most other occupations.\r\n\r\nThe citizen farmer who lives in the same community with the miner ...\r\nmust invest in land and buildings, tools and livestock. He\r\nmust pay taxes and insurance and repairs and veterinary fees. He\r\nmust work often sixteen hours, seldom less than ten, and he must\r\nbe on duty day and night, ready always to care for his independent\r\nplant--all this, and yet in order to receive a labor income equal\r\nto that of the soft coal miner ... the farmer must not only work\r\nhimself as no professional laborer ever works, but he must also\r\nwork his children without pay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: E. Davenport, Dean of the College of Agriculture,\r\nUniversity of Illinois, in \"Proceedings of the First National\r\nCountry Life Conference,\" Baltimore, 1919. p. 183.]\r\n\r\nIMPROVED CONDITIONS ON THE FARM\r\n\r\nAlthough this only too faithfully describes living conditions on\r\nthe farm as they have been in the past and still are in many\r\ncases, much improvement has taken place. Improvement of\r\nagricultural machinery and methods has brought a greater measure\r\nof leisure to the farmer, while better means of transportation and\r\ncommunication have both saved him time and made easier for him and\r\nhis family association with other people and the enjoyment of\r\nentertainment in the neighboring village or city. The farm woman\r\nhas benefited by the introduction of labor-saving devices and\r\nbetter management in the household, and by the development of\r\ncommunity cooperation in such matters as dairying and laundry work\r\n(see pp. 106, 107). In fact, better team work in every phase of\r\nthe business of agriculture means greater opportunity for the\r\nenjoyment of living, and the efforts of the national and state\r\ngovernments to encourage such team work and to improve the methods\r\nof agriculture have for their purpose not merely the increase of\r\nthe agricultural product, but also the greater happiness of the\r\nrural citizen.\r\n\r\nFACILITIES FOR DISSIPATION\r\n\r\nWhen leisure may be found for recreation, the facilities for it\r\nare often inadequate. The city, and even the village, affords\r\nfacilities for amusement and social enjoyment that good roads,\r\nautomobiles, and trolley lines have made more accessible than\r\nformerly to the country round about. While the urban community\r\nnaturally affords greater opportunity than the rural community for\r\nsocial recreation, its opportunities for dissipation are equally\r\ngreat. \"Going to the movies\" may be a real recreation, or it may\r\nbecome a dissipation when indulged in to excess without\r\ndiscrimination as to the merit of the performance. Almost every\r\nvillage has its well-known \"loafing places,\" and the saloon used\r\nto be a favorite meeting place for certain classes of people.\r\nAmusements that are especially harmful are more or less regulated\r\nby law. Even moving pictures are \"censored.\" Saloons have now been\r\ntotally abolished.\r\n\r\nFACILITIES FOR RECREATION\r\n\r\nThe most effective preventive of dissipation is ample provision\r\nfor wholesome recreation. Various agencies in urban communities\r\nseek to supply this need, both for their own residents and for\r\nvisitors from outside. Men's clubs, such as chambers of commerce,\r\nafford social and amusement advantages for the business men of the\r\ntown, and for visiting farmers who formerly met only at the store\r\nor courthouse, in the saloon or on the street corner. Public\r\nlibraries, often with the cooperation of women's clubs, provide\r\n\"rest rooms,\" arranged for the comfort and entertainment of\r\nvisiting women, and afford means of profitable and enjoyable\r\nrecreation for young people. Town churches sometimes maintain\r\nsocial rooms, open during the week for similar purposes. The Young\r\nMen's and Young Women's Christian Associations have performed a\r\ngreat service by providing entertainment and social life for young\r\npeople. One of the more recent developments is the \"community\r\ncenter,\" usually at the schoolhouse, where there are offered\r\nlectures and concerts, social entertainments, dances, games, and\r\nsports. In some large cities such \"recreation centers\" are of the\r\ngreatest value in the crowded districts.\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL\r\n\r\nRural communities have suffered from a dearth of recreational\r\nfacilities of their own, especially of a SOCIAL type. One of the\r\nmost promising influences to supply this deficiency is the\r\nCONSOLIDATED SCHOOL, which makes provision for assembly halls,\r\nsocial gatherings, and recreation grounds for young and old alike.\r\nAn illustration of this is given in Chapter XIX (p. 296).\r\nDevelopment of community recreation centers at consolidated rural\r\nschools is going on rapidly in many parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIowa affords a striking example of this. In that state more than\r\n2000 one-room country schools have been consolidated into\r\nsomething more than 300, and consolidation is still going on. Some\r\nof these consolidated schools have five acres of land, where\r\nprovision is made, not only for gardening and farming activities,\r\nbut also for picnic grounds and for fields for athletic sports and\r\ncontests. The buildings contain assembly halls, gymnasiums, and\r\nkitchens where food is prepared for social entertainments as well\r\nas for school lunches and for the teaching of cooking.\r\n\r\nNEED FOR LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\nOne of the chief obstacles to the development of rural community\r\nrecreation has been the absence of leadership. The consolidated\r\nschool helps to remedy this. Other agencies, however, are doing\r\nsomething to provide such leadership, among the most active of\r\nwhich is the county work department of the Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation, which has organized county-wide athletic associations\r\nand rural play festivals and field days in many localities.\r\n\r\nKNOWING HOW TO USE OPPORTUNITIES\r\n\r\nThere are agencies, or organizations, in almost every community\r\nthat could and should serve recreational ends. The trouble with\r\nmany of us is not so much the lack of time or of the means for\r\nrecreation, but a lack of knowledge of how to get the most out of\r\nour recreational opportunities. Hence the need for leadership.\r\nHence, also, the need for an education that will open up to us new\r\navenues of enjoyment. Recreation may be obtained not only from\r\nathletic sports and social entertainments, but from the fields and\r\nwoods, from books and music and pictures, even from VARIETY IN OUR\r\nWORK, if we only knew how to find it. The school is under as great\r\nobligation to provide us with an education that will teach us this\r\nas it is to equip us to earn a living.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for play in your community.\r\n\r\nThe forms of play most prevalent in your community.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which play in your community develops team work and\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nHow your school playground could be improved.\r\n\r\nPlay as a means of education in your school.\r\n\r\nAgencies besides the school that afford opportunity for play in\r\nyour community.\r\n\r\nLeisure on the farms of your locality: for men; for women; for\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nCould an eight-hour day be applied to farming in your locality?\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nLength of the working day for different employments in your town\r\nor neighboring city.\r\n\r\nMinimum wage laws in your state.\r\n\r\nRecreational facilities and agencies in your community.\r\n\r\nCommunity centers in your community and their activities.\r\n\r\nThe value of a county field day in your community.\r\n\r\nMeaning of the statement that \"the boy without a playground is\r\nfather to the man without a job.\"\r\n\r\nATTRACTIVE SURROUNDINGS\r\n\r\nAPPRECIATION OF THAT WHICH IS BEAUTIFUL\r\n\r\nBeauty in one's surroundings adds much to the enjoyment of life,\r\nand therefore, also, to one's efficiency in work and as a citizen.\r\n\r\nPeople are often apparently blind to the beauty that is around\r\nthem. \"Having eyes, they see not; and ears, they hear not.\" Those\r\nwho live in the open country are surrounded by natural beauties of\r\nwhich city dwellers are largely deprived. Too often, however, they\r\nare unconscious of them or indifferent to them. To the hard-\r\nworking farmer a gorgeous sunset may be little more than a sign of\r\nthe weather on the morrow, and the beauty of a field of wheat or\r\ncorn may be lost in the thought of the toil that has gone into it,\r\nor of the dollars that may come out of it. Fortunate is the rural\r\ndweller whose toil and isolation are tempered by an appreciation\r\nof the beauties of the natural world about him!\r\n\r\nITS CULTIVATION\r\n\r\nLove for and appreciation of that which is beautiful may be\r\ncultivated. It is a part of one's education. The schools now give\r\nmore attention to it than formerly; but many of them do not yet\r\ngive enough. Appreciation of beauty is cultivated not merely by\r\ninstruction in \"art,\" but also by those studies that increase\r\none's knowledge of the common things about us. The teaching of\r\nagriculture and of science has a very practical purpose; but its\r\npurpose is only partly accomplished if it teaches us how to raise\r\ncorn or cotton without opening our eyes to the wonders of nature\r\ninvolved in the process.\r\n\r\nAn appreciation of beauty may be cultivated, also, by association\r\nwith it, as it may be destroyed by constant association with that\r\nwhich is ugly. People who live in unkempt and slovenly\r\nsurroundings are likely to become indifferent to them. It is the\r\nduty of every one to have a care for the appearance of his\r\nsurroundings both because of its effect upon himself and its\r\ninfluence upon others.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF APPEARANCES\r\n\r\nA stranger who visits our school is likely to judge it, first of\r\nall, by its appearance. He will note whether or not the building\r\nis in good repair, the condition of the grounds and fences, the\r\npresence or absence of flower beds, shrubs, and trees. Inside, he\r\nwill observe the cleanliness and orderliness of the room, the\r\ndecorations on the walls, the presence or absence of pictures and\r\nflowers and plants; yes, and also the care the pupils and teacher\r\ntake of their personal appearance. These things are signs to the\r\nvisitor of the interest taken by pupils, school authorities, and\r\nthe community in their school. They are also signs of the\r\ncharacter of the work done in the school, and of the happiness of\r\nthe pupils.\r\n\r\nA COMMUNITY JUDGED BY APPEARANCES\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, the visitor to your community will form his\r\nfirst opinion of it by its appearance. He will note, first of all\r\nthe appearance of the homes, and then, probably, the cleanliness\r\nand state of repair of the streets or roads. He will observe the\r\ncondition of the fences, and whether or not the weeds are cut\r\nalong the roads. He will notice, also, the extent to which the\r\npeople love flowers, and care for trees and vacant lots. All of\r\nthese things will be signs to him of the prosperity, the\r\nhappiness, the \"community spirit,\" of the citizens. They will\r\ndoubtless enter into his decision as to whether or not he cares to\r\nlive, or establish a business, or educate his children, in that\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY INTEREST IN BEAUTY\r\n\r\nIn cities a good deal of attention is usually given to such\r\nmatters, and laws exist, with government officers to administer\r\nthem, for the protection and promotion of community beauty. In\r\nrural communities these matters are left more largely to\r\nindividual initiative and voluntary cooperation. It becomes a\r\nmatter of public interest and spirit on the part of the individual\r\nand the family. It is true that some things are done through\r\ngovernment authorities, as in the improvement of the roads and the\r\nbuilding of bridges and culverts that are of pleasing design as\r\nwell as serviceable. In some New England \"towns\" there are \"town\r\nplanning\" boards, which carefully plan for the laying out of\r\nstreets and their improvement, the proper location of public\r\nbuildings and the style of architecture to be used, the location\r\nand development of parks and playgrounds, the enactment of\r\nsuitable housing laws, and other matters pertaining to the beauty\r\nof the community as well as to the well-being of its citizens.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY PLANNING\r\n\r\nSystematic planning of rural communities with a view to making\r\nthem beautiful has not been carried very far in this country. In\r\nfact, as one travels over a large part of the United States one is\r\nimpressed by the monotonous and unattractive character of the\r\ntowns and villages. This is not true everywhere, for in some parts\r\nof the country, usually those that have been settled longest, one\r\nsees beautiful villages that fit harmoniously into the landscape.\r\nBut over large areas of the country it seems that wherever man has\r\ngone he has marred the beauty of nature.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF EXAMPLE\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in which the influence of example is so quickly\r\nseen as in matters relating to appearance. People are prone to\r\ncopy their neighbors in matters of style, whether it be in dress\r\nor in architecture.\r\n\r\nIn one rather wretched community a few boys who were studying\r\ncivics sought permission to lay sod in the dooryard of a tenement\r\nhouse. Having obtained permission and laid the sod, it was not\r\nlong before some one else in the neighborhood did likewise, and\r\nsoon people all around were sodding their yards or sowing grass\r\nseed. Then they began to repair and paint their fences and\r\notherwise \"tidy up\" their places, until the whole neighborhood was\r\ntransformed in appearance. It is interesting to note, also, that\r\nas the community improved in appearance, it also became less\r\nlawless than it had been.\r\n\r\nThis is one phase of community life in which it is easy to\r\nestablish leadership, and in which young people can perform\r\nvaluable civic service and contribute materially toward\r\n\"transmuting days of dreary work into happier lives.\"\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe natural beauty of your community.\r\n\r\nHow natural beauty has been destroyed in your community.\r\n\r\nHow natural beauty has been preserved in your community.\r\n\r\nOur national parks.\r\n\r\nHow your school promotes the love for beauty.\r\n\r\nHow your school could be made more beautiful.\r\n\r\nHow you and your schoolmates could make your school more\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nWhat impression a stranger would get of your community from its\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe features in the appearance of your community of which you are\r\nproud. Those of which you are ashamed.\r\n\r\nAgencies that exist in your community to promote its beauty\r\n\r\nWays in which you can participate in making your community more\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS LIFE AND AGENCIES\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT AND RELIGION\r\n\r\nIn some countries church and state are inseparably bound together.\r\nBefore the recent war the Russian Czar was also the head of the\r\nRussian church. In our own country in colonial times, no citizen\r\nwas permitted to vote in the New England town meeting who did not\r\nbelong to the Puritan church of the community. This religious\r\nqualification for participation in government was in the course of\r\ntime dispensed with, and one of the fundamental principles of our\r\ndemocracy is that every citizen shall have complete liberty of\r\nreligious belief. Our government exercises no control over the\r\nreligious life of the people other than to guarantee this liberty.\r\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\r\nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\" (United States\r\nConstitution, Amendment I). State constitutions contain similar\r\nguarantees. To prevent government interference with religion,\r\nreligious institutions are exempt from taxation.\r\n\r\nRELIGION A MEANS OF CONTROL\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the church and other religious institutions are\r\nan important means of community control. They do not exercise this\r\ncontrol through government, but through the influence of their own\r\nbeliefs and organization upon the conduct of their members. If\r\neverybody should live in accordance with the Golden Rule, there\r\nwould be no need for government as a means of repression, but only\r\nas a means of performing service.\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AN OBSTACLE TO TEAM WORK\r\n\r\nOne of the unfortunate things about the church has been the fact\r\nthat more or less important differences in religious belief have\r\ntended to break up the community into numerous religious groups,\r\nor churches. This may be necessary in purely religious matters,\r\nbut it has too often happened that the people have allowed their\r\nreligious differences to prevent united action in other matters of\r\ncommon interest to the entire community. In some cases communities\r\nhave been broken up into rival, or even hostile, factions because\r\nof this. There is, however, a growing tolerance of one religious\r\nsect or denomination by others, which is in accord with the\r\nChristian spirit, and is necessary if community life is to be well\r\ndeveloped. It often happens that there are more churches of the\r\nsame denomination in a community than it can support. In such\r\ncases, at least, there is need for church consolidation similar to\r\nthe consolidation of schools, and for the same reason.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL SERVICE OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe church may be, and often is, an important agency in the\r\ncommunity for the performance of services other than that of\r\nministering to the religious wants of the people. Or, to speak\r\nmore correctly, it has realized more or less fully that the\r\nreligious wants of the people are closely bound up with their\r\nother wants, and seeks to minister to these other wants as a part\r\nof its religious duty. Thus, we find the church growing more\r\nactive in looking after the health interests, educational\r\ninterests, and social and recreational interests of its members\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe number of religious denominations having churches in your\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe number of churches in each denomination.\r\n\r\nMembership and attendance in the churches of your community.\r\n\r\nArguments for and against church consolidation in your community.\r\n\r\nActivities of churches in your community, other than religious.\r\n\r\nReligious organizations other than churches in your community.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nIn LESSONS IN COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE:\r\n\r\nSeries A:  Lesson 27, Concentration of social institutions (including the\r\n                      school and the church).\r\n\r\nSeries B:  Lesson 12, Impersonality of modern life.\r\n           Lesson 20, The church as a social institution.\r\n           Lesson 29, Labor organizations.\r\n\r\nSeries C:  Lesson 11, The effects of machinery on rural life.\r\n           Lesson 29, Child labor.\r\n           Lesson 32, Housing for workers.\r\n\r\n\"Sources of Information on Play and Recreation,\" by Lee F.

Both are\r\npeculiarly dependent upon others, though the aged may, by thrift\r\nin earlier years, have acquired a competence with which to meet\r\nthe needs of old age; and the young are expected, in later years,\r\nto compensate the community for the care they have received from\r\nothers during childhood.\r\n\r\nThere are those, also, of all ages, who are incapacitated for\r\nself-support and for service by disease, or by physical or mental\r\ndefects such as bodily deformities, blindness, or feeble-\r\nmindedness. In addition, there are some who, though physically\r\nable to perform service, deliberately prey upon the community in\r\none manner or another without giving anything in return. The\r\nlatter constitute the DELINQUENT class, and include criminals.\r\n\r\nRELATION OF THE FAMILY TO THE PROBLEM\r\n\r\nNormally, the needs of those who are unable to support themselves,\r\nwhether because of extreme youth or old age or because of physical\r\nor mental defects, are provided for by the family. It frequently\r\nhappens, however, that the family is unable to perform this\r\nservice. It may be entirely broken up. Children may be left\r\nwithout parents, and the aged without children. The natural\r\nsupporters of the family may be stricken by disease, or by\r\naccident, or by financial misfortune. Moreover, the proper care\r\nand treatment of many defectives require better facilities and\r\ngreater skill than can be provided even by well-to-do families.\r\nThus a class of DEPENDENTS is produced--dependents upon the\r\ncommunity as a whole. They may or may not be DEFECTIVES, physical\r\nor mental. Dissipation and thriftlessness are two of the chief\r\ncauses of dependency.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT IN EARLY TIMES\r\n\r\nIn the lower stages of civilization it was not uncommon for the\r\nfeeble and the helpless to be put to death, even sickly children\r\nand persons infirm from old age. This was done in the name of\r\ncommunity interest. The struggle for existence was so severe that\r\nthe presence of non-producing or non-fighting members endangered\r\nthe entire group. Besides, it was the belief in most cases that\r\nthe sacrifice of the helpless simply hastened their passage into a\r\nhappier life.\r\n\r\nREDUCING THE WASTAGE OF HUMAN LIFE\r\n\r\nHumane considerations now prevent such treatment of the helpless.\r\nMoreover, with our increased skill in medicine and surgery and\r\neducation, the diseased and defective may often be restored to\r\nhealth or fitted for some form of self-support that makes them\r\nhappier and of use to the community. The wastage of human life has\r\nbeen greatly reduced in recent years. Many of the soldiers who\r\nreturned from the war in Europe so broken in body or mind that in\r\nformer times they would have dragged out the remainder of their\r\nlives a burden to themselves and to others have, by surgical skill\r\nand special forms of education, been restored wholly or partially\r\nto the ranks of the self-supporting and useful members of the\r\ncommunity. This REHABILITATION of the dependent and defective\r\nmembers of the community, whether their misfortune is due to war\r\nor other causes, is the chief aim of the treatment given them by\r\nthe community at the present time.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY OF EACH COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nIt is an accepted principle that each community should, so far as\r\npossible, care for its own unfortunates, and the effectiveness\r\nwith which it is done varies. But everywhere it has taken a long\r\ntime to change from the old policy of mere RELIEF to the new\r\npolicy of REHABILITATION (see above).\r\n\r\nTHE LOCAL ALMSHOUSE AND ITS DEFECTS\r\n\r\nIn New England and in a few other states the town, or township, is\r\nthe unit for administering \"poor relief,\" but elsewhere it is the\r\ncounty. The \"almshouse,\" or \"poor farm,\" or \"county infirmary\" is\r\nthe usual local institution for this purpose. Unfortunately it has\r\nbeen, as a rule, badly managed. Men and women, old people and\r\nchildren, healthy and diseased, blind and crippled, moral and\r\nimmoral, even the insane, have been housed together, often\r\nmingling with one another with little restriction. The evils of\r\nsuch a system are apparent.\r\n\r\nSHORT-SIGHTED POLICY\r\n\r\nMoreover, the policy of the typical almshouse has been merely to\r\ngive shelter and food and clothing to those who appeal for it,\r\nrather than to remedy the causes of dependency or to restore the\r\nunfortunate to a basis of self-support and usefulness. Medical\r\ntreatment is of course given, but the means do not exist to give\r\nspecial expert treatment to particular classes of defectives.\r\nLittle educational opportunity worthy of the name is afforded.\r\nWhile able-bodied inmates usually have some work to do, it is\r\nseldom of a character to train for self-support or to create\r\nhabits of industry.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES PROPOSED\r\n\r\nTo provide this special treatment requires elaborate equipment and\r\nexpert service, which cost a great deal of money, more than most\r\ncounties or towns feel that they can afford. Communities must come\r\nto realize that they cannot afford to neglect their unfortunate\r\nmembers, no matter what it costs to care for them. But the cost\r\nneed not be so great as it seems. A great deal of money is now\r\nWASTED on almshouses without adequate results. This can largely be\r\nremedied by insisting upon more expert supervision in such\r\ninstitutions, and by a system of regular inspection by expert\r\nstate officers. Greater care should be exercised with respect to\r\nthose who are admitted to the institutions. Only the deserving\r\nshould be allowed to live on the public funds. It is not uncommon\r\nfor some classes of shiftless people to make a practice of seeking\r\nshelter in the almshouse during the winter, where they live in\r\ncomparative comfort and idleness at the public expense, only to\r\nleave in the spring for a life of aimless indolence, imposing as\r\nbeggars upon kind-hearted people.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE OF STATE INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nMoreover, the county almshouse should be only a temporary place of\r\ndetention for many of the people who now are kept there\r\npermanently. Those who need special treatment or training should\r\nbe passed on as quickly as possible to special institutions that\r\nare equipped to care for them. Since most local communities could\r\nnot well afford to maintain such special institutions for the\r\ncomparatively few who would need them, the state should maintain\r\nenough of them at central points to provide for the needs of all\r\nlocal communities.\r\n\r\nThe states do maintain such institutions--hospitals and\r\nsanitariums for various types of mental disease, homes for orphans\r\nand for the aged, and for persons with incurable diseases, asylums\r\nand schools for the blind and the deaf-and-dumb, industrial\r\nschools for boys and girls. The problem of the state is, first, to\r\ndevelop such institutions to the highest possible degree of\r\nefficiency for the REHABILITATION of their patients or inmates,\r\nand, second, to secure effective cooperation on the part of local\r\nauthorities and institutions in transferring those, and only\r\nthose, who are entitled to state assistance.\r\n\r\nCOOPERATION FOR \"OUTDOOR\" RELIEF\r\n\r\nWhen dependents are cared for in institutions, it is called INDOOR\r\nRELIEF; when they are cared for outside of institutions, in their\r\nhomes, it is called OUTDOOR RELIEF. Outdoor relief requires\r\ncommunity organization and cooperation and expert leadership quite\r\nas much as indoor relief. The lack of these has often resulted in\r\ngreat harm both to the community and to the needy person.\r\nPromiscuous giving of charity by well-intentioned persons often\r\nresults in giving to the undeserving as well as to the deserving.\r\nThere are lazy and shiftless individuals who find it easier to\r\nlive on charity than by honest work, and whose lack of self-\r\nrespect permits them to do so. Sometimes they do so by fraudulent\r\nmethods. Giving to such persons encourages pauperism and fraud\r\ninstead of curing it. Kind-hearted people often say that they\r\nwould rather be cheated occasionally by dishonest applicants for\r\ncharity than to fail to help the really needy by too great\r\ncaution. The answer to this is that by proper community\r\norganization and cooperation the needy will be found with much\r\ngreater certainty, the fraudulent will be detected, and the aid\r\ngiven to those who should have it will be much more effective. The\r\ncitizen who turns an applicant for aid over to an effective\r\norganization in a great majority of cases performs a much greater\r\nservice both to the applicant and to the community than by\r\nattempting to give aid directly. A few pennies or a few dollars\r\ngiven even to a worthy applicant may not reach the root of the\r\ntrouble at all, and may be the innocent cause of perpetuating the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTARY AGENCIES\r\n\r\nMany voluntary organizations exist for charitable and\r\nphilanthropic purposes. The church has always been one of the\r\nchief agencies to care for the poor and unfortunate; but there are\r\nmany others, especially in our large cities. Sometimes they\r\nmaintain hospitals and other institutions for the treatment of\r\nthose who need indoor relief. They have done a great deal of good.\r\nBut they are subject to the same difficulties that individuals\r\nencounter in dealing wisely with particular cases. They have often\r\ndevoted themselves too exclusively to giving temporary relief\r\ninstead of seeking to cure causes and to rehabilitate the\r\nunfortunate. They are frequently deceived by impostors. Seldom do\r\nthey have expert investigators to follow up individual cases and\r\nto prescribe the most effective remedy. They frequently duplicate\r\none another's work in a wasteful manner.\r\n\r\nCHARITY ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThis lack of team work has been in large measure remedied,\r\nespecially in city communities, by the establishment of CHARITY\r\nORGANIZATION SOCIETIES. Such societies do not as a rule give\r\ndirect relief, but act as a \"clearing house\" for existing\r\ncharitable agencies in the community. That is, they organize the\r\neffort of the various existing agencies. They have a corps of\r\ntrained investigators who look into each case reported by any\r\nindividual or charitable agency in the community, make a careful\r\nrecord of it, and prescribe the proper treatment. The case is\r\nusually turned over to one of the existing agencies that is\r\nproperly equipped to handle it. Philanthropic persons may turn to\r\nthe charity organization society for advice as to purposes for\r\nwhich money is most needed. The aim of charity organization is to\r\nremedy causes of dependency and to restore dependents to a self-\r\nsustaining basis so far as that is possible.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION FOR POOR RELIEF\r\n\r\nCharity organization societies are wholly voluntary organizations;\r\nand there is need for such voluntary cooperation to care for the\r\ncommunity's unfortunate and to root out the causes of dependency.\r\nSuch organizations should, however, work in cooperation with\r\ngovernmental agencies. There are state boards of charities which\r\nusually have supervision over the various state institutions for\r\ndependents and defectives. Every large city government has its\r\ndepartment of charities, sometimes combined with the department of\r\nhealth. The \"overseer of the poor\" is one of the oldest of town\r\nofficers. The care of dependents and defectives in small, or\r\nrural, communities has, however, been very poorly organized.\r\n\r\nRELATION BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nAn effective attack upon the public welfare problems of a state is\r\ntwofold: (1) by a state welfare board and state welfare\r\ninstitutions, and (2) by town and county welfare boards and\r\ninstitutions... .\r\n\r\nPublic welfare work calls for a state board of public welfare,\r\nstatewide in authority ... and for state institutions that are\r\nlarge enough to care for the delinquents, the dependents, the\r\ndefectives, and the neglected who cannot be better cared for by\r\nlocal authority and institutions. ...\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, it calls for county boards of public\r\nwelfare with county-wide authority and trained executive\r\nsecretaries. ... Many of our ills bulk up so big that they can be\r\nsuccessfully attacked only in detail by local interest, local\r\neffort, and local institutions. Tuberculosis and poverty are\r\ncapital instances of social problems that are beyond the\r\npossibilities of state institutions, and that necessarily wait\r\nupon organized county efforts of effective sort. ... We do not\r\nknow the deaf, the blind, the feeble-minded, the epileptic, the\r\ncrippled, and the neglected or wayward boys and girls--their\r\nnumber, their names, and their residences in any county of the\r\nstate ... because there is at present no local organization\r\ncharged with the responsibility of accounting for such\r\nunfortunates. ...\r\n\r\n[Footnote: E. C. Branson, \"County responsibility for public\r\nwelfare,\" in the North Carolina Club YEAR BOOK, 1917-1918, pp.\r\n161, 162 (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N. C.).]\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF DEPENDENCY MUST BE REMOVED\r\n\r\nThere will doubtless always be some dependent and defective\r\nmembers of the community for whom the community must care. Their\r\nnumber, however, may be greatly reduced by creating conditions\r\nthat will remove their causes. It has been reported from many\r\nlocalities, for example, that the prohibition of the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquors has resulted in the emptying of the \"work\r\nhouses\" which communities have sustained for the confinement of\r\nvagrants and persons convicted of petty misdemeanors. Much\r\ndependency has resulted from the crippling of wage earners by\r\nindustrial accidents and from \"industrial diseases\" arising from\r\nwork in unwholesome conditions. These causes may be removed by the\r\nmaintenance of wholesome working conditions, by the installation\r\nof safety devices, and by the exercise of greater care by workers\r\nand employers. The \"safety first\" movement strikes at the root of\r\nmuch dependency. Inability to read signs and to understand\r\ninstructions on the part of illiterate and foreign workers is the\r\ncause of many accidents.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL INSURANCE\r\n\r\nSome states have passed \"employers' liability laws,\" designed to\r\nhold employers responsible for accidents resulting from failure to\r\nprovide safe working conditions. Others have \"workmen's\r\ncompensation laws\" which provide that an injured workman shall\r\nreceive a portion of his wages during incapacity from accident or\r\nillness. In some countries various forms of COMPULSORY STATE\r\nINSURANCE have been adopted. Germany, for example, has long had\r\nlaws requiring employees to take out accident insurance and\r\ninsurance against sickness, both employees and employers\r\ncontributing to the insurance fund. Pensions for the aged and for\r\nwidows are also provided for, the government itself contributing\r\nto the fund for this purpose. At the close of the year 1919, 39 of\r\nour 48 states had laws providing for aid by the state to mothers\r\nwho were unable to provide properly for their children.\r\n\r\nThe aim in our community life should be as far as possible to\r\nPREVENT dependency and not merely to relieve suffering after it\r\noccurs. We shall find that the problem will tend to disappear in\r\nproportion as we develop in our communities adequate provision for\r\nhealth protection and physical development (Chapter XX), for\r\nvocational and general education (Chapter XIX), for wholesome\r\nrecreation (Chapter XXI), for the cultivation of habits of thrift\r\n(Chapter XIII); and as we are successful in producing a right\r\nattitude toward the problem of earning a living and wholesome\r\nrelations between employer and employee (Chapter XI).\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe rehabilitation of crippled soldiers after the war.\r\n\r\nYour county or town almshouse or poor farm: The kinds of cases\r\nsheltered there; its cost to the community; the methods of\r\ntreatment employed.\r\n\r\nOther local institutions for indoor relief in your community.\r\n\r\nState institutions for the care of dependents and defectives in\r\nyour state.

It is said, also, that to support and\r\ncontrol this criminal class costs the people of the United States\r\nnot less than $600,000,000 per annum, or as much as is expended\r\nfor the entire educational system of the country.\r\n\r\nWHAT CRIME IS\r\n\r\nCrime is the violation of law. The criminal is a member of the\r\ncommunity who refuses to cooperate with others in accordance with\r\nthe law. The conduct of an individual may be wrong and harmful to\r\nthe community without being criminal; it becomes criminal only\r\nwhen the law actually forbids it. A given act may be a crime in\r\none state and not in another state, because the laws of the states\r\ndiffer in their definition of crimes. They also differ in the\r\npenalties imposed for the same crime.\r\n\r\nEARLY METHODS OF TREATING CRIMINALS\r\n\r\nThe methods of dealing with criminals have changed greatly with\r\nthe progress of civilization, and especially in recent years since\r\nthe causes of crime have become better understood. In the earlier\r\nmethods two ideas were prominent: the infliction of punishment,\r\nand the deterrence of others from committing the same offense. The\r\npenalties inflicted were therefore very severe. The death penalty\r\nwas inflicted not only for taking human life but also for minor\r\noffenses, such as stealing. Even in our own country in colonial\r\ntimes bodily mutilation was not uncommon, such as branding with a\r\nhot iron, or cutting off the ears. Prisons were vile and loathsome\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nREHABILITATION OF CRIMINALS\r\n\r\nHumane feelings have caused the abandonment of such treatment. The\r\ndeath penalty still remains for the worst of crimes; but even it\r\nhas become more humane in its methods. Many believe that it should\r\nbe entirely abandoned. The eighth amendment to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States says that \"excessive bail shall not be required,\r\nnor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\r\ninflicted.\" Moreover, a new idea has entered into the matter. It\r\nis the same idea that controls the modern treatment of dependents,\r\nnamely, that of REHABILITATING the criminal. It is now recognized\r\nthat crime results in most cases from diseased conditions either\r\nin the individual or in the community. Some individuals commit\r\ncrime merely because it seems to them the easiest way to make a\r\nliving or to gain some other end; but even such individuals are\r\nMORALLY diseased. Much crime is due to temporary mental\r\ndisturbance, as from the use of intoxicants or other drugs.\r\nSometimes it is the act of persons who are actually insane or\r\nfeeble-minded. Very often it is committed under pressure of\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, while the deliberate violator of law\r\nshould doubtless be punished, it is even more important that the\r\ncauses of crime should be removed, and that the criminal should,\r\nin as many cases as possible, be restored to a useful and an\r\nhonest manner of life. The proper treatment of dependents and\r\ndefectives, and the removal of causes of dependency and\r\ndefectiveness, are essential steps toward the lessening of crime.\r\n\r\nTHE LOCAL JAIL\r\n\r\nThe county jail and the town \"lock-up\" are the usual local\r\ninstitutions where persons suspected of having violated the law\r\nare detained while awaiting trial in the courts, and also where\r\nthose convicted of petty misdemeanors are imprisoned for\r\npunishment. The jail and the \"lock-up\" are as notorious as the\r\nalmshouse for unwholesome conditions and mismanagement, though\r\nconditions have greatly improved under the influence of an\r\nawakened public opinion. They have often, been unsanitary in the\r\nextreme. Prisoners have often been treated more like cattle than\r\nlike human beings. Young and old are thrown together, the hardened\r\ncriminal with the youthful \"first offender,\" and with those merely\r\nsuspected of crime, many of whom will be proved to be innocent.\r\nThe result is demoralizing. Our jails have sometimes been said to\r\nbe \"schools of vice and crime.\"\r\n\r\nNEEDED REFORM OF THE JAIL\r\n\r\nTwo reforms, at least, are needed in local jails. First, they\r\nshould be made as wholesome as possible, both physically and\r\nmorally. They should be perfectly sanitary, and the food should at\r\nleast be clean and nourishing. Arrangements should be made to keep\r\nthe different classes of inmates separate, especially the hardened\r\nand vicious criminals from youthful transgressors and suspects. In\r\nthe second place, the local jail should be merely a place of\r\ndetention for those awaiting trial or, after trial, transfer to\r\nother institutions. Those found guilty by the courts should be\r\ntransferred as quickly as possible to institutions where they may\r\nreceive treatment fitted to their needs.\r\n\r\nFITTING THE TREATMENT TO THE OFFENDER\r\n\r\nOf three persons who steal ten dollars, one may be a deliberate\r\nthief who prefers to make his living this way; another may be\r\ndriven by hunger; and the third may be mentally unbalanced. It is\r\nobvious that the treatment accorded to each should be determined\r\nby these facts rather than by the mere amount of the theft. The\r\nfirst doubtless needs punishment; but he should also have\r\ntreatment designed to change his attitude toward the community and\r\nto fit him to make an honest living. The second needs to be\r\nrelieved of his want and to be given an opportunity for self-\r\nsupport. The third needs hospital treatment. We are only beginning\r\nto see that punishment is only a part of the treatment necessary,\r\nand that the treatment should be made to fit the criminal fully as\r\nmuch as to fit the crime.\r\n\r\nSTATE INSTITUTIONS FOR DELINQUENTS\r\n\r\nProper treatment for all the various classes of cases cannot well\r\nbe given in the county jail; nor can the local community as a rule\r\nafford to maintain separate institutions for them, as the number\r\nin each class is very small in a given community. Hence the\r\nnecessity for state institutions to which those convicted in the\r\nlocal courts may be sent. Such institutions exist, although not\r\nalways adequate to the needs of the state. They include state\r\npenitentiaries, reform and industrial schools, hospitals for the\r\ninsane, special schools for the feeble-minded, and others. These\r\ninstitutions have been steadily improving in their efficiency. The\r\ngreater difficulty seems to be in the local communities, in\r\nsecuring the assignment of offenders to the proper institutions.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF STATE PRISONS\r\n\r\nGreat changes have occurred in recent years in the methods of\r\nadministering state penitentiaries, especially in some states.\r\nUnder old conditions convicts were either confined in isolation\r\nand idleness or condemned to hard labor, punishment being the sole\r\nidea in both cases. The most rigid and arbitrary discipline was\r\nenforced. Modern penitentiaries keep prisoners employed in\r\noccupations that are of use to the state, that are designed to\r\ntrain the prisoner for useful service, and that yield him some\r\ncompensation that will help to make him self-supporting when he\r\nleaves. They also maintain schools for the instruction of\r\nprisoners in at least the common branches of knowledge and in\r\nvocational subjects. Great care is taken of the health. In some\r\ncases the prisoners are graded according to their conduct and\r\ntheir ability to assume responsibility, certain privileges and\r\nfreedom and participation in the administration of the prison\r\nbeing bestowed upon them so long as they show a sense of their\r\nresponsibility. The period of imprisonment may be shortened as a\r\nreward for good conduct.\r\n\r\nJUVENILE OFFENDERS\r\n\r\nOne of the most important reforms that have been made is that in\r\nthe treatment of juvenile offenders. The main feature of this is\r\nthe establishment of a JUVENILE COURT, where the usual procedure\r\nand publicity of a criminal court are avoided, and where the judge\r\ntakes a fatherly attitude toward the accused. Each case is\r\ncarefully investigated to discover the cause of trouble and to\r\narrive at a wise conclusion as to the treatment to be given. In\r\nthe case of first offenders, or where other conditions justify it,\r\nthe prisoner is released ON PROBATION. That is, he is given his\r\nfreedom on his honor, but under the supervision of a PROBATION\r\nOFFICER to whom he must report at regular intervals. In the case\r\nof more serious offenses, or of repeated wrong-doing, or of\r\nviolation of parole, offenders are sent to reform schools or\r\nindustrial schools. The entire effort is to set the young offender\r\non the right road to honest self-support and good citizenship.\r\nUnfortunately, however, this machinery for the treatment of\r\njuvenile delinquency is so far found almost exclusively in cities.\r\nThe problem of juvenile delinquency in rural communities is one\r\nthat requires more attention than has been given to it. It is a\r\nproblem that the young citizen himself can greatly help to solve\r\nby the cultivation, in himself and in his friends, of right\r\nconceptions of citizenship.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on the following:\r\n\r\nThe organization of your county and town governments to protect\r\npersons and property against criminals, to apprehend law\r\nviolators, and to bring them to justice.\r\n\r\nThe cost to your county or town of this organization.\r\n\r\nThe desirability or undesirability of differing definitions of\r\ncrime in different states, and of different punishments for the\r\nsame crime.\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of severe punishments in preventing crime.\r\n\r\nShould capital punishment be abolished?\r\n\r\nThe meaning of \"bail,\" and why it is provided for.\r\n\r\nThe effect of prohibition upon the amount of crime in your\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe number of prisoners confined in your county jail during the\r\npast year, why they were there, and what it cost to keep them.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of \"fitting punishment to the criminal rather than to\r\nthe crime.\"\r\n\r\nThe treatment of prisoners in your state penitentiary.\r\n\r\nThe method of dealing with juvenile offenders in your community.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of \"probation\"; of \"parole\"; of an \"indeterminate\r\nsentence.\"\r\n\r\nThe extent of juvenile delinquency in your community; its causes.\r\n\r\nThe use of convict labor outside of prisons.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nReports of county and town authorities.\r\n\r\nReports of state board of charities and of administrative boards\r\nof state institutions.\r\n\r\nPublications of the Children's Bureau, U.

Their repugnance to it is\r\nlargely a survival of the times when an autocratic ruling class\r\nimposed taxes upon the people for its own selfish purposes.\r\nStruggling for the bare necessities of life, the people had to pay\r\nthe bills of the ruling class who lived in luxury. The long\r\nstruggle for liberty in England and in the English colonies was a\r\nstruggle against the power of rulers to impose taxes without the\r\nconsent of the people. The habit of mind with respect to taxation\r\nformed under such conditions has to a considerable extent\r\npersisted into the present, when conditions are very different.\r\n\r\nWHAT TAXATION MEANS IN A DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nThe change to government \"of the people, by the people, for the\r\npeople\" should put the paying of taxes in a very different light.\r\nWe decide upon a service we want performed for us, we provide the\r\ngoverning machinery to perform the service, and the service must\r\nbe paid for. We do not object to paying for having our house\r\nbuilt, our food provided, our clothes made, and our goods hauled.\r\nWhy should we object to paying for the service of schools, roads,\r\nprotection of health and property, the defense of our liberties?\r\n\r\nTHE RETURNS FROM TAXATION\r\n\r\nSuch objection seems especially unreasonable when we consider that\r\nthe value of the service rendered by government is, as a rule, far\r\nin excess of what it costs the individual citizen. In Chapter XVII\r\nwe saw that a Virginia farmer, the value of whose farm was\r\nassessed at $3000, was taxed $19.48 for road improvements. In\r\nreturn for this he acquired the use of a system of roads\r\nthroughout the county that cost at least $173,000. This local\r\nsystem connected him with the transportation system of the entire\r\ncountry, gave him a market for his produce, greatly increased the\r\nvalue of his land, brought better school facilities, and enriched\r\nhis life in many ways.\r\n\r\nThe recent war imposed an unusually heavy burden of taxation upon\r\nus. But when we think of the millions of people who paid for the\r\nwar with their LIVES, and of the fact that the war was fought for\r\nthe most precious of all things,--human liberty,--the money tax\r\nthat each citizen had to pay in some form or other seems very\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nBENEFITS OF TEAM WORK IN TAXATION\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IV we read how Benjamin Franklin secured the services\r\nof a man to keep the pavements of the neighborhood clean \"for the\r\nsum of sixpence per month to be paid by each house.\" By this bit\r\nof cooperation, each householder was relieved of a burden, and had\r\nthe benefit not only of having his own pavement cleaned, but also\r\nof knowing that those of all his neighbors would be equally clean,\r\nand thus of having a pleasanter neighborhood, and the cost was\r\ninsignificant. This incident illustrates the underlying principle\r\nof taxation in a self-governing community. The poorest citizen is\r\nmade rich in the benefits that he may enjoy, while the cost is\r\nmade proportional to his ability to pay.\r\n\r\nMISUSE OF TAXES\r\n\r\nLike the rest of our governing machinery, however, our system of\r\nlevying, collecting, and paying taxes does not always work\r\nperfectly, and there is more or less ground for dissatisfaction\r\nwith it. In the first place, the people do not always get full\r\nvalue for their taxes. While it is true that the farmer receives,\r\nin return for his road tax, vastly more than he could purchase\r\nprivately with the same amount of money, yet, if the road\r\nimprovements are poorly made, he gets less than he should. It\r\nusually costs as much to employ an inefficient road supervisor, or\r\nschool teacher or superintendent, or sheriff, as to employ an\r\nefficient one--in fact, in the long run it costs more. Sometimes\r\nmore persons are employed in government offices than there is any\r\nneed for, or some of those employed are shirkers, or otherwise\r\ninefficient. There is wastefulness in the methods by which\r\nappropriations are made for the expenses of government. Sometimes\r\nthere is \"graft,\" by which public money is diverted to the private\r\nuses of officials, contractors, or others.\r\n\r\nA CAUSE OF DISSATISFACTION\r\n\r\nSuch abuses as these are, of course, not faults of the TAXING\r\nsystem, but they naturally make citizens reluctant to pay taxes.\r\nPeople want to know that their money is spent for the purposes for\r\nwhich it was paid, and that it is used economically and\r\neffectively for these purposes. Nothing else will do so much to\r\nremove the dislike of taxation as assurance on these points. As\r\nFranklin said with reference to his successful experiment in\r\nstreet cleaning, it \"raised a general desire to have all the\r\nstreets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax\r\nfor that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nTAXATION MUST BE JUST\r\n\r\nA system of taxation must be JUST if it is to meet with popular\r\napproval. It is not easy, nor indeed possible, to devise a system\r\nthat works with absolute justice in every case; for the assessment\r\nof taxes is a complicated process, and reliance must be placed to\r\na considerable extent upon the honesty and conscientiousness of\r\nindividual citizens. The people are satisfied, however, if they\r\nsee that every reasonable effort is made to secure justice.\r\n\r\nThe first essential in a just system is that EVERY CITIZEN SHALL\r\nBEAR HIS SHARE of the burden. Therefore the paying of taxes is\r\ncompulsory by law. It is also just that each citizen shall pay\r\nonly IN PROPORTION TO HIS ABILITY. These two principles of\r\ntaxation are similar to those applied in the selective draft for\r\nwar service. It is in assessing taxes according to ability to pay\r\nthat one of the principal difficulties appears. But an effort has\r\nbeen made to do this by the following procedure.\r\n\r\nHOW THE AMOUNT TO BE RAISED IS DETERMINED\r\n\r\nIt is first necessary to know how much money will be needed by the\r\ngovernment. Each year, therefore, the heads of the various\r\nbranches and departments of government make an estimate for the\r\ncoming year, based on their knowledge of past expenditures and\r\npresent and future needs. Such estimate can be made intelligently\r\nonly when there is an accurate and businesslike system of keeping\r\naccounts and records, and a well-planned BUDGET SYSTEM.\r\nUnbusinesslike methods of keeping accounts and the lack of a\r\nbudget system have been among the chief weaknesses of our\r\ngovernments, equally characteristic of local, state, and national\r\ngovernments. Efforts are being made to remedy these defects and\r\nare described in Chapters XXV, XXVI, and XXVII.\r\n\r\nTAXES ON PERSONS, PROPERTY, AND PRIVILEGES\r\n\r\nThe second thing to be ascertained is the ability of each citizen\r\nto pay. In some states a uniform POLL TAX is assessed upon every\r\nadult citizen. This is a tax upon the PERSON and usually amounts\r\nto about two dollars. Only those are exempt who are incapable of\r\nself-support. But the chief reliance is upon a property tax. State\r\nand local governments depend principally upon a GENERAL PROPERTY\r\nTAX, for which purpose property is divided into two kinds: REAL\r\nESTATE, which includes land and buildings, and PERSONAL PROPERTY,\r\nwhich includes furniture, tools, livestock, money, and valuables\r\nof various kinds. In addition to the general property tax there\r\nmay be taxes upon INCOMES and upon INHERITANCES. There are also\r\nLICENSE TAXES, such as dog and automobile licenses. Finally there\r\nare taxes upon certain PRIVILEGES which are bestowed upon the\r\nindividual by the community and have a money value. Of such a\r\nnature is the license tax imposed upon a peddler or upon a person\r\nwho maintains a market stand on the public street. Such, also, are\r\nthe taxes placed upon corporations for the privilege of using the\r\npublic highways for car tracks, water mains, or telephone poles.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, for the government to ASSESS THE VALUE\r\nof the property (or privilege) of each citizen, and it has its\r\norganization for this purpose. Each local community The assessment\r\nof (township, county, or city) has one or more TAX ASESSORS, who\r\nendeavor to ascertain by inquiry values or inspection the value of\r\neach citizen's property. The sum of the individual assessments\r\nconstitutes the assessment valuation for the town, or county, or\r\ncity; and the sum of the valuations of these local communities\r\nconstitutes the valuation for the entire state.\r\n\r\nTHE RATE OF TAXATION\r\n\r\nThe third step is to ascertain the RATE of taxation. This is found\r\nby dividing the total amount to be raised by taxation The rate of\r\nby the total property valuation of the county or taxation state,\r\nas the case may be. If the amount to be raised is $500,000, and\r\nthe property valuation is $10,000,000, the rate would be 5 per\r\ncent, and the tax is levied against each citizen at this rate. A\r\ncitizen who owns twice as much property as another should pay\r\ntwice as much tax. Each should pay according to his ability.\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTY OF JUST ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nThis seems like a simple procedure; but it is very difficult to\r\nget a just result. The difficulty lies chiefly in the assessment\r\nIt requires a good deal of intelligence to assess property fairly,\r\neven with the best of intentions. Assessors are not always\r\ncompetent. Two assessors may differ in their judgment, so that\r\nassessments in one part of the community may run at a lower level\r\nthan in another part. Thus assessments vary in their fairness in\r\ndifferent townships of the same county, and in different counties\r\nof the same state. An attempt is made to avoid this by means of\r\ncounty and state TAX EQUALIZATION BOARDS, which seek to adjust\r\ndifferences of this sort. But their efforts are only partially\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY OF PROPERTY OWNERS\r\n\r\nProperty owners are themselves, however, more responsible than\r\nanyone else for the inequities of taxation in our country. It is a\r\ncommon practice of tax assessors to accept the property owner's\r\nown statement of the valuation of his property. In an\r\nastonishingly large proportion of cases he gives a valuation far\r\nbelow the real one. Even when the assessor inspects the property,\r\nit is easy to conceal from his eyes certain forms of personal\r\nproperty, such as money, stocks and bonds, and jewelry. Land and\r\nlivestock cannot be concealed; and for this reason farmers are\r\nlikely to pay a heavier share of taxes than others whose property\r\nis in less conspicuous forms. But they may make false valuations.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS OF UNJUST ASSESSMENTS\r\n\r\nIn one state, where the law requires the assessment of real estate\r\n\"at its true value in money when sold in the ordinary manner of\r\nsale,\" a study in one township showed that \"the average TAX value\r\nof farm land in the open country ... is $7.89, while the average\r\nMARKET value runs around $20. The 73 largest taxpayers give in\r\ntheir farm holdings at values ranging from $6 to $20 an acre. Thus\r\nthe burden of state and county support falls three or four times\r\nas heavily on one acre of farm land as on another--on farms lying\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\n\"When we look at suburban farm land the tax values range from $17\r\nto $2220 an acre.\r\n\r\n\"But the most amazing 'jokes' appear in the values put by their\r\nowners on improved town lots. In the same end of the town we found\r\nthree handsome town properties worth around $15,000 each, the tax\r\nvalues were $550, $4400, $4950. In another neighborhood, two\r\nadjoining homes about equal in value were listed at $500 and\r\n$3400; one at about 50 per cent and the other at about 8 per cent\r\nof the actual value.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to personal property in the same township, the\r\nwealthiest private taxpayer in the township lists household goods\r\nand utensils, work-stock, vehicles, money, jewelry ... at $216.\r\nThe next wealthiest private taxpayer covers all these properties\r\nwith $105. He's a farmer and well-to-do, but his household\r\nfurniture, farm animals, vehicles, implements, and the like, are\r\nworth only $105--on the tax list.\r\n\r\n\"Another large landowner covers his household goods, farm animals,\r\nvehicles, and the like, with $82; another with $457, and another\r\nwith $2272. The differences lie not so much in the properties as\r\nin the consciences of these big landlords.\"[Footnote: 1 E. C.\r\nBranson, A Township Tax-List Study; in North Carolina Club Year\r\nBook, 1917-1918, pp. 66, 67 (The University of North Carolina\r\nExtension Series No. 30).]\r\n\r\nPUBLIC AND PRIVATE HONESTY\r\n\r\nSuch inequalities as these may be found in almost every tax list\r\nin any community. One of the strange things about it is that\r\ncitizens evade taxation who would not think of being dishonest or\r\nunfair in a private business transaction. The reason is not easy\r\nto understand. Doubtless it is partly due to the feeling that as\r\nlong as \"everybody does it\" it is justifiable. Of course this is\r\nnot true. One taxpayer is reported as saying, \"I feel dog-mean\r\nwhenever I give in my taxes; but I'm doing as well as the rest and\r\na little better than most.\"\r\n\r\nGOOD SENSE AND GOOD BUSINESS\r\n\r\nDishonest returns by one taxpayer defraud the citizen who is\r\nhonest, because they place a heavier burden of taxation upon the\r\nlatter. Moreover, the dishonest taxpayer and good cheats himself\r\nalong with others, for the lower the business valuation of\r\nproperty, the higher the rate of taxation, or the poorer the\r\nservice received from the government. \"It is good sense and good\r\nbusiness for a state to show up with large tax values and low tax\r\nrates. It shows a brisk and lively prosperity that is attractive\r\nto outside capital and enterprise.\" [Footnote: E. C. Branson, A\r\nTownship Tax-List Study]\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE AND PUBLICITY NEEDED\r\n\r\nTo secure fairer taxation and better returns from taxation there\r\nis need of improvement in the organization for tax assessment and\r\ntax equalization. It is especially important to make it more\r\ndifficult for the \"tax dodger\" to evade his responsibility. It\r\nwould seem, however, that there would be fewer \"tax dodgers\" if\r\nthe people once got \"the right idea\" of what taxation really means\r\nin a democracy. Great improvement would doubtless result, even\r\nunder present conditions, if honest citizens would take more\r\ninterest in the results of assessments as shown in the tax lists.\r\nThe writer quoted in the paragraphs above asserts that, next to\r\nthe Bible, \"the most important book in any county is the Tax List,\r\nand it is the one book that the people in general know least\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody knows in a vague, general way that something is wrong\r\nwith our tax system ... but what everybody does not know is what\r\nthe facts are in concrete, accurate detail. There is no cure like\r\npublicity for wrongs in a democracy. Give the folks the facts,\r\nwhatever they are, and the folks will do the rest. ... But at\r\npresent nobody knows the facts. That is to say, nobody but the tax\r\nlisters, the registers, and the sheriffs. And they are dumb\r\nbecause their official lives depend on silence. [Footnote:. C.\r\nBranson, A Township Tax-List Study.]\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on the following:\r\n\r\nDo people of your acquaintance like to pay taxes?

But Congress also has power by \"to\r\nlay and collect taxes ... to pay the debts and provide for the\r\ncommon defense and general welfare of the United States\"\r\n(Constitution, Art. I, sec. 8, clause i). State and local\r\ngovernments raise most of their revenues by DIRECT taxation upon\r\nthe property of citizens. The national government, on the other\r\nhand, has always relied chiefly upon INDIRECT taxation. Congress\r\nlevies DUTIES ON IMPORTS. These duties are paid in the first\r\ninstance by the importer. The latter, however, adds the tax to the\r\nprice of the goods, so that it is paid finally by the consumers\r\nand not by the importer. In a similar manner Congress levies\r\nEXCISE TAXES, which are taxes upon products manufactured in this\r\ncountry. The principal excise taxes have been those levied on\r\nalcoholic liquors and tobacco. But here again the tax is paid by\r\nthe consumer in the price which he pays for the liquor or tobacco.\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF INDIRECT TAXATION\r\n\r\nThe chief advantage of indirect taxes is the ease and certainty\r\nwith which they may be collected by the government. the citizen\r\npays them whenever he buys the articles on which the tax is\r\nlevied. The retail dealer passes them on to the wholesaler, and so\r\nfinally the importer is reimbursed. The government collects the\r\ntaxes at customs houses at ports of entry, or at the tobacco\r\nfactories and, formerly, at distilleries. Prohibition has deprived\r\nthe government of one of its chief sources of revenue. Indirect\r\ntaxes are also less objectionable to the people, for they are\r\nseldom conscious of paying them when they buy goods upon which\r\nthey are levied.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX\r\n\r\nCongress has the power to levy direct as well as indirect taxes,\r\nbut it has usually avoided direct taxation, partly for the reasons\r\nstated above, and partly because the Constitution provides that\r\n\"no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless in\r\nproportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to\r\nbe taken\"; that is, in proportion to population. It has been found\r\ndifficult in practice to make such apportionment. Various attempts\r\nby Congress to levy a direct tax on incomes have been declared\r\nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court because it was not so\r\napportioned. The Constitution has now been amended, however, to\r\ngive Congress the power \"to lay and collect taxes on incomes from\r\nwhatever source derived, without apportionment among the several\r\nstates, and without regard to any census or enumeration\"\r\n(Amendment XVI).\r\n\r\nA large revenue is now derived from the national income tax. The\r\nlaw at first exempted from it single persons whose income was less\r\nthan $3000, and married persons whose income was less than $4000.\r\nAs a result of the war, only those are now exempt whose incomes\r\nare less than $1000, if single, and $2000 if married, with an\r\nadditional exemption for each dependent child. The tax is\r\nPROGRESSIVE: that is, the larger one's income, the higher RATE one\r\npays.\r\n\r\nWAR TAXES\r\n\r\nIn ordinary times of peace, state and local governments together\r\nspend much more money than the national government. In war time\r\nthe reverse is true. Enormous sums of money were required for the\r\nconduct of the recent war. As a result the rates of import,\r\nexcise, and income taxes were greatly increased, and unusual forms\r\nof taxation were adopted. A war tax was placed upon many articles\r\nof common use, an inheritance tax was imposed similar to that in\r\nsome of the states, and the EXCESS PROFITS of businesses which the\r\nwar made unusually prosperous were taxed heavily. The effort in\r\nevery case was to distribute the tax so that every one should do\r\nhis share, while the burden should rest most heavily upon those\r\nwho could best bear it.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT LOANS\r\n\r\nA large part of the money necessary for war purposes, and for\r\npermanent improvements in time of peace, is raised by borrowing.\r\nGovernments, whether national, state, or local, borrow money by\r\nthe sale of BONDS, the purchase price with interest being returned\r\nto the purchaser after a stated period of years. The national\r\ngovernment borrowed more than 22 billion dollars during the war by\r\nthe sale of \"liberty bonds,\" and an additional large sum by the\r\nsale of \"war savings stamps\". These loans made by the people are\r\nultimately paid off with funds raised by taxation. The people to-\r\nday advance money to the government, which the people of to-morrow\r\npay back by taxation. This is justifiable because the war was\r\nfought for the benefit of future generations as well as of the\r\npeople to-day. For the same reason, the cost of permanent\r\nimprovements, such as roads and public buildings, is distributed\r\nover a period of years.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of Article I, section 8, clause i, and section 7,\r\nclause I, of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe loss to the nation of revenue as a result of the prohibition\r\nof the liquor traffic.\r\n\r\nCompensating financial gains to the nation through prohibition of\r\nthe liquor traffic.\r\n\r\nWhy an income tax is a good form of taxation.

We saw then that it is the people's\r\norganization for teamwork in protecting and promoting their common\r\ninterests. Succeeding chapters contain evidence that this is so,\r\nalthough they also show that the results achieved by government\r\nare by no means perfect. Now we are to consider HOW we have\r\norganized to get teamwork and how well our organization is suited\r\nto its purpose.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT AS A PROTECTOR OF INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE\r\n\r\n\"American experience indicates that what men do for themselves, on\r\ntheir own initiative, is better done than what paternalistic\r\ngovernment attempts to do for them.\" [Footnote: Editorial,\r\nSATURDAY EVENING POST, February 12, 1921.] Americans have always\r\ndisliked PATERNALISM in government, which means an attempt on the\r\npart of government to control the personal affairs of the people\r\nas a father (Latin, PATER) controls the affairs of a small child.\r\nDemocracy is founded on faith in the ability of the people to\r\nmanage their own affairs with due regard for the equal rights of\r\nother people. We look upon our government chiefly as an instrument\r\nto ensure an equal opportunity to all to exercise initiative and\r\nto manage their own affairs; or, to use the terms we have used\r\nbefore, not so much to do things for us, as to secure teamwork in\r\ndoing things for ourselves. We have had numerous examples of this\r\nprinciple in preceding chapters, one of which was the extent to\r\nwhich private initiative and enterprise were depended upon for the\r\ndevelopment of our public lands.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT AS A PERFORMER OF SERVICE\r\n\r\nAs our community life has become more complex, and as our\r\ndependence upon one another has become greater, we have gradually\r\ncome to expect government to do many things for us, and to control\r\nour individual conduct in many ways, that were not thought of at\r\nan earlier time. We have had illustrations of this, also, in\r\nforegoing chapters. For example, whereas roads were at first built\r\nand controlled almost entirely by private enterprise, now they are\r\nmostly PUBLIC highways, maintained by state and local governments\r\nwith the cooperation of the national government. Proposals to\r\nplace railroads under government management have always met, and\r\nstill meet, with opposition; but government exercises a much\r\ngreater control over them than formerly. Even education has only\r\ngradually become compulsory by law, and the \"public\" high school\r\nis of recent origin. Until quite recently the people have been\r\nleft largely to their own resources for the protection of health,\r\nand for recreation and social life.\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF THE SOCIALISTS\r\n\r\nThere are those who take the extreme position that government\r\nshould manage practically everything for us. Such are the\r\nSocialists, who believe that the unequal distribution of wealth\r\nand the resulting inequalities in opportunity to satisfy wants are\r\ndue to the control of industry by a small and essentially selfish\r\ncapitalistic class. They believe that all natural resources and\r\nall capital should belong to the people jointly, and that the\r\npeople's government should control both the production and the\r\ndistribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the socialist scheme that, since\r\ngovernment would still be in the hands of imperfect human beings,\r\nit would not be wise enough to accomplish the desired result; that\r\npolitical motives would enter into government management, as they\r\ndo in government enterprises to-day, and would prevent the\r\nachievement of the desired results; and that, the opportunity for\r\nprivate initiative and enterprise having been removed, there would\r\nbe lacking one of the chief inducements to human progress.\r\n\r\nSocialism has made considerable progress in some nations of the\r\nworld, but it is by no means popular in the United States,\r\nalthough it has many advocates. We adhere in the main to the\r\nprinciple that government should do things for us only when they\r\ncould not be so well done by private enterprise, and should\r\ncontrol our conduct only so far as to secure equality of personal\r\nfreedom. The fact remains, however, that an increasing amount of\r\nservice is being performed for us by government, and an increasing\r\ncontrol exercised by it over private enterprise.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION FOR SERVICE AND FOR CONTROL\r\n\r\nInsofar as government performs service for us, it must have an\r\norganization for that purpose, with competent leadership. And if\r\nit is not to interfere unduly with freedom of action or personal\r\nliberty, the people must have an organization by which to maintain\r\ncontrol over it. Thus there must be an organization to ensure\r\nefficient SERVICE, and there must be an organization to ensure\r\ndemocracy, or POPULAR CONTROL. If both organizations are\r\neffective, we have an EFFICIENT DEMOCRACY, toward which we have\r\nbeen striving through all our history, but which we have not yet\r\ncompletely attained.\r\n\r\nA government may be efficient in performing service for the people\r\nwithout being democratic. In fact, it may be easier to get\r\nefficient service under an autocratic government. Germany before\r\nthe war illustrated this. But we believe that a government may be\r\nboth efficient and democratic. This depends upon competent\r\nleadership and popular control; and both of these depend upon\r\neducation (Chapter XIX).\r\n\r\nIn the remaining pages of this book we shall consider both the\r\norganization of our government for service and that for popular\r\ncontrol. In this chapter we shall examine some of the methods by\r\nwhich we seek to control government, or to be SELF-governing.\r\n\r\nDIRECT SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe people of a community may govern themselves by direct action\r\nor indirectly through representatives, just as a group of farmers\r\nmay build their own schoolhouse or church, or employ someone to do\r\nit for them. When English colonists settled New England,\r\ngeographical conditions and other reasons led them to form small,\r\ncompact communities, in which it was easy to assemble frequently\r\nat the meetinghouse to discuss matters of community concern and to\r\nagree upon, rules, or laws, to regulate them. This local\r\ngovernment by \"town meeting\" has persisted in many New England\r\n\"towns,\" or \"townships,\" to the present day.\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATIVE SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThis direct action of the people in the New England town is for\r\nthe purpose of MAKING the laws only. When it comes to the\r\nenforcement of these laws, it is necessary to delegate the\r\nauthority to someone. The town meeting could make a law against\r\npermitting hogs to run at large, but it chose someone, a \"hog\r\nreeve,\" to see that the law was observed. When the community is\r\nlarge it is found more convenient to choose representatives also\r\nto make the laws. Thus each Massachusetts town had its\r\nrepresentative in the lawmaking assembly of the colony as a whole.\r\nThis representative system of government now prevails in our\r\ncities, counties, states, and nation.\r\n\r\nDIRECT SELF-GOVERNMENT THROUGH CONSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nEven in the larger communities, however, such as cities, states,\r\nand the nation itself, the people have sought to retain more or\r\nless direct control over lawmaking. In the first place, the\r\n\"fundamental law\" of the states and nation found in their\r\nconstitutions, which determine what the form and powers of\r\ngovernment shall be, has been adopted by more direct action of the\r\npeople than most other laws. The Preamble to the federal\r\nConstitution asserts that \"We, the people of the United\r\nStates...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United\r\nStates of America.\" Neither state nor national constitutions can\r\nbe altered except by special action by the people themselves,\r\neither by direct vote at the polls or by conventions of\r\nrepresentatives chosen especially for the purpose.\r\n\r\nDIRECT LAWMAKING: INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM\r\n\r\nIt has long been the practice in many communities to submit\r\nimportant local questions to popular vote for decision, such as\r\nthe question of issuing bonds for public improvements, or of\r\nlicensing saloons. Within recent years in a number of states the\r\npeople have gained direct control over lawmaking in regard to any\r\nsubject whatever, both in local and state affairs, by means of the\r\n\"initiative and referendum.\" The \"initiative\" is the right of the\r\nvoters themselves to \"initiate,\" or propose, legislation. This is\r\ndone by means of a petition signed by a specified number of\r\nvoters. The legislature may then act upon the proposed law; but if\r\nit does not do so, the law is submitted to the people for their\r\nvote at the next election. On the other hand, if the legislature\r\npasses a law that is objectionable to some of the voters a\r\npetition signed by a specified number of voters requires the law\r\nto be REFERRED to the people for their approval or rejection. This\r\nis the \"referendum.\"\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY OF THE WEST\r\n\r\nOf the 21 states that had adopted the initiative and referendum\r\n(to 1917) only four were east of the Mississippi River (Maine,\r\nMaryland, Michigan, and Ohio). [Footnote: \"The Initiative and\r\nReferendum,\" Bulletin No. 6, submitted to the Constitutional\r\nConvention of Massachusetts (1917) by the Commission to Compile\r\nInformation and Data, p. 10.] The movement to increase popular\r\ncontrol over government has always been stronger in the West, as\r\nwe shall see in other connections.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, however, our laws are made by our\r\nrepresentatives, over whom we exercise more or less control. Some\r\nof the more important means by which this control is exercised are\r\ndescribed in following chapters; but first of all we exercise\r\ncontrol by CHOOSING our representatives at frequent intervals. Let\r\nus inquire to what extent the people have a voice in this choice.\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\nIt is not true that all citizens have a voice in choosing their\r\nrepresentatives, though it is more nearly true today than ever\r\nbefore. The right to a voice in this choice is called the\r\nSUFFRAGE. It is bestowed only on those citizens who possess\r\ncertain qualifications. The constitution of each state fixes the\r\nqualifications for those who live within the boundaries of the\r\nstate, the national government having exercised no control over\r\nthe matter except in two cases. After the Civil War, the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment to the Federal Constitution was adopted, providing that\r\n\"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be\r\ndenied or abridged by the United States, or by any state, on\r\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\"; and\r\nrecently Congress has enacted another amendment to the federal\r\nConstitution which, when approved by a sufficient number of\r\nstates, will bestow the suffrage upon all women of the nation who\r\npossess the other necessary qualifications.\r\n\r\nEARLY DISTRUST OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThe founders of our nation were far from democratic as we now\r\nunderstand the term. They believed that the government should be\r\ncontrolled by the educated and propertied class, which was small.\r\nThe lack of confidence in the people was shown in various ways,\r\nbut among others by the restriction of the suffrage. This was true\r\neven in the New England town meeting, which we are in the habit of\r\nconsidering as the most democratic of institutions. For instance,\r\nno one could vote in colonial times who did not belong to the\r\nchurch. Religious qualifications were soon abolished however, and\r\nproperty qualifications have almost completely disappeared, though\r\nin some states voters must be taxpayers.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS FOR THE SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\nToday no citizen may vote in any state who has not reached the age\r\nof 21. The reason for this is clear and just, but it excludes from\r\nthe suffrage about 30 million young citizens. Persons of unsound\r\nmind are denied the suffrage, and citizens may be disqualified by\r\ncrime. In some states illiterates are denied the right to vote. In\r\nmost states foreigners must have completed the process of\r\nnaturalization, which requires five years before they may vote.\r\nAll states require residence in the state and in their local\r\ndistricts for specified periods prior to voting. But with these\r\nexceptions, the suffrage is now possessed by practically all male\r\ncitizens who are 21 years of age or over, and is rapidly being\r\nextended to women on equal terms with the men.\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\nThere are instances in our early history where women were\r\npermitted to vote--in New Jersey, for example, prior to 1807. In\r\n1869, Wyoming, while still a territory, extended full suffrage to\r\nwomen, and has been an equal suffrage state since her admission to\r\nthe Union in 1890. Woman suffrage has rapidly gained ground in\r\nrecent years, most rapidly in the West, and at the present writing\r\n(1919) 15 states have granted women equal suffrage with men, all\r\nbut two of these states being west of the Mississippi River. The\r\nwomen of Alaska also have this right. In many other states they\r\nhave the suffrage at certain elections. Moreover, nearly all of\r\nthe 36 required states have ratified the suffrage amendment to the\r\nfederal Constitution.\r\n\r\nWhy may an autocratic government perform more efficient service\r\nthan a democratic government?\r\n\r\nWhat is a \"benevolent despotism\"? What is a \"paternalistic\r\ngovernment\"?\r\n\r\nWhy do we consider an imperfect democracy better than an efficient\r\nautocracy?\r\n\r\nDo you have direct or representative self-government in your\r\ncommunity? Explain.\r\n\r\nWhat voluntary organizations are there in your community (such as\r\nfarmers' cooperative organizations, business corporations,\r\nchurches, clubs, etc.) that have direct self-government?\r\nRepresentative self-government?\r\n\r\nDoes your county or town have representatives in state and\r\nnational governments? What are their names? How long will they be\r\nyour representatives?\r\n\r\nDoes your state have the initiative and referendum? If so, explain\r\nin detail how they are used. Give instances of the use of either.\r\n\r\nGive instances (if any) of the use of the referendum in your\r\ncommunity to settle a local question.\r\n\r\nFrom your state constitution ascertain the exact qualifications\r\nfor the suffrage in your state.\r\n\r\nReport on the history of woman suffrage in your state.\r\n\r\nDo you think any of the restrictions now existing on the suffrage\r\nin your state should be removed? Why?\r\n\r\nDo you think any further restrictions should be placed on the\r\nsuffrage in your state? Why?\r\n\r\nMAJORITY AND MINORITY RULE\r\n\r\nOne of the important principles upon which democratic government\r\nrests is that the will of the majority should control. It is the\r\nonly arrangement that can be made with justice. It often happens,\r\nhowever, that a minority, and sometimes a very small minority,\r\ngains control. It also sometimes happens that the party in power\r\nin government, whether it is a majority or a minority, governs\r\nwithout full consideration for the interests of other parties or\r\nof the community as a whole. We shall try to get some idea of how\r\nthis happens, and also of methods proposed to prevent it; for as\r\nlong as it happens we cannot lay claim to a full measure of\r\ndemocracy in our government.\r\n\r\nIf the pupils of your class or school are voting on the kind of\r\nentertainment to be given, and a difference of opinion arises, can\r\nyou think of a fairer way to decide than by a vote of the\r\nmajority? How else might the matter be decided?\r\n\r\nIf the majority decides the question, should the minority yield\r\ngracefully to the decision? Why?\r\n\r\nAfter the majority plan has been adopted, have the minority any\r\nrights in the matter?\r\n\r\nIs the majority always right in its decisions? Give illustrations\r\nto prove your answer.\r\n\r\nIf your community takes a vote on the question of road\r\nimprovement, or of school consolidation, is it right that the\r\nmajority should decide?\r\n\r\nIf the majority rules in such a case, is it right that the\r\ncitizens of the minority party should be taxed for the improvement\r\nas well as those of the majority? Why?\r\n\r\nIf your class president is elected by a majority of the class, or\r\na county supervisor by a majority of the voters of the county, to\r\nwhat extent is it the duty of this officer to consider the\r\ninterests of the minority which voted against him?\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\nOur government is a government by political parties. That is,\r\npolitical parties control the government. Voters acting\r\nindependently of one another cannot exercise much influence. There\r\nmust be teamwork in political matters as in everything else. A\r\npolitical party consists of those voters who think alike and act\r\ntogether on questions of government policy, or in electing their\r\nrepresentatives in government. It is a voluntary organization,\r\nentirely outside of the government and not recognized in our\r\nconstitutions, but exercising very great influence upon\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn his Farewell Address to the people, Washington said:\r\n\r\nThe spirit [of party] unfortunately is inseparable from our\r\nnature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human\r\nmind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or\r\nless stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the\r\npopular form it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly\r\ntheir worst enemy. The alternate domination of one faction over\r\nanother, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party\r\ndissensions...is a frightful despotism... The common and continual\r\nmischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the\r\ninterest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\r\n\r\nMISCHIEFS OF THE PARTY SPIRIT\r\n\r\nAs long as people differ on questions of public policy there are\r\nbound to be political parties, as Washington knew, and they have\r\nalways played an important part in our government. But necessary\r\nand useful as parties have been, the events of our history have\r\nshown that Washington's warning was exceedingly wise, the \"party\r\nspirit\" having often proved the \"worst enemy\" of our democratic\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF MINORITY OPPOSITION\r\n\r\nWhen some great question is before the country, like that of the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, or that of slavery, the people are\r\nusually divided into two great parties. The party that marshals\r\nthe greater number of votes constitutes a majority and gains\r\ncontrol of the government. The defeated minority usually accepts\r\nits defeat in a sportsmanlike manner and loyally supports the\r\ngovernment. Nevertheless it does not cease its opposition to the\r\nprinciples of the party in power. One of the chief values of the\r\nparty system is that it keeps important questions in constant\r\ndiscussion. The opposition of the minority serves as a check upon\r\nthe acts of the party in power, which is anxious to avoid arousing\r\ntoo much opposition. This is one means of control over the\r\ngovernment enjoyed by the minority party. A defeated minority at\r\none election may become a victorious majority at the next. The\r\nfact that a party is in the minority does not necessarily mean\r\nthat it is in the wrong.\r\n\r\nHOW MINORITIES MAY GAIN CONTROL\r\n\r\nMinorities, however, sometimes win elections. If more than two\r\nparties are contesting the election, which often happens, that one\r\nwins which has the greatest number of votes, though this number\r\nmay be less than the combined votes of the opposing parties. No\r\nother arrangement seems possible. President Wilson won his first\r\nelection by a minority vote, the opposition being divided between\r\nTaft and Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nA minority may win through better teamwork. There are always some\r\nvoters who, through indifference or other causes, do not cast\r\ntheir vote. This is especially likely to happen in local\r\nelections, in which there is almost never as large a vote cast as\r\nin the same district at a general election. It is one of the chief\r\nobjects of a party organization to keep its members informed and\r\ninterested and to see that they cast their votes. The party that\r\nis best organized for these purposes is very likely to win over\r\nits opponents even though the latter are more numerous.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF PARTIES AND ITS CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe organization of the national political parties is very\r\nthorough. Each party has a managing committee in every local\r\ndistrict, the local organizations are united in a state\r\norganization, and the several state organizations in a national\r\norganization. The shrewdest men the party affords are made\r\nchairmen of committees and chosen for other positions of\r\nleadership. Such organization is necessary and proper; it is only\r\ncommonsense teamwork. But unfortunately it has frequently fallen\r\ninto the hands of designing men who have used it to promote\r\nprivate interests rather than those of the public. A political\r\n\"boss,\" who is at the head of an inner \"ring\" of politicians,\r\noften decides who shall be nominated for the various offices of\r\ngovernment, leaving no choice to the voters themselves. This makes\r\nof our government a real autocracy, and the worst kind of\r\nautocracy, because the autocrat (the \"boss\") acts in secret, and\r\nis in no way responsible to the people. It is the \"frightful\r\ndespotism\" of which Washington warned his countrymen (p. 385).\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF SOCIAL UNREST\r\n\r\nPolitical \"bosses\" are often allied with powerful business\r\ninterests which seek legislation and governmental administration\r\nfavorable to themselves. This has given rise to the charge\r\nsometimes made that our government is a \"plutocracy,\" a government\r\nof the people by a small wealthy class. It is the feeling that\r\nthis is so that has caused much of the social unrest at the\r\npresent time, and that explains in part the growth of the\r\nsocialists, and of other groups that would go much further than\r\nthe socialists in their proposed changes, such as the I.W.W.\r\n(Independent Workers of the World) in our country, the Bolshevists\r\nin Russia, and anarchists everywhere.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT IN THE INTEREST OF ALL CLASSES\r\n\r\nUnquestionably selfish groups representing great wealth have often\r\nexerted undue influence in governmental affairs without regard for\r\nthe public welfare. We have seen how the public lands and the\r\nnation's natural resources have in some cases fallen into the\r\nhands of wealthy individuals and corporations to the injury of the\r\nnation and of those who want to use them for productive purposes.\r\nOn the other hand, it is natural that men who have been successful\r\nin managing their private business affairs should also be\r\ninfluential in managing public affairs without necessarily having\r\nunworthy motives. Nevertheless, when government falls under the\r\ncontrol of ANY particular class or group, whether it represents\r\nwealth, or labor, or any other interest, if it has not due regard\r\nfor all classes, and if it denies to the members of other groups\r\nthe voice in government to which they are entitled, it establishes\r\na despotism and overthrows democracy.\r\n\r\nWHY THE PEOPLE SUBMIT TO \"BOSS RULE\"\r\n\r\nWhy do the people submit to \"boss rule\"? In the first place, they\r\ndo not always submit to it. Occasionally, when the \"bosses\" go to\r\nunusual extremes, the people give way to \"fits of public rage,\" to\r\nuse the words of former Senator Elihu Root, \"in which the people\r\nrouse up and tear down the political leader, first of one party\r\nand then of the other party.\" It is thus possible for the people\r\nto escape the despotism of \"boss rule.\" But two things seem to be\r\nnecessary to bring it about: first, the people must be\r\nsufficiently INTERESTED in the management of their public affairs;\r\nand, second, they require LEADERSHIP. It takes close attention to\r\npublic affairs to enable a citizen to make wise decisions for\r\nhimself; and the average citizen looks around for guidance. The\r\nabsence of RESPONSIBLE leadership gives the irresponsible \"boss\"\r\nhis chance.\r\n\r\nTHE SHORT BALLOT\r\n\r\nOne difficulty encountered by the citizen who wishes to vote\r\nintelligently is the large number of persons to be chosen. There\r\nhave been cases where the names of several hundred candidates\r\nappeared on the same ticket. In a small community a voter may know\r\npersonally all the candidates, but in larger communities this is\r\nnot so. It was once thought that to make as many of the government\r\noffices as possible elective was a step in the direction of\r\ndemocracy, and that it gave the people direct control over them.\r\nBut it has not worked out this way. It is impossible for the\r\naverage voter to choose wisely among so many candidates, and he\r\ntherefore falls an easy prey to \"boss rule.\" The SHORT BALLOT is\r\nnow quite generally advocated to meet this situation. By this plan\r\nthe number of officers to be elected is reduced, and includes only\r\nthose who are responsible for determining the policies of\r\ngovernment, such as members of legislatures and the chief\r\nexecutive officers. These few important officers and\r\nrepresentatives are then made responsible for the appointment of\r\nall other subordinate officers whose business is to carry policies\r\ninto effect. This really gives the people better control over\r\ntheir government by fixing responsibility in a few places, and is\r\ntherefore no less democratic than the older plan.\r\n\r\nDo you have a long ballot or a short ballot in your county or\r\ntown? In your state?\r\n\r\nHow many offices in your county government are elective? How many\r\nof the men holding these offices do you know? Consult your parents\r\nas to the number of these officers they know personally. How many\r\ndoes your teacher know?\r\n\r\nAt the next election, get a copy of the ballot used in your\r\ncommunity and ascertain the number of candidates for all offices,\r\nincluding local, state, and national.\r\n\r\nWhat national political parties exist at present?\r\n\r\nAre the voters of your local community divided into parties on\r\nlocal questions? If so, what are some of these questions?\r\n\r\nInvestigate the organization in your county (or town) of the\r\npolitical party of which your father is a member. Who is chairman\r\nof its local committee?\r\n\r\nInvestigate the work that a party organization does in your\r\ncommunity during an election campaign; on election day; in the\r\ntime between elections.\r\n\r\nWhy is secret control over government dangerous?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by \"social unrest\"?\r\n\r\nAre all men of your acquaintance equally capable of directing the\r\naffairs Of government in office? Why?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by \"responsible\" and \"irresponsible\" leadership?\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to say that a leader must be \"responsive as well\r\nas responsible\" to the people?\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET BALLOT\r\n\r\nVarious schemes have been adopted to ensure to every voter a free\r\nexpression of his choice for representatives, and to the majority\r\ntheir right to govern. One of these is the SECRET BALLOT. At the\r\npolls each voter enters a booth by himself to mark his ballot, or\r\nto operate the voting machine, and need have no fear that a\r\npossible \"watcher\" may cause him to lose his job or otherwise\r\nsuffer for voting as he thinks best. The secret ballot also\r\nreduces the likelihood that votes will be bought, for there is no\r\nway of telling whether the man who sells his vote will vote as he\r\nhas agreed; and the man who sells his vote is not to be trusted.\r\nThe only voters who are embarrassed by the secret ballot are those\r\nwho cannot read their ballots. These have to seek help, and are\r\nthus open to influence by agents of the \"boss.\"\r\n\r\nTHE DIRECT PRIMARY\r\n\r\nAnother device to ensure to the voter a voice in his government is\r\nthe DIRECT PRIMARY for the nomination of candidates for office. By\r\nthe older method candidates were nominated by party conventions;\r\nbut under \"boss rule\" they were in reality determined upon in\r\nadvance by the \"boss,\" the nomination by the convention being\r\nlargely a matter of form, the delegates voting according to\r\ninstructions. The ordinary voter had nothing to say about it.\r\nUnder the direct primary plan any voter possessing the necessary\r\nqualifications for holding office may become a candidate by merely\r\nsecuring the signatures of a specified number of voters to a\r\npetition. Then a PRIMARY ELECTION is held at which the voters of\r\neach party go to the polls to express their choice for one among\r\nthe several candidates who have been announced for each office to\r\nbe filled. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes\r\nbecome the nominees of their party. The direct primary is now used\r\nquite widely throughout the United States and is believed to be a\r\ngreat improvement over the old method, though it does not always\r\nwork as well as was expected of it. The truth is that ANY\r\norganization is open to abuse by clever people who wish to abuse\r\nit, and NO political organization will work effectively unless the\r\nvoters are intelligent and eternally vigilant.\r\n\r\nPREFERENTIAL PRIMARIES\r\n\r\nThe President and Vice President of the United States are still\r\nnominated by national party conventions. But in some states there\r\nare PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENTIAL PRIMARIES. These are direct\r\nprimaries at which the voters ex press their PREFERENCE for the\r\npresidential candidates. This is intended to be a guide to the\r\nnominating convention, but there is nothing to compel the\r\nconvention to follow the guidance.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES\r\n\r\nDemocratic government demands certain rights for minorities. We\r\nhave seen how a minority party may exercise a wholesome check upon\r\nthe party in power by constant opposition. We never have a\r\nCongress or a state legislature in which the members are all of\r\none party. This is a good thing, for it results in discussion and\r\ndebate in the legislative body by which the people are kept\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\nThe initiative and referendum (p. 380) are also weapons in the\r\nhands of a minority; for, as we have seen, a small number of\r\nvoters may compel the legislature to consider, or reconsider, any\r\npiece of legislation, or to submit it to the people for their\r\ndecision. Minority parties may thus keep prominently before the\r\npeople measures that have been adversely acted upon by the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nTHE RECALL\r\n\r\nAnother device that has been introduced in some states and local\r\ncommunities is the RECALL of officials. By means of this a\r\nspecified number of voters may demand that an officer of\r\ngovernment who is displeasing to them be brought before the people\r\nfor their vote as to whether he shall be removed from office or\r\nnot. A small minority may thus call an elected officer to account.\r\n\r\nPROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION OF PARTIES\r\n\r\nOne plan strongly advocated by some students of government to\r\ninsure to minorities an actual voice in government is that of\r\nPROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION of parties in legislative bodies. By\r\nthis plan each party would be represented in proportion to its\r\nstrength. If two parties were of about equal strength they would\r\nbe represented equally; if one were twice as strong as another, it\r\nwould have twice the representation. The plan is actually in use\r\nin very few localities. In Illinois, however, the CUMULATIVE-VOTE\r\nplan is in use, by which each voter is permitted as many votes as\r\nthere are places to be filled, and to distribute these votes among\r\nthe several candidates or to cast them all for one candidate.\r\nThus, if there are three representatives to be elected from his\r\ndistrict, he may give one vote to each of the three, or he may\r\ngive three votes to one of them. A minority may thus, by\r\nconcentrating all of their votes upon a single candidate, be\r\nreasonably sure of representation. But it requires good team work\r\nto get this result.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT BASES OF REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nRepresentation in our government is on a TERRITORIAL, OR\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL, BASIS. That is, each representative represents the\r\npeople in a given territory or district. Thus, in many counties\r\nthe board of supervisors is composed of representatives from each\r\ntownship, the members of state legislatures represent districts of\r\nthe state, members of the United States House of Representatives\r\nrepresent congressional districts in each state, and United States\r\nSenators represent states.\r\n\r\nIn each district under our present system, however, the\r\nrepresentatives are ELECTED BY A MAJORITY, though they are\r\nsupposed to REPRESENT ALL the people when elected. If proportional\r\nrepresentation were adopted, it would be necessary to increase the\r\nnumber of representatives from each district, in order that each\r\nparty should have at least one. Then we should have REPRESENTATION\r\nBY PARTIES, as well as by districts.\r\n\r\nWe now hear a good deal about SOVIET GOVERNMENT in Russia. The\r\n\"soviet\" is a representative body with a different basis of\r\nrepresentation than either of the above. Soviet government is\r\ngovernment by \"workers\" and each representative represents a TRADE\r\nOR OCCUPATION. It is as if, in our country, all the farmers in a\r\ncounty, as a group, should elect their representatives to the\r\nboard of county supervisors, all the carpenters their\r\nrepresentatives, all the merchants theirs, and so on. It would be,\r\nas it is in Russia, REPRESENTATION BY OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS, instead\r\nof by geographical districts as now. It would differ from\r\nproportional representation by parties, as described above,\r\nbecause each political party is made up of representatives of all\r\noccupations. Only in a few cases have political parties in our\r\ncountry tended to become identified with occupational interests,\r\nas in the case of \"labor parties,\" and the old \"greenback party,\"\r\nwhich was largely made up of farmers.\r\n\r\nAt election time visit the nearest polling place, observe the\r\nprocedure of voting, and report. Get sample copies of the ballot\r\nused.\r\n\r\nWho are the different persons on duty at the polling place, and\r\nwhat are their duties?\r\n\r\nWhy and how do voters \"register\" before an election?\r\n\r\nDescribe a primary election in your community.\r\n\r\nHow do discussion and debate protect the rights of minorities?\r\n\r\nIs the \"recall\" used in your state? If so, what instances of its\r\nexercise do you know, and what were the circumstances?\r\n\r\nWhat advantages and disadvantages can you see in representation by\r\noccupational groups as compared with representation by\r\ngeographical districts?\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nIn Foerster and Pierson's AMERICAN IDEALS:\r\n\r\nContributions of the west to democracy (F.J.

There were two\r\nsuch forms which met their needs, the TOWN, OR TOWNSHIP, AND THE\r\nCOUNTY. These have remained to this day the chief units of our\r\nlocal government.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ENGLAND TOWN\r\n\r\nGeographical conditions were such in New England that the\r\ncolonists settled in compact communities. There the township, or\r\ntown, was adopted as the more convenient unit. It included a\r\ncentral village and the neighboring farming region with irregular\r\nboundaries. It is still the unit of local government throughout\r\nrural New England, and in many communities that have grown to the\r\nproportion of cities. It has been said of the New England town\r\ngovernment that it is \"the fullest and most perfect example of\r\nlocal self-government either then or now in existence ... . The\r\nstate might fall to pieces, and the town would still supply all\r\nthe wants of everyday government.\" [Footnote: Henry Cabot Lodge, A\r\nSHORT HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA, p. 414.]\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN MEETING\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of the New England town government is the TOWN\r\nMEETING, which is an assemblage of the voters of the town at the\r\ntown hall (formerly often at the church), the regular annual town\r\nmeeting being held in the spring or autumn, and special meetings\r\nas necessary. These meetings are called by the SELECTMEN (see\r\nbelow) by means of a WARRANT which contains a statement of the\r\nbusiness to be transacted. At the annual meeting, reports are\r\nheard from the officers of the preceding year, officers for the\r\nnew year are elected, by-laws (town laws) are enacted, taxes are\r\nlevied and appropriations made for the various purposes of\r\ngovernment. It is direct self-government.\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND TOWN OFFICERS\r\n\r\nAmong the officers elected by the town meeting are the selectmen,\r\nvarying in number from three to nine, who have charge of the town\r\nproperty and are responsible to the town meeting for the conduct\r\nof the town's business; a town clerk, who keeps the town records,\r\nissues marriage licenses, registers births and deaths, and\r\nperforms other clerical services; an assessor of taxes; a\r\ntreasurer; several constables, who have police duties, execute\r\nwarrants issued by the selectmen and by the justices of the peace,\r\nand sometimes act as tax collectors; school committeemen;\r\noverseers of the poor; members of the board of health and of other\r\nboards for public service. In some of the New England states the\r\njustices of the peace, who are not strictly town officers, are\r\nelected by the town meeting.\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN WARRANT\r\n\r\nThere is here given a copy of portions of a warrant for a special\r\ntown meeting. This warrant is very brief as compared with those\r\nissued for a regular annual meeting; but it gives an idea of the\r\nvariety of business transacted.\r\n\r\nTown Warrant\r\n\r\nMIDDLESEX, SS.\r\n\r\nTo Henry Atchison, one of the constables of the Town of Framingham\r\nor to either of them,\r\n\r\nGREETING:\r\n\r\nIn the name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, you are hereby\r\nrequired to notify and warn the inhabitants of the Town of\r\nFramingham, qualified to vote in elections, and Town affairs, to\r\nmeet at the Casino in said Framingham, on WEDNESDAY, JULY 16TH,\r\nA.D. 1919 at eight o'clock P.M.

Children and others than voters are\r\nallowed to be present as spectators. In every such assembly, four\r\nor five men ordinarily do half the talking; but anybody has a\r\nright to make suggestions or propose amendments, and occasionally\r\neven a non-voter is allowed to make a statement; and the debate is\r\noften very effective. [Footnote: Albert Bushnell Hart, ACTUAL\r\nGOVERNMENT, p. 171.]\r\n\r\nAnother writer says,\r\n\r\nThe retiring officers present their reports, which in the larger\r\ntowns have been previously printed and distributed. Any citizen\r\npresent is free to express any criticism or ask any question. No\r\nbetter method of checking the conduct of public officers has ever\r\nbeen discovered than this system of report in open meeting. Keen\r\nquestions and sharp comment rip open and expose to view the true\r\ninwardness of the officers' behavior.\r\n\r\nAt its best, the New England town meeting has never been equaled\r\nas a mechanism for local government. No mere representative system\r\ncan give the opportunity for real participation in government\r\nwhich a town meeting affords. Even the small boys who come to\r\nenjoy the fun from the gallery are taught that government is a\r\nliving reality. By grappling first-hand with their own small\r\nlocal problems, men are trained to take part wisely in the bigger\r\naffairs of state and nation. [Footnote: Thomas H. Reed, FORM AND\r\nFUNCTIONS OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, pp. 218, 220.]\r\n\r\nWEAKENING OF GOVERNMENT BY TOWN MEETING\r\n\r\nChanging conditions, however, have tended to bring about changes\r\nin town government. In the early days the town meeting was a\r\nmatter of great interest, and everybody attended, including the\r\nwomen and children. Many of the towns have now acquired large\r\npopulations, the people are no longer acquainted with one another,\r\nand interest has declined. A few years ago it was reported that\r\n\r\nIn Brookline, Mass., with about 2500 votes cast, there are from\r\n300 to 500 at the business sessions. In Hyde Park, Mass., with\r\n2500 voters... from 500 to 600 attended the annual appropriation\r\nmeeting. In Leominster, Mass., with 1400 voting, the normal\r\nattendance is about 800.\r\n\r\nThe same writer says that:\r\n\r\nIn many places the town meeting is being undermined by the caucus,\r\nheld beforehand, to nominate candidates for office. Here a small\r\ngroup of persons not only narrow the choice for officers, but\r\noften arrange the other business to be determined at the town\r\nmeeting. Sometimes every thing is \"cut and dried\" before it comes\r\nup for popular discussion; and that discussion thus becomes a mere\r\nformality. [J.A. Fairlie, LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN COUNTIES, TOWNS AND\r\nVILLAGES, p. 148.]\r\n\r\nINFLUENCES LEADING TO DECLINE\r\n\r\nThis illustrates what was said in the preceding chapter (p. 388)\r\nabout the necessity for leadership and the tendency of the people,\r\nunder certain conditions, to accept self-appointed leaders,\r\nsometimes not of the best, outside of the government. Conditions\r\nin large towns are likely to favor this. The questions that have\r\nto be acted upon are more complicated than formerly, and often\r\ninvolve the expenditure of large sums of money. The candidates for\r\noffice are not known to many of the voters. There may be a\r\nconsiderable number of uneducated people in the town, and perhaps\r\na foreign population that is unfamiliar with the English language\r\nand with American methods. These things make intelligent self-\r\ngovernment by direct methods difficult.\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCE COMMITTEE: A MEANS OF BETTER SERVICE\r\n\r\nVarious means have been adopted to meet these changing conditions.\r\nOne of these is the creation of a FINANCE COMMITTEE, before which\r\nare brought for consideration questions involving the expenditure\r\nof money. This committee holds hearings, at which citizens may\r\npresent arguments for and against proposed measures. Thus\r\nimportant matters are sifted out by the committee which then\r\nreports to the town meeting. The town meeting usually votes in\r\naccordance with the recommendations of the committee. While this\r\narrangement tends to secure careful consideration of financial\r\nmeasures, and to result in wise decisions, provided the committee\r\nis composed of reliable men, it tends, on the other hand, to\r\nprevent discussion in open town meeting, to make the vote in the\r\nlatter a mere matter of form, and to destroy interest in it. In\r\nother words, while it tends to better SERVICE, it reduces the\r\nvalue of the town meeting as a means of EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nTOWN PLANNING\r\n\r\nAnother arrangement that has been adopted in a good many towns is\r\nthe TOWN PLANNING BOARD. This is a committee which, after careful\r\nstudy of existing conditions and tendencies of community growth,\r\nformulates a definite PLAN for the promotion of the community's\r\ninterests during a period of years. It considers such matters as\r\nthe laying out of new roads and streets and the improvement of old\r\nones, the location of parks, playgrounds, and public buildings,\r\nthe construction of sewers, water works, and lighting systems, the\r\nstyle of architecture for public buildings, the enactment of\r\nhousing laws. While town planning boards usually deal primarily\r\nwith matters pertaining to the physical development of the town,\r\nthey may also plan with reference to the improvement of the\r\neducational system, the promotion of public health, and of social\r\nneeds generally.\r\n\r\nThe town planning board is usually composed of trained men, such\r\nas engineers, architects, and physicians, and it may call in\r\nexpert advisers from other communities or from the state\r\ngovernment. The advantage of having such a board is that it\r\nprovides the town with a program of action carefully worked out\r\nfrom the point of view both of continuous community needs and of\r\neconomy. It affords expert leadership.\r\n\r\nNEED FOR CITIZEN COOPERATION\r\n\r\nAs has been said many times in these pages, government is the\r\ncommunity's official organization to secure cooperation; but it is\r\neffective only to the extent that the people COOPERATE. It is a\r\nmachine that is valuable as the people USE it. The weakening of\r\ntown, government, or of any other government, is due largely to a\r\nlack of interest and of actual participation by the people. Many\r\npeople think they have done their share toward good government\r\nwhen they have helped elect their officers and have paid their\r\ntaxes. But when they take this view they are likely to lose both\r\ninterest in their government and control over it.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTARY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nIn many New England towns the decline in popular control of town\r\ngovernment has been largely counterbalanced by COMMUNITY\r\nORGANIZATION FOR VOLUNTARY COOPERATION. Much community service is,\r\nand probably always will be, performed by private enterprise and\r\ninitiative rather than by government; and the efficiency of\r\ngovernment depends to a considerable extent upon the efficiency of\r\nvoluntary enterprise. Government must have the cooperation of the\r\nlatter, and to some extent work through it. In practically every\r\ncommunity there are groups of people organized to cooperate for\r\none purpose or another; but they are often self-centered and act\r\nindependently of one another, if not actually at cross purposes.\r\nThe situation that exists in many communities is illustrated by\r\nthe chart on page 402. [Footnote: This chart and the one on page\r\n403 are taken from Extension Bulletin No. 23, Massachusetts\r\nAgricultural College, by E.L. Morgan.]\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\r\nIn a good many Massachusetts towns this situation has been very\r\nlargely remedied by means of community organization for which the\r\nleadership has been provided in many cases by the Community\r\nOrganization Department of the Extension Service of the State\r\nAgricultural College. The organization varies in detail in\r\ndifferent communities to meet local needs, but the main features\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\nFirst: a COMMUNITY COUNCIL, consisting of representatives of the\r\nvarious community interests and organizations including the town\r\nofficials. This council serves at first as a sort of \"steering\r\ncommittee\" to bring the various interests together and to plan the\r\norganization and the work to be done.\r\n\r\nSecond: a COMMUNITY MEETING, the first one of which is called by\r\nthe community council to consider the questions: Is it possible\r\nfor a community to plan for its future development? Do we care to\r\ndo it? Is it worthwhile? How can it be done? The community meeting\r\nbecomes a sort of UNOFFICIAL TOWN MEETING, and is often more\r\nlargely attended than the official town meeting, partly because it\r\nis attended by the women of the community.\r\n\r\nThird: a number of WORKING COMMITTEES, appointed as a result of\r\nthe first community meeting. They may include:\r\n\r\nA committee on farm production.\r\n\r\nA committee on conservation.\r\n\r\nA committee on boys' and girls' interests.\r\n\r\nA committee on farm business.\r\n\r\nA committee on community life (education, health, recreation,\r\netc.)\r\n\r\nThese committees make a study of the conditions and needs of the\r\ncommunity in their respective fields, and prepare plans and\r\nprojects, which are submitted to the community meeting in due\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFourth: a COMMUNITY PROGRAM, which has been agreed upon by the\r\ncommunity meeting, is supervised by the community council, and is\r\ncarried out by the various community organizations represented,\r\nincluding the public officials.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL TEAMWORK\r\n\r\nThis organization is entirely outside of the official govern\r\nmental organization. It may be asked why it is necessary to have a\r\n\"community meeting\" when the official town meeting already exists.\r\nThe answer is that the official town meeting has its work pretty\r\ndefinitely cut out for it. It meets for a half-day or a day at a\r\ntime, and its time is occupied BY THE VOTERS in passing laws,\r\nelecting officials, levying taxes, making appropriations, and\r\ndoing other official business. The \"community meeting,\" on the\r\nother hand, is attended by non-voters as well as voters, the women\r\ntaking an active part, and the young people being represented.\r\nMany matters are discussed that could not properly be taken up in\r\ntown meeting.\r\n\r\nA large part of the program of the community organization is\r\ncarried out by the voluntary agencies of the community. But a\r\ngreat many of its proposals must have the approval of the official\r\ntown meeting, require appropriations which can only be made by the\r\ntown meeting, and are finally executed by the public officials of\r\nthe town. The organization naturally stimulates interest in the\r\nofficial government, and brings to its support all the organized\r\nagencies of the community working together.\r\n\r\nTOWNSHIP GOVERNMENT OUTSIDE OF NEW ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe township is found as a unit of local government in many states\r\noutside of New England, but in most of these cases its government\r\nis entirely representative in form. While the town meeting is\r\nfound in a few of these states, [Footnote: As in New York and New\r\nJersey; and farther west in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the\r\nDakotas, Illinois, and Nebraska.] it nowhere holds the important\r\nplace that it does in New England. One reason for this is the\r\nlarger size and more scattered population of the township. In the\r\npublic land states the congressional township, six miles square,\r\nis also the political township. At the head of the township\r\ngovernment in its representative form are TRUSTEES (sometimes\r\nthree, sometimes only one) who, with the town clerk, the\r\nconstables, the tax assessor, the treasurer, the justices of the\r\npeace, and such other officers as may be required, are elected by\r\nthe people. The powers of the township government outside of New\r\nEngland vary in different states, but are always quite limited,\r\nrelating most commonly to the maintenance of roads, school\r\nadministration, and the care of the poor. In these circumstances\r\nthere is at least as great need for community organization to\r\nsupport and supplement the work of government as in the New\r\nEngland towns.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on the following:\r\n\r\nThe services performed by your township government.\r\n\r\nA complete list of your township officers, and the duties of each.\r\n(Committees of pupils may interview some of the more important\r\nofficers to get a description of their daily routine, kinds of\r\nservice performed, etc. Also discuss with parents.)\r\n\r\nOfficers of the colonial New England town that do not exist now,\r\nand their duties.\r\n\r\nWhat is parliamentary law? (Valuable training may be secured by\r\nconducting school meetings, club meetings, or occasional regular\r\nclass exercises, in accordance with parliamentary procedure.)\r\n\r\nWhy public discussion is a check upon the conduct of persons\r\nholding responsible positions.\r\n\r\nThe popular interest in public questions in your township.\r\n\r\nIf there is a finance committee in your township (p. 399), how\r\ndoes it serve the community? Does it hold hearings? (Attend and\r\nreport upon some such hearing.)\r\n\r\nTown planning in your community (what has been, or what might be,\r\ndone).\r\n\r\nThe value of having a plan.\r\n\r\nIs your community more like that represented by the chart on page\r\n402, or by that on page 403?\r\n\r\nThe extent to which voluntary organizations in your community co\r\noperate with and through the local government.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which your state agricultural college promotes\r\ncommunity organization.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of organizing your town (or community) by some\r\nsuch plan as that outlined on page 402.\r\n\r\nThe value of a community \"forum\" as a means to good government.\r\n\r\nWhy the official town meeting should (or should not) be encouraged\r\nin your state.\r\n\r\nProcure and examine recently published official reports of your\r\ntownship government. What do these reports tell you? What is the\r\nvalue of such reports? Are the reports of your township generally\r\nread by the people of the township? Why? Discuss ways in which\r\nyour township reports could be made more useful.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY\r\n\r\nThe other unit of local government with which the colonists were\r\nfamiliar was the county, which in England embraced a number of\r\ntownships. In the colonies of New York and Pennsylvania the county\r\nand the town ship were developed together as in England; in the\r\nsouthern colonies the county was organized without the township.\r\nToday the county exists in every state of the Union, including the\r\nNew England states. In Louisiana it is called the PARISH.\r\n\r\nTYPES OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of county government. According to one\r\nplan, as in New York, each township elects a representative to a\r\ncounty BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, which is sometimes quite large.\r\nAccording to the other plan, as in Pennsylvania, the people of the\r\ncounty as a whole elect a small BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, the\r\ntownships not being represented as such even when they exist. The\r\nboard of supervisors or commissioners levies taxes and makes\r\nappropriations for various county purposes, such as constructing\r\nand maintaining roads, bridges, and county buildings, paying the\r\nsalaries of county officers, caring for the county poor, and\r\nconducting the county schools. It is sometimes spoken of as the\r\ncounty legislative body, but it is rather an administrative body,\r\nits lawmaking powers being very slight.\r\n\r\nCOUNTY OFFICERS\r\n\r\nAmong the important county officers are the sheriff, who is chief\r\nguardian of the peace in the county, has charge of the jail, is\r\nthe chief executive officer of the county court (see p. 439), and\r\nsometimes acts as tax collector; the county prosecutor (also\r\ncalled the prosecuting attorney, the district attorney, or the\r\nstate's attorney), who prosecutes all criminal cases in the county\r\nand represents the public authorities in civil suits; the county\r\nclerk, who keeps the county records; the register of deeds, who\r\nrecords all transfers of property; the coroner, who investigates\r\nthe cause of violent and mysterious deaths; the tax assessor; the\r\ntreasurer; the auditor, who examines the accounts of county\r\nofficers; the surveyor; the school superintendent; the health\r\nofficer. Some times there are others.\r\n\r\nLACK OF INTEREST IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nAlthough practically every citizen of the United States is also a\r\ncitizen of a county, the people have as a rule shown surprisingly\r\nlittle interest in county government. As generally found it\r\naffords a striking example of poor service resulting from a lack\r\nof teamwork. County government has the reputation of being one of\r\nthe weakest spots in our whole system of government.\r\n\r\nWILL COUNTY GOVERNMENT SURVIVE?\r\n\r\nWe seem to have gotten into the habit of not expecting much\r\nservice from the county government. Where the township government\r\nis strong, as in New England, it takes the place of county\r\ngovernment. Where people live in cities, they look to the city\r\ngovernment to serve them rather than to the county government. In\r\nrural districts the people have come more and more to look to the\r\nstate and national governments for such service as they expect\r\ngovernment to give. These facts might suggest the question whether\r\nor not we really need county government.\r\n\r\nOne recent writer says,\r\n\r\nThere are some parts of the country where I can see that the\r\ncounty will pass out of existence entirely in a very short time,\r\nunless it does adjust itself to the new conditions. [Footnote:\r\nH.S. Gilbertson, in the University of North Carolina RECORD, No.\r\n159, October, 1918, p. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe same writer says,\r\n\r\nUnless the county does measure up in this way, the powers of\r\ngovernment and the services which it renders will have to drift\r\naway from local control and be placed in the hands of some\r\ngovernment more fit and which will probably be further away from\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE LONG BALLOT\r\n\r\nStudents of county government attribute many of its defects to the\r\n\"long ballot.\" In one county in North Carolina, at a recent\r\nelection, there were twenty-five different candidates for county\r\noffices on each of three party tickets, making seventy-five\r\ncandidates among whom each voter had to choose. Township and state\r\nofficers were also elected at the same election, bringing the\r\nnumber of persons to be voted for up to about fifty out of 150\r\ncandidates. It is apparent that the average voter would have\r\ndifficulty in voting intelligently.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT WITHOUT A HEAD\r\n\r\nThe long ballot has other results than the mere difficulty of\r\nintelligent voting. One of these is a GOVERNMENT WITHOUT A HEAD.\r\nWhile the board of supervisors or commissioners is nominally at\r\nthe head of the county government, it has to work through the\r\nvarious administrative officers. These are also elected by the\r\npeople, and may be of the opposite political party. At all events,\r\nthey are independent of the board, not responsible to it, and may\r\nor may not work in harmony with it. A former member of a county\r\nboard in North Carolina says,\r\n\r\nMost persons are under the impression that the board of\r\ncommissioners, with its chairman, is at the head of the county\r\ngovernment. ... The board does have authority to say how about 19\r\ncents of the entire tax levy may be spent, but its authority over\r\nthe balance of the levy, over any county official, such as the\r\nsheriff, clerk of the court, coroner, constable, county judge, or\r\nrecorder, is nil. The chairman of the board does have the honor ...\r\nof smiling and trying to look pleasant when complaints are\r\nmade about bad roads, excessive tax assessments, or the\r\ndelinquency of some county subordinate, over whom neither he nor\r\nthe board has any control.[Footnote: M. S. Willard, North Carolina\r\nClub Year Book, 1918, p. 87.]\r\n\r\nTHE OPPORTUNITY OF THE \"BOSS\"\r\n\r\nAnother result of the long ballot is the opportunity it gives the\r\npolitical \"boss\" to control the selection of officers. It is not\r\nuncommon to hear rural citizens ask such questions as, \"What's the\r\nuse of farmers taking off time for politics when the whole thing\r\nis run by political bosses anyway?\"[Footnote: Graham Taylor, in\r\nRural Manhood, October, 1914, p. 328.] \"In such counties office-\r\nseeking has become not the means to the end of performing service,\r\nbut exists for the immediate reward, and whatever service is\r\nrendered to the people is incidental to that other object.\r\n\"[Footnote: H. S. Gilbertson, Forms of County Government, in the\r\nUniversity of North Carolina Record, No. 159, October, 1918, p.\r\n37.]\r\n\r\nBAD BUSINESS METHODS\r\n\r\nAlong with these defects, and largely because of them, bad\r\nbusiness methods have characterized county government, resulting\r\nin poor service and wastefulness of the people's money. A faulty\r\nsystem of keeping accounts is as unbusinesslike and disastrous in\r\npublic business as in private business.\r\n\r\nOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\nWhen I was first connected with the government of my own county, I\r\nbecame very much interested to know whether we were doing better\r\nor worse in the management of our road finances; in the cost of\r\nmaintaining our county prisoners; in the maintenance of our county\r\nhome and numerous other county institutions, than were other\r\ncounties. I was anxious to find out what was being done in other\r\ncounties in the way of appropriations for hospitals and I selected\r\ntwelve or fifteen counties and wrote letters to the county\r\nofficials asking for information. In answer to probably two of my\r\nletters I received intelligent and satisfactory replies. Probably\r\nhalf a dozen more gave me some figures which were of very little\r\nuse for purposes of comparison, and to my other letters I received\r\nno replies, although the first request was followed up by a second\r\nand a third letter. I then began an effort to secure copies of the\r\nnewspapers in which had been printed the financial statements of\r\nthe counties. I succeeded in securing probably ten statements and,\r\nafter a fruitless attempt to coordinate these statements so that I\r\nmight secure information which would enable me to know whether we\r\nwere doing better or worse than our neighbors, I became hopelessly\r\nlost in a jungle of statistics and reluctantly gave it up as\r\nuseless, and turned my attention to doing what I could to place\r\nour own county affairs in such condition that they could be\r\nunderstood by those of our taxpayers who might be inquisitive\r\nenough to want to know how the money was handled which they paid\r\nfor taxes. [Footnote: M. S. Willard, County Finances in North\r\nCarolina, in the University of North Carolina RECORD, No. 159,\r\nOctober, 1918, p. 80.]\r\n\r\nTHE FEE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe practice of compensating county officers from FEES received\r\nfor special services and of allowing them to retain the interest\r\non public money is one illustration of extravagant business\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nFor many of the services performed by county officers fees are\r\ncharged, on the principle that the person served should pay for\r\nthe service. It did not occur to the people to inquire how much\r\ntheir officers were getting in this way. In one county, in which\r\nthere was a large city, investigation showed that the sheriff had\r\na net income from fees and commissions of $15,000, the county\r\ntreasurer $23,000, and the county auditor over $50,000.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of economy and efficiency it is better to\r\npay all officers an adequate salary and to require that all fees,\r\ncommissions, and interest on public money be returned to the\r\ncounty treasury. It keeps the tax rate down and makes possible an\r\nincrease of service.\r\n\r\nThe county office fees and commissions in North Carolina amount to\r\nsomething like one and a quarter million dollars a year, if they\r\nare collected according to law. The total is large enough to pay\r\nall salaries in at least 58 counties of the state, and leave large\r\nbalances to apply to schools, roads, jail expenses, interest, and\r\nsinking funds. These large surpluses are being wasted in most of\r\nthe salary counties. [Footnote: E.C. Branson, The Fee System in\r\nNorth Carolina, in the University of North Carolina Record, No.\r\n159, October, 1918, p. 69.]\r\n\r\nSuch faulty business methods are gradually being corrected by the\r\nintroduction of the short ballot, as in California and elsewhere,\r\nby businesslike methods of keeping accounts, by the appointment of\r\ncounty and state auditors, and by giving full publicity to reports\r\nof county business.\r\n\r\nTHE FAULT WITH THE CITIZEN\r\n\r\n\"But after all,\" says the county official quoted above, \"a great\r\npart of the shortcomings of county officials and a great deal of\r\nthe looseness which prevails in the management of county affairs\r\ncan be charged to the citizen people themselves.\" Another student\r\nof the situation says,\r\n\r\nAmong the country people themselves there is no demand for better\r\nlocal government or almost none; they are satisfied or content\r\nthemselves with grumbling about taxes and in fierce partisan\r\npolitics. ... The country people of America lack an adequate sense\r\nof civic and social responsibility, and the deficiency is rising\r\ninto critical, national importance. [Footnote 2: E.C. Branson,\r\nReport of subcommittee on local government, National Country Life\r\nConference, Baltimore Proceedings, 1919, pp. 68, 69.]\r\n\r\nAnother says,\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be reformed in county government is not the\r\nofficers down at the courthouse, but our own attitude toward the\r\ncounty, and particularly toward public office. For, after all,\r\npublic officers in this country are just what the people make them ...\r\n[Footnote 3: H.S. Gilbertson, Forms of County Government, in\r\nthe University of North Carolina Record, No. 159, October, 1918,\r\np. 38.]\r\n\r\nThere are those who advocate breaking up the county into smaller\r\nunits for purposes of local self-government, as in New England.\r\nThomas Jefferson, living in Virginia where the county was the sole\r\nunit of local government, was a great admirer of the New England\r\ntown meeting, and said that \"public education and the subdivision\r\nof the counties into wards,\" or townships, were the \"two hooks\"\r\nupon which republican government must hang. On the other hand, we\r\nhave observed an opposite tendency to concentrate the\r\nadministration of schools, roads, health, and other matters, in\r\nthe county government (see pp. 294,325). The fact is that both the\r\norganization for centralized, county-wide government, and that for\r\nthe government of local communities within the county, have their\r\nuses. Neither can do its best work without the other. The problem\r\nis to deter mine what the business of each should be and to\r\nestablish a proper balance between them. One thing is sure,\r\nnamely, that the government of the county cannot be effective\r\nunless the people of the various communities within the county are\r\norganized to cooperate both for their local interests and for the\r\ninterests of the county as a whole. This may be provided for in\r\npart through township governments, where they exist, and in part\r\nthrough such unofficial organization as that described for the New\r\nEngland town (p. 402), or as that furnished by the farm bureau\r\nwith its local community committees (p. 30).\r\n\r\nOne of the most progressive states in the matter of county\r\ngovernment is North Carolina. One of the chief instruments by\r\nwhich this progress has been made is the NORTH CAROLINA CLUB,\r\norganized by the University of North Carolina for the study and\r\npromotion of the interests of the state. The North Carolina Club\r\nhas affiliated with it COUNTY CLUBS, each of which studies its own\r\ncounty and promotes its interests. In North Carolina they are\r\nworking in both directions suggested above: in the direction of an\r\neffective central county government, and in the direction of\r\norganization of all local communities for the study of needs and\r\nfor teamwork in providing for them. See references.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY AS A SUBDIVISION OF THE STATE\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in county government is the control\r\nexercised over it by the state. The county is not only a local\r\nself-governing unit, but it is also a division of the state for\r\nthe administration of state laws. Its powers of self-government\r\nare given to it by the state, and along with these powers it has\r\nimposed upon it certain duties for the state. First of all, the\r\ncounty is a STATE JUDICIAL DISTRICT. The most important building\r\nat the county seat is the courthouse. The COUNTY COURT is one of\r\nthe state courts described in the next chapter. The county judge\r\nis sometimes chosen by the people of the county, but he is really\r\na state officer. In New England the county is almost solely a\r\njudicial district, and in all states its judicial purposes are of\r\nsupreme importance.\r\n\r\nBut more than this, the county schools are a part of the state\r\nschool system and must be administered in accordance with state\r\nlaws, though by county and township officers. County officers must\r\nenforce the health laws of the state. County authorities not only\r\nlevy and collect county taxes, but also collect state taxes from\r\nresidents of the county.\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY FOR STATE CONTROL\r\n\r\nHere again we have an illustration of the necessity for a careful\r\nbalance between matters properly subject to local self-government\r\nand those properly subject to state control. Counties have\r\nsuffered both from too much state control in some respects, and\r\nfrom too little in others.\r\n\r\nThe whole state is injured ... if one township lets its\r\ncitizenship deteriorate through ignorance or drunkenness, and so\r\nthe state has a right to say that at least six months school term\r\nmust be given in every township and that no whiskey-selling shall\r\nbe permitted. Or if one township is infested with cattle ticks,\r\nother townships are injured, and so the state may set a minimum\r\nstandard here ...\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the citizens of one county pay more than\r\ntheir share of the state taxes because it has better methods of\r\nassessing and collecting taxes and of keeping accounts than other\r\ncounties in the state. One of the greatest needs of counties, and\r\none least provided for, is uniformity among the counties of a\r\nstate in methods of keeping accounts (see example on page 410).\r\nSome states have established state systems of auditing county\r\nfinances.\r\n\r\n\"HOME RULE\" FOR COUNTIES\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, state governments often interfere in matters\r\nthat might better be left to local determination. Usually all the\r\ncounties of a state have exactly the same form of government, with\r\nexactly the same officers who exercise exactly the same duties.\r\nYet some counties within a state are almost wholly rural, some are\r\nalmost wholly urban, others are mixed in character. A form of\r\ngovernment adapted to one may not be suited to another. So there\r\nhas arisen a demand for a larger degree of \"home rule\" in\r\ncounties. In Illinois, counties have had the right to determine\r\nfor themselves whether the township should or should not be given\r\nprominence in local government, and whether the \"supervisor\" or\r\nthe \"commissioner\" plan of government should be used. California\r\nnow has a law which provides that counties may apply for\r\n\"charters\" in the same way that cities do in all states. The\r\n\"charter,\" like a constitution, determines the form and powers of\r\nthe government, and is framed by the people of the county\r\nthemselves, though it must then have the approval of the state\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF URBAN COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nWe have noted how the growth of cities with their elaborate\r\norganization for service tends to divert attention from the less\r\nconspicuous county government. While probably half the counties of\r\nthe United States contain no city, or \"town,\" or village of 2500\r\npeople, there is in almost every township at least one compact\r\nsettlement that has grown up around the trading center. Sometimes\r\nthere are several of them in a township and many in a county. In\r\nsuch compact communities cooperation becomes necessary to provide\r\nfor needs that are not felt in more rural districts, such as paved\r\nstreets, sewers, public water supply, fire and police protection,\r\nand so on. A separate government becomes necessary. The people of\r\nsuch communities may appeal to the authorities of township,\r\ncounty, or state, for incorporation as a village, borough, town,\r\nor city. \"Village\" and \"borough\" are simply two names used in\r\ndifferent localities for the same thing. The difference between\r\nthem and an incorporated town or city is principally one of size\r\nand corresponding complexity of organization.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF VILLAGES AND INCORPORATED TOWNS\r\n\r\nThe chief governing body of a village, or borough, or incorporated\r\ntown, is a small council, or board, elected by the people. It has\r\nlegislative powers in a small way, enacting ORDINANCES for the\r\nregulation of local officers and in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan ... they may prescribe the terms and conditions for\r\nlicensing taverns, peddlers, and public vehicles. They have\r\ncontrol of streets, bridges and public grounds; and have authority\r\nto construct bridges and pavements, and to regulate the use and\r\nprevent the obstruction of the highways. They may establish and\r\nmaintain sewers and drains. They may construct and control public\r\nwharves, and regulate and license ferries. They may establish and\r\nregulate markets. They may provide a police force and a fire\r\ndepartment. They may construct or purchase and operate water works\r\nand lighting plants. They may own cemeteries, public pounds,\r\npublic buildings and parks.[Footnote: John A. Fairlie, Local\r\nGovernment in Counties, Towns, and Villages, pp. 207, 208.]\r\n\r\nThe council also has limited power to levy taxes and to borrow\r\nmoney for public purposes.\r\n\r\nThere is a chief executive officer, sometimes called MAYOR,\r\nsometimes president, or by other names. Subordinate to him are\r\nvarious other officers, such as the police marshal, the street\r\ncommissioner, fire marshal, tax assessor, treasurer, clerk, and so\r\non. In larger villages boards of health and other boards and\r\ncommissions exist to administer various forms of public service.\r\nThe village may also have its minor court presided over by a\r\njustice of the peace.\r\n\r\nCITY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nWhen villages or towns reach a certain population usually fixed by\r\nstate law, they may be incorporated as cities. The change that\r\ntakes place is simply one of elaborating the governing machinery\r\nand giving to it larger powers to correspond with the larger needs\r\nof city life. The complex problems of city government we shall not\r\nattempt to study in this book.\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN URBAN GOVERNMENT FOR BETTER SERVICE AND BETTER CONTROL\r\n\r\nGreat improvement in the government of towns and cities has been\r\nmade in recent years. The latest plan of government to be adopted,\r\nand it has spread to a considerable number of towns and cities in\r\nthe United States, is the CITY MANAGER, or TOWN MANAGER, form of\r\ngovernment. By this plan the voters elect a small council, or\r\nboard of directors, who in turn appoint a MANAGER who serves as a\r\nsuperintendent over the affairs of the city or town. He is a\r\ntrained specialist, often an engineer, and cities and towns\r\nsometimes search the country over for the best man available for\r\nthe place. The manager appoints the heads of the various\r\ndepartments of government, such as health, police, public works,\r\netc., and is responsible to the council for their work. It is the\r\napplication to town government of methods long used by successful\r\nbusiness corporations.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report upon:\r\n\r\nHow the county in Louisiana came to be called a \"parish.\"\r\n\r\nOrganization and powers of your county board.\r\n\r\nA list of your county officers and their duties.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment in your county with regard to the efficiency of your\r\ncounty government.

All of our states alike, whether created\r\nbefore or after the Union was formed, are self-governing under\r\nconstitutions of their own making.\r\n\r\nCounties and towns, cities and villages, have no powers of self-\r\ngovernment except those granted to them BY THE STATE. The national\r\ngovernment, also, may exercise only such powers as are given to it\r\nby the people VOTING AS STATES. Each state, on the other hand, is\r\nself-governing in its own right, and may exercise through its\r\ngovernment any power whatever, excepting only those which it\r\nvoluntarily surrendered upon entering the Union. (See pp. 94, 449;\r\nalso Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 10 and Art. IV.)\r\n\r\nTHE STATE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nThe state constitution is the supreme law of the state and is\r\nsupposed to represent the direct voice of the people. Since the\r\nUnion was formed, state constitutions have been framed by\r\nconventions of delegates elected especially for the purpose, and\r\nin most cases have been submitted to the people for their\r\nratification. Amendments may be proposed either by such\r\nconventions or by the state legislatures, but they must also be\r\nratified by the people. Some of the states have completely revised\r\ntheir constitutions several times, and amendments have been very\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF LENGTH OF STATE CONSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nState constitutions are long documents, containing a great deal of\r\ndetail regarding the organization and powers of government. In\r\nthis respect they differ from the national Constitution, which is\r\nbrief and speaks in broad, general terms. Recent constitutions are\r\nlonger than earlier ones, partly because there is a greater\r\nvariety of problems to be dealt with, but also because of a\r\ngrowing tendency to limit the powers of legislatures and\r\nadministrative officers.\r\n\r\nA REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nAfter a DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, which all state constitutions\r\ncontain, the constitution is concerned chiefly with the\r\norganization, powers and duties of the government. Each state may\r\norganize its government as it sees fit, provided only that it is\r\n\"republican\" in form as required by the federal Constitution (Art.\r\nIV, sec. 4). This means that it must be a form of representative\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nSEPARATION OF POWERS\r\n\r\nWhile the state governments differ from one another in matters of\r\ndetail, the general plan is the same in all. Each consists of\r\nthree branches: the legislative branch for lawmaking; the\r\nexecutive branch for law enforcement and administration; and the\r\njudicial branch for the interpretation of the laws and for the\r\nadministration of justice in accordance with the law. These three\r\nbranches are organized on the principle of a SEPARATION OF POWERS,\r\nto prevent encroachment by one upon the powers of the others, and\r\nto make each a check upon the powers of the others.\r\n\r\nIn the government of this commonwealth, the legislative department\r\nshall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either\r\nof them; the executive shall never exercise the legislative and\r\njudicial powers, or either of them; the judicial shall never\r\nexercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them;\r\nto the end it may be a government of laws, and not of men.\r\n[Footnote: Constitution of Massachusetts, Part I, Art. XXX.]\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe meaning of \"a government of laws, and not of men.\"\r\n\r\nThe entrance of your state into the Union.\r\n\r\nThe history of your present state constitution.\r\n\r\nThe powers surrendered by your state when it entered the Union.\r\n\r\nCompare the length of your state constitution with that of the\r\nfederal Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe principal parts of which your constitution is composed.\r\n\r\nNumber of amendments to your state constitution. When the latest\r\namendments were adopted and why.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of rights in your state constitution.\r\n\r\nChecks exercised by the legislature upon the executive and\r\njudicial branches; by the executive upon the legislative and\r\njudicial branches; by the judicial upon the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNOR\r\n\r\nThe chief executive officer of the state is the governor, who is\r\nelected by the people for a term which varies, in the different\r\nstates, from one to four years. It is his duty to see that the\r\nlaws of the state are faithfully executed. The constitution makes\r\nhim the commander-in-chief of the state militia, which he may call\r\nupon to enforce the laws or to quell disorders. It also gives him\r\nthe power to pardon persons convicted of crime, in the exercise of\r\nwhich power he is sometimes assisted by a special board of pardons\r\nand sometimes by the legislature; but the consideration of the\r\npleas of such persons and their friends for pardon often consumes\r\nmuch of his time.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNOR'S VARIED DUTIES\r\n\r\nA great deal of the governor's time is also taken up with duties\r\ndevolving upon him as the official representative of the state on\r\nceremonial occasions, as in the laying of corner-stones of public\r\nbuildings, attending state fairs, and making speeches at public\r\nmeetings of all kinds. By virtue of his office he is also a member\r\nof many boards and commissions whose meetings he must attend.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNOR'S PART IN LAWMAKING\r\n\r\nThe governor also has some part in lawmaking. In all states except\r\nNorth Carolina he has the power to VETO bills passed by the\r\nlegislature. This check upon the legislature is not absolute, for\r\nthe legislature may overcome the governor's veto by again passing\r\nthe bill, usually by a two-thirds vote. The governor may also\r\ninfluence legislation by means of his messages to the legislature\r\nin which he recommends measures which he believes should be\r\nenacted into law. In case of opposition by the legislature, the\r\ngovernor often carries his proposals directly to the people, who\r\nquickly make known whether or not they support him. The governor\r\nmay call special sessions of the legislature to consider measures\r\nof especial importance.\r\n\r\nGROWING INFLUENCE OF THE GOVERNOR\r\n\r\nThe governor is a more influential officer today than he was in\r\nthe early part of our history. In colonial times he was the direct\r\nrepresentative of the king, or of the colonial proprietor, and the\r\npeople sought in every way to limit his powers. After the colonies\r\nbecame states this habitual fear of the governor continued, and he\r\nwas placed under the control of the legislature. As time went on,\r\nhowever, the legislature fell under the suspicion of the people,\r\nwhile the governor was more and more looked to as their leader.\r\nThus, for example, the veto power was given to him, increasing his\r\ninfluence while it curbed that of the legislature.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS OF THE STATE EXECUTIVE\r\n\r\nBut the power and influence of the governor are by no means as\r\ngreat in relation to state government as are the powers of the\r\nPresident in relation to the national government. In fact, the\r\nexecutive branch of our state governments has been notoriously\r\nweak, and its weakness is of the same kind as that noted in county\r\ngovernment: the lack of an effective, responsible head.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF STATE WITH NATIONAL EXECUTIVE\r\n\r\nIn our national government the executive power is concentrated in\r\nthe hands of one man. State constitutions seem to confer the same\r\npowers upon the governor. The constitution of Indiana says, \"The\r\nexecutive powers of the State shall be vested in a Governor\"; and\r\nthat of Pennsylvania says, \"The supreme executive power shall be\r\nvested in the Governor.\" But the Pennsylvania constitution also\r\nsays, \"The executive department shall consist of a Governor,\r\nLieutenant Governor, Secretary of the Commonwealth, Attorney\r\nGeneral, Auditor General, State Treasurer, Secretary of Internal\r\nAffairs and a Superintendent of Public Instruction\" (Art. IV, Sec.\r\nI). Four of these officers besides the governor are elected by the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBEWILDERING COMPLEXITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES\r\n\r\nIn all states the governor \"shall take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed\" (Pennsylvania constitution). For the\r\nexecution of the laws, however, he is dependent not only upon a\r\nnumber of principal executive officers such as those named above,\r\nbut also upon a large number of less important administrative\r\nofficers. Governor Lowden, of Illinois, a few years ago said:\r\n\r\nAdministrative agencies have been multiplied in bewildering\r\nconfusion. They have been created without reference to their\r\nability economically and effectively to administer the laws.\r\nSeparate boards govern the penitentiaries, the reformatories, and\r\nthe educational institutions. Several boards and commissions have\r\ncharge of matters affecting the agricultural interests.\r\nAdministration of laws affecting labor is parceled out among\r\nnumerous agencies, including several boards having jurisdiction of\r\nmining problems and several free employment agencies, each\r\nindependent of the other. Our finance administration is chaotic,\r\nillogical and confused.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the health laws is divided between boards\r\nand commissions, with no effective means of coordination. Our\r\neducational agencies are not harmonious. Over one hundred\r\nofficers, boards, agencies, commissions, institutions and\r\ndepartments are charged with the administration of our laws. No\r\nsystematic organization exists, and no adequate control can be\r\nexercised ... Under the present system the governor cannot\r\nexercise the supervision and control which the people have a right\r\nto demand. [Footnote: Charles E. Woodward, \"The Illinois Civil\r\nAdministrative Code,\" reprinted from Proceedings, Academy of\r\nPolitical Science, July, 1918.]\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR LACKS POWER TO MEET HIS RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs is characteristic of state governments\r\ngenerally. Some of the numerous officers are appointed by the\r\ngovernor, but many of them are elected by the people or appointed\r\nby the legislature. Their terms of office do not coincide with\r\nthat of the governor, so that he finds in office many persons whom\r\nhe did not appoint, and whom he cannot remove. Often they may be\r\nof an opposite political party. Thus the very organization of the\r\nstate executive department is such as to make it impossible for\r\nthe governor to perform the duty, imposed upon him by the\r\nconstitution, of seeing to it that the laws are faithfully\r\nexecuted. It must be remembered, moreover, that the execution of\r\nthe laws is also dependent largely upon a multitude of local\r\nofficers over whom the state exercises little control. It is\r\napparent how imperfect must be the teamwork of the people through\r\nthis organization.\r\n\r\nUNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS AT POPULAR CONTROL\r\n\r\nWhy have the people put up with this sort of thing? For one thing,\r\nthey have not understood where the trouble lies. There is also\r\nseen the influence of the political \"boss,\" who thrives under this\r\nconfusion. But among the causes is the desire of the people to\r\nmaintain control over government. They have attempted, in their\r\nconstitutions, not only to say just what services should be\r\nperformed for them, but also to specify just what machinery should\r\nbe used for their performance. For every new service, they have\r\ncreated a new and independent piece of machinery. Then, to make\r\ntheir control complete, as they thought, they have made most of\r\ntheir new officers elective. Experience has shown that control of\r\nthis kind has been gained only at the sacrifice of efficient\r\nservice, through failure to provide trained leadership and\r\neffective organization. Moreover, experience has also shown that\r\ncontrol of this kind is largely a delusion; for the people cannot\r\nkeep in touch with their multitude of officers, and in many cases\r\nyield their control, often unknowingly, to the political \"boss.\"\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT NECESSARY TO PROGRESS\r\n\r\nIn noting these defects, it is not to be concluded that our state\r\ngovernments have been a failure in all respects. Far from it.\r\nNotable progress has been made toward the ideals toward which we\r\nhave been striving. We have tried one experiment after another,\r\nsome of which have been highly successful, but others of which\r\nhave not met the test of new conditions. It is important, however,\r\nthat we should face our failures squarely and profit by them.\r\n\r\nREORGANIZATION OF EXECUTIVE\r\n\r\nAt the present time there is a marked effort to overcome the\r\ndefects that we have just noted, and a good deal of progress\r\ntoward it has been made in some states. One of the most\r\nprogressive states in this particular is Illinois, which has\r\nrecently enacted a law for the reorganization of its executive\r\nbranch of government.\r\n\r\nUnder the new \"Civil Administrative Code\" of Illinois, the\r\nexecutive branch of government is organized in nine departments:\r\nthe departments of finance, of agriculture, of labor, of mines and\r\nminerals, of public works and buildings, of public welfare, of\r\npublic health, of trade and commerce, and of registration and\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nAt the head of each department is a director, who is appointed by\r\nthe governor, is responsible to him, and whose term of office is\r\nthe same as that of the governor.\r\n\r\nEach department is organized into various bureaus, or other\r\nsubdivisions, with officers in charge who are directly responsible\r\nto the director of the department. Thus, in the department of\r\nagriculture there is an assistant director, a general manager of\r\nthe state fair, a superintendent of foods and dairies, a\r\nsuperintendent of animal industry, a superintendent of plant\r\nindustry, a chief veterinarian, a chief game and fish warden, and\r\na food standard commission of three members.\r\n\r\nAll subordinate employees in all departments are appointed under a\r\ncivil service law which requires competitive examinations.\r\n\r\nAssociated with most of the departments are \"advisory boards\"\r\nconsisting of citizens who serve without pay. Thus, the department\r\nof agriculture has a board of agricultural advisers composed of\r\nfifteen persons, and a board of state fair advisers of nine\r\npersons, not more than three of whom shall be appointed from any\r\none county.\r\n\r\nThe things aimed at in this reorganization are: (I) fixing\r\nresponsibility for the entire service-organization in one place--\r\nwith the governor; (2) responsible, trained leadership in each\r\ndepartment of service; (3) responsiveness of leadership to the\r\npeople's wants, as provided for by the advisory boards; (4) a\r\nsystem of accounting and records that will make for efficiency and\r\neconomy, and that will inform the people as well as the officers\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nThe name of the governor of your state, his political party, when\r\nelected, for how long a term.\r\n\r\nAdvantages and disadvantages of a long term for the governor.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional powers of the governor of your state.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the governor of your state with the people.\r\n\r\nThe principal executive and administrative officers of your state.\r\nThose that are elective and those that are appointive.\r\n\r\nA complete list of the administrative bureaus, boards,\r\ncommissions, and other state agencies, with their duties.\r\n\r\nThe application of Governor Lowden's statement regarding Illinois\r\nto your state.\r\n\r\nAny proposed reorganization of the executive branch of your state\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nTHE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH\r\n\r\nThe legislative branch of government consists, in all states, of a\r\nlegislature (\"general assembly,\" \"legislative assembly,\" or\r\n\"general court\") composed of two \"houses\" or \"chambers,\" the house\r\nof representatives and the senate. The senate is the \"upper\r\nhouse,\" and is usually from one-third to one-half the size of the\r\n\"lower house\"; in Massachusetts only one-sixth the size.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO HOUSES\r\n\r\nA bill to become a law must pass both houses separately, each\r\nhouse acting as a check upon the other, thus securing greater\r\ndeliberation in lawmaking. The senate is supposed to be, and\r\nusually is, a more conservative, or cautious, body than the house\r\nof representatives, partly because of its smaller size which makes\r\npossible a more careful consideration of business. Its members are\r\nelected from larger districts, thus increasing the opportunity to\r\nselect able men. A higher age qualification is required for\r\nmembership in the senate than in the house of representatives; and\r\nonly a part of the senate is elected at each election, so that it\r\nis a continuing body, always containing members of experience,\r\nwhile the lower house may be almost entirely changed at each\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nDEFECTS IN DISTRIBUTION OF REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nIt is a theory of our representative government that\r\nrepresentation should be proportional to population. To secure\r\nthis result, each state is divided into election districts\r\npresumably of as nearly equal population as possible, the\r\nsenatorial districts being the larger. In practice, however, these\r\ndistricts do not always have representation proportional to their\r\npopulation. The county is often the unit of representation, or in\r\nNew England the town, and these districts vary greatly in\r\npopulation. An attempt is made to equalize the difference by\r\nproviding that no district shall have less than one\r\nrepresentative, and often that none shall have more than a certain\r\nnumber. Inequalities nevertheless exist. In Connecticut, thirty-\r\nfour of the most populous towns and cities have sixty-eight\r\nmembers in the lower house, whereas if the distribution were made\r\non the basis of population they would be entitled to 186 members.\r\nAgain, four of the smallest Connecticut towns, with a total\r\npopulation of 1567, have five members; four of the most populous\r\ncities, containing 309,982 inhabitants, have only eight members,\r\nwhereas on the basis of population they would be entitled to\r\neighty-seven. [Footnote: C.A., Beard, America Government and\r\nPolitics, p. 521.]\r\n\r\nPartisan influences often enter into the districting of states for\r\nrepresentation, the party in power trying to fix boundaries so as\r\nto ensure keeping their majority in the legislature.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on the following:\r\n\r\nNumber of members in the lower and upper houses of your\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nQualifications for membership and term of office in each house.\r\n\r\nNames of your own representative and senator.\r\n\r\nSecure a map showing legislative districts of your state. Locate\r\nyour own.\r\n\r\nWhether representation in your legislature is proportional to\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe \"gerrymander\": what is it, and has it been used in your state?\r\n\r\nThe legislature controls our lives at almost every turn.\r\n\r\nIt has control over the whole domain of civil law; [Footnote 2:\r\nSee below, p. 437.] that is, it lays down the rules governing\r\ncontracts, real and personal property, inheritance, corporations,\r\nmortgages, marriage and divorce, and other civil matters. It\r\ndefines crime; that is, it prescribes those actions of the citizen\r\nwhich are to be punished by fine or imprisonment or death. It\r\ntouches the property of the citizen not only by regulating its\r\nuse, but also by imposing upon it a burden of taxation. Finally,\r\nit has control over the vast domain known as the police power,\r\nunder which it makes regulations concerning public health, morals,\r\nand welfare, devises rules for the conduct of business and\r\nprofessions, and in other ways restrains the liberty of the\r\ncitizen to do as he pleases. [Footnote 3: C.A. Beard, America\r\nGovernment and Politics,, p. 516.]\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE TOWARD THEIR LEGISLATURES\r\n\r\nIn view of this importance, it would seem that the people would\r\nhave the keenest interest in their state legislatures and the\r\ngreatest respect for them. This has not always been the case. As\r\none writer says, \"it has become almost fashionable\" to speak\r\nslightingly of legislatures and their members, and to talk of them\r\nas if they were wholly corrupt and dishonorable. If the very best\r\nmen the community affords are not always chosen for the difficult\r\nand responsible work of lawmaking, the people have no one to blame\r\nbut themselves. Moreover, the members of our legislatures average\r\nup very much like their neighbors, and most of them are sincerely\r\ndesirous of serving their state and do so to the fullest extent\r\npossible under the conditions that exist.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed time that a different attitude should be assumed\r\ntoward these bodies. ... Acquaintance with actual legislatures\r\nwill immediately reveal the fact that they are fairly\r\nrepresentative of the American people, and that there is in them,\r\na great deal of honest effort to grapple with the difficult\r\nproblems of legislation. ... Before all, there ought to be a\r\nsustained effort to support the men who are with honest purpose\r\nstruggling for equitable and effective legislation. ...[Footnote:\r\nPaul S. Reinsch, American Legislatures and Legislative Methods, p.\r\n126.]\r\n\r\n DIFFICULTIES OF WISE LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nMost of the unwise and harmful legislation has been due, not to\r\nwrong intentions on the part of legislators, but to the difficulty\r\nencountered by a body of men of average intelligence and of little\r\nexperience in dealing with public questions, in getting\r\ninformation necessary to enable them to decide wisely with respect\r\nto the multitude of complicated problems that come before them\r\nduring the brief session of the legislature.\r\n\r\nIn the lower house of one typical legislature only 19 out of the\r\n252 members had ever been members of a legislature before, 123\r\nwere farmers, 6 lawyers, 10 physicians, 48 merchants and\r\nmanufacturers, 3 bankers, 5 preachers, 6 insurance men, 2 hotel\r\nproprietors, 3 liverymen, 14 laborers or artisans, 6 \"apparently\r\nwith no occupation except that of general politician and office-\r\nseeker.\"\r\n\r\nOf the thirty members of the senate of the same legislature, 9\r\nwere farmers, 4 lawyers, 4 physicians, and 13 merchants. Seven of\r\nthese had completed their education in \"academies,\" while 13 had\r\nnever got beyond the public schools.\r\n\r\nThese men had to decide, in the course of a few weeks, upon an\r\nastonishing variety of problems, some of them of the greatest\r\ncomplexity, and all of them affecting the lives of the citizens of\r\nthe state in a multitude of ways. It is not surprising that\r\nserious mistakes are sometimes made. [Footnote: C. A. Beard,\r\nAmerican Government and Politics, p. 525 (from S. P. Orth, \"Our\r\nState Legislatures,\" Atlantic Monthly, vol. xciv, pp. 728 ff.)]\r\n\r\nThe mere writing of a bill in language that will convey the exact\r\nmeaning intended, and that will not involve undesirable and\r\nunexpected results, is a difficult matter that requires the skill\r\nof men trained for it.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE REFERENCE BUREAUS\r\n\r\nIn a number of states an attempt has been made to meet these\r\nnatural difficulties by the establishment of legislative reference\r\nlibraries, or bureaus, in charge of highly trained students who\r\ncollect all available information relating to every possible\r\nsubject of legislation, keep records of legislation in other\r\nstates, and place the material in convenient form at the disposal\r\nof the legislators. Sometimes they provide expert service in the\r\nwriting of bills in the proper form. It is said that such\r\nlegislative reference bureaus have already greatly improved the\r\nquality of legislation in some of the states.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible for a legislature, acting as a body, to\r\ngive consideration to more than a small fraction of the bills that\r\ncome before it.\r\n\r\nIt is said that it is not unusual for more than 2500 bills to be\r\nintroduced at a single session. Legislatures are in session from\r\n40 to 90 days. If the session were 60 days, and the working day 10\r\nhours, there would be but 15 minutes for each of 2500 bills. This\r\ntime would be divided between the two houses. Besides, a great\r\ndeal of business must be transacted other than the consideration\r\nand passage of bills.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE SYSTEM OF LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nTo make possible the handling of all this work, each house is\r\norganized in standing committees. As bills are introduced, they\r\nare referred to their appropriate committees, in which most of the\r\nwork of lawmaking is done. Most of the bills so referred are never\r\nreported back to the legislature at all, and those that are\r\nreported are in most cases acted upon by the legislature in\r\naccordance with the committees' reports, with little general\r\ndiscussion. The procedure followed in referring bills to\r\ncommittees and in considering them when they are reported back is\r\ndetermined by a complexity of rules that are confusing to the\r\noutsider and that cannot be explained in detail here. But their\r\ndeclared purpose is to save time and to enable the legislative\r\nbusiness to move smoothly. The small committees can work to better\r\nadvantage than the large body of men in either chamber. The work\r\nis divided up so that the few members of each committee can\r\nconcentrate their attention upon a few subjects and gain\r\nexperience in handling special kinds of problems.\r\n\r\nINVISIBLE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is to this organization that we owe some of\r\nthe bad lawmaking for which our legislatures are blamed. It tends\r\nto remove legislation from the control of the people, and results\r\nin what is often called \"invisible government,\" government that is\r\ncarried on out of sight of the people. It opens a door to partisan\r\ninfluences and to control by political \"bosses\" and self-seeking\r\n\"interests.\" In the lower house the committees are appointed by\r\nthe speaker, who is the presiding officer, and who is always\r\nchosen by the members of the majority party in the house from\r\ntheir own number. The senate committees are sometimes appointed by\r\nthe presiding officer of the senate, who is often the lieutenant-\r\ngovernor, and sometimes elected by the senate itself. But the\r\nchairmen and the majority of the members of all committees in both\r\nhouses belong to the majority party, which is thus enabled to\r\ncontrol legislation for partisan ends if it so desires, and it\r\noften does so.\r\n\r\nEVILS OF THE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nBills may be \"killed\" in committee, or reported unfavorably, or so\r\namended as to change their meaning entirely, merely at the will of\r\nthe party leaders, or of \"bosses\" and interests outside of the\r\nlegislature. A large part of the work of the committees is carried\r\non in secret. Although \"hearings\" may be held at which citizens\r\nmay present arguments for and against proposed measures, these may\r\nbe mere matters of form. Influential interests may maintain a\r\nlobby at the legislature, which means that they are represented\r\nthere by agents who seek to influence the members of the\r\nlegislature, and especially of the committees, sometimes by\r\ncorrupt methods. The lobby often works by secret methods, whereas\r\nthe \"hearings\" are public.\r\n\r\nThe party leaders in control, of whom the most important are the\r\nspeaker of the house, the rules committee, the chairmen of\r\ncommittees, and the \"floor manager,\" by dictating the procedure to\r\nbe followed, may at times make it practically impossible for a\r\nmember of the minority party, or one who has incurred the\r\ndispleasure of the leaders, to gain a hearing. The following\r\ndescription gives an idea of what may happen: [Footnote: From a\r\npamphlet issued by the Illinois Legislative Voters' League in\r\n1903, and quoted by C. A. Beard, American Government and Politics,\r\npp 539, 540.]\r\n\r\nConsider the petty annoyances to which a decent member outside the\r\n\"organization\" may be subjected, and the methods by which\r\nlegitimate legislation, backed by him, may be blocked. The bill\r\ngoes to an unfriendly committee. The chairman refuses to call the\r\ncommittee together, or when forced to call it, a quorum does not\r\nattend. ... Action may be postponed on various pretexts, or the\r\nbill may be referred to a sub-committee. The committee may kill\r\nthe bill by laying it on the table. On the other hand, the\r\ncommittee may decide that the bill be reported to the house to\r\npass. Then a common practice is for the chairman to pocket the\r\nbill, delaying to report it to the house till too late to pass it.\r\nWhen finally reported to the house, it goes on the calendar to be\r\nread a first time in its order. Then begins the advancing of bills\r\nby unanimous consent, without waiting to reach them in order. Here\r\nis where the organization has absolute control. Unanimous consent\r\nis subject to the speaker's acuteness of hearing. His hearing is\r\nsharpened or dulled according to the good standing of the objector\r\nor of the member pushing the bill. If one not friendly to the\r\nhouse \"organization\" wants to have his bill considered over an\r\nobjection, he must move to suspend the rules. The speaker may\r\nrefuse to recognize him, or may put his motion and declare it\r\ncarried or not carried as suits his and the organization's\r\ndesires. So the pet bills are jumped over others ahead of them on\r\nthe calendar, while\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a pamphlet issued by the Illinois Legislative\r\nVoters' League in 1903, and quoted by C. A. Beard, American\r\nGovernment and Politics, pp 539, 540.] the ones not having the\r\nbacking of the house \"organization\" are retired farther and\r\nfarther down until their ultimate passage becomes hopeless. If the\r\nbill of the independent member reaches a second reading, it may be\r\nkilled by striking out the enacting clause or by tacking on an\r\nobnoxious amendment that makes it repulsive to its former friends. ...\r\nTo carry out the will of the organization, the speaker\r\ndeclares amendments carried or the contrary by a viva voce vote.\r\nDemands for roll-calls are ignored by him in violation of the\r\nmembers' constitutional rights. ...\r\n\r\nEFFORTS TO CURB POWER OF LEGISLATURES\r\n\r\nIt is such practices as these that have brought state legislatures\r\ninto bad repute, and that have resulted in measures to curb their\r\npower. Instead of leaving it entirely to them to make their own\r\nrules of procedure, many of these rules are now prescribed by the\r\nstate constitutions. It was in order to restrain the legislatures\r\nthat the veto power has been given to the governors of all states\r\nbut one, and that sessions of legislatures have been limited to\r\nbrief periods of from forty to ninety days, and then only once in\r\ntwo years. For the same reason state constitutions have taken away\r\npowers that legislatures once commonly abused, as in running the\r\nstate deeply into debt, or in legislating in the interest of\r\nparticular localities or particular groups; and have provided in\r\ngreat detail for many things that were formerly left to the\r\ndiscretion of the legislatures. For the same reason some states\r\nhave adopted the initiative and referendum.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nPowers possessed by either house of your legislature not possessed\r\nby the other.\r\n\r\nPowers denied your legislature by the federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nPowers denied your legislature by your state constitution.\r\nReasons.\r\n\r\nAttitude of the people of your community toward your legislature.\r\n\r\nWhy service in the legislature does not attract more of the most\r\ncapable men of the state.\r\n\r\nThe vocations of the members of your legislature.\r\n\r\nNumber of bills introduced, and the number passed, at the last\r\nsession of your legislature.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of some of the most important laws enacted by your\r\nlegislature at its last session.\r\n\r\nWhy it is difficult to write a bill correctly.\r\n\r\nThe legislative reference library, or bureau, of your state (if\r\nany).\r\n\r\nThe committees in each house of your legislature.\r\n\r\nProcedure by which a bill becomes a law in your state.\r\n\r\nThe speaker of the House of Representatives in your state.\r\n\r\n\"Invisible government\" in your state.\r\n\r\nLaws regulating the \"lobby\" in your state. Frequency and length of\r\nlegislative sessions in your state.\r\n\r\nINEFFICIENT BUSINESS METHODS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\nSome of the greatest abuses of governing power have been in\r\nconnection with the appropriation of money. They have been due not\r\nso much to dishonesty as to bad organization and loose business\r\nmethods, both in the executive and legislative branches of\r\ngovernment. When the executive branch consists of a large number\r\nof more or less independent parts, each trying to make the best\r\nshowing possible, it is quite to be expected that each will seek\r\nto get from the public treasury all the money possible without\r\nreference to the needs of other parts or to the resources of the\r\nstate. When, in addition, there is no central executive authority\r\nwith power to hold the heads of the various parts responsible for\r\ntheir acts, and no uniform or businesslike system of keeping\r\naccounts, either of money expended or of work accomplished, it is\r\neasy to see the opportunity for wastefulness and inefficiency.\r\n\r\nWASTEFUL METHODS OF MAKING APPROPRIATIONS\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the methods of making appropriations in the\r\nlegislature have been equally conducive to wastefulness.\r\nAppropriation bills pass through the same legislative machinery as\r\nall other bills and are subject to the same dangers. Moreover,\r\nthey are handled by different committees that act as independently\r\nof one another as do the various executive departments. In\r\nIllinois, for example, until recently \"requests for appropriations\r\nwere submitted informally by each office, department, or board;\r\nand separate bills were prepared by the several departments and\r\ninstitutions, and introduced by individual members of the General\r\nAssembly,\" l[Footnote: John A. Fairlie, Budget Methods in\r\nIllinois, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social\r\nScience, November, 1915; quoted by W. F. Willoughby, in The\r\nMovement for Budgetary Reform in the States, p. 45.] then being\r\nreferred to different committees according to the subjects to\r\nwhich they related. At the session of 1913, 94 separate\r\nappropriation acts were passed.\r\n\r\nTHE BUDGET SYSTEM\r\n\r\nA number of the states have sought to remedy this defect in\r\ngovernment by the adoption of a budget system (see Chapter XIII).\r\nIllinois has perhaps made the complete reform in this matter. We\r\nhave already seen how that state has reorganized its executive\r\nbranch of government, which is the first necessary step. In this\r\nreorganization there was created a finance department, to which\r\nall the administrative departments submit a careful estimate of\r\nthe money needed for their various lines of work, together with a\r\ndetailed statement of work done and money spent during the two\r\npreceding years. The finance department considers all these\r\nstatements and estimates in their relation to one another and to\r\nthe financial resources available for the next two years, and\r\nsubmits to the governor a comprehensive and detailed budget. On\r\nthe basis of this, a single appropriation bill is prepared by a\r\nsingle committee of the legislature. Public hearings are held, the\r\npeople are given opportunity to know just what the government has\r\ndone and intends to do, and the governor and his finance\r\ndepartment may be held responsible.\r\n\r\nNo single change would add so largely to both democracy and\r\nefficiency as the introduction of proper budget methods.\r\n[Footnote: Foreword to Public Budgets, Annals of the American\r\nAcademy of Political and Social Science, November, 1915; quoted by\r\nW. F. Willoughby, The Movement for Budgetary Reform in the States,\r\np. 2.]\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nMethod of making appropriations in your state.\r\n\r\nMovement for a budget system in your state.\r\n\r\nWhy a budget system tends toward (1) economy, (2) efficiency, (3)\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIAL BRANCH\r\n\r\nQuestions are continually arising as to the meaning of laws, or as\r\nto how they apply in particular cases. To answer these questions\r\nthe judicial branch of government exists, comprising a system of\r\ncourts. The courts are sometimes called upon to decide whether a\r\nlaw passed by the legislature, or an act of an administrative\r\nofficer, is in harmony with the constitution, and if not, to\r\ndeclare such law or act invalid. The judicial branch of government\r\nis therefore the people's organization to keep the other branches\r\nof government within their constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nCIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES\r\n\r\nIn most cases that come before the courts, however, the law is\r\nperfectly clear when once the facts in the case are known. It is\r\ntherefore the business of the courts also to ascertain the facts.\r\nThere are two classes of cases that come before the courts, civil\r\ncases and criminal cases; and the law that applies to the two\r\nclasses is known as civil law and criminal law. A civil case is\r\none that involves a dispute between individuals, or an injury done\r\nby one individual to another. Such would be a dispute over a\r\nboundary line between the properties of two individuals, or over\r\nthe payment of a debt; or a personal injury due to the\r\ncarelessness of some one, or an injury to property or to health\r\nthrough maintaining a nuisance of some kind. In such cases the\r\ncourt, after ascertaining the facts, merely sees that justice is\r\ndone, as by the payment of damages to the injured party by the one\r\ndoing the injury. A criminal case is one in which a person is\r\ncharged with having violated a law of the community. The injury is\r\none against the community as a whole, and not merely against an\r\nindividual. It is the community that appears in court against the\r\naccused person, and not merely one of his neighbors. In such cases\r\nthe court first ascertains the guilt or innocence of the accused\r\nperson; and if he is guilty, imposes a PUNISHMENT upon him, such\r\nas a fine, or imprisonment, or even death, according to the nature\r\nof the crime.\r\n\r\nThe judicial branch of government, then, is that part of the\r\ngovernmental organization that seeks to adjust, by peaceful and\r\njust means, the inevitable conflicts that arise in community life.\r\n\r\nJUSTICES' COURTS\r\n\r\nThe lowest in the series of state courts are the JUSTICES' COURTS,\r\nof which there is at least one in every township. They are\r\npresided over by justices of the peace. Only cases of small moment\r\ncome before justices' courts: civil cases involving very small\r\namounts, and cases of minor infractions of the law punishable by\r\nsmall fines or by short terms in jail. Persons accused of more\r\nserious crimes may have a preliminary examination in a justice's\r\ncourt and, if the evidence warrants it, be committed to jail to\r\nawait the action of the grand jury (see below). Most cases in a\r\njustice's court are disposed of by the justice of the peace alone;\r\nbut a jury trial may be demanded in all criminal cases, and in\r\ncivil suits \"where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty\r\ndollars\" (Const., Amendments VI, VII).\r\n\r\nCOUNTY COURTS\r\n\r\nMore serious cases, civil or criminal, are tried in the COUNTY, or\r\nDISTRICT, courts before a judge and a JURY. Cases that have been\r\ntried in a justice's court may be APPEALED to the county or\r\ndistrict court, where there is sure to be a jury trial, and where\r\nthe judge is more learned in the law than is a justice of the\r\npeace. It is the business of the jury to decide on the facts in\r\nthe case on the evidence furnished in the trial, and in civil\r\ncases to award the amount of damages, if any, to be paid; while\r\nthe judge sees that the procedure is in accordance with the law,\r\ninstructs the jury as to the law in the case, and in criminal\r\ncases fixes the penalty within the limits permitted by the law.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNITY IN COURT\r\n\r\nIt was stated above that in criminal cases it is the COMMUNITY\r\nthat appears against the accused. The community appears in the\r\nperson of the district attorney, otherwise called the prosecuting\r\nattorney, state's attorney, or county solicitor. It is the\r\nbusiness of this officer to gather evidence of crimes committed in\r\nthe community and, in most cases, to submit it to the GRAND JURY,\r\nwhich is a body of citizens carefully chosen to consider such\r\nevidence. If the grand jury considers the evidence against the\r\naccused sufficient to warrant bringing him to trial, it brings in\r\nan INDICTMENT against him. The prosecuting attorney then\r\nprosecutes the case for the community against the accused. It is\r\nof course his duty to secure exact justice; sometimes, however, he\r\nseems interested only in securing the CONVICTION of the accused.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED\r\n\r\nOur state and national constitutions seek to protect carefully the\r\nrights of a person accused of crime. He is assumed to be innocent\r\nuntil he has been proved otherwise. He is guaranteed a \"speedy and\r\npublic trial, by an impartial jury.\" He must be \"confronted with\r\nwitnesses against him,\" and have \"compulsory process for obtaining\r\nwitnesses in his favor,\" and \"assistance of counsel for his\r\ndefense\" (Const., Amendment VI). He cannot be compelled to be a\r\nwitness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or\r\nproperty, without \"due process of law\" (Amendment V). \"Excessive\r\nbail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel\r\nand unusual punishments inflicted.\" (Amendment VIII).\r\n\r\nCIRCUIT OR SUPERIOR COURTS\r\n\r\nIn some states there is another set of courts immediately above\r\nthe county courts, known as CIRCUIT, DISTRICT, or SUPERIOR,\r\ncourts. The districts in which these courts have jurisdiction\r\ninclude several counties. The cases courts handled by them are\r\neither cases of appeal from the lower courts, or cases of greater\r\nimportance than those over which the lower courts have\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE SUPREME COURT\r\n\r\nThe highest court in the state is the SUPREME COURT, sometimes\r\ncalled the COURT OF APPEALS, or the COURT OF ERRORS. In the\r\nsupreme court several judges sit together, and there is no jury.\r\nThe cases that come before it are for the most part cases of\r\nappeal from the lower courts, although there are certain classes\r\nof cases that come before it in the first instance. The supreme\r\ncourt is the final judge as to whether acts of the legislature are\r\nin conformity with the state constitution.\r\n\r\nOTHER COURTS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the courts named above there are sometimes others\r\nto deal with special classes of cases. In cities there are\r\nMUNICIPAL COURTS and POLICE COURTS, both in the same class with\r\njustices' courts. There are JUVENILE COURTS to deal with juvenile\r\noffenders; PROBATE, or SURROGATE, COURTS to settle the estates of\r\npersons who have died; COURTS OF CLAIMS to settle claims against\r\nthe state; and CHANCERY COURTS, or courts of EQUITY, which\r\nadminister justice in cases that the ordinary law will not reach.\r\n\r\nFor example, the LAW will permit a man's property to be taken to\r\nsatisfy a mortgage; EQUITY requires that the property be sold and\r\nthe surplus over the amount of the mortgage returned to the owner.\r\nThe LAW will grant damages for any injury inflicted; EQUITY will,\r\nby an injunction, forbid a repetition of the injury.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF JUDGES\r\n\r\nThe judges of the state courts were originally appointed by the\r\ngovernors, or by the legislatures. With the movement toward more\r\ndemocratic forms of government, the states began to introduce\r\nprovisions in their constitutions for the election of judges by\r\nthe people, and they are now so chosen in most states, though in a\r\nnumber they are appointed by the governor, and in a few by the\r\nlegislature. It is highly important that judges should be\r\ncontrolled in their decisions solely by the desire to render\r\njustice, and that they should be removed as far as possible from\r\npartisan influences. Popular election of judges is most prevalent\r\nbecause it seems to give to the people the most direct control\r\nover their courts. On the other hand, it is opposed by many\r\nbecause it makes possible the election of incompetent judges, and\r\nbecause it does not necessarily remove the matter from partisan\r\ninfluences. In three states (California, Oregon and Arizona) the\r\njudges are subject to recall by the people.\r\n\r\nThe terms during which judges hold office also vary greatly among\r\nthe states. In three states they hold office for life\r\n(Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire). In the other\r\nstates their terms vary from two to twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the opinion of most students that the state courts\r\nwould be improved if their judges were appointed by the chief\r\nexecutive and should hold office for life, or during good\r\nbehavior, as is the case in the federal courts.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on:\r\n\r\nCivil law and criminal law.\r\n\r\nWhat makes an act a \"crime.\"\r\n\r\nDifference between a \"crime\" and a \"misdemeanor.\"\r\n\r\nJustices' courts in your community.\r\n\r\nProcedure in a justice's court.\r\n\r\nThe organization of your county court.\r\n\r\nWho is your county (or district) judge.\r\n\r\nProcedure in your county court, and how it differs from that in\r\nthe justice's court.\r\n\r\nOrganization and work of the grand jury.\r\n\r\nHow a trial jury is selected.\r\n\r\nThe citizen's duty to serve on the jury.\r\n\r\nRights of an accused person.\r\n\r\nMeaning of \"bail,\" \"indictment,\" \"due process of law,\" \"counsel\r\nfor defense,\" \"subpoena,\" \"true bill.\"\r\n\r\nCircumstances under which an appeal may be made.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court of your state.\r\n\r\nThe work of a juvenile court.\r\n\r\nREADINGS\r\n\r\nState Constitution.\r\n\r\nReports of the several departments of the state government.\r\n\r\nIn LESSONS IN COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE: Series B: Lesson 18,\r\nHow state laws are made and enforced.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Administrative Code of the State of Illinois, compiled\r\nby Louis L.

They had revolted to\r\nescape from an autocratic government, and they sought to avoid\r\nsetting up another in its place. Since it had been the king whom\r\nthey distrusted most, they endeavored to get along without any\r\nexecutive head at all. Their new government consisted solely of a\r\nCongress of delegates from the thirteen states.\r\n\r\nTHE CRITICAL PERIOD\r\n\r\nThis form of government was continued for several years after the\r\nRevolution under a constitution known as the Articles of\r\nConfederation. It was, however, unsuccessful in securing anything\r\nlike real national cooperation. The Congress had no power to levy\r\nand collect taxes, it had little power to make laws, and it was\r\nwithout means to execute the laws that it did make. The real\r\ngoverning power during this period was with the several states.\r\nThe result was a period of unutterable confusion which has been\r\ncalled \"the critical period of American history.\" The question at\r\nstake was whether a number of self-governing state communities\r\nwith a multitude of apparently conflicting interests could really\r\nbecome a nation.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nDuring the war Benjamin Franklin had said, \"We must all hang\r\ntogether or we shall all hang separately.\" The states had \"hung\r\ntogether\" sufficiently to win the war; but the wise men of the\r\ntime now saw the need for a government so organized and with such\r\npowers as to secure effective cooperation among all the states and\r\nall the people at all times for the welfare of the entire Union,\r\nwhile leaving each state free to manage its own local affairs.\r\nTherefore a convention of delegates from all the states was called\r\ntogether at Philadelphia in 1787 to revise the Articles of\r\nConfederation. The result was our present Constitution under which\r\nour present national government went into effect in 1789.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report:\r\n\r\nThe nature and causes of the confusion during \"the critical\r\nperiod\" of American history.\r\n\r\nThe leading men of the Constitutional Convention.\r\n\r\nHow the states ratified the Constitution.\r\n\r\nWhich of the original thirteen states did not ratify the\r\nConstitution until after it had gone into effect.\r\n\r\nThe number of states required to ratify before the Constitution\r\nwent into effect (Constitution, Art. VII).\r\n\r\nPOPULAR CONTROL THROUGH THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\"We, the people of the United States\" \"ordained and established\"\r\nthe Constitution (see the Preamble). It was also \"ordained\" in the\r\nConstitution (Art. V) that it could be amended only by methods\r\ndesigned to give the people control over the matter--greater\r\ncontrol than they have over ordinary lawmaking. A great many\r\namendments have been proposed in the course of time, but only\r\neighteen have so far been adopted,[Footnote: A nineteenth\r\namendment is at this writing before the states for ratification--\r\nthe woman suffrage amendment.] ten of these having been adopted in\r\nthe very beginning as a condition on which the states would accept\r\nthe Constitution at all. None of these amendments changed the form\r\nof our government except with respect to the methods of electing\r\nthe President and United States senators (Amendments XII and\r\nXVII).\r\n\r\nExplain the two methods of proposing, and the two methods of\r\nratifying, amendments (Constitution, Art. VII).\r\n\r\nHas there ever been a national constitutional convention called by\r\nthe states?\r\n\r\nWhich of the two methods of ratifying was used in the case of the\r\nlast amendment adopted? [Footnote: Ohio by a referendum in 1919\r\nsubmitted the eighteenth amendment to the people of the state for\r\ntheir vote, after it had been ratified by the legislature. This\r\nwas the first time in our history that an amendment to the\r\nConstitution was submitted to popular vote for ratification.]\r\n\r\nDid your state vote to ratify or to reject the last amendment?\r\n\r\nIf any amendment is now before the states for ratification, watch\r\nthe newspapers for the action of the various states.\r\n\r\nOUR GOVERNMENT A GROWING THING\r\n\r\nThe Constitution adopted in 1787 has met the needs of our growing\r\nnation in a most remarkable way. It would be a mistake, however,\r\nto think that it has always met new conditions perfectly, or that\r\nwe are governed to-day exactly as was intended by the framers of\r\nthe Constitution. Although few amendments have been made,\r\nINTERPRETATIONS have been placed on the Constitution that were\r\nprobably unthought of by the framers or by the people who ratified\r\nit; and PRACTICES have grown up in our government that have made\r\nit quite a different government from that which was anticipated.\r\nOur government is a GROWING thing, and one of the chief merits of\r\nour Constitution is the fact that it speaks in such general terms\r\nthat it has been possible, under it, to adapt our government to\r\nnew and unexpected conditions. In this respect it differs from the\r\ndetailed state constitutions.\r\n\r\nDEFECTS INEVITABLE\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, conditions have arisen with the growth of our\r\nnation that our Constitution has not enabled us to meet with the\r\ngreatest success, and that we have not yet met by amendment. In\r\nsome cases we have tried to get around the difficulties by devices\r\nnot provided for in the Constitution, sometimes with unfortunate\r\nresults. But a recognition of defects in our government should not\r\ncause us to lose respect for the Constitution. They are due not to\r\npositive blunders on the part of the framers, but to the mere\r\nabsence of provision for conditions that did not exist when the\r\nConstitution was framed and that could not be foreseen by the\r\nwisest men of that time. The wise course for all good citizens is\r\nto seek to understand clearly wherein our government fails to meet\r\nour needs, if it does fail, and then to seek to correct the\r\ndifficulty, under the existing terms of the Constitution if\r\npossible, or by amendment of the Constitution if that becomes\r\nclearly necessary. Amendment of the Constitution was purposely\r\nmade difficult, and this was doubtless wise, for it tends to\r\nprevent changes without full consideration of their needs and\r\nprobable effects. Radical changes in our form of government and in\r\nour established laws are always fraught with danger. Because of\r\nthe extreme complexity of community life a change effected at one\r\npoint to meet a particular evil may have consequences of the most\r\nfar-reaching kind and in the most unexpected directions. A change\r\nthat corrects one evil may produce conditions resulting in evils\r\neven worse than the first. Changes are necessary at times, but\r\nthey should be made only after the most careful consideration by\r\nmen of the widest possible experience.\r\n\r\nTHE BILL OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\nOne thing that stood out clearly after the Revolution was the fear\r\nof a strong national government. Some of the states refused to\r\nratify the Constitution unless amendments were added at once\r\nguaranteeing the liberties of the people. The first ten\r\namendments, known as the \"bill of rights,\" were the result. To\r\nmake sure that no important rights were left unguarded, the ninth\r\namendment provides that \"the enumeration in the Constitution of\r\ncertain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others\r\nretained by the people.\"\r\n\r\nRead the first ten amendments and discuss the meaning of each.\r\n\r\nA GOVERNMENT OF DELEGATED POWERS\r\n\r\nIt was clearly expected that most of the governing powers to which\r\nthe people were subject should be exercised by the states, and not\r\nby the national government. The national government was to\r\nexercise no powers except such as were DELEGATED to it in the\r\nConstitution. These powers are important ones, but few in number,\r\nand are listed in section 8 of Article I. In order to make this\r\nlimitation of powers perfectly clear, the tenth amendment declares\r\nthat \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the\r\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to\r\nthe states respectively or to the people.\" Certain powers were\r\nalso expressly denied to the national government in section 9 of\r\nArticle I.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the meaning of each clause in Article I, section 8.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the meaning of each clause in Article I, section 9.\r\n\r\nTHE SCOPE OF NATIONAL POWERS\r\n\r\nThe powers of the national government relate to interstate and\r\nforeign affairs, or to matters that the several states could not\r\nwell regulate without confusion or injustice. For example, it was\r\nchiefly the confusion in matters pertaining to trade in the period\r\nfollowing the Revolution that made the new government necessary.\r\nTherefore power was given to it \"to regulate commerce with foreign\r\nnations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\"\r\nSo, also, it was given power \"to coin money, regulate the value\r\nthereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and\r\nmeasures,\" for varying systems of coinage and of weights and\r\nmeasures would be inconvenient. For similar reasons it was\r\nempowered \"to establish post-offices and post-roads,\" \"to\r\nestablish an uniform rule of naturalization\" for immigrants, and\r\n\"to promote the progress of science and useful arts\" by giving\r\ncopyrights and patents to authors and inventors. The states, on\r\nthe other hand, were expressly forbidden to exercise any control\r\nover some such matters of national and international concern in\r\nsection 10 of Article I.\r\n\r\nRead section 10, Art I, and discuss the reasons why the powers\r\nthere mentioned should have been denied to the states.\r\n\r\nTHE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES\r\n\r\nNot only did the framers of the Constitution carefully limit the\r\npowers that the national government might exercise, but they also\r\nintroduced into the organization of the government various devices\r\nto control it and to prevent any of its parts from assuming too\r\nmuch power. The most important of these is the system of CHECKS\r\nAND BALANCES. In our national government, as in the state\r\ngovernments, the legislative, executive, and judicial powers are\r\nSEPARATED. In early times in England, the king could make any laws\r\nhe wished, he could enforce them as he pleased, and he controlled\r\nthe courts of justice. In our government the legislature, composed\r\nof representatives of the people, makes the laws; the executive\r\nbranch of government sees to their enforcement; and the courts,\r\nwhich are responsible neither to the legislature nor to the\r\nexecutive, interpret the laws and administer justice in accordance\r\nwith the laws. This separation of powers is to prevent any one\r\nperson or group of persons from exercising too much power, as the\r\nking did, and is a safeguard to the liberty of the people. But the\r\nseparation of powers IS NOT COMPLETE. Each branch of government\r\nhas A LIMITED CONTROL over the others. This constitutes THE SYSTEM\r\nOF CHECKS AND BALANCES, which still further protects the people's\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nWhile the President cannot make the laws, he is given a check upon\r\nthe lawmaking power of Congress by his veto power. On the other\r\nhand, he cannot, by an excessive use of his veto power, destroy\r\nthe lawmaking power of Congress, because Congress may pass laws\r\nover the President's veto by means of a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nThe President cannot make a treaty, nor appoint men to office,\r\nwithout the consent of the senate; neither can he exercise his\r\nexecutive powers until Congress votes him the necessary money.\r\n\r\nIf Congress passes a law that is contrary to the Constitution the\r\ncourts may declare the law void, and the executive cannot enforce\r\nit. The courts, on the other hand, are in a measure under the\r\ncontrol of both Congress and the President, for Congress may\r\ncreate and destroy courts (except those created by the\r\nConstitution), and the President, with the consent of the senate,\r\nappoints the judges.\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF CHECKS AND BALANCES\r\n\r\nThe \"checks and balances\" in the organization of our government\r\nhave been very effective in accomplishing the purpose for which\r\nthey were intended, namely, to protect the liberties of the people\r\nagainst despotic government. But they have also, at times, been an\r\nobstacle to team work and to effective service. It sometimes\r\nhappens, for example, that the President represents one political\r\nparty, while the majority of one or both houses of Congress are of\r\nthe opposing party. The two branches of government may then enter\r\ninto a struggle on partisan grounds, each trying to defeat the\r\nprogram of the other. Such a situation was probably unforeseen by\r\nthe framers of the Constitution, although it again reminds us of\r\nWashington's warning with regard to the dangers of the party\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPLIED POWERS OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nWith the growth of our nation, the national government has come to\r\nperform a vast amount of service, as we have seen in earlier\r\nchapters, and to regulate the lives of the people in a multitude\r\nof ways little dreamed of by the makers of the Constitution. This\r\nhas been possible because of the principle of IMPLIED POWERS in\r\nthe Constitution. This means that some of the powers expressly\r\ngranted in the Constitution have been broadly interpreted to IMPLY\r\npowers not expressly stated. There are certain clauses in the\r\nConstitution that especially lend themselves to such broad\r\ninterpretation. For example, after the enumeration of the powers\r\nwhich Congress may exercise, in section 8 of Article I, clause 18\r\nof that section gives Congress power \"to make all laws which shall\r\nbe necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing\r\npowers ...\" Another clause whose liberal interpretation has been\r\nresponsible for much of the service performed by the national\r\ngovernment is that giving it the power to regulate interstate\r\ncommerce (Art. I, sec. 8, clause 3).\r\n\r\nIn the early days of our government the Federalist party, under\r\nthe leadership of Alexander Hamilton, proposed the creation of a\r\nNATIONAL BANK. The Republican party under Jefferson opposed this\r\nbecause the Constitution did not expressly provide for it, and\r\nbecause it was feared that it would give the national government\r\ntoo much power. But the \"broad constructionists\" argued that a\r\nnational bank was a \"necessary and proper\" means to enable the\r\nnational government \"to borrow money on the credit of the United\r\nStates\" and to exercise other financial powers expressly granted\r\nin the Constitution. The supreme court of the United States\r\nsupported the latter view, and the national bank became a fact.\r\n\r\nThe building of roads and other internal improvements by the\r\nnational government have always been opposed by the \"strict\r\nconstructionists,\" except where roads were clearly \"post-roads\"\r\n(Article 1, section.8, clause 7). But the \"broad constructionists\"\r\nargued that roads were \"necessary and proper\" to provide \"for the\r\ncommon defense,\" and also as a means \"to regulate commerce among\r\nthe several states.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the work that the national government has done for the\r\npromotion of the public health, such as the passage and\r\nenforcement of the \"pure food and drugs act,\" the inspection of\r\nlivestock and of slaughterhouses, and the attempt to regulate\r\nchild labor, has been done under the authority of the clause\r\ngiving Congress power to regulate interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nEXPANSION OF POWERS BY JUDICIAL DECISION\r\n\r\nIt has been the duty of the Supreme Court of the United States to\r\ndecide finally whether much of the new service undertaken by the\r\nnational government is in accordance with the Constitution or not,\r\nand this court has been responsible for most of the expansion of\r\nthe service rendered, because of its liberal interpretation of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nWhy should the power to regulate interstate commerce also give\r\nCongress the power to require the inspection of cattle in your\r\nneighborhood? or to forbid the use of harmful substances in patent\r\nmedicines? or to forbid the employment in factories of children?\r\n\r\nFind out what you can about the influence of John Marshall, Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court, in extending the powers of the\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE CENTRALIZED AND CONTROLLED\r\n\r\nThe Constitution vests the executive power in the President of the\r\nUnited States (Art. II, sec. I), and he alone is responsible to\r\nthe people for the execution of the laws. The people are protected\r\nagainst abuse of this power in the hands of one man by various\r\nconstitutional provisions. The President's term of office is\r\nlimited to four years, though he may be reelected. In case of\r\nimproper conduct in office, he may be removed by IMPEACHMENT. The\r\nimpeachment charges must be brought against him by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and the Senate, presided over by the Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court, must act as a court to try the case.\r\nMoreover, even the President must act according to law, and in so\r\nfar as his duties are not prescribed by the Constitution they are\r\nprescribed by Congress. Congress must also create the machinery by\r\nwhich the President executes the laws, and it must appropriate the\r\nnecessary money. The Senate exercises a further control over the\r\nPresident in that it must approve all appointments and all\r\ntreaties made by him.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF ELECTING THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nThe method of electing the President provided in the Constitution\r\nwas intended to insure a wise choice, and also shows a lack of\r\ncomplete confidence in the people on the part of the framers of\r\nthe Constitution. He was to be elected by a body of ELECTORS,\r\nchosen by the several states \"in such manner as the legislatures\r\nthereof may direct,\" the number of electors from each state to\r\nequal the whole number of senators and representatives from that\r\nstate (Art. II, sec. 2). These electors were originally chosen by\r\nthe legislatures of the states, but are now elected by the people.\r\nWhen voters \"vote for the President\" every four years, they in\r\nreality only vote for these electors who, in turn, cast their\r\nvotes for the President.\r\n\r\nDEPARTURE FROM THE INTENTION OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nIn the method of electing the President we find one of the points\r\nwhere the intention of the framers of the Constitution has clearly\r\nbeen thwarted. It was obviously the intention that the electors\r\nchosen by the states should use their own discretion in the choice\r\nof the President. But in practice to-day, the entire body of\r\nelectors from each state always represents the victorious\r\npolitical party, and casts its vote invariably for the\r\npresidential candidate already nominated by the party machinery.\r\nWe still elect the electors, and the electors go through the form\r\nof electing the President; but their part in the procedure is now\r\nentirely useless.\r\n\r\nTHE VICE-PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President of the United States is elected at the same\r\ntime and by the same method as the President. But he has no\r\nexecutive duties whatever so long as the President is capable of\r\nperforming his duties. In order that he might have something to\r\ndo, he was made presiding officer of the Senate, but even there he\r\nhas no vote.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report:\r\n\r\nThe qualifications necessary to hold the office of President\r\n(Const., Art.

II, sec. 2).\r\n\r\nA President who was impeached.\r\n\r\nWhy no President has been elected for a third term.\r\n\r\nAdvantages and disadvantages of a longer term for the President.\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF THE NATIONAL SERVICE ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe President is at the head of a stupendous service organization\r\nwhich was not ready-made by the Constitution, but which has been\r\ngradually created by acts of Congress under its express and\r\nimplied powers. The Constitution did not even create the great\r\nadministrative departments through which the President works,\r\nalthough it implied that such departments should be created: \"The\r\nPresident ... may require the opinion, in writing, of the\r\nprincipal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any\r\nsubject relating to the duties of their respective offices\" (Art.\r\nII, sec. 2, cl. i). The heads of these departments are appointed\r\nby the President, are responsible to him, and may be removed by\r\nhim. Together they constitute the President's CABINET, meeting\r\nwith him frequently to discuss the affairs of their departments\r\nand matters of public policy.\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS\r\n\r\nFive of these administrative departments were created during\r\nWashington's administration. These five have grown to cover a\r\nmultitude of activities that were not at first contemplated, and\r\nfive other great departments have since been created.\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF STATE maintains relations between the United\r\nStates and foreign powers. The Secretary of State, acting for the\r\nPresident, negotiates treaties with foreign governments, and is in\r\nconstant communication with the ambassadors, ministers, consuls,\r\nand other representatives of our government in foreign countries,\r\nand with similar representatives of foreign governments in this\r\ncountry. This department is the medium of communication between\r\nthe President and the governors of the several states. The\r\nSecretary of State has in his keeping the treaties and laws of the\r\nUnited States, and also the Great Seal of the United States, which\r\nhe affixes to proclamations, commissions, and other official\r\npapers. Through him the rights of American citizens in foreign\r\ncountries are looked after. He is first in rank among the members\r\nof the cabinet, and by law would succeed to the Presidency in case\r\nof the death or disability of both the President and the Vice-\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY has at its head the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, who is the financial manager of the national\r\ngovernment. He prepares plans for, and superintends the collection\r\nof, the public revenues; determines the manner of keeping the\r\npublic accounts; directs the coinage and printing of money. He\r\nalso controls the construction and maintenance of public\r\nbuildings, and administers the public health service and the life-\r\nsaving service.\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF WAR is directed by the Secretary of War, who,\r\nunder the President, controls the military establishment and\r\nsuperintends the national defense. He also administers river and\r\nharbor improvements, the prevention of obstruction to navigation,\r\nand the building of bridges over navigable rivers when authorized\r\nby Congress. He also has direction of the Bureau of Insular\r\nAffairs, which supervises the government of Porto Rico and the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE has at its head the Attorney General,\r\nwho is the chief law officer of the government, and represents it\r\nin all matters of a legal nature. He is the legal adviser of the\r\nPresident and of the several executive departments, and supervises\r\nall United States attorneys and marshals in the judicial districts\r\ninto which the country is divided.\r\n\r\nThe POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT is administered by the Postmaster\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, under the Secretary of the Navy, has\r\ncharge of the \"construction, manning, equipment, and employment of\r\nvessels of war.\"\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR was created to relieve the\r\nDepartment of State of work relating to internal affairs, and now\r\nembraces a wide variety of duties. At its head is the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior. Through many bureaus and divisions it administers\r\nthe public lands, the national parks, the giving of patents for\r\ninventions, the pensioning of soldiers, Indian affairs, education,\r\nthe reclamation service, the geological survey, the improvement of\r\nmining methods for the safety of miners, certain matters\r\npertaining to the territories of the United States, and certain\r\ninstitutions in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE is directed by the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture. Its work is described in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, under the Secretary of Commerce,\r\npromotes the commercial interests of the country in many ways. It\r\nincludes in its organization the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic\r\nCommerce, the Bureau of Corporations, the Census Bureau, the\r\nBureau of Lighthouses, the Bureau of Navigation, the Bureau of\r\nFisheries, and the Bureau of Standards.\r\n\r\nThe DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, under the Secretary of Labor, has for its\r\npurpose \"fostering, promoting, and developing the welfare of the\r\nwage earners of the United States, improving their working\r\nconditions, and advancing their opportunities for profitable\r\nemployment.\" Among its important bureaus are those of Immigration\r\nand of Naturalization, and the Children's Bureau, which\r\ninvestigates and reports upon \"all matters pertaining to the\r\nwelfare of children and child life among all classes of our\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nOTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES\r\n\r\nIn addition to these great administrative departments with their\r\nnumerous bureaus and subdivisions, there are various boards,\r\ncommissions and establishments that are independent of the\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important of these are the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, the Civil Service Commission (see below), the Federal\r\nReserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States\r\nTariff Commission, the Board of Mediation and Conciliation, the\r\nUnited States Bureau of Efficiency, the Federal Board of\r\nVocational Education, the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nOf another kind are the Library of Congress which includes the\r\nCopyright Office; the Government Printing Office; the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, including the National Museum and the National\r\nZoological Park.\r\n\r\nThere are many others. During the recent war a great variety of\r\nnew administrative commissions and boards were created for the\r\nemergency. Most of these have been, or are to be, discontinued,\r\nthough some of them may survive. Such were the Council of National\r\nDefense, the Committee on Public Information, the Food\r\nAdministration, the Fuel Administration, the United States\r\nShipping Board, the War Trade Board, the Director General of\r\nRailroads.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe detailed work of this vast service organization is carried on\r\nby about 400,000 employees (not counting the army and the navy).\r\nThese constitute the CIVIL SERVICE. The quality of service depends\r\nlargely upon the efficiency of these employees. The task of\r\nfilling all these places is a large one. In Andrew Jackson's\r\nadministration (1829-1837) the \"spoils system\" was introduced,\r\nwhich means that government positions were treated by the\r\nvictorious party as \"the spoils of victory,\" to be given to\r\nmembers of the victorious party as rewards for party service\r\nwithout much regard to fitness for the work to be done. Whenever\r\nthe administration passed from one party to another, the army of\r\ncivil service employees was displaced by another of new employees.\r\nNot only did this result in inefficient service, but the time of\r\nthe President and the heads of the departments was largely\r\nconsumed in considering the claims of those seeking appointment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, since appointments could be made only \"with the advice\r\nand consent\" of the Senate, senators were besieged by applicants\r\nfor positions and their friends. The President, overwhelmed by the\r\nmultitude of appointments to be made, came to rely almost wholly\r\nupon the advice of the senators, and even of members of the House\r\nof Representatives, for appointments in their states and\r\ndistricts. Thus, in effect, appointments were made by members of\r\nCongress rather than by the President who was really responsible.\r\nNo system could have been devised more wasteful of the time of the\r\nexecutive and legislative branches of the government, or more\r\nconducive to inefficiency.\r\n\r\nREFORM OF THE CIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe spoils system became a great offense to the nation, but it was\r\nnot until President Garfield was murdered by a disappointed office\r\nseeker that Congress, in 1883, passed a law for the reform of the\r\ncivil service. Candidates for many positions in the civil service\r\nwere required to pass an examination designed to prove their\r\nfitness for the work to be done, and a CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION\r\nwas created to administer the law and to conduct the examinations,\r\nwhich are held at stated intervals in different parts of the\r\ncountry. Those appointed under this system cannot be removed\r\nexcept for cause. Even at the present time, however, only about\r\nhalf of the civil service is subject to this MERIT SYSTEM. From\r\nthe above description of the work of the several executive\r\ndepartments select topics for special investigation and report;\r\nsuch as:\r\n\r\nThe work of United States Consuls. Coining money; the United\r\nStates Bureau of Engraving.\r\n\r\nThe life-saving service of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe United States Army in war and peace.\r\n\r\nThe United States Army as an organization to save life, especially\r\nin its work of sanitation in territories occupied.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the United States Department of Justice in your\r\ncommunity, and examples of their work.\r\n\r\nBuilding a battleship. Training for the navy.\r\n\r\nExploits of the navy in war. The work of the navy in time of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe work of the patent office; of the bureau of Indian affairs; of\r\nthe geological survey; of the bureau of mines.\r\n\r\nTaking the United States census.\r\n\r\nThe work of the bureau of fisheries.\r\n\r\nMarvels of the bureau of standards.\r\n\r\nThe immigration bureau.\r\n\r\nWork of the children's bureau.\r\n\r\nHow an immigrant is naturalized.\r\n\r\nThe Government Printing Office.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Library.\r\n\r\nThe spoils system in Andrew Jackson's administration.\r\n\r\nHow would you go about it to take an examination for the civil\r\nservice?\r\n\r\nIs there any reason why a mail carrier or a clerk in a government\r\noffice should be a Republican or a Democrat?\r\n\r\nWhat employees of the United States civil service are there in\r\nyour community?\r\n\r\nRESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\nEfficient government requires strong, clearly recognized\r\nleadership. Democratic government requires that its leadership\r\nshall be responsive to the needs of the people and under their\r\ncontrol. The problem of how to secure strong leadership and\r\ncontrolled leadership at one and the same time is a difficult one.\r\nSo far as the executive branch of government alone is concerned,\r\nthe framers of the Constitution secured strength by concentrating\r\nfull responsibility in the President. But did they expect him to\r\nbe their leader in the government as a whole; that is, in\r\nformulating the policies of government that should serve as the\r\nbasis for legislation? We are in the habit of thinking of him as\r\nour national leader, but was he made so in fact?\r\n\r\nLEADERSHIP OF THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nIn fact, the framers of the Constitution were apparently more\r\nconcerned about maintaining control over the President than about\r\nclearly making him the nation's leader. About the only indication\r\nthe Constitution contains that he was to be such a leader is the\r\nstatement that he \"shall from time to time give to the Congress\r\ninformation of the state of the Union, and recommend to their\r\nconsideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and\r\nexpedient\" (Art. II, sec.3). He does submit recommendations to\r\nCongress at the opening of each of its terms and often at other\r\ntimes. If the President and the majority in Congress are of the\r\nsame political party, Congress is pretty likely to follow the\r\nPresident's lead; or, if the President has a commanding\r\npersonality and is clearly popular with the people, he may force\r\nmeasures through even an unwilling Congress. But if differences\r\narise between the President and Congress, especially when one or\r\nboth houses of Congress are of the opposite party from the\r\nPresident, his recommendations may be entirely ignored. By our\r\nsystem of \"checks and balances\" the President is \"controlled,\" but\r\nhe ceases to be a leader when he does not have the \"following\" of\r\nCongress, or of the majority of the people.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson began his second administration with a majority\r\nin both houses of Congress of his political party, and apparently\r\nin popular favor. He was clearly accepted as leader and\r\npractically all of his proposed measures were favorably acted upon\r\nby Congress. In the middle of this administration a congressional\r\nelection occurred which resulted in a majority in both houses of\r\nthe opposing party. This result might be considered as a popular\r\nvote against the leadership of the President, and his opponents\r\ndid consider it so. It cannot be absolutely certain that this was\r\nintended, for the people were not voting directly on this\r\nquestion. Whether this was true or not, Congress refused to follow\r\nhis leadership in many important questions, including the treaty\r\nof peace with Germany.\r\n\r\nCONTROL OF LEADERSHIP IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nIt will be helpful to compare this situation with the method by\r\nwhich England has worked out the problem of leadership and control\r\nof leadership.\r\n\r\nThe real executive head in the English government is the prime\r\nminister. The king appoints the prime minister, but he always\r\nchooses for the position THE RECOGNIZED LEADER OF THE POLITICAL\r\nPARTY THAT IS IN THE MAJORITY in the House of Commons (which\r\ncorresponds to our House of Representatives).\r\n\r\nThe prime minister having been appointed, he then selects the\r\nother members of his cabinet, who are to be the heads of the\r\nexecutive departments, and WHO ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister and the other members of the cabinet have seats\r\nin the House of Commons, contrary to the practice in our country.\r\nTHEY ALSO TAKE THE LEAD IN LEGISLATION, for most of the important\r\nbills considered in the House of Commons are planned and\r\nintroduced by the cabinet. So the executive and legislative\r\nbranches of the English government are not separated as in our\r\ncountry. The same group of men manage the service organization and\r\nlead in planning the legislation that makes the service possible.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, however, that the cabinet introduces a\r\nmeasure which, after discussion, a majority of the House of\r\nCommons rejects. This means that on this question the cabinet no\r\nlonger represents the majority in the House. Then one of two\r\nthings happens. EITHER THE CABINET RESIGNS in a body to make way\r\nfor a new cabinet that does represent the majority; OR THE PRIME\r\nMINISTER ASKS FOR A GENERAL ELECTION FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS. If at this election a majority is again returned that is\r\nopposed to the cabinet, it means that the cabinet no longer leads\r\nthe people, and it resigns. If a majority is returned in support\r\nof the cabinet, it means that the old House was no longer\r\nrepresentative of the people, and the old cabinet retains its\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nThis system gives the English people MORE DIRECT CONTROL over\r\ntheir government than we have in our country; it is very much like\r\nthe method of RECALL that is used in some of our states. At the\r\nsame time, it assures a real executive leadership WITHIN THE\r\nGOVERNMENT, a leadership that is both responsive and responsible\r\nto the people.\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\nNot only does our Constitution fail to provide clearly for\r\nresponsible leadership within the government, but our system of\r\n\"checks and balances,\" our party system of government, and the\r\norganization and rules of Congress, all taken together, have\r\ntended to confuse our leadership, and to impose upon us an\r\nirresponsible leadership, OUTSIDE of the government as outlined by\r\nthe Constitution. To understand this it will first be necessary to\r\nexamine the organization of Congress.\r\n\r\nTHE CONGRESS\r\n\r\nCongress, like the state legislatures, consists of two chambers,\r\nthe House of Representatives and the Senate; this being another\r\ninstance of \"checks and balances.\"\r\n\r\nThe creation of two chambers in the Congress made possible a\r\nsatisfactory settlement of a dispute in the Constitutional\r\nConvention with regard to the basis of representation. The larger\r\nstates wanted representation proportional to their population,\r\nwhile the smaller states, insisted upon EQUAL representation for\r\nall the states. It was settled that there should be equal\r\nrepresentation in the Senate, and proportional representation in\r\nthe House of Representatives. This is one of a series of\r\ncompromises that had to be made between the two parties in the\r\nconvention. In fact, the Constitution is a series of compromises\r\nfrom beginning to end. Only thirty-nine of the fifty-five\r\ndelegates in the convention signed the Constitution, and it is\r\nprobable that no one even of the thirty-nine was wholly pleased\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nThe number of representatives in the first Congress from each\r\nstate was fixed in the Constitution, and provision made for a\r\ncensus in 1790 and every ten years thereafter, on the basis of\r\nwhich a reapportionment should be made. At present there are 435\r\nmembers of the House, one for about every 212,000 of the\r\npopulation. They are elected by direct vote of the people, one\r\nfrom each of the CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS into which each state is\r\ndivided, and for a term of two years.\r\n\r\nTHE SENATE\r\n\r\nThere are two senators from each state. The Constitution provided\r\nthat they were to be elected by the state legislatures, another\r\nevidence of distrust of the people. In 1913, the seventeenth\r\namendment to the Constitution was enacted, providing for the\r\nelection of senators by popular vote, showing the growing spirit\r\nof democracy and the distrust of the state legislatures. Senators\r\nare elected for six years, but the term of only one third of them\r\nexpires at the same time, so that at least two thirds of the\r\nSenate have always had at least two years' experience. No citizen\r\nmay become a senator until he is thirty years of age, while one\r\nmay become a member of the lower house at twenty-five.\r\n\r\nEXCLUSIVE POWERS OF EACH HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives has one important power not possessed\r\nby the Senate: it alone can originate bills for raising revenue.\r\nThis is because the representatives were supposed to be more\r\ndirectly representative of the people than the senators. However,\r\nthe Senate may amend such bills, and often succeeds in forcing the\r\nHouse to accept such radical amendments as practically to destroy\r\nthe advantage possessed by the latter in its power to originate\r\nthe bills.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its lawmaking powers, the Senate was intended to be\r\nan advisory council to the President. Only with its \"advice and\r\nconsent\" may the President make appointments and treaties.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on the following:\r\n\r\nThe compromises of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1920.\r\n\r\nThe number of congressional districts in your state, and the\r\nnumber of the one you live in.\r\n\r\nThe names of your representative and senators.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for election to the House of Representatives\r\nand to the Senate (Art. I, secs. 2 and 3). Compare with the\r\nqualifications for election to the two houses of your legislature.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the Senate that make it more conservative\r\nthan the House of Representatives. The meaning of \"conservatism.\"\r\n\r\nWhy the Senate should be more conservative than the House.\r\n\r\nThe \"long\" and \"short\" sessions of Congress.\r\n\r\nHow vacancies in Congress are filled between elections.\r\n\r\nLegislation in which the representative from your district has\r\nbeen especially interested during the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn England a member of the House of Commons is not required to be\r\na resident of the district which he represents. Arguments for and\r\nagainst this plan.\r\n\r\nDebate the question: RESOLVED, that our Constitution should be\r\namended to provide for a \"responsible cabinet government\" as in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS\r\n\r\nThe presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States, while that of the House of Representatives is a\r\nSPEAKER elected by the House. The Vice-President has no vote in\r\nthe Senate except in case of a tie, when he may cast the deciding\r\nvote. The Speaker, on the other hand, has all the rights of any\r\nother member and has large powers by virtue of his position. He is\r\nalways elected by a strictly party vote, and therefore represents\r\nthe majority party in the House.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMITTEE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nAs in the state legislatures, and for the same reason, most of the\r\nwork of legislation in Congress is done by standing committees, of\r\nwhich there are about sixty in the House and about seventy-five in\r\nthe Senate. As in the state legislatures, these committees are\r\nchosen on party lines, the chairmen and the majority of the\r\nmembers always being of the majority party. The procedure by which\r\nlegislation is carried on in Congress is very much the same as\r\nthat in the state legislatures, and has the same advantages and\r\ndisadvantages. There is even greater necessity for the committee\r\norganization and for rules because of the vastly greater number of\r\nbills introduced. In a recent Congress more than 33,000 bills were\r\nintroduced in the House of Representatives alone. Whereas in the\r\nstate legislatures some of the rules of procedure are fixed by the\r\nstate constitutions, the rules of Congress are determined entirely\r\nby each house for itself. The committee on rules in each house,\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairmen of\r\nthe committees in both houses, may run things as they see fit.\r\nThat this is done there is plenty of evidence, such as the\r\nfollowing words of a member of Congress:\r\n\r\nYou send important questions to a committee, you put into the\r\nhands of a few men the power to bring in bills, and then they are\r\nbrought in with an ironclad rule, and rammed down the throats of\r\nmembers; and then those measures are sent out as being the\r\ndeliberate judgment of the Congress of the United States when no\r\ndeliberate judgment has been expressed by any man.\r\n\r\nDIFFUSED LEADERSHIP IN CONGRESS\r\n\r\nIt is this procedure in Congress that causes leadership to become\r\ndiffused, hidden, and often to pass outside of the government\r\naltogether into the hands of \"bosses\" and special \"interests.\"\r\nThere can be no well-conceived PLAN worked out by responsible\r\nleaders and approved by Congress as a whole. There may be \"plans,\"\r\nworked out by leaders in Congress, but they are likely to be plans\r\ndesigned to serve party ends rather than to promote a well-\r\nthought-out program of national development. Thousands of bills of\r\nthe greatest variety are introduced by individual members and\r\nhandled by different committees acting independently of one\r\nanother and often at cross purposes.\r\n\r\nRELATION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE AND LEGISTLATIVE BRANCHES\r\n\r\nThe legislative and executive branches of government are each\r\nextremely jealous of any encroachment upon its powers by the\r\nother. It is not always easy to decide just where the dividing\r\nline lies between the powers properly exercised by each. It is\r\nmaintained on the one hand that Congress is encroaching on the\r\nrightful domain of the executive; and at least it is true that\r\nwhile it denies the President responsible leadership in\r\ndetermining the policies of the government, it has failed to\r\nsubstitute any other responsible leadership, and has even made\r\nleadership obscure. On the other hand, it is maintained that the\r\nexecutive encroaches upon the powers of Congress. While this\r\nchapter was being written a member of the House of Representatives\r\nmade a speech in which he said:\r\n\r\nThis bill presents a fine specimen of bureaucratic legislation.\r\n[Footnote: \"Bureaucratic legislation\" here means lawmaking by\r\nbureaus in the executive branch of the government.] If the\r\nCongress ever intends, as it surely does, to regain the powers\r\ngranted it by the fathers, of which it is now temporarily deprived\r\nby bureaucratic encroachment, now is the time to start upon such a\r\ncampaign by defeating by a decisive majority the bill now offered\r\nfor your consideration ... Every time you weaken Congress by the\r\nestablishment of a bureau in which the authority of Congress is\r\nlessened, you lay one more stone in the erection of the temple of\r\nautocracy ... These bureaus are not only legislating by\r\nadministrative processes but are usurping the power and\r\nprerogatives of the people's courts ...\r\n\r\nTHE DUTY OF CONGRESS TO WATCH THE EXECUTIVE\r\n\r\nIt is the business of the people's representatives in the law-\r\nmaking branch of government not merely to make laws, but also to\r\nwatch and control the executive. The great English philosopher,\r\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806-1873), thus stated the purpose of the\r\nEnglish House of Commons:\r\n\r\nTo watch and control the government; [Footnote: \"Government\" here\r\nrefers to the executive branch.] to throw the light of publicity\r\non its acts; to compel a full explanation and justification of all\r\nof them which any one considers questionable; to censure them if\r\nfound condemnable; to be at once the nation's committee on\r\ngrievances; an arena in which not only the opinion of the nation,\r\nbut that of every section of it, and as far as possible, of every\r\neminent individual that it contains, can produce itself in full\r\nsight and challenge full discussion.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the English House of Commons has a way to control\r\nexecutive leadership without destroying it. Even if we desired to\r\ndo so, we could not adopt the English plan without changing our\r\nConstitution. But there are ways in which the same result could in\r\na measure be accomplished without such change. One of these is by\r\na well-organized BUDGET SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROPRIATIONS\r\n\r\nThe methods of making appropriations for the purposes of our\r\nnational government have been as unbusinesslike as in the states.\r\nCharges of extravagance and inefficiency have been made freely,\r\nthe blame being placed sometimes upon Congress and sometimes upon\r\nthe executive departments. Both are at fault; and the difficulty\r\nis that it is almost impossible to fix the responsibility\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nDUPLICATION AND CONFUSION IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH\r\n\r\nAlthough the national government, unlike the states, has a single-\r\nheaded executive, the executive departments are composed of a\r\nmultitude of bureaus and other subdivisions that are not well\r\norganized in their relations to one another. There is overlapping,\r\nduplication, and even conflict of work. The director of finance of\r\nthe War Department said that in the recent war,\r\n\r\nThe War Department entered this war without any fixed or carefully\r\ndigested and prepared financial system. There were at the\r\nbeginning of the war five ... bureaus each independent of the\r\nothers, each making its own contracts, doing its own purchasing,\r\ndoing its own accounting, with as many different methods as there\r\nwere bureaus. As a result they were competing with each other in a\r\nmarket where the supplies in many cases for which they were\r\ncompeting were restricted in amount ... There was no central\r\nauthority to prune, revise, or compare estimates submitted and to\r\ncoordinate expenditures, and that naturally resulted in\r\noverlappings and duplications, and some of them of a large amount.\r\n[Footnote: Testimony before Budget Committee, quoted by Will\r\nPayne, \"Your Budget,\" Saturday Evening Post, Jan. 3, 1920, p. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe responsibility is partly in the executive department; but it\r\nis also partly in Congress, for it creates bureaus, defines their\r\nduties, appropriates money for them. And in Congress the\r\nresponsibility is divided among various committees.\r\n\r\nOne committee or subcommittee has supervision of building the\r\nbarracks at a given army post while another committee or\r\nsubcommittee has supervision of building the hospital at the same\r\npost. One committee has jurisdiction of the guns, another\r\ncommittee has jurisdiction of the emplacement of the guns. All\r\ncommittees are jealous of their own prerogatives and sometimes\r\nmore or less jealous of other committees. [Footnote: Will Payne,\r\n\"Your Budget,\" SATURDAY EVENING POST, Jan. 3, 1920, p. 166.]\r\n\r\nAPPROPRIATIONS MADE MORE OR LESS BLINDLY\r\n\r\nEach year the executive departments submit to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury an estimate of the amount of money they think they will\r\nneed. The Secretary of the Treasury puts these estimates together\r\nwithout revision and without criticism and submits them to\r\nCongress, together with an estimate of the probable revenues\r\navailable. While there is a committee on appropriations in each\r\nhouse of Congress,\r\n\r\n... one class of appropriations after another has been taken away\r\nfrom this committee and intrusted to other committees until, as a\r\nresult, the work of preparing appropriations in the House of\r\nRepresentatives is broken up so that there are now no less than\r\nfourteen general appropriation bills prepared by seven different\r\ncommittees ... In the preparation of their bills the committee on\r\nappropriations and the other committees in charge of\r\nappropriations are really compelled to work more or less blindly.\r\nSometimes they hold extensive hearings endeavoring to get a\r\ncomplete grasp of the multitudinous detailed expenditures for\r\nwhich they must provide. But, of course, it is impossible for the\r\nseveral committees, in the time at their disposal, to give even\r\nminor matters the amount of attention demanded by sound public\r\neconomy. [Footnote: C. A. Beard, AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS,\r\npp. 366, 367.]\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF A BUDGET SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe first principles of a budget, according to students of\r\ngovernment, are that it should be prepared by the executive branch\r\nof the government, which is responsible for spending the money;\r\nthat it should be prepared by an agency responsible directly to\r\nthe President, and with authority to revise and adjust the\r\nestimates of the several departments in the light of the needs and\r\nresources of the government as a whole; and that it should be\r\nbased upon an accounting system that will show clearly how\r\nefficiently each department and minor subdivision is doing its\r\nwork. As this chapter is being written, a bill is before Congress\r\nwhich, if passed, will more or less completely accomplish these\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nTHE NEED FOR CENTRALIZING APPROPRIATIONS\r\n\r\nIt remains for Congress, however, to make the appropriations\r\nrequested in the budget, with such modifications as may be shown\r\nto be wise. It is generally accepted that appropriations cannot be\r\nwisely made under the present system, and that responsibility for\r\nthem must be centered in one committee in each house.\r\n\r\nThis change will necessitate a change in the rules which can only\r\nbe made by each house for itself. A resolution has been introduced\r\nin the House of Representatives recommending this change, but it\r\nhas not at this writing been acted upon.\r\n\r\nIn the English House of Commons, when the appropriation bill is\r\nintroduced, the House becomes in effect a court before which the\r\nprime minister and his cabinet are placed on trial to defend their\r\nbudget. The whole House is in session. The minority party, which\r\nconducts the opposition, employs counsel, and by its searching\r\ninquiries compels the cabinet to explain and defend the budget at\r\nevery point. By this procedure the public is informed as to the\r\nwork and program of the government, and the executive leaders held\r\nstrictly to account.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY OF THE CITIZEN\r\n\r\nA budget system, however good it may be, like all other\r\ngovernmental machinery is merely an organization for team work,\r\nand will do very little good unless the team work is forthcoming,\r\nnot only among the various branches and departments of government,\r\nbut also on the part of the citizens.\r\n\r\nIf there is a real budget it has got to be your budget. It will be\r\ngood, bad or indifferent finally just in proportion to your\r\ninterest in it and your expression of that interest at the polls\r\nand elsewhere. If there is a good budget system--not on paper, but\r\nin actual practice--you've got to make it. If, when a budget bill\r\nis finally enacted you say, \"Well, that job is done,\" and dismiss\r\nit from your mind there will be no lasting gain ... [Footnote:\r\nWill Payne, \"Your Budget,\" SATURDAY EVENING POST January 3, 1920,\r\np. 30.]\r\n\r\nEffective control over government can be exercised only by PUBLIC\r\nOPINION and PUBLIC INTEREST. We may have any kind of government we\r\nwant, if we only want it badly enough, and only when we want it\r\nbadly enough. The blame for inefficiency and wastefulness on the\r\npart of government at Washington, or at the state capital, or at\r\nthe county seat, rests largely with the people back home, who are\r\neither selfish or blind to the fact that the interests of the\r\nnation are larger than their own or those of their own little\r\ncommunity. The very people who talk most loudly about the\r\nextravagance of government, or about the burden of taxes, are\r\nlikely to be the ones who expect most from their congressmen for\r\npurely personal or local advantage. They are likely to judge their\r\nrepresentative's fitness for his position more by his ability to\r\nget funds from the public treasury for local gratification than by\r\nhis attitude toward great national questions.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and report on the following:\r\n\r\nThe present Speaker of the House of Representatives, and some of\r\nthe more important members.\r\n\r\nLeaders in the Senate at the present time.\r\n\r\nA list of some of the more important committees in each House of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe procedure by which a bill becomes a law, from the time when it\r\nis introduced to the time it goes into effect as a law of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBills introduced in Congress by the representative from your\r\ndistrict.

III, sec. I). The number of judges in the Supreme Court is\r\ndetermined by Congress, and they are appointed by the President\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate. At present the Supreme\r\nCourt consists of a chief justice and eight associate justices.\r\nIts sessions are held in the Capitol building at Washington.\r\nCongress has created circuit courts of appeals, of which there are\r\nnow nine, each \"circuit\" including several states; and district\r\ncourts, of which there is at least one in every state, and\r\nsometimes several. In addition to these there is a court of\r\ncustoms appeals and a court of claims, for special classes of\r\ncases. The courts of the District of Columbia are also United\r\nStates courts, inasmuch as the District is governed entirely by\r\nthe national government. The judges of all United States courts\r\nare appointed by the President and hold office for life.\r\n\r\nPOWERS OF THE FEDERAL COURTS\r\n\r\nThe powers of the federal courts are stated in Article III,\r\nsection 2, of the Constitution. In general, they have jurisdiction\r\nover cases of a national or interstate character. Most cases that\r\ncome in the first instance before the federal courts are tried in\r\nthe United States district courts, going to the higher courts only\r\non appeal; but there are certain classes of cases that go to the\r\nSupreme Court at once (Art. III, sec. 2, cl. 2). A case brought to\r\ntrial before a state court may be appealed to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States when the Constitution, the laws, or the treaties\r\nof the United States are involved, and its decision is final. The\r\nSupreme Court may declare a law passed by Congress or an act of\r\nthe President null and void if, in its opinion, such law or act is\r\ncontrary to the provisions of the Constitution. It has been\r\nquestioned whether the framers of the Constitution intended the\r\nSupreme Court to have this power, but it exercises the power on\r\nthe ground that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land to\r\nwhich even Congress and the President are subject, and that it is\r\nthe sacred duty of the courts to preserve it from violation. We\r\nhave noted the influence exercised by the Supreme Court in\r\nextending the activities of the United States government by its\r\nbroad interpretations of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nStudy the powers of the federal courts in Article III, sections 1\r\nand 2.\r\n\r\nWhat is treason?
