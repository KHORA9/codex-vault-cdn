One\r\nElector of Hanover named George had been succeeded by another Elector\r\nof Hanover named George, and George the First and George the Second,\r\nGeorge the father and George the son, resembled each other in being by\r\nnature German rather than English, and by inclination Electors of\r\nHanover rather than Kings of England.  Against each of them a Stuart\r\nprince had raised a standard and an army.  George the First had his\r\nJames Francis Edward, who called himself James the Third, and whom his\r\nopponents called the Pretender, by a translation which gave an\r\ninjurious signification to the French word \"pretendant.\"  George the\r\nSecond had his Charles Edward, the Young Pretender who a generation\r\nlater led an invading army well into England before he had to turn and\r\nfly for his life.  A very different condition of things awaited the\r\nsuccessor of George the Second.  George the Second's grandson was an\r\nEnglish prince and an Englishman.  He was born in England; his father\r\nwas born in England; his native tongue was the English tongue; and if\r\nhe was Elector of Hanover, that seemed an accident.\r\n\r\nThe title was as unimportant and trivial to the King of {2} England as\r\nhis title of King of France was unreal and theatrical.  The remnant of\r\nthe Jacobites could not with truth call the heir to the throne a\r\nforeigner, and they could not in reason hope to make such a\r\ndemonstration in arms against him as they had made against his\r\ngrandfather and his great-grandfather.  The young King came to a much\r\nsafer throne under much more favorable auspices than either of the two\r\nmonarchs, his kinsmen and his namesakes, who had gone before him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760--Accession of George the Third]\r\n\r\nThe young King heard the first formal news of his accession to the\r\nthrone from the lips of no less stately a personage than the Great\r\nCommoner himself--the foremost Englishman then alive.  George the\r\nThird, as he then actually was, had received at Kew Palace some\r\nmessages which told him that his grandfather was sinking fast, that he\r\nwas dying, that he was dead.  George resolved to start for London.  On\r\nhis way, and not far from Kew, he was met by a coach and six, which,\r\nfrom the blue and silver liveries, he knew to be that of Mr. Pitt.\r\nGeorge received the congratulations of his great minister--the great\r\nMinister whom, as it was soon to appear, he understood so little and\r\nesteemed so poorly.  Then Pitt, turning his horses' heads, followed his\r\nsovereign into London.  Never perhaps in English history was a young\r\nking welcomed on his accession by so great a minister.  Among the many\r\nauspicious conditions which surrounded the early days of George the\r\nThird's reign not the least auspicious was the presence of such a\r\nbulwark to the throne and to the realm.  For the name of Pitt was now\r\nfeared and honored in every civilized country in the world.  It had\r\nbecome synonymous with the triumphs and the greatness of England.  Pitt\r\nwas the greatest War Minister England had yet known.  He was the first\r\nEnglish statesman who illustrated in his own person the difference\r\nbetween a War Minister and a Minister of War.\r\n\r\nTruly this journey of the King and the Prime Minister from Kew to\r\nLondon was what George Meredith calls a \"supreme ironic procession,\r\nwith laughter of gods in the background.\"  The ignorant, unwise young\r\nKing led the {3} way, the greatest living statesman in England followed\r\nafter.  One can hardly imagine a procession more supremely ironic.\r\nAlmost all the whole range of human intellect was stretched out and\r\nexhausted by the living contrast between the King who went first and\r\nthe Minister who meekly went second.  Pitt had made for young George\r\nthe Third a great empire, which it was the work of George the Third not\r\nlong after to destroy, so far as its destruction could be compassed by\r\nthe stupidity of a man.  Pitt had made the name of England a power all\r\nover the civilized world.  Rome at her greatest, Spain at her greatest,\r\ncould hardly have surpassed the strength and the fame of England as\r\nPitt had re-made it.  George, from the very first, felt a sort of\r\ncoldness towards his superb Minister.  He had all the vague pervading\r\njealousy which dulness naturally shows to genius.  It was a displeasure\r\nto him from the first that Pitt should have made England so great,\r\nbecause the work was the inspiration of the subject and not of the\r\nsovereign.  No one can know for certain what thoughts were filling the\r\nmind of George as he rode to London that day in front of William Pitt.\r\nBut it may fairly be assumed that he was not particularly sorry for the\r\ndeath of his grandfather, and that he was pleasing his spirit with the\r\nidea that he would soon emancipate himself from Mr. Pitt.  \"Be a king,\r\nGeorge,\" his mother used to say to him.  The unsifted youth was\r\ndetermined, if he could, to be a king.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his accession George was in his twenty-third year.  He\r\nwas a decidedly personable young Prince.  He had the large regular\r\nfeatures of his race, the warm complexion of good health, and a\r\nvigorous constitution, keen attractive eyes, and a firm, full mouth.\r\nHe was tall and strongly made, and carried himself with a carriage that\r\nwas dignified or stiff according to the interpretation of those who\r\nobserved it.  Many of the courtly ladies thought him extremely\r\nhandsome, were eagerly gracious to him, did their best to thrust\r\nthemselves upon his attention, and received, it would seem, very little\r\nnotice in return for their pains.  If George showed himself {4}\r\nindifferent and even ungallant to his enthusiastic admirers, his\r\nbrother Edward was of a different disposition.  But though Edward, like\r\nhis brother, was an agreeable-looking youth, and keen to win favor in\r\nwomen's eyes, he found himself like Benedict: nobody marked him because\r\nhe was not the heir to the throne.\r\n\r\nIn some illustrated histories of the reign two portraits of George the\r\nThird are placed in immediate and pathetic contrast.  The one portrait\r\nrepresents George as he showed in the first year of his reign--alert,\r\nyoung, smiling, with short-cut powdered hair, a rich flowered coat, and\r\nthe star and ribbon of the Garter on his breast.  So might a young king\r\nlook called in the flower of his age to the control of a great country,\r\npleased, confident, and courageous.  The other picture shows how the\r\nKing looked in the sixtieth year of his reign.  The face is old and\r\nwrinkled and weary; the straggling white locks escape from beneath a\r\nfur-trimmed cap; the bowed body is wrapped in a fur-trimmed robe.  The\r\ntime of two generations of men lay between the young king and the old;\r\nthe longest reign then known to English history, the longest and the\r\nmost eventful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760--George's qualifications for King]\r\n\r\nGeorge the Third started with many advantages over his predecessors of\r\nthe same name.  He was an Englishman.  He spoke the English language.\r\nIt was his sincere wish to be above all things English.  He honestly\r\nloved English ways.  He had not the faintest desire to start a seraglio\r\nin England.  He had no German mistresses.  He did not care about fat\r\nwomen.  He was devoted to his mother--perhaps a good deal too devoted,\r\nbut even the excess of devotion might have been pardonable in the\r\npublic opinion of England; certainly it was only his own weakness and\r\nperversity that made it for a while not pardonable.  He was of the\r\ncountry squire's order of mind; his tastes were wholly those of the\r\nstolid, well-intentioned, bucolic country squire.  He would probably\r\nhave been a very respectable and successful sovereign if only he had\r\nnot been plagued by the ambition to be a king.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to remember that the accession of George {5} the Third\r\nwas generally and joyfully welcomed.  A hopeful people, having endured\r\nwith increasing dislike two sovereigns of the House of Hanover, were\r\nquite prepared to believe that a third prince was rich in all regal\r\nqualities; in all public and private virtues.  It would, perhaps, have\r\nbeen unreasonable on the part of any dispassionate observer of public\r\naffairs to anticipate that a third George would make a worse monarch\r\nthan his namesakes and immediate predecessors.  The dispassionate\r\nobserver might have maintained that there were limits to kingly\r\nmisgovernment in a kingdom endowed with a Constitution and blessed with\r\na measure of Parliamentary representation, and that those limits had\r\nbeen fairly reached by the two German princes who ruled reluctantly\r\nenough over the fortunes of England.  This same dispassionate observer\r\nmight reasonably, assuming him to possess familiar knowledge of certain\r\nfacts, have hazarded the prediction that George the Third would be a\r\nbetter king than his grandfather and his great-grandfather.  He was\r\ncertainly a better man.  There was so much of a basis whereupon to\r\nbuild a hope of better things.  The profligacy of his ancestors had not\r\napparently vitiated his blood and judgment.  His young life had been a\r\npure life.  He was in that way a pattern to princes.  He had been,\r\nwhich was rare with his race, a good son.  He was to be--and there was\r\nno more rare quality in one of his stock--a good husband, a good\r\nfather.  He was in his way a good friend to his friends.  He was\r\nsincerely desirous to prove himself a good king to his people.\r\n\r\nThe youth of George the Third had passed under somewhat agitated\r\nconditions.  George the Second's straight-forward hatred for his son's\r\nwife opened a great gulf between the Court and Leicester House, which\r\nno true courtier made any effort to bridge.  While the young Prince\r\nknew, in consequence, little or nothing of the atmosphere of St.\r\nJames's or the temper of those who breathed that atmosphere, attempts\r\nwere not wanting to sunder him from the influence of his mother.  Some\r\nof the noblemen and clergymen to whom the early instruction of the\r\nyoung {6} Prince was entrusted labored with a persistency which would\r\nhave been admirable in some other cause to sever him not merely from\r\nall his father's friends but even from his father's wife.  There was\r\nindeed a time when their efforts almost succeeded in alienating the\r\nyoung Prince from his mother.  The wildest charges of Jacobitism were\r\nbrought against the immediate servants of the Princess, charges which\r\nthose who made them wholly failed to substantiate.  The endeavor to\r\nremove the Prince from the tutelage of his mother was abandoned.  The\r\neducation of the Prince was committed to more sympathetic care.  The\r\nchange had its advantage in keeping George in the wholesome atmosphere\r\nof Leicester House instead of exposing him to the temptations of a\r\nprofligate Court.  It had its disadvantages in leaving him entirely\r\nunder the influence of a man to whose guidance, counsel, and authority\r\nthe Princess Dowager absolutely submitted herself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760--Lord Bute]\r\n\r\nObservers of the lighter sort are pleased to insist upon the trifles\r\nwhich have the most momentous influence upon the fortunes of peoples\r\nand the fates of empires.  A famous and facile French playwright\r\nderived the downfall of a favorite and of a political revolution from\r\nthe spilling of a glass of water.  There are times when the temptation\r\nto pursue this thread of fancy is very great.  Suppose, for instance,\r\nit had not chanced to rain on a certain day at Clifden, when a cricket\r\nmatch was being played in which Frederick, Prince of Wales, happened to\r\nbe interested.  A fretted Prince would not have had to retire to his\r\ntent like Achilles, would not have insisted on a game of whist to cheer\r\nhis humor.  There would have been no difficulty in forming a rubber.\r\nThere would have been no need to seek for a fourth hand.  No wistful\r\ngentleman-in-attendance seeking the desirable would have had to ask the\r\naid of a strange nobleman perched in an apothecary's chariot.  Had this\r\nstrange nobleman not been so sought and found, had the apothecary not\r\nbeen wealthy enough to keep a chariot, and friendly enough to offer a\r\npoor Scotch gentleman a seat in it, it is possible that the {7}\r\nAmerican Colonies might yet form portion and parcel of the British\r\nEmpire, that Chatham's splendid dreams might have become still more\r\nsplendid realities, that the name of Wilkes might never have emerged\r\nfrom an obscurity of debauch to association with the name of liberty.\r\nFor the nobleman who made the fourth hand in the Prince of Wales's\r\nrubber was unfortunately a man of agreeable address and engaging\r\nmanners, manners that pleased infinitely the Prince of Wales, and\r\ncemented a friendship most disastrous in its consequences to England,\r\nto the English people, and to an English king.  The name of the\r\nengaging nobleman was Lord Bute.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this memorable game of whist Lord Bute was thirty-six\r\nyears old.  He was well educated, well read, tall of body, pleasing of\r\ncountenance, quick in intelligence, and curious in disposition.  These\r\nqualities won the heart of the Prince of Wales, and lifted the young\r\nScotch nobleman from poverty and obscurity to prominence and favor.\r\nThe Prince appointed Bute a Lord of the Bedchamber and welcomed him to\r\nhis most intimate friendship.  The death of the Prince of Wales two\r\nyears later had no disastrous effect upon the rising fortunes of the\r\nfavorite.  The influence which Bute had exercised over the mind of\r\nFrederick he exercised over the mind of Frederick's wife and over the\r\nmind of Frederick's heir.  Scandal whispered, asserted, insisted then\r\nand has insisted ever since, that the influence which Lord Bute\r\nexercised over the Princess of Wales was not merely a mental influence.\r\nHow far scandal was right or wrong there is no means, there probably\r\nnever will be any means, of knowing.  Lord Bute's defenders point to\r\nhis conspicuous affection for his wife, Edward Wortley Montagu's only\r\ndaughter, in contravention of the scandal.  Undoubtedly Bute was a good\r\nhusband and a good father.  Whether the scandal was justified or not,\r\nthe fact that it existed, that it was widely blown abroad and very\r\ngenerally believed, was enough.  As far as the popularity of the\r\nPrincess was concerned it might as well have been justified.  For years\r\nno caricature was so popular as that which displayed the Boot and the\r\n{8} Petticoat, the ironic popular symbols of Lord Bute and the Princess.\r\n\r\nBy whatever means Lord Bute gained his influence over the Princess of\r\nWales, he undoubtedly possessed the influence and used it with\r\ndisastrous effect.  He moulded the feeble intelligence of the young\r\nPrince George; he guided his thoughts, directed his studies in\r\nstatecraft, and was to all intents and purposes the governor of the\r\nyoung Prince's person.  The young Prince could hardly have had a worse\r\nadviser.  Bute was a man of many merits, but his defects were in the\r\nhighest degree dangerous in a person who had somehow become possessed\r\nof almost absolute power.  In the obscurity of a private life, the man\r\nwho had borne poverty with dignity at an age when poverty was\r\npeculiarly galling to one of his station might have earned the esteem\r\nof his immediate fellows.  In the exaltation of a great if an\r\nunauthorized rule, and later in the authority of an important public\r\noffice, his defects were fatal to his fame and to the fortunes of those\r\nwho accepted his sway.  For nearly ten years, from the death of\r\nFrederick, Prince of Wales, to the death of George the Second, Bute was\r\nall-powerful in his influence over the mother of the future King and\r\nover the future King himself.  When the young Prince came to the throne\r\nLord Bute did not immediately assume ostensible authority.  He remained\r\nthe confidential adviser of the young King until 1761.  In 1761 he took\r\noffice, assuming the Secretaryship of State resigned by Lord\r\nHoldernesse.  From a secretaryship to the place of Prime Minister was\r\nbut a step, and a step soon taken.  Although he did not occupy office\r\nvery long, he held it long enough to become perhaps the most unpopular\r\nPrime Minister England has ever had.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760--Hannah Lightfoot and Lady Sarah Lennox]\r\n\r\nThe youth of George the Third was starred with a strange romance.  The\r\nfull truth of the story of Hannah Lightfoot will probably never be\r\nknown.  What is known is sufficiently romantic without the additions of\r\nlegend.  Hannah Lightfoot was a beautiful Quaker girl, the daughter of\r\na decent tradesman in Wapping.  Association with the family of an\r\nuncle, a linendraper, who lived near the {9} Court, brought the girl\r\ninto the fashionable part of the town.  The young Prince saw her by\r\naccident somehow, somewhere, in the early part of 1754, and fell in\r\nlove with her.  From that moment the girl disappears from certain\r\nknowledge, and legend busies itself with her name.  It is asserted that\r\nshe was actually married to the young Prince; that William Pitt,\r\nafterwards Earl of Chatham, was present at the marriage; that she bore\r\nthe Prince several children.  Other versions have it that she was\r\nmarried as a mere form to a man named Axford, who immediately left her,\r\nand that after this marriage she lived with the Prince.  She is\r\nsupposed to have died in a secluded villa in Hackney.  It is said that\r\nnot only the wife of George the Third but the wife of George the Fourth\r\nbelieved that the marriage had taken place.  We must not attach too\r\nmuch importance to a story which in itself is so very unlikely.  It is\r\nin the last degree improbable that a statesman like Pitt would have\r\nlent himself to so singular a proceeding.  Even if an enamoured young\r\nPrince were prepared to sanction his affections by a marriage, he would\r\nscarcely have found an assistant in the ablest politician of the age.\r\nThe story of the Axford marriage is far more probable.  If Hannah\r\nLightfoot had been married to George she would have been Queen of\r\nEngland, for there was no Royal Marriage Act in those days.\r\n\r\nAnother and more famous romance is associated with the youth of George\r\nthe Third.  Lady Sarah Lennox, the youngest daughter of the second Duke\r\nof Richmond, was one of the most beautiful women of her time.  The\r\nwriters of the day rave about her, describe her as \"an angel,\" as\r\nlovelier than any Magdalen by Correggio.  When she was only seventeen\r\nyears old her beauty attracted the young King, who soon made no secret\r\nof his devotion to her.  The new passion divided the Court into two\r\ncamps.  The House of Lennox was eager to bring about a marriage, which\r\nwas not then obstructed by the law.  Henry Fox, one of the most\r\nambitious men of that time or of any time, was Lady Sarah's\r\nbrother-in-law, and he did his best to promote the marriage.  On the\r\nother hand, the {10} party which followed the lead of the Princess\r\nDowager and Lord Bute fought uncompromisingly against the scheme.  The\r\nPrincess Dowager had everything to lose, Lord Bute had everything to\r\nlose, by such an alliance.  The power of the Princess Dowager over the\r\nyoung King would vanish, and the influence of Lord Bute over the\r\nPrincess Dowager would cease to have any political importance.  Lord\r\nBute did all he could to keep the lovers apart.  Henry Fox did all he\r\ncould to bring the lovers together.  For lovers they undoubtedly were.\r\nGeorge again and again made it plain to those who were in his\r\nconfidence that he was in love with Lady Sarah, and was anxious to make\r\nher his queen; and Lady Sarah, though her heart is said to have been\r\ngiven to Lord Newbottle, was quite ready to yield to the wishes of her\r\nfamily when those wishes were for the crown of England.  On the meadows\r\nof Holland House the beautiful girl, loveliest of Arcadian rustics,\r\nwould play at making hay till her royal lover came riding by to greet\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut the idyll did not end in the marriage for which Fox and the\r\nLennoxes hoped.  It is said that the King was jealous of Lord\r\nNewbottle; it is said that a sense of duty to his place and to his\r\npeople made him resolve to subdue and sacrifice his own personal\r\nfeelings.  He offered his hand and his crown to the Princess of\r\nMecklenburg-Strelitz.  Lady Sarah lost both her lovers, the King and\r\nLord Newbottle, who, in the words of Grenville, \"complained as much of\r\nher as she did of the King.\"  But she did not remain long unmarried.\r\nIn 1762 she accepted as husband the famous sporting Baronet Sir Thomas\r\nCharles Bunbury, and nineteen years later she married the Hon. George\r\nNapier, and became the mother of an illustrious pair of soldier\r\nbrothers, Sir Charles Napier, the hero of Scinde, and Sir William\r\nNapier, perhaps the best military historian since Julius Caesar.  Lady\r\nSarah died in 1826, in her eighty-second year.  In her later years she\r\nhad become totally blind, and she bore her affliction with a sweet\r\npatience.  At her death she is described by the chroniclers of the time\r\nas \"probably the last surviving {11} great-grand-daughter of King\r\nCharles the Second.\"  A barren honor, surely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760--Princess Charlotte Sophia]\r\n\r\nThe young Princess whom George married was in many ways well and even\r\nexcellently qualified to make a good queen.  It is said that she was\r\ndiscovered for her young husband after a fashion something resembling a\r\ntale from the \"Arabian Nights.\"  The Princess Dowager, eager to\r\ncounteract the fatal effect of the beauty of Lady Sarah Lennox, was\r\nanxious to have the young King married as soon as possible.  Her own\r\nwishes were in favor of a daughter of the House of Saxe-Gotha, but it\r\nis said that fear of a disease hereditary in the family overruled her\r\nwishes.  Then, according to the story, a Colonel Graeme, a Scotch\r\ngentleman upon whose taste Lord Bute placed great reliance, was sent on\r\na kind of roving embassy to the various little German Courts in search\r\nof the ideal bride.  The lady of the quest was, according to the\r\ninstructions given to Colonel Graeme, to be at once beautiful, healthy,\r\naccomplished, of mild disposition, and versed in music, an art to which\r\nthe King was much devoted.  Colonel Graeme, with this pleasing picture\r\nof feminine graces ever in his mind, found the original of the portrait\r\nin Charlotte Sophia, the second daughter of Charles Lewis Frederick,\r\nDuke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\r\n\r\nThere is another version of the manner of George's wooing which\r\nnullifies the story of Colonel Graeme's romantic mission.  According to\r\nthis other version George fell in love with his future queen simply\r\nfrom reading a letter written by her.  The tale sounds as romantic as\r\nthat of the Provencal poet's passion for the portrait of the Lady of\r\nTripoli.  It is true, however, that the letter of Charlotte Sophia was\r\nsomething of the nature of a state paper.  The Duchy of\r\nMecklenburg-Strelitz, of which the Princess Charlotte's brother was the\r\nsovereign, had been overrun by the troops of the King of Prussia.  The\r\nyoung Princess wrote a letter to the Prussian King, which came to\r\nGeorge's notice and inspired him, it is said, with the liveliest\r\nadmiration for the lady who penned it.  Whatever the actual reason,\r\nwhether the report of Colonel Graeme or the {12} charms of her\r\nepistolary style, the certain thing is that George was married, first\r\nby proxy and afterwards in due form, to the young Princess in 1761.\r\nThe young Princess was not remarkably beautiful.  Even the courtiers of\r\nthe day, anxious to say their strongest in her praise, could not do\r\nmuch more than commend her eyes and complexion and call her \"a very\r\nfine girl,\" while those who were not inclined to flatter said her face\r\nwas all mouth, and declared, probably untruly, that the young King was\r\nat first obviously repelled by the plainness of his wife's appearance.\r\nIf she was plain, her plainness, as Northcote, the painter, said, was\r\nan elegant, not a vulgar plainness, and the grace of her carriage much\r\nimpressed him.  Walpole found her sensible, cheerful, and remarkably\r\ngenteel, a not inconsiderable eulogy from him.  She was fairly\r\neducated, as the education of princesses went in those days.  She knew\r\nFrench and Italian, knew even a little English.  She had various\r\nelegant accomplishments--could draw, and dance, and play, had acquired\r\na certain measure of scientific knowledge, and she had what was better\r\nthan all these attainments, a good, kindly, sensible nature.  The\r\nmarriage could hardly be called a popular marriage at first.  Statesmen\r\nand politicians thought that the King of England ought to have found\r\nsome more illustrious consort than the daughter of a poor and petty\r\nGerman House.  The people at large, we are told from a private letter\r\nof the time, were \"quite exasperated at her not being handsome,\" beauty\r\nin a sovereign being a great attraction to the mass of subjects.  The\r\ncourtiers in general were amused by, and secretly laughed at, her\r\nsimple ways and old-fashioned--or at least un-English--manners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote--1761--The Coronation of George the Third]\r\n\r\nAfter the wedding came the coronation, a very resplendent ceremony,\r\nwhich was not free from certain somewhat ludicrous features, and was\r\nnot denied a certain tragic dignity.  It was enormously expensive.\r\nHorace Walpole called it a puppet-show that cost a million.  Loyal\r\nLondon turned out in its thousands.  Surprisingly large sums of money\r\nwere paid for rooms and scaffolds from which the outdoor sight could be\r\nseen, and much larger were paid {13} for places inside the Abbey.  It\r\nwas very gorgeous, very long, and very fatiguing.  The spectator\r\ncarried away, with aching senses, a confused memory of many soldiers,\r\nof great peers ill at ease in unbecoming habits, of beautiful women\r\nbeautifully attired, of a blaze of jewels that recalled the story of\r\nAladdin's mine, and of the wonderful effect by which the darkness of\r\nWestminster Hall was suddenly illuminated by an ingenious arrangement\r\nof sconces that caught fire and carried on the message of light with\r\ngreat rapidity.  The heralds in whose hands the ceremonial arrangements\r\nlay bungled their business badly, causing fierce heartburnings by\r\nconfusions in precedence, and displaying a lamentable ignorance of the\r\nnames and the whereabouts of many wearers of stately and ancient\r\ntitles.  When the King expressed his annoyance at some of the blunders,\r\nLord Effingham, the Earl Marshal, offered, for amazing apology, the\r\nassurance that the next coronation would be conducted with perfect\r\norder, an unfortunate speech, which had, however, the effect of\r\naffording the King infinite entertainment.  The one tragic touch in the\r\nwhole day's work may be legend, but it is legend that might be and that\r\nshould be truth.  When Dymoke, the King's Champion, rode, in accordance\r\nwith the antique usage, along Westminster Hall, and flung his glove\r\ndown in challenge to any one who dared contest his master's right to\r\nthe throne of England, it is said that some one darted out from the\r\ncrowd, picked up the glove, slipped back into the press, and\r\ndisappeared, without being stopped or discovered.  According to one\r\nversion of the incident, it was a woman who did the deed; according to\r\nanother it was Charles Edward himself, the Young Pretender--now no\r\nlonger so very young--who made this last protest on behalf of his lost\r\nfortunes and his fallen House.  It is possible, it is even probable,\r\nthat Charles Edward was in London then and thereafter, and it seems\r\ncertain that if he was in London King George knew of it and ignored it\r\nin a chivalrous and kingly way.  The Young Pretender could do no harm\r\nnow.  Stuart hopes had burned high for a moment, fifteen years earlier,\r\nwhen a handsome young {14} Prince carried his invading flag halfway\r\nthrough England, and a King who was neither handsome nor young was\r\nready to take ship from Tower Stairs if worse came of it.  But those\r\nhopes were quenched now, down in the dust, extinguished forever.  No\r\nharm could come to the House of Hanover, no harm could come to the King\r\nof England, if at Lady Primrose's house in St. James's Square a party\r\nshould be interrupted by the entrance of an unexpected guest, of a man\r\nprematurely aged by dissipation and disappointment, a melancholy ruin\r\nof what had once been fair and noble, and in whom his amazed and\r\nreverent hostess recognized the last of the fated Stuarts.  There were\r\nspies among those who still professed adherence to Charles Edward and\r\nallegiance to his line, spies bearing names honorable in Scottish\r\nhistory, who were always ready to keep George and George's ministers\r\nposted in the movements of the unhappy Prince they betrayed.  George\r\ncould afford to be magnanimous, and George was magnanimous.  If it\r\npleased the poor Pretender to visit, like a premature ghost, the city\r\nand the scenes associated with his House and its splendor and its awful\r\ntragedies, he did so untroubled and unharmed.  It was but a cast of the\r\ndice in Fortune's fingers, and Charles Edward would have been in\r\nWestminster Hall and had a champion to assert his right.  But the cast\r\nof the dice went the other way, and George the Third was King, and his\r\nlittle German Princess was Queen of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote--1761--The London gayeties of the time]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that those early days in London were the happiest in the\r\nlittle Queen's long life.  She had come from exceeding quiet to a great\r\nand famous city; she was the centre of splendor; she was surrounded by\r\nsplendid figures; she was the first lady of a great land; she was the\r\nqueen of a great king; she was the fortunate wife of a loyal,\r\nhonorable, and pure-minded man.  She was young, she was frank, she was\r\nfond of all innocent pleasures, keenly alive to all the entertainment\r\nthat Court and capital could offer her.  She crammed more gayeties into\r\nthe first few days of her marriage than she had dreamed of in all her\r\nprevious life.  The girl, who had never seen {15} the sea until she\r\ntook ship for England, had never seen a play acted until she came to\r\nLondon.  Mecklenburg-Strelitz had its own strong ideas about the folly\r\nand frivolity of the stage, and no Puritan maiden in the sternest days\r\nof Cromwellian ascendency, no Calvinist daughter of the most rigorous\r\nScottish household, could have been educated in a more austere\r\nignorance of the arts that are supposed to embellish and that are\r\nintended to amuse existence.  She went to playhouse after playhouse,\r\nalarmed at the crowds that thronged the streets to see her, but\r\nfascinated by the delights that awaited her within the walls.  She\r\nattended the opera.  She saw \"The Beggar's Opera,\" which may have\r\ncharmed her for its story without perplexing her by its satire.  She\r\nsaw \"The Rehearsal,\" and did not dream that twenty years later the\r\nhumors of Bayes, which she probably did not understand, would be\r\neclipsed forever by the fantasies of Mr. Puff.  She carried the King to\r\nRanelagh, to that amazing, enchanting assembly where all the world made\r\nmasquerade, and mandarins, harlequins, shepherdesses, and\r\nmuch-translated pagan divinities jostled each other through Armida's\r\ngardens, where the pink of fashion and the plain citizen, the patrician\r\nlady and the plebeian waiting-maid made merry together in a motley rout\r\nof Comus, and marvelled at the brilliancy of the illuminations and the\r\nmany-colored glories of the fireworks.\r\n\r\nThe London to which the little Princess came, and which she found so\r\nfull of entertainment, was a very different London from the city for\r\nwhich the first of the Georges had quitted reluctantly the pleasures of\r\nHanover and the gardens of Herrenhausen.  The Hanoverian princes had\r\nnever tried, as the Stuart sovereigns had tried, to stop by peremptory\r\nlegislation the spread of the metropolis.  London had been steadily\r\nspreading in the half-century of Guelph dominion, eating up the green\r\nfields in all directions, linking itself with little lonely hamlets and\r\ntiny rustic villages, and weaving them close into the web of its being,\r\nchoking up rural streams and blotting out groves and meadows with\r\nmonuments of brick and mortar.  Where {16} the friends of George the\r\nFirst could have hunted and gunned and found refreshment in secluded\r\ncountry ale-houses, the friends of George the Third were familiar with\r\nmiles of stony streets and areas of arid squares.  London was not then\r\nthe monster city that another century and a half has made it, but it\r\nwas even more huge in its proportion to the size of any of its rivals,\r\nif rivals they could be called, among the large towns of England.  The\r\ngreat city did not deserve the adjective that is applied to it by the\r\npoet of Chevy Chase.  London was by no means lovely.  However much it\r\nmight have increased in size, it had increased very little in beauty,\r\nand not at all in comfort, since the days when an Elector of Hanover\r\nbecame King of England.  It still compared only to its disadvantage\r\nwith the centres of civilization on the Continent; it still was rich in\r\nall the dangers and all the discomforts Gay had celebrated nearly two\r\ngenerations earlier.  And these dangers and discomforts were not\r\nconfined to London.  The world beyond London was a world of growing\r\nprovincial towns and increasing seaports connected by tolerable and\r\nsometimes admirable highways, and of smaller towns and villages reduced\r\nfor the most part to an almost complete isolation by roads that were\r\nalways nearly and often quite impassable.  To travel much in England in\r\nthose days was scarcely less adventurous even for an Englishman than to\r\ntravel in Africa to-day; for a foreigner the adventure was indeed\r\nenvironed by perils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1761--Fashions under George the Third]\r\n\r\nDress and manners had changed in the Hanoverian half-century, though\r\nnot as much as they were to change in the fifty years that were still\r\nin futurity.  Extravagance of attire still persisted, though the\r\nextravagance had changed its expression.  The gigantic hoops in which\r\nladies had delighted had diminished, had dwindled, and gowns were of a\r\nslender seemliness.  But reformed below, fantasy rioted above.  The\r\nheaddresses of women in the early days of the third George were as\r\nmonstrous, as horrible, and as shapeless in their way as the hideous\r\nhoops had been in theirs.  Vast pyramids of false hair were piled on\r\nthe heads of fashionable ladies, were pasted together with pomatums,\r\n{17} were smothered in powder and pricked with feathers like the\r\nheadgear of a savage.  These odious erections took so long to build up\r\nthat they were suffered to remain in their ugly entirety not for days\r\nbut for weeks together, until the vast structure became a decomposing\r\nmass.  It is rather ghastly to remember that youth and beauty and grace\r\nallowed itself to be so loathsomely adorned, that the radiant women\r\nwhose faces smile from the canvases of great painters, and whose names\r\nilluminate the chronicles of the wasted time of the reign of George the\r\nThird, were condemned to dwell with corruption in consenting to be\r\ncaricatured.  Till far on in the lifetime of Queen Charlotte the\r\nfashion in women's wear oscillated from one extreme to another, the\r\ngracious of to-day becoming the grotesque of yesterday, and mode\r\nsucceeding mode with the confusion and fascination of a masquerade.\r\n\r\nThe men were no less remarkable than the women for the clothes they\r\nwore, no less capricious in their changes.  A decided, if not a\r\nconspicuous, turn of public taste had done much since the accession of\r\nthe first George to minimize if not to obliterate the differences\r\nbetween class and class.  Men no longer consented readily to carry the\r\nbadge of their calling in their daily costume, and the great world came\r\ngradually to be no longer divided sharply from the little world by\r\nmarked distinction of dress.  But still, and for long after 1760, the\r\nclothes of men were scarcely less brilliant, scarcely less importunate\r\nin their demands upon the attention of their wearers, than the clothes\r\nof women.  Men made a brave show in those days.  A group of men might\r\nbe as strong in color and as vivid in contrast as a group of women; the\r\nneutralization of tone, the degradation of hue, did not begin till much\r\nlater, and only conquered in the cataclysm of the birth-throes of two\r\nrepublics.  Blue and scarlet, green and yellow, crimson and purple,\r\norange and plum-color were the daily wear of the well-to-do; and even\r\nfor the less wealthy there were the warm browns and murreys, the\r\nbottle-greens and clarets, and lavenders and buffs which made any crowd\r\na thing to please a painter in the eighteenth century.  In all the {18}\r\nvarying breeds of beaux and macaronis and dandies, of bucks and\r\nfribbles, into which the fine gentlemen of the age allowed themselves\r\nto be classified, the one dominant feature, the one common\r\ncharacteristic, was the love for gold and silver and fine laces, for\r\ngaudiness of color and richness of ornament, for every kind of\r\nexquisite extravagance, every refinement in foppishness.  There was a\r\npassion for the punctilio of dress, for the grace of a gold-headed cane\r\nand a chased sword-hilt, for the right ribbon, the right jewel, the\r\nright flower, and the right perfume, for the right powder in the hair\r\nand the right seals on the fob and the right heels and buckles on the\r\nshoes.  There was an ardent appreciation, an uncompromising worship of\r\nthe fine feathers that make fine birds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1761--The wine-drinking propensities of the age]\r\n\r\nThe social system of the polite world had been slowly changing with the\r\nsuccessive Georges.  The familiar events in the lives of the well-to-do\r\nclasses were growing steadily later.  The dinner hour, which was\r\ngenerally at noon or one in the reign of Queen Anne, had crept on to\r\nthree o'clock under the first, and to four o'clock under the second\r\nGeorge.  Under the third it was to grow later and later, until it made\r\nHorace Walpole rage as if the world were coming to an end because among\r\nfashionable folk it had settled itself at six o'clock.  In the country,\r\nindeed, for the most part people lived the quiet lives and kept the\r\nearly hours of Sir Roger de Coverley.  But, however, London lived, and\r\nwhatever London chose to do, England's simple honest King and England's\r\nsimple honest Queen would have no concern with the follies of fashion\r\nand the luxuries of late hours.  However much the rashness and\r\nwrong-headedness of his public policy forced him to accept the services\r\nand prime the pockets of a gang of drunkards and debauchees who called\r\nthemselves and were called the King's friends, the evil communications\r\nhad not the slightest influence upon the royal good manners, and did\r\nnot alter by one jot the rigid frugality of George's life and that of\r\nhis royal consort.  The King's friends were only the King's jackals;\r\nthey never were suffered for a moment to cross the line which severed\r\nthe {19} sovereign's private life from his public actions.  Indeed, it\r\nmay be assumed that few of the hard-drinking, hard-living, gambling,\r\nraking ruffians who battened on the King's bounty, and who voted white\r\nblack and good bad with uncompromising pertinacity and unappeasable\r\nrelish, would have welcomed the hard seats at the royal table, the\r\nmeagre fare on the royal platters, the homely countrified air the royal\r\ncouple breathed, and the homely countrified hour at which the royal\r\ncouple took up their candles and went to bed.  George the Third would\r\nbe long asleep at an hour when his friends would be thinking of paying\r\na visit to Ranelagh, or preparing to spend a pleasant evening over\r\ntheir cards, their dice-box, and their wine.\r\n\r\nEspecially their wine.  The one great characteristic of the gentility\r\nof the day was its capacity for drinking wine.  \"Wine, dear child, and\r\ntruth,\" says a Greek poet, naming the two most admirable gifts of life.\r\nTruth was not always very highly prized by the men who set manners and\r\nmade history in the second half of the eighteenth century, but to wine\r\nthey clung with an absolutely unswerving and unalterable attachment.\r\nIf the great Oriental scholar who adorned the age had been more\r\nfortunate in his studies, if Sir William Jones had chanced to make\r\nacquaintance with a Persian poet who has since become very famous among\r\nEnglishmen, he would have found in the quatrains of Omar Khayyam the\r\nvery verses to please the minds and to interpret the desires of the\r\nmajority of the statesmen, soldiers, divines, lawyers, and fine\r\ngentlemen of the day.  It is as impossible to imagine the men of the\r\neighteenth century without their incessant libations of wine as it is\r\nimpossible to imagine what the eighteenth century would have been like\r\nif it had been for the most part abstemious, sober, or even reasonably\r\ntemperate.  As we read the memoirs of the day, and if we believe only a\r\npart of what they tell us, making the most liberal allowance for the\r\nexaggeration of the wit and the satire of the cynic, we have to picture\r\nthe political and social life of the time as a drunken orgy.\r\nUndoubtedly there were then, as always, men of decent behavior and\r\ndiscreet life, men who would {20} no more have exceeded in wine than in\r\nany other way.  But the temper of the age and the tone of the\r\nfashionable world was not in tune with their austerity.  Wonder at the\r\nfrequency with which men of position got drunk then is only rivalled by\r\nwonder at the amount which they could drink without getting drunk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1761--Unpropitious time for the King's rule]\r\n\r\nThe cry of the Persian nightingale to the Persian rose, \"wine, wine,\r\nwine,\" was the cry to which hearts responded most readily in all the\r\nGeorgian era.  Walpole the father made Walpole the son drink too much,\r\nthat he might not be unfilially sober while his father was unpaternally\r\ndrunk.  A generation later the younger Pitt plied himself with port as\r\na medicine for the gout.  The statesmen of the period, in the words of\r\nSir George Trevelyan, sailed on a sea of claret from one comfortable\r\nofficial haven to another.  The amount of liquor consumed by each man\r\nat a convivial gathering was Gargantuan, prodigious, hardly to be\r\ncredited.  Thackeray tells, in some recently published notes for his\r\nlectures on the four Georges, of a Scotch judge who was forced to drink\r\nwater for two months, and being asked what was the effect of the\r\n_régime_, owned that he saw the world really as it was for the first\r\ntime for twenty years.  For a quarter of a century he had never been\r\nquite sober.  This man might be taken as a type of the _bons vivants_,\r\nthe _buveurs très illustres_ of the eighteenth century.  They were\r\nnever quite sober all through their lives.  They never saw the world as\r\nit really was.  They pleaded, preached, debated, fought, gambled,\r\nloved, and hated under the influence of their favorite vintage, saw all\r\nthings through a vinous fume, and judged all things with inflamed\r\npulses and a reeling brain.  But it must not be forgotten that the\r\npopulation of the country was not entirely composed of corrupt,\r\nhard-drinking politicians, profligate, hard-drinking noblemen, and\r\nfurious, hard-drinking country gentlemen.  If these were, in a sense,\r\nthe more conspicuous types, there were other types very different and\r\nvery admirable.  Apart from the great mass of the people, living their\r\ndull daily lives, doing their dull daily tasks, quiet, ignorant,\r\nunconscious that they {21} could or should ever have any say in the\r\ndisposition of their existences, there were both in town and country\r\nplenty of decent, sober, honorable, and upright men and women who had\r\nnothing in common with the fine gentlemen and the fine ladies who fill\r\nthe historical fashion plates.  If, unfortunately, Squire Western and\r\nParson Truliber were true pictures, at least Parson Adam and Sir Roger\r\nde Coverley still held good.  None the less a young, self-willed King,\r\nnot too intelligent and not too well educated, could scarcely have come\r\nto his sovereignty at a time less like to be fruitful of good for him\r\nor for the country that he was resolved to govern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{22}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nGEORGE AND THE DRAGONS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760--George the Third as a \"Briton\"]\r\n\r\nThe King was not lucky in his first act of sovereignty.  In his speech\r\nat the opening of Parliament on November 18, 1760, he used a form of\r\nwords which he, and some of those who advised him, evidently believed\r\nto be eminently calculated to advance his popularity.  \"Born and\r\neducated in this country, I glory in the name of Briton,\" the King\r\nsaid; and the words would seem to suggest such an intimacy of\r\nassociation between the King and the kingdom as must needs knit the\r\nhearts of ruler and of ruled more closely together.  Yet the choice of\r\nwords gave offence in certain quarters, and for two quite distinct\r\nreasons.  Many of the adherents and admirers of the late King--for even\r\nGeorge the Second had his admirers--were indignant at the contrast\r\nwhich the new King seemed deliberately to draw between himself and his\r\ngrandfather.  In accentuating the fact that he was born and bred in\r\nEngland, George the Third appeared by imputation to be casting a slur\r\nupon the German nature and German prejudices of George the Second.\r\nThis boast, however much it might offend the feelings of the friends of\r\nthe late King, was not at all calculated to affect the mass of the\r\npublic, who had little love for George the Second, and whose affection\r\nfor the new King was based mainly on the hope and the assumption that\r\nhe would prove to be as unlike the old King as possible.  But there was\r\nanother interpretation to be put upon the royal words which was likely\r\nto cause a wider impression and a wider hostility.  It would seem that\r\nsome of the King's advisers wished him to write that he gloried in the\r\nname of Englishman; it would even seem that the King had actually used\r\nthis word in the written draft of his speech.  {23} Lord Bute, it was\r\nsaid, had struck out the word \"Englishman,\" and had induced the King to\r\naccept the word \"Briton\" as a substitute.  The difference would not be\r\nquite without moment now: it appeared very momentous to many then, who\r\nread in the word chosen a most convincing proof of the Scotch influence\r\nbehind the throne.  The King's pride in styling himself a Briton was\r\ntaken to be, what indeed it was, evidence of his affection for the\r\nScotch peer who had been so lately sworn into his Privy Council; and\r\nthe alarm and indignation of all who resented the Scotch influence was\r\nvery great.  The Duke of Newcastle in especial was irritated by the use\r\nof the word \"Briton,\" and the evidence it forced upon him of his own\r\nwaning influence and the waxing power of Bute.  He even went so far as\r\nto wish that some notice should be taken of the \"royal words\" both in\r\nthe motion and the address; but in the end he and those who thought\r\nwith him felt that they must submit and stifle their anger for the\r\ntime, and so the King, unchallenged, proclaimed himself a Briton.\r\n\r\nWhatever else George had learned in the days of his tutelage, he had\r\nlearned to form an ideal of what a king should be and a determination\r\nto realize that ideal in his own rule.  The old idea of the personal\r\nauthority of the sovereign seemed to be passing away, to be dropping\r\nout of the whole scheme and system of the English Constitution along\r\nwith the belief in the theory of the Divine right of kings.  The new\r\nKing, however, was resolved to prove that he was the head of the state\r\nin fact as well as in name; that with his own hands he would restore to\r\nhimself the power and authority which his grandfather and his\r\ngreat-grandfather had allowed unwisely to slip through their fingers.\r\nThe difficulties in the way of such an enterprise might very well have\r\ndisheartened any being less headstrong, any spirit less stubborn.\r\nThere were forces opposed to him that seemed to overmatch his puny\r\npurpose as much as the giants overmatched the pigmy hero of the nursery\r\ntale.  St. George in the chivalrous legend had but one dragon to\r\ndestroy; the young royal St. George set himself {24} with a light heart\r\nto attack a whole brood of dragons--the dragons of the great Whig party.\r\n\r\nWhen George the Third came to the throne the government of the country\r\nwas entirely in the hands of the Whigs.  The famous stately Whig\r\nHouses, the Houses of Cavendish, of Russell, of Temple, of Bentinck, of\r\nManners, of Fitzroy, of Lennox, of Conway, of Pelham, of Wentworth,\r\nwere as little subservient to the sovereign as the great Frankish\r\nnobles who stood about the throne of the Do-nothing kings.  The Tory\r\nparty was politically almost non-existent.  No Tory filled any office,\r\ngreat or little, that was at the disposal of the Whigs, and the Whigs\r\nhad retained their ascendency for well-nigh half a century.  Jacobitism\r\nhad been the ruin of the Tory cause.  All Tories were not Jacobites,\r\nbut, roughly speaking, all Jacobites were Tories, and there were still,\r\neven at the date of George's accession, stout-hearted, thick-headed\r\nTory gentlemen who believed in or vaguely hoped for a possible\r\nrestoration of a Stuart prince.  It is curious to find that, though the\r\nWhig ranks stood fast in defence of the House of Hanover, had made that\r\nHouse, and owed their ascendency to their loyalty to that House, the\r\nlatest Hanoverian sovereign not only disliked them, but dealt them blow\r\nafter blow until he overthrew their rule.  The Tories, who sighed for a\r\nStuart prince over the water, suddenly found to their astonishment that\r\nthey had a friend in the Hanoverian Guelph, whose name they hated,\r\nwhose right to the throne they challenged, and whose authority they\r\nderided, when they dared not despise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1761--The corrupt methods of the Whig party]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the Whigs had often abused, and more than\r\nabused, the privileges which their long lease of power had given to\r\nthem.  All political parties ruled by corruption during the last\r\ncentury.  The Whig was not more corrupt than the Tory, but it can\r\nhardly be maintained that he was less corrupt.  The great Whig Houses\r\nbought their way to power with resolute unscrupulousness.  A majority\r\nin either House was simply a case of so much money down.  The genius of\r\nWalpole had secured his own pre-eminence at the cost of the almost\r\ntotal degradation {25} of the whole administrative system of the\r\ncountry.  When George the Third came to the throne the Whigs were\r\nfirmly established in a powerful league of bigotry and in tolerance,\r\ncemented by corruption, by bribery, by purchase of the most\r\nuncompromising, of the basest kind.  George the Third had fostered\r\nthrough youthful years of silence those strong ideas of his own about\r\nthe importance of the kingly office which he was now to proclaim by his\r\ndeeds.  In the way of those strong ideas, in the way of the steadfast\r\ndetermination to be King in fact as well as in name, stood the great\r\nWhig faction, flushed with its more than forty years' debauch of power,\r\ninsolent in the sense of its own omnipotence.  George was resolute to\r\nshow that the claim to omnipotence was a sham, and, to do him justice,\r\nhe succeeded in his resolve.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Whig party in the House of Lords was the Duke of\r\nNewcastle.  At its head in the House of Commons was William Pitt.\r\nThese two ministers seemed fixed and irremovable in their supreme\r\nauthority.  While Newcastle lavished the money of the state in that\r\nspacious system of bribery which welded the party into so formidable a\r\nmass, it was the proud privilege of Pitt to illuminate its policy by\r\nhis splendid eloquence at home and by the splendor of his enterprises\r\nabroad.  Both the ministers were an enormous expense to the country.\r\nNewcastle never counted the cost so long as there was a county member\r\nto be bought or a placeman to be satisfied.  Pitt never counted the\r\ncost so long as he could add another trophy of victory to the walls of\r\nWestminster Abbey and inscribe another triumph on England's roll of\r\nbattles.  The sordid skill of Newcastle and the dazzling genius of Pitt\r\nseemed between them to make the Whig party invulnerable and\r\nirresistible.  There was no opposition in Upper or Lower House; there\r\nhad been for many years no hint of royal opposition.  Everything\r\npromised a long continuance of the undisputed Whig sway when suddenly\r\nthe secret determination of a young King and the secret instigations of\r\na Scotch peer dissipated the stately fabric that had endured so long.\r\n\r\n{26}\r\n\r\nThe fixed purpose of Lord Bute was to get rid of Pitt.  The fixed\r\npurpose of Lord Bute created the fixed purpose of the King, and the\r\nhours of Pitt's administration were numbered.  After a season of rare\r\nglory, of resplendent triumph, Pitt found himself face to face with a\r\nformidable coalition of interests against him, a coalition of interests\r\nnone the less formidable because it was headed by a man for whose\r\nattainments, opinions, and ability Pitt must have felt, and scarcely\r\nconcealed, the greatest contempt.  Pitt had not made himself an object\r\nof personal affection to those with whom he was brought into immediate\r\ncontact.  In the time of his supremacy he had carried himself with a\r\nhaughty arrogance, with an austere disdain which had set the smaller\r\nmen about him raging in secret antagonism.  The King, driven on by his\r\nown dreams of personal authority, disliked the great minister.  Bute,\r\ndrunk with the wild ambitions of a weak man, seems to have believed\r\nthat in succeeding to Pitt's place he could also succeed to Pitt's\r\ngenius.  Pitt soon became aware of the strength of the cabal against\r\nhim.  While some of his colleagues were disaffected, others were almost\r\nopenly treacherous.  Bute's manner waxed more arrogant in Council.  The\r\nKing's demeanor grew daily cooler.  The great question of war or peace\r\nwas the question that divided the Cabinet.  On a question of war or\r\npeace Bute triumphed and Pitt fell.\r\n\r\nPitt was all for carrying on the war, which had thus far proved so\r\nsuccessful for the British flag.  But Pitt was not powerfully supported\r\nin his belief.  If he had his brothers-in-law James Grenville and Lord\r\nTemple on his side, he had ranged against him a powerful opposition\r\nformed by Henry Fox and George Grenville, by Lord Hardwicke and the\r\nDuke of Bedford.  On the side of the peace party Bute ranged himself,\r\nbringing with him all the enormous weight that his influence with the\r\nKing gave him.  The case of the peace party was a simple,\r\nstraight-forward case.  Why, they asked, should we continue to fight?\r\nOur sweet enemy France is on her knees and ready to accept our terms.\r\nLet us enforce those terms and make {27} a triumphant peace instead of\r\nfurther bleeding our exhausted treasury in the prosecution of a war\r\nfrom which we have now nothing more to gain.  Chance gave the peace\r\nparty their opportunity.  Pitt had become cognizant of the treaty\r\nbetween France and Spain known as the \"Family Compact,\" the secret\r\ntreaty which we have already fully described, by which the two Bourbon\r\nprinces agreed to make common cause against England.  Pitt straightway\r\nproposed that the hostile purposes of Spain should be anticipated by an\r\nimmediate declaration of war against Spain and the immediate despatch\r\nof a fleet to Cadiz.  Bute promptly opposed the proposal in the\r\nCabinet, and carried the majority of the Council with him in his\r\nopposition.  Pitt instantly resigned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1761--Pitt's probity]\r\n\r\nA curious thing had happened at the coronation ceremony.  One of the\r\nlargest jewels in the royal crown got loose and fell from its place.\r\nThis was looked upon at the time by superstitious people as a sinister\r\nomen.  These now saw the fulfilment of their forebodings in the loss to\r\nthe state of the services of the great minister.  The King himself had\r\nno sense that his regal glory was dimmed in its lustre by the\r\nresignation of Pitt.  He was so delighted at having got rid thus easily\r\nof the great obstacle to his own authority that he could readily\r\nconsent to lend to the act of parting a gracious air of regret.  Much\r\nwas done to lighten Pitt's fall.  Very liberal offers were made by the\r\nKing, offers which seemed to many to mask a hope, and more than a hope,\r\nof undermining the popularity of the great leader.  Pitt declined\r\nseveral offers that were personal to himself, but expressed his\r\nreadiness to accept some signs of the royal favor on behalf of his wife\r\nand his family.  A barony was conferred upon Pitt's wife and a pension\r\nof three thousand a year upon Pitt for three lives.  There was nothing\r\nunworthy in Pitt's action.  He was notoriously poor; he was no less\r\nnotoriously honest; it was perfectly certain that, in an age when a\r\nsuccessful politician was for the most part a peculator, no shilling of\r\npublic money had ever stuck to Pitt's fingers.  If he was instantly\r\nattacked by libels and pamphlets that were {28} probably paid for by\r\nBute, or that at least were inspired by a desire to please Bute, the\r\nattacks did Pitt more good than harm.  They produced a prompt reaction,\r\nand only had the effect of making Pitt more dear to the people than\r\nbefore.  His pictures had an enormous sale, and his partisans on the\r\npress poured out caricatures and lampoons upon Bute and his Scotchmen\r\nin greater volume and with greater violence than ever.\r\n\r\nBute was not content with the overthrow of Pitt.  He wished to stand in\r\nisolated splendor, and to accomplish this Newcastle too must go.  The\r\ngreat briber of yesterday had to give way to the great briber of\r\nto-day, and Bute stood alone before the world, the head of the King's\r\nMinistry, the favorite of the King, the champion of a policy that\r\npromised peace abroad and purity at home, and that resulted in a\r\nrenewal of war under conditions of peculiar disadvantage and a renewed\r\nemployment of the basest forms of political corruption.  Bute had\r\ngained the power he longed for, but Bute was soon to learn that power\r\nneed not and did not mean popularity.  \"The new Administration begins\r\ntempestuously,\" Walpole wrote on June 20, 1762.  \"My father was not\r\nmore abused after twenty years than Lord Bute is after twenty days.\r\nWeekly papers swarm, and, like other swarms of insects, sting.\"  Bute\r\naffected an indifference to this unpopularity which he did not really\r\nfeel.  It is not flattering to a statesman's pride to be unable to go\r\nabroad without being hissed and pelted by the mob, and it is hard for a\r\nminister to convince himself of the admiration of a nation when a\r\nstrong bodyguard is necessary to secure him from the constant danger of\r\npersonal attacks.  Bute's character did not refine under the tests\r\nimposed upon it.  His objectionable qualities grew more and more\r\nunpopular.  The less he was liked the less he deserved to be liked.\r\nAdversity did not magnify that small soul.  In his mean anger he sought\r\nfor mean revenge.  Every person who owed an appointment to the former\r\nministry felt the weight of the favorite's wrath.  Dismissal from\r\noffice was the order of the day, and Whig after Whig was forced to\r\nleave his place or office open for {29} some Tory who was ready to\r\nexpress an enthusiasm for the statesmanship of Bute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1762--Bute's foreign policy]\r\n\r\nBute's idea of a foreign policy was to reverse the policy of Pitt.  He\r\nabandoned Frederick of Prussia to his enemies by cutting off the\r\nsubsidy which Pitt had paid him, on the ground that the time agreed on\r\nfor the subsidy was up, and that as England only granted it for her own\r\npurposes, and not to benefit Frederick, she was justified in\r\ndiscontinuing it whenever it suited her.  Only a chance saved the Great\r\nFrederick from what seemed like inevitable ruin.  The Czarina,\r\nElizabeth of Russia, died, and was succeeded by Peter the Third.  With\r\nthe change of sovereign came a change in the purposes of Russia.  The\r\nRussian army, which had fought with Austria against Frederick, now\r\nreceived orders to fight with Frederick against Austria.  The war with\r\nSpain that Pitt had predicted Bute was obliged to wage.  The conduct of\r\nSpain made it impossible for him not to declare war, and, aided by\r\nPitt's preparations, he was able to carry on the war with considerable\r\nsuccess.  But the credit for such success was generally given to Pitt,\r\nand when Bute made peace with Spain and France it was generally felt\r\nthat the terms were not such as Pitt would have exacted after so long\r\nand splendid a succession of victories.  There was, indeed, a good deal\r\nto be said for the peace, but at the time those who tried to say it did\r\nnot get a very patient hearing.  It was well that the long Continental\r\nwar was ended.  Few of those engaged in it had gained much by it.\r\nPrussia, indeed, though it left her wellnigh bankrupt and almost ruined\r\nby the enormous burdens she had sustained, was better in position.  She\r\ncame out of the struggle without the loss of a single acre of\r\nterritory, and with what Frederick especially coveted, the rank of a\r\nfirst-rate Power in Europe.  If Prussia, which had been so long\r\nEngland's ally, had gained, England had not lost.  Undoubtedly Pitt's\r\nwar was popular; no less undoubtedly Bute's peace was unpopular, and\r\nthe unpopularity of the policy intensified the unpopularity of the\r\nminister.  In the eyes of the bulk of the English people Lord Bute, as\r\na Scotchman, was {30} a foreigner, as much a foreigner as if he hailed\r\nfrom France or the Low Countries.  Lord Chesterfield was finely\r\ndisdainful of the popular opposition to Bute on account of his\r\nnationality.  \"If the vulgar are ever right,\" he said, \"they are right\r\nfor the wrong reason.  What they selected to attack in Lord Bute was\r\nhis being a Scotchman, which was precisely what he could not help.\"\r\nBut it was not Bute's nationality, so much as his flagrant partiality\r\nto his fellow-countrymen, that made him unpopular.  His affection for\r\nhis own countrymen, however admirable and even touching in itself, was\r\nresented fiercely by the English people, who found themselves\r\nthreatened by a new invasion of the Picts and Scots.  Across the Border\r\ncame a steady stream of Bute's henchmen, men with names that seemed\r\noutlandish and even savage to the Londoner, and every Scotchman found,\r\nor hoped to find, through the influence of Bute his way to office and\r\nemolument.  The growing hatred for Bute extended itself as rapidly as\r\nunjustly to the nation from which Bute came.\r\n\r\nThe story of Bute's Ministry is a story of astonishing mistakes.  The\r\nTories, who for five-and-forty years had inveighed against the\r\npolitical corruption which, fostered by Walpole, seemed to have\r\nculminated under Newcastle, now boldly went in for a system of flagrant\r\nbribery which surpassed anything yet essayed by the most cynical of\r\nWhig ministers.  The Paymaster's Office became a regular mart where\r\nparliamentary votes were bought and sold as unblushingly as humbler\r\nfolk bought and sold groceries across a counter.  A Ministry weakened\r\nby an unpopular peace, and only held together by such cynical\r\nmerchandise, was not likely to withstand a strong storm, and the storm\r\nwas not long in rising.\r\n\r\nTo swell the exchequer, the Ministry proposed to raise revenue by a tax\r\non cider and perry.  It was resolved to levy an imposition of four\r\nshillings per hogshead on the grower of the apple wine and the pear\r\nwine.  The cider counties raised a clamor of indignation that found a\r\nready echo in London.  Pitt, Beckford, Lyttelton, Hardwicke, Temple,\r\nall spoke against the proposed measure and {31} denounced its\r\ninjustice.  George Grenville defended the bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--George Grenville's characteristics]\r\n\r\nGrenville was one of those honorable and upright statesmen who do not\r\ncontrive to make either honor or rectitude seem lovable qualities.  He\r\nhad first made himself conspicuous as one of the Boy Patriots who\r\nrallied with Pitt against Walpole.  His abilities ran with swiftness\r\nalong few and narrow channels.  He was desperately well informed about\r\nmany things, and desperately in earnest about anything which he\r\nundertook.  Blessed or cursed with a solemnity that never was enlivened\r\nby a gleam of humor, a ray of fancy, or a flash of eloquence, Grenville\r\nregarded the House of Commons with the cold ferocity of a tyrannical\r\nand pompous schoolmaster.  A style of speech that would have made a\r\ndiscourse upon Greek poetry seem arid and a dissertation upon Italian\r\npainting colorless--if it were possible to conceive Grenville as\r\nwasting time or thought on such trifles--added no grace to the\r\nexposition of a fiscal measure or charm to the formality of a phalanx\r\nof figures.  He was gloomy, dogged, domineering, and small-minded.  His\r\nnearest approach to a high passion was his worship of economy; his\r\nnearest approach to a splendid virtue was his stubborn independence.\r\nHe abandoned Pitt for Bute because he detested Pitt's prodigal policy,\r\nbut Bute was the more deceived if he fancied that he was to find in\r\nGrenville the convenient mask that he had lost in Newcastle; and the\r\nKing himself had yet to learn how indifferent the dry, morose pedant\r\nand preacher could be not merely to royal favor, but even to the\r\nexpression of royal opinion.  It was truly said of him by the greatest\r\nof his contemporaries that he seemed to have no delight out of the\r\nHouse except in such things as in some way related to the business that\r\nwas to be done within it.  The \"undissipated and unwearied application\"\r\nwhich he devoted to everything that he undertook was now employed in\r\nexasperating the country.  The time was not yet ripe for it to be\r\nemployed in dismembering the empire.\r\n\r\nIn his support of the cider tax Grenville managed to {32} make it and\r\nhimself ridiculous at the same time.  In his defence he kept asking,\r\nover and over again, \"Where will you find another tax? tell me where.\"\r\nPitt, who was listening disdainfully to his arguments, followed one of\r\nthese persistent interrogations by softly singing to himself, very\r\naudibly, the words which belonged to a popular song, \"Gentle shepherd,\r\ntell me where.\"  The House took the hint with delight, and the title of\r\nGentle Shepherd remained an ironical adornment of Grenville for the\r\nrest of his life.\r\n\r\nBute's disregard of public opinion was contrasted to his disadvantage\r\nwith the conduct of Sir Robert Walpole, who bowed to the demonstration\r\nagainst his far wiser system of excise.  Bute forced his tax forward in\r\ndefiance of the popular feeling, and then, apparently alarmed by the\r\nstrength of the spirit he had himself raised, he answered the general\r\nindignation by a sudden and welcome resignation on April 8, 1763.  This\r\nwas the end of Bute's attempt to be the recognized head of a\r\ngovernment, though he still hoped and believed that he could rule from\r\nbehind the throne instead of standing conspicuously at its side.  To\r\nhis unpopularity as a foreigner, to his unpopularity as a favorite,\r\npublic hostility added a fresh, if a far-fetched and fantastic reason\r\nfor detesting Bute.  It was pointed out that he had Stuart blood in his\r\nveins, that an ancestor of his had been the brother of a Scottish King.\r\nAny stick is good enough to strike an unpopular statesman with, and\r\nthere were not wanting people to assert, and perhaps even to believe,\r\nthat Bute had entertained insidious schemes for raising himself to the\r\nthrone.  Bute is said to have declared that he resigned in order to\r\navoid involving the King in the dangers with which his minister was\r\nthreatened.  If he did feel any fears for the King's safety he had\r\ncertainly done his best to make those fears reasonable.  It has not\r\noften been given to any statesman to hold the highest office in the\r\nstate for so short a time, and in that time to accomplish so large an\r\namount of harm.  And the immediate harm of that year and a half was\r\nlittle as compared with the harm that was to follow, a fatal legacy,\r\n{33} from the principles that Bute advocated and the policy that Bute\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--The retirement of Bute]\r\n\r\nWith Bute retired two of his followers, Dashwood and Fox.  Dashwood\r\nwent to the Upper House as Lord Le Despencer; Fox accompanied him as\r\nLord Holland.  The disappearance of Dashwood from the Commons was a\r\nmatter of little importance.  The disappearance of Fox marked the\r\nconclusion of what had been a remarkable, of what might have been a\r\ngreat career.  From this time Fox ceased to take any real part in\r\npublic business, and if his presence lent no lustre to the Lords, his\r\nabsence made the character of the Commons more honorable.  Fox, with\r\nall his faults, and they were many and grave, had in him the gifts of\r\nthe politician and the capacity of the statesman.  Dashwood was a\r\nvulgar fool, who, as Horace Walpole said, with the familiarity and\r\nphrase of a fishwife, introduced the humors of Wapping behind the veil\r\nof the Treasury.  But Fox was a very different type of man.  Had he\r\nbeen as keen for his own honor as he was eager in the acquisition of\r\nmoney, had he been as successful in building up a record of great deeds\r\nas he was successful in building up an enormous fortune, he might have\r\nleft behind him one of the greatest names in the history of his age.\r\nBut he carried with him to the Upper House the rare abilities which he\r\nhad put to such unworthy uses, and he lives in memory chiefly as the\r\nfather of his son.  In having such a son he rendered the world a good\r\nservice, which he himself labored with infinite pains to make into an\r\nevil service.\r\n\r\nA young, inexperienced, and headstrong King found himself suddenly the\r\ncentral figure of perhaps as singular a set of men as ever were\r\ngathered together for the purpose of directing the destinies of a\r\nnation.  A famous caricature of the period represents the front of a\r\nmarionette-show, through an aperture of which the hand of Bute pulls\r\nthe wires that make the political puppets work, while Bute himself\r\npeeps round the corner of the show to observe their antics.  No\r\nstranger dolls ever danced around a royal figure to the manipulation of\r\na favorite's fingers.  At {34} a time when political parties as they\r\nare now familiar to us did not exist, when Whiggism was so dominant\r\nthat Opposition in the modern sense was unknown, when the pleasures and\r\nthe gains of administration were almost entirely reserved for a\r\nprivileged caste, and when self-interest was the rarely disavowed spur\r\nof all individual action, it is scarcely surprising to find that the\r\nvast majority of the statesmen of the day were as unadmirable in their\r\nprivate as they were unheroic in their public life.  For then and long\r\nafter, the political atmosphere, bad at its best, was infamous at its\r\nworst, and by an unhappy chance the disposition of the King led him to\r\nfavor in their public life the very men whose private life would have\r\nfilled him with loathing, and to detest, where it was impossible to\r\ndespise, the men who came to the service of their country with\r\ncharacters that were clean from a privacy that was honorable.  Many, if\r\nnot most, of the leading figures of that hour would have been more\r\nappropriately situated as the members of a brotherhood of thieves and\r\nthe parasites of a brothel than as the holders of high office and the\r\ncaretakers of a royal conscience.  There were men upon the highway,\r\nrogues with a bit of crape across their foreheads and a pair of pistols\r\nin their holsters, haunting the Portsmouth Road or Hounslow Heath, with\r\nthe words \"Stand and deliver\" ever ready on their lips, who seem\r\nrelatively to be men of honor and probity compared with a man like the\r\nfirst Lord Holland or like Rigby.  There were poor slaves of the stews,\r\nwretched servants of the bagnios, whose lives seem sweet and decorous\r\nwhen compared with those of a Sandwich or a Dashwood or a Duke of\r\nGrafton.  Yet these men, whose companionship might be rejected by Jack\r\nSheppard, and whose example might be avoided by Pompey Bum, are the men\r\nwhose names are ceaselessly prominent in the early story of the reign,\r\nand to whose power and influence much of its calamities are directly\r\ndue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--The Duke of Grafton]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to accord a primacy of dishonor to any one of the many\r\nstatesmen whose names degrade the age.  Possibly the laurels of shame,\r\npossibly the palms of infamy {35} may be proffered to Augustus Henry\r\nFitzroy, third Duke of Grafton.  When George the Third came to the\r\nthrone the Duke of Grafton was only twenty-five years old, and had been\r\nthree years in the House of Lords, after having passed about twice as\r\nmany months in the House of Commons.  Destined to live for more than\r\nhalf a century after the accession, and to die while the sovereign had\r\nstill many melancholy years to live, the Duke of Grafton enjoyed a long\r\ncareer, that was unadorned by either public or private virtue.  There\r\nis no need to judge Grafton on the indictment of the satirist who in a\r\nlater day made the name of Junius more terrible to the advisers of King\r\nGeorge than ever was the name of Pietro Aretino to the princes whom he\r\nscourged.  The coldest chronicle of the Duke's careers, the baldest\r\nnarrative of his life, proves him to have been no less dangerous to the\r\npublic weal as a statesman than he was noxious to human society as an\r\nindividual.  He had not even the redeeming grace that the charm of\r\nbeauty of person lent to some of his companions in public incompetency\r\nand private profligacy.  His face and presence were as unattractive as\r\nhis manners were stiff and repellent.  His grandfather, the first Duke,\r\nwas an illegitimate son of Charles the Second by the Duchess of\r\nCleveland, and the Duke's severest critic declared that he blended the\r\ncharacteristics of the two Charles Stuarts.  Sullen and severe without\r\nreligion, and profligate without gayety, he lived like Charles the\r\nSecond, without being an amiable companion, and might die as his father\r\ndid, without the reputation of a martyr.\r\n\r\nGrafton did not die the death of his royal ancestor.  He lived through\r\nseventy-six years, of which less than half were passed in the fierce\r\nlight of a disgraceful notoriety, and more than half in a retirement\r\nwhich should be styled obscure rather than decent.  The only\r\nconspicuously creditable act of that long career was the patronage he\r\nextended to the poet Bloomfield, a patronage that seems to have been\r\nprompted rather by the fact that the writer was born near Grafton's\r\ncountry residence than by any intelligent appreciation of literature.\r\nHis curious want of taste {36} and feeling allowed him to parade his\r\nmistress, Nancy Parsons, in the presence of the Queen, at the Opera\r\nHouse, and to marry, when he married the second time, a first cousin of\r\nthe man with whom his first wife had eloped, John, Earl of Upper\r\nOssory.  If his example as a father was not admirable, at least he\r\nshowed it to a numerous offspring, for by his two marriages he was the\r\nparent of no fewer than sixteen children.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Rigby and the Duke of Bedford]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the prize for sheer political ruffianism, for the frank\r\naudacity of the freebooter, unshadowed by the darker vices of his\r\nbetter-born associates, may be awarded to Rigby.  Not that Rigby\r\nredeemed by many private virtues the unblushing effrontery of his\r\npublic career.  It was given to few men to be as bad as Dashwood, and\r\nRigby was not one of the few.  But his gross and brutal disregard of\r\nall decency in his acts of public plunder--for even peculation may be\r\ndone with distinction--was accompanied by a gross and brutal disregard\r\nof all decency in his tastes and pleasures with his intimate\r\nassociates.  Richard Rigby sprang from the trading class.  He was the\r\nson of a linen-draper who was sufficiently lucky to make a fortune as a\r\nfactor to the South Sea Company, and who was, in consequence, able to\r\nafford his son the opportunity of a good education, and to launch him\r\non the grand tour of Europe with every aptitude for the costly vices\r\nthat men in those days seemed to think it the chief object of travel to\r\ncultivate, and with plenty of money in his pocket to gratify all his\r\ninclinations.  Rigby did not take much advantage of his educational\r\nopportunities.  His Latinity laid him open to derision in the House of\r\nCommons, and there were times when his spelling would have reflected\r\nlittle credit upon a seamstress.  But he was quite capable of learning\r\nabroad all the evil that the great school of evil was able to teach a\r\nwilling student.  He returned to England, and began his life there with\r\nthree pronounced tastes: for gambling, for wine, and for the baser uses\r\nof politics.  His ambitions prompted him to adhere to the party of the\r\nPrince of Wales, and his ready purse won him a welcome among the\r\ncourtiers of Leicester House.  The Prince of {37} Wales did little to\r\ngratify his hopes, and Rigby would have found it difficult to escape\r\nfrom the straits into which his debts had carried him if his gift of\r\npleasing had not procured for him a powerful patron.  The Duke of\r\nBedford had been attracted by the remarkable convivial powers of Rigby,\r\npowers remarkable in an age when to be conspicuous for conviviality\r\ndemanded very unusual capacity both of head and of stomach.  To be\r\nadmired by Bedford was in itself a patent of dishonor, but it was a\r\nprofitable patent to Rigby.  The Duke, who was accused at times of a\r\nshameful parsimony, was generous to profusion towards the bloated\r\nbuffoon who was able and willing to divert him, and from that hour\r\nRigby's pockets never wanted their supply of public money.\r\n\r\nThere were few redeeming features in Rigby's character.  It was his\r\npeculiar privilege to be false to his old friends and to corrupt his\r\nyoung ones.  In an age when sobriety was scorned or ignored he had the\r\nhonor to be famous for his insobriety.  A sycophant to those who could\r\nserve him and a bully to those who could not, Rigby added the meanness\r\nof the social parvenu to the malignity of the political bravo.  At a\r\ntime when men of birth and rank came to the House of Commons in the\r\nnegligence of morning dress, Rigby was conspicuous for the splendor of\r\nhis attire, and illuminated the green benches by a costume whose glow\r\nof color only faintly attenuated the glowing color of his face.  There\r\nwere baser and darker spirits ready for the service of the King; there\r\nwas no one more unlovely.\r\n\r\nRigby's patron was as unadmirable as Rigby himself.  He was fifty years\r\nold when George the Third came to the throne, and he had lived his half\r\na century in the occupation of many offices and through many\r\nopportunities for distinction without distinguishing himself.  He had\r\nstill eleven years to live without adding anything of honor or credit\r\nto his name, or earning any other reputation than that of a corrupt\r\npolitician whose private life was passed chiefly in the society of\r\ngamblers, jockeys, and buffoons.  He had been Governor-General of\r\nIreland, and had {38} governed it as well as Verres had governed\r\nSicily.  He had been publicly horsewhipped by a county attorney on the\r\nracecourse at Lichfield.  His career, always unimportant, was\r\nignominious when it was not incapable, and it was generally both the\r\none and the other.\r\n\r\nAll the statesmen of the day were not of the school of Grafton.  There\r\nwere numerous exceptions to the rule of Rigby.  The Graftons and the\r\nRigbys gain an unnatural prominence from the fact that then and later\r\nit was to such tools the King turned, and that he always found such\r\ntools ready to his hands.  There were many men who, without any show of\r\nausterity or any burden of morality, were at least of a very different\r\norder from the creatures whom the King did not indeed delight to honor,\r\nbut whom he condescended to employ.  The Earl of Granville, with the\r\nweight of seventy years upon his shoulders, carried into active\r\npolitical life under his fourth sovereign the same qualities both for\r\ngood and evil that adorned or injured the name of Carteret.  He\r\naccepted Lord Bute's authority, and he did not live long enough to\r\nwitness Bute's fall.  He accorded to the peace brought about by Bute\r\n\"the approbation of a dying statesman,\" as the most honorable peace the\r\ncountry had ever seen.  He died in the January of 1763, leaving behind\r\nhim the memory of a long life which had always been lived to his own\r\nadvantage but by no means to the disadvantage of his country.  He left\r\nbehind him a memory of rare public eloquence and graceful private\r\nconversation, of an elegant scholarship that prompted him to the\r\npatronage of scholars, of a profound belief in his own judgment, and a\r\nno less profound contempt for the opinions of others.  His public life\r\nwas honest in an epoch when public dishonesty was habitual, and the\r\nbest thing to be said of him was the best thing he said of himself,\r\nthat when he governed Ireland he governed so as to please Dean Swift.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Dr. Samuel Johnson]\r\n\r\nAt a time when the King was surrounded by such advisers as we have\r\nseen, the King's chief servant and most loyal subject was a man no\r\nlonger young, who had nothing to do with the courts or councils, and\r\nwho yet was of {39} greater service to the throne and its occupier than\r\nall the House of Lords and half the House of Commons.  Long years\r\nbefore George the Third was born, a struggling, unsuccessful\r\nschoolmaster gave up a school that was well-nigh given up by its\r\nscholars and came to London to push his fortune as a man of letters.\r\nWhen George the Third came to the throne the schoolmaster had not found\r\nfortune--that he never found--but he had found fame, and the name of\r\nSamuel Johnson was known and loved wherever an English word was spoken\r\nor an English book read.  The conditions of political life in England\r\nin the eighteenth century made it impossible for such a man as Samuel\r\nJohnson ever to be the chosen counsellor, the minister of an English\r\nking.  The field of active politics was reserved for men of family, of\r\nwealth, or of the few whom powerful patronage served in lieu of birth\r\nand aided to the necessary opulence.  Johnson was one of the most\r\ninfluential writers of his day, one of the strongest intellectual\r\nforces then at work, one of the greatest personalities then alive.  But\r\nit would no more have occurred to him to dream of administrative honors\r\nand a place in a Ministry than it would have occurred to George the\r\nThird to send one of his equerries to the dingy lodgings of an author\r\nwith the request that Dr. Johnson would step round to St. James's\r\nPalace and favor his Majesty with his opinion on this subject or on\r\nthat.  It is not certain that the King would have gained very much if\r\nhe had done anything so unusual.  Dr. Johnson's views were very much\r\nthe King's views, and we know that he would have been as obstinate as\r\nthe King in many if not most of the cases in which the King's obstinacy\r\nwas very fatal to himself.\r\n\r\nWhen Queen Anne was still upon the throne of England, when James the\r\nSecond still lived with a son who dreamed of being James the Third, and\r\nwhen George the First was only Elector of Hanover, people still\r\nattributed to the sovereign certain gifts denied to subjects.  They\r\nbelieved, for instance, that the touch of the royal fingers could cure\r\nthe malady of scrofula, then widely known in consequence of that belief\r\nas the King's Evil.  In obedience to that {40} belief, in the spring of\r\n1712 some poor folk of Lichfield travelled to London with their infant\r\nson, in the hope that Queen Anne would lay her hand upon the child and\r\nmake him whole.  There were days appointed for the ceremony of the\r\ntouch, and on one of those days the Johnsons of Lichfield carried their\r\nlittle Samuel into the royal presence, and Queen Anne stroked the child\r\nwith her hand.  For more than seventy years a dim memory remained with\r\nJohnson of a stately lady in black; for more than seventy years the\r\nmalady that her touch was thought to heal haunted him.  When the man\r\nwho had been the sick child died, the third prince of a foreign house\r\nwas seated on the throne of England, and the third of the line owed,\r\nunconscious of the debt, no little of his security on his throne and no\r\nlittle of his popularity with the mass of his people to the struggling\r\nauthor who had received the benediction of the last Stuart sovereign of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nSamuel Johnson was born at Lichfield, in Staffordshire, on September 8,\r\n1709.  His father was a bookseller, perhaps too fond of books to be a\r\ngood dealer in them.  But his crowded shelves were a paradise to his\r\nson when at the age of sixteen he came home from the last of many\r\nschoolings, each of which had taught him much.  For two years he read\r\nhis way recklessly, riotously, and joyously through his father's\r\nmigratory library.  He took the advice of the varlet in \"The Taming of\r\nthe Shrew,\" and studied what he most affected.  His memory was as vast\r\nas his head was huge and his body bulky.  He read what he liked, and he\r\nstored his mind with as miscellaneous a mass of knowledge as ever was\r\nheaped up within the pent-house of one human skull.  That youthful zeal\r\nand fiery heat of study remained youthful with him to the end of his\r\nmany days; the passion for learning never burned low in that mighty\r\nbrain.  The man who in his old age studied Dutch to test the acquiring\r\npowers of his intellect, and still found them freshly tempered, acted\r\nin his ebullient boyhood as if, like Bacon, he had taken all knowledge\r\nto be his province.  The man who in his old age found an exquisite\r\nentertainment in reading a Spanish romance of chivalry, in his eager\r\n{41} boyhood found the Latin poems of Petrarch sweeter than apples.\r\nThe great Italian who counted the sonnets to which he owes his\r\nimmortality but as the clouds of a dream, and who built his hopes of\r\nfame upon that \"Africa\" which the world has been willing to forget,\r\nfound the reader he would have welcomed and the student he would have\r\ncherished in the ungainly youth who pored over him in a garret.  The\r\nboy Johnson, bent over the great folio, forgot that he was poor, forgot\r\nthat he was ill-clad, under the spell of the stately lines that their\r\npoet believed to be not less than Virgilian.  He had set out on an\r\nerrand even more trivial than that of Saul the son of Kish, and he had\r\nfound the illimitable kingdom of dreams.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1728--The college days of Dr. Johnson]\r\n\r\nChance sent the student of Petrarch to Pembroke College, Oxford, where\r\nhe passed two years eating the bitter bread of poverty in the bitter\r\npride of youth.  He was hungry, he was ragged, he was conscious of his\r\ngreat knowledge and his great gifts, and he saw all around him men in\r\nhigh places whose attainments he despised, and men seeking the same\r\ngoal as himself whose happy ease of circumstances he affected to\r\ndisdain and was compelled to envy.  His wild soul rose in rebellion at\r\nthe inequalities of life.  He passed for a mutineer.\r\n\r\nHis college days were bitter and rebellious; days of hunger and thirst\r\nand ruined raiment.  Some well-meaning person, moved to pity by the\r\nsight of Johnson's shabby shoes, patched and mended till they were past\r\nall wholesome cobbling, placed a new sound pair at Johnson's door in\r\nnameless benevolence.  Johnson cast them from him with fury, too proud\r\nto be shod by another man's bounty.  He drifted through his few and\r\ngloomy college days deriding and despising those in authority;\r\nseemingly wasting his time and yet not wasting it; translating Pope's\r\n\"Messiah\" into such noble Latin that Pope, moved by honest admiration,\r\ndeclared that future times would be unable to tell which was the\r\noriginal and which was the translation.  Johnson could be nowhere\r\nwithout learning, and he learned something at Oxford; but in any case\r\nhis stay was short, and he drifted back to Lichfield, leaving on the\r\n{42} banks of the Isis an amazing memory of a sullen savage creature,\r\nbrimmed with the strangest miscellaneous learning.  In Lichfield his\r\nfather's death, following hard upon his return from Oxford, left him\r\nlonelier and poorer than ever, troubled by the grim necessity to be\r\nfed, clothed, and sheltered, and by the uncertainty how to set about\r\nit.  He did set about it, earnestly, strenuously, if not very\r\nfruitfully.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Johnson and his work]\r\n\r\nHe was ready to do anything, to turn to anything, to write, to\r\ntranslate, to teach.  He fell in love with an amazing woman more than\r\ntwenty years his senior, monstrously fat, monstrously painted,\r\nmonstrously affected and absurd; he fell in love with her, and he\r\nmarried her.  She had a little money, and Johnson set up an academy for\r\nthe instruction of youth.  But youth would not come to be instructed.\r\nOne youth came, one of the very few, a soldier's son and a grandson of\r\na Huguenot refugee, named David Garrick.  The master and the pupil\r\nbecame friends, and the friendship lasted with life.  Master and pupil\r\nresolved to make the adventure of the town together.  The eyes of\r\naspiring provincials turned always to the great city, every ambitious\r\nprovincial heart beat with desire for the conquest of London.  The\r\npriest of letters and the player of parts, the real man and the shadow\r\nof all men, packed up bag and baggage and came to London to very\r\ndifferent fame and very different fortune.  The great city had one kind\r\nof welcome to give to the man who desired to speak truth and another to\r\nthe man who proposed to give pleasure.  The chances for men of letters\r\nand for players were very unlike just then.  The two strands of life\r\nran across the web of London, the strand of Johnson iron-gray, the\r\nstrand of Garrick gleaming gold.  Through long years Johnson hid in\r\ndingy courts and alleys, ill-clothed, ill-fed, an uncouth Apollo in the\r\nservice of Admetus Cave and his kind, while the marvellous actor was\r\nclimbing daily higher and higher on the ladder of an actor's fame, the\r\nfriend of the wealthy, the favored of the great, the admired, the\r\napplauded, the well-beloved.  Garrick deserved his fame and his\r\nfortune, his splendid successes and {43} his shining rewards; but the\r\ngrand, rough writer of books did not deserve his buffets and mishaps,\r\nhis ferocious hungers, his acquaintanceship with sponging-houses, and\r\nall the catalogue of his London agonies.  His struggle for life was a\r\nTitan's struggle, and it was never either selfish or ignoble.  He\r\nwanted to live and be heard because he knew that he had something to\r\nsay that was worth hearing.  He needed to live for the sake of his\r\nardent squalid affections, for the sake of the people who were always\r\ndependent upon his meagre bounty, for the sake of the wife he loved so\r\ndeeply, mourned so truly when she died, and remembered with such tender\r\nloyalty so long as life was left to him.  Miserably poor himself, he\r\nalways had about him people more miserable and more poor, who looked to\r\nhim for the very bread and water of their affliction, dependents whom\r\nhe tended not merely generously, but, what was better still,\r\ncheerfully.  Under conditions of existence that would have seemed\r\ncrushing to men of letters with a tithe of Johnson's greatness of soul,\r\nJohnson fought his way inch by inch in the terrible career of the man\r\nwho lived by his pen, and by his pen alone.  He wrote anything and\r\neverything so long as it was honorable to write and promised to make\r\nthe world better.  But it was not what Johnson wrote so much as what\r\nJohnson did that commanded his age and commands posterity.  In the\r\ntruest sense of the word, he lived beautifully.  \"Rasselas\" and \"The\r\nIdler,\" \"London\" and \"The Vanity of Human Wishes,\" \"The Rambler\" and\r\nthe \"Sessions of Lilliput,\" and the \"Lives of the Poets,\" and even the\r\nfamous \"Dictionary,\" only claim remembrance because they were done by a\r\nman who would be as interesting a study and as ennobling an example if\r\nhe had never written a line of the works that bear his signature in\r\nevery sentence of their solemn, even their portentous majesty.  Johnson\r\nhad the kindest heart wrapped in a rugged hide.  One of the noblest of\r\nthe many noble stories about him relates how he and a friend, whose\r\nname of Burke was not then famous, found a poor woman of the streets\r\nhouseless, hungry, and exhausted in the streets.  Burke had a room\r\nwhich he could {44} offer the poor creature for a night's shelter; but\r\nBurke could not get the woman there.  Johnson had no room--his\r\ndependents swarmed over every available space at his command--but he\r\nhad the strength of a giant, and he used it as a giant should, in\r\ncarrying the poor wretch in his arms to the roof that Burke could offer\r\nher.  Long years later, another man of letters, hungry, homeless, and\r\nfriendless, sick almost unto death, found a kind friend and gentle\r\nnurse in a woman of the streets.  In succoring De Quincey we may well\r\nthink that Anne was repaying something of the debt owed by one of her\r\nunhappy class to two of the glories of literature and of humanity.\r\n\r\nSlowly and surely Johnson's fame spread.  The \"Dictionary,\" massive\r\nfruit of many vigils, reward of many supplications, made him\r\nillustrious.  It might have been dedicated to Chesterfield, if\r\nChesterfield had shown to the struggling author the courtesy he was\r\neager to extend to the established writer.  Chesterfield need not be\r\nblamed if he was reluctant to welcome a queer ungainly creature whose\r\nmanners were appalling, and of whose genius no one save himself was\r\nassured.  But he was to be blamed, and he deserved the stern punishment\r\nhe received in Johnson's stinging letter of repudiation, for\r\nattempting, when Johnson was distinguished and beyond his power to\r\nhelp, to win the great honor of a dedication by a proffer of friendship\r\nthat came too late.  Johnson needed no Chesterfield now.  London had\r\nlearned to reverence him, had learned to love him.  His friends were\r\nthe best Englishmen alive; the club which Johnson established bore on\r\nits roll the most illustrious names in the country; at the home of the\r\nThrales Johnson tasted and appreciated all that was best in the home\r\nlife of the time.  He had a devoted friend in the person of a fussy,\r\nfantastic, opinionated, conceited little Scotch gentleman, Mr. James\r\nBoswell of Auchinleck, who clung to his side, treasured his utterances,\r\ncherished his sayings, and made himself immortal in immortalizing his\r\nhero.  It is good to remember that when George the Third came to the\r\nthrone a man like Johnson was alive.  It is not so good to remember how\r\nseldom he found himself {45} face to face with the King, whom he might\r\nhave aided with his wisdom, his counsel, and his friendship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Johnson's influence on literature]\r\n\r\nJohnson's presence adorned and honored four-and-twenty years of a reign\r\nthat was to last for sixty years.  He was the friend or the enemy of\r\nevery man worthy to arouse any strong emotion of love or scorn in a\r\nstrong spirit.  He had the admiration of all whose admiration was worth\r\nthe having.  The central figure of the literary London of his lifetime,\r\nhe exercised something of the same social and intellectual influence\r\nover all Londoners that Socrates exercised over all Athenians.  The\r\naffection he inspired survived him, and widens with the generations.\r\nIn the hundred years and more that have passed since Johnson's death,\r\nhis memory has grown greener.  The symbol of his life and of its lesson\r\nis to be found in what Hawthorne beautifully calls the sad and lovely\r\nlegend of the man Johnson's public penance in the rain, amid the\r\njeering crowd, to expiate the offence of the child against its father.\r\nJohnson was the very human apostle of a divine righteousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{46}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE \"NORTH BRITON\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--John Wilkes]\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful places on one of the most beautiful rivers in\r\nthe world is Medmenham on the Thames, hard by Marlow.  In the awakening\r\nof spring, in the tranquillity of summer, or the rich decline of\r\nAugust, the changing charm of the spot appeals with the special\r\ninsistence that association lends to nature.  Medmenham is a haunted\r\nplace.  Those green fields and smiling gardens have been the scenes of\r\nthe strangest idyls; those shining waters have mirrored the fairest of\r\nfrail faces; those woods have echoed to the names of the light nymphs\r\nof town and the laughter of modish satyrs.  It was once very lonely in\r\nits loveliness, a ground remote, where men could do and did do as they\r\npleased unheeded and unobserved.  Where now from April to October a\r\nthousand pleasure-boats pass by, where a thousand pleasure-seekers land\r\nand linger, a century and a half ago the spirit of solitude brooded,\r\nand those who came there came to a calm as unvexed and as enchanting as\r\nthe calm of Avallon.  They made strange uses of their exquisite\r\nopportunity.  They profaned the groves whose very winds breathed peace;\r\nthey polluted the stream that a poet would have found sacred.  The\r\nremains are there of a Cistercian abbey, the ruins of a ruin, twice\r\nfallen into disuse and decay.  It was a ruin in the eighteenth century\r\nwhen a member of Parliament, who was also a baronet and a Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, took it into his evil head to repair it.  Under the care\r\nof Sir Francis Dashwood it was restored for a new and altered life.\r\nThe abbey rose again, and once again was associated with a brotherhood\r\nof monks.  But where the quiet Cistercians had lived and prayed a new\r\n{47} brotherhood of St. Francis, named after their founder, devoted\r\nthemselves to all manner of blasphemy, to all manner of offence.  In a\r\nspot whose beauty might well be expected to have only a softening\r\ninfluence, whose memories might at least be found exalting, a handful\r\nof disreputable men gathered together to degrade the place, and, as far\r\nas that was possible, themselves, with the beastly pleasures and\r\nbeastly humors of the ingrained blackguard.\r\n\r\nThe Hell-Fire Club was dead and gone, but the spirit of the Hell-Fire\r\nClub was alive and active.  The monks of St. Francis were worthy pupils\r\nof the principles of the Duke of Wharton.  They sought to make their\r\nprofligacy, in which they strove to be unrivalled, piquant by a parody\r\nof the religious ceremonies of the Christian faith.  The energy and the\r\nearnestness which other men devote to the advancement of some public\r\ncause, to the furtherance of their country's welfare, or even to the\r\ngratification of their own ambitions, these men devoted to a passion\r\nfor being pre-eminent in sin, conspicuous in infamy.  If they succeeded\r\nin nothing else, they succeeded in making their names notorious and\r\nshameful, they succeeded in stirring the envy of men no better than\r\nthey, but less enabled by wealth or position to gratify their passions.\r\nThey succeeded in arousing the loathing not merely of honest men, but\r\neven of the knaves and fools whose rascality was not so rotten and\r\nwhose folly was not so foul as that of the noblemen and statesmen who\r\nrioted within the walls of Medmenham.\r\n\r\nIt is curious and melancholy to record that the leading spirits of this\r\nabominable brotherhood were legislators in both Houses of Parliament,\r\nmen of old family, great position, large means, men holding high public\r\noffice, members of the Government.  Their follies and their sins would\r\nscarcely be worth remembering to-day were it not for the chance that\r\ngave them for companion and ally one of the most remarkable men of his\r\nage, a man whose abilities were in striking contrast to those of his\r\nassociates, a man who might almost be called a man of genius.\r\n\r\n{48}\r\n\r\nJohn Wilkes was the son of a rich distiller and of a Presbyterian\r\nmother.  He had received a good education in England and at Leyden,\r\nwhere so many of the Englishmen of that day went as students.  He had\r\ntravelled much in his youth upon the Continent.  On his return he was\r\ninduced by his father, he being then only two-and-twenty, to marry a\r\nlady who was exceedingly rich, but who had the misfortune to be at\r\nleast ten years older than her husband.  It is scarcely surprising to\r\nfind that the marriage did not turn out happily.  Wilkes was young,\r\nfresh from the bright Continental life, delighting in pleasure and the\r\nsociety of those who pursued pleasure.  How far a happier marriage\r\nmight have influenced him for good it were idle to consider.  His\r\nmarriage he regarded always and spoke of always as a sacrifice to\r\nPlutus, not to Venus, and he certainly was at no pains to make it any\r\nmore of a sacrifice than he could help.  His wild tastes, his wild\r\ncompanions soon sickened and horrified Mrs. Wilkes.  The ill-matched\r\npair separated, and remained separate for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nWilkes was delighted to be free.  He was at liberty to squander his\r\nmoney unquestioned and unchallenged in the society of as pretty a gang\r\nof scoundrels as even the age could produce.  No meaner, more\r\nmalignant, or more repulsive figure darkens the record of the last\r\ncentury than that of Lord Sandwich.  Sir Francis Dashwood ran him close\r\nin infamy.  Mr. Thomas Potter was the peer of either in beastliness.\r\nAll three were members of Parliament; all three were partially\r\nresponsible for the legislation of the country; two were especially so\r\nresponsible.  All three were bound at least to a decorous\r\nacknowledgment of the observances of the Church; one was in especial so\r\nbound.  Sir Francis Dashwood and Lord Sandwich were, then or\r\nthereafter, members of the Government.  Sir Francis Dashwood was\r\nremarkable as having been the worst and stupidest Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer known to history.  Lord Sandwich was made First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty.  As for the third in this triumvirate of blackguards, Mr.\r\nThomas Potter was a son of the Archbishop {49} of Canterbury, and he\r\nwas soon afterwards made Vice-Treasurer for Ireland.  Into such\r\nhonorable hands were the duties of government delivered less than a\r\ncentury and a half ago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Wilkes's profligacy]\r\n\r\nIn this society Wilkes was made very welcome.  He brought to their\r\nfilthy fooleries something resembling wit; he brought an intelligence\r\nas far above that of his companions as that of the monkey is above that\r\nof the rabbit.  While he had money he spent it as royally as the rest.\r\nIf he rivalled them in their profligacy, he outstripped them by his\r\nintellect.  They were conspicuous only by their vices; he would have\r\nbeen a remarkable man even if it had pleased Providence to make him\r\nvirtuous.  It had not pleased Providence to make him attractive to look\r\nupon.  There were few uglier men of his day; few who lost less by their\r\nugliness.  But though we are well assured that his appearance was\r\nrepulsive, he redeemed his hideousness by his ready tongue and witty\r\nmind.  He said of himself, truly enough, that he only wanted half an\r\nhour's start to make him even with the handsomest man in England.\r\n\r\nWilkes flung his money and his wife's money about recklessly, while he\r\nplayed his part as a country gentleman upon the estate at Aylesbury\r\nwhich his unhappy wife had resigned to him when they separated.  Of\r\nthis money some eight thousand pounds went in an unsuccessful attempt\r\nto bribe his way into the representation of Berwick, and seven thousand\r\nmore went in the successful attempt to buy himself the representation\r\nof Aylesbury.  It is probable that he hoped to advance his failing\r\nfortunes in Parliament.  His fortunes were failing, failing fast.  He\r\nmade an ignoble attempt to bully his wife out of the miserable income\r\nof two hundred a year which was all that she had saved out of her\r\nwealth, but the attempt was happily defeated by that Court of King's\r\nBench against which Wilkes was to be pitted later in more honorable\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps impossible that Wilkes could long remain content with\r\nthe companionship of men like Dashwood and Sandwich; it was certainly\r\nimpossible that men {50} like Dashwood and like Sandwich could for long\r\nfeel comfortable in the companionship of a man so infinitely their\r\nsuperior in wit, intelligence, and taste.  The panegyrists of\r\nSandwich--for even Sandwich had his panegyrists in an age when wealth\r\nand rank commanded compliment--found the courage to applaud Sandwich as\r\na scholar and an antiquarian, on the strength of an account of some\r\ntravels in the Mediterranean, which the world has long since willingly\r\nlet die.  But the few weeks or months of foreign travel that permitted\r\nSandwich to pose as a connoisseur when he was not practising as a\r\nprofligate could not inspire him with the humor or the appreciation of\r\nWilkes, and a friendship only cemented by a common taste for common\r\nvices soon fell asunder.  There is a story to the effect that the\r\nquarrel began with a practical joke which Wilkes played off on Sandwich\r\nat Medmenham.  Sandwich, in some drunken orgy, was induced to invoke\r\nthe devil, whereupon Wilkes let loose a monkey, that had been kept\r\nconcealed in a box, and drove Sandwich into a paroxysm of fear in the\r\nbelief that his impious supplication had been answered.  For whatever\r\nreason, Wilkes and Sandwich ceased to be friends, to Wilkes's cost at\r\nfirst, and to Sandwich's after.  Sandwich owes his unenviable place in\r\nhistory to his association with Wilkes in the first place, and in the\r\nnext to his alliance with the beautiful, unhappy Miss Ray, who was\r\nmurdered by her melancholy lover, the Rev. Mr. Hickman, at the door of\r\nCovent Garden Theatre.  The fate of his mistress and his treason to his\r\nfriend have preserved the name of Sandwich from the forgetfulness it\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Wilkes as a Member of Parliament]\r\n\r\nIn those days Wilkes made no very remarkable figure in Parliament.  It\r\nwas outside the walls of Westminster that he first made a reputation as\r\na public man.  In the unpopularity of Bute, Wilkes found opportunity\r\nfor his own popularity.  The royal peace policy was very unwelcome, and\r\nagitated the feeling of the country profoundly.  Political controversy\r\nran as high in the humblest cross-channels as in the main stream of\r\ncourtly and political life.  At that time, we are told by a\r\ncontemporary {51} letter-writer, the mason would pause in his task to\r\ndiscuss the progress of the peace, and the carpenter would neglect his\r\nwork to talk of the Princess Dowager, of Lord Treasurers and\r\nSecretaries of State.  To win support and sympathy from such keen\r\nobservers, the Ministry turned again for aid to the public press that\r\nhad been so long neglected by the Whigs.  Smollett, the remembered\r\nnovelist, Murphy, the forgotten dramatist, were commissioned to\r\nchampion the cause of the Government in the two papers, the _Briton_\r\nand the _Auditor_.\r\n\r\nThe Government already had a severe journalistic critic in the\r\n_Monitor_, a newspaper edited by John Entinck, which had been started\r\nin 1755.  The _Monitor_ was not at all like a modern newspaper.  It was\r\nreally little more than a weekly pamphlet, a folio of six pages\r\npublished every Saturday, and containing an essay upon the political\r\nsituation of the hour.  Its hostility to Bute goaded the minister into\r\nthe production of the _Briton_, which was afterwards supplemented by\r\nthe creation of the _Auditor_ when it was found that Smollett had\r\ncalled up against the Ministry a more terrible antagonist than the\r\n_Monitor_.  For the _Briton_ only lives in the memories of men because\r\nit called into existence the _North Briton_.\r\n\r\nWilkes had entered Parliament as the impassioned follower of Pitt.  He\r\nmade many confessions of his desire to serve his country, professions\r\nwhich may be taken as sincere enough.  But he was also anxious to serve\r\nhimself and to mend his fortunes, and he did not find in Parliamentary\r\nlife the advancement for which he hoped.  Twice he sought for high\r\nposition under the Crown, and twice he was unsuccessful.  He wished to\r\nbe made ambassador to Constantinople, where he would have found much\r\nthat was congenial to him, and his wish was not granted.  He wished to\r\nbe made Governor-General of the newly conquered Quebec, and again his\r\ndesires were unheeded.  Wilkes believed that Bute was the cause of his\r\ndouble disappointment.  He became convinced that while the favors of\r\nthe State lay in Bute's hands they would only be given to Tories, and\r\nmore especially to Tories who were also {52} Scotchmen.  If Bute could\r\nhave known, it would have been a happy hour for him which had seen\r\nWilkes starting for the Golden Horn or sailing for the St. Lawrence.\r\nBut Bute was a foolish man, and he did his most foolish deed when he\r\nmade Wilkes his enemy.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the _North Briton_ was an event in the history of\r\njournalism as well as in the political history of the country.  It met\r\nthe heavy-handed violence of the _Briton_ with a frank ferocity which\r\nwas overpowering.  It professed to fight on the same side as the\r\n_Monitor_, but it surpassed Entinck's paper as much in virulence as in\r\nability.  Under the whimsical pretence of being a North Briton, Wilkes\r\nassailed the Scotch party in the State with unflagging satire and\r\nunswerving severity.  In the satire and the severity he had an able\r\nhenchman in Charles Churchill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1731-1764--The poet Churchill]\r\n\r\nThose who are inclined to condemn Wilkes because for a season he found\r\nentertainment in the society of a Sandwich, a Dashwood, and a Potter,\r\nmust temper their judgment by remembering the affection that Wilkes was\r\nable to inspire in the heart of Churchill.  While the scoundrels of\r\nMedmenham were ready to betray their old associate, and, with no touch\r\nof the honor proverbially attributed to thieves, to drive him into\r\ndisgrace, to exile, and if possible to death, the loyal friendship of\r\nthe poet was given to Wilkes without reserve.  Churchill was not a man\r\nof irreproachable character, of unimpeachable morality, or of\r\nunswerving austerity.  But he was as different from the Sandwiches and\r\nthe Dashwoods as dawn is different from dusk, and in enumerating all of\r\nthe many arguments that are to be accumulated in defence of Wilkes, not\r\nthe least weighty arguments are that while on the one hand he earned\r\nthe hatred of Sandwich and of Dashwood, on the other hand he earned the\r\nlove of Charles Churchill.\r\n\r\nChurchill's name and fame have suffered of late years.  Since Byron\r\nstood by the neglected grave and mused on him who blazed, the comet of\r\na season, the genius of Churchill has been more and more disregarded.\r\nBut the Georgian epoch, so rich in its many and contrasting types {53}\r\nof men of letters, produced few men more remarkable in themselves, if\r\nnot in their works, than Charles Churchill.  The cleric who first\r\nbecame famous for most unclerical assaults upon the stage, the satirist\r\nwho could be the most devoted friend, the seducer who could be so loyal\r\nto his victim, the spendthrift who could be generous, the cynic who\r\ncould feel and obey the principles of the purest patriotism, was one of\r\nthose strangely compounded natures in which each vice was as it were\r\neffaced or neutralized by some compensating virtue.  It may be fairly\r\nurged that while Churchill's virtues were his own, his vices were in\r\nlarge part the fault of his unhappy destiny.  The Westminster boy who\r\nlearned Latin under Vincent Bourne, and who was a schoolfellow of\r\nWarren Hastings, of Cowper, and of Colman, might possibly have made a\r\ngood scholar, but was certainly not of the stuff of which good\r\nclergymen are made.  An early marriage, an unhappy marriage contracted\r\nin the Rules of the Fleet, had weighed down his life with encumbrances\r\nalmost before he had begun to live.  Compelled to support an unsuitable\r\nwife and an increasing family, Churchill followed his father's example\r\nand his father's injudicious counsel and took Holy Orders.  Men took\r\nOrders in those days with a light heart.  It afforded the needy a\r\nlivelihood, precarious indeed for the most part, but still preferable\r\nto famine.  Men took Orders with no thought of the sanctity of their\r\ncalling, of the solemn service it exacted, of its awful duties and its\r\ninexorable demands.  They wished merely to keep famine from the door,\r\nto have food and fire and shelter, and they took Orders as under other\r\nconditions they would have taken the King's shilling, with no more\r\nfeeling of reverence for the black cassock than for the scarlet coat.\r\nChurchill was not the man to wear the clergyman's gown with dignity, or\r\nto find in the gravity of his office consolation for the penury that it\r\nentailed.  The Establishment offered meagre advantages to an\r\nextravagant man with an extravagant wife.  He drifted deeper and deeper\r\ninto debt.  He became as a wandering star, reserved for the blackness\r\nof bailiffs and the darkness of duns.  But the {54} rare quality he had\r\nin him of giving a true friendship to his friend won a like quality\r\nfrom other men.  Dr. Lloyd, under-master of his old school of\r\nWestminster, came to his aid, helped him in his need, and secured the\r\npatience of his creditors.  He was no longer harassed, but he was still\r\npoor, and the spur of poverty drove him to tempt his fortune in\r\nletters.  Like so many a literary adventurer of the eighteenth century,\r\nhe saw in the writing of verse the sure way to success.  Like so many a\r\nliterary adventurer of the century, he carried his first efforts\r\nunsuccessfully from bookseller to bookseller.  The impulses of his wit\r\nwere satirical; he was not dismayed by failure; the stage had\r\nentertained him and irritated him, and he made the stage the subject of\r\nhis first triumph.  \"The Rosciad\" was in every sense a triumph.  Its\r\nstings galled the vanity of the players to frenzy.  At all times a\r\nsusceptible brotherhood, their susceptibilities were sharply stirred by\r\nChurchill's corrosive lines and acidulated epigrams.  Their indignation\r\nfinding vent in hot recrimination and virulent lampoon only served to\r\nmake the poem and its author better known to the public.  Churchill\r\nreplied to the worst of his assailants in \"The Apology,\" which rivalled\r\nthe success of \"The Rosciad,\" and gained for the satirist the\r\nfriendship of Garrick, who had affected to disdain the praises of \"The\r\nRosciad,\" but who now recognized in time the power of the satirist and\r\nthe value of his approval.  Churchill himself was delighted with his\r\ngood fortune.  He was the talk of the town; he had plenty of money in\r\nhis pocket; he was separated from his wife, freed from his uncongenial\r\nprofession, and he could exchange the solemn black of the cleric for a\r\nblue coat with brass buttons and a gold-laced hat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1762--Newspaper polemics]\r\n\r\nLest the actors whom he had lashed should resort to violence for\r\nrevenge, he carried with ostentation a sturdy cudgel.  It was a\r\nformidable weapon in hands like Churchill's, and Churchill was not\r\nmolested.  For Churchill was a man of great physical strength.  He\r\ntells the world in the portrait he painted of himself of the vastness\r\nof his bones, of the strength of his muscles, of his arms like {55} two\r\ntwin oaks, of his legs fashioned as if to bear the weight of the\r\nMansion House, of his massive body surmounted by the massive face,\r\nbroader than it was long.  The ugly face was chiefly remarkable,\r\naccording to the confession of its owner, for its expression of\r\ncontentment, though the observant might discern \"sense lowering in the\r\npenthouse of his eye.\"  Like most giants, he overtaxed his strength,\r\nboth mentally and physically.  Whatever he did he did with all his\r\nmighty energy.  He loved, hated, worked, played, at white heat as it\r\nwere, and withered up his forces with the flame they fed.  In nothing\r\ndid his zeal consume itself more hotly than in his devotion to Wilkes.\r\n\r\nChurchill met Wilkes in 1762, and seems to have fallen instantly under\r\nthe spell which Wilkes found it so easy to exercise upon all who came\r\ninto close contact with him.  Undoubtedly Churchill's friendship was\r\nvery valuable to Wilkes.  If Churchill loved best to express his satire\r\nin verse, he could write strongly and fiercely in prose, and the _North\r\nBriton_ owed to his pen some of its most brilliant and some of its\r\nbitterest pages.  In the _North Briton_ Wilkes and Churchill laid about\r\nthem lustily, striking at whatever heads they pleased, holding their\r\nhands for no fame, no dignity, no influence.  It was wholly without\r\nfear and wholly without favor.  If it assailed Bute again and again\r\nwith an unflagging zeal, it was no less ready to challenge to an issue\r\nthe greatest man who over accepted a service from Bute, and to remind\r\nDr. Johnson, who had received a pension from the King's favorite, of\r\nhis own definition of a pension and of a pensioner.\r\n\r\nBefore the fury and the popularity of the _North Briton_ both the\r\n_Auditor_ and the _Briton_ had to strike their colors.  The _Auditor_\r\ncame to its inglorious end on February 8, 1763.  The _Briton_ died on\r\nthe 12th of the same month, leaving the _North Briton_ master of the\r\nfield.  Week after week the _North Briton_ grew more severe in its\r\nstrictures upon the Government, strictures that scorned the veil of\r\nhint and innuendo that had hitherto prevailed in these pamphleteering\r\nwars.  Even the _Monitor_ had always alluded to the statesmen whom it\r\nassailed by initial letters.  {56} The _North Briton_ called them by\r\ntheir names in all the plainness of full print, the name of the\r\nsovereign not being excepted from this courageous rule.  But the fame\r\nof the _North Briton_ only came to its full with the number forty-five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{57}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nNUMBER FORTY-FIVE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Wilkes's criticism of the King's speech]\r\n\r\nWhen Bute disappeared from the public leadership of his party, Wilkes,\r\nfrom professedly patriotic motives, delayed the publication of the\r\ncurrent number of the _North Briton_, to see if the policy which Bute\r\nhad inspired still guided the actions of the gentle shepherd, George\r\nGrenville.  Wilkes wished to know if the influence of the Scottish\r\nminister was at an end, or if he still governed through those wretched\r\ntools who had supported the most odious of his measures, the\r\nignominious peace, and the wicked extension of the arbitrary mode of\r\nexcise.  He declared himself that if Bute only intended to retire into\r\nthat situation which he held before he took the seals, a situation in\r\nwhich he dictated to every part of the King's administration, Wilkes\r\nwas as ready to combat the new Administration as he had been steady in\r\nhis opposition to a single, insolent, incapable, despotic minister.\r\n\r\nAny hope that Wilkes may have entertained of a reformation of the\r\nMinistry was dispelled by a talk which he had with Temple and Pitt at\r\nTemple's house, where Temple showed him an early copy of the King's\r\nspeech.  Wilkes, Pitt, and Temple were entirely in agreement as to the\r\nfatal defects of the speech, and Wilkes went promptly home and wrote\r\nthe article which made the forty-fifth number of the _North Briton_\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nIn itself the number forty-five was no stronger in its utterances than\r\nmany of the preceding numbers.  If its tone be compared with the tone\r\nof journalistic criticism of ministers or their sovereign less than a\r\ngeneration later, it seems sober and even mild.  Wilkes's article\r\nstarted with a citation from Cicero: \"Genus orationis atrox et {58}\r\nvehemena, cui opponitur genus illud alterum lenitatis et\r\nmansuetudinis.\"  Then came Wilkes's comment on the speech.  He was\r\ncareful not to criticize directly the King.  With a prudence that was\r\nperhaps more ironical than any direct stroke at the sovereign, he\r\nattacked the minister who misled and misrepresented the monarch.  \"The\r\nKing's speech has always been considered by the legislature and by the\r\npublic at large as the speech of the minister.\"\r\n\r\nStarting from this understanding, Wilkes went on to stigmatize the\r\nAddress as \"the most abandoned instance of ministerial effrontery ever\r\nattempted to be imposed upon mankind,\" and he doubted whether \"the\r\nimposition is greater upon the sovereign or on the nation.\"  \"Every\r\nfriend of his country,\" the writer declared, \"must lament that a prince\r\nof so many great and amiable qualities, whom England truly reveres, can\r\nbe brought to give the sanction of his sacred name to the most odious\r\nmeasures and to the most unjustifiable public declarations from a\r\nthrone ever renowned for truth, honor, and unsullied virtue.\"\r\n\r\nThe article was not intemperate and it certainly was not unjust.  But\r\nwhen it appeared the King was still new flushed with his idea of his\r\nown personal authority in the State, and the slightest censure of his\r\npolicy goaded him into a kind of frenzy.  Had Wilkes endeavored with\r\nhis own hand to kill the King in his palace of St. James's he could\r\nhardly have made the monarch more furious.  He had long hated and his\r\nministers had long dreaded the outspoken journalist.  King and\r\nministers now felt that the time had arrived when they could strike,\r\nand strike effectively.  The King commanded the law officers of the\r\nCrown to read the article and give their opinion upon it.  The law\r\nofficers did the work that they knew the King expected from them.  They\r\nfound that the paper was an infamous and seditious libel tending to\r\nincite the people to insurrection.  They declared that the offence was\r\none punishable in due course of law as a misdemeanor.  Upon this hint\r\nthe ministers acted, rapidly and rashly.  A general warrant was issued\r\nfor the apprehension of the authors, printers, and publishers of the\r\n_North Briton_.  The printer {59} and the publisher were arrested and\r\nbrought before Lord Halifax and Lord Egremont, to whom they gave up the\r\nnames of John Wilkes and Charles Churchill as the authors of the _North\r\nBriton_.  The next step was to arrest Wilkes himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Arrest of Wilkes]\r\n\r\nThe King's messengers came upon Wilkes in his house in Great George\r\nStreet, Westminster.  It is honorably characteristic of the man that in\r\nthe moment of his own danger he felt more concern for the danger of\r\nanother.  While he was arguing with the officials that they had no\r\npower to arrest him, as he was a member of Parliament and therefore\r\nprivileged against arrest, Churchill came into the room on a visit to\r\nWilkes.  Churchill, Wilkes knew, was as certain to be arrested as he\r\nwas.  Churchill could plead no privilege.  It was probable that the\r\nmessengers were unfamiliar with Churchill's face.  Wilkes, with happy\r\ngood-nature and happy audacity, immediately hailed Churchill as Mr.\r\nThompson, clasped his hand and inquired affectionately how Mrs.\r\nThompson did and if she was going to dine in the country.  If Wilkes\r\nwas clever in his suggestion Churchill was no less clever in taking the\r\nhint.  He thanked Wilkes, declared that Mrs. Thompson was at that\r\nmoment waiting for him, and that he had merely called in to inquire\r\nafter the health of Wilkes.  Saying which, Churchill swiftly bowed\r\nhimself out, hurried home, secured all his papers, and disappeared into\r\nthe country.  The King's messengers, who were promptly at his lodgings,\r\nwere never able to discover his whereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe flight to which Wilkes so ingeniously assisted him is not the\r\nbrightest part of Churchill's career.  He carried with him into his\r\nretreat a young girl, a Miss Carr, the daughter of a Westminster\r\nstonecutter, whom the charms of Churchill's manners had induced to\r\nleave her father's house.  He could not marry the girl, as he was\r\nmarried already, and, to do him justice, he appears soon to have\r\nrepented the wrong he had done her.  But after an unsuccessful attempt\r\non the girl's part to live again with her own people she returned to\r\nher lover, and she lived with her lover to the end.  Churchill seems to\r\nhave been sincerely {60} attached to her.  If he had been a free man,\r\nif his life had not been blighted by his early unhappy marriage, their\r\nunion might have been a very happy one.  At his death he left annuities\r\nto both women, to the woman he had married and the woman he had loved,\r\nthe wife's annuity being the larger of the two.\r\n\r\nWhile Churchill was making his way as quickly as possible out of a town\r\nthat his services to his friend had rendered too hot to hold him,\r\nWilkes was immediately hurried before Lord Halifax and Lord Egremont at\r\nWhitehall.  He carried himself very composedly in the presence of his\r\nenemies.  He persistently asserted his privilege, as a member of\r\nParliament, against arrest.  He refused to answer any questions or to\r\nacknowledge the authorship of No. 45 of the _North Briton_.  He\r\nprofessed with equal enthusiasm his loyalty to the King and his\r\nloathing of the King's advisers, and he announced his intention of\r\nbringing the matter before Parliament the moment that the session\r\nbegan.  Egremont and Halifax retaliated by sending Wilkes to the Tower\r\nand causing his house to be searched and all his papers to be seized.\r\nThe high-handed folly of the King's friends had for their chief effect\r\nthe conversion of men who had little sympathy for Wilkes into, if not\r\nhis advocates, at least his allies against the illegal methods which\r\nwere employed to crush him.\r\n\r\nWilkes, through his friends, immediately applied to the Court of Common\r\nPleas for a writ of _habeas corpus_.  This was at once obtained, and\r\nwas served upon the messengers of the Secretary of State.  But Wilkes\r\nwas no longer in their custody, and Wilkes was detained in the Tower\r\nfor a whole week, part of the time, as he declared, in solitary\r\nconfinement, before he was brought into court.  Judge Pratt immediately\r\nordered his discharge on the ground of his claim to immunity from\r\narrest as a member of Parliament, without prejudice to any later action\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Hogarth's caricature of Wilkes]\r\n\r\nIt was while Wilkes was before Pratt at Westminster that, if we may\r\naccept the authority of Churchill, one of Wilkes's keenest enemies\r\nseized an opportunity for a cruel {61} revenge.  Hogarth hated both\r\nWilkes and Churchill.  He had begun the quarrel by attacking the _North\r\nBriton_ and the _Monitor_ in his cartoon \"The Times,\" executed for the\r\ngreater glorification of the painter's patron, Lord Bute.  The _North\r\nBriton_ replied to this attack with a vigor which infuriated Hogarth,\r\nwho had his full share of the irritable vanity which the world always\r\nattributes to the artist.  In Wilkes's difficulty Hogarth saw his\r\nopportunity.  Lurking behind a screen in the Court of Common Pleas, the\r\npainter sought and found an opportunity for making a sketch of Wilkes.\r\nWhile Justice Pratt, with what Wilkes called \"the eloquence and courage\r\nof old Rome,\" was laying down the law upon the prisoner's plea\r\npreparatory to setting him at liberty, Hogarth's busy pencil was\r\nengaged upon the first sketch for that caricature which has helped to\r\nmake Wilkes's features famous and infamous throughout the world.  The\r\nprint was promptly published at a shilling, and commanded an enormous\r\nsale.  Nearly four thousand copies, it is said, were sold within a few\r\nweeks.  The envenomed skill of Hogarth has made the appearance of\r\nWilkes almost as familiar to us as to the men of his own time.  The\r\nsneering, satyr face, the sinister squint, the thrust-out chin and\r\nprotruding lower jaw belong to a face severely visited by Nature, even\r\nwhen liberal allowance is made for the animosity that prompted the hand\r\nof the caricaturist.  The caricature was a savage stroke; to Wilkes's\r\nfriends it seemed to be a traitor's stroke.  Wilkes appears to have\r\ntaken it, as he took most things, with composure.  \"I know,\" he wrote\r\nlater, \"but one short apology to be made for the person of Mr. Wilkes;\r\nit is that he did not make himself, and that he never was solicitous\r\nabout the case of his soul (as Shakespeare calls it) only so far as to\r\nkeep it clean and in health.  I never once heard that he hung over the\r\nglassy stream, like another Narcissus, admiring the image in it, nor\r\nthat he ever stole an amorous look at his counterfeit in a side mirror.\r\nHis form, such as it is, ought to give him no pain while it is capable\r\nof giving so much pleasure to others.  I believe he finds himself\r\ntolerably happy in the clay {62} cottage to which he is a tenant for\r\nlife, because he has learned to keep it in pretty good order; while the\r\nshare of health and animal spirits which Heaven has given him shall\r\nhold out, I can scarcely imagine he will be one moment peevish about\r\nthe outside of so precarious, so temporary a habitation, or will ever\r\nbe brought to own 'Ingenium Galbae male habitat:' 'Monsieur est mal\r\nlogé.'\"  Good-humored at the time, his good-humor persevered, and in\r\nlater life he was wont to say jestingly that he found he was growing\r\nmore and more like his famous portrait every day.  But if it was\r\nbecoming of Wilkes to bear the attack in so serene and even so jocular\r\na spirit, it was not unbecoming, as it was not ungenerous, of his\r\nfriends to fail to imitate the coolness of their leader.  It is not\r\nquite easy to understand why, in an age of caricature, an age when all\r\nmen of any notoriety were caricatured, the friends of Wilkes were so\r\nsensitive to the satire of Hogarth.  Public men, and the friends of\r\npublic men, have grown less sensitive.  However, Wilkes's friends were,\r\nand showed themselves to be, as angry as Wilkes was, or showed himself\r\nto be, indifferent, and the hottest and angriest of them all was\r\nChurchill.  Churchill could retaliate, and Churchill did retaliate with\r\na ferocity that equalled and more than equalled Hogarth's.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Churchill's denunciation of Hogarth]\r\n\r\nWith a rage that was prompted by friendship, yet with a coolness that\r\nthe importance of the cause he championed called for, Churchill aimed\r\nblow after blow upon the offending painter.  The skill of a practised\r\nexecutioner directed every stroke to a fresh spot, and with every\r\nstroke brought blood.  The satirist called upon Hogarth by his name, to\r\nstand forth and be tried \"in that great court where conscience must\r\npreside,\" bade him review his life from his earliest youth, and say if\r\nhe could recall a single instance in which\r\n\r\n  Thou with an equal eye didst genius view\r\n  And give to merit what was merit's duet\r\n  Genius and merit are a sure offence,\r\n  And thy soul sickens at the name of sense.\r\n\r\nThe poet goes on to say that \"when Wilkes our countryman, {63} our\r\ncommon friend arose, his King, his country to defend,\" Malice\r\n\r\n  Had killed thee, tottering on life's utmost verge,\r\n  Had Wilkes and Liberty escaped thy scourge.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in some two hundred lines of strenuous rage, Churchill\r\ndenounced Hogarth with a denunciation that was the more effective\r\nbecause it was accompanied by a frank and full recognition of Hogarth's\r\ngreat gifts and deserved title to fame.  Hogarth retaliated by his\r\nfamous caricature of Churchill as a canonical bear with a pot of porter\r\nin one paw and a huge cudgel in the other, the knots on the cudgel\r\nbeing numbered as Lie 1, Lie 2, and so forth.  Instantly the great\r\ncaricaturist was attacked by others eager to strike at one who had\r\nstruck so hard in his day.  The hatred of Bute was extended to the\r\npainter who condescended to accept Bute's patronage, and who labored to\r\nplease his patron.  Hogarth was derided as \"The Butyfier,\" in mockery\r\nof his \"Analysis of Beauty.\"  It would have been as lucky for Hogarth\r\nas it would have been lucky for Bute to let Wilkes alone.\r\n\r\nIf Wilkes's release filled his supporters throughout the country with\r\ndelight, it only spurred on his enemies to fresh attempts and fresh\r\nblunders.  Had they left the matter where it stood, even though it\r\nstood at a defeat to them, they would have spared themselves much\r\nignominy.  But the fury of the King inspired a fiercer fury in the\r\nministers and those who followed the ministers.  Every weapon at their\r\ncommand was immediately levelled at Wilkes, even, it may not be\r\nunfairly asserted, the assassin's weapon.  Wilkes carried himself\r\ngallantly, defiantly, even insolently.  His attitude was not one to\r\ntempt angry opponents to forbearance.  His letters from the Tower and\r\nafter his release to Lord Halifax were couched in the most contemptuous\r\nlanguage.  He brought an action against Lord Halifax.  He brought an\r\naction against Mr. Wood, the Under-Secretary of State, and was awarded\r\n1,000 pounds damages.  When Lord Egremont died, in the August of 1763,\r\nWilkes declared that he had \"been gathered {64} to the dull of ancient\r\ndays.\"  He republished the numbers of the _North Briton_ in a single\r\nvolume with notes, to prove that the King's speech could\r\nconstitutionally be only regarded as the utterance of the King's\r\nministers.  There must have been a splendid stubbornness in the man\r\nwhich enabled him to face so daringly, so aggressively, the desperate\r\nodds against him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Wilkes and his accusers]\r\n\r\nEvery man who wished to curry favor with the King and the King's\r\nministers was ready to strike his blow at Wilkes.  There was not a\r\nbully among the hangers-on of the King and ministers who was not eager\r\nto cross swords with Wilkes or level pistol at him.  Insult after\r\ninsult, injury after injury, were offered to the obnoxious politician.\r\nThe King dismissed him from the colonelcy of the Buckinghamshire\r\nMilitia.  Lord Temple was the Lord-Lieutenant of the county of\r\nBuckinghamshire, and as Lord-Lieutenant it was his duty to convey to\r\nWilkes the news of his disgrace.  Never was such news so conveyed.\r\nTemple told Wilkes of his dismissal in a letter of warm enthusiasm, of\r\nwarm personal praise.  The King immediately retaliated by removing\r\nTemple from the Lord-Lieutenancy and striking his name off the list of\r\nprivy councillors.  The enmity was not confined to the King and to the\r\nparasites who sought to please the King.  Dr. Johnson declared that if\r\nhe were the monarch he would have sent half a dozen footmen to duck\r\nWilkes for daring to censure his royal master or his royal master's\r\nministers.  In the House of Commons the hostility was at its height.\r\nWhen Parliament met Wilkes sought to call the attention of the House to\r\nhis case, but was anticipated by Grenville, who read a royal message\r\ndirected at Wilkes, the result of which was that the House voted that\r\nthe number Forty-five of the _North Briton_ was a seditious libel, and\r\nordered it to be burned by the common hangman.\r\n\r\nThe basest part of the attack upon Wilkes was the use that his enemies\r\nmade of his private papers, the way in which they associated his\r\npolitical conduct with an offence that was wholly unpolitical.  It had\r\namused Wilkes to set up a private printing-press at his own house.  At\r\nthis {65} press certain productions were printed which were no doubt\r\nindecent, which were no doubt blasphemous, but which were furthermore\r\nso foolish as to make both their indecency and their blasphemy of very\r\nlittle effect.  One was the \"Essay on Woman,\" written as a parody of\r\nPope's \"Essay on Man;\" the other was an imitation of the \"Veni\r\nCreator.\"  Neither of these pieces of gross buffoonery bore any\r\nauthor's name.  Very few copies of them had been printed, and these few\r\nsolely for circulation among private friends with a taste for foul\r\nliterature.  No offence had been committed, no offence had been\r\nintended, against public morality.  It is certain, as far as any\r\nliterary puzzle can be regarded as certain, that Wilkes's share in the\r\ndirty business was chiefly, if not entirely, limited to the printing of\r\nthe pages.  The \"Essay on Woman,\" as those who have had the misfortune\r\nto read it know, is a dreary writer's piece of schoolboy obscenity, if\r\nentirely disgusting, no less entirely dull.  The text of the \"Essay\"\r\nwas composed in great part, if not altogether, by Potter, the unworthy\r\nson of the Archbishop of Canterbury and worthy member of the Medmenham\r\nbrotherhood.  When Wilkes's papers were seized, or by some other means,\r\nthe Government got possession of the proof sheets of the \"Essay on\r\nWoman.\"  They immediately resolved, in defiance of public decency, of\r\npolitical morality, to use it as a weapon against their enemy.  It\r\nshows the shallowness of their pretence at justification that they put\r\nthe weapon into the hands of the worst and basest of Wilkes's former\r\nfriends and allies in profligacy, into the hands of Lord Sandwich.  On\r\nthe first night of the session Lord Sandwich rose in the House of\r\nLords, and proceeded to denounce Wilkes and the \"Essay on Woman\" with a\r\nvehemence of false austerity that impressed the assembly and infinitely\r\ndelighted Lord Le Despencer, who had been the common friend, the\r\nbrother sinner of accuser and accused, and who now expressed much\r\nentertainment at hearing the devil preach.  The spurious virtue of\r\nSandwich was followed by the spurious indignation of Warburton.  The\r\n\"Essay on Woman\" contained certain notes written in parody of\r\nWarburton's notes {66} to the \"Essay on Man,\" just as the verses\r\nthemselves were a parody on Pope's poem.  Warburton chose to regard\r\nthis as a broach of privilege, and he assailed Wilkes with even greater\r\nfury than Sandwich had done, winding up by apologizing to the devil for\r\neven comparing Wilkes to him.  An admiring House immediately voted the\r\npoems obscene, libellous, and a breach of privilege.  Two days\r\nafterwards an address from the Lords called upon the King to prosecute\r\nWilkes for blasphemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763--Wilkes as a champion of popular liberty]\r\n\r\nWilkes was unable to face this new attack.  He had already fallen a\r\nvictim to an attack of another and no less malignant nature.  While the\r\ncreatures of the Government in the Upper House were trying to destroy\r\nhis character, one of their creatures in the Lower House was doing his\r\nbest to take Wilkes's life.  This was a man named Martin, who had been\r\nattacked in the _North Briton_ some eight months earlier.  Martin\r\nseemed to have resolved upon revenge, and to have set about obtaining\r\nit after the fashion not of the gentleman, but of the bravo.  Day by\r\nday, week by week, month by month he practised himself in pistol\r\nshooting, until he considered that his skill was sufficient to enable\r\nhim to take the dastard's hazard in a duel.  He seized the opportunity\r\nof the debate on November 15th to describe the writer in the _North\r\nBriton_ as a \"coward and a malignant scoundrel.\"  When Wilkes, on the\r\nfollowing day, avowed the authorship of the paper, Martin sent him a\r\nchallenge.  The challenge was in all respects a strange one.  It was\r\ntreacherous, because it came at the heels of deliberate preparation.\r\nIt was peremptory, for it called upon Wilkes to meet his enemy in Hyde\r\nPark within an hour.  It contravened the laws of the duello, because\r\nMartin, who was the challenger, himself insisted on the use of the\r\nweapons with which he had made himself so murderously skilful.  Wilkes\r\naccepted the duel with characteristic courage, with characteristic\r\nrashness.  He met Martin in Hyde Park, and the amateur bravo shot\r\nWilkes through the body.  It is a further characteristic of the many\r\nelements of good that went to Wilkes's strange composition that, as he\r\nlay on the grass bleeding fast and {67} apparently mortally wounded,\r\nhis first care was not for himself and his hurt, but for the safety of\r\nhis adversary, of an adversary who deserved chivalrous treatment as\r\nlittle as if he had taken Wilkes unawares and shot him in the back.\r\n\r\nWhile Wilkes was lying on what threatened to be his death-bed the\r\nfeeling on both sides only increased in intensity.  The Ministry were\r\nindifferent to the helplessness of their enemy.  Wilkes was expelled\r\nfrom the House of Commons.  He was expelled from the Militia.  The\r\ncommon hangman was ordered publicly to burn the _North Briton_, but the\r\nhangman was not suffered to obey the order.  An angry mob set upon him\r\nand upon the sheriffs who were assisting at the ceremony, rescued the\r\n_North Briton_ from its persecutors, and in rude retaliation burned\r\ninstead the joint emblems of the popular disdain--a boot and a\r\npetticoat.  The people's blood was up; the symptoms were significant\r\nenough for any save such a King and such ministers to understand.\r\nWhile the Ministry, with a refinement of cruelty, were sending daily\r\nthe King's surgeons to watch Wilkes's health and proclaim the moment\r\nwhen he might again be attacked, the Corporation of Dublin was setting\r\nan example that was soon followed by the Corporation of London and by\r\nother corporations in presenting him with the freedom of its city.\r\nWhile Wilkes was slowly journeying towards Paris, where his daughter\r\nwas, and passing, as he wrote, \"the most unhappy days he had known,\" an\r\nangry mob gibbeted the effigy of Bute at one of the gates of Exeter,\r\nand kept the image swinging there in derision for a fortnight in\r\ndefiance of the authorities.  While Wilkes was languishing in foreign\r\nexile to save his liberty and his very life from the malignity of his\r\nenemies, his portrait, painted by Reynolds, was placed in the Guildhall\r\nwith an inscription in honor of the jealous assertor of English liberty\r\nby law.\r\n\r\nWilkes was well advised in keeping out of England.  He had done his\r\npart.  The decisions of Pratt in the Court of Common Pleas, the\r\ndecisions in the Guildhall, had conferred a permanent benefit upon the\r\nEnglish citizen.  But {68} Wilkes was not bound to put himself into the\r\npower of his enemies in order to establish the authorship of the \"Essay\r\non Woman.\"  His enemies took as much advantage as they could of his\r\nabsence.  He was found guilty by the Court of King's Bench of having\r\nreprinted the number Forty-five and of having written the \"Essay on\r\nWoman.\"  As he did not appear to receive his sentence, he was promptly\r\noutlawed for contumacy.  Thus a Ministry wise in their own conceit\r\nbelieved that they had got rid of Wilkes for good and all.  They did\r\nnot note, or if they noted did not heed, that the favorite sign of\r\nale-houses throughout the country was the head of Wilkes.  They were\r\nindifferent to the fact that Wilkes had come to be regarded in all\r\ndirections as the champion of popular liberty.  All they knew, all that\r\nthey cared to know, was that Wilkes was in exile, and was like enough\r\nto die in exile.  Even the success of \"The Beggar's Opera\" taught them\r\nnothing, and yet the success of \"The Beggar's Opera\" was a significant\r\nlesson.  \"The Beggar's Opera\" was revived at Covent Garden while the\r\nexcitement about Wilkes was at its height, and its audiences were as\r\nready to read in political allusions between the lines as they had been\r\nat the time of its first production.  The line \"That Jemmy Twitcher\r\nshould peach on me I own rather surprises me\" was converted at once\r\ninto an innuendo at the expense of Lord Sandwich, to whom the name\r\nJemmy Twitcher was immediately applied by the public at large, almost\r\nto the disuse, so Horace Walpole tells us, of his own title.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1764--Death of Hogarth and Churchill]\r\n\r\nBut the Ministry had so far triumphed that for four years Wilkes\r\nremained away from England, drifting from one foreign capital to\r\nanother, making friends and winning admirers everywhere, and employing\r\nhis enforced leisure in attempting great feats of literary enterprise.\r\nA scheme for a Constitutional History of England was succeeded by a no\r\nless difficult and, as it proved, no less impracticable scheme.  During\r\nWilkes's exile he lost the most famous of his enemies and the most\r\nfamous of his friends.  On October 26, 1764, Hogarth died.  It was\r\ncommonly said, and generally credited, that he died of a broken heart\r\n{69} in consequence of the furious attacks which had followed upon his\r\nunhappy quarrel with Wilkes.  It was a pity that the closing hours of\r\nHogarth's life should have been occupied with so petty and so\r\nregrettable a squabble.  Hogarth was entirely in the wrong.  Hogarth\r\nbegan the quarrel; and if Hogarth was eager to give hard knocks he\r\nshould have been ready to take hard knocks in return.  But the world at\r\nlarge may very well be glad that Hogarth did lurk in the court by\r\nJustice Pratt and did make his memorable sketch of Wilkes.  The sketch\r\nserves to show us if not what Wilkes exactly was, at least what Wilkes\r\nseemed to be to a great many of his countrymen.  The caricaturist is a\r\npriceless commentator.  If Hogarth indeed indirectly shortened his life\r\nby his portrait of Wilkes, he gave, as if by transfusion of blood, an\r\nincreased and abiding vitality to certain of the most interesting pages\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days of Hogarth, Churchill died.  His devotion to Wilkes\r\nprompted him to join him in his Continental banishment.  He got as far\r\nas Boulogne, where Wilkes met him, and at Boulogne he died of a fever,\r\nafter formally naming Wilkes as his literary executor.  Wilkes, who was\r\nalways prompted by generous impulses, immediately resolved that he\r\nwould edit a collected edition of Churchill's works, and for a time he\r\nburied himself in seclusion in Naples with the firm intention of\r\ncarrying out this purpose.  But the task was too great both for the man\r\nand for the conditions under which he was compelled to work.  In the\r\nfirst place, annotations of such poems as Churchill's required constant\r\nreference to and minute acquaintance with home affairs, such as it was\r\nwell-nigh impossible for an exile to command.  In the second place, it\r\nwas not an easy task for a man even with a very high opinion of himself\r\nto play the part of editor and annotator of poems a great part of which\r\nhad him for hero.  In a very short time the work was abandoned, and\r\nWilkes emerged from his literary retreat.\r\n\r\nWilkes has been very bitterly and, as it would appear, very unjustly\r\nupbraided for his seeming neglect of his dead friend's wishes, of his\r\ndead defender's fame.  In spite of {70} those whose zeal for the memory\r\nof Churchill drives them into antagonism with the memory of Wilkes, it\r\nmay be believed that the task was not one \"for which Wilkes could, with\r\nthe greatest ease, have procured all the necessary materials; and to\r\nwhich he was called not by the sacred duties of friendship only, but by\r\nthe plainest considerations of even the commonest gratitude.\"  Even if\r\nWilkes had been, which Wilkes was not, the kind of a man to make a good\r\neditor, a good annotator, the difficulties that lay in the way of the\r\nexecution of his task were too many.  The fact that the poems were so\r\nlargely about himself gave a sufficient if not an almost imperative\r\nreason why he should leave the task alone.  But in any case he must\r\nhave felt conscious of what events proved, that there was other work\r\nfor him to do in the world than the editing of other men's satires.\r\n\r\nNot, indeed, that the genius of Churchill needed any tribute that\r\nWilkes or any one else could bestow.  His monument is in his own\r\nverses, in the story of his life.  If indeed the lines from \"The\r\nCandidate\" which are inscribed on Churchill's tombstone tell the truth,\r\nif indeed his life was \"to the last enjoyed,\" part of that enjoyment\r\nmay well have come from the certainty that the revolutions of time\r\nwould never quite efface his name or obscure his memory.  The\r\nimmortality of the satirist must almost inevitably be an immortality\r\nrather historical than artistic; it is rather what he says than how he\r\nsays it which is accounted unto him for good.  As there are passages of\r\ngreat poetic beauty in the satires of Juvenal, so there are passages of\r\npoetic beauty in the satires of Churchill.  But they are both\r\nremembered, the great Roman and the great Englishman, less for what\r\nbeauty their work permitted than for the themes on which they exercised\r\ntheir wit.  The study of Churchill is as essential to a knowledge of\r\nthe eighteenth century in London as the study of Juvenal is essential\r\nto a knowledge of the Rome of his time.  That fame Churchill had\r\nsecured for himself; to that fame nothing that Wilkes or any one else\r\nmight do could add.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{71}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN COLONIES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--Grenville as Bute's successor]\r\n\r\nWilkes in exile had ceased to exist in the minds of the King's\r\nMinistry.  In Naples or in Paris he was as little to be feared as\r\nChurchill in his grave.  An insolent subject had presumed directly to\r\nattack the King's advisers and indirectly the King himself, and the\r\ninsolent subject was a fugitive, a broken, powerless man.  The young\r\nKing might well be pleased with the success of his policy.  In\r\npursuance of that policy he had reduced the great fabric of the Whig\r\nparty to a ruin, and had driven the factious demagogue who opposed him\r\ninto an ignominious obscurity.  To a temper flushed by two such\r\ntriumphs opposition of any kind was well-nigh welcome for the pleasure\r\nof crushing it, and was never less likely to be encountered in a spirit\r\nof conciliation.  Yet the King was destined in the very glow of his\r\nsuccess to find himself face to face with an opposition which he was\r\nnot able to crush, and on which any attempt at conciliation was but so\r\nmuch waste of time.  The King's new and formidable opponent was his own\r\nchief minister.\r\n\r\nWhen Bute, perhaps in fear for his life, perhaps in despair at his\r\nunpopularity, resigned the office he filled so ill, he hoped to find in\r\nhis successor Grenville a supple and responsive creature, through whom\r\nBute would still be as powerful as before.  Bute had to taste a bitter\r\ndisappointment.  Grenville's gloomy spirit and narrow mind unfitted\r\nhim, indeed, for the office he was called upon to hold, but they\r\nafforded him a stubbornness which declined to recognize either the\r\nauthority of the favorite or the authority of the favorite's master.\r\nBy the time that Grenville had been two years in office the King hated\r\nhim as {72} bitterly as he had ever hated Pitt.  If Bute was impotently\r\nfurious to find himself discarded and despised by his intended tool,\r\nthe King was still more exasperated to find that the King's servant\r\nproposed to be the King's master.  Grenville was a good lawyer and a\r\ngood man of business, but he was extremely dull and extremely tactless,\r\nand he was at as much pains to offend the King as if he intended\r\noffence.  He was overbearing in manner to a monarch who was himself\r\noverbearing; he badgered him with long rambling discourses upon his\r\nroyal duty; he deliberately wounded him in his two warmest affections,\r\nhis love for his mother and his regard for Bute.  Grenville was right\r\nenough in his objection to the undue influence of Bute, but his\r\nanimadversions came with a bad grace from the man who was to do as much\r\nharm to England as Bute had ever done.  As Grenville had triumphed over\r\nBute and driven him into the background, so he wished to triumph over\r\nthe Princess Dowager and deprive her of power.  In 1765 the King fell\r\nill for the first time of that malady from which he was to suffer so\r\noften and so heavily.  As soon as he was restored to health he proposed\r\nthe introduction of a Regency Bill to settle satisfactorily the\r\ndifficulties that might very well arise if the heir to the throne were\r\nto succeed before the age of eighteen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--The King seeks to remove Grenville]\r\n\r\nGrenville acted in the matter of the Regency Bill as if the dearest\r\nwish of his heart were to flout the King's wishes and to wound his\r\nfeelings.  The King wished, lest he should again be stricken with\r\nillness while the heir-apparent was still an infant, to be given the\r\nright to name a regent by will.  Grenville and Grenville's colleagues,\r\nwho were now as jealous of the authority of Bute as any subscriber to\r\nthe _North Briton_, saw or professed to see in the King's proposal an\r\ninsidious scheme for placing little less than royal power within the\r\nreach of the favorite.  They made it impossible for the King to name\r\nBute by limiting his choice to the members of the royal family.  But\r\nthey went further than this in affronting the King.  They limited his\r\nchoice of a regent to members of the royal family, but they also\r\nlimited the number of {73} members of the royal family from whom he\r\nmight make his choice.  They insisted that the name of the King's\r\nmother, of the Princess Dowager, should not be included in the Bill.\r\nIt is difficult to understand how the King could ever have been induced\r\nto consent to this peculiarly galling insult.  It seems that Grenville\r\nassured him, on entirely false premises, that if her name were\r\nmentioned in the Bill the House of Commons would be certain to strike\r\nit out.  Preferring the private to the public affront, George\r\nsurrendered to his minister, only to find that his minister was\r\nflagrantly misinformed.  The friends of the Princess in the House of\r\nCommons moved that her name should be written into the Bill, and they\r\ncarried their point in Grenville's teeth.  Grenville had played the\r\ntyrant and George had accepted the humiliation for nothing.  George\r\ntried at once to overthrow Grenville.  In those days a king who\r\ndisliked a minister had a very simple and easy way of showing and of\r\ngratifying his dislike.  He could dismiss his minister without ceremony\r\nand without question.  Nowadays a minister depends for his power and\r\ntenure of office upon the majority in the House of Commons, and a\r\nsovereign would not think of dismissing a minister, or of doing\r\nanything else than accepting formally the decision of the House of\r\nCommons.  But when George the Third was king the only check upon the\r\nroyal power of dismissing a minister lay in the possible difficulty of\r\nfinding another to take his place.  This was the check George now met.\r\nHe wanted with all his heart to dismiss Grenville.  He turned to\r\nCumberland of Culloden, and implored him to bring back Pitt and enable\r\nhim to get rid of Grenville.  Cumberland tried and Cumberland failed.\r\nPitt was in one of those paroxysms of illness which seem to have\r\ncompletely overmastered him.  He was almost entirely under the\r\ninfluence of Temple.  Temple's detestation of Bute reconciled him to\r\nGrenville's policy when he found that Grenville seemed to share that\r\ndetestation.  Temple persuaded Pitt to refuse.  Cumberland came back to\r\nthe King to tell of his failure.  There was nothing to be done.\r\nGrenville had to be kept on.  If the enforced association {74} did not\r\nmake the sovereign and his minister better friends, if both smarted\r\nunder a sense of humiliation and defeat, it is scarcely surprising that\r\nthe stubbornness of both was intensified in cases where their\r\nstubbornness was pitted not against each other, but against a common\r\nobstacle.  Such a case was then in existence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--The American colonies]\r\n\r\nThree thousand miles away the wealth and power of England was\r\nrepresented by a number of settlements occupying a comparatively narrow\r\nstrip of territory on the Atlantic seaboard of the North American\r\ncontinent.  The American colonies were the proudest possessions of the\r\nBritish Empire.  Through generation after generation, for more than two\r\ncenturies, English daring and English courage had built up those\r\ncolonies, reclaiming them from the wilderness and the swamp, wresting\r\nthem from wild man and wild beast, fighting for them with European\r\npower after European power.  They were a source of wealth, a source of\r\nhonor, and a source of strength to England.  They were cheaply bought\r\nwith the brave lives that had been given for them.  It is hard to\r\nrealize that any sovereign, that any statesman could fail to see how\r\nprecious a possession they were, or how unwise any course of action\r\nmust be which could tend in any way to lessen their affection or to\r\nalienate their support.  Yet such a sovereign was upon the throne and\r\nsuch a minister was by his side.\r\n\r\nMr. Willett, senior, in \"Barnaby Rudge,\" explains to his friends that\r\nhis absent son Joe is away in \"the Salwanners in America, where the war\r\nis.\"  Mr. Willett's knowledge and appreciation of the American colonies\r\nrepresents pretty well for profundity and accuracy the knowledge and\r\nappreciation of the majority of the English people in the times\r\ncontemporary with, and indeed long subsequent to, the quarrels between\r\nthe old country and the new.  To the bulk of the British people America\r\nwas a vague and shadowy region, a sort of no-man's land, peopled for\r\nthe most part with black men and red men, and dimly associated with\r\nsugar-planting and the tobacco trade.  Its distance alone made it seem\r\nsufficiently unreal to those whose way of life was not drawn by\r\nbusiness or {75} by politics into association with its inhabitants.\r\nThe voyage to America was a grimly serious adventure, calling for\r\nfortitude and triple brass.  The man was indeed lucky who could make\r\nthe passage from shore to shore in six weeks of stormy sea, and the\r\njourney generally took a much longer time, and under the same\r\nconditions of discomfort and of danger that attended on the voyage of\r\nthe \"Mayflower.\"  The vast majority of Englishmen concerned themselves\r\nas little with America as they concerned themselves with Hindostan.\r\nBoth were British possessions, and as such important, but both were too\r\nfar away to assume any very substantial reality in the consciousness of\r\nthe bulk of the English people.  Of the minority who did possess\r\nanything that can be called knowledge of the American colonies, the\r\nmajority imbibed its information from official sources, from the\r\nreports of governors of provinces and official servants of the Crown.\r\nThese reports were for the most part as reliable for a basis on which\r\nto build an intelligent appreciation as the legends of the Algonquins\r\nor the myths of the Six Nations.\r\n\r\nIf the English knowledge of the American colonies had been a little\r\nmore precise it would have run to this effect.  The colonies of the New\r\nEngland region were mainly peopled by a hardy, industrious, sober,\r\nfrugal race, still strongly Puritanical in profession and in practice,\r\nand knowing but little of the extremes of fortune.  Neither great\r\npoverty nor great wealth was common among those sturdy farmers, who\r\ntended their own farms, tilled their own land, lived upon their own\r\nproduce, and depended for their clothing and for most of the\r\nnecessaries of life upon the work of their own hands.  A slender\r\npopulation was scattered far asunder in lonely townships and straggling\r\nvillages of wooden houses, built for the most part in the formidable\r\nfashion imposed upon men who might at any time have to resist the\r\nattacks of Indians.  Inside these villages the rough, rude justice of\r\nthe Puritan days still persisted.  The stocks and the pillory and the\r\nstool of repentance were things of the present.  A shrewish housewife\r\nmight still be made to stand at her cottage door with {76} the iron gag\r\nof the scold fastened upon her shameful face.  A careless Sabbatarian\r\nmight still find himself exposed to the scorn of a congregation, with\r\nthe words \"A wanton gospeller\" placarded upon his ignominious breast.\r\nInside those wooden houses a rude simplicity and a rough plenty\r\nprevailed.  The fare was simple; the labor was hard; simple fare and\r\nstern labor between them reared a stalwart, God-fearing race.  Its\r\npositive pleasures were few and primitive.  Husking-bees, quiltings, a\r\nrare dance, filled up the measure of its diversions.  But the summer\r\nsmiled upon those steadfast, earnest, rigorous citizens, and in the\r\nwild and bitter winters each household would gather about the cheerful\r\nfire in the great chimney which in some of those cottages formed the\r\nmajor part of the building, and find content and peace in quiet talk\r\nand in tales of the past, of the French and Indian wars, and of their\r\nancestors, long ago, in old England.  Those same great fires that were\r\nthe joy of winter were also one of its troubles.  Once lit, with all\r\nthe difficulty attendant upon flint and steel and burnt rag, they had\r\nto be kept alight from morning till night and from night till morning.\r\nIf a fire went out it was a woful business to start it again with the\r\nreluctant tinder-box.  There was, indeed, another way, an easier way,\r\nof going round to a neighbor and borrowing a shovelful of hot embers\r\nwherewith to kindle the blackened hearth.  But in villages built for\r\nthe most part of wood this might well be regarded as a dangerous\r\nprocess.  So the law did regard it, and to start a fire in this lazy,\r\nlounging fashion was penalized as sternly as any breach of the Sabbath\r\nor of public decorum, and these were sternly punished.  Drunkenness was\r\ngrimly frowned down.  Only decent, God-fearing men were allowed to keep\r\ntaverns, and the names of persons who had earned the reputation of\r\nintemperance were posted up in those taverns as a warning to the host\r\nthat he should sell such men no liquor.  In Connecticut tobacco was\r\nforbidden to any one under twenty years of age, unless on the express\r\norder of a physician.  Those who were over twenty were only allowed to\r\nsmoke once a day, and then not within ten miles of any dwelling.\r\n\r\n{77}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--American colonial customs]\r\n\r\nIn spite of their democratic simplicity, even the New England colonists\r\nhad their distinctions of rank as clearly marked as among the people of\r\nold England.  The gentry dressed in one fashion; the working classes\r\ndressed in another.  The family rank of students determined their\r\nplaces in the lists of Harvard College and Yale College.  In Boston,\r\nthe chief New England town, life was naturally more elaborate and more\r\nluxurious than in the country places.  Ladies wore fine clothes and\r\nsought to be modish in the London manner; gentlemen made a brave show\r\nin gayly colored silks and rich laces, gold-headed canes and costly\r\nsnuff-boxes.  Even in Boston, however, life was simpler, quieter, and\r\nsweeter than it was across the Atlantic; there was Puritanism in its\r\natmosphere--Puritanism and the serenity of learning, of scholarship, of\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThere was much more wealth in the province of New York; there was much\r\nmore display in the southern colonies.  New York was as famous for its\r\nDutch cleanliness and its Dutch comfort as for its Dutch windmills that\r\ntwirled their sails against the sky in all directions.  There was store\r\nof plate and fine linen in New York cupboards.  There were good things\r\nto eat and drink in New York households.  Down South the gentlefolk\r\nlived as gentlefolk lived in England, with perhaps a more lavish\r\nostentation, a more liberal hospitality.  They loved horses and dogs,\r\nhorse-racing and fox-hunting, dancing, music, high living, all things\r\nthat added to the enjoyment of life.  Their servants were their own\r\nblack slaves.  The great city of the South was Charleston, the third of\r\nthe colonial cities.  The fourth and last was Philadelphia, the \"faire\r\ngreene country town\" of Penn's love, the last in our order, but the\r\nfirst in size and splendor, with its flagged sidewalks that had made it\r\nfamous throughout the American continent as if it had been one of the\r\nseven wonders of the world, with its stately houses of brick and stone,\r\nits avenues of trees, its fruitful orchards and sweet-smelling gardens.\r\nThe people of Philadelphia had every right to be proud of their city.\r\n\r\nCommunication was not easy between one colony and {78} another, between\r\none town and another.  But neither was it easy in England.  For the\r\nmost part the conditions of life were much the same on one side of the\r\nAtlantic as on the other.  The whole population, white and black,\r\nfreeman and slave, was about two million souls.  They were well-to-do,\r\npeaceable, hard-working--those who had to work, good fighters--those\r\nwho had to fight, all very willing to be loyal and all very well worth\r\nkeeping loyal.  It was worth their sovereign's while, it was worth the\r\nwhile of his ministers, to know something about these colonists and to\r\ntry and understand natures that were not at all difficult to\r\nunderstand.  Had they been treated as the Englishmen they were, all\r\nwould have been well.  But the King who gloried in the name of Briton\r\ndid not extend its significance far enough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--Friction with the American colonists]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to understand the temper which animated all the King's\r\nactions towards the American colonies.  They were regarded, and with\r\njustice, as one of the greatest glories of the English crown; they were\r\nno less a source of wealth than of pride to the English people.  Yet\r\nthe English prince persisted in pursuing towards them a policy which\r\ncan only be most mildly characterized as a policy of exasperation.\r\nWhen George was still both a young man and a young king, the relations\r\nbetween the mother country and her children across the Atlantic were,\r\nif not wholly harmonious, at least in such a condition as to render\r\nharmony not merely possible, but probable.  The result of a long and\r\nwearing war had been to relieve the colonists directly from one and\r\nindirectly from the other of their two greatest perils.  By the terms\r\non which peace was made the power of France was broken on the North\r\nAmerican continent.  The French troops had been withdrawn across the\r\nseas.  The Lilies of France floated over no more important possessions\r\nin the new world than a few insignificant fishing stations near\r\nNewfoundland.  A dangerous and dreaded enemy to colonial life and\r\nliberty could no longer menace or alarm.  As a consequence of the\r\nwithdrawal of the French troops the last united attack of the red men\r\nagainst the white was made and failed.  {79} The famous conspiracy of\r\nPontiac was the desperate attempt of the Indian allies of France to\r\nannihilate the colonists by a concerted attack of a vast union of\r\ntribes.  The conspiracy failed after a bloody war that lasted for\r\nnearly two years.  Pontiac, the Indian chief who had helped to destroy\r\nBraddock, and who had dreamed that all the English might as easily be\r\ndestroyed, was defeated and killed; his league was dissipated, and the\r\npower of the red men as a united force broken for good.  Under such\r\nconditions of immunity from long-standing and pressing perils, due in\r\nthe main to the triumph of British arms, the colonists might very well\r\nhave been expected to regard with especial favor their association with\r\nEngland.  If there had been differences between the two countries for\r\nlong enough, no moment could have been apter for the adoption of a\r\npolicy calculated to lessen and ultimately to abolish those differences\r\nthan the moment when the weary and wearing Seven Years' War came to its\r\nclose.  A far-seeing monarch, advised and encouraged by far-seeing\r\nstatesmen, might have soldered close the seeming impossibilities and\r\nmade them kiss.  Had the throne even been filled by a sovereign\r\nslightly less stubborn, had the throne been surrounded by servants\r\nslightly less bigoted, the arrogant patronage of the one part and the\r\naggressive protestation of the other part might have been judiciously\r\nsoftened into a relationship wisely paternal and loyally filial.  The\r\nadvantage of an enduring union between the mother country and her\r\ncolonies was obvious to any reasonable observer.  A common blood, a\r\ncommon tongue, a common pride of race and common interests should have\r\nkept them together.  But the relations were not amicable.  The colonies\r\nwere peopled by men who were proud indeed of being Englishmen, but by\r\nreason of that very pride were jealous of any domination, even at the\r\nhands of Englishmen.  The mother country, on the other hand, regarded\r\nthe colonies, won with English hands and watered with English blood, as\r\nbeing no less portion and parcel of English soil because three thousand\r\nmiles of stormy ocean lay between the port upon the Severn and the port\r\nupon {80} the Charles River.  She came to regard as mere ingratitude\r\nthose assertions of independence which most characteristically proved\r\nthe colonies to be worthy of it and of her.  The theory of the absolute\r\ndominion of England over the American colonies might have died a\r\nnatural death, a harmonious settlement of grievances and adjustment of\r\npowers might have knitted the two peoples together in an enduring\r\nleague, if it had not been for George the Third.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--England and her colonial governors]\r\n\r\nThe mind of George the Third was saturated with a belief in his\r\npersonal importance; the heart of George the Third was exalted by the\r\ndetermination to play a dominating part in the country of his birth and\r\nthe history of his reign.  The hostility to the exercise of home\r\nauthority latent in the colonies irritated the King like a personal\r\naffront.  To resist or to resent the authority of the Government of\r\nEngland was to resist and to resent the authority of the sovereign who\r\nwas determined that he would be to all intents and purposes the\r\nGovernment of England.  If the relationship between England and America\r\nhad been far happier than George found it at the time of his accession,\r\nit probably would not long have preserved a wholesome tenor.  But the\r\nrelationship was by no means happy.  The colonial assemblies were for\r\nthe most part at loggerheads with the colonial governors.  These\r\ngovernors, little viceroys with petty courts, extremely proud of their\r\npower and self-conscious in their authority, generally detested the\r\npopular assemblies upon whom they were obliged to depend for the\r\npayment of their salaries.  Their dislike found secret expression in\r\nthe letters which it was the duty and the pleasure of the colonial\r\ngovernors to address to the Home Government.  The system of colonial\r\nadministration in England was as simple as it was unsatisfactory.  At\r\nits head was a standing committee of the Privy Council which had been\r\nestablished in 1675.  This committee was known at length as \"The Lords\r\nof the Committee of Trade and Plantations,\" and in brief and more\r\ngenerally as \"The Lords of Trade.\"  It was the duty of the colonial\r\ngovernors to make lengthy reports to the Lords of Trade on the {81}\r\ncommercial and other conditions of their governorships.  It was too\r\noften their pleasure to supplement these State papers with lengthy and\r\nembittered private letters, addressed to the same body, making the very\r\nmost and worst of the difficulties they had to deal with in their work.\r\nThe colonies, as represented in these semi-official communications,\r\nwere turbulent, contumacious, discontented, disrespectful to viceregal\r\ndignity, rebellious against the authority of Great Britain.  These\r\ncommunications informed the minds of the Lords of Trade, who in their\r\nturn influenced those who were responsible for the conduct of the\r\nKing's Government.  Thus a vicious system, acting in a vicious circle,\r\nkept alive an irritation and fostered a friction that only increased\r\nwith the increasing years.  It had always been the worst feature of\r\nEngland's colonial policy that she was ever ready to accept with too\r\nlittle question the animadversions of the governors upon the governed.\r\nThe Lords of Trade accepted the communications of the colonial\r\ngovernors as gospel truth, and as gospel truth it was taken in its turn\r\nby the ministers to whom it was transmitted and by the monarch to whom\r\nthey carried it.  The general public were as ignorant of and as\r\nindifferent to the American colonies as if they were situated in the\r\nmountains of the moon.  The major part of the small minority that\r\nreally did seek or desire information about America gained it from the\r\nsame poisonous sources that inspired the Government, and based their\r\ntheories of colonial reform upon the peevish epistles, often mendacious\r\nand always one-sided, which fed the intelligences of the Lords of\r\nTrade.  The few who were really well informed, who had something like\r\nas accurate an appreciation of the colony of Massachusetts as they had\r\nof the county of Middlesex, were powerless to counteract the general\r\nignorance and the more particular misconception.  It was the cherished\r\ndream of authority in England to bring the colonies into one common\r\nrule under one head in such a way as to strengthen their military force\r\nwhile it lessened their legislative independence.  It now seemed as if\r\nwith the right King and the right Ministry {82} this dream might become\r\na reality.  In George the Third and in George Grenville prerogative\r\nseemed to have found the needed instruments to subjugate the American\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--Trade restrictions upon the colonies]\r\n\r\nMany of the grievances of the colonies were grave enough.  If some of\r\nthe injuries that England inflicted upon her great dependency seem\r\npetty in the enumeration, a number of small causes of irritation are no\r\nless dangerous to peace between nations than some great injustice.  But\r\nlest the small stings should not be enough, the Government was resolved\r\nthat the great injustice should not be wanting.  The colonists resented\r\nthe intermittent tyranny and the persistent truculence of the most part\r\nof the royal governors.  The colonists resented the enforced\r\ntransportation of criminals.  The colonists resented the action of\r\nGreat Britain in annulling the colonial laws made to keep out slaves.\r\nIt is melancholy to reflect that the curse of slavery, for which\r\nEnglishmen of later days often so bitterly and so rightly reproached\r\nAmerica, was unhappily enforced upon a country struggling to be rid of\r\nit by Englishmen who called themselves English statesmen.  The\r\ncolonists resented the astonishing restrictions which it pleased the\r\nmother country to place, in what she believed to be her own interest,\r\nupon colonial trade.  These laws commanded that all trade between the\r\ncolonies should be carried on in ships built in England or the\r\ncolonies.  This barred out all foreigners, especially the Dutch, then\r\nthe chief carriers for Europe.  They compelled the American farmer to\r\nsend his products across the ocean to England.  They forbade the\r\nexportation of sugar, tobacco, cotton, wool, indigo, ginger,\r\ndyeing-woods to any part of the world except to England or some English\r\ncolony.  They only allowed exportation of fish, fur, oil, ashes, and\r\nlumber in ships built in England or the colonies.  They forced the\r\ncolonists to buy all their European goods in England and bring them\r\nover to America in English vessels.  They prohibited the colonial\r\nmanufacture of any article that could be manufactured in England.  They\r\nharassed and minimized the trade between one colony and another.  No\r\n{83} province was permitted to send woollen goods, hats, or ironware to\r\nanother province.  Some of the regulations read more like the rules of\r\nsome Turkish pashalik than the laws framed by one set of Englishmen for\r\nanother set of Englishmen.  In the Maine woods, for instance, no tree\r\nthat had a diameter greater than two feet at a foot above the ground\r\ncould be cut down, except to make a mast for some ship of the Royal\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nBad and bitter as these laws were in theory, they did not for long\r\nenough prove to be so bad in practice, for the simple reason that they\r\nwere very easy to evade and not very easy to enforce.  The colonists\r\nmet what many of them regarded as an elaborate system for the\r\nrestriction of colonial trade by a no less elaborate system of\r\nsmuggling.  Smuggling was easy because of the long extent of sea-coast.\r\nSmuggling was lucrative, as few considered it an offence to evade laws\r\nthat were generally resented as unfair.  When the Sugar Act of 1733\r\nprohibited the importation of sugar and molasses from the French West\r\nIndies except on payment of a prohibitory duty, the New England\r\ncolonists, who did a thriving trade in the offspring of the union of\r\nsugar and molasses, rum, found themselves faced by a serious problem.\r\nShould they accept the Act and its consequential ruin of their trade or\r\nignore it, and by resorting to smuggling prosper as before?  Without\r\nhesitation they decided that their rights as Englishmen were assailed\r\nby the obnoxious imposition, and they turned to smuggling with the\r\nlight heart that is conscious of a heavy purse.  The contraband trade\r\nwas brisk, the contrabandists cheerful, and so long as England made no\r\nserious attempt to put into operation laws that the genial and\r\nbusiness-like smugglers of the Atlantic sea-coast regarded as\r\npreposterous nobody complained, and international relations were\r\ncordial.  But the situation was not seen with so bright an eye by the\r\nBritish merchant.  He witnessed with indignation the failure of the\r\nattempt to monopolize the commerce of the colonies to his own\r\nadvantage, and he clamored for the restoration of his fat monopoly.\r\nHis clamor was unheeded while the great war {84} was running its\r\ncourse.  But with the end of the war and the new conditions consequent\r\nupon the advent of a new King with a brand-new theory of kingship and\r\nprerogative, the situation began to change.\r\n\r\nThe colonial policy of George Grenville's Administration might be\r\nconveniently considered under three heads.  The Ministry was resolved,\r\nin the first place, to enforce Acts of Trade which smuggling had long\r\nrendered meaningless in the American colonies.  The Ministry was\r\nresolved, in the second place, to establish a permanent garrison of\r\nsome ten thousand men in America.  The Ministry was resolved, in the\r\nthird place, to make the colonists pay a third of the cost of keeping\r\nup this garrison by a direct taxation.  It was easy enough for\r\nGrenville to formulate the three ministerial purposes, but it was not\r\nvery easy to give them any effect.  The colonists resented and the\r\ncolonists resisted all three proposals.  If they were technically wrong\r\nin their resentment at the enforcement of the Acts of Trade, they were\r\nreasonable in their reluctance to accept the proposed garrison, and\r\nthey were justified by every law of liberty and of patriotism in\r\nresisting with all the strength at their command the proposed scheme of\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--James Otis and John Adams]\r\n\r\nThe English Government began its task by a rigorous attempt to enforce\r\nthe Acts of Trade.  Grenville had made up his narrow mind that the\r\ncolonies should be compelled to adhere to the conditions which obliged\r\nthem to trade with England only for England's principal manufactures.\r\nThere should be no more smuggling from Spanish America, no more\r\nsmuggling from the West Indies.  To enforce this determination, which\r\ndeprived the colonists at a blow of the most profitable part of their\r\ntrade, the Government employed certain general search warrants, which,\r\nif strictly legal in the letter, were conceived in a spirit highly\r\ncalculated to goad a proud people into illegal defiance.  They goaded\r\none proud man into active protest.  A distinguished servant of the\r\nGovernment, James Otis, the King's Advocate, resigned his office in\r\norder that he might be at liberty to denounce the Writs of Assistance.\r\n{85} Otis may have been technically wrong in resisting the Writs of\r\nAssistance, but it can scarcely be questioned that as a philosophic\r\npolitician, who was devoted to the interests of his countrymen, he was\r\nethically in the right.  Otis was thirty-six years old; he was known to\r\nhis compatriots as a graduate of Harvard, an able lawyer, a zealous\r\nstudent of classical literature, and an author of repute on Latin\r\nprosody.  The issue of the Writs of Assistance converted the respected\r\nand respectable public servant into a conspicuous statesman as hotly\r\napplauded by the one side as he was execrated by the other.  A single\r\nspeech lifted him from an esteemed obscurity to a leading place among\r\nthe champions of colonial rights against imperial aggressions.  The\r\nassemblage which Otis addressed, which Otis dominated, was forever\r\nmemorable in the history of America.  \"Otis was a flame of fire.\"  The\r\nwords are the words of one who was a young man when Otis spoke, who\r\nlistened and took notes as the words fell from Otis's lips.  \"With a\r\npromptitude of classical allusions, a depth of research, a rapid\r\nsummary of historical events and dates, a profusion of legal\r\nauthorities, a prophetic glance of his eyes into futurity, and a rapid\r\ntorrent of tempestuous eloquence, he hurried away all before him.  Then\r\nand there was the first scene of the first act of opposition to the\r\narbitrary claims of Great Britain.  Then and there the child\r\nIndependence was born.  Every man of an immense crowded audience\r\nappeared to me to go away as I did, ready to take up arms against Writs\r\nof Assistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth who took notes of the words of Otis, and who was inspired by\r\nthem with the desire to rise and mutiny, was destined to play even a\r\ngreater part in the history of his country.  If Otis was one of the\r\nfirst to assert actively, by deed as well as by word, the determination\r\nof the colonies to oppose and, if needs were, to defy the domination of\r\nEngland, John Adams was the first to applaud his action and to\r\nappreciate its importance.  In 1763 John Adams was no more than a\r\npromising young lawyer who had struggled from poverty and hardship to\r\nregard and authority, and who had wrested from iron Fortune a great\r\n{86} deal of learning if very little of worldly wealth.  Short of\r\nstature, sanguine of temperament, the ruddy, stubborn, passionate small\r\nman had fought his way step by step from the most modest if not the\r\nmost humble beginnings, as zealously as if he had known of the fame\r\nthat was yet to be his and the honor that he was to give to his name\r\nand hand down to a long line of honorable descendants.  If the\r\nministers who weakly encouraged or meanly obeyed King George in his\r\nfrenzy against America could have understood even dimly the temper of a\r\nrace that was rich in sons of whom John Adams was but one and not the\r\nmost illustrious even to them, there must have come dimly some\r\nconsciousness of the forces they had to encounter, and the peril of\r\ntheir policy.  But the Ministry knew nothing of Adams, and knew only of\r\nOtis as a mutinous and meddlesome official.  Otis and his protest\r\nsignified nothing to them, and they would have smiled to learn that\r\nyoung Mr. Adams, the lawyer, believed that American independence was\r\nborn when Mr. Otis's oration against Writs of Assistance breathed into\r\nthe colonies the breath of life that was to make them a nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--Taxation without representation]\r\n\r\nIf Otis voiced and Adams echoed the feelings of the colonists against\r\nWrits of Assistance and the enforcement of the Acts of Trade, they\r\nmight no less eloquently have interpreted the general irritation at the\r\nproposed establishment of a permanent garrison on the continent.  The\r\ncolonists saw no need of such a garrison so late in the day.  When the\r\nFrenchmen held the field, when the red man was on the war path, then\r\nindeed the presence of more British soldiers might have become welcome.\r\nBut the flag of France no longer floated over strong places, no longer\r\nfluttered at the head of invasion.  The strength of the savage was\r\ncrippled if not crushed.  The colonists had nothing to fear from the\r\none and little to fear from the other foe.  They thought that they had\r\nmuch to fear from the presence of a British garrison of ten thousand\r\nmen.  This British garrison might, on occasion, be used not in defence\r\nof their liberties, but in diminution of their liberties.  The\r\nirritation against the proposed garrison might have {87} smouldered out\r\nif it had not been fanned into a leaping flame by the means proposed\r\nfor the maintenance of the garrison.  Grenville proposed to raise\r\none-third of the cost of support from the colonies by taxation.  No\r\nproposal could have been better calculated to goad every colony and\r\nevery colonist into resistance, and to fuse the scattered elements of\r\nresistance into a solid whole.  More than two generations earlier both\r\nMassachusetts and New York had formally denied the right of the Home\r\nGovernment to levy any tax upon the American colonies.  The colonies\r\nwere not represented at Westminster--could not, under the conditions,\r\nbe represented at Westminster.  The theory that there should be no\r\ntaxation without representation was as dear to the American for America\r\nas it was dear to the Englishman for England.  Successive English\r\nGovernments, forced in times of financial pressure wistfully to eye\r\nAmerican prosperity, had dreamed, and only dreamed, of raising money by\r\ntaxing the well-to-do colonies.  It was reserved to the Government\r\nheaded by Grenville, in its madness, to attempt to make the dream a\r\nreality.  It is true that even Grenville did not propose, did not\r\nventure to suggest that the American colonies should be taxed for the\r\ndirect benefit of the English Government.  He brought forward his\r\nscheme of taxation as a benefit to America, as a contribution to the\r\nexpense of keeping up a garrison that was only established in the\r\ninterests of America and for America's welfare.  In this spirit of\r\nbenevolence, and with apparent confidence of success, Grenville brought\r\nforward his famous Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nThere were statesmen in England who saw with scarcely less indignation\r\nthan the Americans themselves, and with even more dismay, the unfolding\r\nof the colonial policy of the Government.  These protested against the\r\nintolerable weight of the duties imposed, and arraigned the folly\r\nwhich, by compelling these duties to be paid in specie, drained away\r\nthe little ready money remaining in the colonies, \"as though the best\r\nway to cure an emaciated body, whose juices happened to be tainted, was\r\nto leave it no juices at all.\"  They assailed the injustice that\r\nrefused {88} to recognize as legal tender any paper bills of credit\r\nissued by the colonies.  Politicians, guided by the intelligence and\r\nthe inspiration of Burke, applauded the Americans for their firmness in\r\nresolving to subsist to the utmost of their power upon their own\r\nproductions and manufactures.  They urged that it could not be expected\r\nthat the colonists, merely out of a compliment to the mother country,\r\nshould submit to perish for thirst with water in their own wells.  And\r\nthese clear-sighted politicians saw plainly enough that such blows as\r\nthe Government were aiming at America must in the end recoil upon Great\r\nBritain herself.  They appreciated the injury that must be done to\r\nBritish commerce by even a temporary interruption of the intercourse\r\nbetween the two countries.  But bad as the restrictive measures were in\r\ntheir immediate, as well as in their ultimate consequences, worse\r\nremained behind.  The proposed Stamp Act scarcely shocked Otis or Adams\r\nmore directly and cruelly than it shocked the soundest and sanest\r\nthinkers on the other side of the Atlantic.  Words which certainly\r\nexpressed the thoughts of Burke declared that the approval, even with\r\nopposition, given to such a measure as the Stamp Act, the bare proposal\r\nof which had given so much offence, argued such a want of reflection as\r\ncould scarcely be paralleled in the public councils of any country.\r\n\r\nThe King's speech at the opening of Parliament on January 10, 1765,\r\ngave unmistakable evidence of the temper of the monarch and of the\r\nMinistry.  It formally expressed its reliance on the wisdom and\r\nfirmness of Parliament in promoting the proper respect and obedience\r\ndue to the legislative authority of Great Britain.  The Government was\r\nresolved to be what it considered firm, and it undoubtedly believed\r\nthat a proper show of firmness would easily overbear any opposition\r\nthat the colonists might make to the proposed measure.  The Stamp Act\r\nwas introduced, the Stamp Act was debated upon; in due time the Stamp\r\nAct passed through both Houses, and in consequence of the ill health of\r\nthe King received the royal assent by commission on March 28, 1765.\r\nThe first foolish challenge to American loyalty was formally made, and\r\n{89} America was not slow to accept it.  It may be admitted that in\r\nitself the Stamp Act was not a conspicuously unfair or even a\r\nconspicuously unreasonable measure.  It was a legitimate and perfectly\r\nfair way of raising money from a taxable people.  It was neither\r\nlegitimate nor fair when imposed upon unrepresented colonists.  But if\r\nit had been the sanest and most statesmanlike scheme for raising money\r\never conceived by a financier, it would have deserved and would have\r\nreceived no less hostility from the American people.  The principle\r\ninvolved was everything.  To admit in any degree the right of Great\r\nBritain to impose at her pleasure a tax upon the colonists was to\r\nsurrender in ignominy the privileges and to betray the duties of free\r\nmen.  Any expectations of colonial protest that the Ministry may have\r\nallowed themselves to entertain were more than fulfilled.  Colony after\r\ncolony, great town after great town, great man after great man, made\r\nhaste to protest with an emphasis that should have been significant\r\nagainst the new measure.  Boston led the way.  Boston's most\r\ndistinguished citizen, Boston's most respected son was the voice not\r\nmerely of his town, not merely of his State, but of the colonial\r\ncontinent.  Ten years later the name of Samuel Adams was known, hated,\r\nand honored on the English side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--Samuel Adams]\r\n\r\nSamuel Adams was one of those men whom Nature forges to be the\r\ninstruments of revolution.  His three-and-forty years had taught him\r\nmuch: the value of silence, the knowledge of men, the desire to change\r\nthe world and the patience to bide his time.  A few generations earlier\r\nhe might have made a right-hand man to Cromwell and held a place in the\r\nheart of Hampden.  On the very threshold of his manhood, when receiving\r\nhis degree of Master of Arts at Harvard, he asserted his defiant\r\ndemocracy in a dissertation on the right of the people of a\r\ncommonwealth to combine against injustice on the part of the head of\r\nthe State.  The badly dressed man with the grave firm face of a Pilgrim\r\nFather was as ready and as resolute to oppose King George as any Pym or\r\nVane had been ready and resolute to oppose Charles Stuart.  He had at\r\none {90} time devoted himself to a commercial career, with no great\r\nsuccess.  He was made for a greater game than commerce; he had the\r\ntemper and he gained the training for a public life, and the hour when\r\nit came found that the man was ready.  When the citizens of Boston met\r\nto protest against the Stamp Act Samuel Adams framed the first\r\nresolutions that denied to the Parliament of Great Britain the right to\r\nimpose taxes upon her colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--The opposition to the Stamp Act]\r\n\r\nIf Massachusetts was the first to protest with no uncertain voice\r\nagainst the Stamp Act, other colonies were prompt to follow her\r\nexample, and to prove that they possessed sons no less patriotic.\r\nVirginia was as vehement and as vigorous in opposition as\r\nMassachusetts.  One speech in the Virginia House of Burgesses made the\r\nname of Patrick Henry famous.  Patrick Henry was a young man who tried\r\nmany things and failed in them before he found in the practice of the\r\nlaw the appointed task for his rare gifts of reasoning and of\r\neloquence.  A speech in Hanover Court House in defence of the people\r\nagainst a suit of the parish clergy gave him sudden fame.  As grave of\r\nface as Samuel Adams, as careless of his attire, tall and lean, stamped\r\nwith the seal of the speaker and the thinker, Patrick Henry at\r\nnine-and-twenty was already a very different man from the youth who\r\nfive years earlier seemed destined to be but a Jack of all trades and\r\nmaster of none, an unsuccessful trader, an unsuccessful farmer, whose\r\nchief accomplishments in life were hunting and fishing, dancing and\r\nriding.  The debate on the Stamp Act gave him a great opportunity.  As\r\nhe addressed his words of warning to the stubborn sovereign across the\r\nsea his passion seemed to get the better of his prudence and to tempt\r\nhim into menace.  \"Caesar,\" he said, \"had his Brutus, Charles the First\r\nhis Cromwell.\"  He was going on to say \"and George the Third,\" when he\r\nwas interrupted by angry cries of \"Treason!\" from the loyalists among\r\nhis hearers.  Patrick Henry waited until the noise subsided, and then\r\nquietly completed his sentence, \"George the Third may profit by their\r\nexample.  If this be treason, make the most of it.\"  The words were not\r\ntreasonable, {91} but they were revolutionary.  They served to carry\r\nthe name of Patrick Henry to every corner of the continent and across\r\nthe Atlantic.  They made him a hero and idol in the eyes of the\r\ncolonists; they made him a rebel in the eyes of the Court at St.\r\nJames's.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts had set an example which Virginia had bettered;\r\nMassachusetts was now to better Virginia.  If Virginia, prompted by\r\nPatrick Henry, declared that she alone had the right to tax her own\r\ncitizens, Massachusetts, inspired by James Otis, summoned a congress of\r\ndeputies from all the colonial assemblies to meet in common\r\nconsultation upon the common danger.  This congress, the first but not\r\nthe last, memorable but not most memorable, met in New York in the\r\nearly November of 1765.  Nine colonies were represented at its\r\ntable--Massachusetts, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York.  The\r\ncongress passed a series of resolutions, as firm in their purpose as\r\nmoderate in their language, putting forward the grievances and\r\nasserting the rights of the colonies.\r\n\r\nBut the protests against the Stamp Act were not limited to eloquent\r\norations or formal resolutions.  Deeds, as well as words, made plain\r\nthe purpose of the American people.  Riots broke out in colony after\r\ncolony; the most and worst in Massachusetts.  Boston blazed into open\r\nrevolt against authority.  There were two Government officials in\r\nBoston who were especially unpopular with the mob--Andrew Oliver, the\r\nnewly appointed collector of the stamp taxes, and Chief Justice\r\nHutchinson.  A scarecrow puppet, intended to represent the obnoxious\r\nOliver, was publicly hung upon a tree by the mob, then cut down,\r\ntriumphantly paraded through the city to Oliver's door, and there set\r\non fire.  When the sham Oliver was ashes the crowd broke into and\r\nransacked his house, after which it did the same turn to the house of\r\nChief Justice Hutchinson.  Oliver and Hutchinson escaped unhurt, but\r\nall their property went through their broken windows and lay in ruin\r\nupon the Boston streets.  Hutchinson was busy upon a History of\r\nMassachusetts; the manuscript shared the fate of its {92} author's\r\nchairs and tables, and went with them out into the gutter.  It was\r\npicked up, preserved, and exists to this day, its pages blackened with\r\nthe Boston mud.  Many papers and records of the province which\r\nHutchinson had in his care for the purpose of his history were\r\nirretrievably lost.\r\n\r\nThe next day the judges and the bar, assembled in their robes at the\r\nBoston Court House, were startled by the apparition of a haggard man in\r\ndisordered attire, whom they might have been pardoned for failing to\r\nrecognize as their familiar chief justice.  In a voice broken with\r\nemotion Hutchinson apologized to the court for the appearance in which\r\nhe presented himself before it.  He and his family were destitute; he\r\nhimself had no other shirt and no other clothes than those he was at\r\nthat moment wearing.  Part even of this poor attire he had been obliged\r\nto borrow.  Almost in rags, almost in tears, he solemnly called his\r\nMaker to witness that he was innocent of the charges that had made him\r\nobnoxious to the fury of the populace.  He swore that he never, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, aided, assisted, or supported, or in the least\r\npromoted or encouraged the Stamp Act, but on the contrary did all in\r\nhis power, and strove as much as in him lay, to prevent it.  The court\r\nlistened to him in melancholy silence and then adjourned, \"on account\r\nof the riotous disorders of the previous night and universal confusion\r\nof the town,\" to a day nearly two months later.\r\n\r\nIt was a thankless privilege to be a stamp officer in those stormy\r\nhours.  Most of the stamp officers were forced to resign under pressure\r\nwhich they might well be excused for finding sufficiently cogent.  In\r\norder to make the new law a dead letter the colonists resolved that\r\nwhile it was in force they would avoid using stamps by substituting\r\narbitration for any kind of legal procedure.  With a people in this\r\ntemper, there were only two things to be done; to meet their wishes, or\r\nto annihilate their opposition.  It is possible that Grenville might\r\nhave preferred to attempt the second alternative, but by this time\r\nGrenville's power was at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{93}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1730-82--Rockingham and his Ministry]\r\n\r\nThe friction between Grenville and the King was rapidly becoming\r\nunbearable to George, if not to his minister.  George was resolved to\r\nbe rid of his intolerable tyrant at the cost of almost any concession.\r\nHe was now fully as eager to welcome Pitt back to office as he had once\r\nbeen hot to drive him out of it.  Again Cumberland was called in; again\r\nCumberland approached Pitt; again Pitt's willingness to resume the\r\nseals was overborne by the stubbornness of Temple.  The King was in\r\ndespair.  He would not endure Grenville and Grenville's bullying\r\nsermons any longer, and yet it was hard indeed to find any one who\r\ncould take Grenville's place with any chance of carrying on Grenville's\r\nwork.  Cumberland had a suggestion to make, a desperate remedy for a\r\ndesperate case.  If Pitt and the old Whigs were denied to the King, why\r\nshould not the King try the new Whigs and Rockingham?\r\n\r\nThe old Whig party, as it had lived and ruled so long, had practically\r\nceased to exist.  So much the King had accomplished.  Saint George of\r\nHanover had struck at the dragon only to find that, like the monster in\r\nthe classical fable, it took new form and fresh vitality beneath his\r\nstrokes.  There was a Whig party that was not essentially the party of\r\nPitt, a party which was recruiting its ranks with earnest, thoughtful,\r\nhigh-minded, honorable men to whom the principles or want of principles\r\nwhich permitted the old Whig dominion were as intolerable as they\r\nappear to a statesman of to-day.  At the head of this new development\r\nof Whig activity was the man to whom Cumberland now turned in the hour\r\nof the King's trial, Charles Watson Wentworth, Marquis of Rockingham.\r\n\r\n{94}\r\n\r\nLord Rockingham was one of those ornaments of the English senate for\r\nthe benefit of whose biographers the adjective amiable seems especially\r\nto have been invented.  Although the master of a large fortune, while\r\nhe was still a boy of twenty he was deservedly noted for the gravity\r\nand stillness of his youth, and during a political career of\r\none-and-thirty years, if he showed neither commanding eloquence nor\r\ncommanding statesmanship, he did honor to the Whig party by his sincere\r\npatriotism and irreproachable uprightness of character.  If heaven had\r\ndenied Rockingham the resplendent gifts that immortalize a Chatham, it\r\nhad given him in full measure of the virtues of patriotism, honesty,\r\nintegrity, and zeal.  The purity of his life, the probity of his\r\nactions, and the excellence of all his public purposes, commended him\r\nto the affectionate regard of all who held that morality was more\r\nessential to a statesman than eloquence, and that it was better to fail\r\nwith such a man than to succeed with those to whom, for the most part,\r\nthe successes of that day were given.  Two years before, in 1763, his\r\ndislike for the policy of Lord Bute had driven him to resign his small\r\noffice as Lord of the Bedchamber, and he carried his scrupulousness so\r\nfar as to resign at the same time his Lord-Lieutenantcy of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nTo the delight of the Duke of Cumberland, and to the delight of the\r\nKing, Rockingham consented to form a Ministry.  With the best will in\r\nthe world Rockingham could not make his Ministry very commanding.  It\r\nwas but a makeshift, and not a very brilliant makeshift, but at least\r\nit served to get rid of Grenville and of Grenville's harangues.  So\r\nlong as Grenville was unable to terrorize the royal closet with\r\nreproaches and reproofs addressed to the King, and with menaces aimed\r\nat Bute, George was quite willing to see Newcastle intrusted with the\r\nPrivy Seal, and Conway made Secretary of State for one department, and\r\nthe Duke of Grafton for the other.  But the Ministry which the King\r\naccepted because he could get nothing better, and because he would have\r\nwelcomed something much worse so long as it delivered him from {95}\r\nGrenville--the Ministry that provoked the derisive pity of most of its\r\ncritics was destined to attain an honorable immortality.  The\r\nheterogeneous group of men who called themselves or were called, who\r\nbelieved themselves or were believed to be Whigs, had obtained one\r\nrecruit whose name was yet to make the cause he served illustrious.\r\nLord Rockingham had many claims to the regard of his contemporaries;\r\nundoubtedly his greatest claim to the regard of posterity lies in the\r\nintelligence which enabled him to discern the rising genius of a young\r\nwriter, and the wisdom which found a place by his side and a seat in\r\nthe House of Commons for Edmund Burke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765--The coming of Edmund Burke]\r\n\r\nThe history of a nation is often largely the history of certain famous\r\nmen.  Great epochs, producing great leaders, make those leaders\r\nessentially the expression of certain phases of the thought of their\r\nage.  The life of Walpole is the life of the England of his time\r\nbecause he was so intimately bound up with the great movement which\r\nended by setting Parliamentary government free from the possible\r\ndominion of the sovereign.  The life of Chatham, the life of Pitt, the\r\nlife of Fox, each in its turn is a summary of the history of England\r\nduring the time in which they helped to guide its destinies.  But to\r\nsome men, men possessing in an exceptional degree the love for humanity\r\nand the longing for progress, this power of representing in their lives\r\nthe sum and purpose of their age is markedly characteristic.  Just as\r\nMirabeau, until he died, practically represented the French Revolution,\r\nso certain English statesmen have from time to time been representative\r\nof the best life, the best thought, the best purposes, desires, and\r\nambitions of the country for whose sake they played their parts.  Of no\r\nman can this theory be said to be more happily true than of Edmund\r\nBurke.\r\n\r\nIt would scarcely be exaggeration to say that the history of England\r\nduring the middle third of the eighteenth century is largely the\r\nhistory of the career of Edmund Burke.  From the moment when Burke\r\nentered upon political life to the close of his great career, his name\r\nwas associated with every event of importance, his voice raised {96} on\r\none side or the other of every question that concerned the welfare of\r\nthe English people and the English Constitution.  As much as this,\r\nhowever, might be said of more than one actor in the political history\r\nof the period covered by Burke's public life.  But the influence which\r\nBurke exercised upon his time, the force he brought to bear upon his\r\npolitical generation, were a greater influence and a stronger force\r\nthan that directed by any other statesman of the age.  Whether for good\r\nor for evil, according to the standards by which his critics may judge\r\nhim, Burke swayed the minds of masses of his countrymen to a degree\r\nthat was unequalled among his contemporaries.  With the two great\r\nevents of the century--the revolt of the American colonies and the\r\nFrench Revolution--his name was the most intimately associated, his\r\ninfluence the most potent.  With what in their degree must be called\r\nthe minor events of the reign--with the trial of Wilkes, with the trial\r\nof Warren Hastings--he was no less intimately associated, and in each\r\ncase his association has been the most important feature of the event.\r\nWhere he was right as where he was wrong, and whether he was right or\r\nwhether he was wrong, he was always the most interesting, always the\r\nmost commanding figure in the epoch-making political controversies of\r\nhis day.  Grenville wrote of him finely, many years after his death,\r\nthat he was in the political world what Shakespeare was in the moral\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1729-59--Burke's early life]\r\n\r\nBurke entered political life, or entered active political life, when he\r\nwas returned to Parliament in the December of 1765.  Up to that time\r\nhis life had been largely uneventful; much of it must be called as far\r\nas we are concerned eventless, for of a great gap of his life, a gap of\r\nno less than nine years, we know, if not absolutely nothing, certainly\r\nnext to nothing.  It is not even quite certain where or when he was\r\nborn.  The most approved account is that he was born in Dublin on\r\nJanuary 12, 1729, reckoning according to the new style.  The place of\r\nhis birth is still pointed out to the curious in Dublin: one of the\r\nmany modest houses that line the left bank of the Liffey.  His family\r\nwas supposed to stem from Limerick, from {97} namesakes who spelled\r\ntheir name differently as Bourke.  His mother's family were Catholic;\r\nBurke's mother always remained stanch to her native faith, and, though\r\nBurke and his brothers were brought up as the Protestant sons of a\r\nProtestant father, the influence of his mother must have counted for\r\nmuch in creating that tender and generous sympathy towards a proscribed\r\ncreed which is one of the noblest characteristics of Burke's career.\r\n\r\nBurke's earliest and in a sense his best education was received between\r\nhis twelfth and fourteenth years, in the school of a Yorkshire Quaker\r\nnamed Abraham Shackleton, who kept a school at Ballitore.  Burke used\r\noften to declare in later years that he owed everything he had gained\r\nin life to the teaching and the example of those two years with Abraham\r\nShackleton.  The affectionate regard which Burke felt for his\r\nschoolmaster, an affectionate regard which endured until Shackleton's\r\ndeath, thirty years later, in 1771, he felt also for his schoolmaster's\r\nson, Richard Shackleton.  Most of what we know of Burke's life in\r\nTrinity College from 1743 to 1748 we gather from his letters to Richard\r\nShackleton, letters of absorbing interest to any student of the growth\r\nof a great mind.  Less vivacious, less brilliant than the boyish\r\nletters of Goethe, they resemble them in the eager thirst they display\r\nfor knowledge of all kinds, in their passionate enthusiasm for all the\r\nrich varieties of human knowledge, in their restless experiments in all\r\ndirections.  In those younger days Burke thought himself, as every\r\ngenerous and ambitious youth must needs think himself, a poet, and many\r\nverses were forwarded to the faithful friend, to lighten the effect of\r\nserious theological discussions and elaborate comparisons of classical\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nDissensions with his father and a determination to study for the bar\r\nsent Burke to England in the early part of 1750, and there for nine\r\nlong years he practically disappears from our knowledge.  All we know\r\nis that he studied law, but that, like many another law student, he\r\ngave more time and thought to literature than to his legal studies;\r\nthat this action deepened the hostility of his father, who {98} reduced\r\nBurke's allowance to a pittance, and that his daily need as well as his\r\ndesire drove Burke to seek his livelihood in letters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1759--The work of Edmund Burke]\r\n\r\nHe seems to have had a hard fight for it.  The glimpses we get of him\r\nduring that period of youthful struggle show him as an ardent student\r\nof books, but a no less ardent student of life, not merely in the\r\nstreets and clubs and theatres of the great city, but in the seclusion\r\nof quiet country villages and the highways and byways of rural England.\r\nRomance has not failed to endeavor to illuminate with her prismatic\r\nlantern the darkness of those nine mysterious years.  A vivid fancy has\r\nbeen pleased to picture Burke as one of the many lovers of the\r\nmarvellous Margaret Woffington, as a competitor for the chair of Moral\r\nPhilosophy at Glasgow, as a convert to the Catholic faith, and, perhaps\r\nmost remarkable of all these lively legends, as a traveller in America.\r\nThese are fictions.  The certain facts are that somewhere about 1756 he\r\nmarried a Miss Nugent, daughter of an Irish physician who had settled\r\nin England.  Miss Nugent was a Catholic, and thus, for the second time,\r\nthe Catholic religion was endeared to Burke by one of the closest of\r\nhuman relationships.  At about the same time as his marriage, Burke\r\nmade his first appearance as an author by the \"Vindication of Natural\r\nSociety,\" a satire upon Bolingbroke which many accepted as a genuine\r\nwork of Bolingbroke's, and by the \"Essay on the Sublime and the\r\nBeautiful,\" which is perhaps most valuable because we owe to it in some\r\ndegree the later masterpiece of aesthetic criticism, the \"Laocoon\" of\r\nLessing.  From this time until his connection with public life began\r\nhis career was linked with Fleet Street and its brotherhood of authors,\r\nand his pen was steadily employed.  With that love for variety of\r\nsubject which is characteristic of most of the authors of the\r\neighteenth century, he handled a number of widely differing themes.  He\r\nwrote \"Hints for an Essay on the Drama,\" a work which has scarcely held\r\nits place in the library of the dramatist by the side of the \"Paradoxe\r\nsur le Comédien\" of Diderot, or the \"Hamburgische {99} Dramaturgie\" of\r\nLessing.  He wrote an account of the European settlements in America,\r\nstill interesting as showing the early and intimate connection of his\r\nthoughts with the greatest of English colonies.  He wrote an\r\n\"Abridgment of English History,\" which carries unfortunately no farther\r\nthan the reign of John a narrative that is not unworthy of its author.\r\nHe founded the \"Annual Register,\" and was in its pages for many years\r\nto come the historian of contemporary Europe.  Of all the many debts\r\nthat Englishmen owe to Burke, the conception and inception of the\r\n\"Annual Register\" must not be reckoned as among the least important.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point in his career that Burke's connection with public\r\nlife began, not to end thenceforward until the end of his own life.\r\nSingle-speech Hamilton, so called because out of a multitude of\r\nspeeches he made one magnificent speech, was attracted to Burke by the\r\nfame of the \"Vindication of Natural Society,\" sought his acquaintance,\r\nand when Hamilton went to Ireland as secretary to Lord Halifax, Burke\r\naccompanied him.  For two years Burke remained with Hamilton in\r\nIreland, studying the Irish question of that day, with the closeness of\r\nthe acutest mind then at work and with the racial sympathy of the\r\nnative.  Then he quarrelled, and rightly quarrelled, with Hamilton,\r\nbecause Hamilton, to whom the aid of Burke was infinitely precious,\r\nsought to bind Burke forever to his service by a pension of three\r\nhundred a year.  Burke demanded some leisure for the literature that\r\nhad made his name.  Hamilton justified Leland's description of him as a\r\nselfish, canker-hearted, envious reptile by refusing.  Burke, who\r\nalways spoke his mind roundly, described Hamilton as an infamous\r\nscoundrel, flung back his pension and returned to freedom,\r\nindependence, and poverty.  But he was soon to enter the service of\r\nanother statesman under less galling terms, under less unreasonable\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nBurke's name was brought before Lord Rockingham, probably by Burke's\r\nfriend and namesake, though in all likelihood not kinsman, William\r\nBurke.  Lord Rockingham {100} appointed Burke his private secretary,\r\nand by the simple integrity of his character bound Burke, to use his\r\nown words, \"by an inviolable attachment to him from that time forward.\"\r\nBut the alliance thus begun was threatened in its birth.  A mysterious\r\nhostility attributed by Burke to \"Hell-Kite\" Hamilton brought certain\r\ncharges to the notice of the Duke of Newcastle.  The Duke of Newcastle\r\nhurried to Lord Rockingham to warn him that his newly appointed\r\nsecretary was a disguised Jesuit, a disguised Jacobite.  Lord\r\nRockingham immediately communicated these accusations to Burke, who\r\nrepelled them with a firmness and dignity which had the effect only of\r\nconfirming Lord Rockingham's admiration of Burke and of drawing closer\r\nthe friendship of the two men.  Burke was promptly brought into\r\nParliament as member for Wendover, and during the single year which\r\nLord Rockingham's Administration lasted its leader had every reason to\r\nrejoice at the happy chance which had given to him such a follower and\r\nsuch an ally.\r\n\r\nBurke delivered his maiden speech in the House of Commons on January\r\n27, 1766, a few days after the opening of the session, on the subject\r\nof the dissatisfaction in the American colonies.  His speech won the\r\npraise of the Great Commoner; his succeeding speeches earned him\r\nenthusiastic commendation from friends and admirers outside and inside\r\nthe House of Commons.  The successful man of letters had proved himself\r\nrapidly to be a successful orator and a politician who would have to be\r\nreckoned with.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1766--The influence of Burke's career]\r\n\r\nIt has been contended, and not unreasonably, that as an orator Burke is\r\nnot merely in the first rank, but that he is himself the first, that he\r\nstands alone, without a rival, without a peer, and that none of the\r\norators of antiquity can be said even to contest his unquestionable\r\nsupremacy.  But it is in no sense necessary to Burke's fame that the\r\nfame of others should be in any way impugned or depreciated.  It is\r\nsufficient praise to say that Burke is one of the greatest orators the\r\nworld has ever held.  To argue that he is superior to Demosthenes on\r\nthe {101} one hand, or to Cicero on the other, is to maintain an\r\nargument very much on a par with that which it amused Burke himself to\r\nmaintain when he contended for the superiority of the \"Aeneid\" over the\r\n\"Iliad.\"  It is quite enough to be able to say well-nigh without fear\r\nof contradiction that Burke is probably the greatest orator who ever\r\nspoke in the English language.\r\n\r\nBurke's political career began brilliantly in the championship of\r\nfreedom, in the defence of the oppressed, in the defiance of injustice.\r\nHe was made welcome to the great political arena in which he was to\r\nfight so long and so hard.  His ability was recognized at once; he may\r\nbe said to have leaped into a fame that the passage of time has not\r\nmerely confirmed but increased.  No author more profoundly influenced\r\nthe thought of his time; no author of that time is likely to exercise a\r\nmore enduring influence upon succeeding generations.  Of all the men of\r\nthat busy and brilliant age, Burke has advanced the most steadily in\r\nthe general knowledge and favor.  While other men, his rivals in\r\neloquence, his peers in the opinions of his contemporaries, come year\r\nby year to be less used as influences and appealed to as authorities,\r\nthe wisdom of Burke is more frequently drawn upon and more widely\r\nappreciated than ever.  The world sees now, even more clearly than the\r\nworld saw then, that whether Burke was right or wrong in his\r\nconclusions as to any question, it had to be admitted that the point of\r\nview from which he started to get at that conclusion was the correct\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{102}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STAMP ACT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1766--Benjamin Franklin]\r\n\r\nThat the colonies were not well understood in England was no fault of\r\nthe colonists.  There was at that time and hour in England a man\r\nspecially authorized to speak on behalf of the colony of Pennsylvania,\r\nand indirectly entitled as he was admirably qualified to represent the\r\nother colonies.  At that time Benjamin Franklin was the most\r\ndistinguished American living and the most distinguished American who\r\nhad ever lived.  It was not his first visit to England.  He had crossed\r\nthe Atlantic forty years before when he was a youth of eighteen, eager\r\nto set up for himself as a master printer, and anxious to obtain the\r\nmaterials for his trade in the old country.  In those eighteen years he\r\nhad learned many things.  He had learned how to print; he had learned\r\nhow to bear poverty with courage and ambition with patience; he could\r\nnever remember a time when he was unable to read, but he had learned\r\nhow to read with inexhaustible pleasure and unfailing profit, and he\r\nhad learned how to write.  When he was seventeen he had run away from\r\nhis birthplace, Boston, and the home of an ill-tempered brother, and\r\nmade his way as best he might to Philadelphia.  As he tramped into the\r\ncity with a loaf under each arm for provender, a young woman leaning in\r\na doorway laughed at the singular figure.  Six years later she married\r\nFranklin, who in the interval had been a journeyman printer in\r\nPhiladelphia, a journeyman printer in London, and had at last been able\r\nto set up for himself in Philadelphia.  From 1729 the story of\r\nFranklin's life is the story of a steady and splendid advance in\r\npopularity and wealth, and in the greater gifts of knowledge, wisdom,\r\nand humanity.  He published a newspaper, {103} the _Philadelphia\r\nGazette_; he disseminated frugality, thrift, industry, and the cheerful\r\nvirtues in \"Poor Richard's Almanack,\" he was the benefactor and the\r\nblessing of the city of his adoption.  He founded her famous library;\r\nhe devoted the results of his scientific studies to her comfort,\r\nwelfare, and comeliness; he maintained her defences as a military\r\nengineer, and was prepared to serve her gallantly in the field against\r\nthe Indians as a colonel of Militia of his own raising.  No man ever\r\nlived a fuller life or did so many things with more indomitable zeal or\r\nmore honorable thoroughness.  The colony of Pennsylvania was very proud\r\nof her illustrious citizen and delighted to do him honor.  When he\r\nvisited England for the second time, in 1757, he was the Agent for the\r\nGeneral Assembly of Pennsylvania, he was Deputy Postmaster-General for\r\nthe British colonies, he was famous throughout the civilized world for\r\nhis discovery of the identity of lightning with the electric fluid.  He\r\nwas in London for the third time when Rockingham took office.  He had\r\nlived nearly sixty years of a crowded, memorable, admirable life; he\r\nwas loaded with laurels, ripe in the learning of books and the learning\r\nof the book of the world.  Even he whom few things surprised or took\r\nunawares would have been surprised if he could have been told that the\r\nlife he had lived was eventless, bloodless, purposeless in comparison\r\nwith the life he had yet to live, and that all he had done for his\r\ncountry was but as dust in the balance when weighed against the work he\r\nwas yet to do for her.  He was standing on the threshold of his new\r\ncareer in the year when Edmund Burke entered Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Rockingham Administration did its best to undo the folly of\r\nGrenville's Government.  After long debates in both Houses, after\r\nexamination of Franklin at the bar of the Commons, after the strength\r\nand acumen of Mansfield had been employed to sustain the prerogative\r\nagainst the colonies and the voice of Burke had championed the colonies\r\nagainst the prerogative, after Grenville had defended himself with\r\nshrewdness and Pitt had added to the splendor of his fame, the Stamp\r\nAct was formally {104} repealed.  Unhappily, the new Ministry was only\r\npermitted to do good by halves.  The same session that repealed the\r\nStamp Act promulgated the Declaratory Act, asserting the full power of\r\nthe King, on the advice of Parliament, to make laws binding the\r\nAmerican colonies in all cases whatsoever.  This desperate attempt to\r\nassert what the repeal of the Stamp Act virtually surrendered was\r\nintended as a solace to the King and as a warning--perhaps a friendly\r\nwarning--to the colonies.  Those who were most opposed to it in England\r\nmay well have hoped that it might be accepted without too much\r\nstraining in the general satisfaction caused by the repeal of the hated\r\nmeasure.  Even Franklin seemed to believe that the Declaratory Act\r\nwould not cause much trouble in America.  The event denied the hope,\r\nand indignation at the Declaratory Act outlasted in America the\r\nrejoicing over the subversion of Grenville's policy.  Nevertheless, the\r\nrejoicing was very great.  On May 16, 1766, the public spirit of Boston\r\nwas stimulated by the distribution of a broadsheet headed \"Glorious\r\nNews.\"  This broadsheet announced the arrival of John Hancock's brig\r\n\"Harrison,\" in six weeks and two days from London, with the important\r\ntidings of the repeal of the Stamp Act.  The broadsheet painted a\r\nlively picture of the enthusiasm at Westminster and the rejoicings in\r\nthe City of London over the total repeal of the measure.  It told of\r\nthe ships in the river displaying all their colors, of illuminations\r\nand bonfires in many parts; \"in short, the rejoicings were as great as\r\nwas ever known on any occasion.\"  This broadsheet, \"printed for the\r\nbenefit of the public,\" ended in a rapture of delight.  \"It is\r\nimpossible to express the joy the town is now in, on receiving the\r\nabove great, glorious, and important news.  The bells on all the\r\nchurches were immediately set a-ringing, and we hear the day for a\r\ngeneral rejoicing will be the beginning of next week.\"  Boston had\r\nevery reason to rejoice, to ring its bells and fly its flags, and set\r\npoor debtors free from prison in honor of the occasion.  The colonies\r\nhad stood together against the Home Government, and had learned\r\nsomething of {105} the strength of their union by the repeal of the\r\nStamp Act.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1766--Action of the Colonial Governors]\r\n\r\nBut when the bells had stopped ringing and the flags were hauled down\r\nand the released debtors had ceased to congratulate themselves upon\r\ntheir newly recovered liberty, Boston and the other colonial cities\r\nfound that their satisfaction was not untempered.  The broadsheet that\r\nhad blazoned the repeal had also assured its readers that the Acts of\r\nTrade relating to America would be taken under consideration and all\r\ngrievances removed.  \"The friends to America are very powerful and\r\ndisposed to assist us to the best of their ability.\"  The friends to\r\nAmerica were powerful, but they fought against tremendous odds.\r\nDulness and mediocrity, a spite that was always stupid, and a stupidity\r\nthat was often spiteful, an alliance of ignorance and arrogance were\r\nthe forces against which they struggled in vain.  The Acts of Trade\r\nwere to be enforced as rigidly as ever.  The Declaratory Act pompously\r\nasserted the unimpeachable prerogative of British Majesty to make what\r\nlaws it pleased for the colonies.  The good that had been done seemed\r\nsmall in comparison with the harm that might yet be done, that in all\r\nprobability would be done.\r\n\r\nFor the time more was to be feared from the viceroys of the provinces\r\nthan from the Home Government.  Mr. Secretary Conway addressed a\r\ncircular letter to the governors of the different colonies, reproving\r\nthe colonists, indeed, for the recent disturbances, but with a measured\r\nmildness of reproof that seemed carefully calculated not to give\r\nneedless offence or cause unnecessary irritation.  \"If by lenient\r\npersuasive methods,\" Conway wrote, \"you can contribute to restore the\r\npeace and tranquillity to the provinces on which their welfare and\r\nhappiness depend, you will do a most acceptable and essential service\r\nto your country.\"  An appeal so suave, advice so judicious, did not\r\nseem the less prudent and humane because the Secretary insisted upon\r\nthe repression of violence and outrage and reminded those to whom his\r\nletter was addressed that if they needed aid in the maintenance of law\r\nand order {106} they were to require it at the hands of the commanders\r\nof his Majesty's land and naval forces in America.  If all the\r\ngentlemen to whom the Secretary's circular was addressed had been as\r\nreasonable and as restrained in language as its writer, things might\r\neven then have turned out very differently.  It was not to be expected,\r\nand the colonists did not expect, that outrage and violence were to go\r\nunchallenged and unpunished, and it is probable that few even in\r\nMassachusetts would have objected to the formal expression of thanks\r\nfor firmness and zeal which was made by Conway to the governor of that\r\ncolony.  But the temperance that was possible to Conway was impossible\r\nto Bernard.  Bernard was one of the worst of a long line of\r\ninappropriate colonial governors.  He was a hot-headed, hot-hearted man\r\nwho seemed to think that to play the part of a domineering, blustering\r\nbully was to show discretion and discernment in the duties of his\r\noffice.  He always acted under the conviction that he must always be in\r\nthe right and every one else always in the wrong, and he blazed up into\r\nfantastic rages at the slightest show of opposition.  As this was not\r\nthe spirit in which to deal with the proud and independent men of\r\nMassachusetts, Governor Bernard passed the better part of his life in a\r\npassion and was forever quarrelling with his provincial legislature and\r\nforever complaining to the Home Government of his hard lot and of the\r\nmischievous, mutinous set of fellows he had to deal with.\r\n\r\nWhen Bernard received the Secretary's letters and the accompanying\r\ncopies of the two Bills that had been passed by the British Parliament,\r\nhe hastened to make them known to the Assembly of Massachusetts.  But\r\nhe made them known in a speech that was wholly lacking in either\r\ntemperance or discretion.  Had it been at once his desire and his duty\r\nto inflame his hearers against himself and the Government which he\r\nrepresented he could hardly have chosen words more admirably adapted\r\nfor the purpose.  With a wholly unchastened arrogance and a wholly\r\nungoverned truculence, the governor of the province lectured or rather\r\nhectored the gentlemen of the Council and the {107} gentlemen of the\r\nHouse of Representatives after a fashion that would have seemed in\r\nquestionable taste on the part of an old-fashioned pedagogue to a\r\nparcel of unruly schoolboys.  He was for bullying and blustering them\r\ninto a better behavior, and he assured those who were willing to make\r\namends and to promise to be good in the future that their past offences\r\nwould be buried in a charitable oblivion.  \"Too ready a forgetfulness\r\nof injuries hath been said to be my weakness,\" Bernard urged with\r\nstrange ignorance.  \"However, it is a failing which I had rather suffer\r\nby than be without.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives replied to the reproofs of their governor\r\nin an address that was remarkable for the firmness with which it\r\nmaintained its own position and the irony with which it reviewed the\r\ngovernor's pretensions.  To prove their independence of action, they\r\ndelayed the Act of Indemnity demanded by Secretary Conway for several\r\nmonths, and then accompanied it with a general pardon to all persons\r\nwho had been concerned in the riots provoked by the Stamp Act.  Though\r\nthis Act was promptly disallowed by the Home Government on the ground\r\nthat the power of pardon belonged exclusively to the Crown, it took\r\neffect nevertheless, and added another to the grievances of Bernard and\r\nof his backers in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1766--End of the Rockingham Administration]\r\n\r\nThe slowly widening breach between the American colonies and the mother\r\ncountry might even yet have been filled if it had been possible for the\r\nKing to depend upon the services and listen to the advice of ministers\r\nwhose good intentions and general good sense had the advantage of being\r\nserved and indirectly inspired by the genius of Burke.  But unhappily,\r\nthe fortunes of the party with whom he was allied were not long fated\r\nto be official fortunes.  After a year of honorable if somewhat\r\ncolorless existence, the Rockingham Administration came to an end.\r\nThere was no particular reason why it should come to an end, but the\r\nKing was weary of it.  If it had not gravely dissatisfied him, it had\r\nafforded him no grave satisfaction.  An Administration always seemed to\r\nGeorge the Third like a candle which he could illuminate or extinguish\r\nat his {108} pleasure.  So he blew out the Rockingham Administration\r\nand turned to Pitt for a new one.  In point of fact, an Administration\r\nwithout Pitt was an impossibility.  The Duke of Grafton had resigned\r\nhis place in the Rockingham Ministry because he believed it hopeless to\r\ngo on without the adhesion of Pitt, and Pitt would not adhere to the\r\nRockingham Ministry.  Now, with a free hand, he set to work to form one\r\nof the most amazing Administrations that an age which knew many strange\r\nAdministrations can boast of.\r\n\r\nThe malady which had for so long martyrized the great statesman had\r\nafflicted him heavily of late.  His eccentricities had increased to\r\nsuch a degree that they could hardly be called merely eccentricities.\r\nBut though he suffered in mind and in body he was ready and even eager\r\nto return to power, so long as that power was absolute.  By this time\r\nhe had quarrelled with Temple, who had so often hindered him from\r\nresuming office, and who was now as hostile to him as his brother,\r\nGeorge Grenville, had ever been.  Temple, in consequence, found no\r\nplace in the new Administration.  The Administration was especially\r\ndesigned to please the King.  A party had grown up in the State which\r\nwas known by the title of the King's friends.  The King's friends had\r\nno political creed, no political convictions, no desire, no ambition,\r\nand no purpose save to please the King.  What the King wanted said they\r\nwould say; what the King wanted done they would do; their votes were\r\nunquestionably and unhesitatingly at the King's command.  They did not,\r\nindeed, act from an invincible loyalty to the royal person.  It was the\r\nroyal purse that ruled them.  The King was the fountain of patronage;\r\nwealth and honors flowed from him; and the wealth and the honors welded\r\nthe King's friends together into a harmonious and formidable whole.\r\nThe King's friends found themselves well represented in a Ministry that\r\nwas otherwise as much a thing of shreds and patches as a harlequin's\r\ncoat.  Pitt had tried to make a chemical combination, but he only\r\nsucceeded in making a mixture that might at any time dissolve into its\r\ncomponent parts.  It was composed {109} of men of all parties and all\r\nprinciples.  The amiable Conway and the unamiable Grafton remained on\r\nfrom Rockingham's Ministry.  So did the Duke of Portland and Lord\r\nBessborough, so did Saunders and Keppel.  Pitt did not forget his own\r\nfollowers.  He gave the Great Seal to Lord Camden, who, as Justice\r\nPratt, had liberated Wilkes from unjustifiable arrest.  He made Lord\r\nShelburne one of the Secretaries of State.  The Chancellorship of the\r\nExchequer was given to a politician with a passion for popularity that\r\nmade him as steadfast as a weathercock, Charles Townshend.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1766--Pitt as Earl of Chatham]\r\n\r\nBy this time Pitt was no longer the Great Commoner.  The House of\r\nCommons was to know him no more.  Under the title of Earl of Chatham he\r\nhad entered the Upper House.  Such an elevation did not mean then, as\r\nit came later to mean, something little better than political\r\nextinction.  But Pitt's elevation meant to him a loss of popularity as\r\nimmediate as it was unexpected.  Though he was no longer young, though\r\nhe was racked in mind and body, though he sorely needed the repose that\r\nhe might hope to find in the Upper House, he was assailed with as much\r\nfury of vituperation as if he had betrayed the State.  A country that\r\nwas preparing to rejoice at his return to power lashed itself into a\r\nfury of indignation at his exaltation to the peerage.  In the twinkling\r\nof an eye men who had been devoted yesterday to Pitt were prepared to\r\nbelieve every evil of Chatham.  His rule began in storm and gloom, and\r\ngloomy and stormy it remained.  The first act of his Administration\r\nroused the fiercest controversy.  A bad harvest had raised the price of\r\nfood almost to famine height.  Chatham took the bold step of laying an\r\nembargo on the exportation of grain.  The noise of the debates over\r\nthis act had hardly died away when Pitt's malady again overmastered\r\nhim, and once more he disappeared from public life into mysterious\r\nmelancholy silence and seclusion.  It was an unhappy hour for the\r\ncountry which deprived it of the services of Chatham and left the helm\r\nof state in the hands of Charles Townshend.\r\n\r\nCharles Townshend was the erratic son of a singularly {110} erratic\r\nmother.  The beautiful Audrey Harrison married the third Marquis\r\nTownshend, bore him five children, and then separated from him to carry\r\nher beauty, her insolence, and her wit through an amazed and amused\r\nsociety.  It was one of her eccentricities to change her name Audrey to\r\nEthelfreda.  Another was to fancy herself and to proclaim herself to be\r\nvery much in love with the unhappy Lord Kilmarnock.  She attended the\r\ntrial persistently, waited under his windows, quarrelled with Selwyn\r\nfor daring to jest about the execution--no very happy theme for\r\nwit--and was all for adopting a little boy whom some of the officials\r\nof the Tower had palmed off upon her as Kilmarnock's son.  Walpole\r\nliked her, delighted in her witty, stinging sayings.  She was always\r\nentertaining, always alarming, always ready to say or do anything that\r\ncame into her mind.  She lived, a whimsical, spiteful, sprightly\r\noddity, to be eighty-seven years of age.  [Sidenote: 1766--Peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of Charles Townshend] Charles Townshend was her second\r\nson, and Charles Townshend was in many ways as whimsical as his mother.\r\nHe had a ready wit, a dexterity in epigram, an astonishing facility of\r\nspeech, and a very great appreciation of his own power of turning\r\nfriends or foes into ridicule.  It is told of him that once in his\r\nyouth, when a student at Leyden, he suffered from his readiness to jest\r\nat the expense of another.  At a merry supper party he plied one of the\r\nguests, a seemingly unconscious, stolid Scotchman named Johnstone, with\r\nsneers and sarcasms which the Scotchman seemed to disregard or take in\r\ngood part.  On the next morning, however, Townshend's victim,\r\nenlightened by some friend as to the way in which he had been made a\r\nbutt of, became belligerent and sent Townshend a challenge.  Various\r\nopinions have been expressed of Townshend's action in the matter.  He\r\nhas been applauded for good sense.  He has been reproached for\r\ncowardice.  Certainly Townshend did not, would not fight his\r\nchallenger.  It required a great deal of good sense to decline a duel\r\nin those days, and Townshend did decline the duel.  He apologized to\r\nhis slow-witted but stubborn-purposed opponent with a profusion of\r\napology which some of his {111} friends thought to be excessive.  In\r\nthese days we should consider Townshend's refusal to fight a duel\r\nmerely as an unimportant proof of his common-sense, but in the last\r\ncentury, in the society in which Townshend moved, and on the Continent,\r\nsuch a refusal suggested the possession of a degree of common-sense\r\nthat was far from ordinary--that was, indeed, extraordinary.\r\nTownshend's tact, wit, and good spirits carried him through the scrape\r\nsomehow.  He made the rounds of Leyden with his would-be adversary,\r\ncalling in turn upon each of his many friends, and obtaining from each,\r\nin the presence of his companion, the assurance that Townshend had\r\nnever been known to speak of Johnstone slightingly or discourteously\r\nbehind his back.  The episode, trivial in itself, gains a kind of\r\ngravity by the illustration it affords of Townshend's character all\r\nthrough Townshend's short career.  The impossibility of restraining an\r\nincorrigible tongue, and the unreadiness to follow out the course of\r\naction to which his words would seem to have committed him, were the\r\ndistinguishing marks of Townshend's political existence.  No man, no\r\nparty, nor no friend could count on the unflinching services of\r\nTownshend.  His conduct was as irresponsible as his eloquence was\r\ndazzling.  In his twenty years of public life he had but one\r\npurpose--to please and to be praised; and to gain those ends he\r\nsacrificed consistency and discretion with a light heart.  The beauty\r\nof his person and the fluent splendor of his speech went far towards\r\nthe attainment of an ambition which was always frustrated by a fatal\r\nlevity.  In the fine phrase of Burke, he was a candidate for\r\ncontradictory honors, and his great aim was to make those agree in\r\nadmiration of him who never agreed in anything else.\r\n\r\nIt has been given to few men to desire fame more ardently, and to\r\nattain it more disastrously, than Charles Townshend.  If we may\r\nestimate the man by the praises of his greatest contemporary, no one\r\nbetter deserved a fairer fortune than fate allotted to him.  Burke\r\nspoke of Townshend as the delight and ornament of the House of Commons,\r\nand the charm of every private society which he honored with his\r\npresence.  Though his passion for {112} fame might be immoderate, it\r\nwas at least a passion which is the instinct of all great souls.  While\r\nBurke could rhapsodize over Townshend's pointed and finished wit, his\r\nrefined, exquisite, and penetrating judgment, his skill and power in\r\nstatement, his excellence in luminous explanation, Walpole was no less\r\nenthusiastic in an estimate that contrasted Townshend with Burke.\r\nAccording to Walpole, Townshend, who studied nothing with accuracy or\r\nattention, had parts that embraced all knowledge with such quickness\r\nthat he seemed to create knowledge instead of seeking for it.  Ready as\r\nWalpole admits Burke's wit to have been, he declares that it appeared\r\nartificial when set by that of Townshend, which was so abundant in him\r\nthat it seemed a loss of time to think.  Townshend's utterances had\r\nalways the fascinating effervescence of spontaneity, while even Burke's\r\nextempore utterances were so pointed and artfully arranged that they\r\nwore the appearance of study and preparation.  This brilliant,\r\nresplendent creature, in every respect the opposite to George\r\nGrenville, showy where Grenville was solid, fluent where he was formal,\r\nglittering and even glowing where he was sober or sombre, fascinating\r\nwhere he was repellent, gracious where he was sullen, and polished\r\nwhere he was rude, was nevertheless destined to share Grenville's\r\nhateful task and Grenville's deserved condemnation.  Such enthusiasm as\r\nParliament had permitted itself to show over the repeal of Grenville's\r\nStamp Act had long flickered out.  The colonists were regarded with\r\nmore disfavor than ever by a majority that raged against their\r\ningratitude and bitterly repented the repeal of the Act.  Townshend's\r\npassion for popularity forced him into the fatal blunder of his life.\r\nHe was indeed, as Burke said, the spoiled child of the House of\r\nCommons, never thinking, acting, or speaking but with a view to its\r\njudgment, and adapting himself daily to its disposition, and adjusting\r\nhimself before it as before a looking-glass.  The looking-glass showed\r\nhim a member of a Ministry that was unpopular because it refused to tax\r\nAmerica.  He resolved that the looking-glass should show him a member\r\nof a Ministry popular because {113} it was resolved to tax America.\r\nHis hunger and thirst after popularity, his passion for fame, were\r\nleading him into strange ways indeed.  He was to leave after him an\r\nenduring name, but enduring for reasons that would have broken his\r\nbright spirit if he could have realized them.  The shameful folly of\r\nGeorge Grenville was the shameful folly of Charles Townshend.  His name\r\nstands above Grenville's in the roll of those who in that disastrous\r\ntime did so much to lower the honor and lessen the empire of England.\r\nIt became plain to Townshend that the Parliamentary majority regretted\r\nthe repeal of the Stamp Act and resented the theory that America should\r\nnot be taxed.  Townshend resolved that revenue could and should be\r\nraised out of America.  He introduced a Bill imposing a tax on glass,\r\npaper, and tea upon the American colonies.  Though the amount to be\r\nraised was not large, no more than forty thousand pounds, and though it\r\nwas proposed that the whole of the sum should be spent in America, it\r\nwas as mischievous in its result as if it had been more malevolently\r\naimed.  [Sidenote: 1766--Death of Townshend] Townshend himself did not\r\nlive long enough to learn the unhappy consequences of his folly.  A\r\nneglected fever proved fatal to him in the September of 1767, in the\r\nforty-third year of his age.  Walpole lamented him with an ironical\r\nappreciation.  \"Charles Townshend is dead.  All those parts and fire\r\nare extinguished; those volatile salts are evaporated; that first\r\neloquence of the world is dumb; that duplicity is fixed, that cowardice\r\nterminated heroically.  He joked on death as naturally as he used to do\r\non the living, and not with the affectation of philosophers who wind up\r\ntheir works with sayings which they hope to have remembered.\"\r\nTownshend had passed away, but his policy remained, a fatal legacy to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nTownshend was immediately succeeded in the Chancellorship of the\r\nExchequer by a young politician who had been for some years in\r\nParliament and had held several offices without conspicuously\r\ndistinguishing himself.  When Lord North entered the House of Commons\r\nas member for Banbury, his record was that of any intelligent young\r\n{114} nobleman of his time.  He had written pleasing Latin love poems\r\nat Eton, he had been to Oxford, he had studied at Leipzig.  George\r\nGrenville saw great promise in North.  He even predicted that if he did\r\nnot relax in his political pursuits he was very likely to become Prime\r\nMinister.  Unhappily for his country, North did not relax in his\r\npolitical pursuits.  There was an ironic fitness in the fact that North\r\nshould be admired by Grenville and should succeed to Townshend, for no\r\nman was better fitted to carry on the fatal policy of the two men who\r\nhad outraged the American colonies by the Stamp Act and the tax on tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{115}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nWILKES REDIVIVUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1767--The return of Wilkes]\r\n\r\nWhile the King's Government was preparing for itself an infinity of\r\ntrouble abroad, it was not destined to find itself idle for want of\r\ntrouble at home.  Great and grave trouble came upon the King and his\r\nfriends suddenly, and out of a quarter from which they least expected\r\nit.  If they were confident of anything, they were confident that they\r\nhad dealt the final blow to the audacious demagogue who for a time had\r\nfluttered the town with the insolences of the _North Briton_.  The\r\n_North Briton_ had ceased to exist.  Of the two men whose bitter genius\r\nhad been its breath, Churchill was dead, and Wilkes himself, a fugitive\r\nand a beggar, drifting from one European capital to another, seemed as\r\nlittle to be feared as if he slept by Churchill's side.  The visit of\r\nthe Commander's statue to Don Juan seemed scarcely more out of the\r\ncourse of nature to Don Juan's lackey than the reappearance in active\r\npublic life of Wilkes appeared to the King's friends, for whom Wilkes\r\nhad ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nWilkes had wearied of Continental life.  His affection for his own\r\ncountry was so earnest and so sincere that, in a letter to the Duke of\r\nGrafton, he declared his willingness to bury himself in the obscurity\r\nof private life, if he were permitted to return unmolested to England.\r\nThe appeal failed to extract a satisfactory reply.  The Ministers would\r\nmake no terms with their ruined foeman.  Wilkes then resolved to show\r\nthat he was not so helpless as his enemies appeared to think him.  He\r\npublished in 1767, in London, a pamphlet, in which he stated his case\r\nwith indignation, but not without dignity.  When the pamphlet had\r\nobtained a wide circulation, Wilkes followed {116} it up by appearing\r\nhimself in London in the February of 1768, at the moment of the general\r\nelection, and announcing himself as a candidate for Parliament for the\r\nCity of London.  The audacity of this step amazed his enemies and\r\ndelighted his friends.  If it had been taken a little earlier it might\r\nhave won him the seat.  So calm and so wise an observer as Franklin, at\r\nleast, thought that it would have done so.  As it was, though Wilkes\r\ncame late into the field, and was placed at the bottom of the poll, he\r\nsecured more than twelve hundred votes, and did, in the conventional\r\nphrase too often used to soothe defeat, gain a great moral victory.\r\n\r\nThe courage of the outlaw had more than revived all the old enthusiasm\r\nfor him.  We know on the authority of Burke that the acclamations of\r\njoy with which he was welcomed by the populace were inconceivable, and\r\nthat the marks of public favor which he received were by no means\r\nconfined to the lower order of the people.  Several merchants and other\r\ngentlemen of large property and of considerable interest openly\r\nespoused his cause, and a subscription was immediately opened in the\r\nCity for the payment of his debts.  We know on other authority that in\r\nan age when betting was the mode the extraordinary betting as to\r\nWilkes's success in his desperate enterprise was actually organized by\r\na certain number of brokers into stock which was quoted on 'Change.\r\nBurke ascribes the reason for the failure to the open voting.  The\r\nelectors were obliged, he said, to record their names, and the\r\nconsequences of an opposition to great corporate and commercial\r\nconnections were too obvious not to be understood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1768--Wilkes as Member for Middlesex]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Wilkes knew of his defeat in the City, he struck a yet\r\nbolder note for success.  He came forward at once as a candidate for\r\nthe County of Middlesex in opposition to the established interest of\r\ntwo gentlemen who had represented it for several years, who were\r\nsupported by the whole interest of the Court and who had considerable\r\nfortunes and great connections in it.  But Wilkes, too, had powerful\r\nabettors.  The Duke of Portland was one of his most prominent\r\nsupporters.  His old friend Temple {117} supplied the freehold\r\nqualification which was then essential for a Parliamentary candidate.\r\nHorne, the Rector of Brentford, where the election took place, gave all\r\nhis great influence and all his gifts to the service of Wilkes with the\r\nsame devotion that had formerly animated Churchill.  Horne was not\r\naltogether an admirable character, and his enthusiasm for Wilkes had\r\nhitherto awakened no corresponding enthusiasm on Wilkes's part.  But\r\nHorne was invaluable at a crisis like the Middlesex election.  He had\r\nthe eloquence of a sophist; he had the strategy of a tactician; he was\r\nendowed with an unconquerable energy, an indomitable determination.  He\r\nwas exceedingly popular in his parish; he caught the mood of the\r\npopular party, and he happened to be on the right side.  It would be\r\ndifficult to exaggerate the importance of the services he rendered to\r\nWilkes and to the cause of which Wilkes was the figurehead by his work\r\nin the Middlesex election.  The zeal of Horne, the friendship of\r\nTemple, the daring of Wilkes carried the day.  It was no ordinary\r\nvictory.  It was an astonishing triumph.  As Burke pointed out, the\r\nsame causes did not operate upon the freeholders at large which had\r\nprevented the inclinations of the livery of London from taking effect\r\nin Wilkes's favor, and the result of the polling on March 28 was that\r\nWilkes was returned to Parliament by a prodigious majority.  Wilkes\r\npolled 1290 votes.  Mr. George Cooke, the Tory candidate, who had been\r\nthe representative for eighteen years, only scored 827, and Sir W.\r\nBeauchamp Procter, the Whig candidate, only got 807 votes.\r\n\r\nThere was great excitement in London when the result of the election\r\nwas known.  It pleased the popular voice to insist that every window\r\nshould be illuminated in honor of Wilkes's triumph, and all windows\r\nthat were not lit up were unhesitatingly broken.  Those persons who\r\nwere known to be Wilkes's principal opponents received the special\r\nattentions of the mob.  Lord Bute's house had to stand a siege; so had\r\nthe house of Lord Egremont, who had signed the warrant for Wilkes's\r\ncommittal; so had other houses which were either known to belong to the\r\n{118} opponents of the hero or showed themselves to be such by their\r\ndarkened windows.  All such windows were instantly broken, to the joy\r\nof the glaziers, who declared that a Middlesex election was worth any\r\nnumber of Indian victories.  The mob had it all its own way, for the\r\nstrength of the constabulary had been drafted off to Brentford in\r\nexpectation of rioting there which never took place.  But the mob did\r\nnot abuse its triumph.  It was in its playful, not its dangerous mood.\r\nIt stopped the carriages of the gentry, made the occupants cheer for\r\nWilkes and Liberty, scrawled the number Forty-five upon the polished\r\npanels, broke the glasses, but in the main let the carriage-owners go\r\nunmolested.  The Duke of Northumberland was forced to toast the popular\r\nfavorite in a mug of ale.  One ludicrous occurrence very nearly became\r\nan international episode.  The Austrian Ambassador, Count Hatzfeldt,\r\nfamed for his stateliness, for his punctiliousness in ceremonial, fell\r\na victim to popular misapprehension.  The mob that surrounded his coach\r\ntook him, unhappily, for a Scotchman, either because of his stiffness\r\nof demeanor or because they could not understand what he was saying.\r\nTo be thought Scotch was a bad thing for any man in the hands of a mob\r\nthat howled for Wilkes, that howled against Bute.  The Austrian\r\nAmbassador was dragged from his carriage and held uplifted in\r\nsufficiently uncomfortable fashion while the magic number Forty-five\r\nwas chalked upon the soles of his shoes.  He was no further hurt; if he\r\nhad been a more prudent man he would have grinned at the mischance and\r\nsaid no more about it.  But he chose to consider his dignity and the\r\ndignity of his empire affronted by the follies of a crowd.  He lodged a\r\nformal complaint with the English Government.  The English Government\r\ncould do nothing more than express regret with such gravity as it could\r\nmuster.  As for the irreverent rogues who had laid their hands upon the\r\nfeet of the representative of a friendly State, it was not in the power\r\nof the Government to punish them.  The earth has bubbles as the water\r\nhas, and they were of them.\r\n\r\nFor two days the town was practically at the mercy of {119} the Wilkite\r\nmob.  The trainbands were called out by the Mayor, who was an ardent\r\ncourtier, but the men of the trainbands were, for the most part, no\r\nless ardent Wilkites.  They lent their drums to swell the noise of\r\nWilkes's triumph; they could not be counted on to lend their muskets to\r\nthe suppression of Wilkes's partisans.  Even the regular troops were\r\nnot, it was thought, to be relied upon in the emergency.  It was said\r\nhere that certain regimental drummers had beaten their drums for\r\nWilkes; it was said there that soldiers had been heard to declare that\r\nthey would never fire upon the people.\r\n\r\nThe fury of the Ministry, and especially the fury of the King, flamed\r\nhigh.  The King's heat was increased by a letter which Wilkes had\r\naddressed directly to him on his return to England.  In this letter\r\nWilkes made a not undignified appeal for the King's mercy and clemency,\r\ncomplained of the wicked and deceitful acts of revenge of the late\r\nMinistry, and assured the sovereign of his zeal and attachment to his\r\nservice.  To this letter, naturally, no direct reply was made.  The\r\nform that the King's answer took was to insist that all the strength of\r\nthe Government must be used against Wilkes in order that he should be\r\ndriven from that Parliament to which the electors of Middlesex had\r\ndared to return him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1768--Wilkes in prison]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the force of the law was slowly exerted against\r\nWilkes.  Wilkes had promised that on the first day of the term\r\nfollowing his arrival in England he would present himself at the Court\r\nof King's Bench.  He kept his promise and surrendered himself on April\r\n20.  The judges of the King's Bench seem to have been paralyzed by the\r\nposition.  It took them a whole week to decide that they would refuse\r\nWilkes bail--a whole week, every day, every hour of which served to\r\nmake Wilkes's cause better known and Wilkes himself more popular.\r\nWilkes went to prison under the most extraordinary circumstances.  His\r\njourney from Westminster to Bishopsgate was more like a royal progress\r\nthan the passage of a criminal and an outlaw.  It was only with the\r\ngreatest difficulty that Wilkes was able to detach himself from the\r\nzeal of the populace {120} and get quietly into his prison.  The prison\r\nimmediately became an object of greater interest than a royal palace.\r\nEvery day it was surrounded by a dense crowd that considered itself\r\nrewarded for hours of patient waiting if it could but get a glimpse of\r\nthe prisoner's face at a window.  All this show of enthusiasm\r\nexasperated the ministers and drove them into the very acts that were\r\nbest calculated to keep the enthusiasm alive.  On the day of the\r\nopening of Parliament, May 10, the Government, under the pretence of\r\nfearing riot, sent down a detachment of soldiers to guard the King's\r\nBench Prison, in St. George's Fields.  This was in itself a rash step\r\nenough, but every circumstance attending it only served to make it more\r\nrash.  As if deliberately to aggravate the popular feeling, the\r\nregiment chosen for this pretence of keeping the peace was a Scotch\r\nregiment.  At a moment when everything Scotch was insanely disliked in\r\nLondon such a choice was not likely to insure good temper either on the\r\npart of the mob or on the part of the military.  That good temper was\r\nnot intended or desired was made plain by a letter written by Lord\r\nWeymouth, the Secretary of State, to the local magistrate, urging him\r\nto make use of the soldiers in any case of riot.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was only what might have been expected.  The crowd,\r\nirritated by the non-appearance of Wilkes, still more irritated by the\r\npresence of the soldiery, threatened, or was thought to threaten, an\r\nattack upon the prison.  Angry words were followed by blows; the brawl\r\nbetween the mob and the military became a serious conflict.  A young\r\nman named Allan, who seems to have had nothing to do with the scuffle,\r\nwas killed in a private house by some of the soldiers who had forced an\r\nentrance in pursuit of one of their assailants.  Then the Riot Act was\r\nread; the troops fired; half a dozen of the rioters were killed,\r\nincluding one woman, and several others were wounded.\r\n\r\nNews of this bad business intensified the angry feeling against the\r\nGovernment.  A Scotch soldier, Donald Maclean, was put on his trial for\r\nthe murder of Allan.  His {121} acquittal caused an indignation which\r\ndeepened when the colonel of the regiment presented him with thirty\r\nguineas on behalf of the Government.  This was taken as an example of\r\nthe determination of the Crown to silence the voice of the people with\r\nthe weapons of Scotch mercenaries.  Pamphlets, speeches, sermons, all\r\nwere employed to stimulate the general agitation and to brand with\r\natrocity the conduct of the Ministry.  The tombstone erected over the\r\nmurdered man Allan chronicled his inhuman murder \"by Scottish\r\ndetachments from the Army,\" and quoted from Proverbs the words, \"Take\r\naway the wicked from before the King.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1768--The Ministry on its defence]\r\n\r\nThe ministers, on their side, were not slow to defend themselves.\r\nBurke, with his usual fairness, has stated their case for them when he\r\ntells how they painted in the strongest colors the licentiousness of\r\nthe rabble and that contempt of all government which makes it necessary\r\nto oppose to a violent distemper remedies not less violent.  This is,\r\nof course, the excuse of every overbearing authority, which, having\r\naroused irritation by its own mismanagement, can conceive of no better\r\nway of allaying that irritation than the bayonet and the bullet.  The\r\nMinistry and the advocates of the Ministry maintained that the unhappy\r\ndisposition of the people was such that juries under the influence of\r\nthe general infatuation could hardly be got to do justice to soldiers\r\nunder prosecution, unless Government interposed in the most effectual\r\nmanner for the protection of those who had acted under their orders.\r\nThey further urged that, in view of the danger of the insolence of the\r\npopulace becoming contagious with the very soldiery, it was necessary\r\nfor them to keep those servants firm to their duty by new and unusual\r\nrewards.  \"Whatever weight,\" says Burke, dryly, \"might have been in\r\nthese reasons, they were but little prevalent, and the Ministry became\r\nby this affair and its concomitant circumstances still more unpopular\r\nthan by almost any other event.\"  But it must in fairness be admitted\r\nthat, foolish, stubborn, and even brutal as the King's ministers showed\r\nthemselves to be, their position was a very difficult one.\r\n\r\n{122}\r\n\r\nIt was well open to the Government to urge, and to urge with truth, the\r\npeculiar lawlessness of the hour.  It is an effective example of the\r\nineffectiveness of a mere policy of coercion that, at a time when the\r\npenal laws of Great Britain were ferocious to a degree that would have\r\ndisgraced Dahomey, the laws were so frequently defied, and defied with\r\nimpunity.  The laws might be merciless, even murderous, but the\r\nExecutive had not always the power to compel respect or to enforce\r\nobedience.  Among the lower classes in the great city, and not merely\r\nthat portion of the lower classes who are qualified by the appellation\r\nof the dangerous classes, but in strata where at least a moderate\r\ndegree of civilization might be hoped for, an amount of savagery, of\r\nlawlessness, and of cruelty prevailed that would have not ill become\r\nthe pirates of the Spanish Seas or the most brutal of Calabrian\r\nbrigands.  The hideous institution of the pillory stimulated and\r\nfostered all the worst instincts of a mob to whose better instincts no\r\ndecent system of education sought to appeal.  Ignorance, and poverty,\r\nand dirt brooded over the bulk of the poorer population, to breed their\r\ninevitable consequences.  Murder was alarmingly common.  Riots that\r\nalmost reached the proportions of petty civil wars were liable to arise\r\nat any moment between one section of the poorer citizens and another.\r\nThe horrors of the Brownrigg case show to what extent lust of cruelty\r\ncould go.  The large disbandments that are the inevitable consequence\r\nof peace after a long war had thrown out of employment, and thrown upon\r\nthe country, no small number of needy, unscrupulous, and desperate men,\r\nonly too ready to lend a hand to any disturbance that might afford a\r\nchance of food and drink and plunder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1752--Mob violence in London]\r\n\r\nMob law ruled in London to an extraordinary degree during the whole of\r\nthe eighteenth century.  It reached a high pitch, but not its highest\r\npitch, at the time when the watchword was Wilkes and Liberty.  London\r\nwas to witness bitterer work, bloodier work than anything which\r\nfollowed upon the Middlesex election and the imprisonment of the\r\npopular hero.  But for the time the audacity of the mob seemed to have\r\ngone its farthest.  The temper of the {123} mob was insolent, its\r\ninsolence was brutal.  It hated all foreigners--and among foreigners it\r\nnow included Scotchmen--and it manifested its hatred in vituperation,\r\nand when it dared in violence.  A white man would hardly be in more\r\ndanger in a mid-African village than a foreigner was in the streets of\r\nLondon.  There is a contemporary account written by a French gentleman\r\nwho travelled in England, and who published his observations on what he\r\nsaw in England, which gives a piteous account of the barbarous\r\nincivility to which he, his friends, and his servants were exposed when\r\nthey walked abroad.  The mob that jeered and insulted the master very\r\nnearly killed the servant for the single offence of being a Frenchman.\r\nBut the brutalities of the mob were not limited to strangers.  The\r\ncitizens of London fared almost as badly if not quite as badly as any\r\nFrenchman could do.  Fielding gives a picture in one of his essays of\r\nthe lawless arrogance which was characteristic of the rabble.  He gave\r\nto the mob the title of the Fourth Estate in an article in the _Covent\r\nGarden Journal_ for June 13, 1752, and in another article a week later\r\nhe painted an ironical picture of the brutal manners and overbearing\r\ndemeanor of the mob.  \"A gentleman,\" he wrote, \"may go a voyage at sea\r\nwith little more hazard than he can travel ten miles from the\r\nmetropolis.\"  On the river, on the streets, on the highways, according\r\nto Fielding, mob manners prevailed, and brutal language might at any\r\nmoment be followed by brutal actions.  When the largest allowance is\r\nmade for the exaggeration of the satirist, enough remains to show that\r\nthe condition of London in the second half of the eighteenth century\r\nwas disorderly in the extreme.  People who ventured on the Thames were\r\nliable to the foulest insults, and even to be run down by those who\r\nwere pleased to regard the stream as their appanage, and who resented\r\nthe appearance on it of any who seemed better dressed than themselves.\r\nWomen of fashion were liable to be hustled, mobbed, insulted if they\r\nventured in St. James's Park on a Sunday evening.  No one could walk\r\nthe streets by day without the probability of being annoyed, or by\r\nnight without the risk of {124} being knocked down.  After painting his\r\ngrim picture in the Hogarth manner, Fielding concluded grimly that he\r\nmust observe \"that there are two sorts of persons of whom this fourth\r\nestate do yet stand in some awe, and whom, consequently, they have in\r\ngreat abhorrence: these are a justice of the peace and a soldier.  To\r\nthese two it is entirely owing that they have not long since rooted all\r\nthe other orders out of the commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1769--Wilkes's expulsion from the Commons]\r\n\r\nThe Government hoped that the longer Wilkes lay in prison, the more\r\nchance there was that the enthusiasm for him would abate.  But in this\r\nhope the Government were disappointed.  Even in the ranks of the\r\nministers the King was not able to find unswerving agreement to his\r\ndemands for Wilkes's expulsion from Parliament.  Outside Parliament the\r\nagitation was not only undiminished, but was even on the increase.\r\nThis was shown conclusively by a fresh event in connection with\r\nMiddlesex.  Cooke, who was the colleague of Wilkes in the\r\nrepresentation of the county, died.  Serjeant Glynn, who had made\r\nhimself conspicuous as the champion of Wilkes and the advocate of the\r\npopular cause, came forward to contest the vacant seat, and carried the\r\nconstituency in spite of the most determined efforts on the part of the\r\nroyal faction to defeat him.  There were more riots, more deaths on the\r\npopular side, more trials, more convictions for murder and more pardons\r\nof the condemned men.  The agitation which had been burning at a steady\r\nheat blazed up into a flame.  Wilkes made every use of the opportunity.\r\nHe had succeeded in getting a copy of the letter which Lord Weymouth\r\nhad sent to the magistrates, the letter in which Lord Weymouth had\r\npractically urged the magistrates to fire upon the people.  Wilkes\r\nimmediately sent it to the _St. James's Chronicle_, a tri-weekly\r\nindependent Whig journal which had been started in 1760.  The _St.\r\nJames's Chronicle_ printed the letter, and Wilkes's own letter\r\naccompanying it, in which he accused the Ministry of having planned and\r\ndetermined upon the \"horrid massacre of St. George's Fields.\"  The\r\nletter, said Wilkes, \"shows how long a hellish project can be brooded\r\nover by some infernal {125} spirits without one moment's remorse.\"  It\r\nmay be admitted that if the language of Wilkes's enemies in the two\r\nHouses was strong even to ruffianism, Wilkes could and did give them as\r\ngood as he got in the way of invective and vituperation.\r\n\r\nThe Government, goaded into fury by this daring provocation, resolved\r\nto make an example of the offender.  Lord Barrington brought the letter\r\nformally before the House of Commons.  The House of Commons immediately\r\nvoted it a libel, and summoned Wilkes from his prison to the bar of the\r\nHouse.  On February 3, 1769, Wilkes appeared before the Commons.  With\r\nperfect composure he admitted the authorship of the letter to the _St.\r\nJames's Chronicle_, and, with an audacity that exasperated the House,\r\nhe proclaimed his regret that he had not expressed himself upon the\r\nsubject in stronger terms, and added that he should certainly do so\r\nwhenever a similar occasion should present itself.  \"Whenever,\" he\r\nsaid, \"a Secretary of State shall dare to write so bloody a scroll, I\r\nwill through life dare to write such prefatory remarks, as well as to\r\nmake my appeal to the nation on the occasion.\"  Wilkes found champions\r\nin the House of Commons.  Burke, Beckford, and many others either\r\ndefended Wilkes or urged that the matter was not for the House of\r\nCommons, but for the law courts to deal with.  In the division the\r\nGovernment was triumphant by a majority of 219 against 137, and Wilkes\r\nwas formally expelled from the House of Commons on the ground, not\r\nmerely of his comments on the letter of Lord Weymouth, but on account\r\nof the Number Forty-five of the _North Briton_ and the \"Essay on Woman.\"\r\n\r\nA new writ was issued for the county of Middlesex.  The county of\r\nMiddlesex promptly re-elected Wilkes without opposition on February 16.\r\nOn February 17 the House of Commons again voted the expulsion of\r\nWilkes.  This time the House of Commons exceeded its powers and its\r\nprivileges in adding that the expelled man was incapable of sitting in\r\nthe existing Parliament.  Every blow that the royal party had struck at\r\nWilkes had only aroused stronger sympathy for him; and this illegal\r\nact, this usurpation {126} by one House of powers that only belonged to\r\nParliament, caused the liveliest indignation.  It was resolved by the\r\nfriends of Wilkes, and by all who were the friends of the principles\r\nwith which Wilkes had come to be identified, to fight to the utmost in\r\ndefence of their constitutional rights, that were now so gravely, so\r\nwantonly jeopardized.  On March 16 there was a new polling at\r\nBrentford, and, as before, Wilkes was returned unopposed.  There was,\r\nindeed, an effort made by an obscure merchant named Dingley to oppose\r\nhim, but he could find no freeholder to second him, and he was chivied\r\nignominiously from the scene of the election.  On March 17 the House of\r\nCommons, for the third time, played what Burke called the tragi-comedy\r\nof declaring the election void.  A new writ was again issued, and this\r\ntime the Ministry were resolved that, come what come might, Wilkes\r\nshould have an opponent.  It was not the easiest of tasks to find a man\r\nwilling to oppose Wilkes's candidature on the hustings at Brentford.\r\nDingley, the merchant, had experienced the violence of the mob; it was\r\nconfidently assumed that any other antagonist would fare very much\r\nworse.  But the Ministry found their champion in a young officer,\r\nColonel Luttrell, of the Guards, a son of Lord Irnham.  Luttrell was a\r\ngallant young soldier, a man of that temper which regards all popular\r\nagitations with supreme disdain, and of that courage that would face\r\nany danger, not merely with composure, but with pleasure.  His friends\r\nwere so apprehensive that he was going to his death that his life was\r\ninsured, and the gentlemen of the clubs, who were always willing to bet\r\nupon any imaginable contingency, betted freely on his chances of\r\nsurviving his adventure.  Wilkes's friends, however, were resolved to\r\ndisappoint the expectations of their enemies.  Thanks to their energy\r\nand patience, the election went off with perfect order.  Wilkes was, of\r\ncourse, returned at the top of the poll by an enormous majority.\r\nLuttrell came next with less than a quarter of his votes, and an absurd\r\nattorney, who had thrust himself into the election at the last moment,\r\ncame last with a ludicrous poll of five votes.\r\n\r\n{127}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1769--Lord North and the Wilkes case]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, April 13, Wilkes was elected.  London was again\r\nilluminated, and a great demonstration outside the King's Bench Prison\r\ncongratulated the hero of the hour on his third triumph.  On the\r\nfollowing day the House of Commons prepared again to reject Wilkes.\r\nThe debate lasted over the Saturday--a rare event in those days--and in\r\nthe early dawning of Sunday morning Colonel Luttrell was declared to be\r\nduly elected as the member for Middlesex.  The ministerial victory was\r\nnot a very great victory.  They had only a majority of 197 votes to\r\n143.  It served their turn at a pinch, but it was not a big enough\r\nmajority to inspire Lord North with the courage to resist a proposal\r\nthat a fortnight should be allowed to the electors of Middlesex in\r\nwhich, if they wished, to petition against conduct which practically\r\ndeprived them of their constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nLord North had many years of public life before him, many years of\r\nslumbering and blundering on the treasury bench, before his death in\r\n1792, as Lord Guildford, in a melancholy, premature old age.  In those\r\nyears he was privileged to do a vast amount of injury to his country,\r\nuncompensated for by any act to her advantage.  Lord North's conduct in\r\nthe case of Wilkes was not the most foolish act in a career of folly,\r\nbut it certainly served as an illuminating preface to a chronicle of\r\nwasted time.  No proofs of the wit that endeared him to his\r\ncontemporaries have been preserved; his fame for an unalterable\r\nurbanity is but an empty memory; his record is only rescued from\r\noblivion by the series of incredible follies which began with the\r\nunjust attempt to annihilate Wilkes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{128}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OP JUNIUS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1769--The Letters of Junius]\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on a new force suddenly made itself felt in\r\nEnglish political life.  The King and his ministers found themselves\r\nattacked by a mysterious and dangerous opponent.  On March 21, 1769, a\r\nletter was addressed to the _Public Advertiser_, signed \"Junius,\" which\r\nmarked the beginning of a new era in political literature.  At that\r\ntime the _Public Advertiser_ was the most important paper in London.\r\nIt had first appeared under that name in 1752, but it was the direct\r\ndescendant, through a series of changes of name, of the _Daily Post_,\r\nwhich Defoe had helped to start in 1719.  It had its rivals in the\r\n_Daily Advertiser_, which was founded in 1724, and the _Gazetteer_ and\r\n_New Daily Advertiser_, which was started in 1728.  In the course of\r\ntime both these journals had sunk to be little more than advertising\r\nsheets.  They gave hardly any news, and they had no political\r\ninfluence.  The _Public Advertiser_ was a much more important paper.\r\nIt gave abundance of foreign and domestic intelligence, it had original\r\ncontributions in prose and verse, and its columns were always open to\r\nletters from correspondents of all kinds on all manner of subjects.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the first letter signed with the signature of Junius\r\nappeared that the paper assumed a serious political importance.  The\r\nwriter, whoever he was, who chose that signature had written before in\r\nthe columns of the _Public Advertiser_.  In 1767 Woodfall, the\r\npublisher, received the first letter from the correspondent who was to\r\nbecome so famous, and from time to time other letters came signed by\r\nvarious names taken from classical nomenclature, such as Mnemon,\r\nAtticus, Lucius, Brutus, {129} Domitian, Vindex, and, perhaps,\r\nPoplicola.  But it was with the adoption of the name of Junius that the\r\nreal importance of the letters began.  They came at a crisis; they\r\nspoke for the popular side; they spoke with a bitterness and a ferocity\r\nthat had hitherto not been attempted in political journalism.  The\r\ngreat French writer Taine has said that the letters of Junius, at a\r\ntime of national irritation and anxiety, fell one by one like drops of\r\nfire on the fevered limbs of the body politic.  He goes on to say that\r\nif Junius made his phrases concise, and selected his epithets, it was\r\nnot from a love of style, but in order the better to stamp his insult.\r\nOratorical artifices in his hand became instruments of torture, and\r\nwhen he filed his periods it was to drive the knife deeper and surer,\r\nwith an audacity of denunciation and sternness of animosity, with a\r\ncorrosive and burning irony applied to the most secret corners of\r\nprivate life, with an inexorable persistence of calculated and\r\nmeditated persecution.\r\n\r\nThe first few letters of Junius were devoted to an altercation with Sir\r\nWilliam Draper over the character in the first place of Lord Granby and\r\nin the second place of Lord Granby's defender, Sir William Draper.  Sir\r\nWilliam, though he fought stoutly for his friend and stoutly for\r\nhimself, did neither himself nor his friend much good by engaging in\r\nthe controversy.  He was no match for the weapons of Junius.  He had\r\nneither the wit nor the venom of his antagonist.  But the great\r\ninterest of the letters began when Junius, taking up the cause of\r\nWilkes, struck at higher game than Sir William Draper or Lord Granby.\r\nHis first letter to the Duke of Grafton was an indictment of the Duke\r\nfor the conduct of the Crown in the case of a murder trial arising out\r\nof the Brentford election.  A young man named George Clarke had been\r\nkilled in a riot and a man named Edward M'Quirk was tried and found\r\nguilty of the murder.  A kind of hugger-mugger inquest produced a\r\ndeclaration that Clarke's death was not caused by the blow he had\r\nreceived from his assailant, and in consequence, \"whereas a doubt had\r\narisen in our royal breast,\" the King formally pardoned the murderer by\r\nroyal {130} proclamation.  On this theme Junius lashed Grafton and\r\nconcluded his letter with a direct allusion to Wilkes.  He asked if\r\nGrafton had forgotten, while he was withdrawing this desperate wretch\r\nfrom that justice which the laws had awarded and which the whole people\r\nof England demanded, that there was another man, the favorite of his\r\ncountry, whose pardon would have been accepted with gratitude, whose\r\npardon would have healed all divisions.  \"Have you quite forgotten that\r\nthis man was once your Grace's friend?  Or is it to murderers only that\r\nyou will extend the mercy of the Crown?\"\r\n\r\nThe attack thus daringly begun was steadily maintained.  Wilkes had no\r\nkeener, no acuter champion than Junius.  With great skill Junius\r\navoided all appearance of violent partisanship.  He was careful to\r\ncensure much in Wilkes's conduct, careful to discriminate between\r\nWilkes's private character and Wilkes's public conduct.  The\r\nunjustifiable action of the House of Commons in forcing Colonel\r\nLuttrell upon the electors of Middlesex gave Junius the opportunity of\r\nassailing Wilkes's enemies without appearing to champion Wilkes to the\r\nutterance.  Junius admitted that the Duke of Grafton might have had\r\nsome excuse in his opposition to Wilkes on account of Wilkes's\r\ncharacter, and might have earned the approval of men who, looking no\r\nfurther than to the object before them, were not dissatisfied with\r\nseeing Mr. Wilkes excluded from Parliament.  But, Junius went on to\r\nargue, \"you have now taken care to shift the question; or, rather, you\r\nhave created a new one, in which Mr. Wilkes is no more concerned than\r\nany other English gentleman.  You have united the country against you\r\non one grand constitutional point, on the decision of which our\r\nexistence as a free people absolutely depends.  You have asserted, not\r\nin words but in fact, that representation in Parliament does not depend\r\nupon the choice of the freeholders.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1769--The identity of Junius]\r\n\r\nThe authorship of the letters of Junius is one of those problems, like\r\nthe problems of the identity of the Man in the Iron Mask, which have\r\nnever been settled with absolute certainty and which probably never\r\nwill be settled {131} with absolute certainty.  But between absolute\r\ncertainty and the highest degree of probability there is no very great\r\ngulf fixed, and it is in the highest degree probable that the author of\r\nthe letters was Philip Francis.  The letters have been attributed to\r\nall manner of men.  They were ascribed, absurdly enough, to Wilkes.\r\nWilkes could write bitterly and he could write well, but he could write\r\nneither so well nor so bitterly as Mr. Woodfall's correspondent.  Dr.\r\nJohnson, who ought to have known better, thought they were written by\r\nBurke.  It is his excuse that there did not seem at the time any man of\r\nthe same ability as the writer of the letters except Burke.  But Dr.\r\nJohnson, who had been quick enough to recognize the genius of the\r\nanonymous author of the essay on \"The Sublime and the Beautiful,\" erred\r\nwhen he thought that the same hand penned the anonymous letters.  The\r\nprose of Burke was as far above the prose of Junius as the prose of\r\nJunius was above the prose of Wilkes.  None of the letters surpasses in\r\nferocity, none approaches in excellence the letter which Burke wrote to\r\nthe noble Duke who had slandered him.  The letters were attributed to\r\nBarré; they were attributed to Lee, who was yet to earn another kind of\r\nfame; they were attributed to many hands.  To us, at least, it seems\r\nclear that they were the work of Philip Francis.\r\n\r\nThe electors of Middlesex did petition against the substitution of the\r\ndespised Luttrell for the adored Wilkes.  The consideration of the\r\npetition was the occasion for one of the most memorable debates that\r\ncan be recorded of an age rich in memorable debates.  On the one side\r\nthe influence of the Ministry and the influence of the King induced\r\nBlackstone to deny himself and to falsify those principles of\r\nconstitutional law with which his name is associated.  On the other\r\nside principles as little honorable but a far acuter political\r\nperception urged Wedderburn, who was nominally a King's man, to go over\r\nto the popular cause with the air of a Coriolanus.  On the one side\r\nFletcher Norton upheld the authority of the resolution.  On the other\r\nside George Grenville argued against it with an acumen which showed\r\nthat an able lawyer might have {132} been a great lawyer.  In that\r\nfamous debate Burke spoke at his best, and yet the event of that debate\r\nwas not the speech of Burke, was not the speech of the experienced\r\npolitician, of the seasoned statesman, of the famous man of letters,\r\nbut the speech of a young man who was almost a boy, the speech of\r\nCharles James Fox.  All who have written on the debate agree in their\r\nadmiration of the speech of one who, as far as Parliament was\r\nconcerned, was but a raw lad and who nevertheless held his own on a\r\npoint of law against experienced lawyers, in statesmanship against\r\nGrenville, and in eloquence against Burke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1769--Unpopularity of George the Third]\r\n\r\nOf course the petition of Middlesex was rejected; the election of\r\nLuttrell was confirmed.  On the day of the confirmation the King\r\nprorogued Parliament in a foolish speech in which he seemed to think\r\nthat he had gained a victory.  But if the King and the Ministry\r\nbelieved or hoped that in expelling Wilkes from Parliament they had got\r\nrid of Wilkes for good and all; if they believed or hoped that in thus\r\ndegrading Wilkes they would deprive him of his popularity with the\r\npeople or even diminish that popularity, they were speedily to be\r\nundeceived and bitterly disappointed.  Both King and ministers knew\r\ntheir business very badly; with limitations of intelligence which would\r\nhave been disastrous to the conduct of a small shop, they came in this\r\ninstance, as in other instances, within measurable distance of wrecking\r\na royalty.  It is probable that Franklin, shrewd, cool observer though\r\nhe was, went too far when he wrote in his journal that if George the\r\nThird had had a bad private character, and John Wilkes a good one, the\r\nlatter might have turned the former out of his kingdom.  But it is\r\ncertain that the signs of the King's unpopularity were now as\r\nsignificant as were the signs of Wilkes's popularity.  It had been said\r\nthat at this time a good half of the King's subjects preferred Wilkes\r\nto their King.  The estimate is probably under rather than above the\r\nfact.  Wilkes was placed in the position of being the champion of all\r\nthe rights and liberties that Englishmen most prized; the King in the\r\n{133} position of being their most uncompromising, most obstinate\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nThus, while honors were offered daily to the prisoner of the King's\r\nbench, insults were daily offered to his royal enemy.  The King could\r\nscarcely go abroad without becoming the object of a demonstration of\r\npopular disfavor, and even in his palace he could not escape from\r\ndeputations empowered to protest against the conduct of his ministers.\r\nIn all parts of the kingdom public meetings were held, and from these\r\npublic meetings petitions poured in upon the King calling upon him to\r\ndissolve his Parliament.  It has been truly observed that the custom of\r\nholding public meetings for the discussion of public grievances dates\r\nfrom this period.  On two solemn occasions the Lord Mayor of London,\r\naccompanied by the sheriffs, presented addresses to the King\r\nremonstrating against the action of the House of Commons.  To the first\r\naddress the King replied that it was disrespectful to him, injurious to\r\nParliament, and irreconcilable to the principles of the Constitution.\r\nAfter which reply he could think of nothing better, nothing more kingly\r\nto do than to turn round to his courtiers and burst out laughing.  He\r\ntreated the second address with the same insolence, an insolence which\r\nprovoked from the Lord Mayor an uncourtierly reply which reminded the\r\nKing that those who endeavored to alienate the King's affections from\r\nhis subjects were violators of the public peace and betrayers of the\r\nConstitution established by the glorious Revolution.  Those words were\r\nafterwards inscribed in gold upon the monument of the mayor who spoke\r\nthem.  If those words, and words of like purport and temper, at first\r\nmoved the King to laughter, they soon exasperated him past laughing.\r\nOnce he clapped his hand to his sword-hilt and declared that he would\r\nsooner have recourse to that than grant a dissolution.  The tension of\r\npublic feeling can best be estimated when a constitutional sovereign on\r\nthe one side could dare to make such a remark; when a representative of\r\nthe people like Colonel Barré on the other side could dare in the House\r\nof {134} Commons to say that disregard of public petitions might lead\r\nthe people to think of assassination.\r\n\r\nWhile the King was insulted and insulting, and longing to stifle\r\nopposition by the sword, John Wilkes in his prison was receiving new\r\nproofs of the place he held in public affection.  He was elected\r\nalderman for the Ward of Farringdon Without.  We are told that his\r\ntable at the prison was daily supplied with the most rare and costly\r\ndelicacies, presented to him by his admirers.  The mysterious Chevalier\r\nd'Eon sent him a present of Russian smoked tongues, with the whimsical\r\nwish that they could have the eloquence of Cicero, and the delicacy of\r\nVoltaire, to do him honor.  Friendly revellers sent him hampers of the\r\nwine he liked the best.  More serious gifts were laid at his feet.  For\r\na while money literally rained in upon him.  The leading Whigs provided\r\nhim with an income.  Nobles and great ladies sent him large sums.  A\r\nnumber of politicians banded together under the title of the Society\r\nfor Supporting the Bill of Rights, and raised a great deal of money,\r\nmuch of which went in meeting some of the heavy debts with which Wilkes\r\nwas embarrassed, much of which went in keeping up the princely way of\r\nliving which suited Wilkes's temperament, and which was perhaps not\r\nunsuited to the part he was playing as the rival of a prince.  In the\r\npublic press, on the platform, on the stage, his influence was\r\nenormous.  His good pleasure sent politicians to Parliament; his good\r\npleasure made London sheriffs, made provincial mayors.  While the false\r\nrumor that he was the author of \"The Letters of Junius\" only swelled\r\nthe volume of his fame, the author of those letters was adding to\r\nWilkes's pride and power by public championship and by private letters,\r\nchoking with an adulation that seems strange indeed from so savage a\r\npen.  If Garrick dared for a moment to run counter to popular feeling,\r\nas a little earlier he had dared to disdain the praise of Churchill, he\r\nhad to give way in the case of Wilkes, as he had given way in the case\r\nof Wilkes's poet.  The very name of Wilkes drove men on both sides of\r\nthe quarrel into a kind of frenzy.  Alexander Cruden, of the\r\n\"Concordance,\" {135} showed his devotion to his King and his dislike of\r\nWilkes by carrying a large sponge with him whenever he walked abroad in\r\norder that he might wipe out the ominous number, forty-five, whenever\r\nhe saw it chalked up.  As the number was chalked up everywhere by the\r\nWilkites, Cruden soon found the task beyond his powers.  It was lucky\r\nfor him that he got no harm in his zeal, lucky for him that he did not\r\ncome across that militant clergyman who pulled the nose of a Scotch\r\nnaval officer for attacking Wilkes and then met his man in Hyde Park\r\nand wounded him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1770--A fight for the liberty of the Press]\r\n\r\nOn April 17, 1770, Wilkes's term of imprisonment came to an end.\r\nWilkes immediately started for Bath to avoid a demonstration in London;\r\nbut London was illuminated in his honor, and in a great number of\r\nprovincial towns his release was celebrated with all the signs of a\r\nnational holiday.  If he had been a hero in prison, he was no less a\r\nhero out of it.  He moved from triumph to triumph.  While alderman he\r\nwon a victory over the Court and the Commons which did much to\r\nestablish the liberty of the press in England.  The House of Commons,\r\nin a foolish attempt to suppress reports of the debates in Parliament,\r\ntried to arrest certain printers.  Wilkes and the Lord Mayor took the\r\nprinters' part; advised them to conceal themselves; and in their turn\r\narrested those who, in obedience to a royal proclamation and the orders\r\nof the House, arrested the printers.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons committed the Lord Mayor and Alderman Oliver to\r\nthe Tower, and summoned Wilkes to appear at the bar.  Wilkes coolly\r\nreplied that as he was a member of Parliament, and as he was not\r\naddressed as a member of Parliament should be, and ordered to attend in\r\nhis place according to custom, he should ignore the summons.  The House\r\nmade a second and yet a third order for his appearance, each of which\r\nWilkes treated with disdain.  It is a significant proof of the power of\r\nWilkes's popularity that the House did not take any steps to punish his\r\ncontumacy.  While it affected to find a consolation in the assurances\r\nof the King that Wilkes was \"below the {136} notice of the House,\" it\r\nhad to endure as best it might an affront resentment of which would\r\nonly have added to Wilkes's popularity.  The honors paid to the Lord\r\nMayor and the alderman during their imprisonment showed only too\r\nplainly that hostility to the Court and the Parliamentary majority was\r\nheroism in the eyes of the majority of the citizens of London.\r\n\r\nOnce again Wilkes had won the day.  From that time forward Parliament\r\nput no embargo upon the publication of reports of its debates.  Fresh\r\nhonors were showered on Wilkes.  He was elected sheriff.  He was\r\npresented by the Court of Common Council with a silver goblet, designed\r\naccording to his own wish with a representation of the death of Caesar,\r\nand graced with the ominous motto from one of the poems of Churchill:\r\n\r\n        May every tyrant feel\r\n  The keen deep searchings of a patriot steel,\r\n\r\na citation which, taken in conjunction with Barré's wild talk in the\r\nHouse about assassination, was sufficiently significant of the temper\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1774--Wilkes Lord Mayor of London]\r\n\r\nWilkes had been alderman; he had been sheriff; he was now to bear the\r\ncrown of civic honors.  He was put in nomination for the office of Lord\r\nMayor.  The Court party made a desperate effort to defeat him.  They\r\nhad tried and failed to prevent him from being elected to Parliament.\r\nThey had tried and failed to prevent him from being made alderman, from\r\nbeing made sheriff.  They now tried with all their might to prevent him\r\nfrom being made Lord Mayor.  Wilkes had much to fight against.  There\r\nwere defections from his own party.  The once devoted Horne had\r\nsquabbled with his idol over money matters, and was now as venomous an\r\nenemy as he had been a fulsome partisan.  Alderman Townshend, an\r\nex-Lord Mayor, strained all his influence, which was great in the City,\r\nagainst Wilkes.  A wild rumor got about at one time, indeed, that\r\nTownshend had settled the difficulty of the Court forever by\r\nchallenging Wilkes and shooting him dead.  The story had no foundation,\r\nbut for a moment it flattered the hopes of Wilkes's {137} enemies and\r\nfluttered the hearts of Wilkes's friends.  The opposition ended as\r\nopposition to Wilkes always ended.  Twice he was placed at the head of\r\nthe poll, and twice the Court of Aldermen chose another candidate.  The\r\nthird time, in the election of 1774, Wilkes was at last chosen as Lord\r\nMayor by the Court of Aldermen in despite of the unwearied efforts of\r\nthe Court party to defeat him.  \"Thus,\" wrote Walpole, \"after so much\r\npersecution by the Court, after so many attempts upon his life, after a\r\nlong imprisonment in jail, after all his own crimes and indiscretions,\r\ndid this extraordinary man, of more extraordinary fortune, attain the\r\nhighest office in so grave and important a city as the capital of\r\nEngland, always reviving the more opposed and oppressed, and unable to\r\nshock Fortune and make her laugh at him who laughed at everybody and\r\neverything!\"  It has been well said by Mr. Fraser Rae that the\r\nsignificance of election to the office of Lord Mayor was very much\r\ngreater more than a hundred years ago than it is now.  Then the Chief\r\nMagistrate of the City was not necessarily a man who had passed through\r\ncertain minor offices and who rose by routine to fill the highest.  At\r\nthat time the Corporation was a political power, which ministers had to\r\ntake into account, and which sovereigns had to propitiate.  A greater\r\ntriumph than the mayoralty followed in quick succession.  At the\r\ngeneral election of 1774 Wilkes came forward again, and for the fifth\r\ntime, as candidate for Middlesex.  This time he was not opposed.\r\nLuttrell abandoned an impossible position and did not stand.  Ten years\r\nafter Wilkes's first appearance in the House of Commons he returned to\r\nit again in triumph as the member for Middlesex and the Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nAnd here, on the top of his triumph, Wilkes may be said to drop through\r\nthe tissue of our history.  He was to live nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury longer, three-and-twenty years of a life that was as calm and\r\npeaceful as the hot manhood that preceded it had been vexed and\r\nunquiet.  Although he lives in history as one of the most famous of the\r\nworld's agitators, he had in his heart little affection {138} for the\r\nlife of a public man.  And the publicity of the civic official was\r\nespecially distasteful to him.  He hated the gross festivals, the gross\r\npleasures, the gross display of City life.  He sickened of the long\r\nhours spent in the business of mayoralty; he sickened yet more of the\r\npleasures incidental to mayoralty.  Though he remained in Parliament\r\nfor many years, and conducted himself there with zeal, discretion, and\r\nstatesmanship, and always, or almost always, proved himself to be the\r\nchampion of liberty and the democratic principle, he did not find his\r\ngreatest happiness in public speeches and the triumphs and defeats of\r\nthe division lobby.  What he loved best on earth was the society of his\r\ndaughter, between whom and himself there existed a friendship that is\r\nthe best advocate for Wilkes's character.  And he loved best to enjoy\r\nthat society in the kind of sham classic retirement which had so\r\npowerful an attraction for so many of the men of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.  His cottage in the Isle of Wight, with its Doric column to\r\nthe manes of Churchill, with its shrine to Fortuna Redux, was his idea\r\nof the ancient city of Tusculum.\r\n\r\nHis tastes and pleasures were the tastes and pleasures of a man of\r\nletters.  He affected a curious kind of scholarship.  The hand that had\r\nbeen employed upon the _North Briton_, now devoted itself to the\r\nediting of classic texts; the intellect that had been associated with\r\nthe privately printed \"Essay on Woman\" was now associated with\r\nprivately printed editions of Catullus which he fondly believed to be\r\nflawless, and of Theophrastus, whose Greek text it pleased him to print\r\nwithout accents.  In his tranquil old age he made himself as many\r\nfriends as in his hot manhood he had made himself enemies.  Those who\r\nhad most hated him came under the spell of his attraction, even the\r\nKing himself, even Dr. Johnson.  His interview with Dr. Johnson is one\r\nof the most famous episodes in the literary and political history of\r\nthe last century.  His assurance to King George that he himself had\r\nnever been a Wilkite is in one sense the truest criticism that has ever\r\nbeen passed upon him.  If to be a Wilkite was to entertain {139} all\r\nthe advanced and all the wild ideas expressed by many of those who took\r\nadvantage of his agitation, then certainly Wilkes was none such.  But\r\nhe was a Wilkite in the better sense of being true to his own opinions\r\nand true to his sense of public duty.  When he expressed the wish to\r\nhave the words \"A friend to liberty\" inscribed upon his monument, he\r\nexpressed a wish which the whole tenor of his life, the whole tone of\r\nhis utterances fully justified.  And if he was loyal to his principles\r\nhe could be chivalrous to his enemies.  Almost his last public\r\nappearance was at the general election of 1796, when he came forward,\r\nwith a magnanimity which would have well become many a better man, to\r\nsupport the candidature of Horne Tooke at Westminster, of the man who,\r\nafter having been his fawning friend, his fulsome flatterer, had turned\r\nagainst him with the basest treachery and the bitterest malignity.\r\nThere may have been, surely there must have been, a vein of irony in\r\nthe words in which Wilkes complimented the apostate and the turncoat as\r\na man of public virtues.  But the irony was cloaked by courtesy; if the\r\naction smacked of the cynic, at least it was done in obedience to the\r\nbehest to forgive our enemies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1797--Death of Wilkes]\r\n\r\nOn November 38, 1797, the old, worn, weary man, who had worked so hard\r\nand done so much, welcomed, in his capacity of Chamberlain of the City\r\nof London, Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson to the honorary freedom of the\r\nCity.  The setting star saluted the rising star.  Nelson was then\r\nthirty-nine.  He had been at sea since he was twelve.  He had voyaged\r\nin polar seas and tropic waters.  He had fought the Americans.  He had\r\nfought the French.  \"Hate a Frenchman as you would the devil\" was his\r\nsimple-minded counsel of perfection.  He had fought the Spaniards.  He\r\nhad lost an eye at Calvi.  He had lost an arm at Santa Cruz.  He was\r\nten years married.  His love, his error, his glory, Emma Hamilton,\r\nCarracioli, Trafalgar, were yet to come.\r\n\r\nLess than a month later, in the late December, 1797, John Wilkes was\r\ndead.  He was seventy years old.  For nearly forty years he had lived\r\nunknown, unheeded.  For {140} ten years he was the most conspicuous man\r\nin England, the best hated and the best loved.  For twenty years more\r\nhe was an honored public and private citizen.  He will always be\r\nremembered as one of the most remarkable men of a century of remarkable\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{141}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nCHARLES JAMES FOX.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1749-1768--A champion of popular rights]\r\n\r\nOne of the most immediate results of the Wilkes controversy in the\r\nHouse of Commons was to draw attention to a young man who had entered\r\nParliament at the General Election of 1768 while he was still\r\nconsiderably under age.  The young member for Midhurst made himself\r\nconspicuous as the most impassioned opponent of Wilkes.  A strenuous\r\nsupporter of Luttrell outside the walls of Westminster, inside those\r\nwalls the boy who represented the fictitious constituency of Midhurst\r\ndistinguished himself by the easy insolence with which he assailed\r\nWilkes and the popular cause which Wilkes represented.  He delighted in\r\ninforming the delighted majority in the House that he, for his part,\r\n\"paid no regard whatever to the voice of the people.\"  When Burke\r\ncondescended to notice and to rebuke the impertinence of a youth of\r\nnineteen, he little thought that the lad whom he reproved would come to\r\nbe a far more extreme advocate of popular rights than he himself, or\r\nthat the chronicle of the century in recording the names of those who\r\nmade themselves prominent for the utterance of democratic opinions\r\nshould place the name of John Wilkes far below the name of Charles\r\nJames Fox.\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to imagine a worse training for a youth intended\r\nfor the service of his country and destined to contend for the honors\r\nof the State than the life that was lived by Charles James Fox from\r\nearly boyhood to early manhood.  It was not in the power of his father,\r\nHenry Fox, Lord Holland, to set before his son the example of a parent\r\nwhose public life was pure, admirable, and honorable.  But in the\r\ndomestic circle Lord Holland was {142} a very different man from the\r\ncorrupt and juggling politician known to the world.  In the domestic\r\ncircle his affections and his tendernesses were his most conspicuous\r\ntraits, and in the domestic circle he was as unfortunate for his\r\nchildren through his very virtues as outside it he was unfortunate by\r\nreason of his vices.  Fox was a loving husband, but he was an adoring\r\nfather, and the extremest zeal and warmth of his adoration was given to\r\nhis son Charles James.  The child was from the first precocious, alert,\r\nand gifted beyond his years, and the father fostered and flattered the\r\nprecocity with a kind of worship that proved, as it was bound to prove,\r\ndisastrous.  It seems to have been Henry Fox's deliberate belief that\r\nthe best way to bring up a spirited, gifted, headstrong child was to\r\ngratify every wish, surrender to every whim, and pander to every\r\npassion that ebullient youth could feel.  The anecdotes of the day teem\r\nwith tales of the fantastic homage that Fox paid to the desires and\r\nmoods of his imperious infant.  He made him his companion while he was\r\nstill in the nursery; he allowed him to be his master before he had\r\nfairly left it.  Never was the creed of Thelema acted upon more\r\nconsistently and persistently than by Lord Holland towards Charles\r\nJames Fox.  It is an astonishing proof of the strength and innate\r\ngoodness of the childish nature that it was not ruined outright,\r\nhopelessly and helplessly, by the worst training ever given to a son by\r\na father.  That it did Fox infinite harm cannot be denied and was only\r\nto be expected.  That it failed entirely to unbalance his mind and\r\ndestroy his character only serves to show the sterling temper of Fox's\r\nmetal.  His youth was like his childhood, petted, spoiled, wayward,\r\ncapricious, and captivating.  Every one loved him, his father, his\r\nfather's friends, the school companions with whom he wrote Latin verses\r\nin praise of lovely ladies with lovely names.  All through his life the\r\nlove of men and the love of women was given to him with a generosity\r\nthat was only equal to the lovable nature that compelled and commanded\r\nit.  His career is one record of unrivalled precocity.  As a child he\r\nhad been his father's friend rather than his father's plaything; as a\r\n{143} lad he was his father's travelling companion, and learned from\r\nthat father the pleasant art of sowing wild oats not with the hand but\r\nwith the whole sack.  He returned to England a proficient gambler, a\r\nfinished rake, the dear friend of famous men, the darling of beautiful\r\nwomen, to enter, before he was of age, upon that political career in\r\nwhich it seemed certain that if he would follow in his father's steps\r\nhe might hope for more than his father's fortunes.  If Charles Fox had\r\nbeen quite cankered by his father's care, if the essence of his genius\r\nhad been corruptible, he might have given the King's friends a leader\r\nas far removed from them as Lucifer from his satellites, and contrived\r\nperhaps--though that indeed would have been difficult--to amass almost\r\nas much money as he was able to spend with comfort.  To judge by the\r\nyoung man's initial enterprise, his Parliamentary career promised to be\r\nas brilliant and as brutal as any king who hated Chatham and hated\r\nWilkes and hated the American colonies could possibly desire.  The\r\nfurious intolerance of his maiden speech was happily, however, only\r\nlike that false dawn familiar to travellers in the East.  The true\r\nsunrise was yet to come.  But for six years he was as consistent in his\r\nsupport of Lord North and the policy that North represented as for the\r\nrest of his career he was consistent in opposition to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1768--Fox's scholarship]\r\n\r\nThe life of Fox recalls, in its brilliant activity, in its no less\r\nbrilliant scholarship, the dazzling careers of some of those Italian\r\nprinces who were equally at home and equally distinguished in the\r\nbattlefield and in the library, equally happy in handling their weapons\r\nor in turning the pages of the latest volume from the presses of Aldus\r\nthat renewed the youth of some masterpiece of Greece or Rome.  Fox's\r\nscholarship would have been remarkable in a man whose days and nights\r\nwere devoted to scholarship alone.  It was little less than marvellous\r\nin a man who gave a large part of his days to the fiercest political\r\nfights of a fiercely political age and a large part of his nights to\r\nthe fascination of the card-table, the disasters of the dice-box, and\r\nthe pursuit of the sweet, elusive shadow which is {144} called\r\npleasure.  Fox's love for literature was indeed its own reward.  In the\r\ndarkest hours of a life that tasted the bitterness of many public and\r\nmany private sorrows he could steep his vexed spirit in the sweet\r\nwaters watched by the Muses, and arise cleansed, inspirited, and\r\ncomforted.  Though he saw those public honors that his genius deserved\r\ndenied, though he lost those chances of command by which he could best\r\nhave served his country, though his own fault wrecked his fortune and\r\nhis own follies wasted his substance and delivered the home of his\r\nglorious youth into alien hands, he could turn from troubles that would\r\nhave broken the spirit and cracked the heart of a less heroic fighter,\r\nto find solace and consolation in the golden music of the \"Odyssey\" and\r\nthe majestic cadences of Virgil.\r\n\r\nFox loved the classics with the passion of a poet, not with the\r\npatience of a pedant, and found that noble rapture in the human beauty\r\nof Euripides which Parson Adams found in the divine grandeur of\r\nAeschylus.  But if his reading in the literatures of Greece and Rome\r\nwas wide and deep, it was not limited to the literatures which the\r\nworld calls classic.  France, Italy, Spain, offered him their best, and\r\nfound him a worthy worshipper, the faithful lover and loyal student of\r\nall that was best in each.  He was the comrade of Don Quixote as he was\r\nthe comrade of Orlando Furioso and the comrade of Gil Blas.  But he was\r\nnever one of those who exalt the laurels of other lands to the neglect\r\nof those of their own.  He knew English literature and loved English\r\nliterature as well as if he had never scanned a Latin line or\r\nconjugated a Greek verb or read a page of Molière, or Calderon, or\r\nMetastasio.  He knew Chaucer as well as it was possible for any one\r\nthen or for generations later to know Chaucer, and he appreciated him\r\nas few have appreciated him before or since.  The poets of his own time\r\nwere as dear to him in their degree as the singer of England's morning\r\nsong.  It is hardly necessary to say that he was as familiar with\r\nShakespeare as every one should be and as very few are.  Only one arc\r\nwas wanting to the circle of his splendid {145} culture, only one\r\nstring was lacking to the bow of his prodigious reading.  There was a\r\ngreat literature growing up in a neighboring country of which Charles\r\nFox knew nothing, and of which we cannot doubt that he would have\r\nrejoiced to know much.  It is curious that in a country which had been\r\nruled for three successive reigns by German sovereigns, the German\r\nlanguage was entirely neglected and the glorious dawn of German\r\nliterature entirely ignored.  While Fox was still a young man, playing\r\nat love, playing at cards, playing at politics, and through all these\r\ndiversions adding to that mighty store of learning, and training his\r\nmind in the finest and most intimate judgments upon the Greek and Roman\r\npoets, Germany had been enriched by the masterpiece of the greatest\r\ncritic since Aristotle, and was fostering the golden youth of the\r\ngreatest poet since Shakespeare.  It would have amazed Fox, as it would\r\nhave amazed every English scholar then living, if he could have been\r\ntold that the spirit of the antique world was to be renewed in a\r\ncountry which had given them four generations of phlegmatic princes,\r\nand in a language of which few scholars in England knew a single word.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1768--Fox's quarrel with Lord North]\r\n\r\nFox's term of adherence to North and to North's policy was not too\r\nhappy a time for the nominal superior.  A hot-headed young Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty resigned his office in a huff, and was not without difficulty\r\npersuaded to return to office as Commissioner of the Treasury.  The\r\nbreach between Fox and North was bridged over, but the bridge was\r\nfrail.  The two men eyed each other with disfavor.  Fox asserted his\r\nindependence by occasionally voting against the minister, by consorting\r\nwith Burke.  After the death of Lord Holland, North revenged himself by\r\ndismissing Fox from office in a letter famous for its insolent brevity.\r\nFor a time Fox still accorded to the ministry an uncertain support, but\r\nhe was drifting in thought and speech and action in the inevitable\r\ndirection of his genius.  The hour came when he took his seat on the\r\nOpposition benches, and asserted himself as a {146} formidable opponent\r\nof the Government.  A quarrel across the Atlantic gave him the\r\nopportunity to prove that the principles which men of to-day would call\r\nLiberal principles had gained one of their greatest and one of their\r\nmost eloquent champions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{147}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nON THE CHARLES RIVER.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765-74--Lord Hillsborough]\r\n\r\nWhile the battle had been raging over Wilkes at home, the cloud of\r\ntrouble had been growing larger and larger abroad.  The discontent of\r\nthe American colonies increased in direct ratio with the determination\r\nof the home Government to ignore or to override that discontent.  The\r\nKing was fortunate, or believed himself to be fortunate, in finding\r\namong his ministers the aptest instrument he could desire for striking\r\nat the Americans.  Lord Hillsborough, the Secretary of State, was one\r\nof those men who appear to be inspired by a very genius of perversity.\r\nHe had a power of misunderstanding a political situation and\r\nunderestimating a political crisis which, if it could only have been\r\nreversed, would have earned him a foremost place among the statesmen of\r\nhis time.  But his perversity was of like temper with the perversity of\r\nthe King, and Lord Hillsborough was admirably qualified to interpret\r\nthe King's dislike of his American subjects and to make himself the\r\nmouthpiece of the anti-Colonial feeling which had been steadily growing\r\nup in the House of Commons since the days when the repeal of the Stamp\r\nAct had known its season of brief popularity.\r\n\r\nThe comparative temperance and lucidity of the Rockingham period seemed\r\nnow indeed remote and memorable.  Exasperation and not conciliation\r\nappeared to be the persistent note of England's colonial policy.  It\r\nwas England's misfortune to be peculiarly ill served on both sides of\r\nthe Atlantic by those who were intrusted with the conduct of colonial\r\naffairs.  It would be hard to say whether the provincial governors\r\nabroad or the ministers at home were least capable of understanding the\r\npeople with whom they {148} had to deal, or were most to blame for\r\ntheir actions in the face of a danger that their own folly had brought\r\nabout.  With a man like Lord Hillsborough for Secretary of State in\r\nLondon, with a man like Bernard for Governor of Massachusetts in\r\nBoston, it is not to be wondered at now, and it ought not to have been\r\nwondered at then, that the colonies refused to crystallize into\r\ntranquillity.  Francis Bernard was a man of certain ability, certain\r\ngifts, and uncertain good intentions.  But he was, as we have seen, a\r\nperfervid Tory, a zealous champion of the royal prerogative, a profound\r\nbeliever in the wisdom of minimizing, if not abrogating, the privileges\r\nof which the colonists, and especially the colonists of Massachusetts,\r\nwere so proud.  It was Bernard's peculiar fortune to be not merely the\r\nsupporter but the adviser of the English Ministries in almost all the\r\nseries of disastrous actions towards their colonies.  Bernard was\r\ninspired by a kind of furious folly in his words and deeds.  Unhappily,\r\nthis kind of furious folly was not confined to the colonial governor.\r\nLord Hillsborough was no less foolish and no less dangerous than\r\nBernard.  Horace Walpole described Hillsborough as nothing more than a\r\npompous composition of ignorance and want of judgment.  He certainly\r\nwas hopelessly ignorant of America, and he certainly showed a hopeless\r\nwant of judgment in his dealings with the Americans.  Hillsborough\r\nbacked up Bernard in his blunders and his braggadocio with the light\r\nheart that comes of an empty head.  He backed up Bernard with a steady\r\nzeal that would have been splendid if it could have been made to serve\r\nany useful purpose.  Where Bernard was bellicose and blustering,\r\nHillsborough blustered and was bellicose in his turn.  It was\r\nHillsborough's honest, innate conviction that the American colonists\r\nwere a poor-spirited, feeble-hearted, and still more feeble-handed pack\r\nof rascals, braggarts whom a firm front discomfited, natural bondsmen\r\nto whom it was only necessary, as in the old classic story, to show the\r\nwhip to awe them into cringing submission.  This theory found its\r\nfittest formula a little later, when Hillsborough, speaking for the\r\nGovernment he adorned, and {149} inspired by a more than usual afflatus\r\nof folly, declared that \"we can grant nothing to the Americans except\r\nwhat they may ask with a halter round their necks.\"  It is difficult to\r\nbelieve that a reasonable minister, endowed with a sufficient degree of\r\nhuman ability to push his way from office to office and from title to\r\ntitle, could have known so little of the history of his own country and\r\nthe characteristics of his own countrymen as to think that any of\r\nEngland's children were easily to be frightened into ignominious\r\nsupplication.  But Hillsborough undoubtedly did think so, and he always\r\nacted consistently in support of his strong conviction that the\r\nindependent colonists were nothing more than a mob of cowardly\r\nmalcontents.  He acted on this conviction to such good purpose that his\r\nname has earned its place of honor with that of Grenville, of\r\nTownshend, and of Wedderburn, in the illustrious junta who were\r\nsuccessfully busy about the sorry business of converting a great empire\r\ninto a small one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1766--The Mutiny Act]\r\n\r\nAfter the Stamp Act had raised its crop of disturbance and disorder,\r\nthe Government extended to the colonies the measure called the Mutiny\r\nAct, for the quartering of troops and providing them with necessaries.\r\nThe Legislature of New York refused to execute this Act, on the ground\r\nthat it involved the very principle of taxation which had just been\r\nabandoned by the repeal of the Stamp Act.  It made provision for the\r\ntroops in its own way, and calmly ignored the Act of Parliament.\r\nParliament retorted in due course by passing a bill by which the\r\nGovernor, Council, and Assembly of New York were prevented from passing\r\nany law whatsoever until they had complied with the letter and the\r\nspirit of the Mutiny Act.  This measure was loudly applauded in\r\nEngland, even by some who had shown themselves very friendly to the\r\ngrievances of the colonists.  When New York found that her great deed\r\nwas too great, and, bending before the anger of Parliament, reluctantly\r\ncomplied with the terms of the Mutiny Act, there were not wanting\r\nobservers to point out that the lesson, though only addressed to one\r\ncolony, was of significance to all, and that an inevitable surrender\r\nwas the proof {150} of the hopeless inferiority of the colonies when\r\nbrought into direct contest with the supreme power.  These jubilations\r\nwere as short-lived as they were untimely.  If New York was weak and\r\nwavered, Massachusetts was more firm of purpose.  She sternly refused\r\nto comply with the terms of the Mutiny Act.  She went farther still in\r\ndefiance of the Government.  She issued a circular to the other\r\ncolonies, calling upon them very frankly and very clearly to co-operate\r\nin taking some united course for the purpose of obtaining redress for\r\nthe recent acts of the English Government.  This was the second\r\ninstance of deliberate combination for a definite end among the\r\ncolonies, and it caused much disquiet and more irritation to the\r\nGovernment.  Lord Hillsborough, always in favor of what he believed to\r\nbe firm measures, immediately sent Governor Bernard instructions to\r\nhave the offending circular rescinded.  Governor Bernard would have\r\nbeen only too glad to obey, but obedience was not easy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1770--The Boston massacre]\r\n\r\nBernard could command, but Massachusetts could refuse to give way.\r\nWhen Bernard retaliated by dissolving the Massachusetts Legislature,\r\ncolony after colony replied to his action by applauding the conduct of\r\nMassachusetts and condemning Lord Hillsborough.  The English Government\r\nanswered the protests of Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Georgia, and New\r\nYork by creating a new office especially to deal with the colonies, and\r\nby appointing Lord Hillsborough to fill the post.  Everything that\r\ncould be done on the English side of the Atlantic by those in power to\r\nshow those on the American side of the Atlantic that they might look in\r\nvain for justice or for consideration from authority was done.  Lord\r\nHillsborough was under the impression that a little firmness--what he\r\ncalled firmness--would soon bring the colonists to their senses, but\r\nevery mail that came across the Atlantic showed that Lord\r\nHillsborough's theory was unsupported by facts.  Now it was the news\r\nthat the seizure of John Hancock's sloop \"Liberty\" for a breach of the\r\nrevenue laws had brought about a riot in Boston in which the\r\nCommissioners of Revenue had to fly for their lives.  Now it was the\r\nnews of {151} a great convention in Faneuil Hall to protest against the\r\ntroops which Hillsborough, at the request of Bernard; poured into\r\nBoston.  Now it was the news of daily increasing hostility between the\r\ncitizens of Boston and the British soldiers quartered in the town.  It\r\nwas evident, even to Hillsborough, that a dangerous spirit had been\r\naroused in America, but he still believed that America could be easily\r\nfrightened or chastised into good behavior.  He proposed to enforce an\r\nold law of Henry the Eighth by which the colonists offending could be\r\nshipped across the Atlantic for trial in England.  All that was best\r\nand most eloquent in the House of Commons protested against such folly,\r\nand did not protest in vain.  Some small concessions were made in a\r\nhalf-hearted and grudging way to the Americans.  Governor Bernard was\r\nrecalled.  Some of the obnoxious taxes were repealed, though Lord North\r\nwas not to be persuaded to abandon the tax on tea.  These poor\r\nconcessions were made known to the colonists in a more than usually\r\nuncivil and injudicious letter from Lord Hillsborough.  The concessions\r\nwere too trivial and they came too late.  If Boston had its brief day\r\nof rejoicing when Bernard took his departure, the men of Boston were\r\nsoon to be occupied with other thoughts than of banners and bonfires.\r\nThe bad feeling between the people and the military grew worse, and at\r\nlast displayed itself in active hostility.  March 5, 1770, was a\r\nmemorable day in the history of Boston.  Three thousand miles away Lord\r\nNorth was moving in Parliament for the repeal of all the American\r\nduties with the single and fatal exception of the tax on tea.  In\r\nBoston a small quarrel between some of the citizens and certain British\r\ntroops under the command of Colonel Preston suddenly blazed up into a\r\ndangerous collision.  Some of the soldiers fired.  Several citizens\r\nwere killed, several more wounded.  There was an angry call to arms,\r\nand a general civil attack upon the military was only with difficulty\r\nprevented by the Lieutenant-Governor, who ordered the arrest and\r\nimprisonment of Colonel Preston and the soldiers under him.  These duly\r\nunderwent a trial whose conduct and whose issue reflect the highest\r\nhonor {152} upon Boston.  The soldiers were defended by no less\r\nprominent a man and conspicuous a patriot than John Adams; and, thanks\r\nto John Adams, Colonel Preston and six of his men were acquitted, and\r\nonly two of the soldiers convicted of manslaughter.  But if the people\r\nof Boston were willing that even their enemies should be tried fairly,\r\nand fairly acquitted, they were not willing to allow the events of that\r\nday to pass into oblivion.  A public funeral was accorded to the\r\nvictims of the Boston Massacre, and the grim name for a grim deed was\r\nfor long years later solemnly and publicly commemorated.\r\n\r\nThe bad news of the Boston Massacre was followed to England by the bad\r\nnews of the business of the \"Gaspee.\"  The \"Gaspee\" was an English\r\nwarship employed to enforce the Revenue Acts along the Rhode Island\r\ncoast.  Its commander, Lieutenant Duddington, took an active delight in\r\nhis duty which brought him into perpetual antagonism with a people who\r\nregarded elusion of the revenue laws as their privilege and\r\nprerogative.  One night the \"Gaspee,\" pursuing the Providence packet,\r\nthat had refused to lower her colors in salutation as she passed, ran\r\naground in shallow water and lay fast bound for the night.  The news of\r\nher insolence to the Providence packet and of her present plight flew\r\nabroad all over Providence.  After sundown a number of the townspeople\r\nof Providence, well armed and stern of purpose, rowed from the town to\r\nthe stranded \"Gaspee,\" boarded her, and overcame the ineffectual\r\nresistance of her crew.  In the scuffle Duddington was badly wounded.\r\nHis wounds were dressed: he and his men were put on shore with all\r\ntheir belongings, and then and there the \"Gaspee\" was set fire to and\r\nwatched till she was consumed.  Though a large money reward was offered\r\nfor the apprehension of the offenders, no one of the assailants was\r\never brought before the King's justice.\r\n\r\nMisfortunes like the Boston Massacre, disorders like the burning of the\r\n\"Gaspee,\" naturally increased the anti-colonial exasperation of the\r\nEnglish King and of ministers like North and Hillsborough.  North\r\nthought whatever {153} the King wished him to think.  Hillsborough\r\nstill believed that the Americans were only to be listened to when they\r\ncame with halters around their necks.  King George was convinced that\r\nthe New England mutineers would speedily prove to be lambs when England\r\nchose to play the lion.  At this moment of extreme tension something\r\nhappened which still further strained the relations between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1767--The letters of Hutchinson and Oliver]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1767, Hutchinson, who was then Governor-General of\r\nMassachusetts, and Oliver, the Lieutenant-Governor of the colony, wrote\r\ncertain letters to Whately, who was private secretary to George\r\nGrenville.  These were private letters, confidential letters.  Neither\r\nof the writers dreamed that they would ever become public possessions.\r\nThey were intended to inform and to advise a minister's secretary and\r\nthe minister himself.  In these letters Hutchinson and Oliver set forth\r\nvery fully and frankly their views as to the condition of the colonies\r\nand the better way of dealing with them.  Hutchinson and Oliver had\r\nsuffered much at the hands of the people of Boston.  It was chance\r\nrather than clemency which allowed them to escape with their lives on\r\nthat wild August day of 1765.  It is probable that their opinion of the\r\npopular party in Massachusetts was colored if not prejudiced by\r\nmemories of the Stamp Act riots.  Hutchinson and Oliver were all for\r\nstrong measures of repression and coercion.  To their minds the\r\ncolonies were allowed a great deal too much liberty; their people and\r\ntheir leaders were not nearly so sensible of the advantage of British\r\nsupremacy as they ought to be; they were forever asserting their own\r\nrights and privileges in a spirit that could only be properly met by a\r\nprompt and comprehensive curtailment of those rights and privileges.\r\nThe colonists were too free, too proud of their charters and\r\nconstitutions.  Hutchinson and Oliver, with that fine superiority to\r\ncharters and constitutions which characterized so many a royal\r\ngovernor, insisted that very considerable changes of government, all in\r\nthe direction of coercion, were necessary, in order to make the\r\nconceited colonists know their place and to keep {154} them in it.\r\nThese letters no doubt made their due impression upon Whately and upon\r\nGrenville.  Letters like them were always being despatched across the\r\nAtlantic by governors and deputy governors to persons of importance in\r\nEngland, pointing out how ungrateful the colonists were for their many\r\nblessings, and what a good thing it would be for them if a few of these\r\nblessings were taken away.  These letters had their influence upon the\r\npersons of importance to whom they were addressed.  They formed the\r\nminds of ministers; they fed the fancies of the King.  They served to\r\nbolster up the singular system of ignorance and incapacity which went\r\nby the name of colonial administration.\r\n\r\nOf course Hutchinson and Oliver and their kind thought that they were\r\nonly writing for ministerial eyes, that they were only whispering into\r\nroyal ears.  They no doubt assumed that their letters would be safely\r\npigeon-holed, or still more safely destroyed.  It did not occur to them\r\nthat they ever could or would be made public, and by their publication\r\nthrust new weapons into the hands of the men whose liberties they were\r\nso zealous to suppress.  But the unexpected often, if not always,\r\nhappens.  Whately died in the June of 1772, and after his death the\r\nletters he had received, and preserved, from Hutchinson and Oliver,\r\nwere somehow stolen.  We shall probably never know how they were stolen\r\nor by whom.  It was claimed in later years, but not proved, that Dr.\r\nHugh Williamson was the means of transmitting the letters to Franklin.\r\nAll that we know for certain is that they came into the hands of\r\nBenjamin Franklin, and that Benjamin Franklin believed it to be his\r\nduty as agent for Massachusetts to make them known to the colony he\r\nrepresented.  He was only allowed to do so under certain strict and\r\ndefinite conditions.  The source from which they came was to be kept\r\nabsolutely secret.  They were only to be shown to a few leading\r\ncolonists; they were to be neither printed nor copied, and they were to\r\nbe returned promptly.  Franklin accepted these conditions, and as far\r\nas was in his power observed them.  The source from which they came was\r\nkept a secret, is still a secret.  {155} But Franklin could not very\r\nwell enforce, perhaps did not very greatly desire to enforce, those\r\nconditions upon his friends on the other side of the Atlantic.  He\r\npointed out that, though they might not be printed or copied, they\r\nmight be talked about.  And talked about they were.  The knowledge of\r\nthem set all Boston afire with excitement, filling the colonists with\r\nindignation and their opponents with dismay.  The Massachusetts House\r\nof Assembly carried by a large majority a petition to the King, calling\r\nfor the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver as betrayers of their trust\r\nand enemies to the colony.  Hutchinson, soon made aware of the\r\npublicity given to the correspondence, demanded to see the letters that\r\nwere said to come from him.  The Assembly permitted this, but accorded\r\nthe permission with a show of distrust that was in itself the crudest\r\naffront.  A small committee was appointed to take the letters to\r\nHutchinson and to show him the letters in their presence, the\r\nimplication being that Hutchinson was not to be trusted with the\r\nletters except in the presence of witnesses.  Hutchinson had to submit\r\nto the insult; he had also to admit that the letters were genuine.  He\r\ngave, or was understood to give, permission that the letters might be\r\nmade public.  The letters were promptly made public.  Thousands of\r\ncopies were struck off and scattered broadcast all over the continent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1772--Temple and Whately fight a duel]\r\n\r\nEngland was scarcely less excited than America by the publication.\r\nThere was a general curiosity to know how the letters had been\r\npurloined and how they had been made public.  The Whately to whom the\r\nletters had been addressed had a brother, William Whately.  William\r\nWhately seems to have been alarmed lest it might be thought that he was\r\nin any way instrumental to the promulgation of the letters.  He\r\ndiverted any suspicion from himself by accusing another man of the\r\ntheft.  This other man was a Mr. John Temple, who had once had an\r\nopportunity of examining the papers of the late Mr. Whately.  Temple\r\nimmediately challenged his accuser; a duel was fought, and as far as\r\nordeal of battle went, Temple made good his innocence, for he wounded\r\nWilliam Whately.  At {156} this moment Franklin came forward.  He\r\nadmitted that the letters had come into his hands, and that he had\r\ndespatched them to America.  He declined to say how they did come into\r\nhis hands, but he solemnly asserted the absolute innocence of both\r\nTemple and Whately of any knowledge of or complicity in the\r\ntransaction.  A storm of popular anger broke upon Franklin.  He was\r\nregarded as a criminal, spoken of as a criminal, publicly denounced as\r\na criminal.  Wedderburn, the Solicitor-General, was his denunciator,\r\nand he chose for the place of his attack the House of Commons, and for\r\nthe hour the occasion of the presentation of the petition of\r\nMassachusetts for the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1772--Wedderburn's attack on Franklin]\r\n\r\nWedderburn assailed Franklin in a speech whose ability was only\r\nsurpassed by its ferocity.  In the presence of an illustrious audience,\r\nthat numbered among its members some of the most famous men of that\r\ntime or of any time, Wedderburn directed against Franklin a fluency of\r\ninvective, a fury of reproach that was almost splendid in its unbridled\r\nsavagery.  The Privy Councillors, with one exception, rocked with\r\nlaughter and revelled in applause as the Solicitor-General pilloried\r\nthe agent from the colony of Massachusetts Bay as a thief, well-nigh a\r\nmurderer, a man lost to all honor, all decency.  The one grave\r\nexception to the grinning faces of the Privy Councillors was the face\r\nof Lord North.  He sat fixed in rigidity, too well aware of all that\r\ndepended upon the glittering slanders of Wedderburn to find any matter\r\nof mirth in them.  Only one other man in all that assembly of genius\r\nand rank and fame and wit carried a countenance as composed as that of\r\nLord North, and that was the face of the man whom Wedderburn was\r\nbespattering with his ready venom.  Benjamin Franklin, dressed in a\r\ngala suit, unlike the sober habit that was familiar with him, stood at\r\nthe bar of the House and listened with an unconquerable calm to all\r\nthat Wedderburn had to say.  If it was the hour of Wedderburn's\r\ntriumph, it was not the hour of Franklin's humiliation.  He held his\r\nhead high and suffered no emotion to betray itself while Wedderburn\r\npiled insult upon insult, {157} and the majority of his hearers reeled\r\nin a rapture of approval.  But if Franklin listened with an unmoved\r\ncountenance, the words of Wedderburn were not without their effect upon\r\nhim.  He was human and the slanders stung him, but we may well believe\r\nthat they stung him most as the representative of the fair and\r\nflourishing colony whose petition was treated with the same insolence\r\nthat exhausted itself in attacking his honor and his name.\r\n\r\nThe clothes philosophy of Diogenes Teufelsdroch is readily annotated by\r\nhistory.  There are garments that have earned an immortality of fame.\r\nSuch an one is the sky-blue coat which Robespierre wore at the height\r\nof his power when he celebrated the festival of the Supreme Being, and\r\nin the depths of his degradation when a few days later he was carried\r\nto his death.  Such an one is the gala coat of flowered Manchester\r\nvelvet which Franklin wore in his day of degradation when he was\r\ncompelled to listen with a tranquil visage and a throbbing heart to the\r\nfluent invective of Wedderburn, and which was laid away and left unused\r\nthrough five tremendous years, not to be taken from its retirement\r\nuntil Franklin wore it again on the day of his greatest triumph, when\r\nhe signed that treaty with England which gave his country her place\r\namong the nations of the world.  Battles had been fought and won in the\r\nsaddest of civil wars, the trained and seasoned troops of Europe had\r\nlearned the lesson of defeat from levies of farmers, English generals\r\nhad surrendered to men of their own race and their own speech, and a\r\nnew flag floated over a new world between the day when Franklin went\r\nsmartly dressed to Westminster to hear Wedderburn do his best and\r\nworst, and the day when Franklin vent smartly dressed to Paris as the\r\nrepresentative of an independent America.  Franklin's flowered coat is\r\nno less eloquent than Caesar's mantle.\r\n\r\nThe man whom the Court party employed to deal the death-blow to\r\ncolonial hopes, and to overwhelm with insult and abuse the colonial\r\nagent, was a countryman and intimate friend of the detested Bute.\r\nAlexander Wedderburn attained the degree of eloquence with which he now\r\n{158} assailed Franklin at a cost of scarcely less pains than those\r\ndevoted by Demosthenes to conquer his defects.  He had a strong and a\r\nharsh Scotch accent, and neither the accent nor the race was grateful\r\nto the London of the eighteenth century.  Wedderburn's native tenacity\r\nenabled him in a great degree to overcome his native accent.  He toiled\r\nunder Thomas Sheridan and he toiled under Macklin the actor to attain\r\nthe genuine English accent, and his labors did not go unrewarded.\r\nBoswell writes that he got rid of the coarse part of his Scotch accent,\r\nretaining only so much of the \"native wood-note wild\" as to mark his\r\ncountry, \"which if any Scotchman should affect to forget I should\r\nheartily despise him,\" so that by degrees he formed a mode of speaking\r\nto which Englishmen did not deny the praise of eloquence.  Successful\r\nas an orator, secure in the patronage of the royal favorite, Wedderburn\r\nsought the society of the wits and was not welcomed by them.  Johnson\r\ndisliked him for his defective colloquial powers and for his supple\r\nreadiness to go on errands for Bute.  Foote derided him as not only\r\ndull himself, but the cause of dulness in others.  Boswell, who admired\r\nhis successful countryman, assumed that his unfavorable appearances in\r\nthe social world were due to a cold affectation of consequence, from\r\nbeing reserved and stiff.  The scorn of Johnson and the sneers of Foote\r\nwould not have saved him from oblivion; he owes his unlovely notoriety\r\nto his assault upon Franklin, with all its disastrous consequences.\r\nMany years later, when Wedderburn was Lord Loughborough and Chief\r\nJustice of the Common Pleas, a humorous editor dedicated to him\r\nironically a new edition of Franklin's \"Rules for Reducing a Great\r\nEmpire to a Small One.\"\r\n\r\nThe English Government was now resolved to show that it would temporize\r\nno longer with the factious colonists.  If in a spirit of rash and\r\nill-repaid good-nature it had repealed certain taxes, at least it would\r\nrepeal no more.  The tax on tea existed; the tax on tea would be\r\nenforced; the tax on tea should be respected.  The East India Company\r\nhad a vast quantity of tea which it desired {159} to sell.  It obtained\r\nfrom the Government the permission to export the tea direct to America\r\ninstead of being obliged to let it pass through the hands of English\r\nmerchants.  Under such conditions the tea could be sold very cheaply\r\nindeed in the colonies, and the Government hoped and believed that this\r\nvery cheapness would be a temptation too keen for the patriotism of a\r\ntea-drinking city to withstand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1773--The Boston \"Tea-party\"]\r\n\r\nIf the King and the East India Company were resolved to force their tea\r\nupon the American colonists, the Americans were no less stubborn in\r\ntheir resolution to refuse it.  The tea-ships sailed the seas,\r\nweathered the winds and waves of the Atlantic, only to be, as it were,\r\nwrecked in port.  The colonists in general, and especially the\r\ncolonists of Massachusetts, were resolved not to suffer the tea to be\r\nlanded, for they knew that once landed it could be sold so cheaply that\r\nit would be hard for many to resist the temptation to buy it.  Every\r\neffort was made to prevent the importation.  In many cases the\r\nconsignees were persuaded, not wholly without menace, to make public\r\nengagement to relinquish their appointments.  Pilots were advised as\r\npatriots to lend no aid to the threatened importation; indeed, it was\r\npretty plainly hinted to some of them that they would best prove their\r\npatriotism by using their especial knowledge in such a way as would\r\nmost effectually prevent it.  Boston set the example of self-denial and\r\nof resistance.  In the December of 1773 three ships laden with tea\r\narrived in her port.  Their captains soon heard of the hostility to\r\ntheir mission, were soon warned of the dangers that awaited them.\r\nAlarmed at their perils, the captains declared their perfect\r\nwillingness to return with their cargoes to England if they were\r\npermitted to do so by the Board of Customs and the persons to whom the\r\ntea had been consigned.  But the willingness of the captains was of no\r\navail.  The consignees insisted that the tea should be delivered to\r\nthem, and neither the Custom House nor the Governor would grant the\r\ncaptains permission to return.  But if the consignees and the\r\nauthorities were resolved that the tea should be landed, the citizens\r\nof Boston were equally resolved that it should {160} not.  Their\r\nfantastic method of giving force to their resolution has made it\r\nfamous.  In the dusk of a December evening the three tea-ships were\r\nsuddenly boarded by what seemed to be a small army of Mohawk Indians in\r\nall the terror of their war-paint.  These seeming Indians were in\r\nreality serious citizens of Boston, men of standing, wealth, and good\r\nrepute, wearers of names that had long been known and honored in the\r\nCommonwealth.  The frightful paint, the gaudy feathers, the moccasins\r\nand wampum, the tomahawks, scalping-knives, and pistols that seemed so\r\nalarming to the peaceful captains of the boarded ships were but the\r\nfantastic accoutrements that concealed the placid faces and the portly\r\npersons of many a respectable and respected Boston burgess.\r\n\r\nThe plan had been schemed out by a conclave of citizens around a bowl\r\nof punch in Court Street, and was carried out with a success that was\r\nno less remarkable than its peacefulness.  The trappings of the red man\r\nconcealed the identity of many prominent citizens, friends of John\r\nHancock and Samuel Adams, their rivals in ability and their peers in\r\nenergy.  The sham savages were so numerous and so determined that no\r\nresistance was offered by the captains or the crews of the vessels.\r\nThe shore was picketed with sentinels ready to resist any interference\r\non the part of any representatives of royal authority.  There was no\r\ninterference.  The conspirators of the punch-bowl and those who obeyed\r\ntheir instructions kept their secret so close, and did their work so\r\nquickly, that those in authority knew nothing about the business until\r\nthe business was happily over.  In about two hours the entire cargo of\r\nthe three tea-ships was dragged out of the hold and flung into the sea.\r\nThe patriotic citizen who had asked significantly if tea could be made\r\nwith salt water was satisfactorily answered by the Mohawks when they\r\ncast overboard the last of their three hundred and forty-two chests,\r\nand prepared to disappear as rapidly and as mysteriously as they had\r\ncome.  During the whole adventure only one man was hurt, who tried to\r\nsecrete some of the tea about his person, and who was given a drubbing\r\nfor his pains.  The Mohawks {161} scattered and disappeared, washed\r\ntheir faces, rolled up their blankets, concealed their pistols and\r\naxes, and as many reputable Boston citizens returned to their homes.\r\nIt is related that some of them on their way home passed by a house in\r\nwhich Admiral Montague was spending the evening.  Montague heard the\r\nnoise of the trampling feet, opened the window and looked out upon the\r\nfantastic procession.  No doubt some news of what had happened had\r\nreached him, for he is reported to have called out: \"Well, boys, you\r\nhave had a fine night for your Indian caper.  But mind, you've got to\r\npay the fiddler yet.\"  One of the Mohawk leaders looked up and answered\r\npromptly: \"Oh, never mind, squire.  Just come out here, if you please,\r\nand we'll settle the bill in two minutes.\"  The admiral considered the\r\nodds were against him, that the joke had gone far enough.  He closed\r\nthe window, leaving the bill to be settled by whoso thought fit, and\r\nthe laughing savages swept on to their respectable wigwams.  If some\r\nvery reputable citizens found a few leaves of tea in their shoes when\r\nthey took them off that night, they said nothing about it, and nobody\r\nwas the wiser.  So ended the adventure of the Boston Tea-party, which\r\nwas but the prologue to adventures more memorable and more momentous.\r\nWe learn that at least one of these masquerading Indians survived to so\r\nlate a date as the March of 1846.  Men now living may have clasped\r\nhands with Henry Purkitt and David Kinnison and heard from their own\r\nlips the story of a deed that enraged a King, offended Chatham, was\r\ndisapproved of by George Washington, and was not disapproved of by\r\nBurke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1773--After the Boston \"Tea-party\"]\r\n\r\nThe news of the Boston Tea-party reached London on January 19, 1774,\r\nand was public property on the 21st.  Other news little less unpleasant\r\nsoon followed.  At Charleston tea was only landed to lie rotting in\r\ndamp cellars, not an ounce of it to be bought or sold.  In Philadelphia\r\na proclamation of December 27, 1773, announced that \"THE TEA-SHIP being\r\narrived, every Inhabitant who wishes to preserve the Liberty of America\r\nis desired to meet at the STATE-HOUSE, This Morning, precisely {162} at\r\nTEN O'clock, to advise what is best to be done on this alarming\r\nCrisis.\"  \"What was best to be done\" proved to be to compel the\r\ntea-ship to return at once with its cargo to England.  New York refused\r\nto allow the tea-ship \"Nancy\" to enter the harbor, and if some tea was\r\neventually landed under the cannon of a man-of-war, it was only to be\r\nlocked up as in Charleston, and to be left to lie unused.  The bad news\r\nwas received in England with an unreasoning fury by those whose fault\r\nit was, and by those who knew nothing at all about the matter; with a\r\ngrave indignation by those who, like Pitt, were as resolute to support\r\nthe supremacy of England as to plead for justice to her colonies; with\r\ndespair by those who dreamed of an honorable and abiding union between\r\nthe two peoples; and with applause by those who admired any protest\r\nagainst injustice, however vehement and irregular.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, in reading the debates on the troubles in America, to\r\ncredit the sanity of the majority of the speakers.  These advocated a\r\ncolonial policy that should only have commended itself to a session of\r\nBedlamites, and clamored for a treatment of the colonists that might\r\nwell have shocked the susceptibilities of a savage.  No Virginian\r\nplanter could be more disdainful of the rights of his slaves, or more\r\nresentful at any attempt to assert them, than the average member of\r\nParliament was disdainful of the rights of the American colonists and\r\nresentful at their assertion.  The English country gentlemen who\r\napplauded the ministers and who howled at Burke seemed to be absolutely\r\nunconscious that the men of Massachusetts and the men of New York were\r\nnot merely like themselves made in the same image, but brethren of\r\ntheir own race, blood of their blood and bone of their bone, children\r\nof the same stock whose resistance to oppression was recorded at\r\nRunnymede and Worcester, at the Boyne and at Culloden.  Even if the\r\ncolonists had been the knaves and fools and cowards that the\r\nParliamentary majority appeared to think them, the action of that\r\nmajority was of a kind eminently calculated to lend strength to the\r\nmost feeble spirit and courage to the most craven heart.  The coarse\r\n{163} contempt, the brutal menace which were the distinguishing\r\nfeatures of all that ill-timed oratory might well have goaded into\r\nresistance men who had been slaves for generations till servility had\r\ngrown a habit.  Yet this contempt and menace were addressed to men\r\ntrained by harsh experiences to be stubborn in defence and sturdy in\r\ndefiance, men who had won their liberty from the sea and the\r\nwilderness, who were as tenacious of their rights and as proud of their\r\nprivileges as they were tenacious of the soil which they had wrested\r\nfrom the red man and the wolf, and proud of the stately cities which\r\nhad conquered the forest and the swamp.  It was the descendants of\r\nMiles Standish and John Smith, of Endicott and Bradford and Underhill\r\nand Winslow whom the Squire Westerns of Westminster were ready to\r\ninsult and were eager to enslave.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that even men who had advocated the\r\nclaims of the colonies were, or professed to be, shocked at the daring\r\ndeed of the men of Boston.  Dean Tucker declared that mutinous colonies\r\nwere no use to England, and had better be allowed to depart.  Chatham\r\nfound the action of the Boston people criminal, prompted by passions\r\nand wild pretences.  In America George Washington disapproved of the\r\nexploit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1774--Closing the port of Boston]\r\n\r\nThe East India Company, pressed by the pinch of financial difficulties,\r\nclamored for a revenge that the King was resolved to give them.  Under\r\nhis instigation Lord North, in the beginning of 1774, introduced the\r\nfamous measure for closing the port of Boston against all commerce.\r\nThe Bill declared that \"in the present condition of the town and harbor\r\nthe commerce of his Majesty's subjects cannot be safely carried on\r\nthere.\"  It was accordingly asserted to be \"expedient that the officers\r\nof his Majesty's Customs should be forthwith removed from the said\r\ntown.\"  It was enacted that \"from and after the first day of June,\r\n1774, it shall not be lawful for any person or persons to lade, or\r\ncause to be laden, or put off from any quay, wharf, or other place\r\nwithin the town of Boston, or in or upon any part of the shore of the\r\nbay, commonly called the harbor of Boston, into any ship, vessel, boat,\r\netc., any goods, wares, {164} or merchandise whatsoever . . . or to\r\ntake up, discharge, or cause or procure to be taken up or discharged\r\nwithin the town, out of any boat, lighter, ship, etc., any goods,\r\nwares, or merchandise whatsoever . . . under pain of the forfeiture of\r\nthe goods and merchandise and of the boat,\" and so on, in a long and\r\ndrastic measure practically intended to ruin Boston.  This was what the\r\nGovernment thought it well to describe by the word \"expedient.\"  This\r\nwas not all.  Comprehensive alterations of the laws of the province\r\nfollowed.  The charter of Massachusetts was changed.  The council for\r\nthe province, which had hitherto been chosen by the people, was now to\r\nbe chosen by the Crown, and the judges of the province were to be\r\nnominated by the Crown.  Another measure authorized the Governor to\r\nsend persons implicated in the disturbances to England for trial.\r\nBoston and the province were indeed to be heavily punished and sternly\r\nbrought to their senses.\r\n\r\nThe King and the King's ministers had hoped fondly, in the old as well\r\nas the new sense of the word, that their action towards the port of\r\nBoston would effectually humble the spirit and crush the opposition of\r\nthat mutinous city.  Their scheme was founded upon a nice calculation\r\nof the innate baseness of human nature.  They argued that the closing\r\nof the port of Boston would turn the stream of her commerce in the\r\ndirection of other cities, which would be only too glad to enrich\r\nthemselves at the expense of their disabled comrade.  While they\r\nbelieved that the punishment of Boston would thus breed a selfish\r\ndisunion in the province of Massachusetts, they trusted also that the\r\nspectacle of the severe punishment meted out to Massachusetts would\r\nhave its wholesome deterring effect upon other colonies and destroy at\r\nonce whatever desire for union might exist among them.  The King and\r\nthe King's ministers were the more deceived.  Their ingenious scheme\r\nproduced a result precisely the opposite of that which they so\r\nconfidently anticipated.  The other ports of Massachusetts did not\r\nseize with avidity the opportunity for plunder afforded them by the\r\nhumiliation of Boston.  The other colonies were not driven into discord\r\nby the sight of {165} the punishment of Massachusetts.  On the\r\ncontrary, the ports of Massachusetts refused to take advantage of the\r\ndegradation of Boston, and the colonies were urged, and almost forced,\r\ninto union by what they regarded as the despotic treachery of the\r\nEnglish Crown.  The most devoted friend, the most enthusiastic advocate\r\nof the rights of the American colonists could scarcely have devised\r\nbetter means of drawing them together and welding them into a solid\r\nfellowship than those which had been employed by George the Third and\r\nhis advisers for the purpose of keeping them apart forever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1774--General Gage]\r\n\r\nAn immense number of copies of the Boston Port Bill were sent with\r\ngreat rapidity all over the colonies.  In the fine phrase which we must\r\nneeds believe to be Burke's, these had the effect which the poets\r\nascribe to the Fury's torch; they set the countries through which they\r\npassed in a flame.  At Boston and New York \"the populace had copies of\r\nthe Bill printed upon mourning paper with a black border, which they\r\ncried about the streets under the title of a barbarous, cruel, bloody,\r\nand inhuman murder.\"  In other places the Bill was publicly burned.\r\nAll over the Continent great meetings were held, at which, with more or\r\nless vehemence of speech, but with a common enthusiasm and a common\r\nindignation, the Bill was denounced, and the determination to resist it\r\ndefiantly asserted.  When General Gage arrived on his mission of\r\nadministration he found not merely the colony of Massachusetts, but the\r\nwhole continent in an uproar.  He had to deal with a vast majority of\r\nthe people who were in proclaimed resistance to the Act, and who only\r\ndiffered in the extreme of resistance to which they were prepared\r\nimmediately to go, and a minority who either approved or did not\r\naltogether disapprove of the Act.  Gage was condemned to the government\r\nnot of a cowed, humbled, and friendless province, but of a raging\r\nnation, frantic at the infringement of its rights, and sustained in the\r\nstruggle it was resolved to make by the cheer and aid of a league of\r\nsister nations.  The flame from the Fury's torch had spread with a\r\nvengeance.  Gage was a brave man, an able man, an {166} honorable man;\r\nbut for Alexander he was a little over-parted.  The difficulties he had\r\nto encounter were too great for him to grapple with; the work he was\r\nmeant to do too vast for his hands or the hands of any man.  He was\r\nsent out to sway a chastened and degraded province; he found himself\r\nopposed by a defiant people, exalted by injustice and animated by\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{167}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nTHE \"VICAR OF WAKEFIELD.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1774--Death of Oliver Goldsmith]\r\n\r\nIn the early spring that followed upon the winter when the Mohawks of\r\nBoston made tea with salt water, at a time when politicians were busy\r\nfighting over the Boston Port Bill, and neither side dreamed of the\r\nconsequences that could come of a decision, one of the gentlest and\r\nsweetest writers of the English speech passed quietly, and somewhat\r\nunhappily, away from a world he had done so much to make happy.  With\r\nOliver Goldsmith an epoch of literature came to an end, as the year\r\nthat saw his death ended an epoch in the history of the world.  The\r\ncharacteristic literature of the eighteenth century, the literature\r\nthat began with Swift and Addison, and Steele and Pope; that boasted\r\namong its greatest the names of Sterne and Richardson, Smollett and\r\nFielding, came to its close with the genius of Goldsmith.  With the new\r\nconditions which were coming over the world a new literature was to be\r\ncreated.  Wordsworth was a child of four, at Cockermouth; Coleridge was\r\na child of four, at Bristol; over in Germany a young poet, whose name\r\nwas unknown in England, had been much influenced by Goldsmith's\r\nimmortal story, and was in his turn and time to have a very profound\r\ninfluence over the literature of Goldsmith's adopted country.  The year\r\nof Goldsmith's death was the year in which the young Goethe published\r\nthose \"Sorrows of Werther\" which marked the birth of a new form of\r\nexpression in art.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith was born in Ireland, at Pallas, in the county of Longford, in\r\nthe early November of 1728.  He lived for over forty-five years a life\r\nof poverty, of vagrancy, of squalor, of foolish dissipation, of\r\ngrotesque vanity, of an {168} industry as amazing as his improvidence,\r\nof a native idleness that was successfully combated by a tireless\r\nindustry, of an amazing simplicity that was only rivalled by his\r\namazing genius.  There were a great many contrasting and seemingly\r\nincompatible elements in Goldsmith's queer composition, but his faults\r\nwere not of a kind to prevent men from finding him lovable, and,\r\nwhatever his faults were, they left no stain upon his writings.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Goldsmith are distinguished in English literature, and,\r\nindeed, in the literature of the world, by their sweet pure humor,\r\nfresh and clear and sparkling as a fountain whose edges the satyr's\r\nhoof has never trampled.  They charm by their humanity, by their tender\r\ncharity, by the nobility of their lesson, a nobility only heightened by\r\nthe intense sympathy with the struggles, and sorrows, and errors of\r\nmankind.  A new St. Martin of letters, he was ever ready to share his\r\nmantle of pity with the sad and sinning.  He had himself suffered so\r\nmuch, and been so tempted and tested, and had retained throughout his\r\ntrials so much of the serenity of a child, that all his writings\r\nbreathe compassion for frailty and failure with something of a\r\nschoolboy sense of brotherhood which softens even his satire.  The\r\nflames of London's fiery furnace had blazed and raged about him, but he\r\npassed through them unconsumed.  The age in which he lived was not an\r\nage of exalted purity, the city wherein he dwelt was scarcely saintly.\r\nHe lived in some of the most evil days of the eighteenth century, but\r\nhis writings and his life escaped pollution.  He was not a saint,\r\nindeed; he was a spendthrift and he loved his glass, but he was never\r\ntainted with the servile sins of cities.  Through all the weltering\r\nhorror of Hogarth's London we seem to see him walk with something of\r\nthe freshness of his boyhood still shining on his face.  The reflection\r\nof the Irish skies was too bright upon his eyes to let them be dimmed\r\nby the squalor and the shame of a squalid and shameful city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1774--The friends of Goldsmith]\r\n\r\nWith the true instinct of his fine nature he made his friends and\r\ncompanions among the wisest and highest of his time.  His intimates and\r\ncompanions were Edmund {169} Burke, and Dr. Johnson, and Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds.  He had women friends too, as wisely chosen as the men--women\r\nwho were kind to him and admired him, women whose kindness and\r\nadmiration were worth the winning, women whose friendship brightened\r\nand soothed a life that was darkened and vexed enough.  Mary Horneck\r\nand her sister were the stars of his life, his heroines, his idols, his\r\nideals.  He has made Mary Horneck immortal as the \"Jessamy Bride.\"  In\r\nhis hours of poverty he was cheered by the thought of her; while he\r\nlived he worshipped her, and when he died a lock of his hair was taken\r\nfrom his coffin and given to her.  Thackeray tells a touching little\r\nstory of the Jessamy Bride.  She lived long after the death of the man\r\nof genius who adored her, lived well into the nineteenth century, and\r\n\"Hazlitt saw her, an old lady, but beautiful still, in Northcote's\r\npainting-room, who told the eager critic how proud she was always that\r\nGoldsmith had admired her.\"\r\n\r\nGoldsmith was a companionable being and loved all company that was not\r\nvicious and depraved.  He could be happy at the club in the society of\r\nthe great thinkers and teachers and wits of the time.  He could be more\r\nthan happy at Barton, in the society of Mary and her sister.  But he\r\ncould be happy too, in far humbler, far less romantic fellowship.  \"I\r\nam fond of amusement,\" he declares in one of his most delightful\r\nessays, \"in whatever company it is to be found, and wit, though dressed\r\nin rags, is ever pleasing to me.\"  There was plenty of wit dressed in\r\nrags drifting about the London of that day.  Men of genius slept on\r\nbulkheads and beneath arches, and starved for want of a guinea, or\r\nhaunted low taverns, or paced St. James's Square all night in\r\nimpecunious couples for sheer need of a lodging, cheering each other's\r\nsupperless mood with political conversations and declarations that, let\r\ncome what might come, they would never desert the Ministry.  But\r\nGoldsmith unearthed men of genius whose names nobody ever heard of, and\r\nstudied them and made merry with them, and transferred them to his\r\npages for us to make merry with more than a century after Goldsmith\r\n{170} fell asleep.  We may suspect that Goldsmith never really found\r\nthose wonderful beggars he chronicles.  He did not discover them as\r\nCabot discovered America; he is their inventor, as the fancy of poets\r\ninvented the Fortunate Islands.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith's strolling player is as real as Richard Savage, with whom he\r\nis contemporary, and it must be admitted that he is a more presentable\r\npersonage.  What a jolly philosophy is his about the delights of\r\nbeggary!  It has all the humor of Rabelais with no touch of the\r\nTouraine grossness.  It has something of the wisdom of Aurelius, only\r\nclad in homespun instead of the purple.  The philosophy of contentment\r\nwas never more merrily nor more whimsically expressed.  A synod of\r\nsages could not formulate a scheme in praise of poverty more impressive\r\nthan the contagious humor of his light-hearted merriment.  The\r\nstrolling player has the best of the argument, but he has it because he\r\nis speaking with the persuasive magic of the tongue of Oliver Goldsmith.\r\n\r\nThe same pervading cheerfulness, the same sunny philosophy, which is,\r\nhowever, by no means the philosophy of Pangloss, informs all his work.\r\nBeau Tibbs boasting in his garret; Dr. Primrose in Newgate; the\r\ngood-natured man, seated between two bailiffs, and trying to converse\r\nwith his heart's idol as if nothing had happened; Mr. Hardcastle,\r\nfoiled for the five-hundredth time in the tale of Old Grouse in the Gun\r\nRoom; each is an example of Goldsmith's method and of Goldsmith's\r\nmanner.  If Goldsmith did not enjoy while he lived all the admiration,\r\nall the rewards that belonged of right to his genius, the generations\r\nthat have succeeded have made amends for the errors of their ancestors.\r\n\"She Stoops to Conquer\" is still the most successful of the stock\r\ncomedies.  If \"The Good-Natured Man\" can scarcely be said to have kept\r\nthe stage, it is still the delight of the student in his closet.  What\r\nsatires are better known than the letters of the \"Citizen of the\r\nWorld\"?  What spot on the map is more familiar than Sweet Auburn?  As\r\nfor the \"Vicar of Wakefield,\" what profitable words could now be added\r\nto {171} its praise?  It has conquered the world, it is dear to every\r\ncountry and known in every language, it has taken its place by\r\nunquestionable right with the masterpieces of all time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1774--Goldsmith and Dr. Johnson]\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Goldsmith,\" said his most famous friend of the man who was then\r\nlying in the Temple earth--\"Dr. Goldsmith was wild, sir, but he is so\r\nno more.\"  This epitaph has been quoted a thousand times, but it must\r\nin no sense be taken as a summing-up of the dead man's career.  It was\r\na rebuke, justly administered, to the critic who at such a moment could\r\nhave the heart to say that Oliver Goldsmith had been wild.  Dr.\r\nJohnson, who uttered the rebuke, put the same thought even more\r\nprofoundly in a letter addressed to Bennet Langton shortly after\r\nGoldsmith's death.  In this letter he announces Goldsmith's death,\r\nspeaks of his \"folly of expense,\" and concludes by saying, \"But let not\r\nhis frailties be remembered; he was a very great man.\"  These simple\r\nwords are infinitely more impressive than the magniloquence of the\r\nepitaph which Johnson wrote on Goldsmith.\r\n\r\nGoldsmith lived in London and he died in London, and he lies buried in\r\nthe precincts of the Temple.  The noise, and rattle, and roar of London\r\nrave daily about his grave.  Around it rolls the awful music of a great\r\ncity that has grown and swollen and extended its limits and multiplied\r\nits population out of all resemblance to that little London where\r\nGoldsmith lived and starved and made merry, and was loved, and dunned,\r\nand sorrowed for.  The body that first drew breath among the pleasant\r\nLongford meadows, which seem to stretch in all directions to touch the\r\nsky, lies at rest within the humming, jostling, liberties of the\r\nTemple.  It is perhaps fitting that the grave of one who all his life\r\nloved men and rejoiced so much in companionship should be laid in a\r\nplace where the foot of man is almost always busy, where silence, when\r\nit comes at all, comes only with the night.\r\n\r\nThere is not a space in the scope of this history to deal, otherwise\r\nthan incidentally, with the literature of England in the eighteenth\r\ncentury.  The whole Georgian era, from its dawn to its dusk, is rich in\r\nsplendid names in {172} letters as in art.  The great inheritance from\r\nthe Augustan age of Anne, the anguish of Grub Street, the evolution of\r\nthe novel, the eloquence of the pulpit and the bar, the triumphs of\r\nscience, the controversies of scholars, the fortunes of the drama, the\r\nspeculations of philosophy, the vacillations of the pamphleteer, the\r\njudgments of the critics, the achievements of historians--these are\r\nthemes whose intimate consideration is outside the range of this work's\r\npurpose.  All that is possible is here and there to linger a little in\r\nthe company of some dear and famous figure--a Swift, a Johnson, a\r\nGoldsmith, a Sheridan--who stands above his fellows in the world's\r\nrenown or in our individual affection, who played while he lived his\r\nconspicuous part on the great stage of public life, or who helped\r\nconspicuously to influence public thought.  The selection is, within\r\nthese limitations, inevitably arbitrary, and is given frankly as such.\r\nCertain names assert themselves masterfully, and of these Goldsmith's\r\nis one of the most masterful.  He added images to daily life and common\r\nthought as Bunyan did or Shakespeare.  There is no more need to explain\r\nDr. Primrose than there is to explain Mr. Facing-both-ways, and if Beau\r\nTibbs is only less familiar as Osric, Tony Lumpkin is to the full as\r\nfamiliar as Falstaff.  Goldsmith himself is the lovable type of a class\r\nthat was often unlovely in the eighteenth century, the needy man of\r\nletters.  If he has his lodging in the Grub Street of Dreams, his\r\npresence there brings sunlight into the squalid place, and an infinite\r\nhumor, an infinite charity compensate royally for a little finite folly\r\nand finite vanity.  In the great art he served and the great age he\r\nadorned Goldsmith stands, not alone, but apart, with the very human\r\ndemigods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{173}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nYANKEE DOODLE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775--The Philadelphia Congress]\r\n\r\nAn English ministry and an English king were convinced that everything\r\nnecessary to do for the suppression of the mutinous spirit in a\r\nturbulent but unwarlike people had been done.  The existence of Boston\r\nas a trading port had been abolished; Carthage had been blotted out;\r\nthere was an English army within the walls of Boston; there was an\r\nEnglish fleet in the Charles River.  Who could doubt that the cowardly\r\nfarmers whom Sandwich derided, and their leaders, the voluble lawyers\r\nwhom Sandwich despised, would be cowed now into quiescence, only\r\nthankful that things were no worse?  The best and wisest in England\r\nwere among those who did doubt, but they were like Benedict in the\r\nplay--nobody marked them, or at least nobody responsible for any\r\ncontrol over the conduct of affairs.  Official confidence was suddenly\r\nand rudely shaken.  The lawyers proved to be men of deeds as well as of\r\nwords.  The disdained farmers showed that the descendants of the men\r\nwho had fought with beasts and with Indians after the manner of\r\nEndicott and Standish had not degenerated in the course of a few\r\ngenerations.  Over the Atlantic came news which made the Boston\r\nMassacre, the burning of the \"Gaspee,\" and the Boston Tea-party, seem\r\ntrivial and insignificant events.  An astounded Ministry learned that a\r\nformal Congress of Representatives of the different colonies had been\r\nconvened and had met in Philadelphia, and had drawn up a Declaration of\r\nRights.  Chatham admired and applauded their work.  To the King and the\r\nKing's ministers it was meaningless when it was not offensive.  But the\r\ncolonists showed that they could do more than meet in Congresses and\r\ndraw up {174} splendid State Papers.  The next news was of acts of war.\r\nGage schemed a raid upon the stores of powder and arms accumulated by\r\nthe disaffected colonists in Concord.  Warning of his plan was carried\r\nat night by a patriotic engraver named Paul Revere to every hamlet\r\nwithin reach of a horse's ride.  There was a skirmish at Lexington on\r\nthe road to Concord between the King's troops and a body of minute-men,\r\nwhich resulted in the killing and wounding of many of the latter and\r\nthe dispersal of their force.  An expedition that began with what might\r\nin irony be termed a victory for the British arms ended in a disaster\r\nas tragic as it was complete.  Concord forewarned had nothing to yield\r\nto the English soldiers who invaded her quiet streets; but the\r\nsurrounding country, equally forewarned, answered the invasion by\r\nsending bodies of armed farmers and minute-men from every point of the\r\ncompass to the common centre of Concord.  There was a sharp, short\r\nfight on Concord Bridge, which ended in the repulse of the royal troops\r\nand the death of brave men on both sides.  Then the British officer\r\ndecided to retreat from Concord.  It proved one of the most memorable\r\nretreats in history.  From behind every tree, every bowlder, every\r\nwall, every hedge, enemies trained in the warfare of the wilderness\r\npoured their fire upon the retiring troops.  It seemed to one of the\r\nofficers engaged in that memorable fight as if the skies rained down\r\nfoes upon them, unseen foes only made known by the accuracy of their\r\nmarksmanship and the pertinacity of their veiled pursuit.  All the way\r\nfrom Concord the retiring troops fought in vain with an enemy that was\r\nseldom seen, but whose presence was everywhere manifested by the\r\nprecision of his aim and the tale of victims that followed each volley.\r\nThe retreat was becoming a rout when reinforcements sent out from\r\nBoston under the command of Lord Percy stayed an actual stampede.  But\r\nit could not stay the retreat nor avert defeat.  Lord Percy, who had\r\nmarched out with his bands playing \"Yankee Doodle,\" in mockery of the\r\nAmericans, had to retreat in his turn with no mocking music, carrying\r\nwith him the remnant of the invaders of Concord.  He {175} and his\r\nforce did not get within touch of Boston and the protection of the guns\r\nof the fleet a moment too soon.  Had a large body of insurgents, who\r\ncame hurrying in to help their brethren, arrived on the field a little\r\nearlier, Lord Percy and his command must inevitably have been made\r\nprisoners of war.  As it was, this one day's business had given success\r\nand the confidence that comes of success to the raw colonists, and had\r\ninflicted a crushing defeat upon a body of soldiers who had been led to\r\nbelieve that the sight of their scarlet coats would act like a charm to\r\ntame their untutored opponents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1776--Military success of the colonists]\r\n\r\nGage only recovered from the shock of this disaster to realize that\r\nBoston was invested by an insurgent army.  The victors of the fight and\r\nflight from Concord were rapidly reinforced by bodies of men from all\r\nparts of the country; their ranks were hourly swelled by levies roughly\r\narmed but stubbornly resolved.  Unpleasant facts forced themselves\r\nthick and fast upon Gage's notice.  But yesterday, as it were, he had\r\nimagined that the mere presence of the forces under his command was\r\nsufficient to overawe the colonists and settle any show of\r\ninsubordination forever; to-day he had to swallow in shame and anger a\r\nstaggering defeat.  Still Gage did nothing and his enemies accumulated.\r\nRoyal reinforcements arrived under Burgoyne, Clinton, and Howe, to do\r\nnothing in their turn.  But the peasants they despised were not idle\r\nand would not allow them to be idle.  The English general woke up one\r\nmorning to find that under cover of night an important point of vantage\r\noverlooking the town of Boston had been occupied and roughly fortified\r\nby the rebels.  The citizen soldiers who had gathered together to\r\ndefend their liberties had stolen a march upon the English general.\r\nThey had occupied the rising ground of Breed Hill, below Bunker's Hill,\r\non the Charlestown side of the Charles River, and had hurriedly\r\nintrenched themselves there behind rude but efficient earthworks.  Gage\r\nwas resolved that the rebels should not remain long in their new\r\nposition.  Chance might have allotted them a scratch victory over a\r\nsmall body of men taken unawares in unfamiliar country {176} and by\r\nunfamiliar methods of fighting.  But here was a business familiar to\r\nthe British soldier; here was work that he did well and that he loved\r\nto do.  If the colonists really believed that they could hold Breed\r\nHill against troops with whom the taking by storm of strong positions\r\nwas a tradition, so much the worse for them.  The order was given that\r\nthe rebels must be cleared away from Breed Hill at once, and the\r\nwelcome task was given to Lord Howe, in command of the flower of the\r\nforces in Boston.  It is probable that Howe felt some pity for the rash\r\nand foolhardy men whose hopes it was his duty and his determination to\r\ndestroy.  Confident that the enterprise would be as brief as it must be\r\ndecisive, Howe prepared to assault, and the battle of Breed Hill began.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775--The Battle of Breed Hill]\r\n\r\nThe Breed Hill battle is one of the strangest and one of the bravest\r\nfights ever fought by men.  On the one side were some hundreds of\r\nsimple citizens, civilians, skilled as individuals in the use of the\r\ngun, and accustomed as volunteers, militia, and minute-men to something\r\nthat might pass for drill and manoeuvre, officered and generalled by\r\nmen who, like Warren and Greene, knew warfare only by the bookish\r\ntheoric, or by men who, like Putnam and Pomeroy, had taken their\r\nbaptism of fire and blood in frontier struggles with wild beast and\r\nwilder Indian.  On the other side were some thousands of the finest\r\ntroops in the world, in whose ranks victory was a custom, on whose\r\nbanners the names of famous battles blazed.  They were well trained,\r\nwell armed, well equipped.  They moved at the word of command with the\r\nmonotonous precision and perfection of a machine.  They were led by\r\nofficers whose temper had been tested again and again in the sharp\r\nexperiences of war, men to whom the thought of defeat was as unfamiliar\r\nas the thought of fear.  The contrast between the two opposing forces\r\nwas vividly striking in the very habiliments of the opponents.  The men\r\nwho were massed behind the breastworks of Breed Hill were innocent of\r\nuniform, of the bright attire that makes the soldier's life alluring,\r\ninnocent even of any distinction between officer and private, or, if\r\nthe words seem too formal {177} for so raw a force, between the men who\r\nwere in command and the men who were commanded.  The soldiers who were\r\nmassed below, the force whose duty it was to march up the hill and\r\nsweep away the handful in hodden gray and black broadcloth who held it,\r\nglittered with all the bravery of color dear to the British army.\r\nSplendid in scarlet and white and gold, every buckle shining, every\r\nbelt and bandolier as brightly clean as pipeclay could make it, the\r\nlittle army under Howe's command would have done credit to a parade in\r\nthe Park or a field day at Windsor.  The one side was as sad and sombre\r\nas a Puritan prayer-meeting; the other glowed with all the color and\r\nwarmth of a military pageant.  The holders of the hill had come from\r\ntheir farms and their fields in the homely working clothes they wore as\r\nthey followed the plough or tended their cattle; the townsmen among\r\nthem came in the decent civic suits they wore behind their desks or\r\ncounters.  Few men's weapons were fellows in that roughly armed array.\r\nEach militant citizen carried his own gun, some favorite weapon,\r\nfamiliar from long practice in fowling, or from frequent service\r\nfurther afield against the bear, the panther, and the wolf.  Some of\r\nthe flint-locks were enormously long; many of them would have seemed\r\nextremely old-fashioned to an ordnance officer.  But every gun was like\r\nan additional limb to those practised marksmen, who knew little of\r\nfiring in platoons, but everything of the patient accuracy which gives\r\nthe backwoodsman his unerring aim.  The assailants carried the latest\r\nweapons approved of by the War Office, and manipulated them with the\r\nfaultless unison and unswerving harmony that would have compelled the\r\ncompliments of a commander-in-chief at a review.  At the top of the\r\nhill were some sixteen hundred men, a mob of undisciplined\r\nsharpshooters, few of whom had ever fired a shot in organized warfare.\r\nAt the bottom of the hill were some four thousand of the finest troops\r\nin the world, stiffened with all the strength that prestige and\r\npractice could give them.  It did not seem on the face of it a very\r\nequal combat; it did not seem to the English generals that it ought to\r\ntake very long to {178} march from the bottom to the top of the hill\r\nand make short work of the mutinous peasants on its summit.  The best\r\nindeed that the mutinous peasants could hope for when the British were\r\nupon them was to be shot or bayoneted as quickly as possible, for the\r\nterms of Gage's proclamation directly threatened with the gallows every\r\nrebel taken with arms in his hands.\r\n\r\nBut at Breed Hill, as at Concord, the unexpected came to pass.  The\r\nBritish troops were unable to endure the destructive fire of the\r\ncolonists.  Again and again they advanced over the incline as calmly as\r\nif on parade; again and again they reeled backward with shattered\r\nranks, leaving grim piles of dead upon the fire-swept slope.  The\r\nexecution was terrible; regiments that marched up the hill as if to\r\ncertain victory fell back from it a mere remnant of themselves, leaving\r\nmost of their men and almost all their officers behind.  For awhile the\r\nfight was a succession of catastrophes to the force under Howe's\r\ncommand.  It looked as if Breed Hill would never be taken.  But there\r\ncame a time when the men who held it could hold it no longer.  Their\r\nsupply of powder began to run out, and with their means of keeping up\r\ntheir fire their power of holding their position came to an end.  Then\r\ncame a last charge of Howe's rallied forces, this time in the lightest\r\nof marching array, a last volley from behind the earth-works, and Breed\r\nHill was in the hands of the British.  It was captured at the last\r\nwithout much bloodshed, without much loss to its garrison.  The smoke\r\nhung so thick about the enclosure where the rebels had held their own\r\nso long and so well that it was not easy for the bayonets of the\r\nconquerors to do much execution, and the defenders of Breed Hill\r\nslipped away for the most part under cover of the mist they themselves\r\nhad made.  Indeed, there was little inclination for pursuit on the part\r\nof the victors.  They had done what they had been set to do, but they\r\nhad done it at a cost which for the time made it impossible for them to\r\nattempt to pursue an advantage so dearly bought.  They did not, could\r\nnot know the strength of their enemy; they were content to hold the\r\nground which had been won {179} with such a fearful waste of British\r\nblood.  Breed Hill was a nominal victory for the King; it was a real\r\nvictory for the rebels, who had shown what an undisciplined force,\r\ncomposed of farmers, trappers, lawyers, shopkeepers, and divines, could\r\ndo against the finest troops in the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775--The Continental Army]\r\n\r\nAlready insurgent America had an army, and an army of investment.  The\r\nrebels, whom Gage affected to despise almost as much as he was himself\r\ndespised by General Burgoyne, were massed in numbers unknown to the\r\nloyalists before Boston, and the English soldiers were cooped up in the\r\ncity they had crossed the seas to command.  The colonial army was rude\r\nand rough, but earnest and resolute, and it had evolved generals of its\r\nown making, rough and rude as itself, but able, daring, and fearless.\r\nIsrael Putnam, who killed a wolf once with his own hands in his wild\r\nyouth, gripping it by the throat till he had choked its life out, had\r\ncome to fight against the flag beneath which he had fought so well in\r\nthe French wars.  Nathaniel Greene had flung down his military books\r\nand caught up the sword, had abandoned the theory for the practice, and\r\nwas beginning to make a name.  Benedict Arnold, after a life as varied,\r\nas shady, and as adventurous as that of any picaroon in a Spanish\r\nstory, leaped into fame as a daring spirit by the way in which he and\r\nEthan Allen, at the head of a mixed force of Vermonters and New\r\nEnglanders, had taken Fort Ticonderoga, on the great lakes, by\r\nsurprise, and had endowed the dawning army with its captured cannon.\r\nPrescott, the hero of Breed Hill, was now a veteran soldier; and the\r\nnames of Artemas Ward, of Schuyler, of Pomeroy, Heath and Thomas,\r\nSullivan and Montgomery, Wooster and Spencer were becoming more than\r\nmere names to Englishmen in Boston and in London.  Two Englishmen held\r\nrank as generals in the crude colonial army--the adventurer Charles\r\nLee, whom some foolish people believed to be the real Junius, and\r\nHoratio Gates.  There were few thoroughly worthless men in the young\r\narmy, but it is painful to record that Lee and Gates were eminent among\r\nthem.  These were the generals of what was now to be called the {180}\r\nContinental Army.  Happy in most of them, happy in much, it was\r\nhappiest of all in this: that it had for its commander-in-chief the\r\nnoblest man, who was to prove the greatest soldier, then living in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775--George Washington]\r\n\r\nWhen Braddock died, the hero of a hopeless fight and the martyr of his\r\nown folly, the funeral service was read over his body by the young\r\nVirginian soldier who had fought by his side and had warned him against\r\nhis rashness.  To men in later years there seemed to be something\r\nprophetic, with the blended irony and pathos of prophecy, in the\r\npicture of that dead Englishman, his scarlet coat torn and bloody with\r\nso many wounds, lying in his grave while his American lieutenant read\r\nover him the words that committed so much wasted courage to the earth.\r\nAt the time and hour the thing signified no more than the price of a\r\npetty victory of allied French and Indians, which the Virginian soldier\r\nwas soon to avenge.  After planting the banner of King George on the\r\nruins of Fort Duquesne, Captain Washington sheathed his sword and\r\nretired from military into civil life, with as little likelihood as\r\ndesire of ever carrying arms again.  All he asked and all he\r\nanticipated was to live the tranquil life of a comfortable colonial\r\ngentleman.  After a youth that had been vexed by many experiences of\r\nthe passion of love he had married happily and wisely, and had settled\r\ndown to a gracious rural life at Mount Vernon, on the banks of the\r\nPotomac River.  He wished no better than to be a country gentleman,\r\nwith a country gentleman's pleasures and pursuits--farming, hunting,\r\nfishing--with a country gentleman's friendships for neighbors like\r\nhimself.  He was a dutiful servant of his State; he was a member of the\r\nVirginia Houses of Burgesses for fifteen years after the fall of Fort\r\nDuquesne, and though he seldom played any part in debate he commanded\r\nthe confidence and the esteem of his colleagues and of his\r\nfellow-citizens.  He lived and enjoyed a peaceful, honorable, useful,\r\nuneventful life, and might have lived it to its end in dignified\r\nobscurity if a rash and headstrong sovereign over-seas had not found\r\nministers too servile or too foolish to say him nay.\r\n\r\n{181}\r\n\r\nThe Continental Congress, conscious of Washington's ability, offered\r\nhim the command of its improvised army.  Washington accepted the duty,\r\nwell aware of its gravity, its danger, its awful responsibility.  He\r\nrefused any pay beyond his actual expenses, and he entered upon a\r\nstruggle whose difficulties were not all or nearly all due to the enemy\r\nin the sternest and noblest sense of duty to his countrymen and to the\r\nprinciples of liberty.  At first, in his own words, he loathed the idea\r\nof independence.  He only took up arms to defend cherished rights; the\r\nday was not yet, though the day was not far off, when the Virginian\r\nsoldier would renounce his allegiance to the King whose commission he\r\nhad carried and to the country from which his race stemmed.\r\nWashington's military genius soon showed itself in the use he made of\r\nthe loose, incoherent, disorganized mass of men which was called the\r\nContinental Army.  It was fortunate for the Continental cause that the\r\nEnglish generals, penned up within the walls of Boston, had little idea\r\nof the obstacles Washington had to overcome, the opposition he had to\r\nencounter, the sore straits to which the want of everything essential\r\nto a besieging army drove him.  But his indomitable courage, his\r\nunfailing coolness, his unconquerable resource overcame a sea of\r\ntroubles that might well have swept even a strong man and a brave\r\nsoldier off his feet.  With regiment after regiment quietly disbanding\r\nas their term of service expired; with a plentiful lack of powder, of\r\narms, of provisions, of uniforms; with a force that at moments\r\nthreatened to dissolve into nothingness and leave him with a handful of\r\ngenerals alone beneath his insurgent flag, Washington never allowed the\r\nenemy, and seldom allowed a friend, to guess how near at times he came\r\nto despair.  He raised troops somehow; he got provisions somehow;\r\nsomehow he managed to obtain powder; somehow he managed to obtain arms.\r\nThe want of weapons was so great that many bodies of men were only\r\nprovided with pikes, and that Franklin was driven to suggest, and\r\npartly in a spirit of humanity, that American farmers fighting for\r\ntheir liberty should be armed with the bows and arrows of the red {182}\r\nmen, and should strive to renew upon the fields of Massachusetts the\r\nsuccesses of their ancestors, the yeomen of Agincourt, with their\r\nclothyard shafts.\r\n\r\nThe generals shut up in Boston knew nothing of the cares that harassed\r\nthe mind of Washington.  All they knew was that they were closely\r\nbeleaguered; that they were cooped up in Boston by a large if irregular\r\narmy, and that they could not get out.  They affected, of course, to\r\ndespise their enemy.  At the private theatricals which were given to\r\ndivert the enforced leisure of Lord Howe an actor who came on as a\r\ncaricature of Washington, attired like a military scarecrow, never\r\nfailed to please.  Burgoyne was confident that sooner or later he could\r\nfind that \"elbow-room\" the ungratified desire for which has served to\r\nimmortalize his name.  But neither Howe nor Burgoyne nor any one else\r\ncould dissipate the ragged regiments that invested Boston, nor baffle\r\nthe plans of the great soldier who commanded them.  For nearly a year\r\nthe world saw with wonder the spectacle of an English army confined in\r\nBoston, and an English fleet riding idly in the Charles River.  Then\r\nthe end came.  Washington, closing in, offered Lord Howe, the English\r\ngeneral then in command, the choice of evacuation or bombardment.  The\r\nEnglish general chose the former.  The royal troops withdrew from\r\nBoston, taking with them the loyalist families who had thrown in their\r\nlot with the King's cause.  The English ships that sailed from Boston\r\nwere terribly overcrowded with the number of refugees who preferred\r\nflight, with all its attendant sorrows, to remaining in a rebellious\r\ncountry.  The English fleet sailed away from Boston and the Continental\r\nArmy marched in.  So far the cause of King George was going very badly\r\nindeed; so far the rebellious colonists had failed to justify the\r\nconfident prophecies of Lord Sandwich.  With any other king and with\r\nany other ministers one such year's work would have been enough at\r\nleast to induce them to reconsider their position.  But the King was\r\nGeorge the Third, and his ministers were what they were, and it was\r\nresolved that the war must go on.\r\n\r\n{183}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775-81--The Declaration of Independence]\r\n\r\nThe war did go on.  It lasted for five years more, in spite of the\r\nprotests of every truly patriotic Englishman, in spite of proof after\r\nproof that nothing could break the spirit or crush the courage of the\r\ncolonists.  While in England Fox arrayed himself in the blue and buff\r\nthat composed the uniform of the Continental Army, while the Duke of\r\nRichmond made it a point to speak, and with excellent reason, of the\r\nContinental Army as \"our army,\" while the eloquence of Chatham and the\r\neloquence of Burke were launched in vain against campaigns as idle as\r\nthey were infamous, the war went stubbornly on.  The King and his\r\nministers proposed new measures of repression and expended vast sums in\r\nthe purchase of Hessian regiments to dragoon the defiant colonists.\r\nSoon all pretence of loyalty had to be abandoned by the Americans.  The\r\nstatue of King George was dragged from its place of honor in Bowling\r\nGreen, New York, and run into bullets to be used against his German\r\nlevies.  In the summer that followed the evacuation of Boston the\r\nrebellious colonies proclaimed their independence in the most memorable\r\ndeclaration of a people's right ever made by men.  This was in 1776.\r\nThe disastrous war had still five years to run.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the war varied.  The early victories of the Americans\r\nwere followed by a series of defeats which left Philadelphia in the\r\nhands of the British, and which would have broken the heart of any man\r\nof less heroic mould than Washington.  Hope revived with a series of\r\nContinental victories.  Aid came to America from abroad.  France,\r\nGermany, Poland sent stout soldiers to fight for freedom--Lafayette,\r\nVon Steuben, Kosciusko.  The English general Burgoyne surrendered with\r\nall his army at Saratoga.  After the winter of 1777, when Washington\r\nand his army suffered all the rigors of Valley Forge, France\r\nacknowledged the independence of America, the British evacuated\r\nPhiladelphia, and Paul Jones made himself forever famous by the way in\r\nwhich he and his ship \"Le Bonhomme Richard,\" carried the American war\r\nto the coast of England.  Again came colonial reverses.  A {184} steady\r\nsuccession of English successes scarcely struck so hard a blow at the\r\nContinental cause as the treason of Benedict Arnold, who entered into\r\nnegotiations with the British to betray his command.  Washington had\r\ntrusted and loved Arnold like a brother.  \"Whom can I trust now?\" he\r\nasked in momentary despair when the capture of an English officer.\r\nMajor André, and the flight of Benedict Arnold to the British lines\r\nrevealed to him an undreamed-of treason which had threatened to\r\nundermine the colonial cause.  But Benedict Arnold's crime had for its\r\nonly result the death of a better man than himself, of Major André, who\r\nhad by the laws of war to suffer death as a spy.  There were other\r\ntraitors and semi-traitors in the American army: Lee was certainly the\r\nfirst; Gates was almost, if not quite, the second.  But Lee and Gates\r\nfailed to do the mischief to which their base jealousy of Washington\r\nprompted them.  The right cause triumphed.  In 1781 another British\r\narmy surrendered, the army of Cornwallis, at Yorktown.  Even North was\r\nforced to recognize that this crushing disaster to the royal hopes and\r\nthe royal arms practically ended the war.  It was suspended in the\r\nfollowing year, and in 1783, after much negotiation, which at times\r\nthreatened to come to nothing, a treaty of peace was signed in France,\r\nand the American Republic took its place among the nations of the\r\nearth.  It was for these negotiations that Franklin, as we have said,\r\nbrought out from its obscurity that gala suit which he had worn for the\r\nlast time when he stood at the bar of the House of Commons and listened\r\nto the brutal and foolish assaults of Wedderburn.  Many days had passed\r\nsince that day.\r\n\r\nSo ended one of the most unjust and one of the most foolish wars ever\r\nwaged by England.  It must never be forgotten that the war was in no\r\nsense an English war.  The English people as a whole had then no voice\r\nto express itself one way or the other.  Of those Englishmen whose\r\nvoices had to be heard, the best and the wisest were as angry in their\r\ndenunciations of the crime of the King and the King's ministers, and as\r\ncordial in their {185} admiration of Washington and his companions, as\r\nif they had been members of that Continental Congress which first in\r\nPhiladelphia proclaimed the existence of a new nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1778--Death of the Earl of Chatham]\r\n\r\nThe fatal war which had cost the English King the loss of his greatest\r\ncolonies, which had spilt a vast amount of blood and wasted a vast\r\namount of treasure in order to call into being a strong and naturally\r\nresentful rival to the power of England, must be said also to have cost\r\nthe life of the greatest English statesman of the century.  The genius\r\nof Chatham had never been more nobly employed than in protesting with\r\nall the splendor of its eloquence against the unjust war upon the\r\nAmericans and the unjust deeds which had heralded the war.  But time,\r\nthat had only swelled the ranks of the wise and sane who thought as\r\nChatham had thought and found their own utterance from the fire of his\r\nwords, had wrought a change in the attitude of a great statesman.\r\nHarassed by the disease that racked his body, the mind of Chatham had\r\naltered.  The noble views that he had maintained in defiance of a\r\nheadstrong king and a corrupt ministry had changed in the face of the\r\nsuccession of calamities that had fallen upon his country.  The success\r\nthat he had desired for the insurgent arms had been accorded, and he\r\ncame to despair at the consequence of that success.  He had been\r\ngranted his heart's desire in full measure, and the gratification\r\nchoked him.  When it came to be a question of conceding to the\r\ncolonists that formal recognition of an independence which they had\r\nalready won, the intellect of Chatham revolted against the policy\r\nhimself had fostered.  He forgot or he forswore the principles which\r\nanimated Burke, which animated Fox, which guided the course of\r\nRockingham and inspired the utterances of Richmond.  All he could see\r\nwas an England humiliated by many defeats, an England threatened by\r\nmany terrible alliances, and in the face of humiliation and of menace\r\nhe forgot that both alike were the inevitable, the well-deserved fruit\r\nof injustice.  Remembering that he had helped to make England great, he\r\nrefused to remember that England would have been still greater if she\r\nhad {186} followed the honorable course his wisdom had made plain to\r\nher.  His proud, unhappy spirit could not consent to her dismemberment,\r\na dismemberment which seemed to his fading intellect to be the\r\nequivalent to her ruin.  He came from his sick bed, a ghastly image of\r\ndecay, to offer the desperate protest of a dying man against surrender\r\nto the mutiny his own eloquence had fanned.  \"Come the four quarters of\r\nthe world in arms and we will shock them.\"  The spirit of Faulconbridge\r\nwas strong in the ruined body of the statesman who was carried to his\r\nseat in the House of Lords by the son who bore his name and by the Lord\r\nMahon who had married his daughter.  His eagle face was turned against\r\nthe men who had been his colleagues.  His trembling hand pointed at\r\nthem in condemnation.  He gasped out a few sentences, almost\r\ninarticulate, almost inaudible, before he reeled in a fit upon the arms\r\nof those about him.  He was carried from the House; he was carried to\r\nHayes, and at Hayes a few weeks later the great career came to an end.\r\nHis last battle was at least heroic.  If his stroke was struck on the\r\nwrong side and for a cause his prime had done so much to baffle, it is\r\nnot necessary to attribute his perversion entirely to the insidious\r\nravages of the malady that had clouded his whole life.  He could not\r\nbear to see the country that was in so eminent and so intimate a sense\r\nhis country yield even to claims that were conspicuously right and just\r\nat the command of a league between England's rebellious children and\r\nEngland's enemy, France.  There broke his mighty heart.  In Chatham\r\nEngland lost one of the greatest of her statesmen, one of the most\r\nsplendid of her sons.  His life was passionately devoted to his\r\ncountry, his career one long struggle against a peculiarly bigoted,\r\nstubborn, and unwise King.  Always hated by his enemies, often\r\nmisunderstood by his friends, he showed while he lived a steadfast\r\nfront alike against the enemies of England abroad and those worse\r\nenemies of England at home who filled the throne and the places about\r\nthe throne.  He was buried with great pomp and honor at Westminster,\r\nleaving behind him not merely the memory of an illustrious name, {187}\r\nbut a name that the second generation was still to make illustrious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1781--England and her lost colonies]\r\n\r\nThe folly of the King and the servility of his ministers resulted in\r\nwhat seemed to be almost an irredeemable catastrophe for England.  Even\r\nthose Englishmen who most sympathized with the struggle for American\r\nindependence could not but feel a regret that men who might have been\r\namong the most glorious citizens of a great and united empire should be\r\nthus recklessly forced into an enmity that had deprived England of its\r\nmost splendid possessions.  The enemies of England, many and eager,\r\nbelieved her day was done, that her sun was setting, that neither her\r\npower nor her prestige would ever recover from the succession of\r\ndisasters that began at Lexington and that ended in Paris.  But the\r\nvitality of the country was too great to be seriously impaired even by\r\nthe loss of the American colonies.  From a blow that might well have\r\nbeen little less than fatal the country recovered with a readiness and\r\na rapidity that was amazing.  Men who in their youth heard their elders\r\nspeak with despair of the calamity that had befallen their country\r\nlived to old age to learn that the wound was not incurable, and that\r\nEngland was greater, richer, prouder, and more powerful than she had\r\never been before.  If she had lost the American colonies she had\r\nlearned a lesson in the loss.  The blow that might have stunned only\r\nserved to rouse her to a greater sense of her danger and a livelier\r\nconsciousness of her duty.  If she had suffered much from rashness she\r\nwas not going to suffer more from inaction, and it seemed as if every\r\nsource of strength in the kingdom knit itself together in the common\r\npurpose of showing to the world that England still was England,\r\nalthough a part of her empire had passed away from her forever.  There\r\nwas no glory to be got for England out of the American war; it was\r\nwrong from first to last, wrong, unjust, and foolish, but when it ended\r\nit did not find her crippled, nor did it leave her permanently\r\nenfeebled in temper or in strength.\r\n\r\nWe may gather some idea of what risk wise men felt they were running\r\nfrom a famous speech of Edmund {188} Burke.  He was striving to stay\r\nthe determination of the Ministry to declare war upon the American\r\ncolonies.  He wished his hearers to appreciate the progress that\r\nAmerica had made within living memory.  He called imagination to his\r\naid.  He spoke of a statesman then living in the late evening of an\r\nhonorable life.  He pictured that statesman in the promise of his early\r\ndawn, saluted by the angel of his auspicious youth, and given the power\r\nto see into the future, so far as to the hour when Burke was speaking.\r\n\"What,\" said Burke, \"if while he was gazing with admiration on the then\r\ncommercial grandeur of England the genius should point out to him a\r\nlittle speck, scarce visible in the mass of the nation's interest, and\r\nshould tell him, 'Young man, there is America, which at this day serves\r\nfor little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men and\r\nuncouth manners, yet before you taste of death will show itself equal\r\nto the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world.\r\nWhatever England has been growing to by a progressive increase of\r\nimprovement, brought in by varieties of people, by succession of\r\ncivilizing conquests and civilizing settlements in a series of\r\nseventeen hundred years, you shall see as much added to her by America\r\nin the course of a single life!'  If this state of his country had been\r\nforetold to him, would it not require all the sanguine credulity of\r\nyouth and all the fervid glow of enthusiasm to make him believe it?\r\nFortunate man, he has lived to see it.\"  If the genius of prophecy\r\ncould have stood by Burke's shoulder then, and illuminated his noble\r\nsoul with the knowledge that is the common possession of mankind\r\nto-day, would it not have required all the sanguine credulity, all the\r\ndivine enthusiasm of genius to make him believe it?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1732-99--The death of Washington]\r\n\r\nThe war that gave the world a new nation and a republic greater than\r\nRome added one of the greatest names, and perhaps the noblest name, to\r\nthe roll-call of the great captains of the earth.  No soldier of all\r\nthose that the eyes of Dante discerned in the first circle, not even\r\n\"Caesar, all armored with gerfalcon eyes,\" adorns the annals of\r\nantiquity more than George Washington illuminates the {189} last\r\nquarter of the eighteenth century.  His splendid strength, his sweet\r\nausterity, his proud patience are hardly to be rivalled in the previous\r\nhistory of humanity, and have perhaps only been rivalled since his day\r\nby children of the same continent and of the same southern soil, who\r\nsacrificed qualities much akin to his own on a cause that, unlike his,\r\nwas not the cause of freedom.  \"First in peace, first in war, and first\r\nin the hearts of his country-men.\"  The phrase of Lee has been worn\r\nthreadbare with iteration since it was first uttered, but it always\r\nrings true of the high-minded, unfaltering soldier and honorable,\r\nsimple gentleman whose genius in war and whose modesty in peace made\r\nthe republic of America an enduring fact in history.  Long after the\r\ngreat soldier and good man had been laid to rest an English poet did\r\nhim justice, and no more than justice, by writing that \"the first, the\r\nlast, the best, the Cincinnatus of the West, whom envy dared not hate,\r\nbequeathed the name of Washington to make man blush there was but one.\"\r\nWashington was made the first President of the American Republic in\r\n1789, after resolutely resisting all suggestions to make himself king\r\nof the new commonwealth.  He served for two terms of four years each,\r\nand then retired into private life, unembittered by the cruel and\r\nstupid ingratitude of the few and unspoiled by the reasoned and\r\ngrateful homage of the many.  He died in 1799 in his quiet home in\r\nMount Vernon, while the King who still regarded him as a rebel had many\r\nyears of his unquiet reign to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{190}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nTHE GORDON RIOTS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1778-80--Sir George Savile's Catholic Relief Bill]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1778 Sir George Savile earned for himself an honorable\r\ndistinction by passing his measure for the relief of Roman Catholics.\r\nSir George Savile was a man of advanced views; he fought gallantly in\r\nthe House of Commons through five successive Parliaments, in which he\r\nrepresented York County, for all measures which he believed to be\r\nsincerely patriotic, and against all measures which he believed to be\r\nopposed to the honorable interests of his country.  He gained the\r\nlaurel of praise from Burke, who, in one of his famous Bristol\r\nspeeches, spoke of him as a true genius, \"with an understanding\r\nvigorous, acute, relined, distinguishing even to excess; and\r\nilluminated with a most unbounded, peculiar, and original cast of\r\nimagination.\"  The man whom Burke thus generously praised deserved the\r\npraises.  He strove earnestly against the American war.  He\r\nenthusiastically supported Pitt's motion in 1783 for a reform in\r\nParliament.  He was the author of an admirable Bill for the Limitation\r\nof the Claims of the Crown upon Landed Estates.  But his name is\r\nchiefly associated with his Bill for Catholic Relief, both because of\r\nthe excellent purpose of the measure itself, and because of the\r\nremarkable outburst of fanaticism which followed it.\r\n\r\nSir George Savile's measure did away with certain restrictions, certain\r\nbarbarous restrictions, as they now seem, upon English subjects\r\nprofessing the Catholic faith.  The famous Act of the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth years of King William the Third, the Act known as the Act for\r\nthe Further Preventing the Growth of Popery, had instituted certain\r\nvery harsh penal enactments against Catholics.  {192} That Act Sir\r\nGeorge Savile proposed largely to repeal.  This was a measure of relief\r\nof no great magnitude, but it did at least recognize the common\r\nhumanity of Catholic Englishmen with Protestant Englishmen; it did at\r\nleast allow to Catholic Englishmen some of the dearest and most obvious\r\nrights of citizenship.  The savage penal laws which for so long\r\nafflicted the sister island of Ireland were tempered and abrogated in\r\nthis measure as far as England was concerned, and rumor spread it\r\nabroad that a similar relief was soon to be extended to the Catholics\r\nof Scotland.  Straightway a Bill which had passed both Houses without a\r\nsingle negative aroused the fiercest opposition beyond the Border.  The\r\nannouncement of the recall of the Stuarts could not have spread a\r\ngreater panic through the ranks of the Scottish Protestants.  A violent\r\nagitation was set on foot, an agitation which could not have been more\r\nviolent if the Highlanders had once again been at the gates of\r\nEdinburgh.  An alarmist spirit spread abroad.  All manner of\r\nassociations and societies were called into being for the defence of a\r\nfaith which was not menaced.  Committees were appointed to inflame\r\nfaction and serve as the rallying points of bigotry.  Sectarian books\r\nand pamphlets of the most exaggerated and alarming kind were sown\r\nbroadcast all over the country.  The result of this kind of agitation\r\nshowed itself in a religious persecution, which gradually developed\r\ninto a religious war.  The unfortunate Catholic residents in Edinburgh,\r\nin Glasgow, and in other great Scottish towns found themselves suddenly\r\nthe victims of savage violence at the hands of mobs incited by the\r\ninflammatory utterances and the inflammatory propaganda of the\r\nProtestant committees.  In the face of the disorder which a suggestion\r\nof mercy aroused in Scotland, the Government seemed to take fright, and\r\nto abandon all thought of extending the clemency of the Relief Bill to\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nBut the Scottish agitation against the Catholics soon spread across the\r\nBorder, soon directed itself, not against the imaginary Bill which it\r\nmight be the intention of the Government to pass, but against the\r\nactual Bill which the {192} Government had passed for the benefit of\r\nEnglish Catholics.  The bigoted bodies, societies, and committees in\r\nScotland soon found their parallels in England.  The English Protestant\r\nAssociation rose into being like some sudden evocation of a wizard, and\r\nchose for its head and leader the man who had made himself conspicuous\r\nas the head and leader of the movement in Scotland--Lord George Gordon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1750-80--Lord George Gordon]\r\n\r\nLord George Gordon lives forever, a familiar figure in the minds of the\r\nEnglish-speaking race, thanks to the picture drawn by Charles Dickens.\r\nEnglishmen know, as they know the face of a friend, the ominous figure\r\n\"about the middle height, of a slender make and sallow complexion, with\r\nan aquiline nose, and long hair of a reddish brown, combed perfectly\r\nstraight and smooth about his ears and slightly powdered, but without\r\nthe faintest vestige of a curl.\"  It is a living portrait of that\r\nsolemn gentleman in the suit of soberest black, with those bright large\r\neyes in which insanity burned, \"eyes which betrayed a restlessness of\r\nthought and purpose, singularly at variance with the studied composure\r\nand sobriety of his mien, and with his quaint and sad apparel.\"  It\r\nfits well with all that we know of Lord George Gordon, to learn that\r\nthere was nothing fierce or cruel in his face, whose mildness and whose\r\nmelancholy were chiefly varied by a haunting air of \"indefinable\r\nuneasiness, which infected those who looked upon him and filled them\r\nwith a kind of pity for the man: though why it did so they would have\r\nhad some trouble to explain.\"  Such was the strange fanatic whose name\r\nwas destined to be blown for a season throughout England, who was fated\r\nto stand for a moment visible in the eyes of all men, the idol of\r\nintolerance, the apostle of violence, of murder, and of fire, and then\r\nto fall most pitiably, most pitifully into the dust.\r\n\r\nLord George Gordon was still a young man when he became leader of the\r\nanti-Catholic agitation.  He would seem in our days a very young man,\r\nfor, as he was born in 1750, he was only thirty when the agitation\r\nreached its height.  But a man of thirty was counted older than he\r\n{193} would not be reckoned, in an epoch when it was possible for a\r\nyoung man just come of age to lead the House of Commons.  Lord George\r\nGordon had led a somewhat varied life.  He had been in the navy, and\r\nhad left the service from pique, while the American war was still in\r\nits earliest stages, in consequence of a quarrel with Lord Sandwich\r\nconcerning promotion.  The restless energy which he could no longer\r\ndedicate to active service he resolved most unhappily to devote to\r\npolitical life.  He entered Parliament as the representative of the\r\nborough of Ludgershall, and soon earned for himself a considerable\r\nnotoriety in Westminster.  He had very fierce opinions; he attacked\r\neverybody and everything; his vehemence and vituperation were seasoned\r\nwith a kind of wit, and he made himself, if not a power, at least an\r\nimportant factor in the House of Commons.  Indeed, it passed into a\r\nkind of proverb at St. Stephen's that there were three parties in the\r\nState--the Ministry, the Opposition, and Lord George Gordon.\r\nParliament had seen before, and has seen since, many a politician\r\nfighting thus like Hal o' the Wynd for his own hand, but no one so\r\ninfluential for a season or so pernicious in his influence as Lord\r\nGeorge Gordon.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite clear to those who review so strange a career at this\r\ndistance of time that Lord George Gordon was of deranged intellect.  It\r\ndoes not need the alleged contrast between his professions and his\r\npractice to enforce this conclusion.  Many men have affected the\r\nreligious habit and the religious bearing while their lives were\r\nprivately profligate without deserving to be called insane except in\r\nthe sense in which any criminal excess may be regarded pathologically\r\nas a proof of madness.  Even if it were true that the long-haired and\r\nblack-habited George Gordon were the debauched profligate that Hannah\r\nMore and Horace Walpole maintained him to be, he might find\r\nfellow-sinners of unquestioned sanity.  But the conduct of his public\r\nlife goes to prove that his wits were diseased.  His behavior in the\r\nHouse, when it was not intolerably tedious, was characterized by a\r\ngrotesque buffoonery which men looked upon as laughable {194} or\r\npitiable according to their tempers, but which they had not yet learned\r\nto look upon as dangerous.  When he denounced the King as a Papist,\r\nwhen he declared that the time would come when George Gordon would be\r\nable to dictate to the Crown and Parliament, when he occasionally\r\ninterrupted his wild utterances to break into floods of tears, men\r\nsneered or yawned or laughed.  They were soon to learn that the man was\r\nsomething more than divertingly contemptible.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement that followed on the passing of the relief measure\r\nLord George Gordon found his opportunity for being actively noxious.  A\r\ngloomy fanaticism in Scotland took fire at the fear lest kindred relief\r\nshould be extended to the North Briton, and, as we have said, displayed\r\nitself in savage speech and savage deed.  In the press and from the\r\npulpit denunciations of the Catholics streamed.  The Synod of Glasgow\r\nsolemnly resolved that it would oppose any Bill brought into Parliament\r\nin favor of Scottish Catholics.  In Edinburgh and in Glasgow houses\r\nwere wrecked and lives menaced.  In Glasgow a worthy potter, Mr.\r\nBagnal, who had brought from Staffordshire its famous art, had his\r\nproperty wholly destroyed.  In Edinburgh the house of a Catholic priest\r\nwas wrecked in obedience to a brutal handbill which called upon its\r\nreaders to \"take it as a warning to meet at Leith Wynd, on Wednesday\r\nnext, in the evening, to pull down that pillar of popery lately erected\r\nthere.\"  The \"pillar of popery\" was the dwelling occupied by the\r\npriest, which was duly wrecked in obedience to the bidding of the\r\nnameless \"Protestant\" who signed the manifesto.  It is curious to note\r\na postscriptum to the handbill, which ran thus: \"Please to read this\r\ncarefully, keep it clean, and drop it somewhere else.  For King and\r\ncountry.--UNITY.\"  The means which were adopted to spread fanaticism in\r\nScotland were carefully followed when the time came for carrying the\r\nagitation into England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1778-80--The English \"Protestant Association\"]\r\n\r\nIt was indeed not necessary to be a Catholic to call down the fury of\r\nfanatical persecution.  To have expressed any sympathy for Catholicism,\r\nto have taken part in any way, {195} no matter how indirect, in the\r\nadvocacy of the relief measure, was enough to mark men out for\r\nvengeance.  Dr. Robertson, the historian, was threatened because he\r\nadvocated tolerance in religious matters.  A lawyer named Crosbie was\r\ndenounced merely because he had in the way of his regular business\r\ndrawn up the Bill intended for Parliament.  It was inevitable that the\r\naction of intolerance in Scotland should come before the notice of\r\nParliament.  Wilkes, always ostentatious in the cause of liberty,\r\ncalled upon Dundas to bring in his relief measure for Scotland.  When\r\nDundas declared that it was better to delay the measure until cooler\r\njudgment might prevail, Wilkes denounced him for allowing Parliament to\r\ntruckle to riot, and the denunciation found support in the actions of\r\nBurke and of Fox.  Lord George Gordon had found his opportunity.  He\r\nassailed Fox; he assailed Burke.  He declared that every non-Catholic\r\nin Scotland was ready to rise in arms against Catholic relief, and that\r\nthe rebels had chosen him for their leader.  He raged and vapored and\r\nthreatened on the floor of the House.  But he did more than rage and\r\nvapor and threaten.  Whether of his own motion, or prompted by others,\r\nhe formed a \"Protestant Association\" in England.  Of this, as of the\r\nsimilar Scottish Association, he was declared the head, and this\r\naccumulation of honors wholly overthrew his intelligence.  An amiable\r\nwriter has declared that \"it would be much beneath the dignity of\r\nhistory to record the excesses of so coarse a fanatic but for the fatal\r\nconsequences with which they were attended.\"  The amiable defender of a\r\ndetestable phrase does not understand that it was the excesses of the\r\nfanatic that led to the fatal consequences, and that Lord George\r\nGordon, as the ostensible head and conspicuous cause of one of the\r\ngravest events of the history of England in the eighteenth century, is\r\nin no sense beneath the \"dignity of history.\"  The business of history\r\nis with him and with such as he, as well as with the statelier,\r\nausterer figures who sanely shape the destinies of the State.  There\r\nwas plenty of fanaticism abroad in England; it was reserved for Lord\r\nGeorge Gordon to bring it together into {196} a single body, to\r\norganize it, and to employ its force with a terrible if temporary\r\nsuccess.  He issued an insane proclamation calling upon men to unite\r\nagainst Catholicism; he held a great meeting of the Protestant\r\nAssociation at Coachmakers' Hall, at which with a kind of\r\nBedlamite-brilliancy he raved against Catholicism and lashed the\r\npassions of his hearers to delirium.  It was resolved to hold a huge\r\nmeeting of the Protestant Association in St. George's Fields on June 2.\r\nAt its head Lord George Gordon was to proceed to the House of Commons\r\nand deliver the petition against Catholic relief.  All stanch\r\nProtestants were to wear blue cockades in their hats to mark out the\r\nfaithful from the unfaithful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--The Lord George Gordon riots]\r\n\r\nOn June 2, 1780, the meeting was held.  Lord George Gordon had\r\nannounced in his speech at the Coachmakers' Hall that he would not\r\ndeliver the petition if the meeting were less than twenty thousand\r\nstrong.  The number of Lord George's limit was enormously exceeded.  It\r\nis said that at least sixty thousand persons were present in St.\r\nGeorge's Fields on the appointed day, and some chroniclers compute the\r\nnumber at nearer one hundred thousand than sixty thousand.  It is\r\ncurious to note in passing that a Roman Catholic cathedral stands now\r\non the very site where this meeting was held.  After the meeting had\r\nassembled it started to march six abreast to Westminster.  The hand of\r\nthe great romancer who has made George Gordon live has renewed that\r\nmemorable day, with its noise, its tumult, its tossing banners, its\r\nshouted party cries, its chanted hymns, its military evolutions, its\r\ninsane enthusiasms, its dangerous latent passions.  Gibbon, who was\r\nthen a member of the House of Commons, declared that the assemblage\r\nseemed to him as if forty thousand Puritans of the days of Cromwell had\r\nstarted from their graves.  The forty thousand Puritans were escorted\r\nby and incorporated with a still greater body of all the ruffianism and\r\nscoundrelism that a great city can contribute to any scene of popular\r\nagitation.  What fanaticism inspired rowdyism was more than ready to\r\nprofit by.  The march to Westminster and the arrival at Westminster\r\nform one of {197} the wildest episodes in the history of London.  By\r\nthree different routes the blue-cockaded petitioners proceeded to\r\nWestminster, and rallied in the large open spaces then existing in\r\nfront of the Houses of Parliament.  The innate lawlessness of the\r\nassemblage soon manifested itself in a series of attacks upon the\r\nmembers of both Houses who were endeavoring to make their way through\r\nthe press to their respective Chambers.  It is one more example of the\r\neternal irony of history that, while the mob was buffeting members of\r\nthe Lower House, and doing its best to murder members of the Upper\r\nHouse, while a merciless intolerance was rapidly degenerating into a\r\nmerciless disorder, the Duke of Richmond was wholly absorbed in a\r\nspeech in favor of annual parliaments and universal suffrage.  Member\r\nafter member of the House of Lords reeled into the Painted Chamber,\r\ndishevelled, bleeding, with pale face and torn garments, to protest\r\nagainst the violence of the mob and the insult to Parliamentary\r\nauthority.  Ashburnham, Townshend and Willoughby, Stormont and\r\nBathurst, Mansfield, Mountfort, and Boston, one after another came in,\r\ndismayed victims of and witnesses to the violence that reigned outside.\r\nBishop after bishop entered to complain of brutal ill-treatment.  But\r\nthe Duke of Richmond was so wrapped up in his own speech and its\r\nimportance that he could only protest against anything which\r\ninterrupted its flow.  It is agreeable to find that imbecility and\r\nterror did not rule unchallenged over the Upper House that day.  One\r\naccount, that of Walpole, who is always malicious, represents Lord\r\nMansfield as sitting upon the woolsack trembling like an aspen.\r\nAnother, more creditable and more credible, declares that Lord\r\nMansfield showed throughout the utmost composure and presence of mind.\r\nAbout the gallantry of Lord Townshend there can be no doubt.  When he\r\nheard that Lord Boston was in the hands of the mob, he turned to the\r\nyounger peers about him, reminded them of their youth, and the fact\r\nthat they wore swords, and called upon them to draw with him and fight\r\ntheir way to the rescue of their brother peer.  It was at least a\r\ngallant if a hopeless suggestion.  What could the {198} rapiers of a\r\nscore of gentlemen avail against the thousands who seethed and raved\r\noutside Westminster Hall?  The solemn Duke of Richmond interfered.  If\r\nthe Lords went forth to face the mob he urged that they should go as a\r\nHouse and carrying the Mace before them.  On this a debate sprang up,\r\nwhile the storm still raged outside.  A Middlesex magistrate, called to\r\nthe bar in haste, declared that he could only offer six constables to\r\nmeet the difficulty.  A proposal to call upon the military power was\r\nfiercely opposed by Lord Shelburne.  Under such conditions the Peers\r\ndid nothing, and in the end retired, leaving Lord Mansfield alone in\r\nhis glory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--Lord George Gordon at Westminster]\r\n\r\nIf things went badly in the Upper House, they went still worse in the\r\nLower House.  While members trying to gain entrance suffered almost as\r\nmuch ill-treatment as the Peers at the hands of the mob, the Commons'\r\nHouse was much more closely leaguered than the House of Lords.  For it\r\nwas in the Commons' House that the petition was to be presented.  It\r\nwas in the Commons' House that Lord George Gordon, pale, lank-haired,\r\nblack-habited, with the blue cockade in his hat, was calling upon the\r\nCommons to receive immediately the monstrous petition.  Every entrance\r\nto the House was choked with excited humanity.  The Lobby itself was\r\noverflowing with riotous fanatics, who thundered at intervals upon the\r\nclosed doors of the Chamber with their bludgeons.  Shrieks of \"No\r\nPopery,\" and huzzas for Lord George Gordon filled the place with a\r\nhideous clamor strangely contrasting with the decorum that habitually\r\nreigned there.\r\n\r\nLord George Gordon did not cut a very heroic figure on that memorable\r\nday at Westminster.  He was perpetually rushing from his place to the\r\ndoor of the House to repeat to rowdyism in the Lobby what different\r\nmembers had said in the debates.  At one time he denounced the Speaker\r\nof the House; at another, Mr. Rous; at another, Lord North.\r\nOccasionally he praised a speaker, and his praise was more ludicrous\r\nthan his condemnation.  At one moment, when Lord George was at the door\r\ncommunicating with the crowd, Sir Michael le Fleming came up to him\r\n{199} and tried to induce him to return to his seat.  Lord George\r\nimmediately began caressing Sir Michael le Fleming in a childish,\r\nalmost in an imbecile way, patting and stroking him upon the shoulders,\r\nand expressing inarticulately a pitiful kind of joy.  He introduced Sir\r\nMichael le Fleming to the mob as a man who had just been speaking for\r\nthem.  A little later Lord George again addressed the crowd, this time\r\nfrom the little gallery, when he stimulated their passions by appeal to\r\nthe example of the Scotch, who had found no redress till they had\r\npulled down the Mass-houses.  Probably no stranger scene has ever been\r\nwitnessed at Westminster than this of the pale-faced fanatic and\r\nmadman, with the blue cockade in his hat, running backward and forward\r\nfrom the Chamber to the door of the House, delivering inflammatory\r\naddresses to the mob that raged in the Lobby, and stimulating them by\r\nhis wild harangues to persevere in their conduct, and to terrify the\r\nKing and the Parliament into obedience to their wishes.  The names of\r\nthe members who spoke against the petition he communicated to the\r\nshrieking throng; their utterances he falsely reported.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply interesting to note a fact which has escaped the notice of\r\nnot merely the most conspicuous historians of the time, but also the\r\nkeen eye of the great novelist who studied the event.  It is recorded\r\nin the \"Annual Register\" for the year 1780 that among the members whose\r\nnames Lord George Gordon denounced to the raving crowd in the Lobby the\r\nname of Mr. Burke had especial prominence.  It is curious to picture\r\nthe imbecile fanatic standing upon the steps leading to the Strangers'\r\nGallery and invoking the fury of the fanatic and the lawless against\r\nthe greatest public man of his age.\r\n\r\nFor a while Lord George Gordon was suffered to rant unimpeded.  At last\r\nColonel Holroyd, seizing hold of him, threatened to move for his\r\nimmediate committal to Newgate, while Colonel Gordon, with a blunter\r\nand yet more efficacious eloquence, declared that if any of the rioters\r\nattempted to force his way past the door of the House, he, Colonel\r\nGordon, would run his sword through {200} the body, not of the invader,\r\nbut of Lord George Gordon.  As Colonel Gordon was a kinsman of Lord\r\nGeorge's, it may be that Lord George knew sufficient of his temper to\r\nbelieve his word and was sufficiently sane to accept his warning.  At\r\nleast there came a pause in his inflammatory phrases, and shortly\r\nafterward the news of the arrival of a party of Horse and Foot Guards\r\ndid what no persuasions or entreaties could effect.  It cleared the\r\nLobby and the approaches to the House.  Under conditions of what might\r\nbe called comparative quiet the division on Lord George Gordon's\r\nproposal for the immediate reception of the petition was taken, and\r\nonly found six supporters against a majority of one hundred and\r\nninety-two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--Spread of the Gordon Riots]\r\n\r\nBut mischief was afoot and began to work.  The mob that had been\r\ndispersed from Westminster broke up into different parties and\r\nproceeded to expend its fury in the destruction of buildings.  The\r\nhustling of peers, the bonneting of bishops, the insulting of members\r\nof Parliament, all made rare sport; but the demolition of Catholic\r\nplaces of worship promised a better, and suggested exquisite\r\npossibilities of further depredation.  The Catholic chapels in Duke\r\nStreet, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and in Warwick Street, Golden Square--the\r\none belonging to the Sardinian, the other to the Bavarian\r\nMinister--were attacked, plundered, set fire to, and almost entirely\r\ndestroyed.  The military were sent for; they arrived too late to\r\nprevent the arson, but thirteen of the malefactors were seized and\r\ncommitted to Newgate, and for the night the mob was dispersed.  It was\r\nnot a bad day's work for the rioters.  Parliament had been insulted,\r\nthe Government and the very Throne menaced.  In two parts of the town\r\nCatholic buildings, under the protection of foreign and friendly\r\nPowers, stood stripped and blackened piles.  Riot had faced the\r\nbayonets of authority--had for a moment seemed ready to defy them.  Yet\r\nat first nobody seems to have taken the matter seriously or gauged its\r\ngrave significance.  Neither the Catholics, against whom the agitation\r\nwas levelled, nor the peers and prelates and members of Parliament who\r\nhad been so harshly treated seemed to understand the {201} sternness of\r\nthe situation.  There was a sense of confidence in law and order, a\r\nfeeling of security in good administration, which lulled men into a\r\nfalse confidence.\r\n\r\nThis false confidence was increased by the quiet which reigned over\r\nSaturday, June 3.  Parliament met undisturbed.  An address of Lord\r\nBathurst's, calling for a prosecution of \"the authors, abettors, and\r\ninstruments of yesterday's outrages,\" was carried after a rambling and\r\npurposeless debate, and the House of Lords adjourned till the 6th,\r\napparently convinced that there was no further cause for alarm.  This\r\npublic composure was rudely shaken on the following day, Sunday, June\r\n4.  The rioters reassembled at Moorfields.  Once again the buildings\r\nbelonging to Catholics were ransacked and demolished; once again\r\nincendiary fires blazed, and processions of savage figures decked in\r\nthe spoils of Catholic ceremonial carried terror before them.  The Lord\r\nMayor, Kennett, proved to be a weak man wholly unequal to the peril he\r\nwas suddenly called upon to face.  There were soldiers at hand, but\r\nthey were not made use of.  One act of resolution might have stayed the\r\ndisorder at the first, but no man was found resolute enough to perform\r\nthe act; and rapine, raging unchecked, became more audacious and more\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday, though the trouble grew graver, nothing was done to meet\r\nit beyond the issuing of a proclamation offering a reward of five\r\nhundred pounds for the discovery of the persons concerned in the\r\ndestruction of the chapels of the Bavarian and Sardinian Ambassadors.\r\nThe mob gathered again, bolder for the impunity with which it had so\r\nfar acted.  Large bodies of men marched to Lord George Gordon's house\r\nin Welbeck Street and paraded there, displaying the trophies stripped\r\nfrom the destroyed chapels in Moorfields.  Others began work of fresh\r\ndestruction in Wapping and in Smithfield.  Sir George Savile's house in\r\nLeicester Fields, and the houses of Mr. Rainsforth of Clare Market, and\r\nMr. Maberly of Little Queen Street, respectable tradesmen who had been\r\nactive in arresting rioters on the Friday night, were sacked and their\r\nfurniture burned in huge bonfires in the streets.  The {202} Guards who\r\nhad the task of escorting the prisoners taken on Friday to Newgate were\r\npelted.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday authority seemed to have wakened up to a vague sense\r\nthat the situation was somewhat serious.  Parliament reassembled to\r\nfind itself again surrounded and menaced by a mob, which wounded Lord\r\nSandwich and destroyed his carriage.  Lord George Gordon attended the\r\nHouse, but even his madness appeared to have taken alarm, for he had\r\ncaused a proclamation to be issued in the name of the Protestant\r\nAssociation disavowing the riots.  As he sat in his place, with the\r\nblue cockade in his hat, Colonel Herbert, who was afterwards Lord\r\nCarnarvon, called to him from across the House, telling him to take off\r\nthe badge or he would cross the floor and do it himself, Lord George's\r\nvehemence did not stand him in good stead where he himself was menaced.\r\nHe had no following in the House.  Colonel Herbert was a man of the\r\nsword and a man of his word.  Lord George Gordon took the cockade from\r\nhis hat and put it in his pocket.  If authority had acted with the\r\nfirmness of Colonel Gordon on the Friday and of Colonel Herbert on the\r\nTuesday, the tumult might have been as easily cowed as its leader.  But\r\nstill nothing was done.  The House of Commons made a half-hearted\r\npromise that when the tumult subsided the Protestant petition would be\r\ntaken into consideration, and a suggestion that Lord George ought to be\r\nexpelled was unfavorably received.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, and for two long and terrible days, riot ruled in\r\nLondon.  In all directions the evening sky was red with flames of\r\nburning buildings; in all directions organized bands of men, maddened\r\nwith drink, carried terror and destruction.  The Tuesday evening was\r\nsignalized by the most extraordinary and most daring deed that the\r\ninsurgents had yet done.  Some of the men arrested on the Friday had\r\nbeen committed to Newgate Prison.  To Newgate Prison a vast body of men\r\nmarched, and called upon Mr. Akerman, the keeper, to give up his keys\r\nand surrender his prisoners.  His firm refusal converted the mob into a\r\nbesieging army.\r\n\r\n{203}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--The burning of Newgate Prison]\r\n\r\nTwo men of genius have contributed to our knowledge of the siege of\r\nNewgate.  Crabbe, the poet, was at Westminster on the Tuesday, and\r\nafter seeing all the disturbance there he made his way with the current\r\nof destruction towards Newgate, and witnessed the astonishing capture\r\nof a massive prison by a body of men, unarmed save with such rude\r\nweapons of attack as could be hurriedly caught up.  The prison was so\r\nstrong that, had a dozen men resisted, it would have been almost\r\nimpossible to take it without artillery.  But there was nobody to\r\nresist.  Mr. Akerman, the keeper, acted with great courage, and did his\r\nduty loyally, but he could not hold the place alone.  Crowbars,\r\npickaxes, and fire forced an entrance into the prison.  \"Not Orpheus\r\nhimself,\" wrote Crabbe, \"had more courage or better luck\" than the\r\ndesperate assailants of the prison.  They broke into the blazing\r\nprison, they rescued their comrades, they set all the other prisoners\r\nfree.  Into the street, where the summer evening was as bright as\r\nnoonday with the blazing building, the prisoners were borne in triumph.\r\nSome of them had been condemned to death, and never were men more\r\nbewildered than by this strange reprieve.  The next day Dr. Johnson\r\nwalked, in company with Dr. Scott, to look at the place, and found the\r\nprison in ruins, with the fire yet glowing.  The stout-hearted Doctor\r\nwas loud in his scorn of \"the cowardice of a commercial place,\" where\r\nsuch deeds could be done without hinderance.\r\n\r\nWhile one desperate gang was busy with the destruction of Newgate,\r\nother gangs, no less desperate, were busy with destructive work\r\nelsewhere.  The new prison in Clerkenwell was broken open by one crowd,\r\nand its prisoners set free.  Another assailed Sir John Fielding's\r\nhouse, and burned its furniture in the streets.  A third attacked the\r\nhouse of Lord Mansfield in Bloomsbury Square.  This last enterprise was\r\none of the most remarkable and infamous of the bad business.  Lord\r\nMansfield and his wife had barely time to escape from the house by a\r\nback way before the mob were upon it.  The now familiar scenes of\r\nsavage violence followed.  The doors were broken open, the {204} throng\r\npoured in, and in a comparatively short time the stately mansion was a\r\nruin.  Lord Mansfield's law library, one of the finest in the kingdom,\r\nand all the judicial manuscripts made by him during his long career,\r\nwere destroyed.  A small detachment of soldiers came upon the scene too\r\nlate to prevent the destruction of the house or to intimidate the mob;\r\nalthough, according to one account, the Riot Act was read and a couple\r\nof volleys fired, with the result that several of the rioters were shot\r\nand wounded.  It is curious to find that the reports of the intended\r\npurposes of the wreckers drew persons of quality and curiosity to\r\nBloomsbury Square in their coaches as to a popular performance, and\r\nthat the destruction of Lord Mansfield's house proved more attractive\r\nthan the production of a new play.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--Public alarm in London]\r\n\r\nThe Wednesday was no less terrible than the Tuesday.  The rioters\r\nseemed to think that, like so many Mortimers, they were now Lords of\r\nLondon.  They sent messages to the keepers of the public prisons of the\r\nKing's Bench, the Fleet, and to prominent Catholic houses, informing\r\nthem of the precise time when they would be attacked and destroyed.  By\r\nthis time peaceable London was in a state of panic.  All shops were\r\nshut.  From most windows blue banners were thrust out to show the\r\nsympathy of the occupants with the agitation, and the words \"No Popery\"\r\nwere scrawled in chalk across the doors and windows of every\r\nhouseholder who wished to protect himself against the fanaticism of the\r\nmob.  At least one enterprising individual got from Lord George Gordon\r\nhis signature to a paper bidding all true friends to Protestants to do\r\nno injury to the property of any true Protestant, \"as I am well assured\r\nthe proprietor of this house is a stanch and worthy friend to the\r\ncause.\"  But there were plenty of houses where neither fear nor\r\nfanaticism displayed blue banner or chalked scrawl, houses whose owners\r\nboasted no safeguard signed by Lord George Gordon, and with these the\r\nmob busied themselves.  The description in the \"Annual Register\" is so\r\nstriking that it deserves to be cited; it is probably from the pen of\r\nEdmund Burke: \"As soon {205} as the day was drawing towards a close one\r\nof the most dreadful spectacles this country ever beheld was exhibited.\r\nLet those who were not spectators of it judge what the inhabitants felt\r\nwhen they beheld at the same time the flames ascending and rolling in\r\nclouds from the King's Bench and Fleet Prisons, from New Bridewell,\r\nfrom the toll-gates on Blackfriars Bridge, from houses in every quarter\r\nof the town, and particularly from the bottom and middle of Holborn,\r\nwhere the conflagration was horrible beyond description. . . .\r\nSix-and-thirty fires, all blazing at one time, and in different\r\nquarters of the city, were to be seen from one spot.  During the whole\r\nnight, men, women, and children were running up and down with such\r\ngoods and effects as they wished to preserve.  The tremendous roar of\r\nthe authors of these terrible scenes was heard at one instant, and at\r\nthe next the dreadful report of soldiers' musquets, firing in platoons\r\nand from different quarters; in short, everything served to impress the\r\nmind with ideas of universal anarchy and approaching desolation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the closing words of this account it is plain that at last\r\nauthority had begun to do its duty and to meet force with force.\r\nTerrorized London shook with every wild rumor.  Now men said that the\r\nmob had got arms, and was more than a match for the military; now that\r\nthe lions in the Tower were to be let loose; now that the lunatics from\r\nBedlam were to be set free.  Every alarming rumor that fear could\r\ninspire and terror credit was buzzed abroad upon that dreadful day,\r\nwhen the servants of the Secretary of State wore blue cockades in their\r\nhats and private gentlemen barricaded their houses, armed their people,\r\nand prepared to stand a siege.  Horace Walpole found his relative, Lord\r\nHertford, engaged with his sons in loading muskets to be in readiness\r\nfor the insurgents.  Everybody now shared in the general alarm, but the\r\nalarm affected different temperaments differently.  Some men fled from\r\ntown; others loaded guns and sharpened swords; others put their hands\r\nin their pockets and lounged, curious spectators, on the heels of riot,\r\neager to observe {206} and willing to record events so singular and so\r\nunprecedented.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to be able to chronicle that the King showed an especial\r\ncourage and composure during that wild week's work.  George the Third\r\nnever lost head nor heart.  To do his House justice, personal courage\r\nwas one of their traditions, but the family quality never showed to\r\nbetter advantage than in this crisis.  If indeed George the Second were\r\nprepared, as has been hinted, to fly from London on the approach of the\r\nyoung Pretender, George the Third displayed no such weakness in the\r\nface of a more immediate peril.  The peril was more immediate, it was\r\nalso more menacing.  No man could safely say where bad work so begun\r\nmight ultimately pause.  What had been an agitation in favor of a\r\npetition might end in revolution against the Crown.  Outrages that had\r\nat first been perpetrated with the purpose of striking terror only were\r\nchanging their character.  Schemes of plunder formed no part of the\r\nearly plans of the rioters; now it began to be known that the rioters\r\nhad their eyes turned towards the Bank of England and were planning to\r\ncut the pipes which provided London with water.  With a little more\r\nlaxity on the part of authority, and a few more successes on the part\r\nof the mob, it is possible that Lord George Gordon might have found\r\nhimself a puppet Caesar on the shields of Protestant Praetorians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--Stern action by the authorities]\r\n\r\nThat nothing even approaching to this did happen was largely due to the\r\ncourage and the determination of the Sovereign.  The Administration\r\nvacillated.  The Privy Council, facing an agitation of whose extent and\r\npopularity it was unaware, feared to commit itself.  George felt no\r\nsuch fear.  Where authority fell back paralyzed in the presence of a\r\nnew, unknown, and daily increasing peril, he came forward and asserted\r\nhimself after a fashion worthy of a king.  If the Privy Council would\r\nnot act with him, then he would act without them.  He would lead out\r\nhis Guards himself and charge the rioters at their head.  The courage\r\nwhich had shown itself at Dettingen, the courage which had been\r\ndisplayed by generations of rough German {207} electors and Italian\r\nprinces, showed itself gallantly now and saved the city.  The King\r\nlamented the weakness of the magistrates, but at least there was one,\r\nhe said, who would do his duty, and he touched his breast with his\r\nhand.  George the Third is not a heroic figure in history, but just at\r\nthat moment he bore himself with a royal honor which ranked him with\r\nLeonidas or Horatius.  If there are to be kings at all, that is how\r\nkings ought to behave.  George was fortunate in finding a man to stand\r\nby him and to lend to his soldierly courage the support of the law.\r\nWedderburn, the Attorney-General, declared, with all the authority of\r\nhis high position, that in cases where the civil power was unable to\r\nrestrain arson and outrage, it was the duty of all persons, civil as\r\nwell as military, to use all means in their power to deal with the\r\ndanger.  The reading of the Riot Act was nugatory in such exceptional\r\nconditions, and it became the duty of the military to attack the\r\nrioters.  Thus supported, the King ordered Wedderburn to write at once\r\nto Lord Amherst, the Commander-in-Chief, authorizing him to employ the\r\nmilitary without waiting for authority from the civil powers.\r\nWedderburn, who in a few days was to become Chief Justice and Lord\r\nLoughborough, wrote the order, kneeling upon one knee at the council\r\ntable, and from that moment the enemy was grappled with in grim earnest.\r\n\r\nIt was high time.  No less than two unsuccessful attacks had been made\r\nduring that day upon the Bank of England, but precautions had been\r\ntaken, and the successes of Newgate were not repeated in Threadneedle\r\nStreet.  The assailants were repulsed on each occasion by the military,\r\nwho occupied every avenue leading to the Bank.  Had the attack upon the\r\nBank succeeded it is impossible to form any estimate of what the result\r\nmight have been.  But it failed, and with that failure the whole\r\nhideous agitation failed as well.  But the crowning horror of the whole\r\nepisode was reserved for that final day of danger.  In Holborn, where\r\nriot raged fiercest, stood the distilleries of Mr. Langdale, a wealthy\r\nRoman Catholic.  The distilleries were attacked and fired.  Rivers of\r\nspirit ran in all the {208} conduits and blazed as they ran.  Men,\r\ndrunk with liquor and maddened with excitement, kneeled to drink, and,\r\ndrinking, fell and died where they lay.  By this time the soldiers were\r\nacting vigorously, driving the rabble before them, shooting all who\r\nresisted, as some did resist desperately.  The fire that had grown\r\nduring the week was quenched at last in blood.  On the Thursday morning\r\nLondon was safe, comparatively quiet, almost itself again.  The shops\r\nindeed were still closed, but mutiny had lived its life.  There was a\r\nshort, sharp struggle during the day in Fleet Street, between some of\r\nthe fanatics and the Guards, which was stamped out by repeated bayonet\r\ncharges which killed and wounded many.  Everywhere were blackened\r\nspaces, smouldering ruins, stains of blood, and broken weapons,\r\neverywhere the signs of outrage and of conflict.  But the incendiary\r\nfires were quenched and with them the fire of insurrection.  The riots\r\nwere at an end.  The one wish of every one was to obliterate their\r\nmemory as speedily as might be.  The stains of blood were quickly\r\nremoved from the walls of the Bank of England, from the roadway of\r\nBlackfriars Bridge.  The marks of musket shots were swiftly effaced\r\nfrom the scarred buildings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--Suppression of the Gordon Riots]\r\n\r\nIt was never fully known how far the rioters themselves suffered in the\r\nsuppression of the disorder.  The official returns give lists of 285\r\ndirect deaths, and of 173 cases of serious wounds in the hospitals.\r\nBut this can only represent a small proportion of the actual\r\ncasualties.  Many dead, many wounded, must have been carried away by\r\nfriends and hidden in hurried graves, or nursed in secret to recovery.\r\nMany, too, perished at Blackfriars Bridge, or were hideously consumed\r\nin the flames that rose from the burning of Langdale's distilleries.\r\nBut if the number of those who suffered remains an unknown quantity, it\r\nis not difficult to approximate to the destructive power of the\r\ndisturbances.  The cost of the whole bad business has been estimated at\r\nat least 180,000 pounds.  To that amount an imbecile insanity had\r\ndespoiled London.  But the imbecile insanity had incurred a deeper\r\ndebt.  In the wild trials that followed upon the panic and the violence\r\nforty-nine {209} men were condemned to death for their share in the\r\nriot, and twenty-nine of these actually suffered the last penalty of\r\nthe law.  It was not, in the eyes of some, a heavy sacrifice to pay.\r\nIt did not seem a heavy sacrifice in the eyes of John Wilkes, who\r\ndeclared that if he were intrusted with sovereign power not a single\r\nrioter should be left alive to boast of, or to plead for forgiveness\r\nfor, his offence.  But Lord George Gordon was not worth the life of one\r\nman, not to speak of nine-and-twenty.\r\n\r\nThe folly of the Administration did not end with their victory.  On the\r\n9th they did what they ought to have done long before, and arrested\r\nLord George Gordon.  But even this necessary belated act of justice\r\nthey performed in the most foolish fashion.  Everything that the pomp\r\nand ceremonial of arrest and arraignment could do was done to exalt\r\nLord George in the eyes of the mob and swell his importance.  He was\r\nconveyed to the Tower of London.  Though the rising was thoroughly\r\nstamped out, and there was practically no chance of any attempt being\r\nmade to rescue the prisoner, Lord George was escorted to the Tower by a\r\nnumerous military force in broad daylight, with an amount of display\r\nthat gave him the dignity of a hero and a martyr.  To add to the\r\nabsurdity of the whole business, the poor crazy gentleman was solemnly\r\ntried for high treason.  Many months later, in the early February of\r\nthe next year, 1781, when the riots were a thing of the past, and their\r\nterrible memory had been largely effaced, George Gordon was brought to\r\nthe Bar of the Court of King's Bench for his trial.  His wits had not\r\nmended during his confinement.  He had been very angry because he\r\nthought that he was prevented from seeing his friends.  His anger\r\ndeepened when he learned that no friends had desired to see him.  The\r\nfanatic had served his turn, and was forgotten.  He was not of that\r\ntemper which makes men devoted to a leader.  He was but the foolish\r\nfigurehead of a fanatical outburst, and when he was set aside he was\r\nforgotten.  But when he was brought up for trial a measure of popular\r\nenthusiasm in the man reasserted itself.  He behaved very strangely at\r\nhis trial, urging his right to read {210} long passages of Scripture in\r\nhis defence.  Happily for him, his defence was managed by abler hands\r\nthan his own.  The genius of Erskine, the gifts of Kenyon, were\r\nexpended in his behalf.  The unwisdom of the Government in prosecuting\r\nhim for high treason was soon apparent.  He was acquitted, to the\r\ngeneral satisfaction of his supporters, and of many who were not his\r\nsupporters.  If public thanksgiving were returned in several churches\r\nfor his acquittal, one grave manly voice was uplifted to swell the\r\napproval.  Dr. Johnson declared that he was far better pleased that\r\nLord George Gordon should escape punishment than that a precedent\r\nshould be established for hanging a man for constructive treason.\r\n\r\nThus the great Gordon riots flickered ignominiously out.  Lord George\r\nmade occasional desperate efforts to reassert himself, trying to force\r\nhimself upon the notice of the King at St. James's.  In 1787 he was\r\nfound guilty of libels upon the Queen of France and the French\r\nAmbassador.  He fled to Holland, where he was arrested by the Dutch\r\nauthorities, and shipped back to England.  He was committed to Newgate,\r\nby curious chance, on the anniversary of the day on which it had been\r\nburned by his followers.  In Newgate he lived for some years, adjuring\r\nChristianity, and declaring himself to be a follower of the Jewish\r\nfaith.  In Newgate the fanatic, renegade, madman, died of jail\r\ndistemper on November 1, 1793.  He was only forty-two years old.  In\r\nhis short, unhappy life he had done a great deal of harm, and, as far\r\nas it is possible to judge, no good whatever.  Perhaps the example of\r\nthe Gordon riots served as a precedent in another land.  If the news of\r\nthe fall of the Bastille and the September massacres reached Lord\r\nGeorge Gordon in his prison, he may have recalled to his crazed fancy\r\nthe fall of Newgate and the bloody Wednesday of the June of 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{211}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nTWO NEW MEN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--The younger Pitt and Brinsley Sheridan]\r\n\r\nThe year 1780 that witnessed the Gordon riots welcomed into political\r\nlife two men, both of whom were young, both of whom bore names that\r\nwere already familiar from an honorable parentage, and both of whom\r\nwere destined to play very conspicuous parts in the House of Commons.\r\nOne of the two men was known to his family alone, and his intimates, as\r\na youth of great promise and great knowledge, which gave to his twenty\r\nyears the ripened wisdom of a statesman and a scholar.  The other, who\r\nwas eight years older, had been for some years in the public eye, had\r\nbeen the hero of a romantic scandal which had done much to make his\r\nname notorious, and had written some dramatic works which had done more\r\nto make his name famous.  It was a fortunate chance that when the House\r\nof Commons stood in need of new blood and new men the same time and the\r\nsame year saw the return to Parliament of William Pitt and of Richard\r\nBrinsley Sheridan.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that every reader of the \"Iliad\" finds himself\r\nirresistibly compelled to take sides with one or other of the great\r\nopposing camps, and to be thenceforward either a Greek or a Trojan.  In\r\nsomething of the same spirit every student of the reign of the third\r\nGeorge becomes perforce a partisan of one or other of two statesmen who\r\ndivided the honors of its prime between them, who were opposed on all\r\nthe great questions of their day, and who represented at their best the\r\ntwo forces into which English political life was then, and is still,\r\ndivided.  The history of England for the closing years of the\r\neighteenth century and the early dawn of the nineteenth century is\r\n{212} the history of these two men and of their influence.  Those who\r\nstudy their age and their career are separated as keenly and as hotly\r\nto-day as they were separated keenly and hotly a hundred years ago into\r\nthe followers of Charles James Fox or the followers of William Pitt.\r\nThe record of English party politics is a record of long and splendid\r\nduels between recognized chiefs of the two antagonistic armies.  What\r\nthe struggle between Gladstone and Disraeli, for example, was to our\r\nown time, the struggle between Fox and Pitt was to our ancestors of\r\nthree generations ago.  All the force and feeling that made for what we\r\nnow call liberal principles found its most splendid representative in\r\nthe son of Lord Holland: all the force and feeling that rallied around\r\nthe conservative impulse looked for and found its ideal in the son of\r\nLord Chatham.  The two men were as much contrasted as the opinions that\r\nthey professed.  To the misgoverned, misguided, splendidly reckless\r\nboyhood and early manhood of Fox Pitt opposed the gravity and stillness\r\nof his youth.  The exuberant animal vitality of Fox, wasting itself\r\noverlong in the flame of aimless passions, was emphasized by the solid\r\nreserve, the passionless austerity of Pitt.  The one man was compact of\r\nall the heady enthusiasms, the splendid generosities of a nature rich\r\nin the vitality that sought eagerly new outlets for its energy, that\r\nplayed hard as it worked hard, that exulted in extremes.  The other\r\nmoved in a narrow path to one envisaged aim, and, conscious of a\r\ncertain physical frailty, husbanded his resources, limited the scope of\r\nhis fine intellect, and acted not indeed along the line of least\r\nresistance but within lines of purpose that were not very far apart.\r\nThe one explored the mountain and the valley, lingered in gardens and\r\norchards, or wandered at all adventure upon desolate heaths; the other\r\npursued in patience the white highway to his goal, untempted or at\r\nleast unconquered by allurements that could prove irresistible to his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--The character of the younger Pitt]\r\n\r\nThe two men differed as much in appearance as in mind.  The outer\r\nseeming of each is almost as familiar as the forms and faces of\r\ncontemporaries.  Fox was massively {213} corpulent, furiously untidy, a\r\nheroic sloven, his bull throat and cheeks too often black with a three\r\ndays' beard, infinitely lovable, exquisitely cultured, capable of the\r\nnoblest tenderness, yet with a kind of grossness sometimes that was but\r\na part, and perhaps an inevitable part, of his wide humanity.  Pitt was\r\nslender, boyish, precise, punctilious in attire, his native composure\r\nonly occasionally lightened by a flash of humor or sweetened by a show\r\nof playfulness, old beyond his years and young to the end of his short\r\nlife, sternly self-restrained and self-commanded, gracious in a kind of\r\nmelancholy, unconscious charm, a curiously unadorned, uncolored\r\npersonality, that attracted where it did attract with a magnetism that\r\nwas perhaps all the more potent for being somewhat difficult to\r\nexplain.  Fox was always a lover in many kinds of love, fugitive,\r\nvenal, illicit, honorable, and enduring.  Pitt carried himself through\r\ntemptations with a monastic rigor.  There was a time when his friends\r\nimplored him for the sake of appearances, and not to flout too\r\nflagrantly the manners of the time, to show himself in public with a\r\nwoman of the town.  His one love story, strange and fruitless, neither\r\ngot nor gave happiness and remains an unsolved mystery.\r\n\r\nThere were only two tastes held in common by the two men, and those\r\nwere tastes shared by most of the gentlemen of their generation and\r\ncentury, the taste for politics and the taste for wine.  Men of the\r\nclass of Holland's son, of Chatham's son, if they were not soldiers and\r\nsailors, and very often when they were soldiers and sailors, went into\r\npolitical life as naturally as they went into a university or into the\r\nhunting field.  In the case of the younger Fox and of the younger Pitt\r\nthe political direction was conspicuously inevitable from the\r\nbeginning.  The paths of both lay plain from the threshold of the\r\nnursery to the threshold of St. Stephen's.  The lad who was the chosen\r\ncompanion of his father at an age when his contemporaries had only\r\nabandoned a horn-book to grapple with Corderius, the boy who learned\r\nthe principles of elocution and the essence of debate from the lips of\r\nthe Great Commoner, were children very specially fostered in the arts\r\nof {214} statesmanship and curiously favored in the knowledge that\r\nenables men to guide and govern men.  From the other taste there was no\r\nescape, or little escape, possible for the men of that day.  It would\r\nhave been strange indeed if Fox had been absolved from the love of\r\nwine, which was held by every one he knew, from his father's old friend\r\nand late enemy Rigby to the elderly place-holder, gambler, and\r\nletter-writer Selwyn, who loved, slandered, and failed to ruin Fox's\r\nbrilliant youth.  It would have been impossible for Pitt, floated\r\nthrough a precarious childhood on floods of Oporto, to liberate his\r\nblood and judgment from the generous liquor that promised him a\r\nstrength it sapped.  It was no more disgrace to the austere Pitt than\r\nto the profligate Fox to come to the House of Commons visibly under the\r\ninfluence of much more wine than could possibly have been good for\r\nHercules.  Sobriety was not unknown among statesmen even in those days\r\nof many bottles, but intoxication was no shame, and Burke was no more\r\ncommended for his temperance than Fox, or Pitt, or Sheridan were blamed\r\nfor their intemperance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1759-80--The youth of the younger Pitt]\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt was born in 1759, when George the Second still seemed\r\nstable on his throne, and when the world knew nothing of that grandson\r\nand heir to whose service the child of Chatham was to be devoted.  He\r\nwas the fourth child and second son; the third son and last child of\r\nChatham was born two years later.  William Pitt was delicate from his\r\ninfancy, and by reason of his delicacy was never sent to school.  He\r\nwas educated by private tuition, directly guided and controlled by his\r\nfather.  From the first he was precocious, full of promise, full of\r\nperformance.  He acquired knowledge eagerly and surely; what he learned\r\nhe learned well and thoroughly.  Trained from his cradle in the\r\nacquirements essential to a public life, he applied himself, as soon as\r\nhe was of an age to appreciate his tastes and to form a purpose, to\r\nequipping himself at all points for a political career.  When the great\r\nChatham died he left behind him a son who was to be as famous as\r\nhimself, a statesman formed in his own school, trained in his own\r\nmethods, inspired by his counsels, and guided by {215} his example.  A\r\nlegend which may be more than legend has it that from the first destiny\r\nseemed determined to confront the genius and the fame of Fox with the\r\ngenius and the fame of Pitt.  It is said that the Foxes were assured by\r\na relative of the Pitts that the young son of Chatham, then a child\r\nunder a tutor's charge, showed parts which were sure to prove him a\r\nformidable rival to the precocious youth who was at once the delight\r\nand the despair of Lord Holland's life.  It is certain that the young\r\nFox was early made acquainted with the ripe intelligence and eager\r\ngenius of the younger Pitt.  It was his chance to stand with the boy\r\none night at the bar of the House of Lords, and to be attracted and\r\namazed at the avidity with which Pitt followed the debate, the sagacity\r\nwith which he commented upon what he saw and heard, and the readiness\r\nwith which he formulated answers to arguments which failed to carry\r\nconviction to his dawning wisdom.  Pitt loved the House of Commons\r\nwhile he was still in the schoolroom; it was inevitable that he should\r\nbelong to the House of Commons, and he entered it at the earliest\r\npossible moment, even before he was legally qualified to do so, for he\r\nwas not quite of age when he first took his seat.\r\n\r\nThe qualities of fairness and fitness which Greek wisdom praised in the\r\nconduct of life were characteristic of Pitt's life.  In its zealous,\r\npatient preparation for public life, its noble girding of the loins\r\nagainst great issues, its wistful renunciation of human hopes, its\r\nearly consciousness of terrible disease, its fortitude in the face of\r\ncatastrophes so unexpected and so cruel; in its pensive isolation, in\r\nthe richness of those early successes that seemed as if in anticipation\r\nto offer compensation for the early death, his life seems to have been\r\nadorned with certain ornaments and ordered by certain laws that make it\r\nstrangely comely, curiously symmetrical.  In that youth of his which\r\nwas never quite young, and which was never allowed to grow old, in his\r\naustere attitude to so much that youth holds most dear, in the high\r\npassion of his patriotism with its eager desire, so often and so\r\nsternly thwarted, to add to England's glory, he stands apart from {216}\r\nmany greater and many wiser men, in a melancholy, lonely dignity.  It\r\nhas been given to few men to inspire more passionate attachment in the\r\nminds of his contemporaries; it has been given to few statesmen to be\r\nregarded abroad, by eyes for the most part envious or hostile, as\r\npre-eminently representative of the qualities that made his country at\r\nonce disliked and feared.  His political instincts were for the most\r\npart admirable, and if it had been his fortune to serve a sovereign\r\nmore reasonable, more temperate, and more intelligent than George the\r\nThird his name might have been written among the great reformers of the\r\nworld.  At home an unhappy deference to the dictates of a rash and\r\nincapable king, abroad an enforced opposition to one of the greatest\r\nforces and one of the greatest conquerors that European civilization\r\nhas seen, prevented Pitt from gaining that position to which his\r\ngenius, under conditions less persistently unhappy, would have entitled\r\nhim.  To have gained what he did gain under such conditions was in\r\nitself a triumph.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer who entered Parliament at the same period as William Pitt\r\nwas as curiously unlike him as even Fox himself.  If few knew anything\r\nof Pitt every one knew something of Sheridan, who had already made fame\r\nin one career and was now about to make fame in another.  It may afford\r\nconsolation to the unappreciated to reflect that the most famous\r\nEnglish dramatist since Shakespeare's day, the brightest wit of an age\r\nwhich piqued itself into being considered witty, the most brilliant\r\norator of an age which regarded oratory as one of the greatest of the\r\narts, and whose roll is studded with the names of illustrious orators,\r\nthe most unrivalled humorist of a century which in all parts of the\r\nworld distinguished itself by its love of humor, was looked upon in his\r\nnonage as a dull, unpromising boy, chiefly remarkable for his idleness\r\nand carelessness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1751-80--The parents of Brinsley Sheridan]\r\n\r\nThe quality which we now call Bohemianism certainly ran in Sheridan's\r\nblood.  His grandfather, Dr. Thomas Sheridan, the friend of Swift, the\r\nDublin clergyman and schoolmaster, was a delightfully amiable, wholly\r\nreckless, {217} slovenly, indigent, and cheerful personage.  His\r\nfather, Thomas Sheridan, was a no less cheerful, no less careless man,\r\nwho turned play-actor, and taught elocution, and married a woman who\r\nwrote novels and a life of Swift.  At one time he could boast the\r\nfriendship of Dr. Johnson, who seems to have regarded him with an\r\nill-humored contempt, but Dr. Johnson's expression of this contempt\r\nbrought about a quarrel.  The most remarkable thing about him is that\r\nhe was the father of his son.  Neither he nor his wife appears to have\r\nhad any idea of their good fortune.  Mrs. Sheridan once declared of her\r\ntwo boys that she had never met with \"two such impenetrable dunces.\"\r\nNone the less the father contrived with difficulty to scrape together\r\nenough money to send his boys to Harrow, and there, luckily, Dr. Parr\r\ndiscerned that Richard, with all his faults, was by no means an\r\nimpenetrable dunce.  Both he and Sumner, the head-master of Harrow,\r\ndiscovered in the schoolboy Sheridan great talents which neither of\r\nthem was capable of calling into action.\r\n\r\nRichard Sheridan came from Harrow School and Harrow playgrounds to\r\nLondon, and, later on, to Bath.  London did not make him much more\r\nindustrious or more careful than he had been at Harrow-on-the-Hill.  It\r\nwas far pleasanter to translate the honeyed Greek of Theocritus, with\r\nits babble of Sicilian shepherds, its nymphs and waters and Sicilian\r\nseas, than to follow the beaten track of ordinary education.  It was\r\nvastly more entertaining to translate the impassioned prose of\r\nAristaenetus into impassioned verse, especially in collaboration with a\r\ncherished friend, than to yawn over Euclid and to grumble over Cocker.\r\nThe translation of Aristaenetus, the boyish task of Sheridan and his\r\nfriend Halhed, still enjoys a sort of existence in the series of\r\nclassical translations in Bohn's Library.  It is one of the ironies of\r\nliterature that fate has preserved this translation while it has\r\npermitted the two Begum speeches, that in the House of Commons and that\r\nin Westminster Hall, practically to perish.  What little interest does\r\nnow cling to the early work belongs to the fact of its being a\r\ncollaboration.  Halhed, who worked {218} with Sheridan at the useless\r\ntask, was a clever young Oxford student, who was as poor as he was\r\nclever, and who seemed to entertain the eccentric idea that large sums\r\nof money were to be readily obtained from the reading public for a\r\nrendering in flippant verse of the prose of an obscure author whose\r\nvery identity is involved in doubt.  Aristaenetus did not become the\r\ntalk of the town even in spite of an ingeniously promulgated rumor\r\nassigning the authorship of the verses to Dr. Johnson.  Neither did the\r\nplays and essays in which the friends collaborated meet with any\r\nprosperous fate.\r\n\r\nFrom the doing of Greek prose into English verse Sheridan and Halhed\r\nturned to another occupation, in which, as in the first, they were both\r\nof the same mind.  They both fell in love, and both fell in love with\r\nthe same woman.  All contemporary accounts agree in regarding the\r\ndaughter of Linley the musician as one of the most beautiful women of\r\nher age.  Those who knew the portrait which the greatest painter of his\r\ntime painted of Sheridan's wife as St. Cecilia will understand the\r\nextraordinary, the almost universal homage which society and art, wit\r\nand wealth, and genius and rank paid to Miss Linley.  Unlike the girl\r\nin Sheridan's own poem, who is assured by her adorer that she will meet\r\nwith friends in all the aged and lovers in the young.  Miss Linley\r\nfound old men as well as young men competing for her affection and for\r\nthe honor of her hand.\r\n\r\nSheridan and Halhed were little more than boys when they first beheld\r\nand at once adored Miss Linley.  Charles Sheridan, Richard's elder\r\nbrother, was still a very young man.  But Miss Linley had old lovers\r\ntoo, men long past the middle pathway of their lives, who besought her\r\nto marry them with all the impetuosity of youth.  One of them, whom she\r\nwisely rejected on the ground that wealth alone could not compensate\r\nfor the disparity in years, carried off his disappointment gracefully\r\nenough by immediately settling a sum of three thousand pounds upon the\r\nyoung lady.\r\n\r\nThere is an air of romance over the whole course of {219} Sheridan's\r\nattachment to Miss Linley.  For a long time he contrived to keep his\r\nattachment a secret from his elder brother, Charles, and from his\r\nfriend Halhed, both of whom were madly in love with Miss Linley, and\r\nneither of whom appears to have had the faintest suspicion of finding a\r\nrival, the one in so close a kinsman, the other in his own familiar\r\nfriend.  It must be admitted that Sheridan does not appear to have\r\nbehaved with that uprightness which was to be expected from his\r\ngallant, impetuous nature.  Not merely did he keep his secret from his\r\nbrother and his friend, but he seems to have allowed his friend to look\r\nupon him as a confidant and ally in pressing Halhed's suit upon Miss\r\nLinley.  Halhed reproached him sadly, but not bitterly, in a poetical\r\nepistle, the value of which is more personal than poetical, when he\r\ndiscovered the real mind of his friend.  Then, like a wise man if a sad\r\none, Halhed went away.  He sailed for India, the golden land of so many\r\nwrecked hopes and disappointed ambitions; he long outlived his first\r\nlove and his successful rival; he became in the fulness of time a\r\nmember of Parliament, and he died in 1830.  He is dimly remembered as\r\nthe author of a grammar of the Bengalee language and of a work on\r\nGentoo laws translated from the Persian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1771--Marriage of Sheridan and Miss Linley]\r\n\r\nSheridan's courtship progressed more and more romantically.  The\r\npersecutions of a married rake named Matthews drove Miss Linley to fly\r\nto France with Sheridan, to whom she was secretly married at Calais.\r\nThe revengeful and disappointed Matthews inserted a libellous attack\r\nupon Sheridan in the _Bath Chronicle_.  Sheridan extorted at his\r\nsword's point a public apology from Matthews.  Further and baser\r\nmendacity on the part of Matthews provoked a second duel, in which the\r\ncombatants seem to have fought with desperate ferocity, and in which\r\nSheridan, badly wounded, refused to ask his life at the hands of his\r\nantagonist and was only rescued by the seconds.  A long period of\r\nseparation followed, full of dark hours for Sheridan, hours only\r\nbrightened by occasional meetings of the most eccentric kind, as when\r\nthe wild young poet, quaintly {220} disguised in the complicated capes\r\nof a hackney coachman, had the tormenting privilege of driving his\r\nbeloved from Covent Garden Theatre, where her voice and beauty were\r\nnightly charming all London.  At last the opposition of Linley was\r\novercome, and on April 13, 1773, the most brilliant man and most\r\nbeautiful woman of their day were for the second time and more formally\r\nmarried, and a series of adventures more romantic than fiction came to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nThe romance, it is agreeable to think, did not conclude with the\r\nmarriage ceremony.  Sheridan seems to have offered his wife as devoted\r\nan attachment after her marriage as he had shown in the days of\r\nduelling and disguising that preceded it.  He wrote verses to her, and\r\nshe wrote verses to him, long after they had settled down to serene\r\ndomesticity, which breathe the most passionate expressions of mutual\r\nlove.  And yet there is a legend--it is to be hoped and believed that\r\nit is only a legend--which ends the romance very sadly.  According to\r\nthe legend young Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Sheridan's close friend, felt\r\nmore than a friend's admiration for the wife of his friend.  According\r\nto the legend Elizabeth Sheridan returned the passion, which by the\r\nunhappiness it brought with it shortened her life.  According to the\r\nlegend Lord Edward only married the fair Pamela, Philippe Egalité's\r\ndaughter, because of the striking resemblance she bore to the St.\r\nCecilia of his dreams.  The legend rests on the authority of Madame de\r\nGenlis, who was probably Pamela's mother and who is no infallible\r\nauthority.  It is possible that the undoubted resemblance of Pamela to\r\nMrs. Sheridan is the origin of the whole story.  Lord Edward was always\r\nfalling in love in a graceful, chivalrous kind of way.  But there is no\r\nserious proof that his friendship for Mrs. Sheridan was anything more\r\nthan the friendship an honorable man may entertain for the wife of his\r\nfriend.  The graver and more authentic story of Fitzgerald's life has\r\nyet to be told in these pages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775--Sheridan as dramatist and politician]\r\n\r\nFor a brief period after his marriage Sheridan thought of devoting\r\nhimself to the law.  But his thoughts and {221} tastes were otherwise\r\ninclined, and on January 27, 1775, not quite two years after his\r\nmarriage, \"The Rivals\" was produced at Covent Garden and a new chapter\r\nopened in the history of dramatic literature.  It is curious to think\r\nthat the clumsiness of the player to whom the part of Sir Lucius\r\nO'Trigger was given came very near to damning the most brilliant comedy\r\nthat the English stage had seen for nearly two centuries.  The happy\r\nsubstitution of actor Clinch for actor Lee, however, saved the piece\r\nand made Sheridan the most popular author in London.  How grateful\r\nSheridan felt to Clinch for rescuing Sir Lucius is shown by the fact\r\nthat his next production, the farce called \"St. Patrick's Day; or, the\r\nScheming Lieutenant,\" was expressly written to afford opportunity for\r\nClinch's peculiar talents.  In 1777 came \"The School for Scandal,\"\r\nSheridan's masterpiece, which was followed by Sheridan's last dramatic\r\nwork, \"The Critic.\"  Never probably before was so splendid a success\r\ngained so rapidly, so steadily increased in so short a time, to come so\r\nabruptly to an end in the very pride of its triumph.\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly the most famous English author then alive found\r\nopportunity for the display of wholly new and unexpected talents, and\r\nbecame one of the most famous politicians and orators alive.  There\r\nhad, indeed, always been a certain political bent in Sheridan's mind.\r\nHe had tried his hand at many political pamphlets, fragments of which\r\nwere found among his papers by Moore.  He had always taken the keenest\r\ninterest in the great questions which agitated the political life of\r\nthe waning eighteenth century.  The general election of 1780 gave him\r\nan opportunity of expressing this interest in the public field, and he\r\nwas returned to Parliament as member for the borough of Stamford.  It\r\nis difficult to find a parallel in our history for the extraordinary\r\nsuccess which attended Sheridan in his political life as it had already\r\nattended him in his dramatic career.\r\n\r\nJust on the threshold of his political career Sheridan lost the wife he\r\nloved so well.  He was profoundly afflicted, but the affliction\r\nlessened and he married a Miss {222} Ogle.  There is a story told in\r\nconnection with this second marriage which is half melancholy, half\r\nhumorous, and wholly pathetic.  The second Mrs. Sheridan, young,\r\nclever, and ardently devoted to her husband, was found one day,\r\naccording to this story, walking up and down her drawing-room\r\napparently in a frantic state of mind because she had discovered that\r\nthe love-letters Sheridan had sent to her were the same as those which\r\nhe had written to his first wife.  Word for word, sentence for\r\nsentence, passion for passion, they were the same letters.  No doubt\r\nSheridan made his peace.  It is to be presumed that he thought the\r\nletters so good that they might very well serve a second turn; but this\r\nact of literary parsimony was not happy.  Parsimony of his written work\r\nwas, however, Sheridan's peculiarity.  Verses addressed to his dear St.\r\nCecilia make their appearance again and again, under altered\r\nconditions, in his plays.  It is singular enough, as has been happily\r\nsaid, that the treasures of wit which Sheridan was thought to possess\r\nin such profusion should have been the only species of wealth which he\r\never dreamed of economizing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{223}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nFOX AND PITT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1781--Fall of the Lord North Administration]\r\n\r\nPitt entered public life the inheritor of a great name, the transmitter\r\nof a great policy, at a time when the country was in difficulty and the\r\nGovernment in danger.  In the January of 1781 North was still in power,\r\nwas still supported by the King, had still some poor shreds of hope that\r\nsomething, anything might happen to bring England well out of the\r\nstruggle with America.  In the November of the same year North reeled to\r\nhis fall with the news of the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.  In\r\nthose ten months Pitt had already made himself a name in the House of\r\nCommons.  He was no longer merely the son of Pitt; he was Pitt.  He had\r\nattached himself to an Opposition that was studded with splendid names,\r\nand had proved that his presence added to its lustre.  The heroes and\r\nleaders of Opposition at Westminster welcomed him to their ranks with a\r\ngenerous admiration and enthusiasm.  Fox, ever ready to applaud possible\r\ngenius, soon pronounced him to be one of the first men in Parliament.\r\nBurke hailed him, not as a chip of the old block, but as the old block\r\nitself.  The praises of Burke and of Fox were great, but they were not\r\nundeserved.  When the Ministry of Lord North fell into the dust, when the\r\nKing was compelled to accept the return of the Whigs to office, Pitt had\r\nalready gained a position which entitled him in his own eyes not to\r\naccept office but to refuse it.\r\n\r\nRockingham formed a Ministry for the second time.  The new Ministry was\r\nformed of an alliance between the two armies of the Rockingham Whigs and\r\nthe Shelburne Whigs.  Rockingham represented the political principles\r\nthat dated from the days of Walpole.  {224} Shelburne represented, or\r\nmisrepresented, the principles that dated from the days of Chatham.  The\r\nKing would very much have preferred to take Shelburne without Rockingham,\r\nbut even the King had to recognize that it was impossible to gratify his\r\npreference.  Even if Shelburne had been a much better leader than he was\r\nhe had not the following which would entitle him to form a Ministry on\r\nhis own account.  And Shelburne was by no means a good leader.  To the\r\nLiberal politician of to-day Shelburne seems a much more desirable and\r\nadmirable statesman than Rockingham.  Most of his political ideas were in\r\nadvance of his time, and his personal friendships prove him to have been\r\na man of appreciative intelligence.  He had proved his courage in his\r\nyouth as a soldier at Campen and Minden; he had maintained his courage in\r\n1780 when he faced and was wounded by the pistol of Fullarton.  But his\r\ngifts, whatever they were, were not of the quality nor the quantity to\r\nmake a leader of men.  He could not form a Ministry for himself, and he\r\nwas not an element of stability in any Ministry of which he was a member.\r\nThe Administration formed by the alliance of Rockingham and Shelburne\r\ncould boast of many brilliant names, and showed itself laudably anxious\r\nto add to their number.  In an Administration which had Fox for a\r\nSecretary of State, Burke for Paymaster-General of the Forces, and\r\nSheridan for Under-Secretary of State, the Vice-Treasurership of Ireland\r\nwas offered to Pitt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1782--Fox's quarrel with Pitt]\r\n\r\nPitt declined the offer.  He had made up his mind that he would not\r\naccept a subordinate situation.  Conscious of his ability, he was\r\nprepared to wait.  He had not to wait long.  During the four agitated\r\nmonths of life allowed to the Rockingham Administration Pitt\r\ndistinguished himself by a motion for reform in the representative system\r\nwhich was applauded by Fox and by Sheridan, but which was defeated by\r\ntwenty votes.  Peace and reform were always passions deeply seated at the\r\nheart of Pitt; it was ironic chance that associated him hereafter so\r\nintimately with war and with antagonism to so many methods of reform in\r\nwhich he earnestly believed.  When the quarrels {225} between Fox and\r\nShelburne over the settlement of the American war ended after\r\nRockingham's death in July, 1782, in the withdrawal from the Ministry of\r\nFox, Burke, and the majority of the Rockingham party, Pitt rightly saw\r\nthat his hour had come.  Fox resigned rather than serve with Shelburne,\r\nPitt accepted Shelburne, and made Shelburne's political existence\r\npossible a little longer.  With the aid of Pitt, Shelburne could hold on\r\nand let Fox go; without Pitt, Fox would have triumphed over Shelburne.\r\nFrom this moment began the antagonism between Fox and Pitt which was to\r\nlast for the remainder of their too brief lives.  At the age of\r\ntwenty-three Pitt found himself Chancellor of the Exchequer, and one of\r\nthe most conspicuous men in the kingdom.  Fox, who was ten years older,\r\nwas defeated by the youth whose rivalry had been predicted to Fox when\r\nthe youth was yet a child.\r\n\r\nPitt's triumph lasted less than a year.  Fox, conscious of his own great\r\npurposes, and eager to return to office for their better advancement, was\r\nprepared to pay a gambler's price for power.  To overthrow Shelburne and\r\nwith Shelburne Pitt, he needed a pretext and an ally.  The pretext was\r\neasy to find.  He had but to maintain that the terms of the peace with\r\nAmerica were not the best that the country had a right to expect.  The\r\nally was easy to find and disastrous to accept.  Nothing in the whole of\r\nFox's history is more regrettable than his unnatural alliance with Lord\r\nNorth.  Ever since the hour when Fox had found his true self, and had\r\npassed from the ranks of the obedient servants of the King into the ranks\r\nof those who devoted themselves to the principles of liberty, there had\r\nbeen nothing and there could have been nothing in common between Fox and\r\nNorth.  Everything that Fox held most dear was detestable to North, as\r\nNorth's political doctrines were now detestable to Fox.  The political\r\nenmity of the two men had been bitter in the extreme, and Fox had\r\nassailed North with a violence which might well seem to have made any\r\nform of political reconciliation impossible.  Yet North was now the man\r\nwith whom Fox was content to throw in his lot in order to obtain the\r\n{226} overthrow of Shelburne and of Pitt.  And Fox was not alone among\r\ngreat Whigs in this extraordinary transaction.  He carried Burke with him\r\nin this unholy alliance between all that was worst and all that was best\r\nin English political life.  The two men whose genius and whose eloquence\r\nhad been the most potent factors in the fall of North a year before were\r\nnow the means of bringing the discredited and defeated statesman back\r\nagain into the exercise of a power which, as none knew better than they,\r\nhe had so shamefully misused.  Fox and North between them swept Shelburne\r\nout of the field.  Fox and North between them were able to force a\r\nCoalition Ministry upon a reluctant and indignant King.  The followers of\r\nFox and the followers of North in combination formed so numerous and so\r\nsolid a party that they were able to treat the sovereign with a lack of\r\nceremony to which he was little used.  Fox had gone out of office rather\r\nthan admit that the right to nominate the first minister rested with the\r\nKing instead of with the Cabinet.  Now that he had returned to office, he\r\nshowed his determination to act up to his principles by not permitting\r\nthe King to nominate a single minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1783--Fox's coalition with Lord North]\r\n\r\nThe King's contempt for North since the failure to coerce America, the\r\nKing's dislike of Fox since Fox became an advanced politician, were\r\ndeepened now into uncompromising and unscrupulous enmity by the cavalier\r\nconduct of the coalition.  The King, with his doggedness of purpose and\r\nhis readiness to use any weapons against those whom he chose to regard as\r\nhis enemies, was a serious danger even to a coalition that seemed so\r\nformidable as the coalition between Fox and North.  Fox may very well\r\nhave thought that his unjustifiable league with North would at least have\r\nthe result of giving him sufficient time and sufficient influence to\r\ncarry into effect some of those schemes for the good of the country which\r\nhe had most nearly at heart.  The statesman who makes some unhappy\r\nsurrender of principle, some ignoble concession to opportunity in order\r\nto obtain power, makes his unworthy bargain from a conviction that his\r\nhold of office is essential to the welfare of the State, and that a\r\nlittle {227} evil is excusable for a great good.  The sophistry that\r\ndeceives the politician does not deceive the public.  Fox gravely injured\r\nhis position with the people who loved him by stooping to the pact with\r\nNorth, and he did not reap that reward of success in his own high-minded\r\nand high-hearted purposes which could alone have excused his conduct.\r\nThe great coalition which was to stand so strong and to work such wonders\r\nwas destined to vanish like a breath after accomplishing nothing, and to\r\ncondemn Fox with all his hopes and dreams to a career of almost unbroken\r\nopposition for the rest of his life.  If anything in Fox's checkered\r\ncareer could be more tragic than the degradation of his union with the\r\npolitician whom he declared to be void of every principle of honor and\r\nhonesty, it was the abiding consequences of the retribution that followed\r\nit.  Fox had fought hard and with success to live down the follies of his\r\nyouth.  He had to fight harder and with far less success to live down\r\nwhat the world persisted in regarding as the infamy of his association\r\nwith North.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to realize the arguments which persuaded Fox, which\r\npersuaded Burke, to join their forces with the fallen minister whom their\r\nown mouths, but a little while before, had, in no measured terms,\r\ndeclared to be guilty of the basest conduct and deserving of the severest\r\npunishment.  All that we know of Fox, all that we know of Burke--and it\r\nis possible to know them almost as well as if they were the figures of\r\ncontemporary history--would seem to deny the possibility of their\r\ncondescending to any act of conscious baseness.  Stained and sullied as\r\nthe youth of Fox had been with some of the more flagrant vices of a\r\nflagrantly vicious society, his record as gambler, as spendthrift, and as\r\nlibertine seems relatively clean in comparison with this strange act of\r\npublic treason to the chosen beliefs of his manhood, of public apostasy\r\nfrom those high and generous principles by whose strenuous advocacy he\r\nhad redeemed his wasted youth.  Fiery as Burke's temper had often proved\r\nitself to be, fantastic and grotesque as his obstinacy had often showed\r\nitself in {228} clinging defiantly to some crotchet or whimsey, that\r\nseemed to the spectator unworthy the adhesion of his great intellect, his\r\nmost eccentric action, his most erratic impulse, appeared sweetly\r\nreasonable and serenely lucid when contrasted with the conduct that\r\nallowed him to guide or be guided by Fox in a course that proved as\r\nfoolish as it looked disgraceful, to lead or to follow Fox into packing\r\ncards with their arch-enemy of the American war.\r\n\r\nOn the face of it there is nothing that seems not merely to justify, but\r\neven to palliate, the conduct of Fox and Burke.  Ugly as the deed seemed\r\nto the men of their day, to the men who believed in them, trusted them,\r\nloved them, it seems no less ugly to those who at the distance of a\r\ncentury revere their memories and cherish their teachings.  One thing may\r\nbe, must be, assumed by those before whom the lives of Fox and Burke lie\r\nbare--that men so animated by high principles, so illuminated by high\r\nideals, cannot deliberately, of set purpose, have sinned against the\r\nlight.  They must have felt, and strongly felt, their justification for\r\nentering on a course which was destined to prove so disastrous.  Their\r\njustification probably was the conviction, nursed if not expressed, that\r\nto statesmen whose hands were so full of blessings, to statesmen whose\r\nhearts were so big with splendid enterprises, a trivial show of\r\nconcession, a little paltering with the punctilio of honor, a little\r\neating of brave words, and a little swallowing of principle, was a small\r\nprice to pay and a price well worth paying for the immeasurable good that\r\nEngland was to gather from their supremacy.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the motives which induced Fox and Burke to ally\r\nthemselves with a discredited and defeated politician like Lord North,\r\nthe results of that alliance were as unsatisfactory to the high\r\ncontracting parties as the most rigid believer in poetic justice could\r\ndesire.  The Coalition Ministry was unlucky enough in its enterprises to\r\nsatisfy George himself, who had talked of going back to Hanover rather\r\nthan accept its services, and had only been dissuaded from self-exile by\r\nthe sardonic reminder of Lord Thurlow that it might be easier for the\r\n{229} King to go to Hanover than to return again to England.  Burke\r\ninaugurated his new career at the Pay Office by an unhappy act of\r\npatronage.  He insisted upon restoring to their offices two clerks, named\r\nPowell and Bembridge, who had been removed and arraigned for\r\nmalversation, and he insisted upon defending his indefensible action in\r\nthe House of Commons with a fury that was as diverting to his opponents\r\nas it was distracting to his colleagues.  Fox, who had earned so large a\r\nshare of public admiration for his advocacy of what now would be called\r\nliberal opinions, was naturally held responsible by the public for the\r\nsuccessful opposition of the Coalition Ministry to Pitt's plan of\r\nParliamentary reform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1783--Legislation of the Coalition Ministry]\r\n\r\nPitt's proposal was not very magnificent.  He asked the House to declare\r\nthat measures were highly necessary to be taken for the future prevention\r\nof bribery and expense at elections.  He urged that for the future, when\r\nthe majority of voters for any borough should be convicted of gross and\r\nnotorious corruption before a select committee of the House appointed to\r\ntry the merits of any election, such borough should be disfranchised and\r\nthe minority of voters not so convicted should be entitled to vote for\r\nthe county in which such borough should be situated.  He suggested that\r\nan addition of knights of the shire and of the representatives of the\r\nmetropolis should be made to the state of the representation.  He left\r\nthe number to the discussion and consideration of the House, but for his\r\nown part he stated that he should propose an addition of one hundred\r\nrepresentatives.  Pitt's scheme was scarcely a splendid measure of\r\nreform; but at least it was a measure of reform, and it met with small\r\nmercy at the hands of the coalition, being defeated by a majority of 293\r\nto 149.  This was not an auspicious beginning for the new Ministry, and\r\nit was scarcely surprising that many of Fox's adherents in the country\r\nshould resent his employment of the swollen forces that were practically\r\nif not technically under his command to compass the defeat of a bill\r\nwhich, however inadequate, did at least endeavor to bring about a\r\nmuch-needed improvement.\r\n\r\n{230}\r\n\r\nThe great adventure of the Coalition Ministry, the deed by which it hoped\r\nto justify its existence, and by which indeed it has earned its only\r\nhonorable title to remembrance, was the bill which is known to the world\r\nas Fox's India Bill.  If the extending influence of England in India was\r\na source of pride to the English people, it was also a source of grave\r\nresponsibility.  The conditions under which that influence was exercised,\r\nthe weaknesses and inadequacies of the system by which the East India\r\nCompany exercised its semi-regal authority, were becoming more apparent\r\nwith every succeeding year to the small but steadily increasing number of\r\npersons who took a serious and intelligent interest in Indian affairs.  A\r\nseries of events, to be referred to later, had served to force into a\r\nspecial prominence the difficulties and the dangers of the existing state\r\nof affairs and to fasten the attention of thinkers upon the evils that\r\nhad resulted, and the evils that must yet result from its continuance.\r\nTo mitigate those evils in the present, and to minimize them in the\r\nfuture, Fox, inspired and aided by Burke's splendid knowledge of Indian\r\naffairs, worked out a measure which was confidently expected to\r\nsubstitute order for disorder and reason for unreason.  In the November\r\nof 1783, Pitt addressed a challenge to the Ministry calling upon them to\r\nbring forward some measure securing and improving the advantages to be\r\nderived from England's Eastern possessions, some measure not of temporary\r\npalliation and timorous expedients, but vigorous and effectual, suited to\r\nthe magnitude, the importance, and the alarming exigencies of the case.\r\nFox answered this challenge by asking leave to bring in a bill \"for\r\nvesting the affairs of the East India Company in the hands of certain\r\ncommissioners for the benefit of the proprietors and the public.\"  At the\r\nsame time Fox asked leave to bring in another bill \"for the better\r\ngovernment of the territorial possessions and dependencies in India.\"\r\nThese two bills, supplementing each other, formed, in the opinion of\r\nthose who framed and who advocated them, a simple, efficient, and\r\nresponsible plan for the better administration of England's Indian {231}\r\ndependencies.  However tentative and incomplete they may now appear as a\r\nmeans of dealing with a problem of such vast importance and such\r\nfar-reaching consequences, they certainly were measures the adoption of\r\nwhich must have proved a gain to the country governing and to the country\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1783--Fox and the affairs of India]\r\n\r\nThe measures, which, it is probable, were originally planned out by\r\nBurke, but to which it is certain that Fox devoted all the strength of\r\nhis intellect and all the enthusiasm of his nature, were of a daring and\r\ncomprehensive character.  The first proposed to make a clean sweep of the\r\nexisting state of things in India by the appointment of a Board composed\r\nof seven commissioners to whom absolute authority over the East India\r\nCompany's property, and over the appointment or removal of holders of\r\noffices in India, was to be intrusted for a term of four years.  This\r\nterm of four years was not to be affected by any changes of\r\nadministration that might occur in England during the time.  The commerce\r\nof the Company was to be managed by a council of directors, who were\r\nthemselves entirely under the control of the seven commissioners.  The\r\ncommissioners and the directors were required to lay their accounts\r\nbefore the proprietors every six months, and before both Houses at the\r\nbeginning of every session.  The commissioners were in the first instance\r\nto be appointed by Parliament, that is to say, by the Ministry headed by\r\nFox and North; at the end of the four years they were to be appointed by\r\nthe Crown.  The Court of Proprietors was to fill up the vacancies in the\r\ncouncil of directors.  The second and less important measure dealt with\r\nthe powers of the Governor-General and Council and the conduct to be\r\nobserved towards the princes and natives of India.\r\n\r\nThe first measure was the measure of paramount importance, the measure\r\nfrom which Fox and his friends hoped so much, the measure which aroused\r\nin a very peculiar degree the anger of the King and of the King's\r\nfollowers.  They saw in a moment the enormous influence that the passing\r\nof the measure would place in the hands of Fox.  The names of the\r\ncommissioners were left blank {232} in the bill, but when their time came\r\nto be filled up in committee they were all filled with the names of\r\nfollowers of Fox.  It was argued that were the bill to become law a set\r\nof persons extremely obnoxious to the King would have in their hands for\r\na solid term of years the entire administration of India and the control\r\nof an amount of patronage, estimated at not less than three hundred\r\nthousand a year.  This would enable them to oppose to the royal\r\nprerogative of patronage an influence of like nature that brought with it\r\nscarcely less than royal power.  It is scarcely surprising that Pitt\r\nshould have employed all his eloquence and all his energy against what he\r\ndescribed as \"the boldest and most unconstitutional measure ever\r\nattempted, transferring at one stroke, in spite of all charters and\r\ncompacts, the immense patronage and influence of the East to Charles Fox\r\nin or out of office.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1783--Henry Dundas and James Sayer]\r\n\r\nIf Pitt was the most conspicuous opponent of the India Bills, only less\r\nconspicuous was a man who, though much Pitt's senior, was still young,\r\nand who had already made himself prominent in the House of Commons, not\r\nmerely as a politician of general ability, but as one who took a special\r\ninterest in the affairs of India.  Henry Dundas had been a characteristic\r\nornament of the Scottish bar, at once a skilful lawyer and an attractive\r\nman of the world when, eight years before the existence of the Coalition\r\nMinistry, he had come to St. Stephen's as Lord Advocate.  An ambition to\r\nshine as a statesman and an extraordinary power of application had\r\nequipped him with the varied information that enabled him to assert\r\nhimself as an authority in many departments of national business.  He had\r\nearly recognized the importance of India as a field for the powers of a\r\nrising politician, and he had devoted to India and to Indian affairs that\r\ntireless assiduity which permitted him at once to appear a convivial\r\nspirit with the temperament and leisure of a man of pleasure, and a\r\nmaster of profound and intricate subjects, the secret of which was only\r\nknown to those who were acquainted with his habit of early rising and his\r\nindefatigable capacity for work in the time that he allotted to work.\r\nWhen the public attention was {233} directed to India, towards the close\r\nof the American war, and when a very general sense of indignation was\r\naroused by the mismanagement that lessened and that threatened to destroy\r\nBritish influence in the East, Dundas came forward with the confident air\r\nof one who was intimately acquainted with the complicated problem and who\r\nbelieved himself perfectly competent to set all difficulties right.  He\r\nwas the chairman of the select committee of the House of Commons\r\nappointed to inquire into the causes of the war in the Carnatic, and he\r\nimpressed himself upon the House as an authority upon India of no mean\r\norder, both in the report from that committee and in a bill which he\r\nhimself introduced for the purpose of dealing with the Indian question.\r\nHe did not succeed in carrying his measure, but he took care that his\r\nknowledge of his subject increased in proportion to its growing\r\nimportance in the public view, and his ready eloquence and specious show\r\nof information made him a very valuable ally for Pitt and a fairly\r\nformidable opponent to Fox in the heady debates over the measures to\r\nwhich the political honor of the dishonorable coalition was pledged.\r\n\r\nThe India Bill had a more serious enemy than Dundas, a more serious enemy\r\nthan Pitt so far as the immediate effect of enmity upon public opinion is\r\nto be estimated.  There was an attorney in London named James Sayer whose\r\nprivate means enabled him to neglect his profession and devote himself to\r\nthe production of political caricatures and squibs.  Sayer was one of the\r\nmany who believed in the rising star of Pitt, and he proved his belief by\r\nthe publication of a caricature which Fox himself is said to have\r\nadmitted gave the India Bill its severest blow in public estimation.\r\nThis caricature was called \"Carlo Khan's Triumphal Entry into Leadenhall\r\nStreet.\"  It represented Fox in the grotesque attire of a theatrical\r\nOriental potentate, and with a smile of conquest upon his black-haired\r\nface, perched upon an elephant with the staring countenance of Lord\r\nNorth, that was led by Burke, whose spectacled acridity was swollen with\r\nthe blowing of a trumpet from which depended a map of India.  The {234}\r\ncaricature was ingenious, timely, and extraordinarily efficacious in\r\nharming the measure and its champions.  It had an enormous sale; it was\r\nimitated and pirated far and wide.  It carried to all parts of the\r\nkingdom the conviction that Fox was aiming at nothing less than a\r\ndictatorship of India, and it intensified the general animosity towards\r\nthe measures and the men of the Coalition Ministry more effectively than\r\nany amount of speeches in Westminster could have done.  But it had no\r\nmore power to weaken the solid majority of the Ministry in the House of\r\nCommons than the hurried erudition of Dundas, or than what Walpole called\r\nthe \"Bristol stone\" of Pitt's eloquence as contrasted with the \"diamond\r\nreason\" of Fox's solid sense.  Neither political caricature nor popular\r\ndisapproval, neither the indignation of the King nor the opulence of the\r\nfearful and furious East India Company, could prevent Fox from carrying\r\nhis measures in the House of Commons by means of the sheer force of\r\nnumbers that he had obtained by his unhallowed compact with North.\r\n\r\nBut the power of the new Ministry was vulnerable in another place where\r\nthe most unconstitutional weapons were employed against it.  The King was\r\neager to avenge the affront that had, as he conceived, been put upon him\r\nby the compulsion that had forced him to accept ministers so little to\r\nhis taste.  He was prepared to stick at little in order to retaliate upon\r\nhis enemies, as he always conceived those men to be who ventured to cross\r\nhis purposes.  Nothing could be done effectively to change the political\r\ncomposition of the Lower House; something could be essayed with the\r\nreasonable hope of modifying the composition of the Upper House.  Lord\r\nTemple, a second-rate statesman, whose position gave him almost\r\nfirst-rate importance, was the instrument by which the King was able to\r\nbring very effective pressure upon the peers.  George wrote a letter to\r\nLord Temple in which he declared that he should deem those who should\r\nvote for Fox's measure as \"not only not his friends, but his enemies;\"\r\nand he added that if Lord Temple could put this in stronger words \"he had\r\nfull authority to do so.\"  With this amazing document in his {235}\r\npossession Lord Temple went from one noble lord to another, pointing out\r\nthe unwisdom of each in pursuing a course which would constitute him an\r\navowed enemy of the King, and insisting upon the advantages that must\r\nfollow from the taking of the very broad hint of the royal pleasure thus\r\nconveyed.  Temple's arguments, backed by and founded upon the King's\r\nletter, had the most satisfactory result from the King's point of view.\r\nPeer after peer fell away from the doomed Ministry; peer after peer\r\nhastened to prove himself one of the elect, to assert himself as a King's\r\nfriend by recording his vote against the obnoxious measure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1783--Fall of the Coalition Ministry]\r\n\r\nThe course of action inspired by the King and acted upon by Lord Temple\r\nwas flagrantly unconstitutional even in an age which permitted to the\r\nsovereign so much liberty of personal intervention in affairs.  It was,\r\nhowever, attended with complete success.  The India Bills were rejected\r\nin the House of Lords by a majority of nineteen, and this defeat, which\r\nwould not have been regarded in more recent times as fatal to a Ministry,\r\nhowever fatal for the time being to the measure thus condemned, was\r\ninstantly used by the King as a pretext for ridding himself of the\r\nadvisers whose advice he detested.  The King resolved to dismiss the\r\nministers, and to dismiss them with every circumstance of indignity that\r\nshould render their dismissal the more contemptuous.  On the midnight of\r\nthe day following the final defeat of the measure in the House of Lords a\r\nmessenger delivered to the two Secretaries of State, Fox and North, a\r\nmessage from the King stating that it was his Majesty's will and pleasure\r\nthat they should deliver to him the seals of their respective offices,\r\nand that they should send them by the Under-Secretaries, Mr. Frazer and\r\nMr. Nepean, as a personal interview on the occasion would be disagreeable\r\nto the King.  The seals were immediately sent to Buckingham House and\r\nwere promptly handed over by the King to Lord Temple, who on the\r\nfollowing day sent letters of dismissal to the other members of the\r\nCabinet Council.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons met, under conditions of {236} keen excitement,\r\nFox and North took their seats on the Front Opposition Bench with their\r\nvast majority behind them eager to retaliate upon the King, who had\r\ndefied their voices and insulted their leaders.  A young member, Mr.\r\nRichard Pepper Arden, rose in his place and moved a new writ for the\r\nborough of Appleby, in the room of the Right Honorable William Pitt, who\r\nhad accepted the office of First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer.  We are told that this motion was received with loud and\r\ngeneral laughter by the Opposition, who regarded Pitt's conduct as a\r\npiece of foolhardy presumption.  And indeed at first Pitt's position\r\nseemed difficult in the extreme.  It was hard to form a Government in the\r\nface of a hostile majority in the Commons, and in the Lords Pitt's\r\nperplexity was increased by Lord Temple's sudden and sullen resignation\r\nof the office to which he had been so newly appointed.  Various reasons\r\nhave been given for Temple's mysterious and petulant behavior.  Some have\r\nthought that he resigned because he was in favor of an immediate\r\ndissolution, while Pitt was opposed to such a step.  Others believe that\r\nhe was eager for some high mark of royal favor, possibly a dukedom, which\r\nwas refused by the King and not warmly advocated by Pitt.  In spite of\r\nall obstacles, however, Pitt succeeded in forming a Ministry, the best he\r\ncould manage under the conditions.  To Shelburne he offered nothing, and\r\nthis omission adds a mystery greater than that of Temple's resignation to\r\nPitt's administration.  It must have surprised Shelburne, as it surprised\r\nevery observer then and since.  Pitt has been accused of ingratitude to\r\nthe man who had been his father's friend and to whom he himself had owed\r\nso short a time before the leadership of the House of Commons.  But Pitt\r\nwas not ungrateful.  He was merely astute.  He read Shelburne as perhaps\r\nno other of his contemporaries was able to read him, and he gauged him at\r\nhis true value or want of value.  Shelburne's glittering unreality, his\r\nshowy unreliability, were to have no place in Pitt's scheme of things.\r\nAbandoned by Temple, abandoning Shelburne, Pitt went his own way, doing\r\nthe best he could in the face {237} of tremendous odds and doing it very\r\nwell.  One of his first acts of office was to bring in an India Bill of\r\nhis own, which was decisively defeated in the Commons.  For some months\r\nPitt fought his hard and thankless fight as a minister with a minority\r\nbehind him.  At last, in the end of March, he saw his opportunity for a\r\ndissolution and resolved to take it.  A singular episode threatened to\r\ndelay his purpose.  [Sidenote: 1784--The disappearance of the Great Seal]\r\nThe Great Seal of England was stolen from the house of the Lord\r\nChancellor in Great Ormond Street, and was never recovered.  It may have\r\nbeen purloined by some political partisan who believed, as James the\r\nSecond believed, that by making away with the Great Seal he could\r\neffectively embarrass his opponents.  But this \"curious manoeuvre,\" as\r\nPitt himself called it, was nullified by the promptitude with which\r\nanother Great Seal was made.\r\n\r\nThe result of the dissolution was as gratifying to Pitt as it was\r\ndisastrous to Fox.  More than one hundred and sixty of Fox's friends lost\r\ntheir seats and earned instead the sobriquet of Fox's Martyrs, and Fox\r\nhimself had very great difficulty in getting elected for the new\r\nParliament.  So ended the unfortunate episode of the Coalition Ministry.\r\nMuch as Fox had suffered from the sins of youth, he was destined to\r\nsuffer even more from this error of his manhood.  For the rest of his\r\nlife, save for a few months towards its close, he was destined to remain\r\nout of office, conscious of the great deeds he would have done and denied\r\nthe power to do them, while his antagonist Pitt lived through long years\r\nof office, long years that were as eventful as any years and more\r\neventful than most years in the history of the country.  Fox had run up a\r\ngreat debt for a little power.  He had paltered with his honor, with his\r\nprinciples, with his public utterances; he had staked more than he had a\r\nright to stake on success, and he had lost, utterly and hopelessly.  If\r\nevery error in life has to be paid for sooner or later, the price due\r\nfrom Fox for his apostasy was very promptly demanded and was very heavy.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Pitt began his long period of authority by an\r\nattempt as stubborn as it was ungenerous to keep his great rival out of\r\npublic life.  The election for {238} Fox's constituency of Westminster\r\nwas one of the fiercest conflicts in English history.  Every effort was\r\nmade to drive Fox out, every effort to put him in.  Beautiful women--whom\r\nPitt described as \"women of the people,\" in parody of the name they gave\r\nto Fox of \"the man of the people\"--bribed voters with kisses, while the\r\nfriends of Pitt rallied every man they could muster to the polling\r\nbooths.  Fox was returned, but the unconstitutional conduct of the High\r\nBailiff in granting the request of the defeated candidate, Sir Cecil\r\nWray, for a scrutiny, and in refusing to make a return till the scrutiny\r\nwas effected, might have deprived Westminster for a season of any\r\nParliamentary representation, and would have kept Fox out of Parliament\r\naltogether if he had not been returned for the Kirkwall Borough through\r\nthe friendship of Sir Thomas Dundas.  Pitt unfortunately backed up the\r\naction of the High Bailiff with a vehemence of zeal that suggested\r\nrancor, and that failed of its purpose.  Fox was in the Commons to defend\r\nhimself and his cause, and he did defend himself with an eloquence that\r\neven he never surpassed, and that gave its additional glory to its\r\nultimate success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1784--Pitt as a financier]\r\n\r\nHowever the generosity or the taste of Pitt's conduct towards Fox in this\r\ninstance might be questioned, there could be no question as to the rare\r\nability he soon made proof of as a statesman and as a financier.  During\r\nhis few and troubled months of office before the dissolution, he had\r\nintroduced an India Bill to take the place of that of Fox, which the King\r\nand the Lords had shattered.  This Bill had been defeated by a majority\r\nof eight.  He now introduced what was practically the same measure, and\r\ncarried it triumphantly by a majority of more than two hundred.  It\r\nestablished that Board of Control and that double system of government\r\nwhich existed, with some modifications, until the Act of 1858, following\r\nupon the Indian Mutiny, effected a radical revolution in the\r\nadministration of India.  The enemies of Pitt's measure declared that its\r\nabuse of patronage was as flagrant as and more enduring than that\r\nproposed by Fox, and for a long time public discontent {239} expressed\r\nitself loudly against the extreme favor that was shown to Scotchmen in\r\nthe filling up of appointments.\r\n\r\nThe financial affairs of the country called for a bold hand and found it.\r\nLord North had muddled the finances of England almost as completely and\r\nalmost as hopelessly as contemporary French financiers were muddling the\r\nfinances of France.  Pitt faced something that was not altogether unlike\r\nfinancial chaos with a courage which was well and with a genius which was\r\nbetter.  The picturesque institution of smuggling, capitalized by wealth\r\nand rank in London, and profitably employing some forty thousand\r\nadventurous spirits, withered before the spell of Pitt's dexterous\r\nmanipulations.  A window tax compensated for a lightened tea duty that\r\nmade smuggling merely a ridiculous waste of time, and its most sinister\r\neffect may still be noticed here and there in England in the hideous\r\nimitations of windows painted on to the walls of houses to support a\r\ngrotesque idea of harmony, without incurring the expense of an actual\r\naperture for light and air.  Pitt raised the loans necessary to meet the\r\nyawning deficit and to minimize the floating debt, and he astonished his\r\nworld by introducing the amazing elements of absolute honesty and\r\nadmirable publicity into the transaction.  The principle of patronage\r\nthat had made previous loans a scandalous source of corruption was\r\ngallantly thrown overboard; and the new minister announced to the general\r\namazement that the new loans would be contracted for with those who\r\noffered the lowest terms in public competition.  A glittering variety of\r\nnew taxes, handled with the dexterity of a conjuror, and extracting\r\nsources of revenue from sources untaxed and very justifiably taxable,\r\nrounded off a series of financial proposals that inaugurated brilliantly\r\nhis administration, and that had their abiding effect upon the welfare of\r\nthe country.  The crown of his financial fame was his plan for the\r\nredemption of the National Debt introduced in 1786.  His plan was based\r\non the comparatively familiar idea of a sinking fund.  Up to the time of\r\nPitt's proposal, however, such sinking fund as might exist in a time of\r\npeace was always liable to be taken over and {240} made use of by the\r\nGovernment in a time of war.  Pitt's plan was to form a sinking fund\r\nwhich should be made inalienable by an Act of Parliament until the Act\r\ncreating it should be repealed by another Act of Parliament.  For this\r\npurpose Pitt created a Board of Commissioners consisting of the Speaker,\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Master of the Rolls, the\r\nAccountant-General, and the Governor and Deputy-Governor of the Bank of\r\nEngland.  To this independent and distinguished body of men the sum of\r\none million sterling was to be handed over annually for the gradual\r\nredemption of the existing debt by the purchase of stock.\r\n\r\nThe story of Pitt's early administration was not all a record of success.\r\nFor the last time, and unsuccessfully, he attempted to bring about a\r\nParliamentary reform.  For the first time, and no less unsuccessfully, he\r\ntried to bring about that better understanding between England and\r\nIreland which it was his merit always to desire, and his misfortune never\r\nto accomplish.  In spite of his genius, his eloquence, and his\r\npopularity, his position in the House of Commons was in a sense\r\nprecarious.  It was not merely that he had the bad luck to be opposed by\r\nsuch a galaxy of ability as has perhaps never before or since dazzled\r\nfrom the benches of Opposition the eyes of any minister of Pitt's\r\nintellectual power.  To be fought against relentlessly, tirelessly, by a\r\nSheridan, a Burke, and a Fox would have been bad enough for a statesman\r\nat the head of a large and reliable majority and enjoying the uncheckered\r\nconfidence of his sovereign.  But Pitt did not enjoy the uncheckered\r\nconfidence of the King, and Pitt's majority was not reliable.  Lord\r\nRosebery quotes an analysis of the House of Commons dated May 1, 1788,\r\nrecently discovered among the papers of one of Pitt's private\r\nsecretaries, which serves to show how uncertain Pitt's position was, and\r\nhow fluctuating the elements upon which he had to depend for his\r\npolitical existence.  In this document the \"Party of the Crown\"--an\r\nominous term--is set down as consisting of 185 members, including \"all\r\nthose who would probably support his Majesty's Government under any\r\nminister not {241} peculiarly unpopular.\"  No less than 108 members are\r\nset down as \"independent or unconnected;\" the party ascribed to Fox\r\nmusters 138, while that of Pitt is only estimated at 52, with the\r\nminimizing comment that \"of this party, were there a new Parliament, and\r\nMr. P. no longer to continue minister, not above twenty would be\r\nreturned.\"  In the face of difficulties like these Pitt stood practically\r\nalone.  His was no Ministry \"of All the Talents;\" the ranks of the\r\nMinistry did not represent, even in a lesser degree, the rich variety of\r\nability that made the Opposition so formidable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1788--Prince George Augustus Frederick]\r\n\r\nIf the King was at best but a lukewarm supporter of his splendid\r\nminister, the heir to the throne was the minister's very warm and\r\npersistent enemy.  When Pitt came to power the Prince of Wales was, and\r\nhad been for some time, a conspicuous figure in society, a fitful element\r\nin political life, and a subject of considerable scandal to the public\r\nmind.  George the Third was not the kind of man to be happy with or to\r\nbring happiness to his children.  Possessed of many of those virtues\r\nwhich are supposed to make for domestic peace, he nevertheless failed\r\nsignally to attach to himself the affection of his children.  One and\r\nall, they left him as soon as they could, came back to him as seldom as\r\nthey could.  The King's idea of firmness was always a more or less\r\naggravated form of tyranny, and he reaped in loneliness the harvest of\r\nhis early harshness.  Between his eldest son and himself there soon arose\r\nand long continued that feud between the reigning sovereign and his heir\r\nwhich seemed traditional in the House of Hanover.\r\n\r\nGeorge Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales, has many claims to be\r\nregarded as perhaps the worst, and as certainly the most worthless,\r\nprince of his House.  Something was to be excused in the son of such a\r\nfather; some wild oats were surely to be sown in the soil of a childhood\r\nso dully and so sourly cultivated.  But no severity of early surroundings\r\nwill explain or palliate the unlovely mixture of folly and of falseness,\r\nof debauchery, vulgarity, profligacy, and baseness, which were the most\r\nconspicuous {242} characteristics of the Prince's nature.  The malignant\r\nenemy of his unhappy father, the treacherous lover, the perjured friend,\r\na heartless fop, a soulless sot, the most ungentlemanly First Gentleman\r\nof Europe, his memory baffles the efforts of the sycophant and paralyzes\r\nthe anger of the satirist.  Genius has wasted itself again and again in\r\nthe attempt fittingly to describe him.  To Byron he became \"the fourth of\r\nthe fools and oppressors called George.\"  Moore immortalized his\r\n\"nothingness\" as a \"sick epicure's dream, incoherent and gross.\"  Leigh\r\nHunt went to prison for calling him a \"fat Adonis of fifty.\"  Landor, in\r\nan epigram on himself and his royal namesakes as bitter as four biting\r\nlines could be, could find nothing more bitter than to record his descent\r\nfrom earth, and thankfulness to Heaven that with him the Georges had come\r\nto an end.  Thackeray abandoned in despair the task of doing justice to\r\nhis existence.  \"I own I once used to think it would be good sport to\r\npursue him, fasten on him, and pull him down.  But now I am ashamed to\r\nmount and lay good dogs on, to summon a full field, and then to hunt the\r\npoor game.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt became Prime Minister the Prince of Wales was in Opposition,\r\nbecause he was opposed to his father.  He imagined himself to be the\r\nfriend of Fox, of Sheridan, of Burke, because Fox and Sheridan and Burke\r\nwere unpopular with the King.  His career had been one of debt and\r\ndrunkenness, of mean amours and degrading pleasures, when the son of\r\nChatham passed from his studious youth to the control of the destinies of\r\nEngland.  Pitt was called upon and refused to consent to a Parliamentary\r\nappeal to the King for the payment of the Prince's debts.  Pitt could\r\nfeel no courtier's sympathy for the unnatural son, for the faithless\r\nFlorizel of foolish Perdita Robinson, for the perjured husband of Mrs.\r\nFitzherbert.  There can be no doubt that in the December of 1785 the\r\nPrince of Wales went through a ceremony of marriage, which could not\r\nunder the conditions constitute a legal marriage, with Mrs. Fitzherbert,\r\na beautiful young woman of a little more than twenty-nine years of age,\r\nwho had twice been widowed {243} and was a member of the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith.  The town soon rang with gossip, and what was gossip in the\r\ndrawing-rooms threatened to become a matter for \"delicate investigation\"\r\nin the House of Commons.  The denial given by Fox in Parliament on the\r\nauthority of the Prince of Wales practically ended any attempt at public\r\ninquiry, and almost broke the heart of Mrs. Fitzherbert.  To her the\r\nPrince of course promptly disavowed Fox, with whom she immediately broke\r\noff all friendship.  Fox himself, indignant at the Prince's falsehood and\r\nat the base use which had been made of his voice, shunned the Prince's\r\nsociety for a long time, which might very well have been longer.  The\r\nscandal slowly ebbed; a compromise was arrived at between the King and\r\nhis son; the King made an appeal to Parliament; and a sum of money was\r\nvoted to deal with the Prince's debts in consideration of his promises of\r\nreform in the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1788--Talk of a Regency]\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales did not forget Pitt's attitude towards him, and the\r\ntime soon arrived in which the minister came near to feeling the force of\r\nthe Prince's anger.  The health of the King was suddenly and seriously\r\naffected.  Soon after his reign began he had been afflicted by a\r\ntemporary loss of reason.  The same misfortune now fell upon him in the\r\nautumn of 1788.  It became necessary to make arrangements for the\r\nappointment of a regent, and the necessity was the cause of a fierce\r\nParliamentary controversy.  Fox rashly insisted that the Prince of Wales\r\nhad as much right to assume the reins of government as he would have had\r\nin the case of the death of the monarch.  Pitt maintained the more\r\nconstitutional opinion that it was the privilege of Parliament to appoint\r\na regent and to decide what powers should be intrusted to him.  However\r\nlittle the knowledge may have influenced his action, Pitt knew very well\r\nthat with the appointment of the Prince of Wales as regent his own hold\r\nof power would, for a time, come to an end.  The whole question, however,\r\nwas suddenly set on one side by the unexpected recovery of the King.  The\r\nKing's restoration to reason was well for the minister, and undoubtedly\r\nwell for the {244} kingdom.  If Burke and Sheridan and Fox were avowedly\r\nthe Prince's friends in Parliament, his most intimate friends, those who\r\nwould be likely to prove influential in his mimic Court, were men of a\r\nvery different kind.  These were such men as George Hanger, the half-mad\r\nsoldier, the \"Paragon of Debauchery,\" as the caricaturists labelled the\r\nPrince's \"confidential friend,\" who having been almost everything from\r\ncaptain of Hessians to coal merchant, and from recruiter for the East\r\nIndia Company to inmate of a debtor's prison, ended his long and unlovely\r\ncareer by declining to assume the title of Lord Coleraine, to which he\r\nbecame entitled in 1814, ten years before his death.  These were such men\r\nas Charles Morris, the amiable Anacreon of Carlton House, who made better\r\npunch and rhymed better ballads than his fellows of that convivial age,\r\nand who had the grace to expiate the ignoble noonday of his existence by\r\nan honorable evening.  These were such men as the queer gang of\r\nblackguards, ruffians, and rowdies who haunted Brighthelmstone, the bad\r\nand brutal Richard Barry, the \"Hellgate\" Lord Barrymore; the Jockey of\r\nNorfolk, with his hair grown gray in iniquities; Sir John Lade, whose\r\nwife had been the mistress of a highwayman; and the worst and basest\r\nspirit of the gang, the Duke of Queensberry.  Such were the men whom the\r\nPrince delighted to make his companions; such were the men who, if the\r\nKing's madness had persisted, would have hailed with satisfaction the\r\noverthrow of Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\nIt were needless to dwell further for the present upon the adventures of\r\nthe Prince of Wales, his amours, his debts, his friendships, his\r\nfantastic pavilion at Brighton, or his unhappy marriage in April, 1795,\r\nto his cousin, the Princess Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of Brunswick.\r\nTwenty years were to pass away before the recurrence of the King's malady\r\nwas to give his eldest son the show of power, and in those twenty years\r\nthe two political rivals--one of whom was the greatest of his allies, and\r\nthe other the greatest of his adversaries--had passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{245}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nWARREN HASTINGS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1732--The birth of Warren Hastings]\r\n\r\nIn the days when Clive was first winning his way to fame in India there\r\nwas another young Englishman serving John Company, whose ability\r\nattracted the notice and gained the esteem of the conqueror of Dupleix.\r\nIt is one of the privileges of genius to discern the genius of others.\r\nBut even Clive, when he noted a young volunteer at Falta, who seemed\r\ndestined for better things than the handling of a musket, cannot have\r\ndreamed that he was giving an opportunity to a man whose name was to\r\ntake as high a rank in the history of India as his own, whose deeds\r\nwere to be no less fiercely battled over, whose part in the creation of\r\na great Indian Empire was to be as illustrious.  All that India had\r\nbeen to Clive--a refuge, a battleground, a theatre of great deeds, and\r\nunfortunately also of great offences, the cause of almost unbearable\r\ntriumph and almost intolerable humiliation, all that in as great a\r\ndegree India was to be to Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nWarren Hastings was born in the December of 1732, in Churchill,\r\nOxfordshire, near Daylesford in Worcestershire.  His family had been a\r\ngood as it was an old family.  But it had come down in the world.  It\r\nhad grown poorer and poorer as the generations rolled on, and that\r\nmanor of Daylesford which had been in the family in the days of the\r\nsecond Henry had passed in the year of Sheriffmuir into the hands of a\r\nGloucester merchant.  When Warren Hastings was born, the fortunes of\r\nthe house had come to a very low ebb indeed.  Pynaston Hastings, Warren\r\nHastings's father, was, perhaps, as imbecile a man as ever yet was the\r\nmeans of bringing an illustrious son into the world.  He seems to have\r\nbeen weak, foolish, shiftless, as {246} worthless as a man well could\r\nbe who was not actually a criminal.  He had married very young, before\r\nhe was sixteen; his wife had died shortly after giving birth to Warren\r\nHastings.  Pynaston married again, entered the Church, when he was old\r\nenough to take holy orders, and drifted away into the West Indies into\r\nouter darkness and oblivion, leaving children entirely dependent upon\r\nthe charity of relatives.  That charity did not fail, though at first\r\nit could be but meagrely extended.  Warren Hastings's grandfather was\r\ndesperately poor.  All he could do for his deserted grandchild was to\r\nplace him at the charity school of the village.  There, habited almost\r\nlike a beggar, taught as a beggar, the companion of clowns and\r\nplayfellow of rustics, the future peer of kings and ruler of rajahs,\r\nthe coming pro-consul who was yet to make the state of England as\r\nimperial as the state of Rome, received his earliest lessons in the\r\nfacts of life, and dreamed his earliest dreams.  His were strange\r\ndreams.  In sleep, says a Persian poet with whom young Hastings was\r\nafterwards doubtless acquainted, the beggar and the king are equal.  If\r\nWarren Hastings slept as a beggar, he certainly dreamed as a king.  We\r\nknow, on his own statement, that when he was but a child of seven he\r\ncherished that wild ambition which was to lead him through so many\r\nglories and so many crimes.  We are familiar with the picture of the\r\nboy leaning over the stream on that summer day, and looking at the old\r\ndwelling of his race, and swearing to himself his oath of Hannibal that\r\nsome day he would, if the stars were propitious, win back his\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1750--Warren Hastings's early life]\r\n\r\nSomewhere about a year after this oath of Hannibal the fortunes of the\r\nlad took a turn for the better.  An uncle, Howard Hastings, who had a\r\nplace in the Customs, was willing to give a helping hand to the son of\r\nhis graceless brother.  He brought Warren Hastings to London.  In\r\nLondon Warren Hastings was first sent to school at Newington, where his\r\nmind was better nourished than his body.  In after life he used to\r\ndeclare that his meagre proportions and stunted form were due to the\r\nhard living of his Newington days.  But the Newington days came to\r\n{247} an end.  When he was some twelve years of age, his uncle sent him\r\nto Westminster School, where his name is still inscribed in letters of\r\ngold, and where his memory adds its lustre to the historic associations\r\nof a place that is richly blessed with historic associations.  Warren\r\nHastings distinguished himself in the great school of Westminster, as\r\nhe had already distinguished himself in the little village school of\r\nDaylesford.  With his oath of Hannibal burning in his mind, he seems to\r\nhave determined to seek success in all that he attempted, and to gain\r\nit by his indomitable energy and will.  If he was brilliant as a\r\nscholar, he was not, therefore, backward in those other arts which\r\nschool-boys prize beyond scholarship.  He was as famous on the river\r\nfor his swimming and his boating as he was famous in the classroom for\r\nhis application and his ability.  His masters predicted for him a\r\nbrilliant University career, and it is possible that Hastings may have\r\nseen Daylesford Manor awaiting him at the end of such a career, and\r\nhave welcomed the prospect.  But the life of Warren Hastings was not\r\nfated to pass in the cloistered greenness of a university or in the\r\nstill air of delightful studies.  Howard Hastings died and left his\r\nnephew to the care of a connection, a Mr. Chiswick, who happened to be\r\na member of the East India Company.  Perhaps Mr. Chiswick resented the\r\nobligation thus laid upon him; perhaps, as a member of the East India\r\nCompany, he honestly believed that to enter its service was the\r\nproudest privilege that a young man could enjoy.  Whatever were his\r\nreasons, he resolutely refused to sanction his charge's career at the\r\nuniversity, insisted upon his being placed for a season at a commercial\r\nschool to learn arithmetic and book-keeping, and then shipped him off\r\nout of hand to Bengal as an addition to the ranks of the Calcutta\r\nclerks.  Thus it came to pass that Warren Hastings, like Clive, was\r\nsent to India by persons in England who were anxious to get rid of a\r\ntroublesome charge.  There were a good many persons in the years to\r\ncome who were very ready to curse the obstinacy of the elder Clive and\r\nthe asperity of Mr. Chiswick for sending two such terrible adventurers\r\nforth to {248} the great battle-field of India.  The history of our\r\nIndian Empire would certainly have been a very different story if only\r\nMr. Clive had been more attached to his ne'er-do-well son, and if only\r\nMr. Chiswick had been better affected towards his industrious charge.\r\nIn the January of 1750 Warren Hastings said farewell to his dreams of a\r\nscholar's garland in England and sailed for India.  In the October of\r\nthe same year he landed in Bengal and altered the history of the world.\r\n\r\nGentlemen adventurers who went out to India in the last century in the\r\nservice of John Company seldom knew much, or indeed cared much, about\r\nthe condition of the country which they were invading.  They dreamed\r\nmostly of large fortunes, fortunes to be swiftly made and then brought\r\nhome and expended splendidly to the amazement of less fortunate\r\nstay-at-homes.  For the past history of India they did not care a penny\r\npiece.  What to them were the mythical deeds of Rama and of Krishna;\r\nwhat to them the marches of Semiramis and Sesostris, or the conquests\r\nof Alexander, or the fate and fortunes of the ancient kingdoms of the\r\nDeccan and Hindostan?  They cared nothing for the spread of Mahommedan\r\ninfluence and authority, the glories of the Mogul Empire, the fate of\r\nTamerlane, the fame of Aurungzebe.  For them the history of India began\r\nwith the merchant adventurers of 1659 and the East India Company of\r\n1600, with the grant of Bombay to England as part of the dower which\r\nthe Princess of Portugal brought to Charles the Second.  Nor were they\r\nmoved by imperial ambitions.  It did not enter into their heads to\r\nconceive or to desire the addition of a vast Indian empire to the\r\nappanages of the English crown.  They cared little for the conflicting\r\ncreeds of India, for Brahmanism and Buddhism and Jainism and Hinduism\r\nand the sects of Islam.  They knew little of the differing tongues\r\ntalked over that vast continent, more than five hundred in number, from\r\nthe Hindi of one hundred million men to the most restricted dialects of\r\nthe mountains of Assam and Nepaul.  India for them meant the little\r\nspace of earth where the English had a trading interest, {249} and the\r\nregions of the shadowy potentates beyond from whom in some way or other\r\nmoney might be got.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1750--Suraj ud Dowlah]\r\n\r\nWhen Warren Hastings landed in India the relations of England and of\r\nEnglishmen to India were just upon the turn.  The star of Clive's\r\nfortunes was mounting towards its zenith; the fiery planet of Dupleix\r\nhad begun to fail and pale and fade.  The policy which Dupleix had\r\nadopted, that policy of intrigue with the native princes of India, the\r\nEnglish East India Company had been forced in self-defence and very\r\nreluctantly to adopt.  Having adopted it, the men of the English East\r\nIndia Company proved themselves to be better players at the game than\r\nDupleix.  Warren Hastings, driving his pen at a desk in Calcutta, or\r\nlooking after silk-spinning in the factory of Kazim Bazar near\r\nMurshidabad on the Ganges, was able to watch almost from its beginning\r\nthe great political drama in which he was destined in his time to play\r\nso great a part, and which was to end in giving England a great Asiatic\r\nempire.  When Suraj ud Dowlah declared war against the English his\r\nfirst move was to fall upon the Kazim Bazar settlement.  Warren\r\nHastings and the other English residents were made prisoners and sent\r\nto Murshidabad, where, through the intervention of the Dutch Company,\r\nthey were humanely treated.  Then came the madman's march on Calcutta,\r\nthe horror of the Black Hole, and the flight of the Governor and the\r\nCompany's servants to the little fort at Falta in the Hughli below\r\nCalcutta.  Communications were entered upon between Governor Drake in\r\nFalta Island and Hastings at Murshidabad with a view to coming to terms\r\nwith Suraj ud Dowlah.  Warren Hastings was already, however, developing\r\nthat genius for Oriental diplomacy which afterwards so characterized\r\nhis career.  He was made aware of the treason that was hatching against\r\nSuraj ud Dowlah in his own court and among his own friends, and he was\r\nquite ready to play his part and find his account in that treason.\r\nTreason is a risky game for a political prisoner at a court like that\r\nof Suraj ud Dowlah.  Warren Hastings was quick-witted enough to see\r\nthat the sooner he got away from that {250} court the better for\r\nhimself.  He succeeded accordingly in making his escape and joining the\r\nfugitives at Falta.  Here two things of moment happened to him.  He met\r\nthe woman who was to be his first wife, and he met the great man who\r\nwas to give him his first chance for fame.  Among the refugees from\r\nCalcutta was the widow of a Captain Campbell.  Warren Hastings fell in\r\nlove with her, and afterwards in an hour of greater security he married\r\nher.  He seem to have been very fond of her, to have been very happy\r\nwith her, but she died very soon after the marriage, and the two\r\nchildren she bore him both died young, and so that episode came to an\r\nend.  The more momentous meeting was with Clive.  When the Madras\r\nexpedition appeared in the Hughli, Warren Hastings volunteered to serve\r\nin the ranks, shouldered his gun, and took his part in the fighting\r\nround Calcutta.  But Clive's keen eyes discerned stuff for better\r\nthings than the sieging of Indian forts in the young volunteer.  When\r\nSuraj ud Dowlah's defeat ended in Suraj ud Dowlah's death, and the\r\ntraitorous Mir Jaffier sat on the throne in his stead, Warren Hastings\r\nwas sent to the court of the new prince at Murshidabad, originally as\r\nsecond to the Company's representative, Mr. Scratton, and afterwards as\r\nsole representative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1762--Clive and the East India Company]\r\n\r\nAt Murshidabad Warren Hastings had every opportunity to justify Clive's\r\nacumen in singling him out for distinction.  The post he held was one\r\nof exceptional difficulty and delicacy.  Mir Jaffier was not altogether\r\nan agreeable person to get on with.  The English in India were taking\r\ntheir first lessons in Oriental intrigue.  They were learning that if\r\nit was not particularly difficult to upset one tyrant and place another\r\non his throne, it was not always easy to keep that other on the throne,\r\nor at all safe to rely upon his loyalty to the men who had brought\r\nabout his exaltation.  Mir Jaffier was surrounded by enemies.  His\r\ncourt, like every other Oriental court, was honeycombed with intrigues\r\nagainst him.  His English patrons, or rather his English masters,\r\nproved to have an itching palm.  They were always wanting money, and\r\nMir Jaffier {251} had not always got enough money in his treasury to\r\ncontent their desires.  So he began to intrigue against the English\r\nwith the Dutch, and the English found him out and promptly knocked him\r\noff his throne, and set up a new puppet in his stead.  By this time\r\nClive had returned to England, and the direction of the destinies of\r\nthe East India Company was in the hands of the Governor, Mr.\r\nVansittart, a well-meaning man whose views were not the views of Clive.\r\nClive objected very much to the course which the East India Company\r\nwere pursuing.  He wrote a letter to the London Board rebuking in no\r\nmeasured language the defects and evils of the Indian Administration.\r\nOnce again Clive was the cause of Warren Hastings's advancement.  The\r\nLondon Board ordered the instant dismissal of all the officials who had\r\nsigned Clive's letter and Warren Hastings was appointed to fill one of\r\nthe vacant places.\r\n\r\nThe five years that elapsed between the departure of Clive for England\r\nin 1760 and his return to India in 1765 are not years that reflect much\r\ncredit upon the East India Company's administration.  They had suddenly\r\nfound themselves lifted from a condition of dependency and, at one\r\nmoment, of despair to a position of unhoped-for authority and\r\ninfluence.  New to such power, dazzled by such influence, they abused\r\nthe one and they misused the other.  But the part that Warren Hastings\r\nplayed during this unfortunate five years reflects only credit upon\r\nhimself.  The vices of the East India Company were not his vices; he\r\nwas no party to their abuse of their power, or their misuse of their\r\ninfluence.  When he was advanced from the Patna agency, his place was\r\ntaken by a Mr. Ellis, who seems to have been exceptionally and\r\npeculiarly unfitted for the delicate duties of his post.  He appears to\r\nhave carried on all his negotiations and communications with the Nawab\r\nMir Kasim with a high-handed arrogance and an absence of tact which\r\nwere in their way astonishing.  Relations between the Nawab and Mr.\r\nEllis, as the Company's representative, became so strained that in 1762\r\nWarren Hastings was again sent to Patna to investigate the whole\r\ntrouble.  {252} Clive's judgment was already justified: Warren\r\nHastings's ability had already found much of the recognition it\r\ndeserved; his twelve years of Indian life had changed him from the\r\nadventurous, inexperienced lad into the ripe and skilful statesman upon\r\nwhom his masters were confident that they could rely in such a moment\r\nof emergency as had now come.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better for the Company if they had taken the advice\r\nthat Warren Hastings gave in the report on the quarrel between the\r\nNawab on the one side and Mr. Ellis on the other.  He was a servant of\r\nJohn Company, but he was too good a servant not to see the faults of\r\nhis masters and the follies to which those faults were leading.  The\r\nCompany had blundered very badly before the coming of Clive; had\r\nblundered through false security, through negligence, through\r\npusillanimity, through greed.  After the victories of Clive had placed\r\nthe Board in Leadenhall Street, and its representatives in India, on a\r\nvery different footing, the Company blundered through rapacity, through\r\nselfishness, through the arrogance born of an unforeseen success.  All\r\nmanner of oppressions and injustices were committed under the powerful\r\nprotection of the English name.  Hastings declared that the only way of\r\nending the difficulty was to come to some definite settlement with the\r\nNawab as to his authority on the one hand and the Company's privileges\r\non the other.  Together with Mr. Vansittart, the Governor, Hastings\r\nvisited the Nawab, and a plan of conciliation was made by which the\r\nrights of the Nawab and the rights of the Company were duly apportioned\r\nand declared.  But the headstrong Council of the Company refused the\r\npropositions of Warren Hastings and of Vansittart, and refused to make\r\nany concessions to the Nawab.  The irritated Nawab retaliated by\r\nabolishing all internal duties upon trade, by which act he deprived the\r\nEnglish of the unjust advantages for which they had contended.  It was\r\nnow a question which should attack the other first, and Mr. Ellis,\r\nhearing a rumor of intended hostilities on the part of Mir Kasim,\r\nattacked the Nawab, drove him out of his dominions and {253} set up Mir\r\nJaffier again for a time.  Hastings protested against these acts, and\r\ndeclared that he would have resigned but that he was unwilling to leave\r\nthe Company while engaged in a harassing war.  But his position was\r\nuncomfortable.  His counsels and those of Mr. Vansittart were unheeded.\r\nEnglish aggression continued.  Mr. Vansittart left for England in 1764,\r\nand in the December of that year Hastings followed him, glad to leave a\r\nscene of so much disorder, a disorder that was to increase alarmingly,\r\nuntil in the September of 1765 Clive reappeared in India and set things\r\nstraight again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1765-69--Hastings's return to England]\r\n\r\nOf no period of Warren Hastings's life is less known than of the four\r\nyears which he spent in his native land--from 1765 to 1769.  He did not\r\nreturn to England like the traditional Nabob, with pockets overflowing\r\nwith rupees.  He had not employed his time and his energies, as so many\r\nother servants of John Company had done, solely to the furthering of\r\nhis own fortunes, and the filling of his own pockets.  If he had sailed\r\nfor India fourteen years earlier as a penniless lad, he returned to\r\nEngland comparatively a poor man.  He had tried his hand at commerce\r\nlike every one else in India, but commerce was not much in his line.\r\nHe had the capacities of a statesman, he had the tastes of a man of\r\nletters, but he did not in any great degree possess the qualities that\r\ngo to make a successful merchant.  It is even said that he had to\r\nborrow the money to pay his passage home, and it seems certain that\r\nwhen he was home, the generous way in which he endeavored to assist his\r\nrelations sorely taxed his meagre means.\r\n\r\nHastings seems to have sought for distinction in the career of a man of\r\nletters and not to have found it.  The ability which he displayed in\r\nadministration and the writing of State papers and political\r\ncorrespondence vanished whenever he attempted to produce work that made\r\na more ambitious claim to be considered literature.  The clearness of\r\nstatement, the width of view, the logical form, the firm grasp and\r\nprofound knowledge which were characteristic of the evidence he gave\r\nbefore the House of {254} Commons Committee in 1766, gave place to a\r\nthin and niggling pedantry of style when he turned his pen to the\r\nessays and the verses of a man of letters.  Yet there were some topics\r\non which he was eminently qualified to write, and by which, under\r\nhappier conditions, he might have earned distinction.  While he was in\r\nIndia he had not allowed his active mind to be entirely occupied with\r\nthe duties of his official career.  That love of literature, that\r\nmarvellous capacity for acquiring knowledge, which had characterized\r\nhim in his Westminster school-days, remained with him at the desk of\r\nthe East India Company and in the courts of Indian princes.  He gave\r\ngreat attention to the languages and the literatures of the East.  Most\r\nof those English who served their term in India contented themselves,\r\nwhen they troubled themselves at all about the matter, with learning as\r\nmuch of the native vernaculars with which they were brought into\r\ncontact as was necessary for the carrying on of a conversation and the\r\ngiving of an order.  With such a measure of knowledge Warren Hastings\r\nwas not content.  He studied Persian, the courtly language of India,\r\nclosely; he read much in its enchanting literature.  When he came back\r\nto England in 1765 he was possessed of a knowledge of the most\r\nbeautiful of the Eastern languages, as rare as it was useless then for\r\nan English man of letters to possess.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1769--Warren Hastings as an Oriental scholar]\r\n\r\nAlmost a century later the great American transcendentalist, Emerson,\r\nprophesied a rise of Orientalism in England, and he lived to see his\r\nwords come true.  But in the days when Warren Hastings was striving to\r\nmake his way in London as an author, the influence of the East upon\r\nliterature, upon scholarship, upon thought, was scarcely perceptible.\r\nPeople read indeed the \"Arabian Nights\" in M. Galland's delightful\r\nversion; read the Persian tales of Petit de la Croix; read all the\r\ntranslations of the many sham Oriental tales which the popularity of\r\nGalland and Petit de la Croix had called for in Paris, and which the\r\nParisian writers were ready to supply.  But serious Oriental\r\nscholarship can hardly be said to have existed in England.  Sir William\r\nJones was the only Englishman of {255} distinction who was earnestly\r\ndevoted to Eastern studies; but his Persian Grammar, which was in some\r\ndegree the foundation-stone of Persian scholarship in England, had not\r\nyet appeared, and Sir William Jones was still writing to Reviczki those\r\ndelightful letters in which he raves about the poetry of the Arabs and\r\nthe Persians.  Thus the scholarship of Warren Hastings placed him in an\r\nexceedingly small minority among Englishmen of letters.  Hastings was\r\nnot the man to be alarmed or discouraged by finding himself in a\r\nminority.  He was as impassioned an admirer of Persian poetry as Sir\r\nWilliam Jones; he considered that the Persian language should be\r\nincluded in the studies of all well-educated men; he dreamed of\r\nanimating the waning fires of Oriental learning at Oxford.  He had a\r\nvision in his mind of a new scholarship, to be called into being by the\r\ngenerosity of the East India Company.  He thought of Englishmen\r\nbecoming as familiar with the deeds of Rustum as with the wrath of\r\nAchilles, as intimate with the Ghazels of Hafiz as with the Odes of\r\nHorace.  He seems to have visited Dr. Johnson in the hope of securing\r\nhim as an ally in his scheme.  The scheme came to nothing, but the\r\nlearning, the literary taste, and scholarly ambition of Hastings made a\r\nstrong impression upon Johnson, who entertained a stately regard for\r\nthe young man from India.\r\n\r\nIt soon became plain to Warren Hastings that he was not going to make\r\nmuch of a livelihood either by Persian poetry or by the calling of a\r\nman of letters.  His thoughts had turned back to India within a year of\r\nhis return to England, and he had applied for employment to the\r\nCompany, but for some reason his request was not granted.  In 1768,\r\nhowever, the Court of Directors appointed him to a seat in Council at\r\nMadras, and early in the following year, 1769, he sailed again for\r\nIndia on his most momentous voyage.  Not only was that ship, the \"Duke\r\nof Grafton,\" bearing him to a career of the greatest glory and the\r\ngreatest obloquy; not only was it carrying him to a grandeur and a fall\r\nalmost unparalleled in the history of men who were not monarchs.  On\r\nboard the \"Duke of {256} Grafton\" Warren Hastings was to meet with one\r\nof the most serious influences of his life.  We have already seen how\r\nHastings had married, had been a father, and how wife and children had\r\npassed out of his life and left him alone.  Hastings was a man of\r\nstrong emotions.  Now he met a woman who awoke all the strongest\r\nemotions of his nature and won his devotion for the rest of his life.\r\nThe Baroness von Imhoff was a young, beautiful, attractive woman,\r\nmarried to a knavish adventurer.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that she and Hastings felt a warm attachment for each\r\nother; it seems certain that Imhoff connived at, or at least winked at,\r\nthe attachment.  It may be that the understanding between Hastings and\r\nImhoff was in this sense honorable--that the Baron was willing to free\r\nhis wife from an unhappy union that she might form a happy union.  It\r\nmay be that Hastings's passion was indeed, in Macaulay's fine phrase,\r\n\"patient of delay.\"  The simple facts that call for no controversy are\r\nthat Hastings met the Baroness von Imhoff in 1769; that eight years\r\nlater, in 1777, Imhoff, with the aid of Hastings's money, obtained his\r\ndivorce in the Franconian Courts, and that the woman who had been his\r\nwife became the wife of Hastings.  She made him a devoted wife; he made\r\nher a devoted husband.  Hastings was never a profligate.  In an age\r\nthat was not remarkable for morality his life was apparently moral even\r\nto austerity.  His relationships with the Imhoffs constitute the only\r\ncharge of immorality that has been brought against him, and the charge,\r\nat least, is not of the gravest kind.  If Anglo-Indian society was at\r\nfirst inclined to be uncharitable, if the great ladies of its little\r\nworld held aloof in the beginning from the Baroness von Imhoff, her\r\nmarriage with Hastings seems to have restored her to general favor and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1771--Hastings's great administrative qualities]\r\n\r\nWarren Hastings found plenty of work cut out for him on his return to\r\nIndia.  He had his own ideas, and strong ideas, about the necessity for\r\nreforms.  He was much opposed to the policy of sending out as\r\nsecretaries to the local governments men who were without local\r\nexperience and therefore less likely to take a warm interest {257} in\r\nthe Company's welfare, while such appointments were in themselves\r\nunjust to the claims of the Company's own servants.  He vehemently\r\nurged the necessity for making the rewards of the service more adequate\r\nto the duties of the service, and he announced himself as determined to\r\ndo all he could for \"the improvement of the Company's finances, so far\r\nas it can be effected without encroaching upon their future income.\"\r\nIf Hastings could scheme out needed reforms on his way out, he found on\r\nhis arrival that the need for reform was little short of appalling.\r\nThe position which Hastings held was a curious one.  He was President\r\nof the Council, it is true, but president of a council of which every\r\nmember had an equal vote, and many of the members of which had personal\r\nreasons for wishing to oppose the reforms that Hastings was coming out\r\nto accomplish.  A disorganized government had to be reorganized, an\r\nexhausted exchequer to be refilled, a heart-breaking debt to be\r\nreduced, and all this had to be done under conditions that well might\r\nhave shaken a less dauntless spirit than that of Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nWarren Hastings was never for one moment shaken.  In a very short space\r\nof time he had greatly bettered the administrative system, had fostered\r\nthe trade of the country by the adoption of a uniform and low Customs\r\nduty, and had greatly furthered the establishment of civilized rule in\r\nthe province conquered by Clive.  He accomplished this in the face of\r\ndifficulties and all dissensions in his own Council, against subtle\r\nnative intrigues, against opposition open and covert of the most\r\npersistent kind.  Every creature who throve out of the disorganization\r\nof India naturally worked, in the daylight or in the dark, against\r\nHastings's efforts at organization.  In 1771, when he was made Governor\r\nof Bengal, he had attempted much and succeeded in much.  He fought hard\r\nwith the secret terror of dacoity.  Having given Bengal a judicial\r\nsystem, he proceeded to increase its usefulness by drawing up a code of\r\nMohammedan and Hindu law.  For the former he used the digest made by\r\ncommand of Aurungzebe; for the {258} second he employed ten learned\r\nPundits, the result of whose labors was afterwards translated into\r\nEnglish by Halhed, who had been the friend of Sheridan and his rival\r\nfor the hand of Miss Linley.\r\n\r\nThe work which Warren Hastings accomplished in India must be called\r\ngigantic.  He created organization out of chaos; he marched\r\nstraightforward upon the course which Clive had already marked out as\r\nthe path of the East India Company's glory.  The East India Company was\r\nnot very eager to advance along that path.  Hastings spurred its\r\nsluggish spirit, and, though he was not able to do all that his daring\r\nnature dreamed of, he left behind him a long record of great\r\nachievements.  The annexation of Benares, the practical subjection of\r\nOude, the extension of British dominion, the triumphs of British arms,\r\nmust be remembered to the credit of Warren Hastings when his career as\r\na great English adventurer is being summed up.  That British Empire in\r\nIndia for which Clive unconsciously labored owes its existence to-day\r\nin no small degree to the genius, to the patience, and to the untiring\r\nenergy of Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1773--Hastings and the Rohilla War]\r\n\r\nThe two heaviest charges levelled against Warren Hastings are in\r\nconnection with the Rohilla war and with the trial of Nuncomar, now\r\nbetter known as Nand Kumar.  The genius of Burke and the genius of\r\nMacaulay have served not merely to intensify the feeling against\r\nHastings, but in some degree to form the judgments and bias the\r\nopinions of later writers.  But it is only due to the memory of a great\r\nman to remember that both in the case of the Rohilla war and in the\r\ncase of Nand Kumar there were two sides to the question, and that\r\nHastings's side has not always been investigated with the care it\r\ndeserves.  The adversary who denounced him in the House of Commons and\r\nimpeached him in Westminster Hall, the adversary who assailed him with\r\na splendid prose, were alike inspired by a longing for justice and a\r\nhatred of oppression.  But it should be possible now, when more than a\r\ncentury has passed since the indictment of the one and well-nigh half a\r\ncentury since the indictment of the other, to remember {259} that if\r\nHastings cannot be exculpated there is at least a measure of excuse to\r\nbe offered for his action.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be said from a certain point of view in defence of\r\nWarren Hastings's action with regard to the Rohilla war.  The Rohilla\r\nchiefs were no doubt a danger to the Nawab of Oude, whom Hastings\r\nregarded as a useful ally of the Company.  By the conquest of\r\nRohilkhand Hastings hoped to obtain for that ally a compact State shut\r\nin effectually from foreign invasion by the Ganges all the way from the\r\nfrontiers of Behar to the mountains of Thibet, while at the same time\r\nthis useful ally would remain equally accessible to the British forces\r\neither for hostilities or protection.  Put in this way the case seemed,\r\nno doubt, plausible enough to Hastings, and to all who thought with\r\nHastings that Indian chiefs and princes were but pieces on a board, to\r\nbe pushed this way or that way, advanced or removed altogether at the\r\npleasure and for the advantage of the English resident and ruler.  But\r\nwhat actually happened was that Hastings, in defiance of the whole\r\nprinciple of the Company's administration in India, interfered in the\r\ncontests of native races and lent the force of English arms to aid a\r\ndespot in the extirpation of his enemies.  It is not to the point to\r\nurge that the Rohillas were not undeserving of their fate.  Even if the\r\nRohillas were little other than robber chiefs, even if their existence\r\nconstituted a weak point in the lines of defence against the\r\never-terrible Mahrattas, all this did not in the eyes of Burke and of\r\nthose who thought with Burke justify Hastings in lending English arms\r\nfor their extermination and receiving Indian money for the loan.  They\r\nsaw an act of hideous injustice and corruption where Hastings saw\r\nmerely a piece of ingenious state policy.  He gave the troops, he got\r\nthe money.  The Rohillas were destroyed as an independent power, and\r\nthe Company was richer than it had been before the transaction by some\r\nfour hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThe story of Nand Kumar comes into the history as the result of an\r\norganic change in the composition and administration of the East India\r\nCompany.  North's {260} Regulating Act of 1773 made many changes in the\r\nadministration of English India.  The changes that most directly\r\nconcerned Hastings converted the Governor of Bengal into a\r\nGovernor-General, and reduced his Council to four members.  The\r\nGovernments of Madras and Bombay were placed under the joint control of\r\nGovernor-General and Council.  Hastings was appointed, naturally\r\nenough, to be the new Governor-General.  His four councillors were\r\nRichard Barwell, General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Philip Francis.\r\nBarwell was the only one who was a member of Hastings's old Council.\r\nThe three others were in England; they had been chosen expressly to\r\nguide Indian policy in accordance with the views of the home\r\nGovernment.  Clavering and Monson had already earned some distinction\r\nof a soldierly kind; Francis was by far the ablest of the three.  The\r\nauthor of the \"Letters of Junius\" was much of a scholar and something\r\nof a statesman, but he was a man of a fierce and unbending temper,\r\nprompt to quarrel, hotly arrogant in argument, unrelenting in his\r\nhatred of those who crossed his purposes.\r\n\r\nThese were not the kind of men with whom Hastings was likely to get on,\r\nand from the moment of their landing in India, where they complained\r\nthat they were not received with sufficient ceremony, they and Hastings\r\nwere furiously hostile.  The meetings of the Governor-General and his\r\nCouncil became so many pitched battles, in which Hastings, aided only\r\nby Barwell, fought with tenacity and patience against men whose\r\ndetermination appeared to be in every possible instance to undo what he\r\nhad done, and to oppose what he proposed to do.  They treated him as if\r\nhe were little better than a clerk in the Company's service; they acted\r\nas if their one purpose was to drive him out of public life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775--Charges against Hastings]\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was plain that the new men of the new Council were\r\nhostile to Hastings, Hastings's enemies were eager enough to come\r\nforward and help in the work.  One of Hastings's oldest and bitterest\r\nenemies was the Brahmin Nand Kumar.  Nand Kumar had always been hostile\r\nto Hastings.  Now, when Hastings was in danger, was {261} threatened\r\nwith defeat and with disgrace, Nand Kumar came forward with a whole\r\nstring of accusations against him, accusations to which Francis,\r\nClavering, and Monson listened eagerly.  Nand Kumar accused Hastings of\r\nmany acts of shameless bribery, declared that he himself had bribed him\r\nin large sums, and produced a letter from a native princess in which\r\nshe avowed that she had bribed Hastings in large sums.  The three\r\ncouncillors appear to have accepted every word uttered by Nand Kumar as\r\ngospel truth.  Hastings, on his side, refused to be arraigned at his\r\nown Council-board by a man whom he alleged to be of notoriously\r\ninfamous character, though he and Barwell were perfectly willing that\r\nthe whole matter should be referred to the Supreme Court.  At last\r\nHastings withdrew from the Council, followed by Barwell.  The others\r\nimmediately voted Clavering into the chair, summoned Nand Kumar before\r\nthem, listened to all that he had to say, and on that evidence, in the\r\nabsence of the accused man, the self-constituted tribunal found\r\nHastings guilty of taking bribes from the princess, and ordered him to\r\nrepay the sum of thirty-five thousand pounds to the public treasury.\r\n\r\nFor the moment it seemed as if Francis and his party had carried the\r\nday.  Hastings had his back to the wall, he seemed to be well-nigh\r\nfriendless.  The triumvirate declared that there was no form of\r\npeculation from which Hastings had thought it reasonable to abstain,\r\nand they formally charged him with having acquired by peculation a\r\nfortune of no less than forty lakhs of rupees in two years and a half.\r\nSuddenly, when the position of Hastings appeared to be at its worst, it\r\nchanged.  Nand Kumar and two Englishmen named Fowke, who had been very\r\nzealous against Hastings, were charged before the Supreme Court with\r\nconspiracy, in having compelled a native revenue farmer to bear false\r\nwitness against Hastings.  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was\r\nElijah Impey, Hastings's old and attached friend, a circumstance of\r\nwhich much has been made.  While Nand Kumar was bound over for trial on\r\nthe charge of conspiracy, another and more serious charge was brought\r\nagainst him by a native attorney, who {262} accused him of forging and\r\npublishing a bond.  On this charge Nand Kumar was arrested, and after a\r\nlengthy hearing of the case committed to the common jail.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very surprising in this charge of forgery.  Forgery\r\nwas not a very serious crime in the eyes of such men as either Nand\r\nKumar or his accuser.  It was made plain that, whether he had forged\r\nthe bond or no, he had forged the letter from the princess upon which\r\nthe charge against Hastings was based, for the princess herself\r\ndeclared it to be a forgery.  It had aroused some suspicion even before\r\nthe disclaimer, on account of the signature, which did not resemble her\r\nsignature in undoubted and authentic communications.  On the question\r\nof the forged bond Nand Kumar was duly and apparently fairly tried.  It\r\nwas not very much of a charge.  The business was very old.  The native\r\nattorney had been seeking for some time to bring Nand Kumar to trial,\r\nand had only substituted a criminal for a civil suit when the\r\nestablishment of the Supreme Court enabled him to do so.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1775--The execution of Nand Kumar]\r\n\r\nNand Kumar's trial ended in conviction, and conviction for forgery\r\nbrought with it by the English law sentence of death.  Whatever may be\r\nthought of the crime of forgery in England, it certainly was not looked\r\nupon in India by Indians as a criminal offence of a kind that called\r\nfor the severest penalty of the law.  But Nand Kumar had been tried by\r\nEnglish law.  His judges, in order to show their fidelity not merely to\r\nthe spirit but to all the forms of English law, had worn their heavy\r\nwigs all through the torrid heat of those Calcutta June days.  By the\r\nEnglish law he was convicted and sentenced to death.  The triumvirate\r\nmade little or no attempt to save the man on whose word they had\r\nrelied.  On August 5, 1775, Nand Kumar was hanged on the Maidan outside\r\nCalcutta.  He met his death with the composed courage of a man who\r\nlooked upon himself as a martyr.  Whatever his offences may have been,\r\nhe had done nothing which in his own eyes, or in the eyes of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, called for the pitiless punishment which fell upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOf course, the important question is how far, if at all, {263} Hastings\r\nwas concerned in the death of Nand Kumar.  That is just the question\r\nwhich it is impossible to answer definitely.  The certain facts are\r\nthat Nand Kumar was Hastings's enemy, that Impey was Hastings's friend;\r\nthat at a moment of grave crisis in Hastings's life, when Nand Kumar\r\nwas the most eminent witness against his name and fame, that witness,\r\nwas arraigned on a charge that was very old, that had been suddenly\r\nconverted from a civil to a criminal charge; that he was tried, found\r\nguilty, and executed.  On the basis of that bare narrative of facts it\r\nwould seem that if Hastings had nothing to do with the matter, he might\r\nalmost as well have had as far as the judgment of posterity went.  The\r\nthing was too apt, the conditions too peculiar not to leave their\r\nstigma upon the memory of the man who gained most by them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be remembered that, however black the\r\narguments against Hastings may seem, there is no positive proof that he\r\nwas directly implicated in what his enemies called the judicial murder\r\nof Nand Kumar.  It must be remembered that the writer who has gone most\r\ndeeply into the whole ugly story, Sir James Stephen, in his careful\r\n\"Story of Nuncomar,\" has after long and exhaustive analysis of every\r\nparticular of the case recorded his judgment in favor of Impey and of\r\nHastings.  Sir James Stephen's judgment is not final, indeed, but it\r\nmust have weight with any one who attempts impartially to appreciate\r\ntwo public men who have been accused for more than a century of a\r\nterrible crime.  Sir James Stephen believes that Nand Kumar's trial was\r\nperfectly fair, that Hastings had no share whatever in the prosecution,\r\nand that there was no collusion of any kind between Hastings and Impey\r\nwith regard to the trial, the verdict, or the execution.  Every one\r\nmust form as best he may his own judgment upon the matter and the men;\r\nbut Sir James Stephen's opinion is one that must be taken into account\r\nin any attempt to decide.\r\n\r\nThe death of Nand Kumar did not end the struggle between Hastings and\r\nhis three antagonists.  While they made no further attempt of a like\r\nkind--the fate of Nand {264} Kumar, said Francis, would prevent any\r\nfurther native information against the Governor-General--they still\r\nresolutely strove by all possible means to cross and check him.  It is\r\nnot necessary to follow in all their mean and wearisome details the\r\nparticulars of that prolonged conflict.  The odds were against Hastings\r\nuntil the death of Monson, when, by means of his own casting vote and\r\nthe adhesion of Barwell, Hastings found himself the master of the\r\nmajority at the Council-table.  But the persistence of the attacks had\r\ntheir result at home, where an ill-advised offer of resignation made by\r\nHastings was seized upon by the Directors of the Company.  The\r\nresignation was accepted, Wheler was appointed Governor-General in his\r\nstead, and pending his arrival in India the post was to be filled by\r\nClavering.\r\n\r\nThis was a severe blow for Hastings.  At first he thought of yielding\r\nto it, in which case his career in India would have been closed.  But\r\nClavering's indecent eagerness to seize upon the Governor-Generalship\r\nbefore it was fairly vacant forced Hastings to defiance.  He refused to\r\nsurrender his office to Clavering.  Clavering called upon the army to\r\nsupport him.  Hastings called upon the army to stand fast by him.  The\r\narmy followed Hastings, and the support of the men of the sword was\r\nfollowed by the support of the men of the robe.  The judges of the\r\nSupreme Court backed up Hastings and censured Clavering, and a little\r\nlater Clavering's death left Hastings for the time supreme in the\r\nCouncil-chamber.  His supremacy was contested after the arrival of\r\nWheler, who immediately sided with Francis against Hastings.  But the\r\nsupremacy was not overthrown.  Hastings was in the majority; he would\r\nnot allow the alliance of Francis and Wheler to impede him in his\r\npurposes, and he stuck to his post as Governor-General.\r\n\r\nThe East India Company made no effort to enforce his resignation.  The\r\nCourt of Directors resented his conduct, and found fault with him\r\npersistently, but they could not overlook his influence with the Court\r\nof Proprietors, and the condition of affairs in India was too grave to\r\nmake the {265} dismissal of Hastings wise or politic.  The Government\r\nbore Hastings little love, and the King in particular was much incensed\r\nat his refusal to resign, and was all for his recall and the recall of\r\nBarwell who had abetted, and the judges who had supported him.  But the\r\nstruggle with the American colonies absorbed the attention of the\r\nAdministration too closely to allow them to interfere so markedly in\r\nthe affairs of India at a moment when interference might perhaps have a\r\nresult not unlike the civil war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1702-82--Haidar the bitter enemy of the English]\r\n\r\nEnglish opposition was not the only difficulty that Warren Hastings had\r\nto contend with.  Like the monarch in the Arabian tale who discerns\r\narmies marching against his capital from every point of the compass,\r\nHastings found enemies rising up against him in all directions.  A\r\nleague of three native powers menaced the safety of the British\r\npossessions.  The Mahratta states combined with the Nizam of the\r\nDeccan.  Both again combined with a new power whose rise had been as\r\nrapid as it was alarming, the Mohammedan power of Haidar in Mysore.\r\nWhen Warren Hastings arrived in India the second time Haidar was in his\r\nsixty-seventh year.  He was born in 1702 as the son of a Mogul officer\r\nin the Punjaub.  At his death Haidar held a rank somewhat similar to\r\nthat of a captain in the service of the Emperor of Delhi.  Haidar\r\ndeemed, and rightly deemed, that there was little or no opportunity for\r\nhis ambition in that service, and his eyes seeking for a better chief,\r\nfound the man in Nunjeraj, the nominal vizier and real ruler of the\r\nRajah of Mysore.  In 1750 Haidar persuaded the troops under his command\r\nto leave their Mogul prince and take service with the sovereign of\r\nMysore.  Under that sovereignty he rose rapidly to distinction.  Though\r\nhe was little better than a robber chieftain, the ablest and most\r\ndaring robber of a horde of robbers, his power grew so rapidly that in\r\ntime he was able to supplant Nunjeraj, and in the end to usurp the\r\nsovereignty of Mysore in 1761.\r\n\r\nHaidar had his bitter grudge against the English.  In 1771 he had been\r\nbadly beaten by the Mahrattas and had appealed to the English to help\r\nhim, as they had {266} undertaken by treaty to do.  But the help was\r\nrefused to the defeated prince, and the defeated prince swore an oath\r\nof vengeance against the English, and when the time seemed ripe he did\r\nhis best to keep his oath.  When in 1779 France declared war against\r\nEngland, Haidar declared in favor of the French.  He gave his sword to\r\nthe service of the Grand Confederacy in 1778 and prepared to march upon\r\nMadras.  The President and the Council were taken unawares.  It was not\r\nuntil Haidar had marched with fire and sword into the Carnatic, and\r\nthat the smoke of the villages he destroyed in his progress could be\r\nseen from Madras, that they learned that Haidar was in earnest and not\r\nmerely making a menace in the hope of frightening the English into an\r\nadvantageous treaty.  Hastings himself seems to have been convinced\r\nthat Haidar did not mean to attack the Company, but when the Mysore\r\nprince's purpose was plain every effort was made to stay his onset.\r\nLord Macartney, although not one of the Company's servants, was made\r\nGovernor of Madras.  Haidar was compelled for the time to abandon his\r\nattempt upon the Carnatic.  In 1783 his hatred of the English was ended\r\nby his sudden death.  But he bequeathed it as a rich legacy to his son\r\nTippu, a man as daring and as ambitious as his sire.\r\n\r\nHastings won away by concessions the Mahrattas and the Nizam from the\r\ncause of Tippu.  But Tippu had his French allies, and Tippu and his\r\nFrench allies carried on a campaign successful enough to force the\r\nEnglish practically to appeal for a peace, which Tippu accorded in a\r\ntreaty flattering at once to his pride and to his ambition.  It was a\r\nsomewhat dearly bought peace for the English, for Tippu, regarding the\r\nadvances of the English as a proof of their weakness, made demands far\r\nmore arrogant than his successes justified, and those demands were\r\nagreed to by the English envoys.  The treaty with Tippu had to be made\r\non a basis of mutual restitution of conquests, so that England was left\r\nat the end of the struggle against Mysore with a great loss both of men\r\nand money, and no advantages, territorial or strategical, to set\r\nagainst the loss.  Even the peace upon these terms obtained did not\r\nprove {267} a lasting peace.  Tippu was not unnaturally tempted by the\r\nconcessions of the English into further displays of arrogance which in\r\ntime inevitably resulted in another war.  But by the time that war\r\nbroke out Warren Hastings had returned to England and had no further\r\npersonal concern with the affairs of British India.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Hastings's feud with his antagonists on the\r\nCouncil-board continued.  A kind of reconciliation, a kind of agreement\r\nwith Francis, enabled Hastings to allow Barwell to return to England\r\nand still to leave the Governor-General in authority at the Board.  But\r\nHastings found that reconciliation or agreement with Francis was\r\npractically impossible.  Rightly or wrongly, Francis renewed his old\r\npolicy of attacking every proposal and interfering with every project\r\nthat Hastings entertained.  At last the long quarrel came to a violent\r\nhead.  Hastings replied to one of Francis's minutes in some severe\r\nwords, in which he declared himself unable to rely upon Francis's word,\r\nas he had found Francis to be a man devoid of truth and honor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1780--Hastings and Francis fight a duel]\r\n\r\nSuch a charge made in those days was generally to be met with in only\r\none way.  In that way Francis met it.  Francis challenged Hastings to a\r\nduel.  Hastings accepted the challenge.  The antagonists met, exchanged\r\nshots, and Francis fell severely wounded before the pistol of Hastings.\r\nHastings sent friendly messages to Francis and offered to visit him,\r\nbut Francis rejected his overtures absolutely, and on his return to\r\nhealth renewed his attacks upon Hastings until the close of the year,\r\nwhen he sailed for England to carry on more successfully his plans\r\nagainst his enemy.\r\n\r\nWell as the Supreme Court had served Hastings in the case of Nuncomar\r\nand in the quarrel with Clavering, the time came when Hastings found\r\nhimself placed in a position of temporary hostility to that Court and\r\nto his old friend Impey.  The bad machinery of the Act of 1773 left\r\nroom for almost every possibility of friction between the Supreme Court\r\non the one hand and the Council on the other, instead of framing, as it\r\nshould have framed, its {268} measure so as to allow the two powers to\r\nwork harmoniously together, each in its own sphere, for the welfare of\r\nBritish India.  The friction grew more intense as time went on.\r\nSometimes one party to the quarrel was in the right, sometimes the\r\nother.  Whichever was the case, the spectacle of the quarrel was in\r\nitself sufficiently humiliating and sufficiently dangerous.  Hastings\r\ndevised a scheme for the better regulation of the powers and privileges\r\nof the two conflicting bodies, but his scheme was put on one side by\r\nthe British Government, and the Court and the Council remained as\r\nirreconcilable as before.  At last it reached such a pitch that the\r\nCourt issued a summons against the Government.  The Government ignored\r\nthe summons; things stood at a dead-lock; the personal relationships of\r\nHastings and Impey were strained almost to severance.  In this crisis\r\nHastings thought of and carried out a compromise.  He offered to Impey\r\nthe presidency of the Company's chief civil court.  Impey accepted the\r\noffer, and, though he has been severely censured for what has been\r\ncalled the taking of a bribe, the compromise proved to be the best way\r\nout of the difficulty that had arisen.  Impey, who has been happily\r\ncalled the first of Indian codifiers, showed himself to be an excellent\r\nhead for the provincial courts that were thus put under his control.\r\nThe provincial courts had been hitherto more of a curse than a\r\nblessing; under Impey's guidance they were brought into harmony with\r\nthe Supreme Court.  Impey was not long suffered to remain in his new\r\noffice.  Two years after his acceptance of the post he was removed from\r\nit by order of the Court of Directors.  But the work he had done in\r\nthat short time was good work and left abiding traces.  Hastings's plan\r\nhad borne fruit in Impey's \"Code,\" and afterwards in the passing of an\r\nAct of Parliament clearly defining the jurisdiction and the powers of\r\nthe Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1781--Hastings and the Rajah of Benares]\r\n\r\nOne of the latest acts of Warren Hastings's administration was also one\r\nof the acts that most provoked the indignation and the resentment of\r\nthose who in England were watching with hostile eyes the progress of\r\nhis career.  {269} Chait Singh, the Rajah of Benares, held authority at\r\nfirst under the ruler of Oude, and afterwards under the government of\r\nthe East India Company, to whom the sovereign of Oude had transferred\r\nit.  The Rajah of Benares paid a certain tribute to the Company.  The\r\nheavy necessities of the war compelled Hastings to call upon the Rajah\r\nfor a larger sum.  The step was not unusual.  In time of war a vassal\r\nof the Company might very well expect to be called upon for an\r\nincreased levy.  But the Rajah of Benares was very unwilling to give\r\nthis proof of his devotion to the Company.  He demurred, temporized,\r\npromised aid of men and arms, which was never rendered.  Hastings seems\r\nto have been convinced, first of all, that the Rajah was possessed of\r\nenormous wealth, and could well afford to pay heavily for the privilege\r\nof being ruled over by the Company, and in the second place that it was\r\nnecessary for the power and influence of the Company to force the\r\nalmost mutinous Rajah to his knees.  He made a final demand for no less\r\nthan fifty lakhs, or half a million pounds, and set off himself for\r\nBenares to compel the Rajah to obey.\r\n\r\nHastings never wanted courage, but his Benares expedition was certainly\r\nthe most daring deed of his whole life.  He entered the sacred city of\r\nBenares attended by an escort of a mere handful of men, and in Benares,\r\nin the midst of a hostile population, and practically in the power of\r\nthe Rajah, he acted as if he were the absolute master of prince,\r\npeople, and city.  He insisted upon his full demands being complied\r\nwith, and as the Rajah's reply appeared to be unsatisfactory he\r\nimmediately ordered his assistant, Mr. Markham, to place the Rajah\r\nunder arrest.  The audacity of the step was so great as to suggest\r\neither that Hastings was acting with the recklessness of despair, or\r\nhad formed no thought as to the not merely possible but probable result\r\nof his action.  The Rajah accepted the confinement to his palace with a\r\ndignified protest.  Two companies of sepoys were placed to guard him.\r\nThese sepoys had no ammunition; they were surrounded by swarms of the\r\nRajah's soldiery raging at the insult offered to their lord.  The\r\nRajah's men fell upon the sepoys and cut them {270} and their English\r\nofficers to pieces.  The Rajah lowered himself to the river by a rope\r\nof turbans, crossed the Ganges, and shut himself up in his stronghold\r\nof Ramnagar.  Hastings's life was in imminent peril.  Had he remained\r\nwhere he was he and his thirty Englishmen and his twenty sepoys would\r\nhave been massacred.  He fled in the darkness of the night to the\r\nfortress of Chunar, about thirty miles from Benares, where there was a\r\nsmall garrison of the Company's troops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1781--The Vizier of Oude and the Begums]\r\n\r\nHowever rash Hastings might have been in provoking the conflict with\r\nthe Rajah, once it was provoked he carried himself with admirable\r\ncourage and coolness.  Shut up with a small force in a region blazing\r\nwith armed rebellion, menaced by an army of forty thousand men, he\r\nacted with as much composure and ability as if he were the unquestioned\r\nmaster of the situation.  He declined all offers of assistance from the\r\nVizier of Oude, rejected all Chait Singh's overtures for peace, and\r\nissued his orders to the forces that were gradually rallying around him\r\nwith rare tact and judgment.  In a very short time the whole aspect of\r\naffairs changed.  The Company's forces under Major Popham defeated the\r\nRajah's troops, captured fort after fort, drove the Rajah to take\r\nrefuge in Bundelcund, and brought the city and district of Benares\r\nunder British rule again.  Hastings immediately declared that the\r\nfugitive Rajah's estates were forfeited, and he bestowed them upon the\r\nRajah's nephew upon tributary terms which bound him faster to the\r\nCompany, and exacted double the revenue formerly payable into the\r\nCompany's exchequer.\r\n\r\nBut the money which Hastings so urgently needed, the money for which he\r\nhad struck his bold stroke at Benares, was still lacking.  All the\r\nbooty gained in the reduction of Benares had been divided among the\r\nvictors; none of it had found its way into the Company's coffers.  The\r\nVizier of Oude was deeply in the Company's debt, but the Vizier of Oude\r\nwas in desperately straitened circumstances, and could not pay his\r\ndebt.  Knowing Hastings's need, the Vizier exposed to him certain plans\r\nhe had formed for raising money by seizing upon the estates of the two\r\n{271} Begums, his mother, the widow of the late Nawab, and his\r\ngrandmother, the late Nawab's mother.  The Vizier may have had just\r\nclaims enough upon the Begums, but it was peculiarly rash and\r\nunjustifiable of Hastings to make himself a party to the Vizier's\r\ninterests.  Hastings, unhappily for himself, lent the Vizier the aid of\r\nthe Company's troops.  The Begums, who were quite prepared to resist\r\ntheir feeble-spirited relation, did not go so far as to oppose the\r\nCompany in arms.  Their palace was occupied, their treasure seized,\r\ntheir servants imprisoned, and they themselves suffered discomforts and\r\nslights of a kind which constituted very real indignities and insults\r\nin the eyes of Mohammedan women.  This was practically the last, as it\r\nwas the most foolish, act of Hastings's rule.  It had the misfortune\r\nfor him of stirring the indignant soul of Burke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{272}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT IMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1785--Burke's knowledge of India]\r\n\r\nBurke's spacious mind was informed by a passion for justice.  He was\r\nnot cast in the mould of men who make concessions to their virtues or\r\ncompacts with their virtues.  He could not for a moment admit that the\r\naggrandizement of the empire should be gained by a single act of\r\ninjustice, and in his eyes Warren Hastings's career was stained by a\r\nlong succession of acts of injustice.  He certainly would not do evil\r\nthat good might come of it.  If the Rohilla war was a crime, if the\r\nexecution of Nand Kumar was an infamy, if the deposition of Chait Singh\r\nand the plundering of the Begums were crimes, then no possible\r\nadvantage that these acts might cause to the temporal greatness of the\r\nState could weigh for one moment in the balance with Burke.  In the\r\nhigh court of Burke's mind Warren Hastings was a doomed, a degraded\r\nman, even though it could have been proved, as indeed it would have\r\nbeen hard to prove, that any ill deeds which Warren Hastings had done\r\nwere essential to the maintenance of English rule and English glory in\r\nIndia.  Burke argued that English rule in India, English glory in\r\nIndia, did not gain but only lost by ill deeds.  But if England's gain\r\nand England's glory in India depended upon such deeds, he for his part\r\nwould have refused the gain and shuddered at the glory.\r\n\r\nIf Burke's all-conquering passion was a passion for justice, perhaps\r\nhis keenest political taste was for India and the affairs of India.  At\r\na time when our Indian Empire was merely in its dawn, at a time when\r\nthe affairs of India were looked upon by the nation at large as the\r\ncommercial matters of a company, Burke allowed all the resources of his\r\ngreat mind to be employed in the study of India.  He {273} knew\r\nIndia--he who had never sailed its seas or touched its shores--as\r\nprobably no other Englishmen of his time knew India, not even those\r\nwhose lives had been for the most part passed in the country.  And this\r\ncomprehensive knowledge Burke was able to impart again with a readiness\r\nthat was never unreliable, with a copiousness that was never redundant.\r\nHe gave a fascination to the figures of Indian finance; he made the\r\nfacts of contemporary Indian history live with all the charm of the\r\nmost famous events of Greek or Roman history.  India in his hands\r\nbecame what it rightly is, but what few had thought it till then, one\r\nof the most fascinating of human studies.  Indian affairs on his lips\r\nallied all the allurement of a romance with all the statistical\r\naccuracy of a Parliamentary report.  Such a genius for the presentation\r\nof facts inspired by such a passion for justice has enriched English\r\nliterature with some of its noblest and most truthful pages.\r\n\r\nThe pith of all Burke's Indian policy, the text upon which all his\r\nsplendid sermons of Indian administration were preached, is to be found\r\nin one single sentence of the famous speech on the Nabob of Arcot's\r\ndebts.  In that single sentence the whole of Burke's theory of\r\ngovernment is summed up with the directness of an epigram and with the\r\nauthority of a law.  \"Fraud, injustice, oppression, peculation,\r\nengendered in India, are crimes of the same blood, family, and caste,\r\nwith those that are born and bred in England.\"  Outside the noble\r\nsimplicity of that ethical doctrine Burke could not and would not\r\nbudge.  That sentence represents the whole difference between him and\r\nthe man whom he afterwards accused, between him and the men of whom\r\nthat man came to be the representative.  Burke's morality was direct,\r\nuncompromising, unalterable by climatic conditions or by the supple\r\nmoralities of other races.  The morality of Warren Hastings and of\r\nthose who thought with and acted for Warren Hastings was the morality\r\nof Clive beforehand, was the morality that had been professed and\r\npractised time and again since the days of Clive and Hastings by the\r\ninheritors of their policy in India.  The ingenious theory was set up\r\nthat in {274} dealing with Oriental races it was essential for the\r\nEnglishman to employ Oriental means of carrying his point.  If an\r\nOriental would lie and cheat and forge and, if needs were, murder, why\r\nthen the Englishman dealing with him must lie and cheat and forge and\r\nmurder too, in order to gain the day.  Things that he would not dare to\r\ndo, things that, to do him justice, he would not dream of doing in\r\nEngland, were not merely permissible but justifiable, not merely\r\njustifiable but essential in his intercourse with Asiatic princes and\r\npeoples, with dexterous Mohammedan and dexterous Hindoo.  The policy\r\nwas inevitably new in Burke's time; it has been upheld again and again\r\nsince Burke's time.  The theory which allowed Clive to forge and Warren\r\nHastings to plunder was the same principle which led English soldiers\r\nthree generations later to make Brahmins wipe up blood before being\r\nkilled, which prompted them to blow their prisoners from the cannon's\r\nmouth in the hope that their victims should believe that their souls as\r\nwell as their bodies were about to perish, which instigated gallant men\r\nto suggest in all seriousness the advisability of flaying alive their\r\ncaptured mutineers.  The influence of the East is not always a\r\nwholesome influence upon the wanderer from the West.  It is displayed\r\nat its worst when it leads great men, as Clive and Hastings undoubtedly\r\nwere great men, into the perpetration of evil actions, and the\r\njustification of them on the principle that in dealing with an Oriental\r\nthe Englishman's morality undergoes a change, and becomes for the time\r\nand the hour an Oriental morality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1785-87--The defender of Hastings]\r\n\r\nAgainst such an adversary, Hastings, ignorant of the conditions of\r\nEnglish political life, could bring forward no better champion than\r\nMajor Scott.  Hastings opposed to the greatest orator and most widely\r\ninformed man of his age, a man of meagre parts, who only succeeded in\r\nwearying profoundly the House of Commons and every other audience to\r\nwhich he appealed.  Such a proconsul as Warren Hastings standing his\r\ntrial upon such momentous charges needed all the ability, all the art\r\nthat an advocate can possess to be employed in his behalf.  Had\r\nHastings {275} been so lucky as to find a defender endowed, not indeed\r\nwith the genius or the knowledge of Burke, for there was no such man to\r\nbe found, but with something of the genius, something of the knowledge\r\nof Burke, his case might have appeared very different then and in the\r\neyes of posterity.  If Scott could have pleaded for Hastings\r\neloquently, brilliantly, with something of the rich coloring, something\r\nof the fervid enthusiasm that was characteristic of the utterances of\r\nhis great antagonist, he might have done much to stem, if not to turn\r\nthe stream of public thought.  But Warren Hastings was not graced so\r\nfar.  His sins had indeed found him out when he was cursed with such an\r\nenemy and cursed with such a friend.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Hastings himself on his return had little idea of the\r\nserious danger with which he was menaced.  He seems to have become\r\nconvinced that his services to the State must inevitably outweigh any\r\naccidents or errors in the execution of those services.  He honestly\r\nbelieved himself to have been a valuable and estimable servant of his\r\ncountry and his Crown.  We may very well take his repeated declarations\r\nof his own integrity and uprightness, not, indeed, as proof of his\r\npossession of those qualities, but as proof of his profound belief that\r\nhe did possess them.  When he landed in England he appears to have\r\nexpected only honors, only acclamation, admiration, and applause.  He\r\nreturned to accept a triumph; he did not dream that he should have to\r\nface a trial.\r\n\r\nThe long years in India had served to confuse his perception of the\r\nconduct of affairs at home.  He did not in the least appreciate the men\r\nwith whom he had to deal.  If he gauged pretty closely the malignity of\r\nFrancis, he may have fancied that the malignity was not very likely to\r\nprove dangerous.  But he wholly misunderstood the character of the\r\nother foes, as important as Francis was unimportant, who were ranged\r\nagainst him.  He made the extraordinary mistake of despising Burke.\r\n\r\nHastings had certain anxieties on his return to England, His first was\r\ncaused by his disappointment at not finding his wife in London to greet\r\nhim on his arrival, a {276} disappointment that was consoled two days\r\nlater when, as he was journeying post-haste to the country to join her,\r\nhe met her on Maidenhead Bridge driving in to join him.  His second was\r\nthe pleasurable anxiety of negotiating for the purchase of Daylesford,\r\nthe realization of his youthful dream.  He was made a little anxious\r\ntoo, later on, by the delay in the awarding to him of those honors\r\nwhich he so confidently expected.  But he does not seem to have been\r\ndisturbed in any appreciable degree by the formidable preparations\r\nwhich were being made against him by Burke and Fox and the followers of\r\nBurke and Fox.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that those preparations might have come to little\r\nor nothing but for the folly of Major Scott.  Major Scott was mad\r\nenough to try and force the hand of the enemies of Hastings by calling\r\nupon Burke and Fox to fix a day for the charges that they were\r\nunderstood to be prepared to bring against him.  Fox immediately rose\r\nto assure Major Scott that the matter was not forgotten.  Burke, with\r\ngrave composure, added that a general did not take choice of time and\r\nplace of battle from his adversaries.  It has been suggested that but\r\nfor Major Scott's ill-advised zeal the attack might never have come to\r\na head.  But the conclusion is one which it would be rash to draw.\r\nBurke was not the man to forego his long-cherished hope of bringing a\r\ncriminal to justice.  If he had been inclined to forego it, he was not\r\nthe kind of man to be goaded into unwilling resumption of his purpose\r\nby the taunts of Major Scott.  It may surely be assumed that the\r\nimpeachment of Warren Hastings would have been made even if Major Scott\r\nhad been as wise and discreet as he proved himself to be unwise and\r\nindiscreet.\r\n\r\nEven when the attack was formally begun, Hastings failed to grasp its\r\ngravity or guess the best mode of meeting it.  He insisted upon being\r\nheard at the Bar of the House in his own defence.  A man of rare\r\noratorical ability, gifted with special skill in the selection of his\r\nmaterial and the adjustment of his arguments, might have done himself a\r\ngood turn by such a decision.  But Hastings was not so endowed, and he\r\nwould have done far better in {277} following the example of Clive and\r\nof Rumbold.  He committed the one fault which the House of Commons\r\nnever forgives, he wearied it.  Such dramatic effect as he might have\r\ngot out of his position as a proconsul arraigned before a senate he\r\nspoiled by the length and tedium of his harangue.  He took two days to\r\nread a long and wordy defence, two days which he considered all too\r\nshort, and which the House of Commons found all too long.  It yawned\r\nwhile Hastings prosed.  Accustomed to an average of eloquence of which\r\nthe art has long been lost, it found Hastings's paper insufferably\r\nwearisome.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was the target for the eloquence of Burke, of Fox, and of\r\nSheridan, still Hastings's hopes were high, and they mounted higher\r\nwhen the Rohilla war charge was rejected by a large majority.  But they\r\nwere only raised so high to be dashed to earth again in the most\r\nunexpected manner.  The friends of Hastings were convinced that he\r\nwould have the unfailing support of Pitt in his defence.  He was now to\r\nlearn that he was mistaken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1787--Pitt and the impeachment]\r\n\r\nHastings had one very zealous champion in the House of Commons.  This\r\nwas a young member, Sir James Bland-Burges.  He rose not merely with\r\nthe approval of Pitt, but actually at Pitt's instigation, to defend\r\nWarren Hastings on the question of the treatment of the Rajah of\r\nBenares.  It is scarcely surprising that the House did not pay him any\r\ngreat attention.  Having just come under \"the spell of the enchanter,\"\r\nit would hardly have listened with attention to an old and well-known\r\nmember, and Bland-Burges was a young and unknown man.  He could not\r\ncommand a hearing, so, whispering to Pitt that he would leave the\r\nremainder of the defence to him, he sat down, and the debate, on Pitt's\r\nsuggestion, was adjourned.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the young defender came to the House hot to hear\r\nPitt deliver to an attentive senate that defence which he had striven\r\nunsuccessfully to make.  He has recorded the astonishment, indignation,\r\nand despair when Pitt rose to make his declaration concerning the\r\ncharge against Hastings.  The minister in whom Hastings trusted to find\r\nan ally offered some cold condemnation of {278} the intemperance of the\r\nattack, proffered some lukewarm praise to Hastings, and then announced\r\nthat he would agree to the motion.  To most of Pitt's supporters Pitt's\r\naction came as an unpleasant surprise; but to Bland-Burges, from his\r\nprevious conversation with the minister, it seemed like an act of\r\ntreason.  There was little for Bland-Burges to do, but it is to his\r\ncredit that he did that little.  It required no small courage for a\r\nfollower and a friend of Pitt to defy his authority in the House.  Yet\r\nthat is practically what Bland-Burges did.  Raging with indignation at\r\nwhat he conceived to be the tergiversation of his leader and the\r\ntreachery to his hero, Bland-Burges once again forced himself upon the\r\nattention of the House.  The leaders on both sides being agreed, it was\r\nexpected that the matter would be settled out of hand, and the Speaker\r\nhad actually put the question and declared it carried when Bland-Burges\r\nleaped to his feet and challenged a division.  He acted with the\r\ncourage of his despair, but, as he says, few unpremeditated enterprises\r\never succeeded better than this one.  \"The question indeed was carried\r\nby a great majority, but those who were against it were almost entirely\r\nof those who till then had implicitly voted with the minister.  This\r\nwas not only mortifying to Mr. Pitt, but highly encouraging to Mr.\r\nHastings and his steadfast friends.\"\r\n\r\nBland-Burges did not escape an early intimation of the disapproval of\r\nhis chief.  When the House broke up, Pitt said to him, with an austere\r\nlook, \"So, sir, you have thought proper to divide the House.  I hope\r\nyou are satisfied.\"  Bland-Burges answered that he was perfectly\r\nsatisfied.  \"Then you seem satisfied very easily,\" the minister\r\nretorted; to which Bland-Burges replied, \"Not exactly so, sir.  I am\r\nsatisfied with nothing that has passed this evening except the\r\ndiscovery I have made that there were still honest men present.\"  \"On\r\nthat,\" Bland-Burges continues, \"with a stern look and a stately air he\r\nleft me.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1787--Bland-Burges and Hastings]\r\n\r\nBland-Burges won a reward for his courage which outweighed the\r\ndisapproval of Pitt.  When he had thus {279} volunteered on behalf of\r\nWarren Hastings he was so entirely a stranger to him that he did not\r\neven know him by sight.  Naturally enough, however, the arraigned man\r\nwas desirous to become acquainted with the stranger who had stood by\r\nhim when his own friends had abandoned him.  He lost no time,\r\ntherefore, in calling upon Bland-Burges to thank him for the part he\r\nhad played.  Bland-Burges says that the conversation was deeply\r\ninteresting, but that he only made a note of one passage, in which he\r\nexplained that, independently of his own conviction that the cause of\r\nWarren Hastings was just and honorable, he had been moved to take part\r\nin his defence by the positive instructions of his father, who had died\r\nabout two years previously.  Bland-Burges's father, attributing the\r\npreservation of England's power in India to Hastings, had enjoined his\r\nson, if ever an attack were made upon Hastings, to abstract himself\r\nfrom all personal and party considerations and to support him liberally\r\nand manfully.  Whatever we may think of the conduct of Warren Hastings,\r\nit is a pleasure to find that those who thought him to be in the right\r\nstood up for their belief as honorably and as gallantly as\r\nBland-Burges.  It is not surprising that Warren Hastings was moved to\r\ntears.  That day's interview was the beginning of a friendship that\r\nendured unbroken until the death of Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nThe reason which Pitt gave for his action on the Benares vote was\r\nsimple enough.  He said that, although the action of Hastings towards\r\nthe Rajah was in itself justifiable, yet that the manner of the action\r\nwas not justifiable.  Chait Singh deserved to be fined, but not to be\r\nfined in an exorbitant and tyrannical manner.  The explanation might\r\nvery well be considered sufficient.  A high-minded minister might feel\r\nbound to condemn the conduct of an official whom he admired, if that\r\nconduct had pushed a legal right to an illegal length.  But Pitt's\r\ndecision came with such a shock to the friends, and even to the enemies\r\nof Hastings, that public rumor immediately set to work to find some\r\nother less simple and less honest reason for Pitt's action.  One rumor\r\nascribed it to an {280} interview with Dundas, in which Dundas had\r\nsucceeded, after hours of argument, in inducing Pitt to throw Warren\r\nHastings over.  Another suggested that Pitt was spurred by anger at a\r\ndeclaration of Thurlow's that he and the King between them would make\r\nHastings a peer, whether the minister would or no.  A third suggested\r\nthat Pitt was jealous of the royal favor to Mr. and Mrs. Hastings;\r\nwhile a fourth asserted that Pitt deliberately sacrificed Hastings in\r\norder to afford the Opposition other quarry than himself.  But there is\r\nno need to seek for any other motive than the motive which Pitt\r\nalleged.  It was quite sufficient to compel an honorable man to give\r\nthe vote that Pitt gave.\r\n\r\nBlow after blow fell upon Hastings.  The terrible attacks of Burke were\r\nfor a time eclipsed by the dazzling brilliancy of Sheridan's attack\r\nupon him in the famous Begum speech.  Those who heard that speech speak\r\nof it with reverence and with passion as one of the masterpieces of the\r\nworld.  In the form in which it is preserved, or rather in which it has\r\nfailed to be preserved for us, it is hard, if not impossible, to find\r\nmerit calling for the rapture which it aroused in the minds of men\r\nfamiliar with magnificent oratory, and perfectly competent to judge.\r\nThat it did arouse rapture is beyond doubt, and for the moment it was\r\neven more effective in injuring Hastings than the more profound but\r\nless flaming utterances of Burke.  The testimony of Fox, the testimony\r\nof Byron, alike are offered in its unqualified praise.\r\n\r\nIt was decided by the House of Commons, with the consent of Pitt, that\r\nHastings should be impeached.  One indignity Pitt spared him, one\r\ndanger Pitt saved him from.  Burke was, somewhat incomprehensibly,\r\nanxious that the name of Francis should be placed upon that Committee\r\nof Impeachment to which Burke had already been nominated as the first\r\nmember by Pitt.  But here Pitt was resolute.  Francis was flagrantly\r\nhostile to Hastings, hostile with a personal as well as a public\r\nhatred, and Pitt could not tolerate the notion that he should find a\r\nplace upon the Committee of Impeachment.  Burke protested, and the\r\n{281} very protest was characteristic of Burke's high-mindedness.  For\r\nto Burke the whole business was a purely public business, in no sense\r\nconnected with any private feelings, and it seemed to him as if the\r\nexclusion of any one of those who had been conspicuous in the\r\narraignment of Hastings from a responsible place on the Committee of\r\nImpeachment on the ground of personal feeling was to cast something\r\nlike a slur upon the purity of motive of the men engaged in the attack.\r\nBut Pitt was in the right, and the name of Francis was, by a large\r\nmajority, not suffered to appear upon the committee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1787--The impeachment trial]\r\n\r\nIn the May of 1787 Burke formally impeached Warren Hastings at the Bar\r\nof the House of Lords.  Hastings was immediately taken into custody by\r\nthe Sergeant-at-Arms, and was held to bail for 20,000 pounds, with two\r\nsureties for 10,000 pounds each.  The delay which was to be\r\ncharacteristic of the whole proceedings was evident from the first.\r\nThough Hastings was taken into custody in the May of 1787, It was not\r\nuntil February 13 of the following year, 1788, that the impeached man\r\nwas brought to his trial in Westminster Hall.\r\n\r\nBefore the trial began, popular feeling was roused against Hastings\r\nmore keenly by the action of the Court than by the action of Burke and\r\nof his colleagues.  The Court was inclined to be even more than\r\nfriendly to Hastings and to his wife, and both Hastings and his wife,\r\nwho were not in touch with English public opinion, took the unwise\r\ncourse of making the very most of the royal favor, and of displaying\r\nthemselves as much as possible in the royal sunlight.  The London\r\npublic, always jealous of any Court favoritism, resented the patronage\r\nof Hastings, and while it was in this temper an event took place which\r\nserved to heighten its resentment.  The Nizam of the Deccan had sent a\r\nvery magnificent diamond to the King as a present, and, being ignorant\r\nof what was going on in England, he chose Hastings, naturally enough,\r\nas the medium through which to convey his diamond to the King.\r\nHastings, with the want of judgment which characterized him at this\r\ntime, accepted a duty which, delicate at any {282} time, became under\r\nthe conditions positively dangerous.  He was present at the Levee at\r\nwhich the diamond was presented to the King.  Immediately rumor seized\r\nupon the incident and distorted it.  It was confidently asserted that\r\nHastings was bribing the Sovereign with vast presents of precious\r\nstones to use his influence in his behalf.  The solitary diamond became\r\nin the popular eye more numerous than the stones that Sinbad came upon\r\nin the enchanted valley.  The print-shops teemed with caricatures, all\r\ngiving some highly colored exaggeration of the prevailing impression.\r\nEvery possible pictorial device which could suggest to the passer-by\r\nthat Hastings was buying the protection of the King by fabulous gifts\r\nof diamonds was made public.  In one Hastings was shown flinging\r\nquantities of precious stones into the open mouth of the King.  In\r\nanother he was represented as having bought the King bodily, crown and\r\nsceptre and all, with his precious stones, and as carrying him away in\r\na wheelbarrow.  So high did popular feeling run that the great diamond\r\nbecame the hero of a discussion in the House of Commons, when Major\r\nScott was obliged to make a statement in his chief's behalf giving an\r\naccurate account of what had really occurred.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Warren Hastings is one of the most remarkable examples of\r\ncontrasts in human affairs that is to be found in the whole course of\r\nour history.  It began under conditions of what may fairly be called\r\nnational interest.  It came to an end amid the apathy and indifference\r\nof the public.  When it began, the Great Hall of Westminster was\r\nscarcely large enough to contain all those who longed to be present at\r\nthe trial of the great proconsul.  All the rank, the wealth, the\r\ngenius, the wit, the beauty of England seemed to be gathered together\r\nin the building, which is said to be the oldest inhabited building in\r\nthe world.  When it ended, and long before it had ended, the attendance\r\nhad dwindled down to a mere handful of spectators, some two or three\r\nscore of persons whose patience, whose interest, or whose curiosity had\r\nsurvived the indifference with which the rest of the world had come to\r\n{283} regard the whole business.  The spirit of genius and the spirit\r\nof dulness met in close encounter in that memorable arena, and it must\r\nbe admitted that the spirit of dulness did on the whole prevail.  There\r\nseemed a time when it was likely that the trial might go on forever.\r\nMen and women who came to the first hearing eager on the one side or\r\nthe other, impassioned for Hastings or enthusiastic for Burke, died and\r\nwere buried, and new men and women occupied themselves with other\r\nthings, and still the trial dragged its slow length along.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1788-95--Hastings's Oriental fortitude]\r\n\r\nIt may be unhesitatingly admitted that during the long course of the\r\ntrial Warren Hastings bore himself with courage and with dignity.  He\r\nwas firmly convinced that he was a much-injured man, and if the justice\r\nof a man's cause were to be decided merely upon the demeanor of the\r\ndefendant, Hastings would have been exonerated.  He professed to be\r\nhorrified, and he no doubt was horrified, by what he called \"the\r\natrocious calumnies of Mr. Burke and Mr. Fox.\"  He carried himself as\r\nif they were indeed atrocious calumnies without any basis whatsoever.\r\nHis attitude was that of the martyr supported by the serenity of the\r\nsaint.  He had lived so long in the East that he gained not a little of\r\nthat Eastern fortitude which is the fortitude of fatalism.  While the\r\ntrial was progressing he told a dear friend that he found much\r\nconsolation in a certain Oriental tale.  The story was of an Indian\r\nking whose temper never knew a medium, and who in prosperity was\r\nhurried into extravagance by his joy, while in adversity grief\r\noverwhelmed him with despondency.  Having suffered many inconveniences\r\nthrough this weakness, he besought his courtiers to devise a sentence,\r\nshort enough to be engraved upon a ring, which should suggest a remedy\r\nfor his evil.  Many phrases were proposed; none were found acceptable\r\nuntil his daughter offered him an emerald on which were graven two\r\nArabic words, the literal translation of which is, \"This, too, will\r\npass.\"  The King embraced his daughter and declared that she was wiser\r\nthan all his wise men.  \"Now,\" said Hastings, \"when I appear at the Bar\r\nand hear the violent invectives {284} of my enemies, I arm myself with\r\npatience.  I reflect upon the mutability of human life, and I say to\r\nmyself, 'This, too, will pass.'\"\r\n\r\nIt did pass, but it took its long time to pass.  The trial lasted seven\r\nyears.  Begun in the February of 1788, it ended in the April of 1795.\r\nIn that long space of time men might well be excused if they had grown\r\nweary of it.  Had its protracted course been even pursued in colorless,\r\neventless times it would have been hard to preserve the public interest\r\nin the trial so terribly drawn out.  But it was one of the curious\r\nfortunes of the trial to embrace within its compass some of the most\r\nthrilling and momentous years that have been recorded in the history of\r\nmankind.  In the year after the trial began the Bastille fell.  In the\r\nyear before the trial closed the Reign of Terror came to an end with\r\nthe deaths of Robespierre and St. Just.  The interval had seen the\r\nwhole progress of the French Revolution, had applauded the\r\nconstitutional struggle for liberty, had shuddered at the September\r\nmassacres, had seen the disciplined armies of the great European Powers\r\nreel back dismayed before the ragged regiments of the Republic, had\r\nseen France answer Europe with the head of a king, with the head of a\r\nqueen, had observed how the Revolution, like Saturn, devoured its own\r\nchildren, had witnessed with fear as well as with fury the apotheosis\r\nof the guillotine.  While the events in France were shaking every\r\nEuropean State, including England, to its centre, it was hard for the\r\npublic mind to keep itself fixed with any degree of intentness upon the\r\ntrial of Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nThe events of that interval had affected too, profoundly, the chief\r\nactor in the trial.  Burke entered upon the impeachment of Warren\r\nHastings at the zenith of his great career, at the moment of his\r\ngreatest glory.  The rise and progress of the French evolution\r\nexercised a profound, even a disastrous, effect upon him.  For once his\r\nfine intellect failed to discriminate between the essentials and the\r\nnon-essentials of a great question.  His horror at the atrocities of\r\nthe Revolution blinded him to all the advantages that {285} the success\r\nof the Revolution brought with it.  The whole framework of that great\r\nevent was to him so hideously stained with the blood of the Queen, with\r\nthe blood of so many innocent persons, that he could see nothing but\r\nthe blood, and the influence of this is to be noticed in Burke's final\r\nspeech with its almost confident expectation that the guillotine would\r\nsooner or later be established in England.  Burke's frenzy against the\r\nFrench Revolution made it appear to many as if his reasoned and careful\r\nindictment of the erring Governor-General might after all be only mere\r\nfrenzy too.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1788-95--Acquittal of Hastings]\r\n\r\nSuch as it was, and under such conditions, the trial did come to an end\r\nat last, after such alternations of brilliant speeches and dull\r\nspeeches as the world had never witnessed before.  Sheridan again added\r\nto his fame by a speech of which, unhappily, we are able to form no\r\nvery clear idea.  Law defended Hastings in detailing the whole of the\r\nhistory of Hindostan.  Hastings again and again appealed piteously and\r\npathetically that the trial might be brought somehow or other to an\r\nend.  He was growing old, he had been for years a nominal prisoner, he\r\nwas very anxious that the terrible strain of waiting upon the slow\r\nproceedings of the tribunal should be relieved.  At last the end came\r\nafter weary years of controversy, in which Hastings had been loaded\r\nwith more contumely and lauded with more extravagance than it were\r\npossible to conceive him good enough or bad enough to deserve.\r\nFinally, in the April of 1795, Warren Hastings was acquitted by a large\r\nmajority on every one of the sixteen counts against him that were put\r\nto the vote.  Burke could not conceal his chagrin at this unexpected\r\nresult.  He had expected, he declared afterwards, that the corruption\r\nof the age would enable Hastings to escape on some of the counts, but\r\nhe was not prepared for the total acquittal.  It is probable that\r\nHastings himself was not prepared for it, but the relief it afforded\r\nhim was tempered by the grave financial difficulties into which he\r\nfound himself plunged.  The conduct of that long defence had well-nigh\r\nexhausted all his available resources.  After a vain appeal to Pitt to\r\n{286} indemnify him for his legal expenses, an arrangement was come to\r\nbetween the Government and the Company by which Hastings was enabled to\r\nlive at first in straitened, afterwards in moderate, circumstances for\r\nthe rest of his life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1788-95--Effect of the impeachment trial]\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be questioned but that Burke was in some degree\r\nresponsible for the result of the trial.  His burning sense of\r\ninjustice, his passionate righteousness, and the perfervid strength of\r\nhis convictions betrayed him into an intemperance of language that\r\ninevitably caused a reaction of sympathy in favor of the man so\r\nviolently assailed.  It is impossible to read without regret the actual\r\nferocity of the epithets that Burke hurled against Warren Hastings.  In\r\nthis he was followed, even exceeded, by Sheridan; but the utterances of\r\nSheridan, while they enraptured their hearers by their brilliancy, did\r\nnot carry with them the weight that attached to the utterances of\r\nBurke.  Burke's case was too strong to need an over-charged form of\r\nexpression.  The plain statement of the misdeeds of Warren Hastings was\r\nfar more telling as an indictment than the abuse with which Burke\r\nunhappily was tempted to overload his case.  Those who were amazed and\r\nsickened, with Macaulay, to think that in that age any one could be\r\nfound capable of calling the greatest of living public men, \"that\r\nreptile Mr. Burke,\" must reluctantly be compelled to admit that Burke\r\nset his enemies a bad example by his own unlicensed use of opprobrium.\r\nIn justifying, for instance, the application to Warren Hastings of\r\nCoke's savage description of Raleigh as a \"spider of hell,\" Burke\r\nallowed his fierce indignation to get the better of his tongue, to the\r\ndetriment of his own object, the bringing of an offender to justice.\r\nMiss Burney in her memoirs affords a remarkable instance of the injury\r\nwhich Burke did to his own object by the exuberance of his anger.  She\r\ntells us how, as she listened to Burke's arraignment of Hastings, and\r\nwent over the catalogue of his offences, she felt her sympathy for\r\nHastings slowly disappear, but that as Burke increased in the fury of\r\nhis assault, and passed from accusation to invective, the convincing\r\neffect {287} of his oratory withered, and the effect which he had so\r\ncarefully created he himself contrived to destroy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of defects which in some degree brought their own punishment\r\nwith them, Burke's speeches against Warren Hastings must ever remain\r\namong the highest examples of human eloquence employed in the service\r\nof the right.  The gifts of the statesman, the philosopher, the orator,\r\nthe great man of letters, are all allied in those marvellous pages\r\nwhich first taught Englishmen how closely their national honor as well\r\nas their national prosperity was involved in the administration of\r\njustice in India.  If Burke failed to convict Warren Hastings, he\r\nsucceeded in convicting the system which made such misdemeanors as\r\nWarren Hastings's possible.  We owe to Burke a new India.  What had\r\nbeen but the appanage of a corrupt and corrupting Company he\r\npractically made forever a part of the glory and the grandeur of the\r\nBritish Empire.\r\n\r\nAbuse and invective were not confined to Burke nor to the side which\r\nBurke represented.  Warren Hastings, or those who acted for Warren\r\nHastings, employed every means in their power to blacken the characters\r\nof their opponents and to hold them up to public ridicule and to public\r\ndetestation.  The times were not gentle times for men engaged in\r\npolitical warfare, and the companions of Hastings employed all the arts\r\nthat the times placed at their disposal.  Burke and Sheridan, and those\r\nwho acted with Burke and Sheridan, were savage enough in the tribune,\r\nbut they did not employ the extra-tribunal methods by which their enemy\r\nretaliated upon them.\r\n\r\nHastings is scarcely to be blamed, considering duly the temper of his\r\nage, for doing everything that party warfare permitted against his\r\nopponents.  He was fighting as for his life; he was fighting for what\r\nwas far dearer to him than life--for life, indeed, he had ever shown a\r\nmost soldierly disregard; he was fighting for an honorable name, for\r\nthe reward of a lifetime devoted to the interests of his country, as he\r\nunderstood those interests; he was fighting for fame as against infamy,\r\nand he fought hard and he {288} fought after the fashion of the time in\r\nwhich he lived.  The newspaper, the pamphlet, the lampoon, the\r\ncaricature, the acidulated satire, the envenomed epigram, all were\r\nused, and used with success, against the promoters of the impeachment.\r\n\r\nThe caricatures were not all on one side, but the most numerous and the\r\nmost effective were in favor of the impeached statesman.  If the\r\nadversaries of Hastings naturally seized upon the opportunity of a\r\nclassical effect by presenting Burke and Hastings in the character of\r\nCicero and Verres, the friends of Verres replied by the pencil of\r\nGillray, representing Hastings as the savior of India defending himself\r\nheroically against assassins with the faces of Burke and of Fox.  As\r\nthe interest in the trial flagged the caricatures grew fewer and fewer,\r\nto revive a little at the close of the case.  The popular view of the\r\ntrial was then represented fairly enough by a large print called \"The\r\nLast Scene of the Manager's Farce,\" in which Hastings was represented\r\nas rising in glory from the clouds of calumny, while Burke and Fox are\r\nrepresented witnessing with despair the failure of their protracted\r\nfarce, and the crafty face of Philip Francis peeped from behind a scene\r\nwhere he was supposed to be playing the part of the prompter--\"no\r\ncharacter in the farce, but very useful behind the scenes,\" a\r\ndescription which sums up smartly enough the part that Philip Francis\r\nplayed in the whole transaction from first to last.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1818--Death of Hastings]\r\n\r\nThe eve of Hastings's life was as peaceful as its noon and day had been\r\nstormy.  The proconsul became a country squire; the ruler of an empire,\r\nthe autocrat of kings, soothed his old age very much after the fashion\r\nof Diocletian and of Candide, in the planting of cabbages.  For\r\nthree-and-twenty years he dwelt at Daylesford, happy in his wife, happy\r\nin his friends, happy in his health, in his rustic tastes, in his\r\nsimple pleasures, in his tranquil occupation.  He and his wife often\r\nvisited London, but Hastings seems to have been always happiest in the\r\ncountry, and he gradually declined into extreme old age with all the\r\ngrace and dignity of a Roman gentleman, loved by his {289} friends,\r\ndearly loved by those who were young.  Once in those long quiet years,\r\nafter the death of Pitt, Hastings, to please his wife, pleaded for\r\npublic reparation of the wrong which he believed had been done him.\r\nGrenville professed every willingness to grant him a peerage, but\r\nrefused to entertain the idea of inducing the Commons to reverse their\r\nformer judgment.  On those terms Hastings declined the peerage.  The\r\nnearest approach to anything like public consolation for his sorrows\r\ncame to him in 1813, when, at the age of eighty, he came once more to\r\nthe Bar of the House of Commons, this time to give evidence on the\r\nquestion of renewing the Charter of the East India Company.  By both\r\nHouses, Commons and Lords alike, the old man was greeted with the\r\ngreatest enthusiasm, saluted with rapturous applause on his arrival,\r\nwith reverential salutations on his departure.  In 1818 the health\r\nwhich he had preserved so well till then broke, and he died after some\r\nsevere suffering on August 22 in that year, and was laid in the earth\r\nthat he had always loved so well.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest acts of his life was to appeal to the Court of\r\nDirectors to make some provision for his wife, by extending to her the\r\nannuity that had been accorded to him.  They gave, says his most\r\ndevoted biographer, no more heed to his dying entreaties than they\r\nwould have given to the whine of a self-convicted beggar.  Yet surely\r\nHastings had deserved well of the East India Company.  His faults had\r\nbeen committed in their service and had given them, not himself, wealth\r\nand power.  But England is not always grateful to her servants.  It is\r\nnot wonderful, says Sir Alfred Lyall, that Hastings's application\r\nfailed entirely, \"remembering that even Lord Nelson's last testamentary\r\nappeal on behalf of a woman--'the only favor I ask of my King and my\r\ncountry at the moment when I am going to fight their battle'--had been\r\nrejected and utterly disregarded.\"  Mrs. Hastings survived her husband\r\nfor some years, and was over ninety years of age when she died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{290}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGE OF THINGS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1789--The political condition of France]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the American republic meant something more for\r\nEngland than the loss of her fairest colonies, and meant much more for\r\nEurope than the establishment of a new form of government in the New\r\nWorld.  While the United States were acclaiming Washington as their first\r\nPresident and rejoicing over the excellence of their carefully framed\r\nConstitution, the principles which had elected the one and had created\r\nthe other were working elsewhere to unexpected and mighty issues.  French\r\ngentlemen of rank and fortune, fired by a philosophic admiration for\r\nliberty, had fought and fought well for the American colonists.  When the\r\nrevolt had become a revolution, and the revolution a triumph, the French\r\ngentlemen went back to France with their hearts full of love and their\r\nlips loud in praise for the young republic and its simple, splendid\r\ncitizens.  The doctrines of liberty and equality, which had been so dear\r\nto the Philosophers and the Encyclopaedists, were now being practically\r\napplied across the Atlantic, and the growth of their success was watched\r\nby the eager eyes of the wisest and the unwisest thinkers in France.\r\nWithin five years from the time when the American army was disbanded\r\nFrench political philosophy found itself making astonishing strides\r\ntowards the realization of its cherished ideals.  It had long felt the\r\nneed of some change in the system of government that had prevailed in\r\nFrance, but its desires had seemed dim as dreams until the success of a\r\nhandful of rebellious colonists in a distant country had made the spirit\r\nof democracy an immediate force in the life and the thought of the world.\r\nUndoubtedly the condition of France was bad.  {291} The feudal system, or\r\nwhat was left of the feudal system, worn out, degraded, and corrupt, was\r\nrapidly reducing France to financial, physical, and political ruin.  It\r\nis no part of the business of this history to dwell upon the conditions\r\nprevailing in France towards the close of the eighteenth century,\r\nconditions which prevailed in varying degree over the most part of\r\nEurope.  Great French financiers like Turgot, great French thinkers like\r\nVoltaire and Rousseau and the company of the \"Encyclopaedia,\" had been\r\nkeenly conscious of the corroding evils in the whole system of French\r\npolitical and social life, and had labored directly and indirectly to\r\ndiminish them.  Keen-eyed observers from abroad, men of the world like\r\nChesterfield, philosophers like Arthur Young, had at different epochs\r\nobserved the symptoms of social disease and prognosticated the nature of\r\nits progress.  The France of that day has been likened to a pyramid with\r\nthe sovereign for its apex, with the nobility, a remnant of antique\r\nfeudalism, for its next tier, with the wealthy and influential Church for\r\nthe next, and below these the vast unrecognized bulk of the pyramid, the\r\nunprivileged masses who were the people of France.  In the hands of the\r\nfew who had the happiness to be \"born,\" or who otherwise belonged to the\r\nprivileged orders, lay all the power, all the authority which for the\r\nmost part they misused or abused.  It has been said with truth that the\r\nman who did not belong to the privileged orders had scarcely any more\r\ninfluence upon the laws which bound him and which ground him than if he\r\nlived in Mars or Saturn instead of in Picardy or Franche Comté.  Such a\r\nsystem of government, which could only have been found tolerable if it\r\nhad been swayed by a brotherhood of saints and sages, was, as a matter of\r\nfact, worked in the worst manner possible and for the worst purposes.\r\nThe conditions under which the vast mass of the French people lived,\r\nstruggled, suffered, and died were so cruel that it is hard indeed to\r\nbelieve them compatible with the high degree of civilization which, in\r\nother respects, France had reached.  A merciless and most comprehensive\r\nprocess of taxation squeezed life and hope out of the French nation {292}\r\nfor the benefit of a nobility whose corruption was only rivalled by its\r\nworthlessness and an ecclesiasticism that had forgotten the Sermon on the\r\nMount and the way to Calvary.\r\n\r\nBut if the condition of France was bad it contained the germs of\r\nimprovement.  A greater freedom of thought, a greater freedom of speech\r\nwere beginning, very gradually, to assert themselves and to make their\r\ninfluence felt.  Philosophical speculation on sorrow and suffering turned\r\nthe minds of men to thoughts of how that sorrow might be stanched and\r\nthat suffering abated.  The slowly rising tide of thought was blown into\r\nan angry sea by a wind from the west, and in a little while a scarcely\r\nsuspected storm became a hurricane that swept into a common ruin\r\neverything that opposed its fury.  England had long been looked up to by\r\nFrench reformers as the pattern for the changes they desired to see\r\nbrought about in their own country.  The moderation and equality of its\r\nlaws, as compared with those of France, the facilities of utterance\r\nafforded to the popular voice, made it seem a veritable Utopia to eyes\r\ndimmed by the mist of French feudality.  But now another and a greater\r\nEngland had arisen in the New World.  Across the Atlantic the descendants\r\nof the men who had overthrown a dynasty and beheaded a king had shaken\r\nthemselves free from forms of oppression that seemed mild indeed to\r\nFrenchmen, and had proclaimed themselves the champions of theories of\r\nsocial liberty and political freedom which had been dreamed of by French\r\nphilosophers but had never yet been put into practice.  Rebellious\r\nAmerica had fired the enthusiasm of gallant French adventurers;\r\nsuccessful, independent America animated the hopes and spurred the\r\nimaginations of those whose eyes turned in longing admiration from the\r\nseasoned constitution of monarchical England to the as yet green\r\nconstitution of republican America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1789--Revival of the States-General in France]\r\n\r\nThose Englishmen whose tastes and sympathies induced them to keep in\r\ntouch with political opinion in France, and to watch with interest the\r\nspread of ideas which they themselves held dear, noted with approval many\r\nremarkable {293} signs of activity across the Channel.  While the strain\r\nupon the false financial system of France had become so great that the\r\nattempt to stop the hole in the money chest broke the spirit of finance\r\nminister after finance minister, a feeling in favor of some change in the\r\nsystem that made such catastrophes possible seemed to be on the increase\r\nin educated and even in aristocratic circles.  Many Englishmen of that\r\nday knew France, or at least Paris, fairly well.  If Pitt had paid the\r\nFrench capital but a single visit, Fox was intimately acquainted with it,\r\nand Walpole was almost as familiar with a superficial Paris as he was\r\nwith a superficial London.  Dr. Johnson, not very long before the time of\r\nwhich we write, had visited Paris with his friends the Thrales, and had\r\nmade the acquaintance of a brewer named Santerre.  Arthur Young travelled\r\nin France as he travelled in England and in Ireland.  On the other hand,\r\nFrenchmen who were soon to be conspicuous advocates of change were not\r\nunknown on the English side of the Channel.  Mirabeau was known in\r\nLondon--not too favorably--and the cousin of the French King, the Duke de\r\nChartres, afterwards Duke of Orleans, had moved in London society and was\r\nto move there again.  So when educated Englishmen heard that Lafayette\r\nhad demanded the revival of the States-General, unused and almost\r\nforgotten these two centuries, they knew that the friend of Washington\r\nwas not likely to ask for impossibilities.  When the Duke of Orleans set\r\nhimself openly in opposition to the King, his cousin, they recognized a\r\nsignificance in the act, and when Mirabeau asserted himself as the\r\nchampion of a growing agitation in favor of an oppressed and\r\nunrepresented people they remembered the big, vehement man who had passed\r\nso much of his life in prisons and had played the spy upon the Prussian\r\nCourt.  Gradually prepared for some change in the administrative system\r\nof France, they were not prepared for the rapid succession of changes\r\nthat followed upon the formal convocation of the States-General in the\r\nspring of 1789.\r\n\r\nThe States-General was the nearest approach to a representative\r\nparliamentary system that was known to France.  {294} But the\r\nStates-General had not been summoned to aid the deliberations of a French\r\nmonarch in the course of many reigns.  France had lived under what was\r\npractically a despotism untempered by an expression of organized public\r\nopinion for several generations.  It was so long since the States-General\r\nhad been convoked that the very forms and ceremonies incidental to or\r\nessential to its convocation had passed out of living memory, and had to\r\nbe painfully ascertained by much groping after authority and precedent.\r\nIn the end, however, authority and precedent were ascertained, and the\r\nStates-General, composed of representatives of the three estates of the\r\nrealm--the Church, the Nobility, and the People--met with much ceremony\r\nat Versailles.  They were called together for the ostensible purpose of\r\ndealing with the financial difficulties that threatened to make the\r\ncountry bankrupt.  But it was soon clear that they, or at least the\r\nmajority of their members, intended to accomplish much more than that.\r\nThe news that travelled slowly in those days from the capital of France\r\nto the capital of England grew to be interesting and important with an\r\ninterest and an importance that were not to cease in steady activity for\r\nmore than a quarter of a century.  Event followed event with startling\r\nrapidity.  The members of the Third Estate severed themselves from the\r\nChurch and the Nobility, met in the Tennis Court in Versailles, and\r\ndeclared themselves a National Assembly.  The people of Paris, profoundly\r\nagitated, and fearing that the King intended to suppress the insurgent\r\nNational Assembly by force, broke out into riots, which culminated in an\r\nattack upon the famous and detested prison in the Faubourg St. Antoine,\r\nthe Bastille.  The Bastille had not for many years been a serious\r\ninstrument of oppression, but its record was an evil record, and it\r\nrepresented in the eyes of the people of Paris all that was most detested\r\nand most detestable in the old order.  The Bastille was captured; its few\r\nprisoners were borne in triumph through the streets, while its commander,\r\nDe Launay, was decapitated and his head carried about on the point of a\r\npike.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1789--The French Revolution]\r\n\r\nIf the King of France had been a different man from {295} Louis the\r\nSixteenth he might have faced the rising storm with some hope of success.\r\nBut he could do nothing, would do nothing.  His advisers, his intimates,\r\nhis kinsmen, his captains, despairing at his vacillation and fearing that\r\nthey would be abandoned to the fury of insurgent Paris, fled for their\r\nlives from a country that seemed to them as if possessed by a devil.  The\r\ncountry was possessed, possessed by the spirit of revolution.  After ages\r\nof injustice a chance had come for the oppressed, and the oppressed had\r\nseized their chance and misused it, as the long oppressed always misuse\r\nsudden power.  Rebellious Paris marched upon Versailles, camped outside\r\nthe King's palace; broke in the night time into the King's palace,\r\nslaying and seeking to slay.  The Royal Family were rescued, if rescue it\r\ncan be called, by the interposition of Lafayette.  They were carried in\r\ntriumph to Paris.  Still nominally sovereign, they were practically\r\nprisoners in their palace of the Tuileries.  Europe looked on in\r\nastonishment at the unexpected outbreak.  In England at first the leaders\r\nof liberal opinion applauded what they believed to be the dawn of a new\r\nand glorious era of political freedom.  Fox hailed in a rapture of\r\nexultation the fall of the Bastille.  The Duke of Dorset, the English\r\nambassador to France, saluted the accomplishment of the greatest\r\nrevolution recorded by history.  Eager young men, nameless then but yet\r\nto be famous, apostrophised the dawn of liberty.  \"Bliss was it in that\r\ndawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven,\" Wordsworth wrote,\r\nwith a wistful regret, fifteen years after the Bastille had fallen,\r\nrecalling with a kind of tragic irony the emotions of that hour and\r\ncontrasting them with his thoughts on the events that had followed\r\nthrough half a generation.  All over England strenuous politicians,\r\ncatching the contagion of excitement from excited France, formulated\r\ntheir sympathy with the Revolution in ardent, eloquent addresses, formed\r\nthemselves into clubs to propagate the principles that were making France\r\nfree and illustrious, and sent delegates speeding across the Channel to\r\nconvey to a confident, constitution-making National Assembly the {296}\r\nassurance that the best hearts and the wisest brains in England pulsed\r\nand moved in unison with their desires.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1790--Burke and the French Revolution]\r\n\r\nSuch assurances were inaccurate and misleading.  There was one man in\r\nEngland the goodness of whose heart, the wisdom of whose brain could\r\nscarcely be questioned, whose censure in England, and not in England\r\nalone, was more serious than the applause of a whole theatre of others.\r\nAt a moment when all who represented liberal thought in politics, all who\r\nsome ten years earlier had sympathized with the American colonists, were\r\nshowing a like sympathy for the insurgent people of France, Edmund Burke\r\nmade himself conspicuous by the vehemence and the vigor of his opposition\r\nto a movement which commanded the admiration of his most intimate friends\r\nand closest political allies.  While the Revolution was still almost in\r\nits infancy, while Sheridan and Fox vied with each other in the warmth of\r\ntheir applause, Burke set himself to preach a crusade against the\r\nRevolution with all the unrestrained ardor of his uncompromising nature.\r\nNo words of Fox or of Sheridan, no resolution of clubs, no delegated\r\nenthusiasm had anything like the same effect in aiding, that Burke's\r\nfamous pamphlet had in injuring the French Revolution, in the eyes not\r\nmerely of the mass of the English people, but in the eyes of a very great\r\nnumber of people in the countries of Europe.  People whose business it\r\nwas to be king, to use the famous phrase of a then reigning prince,\r\nreadily welcomed Burke's \"Reflexions on the French Revolution,\" which was\r\nsoon disseminated all over the Continent in a French translation.\r\nNaturally enough it appealed to the Emperor of Germany, to the Empress\r\nCatherine of Russia, to the French princes sheltering in Coblentz and\r\nboasting of the revenge they would take on the Revolution when the King\r\nshould enjoy his own again.  Naturally enough it appealed to George the\r\nThird as a book which every gentleman ought to read.  Kings and princes\r\neverywhere, who felt that at any moment their own thrones might begin to\r\nrock unsteadily beneath them, inevitably applauded the unexpected\r\nassistance of the greatest orator and thinker of his age.\r\n\r\n{297}\r\n\r\nSuch applause alone would not have made Burke's pamphlet the formidable\r\nweapon that it proved to be in the hands of reaction, or have brought\r\nabout the grave results that may be directly attributed to Burke's pen.\r\nThe words of Burke created, the breath of Burke fanned, a public opinion\r\nin England and abroad that was in direct antagonism to everything that\r\nwas meant by those who formed and who guided or were driven by the\r\nRevolution.  It would be hard to find a parallel in history for the\r\ninfluence thus exerted by a single man against so great a force.  All the\r\nconservatism of Burke's nature--the conservatism that led him to regard\r\nthe English Parliamentary system of his day as well-nigh ideally perfect,\r\nand that prompted him to resist so steadily and so successfully Pitt's\r\nproposals of Parliamentary reform--concentrated itself against what he\r\nbelieved to be the spirit of anarchy newly arisen in France.  The\r\nRevolution was but a year old, and was as yet unstained by the worst\r\nexcesses of the Terror, when Burke launched his bolt, shouted his\r\nbattle-cry, and animated Europe to arms.  It must be admitted that many\r\nof the evils which Burke prophesied in his review of the nascent\r\nrevolution were the stigmas of its prime.  From the premises he beheld he\r\ndrew clear and definite conclusions, which were only too unhappily\r\nverified as the tide of revolution flowed.  But it must also be\r\nremembered that Burke was himself in no small measure the cause of the\r\nrealization of his own dark and tragic prognostications.  Burke's\r\narguments, Burke's eloquence, Burke's splendid ability were among the\r\nmost potent factors in animating the hopes of the refugee princes, of\r\ninspiriting their allies, and of forming that ill-advised and disastrous\r\ncoalition of the Powers against France which Danton answered with the\r\nhead of a king.  It was the genius of Burke that stemmed the sympathy\r\nbetween England and a nation struggling to be free; it was the genius of\r\nBurke that fostered the spirit of animosity to France which began with\r\nthe march upon Paris, and which ended after the disastrous defeats of the\r\ninvaders, the deaths of the King and Queen, and all the agonies of the\r\nTerror, in {298} creating for England, in common with Europe at large,\r\nthe most formidable enemy that she had ever known.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Burke and Burke's melancholy vaticinations the course of the\r\nRevolution in France seemed at first to most liberal-minded Englishmen to\r\nmove along reasonable lines and to confine itself within the bounds of\r\nmoderation.  The excesses and outrages that followed immediately upon the\r\nfirst upheaval, the murders of Foulon and Berthier in Paris, the peasant\r\nwar upon the castles, were regarded as the unavoidable, deplorable\r\nebullitions of a long dormant force which, under the guidance of capable\r\nand honorable men, would be directed henceforward solely to the\r\nestablishment of a stable and popular system of government.  The men who\r\nwere, or who seemed to be, at the head of affairs in France had names\r\nthat for the most part commended themselves to such Englishmen as had\r\nanything more than a superficial knowledge of the country.  The fame of\r\nLafayette, the hero of the American war, seemed to answer for the conduct\r\nof the army.  In Bailly, the astronomer whom unhappy chance had made\r\nMayor of Paris, constitutionalism recognized a man after its own heart.\r\nThe majority of the members of the National Assembly seemed to be\r\ngloriously occupied in evolving out of the chaos of the old order a new\r\nand entirely admirable framework of laws modelled boldly after the\r\nEnglish pattern.  Most English observers thought, in opposition to Burke,\r\nwhat the majority of the members of the National Assembly themselves\r\nthought, that the Revolution was an accomplished fact, a concluded page\r\nof history, brought about not indeed bloodlessly, but still, on the\r\nwhole, with comparatively slight shedding of blood, considering the\r\ndifficulty and the greatness of the accomplished thing.  The practical\r\nimprisonment of the King and Queen within the walls of Paris, within the\r\nwalls of the Tuileries, seemed no great hardship in the eyes of the\r\nEnglishmen who sympathized with the aims of those of the French\r\nrevolutionaries with whom they were acquainted.  The French King himself\r\nseemed to be reconciled to his lot, to have joined himself frankly and\r\n{299} freely enough to the party of progress within his dominions, and to\r\nbe as loyally eager to accept the new constitution which the National\r\nAssembly was busy framing as the most ardent patriot among its members.\r\nEven the flight of the Royal Family, the attempted flight that began with\r\nsuch laborious pomp at Paris to end in such pitiful disaster at Varennes,\r\nthe flight that condemned the King and Queen to a restraint far more\r\nrigorous than before, did not greatly disturb British equanimity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1791--Burke and the coalition against France]\r\n\r\nTo the mind of Burke, however, his prophecies were already justifying\r\nthemselves.  He could see nothing in the Revolution but its errors, and\r\nhe hailed the coalition of Europe against France as a league of light\r\nagainst the powers of darkness.  He broke away furiously from his friends\r\nand allies of so many great political battles.  He could not understand,\r\nhe could not bear to realize that men who had struggled with him to\r\nchampion the rights of the American colonists, and to punish the offences\r\nof Warren Hastings, should now be either avowed sympathizers with or\r\nindifferent spectators of the events that were passing in France.  He had\r\nloved Charles Fox greatly ever since Fox had shaken off the traditions of\r\nToryism and become the most conspicuous champion of liberal ideas in\r\nEngland.  But he could not and would not forgive him for his attitude\r\ntowards the French Revolution and the French Revolutionists.  Burke saw\r\nnothing but evil in, thought nothing but evil could come of, what was\r\nhappening in France, and he feared disasters for his own country if it\r\nbecame impregnated with the poison of the revolutionary doctrine.  That\r\nFox should in any way advocate that doctrine made him in Burke's eyes an\r\nenemy of England, and not merely of England but of the whole human race.\r\nThere was no middle way with Burke.  Those who were not with him were\r\nagainst him, not merely as a politician, but as a man.  To the day of his\r\ndeath, in 1797, he hated the Revolution and denied his friendship to\r\nthose who expressed anything less than execration for its principles and\r\nits makers.  Although it is always easy to exaggerate the influence that\r\nany single spirit may have upon a movement embracing {300} many\r\nnationalities and many different orders of mind, it would be difficult to\r\noverestimate the effect of Burke's words and Burke's actions in animating\r\nthe coalition of monarchical Europe against insurgent France.  And upon a\r\nresponsibility for the intervention of other States in the affairs of\r\nFrance depends also a proportionate degree of responsibility for the\r\nresults of that intervention.  Burke was to see all the horrors he had so\r\neloquently anticipated realized as the direct consequence of the invasion\r\nof France by the allied armies.  The French people in the very hour in\r\nwhich they believed their cherished revolution to be an accomplished fact\r\nsaw it menaced by the formidable league which proposed to bring the\r\nKing's brothers back in triumph from Coblentz, and which threatened, in\r\nthe extraordinary language to which Brunswick put his name, to blot Paris\r\nfrom the map of Europe if any injury were done to the King, who had\r\nalready formally accepted the constitution that the Revolution had\r\ncreated.  Paris went mad with fear and rage.  The September massacres,\r\nthe attacks upon the Tuileries, the proclaimed republicanism of the\r\nConvention, the rise of the men of the Mountain, Marat, Danton, and\r\nRobespierre, the execution first of the King and then of the Queen, the\r\ndominion of the guillotine and the Reign of Terror, were the direct\r\nresults of a coalition whose only excuse would have been its complete\r\nsuccess.  The coalition proved to be an absolute failure.  To the cry\r\nthat the country was in danger ragged legions of desperate men rushed to\r\nthe frontiers, and, to the astonishment of the world, proved more than a\r\nmatch for the armies that were sent against them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1789-92--Pitt and the French Revolution]\r\n\r\nPitt was not himself eager to see England dragged into the European\r\nquarrel with France.  But it was not easy for a minister who loved\r\npopularity, and who very sincerely believed his presence at the head of\r\naffairs to be essential to the welfare of the State, to avoid being\r\ninvolved in the controversy.  The result of the unsuccessful coalition\r\nhad been to increase the crimes that marked the course of the French\r\nRevolution, and seemingly to justify the fierce indignation of Burke.\r\nThe country that had {301} been profoundly impressed by Burke's eloquence\r\nwas profoundly shocked by the horrors that lost nothing of their\r\nmagnitude in the reports that crossed the Channel.  The country was\r\nflooded with fugitives from France, emigrants who presented in themselves\r\nmoving pictures of the sufferings of those who were opposed to the\r\nRevolution, and who were not slow to express their sense of the ruin that\r\nhad fallen upon their country.  King George's native shrewdness and\r\nnative narrowness of mind had made him from the first an active opponent\r\nof the Revolution.  He declared that if a stop were not put to French\r\nprinciples there would not be a king left in Europe in a few years.  To\r\nhim, whose business above all things it had been to be king, the prospect\r\nwas unlovely and alarming.  The fear that he felt for his office was\r\nshared in varying degree by all those who felt that they would have much\r\nto lose if the example set by France came to be followed in England.  The\r\nChurch and the aristocracy, with all wealthy and vested interests, were\r\nnaturally ranked to resist by all means the spread of the new doctrines.\r\nThere were a few noblemen who, like Lord Stanhope and Lord Lauderdale,\r\nprofessed themselves to be champions of the French Revolution; there were\r\nsome statesmen among the Opposition who were either sympathizers with the\r\nRevolution or asserters of the doctrine that it was no part of England's\r\nduty to interfere with the way in which another nation chose to govern\r\nherself.  But the strength of public opinion was against these, as it was\r\nagainst the minister who was as eager as any Englishman living to remain\r\non good terms with France.\r\n\r\nPitt from the first had looked with a favorable eye upon the changes that\r\nwere taking place across the Channel.  To maintain a friendship with\r\nFrance was a radical part of his policy.  Friendship with France was\r\nessential in his mind in order to combat the aggrandizement of Russia and\r\nPrussia, and friendship with France seemed more possible under an\r\nenlightened constitution than under a despotic king.  While Burke, who\r\ncould only make the House of Commons smile and sneer by his denunciations\r\n{302} of Jacobin intrigues and his display of Jacobin daggers, was\r\nplaying on the heart-strings of England and reviving all the old\r\nhostility to France, Pitt pursued as long as he was allowed to pursue it\r\na policy of absolute neutrality.  But he was not long allowed to pursue\r\nthat policy, although he reaped some reward for it in a proof that the\r\nFrench Government appreciated his intentions and shared his desire for\r\nfriendship.  An English settlement at Nootka Sound, in Vancouver Island,\r\nhad been interfered with by Spain.  England was ready to assert her\r\nrights in arms.  Spain appealed to France for her aid by the terms of the\r\nFamily Compact.  The French King and the French Ministers were willing\r\nenough to engage in a war with England, in the hope of diverting the\r\ncourse and weakening the power of the Revolution.  But the National\r\nAssembly, after a long and angry struggle, took away from the King the\r\nold right to declare war, save with the consent of the National Assembly,\r\nwhich consent the National Assembly, in that particular crisis, was\r\ndecided not to give.  Pitt was delighted at this proof of the friendly\r\nspirit of the French people and the advantage of his principle of\r\nneutrality.  But he was not able to act upon that principle.  The forces\r\nbrought against him were too many and too potent for him to resist.  From\r\nthe King on the throne to the mob in the streets, who sacked the houses\r\nof citizens known to be in sympathy with the Revolution, the English\r\npeople as a whole were against him.  The people who sympathized with the\r\nRevolution, who made speeches for it in Westminster and formed\r\nConstitutional Clubs which framed addresses of friendship to France, were\r\nbut a handful in the House of Commons, were but a handful in the whole\r\ncountry.  Their existence dazzled and deluded the French Revolutionists\r\ninto the belief that the heart of England was with them at a time when\r\nevery feeling of self-interest and of sentiment in England was against\r\nthem.  Pitt clung desperately to peace.  He thought, what the Opposition\r\nthought then and for long years later, that it was wisest to leave France\r\nto settle her internal affairs and her form of government in her own way.\r\nWhen England {303} no longer had an ambassador at the French capital Pitt\r\nadhered doggedly, tenaciously, to a peace policy; persisted in preserving\r\nthe neutrality of Holland; was ready, were it only possible, only\r\npermitted to him, to recognize the new Republic.  But even if the\r\nexecution of Louis the Sixteenth had not roused irresistible indignation\r\nin England the action of the new Republic made the prolongation of peace\r\nan impossibility.  When, in the winter of 1792, the Convention made the\r\nfamous offer of its aid in arms to all peoples eager to be free, it must\r\nhave been plain to Pitt that, with France in that temper and England\r\ntempest-tossed between hatred of the Revolution and fear lest its\r\ntheories were being insidiously fostered in her own confines, the\r\npreservation of peace was a dream.  The dream was finally dissipated when\r\nFrance made ready to attack Holland and, rejecting all possible\r\nnegotiations, declared war in the early days of 1793.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1793--France declares war against Holland]\r\n\r\nAt first the war went ill with France, and if the German Powers had\r\nco-operated earnestly and honestly with England it is at least within the\r\nlimits of possibility that Paris might have been occupied and the\r\nRevolution for the time retarded.  France seemed to be circled by foes;\r\nher enemies abroad were aided by civil war at home.  La Vendée was in\r\nRoyalist revolt; Marseilles and Lyons rose against the tyranny of Paris;\r\nToulon, turning against the Republic, welcomed an English fleet.  For a\r\nmoment the arms of England and the aims of the Allies seemed to have\r\ntriumphed.  But the passionate determination of the French popular\r\nleaders and the mass of the French people to save the Revolution seemed\r\nto inspire them with a heroism that grew in proportion to the threatened\r\ndanger.  Her armies were swollen with enthusiastic recruits.  Her\r\ninternal revolts were coped with and crushed with savage severity.  Loyal\r\nLa Vendée was beaten.  The rebellious towns of Lyons and Marseilles\r\nalmost ceased to exist under the merciless repression of their\r\nconquerors.  Many of the allied armies were defeated, while those of the\r\ntwo German Powers for their own selfish ends played the game of\r\nrevolutionary France by abstaining from any serious effort to {304}\r\nadvance into the country.  Germany and Austria were confident that they\r\ncould whenever they pleased crush revolutionary France, and they\r\npreferred to postpone the process, in order to occupy themselves in a new\r\npartition of Poland, which they could scarcely have carried out if the\r\nFrench monarchy had been restored.  If there was nothing to justify the\r\nconduct of the two German Powers, there was much to warrant their\r\nconfidence in their own strength when they judged that the time had come\r\nfor them to exert it.  They counted upon the known when they measured\r\ntheir forces with those of revolutionary France; they could not count\r\nupon the unknown quantity which was to disturb all their calculations.\r\nThe unknown quantity asserted itself just at the moment when France, in\r\nspite of some successes, seemed to be deeply wounded by the loss of\r\nToulon.\r\n\r\nWith the great port of Toulon in their hands the adversaries of France\r\nmight well believe that a serious blow had been struck at her strength,\r\nand that the spirit which so long had defied them might yet be broken.\r\nBut the success which had seemed to menace France so gravely proved to be\r\nbut the point of departure for a new era of French glory.  The occupation\r\nof Toulon is forever memorable, because it gave an opportunity to a young\r\nlieutenant of artillery in the French service, quite obscure in that\r\nservice and wholly unknown outside of it.  The quick intelligence of this\r\nyoung soldier perceived that the seizure of a certain promontory left\r\nunguarded by the invaders would place Toulon and those who had held it at\r\nthe mercy of the French cannon.  The suggestion was acted upon; was\r\nentirely successful; the English admiral was obliged to retire with all\r\nhis fleet, and Toulon was once again a French citadel garrisoned by\r\nFrench soldiers.  But the importance of the event, for France and the\r\nworld lay not in the capture but in the captor.  Though Barras, confident\r\nin his dominion over the Directory, might sneer at the young adventurer\r\nfrom Corsica and minimize his share in a success that had suddenly made\r\nhim conspicuous, the name of Bonaparte then for the first time took its\r\n{305} place in the history of Europe.  The youth whose military genius\r\nhad enabled him to see and to seize upon the fatal weakness in a\r\nwell-defended city was destined to prove the greatest soldier France had\r\never known, the greatest as well as the most implacable enemy England had\r\never to reckon with, and one of the greatest conquerors that ever\r\nfollowed the star of conquest across the war-convulsed earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1793--Napoleon Bonaparte]\r\n\r\nThis is the story of England, not the story of France, and Napoleon was\r\nat his best and worst rather an influence upon than an integral part of\r\nEnglish history.  It must be enough to say here that he is assumed to\r\nhave been born in Ajaccio, in Corsica, in 1769; that when he was ten\r\nyears old he tried to become French rather than Italian--a feat which he\r\nnever successfully accomplished--by entering the military school of\r\nBrienne; that he served Louis the Sixteenth with indifference and the\r\nRevolution with an ambition that was often baffled, and that he struck\r\nthe first of his many strokes at England when he won Toulon for France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{306}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\n\"NINETY-EIGHT.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1798--Irish Catholic disabilities]\r\n\r\nEngland was not concerned merely with the successes of France upon the\r\nContinent, with the French power of resisting invasion and preserving\r\nits capital and its constitution.  The time was at hand when England\r\nwas to take the French Republic into consideration as a more active\r\nenemy, whose enmity might take effect and be a very serious menace at\r\nher own doors.  The breath of the French Revolution was to Great\r\nBritain like that of a sudden storm which sweeps round some stately\r\nmansion and finds out all its weak places and shatters some of its\r\noutlying buildings, although it cannot unroof its firmest towers or\r\ndisturb its foundations.  The weakest spot in Great Britain, and indeed\r\nwe might almost say in the whole British Empire, was the kingdom of\r\nIreland.  Ireland had for long been in a state of what might almost be\r\ncalled chronic rebellion against the rule of England.  England's\r\nenemies had always been regarded as Ireland's friends by the Irishmen\r\nwho claimed especially to represent the national aspirations of their\r\ncountry.  This is a fact which cannot be made too clear to the minds of\r\nEnglishmen even at the present day, for the simple reason that no one\r\nwho is capable of forming a rational idea on the subject can doubt that\r\nwhere a government is persistently hated that government must have done\r\nmuch to deserve the hate.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to undertake a survey of the many grievances\r\nof which Ireland complained under the rule of Great Britain.  One\r\ngrievance which was especially felt during the reign of George the\r\nThird came from the persistent refusal of the Hanoverian Sovereign to\r\nlisten {307} to any proposals for the relief of the Roman Catholics\r\nfrom the civil and religious disabilities under which they suffered.\r\nThe Catholics constituted five-sixths of the whole population of\r\nIreland, and up to the time of the War of Independence in America no\r\nCatholic in Great Britain or Ireland could sit in Parliament, or vote\r\nfor the election of a member of Parliament, or act as a barrister or\r\nsolicitor, or sit on a bench of magistrates or on a grand jury, or hold\r\nland, or obtain legal security for a loan.  No doubt the state of the\r\npenal laws as they then existed was mitigated when compared with that\r\nwhich had prevailed but a short time before, when an ordinary Catholic\r\nhad hardly any right to do more than live in Ireland, and a Catholic\r\npriest had not even a legal right to live there.  But up to the time\r\nwhen the growing principles of liberty manifested themselves in the\r\noverthrow of the feudal system in France the Catholics in Great Britain\r\nand Ireland were practically excluded from any approach to civil or\r\nreligious liberty.  Ireland had a Parliament, but it was a Parliament\r\nof Protestants, elected by Protestants, and it was in fact a mere\r\ndepartment of the King's Administration.  The American War of\r\nIndependence suddenly awakened wild hopes in the breasts of all\r\noppressed nationalities, and the Irish Catholic population was among\r\nthe first to be quickened by the new life and the new hope.  The\r\nnational idea was not, however, at first for a separation from England.\r\nIreland was then for the most part under the leadership of Henry\r\nGrattan, a patriot, statesman, and orator--an orator whom Charles James\r\nFox described as the \"Irish Demosthenes,\" and whom Byron glorified as\r\n\"with all that Demosthenes wanted endued, and his rival and victor in\r\nall he possessed.\"\r\n\r\nGrattan's purpose was not separation from England or the setting up of\r\nan independent republic.  An Ireland enjoying religious equality for\r\nall denominations and possessing a Parliament thoroughly independent of\r\nthat sitting at Westminster would have satisfied all his patriotic\r\nambition.  In fact, what Grattan would have desired for Ireland is\r\nexactly such a system as is now possessed by one {308} of the provinces\r\nof Canada or Australia.  When the alliance between France and\r\nindependent America began to threaten Great Britain, and the English\r\nGovernment practically acknowledged its inability to provide for the\r\ndefence of Ireland, Henry Grattan, with other Irish patriots of equal\r\nsincerity, and some of them of even higher social rank, started the\r\nIrish Volunteer movement, to be a bulwark of the country in case of\r\nforeign invasion.  When the Irish patriots found themselves at the head\r\nof an army of disciplined volunteers they naturally claimed that the\r\ncountry which was able to defend herself should be allowed also an\r\nindependent Parliament with which to make her domestic laws.  They\r\nobtained their end, at least for the moment, and at least to all\r\noutward appearance, and Grattan was enabled to declare that for the\r\nfirst time he addressed a free Parliament in Ireland and to invoke the\r\nspirit of Swift to rejoice over the event.  Catholic emancipation,\r\nhowever, had not yet been secured, although Grattan and those who\r\nworked with him did their best to carry it through the Parliament in\r\nDublin.  The obstinacy of King George still prevailed against every\r\neffort made by the more enlightened of his ministers.  Pitt was in his\r\nbrain and heart a friend of Catholic emancipation, but he had at last\r\ngiven way to the King's angry and bitter protests and complaints, and\r\nhad made up his mind never again to trouble his Sovereign with futile\r\nrecommendations.  It so happened that a new Viceroy sent over to\r\nIreland in 1794, Earl Fitzwilliam, became impressed with a sense of the\r\njustice of the claims for Catholic emancipation, and therefore gave\r\nspontaneous and honorable encouragement o the hopes of the Irish\r\nleaders.  The result was that after three months' tenure of office he\r\nwas suddenly recalled, and the expectations of the Irish leaders and\r\nthe Irish people were cruelly disappointed.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment it must have been clear to any keen observer in\r\nIreland that the influence of Grattan and his friends could no longer\r\ncontrol the action of Irish nationalists in general, and that the\r\npolicy of Grattan would no longer satisfy the popular demands of\r\nIreland.  Short {309} as had been the Irish independent Parliament's\r\nterm of existence, it had been long enough to satisfy most Irishmen\r\nthat the control of the King's accepted advisers was almost as absolute\r\nin Dublin as in Westminster.  To the younger and more ardent spirits\r\namong the Irish nationalists the setting up of a nominally independent\r\nIrish Parliament had always seemed but a poor achievement when compared\r\nwith the change which their national ambition longed for and which the\r\nconditions of the hour to all appearance conspired to render\r\nattainable.  These young men were now filled with all the passion of\r\nthe French Revolution; they had always longed for the creation of an\r\nindependent Ireland; they insisted that Grattan's compromise had\r\nalready proved a failure, and in France, the enemy of England, they\r\nfound their new hopes for the emancipation of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1791--The United Irishmen]\r\n\r\nThere were among the Irish rebels, as they were soon to declare\r\nthemselves, many men of great abilities and of the purest patriotic\r\npurpose.  Among the very foremost of these were Theobald Wolfe Tone and\r\nLord Edward Fitzgerald.  Both these men, like all the other leaders of\r\nthe movement that followed, were Protestants, as Grattan was.  Wolfe\r\nTone was a young man of great capacity and promise, who began his\r\npublic career as secretary to an association formed for the purpose of\r\neffecting the relief of the Roman Catholics from the civil and\r\nreligious disabilities which oppressed them.  This society, after\r\nawhile, was named the Association of United Irishmen.  The United\r\nIrishmen were at that time only united for the purpose of obtaining\r\nCatholic Emancipation.  The association, as we shall soon see, when it\r\nfailed of its first object became united for other and sterner\r\npurposes.  Wolfe Tone was a young man of a brilliant Byronic sort of\r\nnature.  There was much in his character and temperament which often\r\nrecalls to the mind of the reader the generous impulse, the chivalric\r\nardor, and the impetuous eccentricity of Byron.  Tone, as a youth, was\r\na careless student, or, indeed, to put it more distinctly, he only\r\nstudied the subjects he cared about and was in the habit of neglecting\r\nhis {310} collegiate tasks until the hour arrived when it became\r\nabsolutely necessary that he should master them enough at least to pass\r\nmuster for each emergency.  He was a keen and close student of any\r\nsubject which had genuine interest for him, but such subjects were\r\nseldom those which had anything to do with his academical career.  He\r\nstudied law after a fashion in one of the London Inns of Court, and he\r\nwas called to the Bar in due course; but he had no inclination whatever\r\nfor the business of an advocate, and his mind was soon drawn away from\r\nthe pursuit of a legal career.  He had a taste for literature and a\r\nlonging for travel and military adventure in especial, and for a time\r\nhe lived a pleasant, free and easy, Bohemian sort of life, if we may\r\nuse the term Bohemian in describing days that existed long before Henri\r\nMurger had given the word its modern application.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763-89--Theobald Wolfe Tone]\r\n\r\nOne of the many odd, original ideas which floated like bubbles across\r\nWolfe Tone's fancy was a scheme for founding a sort of military colony\r\nin some island in the South Seas, to act as a check upon the designs\r\nand enterprises of Spain against the British Empire.  Tone took his\r\nidea so seriously that he wrote to William Pitt, the Prime Minister,\r\ndescribing and explaining his project and asking for Government help in\r\norder to make it a reality.  As will be easily understood, Pitt took no\r\nnotice of the proposal, having probably a good many more suggestions\r\nmade to him every day as to the best defences of England than he could\r\npossibly consider in a week.  It is somewhat curious, however, to find\r\nthat Wolfe Tone should at one period of his life have formed the idea\r\nof helping England to defend herself against her enemies.  Some\r\nhistorians have gone so far as to opine that if Pitt could have seen\r\nhis way to take Tone's proposition seriously, and to patronize the\r\nyoung man, the world might never have heard of the insurrection of\r\n\"Ninety-Eight.\"  But no one who gives any fair consideration to the\r\nwhole career and character of Tone can have any doubt that Tone's\r\npassionate patriotism would have made him the champion of his own\r\ncountry, no matter what prospects the patronage of an {311} English\r\nminister might have offered to his ambition.  At the time when Tone was\r\nscheming out his project for the island in the South Seas the leaders\r\nin the national movement in Ireland still believed that the just claims\r\nof their people were destined to receive satisfaction from the wisdom\r\nand justice of the English Sovereign.  When it became apparent that\r\nCatholic Emancipation was not to be obtained through George the Third\r\nand through Pitt, then Wolfe Tone made up his mind that there was no\r\nhope for Ireland but in absolute independence, and that that\r\nindependence was only to be won by the help of Napoleon Bonaparte and\r\nof France.  In the mean time Tone had taken a step which brilliant,\r\ngifted, generous, and impecunious young men usually take at the opening\r\nof their career--he had made a sudden marriage.  Matilda Witherington\r\nwas only sixteen when Tone persuaded her to accept him as her husband\r\nand to share his perilous career.  Romance itself hardly contains any\r\nstory of a marriage more imprudent and yet more richly rewarded by\r\nlove.  Tone adored his young wife and she adored him.  Love came in at\r\ntheir door and, though poverty entered there too, love never flew out\r\nat the window.  The whole story of Wolfe Tone's public career may be\r\nread in the letters which, during their various periods of long\r\nseparation, no difficulties and no dangers ever prevented him from\r\nwriting to his wife.  When he made up his mind to consecrate himself to\r\nthe national cause of Ireland, and, if necessary, to die for it, he set\r\nforth his purpose to his wife, and she never tried to dissuade him from\r\nit.  It is told of her that at one critical period of his fortunes she\r\nconcealed from him the fact that she expected to become a mother, lest\r\nthe knowledge might chill his patriotic enthusiasm or make him unhappy\r\nin his enterprise.\r\n\r\nTone went out to America and got into council with the representative\r\nof the French Republic there; then he returned to Europe, and he\r\nentered into communication with Carnot and with Napoleon Bonaparte.  To\r\nthese and to others he imparted his plans for a naval and military\r\nexpedition from France to approach the coast of Ireland, to {312} land\r\ntroops there, and to make the beginning of a great Irish rebellion,\r\nwhich must distract the attention and exhaust the resources of England\r\nand place her at the feet of all-conquering France.  Tone felt certain\r\nthat if an adequate number of French troops were landed on the western\r\nor southern shore of Ireland the whole mass of the population there\r\nwould rally to the side of the invaders, and England would have to let\r\nIreland go or waste herself in a hopeless struggle.  Tone insisted in\r\nall his arguments and expositions that Ireland must be free and\r\nindependent, and that no idea of conquering and annexing her must enter\r\ninto the minds of the French statesmen and soldiers.  Napoleon and\r\nCarnot approved of Tone's schemes as a whole, but Tone could not help\r\nseeing that Napoleon cared nothing whatever about the independence or\r\nprosperity of Ireland, and only took up with the whole scheme as a\r\nconvenient project for the embarrassment and the distraction of\r\nEngland.  Tone received a commission in the army of the French\r\nRepublic, and became the soul and the inspiration of the policy which\r\nat fitful moments, when his mind was not otherwise employed, Napoleon\r\nwas inclined to carry out on the Irish shores.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1763-98--Lord Edward Fitzgerald]\r\n\r\nLord Edward Fitzgerald was a son of the great ducal house of Leinster.\r\nHe was born in the same year as Wolfe Tone; he was to die in the same\r\nyear.  It was his evil fortune to have to fight for the cause of King\r\nGeorge against the uprising of the patriotic colonists of North\r\nAmerica.  He afterwards became filled with the ideas of the French\r\nRevolution, and got into trouble more than once by expressing his\r\nsentiments too freely while yet he wore the uniform of the British\r\narmy.  In Paris he became acquainted with Thomas Paine and was greatly\r\ntaken with the theories and charmed with the ways of the revolutionary\r\nthinker, and in the company of Paine and congenial associates he took\r\npart in Republican celebrations which became talked of in England and\r\nled to his dismissal from the army.  Lord Edward Fitzgerald had a\r\nstrong love of adventure and exploration, and had contrived to combine\r\nwith his military career in the New {313} World a number of episodes\r\nalmost any one of which might have supplied the materials for a\r\nromance.  He was a man of a thoroughly lovable nature, gallant,\r\nhigh-spirited, generous.  Like Wolfe Tone, he had made a romantic\r\nmarriage.  His wife was the famous Pamela, the beautiful girl who was\r\nward to Madame de Genlis, and commonly believed to be the daughter of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, Philippe Egalité.  Louis Philippe, afterwards King\r\nof France, was one of the witnesses at the marriage ceremony.  Lord\r\nEdward was perfectly happy with his young and beautiful wife until the\r\npolitical events came on which gave the sudden and tragic turn to his\r\nlife.  He was a member of the Irish Parliament for many years, and had\r\non several occasions supported the policy which was advocated by\r\nGrattan.  He too, however, soon made up his mind, as Wolfe Tone had\r\ndone, that there was nothing to be expected from the Sovereign and his\r\nministers, and he became an active member of the Society of United\r\nIrishmen when that association ceased to be a constitutional body and\r\nset its heart on armed rebellion.  Lord Edward went over to France and\r\nworked hard there for the purpose of obtaining armed assistance for the\r\nIrish cause, but he returned to Ireland to work up the rebellious\r\nmovement there while Tone remained in France to influence as well as he\r\ncould the policy of Napoleon and Carnot.\r\n\r\nAmong the other distinguished Irishmen who worked at home or in\r\nFrance--sometimes at home and sometimes in France--to promote the\r\nrebellion were Arthur O'Connor and Thomas Addis Emmet.  Arthur O'Connor\r\ncame of a great Irish family; Thomas Addis Emmet, after the failure of\r\nthe rebellious movement, escaped to the United States and made a great\r\nposition for himself as an advocate in New York.  A younger brother of\r\nThomas Emmet also took part in the organization of \"Ninety-Eight,\" but\r\nthe fate of Robert Emmet will have a place to itself in this chapter of\r\nour history.\r\n\r\nOne fact has to be mentioned, and must be kept constantly in mind when\r\nwe are studying the grim story of \"Ninety-Eight.\"  Every step taken by\r\nthe rebel leaders {314} was almost instantly made known to the English\r\nGovernment.  The spy, the hired informer, was then, as he has always\r\nbeen, in the very thick of the Irish national movement.  Some of the\r\ninformers in \"Ninety-Eight\" were of a different class from that of the\r\nordinary police spy; and it has been made quite certain by subsequent\r\ndiscoveries that Wolfe Tone and Fitzgerald, Arthur O'Connor and the\r\nEmmets were in the closest friendly association with men whom they\r\nbelieved to be as genuine Irish patriots as themselves, but who were\r\nall the time in the pay of Pitt, and were keeping him well informed of\r\nevery plan and project and movement of their leaders.  As political\r\nmorals were then and are perhaps even now, it would be absurd to find\r\nfault with Pitt because he made use of the services of spies and\r\ninformers to get at the plans of a number of men who proposed to invite\r\na foreign enemy of England to invade the Irish shores, and were doing\r\nall they could to secure by armed rebellion the independence of\r\nIreland.  The wonder that will now occur to every reasonable mind is\r\nthat the Irish leaders should have failed to guess that whatever money\r\nwould do would be done by the English Government, as it would have been\r\ndone by any other Government under similar conditions, to get at a\r\nknowledge of their designs and to counteract them.  At all events, it\r\nis quite certain that while Tone and Fitzgerald and their comrades were\r\nplaying their gallant, desperate game, the British Minister was quietly\r\nlooking over their shoulders and studying their cards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1797--A French fleet in Bantry Bay]\r\n\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte, meanwhile, seems to have been but half-hearted\r\nabout the scheme for the invasion of Ireland.  He had many other\r\nschemes in his mind, some of which probably appeared more easy of\r\naccomplishment, and at all events promised a more immediate result than\r\nthe proposed flank attack on the power of England.  It is certain that\r\nWolfe Tone had long intervals of depression and despondency, against\r\nwhich it needed all the buoyancy of his temperament to sustain him.  At\r\nlast a naval expedition was resolved on and despatched.  In the late\r\nDecember of 1796 a small French fleet, with about 14,000 troops {315}\r\non board, under the command of General Hoche, made for the southwestern\r\nshores of Ireland.  Tone was on board one of the war vessels in his\r\ncapacity as a French officer serving under General Hoche.  The weather\r\nproved utterly unfavorable to the expedition.  The war vessels were\r\nconstantly parting company.  The admiral's vessel, together with\r\nseveral others, was lost to sight on the very first night, and the\r\nheart of Tone grew sick as he saw that with every fresh outburst of the\r\ntempest the chances even of effecting a landing grew less and less.\r\nMost of the vessels entered Bantry Bay and lay helplessly at anchor\r\nthere, but there was no landing.  Tone's despondency and powerless rage\r\nas he foresaw the failure of his project might have been still deeper\r\nif he could have known how utterly unprepared the authorities of Dublin\r\nCastle were for any sort of invasion.  Tone had observed already, as\r\nthe expedition made its way from Brest, that they had not seen a single\r\nEnglish vessel of war anywhere on the sea or around the Irish coasts.\r\nBut he could have had no idea of the manner in which the British\r\nGovernment had intrusted the keeping of the island to the protection of\r\nthe winds and of the fates.  A letter written from Dublin by Elizabeth\r\nMoira Hastings, widow of the first Earl of Moira, throws a curious\r\nlight on the state of things which existed among the governing\r\nauthorities at the time of the invasion, and amazingly illustrates the\r\nodd rumors and wild conjectures which were floating about at the time.\r\nWriting to a friend in a different part of Ireland on January 19, 1797,\r\nLady Moira says:\r\n\r\n\"Our escape has been miraculous: the French fleet left Brest . . .\r\nmistook the Durseys for Mizen Head, and therefore did not make their\r\nentrance into Bantry Bay till the 24th, on which very day the storm\r\narose and prevented the greater part of their fleet getting into the\r\nBay, driving the greatest part of them out to sea.  You will observe\r\nthat it was on the 19th Lord Malmesbury had orders to quit Paris.  He\r\nundoubtedly had purchased intelligence at a high price, being duped in\r\nthat inquiry by the manoeuvres of the Directory, and gave false\r\ninformation {316} to England.  Had the French landed on the 18th or\r\n19th, which they might have done, had they not mistaken the Durseys, we\r\nshould have had the French now governing in this metropolis.  All agree\r\nthat there never was an expedition so completely planned, and in some\r\npoints so curiously furnished--the most beautiful ladies of easy virtue\r\nfrom Paris were collected and made a part of the freight.  Hoche's\r\nmistress accompanied him, and his carriage was on board 'La Ville\r\nd'Orient,' taken by the 'Druid.'  The hussars taken on board that\r\nvessel were those who guarded the scaffold at the execution of the\r\nunfortunate Lewis--they are clothed in scarlet jackets trimmed with\r\ngold and fur, and wear each the butcher's steel, on which they whet\r\ntheir knives, to whet their swords with.  It is reported that Hoche and\r\nReilly (one of the admirals) are gone off to America with seven hundred\r\nthousand pounds in specie that was on board their vessel to pay the\r\ntroops.  Others think the vessel has sunk, for neither of these\r\npersonages or the frigate 'La Fraternité,' which they were on board,\r\nhas been seen since they quitted Brest by any of the French vessels.\r\nWhat a fortunate person Mr. Pitt is! and what a benefit is good luck to\r\nits possessor!  The troops are all marching back to their old quarters;\r\nCork and its environs indignant at Government for leaving them again to\r\nthe entire care of Providence. . . .  It is a general belief among all\r\nparties that the French will revisit Ireland, and at no distant\r\nperiod--probably the next dark nights.  If the storms now prevented\r\nthem they have learned how possible the attempt is, and how can such a\r\ncoast be guarded?  There has been much show of spirit and loyalty, and\r\nyet I thank God they did not land!\"\r\n\r\nThe words of Wolfe Tone, taken from his journal, may be accepted as the\r\nepitaph of the first French expedition.  \"It was hard,\" says Tone,\r\n\"after having forced my way thus far, to be obliged to turn back; but\r\nit is my fate, and I must submit. . . .  Well, England has not had such\r\nan escape since the Spanish Armada; and that expedition, like ours, was\r\ndefeated by the weather; the elements fight against us, and courage is\r\nof no avail.\"\r\n\r\n{317}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1797--The French and Dutch to aid Ireland]\r\n\r\nThe French did return, as Lady Moira had predicted.  They returned more\r\nthan once, but there was a long interval between the first and the\r\nsecond visitation, and there were negotiations between the French and\r\nthe Dutch Republic--the Batavian Republic, as it was called--which had\r\nbeen forming an alliance with France.  Neither the French Republic nor\r\nthe Batavian felt any particular interest in the Irish movement, or\r\ncared very much whether Ireland obtained her national independence or\r\nhad to live without it.  France, of course, was willing to make use of\r\nIreland as a vantage-ground from which to harass Great Britain, and the\r\nBatavian Republic, which had for some time been lapsing out of European\r\nnotice, was eager to distinguish herself and to play a conspicuous\r\npolitical part once again.  The idea at first was that Holland should\r\nfurnish the naval expedition and France contribute the troops--5000\r\nFrenchmen, under the command of General Hoche, who were to land in\r\nIreland and form the centre and rallying point for the United Irishmen.\r\nThe Batavian Republic, however, did not seem anxious to give all the\r\nmilitary glory of the affair to France, and some excuses were made on\r\nthe ground that the discipline of the Dutch navy was somewhat too\r\nsevere for the soldiers of France to put up with.  General Hoche seems\r\nto have acted with great disinterestedness and moderation under trying\r\nconditions.  He saw that the Dutch were anxious to make a name for\r\nthemselves once more, and he feared that if he were to press for the\r\nembarkation of the French soldiers it might lead to the abandonment of\r\nthe whole expedition.  Longing as he was for the chance to distinguish\r\nhimself in any attack upon England, he controlled his eagerness and\r\nconsented that the Dutch should have the undertaking all to themselves.\r\nPoor Wolfe Tone had to wait and look on all this time, eating his own\r\nheart, according to the Homeric phrase.  He has left us in his journal\r\na description of his feelings as he saw the days go by without any\r\nmovement being made to harass the English enemy, and of his own\r\nemotions when what might have seemed the heaven-sent chance of the\r\nmutiny at the {318} Nore broke out in the English fleet and no\r\nadvantage could be taken of it to forward the chances of the expedition\r\nfrom the Texel.  For now again the skies and the winds had come to the\r\ndefence of England, and the Dutch fleet was kept to its anchorage in\r\nits own waters.  Various plans of warfare were schemed out by the\r\nBatavian Republic, with the hope of putting the English naval\r\nauthorities on a wrong scent, but all these schemes were suddenly\r\ndefeated by the orders given to the Dutch admiral to put to sea at\r\nonce.  He did put to sea, and was encountered by Admiral Duncan, and\r\nthe result was the great victory of Camperdown, won by the English over\r\nthe Dutch after splendid fighting on both sides.  Admiral Duncan\r\nthereby became Lord Camperdown and the Batavian Republic dropped all\r\nideas of a naval expedition against England.  Meanwhile the gallant\r\nGeneral Hoche had died, and Wolfe Tone lost a true friend, with whom,\r\nfrom the beginning of their acquaintance, he had been in thorough\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1798--The brink of an Irish rebellion]\r\n\r\nAll this time the condition of things in Ireland was becoming\r\ndesperate.  After the appearance of the fleet in Bantry Bay, and the\r\nhopes which it created on the one side and the alarms on the other, the\r\nruling powers in Dublin Castle, and indeed at Westminster, had no other\r\nidea but that of crushing out the rebellious spirit of the Irish people\r\nby Coercion Acts and by military law.  The national sentiment of\r\nIreland counted for nothing with them.  It may be safely laid down as\r\nan axiom in political history that the men who are not able to take\r\naccount of the force of what they would call a mere national sentiment\r\nin public affairs are not and never can be fit to carry on the great\r\nwork of government.  Ireland was overrun by militia regiments, sent\r\nover from England and Scotland, who had no sympathy whatever with the\r\nIrish people, and regarded them simply as revolted slaves to be\r\nscourged back into submission or shot down if they persevered in\r\nrefusing to submit.  Other forces representing law and order were found\r\nin the yeomanry, who were chiefly Orangemen and officered by Orangemen,\r\nand who regarded the Catholic peasantry as their born enemies.  A state\r\nof tumult raged {319} through the greater part of the unhappy island,\r\nand there cannot be the slightest doubt that the floggings, hangings,\r\nand shootings inflicted by the militia and by the yeomen were in many\r\ncases done not so much in punishment as in anticipation of rebellious\r\nmovements on the part of the Catholics.  In the mean time preparations\r\nwere unquestionably going on in many Irish counties, more especially in\r\nUlster, for an outbreak of rebellion.  The organization of United\r\nIrishmen was adding to its numbers of sworn-in members every day, and\r\nthe making of pikes was a busy manufacture all over many of the\r\ncounties.  Grattan and some of his friends made many efforts in the\r\nIrish House of Commons to induce the Government to devise some means\r\nfor the pacification of Ireland other than Coercion Acts, the scourge,\r\nthe bullet, and the gallows.  Finding their efforts wholly in vain,\r\nGrattan, Arthur O'Connor, Lord Edward Fitzgerald and his brother, and\r\nmany other men of high character and position withdrew from the Dublin\r\nParliament altogether, and left to the Government the whole\r\nresponsibility for the results of its policy.  It is always to be\r\nregretted that a man like Grattan should ever recede from his position\r\nas a constitutional patriot in the assembly where alone his counsels\r\ncan have any practical weight; but of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Arthur\r\nO'Connor the same is not to be said, for these men and many of their\r\nfriends had made up their minds that the time had come when only in\r\narmed rebellion there remained any hope for Ireland.  In the English\r\nParliament some efforts were made by Charles James Fox and by Whitbread\r\nto obtain an inquiry into the real cause of the troubles in Ireland,\r\nbut the attempts were ineffectual, and the authorities at Dublin Castle\r\nwere allowed to carry out their own peculiar policy without control or\r\ncheck of any kind.\r\n\r\nOnce again the fates were suddenly unpropitious to the Irish national\r\nmovement.  The force which was intended for Ireland was suddenly\r\nordered to form a part of the expedition which Bonaparte was leading\r\nagainst Egypt.  Thereupon the chiefs of the United Irishmen began to\r\nsee {320} that there was not much hope to be founded on any help to\r\ncome from France, and it was decided that Ireland should enter into\r\nopen armed rebellion under the command of Lord Edward Fitzgerald.  It\r\nwas confidently believed that all but a small number of the Irish\r\ncounties would rise to arms at once under such leadership, and the\r\nIrish leaders little knew how completely the Government was supplied\r\nwith the knowledge of all the Irish national plans and movements.\r\nIndeed, there seems only too much reason to believe that the policy of\r\nPitt had long been to force the Irish into premature rebellion by the\r\npersistent application of the system of coercion, represented by what\r\nwere called \"free quarters\"--in other words, the billeting of soldiers\r\nindiscriminately among the houses of the peasantry, thereby leaving the\r\nwives and daughters of Irish Catholics at the mercy of a hostile\r\nsoldiery--by the burning of houses, the shooting down of almost\r\ndefenceless crowds, and the flogging and hanging of men and women.\r\nCertain it is that many of the British officers high in command\r\nprotested loudly against such a policy, and that some of them\r\npositively refused to carry it out, and preferred to incur any rebuke\r\nrather than be the instruments of such indiscriminate oppression.  Pitt\r\nand the authorities at Dublin Castle probably reasoned with themselves\r\nthat since the rebellion was certain to come it was better to press it\r\non prematurely, so that it might be easily crushed, rather than leave\r\nit to take its own time and put its plans into execution when they\r\nshould have arrived at a formidable maturity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1798--Father John Murphy and Miles Byrne]\r\n\r\nThe rebellion broke out in the early part of 1798.  It had some\r\nbrilliant temporary successes in Wexford County and in other counties.\r\nIn one part of Wexford the movement was literally forced upon the\r\npeople by the outrageous conduct of the militia and the yeomanry.  One\r\nof the local Irish priests, Father John Murphy, had used all his\r\nefforts up to the last in the cause of order, and had been most\r\nenergetic in persuading the people to give up their pikes and other\r\nweapons to the local authorities.  After the people had surrendered\r\ntheir arms the scourging, {321} shooting, and hanging went on just the\r\nsame as before, and Father John Murphy and numbers of his parishioners\r\nwere forced to take refuge in the woods.  Then for the first time\r\nFather Murphy became a rebel.  More than that, he became all at once an\r\ninsurgent general.  He put himself at the head of the despairing\r\npeasantry, and he suddenly developed a decided talent for the work of\r\nan insurgent chief.  His people were armed for the most part only with\r\npitchforks and with spades.  Their pikes had nearly all been\r\nsurrendered; only some few of the farming class had guns; and there\r\nwas, of course, no sort of heavy artillery.  Father Murphy showed his\r\npeople how to barricade with carts the road through which a body of\r\ncavalry were expected to pass, and at the right moment, just when the\r\ncavalry found themselves unexpectedly obstructed, the insurgents\r\nsuddenly attacked them with pitchforks and spades, won a complete\r\nvictory, and utterly routed their opponents.  By this success the\r\nrebels became possessed of a considerable number of carbines, and were\r\nput in heart for further enterprises.  Father John Murphy won several\r\nother victories, and for the hour was master of a large part of\r\nWexford.  One of those who took service under him was a young man,\r\nMiles Byrne, scarcely eighteen years of age, who afterwards rose to\r\nhigh distinction in the French army under Napoleon, and maintained his\r\nposition and repute under the Restoration, and might have been seen up\r\nto the year 1863, a white-headed, white-bearded veteran, sunning\r\nhimself in the gardens of the Tuileries.  Father Murphy, however, was\r\nnot able long to hold out.  The want of weapons, the want of money and\r\nof all other resources, and no doubt the want of military experience,\r\nput him and his men at a hopeless disadvantage, and he was defeated in\r\nthe end, and was executed in the early summer of 1798.\r\n\r\nWhile the rebellion lasted there were, no doubt, many excesses on both\r\nsides.  The rebels sometimes could not be prevented by their leaders\r\nfrom fearful retaliations on those at whose hands they had seen their\r\nkindred suffer.  The gallant Miles Byrne himself has told us in his\r\nmemoirs {322} how in certain instances he found it impossible to check\r\nthe rage of his followers until their fury had found some satisfaction\r\nin what they believed to be the wild justice of revenge.  No one,\r\nhowever, who has studied the history of the times even as it is told by\r\nloyalist narrators will feel surprised that the policy which had forced\r\non the outbreak of the rebellion should have driven the rebels into\r\nretaliation on the few occasions when they had the upper hand and found\r\ntheir enemies at their mercy.  It has never been denied that the\r\nexcesses committed by the rebels were but the spasmodic outbreaks of\r\nthe passion of retaliation, and that the Irish leaders everywhere did\r\nall they could to keep their followers within the bounds of legitimate\r\nwarfare.  It is not necessary to follow out in detail the story of the\r\nrebellion.  With no material help from abroad there could have been but\r\none end to it, and the end soon came.  A peasantry armed with pikes\r\ncould hardly hold their own for very long even against the militia\r\nimported from Great Britain, the Orange yeomanry, and the Hessian\r\ntroops hired from Germany, to say nothing of the regular English\r\nsoldiers, who were armed and trained to war.  Even the militiamen and\r\nthe yeomanry had better weapons than the pikemen who followed their\r\nIrish leaders to the death.  Before the rebellion was wholly crushed\r\nLord Edward Fitzgerald was dead.  The plans arranged by the leaders of\r\nthe movement had appointed a certain day for the rising to begin; the\r\noutbreak in Wexford, as has already been shown, was entirely\r\nunpremeditated, and merely forced on by events; and, as might have been\r\nexpected, the plans were betrayed to the authorities of Dublin Castle.\r\nSome of the leaders were instantly arrested, and Lord Edward had to fly\r\nand conceal himself.  His hiding-place was soon discovered, and he was\r\narrested in Thomas Street, Dublin, on May 19, 1798.  Lord Edward at\r\nfirst refused to surrender, and fought desperately for his life.  He\r\nwounded some of his assailants, and received himself a bullet in his\r\nbody.  He was then carried to prison, where he died sixteen days after.\r\n\"Fitly might the stranger lingering here,\" as Byron says of another\r\nhero, {323} \"pray for that gallant spirit's bright repose.\"  Even\r\nGeorge the Third himself might have felt some regret for the state of\r\nlaws which had turned Edward Fitzgerald into an enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1798--Ireland invaded by General Humbert]\r\n\r\nSuddenly another attempt to help Ireland and harass England was made\r\nfrom the French side of the English Channel.  Bonaparte was away on his\r\nEgyptian expedition, and the Directory in his absence did not wish to\r\nforego all idea of sending a force to Ireland, but were evidently not\r\nvery strong on the subject and did not seem quite to know how to set\r\nabout such a business.  For awhile they kept two or three small bodies\r\nof troops ready at certain ports within easy reach of the English\r\nshores, and a number of vessels at each port waiting for sudden orders.\r\nGeneral Humbert, an adventurous soldier of fortune, who had courage\r\nenough but not much wisdom, grew impatient at the long delay of the\r\nDirectory, and thought he could not do better to force the hand of the\r\nDirectory than to start an expedition himself.  Accordingly he took\r\ncommand of a force of about a thousand men in number which had been\r\nplaced at his disposal for an undefined date, and with three or four\r\nships to convey his men he made for the Irish shores.  He landed at\r\nKillala Bay, in the province of Connaught, and he made his way inland\r\nas far as the county of Longford.  The Irish peasantry rallied round\r\nhim in considerable numbers, and were received by him as part of the\r\narmy and invested with the French uniform.  He began his march with a\r\nsudden and complete victory over a body of English troops considerably\r\noutnumbering his own force, but whom he managed cleverly to surprise,\r\nand among whom a regular panic seems to have set in.  Humbert's scheme\r\nwas, however, hopeless.  The part of the country through which he was\r\nmarching was thinly populated, and large bodies of English troops,\r\nunder experienced commanders, were approaching him from all sides.  By\r\nthe time he had reached the county of Longford he found himself faced,\r\nor indeed all but surrounded, by the royal troops under the command of\r\nLord Cornwallis.  There was nothing for Humbert but to {324} surrender,\r\nand he and his French followers were treated as prisoners of war after\r\na final and brilliant fight and sent back to France.  The Irish\r\ninsurgents who had fought under his leadership dispersed and fled after\r\nthe surrender, well knowing that they would not be included in its\r\nterms and treated as prisoners of war, and they were pursued by the\r\nroyal troops and most of them were killed.  Matthew Tone, a brother of\r\nWolfe Tone, was one of those who had fought under Humbert.  He was made\r\nprisoner, taken to Dublin, and executed there within a few days.  Thus\r\nended the second expedition from France for the relief of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWolfe Tone meanwhile was waiting in France, hoping against hope.  He\r\nhad as yet known nothing of the fortunes and failure of Humbert's\r\nexpedition.  Some extracts from a letter written to his wife about this\r\ntime have a melancholy interest.\r\n\r\n\"Touching money matters, I have not yet received a sou, and last night\r\nI was obliged to give my last five guineas to my countrymen here.  I\r\ncan shift better than they can.  I hope to receive a month's pay\r\nto-day, but it will not be possible to remit you any part of it; you\r\nmust therefore carry on the war as best you can for three or four\r\nmonths, and before that is out we will see further. . . .  I am\r\nmortified at not being able to send you a remittance, but you know it\r\nis not my fault.\r\n\r\n\"We embark about 3000 men, with 13 pieces of artillery, and I judge\r\nabout 20,000 stand of arms.  We are enough, I trust, to do the\r\nbusiness, if we arrive safe.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to myself, I have had every reason to be satisfied; I\r\nstand fair with the General and my _camarades_; I am in excellent\r\nhealth and spirits; I have great confidence in the success of our\r\nenterprise; and, come what may, at least I will do what is right.  The\r\ntime is so short that I must finish this; I will, if possible, write to\r\nyou again, but if we should unexpectedly sail my next will be, I hope,\r\nfrom Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1798--The capture of Wolfe Tone]\r\n\r\nThe embarking to which Tone referred was that of an expedition which\r\nthe Directory had at last resolved to {325} despatch from Brest for the\r\nIrish shore.  By a somewhat touching coincidence Tone found himself on\r\nboard a war-vessel called the \"Hoche,\" which was under the command of\r\nthe admiral of the little fleet.  This expedition consisted of one sail\r\nof the line and eight frigates, with 3000 French soldiers.  It sailed\r\non September 30, 1798; but the destinies were against it, as they had\r\nbeen against its predecessors, and contrary winds compelled the admiral\r\nto make a wide sweep out of what would otherwise have been its natural\r\ncourse.  It was not until October 10 that the little fleet, then\r\nreduced to four vessels--the others had been scattered--reached the\r\nshore of Lough Swilly, on the northwest coast of Ireland, and was there\r\nencountered by a fleet of six English sail of the line and two\r\nfrigates.  The admiral of the French fleet saw that there was no chance\r\nwhatever of his fighting his way through such an opposition, and he\r\nmade up his mind to offer the best resistance he could for the honor of\r\nthe French flag.  He promptly gave signals for the lighter vessels,\r\nwhich would have been of little practical service in such a struggle,\r\nto make the safest retreat they could, and with his own vessel resolved\r\nrather perhaps to do and die than to do or die.  A boat came from one\r\nof the frigates to take his final instructions, and he and all the\r\nFrench officers, naval and military, who were on board the \"Hoche\"\r\nstrongly urged Wolfe Tone to go to the frigate in the boat and thus\r\nsave his life.  They pointed out to him that if they were captured they\r\nmust be treated as prisoners of war, but that no mercy would be shown\r\nto him, a subject of King George, taken in French uniform.  Wolfe Tone\r\nperemptorily declined to accept the General's advice.  It should never\r\nbe said of him, he declared, that he saved his life and left Frenchmen\r\nto fight and die in the cause of his country.  A fierce naval battle\r\ntook place, and the French admiral fought until he was overpowered, and\r\nhad no course left to him but to surrender.  The French officers who\r\nhad survived the fight were all taken to Letterkenny, Tone among the\r\nnumber.  Tone was in French uniform, and might have passed unrecognized\r\nas a French officer but that {326} an Ulster magnate, Sir George Hill,\r\nwho had known him in earlier days, became at once aware of his\r\nidentity, and addressed him by name.  Tone calmly and civilly replied\r\nto the greeting, and courteously asked after the health of the wife of\r\nhis discoverer.  Then all was over so far as Tone was concerned.  He\r\nwas conveyed to Dublin and tried by court-martial as a rebel and a\r\ntraitor to George the Third.  He defended himself in a speech of\r\nremarkable eloquence--that is, if he can be said to have defended\r\nhimself when his whole speech was a frank avowal of his purpose to\r\nfight for the independence of Ireland.  He declared that he thoroughly\r\nunderstood the consequences of his failure, and was prepared to abide\r\nby them.  \"Washington,\" he said, \"succeeded, and Kosciusko failed;\" and\r\nhe only insisted that in his case, as in that of Kosciusko, failure\r\nbrought with it no dishonor.  The one sole appeal which he made was\r\nthat he might be allowed to die a soldier's death--that he might be\r\nshot and not hanged.  Tone was found guilty, of course; there was no\r\nchoice left to the court-martial on that question, and his appeal as to\r\nthe mode of his death was refused by the Lord-Lieutenant.  John Philpot\r\nCurran, the great advocate, made a motion in the King's Bench to the\r\neffect that Tone should be removed from the custody of the\r\nProvost-Marshal and tried before a civil tribunal, on the ground that\r\nTone was not in the English army, and that, as the civil courts were\r\nsitting, there was no warrant for the interference of martial law.  The\r\nLord Chief Justice, Lord Kilwarden, a man whose public spirit and whose\r\ndevotion to law and justice would have done honor to any bench, ruled\r\nin favor of Curran's appeal, and ordered that Tone be removed from the\r\ncustody of the Provost-Marshal.  When the Provost-Marshal declined to\r\nobey the order the Chief Justice directed that the Provost-Marshal be\r\ntaken into custody, and that he, along with Tone, be brought before the\r\nCourt.  The decision came too late so far as Tone was concerned.\r\nBather than endure the ignominy of a public execution by the gallows,\r\nwhich he believed to be awaiting him, he had found means to open a vein\r\nin his throat.  {327} \"You see I am but a poor anatomist,\" he said with\r\na quiet smile to the surgeon who was brought to his bedside.  He\r\nlingered in a half-unconscious state for a few days and then died.  His\r\ndeath was the closing event of the Irish insurrection of 1798.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1778-1803--Robert Emmet]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a sort of afterbirth of the struggle of\r\n\"Ninety-Eight\" in the attempt hazarded by Robert Emmet, to which we\r\nhave already made anticipatory allusion.  Robert Emmet, the brother of\r\nThomas Addis Emmet, was a young Irishman of great abilities and of\r\ngenerous, unselfish, imprudent enthusiasm.  He could not bring himself\r\nto believe that the hopes of Irish independence were buried even in the\r\ngraves of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Wolfe Tone.  He had no trust\r\nwhatever in any assistance to be given from France, but he set himself\r\nto organize a movement which should be Irish only and should find its\r\nwhole organization and its battle-field on the soil of Ireland.  He\r\nfound numbers of brave and ardent young men to assist him, and he\r\nplanned out another rising, which was to begin with a seizure of Dublin\r\nCastle and a holding of the capital as a centre and a citadel of the\r\nnew movement for Irish independence.  Emmet's passion for national\r\nindependence had been strengthened by the passing of the Act of Union.\r\nThe Act of Union had long been a project in the mind of Pitt, and\r\nindeed it was the opinion of many observers then, and of some\r\nhistorical students from that time to the present, that Pitt had forced\r\non the Irish rebellion in order to give an excuse for the absolute\r\nextinction of the Irish Parliament and the centralization of the system\r\nof government in the Parliament sitting at Westminster.  It is, at all\r\nevents, quite certain that Pitt accomplished his scheme for a\r\nlegislative union between Great Britain and Ireland by a wholesale\r\nsystem of bribery, the bribery taking the form of peerages, of\r\nhigh-salaried appointments, of liberal pensions, and even of sums of\r\nready money.  All that was really national in the Irish Parliament\r\nfought to the last against Pitt's Act of Union, but the Act was\r\ncarried, and it came into operation on January 1, 1801.  The Act itself\r\nand the methods by which {328} it was passed only gave to Robert Emmet\r\na fresh stimulus to prepare his plans for the independence of Ireland.\r\nWe need not follow in detail the story of these plans and the attempt\r\nto put them into execution.  Robert Emmet's projects were, no doubt,\r\nall well known to the authorities of Dublin Castle before any attempt\r\ncould be made to carry them out.  In any case their chances of success\r\nseem to have depended very much upon the simultaneous action of a great\r\nnumber of persons in a great number of different places, and the\r\nhistory of every secret revolutionary movement tells us of the almost\r\ninsuperable difficulty there is in getting all the actors of such a\r\ndrama to appear upon the stage at the same moment and at the right\r\nmoment.  Emmet's plan broke down, and it ended not even in a general\r\nrising of the nationalists of Dublin, but in a mere street riot, the\r\nmost sad and shocking event in which was the murder of the Lord Chief\r\nJustice, Lord Kilwarden.  While Emmet, in another part of the city, was\r\nvainly striving to retrieve the disorder into which the excesses of\r\nsome of his followers had broken up the plan of attack, Lord\r\nKilwarden's carriage was stopped by a body of undisciplined and\r\ninfuriated rioters, and one man thrust a pike into Kilwarden's body.\r\nEmmet himself came too late upon the scene to rescue the Chief Justice,\r\nand from that moment he gave up all hope of anything like orderly\r\naction on the part of the insurgents, and indeed his whole effort was\r\nto get his followers to disperse and to stop any rising in the adjacent\r\ncounties.  Kilwarden died soon after he had received his wound, but not\r\nbefore he had uttered the noble injunction that no man should suffer\r\nfor his death without full and lawful trial.  Seldom has even the\r\nassassin's hand stricken a worse blow than that which killed Lord\r\nKilwarden.  In an age when corrupt judges and partial judges were not\r\nuncommon, Kilwarden was upright, honorable and just.  The fiercest\r\nnationalist of the day lamented his death.  He had again and again\r\nstood before the Crown officials and interposed the shield of law\r\nbetween them and the victims whom they strove by any process to bring\r\nto death.  Emmet made his way into Wicklow with {329} the main purpose\r\nof stopping the intended outbreak of insurrection there, as he saw now\r\nthat no such attempts could, under the conditions, end in anything but\r\nuseless bloodshed.  His friends urged him to make his escape to France,\r\nand he might easily have escaped but that he went back to Dublin with\r\nthe hope of seeing once again Sarah Curran, the youngest daughter of\r\nthe great advocate, with whom he was devotedly in love.  He was\r\nrecognized, arrested, and sent to trial before Lord Norbury, a judge\r\nwho bore a very different sort of reputation from that which honored\r\nLord Kilwarden.  Emmet made a brilliant and touching speech, not in\r\ndefence of himself against the charge of trying to create a rebellion,\r\nfor he avowed his purpose and glorified it, but in vindication of his\r\ncause and in utter denial of the accusation commonly brought against\r\nhim that he intended to make his country the subject of France.\r\n[Sidenote: 1803--The execution of Robert Emmet] He was found guilty,\r\nsentenced to death, and executed on the morning after his trial.\r\nThomas Moore, the Irish poet, who was a college friend of Emmet's, has\r\nembalmed his memory in three beautiful songs, \"She is far from the land\r\nwhere her young hero sleeps,\" she being of course Sarah Curran, to whom\r\nEmmet addressed his last written words; \"Oh, breathe not his name,\" and\r\n\"When he who adores thee,\" an appeal to Ireland to remember him who had\r\nat least \"the pride of thus dying for thee.\"  Washington Irving, the\r\nAmerican author, devoted a touching essay, called \"The Broken Heart,\"\r\nto the story of Robert Emmet and his blighted passion.  The lovers of\r\nromance may be somewhat disconcerted to hear that Sarah Curran married\r\nafter her young hero's death; but she remained single many years, and\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that she ever forgot or disclaimed her\r\naffection for Robert Emmet.  Wolfe Tone's wife married again some\r\nsixteen years after the husband of her youth had passed away.  Her\r\ngrave is to be seen in a cemetery close to Washington, in the United\r\nStates, the land in which Wolfe Tone's widow passed all the later years\r\nof her life.\r\n\r\nWith the failure and the death of Robert Emmet closed the last\r\nrebellious rising in Ireland which belongs to the {330} history of the\r\nGeorges.  Pitt's Act of Union is still in force, but it would be idle\r\nto say that it is anything more than in force.  The union between\r\nEngland and Scotland, to which Pitt's supporters so often triumphantly\r\nappealed, was made under conditions and on terms totally different from\r\nthose which had to do with the union between England and Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{331}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1793-1815--The genius of the great Bonaparte]\r\n\r\nNothing in the history of the world is quite as wonderful as the\r\nhistory of the first Napoleon.  No other man ever rose from so little\r\nto so much, ever played a greater part in the eyes of the civilized\r\nworld, was more monstrous in his triumphs or more tragic in his fall.\r\nEverything connected with his strange career was distorted,\r\nexaggerated, seemingly out of all proportion to the familiarities, the\r\nconventionalities, and even the possibilities of existence.  As the\r\nancient Greeks, in their sculpture, for the delineation of their gods\r\npermitted themselves the use of the heroic size and made their\r\nimmortals and their demi-gods more than common tall, and more than\r\ncommon comely, so might the modern historian seem privileged in the use\r\nof a superlative style in dealing with a life so phenomenal, so\r\nunbounded by the average horizon, so ungoverned by the ordinary laws.\r\nAnd yet no more is needed than the cold statement of the stages in that\r\ngreat story, of the steps which conducted to the summit of the pyramid\r\nonly to be descended on the other side.  Such a statement is itself the\r\nsermon on an earthly glory that was almost unearthly in the vastness of\r\nits aims and of its gains, and on a humiliation that restored humanity\r\nto reason and reaffirmed the inexorable lesson.  As the mere names of\r\nbattles on the commemorative arch appeal to the memories, the\r\nambitions, and the passions of a military race with a monumental\r\nemphasis that is not to be rivalled by the painter or writer, so a few\r\nsimple words serve to contrast with a simplicity that is in itself a\r\npomp the crowns and the catastrophes of that amazing visitation.\r\n\"Corsica,\" \"St. Helena,\" \"Brumaire,\" \"Moscow,\" \"Toulon,\" {332}\r\n\"Waterloo.\"  The chronicle of the great conqueror is written in little\r\nin the names of two islands, two battles, and two towns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1803-15--England's fear of Napoleon]\r\n\r\nTo Frenchmen, even to the Frenchmen who are most opposed to him,\r\nNapoleon must always be an object for gratitude and for admiration.\r\nThe most passionate champion of the Bourbon lilies and the doctrine of\r\nthe divine right of kings cannot refuse to recognize that Napoleon\r\nBonaparte gave to France a greater military glory than she had ever\r\nknown or ever dreamed of before.  The most devout disciple of the\r\nprinciples of '89, the fieriest apostle of the Revolution that went\r\ndown into the dust before the cunning of Barras and the cannon of the\r\nCorsican adventurer, is obliged to admit the splendid services that\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte rendered to his adopted country.  The one antagonist\r\nconfesses that the Napoleonic eagles flew with the length of flight and\r\nthe strength of wing of the Roman eagles.  The other antagonist sees\r\nwith approval the Code Napoléon and the Order of the Legion of Honor,\r\nthe Simplon Road and the Canal of St. Quentin, the encouragement given\r\nto arts, to letters, and to commerce, the reorganization of finance and\r\nthe reconstitution of the army.  But to the average Englishman of that\r\ntime, and for long afterwards, Napoleon was first and last and always\r\nthe implacable enemy of Great Britain.  From the day of Toulon to the\r\nday of Waterloo, Bonaparte was the Big Bogey of England; always either\r\nfighting against her openly or plotting against her secretly, always\r\nguided by one purpose, always haunted by one hope--the conquest of a\r\ncountry that had learned to look upon herself as unconquerable.  Pitt,\r\nwho hated war, was destined to play the uncongenial part of a War\r\nMinister, with one short interval, for the rest of his life, and to\r\ndevote his genius and his energy to a life-and-death struggle with the\r\nsoldier of fortune who was yesterday the hero of Italy, to-day First\r\nConsul, to-morrow to be Emperor of the French.  The story of Pitt's\r\nlife, for the rest of Pitt's life, is the story of a struggle against\r\nNapoleon, a struggle maintained under difficulties and disadvantages\r\nthat might well have {333} broken a strong man's heart, and that seemed\r\nto end in disaster when the strong man's heart was broken.\r\n\r\nIt looked for long enough as if nothing could withstand the military\r\ngenius or sate the ambition of Napoleon.  On his sword sat laurel\r\nvictory, and smooth success was strewn before his feet.  He overran\r\nEgypt, and dreamed of rivalling the Eastern conquests of Alexander.\r\nThe Kingdoms of Europe crumpled up before him.  On land he seemed to be\r\nlittle less than invincible.  England was only safe from him because\r\nEngland held the supremacy of the sea.  When the war with France began\r\nEngland was blessed with an effective navy, and England's fleet was\r\nEngland's fortune in the days when the conqueror of a continent was the\r\nnightmare of an island.  A monstrous regiment of caricaturists were\r\npainting themselves into fame by fantastic and ferocious presentations\r\nof the man who was so fiercely hated because he was so greatly dreaded.\r\nSome of these caricatures are pitifully ignoble, some in their kind are\r\nmasterpieces; all are animated by a great fury that is partly the\r\noutcome of a great fear.  For years that fear was always present; for\r\nyears it was always well within the bounds of possibility that the fear\r\nmight be realized in a great national catastrophe.  In every coast town\r\nof England men volunteered and drilled and manned defences, and scanned\r\nwith anxious eyes the horizon for the sails that were to fulfil a\r\nmenace more terrible than the menace of the Armada.  England's military\r\nfame had dwindled on the battle-fields of Europe; England's strength at\r\nhome was as nothing compared to the strength that France could employ\r\nagainst her if once France could obtain a landing on her shores.\r\nNapoleon had declared scornfully that the country with the few millions\r\nof men must give way to the country with many millions of men.  All\r\nthat he needed to reduce England, as he had reduced so many other of\r\nthe kingdoms of the earth, was to place his armed majority where it\r\ncould act with overwhelming force against an armed minority.  Only one\r\nthing lay between him and his purpose, but that one thing was the navy\r\nof England.  Napoleon knew that if he had but {334} command of the\r\nChannel for a very few hours the landing of which he had dreamed, and\r\nfor which he had schemed so long, would be a reality, and a march on\r\nLondon as easy as a march on Vienna.  But he never got those few hours'\r\ncommand of the sea.  Perhaps no greater monument of human vanity exists\r\nthan the medal which Napoleon, madly prophesying, caused to be struck\r\nin commemoration of the conquest of England.  Perhaps no pages of all\r\nthe pages of history are more splendid than those which record the\r\ntriumphs and the glories of the English fleet in the mortal struggle\r\nwith France.  When the great war began it was well for England that her\r\nnavy was in effective condition; it was perhaps better still that the\r\ntraditions of her navy were rich with heroic deeds, examples splendid\r\nto emulate, hard to surpass, but which, however, the sailors of King\r\nGeorge the Third were destined to surpass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1797--Mutinies in the British Navy]\r\n\r\nYet the conditions of life under which the English sailor lived were\r\nscarcely of a kind to foster the serene, austere virtues of patriotism\r\nand heroism.  The English sailor was often snared into the active\r\nservice of his country sorely against his will by means of the odious\r\ninstrument for recruiting known as the press-gang.  His existence on\r\nboard the mighty and beautiful men-of-war was a life that at its best\r\nwas a life of the severest hardship, and that at its worst was hard\r\nindeed to endure.  He and his fellows were herded together under\r\nconditions of indescribable filth, squalor, and discomfort, often\r\nfoolishly ill-fed, often cruelly ill-treated, often the victims of\r\nintolerable tyranny from brutal superiors.  It is sometimes little\r\nshort of marvellous that the sailors on whose faith the safety of\r\nEngland depended should have proved so faithful, so cheerful, so\r\ndesperately brave.  There was, indeed, a moment when the faith of some\r\nof them failed, and when the safety of England was in greater jeopardy\r\nthan it had been in since the crescent of the Armada was reported off\r\nPlymouth or the Dutch ships lay in the Medway.  While the war with\r\nFrance was still in its gloomy dawn the unwisdom of treating British\r\nsailors worse than beasts of burden came near to wrecking the kingdom.\r\nIn 1797 the crews {335} of very many of the King's ships were\r\nexasperated by ill-treatments and injustices of many kinds, exasperated\r\nmost of all by the fatal folly of long arrears of pay--a folly which in\r\nFrance, but eight years earlier, had been one of the most powerful\r\nfactors in aiding the spread of the Revolution.  There came a point\r\nwhen the sense of injury seemed too hard to bear, and England was\r\nstartled by the news of a mutiny at Spithead.  But the mutiny, if\r\nalarming, was kept within moderate bounds and under control by the\r\nmutineers; it was temperately met and temperately dealt with by Lord\r\nHowe, and it soon came to an end.  It was immediately followed by a far\r\nmore alarming mutiny which broke out among the ships at the Nore.  This\r\nmutiny, headed by a seaman named Parker, who proved himself a bold and\r\ndaring spirit, swelled swiftly to serious proportions.  Londoners saw\r\nthe mouth of their river blockaded by the war-ships of England, saw\r\ntheir capital city fortified against the menaces of the men they relied\r\nupon as their saviors.  Admiral Duncan, busily engaged in keeping a\r\nDutch fleet cooped up in the river Texel, suddenly beheld almost the\r\nwhole of his squadron desert him and sail away to join Parker and his\r\nfellow-mutineers at the Nore.  It was one of the gravest crises in\r\nEnglish history, one of the greatest perils that England had to face\r\nduring the whole of the French war.  But the danger was weathered, the\r\nperil overcome.  The Government faced the dangers of mutiny as firmly\r\nas they had faced the dangers of the war.  Whatever the provocation,\r\nmutiny at such a moment was a national crime.  It flickered out as\r\ntamely as it blazed up fiercely.  Parker and some of his\r\nfellow-conspirators were hanged, strong men dying unhappily, and once\r\nagain England had only her foreign foes to reckon with.  Over away by\r\nthe Texel stout-hearted Duncan, with only his flagship and two frigates\r\nto represent the sea power of England, met the difficulty with a\r\nshiftiness worthy of Ulysses.  Through all his long hours of loneliness\r\nhe kept on gallantly signalling away to an imaginary fleet, and the\r\nDutchmen in the Texel little dreamed that they were held in check by a\r\ndeserted admiral {336} upon a desolate sea.  When at last they emerged,\r\nDuncan's danger was over; his faithless vessels had returned to their\r\nfaith, and the crushing victory of Camperdown consoled one of the\r\nbravest of the brave for an agony unrivalled in the story of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1758-1805--Nelson]\r\n\r\nThe British admirals are the heroes of the dying eighteenth century.\r\n\"Admirals all, they said their say, the echoes are rising still\"--in\r\nthe words of Henry Newbolt's gallant song.  \"Admirals all, they went\r\ntheir way to the haven under the hill.\"  Dundonald was called, and\r\nfinely called, the last of the sea-kings; but they were all true\r\nkinsmen of the Vikings, the admirals who were famous figures in\r\nDundonald's fiery youth and famous memories in Dundonald's noble age.\r\nAnd as the admirals were, so were the captains, so were the men.\r\nFearney sticking the surrendered swords in a sheaf under his arm;\r\nWalton calmly informing his superior that \"we have taken or destroyed\r\nall the Spanish ships on this coast: number as per margin,\" are typical\r\nfigures in a tradition of a courage so superlative that Admiral Sir\r\nRobert Calder, who fought very gallantly and took two ships, was tried\r\nby court-martial and severely reprimanded for not having destroyed the\r\nFrench fleet.  The age of George the Third would be memorable, if it\r\nwere memorable for nothing else, for the deeds and the glories of the\r\ngreat sea fights and the great sea fighters who saved England from\r\ninvasion, knocking the tall ships of France to pieces, taking monstrous\r\nodds with alacrity, eager to engage in all weathers and under all\r\nconditions, cheerfully converting what seemed an impossible task into\r\nnot merely a feasible but an easy piece of business.  There are some\r\nsea battles of that time, fought out in storm and darkness, which read\r\nin the tamest statement with the pomp and beauty of the most majestic\r\nmusic.  The names of the great admirals must always be dear to English\r\nears, must always sound sweet on English lips.  St. Vincent,\r\nCollingwood, Howe, Duncan, the noble list proceeds, each name\r\nilluminated with its only splendid story of desperate enterprise and\r\ndeathless honor, till the proudest name of all is reached, {337} and\r\npraise itself seems to falter and fall off before the lonely grandeur\r\nof Nelson.  Never was a little life filled with greater achievements;\r\nnever was a little body more compact of the virtues that make great\r\ncaptains and brave men.  The life that began in the September of 1758\r\nand that ended in the October of 1805 holds in the compass of its\r\nforty-seven years the epitome of what England meant for Englishmen in\r\nthe days of its greatest peril and its greatest glory.  Magnificent,\r\nmagniloquent, turbulent, it is starred with glowing phrases as thickly\r\nas with glowing deeds.  \"Fear!  I never saw fear: what is it?\"  \"A\r\npeerage, or Westminster Abbey;\" the immortal signal; the famous saying\r\noff Copenhagen: \"It is warm work; this day will be the last to many of\r\nus, but I would not be elsewhere for thousands;\" the pathos of the\r\ndying lover: \"Let my dear Lady Hamilton have my hair;\" and the pride of\r\nthe dying hero: \"Thank God, I have done my duty\"--all these things are\r\nthe splendid ornaments of a splendid career; they gleam on his story as\r\nhis stars and orders gleamed upon his breast when the \"Victory\" renewed\r\nher name.  With the battle of Trafalgar and the destruction of the\r\nallied French and Spanish fleets Napoleon's dream of England's conquest\r\ncame to an end.  The result was bought at a great price, the price of\r\nNelson's life.  But Nelson had done his work, and done it well.  He\r\nsaved his country; he had deserved well of his countrymen; he summed in\r\nhimself all the qualities that made the English sailor the idol of his\r\npeople and the terror of his foes.\r\n\r\nWhile Nelson still lived and conquered, there came a check to the\r\ntroubled supremacy of Pitt.  In 1801--when the memories of the battle\r\nof the Nile and the defence of Acre were still fresh in men's thoughts,\r\nand Napoleon had been for a year First Consul--Pitt, baffled by\r\ncircumstances, surrendered to mediocrity and Addington was Prime\r\nMinister in his place.  For three disastrous years Addington was\r\npermitted to prove his incompetency, till in 1804 Pitt, as the only\r\npossible man, came back to power to face a Napoleon more menacing than\r\never, a Napoleon now, in that same year, crowned and triumphant as\r\n{338} Emperor of the French.  England was Mistress of the Seas, but\r\nNapoleon was Master of Europe.  Pitt's health was fading swiftly; he\r\nwatched with despair the progress of his enemy.  Ulm came, and\r\nAusterlitz, and Austerlitz struck Pitt at the heart.\r\n\r\nThe closing hours of Pitt's career were as troubled and as gloomy as\r\nits dawn had been radiant and serene.  It may have cost him little to\r\nbe reconciled with the pompous mediocrity of Addington, and thereby to\r\nplacate the King.  His nature could afford to be magnanimous to the\r\nungrateful incompetency that was able only in betrayal.  It need not\r\nhave given a pang to that proud and lonely spirit to welcome into the\r\nCabinet the Earl of Buckinghamshire, who had wedded the one fair woman\r\nwhose heart Pitt had won and lost.  But the anguish of his soul was\r\nwrung into expression by the fall of Dundas.  He had loved Dundas, who\r\nwas now Lord Melville, long and well.  Lord Melville's conduct as\r\nTreasurer to the Navy provoked from the Opposition a series of\r\ncondemnatory resolutions.  In spite of all that Pitt could do, the\r\nresolutions were supported by many of his followers, by many of his\r\nfriends, by one friend conspicuous among all, by Wilberforce.  The\r\ndivision was neck and neck, 216 to 216; the Speaker, \"white as a\r\nsheet,\" gave the casting vote against Dundas which stabbed Pitt to the\r\ncore.  Whether it were or no, as Wilberforce maintained, a \"false\r\nprinciple of honor\" which led the great minister to support Melville,\r\nPitt felt the blow as he had felt nothing before and was to feel but\r\none thing again.  Pitt pulled his little cocked hat over his forehead\r\nto hide his tears.  One brutal adversary, Sir Thomas Mostyn, raised the\r\nwild yell of triumph that denotes to huntsmen the death of the fox.\r\nAnother savage, Colonel Wardle, urged his friends to come and see \"how\r\nBilly looked after it.\"  But the young Tory gentlemen rallied around\r\ntheir hero.  They made a circle of locked arms, and with looks and\r\nwords that meant swords they kept the aggressors off.  In their midst\r\nPitt moved unconsciously out of the House--a broken-hearted man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1806--Death of Pitt]\r\n\r\nThe heart of Pitt was allowed to feel one pulse of pride {339} and\r\npleasure before it ceased to beat.  Pitt shared in the triumph of\r\nTrafalgar; he made his best and noblest appearance in public; made his\r\nlast most splendid speech: \"Europe is not to be saved by any single\r\nman,\" he said to those who saluted him at the Guildhall as the savior\r\nof Europe.  \"England has saved herself by her exertions, and will, I\r\ntrust, save Europe by her example.\"  A few weeks later, in the December\r\nof 1805, Pitt was at Bath, when a courier brought him the news of the\r\nbattle of Austerlitz.  The news practically killed him.  He had long\r\nbeen ailing grievously.  Sir Walter Farquhar's account of Pitt's\r\nhealth, lately made public by Lord Rosebery, proves that the body which\r\ncased that great spirit was indeed a ruined body.  Grief and anxiety\r\nhad stamped lines of care and sorrow upon his face, which gave it what\r\nWilberforce afterwards called \"the Austerlitz look.\"  The phrase is\r\nfamous and admirable, if not exactly accurate as used by Wilberforce,\r\nfor Lord Stanhope shows that Wilberforce never saw Pitt after the\r\nbattle of Austerlitz was fought.  With the Austerlitz look on his face,\r\nPitt travelled to London, to the villa now known as Bowling Green House\r\nat Putney.  With the Austerlitz look on his face he surrendered himself\r\nto the care of his niece, Lady Hester Stanhope, who afterwards lived\r\neccentric and died lonely in the East, a kind of desert queen.  With\r\nthe Austerlitz look on his face he bade that niece roll up the map of\r\nEurope: \"It will not be wanted these ten years.\"  With the Austerlitz\r\nlook on his face he died on January 23, 1806.\r\n\r\nEngland, that had lost in three months Nelson and Pitt, was to lose a\r\nthird great man in only eight months more.  Pitt's body lay in\r\nWestminster; Pitt's Ministry was dissipated into air; Pitt's great\r\nopponent was called to the office for the last time, and for a very\r\nshort time.  Fox, as we are told by his biographer, Lord Russell, never\r\nfelt personal enmity to Pitt.  He said, with generous truth, that he\r\nnever gave a vote with more satisfaction than his vote in support of\r\nthe motion to pay Pitt's debts and to settle pensions on his nieces.\r\nHe could not and did not indorse the proposal to confer honor on the\r\nmemory of Mr. Pitt {340} as an \"excellent statesman.\"  He was ready to\r\ntake office in the Ministry of All the Talents that Lord Grenville\r\ngathered together.  He became Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nFox, in office as out of office, had three great questions closely at\r\nheart: the treatment of Catholics, peace with France, and the Slave\r\nTrade.  But Fox in office was obliged to face and recognize the\r\ndifficulties, the solution of these questions.  He admitted,\r\nreluctantly, the inadvisability of pressing the Catholic claims at a\r\ntime when such pressure would prove destructive alike to the claims and\r\nto the Ministry that maintained them.  He admitted, reluctantly, that\r\nthe prospect of peace with France was very far from hopeful.  He still\r\ndreamed of a speedy abolition of the Slave Trade, and to this end he\r\nattended Parliament too persistently in defiance of the warnings of his\r\nfailing health.  He was tapped for dropsy; his condition grew worse; in\r\nthe evening of September 13, 1806, he died.  He was the greatest\r\nliberal of his age; the greatest friend of liberty.  The Irish poet\r\nbade the Irish banshee wail for him on whose burning tongue, truth,\r\npeace, and freedom hung.\r\n\r\nFox was not long dead when the Ministry of All the Talents found itself\r\nin direct collision with its royal master.  It had ventured to suggest\r\nthat it should be permitted to Catholics and to Dissenters to serve the\r\nKing and the country in the Army and Navy.  This small concession was\r\ntoo vast for the bigotry of George.  He would have none of it, and the\r\nobsequious Ministry consented to abandon the measure.  This was not\r\nenough for George.  He wanted to extract from the Ministry a formal\r\npromise in writing that it would never submit to the sovereign any\r\nmeasure that involved, or was in any way connected with, concessions to\r\nthe Catholics.  The Ministry was not obsequious to that ignoble degree.\r\nIt refused to bind itself by any such degrading pledge; and, in\r\nconsequence, it was turned out of office, and the Duke of Portland and\r\nMr. Perceval reigned in its stead.  The Ministry of All the Talents had\r\nlived neither a long nor a useful life.\r\n\r\n{341}\r\n\r\nSpencer Perceval was an able lawyer, a dexterous debater, a skilful\r\nParliamentarian.  He was privately an excellent man, with an excellence\r\nthat the irony of Sydney Smith has made immortal.  He was not quite the\r\nman to sit in the Siege Perilous that had been occupied in turn by Pitt\r\nand Fox.  He held his office under difficult conditions.  In 1810 the\r\nKing, whose ailing mind was unhinged by the death of his daughter\r\nAmelia, lost his reason irreparably.  Perceval had to fight the\r\nquestion of the Regency with a brilliant Opposition and a bitterly\r\nhostile Prince of Wales.  He succeeded, in the January of 1811, in\r\ncarrying his Regency Bill on the lines of the measure proposed in 1788.\r\nIn May, 1811, he was shot dead, in the Lobby of the House of Commons,\r\nby a madman named John Bellingham, who had some crazy grievance against\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nThe years from the January of 1811 to the January of 1820 are\r\ntechnically the last nine years of the reign of George the Third; they\r\nare practically the first nine years of the reign of George the Fourth.\r\nThe nine years of the Regency were momentous years in the history of\r\nEngland.  The mighty figure of Napoleon, whose shadow, creeping over\r\nthe map of Europe, had darkened and shortened the life of Pitt, was\r\nstill an abiding menace to England when the Prince of Wales became\r\nRegent.  But England, that had lost so much in her struggle with the\r\nCorsican conqueror, who had now no Nelson to oppose to him on the high\r\nseas, and no Pitt to oppose to him in the council chamber, found\r\nherself armed against his triumphs in the person of a great soldier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1769-1852--Arthur Wellesley]\r\n\r\nIn the same year that saw the birth of Napoleon, and on a date as\r\nlittle certain as that of the conqueror of Europe, a child was born to\r\nGarret Wellesley, first Earl of Mornington, in Dublin.  The child was a\r\nson, the third that Anne Hill, Lord Dungannon's eldest daughter, had\r\nborne to her music-loving husband; the child was christened Arthur.\r\nDates as various as May 1, May 6, and April 29, 1769, are given by\r\ndifferent authorities in that very year, and the place of birth is as\r\nunsettled as the date, Dangan Castle in Meath, and Mornington House,\r\nMerrion Street, {342} Dublin, being the alternatives offered.  Very\r\nlittle is known about the childhood and early youth of Arthur\r\nWellesley.  His mother seems to have considered him stupid, and to have\r\ndisliked him for his stupidity.  He went from school to school--first\r\nat Chelsea, then at Eton, then at Brussels--without showing any special\r\ngifts, except a taste for music, inherited no doubt from the father,\r\nwhose musical tastes had earned him the affection of George the Third.\r\nAn unamiable mother decided that he was \"food for powder and nothing\r\nmore;\" and when he was sixteen years old he was sent to the French\r\nAcademy at Angers, where he was able to learn all the engineering that\r\nhe wanted, at the very same time that the young Napoleon Bonaparte was\r\nbeing trained for a soldier in the military college at Brienne.  Of the\r\nlittle that can be known of the first seventeen years of Arthur\r\nWellesley's life the clearest facts are that his childhood was not\r\nhappy, that he was believed by many to be a dull and backward boy, and\r\nthat he himself thought that if circumstances had not made him a\r\nsoldier he would probably have become distinguished in public life as a\r\nfinancier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote--1786-97--Wellesley's military training]\r\n\r\nCircumstance made him a soldier.  Through the patronage of his eldest\r\nbrother, who became Earl of Mornington on his father's death, in 1781,\r\nthe young Arthur Wellesley entered the Army as an ensign in the\r\nSeventy-third Foot.  The same influence that had got him into the army\r\naided him to rise in it.  When he was little more than of age he was\r\ncaptain of the Eighteenth Light Dragoons, aide-de-camp to the\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and member of the Irish Parliament for his\r\nbrother's borough of Trim.  In the Irish Parliament he supported Pitt's\r\nmeasure to enfranchise Roman Catholics.  It was characteristic of the\r\nyoung man that, when once a career had been chosen for him, he devoted\r\nhimself to it with a cold, persistent zeal that accomplished as much\r\nfor him as the most passionate enthusiasm would have done for another.\r\nHe set before himself the principle that having undertaken a profession\r\nhe had better try to understand it, and understand it he did with a\r\ndetermined thoroughness {343} that was rare indeed, if not unknown,\r\namong the young officers of his day.  We are told that soon after he\r\ngot his first commission he had one of the privates of the\r\nSeventy-third weighed, first in his ordinary military clothes, and then\r\nin heavy marching order, in order to ascertain what was expected of a\r\nsoldier on service.  This kind of thoroughness, at once comprehensive\r\nand minute, distinguished the conduct of his whole career.  One of the\r\nmaxims that regulated his life was always to do the day's business in\r\nthe day.  Long years later he and a friend were driving together along\r\na coaching road, and amusing themselves by guessing what kind of\r\ncountry lay behind each hill they approached.  When the friend\r\ncommented upon the surprising accuracy of his companion's guesses the\r\nman who had been Arthur Wellesley answered: \"Why, all my life I have\r\nbeen trying to guess what lay on the other side of the hill;\" a\r\nstimulating piece of wisdom, to which he himself supplied the no less\r\nstimulating comment: \"All the business of war, and, indeed, all the\r\nbusiness of life, is to endeavor to find out what you don't know from\r\nwhat you do.\"  The youth who took soldiering in this iron spirit must\r\nhave been more than a puzzle to many of his contemporaries, whose\r\nsimple military creed it was that when an officer was not actually\r\nfighting he might best employ his time in drinking and gambling.  Young\r\nWellesley fell in love with Catherine Pakenham, Lord Longford's\r\ndaughter, and she with him; but the means of neither permitted marriage\r\nthen, and they did not marry until long years later.  When the war with\r\nFrance was forced upon a reluctant minister, Wellesley went to the\r\nContinent under Lord Moira and saw some fighting.  But his serious\r\ncareer began when he was sent to India with the Thirty-third Regiment\r\nin 1797.\r\n\r\nIt was in India that the young soldier was to learn those lessons in\r\nthe art of war which were afterwards to prove so priceless to England,\r\nand to gain a fame which might well have seemed great enough to satisfy\r\nany ambition less exacting than his.  But he had the generous greed of\r\nthe great soldier, the restless, high-reaching spirit, to which {344}\r\nthe success of yesterday is as nothing save as an experience that may\r\nserve for the success of to-morrow.  No better field than India could\r\nhave been found for a young and ambitious soldier who had devoted\r\nhimself to his career almost by chance, but who was resolved to approve\r\nhis choice by giving to the career of arms a zeal, a stubborn\r\npertinacity, a very passion of patience, rare, indeed, at the time, and\r\nwho was resolved to regard nothing as too great to attempt, or too\r\ntrivial to notice, in the execution of his duty.\r\n\r\nAfter a career of military honor and experience in India, Arthur\r\nWellesley began his struggle with Napoleon on the battle-fields of the\r\nSpanish Peninsula, and ended it upon the battle-field of Waterloo.  His\r\nwas the hand that gave the final blow to the falling, failing Emperor.\r\nThe career of so much glory and of so much gloom, of Corsican\r\nlieutenantship and Empire, of Brumaire and Bourbon Restoration, of\r\nEgyptian pyramids and Russian snows, of Tilsit and of Elba, and of the\r\nHundred Days, ended in the Island of St. Helena.  There exists among\r\nthe documents that are preserved from Napoleon's youth a geographical\r\nlist made out in his own boyish hand of names and places, with\r\nexplanatory comments.  The name of St. Helena is on the list, and the\r\nonly words written opposite to it are \"Little Island.\"  The Preacher on\r\nVanities never had a better text for a sermon.  The \"little island\"\r\nthat had then seemed so unimportant became in the end more momentous\r\nthan the Eastern Empire of his dreams.  The man who had made and unmade\r\nkingdoms, who had flung down the crowns of Europe for soldiers of\r\nfortune to scramble for as boys unto a muss, was now the unhonored\r\ncaptive of ungenerous opponents, the unhonored victim of the petty\r\ntyrannies of Sir Hudson Lowe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1812-15--The War of 1812]\r\n\r\nAs the most disastrous event of the reign of George the Third prior to\r\nthe Regency was a war with America, so the most disastrous event of the\r\nRegency was a war with America.  Napoleon's fantastic decrees of\r\ncommercial blockade levelled against England, and known as the\r\nContinental system, had embroiled the young republic and England, and\r\ndifferences inflamed by the unwisdom of {345} Perceval were not to be\r\nhealed by the belated wisdom of Castlereagh.  Two keen causes of\r\nquarrel were afforded by England's persistent assertion of the right to\r\nstop and search American vessels on the high seas for British subjects\r\nand England's no less persistent refusal to recognize that\r\nnaturalization as an American citizen in any way affected the\r\nallegiance of a British subject to the British crown.  Wise\r\nstatesmanship might have averted war, but wise statesmanship was\r\nwanting.  The death of Spencer Perceval caused the elevation to the\r\npremiership of a man as incapable as his predecessor of dealing\r\nskilfully with the American difficulty.  Robert Banks Jenkinson, who\r\nhad been Lord Hawkesbury and who was now Lord Liverpool, was a\r\ncuriously narrow-minded, hidebound politician who had never recovered\r\nfrom the shock of the French Revolution, and who was chiefly\r\nconspicuous for his dogged opposition to every species of reform.  He\r\nwas five years old when the fight at Concord began the struggle that\r\nended with American Independence, but the great event which\r\novershadowed his childhood had no apparent effect upon his later\r\njudgment.  This belated survival of the tradition of Hillsborough\r\nthought and said that America ought to look to England \"as the guardian\r\npower to which she was indebted not only for her comforts, not only for\r\nher rank in the scale of civilization, but for her very existence.\"\r\nFolly such as this could only end in disaster.  America, believing\r\nherself to be deeply wronged, declared war on Great Britain in the June\r\nof 1812.  The war lasted more than two years with varying fortunes.\r\nOnce again the scarlet coats of English soldiers were familiar, if\r\ndetested, objects to many of the men who had made the Republic, and\r\nover bloody battle-fields fluttered that English flag which most of\r\nthose who now opposed it had only seen as a trophy of their fathers'\r\nvictories.  Both sides fought under heavy disadvantages.  If England\r\nwas weakened by her struggle with Napoleon, America was hampered by\r\ninternal dissensions, by a disorganized army and by a navy so small\r\nthat it might almost have been regarded as not in existence.  Yet it\r\nwas this very navy which did most for {346} America in the struggle,\r\nand dealt England the most staggering blows inflicted upon her\r\nsupremacy of the sea.  The most shameful episode of the whole unhappy\r\ncampaign was when the English General Ross captured Washington, and, in\r\nobedience to infamous orders from home, burned the Capitol and other\r\npublic buildings.  No more disgraceful act stains the history of the\r\ntime.  It proved as impossible for England to defend as for America to\r\nforget.  The war ended at last, after the commerce of both countries\r\nhad been gravely injured, in a grotesque treaty of peace, signed at\r\nGhent, in which the principal cause of the war, the impressment of\r\nAmerican sailors by English ships, was not even alluded to.  But as the\r\nimpressment was abandoned by England, the war had not been waged wholly\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nIn the year that followed upon the Battle of Waterloo, Sheridan died.\r\nHe had outlived by ten years his great contemporaries Pitt and Fox, by\r\nnearly twenty years his greatest contemporary Burke, and by more than\r\nthirty years his great contemporary Johnson.  The pompous funeral that\r\ncarried his remains to Westminster Abbey was the funeral not merely of\r\na man but of an age.  He was almost the last of the great heroic\r\nfigures that made the eighteenth century famous.  He had long outlived\r\nall the friends, heroes, rivals of his glorious prime: he could talk to\r\nthe children of the dawning century of Johnson, and Goldsmith, and Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds; of Burke, and Pitt, and Fox; of poets and painters,\r\nplayers, and politicians, who seemed to his listeners to belong to a\r\ndeparted Age of Gold.  Two years later, in the November of 1818,\r\nEngland, and indeed the whole civilized world, received a sudden and\r\npainful shock by the death, under conditions peculiarly harrowing, of\r\nSir Samuel Romilly, the great lawyer, social reformer, and\r\nphilanthropist.  Romilly had been deeply attached to his wife, and on\r\nher death in October of that year, it would seem that he must have lost\r\nhis reason, for, in the following month, he committed suicide.  Romilly\r\nwas a man of the highest principles, and the most austere conscience,\r\nand although the loss of his much-loved wife must have made the world\r\nbut a mere {347} ruin to him, it is not believed that, if his mind had\r\nnot suddenly given away, he would have done himself to death with his\r\nown hand.  To Napoleon, then fretting in exile in St. Helena, the deed\r\nappeared to be one curiously characteristic of the English people.\r\n\"The English character is superior to ours.  Conceive Romilly, one of\r\nthe leaders of a great party, committing suicide at fifty because he\r\nhad lost his wife.  They are in everything more practical than we are;\r\nthey emigrate, they marry, they kill themselves with less indecision\r\nthan we display in going to the opera.\"  Napoleon was wrong in his\r\nestimate of Romilly's age.  Romilly was sixty-one when he died.  He was\r\none of the greatest legal and social reformers of his age.  His father\r\nwas a Huguenot watchmaker who had settled in London, and the young\r\nSamuel Romilly had only an imperfect education to begin with.  By\r\nintense study he became possessed of wide and varied culture.  He\r\nstudied for the bar, became distinguished in Chancery practice, made\r\nhis way in public life, sat in the House of Commons for several years,\r\nand finally represented Westminster.  During successive visits to\r\nFrance he had made the acquaintance of Diderot and D'Alembert, and\r\nbecame the friend of Mirabeau.  He won a noble fame by his persistent\r\nendeavors to mitigate the cruelties of the criminal laws, to introduce\r\nthe principles of a free country into political prosecutions, to\r\nabolish the odious spy system, and to put an end to slavery at home and\r\nabroad.  His name will be remembered forever in the history of\r\npolitical and social reform.\r\n\r\nThe Houses of Death and of Birth were busy for the royal family in the\r\nclosing scenes of the King's tragedy.  There had been very little\r\nhappiness for George the Third in his long reign and his longer life.\r\nHis childhood had been darkened by the shadow of a family feud that\r\nseemed traditional in his line.  His marriage, indeed, fortunate if\r\nunromantic, the sequel of more than one unfortunate romance, gave him a\r\ncompanion whose tastes were as simple, and whose purposes were as\r\nupright as his own.  But his private domesticity was not destined to be\r\nless troubled than his public fortunes.  The grim tradition asserted\r\n{348} itself again for him whose childhood and manhood had been only\r\ntoo devoted to the influence of his mother.  Few of his children were a\r\ncause of joy to him; some were a source of very poignant sorrow.  He\r\nmight have known content in a private station under conditions better\r\nfitted to strengthen his virtues and to lessen the force of his\r\ndefects.  If Farmer George had really been but Farmer George, his\r\nexistence might tranquilly have followed the courses of the seasons\r\nthrough a prosperous manhood to a peaceable old age.  But the curse of\r\nkingship was upon him very heavily, and his later years are very\r\npitiful in their loneliness and their pain.  Of the course of events\r\nabout him he, in the awful visitation of his infirmities, had long been\r\nunconscious.  Blind and deaf and mad, he seems to have been haunted by\r\nthe ghastly fancy that he was already dead.  \"I must have a suit of\r\nblack,\" he is reported to have said, \"in memory of George the Third,\r\nfor whom I know there is a general mourning.\"  George the Third was\r\ndead in life, and about him those he loved were dying fast.  On\r\nNovember 6, 1817, the Princess Charlotte died, the only child of the\r\nPrince Regent.  She was very popular, was in the direct succession to\r\nthe throne; she hoped to be queen, and many shared her hope.  The\r\nprisoner of St. Helena believed that in her lay his best chance of\r\nliberation.  She married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg on May 2, 1816,\r\nand died after giving birth to a still-born child in the following\r\nyear.  She was not quite twenty-two years old.  The news of her death\r\ngreatly affected the old queen, her grandmother.  Her health, that had\r\nlong been weak, grew weaker, and she died on November 17, 1818.  She\r\nhad lived her simple, honest, narrow, upright life for seventy-four\r\nyears.  On May 24, 1819, a daughter was born to the Duchess of Kent,\r\nthe wife of Edward, Duke of Kent, the fourth son of George the Third.\r\nOn January 23, 1820, the Duke of Kent died.  Six days later the King\r\nceased to exist.  He was in the eighty-second year of his age and the\r\nsixtieth year of his reign.  The most devoted loyalist could not have\r\nwished for the unhappy King another hour of life.  \"Vex not his ghost\r\nO!  Let {349} him pass; he hates him that would upon the rack of this\r\nrough world stretch him out longer.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760-1820--Progress under George the Third]\r\n\r\nThe reign that had ended was certainly the longest and perhaps the most\r\nremarkable then known to English history.  The King's granddaughter,\r\nthe Princess Victoria, born so short a time before his death, was\r\ndestined to a reign at once longer and more remarkable than the reign\r\nof George the Third.  The England of 1820 was not nearly so far removed\r\nfrom the England of 1760 as the England of the last year of the\r\nnineteenth century was removed from 1837.  But the changes that took\r\nplace in England in the sixty years of the reign of the third George\r\nwere changes of vast moment and vast importance.  If England's\r\npolitical fortunes fell and rose in startling contrast, the progress of\r\ncivilization was steady and significant.  The social England of 1820\r\nwas widely different from the social England of 1760.  The advance of\r\npopulation, the growth of great towns, the increase of means of\r\nintercourse between one part of the country and another by highways and\r\nwaterways, the engineering triumphs that bridged rivers and cut canals,\r\nthe marvels of industrial invention that facilitated labor, the patient\r\npains of science on the edge of great discoveries, the slowly\r\nincreasing spirit of toleration, pity, and humanity, the gradual spread\r\nof education, the widening realms of knowledge, the increasing\r\nappreciation of the decencies and amenities of life--all these things\r\nmake the reign of George the Third the hopeful preface to the reign of\r\ngreater length, greater glory, greater promise and greater fulfilment\r\nthat was to dawn when two more sovereigns of the House of Hanover had\r\nceased to reign over England.  If George the Third had been a wiser man\r\nhis reign would have been happier for the country he ruled; but the\r\ncountry at least was happy in this, that he was, as kings went, and\r\naccording to his lights, a good man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE THIRD VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{350}\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abernethy, Dr., death, iv. 282.\r\n  Act for better securing the Dependency of Ireland, i. 177.\r\n  Act of Settlement, i. 4.\r\n  Act of Union passed, iii. 327, 330.\r\n  Acts of Trade, iii. 82, 84, 86, 105.\r\n  Adams, John:\r\n    Conduct towards Colonel Preston, iii. 152.\r\n    Opposes dominion of England, iii. 85.\r\n  Adams, Samuel, protests against Stamp Act, iii. 90.\r\n  Addington, Henry, Viscount Sidmouth, Prime Minister, iii. 337.\r\n  Addison, Joseph:\r\n    M.
