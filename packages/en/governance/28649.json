In February, the\r\nRussian Ambassador left London, the Guards were despatched to the\r\nEast, and the Russian Government was peremptorily called upon by Great\r\nBritain and France to evacuate the Principalities. The Peace Party,\r\nBright, Cobden, and others, were active, but unheeded; the Society of\r\nFriends sending a pacific but futile deputation to the Czar. In March,\r\nthe demand for evacuation being disregarded, war was declared, and a\r\ntreaty of alliance signed between England and France; Lord Raglan and\r\nMarshal St Arnaud were appointed to command the respective armies,\r\nVice-Admiral Sir James Dundas and Sir Charles Napier having command\r\nof the Mediterranean and Baltic Fleets respectively. The attitude of\r\nAustria was ambiguous, and, after England and France were committed to\r\nwar, she contracted an offensive and defensive alliance with Prussia,\r\neach country engaging to make limited preparations for war. At home,\r\nwith a view to greater efficiency, the duties of the Secretary\r\nof State for War and the Colonies, till then united in a single\r\nSecretaryship, were divided, the Duke of Newcastle assuming the former\r\noffice, while Sir George Grey became Colonial Secretary; Lord John\r\nRussell also resumed office as President of the Council. The Russians\r\nwere unsuccessful in their operations against the Turks, notably at\r\nSilistria and Giurgevo, while, as the summer advanced, public opinion\r\nin support of an invasion of the Crimea rose steadily, the _Times_\r\nindicated the taking of Sebastopol as indispensable, and Lord\r\nAberdeen's hand was forced. On the 28th of June, the Cabinet\r\nsanctioned a despatch to Lord Raglan, urging (almost to the point of\r\ndirecting) an immediate attack upon Sebastopol; the French Emperor\r\nwas in favour of the plan, though both Commanders-in-Chief entertained\r\ndoubt as to whether it was immediately feasible. On the 7th of\r\nSeptember, the allied forces (58,000 strong) sailed from Varna, a\r\nlanding being effected a few days later at Old Fort, near Eupatoria;\r\nat about the same time an important interview took place at Boulogne\r\nbetween Prince Albert and the Emperor Napoleon. The signal victory at\r\nthe Alma, on the 20th of September, was followed by the death of St\r\nArnaud, and the appointment of Canrobert as his successor. Decisive\r\nsuccesses were next obtained at Balaklava on the 25th of October, and\r\nat Inkerman on the 5th of November; but on the 14th a fierce gale did\r\nimmense damage to life and property, both at Balaklava and on the\r\nsea. Meanwhile, indignation at home was aroused by the tidings of\r\nthe breakdown of the commissariat and transport departments, and the\r\ndeplorable state of the hospitals; Miss Florence Nightingale, who had\r\nsailed from England with a number of nurses, arrived at Scutari early\r\nin November, and proceeded to remedy deficiencies as far as possible;\r\nwhile Lord John Russell vainly urged on the Premier the substitution\r\nof Lord Palmerston for the Duke of Newcastle as Secretary for War.\r\nSir Charles Napier, who, previously to his departure with the Baltic\r\nFleet, had been fêted at the Reform Club, and extravagantly lauded\r\nby Cabinet Ministers, was by the month of October engaged in a\r\nrecriminatory correspondence with the First Lord of the Admiralty.\r\nAt about the same time the Patriotic Fund was established under the\r\npresidency of Prince Albert.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament, the last vestige of the old Navigation System, limiting\r\nthe coasting trade to British ships, was repealed, and a Bill also\r\npassed for preventing corrupt practices at elections. Owing to the\r\nwar, the Reform Bill was withdrawn, Lord John Russell, on announcing\r\nthe fact in Parliament, being overcome, and giving way to tears.\r\nIn the short session, which took place during the latter half of\r\nDecember, a Foreign Enlistment Act was passed, providing for a force\r\nof 10,000 foreigners, to be drilled in this country.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition Building, which had been constructed in Hyde Park\r\nin 1851, and had been re-erected at Sydenham, was opened with great\r\nceremony by the Queen, and was henceforth known as the Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n1854\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _6th January 1854._\r\n\r\nLORD ABERDEEN presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He cannot\r\nwonder at the indignation expressed by your Majesty at the base and\r\ninfamous attacks made upon the Prince during the last two or three\r\nweeks in some of the daily papers.[1] They are chiefly to be found in\r\nthose papers which represent ultra-Tory or extreme Radical opinions;\r\nbut they are not sanctioned by the most respectable portion of the\r\nPress. Lord Aberdeen has received some information respecting the\r\norigin of these attacks; but it is vague and uncertain. At all events\r\nhe believes that your Majesty may safely make yourself at ease upon\r\nthe subject, as he is satisfied that these hostile feelings are shared\r\nby few. It is much to be desired that some notice of the subject may\r\nbe taken in Parliament, when, by being treated in a proper manner,\r\nit may be effectually stopped. Lord Aberdeen has spoken to Lord\r\nJohn Russell, who will be quite prepared to moot it in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the position of the Prince is somewhat\r\nanomalous, and has not been specially provided for by the Constitution;\r\nbut the ties of Nature, and the dictates of common sense are more\r\npowerful than Constitutional fictions; and Lord Aberdeen can only say\r\nthat he has always considered it an inestimable blessing that your\r\nMajesty should possess so able, so zealous, and so disinterested an\r\nadviser. It is true that your Ministers are alone responsible for the\r\nconduct of public affairs, and although there is no man in England whose\r\nopinion Lord Aberdeen would more highly respect and value, still if he\r\nhad the misfortune of differing from His Royal Highness, he would not\r\nhesitate to act according to his own convictions, and a sense of what\r\nwas due to your Majesty's service.\r\n\r\nThe Prince has now been so long before the eyes of the whole country,\r\nhis conduct so invariably devoted to the public good, and his life\r\nso perfectly inattackable, that Lord Aberdeen has not the slightest\r\napprehension of any serious consequences arising from these\r\ncontemptible exhibitions of malevolence and faction.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will graciously pardon Lord Aberdeen for writing thus\r\nplainly; but there are occasions on which he almost forgets your\r\nMajesty's station, and only remembers those feelings which are common\r\nto all ranks of mankind.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: A section of the Press, favourable to Lord\r\n    Palmerston, had insinuated that his resignation was due to\r\n    \"an influence behind the throne.\" Similar attacks were made\r\n    by other journals, and not abandoned upon Lord Palmerston's\r\n    re-admission to the Cabinet: the most extravagant charges of\r\n    improper interference in State affairs were made against the\r\n    Prince, and it was even rumoured that he had been impeached\r\n    for high treason and committed to the Tower! The cartoons\r\n    in _Punch_ usually present a faithful reflection of current\r\n    popular opinion, and in one of them the Prince was depicted as\r\n    skating, in defiance of warning, over dangerous ice.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PERSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _9th January 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen thanks Lord Clarendon for his letter just received with the\r\nenclosures.\r\n\r\nAs the proposed answer to the Emperor contains perhaps necessarily\r\nonly a repetition of what the Queen wrote in her former letter,[2] she\r\ninclines to the opinion that it will be best to defer any answer for\r\nthe present--the more so, as a moment might possibly arrive when\r\nit would be of advantage to be able to write and to refer to the\r\nEmperor's last letter.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Persian Expedition[3] the Queen will not object\r\nto it--as the Cabinet appears to have fully considered the matter, but\r\nshe must say that she does not much like it in a moral point of view.\r\nWe are just putting the Emperor of Russia under the ban for trying\r\n\"to bring the Sultan to his senses\" by the occupation of part of his\r\nterritory after a diplomatic rupture, and are now going to do exactly\r\nthe same thing to the Shah of Persia!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: See _ante_, vol. ii, 18th October-26th November,\r\n    1853, notes 30, 31, 32.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Under the belief that Persia had declared war\r\n    against Turkey, and that diplomatic relations between England\r\n    and Persia were suspended, the Cabinet had agreed upon the\r\n    occupation of the Island of Karak by a British force.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _9th January 1854._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I wrote you a most abominable scrawl on Friday,\r\nand think myself justified in boring you with a few words to-day.\r\n\r\nThe plot is thickening in every direction, and we may expect a great\r\nconfusion. The dear old Duke used to say \"You cannot have a little\r\nwar.\" The great politicians of the Press think differently. The Duke\r\ntold me also once: \"At the place where you are you will always have\r\nthe power to force people to go to war.\" I have used that power to\r\n_avoid_ complications, and I still think, blessed are the peacemakers.\r\n\r\nHow the Emperor could get himself and everybody else into this\r\ninfernal scrape is quite incomprehensible; the more so as I remain\r\nconvinced that he did not aim at conquest. We have very mild weather,\r\nand though you liked the cold, still for every purpose we must prefer\r\nwarmth. Many hundred boats with coal are frozen up, and I am told that\r\nnear two hundred ships are wanting to arrive at Antwerp....\r\n\r\nI am much plagued also by little parliamentary nonsense of our own\r\nhere, a storm in a bottle; this is the way of human kind, and in such\r\ncases it always pleases me to think that I am not bound to be always\r\ntheir working slave, and I cast a sly look at my beautiful villa on\r\nthe Lake of Como, _quite furnished_.... My beloved Victoria. Your\r\ndevoted Uncle.\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRESS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE FRENCH ALLIANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _13th January 1854._\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED VICTORIA,--I grieve to see how unjustly you are plagued,\r\nand how wonderfully untrue and passionate are the attacks of part\r\nof the Press. Abuse is somewhat the _staff of life in England_,\r\neverything, everybody is to be abused; it is a pity, as nothing\r\nmore unproductive as this everlasting abuse can well be imagined. As\r\nnothing ever gave the slightest opening to this abuse, it is to be\r\nhoped that it will be soon got over--the meeting of Parliament will\r\nnow do good in this respect. As far as your few continental relations\r\nare concerned, I don't think they will be able to fix anything upon\r\nyour faithful servant. I have done England at all times good services,\r\nin the sense of her best interests. I hold a position of great\r\ngeographical importance for England, just opposite the mouth of the\r\nThames. Successes of vanity I am never fishing for in England,\r\nnor anywhere else. The only influence I may exercise is to prevent\r\nmischief where I can, which occasionally succeeds; if war can be\r\navoided, and the same ends obtained, it is natural _that_ THAT _should\r\nbe tried first_. Many English superficial newspaper politicians\r\nimagine that threatening is the thing--I believe it the worst of all\r\nsystems. The Emperor Nicholas and Menschikoff wanted by threatening\r\nthe Turks to get certain things, and they have by that means got a\r\nvery troublesome and expensive affair on their hands. I wish England\r\ntoo well to like to see it, but one of these days they will get into\r\nsome scrape in the same way. The foolish accusation that we are doing\r\nall we can to break up the French Alliance is certainly the _most\r\nabsurd of all_; if anything can be for our local advantage, it is to\r\nsee England and France closely allied, and for a long period--for ever\r\nI should say....\r\n\r\nI have heard, and that from the Prussian Quarter, that great efforts\r\nare making on the part of Russia, to _gain over_ Louis Napoleon. I\r\nunderstand, however, that though Louis Napoleon is _not_ anxious for\r\nwar, that his opinion is favourable to the continuation of a good\r\nunderstanding with England. That it should be so is, I must say,\r\nhighly desirable. The poor Orleans will be grieved and hurt by all\r\nthese things. The death of the child of the poor Queen of Spain will\r\nnot be a favourable omen for Spain.[4]...\r\n\r\nWith my best love to Albert. Believe me ever, my beloved Victoria,\r\nyour truly devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: A daughter had been born to the Queen of Spain on\r\n    the 5th of January, and lived only three days.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ORLEANS FAMILY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _16th January 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends the answer she has this morning received from the Duc\r\nde Nemours, which she hopes is on the whole satisfactory as regards\r\nthe reported visit of the Count de Chambord.[5] The Duke does not see\r\nin so strong a light as _we_ do, the danger of even the _report_ being\r\nbelieved--probably from living so much out of the world as he does.\r\nWhat would Lord Aberdeen wish her to do farther, and what does he\r\nthink can be done in the way of contradiction? The Queen wishes\r\nlikewise to have Lord Aberdeen's opinion and advice on the following\r\nsubjects. He knows that we have invariably received the poor Orleans\r\nfamily (in particular our own near relations, the Nemours) from time\r\nto time _here_ and in London, and that the Queen has _always_ from\r\nthe first year done this _openly_ but _unostentatiously_. It is by _no\r\nmeans_ her intention to change her conduct in this respect--but since\r\nthe great noise caused by the \"fusion\" she thought it better _not_\r\nto invite the Nemours either to Osborne or here, hoping that by\r\n_this time_ these tiresome rumours would have ceased. They have not,\r\nhowever, and we think that perhaps it would be wiser _not_ to see them\r\nhere, _at any rate_ till after the meeting of Parliament, though it is\r\nvery painful to the Queen to hurt their feelings by apparent neglect.\r\nIs Lord Aberdeen of this opinion, and does he think that it will _not_\r\nbe misconstrued into an _admission_ of having encouraged _intrigues_\r\nor of _submission_ to the will and pleasure of Louis Napoleon?\r\n\r\nFor the Queen would never submit to such an accusation, nor would she\r\ncontinue (after the excitement is past) to exclude these poor exiles\r\nfrom occasional visits--which have been paid and received ever since\r\n_'48_, and which would be unworthy and ungenerous conduct.\r\n\r\nLikewise does Lord Aberdeen think that a morning visit to the Duchess\r\nof Aumale to enquire after her health would be imprudent?\r\n\r\nIt goes much against the Queen's feelings of generosity and kindness\r\nto neglect the poor exiles as she has done this winter, but the\r\npresent moment is one of _unparalleled_ excitement and of\r\ngreat political importance, which requires great prudence and\r\ncircumspection. There is an admirable article in the _Morning\r\nChronicle_ of to-day, taking quite the _right line_ upon the infamous\r\nand _now_ almost ridiculous attacks on the _Queen_ and Prince. Has\r\nLord Aberdeen any idea who could have written it?\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends a letter she had received from her Uncle, which\r\nmay amuse and interest him. To make the statement of the Queen's\r\nintercourse with the Orleans family quite clear, she should add, that\r\nwhen the family visit the Queen or she visits them, that it is put\r\ninto the Court Circular, and this of course gets copied into country\r\npapers and foreign papers; but after consideration the Queen thought\r\nthis the wiser course, for with all the spies who are no doubt\r\nabout--if this were not done, and the Queen's visits and _vice versâ_\r\nwere suppressed and _yet_ found out--it would give them an air of\r\n_mystery_ which is just what we wish to avoid.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Son of the Duc de Berri, and known formerly as\r\n    the Duc de Bordeaux.

With respect to your Majesty's custom of seeing the French Royal\r\nFamily, Lord Aberdeen humbly thinks that there is no good reason\r\nfor making any change. It has always taken place without parade or\r\nostentation; and knowing, as Lord Aberdeen does, that no political\r\nobject is in view, he would feel ashamed to advise your Majesty to do\r\nanything at variance with that sympathy which your Majesty has been\r\ncareful to keep within the bounds of prudence and moderation....\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen hopes that he may venture to congratulate your Majesty\r\non the commencement of a change with respect to the newspaper attacks\r\nupon the Prince. He observed the article, to which your Majesty\r\nrefers, in the _Morning Chronicle_ of yesterday; and he believes he\r\nmay certainly say that it was written by Mr Gladstone, although he\r\nwould not wish it to be known. There was also a very sensible letter\r\nin the _Standard_ of last night, signed D. C. L. This is the signature\r\nalways assumed by Mr Alexander Hope,[6] in his contributions to the\r\nPress, and Lord Aberdeen does not doubt that it is written by him.\r\nIt is only a wonder to find it in such a quarter; and it shows some\r\ndisposition on the part of that scurrilous paper to alter its course.\r\nThere is perhaps no great objection to the papers dealing with the\r\nsubject as they think proper, before the meeting of Parliament,\r\nprovided the _Times_ takes no part at present; for as this paper is\r\nsupposed to be influenced by the Government, this belief would injure\r\nthe effect of anything that might appear in its columns.[7]...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Mr. A. J. Hope (afterwards Beresford-Hope), at\r\n    this time out of Parliament, had written over the signature\r\n    \"D.C.L.\" a series of letters to the Press on the Papal\r\n    claims.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: On the re-assembling of Parliament, the charges\r\n    against the Prince were at once refuted by the Prime Minister\r\n    and Lord John Russell; and his right to assist the Queen\r\n    completely established by those Ministers, with the\r\n    concurrence of Lord Derby and Mr Walpole, on behalf of the\r\n    Opposition, and Lord Campbell, the Chief Justice of the\r\n    Queen's Bench.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE REFORM BILL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _21st January 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of the 19th, and the\r\nBill as now agreed upon by the Cabinet, which she hopes may meet the\r\nwishes of the Country and pass into law.[8] From what she understands\r\nthe chief argument used in opposition to the measure will be, that\r\ncorruption and bribery is the evil which the Country really complains\r\nof, and not an unequal distribution of the representation, and that a\r\nnew distribution or even extension of the franchise will not touch\r\nthe evil, and may be said perhaps in some instances to tend towards\r\nincreasing it. The success of the measure will therefore, she\r\nconcludes, in some degree depend upon the Bribery Bills which will\r\naccompany it. How far are these advanced? and what expectation has\r\nLord John Russell of succeeding in framing such a measure as would\r\nremove that ground of objection to the Reform Bill?\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Notwithstanding the impending war, the Government\r\n    considered itself bound in honour to bring in a Reform Bill.\r\n    Lord Palmerston and his special supporters were opposed to the\r\n    project, but the measure was brought forward on the 13th of\r\n    February. After a chequered career it was withdrawn. The\r\n    Bill for the prevention of corrupt practices at elections\r\n    was introduced on the 10th of February, and after many\r\n    vicissitudes and several Ministerial defeats in the Commons as\r\n    well as in the Lords, it was, in a modified form, carried.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Mr Gladstone._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _7th February 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen must apologise for having kept the enclosed papers so long,\r\nand in now sending them back she does so without feeling sure in\r\nher mind that she could with safety sanction Mr Gladstone's new and\r\nimportant proposal.[9] The change it implies will be very great in\r\nprinciple and irretrievable, and the Queen must say that Lord John\r\nRussell's apprehensions as to the spirit it is likely to engender\r\namongst the future civil servants of the Crown have excited a\r\nsimilar feeling in her mind. Where is moreover the application of the\r\nprinciple of public competition to stop, if once established? and must\r\nnot those offices which are to be exempted from it necessarily degrade\r\nthe persons appointed to them in public estimation?\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Mr Gladstone had written on the 26th of January\r\n    on the subject of competitive examinations for the Civil\r\n    Service; in reply to the Queen's letter, he referred to\r\n    the discontent existing in the Service with the system of\r\n    appointment by favour, and of promotion by seniority alone.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BALTIC COMMAND]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR CHARLES NAPIER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY, _9th February 1854._\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, with humble duty, begs to lay before your Majesty\r\ncertain important considerations which were discussed at the Cabinet\r\nyesterday with respect to the selection of a Commander-in-Chief for\r\nthe Fleet about to be appointed for Service in the Baltic.[10]...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: War had not yet been declared, but the Russian\r\n    Ambassador left London on the 7th of February, and Sir\r\n    Hamilton Seymour was recalled from St Petersburg on the same\r\n    day.]\r\n\r\nLord Dundonald[11] is seventy-nine years of age; and though his\r\nenergies and faculties are unbroken, and though, with his accustomed\r\ncourage, he volunteers for the Service, yet, on the whole, there is\r\nreason to apprehend that he might deeply commit the Force under his\r\ncommand in some desperate enterprise, where the chances of\r\nsuccess would not countervail the risk of failure and of the fatal\r\nconsequences, which might ensue. Age has not abated the adventurous\r\nspirit of this gallant officer, which no authority could restrain; and\r\nbeing uncontrollable it might lead to most unfortunate results. The\r\nCabinet, on the most careful review of the entire question, decided\r\nthat the appointment of Lord Dundonald was not expedient....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: This was the Lord Cochrane who had been unjustly\r\n    convicted in 1814, under the direction of Lord Ellenborough,\r\n    Chief Justice, of conspiracy to defraud.

He is said to have stipulated,\r\n    on this occasion, that he should be allowed to destroy\r\n    Cronstadt by a chemical process invented by himself.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles Napier is an excellent seaman, and combines boldness with\r\ndiscretion.[12] He has served in large squadrons, and he has commanded\r\nthem. As a Second, he may not have been submissive; as a Chief, he has\r\nbeen successful in command. His appointment will give confidence both\r\nto officers and men; and his name is not unknown both to enemies and\r\nallies. If he has the faults of his family, he is not without their\r\nvirtues; courage, genius, love of country are not wanting; and the\r\nweighty responsibilities of high command, without oppressing him,\r\nwould give steadiness to his demeanour.\r\n\r\nHe behaved ill to Lord John Russell and to Sir Francis Baring; and on\r\nshore he has given just cause of complaint; but at sea and in command\r\nhe is a different person; and Lord John Russell in the Cabinet\r\nyesterday, regardless of all former displeasure, pronounced an opinion\r\nfavourable to the appointment of Sir Charles Napier. Lord Aberdeen,\r\nalso, together with the entire Cabinet, came to the same conclusion;\r\nand Sir James Graham on their behalf, and in concurrence with his own\r\nopinion, ventures to ask the permission of your Majesty to appoint Sir\r\nCharles Napier to this important Naval command.[13]\r\n\r\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's dutiful Subject and\r\nServant,\r\n\r\nJ.

The Queen, although not without considerable\r\nmisgivings, sanctions the proposed plan, trusting that Mr Gladstone\r\nwill do what he can, in the arrangements of the details of it, to\r\nguard against the dangers, which she has pointed out in her former\r\nletter and through the Prince when he saw Mr Gladstone. A check,\r\nfor instance, would be necessary upon the admission of candidates\r\nto compete for employment, securing that they should be otherwise\r\neligible, besides the display of knowledge which they may exhibit\r\nunder examination. Without this a young man might be very ineligible,\r\nand still after having been proclaimed to the world as first in\r\nability, it would require very strong evidence of misconduct to\r\njustify his exclusion by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Gladstone to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _17th February 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer presents his humble duty to your\r\nMajesty, and has the honour to acknowledge your Majesty's gracious\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nHe takes blame to himself for having caused your Majesty trouble by\r\nomitting to include in his short memorandum an explanation of the\r\nphrase \"qualified persons.\"\r\n\r\nExperience at the universities and public schools of this country has\r\nshown that in a large majority of cases the test of open examination\r\nis also an effectual test of character; as, except in very remarkable\r\ncases, the previous industry and self-denial, which proficiency\r\nevinces, are rarely separated from general habits of virtue.\r\n\r\nBut he humbly assures your Majesty that the utmost pains will be\r\ntaken to provide not only for the majority but for all cases, by the\r\nstrictest enquiries of which the case will admit; and he has the most\r\nconfident belief that the securities for character under the\r\nsystem, although they cannot be unerring, will be stronger and more\r\ntrustworthy than any of which the present method of appointment is\r\nsusceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _21st February 1854._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--... War is, I fear, _quite_ inevitable. You will\r\nhave seen that the Emperor Nicholas has not given a favourable\r\nanswer to _our Brother_ Napoleon (which I hear has disappointed him\r\nextremely, as he expected very great results from it); and the last\r\nproposals or attempts made by Buol[14] it is to be hoped will not be\r\naccepted by Russia, for France and England could _not_ accept them;\r\nbut if Austria and Prussia go with us--as we hope they will--the War\r\nwill only be a local one. Our beautiful Guards sail to-morrow.\r\nAlbert inspected them yesterday. George is quite delighted to have a\r\ndivision....\r\n\r\nI must now conclude, with Albert's affectionate love. Believe me\r\nalways, your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: Austrian Premier and Minister of Foreign\r\n    Affairs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BRITISH ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _24th February 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen must write to Lord Aberdeen on a subject which at this\r\nmoment appears to her of paramount importance--viz., the augmentation\r\nof the Army. The ten thousand men by which it has been ordered to be\r\naugmented can hardly be considered to have brought it up to more than\r\nan improved PEACE _establishment_, such as we have often had during\r\nprofound peace in Europe; but even these ten thousand men are not\r\nyet obtained. We have nearly pledged ourselves to sending twenty-five\r\nthousand men to the East, and this pledge will have to be redeemed.\r\nTo keep even such a force up in the field will require a strong,\r\navailable reserve at home, of which we shall be quite denuded. But we\r\nare going to make war upon Russia! encouraging Austria and Prussia to\r\ndo so likewise, whereby we assume a moral obligation not to leave them\r\nwithout assistance. We engage in a War which may assume in its course\r\na totally different character from that of its beginning. Who can say\r\nit is impossible that our own shores may be threatened by powers now\r\nin alliance with us? We are powerless for offence or defence without\r\na _trained_ Army; to obtain this will require considerable time. The\r\nQueen must, therefore, urge Lord Aberdeen to consider with the Cabinet\r\nwhether it will not be essential to augment the Army at once, and by\r\nat least thirty thousand men. Considerations of home policy make this\r\nalso advisable; the country is eager for War at this moment, and ready\r\nto grant men and money. It will be a great facility hereafter to have\r\nobtained what is most needed at first. If the force should finally not\r\nbe wanted, retrenchments may very easily be made. The Crown should\r\nat least have the power of raising the men without the necessity for\r\nfurther application to Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BRITISH ULTIMATUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _26th February 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, with his humble duty, begs to inform your Majesty that\r\nanother Cabinet was held to-day, in order to consider the draft of\r\na letter which it is proposed that Lord Clarendon should address to\r\nCount Nesselrode, and in which he should summon the Russian Government\r\nto evacuate the Principalities. The messenger will be directed to wait\r\nsix days for an answer, and the British Government will consider\r\nthe refusal or the silence of Count Nesselrode as equivalent to a\r\ndeclaration of War, and proceed to act accordingly.[15]\r\n\r\nAn assurance has been received, in general terms, of the intention\r\nof Austria to support this demand; and a telegraphic message has been\r\nsent to Vienna with a desire to know whether the Austrian Government\r\nwill join in this summons, or in what manner support will be\r\ngiven.[16] No answer has yet been received, and Lord Aberdeen would\r\nthink it right not to make the summons until Austria has declared her\r\nintention; but the Cabinet appears to desire that the letter should be\r\nsent to-morrow evening.\r\n\r\nThe period fixed for the complete evacuation of the Principalities is\r\nthe 30th of April.\r\n\r\nAs it cannot be supposed that the Emperor of Russia will listen to\r\nsuch a demand as this, immediate hostilities must be expected, with\r\nall their consequences.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: This summons to evacuate the Principalities, and\r\n    an ultimatum to a similar purport from Paris, were delivered\r\n    to the Czar on the 14th of March; on their receipt the Czar\r\n    intimated that he did not think it fitting (_convenable_) that\r\n    he should make any reply.

The Austrian\r\n    Government accordingly announced its intention of acting as\r\n    circumstances might dictate, but subsequently limited the\r\n    assistance which it now expressed itself willing to give\r\n    to England and France in insisting upon the evacuation, to\r\n    diplomatic support.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _26th February 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of this day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to form a judgment on the important question to which it\r\nrefers, the Queen would require to be furnished with the exact terms\r\nof \"the general assurance\" which Austria has given with respect to it.\r\nThe Queen, however, does not doubt for a moment that the gain of a day\r\nor two in making the summons to Russia could not be compared to the\r\nadvantage of being able to make the summons conjointly with Austria.\r\nShe must therefore wish that the answer to the telegraphic message\r\nshould be awaited before the messenger is sent off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEPARTURE OF THE GUARDS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _28th February 1854._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--... The news from Austria are quite excellent,\r\nand much more than we had any reason to expect. It will make a great\r\ndifference in the nature and duration of the War. Our summons to\r\nRussia went last night _viâ_ Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, and if they\r\nare received either with silence, or the Emperor refuses to evacuate\r\nthe Principalities--_War_ will be considered as declared. The French\r\nsend a similar summons. The messenger is to wait _six_ days for an\r\nanswer, but no longer.\r\n\r\nThe last battalion of the Guards (Scots Fusiliers) embarked to-day.\r\nThey passed through the courtyard here at seven o'clock this morning.\r\nWe stood on the balcony to see them--the morning fine, the sun\r\nrising over the towers of old Westminster Abbey--and an immense crowd\r\ncollected to see these fine men, and cheering them immensely as they\r\nwith difficulty marched along. They formed line, presented arms,\r\nand then cheered us _very heartily_, and went off cheering. It was a\r\n_touching and beautiful_ sight; many sorrowing friends were there, and\r\none saw the shake of many a hand. My best wishes and prayers will be\r\nwith them all....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\n[_Undated._]\r\n\r\nThe Queen was rather annoyed at the manner in which Lord Clarendon\r\npressed the Duke of Cambridge's going to the Tuileries last night.[17]\r\nShe thought it an immense boon upon her part to allow the Duke of\r\nCambridge _to go to Paris_--and instead of its being considered as\r\nsuch by Lord Clarendon and Count Walewski, the Queen was told it would\r\noffend the Emperor if the Duke did not go to the Tuileries also. The\r\nQueen observed that it was unnecessary and unusual for the Duke, or\r\nany Prince almost, to live at the _Palace_ of the Sovereign, unless he\r\nwas a very particular friend or near relation. The Duke of Genoa had\r\nrefused going there, though he had received other civilities here; in\r\nthe same manner _no Prince_ comes to this _Palace_ unless he is a very\r\n_near relation_ or particular friend. To this Lord Clarendon replied\r\nthat it was \"because the _Emperor wished_ it,\" which rather shocked\r\nthe Queen, and she spoke _strongly_ to him upon the subject. The\r\nresult was that the Queen said she would speak to the Duke of\r\nCambridge about it, and see, as the Emperor made _so great a point of\r\nit_, and Lord Clarendon considered that the _Alliance depended upon\r\nit_, what he would do....\r\n\r\nThe Queen must and _will_ protest, for she cannot mix up personal\r\nfriendship with a political Alliance. The former is the _result_ of\r\nthe _experience_ of years of mutual friendship, and cannot be _carried\r\nby storm_....\r\n\r\nThere would be nothing unusual in apartments being offered to the Duke\r\nof Cambridge, and declined by him. This was done by the King of the\r\nBelgians only last summer at Berlin and Vienna, without anybody's\r\nconstruing it into an affront. The Queen adds a list of the Royal\r\npersonages who have been in England and never resided at the Palace.\r\nLord Aberdeen may show this letter to Lord Clarendon.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The Duke was going to the Crimea, and it was\r\n    arranged that he should stop at Paris on the way.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: STABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st March 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge Lord John Russell's letter of this\r\nmorning. Much as she must regret the postponement of the second\r\nreading of the Reform Bill, she must admit its wisdom under the\r\npresent peculiar circumstances;[18] but she doubts the advantage\r\nof naming a precise day after Easter on which it is to come on.\r\nConsidering the _importance_ to the country of _preserving_ the\r\npresent Government and of not allowing it to be beat on so vital a\r\nquestion, the opportunity should not be lost of ascertaining the state\r\nof feeling both in the House of Commons and in the country after the\r\nreassembling of Parliament, before the Government decide on entering\r\nupon the struggle which the carrying through of the measure might\r\nentail. It is quite impossible _now_ to conjecture with certainty what\r\nthat state of feeling and the general political circumstances at home\r\nand abroad may be at that time. Possibly the country may be more eager\r\n_then for_ the measure--or the War may _disincline_ it _altogether_\r\ntowards it.\r\n\r\nThe Queen seizes this opportunity of expressing her sense of the\r\n_imperative importance_ of the Cabinet being _united_ and of one mind\r\nat this moment, and not to let it _appear_ that there are differences\r\nof opinion within it. The knowledge that there are such is a cause of\r\nGREAT _anxiety_ to the Queen, at a time when she is to enter upon a\r\nEuropean War, of which nobody can confidently predict the extent.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: See the Queen's letter of the 4th of March,\r\n    _post_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _2nd February (?

Indeed, the Queen cannot\r\nconceive the possibility of their collision, as an exclusive regard\r\nfor the well-understood interests of the Country must always redound\r\nto the honour and reputation of a Statesman.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Lord John Russell had announced the decision of\r\n    the Government to postpone till the 27th of April the second\r\n    reading of the Reform Bill, and, in reply to some sarcastic\r\n    comments from Mr Disraeli, stated that he would be ashamed\r\n    of himself if he preferred anything connected with his own\r\n    personal reputation to the interest of the country. He added\r\n    that the security of the country depended upon its confidence\r\n    in the character of public men.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BALTIC FLEET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _14th March 1854._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Your kind letter of the 9th arrived here on Saturday\r\njust when we returned from a splendid and never-to-be-forgotten sight--\r\nthe sailing of our noble Fleet for the Baltic;[20] the Navy and Nation\r\nwere particularly pleased at _my leading them out_, as they call it,\r\nwhich in fact was the case, as, in our little _Fairy_ we went on and\r\nlay to, to see them all come out, which (the wind being fair) they did,\r\nwith sails set, each passing us close by, and giving us three hearty\r\ncheers, as I think none but British tars _can_ give. Gloriously they\r\nbore along, followed by the prayers and good wishes of all. You should\r\nread the account in yesterday's _Times_. Another sailing squadron goes\r\nto-morrow.

He\r\nwill be able to tell you, orally, what I can express only imperfectly\r\nin writing, how deep my pain is, after our going so far, faithfully,\r\nhand in hand, to see you, at this weighty moment, separating yourself\r\nfrom us. My pain is still further increased by the fact that I cannot\r\neven conceive the grounds which move your Majesty to take this step.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: The Prussian Court considered itself under no\r\n    obligation to engage in the impending struggle, till its own\r\n    interests became directly involved; it would not (said Baron\r\n    Manteuffel, President of the Ministry, on the 18th of March)\r\n    take part, for the protection of the integrity of the Ottoman\r\n    Empire, \"in a conflict, the full scope of which cannot yet be\r\n    apprehended, and the original subject matter of which does not\r\n    affect the interests of our fatherland.\"]\r\n\r\nThe most recent Russian proposals came as an answer to the _last_\r\nattempt for an understanding which the Powers believed could be\r\narrived at honourably, and they have been rejected by the Vienna\r\nConference, not because they were not in accordance with the literal\r\nwording of the programme, but because they were contrary to the\r\nintention of it. Your Majesty's Ambassador has taken part in this\r\nConference and its decision, and when your Majesty now says: \"The task\r\nof Diplomacy ceases at the exact point where that of the Sovereigns\r\nemphatically begins\"; I am unable to assent to such a definition. For\r\nwhat my Ambassador does, he does in my name, and I feel myself not\r\nonly bound in honour thereby, but also placed under an obligation\r\nto take upon myself the _consequences_ which the step which he is\r\ndirected to take may lead to.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful and incalculable consequences of a War weigh upon my\r\nheart not less than on your Majesty's. I also know that the Emperor of\r\nRussia does not wish for it. He, none the less, demands from the Porte\r\nthings which all the Powers of Europe--among them, yourself--have\r\nsolemnly declared to be incompatible with the independence of the\r\nPorte, and the European balance of power. In view of this declaration\r\nand of the presence of the Russian Army of invasion in the\r\nPrincipalities, the Powers could not but be ready to confirm their\r\nword by action. If \"the Turk\" now goes into the background, and if\r\nthe approaching War appears to you as a \"War of tendency\" this is\r\nthe case only because the very motives which may induce the Emperor to\r\ninsist on his demands--in defiance of the opposition of the whole of\r\nEurope, and with the danger of a War that may devastate the world, do\r\nbetray a _distinct tendency_, and because the grave consequences of\r\nthe War must appear much more momentous than the original ostensible\r\ncause of it, which at first appeared only as the request for a key to\r\nthe back door of a mosque.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty asks me \"to examine the question in a spirit of love for\r\npeace, and even now to build a bridge for the Imperial honour.\" Ah, my\r\ndear Sir and Brother, all the inventive gifts, all the architecture\r\nof diplomacy and of goodwill, have been uselessly wasted during these\r\nlast nine months in this bridge-building! The _Projets de Notes, de\r\nConventions, de Protocoles_, etc., etc., have proceeded, by the dozen,\r\nfrom the Chancelleries of the different Powers, and one might call\r\nthe ink wasted on them another Black Sea. But everything has been\r\nshipwrecked against the self-will of your honourable brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nIf now your Majesty informs me \"_that now you mean to persist in\r\ncomplete neutrality_,\" and if, on this occasion, you refer us to your\r\nNation, who are said to exclaim with sound common sense: \"Acts of\r\nviolence have been done by the Turks, the Turk has good friends\r\nin large numbers, and the Emperor has done us no harm\"--I do not\r\nunderstand you. Certainly I should understand this language if I\r\nheard it from the Kings of Hanover or of Saxony. But I have, hitherto,\r\nlooked upon Prussia as one of the Great Powers which, since the peace\r\nof 1815, have been guarantors of treaties, guardians of civilisation,\r\ndefenders of the right, the real arbiters of the Nations; and for\r\nmy part I have felt the divine responsibility of this sacred office,\r\nwithout undervaluing at the same time the heavy obligation, not\r\nunconnected with danger, which it imposes on me. If you, dear Sir\r\nand Brother, abdicate these obligations, you have also abdicated that\r\nposition for Prussia. And should such an example find imitators, then\r\nthe civilisation of Europe would be delivered up to the play of winds;\r\nright will then no longer find a champion, the oppressed will find no\r\nlonger an umpire.\r\n\r\nLet not your Majesty believe that what has been said in this letter\r\nis aimed at persuading you to change your resolves; it flows from the\r\naffectionate heart of a sister, who could not pardon herself, were she\r\nnot, at so weighty a moment, to let you see into her inmost soul. So\r\nlittle is it my intention to desire to win you over to our view, that\r\nnothing has grieved me more than the suspicion, expressed in your name\r\nby General von der Gröben, that England had desired to seduce you from\r\nyour purpose by opening a prospect of advantages to be gained. The\r\nbaselessness of such a supposition is evident from the Treaty itself\r\nwhich had been offered to you, and whose most important clause\r\nconsisted in the promise of the contracting parties, _not to desire in\r\nany case to derive from the War any advantage for themselves_.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty could not have given a more powerful proof of your\r\nunselfishness than by the very fact of attaching your signature to\r\nthis Treaty.\r\n\r\nTo come to a close. You suppose that War may already have been\r\ndeclared; you express, however, at the same time, the hope that it may\r\nnot already have actually broken out. I cannot unfortunately hold out\r\nany hope that the sentence will be followed by any stay of execution.\r\nShakespeare's words:\r\n\r\n                          \"Beware\r\n  Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,\r\n  Bear it that the opposer may beware of thee,\"\r\n\r\nare deeply engraved on the hearts of all Englishmen. Sad that they\r\nare to find an application at this crisis, in a nation with whom\r\npreviously nothing prevailed but friendship and affection! And how\r\nmuch more melancholy must be the present emotions of your Majesty's\r\nheart and mind to see such words applied to a beloved brother-in-law,\r\nwhom yet--however much you love him--your conscience cannot absolve\r\nfrom the crime of having brought upon the world wilfully and\r\nfrivolously such awful misery!\r\n\r\nMay the Almighty take you under His protection!\r\n\r\nWith Albert's most cordial compliments, and our united greetings\r\nto the dear Queen, I remain, my much honoured Sir and Brother, your\r\nMajesty's faithful Sister and Friend,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.[22]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: The King afterwards agreed to the proposed\r\n    protocol for the preservation of the integrity of Turkey,\r\n    which was signed at Vienna on the 7th of April.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\n_1st April 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen rejoices to see the Debate was favourable in the House of\r\nLords, and that it was concluded in the House of Commons.[23]\r\n\r\nShe is rather startled at seeing Lord Aberdeen's answer to Lord Roden\r\nupon the subject of a day of humiliation, as he has never mentioned\r\nthe subject to her, and it is one upon which she feels strongly.\r\nThe only thing the Queen ever heard about it was from the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, who suggested the _possibility_ of an _appropriate_ prayer\r\nbeing introduced into the Liturgy, in which the Queen quite agreed;\r\nbut he was strongly against a day of humiliation, in which the Queen\r\nalso entirely agreed, as she thinks we have recourse to them far too\r\noften, and they thereby lose their effect. The Queen therefore hopes\r\nthat this will be reconsidered carefully, and a _prayer_ substituted\r\nfor the _day of humiliation_. Were the services selected for these\r\ndays of a different kind to what they are--the Queen would feel\r\nless strongly about it; but they always select chapters from the Old\r\nTestament and Psalms which are so totally inapplicable that it does\r\naway with all the effect it ought to have. Moreover, really to say\r\n(as we probably should) that the _great sinfulness of the nation_ has\r\nbrought about this War, when it is the selfishness and ambition of\r\n_one_ man and his servants who have brought this about, while our\r\nconduct has been throughout actuated by unselfishness and honesty,\r\nwould be too manifestly repulsive to the feelings of every one, and\r\nwould be a mere act of hypocrisy. Let there be a prayer expressive of\r\nour great thankfulness for the benefits we have enjoyed, and for the\r\nimmense prosperity of this country, and entreating God's help and\r\nprotection in the coming struggle. In this the Queen would join heart\r\nand soul. If there is to be a day set apart, let it be for prayer in\r\nthis sense.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: On the 27th of March the Queen announced to\r\n    Parliament that the negotiations with the Czar had terminated,\r\n    and that she felt bound \"to afford active assistance to her\r\n    ally, the Sultan.\" Next day the Declaration of War was issued,\r\n    containing a narrative of the events which finally led to the\r\n    rupture. The debates on the Address in answer to the message\r\n    took place on the 31st of March, Mr Bright, in the Commons,\r\n    censuring the declaration, and being replied to by Lord\r\n    Palmerston. The addresses were presented to the Queen on the\r\n    3rd of April.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE REFORM QUESTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _9th April 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is anxious to express to Lord John Russell the extreme\r\nsatisfaction she experiences at the communication Lord Aberdeen\r\nyesterday evening made her of the settlement of the Reform Question,\r\nviz., of its postponement for the present Session, with the\r\nunderstanding that it is to be brought forward again whenever the\r\nstate of affairs will admit of its being fairly and calmly considered\r\nby Parliament.[24] The sacrifice of personal feeling which no doubt\r\nthis may cost Lord John will, she is certain, be amply compensated by\r\nthe conviction that he has done so for the interest and tranquillity\r\nof his Sovereign and Country, to whom a dissolution of the present\r\nGovernment would have been a source of immense danger and evil.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: From a memorandum, made by Prince Albert, of\r\n    interviews with Lord Aberdeen, it appears that before the\r\n    Cabinet of the 8th of April Lord Palmerston declared that\r\n    under neither present nor any future conditions could he vote\r\n    for the second reading of the Reform Bill. Lord John thereupon\r\n    tendered his resignation; this Lord Aberdeen asked him to\r\n    suspend until after the meeting of the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DISSENSION IN THE CABINET]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _9th April 1854._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he cannot\r\nthink it consistent with fairness to conceal from your Majesty the\r\ndeep feelings of mortification which affect him on reviewing the\r\nproceedings of the Cabinet yesterday.[25]\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen was the only person who behaved with due regard to the\r\nhonour of the Administration. The rest appeared ready to sacrifice\r\neverything in order to keep the Ministry together; and Lord John\r\nRussell feels bound to warn your Majesty that, although he was quite\r\nwilling to waive the consideration of the Reform Bill for the present\r\nSession, he is not ready to consent that it shall be entirely set\r\naside in order to keep together a Ministry whose continuance would\r\nbe dearly bought at the price of the welfare of the Country, and the\r\nconsistency of public men. Lord John Russell must reflect further on\r\nthis subject before he comes to a final determination.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: Lord John Russell's actions at this period\r\n    of his career seem often incomprehensible; but his private\r\n    domestic anxieties seem to have weighed him down. Having made\r\n    the great sacrifice, for an ex-Premier, of taking office under\r\n    an old opponent, he was now engaged in trying to regain the\r\n    first place for himself. Lord Aberdeen had always contemplated\r\n    retiring in his favour, but would not give up the Premiership\r\n    in the face of the dangers threatening the country. Moreover,\r\n    he had believed his continuance in office to be a guarantee\r\n    for peace. Lord John Russell, after accepting the Foreign\r\n    Office, had then insisted on being a Minister without office;\r\n    later still, by displacing Mr Strutt and transferring Lord\r\n    Granville to the Duchy, he himself became Lord President of\r\n    the Council, an office which no commoner had held since the\r\n    reign of Henry VIII. By such action, coupled with perpetual\r\n    threats of resignation, he marred his prospects of succeeding\r\n    Lord Aberdeen, and, as will be seen, failed in his attempt to\r\n    construct an Administration when the opportunity was offered\r\n    him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _10th April 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen received Lord John Russell's letter last night. She is much\r\ngrieved that he should be \"affected by deep feelings of mortification\r\non reviewing the proceedings of the Cabinet.\" From all the Queen\r\nhad heard of the views of the different members of the Cabinet, she\r\nbelieves them to have been fully convinced that the present moment\r\nwould be inopportune to press the Reform Bill, but _quite_ prepared\r\nto take it up again on the first fitting opportunity; she, of course,\r\ndoes _not_ speak of Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would, no more than Lord John, wish to see \"the Reform Bill\r\nset aside in order to keep together a Ministry,\" but does not consider\r\nthe decision of the Cabinet at all to imply this, whatever Lord\r\nPalmerston's personal wishes may be, and trusts that the Country will\r\nfully understand and appreciate the motives which have guided the\r\nGovernment. Lord Aberdeen and Lord John will always receive every\r\nsupport from the Queen when they shall think it right to propose the\r\nre-introduction of the measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _10th April 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen has just left the Queen, after an interview which he\r\nhad had with Sir James Graham and Lord John Russell at Lord John's\r\nrequest. He reported that at that interview Lord John renewed his\r\ncomplaint of the Cabinet, declared that he could not state to the\r\nHouse what was untrue, and must therefore resign. Lord Aberdeen called\r\nthis \"really too monstrous\" after the pledge given by the Sovereign,\r\nhimself as Prime Minister, and the whole Cabinet, with the exception\r\nof one man, and he would repeat his promise that whenever Lord John\r\nsaid, \"The Reform Bill is to come on,\" and Lord Palmerston opposed it,\r\nhe should go.\r\n\r\nLord John could not be appeased, but spoke with the greatest\r\nbitterness. He had written to Lord Palmerston in the same sense; and\r\nLord Palmerston's answer arrived during the interview. It was to the\r\neffect that if one of them was to resign, it was not Lord John, who\r\nagreed with the rest of the Cabinet upon the Bill, but himself,\r\nwho was the dissentient. Lord Aberdeen asked Lord John whether Lord\r\nPalmerston's resignation would satisfy him; to which he answered, he\r\nbelieved it would not mend matters. Lord Aberdeen's opinion, however,\r\nis that it is what Lord John, and still more what Lady John, wants.\r\nHe thinks the Country will never understand how the Government could\r\nbreak up, and that Lord John is cutting his own throat, and told him\r\nso. If Lord John went, he could not go on with Lord Palmerston as\r\nLeader of the House of Commons, which he called \"perfectly ludicrous.\"\r\nLord Palmerston would probably insist upon this, however; Lord\r\nPalmerston's retirement would be a great blow to the Government, as\r\nthe Country persisted in thinking him the only able War Minister, and\r\nwould cry out at \"the imbecile old Head of the Government having it\r\nnow all his own way.\" He thought, should he not be able to go on, new\r\ncombinations could be formed, perhaps under the Duke of Newcastle and\r\nMr Gladstone, as the Country liked younger men. Lord John must give\r\nhis answer in the House of Commons to-morrow at half-past four. Lord\r\nAberdeen would wish to see the Duke of Newcastle, Sir James Graham,\r\nand Mr Gladstone, as his more particular friends, this evening, to\r\ndiscuss the whole question with them, and would see Lord Palmerston\r\nand Lord John to-morrow, before he could make any report to the Queen.\r\n\r\nThis is all really very bad!\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _11th April 1854._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he has the\r\nhonour to acknowledge, with gratitude, your Majesty's communication\r\nof yesterday. Lord John Russell waited to see Lord Aberdeen before he\r\nanswered, and having now had a long conversation with him, Lord John\r\nRussell being assured of your Majesty's support, of Lord Aberdeen's\r\nconcurrence, and of the assent of the majority of his colleagues, is\r\nwilling to continue his humble services in the Cabinet, and in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell must ask your Majesty to excuse what may have seemed\r\nintemperate in his letter of Sunday last. He is still of opinion that\r\nwithout public confidence in his integrity and uprightness he can be\r\nof no use to your Majesty, or to the Country.\r\n\r\nAnd on that confidence must depend the continuance of his\r\nservices.[26]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: On the same day Lord John announced in the\r\n    Commons the withdrawal of the Reform Bill. He admitted that\r\n    this course would expose him to the taunts and sarcasms of his\r\n    opponents, and to the suspicions of his supporters. Here \"his\r\n    feelings overcame him, and, as he used the word 'suspicion'\r\n    in reference to his motive, his utterance was choked, and the\r\n    sentence he struggled to pronounce was evidently given through\r\n    tears.\" (_Ann. Reg._, 1854, p. 120.) Loud and sympathetic\r\n    cheers followed from all parts of the House.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _11th April 1854._\r\n\r\nWe saw Lord Aberdeen at three o'clock to-day, who reported to the\r\nQueen that the change of mind of Lord John had been the result of an\r\nhour and a half's discussion with him this morning. He must admit,\r\nhowever, that he found Lord John in a mood willing to let himself be\r\nconvinced. The Queen's letter might have contributed to this as well\r\nas the entreaties of the Duke of Bedford and Lord Lansdowne. Lord\r\nAberdeen could tell Lord John in truth that there was not a shadow of\r\ndifference of opinion amongst any of his friends, that he would lose\r\nhimself for ever, and meet with universal reprobation, if he persisted\r\nin resigning after every cause for it had been removed, and he\r\nhad agreed to the course Lord Palmerston had insisted upon. Lord\r\nPalmerston had written a very clever letter to Lord John, begging him\r\nnot to desert the Queen and the Country, which, if he read it to the\r\nHouse of Commons, would floor Lord John completely.\r\n\r\nWe asked what had been agreed upon at yesterday evening's meeting.\r\nLord Aberdeen told us the decision, under the impression that Lord\r\nJohn would resign, had been for Lord Aberdeen to call upon Lord\r\nPalmerston, and to explain to him that although he had acted cordially\r\nwith him as a Colleague in this Government, yet they had been\r\npolitical antagonists during their whole lives--the Government also\r\nwas still a Reform Government; from personal, therefore, as well as\r\npublic, reasons it was impossible that he should be entrusted with the\r\nlead of the House of Commons, being the only anti-Reformer. And it was\r\nhoped that he would have no difficulty in letting Mr Gladstone lead\r\nthe House, as Sir James Graham was the same age and political standing\r\nwith Lord Palmerston, but at once cheerfully contented to waive all\r\nhis claims in favour of Mr Gladstone.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Cambridge to Queen Victoria._[27]\r\n\r\nVIENNA, _28th April 1854._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUSIN,--Before leaving this place I think it right that I\r\nshould once more trouble you with a letter, to inform you that the\r\nmessenger has arrived who brought your autograph letter for the\r\nEmperor, which I presented to him to-day at an audience I had for this\r\npurpose.... I had a very long and most interesting conversation with\r\nthe Emperor, who opened frankly and fairly upon the great questions\r\nof the day. The impression he made upon me was an excellent one, his\r\nconfidence and frankness are complete, and I have the firm conviction\r\nthat he is a man of his word, and that he never would say a thing\r\nthat he did not in his heart mean. The result of what he said was\r\nthe following: that he naturally was most distressed at all that\r\nhad occurred; that he was placed by the Emperor of Russia in a most\r\ndifficult position; that he quite disapproved his acts; but that he\r\ncould not but have a great disinclination to break with a very old\r\nally; and that even still he hoped this painful step might be spared\r\nto him by the Emperor of Russia making some proposal so honourable to\r\nall parties, that it would not be rejected by the Western Powers,\r\nwho would naturally not be disinclined to a peace, honourable to\r\nthemselves and tranquillising for the future; that the basis of such\r\ntreaty would be the position of the Christian population of the\r\nEast; that this might be discussed in Conference, the Russians having\r\n_first_ evacuated the Principalities, upon which the Turks would\r\nhold the right bank of the Danube, our Fleets to await events in\r\nthe Bosphorus, and our armies at Constantinople, such position being\r\nhighly honourable and advantageous to us in the eyes of Europe, and\r\ncertainly not nearly so favourable to Russia; that he was certainly\r\nsensible that the English Government had not pressed him, feeling\r\nas they had done the extreme delicacy of his position, and the great\r\nextent of his frontier so easily attacked; that he did not wish to say\r\nnow, till the moment of decision came, thinking it more honourable\r\nand straightforward not to raise false expectations, but that his\r\ninterests being so completely with us, should the Emperor of Russia\r\ndo nothing in the honourable direction he hoped to see him adopt, he\r\nshould then consider himself called upon to express frankly to us what\r\nhe proposed to do, in order that our action might become united and\r\nof advantage to one another. He further thought that the treaty with\r\nPrussia would greatly facilitate all this, as Prussia had acceded to\r\nthe wishes of Austria in the event of certain eventualities, which,\r\nhowever, for the moment are not named, but which, as far as I\r\nunderstand, go to the length of leaving Austria unfettered to act as\r\nshe likes at the moment when she considers her so doing essential to\r\nher position as a young Empire. It is quite evident to me that this is\r\nthe general feeling here, amongst all those who have any weight in the\r\ncouncils of the Empire. These are _Austrian_ views, and I must say I\r\ncan understand them and appreciate them as such. I am confident, I am\r\ncertain, they are _honest_ on the part of the Emperor, and I doubt\r\nnot he will carry them through to the letter, for I am confident\r\nthe Emperor never would say what he did not mean. Rely upon it, this\r\nCountry will never go with Russia; she knows her interests too well\r\nfor that; she would like to avoid a War altogether if she could,\r\nand with that view she would be delighted to see some honourable and\r\nacceptable proposal made, but should this fail she will then take a\r\nvery decided line, and that line will be in accordance with Austrian\r\ninterests--which means with us. I find that most of the more prudent\r\npeople, and many of those in high office, are fully alive to the\r\nadvantages of the English alliance, and would wish to see this\r\nalliance confirmed _de novo_; and I think it would be very well for us\r\nto meet them half-way with this. But then it would be better to avoid\r\nall after-dinner speeches such as those at the Reform Club,[28] all\r\nPolish legions such as are talked of, and in short any of these little\r\nmatters, which are painfully felt here, and which always produce an\r\nuncomfortable and distrustful effect. The Emperor expressed himself in\r\nthe most grateful manner towards yourself, and I think is pleased at\r\nyour having permitted me to be present on this occasion.... Hoping\r\nthat you will approve of my humble endeavours here, and with sincere\r\nregards to Albert, I beg to remain, my dear Cousin, your most dutiful\r\nCousin,\r\n\r\nGEORGE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: The English forces destined for the East were\r\n    under the command of Lord Raglan (formerly Lord Fitzroy\r\n    Somerset).

I return you the Emperor's kind letter. Nothing could be more\r\nsatisfactory than the reception George met with by everybody at\r\nVienna--beginning with the Emperor. They showed him much confidence,\r\nand he obtained from them intelligence which I think no one else\r\nwould. The Fleets have done their duty admirably at Odessa;[29] the\r\ntown has not been touched, and all the fortifications and many ships\r\nhave been destroyed....\r\n\r\nWe had a concert last night, and I saw good Sir H. Seymour, who is\r\nfull of your kindness and goodness; and a most worthy, honourable and\r\ncourageous little man he is.[30] If the poor Emperor Nicholas had had\r\na few such--_nous ne serions pas où nous en sommes_. But unfortunately\r\nthe Emperor does _not like_ being _told_ what is unpleasant and\r\n_contrary_ to _his wishes_, and gets very violent when he hears the\r\n_real_ truth--which _consequently_ is not told him! There is the\r\nmisery of being violent and passionate; if Princes and still more\r\nKings and Emperors are so, _no_ one will _ever_ tell them the truth,\r\nand _how_ dreadful that is! I think one never can be too careful in\r\nbringing up Princes to inculcate the principle of _self-control_.\r\n\r\nWe have a good deal of rain and thunder since yesterday, which I hope\r\nwill revive poor parched Nature. I must now wish you good-bye, as\r\nI expect dear Victoire shortly. Nemours intends going to fetch the\r\nQueen. With Albert's love, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: In consequence of the Russians firing upon a\r\n    flag of truce, Odessa was bombarded on the 22nd of April, and\r\n    most of its batteries silenced or destroyed.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: The conversations of Sir Hamilton Seymour and\r\n    the Emperor Nicholas in the year 1853 had now been given\r\n    to the world.

On the 2nd of March 1854, an obviously\r\n    inspired article in the _Journal de St. Pétersbourg_ professed\r\n    to contradict the statements of Lord John Russell in the\r\n    House of Commons reflecting on the bad faith of the Russian\r\n    Government, and accordingly, in their own vindication, the\r\n    English Cabinet now published the conversations above referred\r\n    to.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE SULTAN]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BRITISH FORCES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Cambridge to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE, _13th May 1854._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUSIN,--I have not as yet announced to you my safe arrival\r\nhere, as I was anxious first to see the Sultan and the general state\r\nof things before giving you a report of what was really going on....\r\n\r\nI found a great proportion of the Infantry arrived, a portion of the\r\nArtillery, but as yet no Cavalry. Lord Raglan is well and in good\r\nspirits, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe ill in bed with a bad fit of the\r\ngout--most miserable to see in every respect. The Sultan[31] received\r\nme at once on the day of arrival, and made his return visit to\r\nme yesterday. I confess I was not much impressed with either his\r\nappearance or general ability. He is, to say the truth, a wretched\r\ncreature, prematurely aged, and having nothing whatever to say for\r\nhimself. A few commonplace civilities was all the conversation which\r\npassed between us. I said everything I could think of to make a\r\nconversation, among other things messages of civility from yourself;\r\nbut though he appeared pleased and expressed his satisfaction at our\r\nbeing here, I could not get him to enter into anything, and I was not\r\nsorry on both occasions when our interview was at an end. As to his\r\nMinisters, and in fact the whole population and country, with the\r\nexception of Redschid Pasha,[32] they are all a most wretched and\r\nmiserable set of people, and far, far worse than anything I could\r\npossibly have imagined or supposed. In fact, the \"sick man\" is\r\n_excessively sick indeed_, dying as fast as possible; and the sooner\r\ndiplomacy disposes of him the better, for no earthly power can save\r\nhim, that is very evident. This is the opinion of every person out\r\nhere of both armies, French and English, and you may rest assured it\r\nis the truth. The great thing is that we are here and no other Power\r\ncan now step in, but diplomacy must settle what is to happen, for as\r\nto the Turks remaining in Europe that is out of the question, and the\r\nvery fact of our being here now has given them their death-blow. I\r\nhope, my dear cousin, you will forgive me for being very candid on\r\nthis point, but I really do not think that anybody in England had any\r\nidea of the real state of affairs here. The sooner therefore that they\r\nare put in possession of the truth unvarnished the better. The great\r\nand imperative necessity is that the four Powers of Europe should\r\nstrike together, otherwise things will become much worse than they\r\nare even at present. Everybody is very civil and obliging to me, the\r\nSultan has put me into one of his best Palaces, very nicely fitted up,\r\nand is anxious to do everything I wish. I find it inconvenient, as the\r\ntroops are on the other side of the Bosphorus, and I therefore intend\r\ngoing over there to reside if possible. Marshal St Arnaud is here and\r\nPrince Napoleon, but no French troops. I have seen the latter once; he\r\nwas very civil indeed to me, but I do not think he has made at all a\r\ngood impression here, his manner being offensive and harsh. I do not\r\nthink the Army like him at all. I am afraid the French Ambassador is\r\ngiving much trouble. Neither St Arnaud nor the Prince like him at all,\r\nand I believe they have written to demand his recall, which would be\r\na very good thing, as he cannot hit it off with anybody. As to our\r\nmovements, I know nothing of them as yet, nor do I think that much has\r\nas yet been settled, but I fear we shall not be fit to move for some\r\ntime; the difficulty of transport is very great, our Artillery\r\nonly partly arrived, and no Cavalry. We require more troops, more\r\nparticularly of the latter arm, in which the Russians are very strong.\r\nWe ought to have at least 10,000 men more, and the sooner they are\r\nsent out the better. Even that number is not enough, for the French\r\ntalk of 100,000 men, and we should be in a most dreadful minority\r\nunless we had 40,000 to 50,000. I am afraid all this will alarm people\r\nin England, but it is the truth.... I remain, my dear Cousin, your\r\nmost dutiful Cousin,\r\n\r\nGEORGE.\r\n\r\nWe never hear any news here. All that does come to us generally comes\r\nby way of Europe; another proof of what a miserable country this is.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Abdul Medjid, born 1823, who had succeeded to\r\n    the throne at the time of the Syrian War; see _ante_, vol. i.,\r\n    19th August, 1839, note 54.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: Minister of Foreign Affairs, born 1802, died\r\n    1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING OF PRUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of Prussia to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n[_Translation._]\r\n\r\nSANS SOUCI, _24th May 1854._\r\n\r\nMOST GRACIOUS QUEEN,--... My policy,[33] which has been so terribly\r\ncriticised and derided as \"vacillating,\" has been, since the beginning\r\nof this most inauspicious conflict, one and the same, and _without a\r\nhairsbreadth of deviation_ either to the right or to the left. As it\r\nrests on the unshakable foundation which my conscience as a King and\r\na Christian has laid down, and which does not admit _que je fasse la\r\nbesogne ni de l'un ni de l'autre parti_, I am abused and insulted\r\nat the Winter Palace, and regarded, by way of contrast in London and\r\nParis, as a kind of simpleton--neither of which is pleasant.\r\n\r\nMay your Majesty believe my Royal Word: I was, I am, I remain the\r\ntruest and most faithful friend of Great Britain, as well in principle\r\nas from religious feeling and from true affection. I desire and\r\npractise a good and honest understanding with France; but when it\r\ncomes to helping the French--to whom Prussia's geographical position\r\nbetween Paris and Warsaw is very inconvenient--to pull the _chestnuts\r\nfrom the fire_ for them, for such a task I am frankly too good. If the\r\nEmperor wishes to force me to assist--as evidently he is inclined to\r\ndo--it will end by becoming too difficult for him. He ought to thank\r\nGod that my view of Russian policy and my fidelity to your Majesty\r\nhave prevented me from making him begin this _Turkish_ War on the\r\n_other side of his own frontier_. The great advantage of this result\r\nis totally forgotten in France, and, unfortunately, in England too.\r\nThose who every day fill the papers of home and foreign countries with\r\naccounts of my vacillations, nay, who represent me as leaping from my\r\nown horse on to a Russian one, are inventing lies, in a great measure,\r\ndeliberately. I tell your Majesty, on my honour and conscience, that\r\nmy policy is to-day _the same_ as it was nine months ago. I have\r\nrecognised it as my duty before God to preserve, for my people and my\r\nprovinces, peace, _because I recognise Peace as a blessing and War\r\nas a curse_. I cannot and will not side with Russia, because Russia's\r\narrogance and wickedness have caused this _horrible_ trouble, and\r\nbecause duty and conscience and tradition forbid me to draw the sword\r\nagainst Old England. In the same degree duty and conscience forbid\r\nme to make unprovoked war against Russia, because Russia, so far,\r\nhas done me no harm. So I thought, so I willed when I thought myself\r\nisolated. How then could I now suddenly abandon a steady policy,\r\npreserved in the face of many dangers, and incline to Russia at the\r\nmoment when I have concluded with Austria an Alliance defensive and\r\noffensive, in which (if God grant His blessing) the whole of Germany\r\nwill join in a few days, thus welding, for the entire duration of the\r\nWar, the whole of Central Europe into a Unity, comprising 72,000,000\r\npeople, and easily able to put 1,000,000 men into the field? And\r\nyet, most gracious Queen, I do not take up a defiant position on the\r\nstrength of this enormous power, but I trust in the Lord's help and\r\nmy own sacred Right; I also believe, honestly and firmly, that the\r\ncharacter of a so-called Great Power must justify itself, _not by\r\nswimming with the current_, but _by standing firm like a rock in the\r\nsea_.\r\n\r\nI close this letter which, in consequence of various interruptions,\r\nis almost a week old, on the 24th of May. This is your birthday, ever\r\ndearest, most gracious Queen. On this day I lay at your Majesty's feet\r\nthe expression of my wishes for every blessing. May God grant your\r\nMajesty a joyful day, and a richly blessed year of rule. May He\r\nstrengthen, preserve, and invigorate your precious health, and may He\r\ngive you, within the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year\r\nof your life which begins to-day, _that_ one day of overabundant\r\nblessing, of unspeakable joy, for which I long, for which I pray to\r\nGod--_that blissful day on which you can utter the word_ PEACE.\r\n\r\nNow I beg your Majesty from the bottom of my heart not to be angry\r\nwith me for my unconscionably long letter, nor to worry yourself\r\nabout sending an answer, but, on the other hand, graciously to keep\r\nit secret, communicating it only to the dear Prince. It is a matter\r\nof course that the facts which it contains, and the resulting\r\nexplanations, which may be of importance for your Majesty's\r\nGovernment, must, from their nature, no longer be kept secret, so\r\nsoon as you think it right to announce them. I embrace the dear Prince\r\ntenderly, and commend myself to the grace, goodwill, and friendship\r\nof my august Royal Sister, I being your Majesty's most faithfully\r\ndevoted, most attached Servant and Good Brother,\r\n\r\nFREDERIC WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: In the previous portion of this long letter,\r\n    here omitted, the King gives a detailed account of his\r\n    position and policy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MARSHAL ST ARNAUD]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Duke of Newcastle._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _29th May 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen acknowledges the receipt of the Duke of Newcastle's letter,\r\nwhich she received quite early this morning.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge's letter does _not_ give a flourishing account\r\nof the state of Turkey. What alarms the Queen most is the news given\r\nby the Duke of Newcastle of the pretensions of Marshal St Arnaud.[34]\r\nShe does not quite understand whether he has received the supreme\r\ncommand over the Turkish Army, but at any rate if the Porte should\r\nbe willing to allow its Army to be placed under Foreign Command, a\r\nportion of it ought to be claimed by us for Lord Raglan, which, joined\r\nto his English forces, would produce an Army capable of taking the\r\nfield independently.\r\n\r\nThe Queen trusts that the Government will take this into serious\r\nconsideration, and, if they should concur in this view, that no time\r\nwill be lost.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: The Duke had written to say that a demand had\r\n    been made by Marshal St Arnaud upon the Porte that Omar Pasha\r\n    should be superseded, and the Turkish Army placed under his\r\n    (St Arnaud's) orders; also that Marshal St Arnaud was desirous\r\n    of assuming the supreme command of the allied forces.

Sympathy with his fate is general here. I entirely recognise in\r\nyour letter the expression of your friendship, which is so dear to me,\r\nand which does not admit any sort of misunderstanding to exist between\r\nus, without my endeavouring at once to clear it up and remove it.\r\nHow could I meet your friendship otherwise than by equally absolute\r\nfrankness, allowing you to look into my inmost heart! Though you have\r\nshown me a proof of your gracious confidence in giving me, down to the\r\nsmallest detail, an account of your personal and business relations\r\nwith your servants, I still believe that I have no right to formulate\r\nany judgment. Only one thing my heart bids me to express, viz., that\r\nthe men with whom you have broken were faithful, veracious servants,\r\nwarmly devoted to you, and that just by the freedom and independence\r\nof spirit, with which they have expressed their opinions to your\r\nMajesty, _they have given an indisputable proof_ of having had\r\nin view, not their own personal advantage and the favour of their\r\nSovereign, but his true interests and welfare alone; and if just such\r\nmen as these--among them even your loving brother, a thoroughly noble\r\nand chivalrous Prince, standing next to the throne--find themselves\r\nforced, in a grave crisis, to turn away from you, this is a _momentous\r\nsign_, which might well give cause to your Majesty to take counsel\r\nwith yourself, and to examine with anxious care, whether perhaps the\r\nhidden cause of past and future evils may not lie in your Majesty's\r\nown views?[36] You complain, most honoured Sire and Brother, that\r\nyour policy is blamed as _vacillating_, and that your own person is\r\ninsulted at home and abroad (a thing which has often filled me with\r\n_deep grief and indignation_), and you asseverate that your policy\r\nrests upon a firm basis, which the conscience of \"a King and a\r\nChristian has laid down for it.\" But should it be possible to discover\r\nin your Majesty's fundamental views something self-contradictory,\r\nthen necessarily, the more consistently and conscientiously these\r\nfundamental views are revealed in their consequences, the more\r\ncontradictory must your actions appear to those who are not intimately\r\naware of your intentions, and cannot but force upon the world the\r\nimpression that your views themselves were wavering.\r\n\r\nYou will not take it amiss in a true friend and sister, if she\r\nendeavours to place before you her impressions on this matter, as\r\nfrankly as they appear to her.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty has acknowledged in the face of the world that Russia\r\nhas addressed to the Porte demands which she had no right to make. You\r\nhave further acknowledged that the forcible taking possession of two\r\nTurkish provinces with the intention of enforcing the demand was a\r\npolitical wrong. You have, together with Austria, France, and England,\r\nseveral times declared in Protocols the preservation of the integrity\r\nof the Turkish empire to be a European interest. Notwithstanding all\r\nthis, Russia continues to occupy the Danube principalities, penetrates\r\nfurther into Turkey, and, by forcing on a sanguinary and exhausting\r\nwar, leads the unhappy and _suffering_ empire on to the brink of the\r\ngrave. What should Europe then do under these circumstances?\r\n\r\nIt could not possibly be the intention of the Powers to declare the\r\npreservation and integrity of the Porte to be a matter of European\r\nconcern, solely in order to allow that empire to be destroyed before\r\ntheir very eyes! As to Prussia, I can conceive a line of policy, not\r\nthat indeed which I should think in harmony with the generosity and\r\nchivalry of your rule, but still one possible in itself, by which\r\nshe would say to herself: \"The preservation of this integrity I have\r\nindeed declared to be a matter of European concern, but I wish to\r\nleave England and France to defend that policy with their wealth and\r\nblood, and reserve to myself only a _moral_ co-operation.\" But what am\r\nI to think if, after England and France with courageous readiness have\r\ntaken upon themselves alone this immense responsibility, sacrifice,\r\nand danger, your Majesty is now mainly considering the erection of\r\na barrier of 72,000,000 of men between them and that Power, against\r\nwhose encroachment the European interest is to be defended? What am I\r\nto say to the threat uttered against the _West_ as well as against\r\nthe _East?_ and to your even asking from the West gratitude for \"the\r\nenormous advantage\" that you do not, into the bargain, yourself join\r\nin attacking it!! For your Majesty says expressly in your letter:\r\n\"The Emperor ought to thank God that my view of Russian policy, my\r\n_fidelity_ to your Majesty, have prevented me from making him begin\r\nthe Turkish war on the other side of his own frontier. The enormous\r\nadvantage of this abstention is totally forgotten in France, and,\r\nunfortunately, in England too!\"\r\n\r\nDearest Sir and Brother, this language shows a contradiction in\r\nyour own mind, which fills me with the greatest anxiety for possible\r\nconsequences, an anxiety not diminished by your kindly adding: \"Duty,\r\nConscience, and Tradition forbid you to draw the sword against Old\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nI shall gladly with you bless the day on which the word of Peace can\r\nbe uttered. Your Majesty can, by vigorous co-operation, help to usher\r\nin that day, just as you might have--in my conviction--contributed, by\r\nvigorous co-operation to prevent the War altogether.\r\n\r\nWhatever these troublous times may bring us, I harbour the firm\r\nconfidence that the warmth of our friendly relations cannot be\r\ntroubled by anything, and rejoice in the circumstance that the\r\npersonal relations of the two Sovereigns are, in this matter, so\r\nentirely in harmony with the interests of the two nations.\r\n\r\nAlbert sends you his homage, and I remain, with most cordial\r\nremembrance to the dear Queen, and with thanks for the kind wishes\r\nexpressed by both of you, ever your Majesty's faithful Sister and\r\nFriend,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: The influence of Russia over the King had been\r\n    proved by the recall of Baron Bunsen, and the dismissal of\r\n    all those Ministers who had opposed the policy of the Czar in\r\n    Turkey.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: The Prince of Prussia had shown his\r\n    dissatisfaction with the King's policy by quitting Berlin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE WAR OFFICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Minute of Interview by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _8th June 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen had an Audience to-day before the Council, and\r\nrepresented that what was intended was merely a division of the office\r\nof Secretary of State, and not the creation of any new power, and must\r\nbe considered rather as a means of avoiding further changes.[37] Lord\r\nGrey, in hearing of this intention, called it in a letter \"the worst\r\narrangement of all,\" as unfavourable to his further views; the Duke\r\nof Newcastle would fill the office, and would have to prepare the\r\nchanges, inherent in the arrangement, and was determined not to break\r\ndown the present arrangements; Lord John Russell was agreed herewith,\r\nand Sir George Grey would take office knowing this to be Lord\r\nAberdeen's firm decision. But there was in fact no choice. Mr Rich\r\nwould this afternoon bring forward a Motion in the House of Commons\r\nfor the consolidation of all military offices under one Department and\r\na Civil Head, and Lord John Russell, to whom Lord Aberdeen had said\r\nthat the Queen still hesitated about admitting the separation of the\r\nduties of Secretary of State, declared to him angrily, if that was\r\nso, he would go down to the House and vote for Mr Rich's Motion!! The\r\nMotion would be carried without fail in the House.\r\n\r\nSo this important measure had been carried by storm (as the Queen\r\ncould only give way under these circumstances), and carried without a\r\ndefinite plan, leaving everything to the future!!\r\n\r\nLord John is to be Lord President, and he insisted upon Sir George\r\nGrey taking the Colonies. Lord Aberdeen fears much dissatisfaction\r\nfrom Lord Canning, Mr Cardwell, and Mr Peel, and just dissatisfaction;\r\nthe Cabinet are very angry at the whole proceeding. Lord Granville\r\nbehaved exceedingly well, putting himself and his office entirely at\r\nLord Aberdeen's disposal.[38]\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that in the House expressions will be dropped in favour\r\nof Lord Palmerston's taking the conduct of the War in his hands. The\r\nDuke of Newcastle, whom we saw, also states the extreme difficulty of\r\n_defining_ the duties of the Secretary of State, but promises to do\r\nso, as far as possible, for the Queen's convenience.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: Lord John Russell had some time before proposed\r\n    the separation of the War and Colonial Departments, with a\r\n    view of filling the Colonial Office himself, \"which, in every\r\n    point of view.\" wrote Lord Aberdeen to the Queen, \"would have\r\n    been a most satisfactory arrangement.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Lord Fitzmaurice, in his _Life of Lord\r\n    Granville_, points out that Mr Strutt was really the person\r\n    who had a right to complain.

The\r\nqualities in Lord Aberdeen's character which the Queen values most\r\nhighly, his candour and his courage in expressing opinions even\r\nif opposed to general feelings of the moment, are in this instance\r\ndangerous to him, and the Queen hopes that in the vindication of his\r\nown conduct to-day, which ought to be triumphant, as it wants in fact\r\n_no_ vindication, he will not undertake the ungrateful and injurious\r\ntask of vindicating the Emperor of Russia from any of the exaggerated\r\ncharges brought against him and his policy at a time when there is\r\nenough in it to make us fight with all might against it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: The speech of Lord Aberdeen, to which the Queen\r\n    here refers, had created a very unsatisfactory impression. On\r\n    the 19th of June the venerable Lord Lyndhurst had denounced\r\n    the aggressive policy and the perfidy of Russia; in the debate\r\n    which followed, Lord Aberdeen spoke coldly, in a strain of\r\n    semi-apology for Russia, and with an unlucky reference to the\r\n    Treaty of Adrianople. Popular feeling against Russia being\r\n    then at a white heat, the speech was considered indicative of\r\n    apathy on behalf of the Government in the prosecution of the\r\n    war. Accordingly, by moving on a later day for a copy of his\r\n    own despatch of 1829, relative to the Treaty, the\r\n    Premier obtained an opportunity of dispelling some of the\r\n    apprehensions which his speech had excited.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE RUSSIAN LOAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _27th June 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen observes in Lord Cowley's letter a suggestion of M.

She thinks this of\r\nthe highest importance as _cutting_ the _sinews_ of war of the enemy.\r\nThe Queen does not know whether we have by law the power to forbid the\r\nquotation of this stock in our market, but a short Act of Parliament\r\nmight be obtained for the purpose.

The Cabinet\r\nassembled yesterday evening at Lord John Russell's, at Richmond, and\r\ncontinued to a very late hour.[41]\r\n\r\nA Draft of Instructions to Lord Raglan had been prepared by the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, in which the necessity of a prompt attack upon\r\nSebastopol and the Russian Fleet was strongly urged. The amount of\r\nforce now assembled at Varna, and in the neighbourhood, appeared to be\r\namply sufficient to justify such an enterprise, with the assistance\r\nof the English and French Fleets. But although the expedition to the\r\nCrimea was pressed very warmly, and recommended to be undertaken with\r\nthe least possible delay, the final decision was left to the judgment\r\nand discretion of Lord Raglan and Marshal St Arnaud, after they should\r\nhave communicated with Omar Pasha.\r\n\r\nIt was also decided to send the reserve force, now in England, of\r\n5,000 men, to join Lord Raglan without delay. This will exhaust the\r\nwhole disposable force of the country at this time, and renders it\r\nimpossible to supply British troops for any undertaking in the Baltic.\r\nA communication was therefore made yesterday to the French Government\r\nto know whether they would be disposed to send 6,000 French troops, to\r\nbe conveyed in English transports, to the Baltic, in order to join in\r\nan attack upon the Aland Islands,[42] which appeared to be attended\r\nwith no great difficulty; although any attempt upon Helsingfors, or\r\nCronstadt, was pronounced by Sir Charles Napier to be hopeless.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: The war now entered upon a new phase. Though the\r\n    land forces of the Allies had hitherto not come into\r\n    conflict with the enemy, the Turks under Omar Pasha had been\r\n    unexpectedly successful in their resistance to the Russians,\r\n    whom a little later they decisively defeated at Giurgevo.\r\n    Silistria had been determinedly besieged by the Russians,\r\n    and its fall was daily expected. Yet, under the leadership of\r\n    three young Englishmen, Captain Butler and Lieutenants Nasmyth\r\n    and Ballard, the Russians were beaten off and the siege\r\n    raised. The schemes of the Czar against Turkey in Europe had\r\n    miscarried.\r\n\r\n    Mr Kinglake describes, in an interesting passage, the growth\r\n    in the public mind of a determination that the Crimea should\r\n    be invaded, and Sebastopol destroyed. The Emperor Napoleon\r\n    had suggested the plan at an earlier stage, and the _Times_\r\n    newspaper fanned popular enthusiasm in favour of it. The\r\n    improved outlook in the East warranted the attempt being made,\r\n    but the plan was not regarded with unqualified approval by the\r\n    commanders of the allied forces in the East. In the speech,\r\n    already referred to, of Lord Lyndhurst, the project had been\r\n    urged upon the Government, and Lord Raglan considered that the\r\n    despatch now sanctioned by the Cabinet, which is printed in\r\n    the _Invasion of the Crimea_, left him no discretion in the\r\n    matter.\r\n\r\n    The scheme had previously been considered in all its\r\n    aspects by the Cabinet, and Mr Kinglake gives an exaggerated\r\n    importance to the fact that some of the members of the Cabinet\r\n    gave way to sleep while the long draft of instructions was\r\n    being read to them at the after-dinner Council at Pembroke\r\n    Lodge.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: Bomarsund, a fortress on one of these islands,\r\n    was taken by Sir Charles Napier, aided by a French contingent\r\n    under General Baraguay d'Hilliers, on the 16th of August;\r\n    but the high expectations raised as to the success of the\r\n    operations in the Baltic were not realised.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _30th June 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

If\r\nleft, it might weaken the authority of future instructions emanating\r\nfrom the Secretary of State alone; moreover, he acts constitutionally\r\nunder the authority of the Queen, on his own responsibility and not\r\nthat of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _17th July 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord Aberdeen's letter, and has fully\r\nconsidered the contents of it. She has finally decided to make no\r\nchange in her intended departure, from a conviction that her doing so\r\nmight shake confidence in the result of this night's Debate. Should\r\nanything serious occur, she would be ready to return to-morrow or at\r\nany time that her presence in town was considered of importance to the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _19th July 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of yesterday, and\r\nwas very glad to hear that both the meeting and the Debate went off so\r\nwell. The party which supports the Government is certainly \"a strange\r\nbasis for a Government to rest upon,\" but such as it is we must\r\nmake the best of it, and nothing will contribute more to keeping\r\nit together than to give it the impression that the Government is\r\nthoroughly united.[44]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: During a desultory discussion on the 13th of\r\n    July, Mr Disraeli had assailed the Government and its chief in\r\n    the Commons, to such purpose that Lord John Russell, stung\r\n    by his sarcasms, and mortified by his own failure, asked Lord\r\n    Aberdeen to relieve him of the Leadership of the House. The\r\n    Queen, to whom he had also written, entreated Lord John not to\r\n    let his opponent see that his object in making his attack had\r\n    been successful. A meeting of the Ministerialists was held\r\n    on the 17th at the Foreign Office, at which one hundred and\r\n    eighty members of the House of Commons were present, and some\r\n    diversity of opinion was expressed; the result of the meeting\r\n    was that the Government was more satisfactorily supported.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDIAN AFFAIRS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Marquis of Dalhousie._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _26th July 1854._\r\n\r\nIt is a very long time since the Queen has had the pleasure of hearing\r\nfrom Lord Dalhousie, but she supposes that (fortunately) there is very\r\nlittle to say, everything being so quiet and prosperous. The Queen\r\nhighly appreciates and values Lord Dalhousie's kind offer to remain\r\nin India while there is any prospect of difficulty being caused by\r\nthe present War, which will be a source of great satisfaction and\r\ntranquillity to her, as she feels that her Indian Dominions cannot be\r\nin safer hands.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes to tell Lord Dalhousie how much interested and\r\npleased we have been in making the acquaintance of the young Maharajah\r\nDhuleep Singh.[45] It is not without mixed feelings of pain and\r\nsympathy that the Queen sees this young Prince, once destined to so\r\nhigh and powerful a position, and now reduced to so dependent a one\r\nby her arms; his youth, amiable character, and striking good looks,\r\nas well as his being a Christian, the first of his high rank who has\r\nembraced our faith, must incline every one favourably towards him, and\r\nit will be a pleasure to us to do all we can to be of use to him, and\r\nto befriend and protect him.\r\n\r\nIt also interested us to see poor old Prince Gholam Mohammed, the last\r\nson of the once so dreaded Tippoo Sahib.\r\n\r\nWe both hope that Lord Dalhousie's health is good, and the Prince\r\nsends him his kind remembrance.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: This young Prince was born in 1838, and was a\r\n    younger son of Runjeet Singh, Chief of the Sikhs, who, after a\r\n    loyal alliance with England for thirty years, died in 1839.\r\n    In 1843 Dhuleep Singh was raised to the throne, which had been\r\n    occupied successively by Runjeet's elder sons. After the Sikh\r\n    war in 1845, the British Government gave to the boy-king the\r\n    support of a British force. In 1849, after the destruction of\r\n    the Sikh army at Gujerat, and the annexation of the Punjab,\r\n    a pension was bestowed on the young Maharajah on condition\r\n    of his remaining loyal to the British Government. He became a\r\n    Christian and was at this time on a visit to England.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MILITARY APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Hardinge._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _6th August 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Hardinge's letter of the 4th.[46] She\r\nwould for the future wish all papers for signature to be accompanied\r\nby a descriptive list showing at a glance the purport of the\r\ndocuments, as is done with papers from other Government offices.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has looked over the lists of Major-Generals made by the last\r\nbrevet which Lord Hardinge submitted, and must confess that it does\r\nnot afford a great choice; yet, leaving out the cavalry officers and\r\nthose disqualified by age or infirmities, there remain some few whom\r\nshe has marked with an \"X,\" for whose exclusion no adequate reason\r\nis apparent. An exclusion of officers who have served in the Guards,\r\n_merely on that account_, the Queen would not wish to see adopted as\r\na principle, and the selection of Colonels of the Line (because there\r\nare no Generals fit), in preference to Generals of the Guards who are\r\nperfectly so, will amount to this. General Eden,[47] moreover, has\r\nbeen in command of a Regiment of the Line, and General Knollys[48] has\r\nnot been promoted from the Guards, and, in accepting the Governorship\r\nof Guernsey, specially begged that this might not exclude him from\r\nactive service--a circumstance which he mentioned to the Prince at the\r\ntime. Both these have the reputation of very good officers.\r\n\r\nThe Queen does not wish anything to be arranged prospectively now, but\r\nwould recommend the subject to Lord Hardinge's future consideration.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: In reply to a letter from the Queen, stating\r\n    that she had inadvertently signed certain papers in the\r\n    ordinary course. Her attention had not been drawn to their\r\n    important features.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: Lieut.-General John Eden, C.B., nephew of the\r\n    first Lord Auckland.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: Sir William Knollys, K.C.B., 1797-1883, became\r\n    in 1855 the organiser of the newly formed Camp at Aldershot.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SPECIAL PRAYERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _21st August 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen must repeat what she has frequently done, that she strongly\r\nobjects to these _special_ prayers which _are_, in fact, _not_ a sign\r\nof gratitude or confidence in the Almighty--for if this is the\r\ncourse to be pursued, we _ought_ to have one for every _illness_, and\r\ncertainly in '37 the influenza was notoriously more _fatal_ than the\r\ncholera had ever been, and _yet no one_ would have thought of having\r\na prayer against _that_. Our Liturgy _has_ provided for these\r\ncalamities, and we may have frequent returns of the cholera--and yet\r\nit would be difficult to _define_ the _number_ of deaths which are\r\nto _make_ \"a form of prayer\" _necessary_. The Queen would, therefore,\r\nstrongly recommend the usual prayer being used, and no other, as is\r\nthe case for the prayer in time of War. What is the use of the prayers\r\nin the Liturgy, which were no doubt composed when we were subject\r\nto other equally fatal diseases, if a new one is always to be framed\r\nspecially for the cholera?\r\n\r\nThe Queen would wish Lord Aberdeen to give this as her decided opinion\r\nto the Archbishop, at all events, for the present. Last year the\r\ncholera quite decimated Newcastle, and was bad in many other places,\r\nbut there was _no special_ prayer, and _now_ the illness is in\r\n_London_ but _not_ in any other place, a prayer is proposed by the\r\nArchbishop. The Queen cannot see the difference between the one and\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CIVIL LIST PENSIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _1st September 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, with his humble duty, begs to lay before your Majesty\r\nthe pensions proposed to be granted on the Civil List at this time.\r\nThe only case requiring any special remark is that of the children\r\nof Lord Nelson's adopted daughter. There seems little doubt that the\r\nperson referred to was really Lord Nelson's daughter, according to\r\nevidence recently produced, and was recommended by him to the care of\r\nthe country, just before the battle of Trafalgar.[49]\r\n\r\nA numerous party in the House of Commons wished that your Majesty's\r\nGovernment should propose a special vote for this person and her\r\nfamily; but the Cabinet thought that it would give rise to much\r\nscandal and disagreeable debate, and finally recommended Lord Aberdeen\r\nto place the three daughters on the Pension List. The circumstances of\r\nthe case are, no doubt, very peculiar; and although Lord Aberdeen does\r\nnot feel perfectly satisfied with the course pursued, he thinks it\r\nvery desirable to avoid the sort of Parliamentary debates to which the\r\ndiscussion of such a subject would necessarily give rise.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: Horatia, daughter of Nelson and Lady Hamilton,\r\n    was born on the 29th of January 1801, and married in 1822 the\r\n    Rev.

Il peut\r\nêtre convaincu d'emporter avec lui mes sentiments de haute estime et\r\nd'amitié.

It was reasonably\r\n    conjectured at the time that one of the chief purposes of\r\n    the invitation was by personal intercourse to overcome the\r\n    prejudice which the Emperor believed prevailed against him.\r\n    The visit lasted from the 4th till the 8th of September, and\r\n    the Prince's impressions were recorded in a memorandum, \"the\r\n    value of which,\" writes Sir Theodore Martin, by way of preface\r\n    to his publication of it, \"cannot be overstated; nor is it\r\n    less valuable for the light which it throws upon the Prince's\r\n    character, by the remarkable contrasts between himself and the\r\n    Emperor of the French, which were elicited in the unreserved\r\n    discussions which each seems equally to have courted.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRINCE ALBERT AND THE EMPEROR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _22nd September 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty....\r\n\r\nCount Walewski told Lord Clarendon to-day that the Emperor had spoken\r\nwith enthusiasm of the Prince, saying that in all his experience\r\nhe had never met with a person possessing such various and profound\r\nknowledge, or who communicated it with the same frankness. His Majesty\r\nadded that he had never learned so much in a short time, and was\r\ngrateful. He began his conversation with reproaching Count Walewski\r\nfor not having written to him much oftener respecting the Prince, and\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the opinions of His Royal Highness upon all\r\nimportant subjects.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the invitation, the Emperor's account of it to\r\nCount Walewski was that he had apologised to the Prince for the bad\r\nreception he had given His Royal Highness, and expressed a hope that\r\nhe might have an opportunity of _doing better_ at Paris, if your\r\nMajesty and the Prince would honour him with a visit; and that His\r\nRoyal Highness had then said, \"the Queen hopes to see your Majesty at\r\nWindsor, and will be happy to make acquaintance with the Empress.\"\r\nThe Emperor, however, had only taken this as a courteous return to his\r\ninvitation, and not as intended for a positive invitation.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon told Count Walewski that he believed the matter had\r\npassed inversely, and that the Prince had first communicated your\r\nMajesty's message.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, Count Walewski said the Emperor will be delighted\r\nto avail himself of the Queen's gracious kindness; nothing will give\r\nhim so much pleasure....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR'S VISIT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _24th September 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the two letters from Lord Cowley. She is very sorry\r\nto see doubts arise as to the correctness of the intelligence about\r\nthe safe debarkation of our whole expeditionary force in the Crimea,\r\nbut still clings to the hope of its being true.\r\n\r\nCount Walewski's account of the Emperor's version of his conversation\r\nwith the Prince explains what the Prince suspected at one time\r\nhimself, that the Emperor had not understood the Prince's remark\r\nas conveying a _direct_ invitation, but merely as a general term of\r\ncivility. What the Prince intended to convey was something between the\r\ntwo, making it clear that he would be well received, and leaving it\r\nentirely open to him to come or not according to his own political\r\nviews and circumstances. This appeared to the Prince the most polite\r\nand delicate, preventing all appearance as if a counter-visit for his\r\nown at Boulogne was expected. Lest the Emperor should not have rightly\r\nunderstood the Prince, he repeated the wish to see the Emperor in\r\nEngland, and the hope of the Queen to make the Empress's acquaintance\r\nalso, _more directly_ to Marshal Vaillant, who gave the same answer as\r\nthe Emperor had done--he hoped we should come to Paris in return.\r\n\r\nMatters stand as well as possible with regard to the visit; in the\r\nQueen's opinion, the Emperor can come if he likes, and if prevented,\r\nis bound to nothing. Should he ask when his visit would be most\r\nagreeable to the Queen, the middle of November would be the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _30th September 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the enclosed letters. The French show their usual\r\nvivacity in pressing so hard for decision upon what is to be done\r\nwith Sebastopol when taken.[51] Surely we ought to have taken it first\r\nbefore we can dispose of it, and everything as to the decision about\r\nit must depend upon the state in which we receive it, and the opinion\r\nof the Military and Naval Commanders after they find themselves in\r\npossession of it. The Queen hopes, therefore, that Lord Clarendon will\r\nsucceed in restraining French impatience as he has often done before.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: Lord Clarendon had given the Queen the two\r\n    reasons for which the French were pressing, in anticipation,\r\n    the retention of the Crimea, viz. as affording suitable winter\r\n    quarters, and as a guarantee in case of peace negotiations.\r\n    On the 7th of September the allied forces had sailed for the\r\n    Crimea; on the 21st the Queen learned by telegram that 25,000\r\n    English, 25,000 French, and 8,000 Turks had landed safely\r\n    without encountering resistance, and begun the march to\r\n    Sebastopol. The Queen, with her usual kindly solicitude for\r\n    the health and comfort of her Ministers, had summoned Lord\r\n    Aberdeen from London to have the benefit of the Scotch air; he\r\n    remained at Balmoral from the 27th till the 30th, when he went\r\n    to his own house at Haddo.

The account sent by Lord Stratford of\r\nthe victory on the Alma must be correct; the report mentioned by Mr\r\nColquhoun[52] may possibly be so too. At all events, we may fairly\r\nhope that the fall of Sebastopol cannot long be delayed.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen has written to Lord Clarendon this morning on the\r\nsubject of the fortifications of Sebastopol, which although, somewhat\r\nembarrassing at the moment, is not attended with any great practical\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen regrets that the speedy return of the post prevents him\r\nfrom sending your Majesty a copy of his letter, which in substance,\r\nhowever, was to the following effect. Without attaching any undue\r\nimportance to the decision, he was inclined to adhere to his first\r\nproposition of the immediate and entire destruction of the works.\r\nHe did not see the advantage of doing the thing by halves; while the\r\ndestruction of the sea defences only might give rise to erroneous\r\nimpressions and would be of an equivocal character. The fall of\r\nSebastopol would in fact be the conquest of the Crimea, and the Allies\r\nmight winter there with perfect security, as, by occupying the\r\nlines of Perekop,[53] any access to the Crimea would effectually be\r\nprevented by land. Lord Aberdeen thought that with a view to peace,\r\nand the restitution of the Crimea to Russia, it would be more easy\r\nfor the Emperor to accept the destruction of the fortifications when\r\naccomplished, than to agree to any stipulation having such an object.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Lord Aberdeen was inclined to think that if the place\r\nshould not be at once destroyed, it might be better to preserve it in\r\nits present state, until the matter should be further considered.\r\nThe Allies would always have it in their power to act as they thought\r\nbest, and the question might in some degree be affected by future\r\nevents. The great objection to leaving the matter undecided for the\r\npresent appeared to be from the possibility of differences hereafter\r\nbetween France and England upon the subject. After the astounding\r\nproposition made to Lord Raglan by the French Generals when actually\r\nembarked and at sea, it would be well to leave nothing in doubt. The\r\nTurks, too, might perhaps desire to have a voice in the matter, and\r\nmight become troublesome....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: Mr (afterwards Sir) Robert Gilmour Colquhoun\r\n    (1803-1870), Agent and Consul-General at Bucharest.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: A district on the isthmus of Crimea, guarded by\r\n    a wall and a ditch, the name meaning \"Cross-ditch.\" The whole\r\n    isthmus is now often called Perekop.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDIAN AFFAIRS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDIA AND RUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marquis of Dalhousie to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, _2nd October 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General presents his most humble duty to your Majesty,\r\nand begs to offer his respectful thanks for the very gracious manner\r\nin which your Majesty has been pleased to acknowledge the offer he has\r\nmade to retain still the Government of India during the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General does not affect to say that he makes no sacrifice\r\nin so doing. Many things unite to warn him that it is time he were\r\ngone: and his family circumstances, in which your Majesty has long\r\nshown so gracious an interest, have rendered the prospect of his\r\nremaining longer absent from England a source of much anxiety and\r\nperplexity to him. But he felt that this was no time for any man, high\r\nor low, to leave his post. And as a seven-years' experience must needs\r\nhave rendered him more capable of immediate usefulness than any other,\r\nthough a far abler man, without such experience could possibly be,\r\nhe did not hesitate to offer the continued service which your Majesty\r\nmight most justly expect, and which he is proud to render cheerfully.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty's remark on the absence of any letter from the\r\nGovernor-General of late would have disquieted him with apprehensions\r\nthat he had been thought neglectful, but that your Majesty at the same\r\ntime ascribed the silence to its real cause. Since the announcement\r\nof the termination of the Burmese War there has, in truth, been no\r\noccurrence which, of itself, seemed worthy of being made the subject\r\nof a report to your Majesty. India has been tranquil in all her\r\nborders. And although no event could well be more gratifying than this\r\ncontinuous tranquillity was in itself, still the periodical report of\r\npeace and quiet on all sides seemed likely to be as uninteresting\r\nas the monotonous, though satisfactory, \"All's well\" of a ring of\r\nsentries.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas the Governor-General anticipated having the honour of\r\nnarrating to your Majesty the events of a year which he hoped would,\r\nbefore its close, have been fruitful of great results....\r\n\r\nVery recently an interesting mission has arrived from the Khan of\r\nKokan, a state to the north of Bokhara, reporting the capture of their\r\nfort of Ak Mussid by the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe fact was known before; but the mission is important from the\r\ncertainty it imparts to us that all the Turcomans, the people of\r\nKokan, of Khiva, and of Bokhara, all detest as much as they dread the\r\nMuscovites, with whose approach they are threatened.\r\n\r\nThe Khan asks for aid. We can render him but little. The only real\r\nbulwark which can be raised for these states of Central Asia--the only\r\nreal barrier to the progress of Russia which can be set up there--must\r\nhave their foundations in the Treaty, which may be framed by the\r\nAllied Powers after the present war shall have brought the spirit of\r\nRussia into temporary subjection.\r\n\r\nThe war in which your Majesty has engaged with that great Power has\r\nnot been directly felt in this part of your Majesty's dominions; but\r\nits indirect influence is most sensibly apparent.\r\n\r\nThe notions entertained of Russia, and the estimate formed of her\r\npowers, by the nations of India, are exaggerated in the extreme.\r\nAlthough our pride must wince on hearing it, it is an unquestionable\r\nfact that the general belief in India at this moment is that Russia\r\ngravely menaces the power of England, and will be more than a match\r\nfor her in the end.\r\n\r\nThis feeling cannot prudently be disregarded. The Governor-General\r\nneed hardly say to your Majesty that he believes that any direct\r\nattack by Russia on these dominions at the present time is utterly\r\nimpracticable; and that there is no more risk of an invasion of\r\nIndia by the Emperor Nicholas than of another by Mahmood of Ghuznee.\r\nNevertheless, the uneasy feeling which now prevails among native\r\nStates and among ourselves, partly of alarm, partly of indefinite\r\nexpectation, ought to be guarded against; and the means of meeting any\r\ndifficulties which may arise out of it should be at our command.\r\n\r\nEarnestly desirous to contribute every possible aid to your Majesty's\r\narms in the great contest now going on in Europe, the Governor-General\r\nhas respectfully placed at the disposal of your Majesty's Ministers\r\nall the four regiments of Royal Cavalry now serving in India. The\r\nInfantry is already hardly adequate for our own necessities: and while\r\nthe Governor-General will be quite ready to accept and to face any\r\nadditional responsibilities which he may be called upon to bear, he\r\nhas felt it to be his duty to state that, beyond the four regiments\r\nof Cavalry, European troops cannot safely be spared from India at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General, however, feels that he is not indulging in any\r\nvain boast when he ventures to assure your Majesty that, under God's\r\ngood blessing, these, your Dominions in the East, are at present\r\nabsolutely safe.... Your Majesty's most obedient, most humble, and\r\ndevoted Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nDALHOUSIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEPOSED INDIAN PRINCES]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MAHARAJAH DHULEEP SINGH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Marquis of Dalhousie._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _2nd October 1854._\r\n\r\nAs the Queen knows that the East India Company are chiefly guided by\r\nLord Dalhousie's advice with respect to all Indian affairs in public\r\nas well as of a more private nature, she thinks that she cannot do\r\nbetter than write to him upon a subject which she _feels_ strongly\r\nupon, and which she is sure that Lord Dalhousie will enter into. It\r\nis the position of those unfortunate Indian Princes who have, either\r\nthemselves or their fathers, been for public reasons deposed. Two\r\ninstances are now before the Queen's eyes upon which she wishes to\r\nstate her opinion.\r\n\r\nThe first is old Prince Gholam Mohammed, and his son Prince Feroz\r\nShah. The Queen understands (though she is not sure of the fact) that\r\nthe old man is here in order to try to obtain his pension continued\r\nto his son. This is very natural, and it strikes the Queen to be an\r\narrangement difficult to be justified, in a moral point of view, to\r\ngive these poor people--who after _all_ were once so mighty--_no_\r\nsecurity beyond their lives. Whilst we remain permanently in\r\npossession of their vast Empire, they receive a pension, which is not\r\n_even_ continued to their descendants. Would it not be much the\r\nbest to allow them, instead of a pension, to hold, perhaps under the\r\nGovernment, a property, which would enable them and their descendants\r\nto live respectably, maintaining a certain rank and position? The\r\nQueen believes that Lord Dalhousie himself suggested this principle in\r\nthe case of the Ameers of Scinde.\r\n\r\nNothing is more painful for _any_ one than the thought that their\r\nchildren and grandchildren have no future, and may become absolutely\r\nbeggars. How much more _dreadful_ must this be to proud people, who,\r\nlike Prince Gholam, are the sons and grandsons of great Princes like\r\nHyder Ali and Tippoo Sahib! Besides it strikes the Queen that the more\r\nkindly we treat Indian Princes, whom _we_ have _conquered_, and the\r\nmore consideration we show for their birth and former grandeur, the\r\nmore we shall attach Indian Princes and Governments to us, and the\r\nmore ready will they be to come under our rule.\r\n\r\nThe second instance is that of the young Maharajah Dhuleep Singh (and\r\nthe Queen must here observe that the favourable opinion she expressed\r\nof him, in her last letter to Lord Dalhousie, has only been confirmed\r\nand strengthened by closer acquaintance). This young Prince has the\r\n_strongest_ claims upon our generosity and sympathy; deposed, for _no_\r\nfault of his, when a little boy of ten years old, he is as innocent\r\nas any private individual of the misdeeds which compelled us to depose\r\nhim, and take possession of his territories. He has besides since\r\nbecome a Christian, whereby he is for ever cut off from his own\r\npeople. His case therefore appears to the Queen still stronger than\r\nthe _former_ one, as he was not even a conquered enemy, but merely\r\npowerless in the hands of the Sikh soldiery.\r\n\r\nThere is something too painful in the idea of a young deposed\r\nSovereign, once so powerful, receiving a pension, and having _no_\r\nsecurity that his children and descendants, and these moreover\r\nChristians, should have any home or position.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hears that Lord Dalhousie himself would wish and advise his\r\npension to be exchanged for a property on which the Maharajah might\r\nlive, which he might improve (giving thereby a most valuable example)\r\nand transmit some day to his descendants, should he have any; she\r\nhopes therefore that this may be so settled, and that he may, on\r\nattaining the age of eighteen, have a comfortable and fitting position\r\nworthy his high rank.\r\n\r\nWhere such a property might be must be of course left to Lord\r\nDalhousie to decide, but the Queen hopes that Lord Dalhousie will give\r\nit his serious attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE AUSTRIAN PROPOSALS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _10th October 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letters of the 8th.[54] She\r\ncannot consider it wise to reject the Austrian proposals _altogether_,\r\nalthough we may usefully amend them. The success in the Crimea ought\r\nto be followed up by strengthening the alliance of the European\r\npowers, else it may turn out a sterile victory, and the English blood\r\nwill have flowed in vain; for supposing even the whole Crimea to fall\r\ninto our hands, it is not likely that the war will be concluded on\r\nthat account. How are England and France to bring it to a termination\r\nsingle-handed? Our Army in the Crimea is the only one we have....\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Austrian proposal promises little performance on\r\nher part, yet the stipulation by Treaty that she will never let the\r\nRussians pass the Pruth again is a positive advantage to us; and the\r\nother, that a defensive and offensive alliance with us is to follow\r\nthe breaking out of the war by Russia against Austria, although being\r\nentirely at _our_ expense, yet realises the chief condition which\r\nwill make Austria hesitate less to bring it to a war with Russia.\r\nShe always (and not without reason) dreaded to have to fight Russia\r\nsingle-handed, and the allied armies in the Crimea could not assist\r\nher. What reason could Austria put forward and justify to Prussia and\r\nGermany, for going to war at this moment? To obtain the evacuation\r\nof the Principalities was a tangible one, indeed the same _we_ put\r\nforward when _we_ declared war; but this is now obtained.\r\n\r\nWe must certainly not allow our policy to be mixed up with the\r\nmiserable German squabbles, but we must acknowledge that Austria, as a\r\nmember of the Confederation, is not and cannot be independent of them.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would accordingly advise a temperate consideration of the\r\nAustrian proposals and an amendment of them in those points which seem\r\nto require them, and which Lord Clarendon clearly points out in his\r\nletter, and the avoidance of anything which could weaken the _accord\r\nEuropéen_.[55]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Napoleon's answer to Lord Cowley with reference to this\r\nvisit to England renders it probable to the Queen that he was not\r\nanxious to have the general invitation changed into a special one,\r\n_obliging_ him to come or to refuse. The answer is almost a refusal\r\nnow, and has not improved our position. The Queen would wish that\r\nno anxiety should be shown to obtain the visit, now that it is quite\r\nclear to the Emperor that he will be _le bienvenu_ at any time. His\r\nreception here ought to be a boon to him and not a boon to us.\r\n\r\nThe Queen fully enters into the feelings of exultation and joy at the\r\nglorious victory of the Alma, but this is somewhat damped by the sad\r\nloss we have sustained, and the thought of the many bereaved families\r\nof all classes who are in mourning for those near and dear to them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: In one of which, in reference to Austria's\r\n    desire for an offensive and defensive treaty with Great\r\n    Britain, Lord Clarendon had described the Austrian terms as\r\n    irritating, and the discussion of them a mere waste of time.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: The Cabinet, at its meeting on the 20th, decided\r\n    to meet the Austrian proposals in the most conciliatory manner\r\n    possible.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ALMA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nHULL, _13th October 1854._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Already far away from my loved beautiful Highlands\r\nand Mountains, I find a few minutes to write and thank you for your\r\nkind letter of the 2nd, with such lively and glowing descriptions of\r\nsuch glorious and beautiful scenery, which I hope and trust to see\r\n_some day_. Still, with all its beauties, I would not exchange it for\r\nour northern beauties, which really they are--for a _lovelier_ country\r\nwith a _more beautiful_ combination of wood and mountain, and river,\r\nand cultivation with the greatest wildness, at the same time close\r\nat hand, cannot, I am sure, be seen; Stockmar is in the greatest\r\nadmiration of it. We left it yesterday morning, slept at Holyrood last\r\nnight, and came here this evening; the good people of this large\r\nport, having since two years entreated us to come here. We shall reach\r\nWindsor to-morrow.\r\n\r\nWe are, and indeed the whole country is, _entirely_ engrossed with one\r\nidea, one _anxious_ thought--the _Crimea_. We have received all the\r\n_most_ interesting and _gratifying_ details of the _splendid_ and\r\ndecisive victory of the Alma; alas! it was a bloody one. Our loss\r\nwas a heavy one--many have fallen and many are wounded, but my noble\r\nTroops behaved with a _courage_ and _desperation_ which was beautiful\r\nto behold. The Russians expected their position would hold out three\r\nweeks; their loss was immense--the whole garrison of Sebastopol\r\nwas out. Since that, the Army has performed a wonderful march to\r\nBalaklava, and the bombardment of Sebastopol has begun. Lord Raglan's\r\nbehaviour was worthy of the old Duke's--such coolness in the midst of\r\nthe hottest fire. We have had all the details from young Burghersh[56]\r\n(a remarkably nice young man), one of Lord Raglan's Aides-de-camp whom\r\nhe sent home with the Despatches, who was in the midst of it all. I\r\nfeel so _proud_ of my dear noble Troops, who, they say, bear their\r\nprivations, and the sad disease which still haunts them, with such\r\ncourage and good humour.\r\n\r\nGeorge did enormously well, and was not touched.

The Queen regrets to find a Clause omitted which stood\r\nin the former French project (rejected by us about three weeks ago),\r\nstipulating that Austria was to prevent the re-entry of Russia into\r\nthe Principalities. Although she would of her own accord have to do\r\nthis, a treaty obligation towards the _belligerents_ to that effect\r\nwould have made a considerable inroad into her position as a _neutral_\r\npower, and secured a co-operation in the war--_ad hoc_ at least.\r\nAustria ought to be told, in the Queen's opinion, that this project\r\nof treaty contains almost nothing; and that her signing it _at once_\r\nwould give a moral pledge of her sincerity towards the Western Powers,\r\nwho have to pay with the lives of their best troops every day that\r\nAustria hesitates to do what in the end she must find it in her own\r\ninterest to do.\r\n\r\nAs to M. Olozaga's proposal,[58] the Queen thinks it ought to be\r\ntreated like all the former ones, viz. met with the remark that we\r\ncannot discuss eventualities implying the dethronement of a Sovereign\r\nwith whom we are on a footing of amity.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57: Lord Clarendon wrote that he and Lord John\r\n    Russell approved of the treaty, but that Lord Aberdeen thought\r\n    that Austria would not accept it; while Lord Palmerston felt\r\n    confident that Austria, even if her co-operation were not now\r\n    secured, would at least not lend her support to the King of\r\n    Prussia's scheme.\r\n\r\n    At this date only partial and misleading accounts had arrived\r\n    of the battle of Balaklava, and it was believed that four\r\n    English (not Turkish) redoubts had been taken; and, while the\r\n    disastrous charge of the Light Brigade had been announced, the\r\n    success of the heavy cavalry was not yet known. Anxiety began\r\n    accordingly to be felt at home as to the adequacy of the\r\n    allied forces to encounter the Russian army, augmented as\r\n    it now was by the troops which had recently evacuated the\r\n    Principalities. Accordingly fresh efforts were being made to\r\n    engage Austria in effectual alliance with the Western Powers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: The document containing this proposal does\r\n    not seem to have been preserved among the papers. It was not\r\n    impossibly a scheme for betrothing King Pedro to the infant\r\n    Princess of the Asturias, thereby uniting the two Crowns, and\r\n    bringing about the dethronement of Queen Isabella.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _9th November 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the letters from Lord Cowley and Count Walewski.[59]\r\nNo consideration on earth ought to stand in the way of our sending\r\nwhat ships we can lay hold of to transport French reinforcements to\r\nthe Crimea, as the safety of our Army and the honour of the Country\r\nare at stake. The Queen is ready to give her own yacht for a transport\r\nwhich could carry 1,000 men. Every account received convinces the\r\nQueen more and more that numbers alone can ensure success in this\r\ninstance, and that without them we are running _serious_ risks.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: The Count wrote that France was ready to send\r\n    20,000 men to the Crimea, if England could furnish transports.\r\n    Lord Clarendon added: \"We have not a single available steamer,\r\n    as all must be left in the Baltic until the ice sets in, and\r\n    the stores, ammunition, and clothing for the Army are going\r\n    out in sailing vessels.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _14th November 1854._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I am quite shocked to find that I missed writing my\r\nletter to-day--but really _la tête me tourne_.

My whole soul and\r\nheart are in the Crimea. The conduct of our _dear noble_ Troops is\r\n_beyond praise_; it is quite heroic, and really I feel a pride to\r\nhave _such Troops_, which is only equalled by my grief for their\r\nsufferings. We now know that there has been a pitched battle on the\r\n6th, in which we have been victorious over much greater numbers, but\r\nwith great loss on both sides--the greatest on the Russian. But we\r\nknow _nothing_ more, and now we must live in a suspense which is\r\nindeed dreadful. Then to think of the numbers of families who are\r\nliving in _such_ anxiety! It is terrible to think of all the wretched\r\nwives and mothers who are awaiting the fate of those nearest and\r\ndearest to them! In short, it is a time which requires courage and\r\npatience to bear as one ought.\r\n\r\nMany thanks, dearest Uncle, for your kind letter of the 11th, which I\r\nreceived on Saturday.

To\r\nmark the Queen's feelings of approbation she wishes to confer on\r\nLord Raglan the Baton of Field-Marshal. It affords her the sincerest\r\ngratification to confer it on one who has so nobly earned the highest\r\nrank in the Army, which he so long served in under the immortal\r\nhero, who she laments could not witness the success of a friend he so\r\ngreatly esteemed.\r\n\r\nBoth the Prince and Queen are anxious to express to Lord Raglan their\r\nunbounded admiration of the heroic conduct of the Army, and their\r\nsincere sympathy in their sufferings and privations so nobly borne.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thanks Lord Raglan for his kind letter of the 28th ultimo.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60: The English loss at the battle of Inkerman was\r\n    over 2,500 killed and wounded; the French lost 1,800.

At first Lord Aberdeen was in doubt\r\nwhether the proposition was made by Lord J. Russell in concert with\r\nLord Palmerston; but this appears not to be the case. Much will\r\ntherefore depend on the decision of Lord Palmerston. Should he join\r\nwith Lord John, matters will probably be pushed to extremity; but\r\nshould he decline, Lord Aberdeen does not think that Lord John will\r\nventure to act alone.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: Lord John Russell urged, in this correspondence,\r\n    that Lord Palmerston should supersede the Duke of Newcastle at\r\n    the War Office.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MAHARAJAH DHULEEP SINGH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Marquis of Dalhousie._\r\n\r\n_24th November 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen thanks Lord Dalhousie for his long and most interesting and\r\nsatisfactory letter of the 2nd of October.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiarly gratifying to hear of such quiet and prosperity in\r\nher vast Indian dominions, in which the Queen ever takes the liveliest\r\ninterest, and at the present moment of intense anxiety, when\r\nEngland's best and noblest blood is being profusely shed to resist the\r\nencroaching spirit of Russia. The heroism of our noble Troops in the\r\nmidst of herculean difficulties and great privations is unequalled,\r\nand will fill Lord Dalhousie's loyal and patriotic heart with pride\r\nand admiration. Though entirely concurring in his opinion that Russia\r\ncan undertake no invasion of India, her spirit of encroachment on the\r\nnorth frontier must be carefully watched and, if possible, put a stop\r\nto, when peace is made.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the railroad will make an immense difference in India,\r\nand tend more than anything else to bring about civilisation, and will\r\nin the end facilitate the spread of Christianity, which hitherto has\r\nmade but very slow progress.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was already aware of the idea formerly entertained by the\r\nMaharajah Dhuleep Singh of marrying the young Princess of Coorg.[63]\r\nAgreeing as she does with Lord Dalhousie in the wisdom of advising the\r\nyoung man to pause before he makes his choice of a wife, she thinks\r\nsuch a marriage between these two most interesting young Christians\r\nmost desirable; indeed, as Lord Dalhousie himself observes, the\r\ndifficulty of any other marriage for either must be great. The young\r\npeople have met and were pleased with each other, so that the Queen\r\nhopes that their union will, in the course of time, come to pass. Her\r\nlittle god-daughter has been here lately, and though still childish\r\nfor her age (she is nearly fourteen) is pretty, lively, intelligent,\r\nand going on satisfactorily in her education.\r\n\r\nOf the young Maharajah, who has now been twice our guest, we can only\r\nspeak in terms of praise. He promises to be a bright example to\r\nall Indian Princes, for he is thoroughly good and amiable, and most\r\nanxious to improve himself.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63: A few years earlier, while still holding his\r\n    ancestral creed, Dhuleep Singh, had made overtures to the\r\n    ex-Rajah of Coorg with a view to his betrothal to the eldest\r\n    daughter of the latter; but at that time the matter was\r\n    dropped. After becoming a Christian, and having also heard of\r\n    the baptism of the Princess of Coorg, the Maharajah renewed\r\n    his proposal, which, however, was not eventually accepted. The\r\n    Princess married an English officer, and died in 1864, aged\r\n    twenty-four.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BATTLE OF INKERMAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar[64] to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCAMP BEFORE SEBASTOPOL, _28th November 1854._\r\n\r\nMADAM,--Your Majesty's very kind letter reached me by the last mail. I\r\navail myself of your permission to write to you again, although there\r\nis not much to say since I last wrote to Prince Albert on the 7th or\r\n8th of this month. I wrote to him soon after the battle of Inkerman,\r\nwhen I was still under the excitement of that fearful scene, and I am\r\nafraid that I made use of expressions that I was afterwards sorry that\r\nI had done. I believe I made some reflections on our Commanders, which\r\nare at all times wrong. By this time your Majesty will, of course,\r\nbe in possession of all the details of that fearful day, on which our\r\nloss was so very great.[65] I made a mistake in stating the number of\r\ndead in the Grenadiers; it was much larger than I stated. I think we\r\nmust have suffered more than any other Corps, for, on the following\r\nday, when the roll was called, two hundred and twenty-five men\r\nwere absent; of these one hundred and one were killed, and the rest\r\nwounded. There cannot be any doubt that we allowed ourselves to be\r\nsurprised, for the first notice we had of the Russians was receiving\r\ntheir heavy shot in the camp of the 2nd Division. Nearly all their\r\ntents were torn by round shot. It is even said that a shell lodged\r\nin an officer's portmanteau, burst, and, of course, scattered all his\r\ngoods to the winds. Experience has made us wise, or rather Lord Raglan\r\nwise, for since that day the French and ourselves have been busy in\r\nentrenching our right; it is now so strong that no enemy can attack us\r\nthere with the slightest chance of success; it is only a pity it\r\nwas not done before. The Turks were chiefly employed making these\r\nredoubts, which is in fact the only thing they have done except\r\nburying the dead Russians. Never shall I forget the sight of the dead\r\nand dying Russians on the field. Some of these poor wretches had to\r\nlie on the field for at least sixty hours before they were removed to\r\nthe hospital tents; the majority of course died. I am afraid this is\r\none of the necessities of war, for we had to remove our own people\r\nfirst. I went round the hospitals next morning. It was a horrid sight\r\nto see the bodies of the men who had died during the night stretched\r\nbefore the tents, and to see the heaps of arms and legs, with the\r\ntrousers and boots still on, that had been cut off by the surgeons.\r\n\r\nThe Russians were so near that most of the officers had to use their\r\nswords and revolvers. Many single acts of daring took place; among\r\nothers, Colonel Percy,[66] of our Regiment, dashed in front of his\r\nCompany, sword in hand, into a dense body of Russians who were in\r\na battery. I was not in the thick of it, but was engaged with an\r\noutlying picquet on the left of the attack. George was in the very\r\nthick of it, and, not seeing me, kept asking some of our men where I\r\nwas. They did not know. He tells me that he thought for a long time I\r\nwas killed, and even fancied that he had seen me lying on the ground;\r\nit turned out later to have been poor Colonel Dawson's[67] body which\r\nhe mistook for me.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th we had a terrible storm, such a one as, fortunately for\r\nmankind, does not happen but very rarely. All our tents of course were\r\nblown down, and we passed the day very uncomfortably; but at sea it\r\nwas terrible. At Balaklava alone more than two hundred and sixty souls\r\nperished, and eleven ships went down. George will have been able\r\nto give you a perfect account of it, for, for many hours, the\r\n_Retribution_ was in imminent danger. I went a few days after the\r\nstorm to see him on board.[68] ... He had a little fever or ague on\r\nhim, but was otherwise well. He has now gone to Constantinople....\r\n\r\nMay I beg of your Majesty to remember me kindly to Prince Albert and\r\nthe Duchess of Kent. I have the honour, etc.\r\n\r\nEDWARD OF SAXE-WEIMAR.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 64: Son of Duke Charles Bernard and Duchess Ida, the\r\n    latter being a Princess of Saxe-Meiningen and sister to Queen\r\n    Adelaide.

The names _Alma_\r\nand _Inkerman_ should likewise be borne on the colours of all the\r\nregiments who have been engaged in these bloody and glorious actions.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is sure that nothing will gratify and encourage our noble\r\ntroops more than the knowledge that this is to be done.\r\n\r\nWe have just had two hours' most interesting conversation with General\r\nBentinck,[69] whose sound good sense and energy make us deeply regret\r\nthat he is not now on the spot; he is, however, ready to go out again\r\nnext year, as Lord Raglan wishes to give him a Division. We hope that,\r\nafter two or three months' rest, he may be able to go out again.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 69: General (afterwards Sir Henry) Bentinck had been\r\n    wounded at Inkerman; he returned to the Crimea to command a\r\n    Division.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _7th December 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He would have\r\nbeen desirous of personally submitting to your Majesty the result of\r\nthe meeting of the Cabinet last night; but he was apprehensive that\r\nhis sudden journey to Windsor Castle this morning would give rise\r\nto speculations and conjectures which, in the present state of the\r\nMinistry, it is as well to avoid.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen thinks he may venture to assure your Majesty that the\r\ncorrespondence recently circulated is regarded by all the Members of\r\nthe Cabinet precisely in the same light; and that the propositions\r\nof Lord John Russell are considered by all as quite untenable. Lord\r\nPalmerston forms no exception; and, whatever may be his views in\r\nfuture, it is clear that at present he contemplates no changes in the\r\nGovernment. Lord John was himself fully aware of this unanimity, and\r\nremained entirely silent with respect to his former suggestions. He\r\ndwelt in general terms on the absence of vigour in the prosecution\r\nof the war, and stated his conviction that the same course would\r\nbe observed in future. He referred to his position in the House of\r\nCommons with much bitterness, and declared that he would never pass\r\nsuch another Session of Parliament as the last. He attributed the\r\nfrequent defeats of the Government in the House of Commons to the\r\nReform Bill having been withdrawn, by which it was shown that hostile\r\nattacks might be made with impunity.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious, however, that the drift of his observations tended to\r\nthe substitution of himself as the Head of the Government rather than\r\nto any change of Departments; and this he did not deny, when Lord\r\nAberdeen pointed out the inference to be drawn from his remarks.\r\n\r\nFinally, Lord John said that he had quite made up his mind. He was\r\nready to continue in office during the short Session before Christmas,\r\nand to defend all that had been done; but that he was determined to\r\nretire after Christmas. An observation being made that it would be\r\nunconstitutional to go into Parliament with such a determination, he\r\nreplied that, if such was the opinion, he would request Lord Aberdeen\r\nto convey his resignation to-morrow morning to your Majesty, which, at\r\nall events, would be perfectly constitutional.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen feels it to be his duty to state to your Majesty that,\r\nwhatever may be the real cause, Lord John has made up his mind to act\r\nin the manner he has announced.\r\n\r\nIn this situation it is Lord Aberdeen's desire to come to your\r\nMajesty's assistance by any means in his power. Lord John's defection\r\nwill be a great blow, from which it is very doubtful if the Government\r\ncould recover; but Lord Aberdeen will come to no conclusion or form\r\nany decided opinion until he shall have had the honour of seeing your\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CABINET DISSENSIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _9th December 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen arrived yesterday evening, leaving the Cabinet sitting,\r\nrevising the Speech from the Throne.[70] He had come to no decision.\r\nSir James Graham and Mr Gladstone had been anxious that he should\r\naccept Lord John's resignation at once. He himself felt reluctant to\r\ndo anything which might be considered harsh towards Lord John, and\r\nmight make him a martyr hereafter. There was no doubt, however, that\r\nthey could not go on with Lord John. The universal feeling of the\r\nCabinet seemed to be one of indignation ... at Lord John's conduct.\r\nNobody had expressed himself stronger about it than Lord Lansdowne to\r\nLord Clarendon, feeling it, as he said, \"quite a necessity to speak\r\nout.\" The Chancellor said he owed his political allegiance to Lord\r\nJohn as well as his office; but as a man of honour he could not go\r\nwith him. Lord Granville feels the same. Lord Palmerston had written\r\na long and very able letter to Lord John, proving the impossibility\r\nof joining the offices of Secretary at War and Secretary of State for\r\nWar. Lord John had now, however, dropped his proposal altogether,\r\nand made it quite clear that it was Lord Aberdeen he wished to have\r\nremoved. He said to Lord Palmerston: \"When the Cabinet was formed,\r\nI always understood that Lord Aberdeen would soon give me up my old\r\nplace; it has now lasted more than two years, and he seemed to get\r\nenamoured with office, and I could not meet the House of Commons in\r\nthe position I was in last Session.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 70: Parliament was to meet on the 12th, chiefly for\r\n    the purpose of passing a Foreign Enlistment Bill, authorising\r\n    the immediate enlistment of 15,000 (afterwards reduced to\r\n    10,000) foreigners, to be drilled in this country.]\r\n\r\nIn answer to Lord Palmerston's enquiry what he would do, and how he\r\ncould expose the Country to such fearful risks at such a moment, he\r\nsaid that he would support the Government out of office. \"You will\r\nsupport it at the head of a very virulent Opposition,\" was Lord\r\nPalmerston's reply; \"and when you have succeeded in overthrowing the\r\nGovernment, which has difficulty enough to hold its ground even with\r\nyour assistance, what will you say to the Country? Will you say:\r\n'Here I am. I have triumphed, and have displaced, in the midst of most\r\nhazardous operations, all the ablest men the Country has produced;\r\nbut I shall take their place with Mr Vernon Smith, Lord Seymour, Lord\r\nMinto, and others....'\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Wood is the only person who says it is all nothing, and he\r\nknows Lord John, and it is sure to blow over.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen said it is come to a point where this is no longer\r\npossible, as he laid his ground not only on the position that the war\r\nhad been badly conducted, but that it _would_ be so for the future.\r\n\r\nAt the Cabinet yesterday a significant incident occurred: Lord John\r\nasked what should become of Reform. Lord Aberdeen's answer was, that\r\nit had been set aside on account of the war, and that as the war was\r\nnow raging at its height, it could not be brought on again. Later,\r\nwhen they came to the passage about Education, Lord John made an\r\nalteration in the Draft, adding something about strengthening the\r\ninstitutions of the Country. Lord Palmerston started up and asked:\r\n\"Does that mean Reform?\" Lord John answered: \"It might or might not.\"\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Lord Palmerston, with a heat of manner which struck\r\nthe whole Cabinet, and was hardly justified by the occasion, \"I wish\r\nit to be understood that I protest against any direct or indirect\r\nattempt to bring forward the Reform question again!\" Lord John,\r\nnettled, muttered to himself, but loud enough to be heard by\r\neverybody: \"Then I shall bring forward the Reform Bill at once.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident to me that after this a junction between Lord Palmerston\r\nand Lord John is impossible, and that it must have been Lord\r\nPalmerston's object to make this clear to the Cabinet. Lord Aberdeen\r\nhas declared that he is quite willing to yield his post to Lord\r\nJohn--but that it would not suffice to have got a head--that there\r\nmust be some Members also, and where are they to be found? He is\r\ncertain that not one of the present Cabinet could now serve under Lord\r\nJohn. An attempt to solve the question how the present Government is\r\nto be maintained, naturally leads everybody to the same conclusion:\r\nthat Lord Palmerston must be substituted for Lord John as the Leader\r\nof the House of Commons. Disagreeable as this must be ... to Lord\r\nAberdeen, and dangerous as the experiment may turn out, we agreed with\r\nLord Aberdeen that he should make the offer to him with the Queen's\r\nconsent. An alternative proposed by Lord Clarendon, that Lord\r\nAberdeen should ask Lord John what he advised him to do under the\r\ncircumstances, was strongly condemned by me, as depriving Lord\r\nAberdeen of all the advantage of the initiative with Lord Palmerston.\r\nLord Aberdeen states his great difficulty to be not only the long\r\nantecedent and mutual opposition between him and Lord Palmerston, but\r\nalso the fact that Lord Palmerston loved war for war's sake, and he\r\npeace for peace' sake.... He consoled himself, however, at last by the\r\nreflection that Lord Palmerston was not worse than Lord John in\r\nthat respect, and, on the other hand, gave greater weight to the\r\nconsideration of what was practicable. It remains open for the present\r\nwhether Lord John is to act as the organ for the Government during the\r\nshort Session, and resign afterwards, or to resign now.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ROKEBY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Hardinge._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _10th December 1854._\r\n\r\nThe Queen is glad to hear of Lord Rokeby's readiness to go out, as she\r\nis sure that he will prove himself an efficient officer in command of\r\nthat noble Brigade of Guards.[71]\r\n\r\nThe Queen must repeat again her opinion relative to General Bentinck.\r\nShe thinks that he ought to go out again, and that, if a division\r\nwere offered to him, he would not hesitate (when he has recruited his\r\nhealth) to go out. For the sake of example it would be most desirable,\r\nfor there evidently is an inclination to ask for leave to go home,\r\nwhich would be very detrimental to the Army.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71: Lord Rokeby had on the previous evening been\r\n    offered and had accepted the command.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _16th December 1854._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty. The Cabinet\r\nmet to-day, and discussed various measures, with a view to their\r\nintroduction into Parliament during the course of the ensuing Session.\r\nIn this discussion Lord John Russell took an active part, and must\r\nhave greatly astonished his colleagues, after their knowledge of\r\nall that had recently passed. Lord Aberdeen had been previously made\r\naware, although not by himself, of the change which had taken place\r\nin Lord John's intentions. After the meeting of the Cabinet, Lord John\r\ncame to Lord Aberdeen, and spoke of the affair of Mr Kennedy,[72] but\r\ndid not seem disposed to advert to any other subject. Lord Aberdeen\r\ntherefore took an opportunity of referring to the correspondence which\r\nhad taken place, and the notice which had been given by Lord John.\r\nWithout any embarrassment, or apparent sense of inconsistency, he at\r\nonce admitted that he had changed his intention, and attributed it\r\nchiefly to a conversation yesterday with Lord Panmure, who, although a\r\ngreat military reformer, had convinced him that the present was not a\r\nfitting time for his proposed changes.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen had not seen any member of the Cabinet this evening\r\nsince the meeting terminated, and does not know how they may be\r\naffected by this change. Some, he feels sure, will be disappointed;\r\nbut, on the whole, he feels disposed to be well satisfied. It is true\r\nthat there can be no security for a single week; and it is impossible\r\nto escape from a sense of self-degradation by submitting to such an\r\nunprecedented state of relations amongst colleagues; but the scandal\r\nof a rupture would be so great, and the evils which might ensue so\r\nincalculable, that Lord Aberdeen is sincerely convinced it will be\r\nmost advantageous for your Majesty's service, and for the public,\r\nto endeavour, by a conciliatory and prudent course of conduct, to\r\npreserve tranquillity and union as long as possible. This does not\r\nexclude the necessity of firmness; and in the present case Lord\r\nAberdeen has yielded nothing whatever, but he has received Lord John's\r\nchange without resentment or displeasure.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 72: Mr Kennedy (who was remotely connected by\r\n    marriage with Lord John) had been removed by Mr Gladstone from\r\n    an office he held.

Early in 1855,\r\nSardinia, under the influence of Cavour, her Premier, joined the\r\nWestern Alliance against Russia. On Parliament re-assembling in\r\nJanuary, Mr Roebuck gave notice of a motion for the appointment of a\r\nCommittee to enquire into the conduct of the war. Lord John Russell,\r\nfinding himself unable to resist the motion, at once resigned, and the\r\nMinistry was overwhelmingly defeated by a majority of more than two\r\nto one. Lord Derby, as Leader of the Conservative Opposition, was\r\nsummoned to form a Ministry, but failed to do so; the age of Lord\r\nLansdowne prevented his accepting the Premiership; and Lord John\r\nRussell, whose action had largely contributed to the defeat of the\r\ncoalition, then attempted the task, but found that he could not\r\ncommand the support even of his old Whig colleagues. The Queen\r\naccordingly desired Lord Palmerston, whom the voice of the country\r\nunmistakably indicated for the Premiership, to construct a Government;\r\nhe was successful in the attempt, the Cabinet being a reconstruction\r\nof that of Lord Aberdeen, with Lord Panmure substituted for the Duke\r\nof Newcastle at the War Office, while Lord John Russell was appointed\r\nBritish Plenipotentiary at the Vienna Conference. The new Premier\r\ndesired to prevent the actual appointment of the Committee which Mr\r\nRoebuck's motion demanded, the displacement of the late Ministry--the\r\nreal objective of the attack--having been effected; but as the House\r\nof Commons manifested a determination to proceed with the appointment\r\nof the Committee, the Peelite section of the Cabinet (Sir James\r\nGraham, Mr Gladstone, and Mr Sidney Herbert) withdrew, and Lord John\r\nRussell, who was then on his way to Vienna, accepted the Secretaryship\r\nof the Colonies. Early in March, the Czar Nicholas died suddenly of\r\npulmonary apoplexy, and the expectation of peace increased; shortly\r\nafterwards, the Emperor and Empress of the French paid a state visit\r\nto this country, and were received with much enthusiasm, the Emperor\r\nbeing made a Knight of the Garter.\r\n\r\nIn February, a determined attack by the Russians upon Eupatoria was\r\nrepulsed by the Turks; the defenders of Sebastopol, however, succeeded\r\nin occupying and fortifying an important position, afterwards known as\r\nthe \"Mamelon.\" The bombardment was resumed by the Allies in April,\r\nand a successful attack made upon Kertsch, from which the supplies\r\nof Sebastopol were mainly drawn; while a squadron under Captain Lyons\r\ndestroyed the Russian magazines and stores in the Sea of Azov. General\r\nCanrobert was succeeded in the French command by General Pélissier,\r\nand on the 7th of June the Mamelon was taken by the French. A\r\ndesperate but, as it proved, unsuccessful assault was then made by\r\nthe Allies on the Redan and Malakhoff batteries; at this juncture Lord\r\nRaglan died, and was succeeded in the command by General Simpson.\r\n\r\nThe Vienna Conference proved abortive, Russia refusing to accept the\r\nthird point, and though a compromise was proposed by Austria, which\r\nwas favoured by the British and French Plenipotentiaries, their\r\nrespective Governments did not ratify their views. The negotiations\r\naccordingly broke down, and Lord John Russell, on his return, used\r\nlanguage in Parliament quite inconsistent with the view which it\r\nafterwards appeared he had urged at Vienna. He was loudly denounced\r\nfor this, and, to avoid Parliamentary censure, again resigned office.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures which became law during the session, were those\r\nfor enabling companies to be formed with limited liability, and for\r\ngranting self-government to some of the Australasian Colonies. The\r\nCommittee appointed by the House of Commons held its meetings in\r\npublic (after a proposal to keep its investigations secret had been\r\nrejected), and, by the casting vote of the Chairman, reported that the\r\nlate Cabinet, when directing the expedition to the Crimea, had had\r\nno adequate information as to the force they would have to encounter\r\nthere; but a motion to \"visit with severe reprehension\" every member\r\nof the Cabinet was parried by carrying the \"previous question.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, the Queen and Prince Albert paid a return visit to the\r\nFrench Emperor, and were received with great magnificence in Paris,\r\nwhile later in the year King Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia visited this\r\ncountry, and was made a Knight of the Garter. On the 9th of August,\r\nSweaborg was severely bombarded by the allied fleets in the Baltic,\r\nand a forlorn attempt to raise the siege of Sebastopol resulted in\r\nanother decisive success at the Tchernaya, the Sardinian contingent\r\nfighting with great bravery. Sebastopol fell on the 8th of September,\r\nafter a siege of three hundred and forty-nine days; the citadel of\r\nKinburn was bombarded and surrendered in October, after which General\r\nSimpson retired, in favour of Sir William Codrington. On the other\r\nhand, the fortress of Kars in Armenia, which had been defended by\r\nGeneral Fenwick Williams, had to surrender to the Russian General\r\nMouravieff, in circumstances, however, so honourable, that the\r\nofficers were allowed to retain their swords, and their General\r\nreceived a Baronetcy and a pension of £1000 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n1855\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE FOUR POINTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _9th January 1855._\r\n\r\nTHE Queen received Lord Clarendon's box by special messenger yesterday\r\nevening. The acceptance by Russia of our interpretation of the\r\nfour points[1] is a most clever, diplomatic man[oe]uvre, and very\r\nembarrassing for us at this moment, before Sebastopol is taken, and\r\nbefore Austria has been compelled to join in the war. It leaves us no\r\nalternative but to meet in conference, which, however, in the Queen's\r\nopinion, ought to be preceded by a despatch to Austria, putting on\r\nrecord our opinion as to the nature and object of the step taken by\r\nRussia, and the advantages she hopes to derive by it from Austria and\r\nGermany, and the disadvantages she expects to inflict on the Western\r\nPowers. As hostilities ought not to be interrupted unless the Russians\r\ngive up Sebastopol and evacuate the Crimea (which would give rest\r\nand quiet to our poor soldiers), there still remains the hope of our\r\ngetting the place before preliminaries of peace could be signed; and\r\nin that case a Peace on the four points would be everything we could\r\ndesire, and much preferable to the chance of future convulsions of the\r\nwhole state of Europe. Russia would then have yielded all our wishes\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nA mere moral defeat, such as Count Buol seems disposed to consider\r\nas sufficient, would soon prove to have been none at all, and Austria\r\nwould be the Power which, to its cost, would find out (when too late)\r\nthat the preponderance of Russia is by no means diminished.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has given her permission to Lord John to go to Paris; he\r\nwill find the Emperor as little able to help himself in this stage of\r\nthe business as ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is afraid that the news of the Russian acceptance may induce\r\nour commanders in the Crimea to rest on their oars, and thinks it\r\nnecessary, therefore, that immediate orders should go out, pointing\r\nout that the early fall of the town is just now more important than\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes Lord Clarendon to communicate this letter to Lord\r\nAberdeen and the Duke of Newcastle.\r\n\r\nShe returns to Windsor this afternoon.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The celebrated \"Four Points\" were--\r\n\r\n      1. Cessation of the Russian protectorate over Moldavia,\r\n           Wallachia, and Servia: the privileges granted by the Sultan\r\n           to the Principalities to be collectively guaranteed by the\r\n           Powers.\r\n      2. Free navigation of the Danube.\r\n      3. Termination of the preponderance of Russia in the Black Sea.\r\n      4. Abandonment by Russia of her claim over any subjects of the\r\n           Porte; the Five Powers to co-operate in obtaining from the\r\n           Sultan the confirmation and observance of the religious\r\n           privileges of the different Christian communities, and to\r\n           turn to account in their common interest the generous\r\n           intentions manifested by the Sultan, without infringing\r\n           his dignity or the independence of his crown.\r\n\r\n    Towards the end of 1854, negotiations as to the Four Points\r\n    had been proceeding between the Allies and Austria, and on the\r\n    28th of December the Three Powers had agreed in communicating\r\n    to Russia a memorandum giving a more exact interpretation of\r\n    the Four Points. This was agreed upon as the basis on which\r\n    the Plenipotentiaries were to meet at Vienna to settle the\r\n    Eastern Question, and to conclude the war.\r\n\r\n    Another event, productive ultimately of results of great\r\n    importance, took place at the end of January. King Victor\r\n    Emmanuel of Sardinia joined the Western Alliance, and\r\n    despatched 15,000 men under General La Marmora to the Crimea.\r\n    This act was inspired by Cavour, the Sardinian Prime Minister,\r\n    who took the step that Austria hesitated to take, and thereby\r\n    established strong claims both upon the Emperor Napoleon and\r\n    Lord Palmerston.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN AND THE GARTER]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _10th January 1855._\r\n\r\nBefore Parliament meets for probably a very stormy Session, the Queen\r\nwishes to give a public testimony of her continued confidence in Lord\r\nAberdeen's administration, by offering him the vacant Blue Ribbon.\r\nThe Queen need not add a word on her personal feelings of regard and\r\nfriendship for Lord Aberdeen, which are known to him now for a long\r\nperiod of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _10th January 1855._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your Majesty. He has\r\nhad the honour of receiving your Majesty's most gracious letter, and\r\nhumbly begs to return your Majesty his grateful acknowledgments for\r\nthis mark of your Majesty's continued confidence and favour. When your\r\nMajesty mentioned the subject to Lord Aberdeen some time ago, he had\r\nnot thought of any such distinction; and perhaps at his time of life,\r\nand with his present prospects, he scarcely ought to do so. There\r\nis no doubt that this unequivocal mark of gracious favour might\r\nstrengthen his hands, and especially in those quarters where it would\r\nbe most useful; but the power of misconstruction and malevolence is\r\nso great that the effect might possibly be more injurious than\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your Majesty would be graciously pleased to permit Lord\r\nAberdeen to reflect a little on the subject, and to submit his\r\nthoughts to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen entreats your Majesty to believe that in this, as\r\nin everything else, it is his desire to look exclusively to your\r\nMajesty's welfare. When he leaves your Majesty's service, your Majesty\r\nmay be fully aware of his many imperfections as a Minister; but he\r\ntrusts that your Majesty will always have reason to regard him as\r\nperfectly disinterested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _11th January 1855._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your Majesty. He has\r\nmaturely reflected on the subject of your Majesty's gracious letter\r\nof yesterday, and he is fully sensible of the very important advantage\r\nwhich, in his official position, he might derive from such a public\r\nand signal proof of your Majesty's confidence and favour.\r\n\r\nAlthough this might naturally give rise to more or less of political\r\nanimadversion, Lord Aberdeen would not hesitate in his decision, if\r\nthe alternative were only between himself and some Peer of high rank\r\nwhose claim consisted in being a supporter of the Government; but Lord\r\nAberdeen believes that he may venture to make a suggestion to your\r\nMajesty, the effect of which would redound to your Majesty's honour,\r\nand which might not prove altogether disadvantageous to himself.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen understands that in consequence of the regulations of\r\nthe Order, Lord Cardigan could not properly receive the Grand Cross\r\nof the Bath. From his rank and station, Lord Cardigan might fairly\r\npretend to the Garter, but his violent party politics would make it\r\nimpossible for Lord Aberdeen, under ordinary circumstances, to submit\r\nhis name to your Majesty for this purpose. At the same time, Lord\r\nCardigan's great gallantry and personal sacrifices seem to afford\r\nhim a just claim to your Majesty's favourable consideration; and Lord\r\nAberdeen believes that to confer upon him the Blue Ribbon at this\r\nmoment would be regarded as a very graceful act on the part of your\r\nMajesty. It is even possible that Lord Aberdeen's political opponents\r\nmight give him some credit for tendering such advice.\r\n\r\nIf therefore your Majesty should be pleased to take the same view of\r\nthis matter, Lord Aberdeen would communicate with Lord Cardigan on his\r\narrival in London, and would willingly postpone all consideration of\r\nyour Majesty's gracious intentions towards himself. But Lord Aberdeen\r\nwill venture humbly to repeat his grateful sense of all your Majesty's\r\nkindness, and his acknowledgments for the expression of sentiments\r\nwhich he can never sufficiently value.[2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Subsequently Lord Aberdeen yielded to the Queen's\r\n    affectionate insistence, and was installed Knight of the\r\n    Garter at a Chapter held on the 7th of February.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: WELFARE OF THE ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Duke of Newcastle._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th January 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the enclosed despatch to the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nwhich she has read with much pleasure, as bringing before Lord\r\nRaglan in an official manner--which will require official enquiry and\r\n_answer_--the various points so urgently requiring his attention and\r\nremedial effort. It is at the same time so delicately worded that it\r\nought not to offend, although it cannot help, from its matter, being\r\npainful to Lord Raglan. The Queen has only one remark to make, viz.\r\nthe entire omission of her name throughout the document. It speaks\r\nsimply in the name of the _People_ of England, and of _their_\r\nsympathy, whilst the Queen feels it to be one of her highest\r\nprerogatives and dearest duties to care for the welfare and success of\r\n_her_ Army. Had the despatch not gone before it was submitted to the\r\nQueen, in a few words the Duke of Newcastle would have rectified this\r\nomission.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle might with truth have added that, making every\r\nallowance for the difficulties before Sebastopol, it is difficult\r\nto imagine how the Army could ever be _moved_ in the field, if the\r\nimpossibility of keeping it alive is felt in a _stationary camp_ only\r\nseven miles from its harbour, with the whole British Navy and hundreds\r\nof transports at its command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _13th January 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of the 11th, and has\r\nsince seen Lord John Russell's letter. It shows that the practice\r\nof the Queen's different Cabinet Ministers going to Paris, to have\r\npersonal explanations with the Emperor, besides being hardly a\r\nconstitutional practice, must lead to much misunderstanding. How is\r\nthe Emperor to distinguish between the views of the Queen's Government\r\nand the private opinions of the different members of the Cabinet, all\r\nmore or less varying, particularly in a Coalition Government?\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes therefore that this will be the last such visit. The\r\nAmbassador is the official organ of communication, and the Foreign\r\nSecretary is responsible for his doing his duty, and has the means of\r\ncontrolling him by his instructions and the despatches he receives,\r\nall of which are placed on record.[3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The cause of Lord John's visit to Paris had been\r\n    the illness there of his sister-in-law, Lady Harriet Elliot;\r\n    but he took the opportunity of conferring both with\r\n    the Emperor and his Ministers on the conduct of the\r\n    war.--Walpole's _Life of Lord John Russell_, chap. XXV.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER FROM LORD RAGLAN]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE COMMISSARIAT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Raglan to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBEFORE SEBASTOPOL, _20th January 1855._\r\n\r\nLord Raglan presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has the\r\nhonour to acknowledge with every sentiment of devotion and gratitude\r\nyour Majesty's most gracious letter of 1st January, and the kind\r\nwishes which your Majesty and the Prince are pleased to unite in\r\noffering to the Army and your Majesty's most humble servant on the\r\noccasion of the New Year.\r\n\r\nThe deep concern and anxiety felt by your Majesty and the Prince for\r\nthe privations of the troops, their unceasing labours, their exposure\r\nto bad weather, and the extensive sickness which prevails among them,\r\nare invaluable proofs of the lively interest which your Majesty and\r\nHis Royal Highness take in the welfare of an Army which, under no\r\ncircumstances, will cease to revere the name, and apply all its best\r\nenergies to the service of your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Raglan can with truth assure your Majesty that his whole time\r\nand all his thoughts are occupied in endeavouring to provide for the\r\nvarious wants of your Majesty's troops. It has not been in his power\r\nto lighten the burthen of their duties. Those exacted from them before\r\nSebastopol are for the preservation of the trenches and batteries; and\r\nthere are many other calls upon the men, more especially when, as at\r\npresent, the roads are so bad that wheeled carriages can no longer\r\nbe used, and that the horse transport is diminished by sickness and\r\ndeath, and that the Commissariat, having no longer any sufficient\r\nmeans of conveyance at its command, cannot bring up the daily supplies\r\nwithout their assistance, thereby adding, however inevitably, to their\r\nlabour and fatigue.\r\n\r\nLord Raglan begs leave to submit, for your Majesty's information, that\r\nthe Allied Armies have no intercourse with the country, and can derive\r\nno resources from it; and consequently all the requirements for\r\nthe conveyance of stores and provisions, as well as the stores and\r\nprovisions themselves, must be imported. Such a necessity forms in\r\nitself a difficulty of vast magnitude, which has been greatly felt by\r\nhim, and has been productive of the most serious consequences to the\r\ncomfort and welfare of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe coffee sent from Constantinople has been received and issued\r\nto the troops green, the Commissariat having no means whatever of\r\nroasting it. Very recently, however, an able officer of the Navy,\r\nCaptain Heath of the _Sanspareil_, undertook to have machines made by\r\nthe engineers on board his ship for roasting coffee; and in this he\r\nhas succeeded, but they have not yet produced as much as is required\r\nfor the daily consumption.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary-General applied to the Treasury for roasted coffee\r\nthree months ago. None has as yet arrived. A very large amount of warm\r\nclothing has been distributed, and your Majesty's soldiers, habited in\r\nthe cloaks of various countries, might be taken for the troops of any\r\nnation as well as those of England.\r\n\r\nHuts have arrived in great abundance, and as much progress is made in\r\ngetting them up as could be hoped for, considering that there has been\r\na very heavy fall of snow, and that a thaw has followed it, and the\r\nextremely limited means of conveyance at command.\r\n\r\nMuch having been said, as Lord Raglan has been given to understand, in\r\nprivate letters, of the inefficiency of the officers of the Staff, he\r\nconsiders it to be due to your Majesty, and a simple act of justice to\r\nthose individuals, to assure your Majesty that he has every reason\r\nto be satisfied with their exertions, their indefatigable zeal, and\r\nundeviating, close attention to their duties, and he may be permitted\r\nto add that the horse and mule transport for the carriage of\r\nprovisions and stores are under the charge of the Commissariat, not of\r\nthe Staff, and that the Department in question engages the men who are\r\nhired to take care of it, and has exclusive authority over them.\r\n\r\nLord Raglan transmitted to the Duke of Newcastle, in the month of\r\nDecember, the report of a Medical Board, which he caused to assemble\r\nat Constantinople for the purpose of ascertaining the state of health\r\nof the Duke of Cambridge. The report evidently showed the necessity of\r\nHis Royal Highness's return to England for its re-establishment.\r\nThis, Lord Raglan knows, was the opinion of the Honourable\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Macdonald,[4] whose attention and devotion to\r\nHis Royal Highness could not be surpassed, and who was himself very\r\nanxious to remain with the Army.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, however, has not gone further than Malta, where, it is said,\r\nhis health has not improved.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The Hon. James Bosville Macdonald [1810-1882],\r\n    son of the third Baron Macdonald, A.D.C., Equerry and Private\r\n    Secretary to the Duke of Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ARMY BOARD]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd January 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's letter of yesterday, giving an\r\naccount of the proceedings of the last Cabinet....\r\n\r\nThe Queen is quite prepared to sanction the proposal of constituting\r\nthe Secretary of State for War, the Commander-in-Chief, the\r\nMaster-General of the Ordnance, and the Secretary at War, a Board on\r\nthe affairs of the Army, which promises more unity of action in\r\nthese Departments, and takes notice of the fact that the powers and\r\nfunctions of the Commander-in-Chief are not to be changed. As these,\r\nhowever, rest entirely on tradition, and are in most cases ambiguous\r\nand undefined, the Queen would wish that they should be clearly\r\ndefined, and this the more so as she transacts certain business\r\ndirectly with him, and ought to be secured against getting into any\r\ncollision with the Secretary of State, who also takes her pleasure,\r\nand gives orders to the Commander-in-Chief. She would further ask to\r\nbe regularly furnished with the Minutes of the proceedings of the new\r\nBoard, in order to remain acquainted with what is going on.\r\n\r\nUnless, however, the Militia be made over to the direction of the\r\nSecretary of State for _War_, our Army system will still remain very\r\nincomplete. The last experience has shown that the Militia will have\r\nto be looked upon as the chief source for recruiting the Army, and\r\nthis will never be done harmoniously and well, unless they both be\r\nbrought under the same control.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Investiture of the Garter, the Queen need not\r\nassure Lord Aberdeen that there are few, if any, on whom she will\r\nconfer the Blue Ribbon with greater pleasure than on so kind and\r\nvalued a friend as he is to us both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _24th January 1855._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he has had\r\nthe honour of receiving your Majesty's gracious invitation to Windsor\r\nCastle.

He had heard that Lord\r\nJohn had written to the Queen, and she showed him the correspondence.\r\nHe then reported that Lord John's letter to him had come without the\r\nslightest notice and warning, and whatever the cause for it might be,\r\nthe object could only be to upset the Government. Upon receiving it,\r\nhe had sent for the Duke of Newcastle and shown it to him. The Duke\r\nat once proposed, that as a sacrifice seemed to be required to appease\r\nthe public for the want of success in the Crimea, he was quite ready\r\nto be that sacrifice, and entreated that Lord Aberdeen would put his\r\noffice into the hands of Lord Palmerston, who possessed the confidence\r\nof the nation; Lord Aberdeen should propose this at once to the\r\nCabinet, he himself would support the Government _out_ of office like\r\n_in_ office. Lord Aberdeen then went to Lord Palmerston to communicate\r\nto him what had happened, and ascertain his feelings. Lord Palmerston\r\nwas disgusted at Lord John's behaviour,[5] and did not consider\r\nhimself the least bound to be guided by him; he admitted that\r\nsomehow or other the Public had a notion that he would manage the War\r\nDepartment better than anybody else; as for himself, he did not expect\r\nto do it half so well as the Duke of Newcastle, but was prepared to\r\ntry it, not to let the Government be dissolved, which at this moment\r\nwould be a real calamity for the country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Lord Palmerston wrote him a most scathing letter\r\n    on the subject.]\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet met at two o'clock, and Lord Aberdeen laid the case\r\nbefore it. The Duke then made his proposal, and was followed by Lord\r\nPalmerston, who stated pretty much the same as he had done in the\r\nmorning, upon which Sir George Grey said it did both the Duke and Lord\r\nPalmerston the highest honour, but he saw no possibility of resisting\r\nMr Roebuck's Motion without Lord John; Sir Charles Wood was of the\r\nsame opinion. Lord Clarendon proposed that, as the Duke had given\r\nup his Department to Lord Palmerston, Lord John might be induced to\r\nremain; but this was at once rejected by Lord Aberdeen on the ground\r\nthat they might be justified in sacrificing the Duke to the wishes\r\nof the Country, but they could not to Lord John, with any degree of\r\nhonour. The upshot was, that the Whig Members of the Cabinet, not\r\nbeing inclined to carry on the Government (including Lord Lansdowne),\r\nthey came to the unanimous determination to tender their resignations.\r\n\r\nThe Queen protested against this, as exposing her and the Country to\r\nthe greatest peril, as it was impossible to change the Government at\r\nthis moment without deranging the whole external policy in diplomacy\r\nand war, and there was nobody to whom the reins could be confided.\r\nLord Derby and his party would never have done, but now he had allied\r\nhimself with Lord Ellenborough, who was determined to have the conduct\r\nof the war....\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen thought yet, that on him[6] devolved the responsibility\r\nof replacing what he wantonly destroyed. The Queen insisted, however,\r\nthat Lord Aberdeen should make one appeal to the Cabinet to stand by\r\nher, which he promised to do to the best of his ability, but without\r\nhope of success. The Cabinet will meet at twelve o'clock to-day, but\r\nat five the Ministers will have to announce their determination to the\r\nHouses of Parliament, as Mr Roebuck's Motion stands for that hour.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: _I.e._, Lord John Russell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN'S JUSTIFICATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _25th January 1855._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

But it is clear that the\r\nenquiry he contemplates could not be carried on without so weakening\r\nthe authority of the Government that it could not usefully go on.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances Lord John Russell has pursued the course which\r\nhe believes to be for the public benefit.\r\n\r\nWith the most sincere respect for Lord Aberdeen, he felt he could\r\nnot abandon his sincere convictions in order to maintain the\r\nAdministration in office.\r\n\r\nIt is the cause of much pain to him that, after sacrificing his\r\nposition in order to secure your Majesty's service from interruption,\r\nhe should not have obtained your Majesty's approbation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _25th January 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of to-day in\r\nexplanation of his resignation. She has done full justice to the\r\nhigh-minded and disinterested manner in which Lord John sacrificed\r\ntwo years ago his position as former Prime Minister and as Leader of a\r\ngreat party, in consenting to serve under Lord Aberdeen, and hopes she\r\nhas sufficiently expressed this to him at the time. He will since\r\nhave found a further proof of her desire to do anything which could\r\nbe agreeable to him in his position, by cheerfully agreeing to all the\r\nvarious changes of offices which he has at different times wished\r\nfor. If Lord John will consider, however, the moment which he has\r\nnow chosen to leave her Government, and the abrupt way in which his\r\nunexpected intention of agreeing in a vote implying censure of the\r\nGovernment was announced to her, he cannot be surprised that she could\r\nnot express her approbation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN'S INDIGNATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _25th January 1855._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen arrived at six o'clock to report the result of the\r\nmeeting of the Cabinet, which was so far satisfactory that they\r\nagreed upon retaining office at present for the purpose of meeting Mr\r\nRoebuck's Motion. They expect (most of them, at least) to be beat and\r\nto have to resign, but they think it more honourable to be driven out\r\nthan to run away. They will meet Parliament therefore without making\r\nany changes in the offices. Lord Aberdeen and the Duke of Newcastle\r\nfancy even that they will have a chance of defeating Mr Roebuck's\r\nMotion. Sir George Grey has declared, however, that, perfectly willing\r\nas he is not to desert his post at this moment, he will consider\r\nhimself at liberty to resign even after success, as he thinks the\r\nGovernment has no chance of standing with Lord John in Opposition.\r\nThe other Whigs would in that case very likely do the same, and the\r\nGovernment come to an end in this way; but it is not impossible that\r\nSir George Grey may be prevailed upon by the Queen to stay. Much must\r\ndepend upon the nature of the Debate.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen seems to have put the Queen's desire that the Cabinet\r\nshould reconsider their former decision in the strongest words, which\r\nseems to have brought about the present result. He saw Lord John this\r\nmorning who, though personally civil towards himself, was very much\r\nexcited and very angry at a letter which he had received from the\r\nQueen. He said he would certainly vote with Mr Roebuck. The Houses are\r\nto be adjourned to-day, and the whole discussion comes on to-morrow.\r\nLord Aberdeen brought a copy of a letter Lord Palmerston had written\r\nto Lord John. The Peelites in the Cabinet, viz. the Dukes of Newcastle\r\nand Argyll, Sir J. Graham, Mr Gladstone, and Mr S. Herbert, seem to be\r\nvery bitter against Lord John, and determined to oppose him should\r\nhe form a Government, whilst they would be willing to support a Derby\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _26th January 1855._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and is\r\nvery grateful for your Majesty's communication of yesterday.\r\n\r\nHe confesses his resignation was very abrupt, but it is the\r\nconsequence of many previous discussions in which his advice had been\r\nrejected or overruled.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell acknowledges the repeated instances of your\r\nMajesty's goodness in permitting him to leave the Foreign Office,\r\nand subsequently to serve without office as Leader of the House\r\nof Commons. These changes, however, were not made without due\r\nconsideration. To be Leader of the House of Commons and Foreign\r\nSecretary is beyond any man's strength. To continue for a long time\r\nLeader without an office becomes absurd. Lord Aberdeen at first\r\nmeant his own continuance in office to be short, which justified the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR ROEBUCK'S MOTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._[7]\r\n\r\n144 PICCADILLY, _26th January 1855._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that Lord John Russell having made his statement, concluding\r\nwith an announcement that he did not mean to vote on Mr Roebuck's\r\nMotion, and Viscount Palmerston having made a few remarks on that\r\nstatement, Mr Roebuck rose to make his Motion; but the paralytic\r\naffection under which he has for some time laboured soon overpowered\r\nhim, and before he had proceeded far in his speech he became so unwell\r\nthat he was obliged to finish abruptly, make his Motion, and sit down.\r\n\r\nMr Sidney Herbert, who was to reply to Mr Roebuck, rose therefore\r\nunder great disadvantage, as he had to reply to a speech which had not\r\nbeen made; but he acquitted himself with great ability, and made an\r\nexcellent statement in explanation and defence of the conduct of the\r\nGovernment. He was followed by Mr Henry Drummond,[8] Colonel North\r\nfor the Motion, Mr Monckton Milnes against it; Lord Granby who, in\r\nsupporting the Motion, praised and defended the Emperor of Russia; Mr\r\nLayard, who in a speech of much animation, gave very strong reasons\r\nto show the great impropriety of the Motion, and ended by saying he\r\nshould vote for it; Sir George Grey, who made a spirited and excellent\r\nspeech; Mr Walpole, who supported the Motion and endeavoured, but\r\nfruitlessly, to establish a similarity between the enquiry proposed by\r\nMr Roebuck and the enquiry in a Committee of the whole House into the\r\nconduct of the Walcheren Expedition when the operation was over and\r\nthe Army had returned to England. Mr Vernon Smith declared that his\r\nconfidence in the Government had been confined to three Members--Lord\r\nLansdowne, Lord John Russell, and Lord Palmerston--and that it was\r\ngreatly diminished by the retirement of Lord John Russell. Colonel\r\nSibthorp,[9] Sir John Fitzgerald, and Mr Knightley[10] followed, and\r\nMr Disraeli having said that his side of the House required that the\r\nDebate should be adjourned, an adjournment to Monday was agreed to;\r\nbut Viscount Palmerston, in consenting to the adjournment, expressed a\r\nstrong hope that the Debate would not be protracted beyond that night.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston regrets to say that the general aspect of the\r\nHouse was not very encouraging.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: His first letter to the Queen as Leader of the\r\n    House of Commons.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: M.P. for West Surrey.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Sibthorp, whose name is almost forgotten, earned\r\n    some fame as an opponent of the Exhibition of 1851, and\r\n    remained faithful to Protection, after Lord Derby and his\r\n    party had dropped it.

It is probable\r\nthat your Majesty may have heard from Lord Palmerston some account\r\nof the debate in the House of Commons last night; but perhaps your\r\nMajesty may not object to learn the impressions which Lord Aberdeen\r\nhas received on the present state of affairs both in and out of the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Lord John Russell has injured his position\r\nby the course which he has pursued. His own friends having remained in\r\nthe Cabinet, is his practical condemnation. He made a very elaborate\r\nand dexterous statement; but which, although very plausible, did not\r\nproduce a good effect. It had been decided that he should be followed\r\nby Mr Gladstone, who was in full possession of the subject; but at the\r\nCabinet yesterday held before the meeting of the House, it was decided\r\nthat Lord Palmerston should follow Lord John, in order to prevent the\r\nappearance of a division in the Cabinet between the Whig and Peelite\r\nMembers. As Lord Palmerston was to act as Leader of the House, the\r\nsubstitution of Mr Gladstone would have appeared strange. But the\r\ndecision was unfortunate, for by all accounts the speech of Lord\r\nPalmerston was singularly unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn the debate which followed, the impression in the House was strongly\r\nagainst the War Department; and the indications which occasionally\r\nappeared of the possibility of Lord Palmerston filling that office\r\nwere received with great cordiality. Sir George Grey made an excellent\r\nspeech, and his censure must have been deeply felt by Lord John.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen has waited until the Cabinet had met to-day before he\r\nhad the honour of writing to your Majesty, in order that he might\r\nlearn the impressions and opinions of the Members, especially of those\r\nwho are in the House of Commons. All agree that if the division had\r\ntaken place last night, Mr Roebuck's Motion would have been carried by\r\na large majority. This still seems to be the prevailing opinion, but\r\nthere is considerable difference. The Motion is so objectionable and\r\nso unconstitutional that delay is likely to be favourable to those who\r\noppose it. A little reflection must produce considerable effect. Lord\r\nAberdeen sees that Mr Gladstone is preparing for a great effort, and\r\nhe will do whatever can be effected by reason and eloquence.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Lord Derby shows some reluctance to accept the\r\nresponsibility of overthrowing the Government; but the part taken last\r\nnight by Mr Walpole, and the notice of a Motion in the House of Lords\r\nby Lord Lyndhurst, would appear to denote a different policy. The\r\nresult of the Division on Monday will depend on the course adopted by\r\nhis friends, _as a party_. It is said that Mr Disraeli has signified a\r\ndifference of opinion from Mr Walpole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEFEAT OF THE MINISTRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n144 PICCADILLY, _30th January 1855._\r\n\r\n(2 A.M.)\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nbegs to state that Mr Roebuck's Motion has been carried by 305 to 148,\r\nbeing a majority of 157 against the Government, a great number of the\r\nLiberal party voting in the majority.\r\n\r\nThe debate was begun by Mr Stafford,[11] who gave a very interesting\r\nbut painful account of the mismanagement which he had witnessed in the\r\nHospitals at Scutari and Sebastopol, while he gave due praise to the\r\nconduct of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge toward the men\r\nunder his command, and related the cheering effect produced by your\r\nMajesty's kind letter, when read by him to the invalids in Hospital.\r\nHe was followed by Mr Bernal Osborne,[12] who found fault with all\r\nthe military arrangements at home, and with the system under which\r\nCommissions in the Army are bought and sold, but who declared that he\r\nshould vote against the Motion.\r\n\r\nMr Henley then supported the Motion, directing his attack chiefly\r\nagainst the management of the Transport Service.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Berkeley,[13] in reply, defended the conduct of the Admiralty.\r\nMajor Beresford supported the Motion, but defended Lord Raglan against\r\nthe attacks of the newspapers. Mr. Rice, Member for Dover, opposed the\r\nMotion. Mr Miles[14] found fault with the Commissariat, and supported\r\nthe Motion, saying that the proposed enquiry would apply a remedy to\r\nthe evils acknowledged to exist in the Army in the Crimea; and Sir\r\nFrancis Baring, after ably pointing out the inconveniences of the\r\nproposed Committee, said he should vote against it, as tending to\r\nprevent those evils from being remedied. Mr Rich criticised the\r\ncomposition of the Ministry, and the conduct of the war, and supported\r\nthe Motion as a means of satisfying public opinion. Sir Edward Lytton\r\nBulwer supported the Motion in a speech of considerable ability, and\r\nwas replied to by Mr Gladstone in a masterly speech, which exhausted\r\nthe subject, and would have convinced hearers who had not made up\r\ntheir minds beforehand.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by Mr Disraeli, who in the course of his speech made\r\nuse of some expressions in regard to Lord John Russell, which drew\r\nfrom Lord John some short explanations as to the course which he\r\nhad pursued. Viscount Palmerston then made some observations on\r\nthe Motion, and, after a few words from Mr Muntz,[15] Mr Thomas\r\nDuncombe[16] asked Mr Roebuck whether, if he carried his Motion,\r\nhe really meant to name and appoint the Committee and prosecute the\r\nenquiry, saying that he hoped and trusted that such was Mr Roebuck's\r\nintention. Mr Roebuck declared that he fully meant to do so, and after\r\na short speech from Mr Roebuck, who lost the thread of his argument in\r\none part of what he said, the House proceeded to a division.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative Party abstained, by order from their Chiefs, from\r\ngiving the cheer of triumph which usually issues from a majority after\r\na vote upon an important occasion....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Augustus Stafford (formerly Stafford O'Brien),\r\n    Secretary of the Admiralty in the Derby Ministry of 1852.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Secretary of the Admiralty, who, contrary to\r\n    modern practice, criticised on this occasion the action of his\r\n    own colleagues.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Maurice Frederick Fitzhardinge Berkeley,\r\n    1788-1867, M.P. for Gloucester 1831-1857.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: M.P. for Bristol.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: M.P. for Birmingham.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: M.P. for Finsbury.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN RESIGNS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY SUMMONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th January 1855._\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen arrived here at three. He came from the Cabinet, and\r\ntendered their unanimous resignation. Nothing could have been better,\r\nhe said, than the feeling of the members towards each other. Had it\r\nnot been for the incessant attempts of Lord John Russell to keep\r\nup Party differences, it must be confessed that the experiment of a\r\ncoalition has succeeded admirably. We discussed future possibilities,\r\nand agreed that there remained nothing to be done but to offer the\r\nGovernment to Lord Derby, whose Party was numerically the strongest,\r\nand had carried the Motion. He supposed Lord Derby would be prepared\r\nfor it, although he must have great difficulties, unless he took in\r\nmen from other Parties, about which, however, nothing could be known\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen means to behave more generously to Lord Derby than he\r\nhad done to him, and felt sure that his colleagues would feel a desire\r\nto support the Queen's new Government.\r\n\r\nHe said Lord Grey's plan[17] had not met with the approbation of the\r\nHouse of Lords. The indignation at Lord John's conduct on all sides\r\nwas strongly on the increase.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen was much affected at having to take leave of us.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: For concentrating in a single department the\r\n    business connected with the administration of the Army.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th January 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen would wish to see Lord Derby at Buckingham Palace (whither\r\nshe is going for a few hours) to-morrow at half-past eleven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Duke of Newcastle._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _31st January 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received the Duke of Newcastle's letter.\r\n\r\nShe readily grants him the permission he asks,[18] and seizes this\r\nopportunity of telling him how much she feels for him during this\r\ntrying time, and what a high sense she shall ever entertain of\r\nhis loyal, high-minded, and patriotic conduct, as well as of his\r\nunremitting exertions to serve his Sovereign and Country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: The Duke, in order to refute Lord John Russell,\r\n    asked leave to state what had passed in the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INTERVIEW WITH LORD DERBY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE LEADERSHIP]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st January 1855._\r\n\r\nWe went up to Buckingham Palace and saw Lord Derby at half-past\r\neleven. The Queen informed him of the resignation of the Government,\r\nand of her desire that he should try to form a new one. She addressed\r\nherself to him as the head of the largest Party in the House of\r\nCommons, and which had by its vote chiefly contributed to the\r\noverthrow of the Government. Lord Derby threw off this responsibility,\r\nsaying that there had been no communication with Mr Roebuck, but that\r\nhis followers could not help voting when Lord John Russell told them\r\non authority that there was the most ample cause for enquiry, and the\r\nwhole country cried out for it. Moreover, the Government, in meeting\r\nthe Motion, laid its chief stress upon its implying a want of\r\nconfidence in the Government--a confidence which they certainly did\r\nnot enjoy. He owned that his Party was the most compact--mustering\r\nabout two hundred and eighty men--but he had no men capable of\r\ngoverning the House of Commons, and he should not be able to present\r\nan Administration that would be accepted by the country unless it was\r\nstrengthened by other combinations; he knew that the whole country\r\ncried out for Lord Palmerston as the only man fit for carrying on\r\nthe war with success, and he owned the necessity of having him in the\r\nGovernment, were it even only to satisfy the French Government, the\r\nconfidence of which was at this moment of the greatest importance;\r\nbut he must say, speaking without reserve, that whatever the ignorant\r\npublic might think, Lord Palmerston was totally unfit for the task. He\r\nhad become very deaf as well as very blind, was seventy-one years\r\nold, and ... in fact, though he still kept up his sprightly manners\r\nof youth, it was evident that his day had gone by.[19] ... Lord Derby\r\nthought, however, he might have the Lead of the House of Commons,\r\nwhich Mr Disraeli was ready to give up to him. For the War Department\r\nthere were but two men--both very able, but both liable to objections:\r\nthe first was Lord Grey, who would do it admirably, but with whom he\r\ndisagreed in general politics, and in this instance on the propriety\r\nof the war, which he himself was determined to carry on with the\r\nutmost vigour; then came his peculiar views about the Amalgamation\r\nof Offices, in which he did not at all agree. The other was Lord\r\nEllenborough, who was very able, and would certainly be very popular\r\nwith the Army, but was very unmanageable; yet he hoped he could keep\r\nhim in order. It might be doubtful whether Lord Hardinge could go on\r\nwith him at the Horse Guards. We agreed in the danger of Lord Grey's\r\nArmy proposal, and had to pronounce the opinion that Lord Ellenborough\r\nwas almost mad. This led us to a long discussion upon the merits of\r\nthe conduct of the war, upon which he seemed to share the general\r\nprejudices, but on being told some of the real facts and difficulties\r\nof the case, owned that these, from obvious reasons, could not be\r\nstated by the Government in their defence, and said that he was aware\r\nthat the chief fault lay at headquarters in the Crimea. Lord Raglan\r\nought to be recalled, as well as his whole staff, and perhaps he could\r\nrender this less painful to him by asking him to join the Cabinet,\r\nwhere his military advice would be of great value.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Lord Derby's judgment was not borne out by\r\n    subsequent events. Lord Palmerston was Prime Minister when\r\n    he died on the 18th of October 1865, ten years later. \"The\r\n    half-opened cabinet-box on his table, and the unfinished\r\n    letter on his desk, testified that he was at his post to the\r\n    last,\"--Ashley's _Life of Lord Palmerston_, vol. ii. p. 273.]\r\n\r\nTo be able to meet the House of Commons, however, Lord Derby said he\r\nrequired the assistance of men like Mr Gladstone and Mr S. Herbert,\r\nand he was anxious to know whether the Queen could tell him upon what\r\nsupport he could reckon in that quarter. We told him we had reason to\r\nbelieve the Peelites would oppose a Government of Lord John Russell,\r\nbut were inclined to support one of Lord Derby's; whether they were\r\ninclined to join in office, however, appeared very doubtful. The Queen\r\nhaving laid great stress on a good selection for the office of Foreign\r\nAffairs, Lord Derby said he would have to return to Lord Malmesbury,\r\nwho, he thought, had done well before, and had now additional\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nShould he not be able to obtain strength from the Peelites, he could\r\nnot be able to form a creditable Government; he must give up the task,\r\nand thought the Queen might try some other combinations with Lord John\r\nRussell or Lord Lansdowne, etc.\r\n\r\nHe did not think a reconstruction of the old Government would be\r\naccepted by the country; however, whatever Government was formed to\r\ncarry on the war, should not only not be opposed by him, but have\r\nhis cordial support, provided it raised no question of general\r\nconstitutional importance.\r\n\r\nShould all attempts fail, he would be ready to come forward to the\r\nrescue of the country with such materials as he had, but it would be\r\n\"a desperate attempt.\"\r\n\r\nLord Derby returned a little before two from Lord Palmerston, to whom\r\nhe had gone in the first instance. Lord Palmerston was ready to accept\r\nthe Lead of the House of Commons, and acknowledged that the man\r\nwho undertook this could not manage the War Department besides. He\r\nundertook to sound Mr Gladstone and Mr S. Herbert, but had, evidently\r\nmuch to Lord Derby's surprise, said that it must be a coalition, and\r\nnot only the taking in of one or two persons, which does not seem\r\nto suit Lord Derby at all--nor was he pleased at Lord Palmerston's\r\nsuggestion that he ought to try, by all means, to retain Lord\r\nClarendon at the Foreign Office. Lord Palmerston was to sound the\r\nPeelites in the afternoon, and Lord Derby is to report the result to\r\nthe Queen this evening.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD CLARENDON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES' SQUARE, _31st January 1855._\r\n          (9:30 P.M.)\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, hastens to submit to your Majesty\r\nthe answer which he has this moment received from Viscount Palmerston\r\nto the communication which he made to him this morning by your\r\nMajesty's command. Lord Derby has not yet received from Mr Sidney\r\nHerbert and Mr Gladstone the answers referred to in Lord Palmerston's\r\nletter; but, from the tenor of the latter, he fears there can be no\r\ndoubt as to their purport. With respect to Lord Clarendon, Lord\r\nDerby is fully sensible of the advantage which might accrue to your\r\nMajesty's service from the continuance in office of a Minister of\r\ngreat ability, who is personally cognizant of all the intricate\r\nnegotiations and correspondence which have taken place for the last\r\ntwo years; and neither personally nor politically would he anticipate\r\non the part of his friends, certainly not on his own part, any\r\ndifficulty under existing circumstances, in co-operating with Lord\r\nClarendon; but the present political relations between Lord Clarendon\r\nand Lord Derby's friends are such that, except upon a special\r\ninjunction from your Majesty, and under your Majesty's immediate\r\nsanction, he would not be justified in making any overtures in that\r\ndirection.[20] Should Lord Derby receive any communication from Mr\r\nGladstone or Mr. Sidney Herbert before morning, he will send it down\r\nto your Majesty by the earliest opportunity in the morning. Lord Derby\r\ntrusts that your Majesty will forgive the haste in which he writes,\r\nhaving actually, at the moment of receiving Lord Palmerston's answer,\r\nwritten a letter to say that he could not longer detain your Majesty's\r\nmessenger. Lord Derby will take no farther step until he shall have\r\nbeen honoured by your Majesty's farther commands.\r\n\r\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant\r\nand Subject,\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S REFUSAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\n_1st February 1855._\r\n\r\nLord Derby came down here at eleven o'clock, and brought with him two\r\nletters he had received from Mr Gladstone and Mr Sidney Herbert, who\r\nboth declared their willingness to give Lord Derby's Government an\r\nindependent support, but on mature consideration their impossibility\r\nto take office in his Administration. Lord Derby said, as to\r\nthe independent support, it reminded him of the definition of an\r\nindependent Member of Parliament, viz. one that could not be depended\r\nupon. Under the circumstances, he would not be able to form such an\r\nAdministration as could effectively carry on the Government.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Although opposed to the ordinary procedure\r\n    of party government, there were recent precedents for such\r\n    overtures being made.

He, however, gave the promise of his support to\r\n    any Government which would carry on the war with energy and\r\n    vigour, and maintain the alliances which had been formed.]\r\n\r\nHe was anxious to carry any message to any other statesman with which\r\nthe Queen might wish to entrust him. This the Queen declined, with her\r\nbest thanks. He then wanted to know what statement Lord Aberdeen would\r\nmake to-night in the House, stating it to be very important that it\r\nshould not appear that the Administration had gone from Lord Aberdeen\r\nthrough any other hands than the ones which should finally accept it.\r\n\r\nIt would be well known that he had been _consulted_ by the Queen, but\r\nthere was no necessity for making it appear that he had undertaken to\r\nform an Administration. The fact was, that he had consulted none of\r\nhis Party except Mr Disraeli, and that his followers would have reason\r\nto complain if they thought that he had put them altogether out of the\r\nquestion. We told him that we did not know what Lord Aberdeen meant to\r\nsay, but the best thing would be on all accounts to state exactly the\r\ntruth as it passed.\r\n\r\nAfter he had taken leave of the Queen with reiterated assurances of\r\ngratitude and loyalty, I had a further long conversation with him,\r\npointing out to him facts with which he could not be familiar,\r\nconcerning our Army in the Crimea, our relations with our Ally,\r\nnegotiations with the German Courts, the state of public men and the\r\nPress in this country, which convinced me that this country was in\r\na crisis of the greatest magnitude, and the Crown in the greatest\r\ndifficulties, which could not be successfully overcome unless\r\npolitical parties would show a little more patriotism than hitherto.\r\nThey behaved a good deal like his independent Member of Parliament,\r\nand tried to aggravate every little mishap in order to get Party\r\nadvantages out of it. I attacked him personally upon his ...\r\nopposition to the Foreign Enlistment Bill, and pointed to the fact\r\nthat the French were now obtaining the services of that very\r\nSwiss Legion we stood so much in need of. His defence was a mere\r\nParliamentary dialectic, accusing the clumsy way in which Ministers\r\nhad introduced their Bill, but he promised to do what he could to\r\nrelieve the difficulties of the country. In conclusion I showed him,\r\nunder injunctions of secrecy, the letter I had received from Count\r\nWalewski, which showed to what a state of degradation the British\r\nCrown had been reduced by the efforts on all sides for Party objects\r\nto exalt the Emperor Napoleon, and make his will and use the sole\r\nstandard for the English Government.[22]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: This curious letter of the Count stated in\r\n    effect that the alliance of England and France, and the\r\n    critical circumstances of the day, made Lords Palmerston and\r\n    Clarendon indispensable members of any Ministry that might be\r\n    formed.]\r\n\r\nLord Derby called it the most audacious thing he had ever seen, adding\r\nthat he had heard that Count Walewski had stated to somebody with\r\nreference to the Vienna Conferences: \"What influence can a country\r\nlike England pretend to exercise, which has no Army and no\r\nGovernment?\"\r\n\r\nI told him he was right, as every one here took pains to prove that\r\nwe had no Army, and to bring about that the Queen should have no\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD LANSDOWNE CONSULTED]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL SUGGESTED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _2nd February 1855._\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne arrived late yesterday evening. The Queen, after having\r\nstated that Lord Derby had given up the task of forming a Government,\r\nasked his advice under the present circumstances, to which he replied\r\nthat he had little advice to give. I interrupted that at least he\r\ncould impart knowledge to the Queen, upon which she could form\r\na decision. The first and chief question was, What was Lord John\r\nRussell's position? Lord Lansdowne declared this to be the most\r\ndifficult question of all to answer. He believed Lord John was not at\r\nall dissatisfied with the position he had assumed, and was under the\r\nbelief that he could form an Administration capable of standing,\r\neven without the support of the Peelites. He (Lord Lansdowne) would\r\ncertainly decline to have anything to do with it, as it could\r\nreceive its support only from the extreme Radical side, which was not\r\nfavourable to Lord John, but shrewd enough to perceive that to obtain\r\na Government that would have to rest entirely upon themselves would\r\nbe the surest mode of pushing their own views. Lord John, although not\r\nintending it, would blindly follow this bias, excusing himself with\r\nthe consideration that he must look for support somewhere. He himself\r\ndoubted, however, even the possibility of Lord John succeeding; but\r\ntill he was brought to see this no strong Government was possible.\r\nWe asked about the Peelites, Lord Palmerston, etc. He did not\r\nknow whether the Peelites would serve with Lord John Russell--they\r\ncertainly would not under him. There was a strong belief, however,\r\nparticularly on the part of Lord Clarendon, and even shared by Lord\r\nPalmerston, that without Lord John a stable Government could not\r\nbe formed. The Queen asked whether they could unite under him (Lord\r\nLansdowne). He replied he had neither youth nor strength to make an\r\nefficient Prime Minister, and although Lord John had often told him\r\n\"If you had been in Aberdeen's place my position would have been quite\r\ndifferent,\" he felt sure Lord John would soon be tired of him and\r\nimpatient to see him gone. He thought an arrangement might be possible\r\nby which Lord Clarendon might be Prime Minister, Lord John go to the\r\nHouse of Lords and take the Foreign Office, and Lord Palmerston\r\nthe Lead in the House of Commons. We told him that would spoil two\r\nefficient men. Lord Clarendon had no courage for Prime Minister, and\r\nLord John had decidedly failed at the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne had had Lord Palmerston with him during the Derby\r\nnegotiation, and clearly seen that at first he was not unwilling to\r\njoin, but had more and more cooled upon it when he went further into\r\nthe matter. Lord Derby and Lord Palmerston had had a full discussion\r\nupon Lord Grey, and discarded him as quite impracticable.... After\r\nmuch farther discussion it was agreed that Lord Lansdowne should go\r\nup to Town this day, see first Lord Palmerston, then the Peelites,\r\nand lastly Lord John, and come to Buckingham Palace at two o'clock,\r\nprepared to give answers upon the question what was feasible and what\r\nnot. He inclines to the belief that we shall have to go through the\r\nceremony at least of entrusting Lord John with the formation of an\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nLord John was not without large following amongst the Whigs, and\r\nwhatever was said about his late conduct in the higher circles,\r\nhe believed that it is well looked upon by the lower classes. His\r\nexpression was, that it would be found that the first and second class\r\ncarriages in the railway train held opposite opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _2nd February 1855._\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne arrived at two o'clock, and reported that he had seen\r\nall the persons intended, but he could not say that he saw his\r\nway more clearly. They all gave pledges generally to support any\r\nGovernment, but were full of difficulties as to their participation in\r\none.\r\n\r\nMr Gladstone would clearly not serve under Lord John--might possibly\r\nwith him--if much pressed by Lord Aberdeen to do so. He would probably\r\nserve under Lord Palmerston. Mr S. Herbert expressed apprehension at\r\nthe effect upon the prospects of peace which would be produced by Lord\r\nPalmerston's being at the head of the Government.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell would not serve under Lord Palmerston, and fancies\r\nhe might form a Whig Administration himself, of which Lord Palmerston,\r\nhowever, must be the chief member. Lord Palmerston would not like\r\nto serve under Lord John Russell--would be ready to form an\r\nAdministration, which could not have duration, however, in his\r\nopinion, if Lord John Russell held aloof!\r\n\r\nHe found Lord John fully impressed with the fact of his having\r\nbrought the Queen into all these difficulties, and of owing her what\r\nreparation he could make. Lord Palmerston also felt that he had\r\nsome amends to make to the Queen for former offences. We asked Lord\r\nLansdowne whether they could not be combined under a third person. He\r\nfelt embarrassed about the answer, having to speak of himself. Both\r\nexpressed their willingness to serve under him--but then he was\r\nseventy-five years old, and crippled with the gout, and could not\r\npossibly undertake such a task except for a few months, when the whole\r\nAdministration would break down--of which he did not wish to be the\r\ncause. In such a case, Lord John had stated to him that the man to be\r\nLeader of the House of Commons was Lord Palmerston, meaning himself\r\nto be transferred to the House of Lords, in his former office as\r\nPresident of the Council.\r\n\r\nWithout presuming to give advice, Lord Lansdowne thought that under\r\nall circumstances it would do good if the Queen was to see Lord John\r\nRussell, and hear from himself what he could do. She could perfectly\r\nkeep it in her power to commission whom she pleased hereafter, even if\r\nLord John should declare himself willing to form a Government.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL SUMMONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _2nd February 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just seen Lord Lansdowne. As what he could tell her has\r\nnot enabled her to see her way out of the difficulties in which the\r\nlate proceedings in Parliament have placed her, she wishes to see Lord\r\nJohn Russell in order to confer with him on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INTERVIEW WITH LORD JOHN]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: NEGOTIATIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria_[23]\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _2nd February 1855._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell came at five o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe Queen said she wished to consult him on the present crisis, and\r\nhear from him how the position of Parties stood at this moment. He\r\nsaid that immediately at the meeting of Parliament a general desire\r\nbecame manifest for a modification of the Government; that the\r\nProtectionists were as hostile to the Peelites as they had been in the\r\nyear '46; that the old Whigs had with difficulty been made to support\r\nthe late Government; that the dissatisfaction with the conduct of the\r\nwar was general, and the country cried out for Lord Palmerston at the\r\nWar Department; that he considered it of the greatest importance\r\nthat Lord Clarendon should remain at the Foreign Office, where he had\r\ngained great reputation, and nobody could replace him. On the\r\nquestion whether Lord Palmerston would be supported if he formed an\r\nAdministration, he said everybody would give a general support, but he\r\ndoubted the Whigs joining him. He did not know what the Peelites\r\nwould do, but they would be an essential element in the Government,\r\nparticularly Mr Gladstone; the best thing would be if Lord Palmerston\r\ntook the lead of the House of Commons. A Government formed by Lord\r\nLansdowne or Lord Clarendon would ensure general support, but Lord\r\nLansdowne had declared that he would not undertake it for more than\r\nthree months, and then the Government would break down again; and we\r\nobjected that Lord Clarendon ought, as he had said, not to be moved\r\nfrom the Foreign Office, to which he agreed. He himself would prefer\r\nto sit on the Fourth Bench and support the Government. The Queen asked\r\nhim whether he thought he could form a Government. After having taken\r\nsome time for reflection, he said he thought he could,[24] but he\r\nthought it difficult without the Peelites, and next to impossible\r\nwithout Lord Palmerston; he did not know whether both or either would\r\nserve with or under him; he would offer Lord Palmerston the choice\r\nbetween the Lead of the House of Commons and the War Department--and\r\nin case he should choose the former, ask himself to be removed to the\r\nHouse of Lords; he had been Leader of the House of Commons since '34,\r\nand as far as being able to support his title, he was enabled to do\r\nso, as his brother, the Duke of Bedford, intended to leave an estate\r\nof £5000 a year to his son. The Queen asked him whether he would do\r\nthe same under the Administration of Lord Lansdowne, for instance;\r\nhe begged to be allowed time to consider that. He acknowledged to the\r\nQueen--on her remark that he had contributed to bring her into the\r\npresent difficulties--that he was bound to do what he could to help\r\nher out of them; and on the Queen's question what he could do, he\r\nanswered that depended very much on what the Queen would wish him to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: This Memorandum, though signed by the Queen, was\r\n    written by the Prince.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Colonel Phipps thus describes Lord Aberdeen's\r\n    comment on Lord John Russell's words:--\"I told Lord Aberdeen\r\n    that Lord John had said that he thought that he could form a\r\n    Government. He laughed very much, and said: 'I am not at all\r\n    surprised at that, but whom will he get to serve under him?\r\n    Has he at present any idea of the extent of the feeling that\r\n    exists against him?' I replied that I thought not, that it was\r\n    difficult for anybody to tell him, but that I thought that it\r\n    was right that he should know what the feeling was, and that\r\n    he would soon discover it when he began to ask people to join\r\n    his Government. Lord Aberdeen said that was very true....\"]\r\n\r\nShe commissioned him finally to meet Lord Lansdowne and Lord\r\nPalmerston, to consult together, and to let Lord Lansdowne bring her\r\nthe result of their deliberation this evening, so that she might see a\r\nlittle more clearly where the prospect of a strong Government lay.\r\n\r\nWe had some further discussion upon Mr Roebuck's Committee, which\r\nhe thinks will not be as inconvenient as all his friends suppose.\r\nIt would meet with great difficulties, and might be precluded from\r\ndrawing up a report. On Lord Grey's Motion[25] and the Army question\r\nhe declared that he held to his Memorandum of the 22nd January which\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle had read to the House of Lords, and acknowledged\r\nthe necessity of maintaining the office of the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nalthough subordinate to the Secretary of State, and retaining the Army\r\nPatronage distinct from the Political Patronage of the Government.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: See _ante_, 30th January, 1855, note 17.]\r\n\r\nI omitted to mention that Lord John, in answer to the question whether\r\nLord Clarendon would serve under Lord Palmerston, answered that he\r\ncould not at all say whether he would; he had mentioned to him the\r\npossibility, when Lord Clarendon drew up and made a long face.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _2nd February 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just seen Lord Lansdowne after his return from his\r\nconference with Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston. As moments are\r\nprecious, and the time is rolling on without the various consultations\r\nwhich Lord Lansdowne has had the kindness and patience to hold with\r\nthe various persons composing the Queen's late Government having led\r\nto any positive result, she feels that she ought to entrust some one\r\nof them with the distinct commission to attempt the formation of a\r\nGovernment. The Queen addresses herself in this instance to Lord John\r\nRussell, as the person who may be considered to have contributed to\r\nthe vote of the House of Commons, which displaced her late Government,\r\nand hopes that he will be able to present her such a Government\r\nas will give a fair promise successfully to overcome the great\r\ndifficulties in which the country is placed. It would give her\r\nparticular satisfaction if Lord Palmerston could join in this\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S ATTEMPT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _2nd February 1855._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He\r\nacknowledges that having contributed to the vote of the House of\r\nCommons, which displaced your Majesty's late Government (although the\r\ndecision would in any case have probably been unfavourable), he is\r\nbound to attempt the formation of a Government.\r\n\r\nAs your Majesty has now entrusted him with this honourable task, and\r\ndesired that Lord Palmerston should join in it, Lord John Russell will\r\nimmediately communicate with Lord Palmerston, and do his utmost to\r\nform a Government which will give a fair promise to overcome the\r\ndifficulties by which the country is surrounded.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell considers Lord Clarendon's co-operation in this task\r\nas absolutely essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _3rd February 1855._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell arrived at half-past one o'clock, and stated that\r\nhe had to report some progress and some obstacles. He had been to Lord\r\nPalmerston, and had a long and very free discussion with him. He (Lord\r\nPalmerston) told him although the general voice of the public had\r\npointed him out as the person who ought to form a Government, he\r\nhad no pretensions himself or personal views, and was quite ready to\r\naccept the lead of the House of Commons under Lord John in the House\r\nof Lords; but that he thought that, if the Queen would see him, now\r\nthat she had seen Lord Derby, Lord John, and Lord Lansdowne, it would\r\nremove any impression that there were personal objections to him\r\nentertained by the Queen, which would much facilitate the position of\r\nthe new Government. They then discussed the whole question of\r\noffices, agreed that Lord Panmure would be the best person for the War\r\nDepartment; that Lord Grey could not be asked to join, as his views\r\non the Foreign Policy differed so much from theirs, and he had always\r\nbeen an intractable colleague; that if Mr Gladstone could not be\r\nprevailed upon to join, Mr Labouchere,[26] although an infinitely\r\nweaker appointment, might be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir F.\r\nBaring replace Sir J. Graham, if he could not be got to stay.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: He had been President of the Board of Trade in\r\n    the former administration of Lord John Russell.]\r\n\r\nLord John then saw Mr S. Herbert, who declared to him that it was\r\nimpossible for any of the Peelites to join his Government, connected\r\nas they were with Lord Aberdeen and the Duke of Newcastle, but that\r\nthey would infinitely prefer a Government of Lord John's to one of\r\nLord Palmerston, whose views on Foreign Policy, uncontrolled by Lord\r\nAberdeen, they sincerely dreaded.\r\n\r\nLord John then went to Lord Clarendon, and was surprised to find that\r\nhe could not make up his mind to remain at the Foreign Office under\r\nhis Government. Lord John thought that the expression of a wish on\r\nthe part of the Queen would go a great way to reconcile him. His\r\nobjections were that he had always received the handsomest support\r\nfrom the Peelites, and thought the Government too weak without their\r\nadministrative ability.\r\n\r\nLord John had seen none of his own friends, such as Sir G. Grey, Sir\r\nC. Wood, Lord Lansdowne, and Lord Granville, but had not the smallest\r\ndoubt that they would cordially co-operate with him.\r\n\r\nLord John is to come again at a quarter before six o'clock. The Queen\r\nhas appointed Lord Palmerston for three o'clock, and Lord Clarendon at\r\nfour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ATTITUDE OF THE PEELITES]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE FOREIGN OFFICE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD CLARENDON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._[27]\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _3rd February 1855._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: This Memorandum, though signed by the Queen, was\r\n    written by the Prince.]\r\n\r\nIn the Audience which the Queen has just granted to Lord Palmerston,\r\nhe thanked her for the message which she had sent him through Lord\r\nJohn Russell, and declared his readiness to serve her in any way he\r\ncould under the present difficulties. He had preferred the lead of\r\nthe House of Commons to the War Department, having to make a choice\r\nbetween two duties which no man could perform together.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question from the Queen, he said he hoped that the\r\npresent irritation in the Whig party would subside, and that he would\r\nbe able to complete a Government. He regretted that the Peelites\r\nthought it impossible for them to join, which would make it very\r\ndifficult for Lord John. He had just heard from Count Walewski that\r\nLord Clarendon was very much disinclined to remain at the Foreign\r\nOffice under Lord John. They were to have a meeting at Lord John's at\r\nfive, where he hoped to find that he had waived his objections; but he\r\nmust say that if Lord Clarendon persisted he must himself withdraw, as\r\nhe had indeed made it a condition with Lord John. The Queen asked him\r\nwhether, if this attempt failed, she could reckon upon his services in\r\nany other combination. His answer was that it was better not to answer\r\nfor more than one question at a time; we must now suppose that this\r\nwill succeed.\r\n\r\nWhat he stated with reference to the Army question and the Committee\r\nof the House of Commons was perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon, whom we saw at four o'clock, complained very much of\r\nthe unfairness of Lord John in making him personally answerable for\r\nimpeding the progress of Lord John's Government. The fact was that his\r\nopinion was only that of every other member of the late Government,\r\nand of the public at large; which could be heard and seen by anybody\r\nwho chose to listen or to read. So impossible had it appeared to the\r\npublic that Lord John should be blind enough to consider his being\r\nable to form a Government feasible, that it was generally supposed\r\nthat he had been urged to do so by the Queen, in order to escape\r\nthe necessity of Lord Palmerston. He acknowledged that the Queen's\r\ndecision in that respect had been the perfectly correct and\r\nconstitutional one, and perhaps necessary to clear the way; but he\r\nhoped that for her own sake, and to prevent false impressions\r\ntaking root in the public mind, the Queen would give afterwards Lord\r\nPalmerston his fair turn also, though he could not say that he would\r\nbe able to form an Administration. The Queen said that this was her\r\nintention, that she never had expected that Lord John would be able\r\nto form one, but that it was necessary that his eyes should be opened;\r\nLord Clarendon only regretted the precious time that was lost.\r\n\r\nHe must really say that he thought he could do no good in joining Lord\r\nJohn; his Government would be \"a stillborn Government,\" which \"the\r\ncountry would tread under foot the first day,\" composed as it would be\r\nof the same men who had been bankrupt in 1852, minus the two best men\r\nin it, viz. Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey, and the head of it ruined\r\nin public opinion. If he were even to stay at the Foreign Office, his\r\nlanguage to foreign countries would lose all its weight from being\r\nknown not to rest upon the public opinion of England, and all this\r\nwould become much worse when it became known that from the first day\r\nof Lord John's entering into Lord Aberdeen's Government, he had only\r\nhad one idea, viz. that of tripping him up, expel the Peelites, and\r\nplace himself at the head of an exclusive Whig Ministry. Besides,\r\nhe felt that the conduct of all his colleagues had been most\r\nstraightforward and honourable towards him, and he was not prepared\r\n\"to step over their dead bodies to the man who had killed them.\" The\r\nattempt of Lord John ought _not_ to succeed if public morality were\r\nto be upheld in this country. He had avoided Lord John ever since his\r\nretirement, but he would have now to speak out to him, as when he was\r\nasked to embark his honour he had a right to count the cost.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne had no intention to go to Lord John's meeting, as he\r\nhad originally taken leave of public life, and had only entered the\r\nCoalition Government in order to facilitate its cohesion; among a\r\nGovernment of pure Whigs he was not wanted, for there was no danger\r\nof their not _cohering_. Sir C. Wood declared he had no business to be\r\nwhere Lord Lansdowne refused to go in.\r\n\r\nHe thought Lord Palmerston would have equal difficulty in forming an\r\nadministration, but when that had failed some solid combination would\r\nbecome possible.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne had declared that he could not place himself at the\r\nhead for more than three months, but that was a long time in these\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FRESH DIFFICULTIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell returned at six o'clock from his meeting, much\r\nput out and disturbed. He said he had nothing good to report. Mr\r\nGladstone, whom he had seen, had declined to act with him, saying that\r\nthe country did not wish for Coalitions at this moment. Sir J. Graham,\r\nwhom he had visited, had informed him that the feeling against him was\r\nvery strong just now, precluding support in Parliament; he gave him\r\ncredit for good intentions, but said the whole difficulty was owing\r\nto what he termed his (Lord John's) _rashness_. He felt he could not\r\nseparate from Lord Aberdeen, and had no confidence in the views of\r\nForeign Affairs of Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nHe had then seen Sir George Grey, who told him he had no idea that\r\na Government of Lord John's could stand at this moment; the country\r\nwanted Lord Palmerston either as War Minister or as Prime Minister.\r\nHe must hesitate to engage himself in Lord John's Government, which,\r\nseparated from the Peelites, would find no favour. Lord Clarendon\r\nhad reiterated his objections, saying always that this must be gone\r\nthrough, and something new would come up at the end, when all these\r\nattempts had failed. He could not understand what this should be. Did\r\nLord Clarendon think of himself as the head of the new combination? I\r\nasked what Lord Lansdowne had said. He answered he had a letter from\r\nhim, which was not very agreeable either. He read it to us. It was\r\nto the purport--that as Lord John had been commissioned to form an\r\nAdministration, and he did not intend to join it, he thought it better\r\nnot to come to his house in order to avoid misconstruction. Lord John\r\nwound up, saying that he had asked Lord Clarendon and Sir G. Grey to\r\nreflect further, and to give their final answer to-morrow morning.\r\nThe loss of the Peelites would be a great blow to him, which might\r\nbe overcome, however; but if his own particular friends, like Lord\r\nClarendon and Sir G. Grey, deserted him, he felt that he could go on\r\nno farther, and he hoped the Queen would feel that he had done all he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN'S FAILURE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._[28]\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _3rd February 1855._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: This Memorandum, though signed by the Queen, was\r\n    written by the Prince.]\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne arrived at half-past nine in the evening, and met our\r\nquestion whether he had anything satisfactory to report, with the\r\nremark that he saw his way less than ever, and that matters had rather\r\ngone backward since he had been here in the morning. He had been\r\nin the afternoon at Sir James Graham's bedside, who had had a\r\nconsultation with Mr Gladstone, and declared to him that the country\r\nwas tired of Coalitions, and wanted a united Cabinet; that they (the\r\nPeelites) could not possibly serve under Lord John or even with him\r\nafter what had happened; that he felt the strongest objections to\r\nserving under Lord Palmerston. They were one and all for the vigorous\r\nprosecution of the war, but in order to attain a speedy peace. Lord\r\nPalmerston was known to entertain ulterior views, on which he was\r\nsecretly agreed with the Emperor of the French; and when it came to\r\nthe question of negotiations, the Government was sure to break up on\r\na ground most dangerous to the country. Lord Lansdowne could but agree\r\nin all this, and added he had been tempted to feel his pulse to know\r\nhow much it had gone down since he had been with Sir James.\r\n\r\nThe meeting between Lord Palmerston and Lord John had just taken place\r\nin his presence. They had discussed everything most openly, but being\r\nboth very guarded to say nothing which could lead the other to believe\r\nthat the one would serve under the other. He confessed everything was\r\ndarker now than before. They both seemed to wish to form a Government,\r\nbut he could really not advise the Queen what to do under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nI summed up that the Queen appeared to me reduced to the necessity\r\nof now entrusting one of the two with a _positive_ commission. It\r\nwas very important that it should not appear that the Queen had any\r\npersonal objection to Lord Palmerston; on the other hand, under such\r\ndoubtful circumstances, it would be safest for the Queen to follow\r\nthat course which was clearly the most constitutional, and this was,\r\nafter having failed with Lord Derby, to go to Lord John, who was the\r\nother party to the destruction of the late Government. The Queen might\r\nwrite such a letter to Lord John as would record the political reasons\r\nwhich led to her determination. Lord Lansdowne highly approved of\r\nthis, and suggested the addition of an expression of the Queen's hope\r\nof seeing Lord Palmerston associated in that formation.\r\n\r\nI drew up the annexed draft which Lord Lansdowne read over and\r\nentirely approved.\r\n\r\nHe has no idea that Lord John will succeed in his task, but thinks it\r\na necessary course to go through, and most wholesome to Lord John to\r\nhave his eyes opened to his own position, of which he verily believed\r\nhe was not the least aware.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _4th February 1855._\r\n\r\nThe Queen quite approves of the pension to Sir G. Grey, which he has\r\nfully earned, but would wish Lord Aberdeen well to consider the exact\r\nmoment at which to offer it to him, as Sir George is so very delicate\r\nin his feelings of honour. Lord John Russell will probably have\r\nto give up the task of forming an Administration on account of Sir\r\nGeorge's declining to join him. If the pension were offered to him by\r\nLord Aberdeen during the progress of negotiations, he could not help\r\nfeeling, she thinks, exceedingly embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _4th February 1855._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty.

He said there were circumstances which\r\nprevented him from submitting a List of the Cabinet, but would at all\r\nevents be able to do so in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nLords Lansdowne, Clarendon, Granville, Sir G. Grey, Sir C. Wood,\r\nSir William Molesworth, and the Chancellor had consented to\r\nserve--unconditionally--having withdrawn their former conditions in\r\nconsequence of the very general opinion expressed out of doors that\r\nthe country could not much longer be left without a Government. He\r\nheard this had also made an impression upon the Peelites, who had\r\nrefused to join. He submitted their letters (declining) to the\r\nQueen, of which copies are here annexed. They had been written after\r\nconsultation with Sir J. Graham, but Lord Aberdeen and the Duke of\r\nNewcastle having heard of it, have since exerted themselves strongly\r\nto prevail upon them to change their opinion, and it was still\r\npossible that they would do so. Lord Clarendon had suggested that if\r\nLord Aberdeen himself was invited to join the Government, and could\r\nbe induced to do so, this would obviate all difficulty. He had in\r\nconsequence asked Lord Lansdowne to see Lord Aberdeen on the subject,\r\nas his joining could only be agreeable to him. Many of the Peelites\r\nnot in the late Cabinet had strongly disapproved of the decision\r\ntaken by Mr Gladstone and friends, and offered their services, amongst\r\nothers Lord Canning, Lord Elcho,[30] and Mr Cardwell.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: Now Earl of Wemyss.]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston had been with Lord John Russell yesterday, and had had\r\na very long conversation with him in a most friendly tone; he asked\r\nLord John whether he would follow out the proposal which he had lately\r\nmade himself, and take the lead in the House of Lords as President of\r\nthe Council. He declined, however, saying he preferred to stay out of\r\noffice and to remain in the House of Commons, which Lord Palmerston\r\nobviously much regretted. They went, however, together all over the\r\noffices and their best distribution. He would recommend Lord Panmure\r\nfor the War Department and Mr Layard as Under Secretary....

Herbert._\r\n\r\nARGYLL HOUSE, _6th February 1855_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HERBERT,--I received your letter too late to answer it last\r\nnight. In fact, I had gone to bed.\r\n\r\nYou say that you are in a great difficulty as to the course you ought\r\nto take. I am in none whatever.\r\n\r\nI gave you my decided opinion yesterday that you ought to continue in\r\nPalmerston's Administration; and I endeavoured to support this opinion\r\nby the very arguments which you repeat in your letter to me. Surely\r\nthis letter ought to have been addressed to Gladstone and Graham,\r\nand not to me. I fully concur in thinking that you came to a wrong\r\nconclusion yesterday, and I would fain hope that it would still be\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nWhen you sent to me yesterday to attend your meeting, I certainly\r\nhoped it was with the intention of following my advice.\r\n\r\nYour reluctance to continue in Palmerston's Cabinet is chiefly founded\r\non the apprehension that he will pursue a warlike policy beyond\r\nreasonable bounds. I have already told you that I have had some\r\nexplanations with him on the terms of peace, with which I am\r\nsatisfied. But whatever may be his inclinations, you ought to rely\r\non the weight of your own character and opinions in the Cabinet. I am\r\npersuaded that the sentiments of the great majority of the Members of\r\nthe Cabinet are similar to your own, and that you may fairly expect\r\nreason and sound policy to prevail in the question of peace and war.\r\n\r\nBut above all I have recently had some very full conversations\r\nwith Clarendon on the subject, and I am entirely satisfied with his\r\ndisposition and intentions. I am sanguine in the belief that he will\r\ngive effect to his present views.\r\n\r\nA perseverance in the refusal to join Palmerston will produce very\r\nserious effects, and will never be attributed to its true cause. The\r\npublic feeling will be strongly pronounced against you, and you will\r\ngreatly suffer in reputation, if you persevere at such a moment as\r\nthis in refusing to continue in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the public necessity, I think you owe much to our late\r\nWhig colleagues, who behaved so nobly and generously towards us\r\nafter Lord John's resignation. They have some right to expect this\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nAlthough your arguments do not apply to me, for I yesterday adopted\r\nthem all, you conclude your letter by pressing me to enter the\r\nCabinet. Now there is really no sense in this, and I cannot imagine\r\nhow you can seriously propose it. You would expose me to a gratuitous\r\nindignity, to which no one ought to expect me to submit. I say\r\n_gratuitous_, because I could not be of the slightest use in such a\r\nsituation for the purpose you require.\r\n\r\nI can retire with perfect equanimity from the Government in\r\nconsequence of the vote of the House of Commons; but to be stigmatised\r\nas the Head and tolerated as the subordinate member I cannot endure.\r\n\r\nIf at any future time my presence should be required in a Cabinet, I\r\nshould feel no objection to accept any office, or to enter it without\r\noffice. But to be the Head of a Cabinet to-day, and to become a\r\nsubordinate member of the very same Cabinet to-morrow, would be a\r\ndegradation to which I could never submit, that I would rather die\r\nthan do so--and indeed the sense of it would go far to kill me.\r\n\r\nIf you tell me that your retaining your present offices, without the\r\nslightest sacrifice, but on the contrary with the approbation of all,\r\nis in any degree to depend on my taking such a course, I can only\r\nsay that, as friends, I cannot believe it possible that you should be\r\nguilty of such wanton cruelty without any national object.\r\n\r\nI must, then, again earnestly exhort you to reconsider the decision of\r\nyesterday, and to continue to form part of the Government. I will do\r\nanything in my power to facilitate this. If you like, I will go to\r\nPalmerston and promote any explanation between him and Gladstone on\r\nthe subject of peace and war. Or I will tell him that you have yielded\r\nto my strong recommendation. In short, I am ready to do anything in my\r\npower.\r\n\r\nI wish you to show this letter to Gladstone and to Graham, to whom, as\r\nyou will see, it is addressed as much as to yourself.\r\n\r\nI hope to meet you this morning, and Gladstone will also come to the\r\nAdmiralty.

It is considered by the Members of the proposed\r\nCabinet to be a matter of great importance that Lord Lansdowne should\r\nnot only be a Member of the Cabinet, but that he should also be the\r\nOrgan of the Government in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston pressed this upon Lord Lansdowne yesterday\r\nafternoon, and was under the impression that Lord Lansdowne had\r\nconsented to be so acknowledged, with the understanding that Lord\r\nGranville, as President of the Council, should relieve him from the\r\npressure of the daily business of the House, while Lord Clarendon\r\nwould take the burthen of Foreign Office discussions, and that thus\r\nthe ordinary duties of Leader of the House of Lords would be performed\r\nby others, while Lord Lansdowne would still be the directing chief,\r\nwho would give a character and tone to the body. But Viscount\r\nPalmerston learns this morning from Lord Granville and Lord\r\nBessborough that Lord Lansdowne does not so understand the matter,\r\nand is unwilling to assume the ostensible Leadership, even upon the\r\nabove-mentioned arrangement, and that he wishes Lord Granville to be\r\nthe Leader in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nLord Granville, however, with reason urges that there are many members\r\nof the House of Lords who would show to Lord Lansdowne, from his long\r\nstanding and high political position, a deference which they would not\r\nshow towards Lord Granville, so much younger a man. If Lord Lansdowne\r\nwere in Town, Viscount Palmerston would have gone to him strongly to\r\nentreat him to be the person to announce in the House of Lords the\r\nformation of a Ministry, and to continue to be the organ of the\r\nGovernment in that House, at least till Easter, and upon such matters\r\nand occasions as might require the weight of his authority; but if\r\nyour Majesty were to view the matter in the same light in which it has\r\npresented itself to Viscount Palmerston, to the Chancellor, to Lord\r\nClarendon, to Lord Granville and others, and if your Majesty should\r\nthink fit to express an opinion upon it to Lord Lansdowne, such an\r\nopinion would no doubt have great weight with Lord Lansdowne.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston submits a list of the proposed Cabinet. Until Sir\r\nGeorge Grey returns to Town this afternoon from Portsmouth, whither he\r\nwent yesterday evening to take leave of his son, who has a commission\r\nin the Rifles,[32] and was to embark this morning for the Crimea,\r\nViscount Palmerston will not know whether he prefers the Colonial\r\nOffice or the Home Office. Whichever of the two he chooses, Mr Herbert\r\nwill take the other. Viscount Palmerston does not submit to your\r\nMajesty the name of any person for the office of Secretary at War, as\r\nhe proposes that that office shall merge in the office of Secretary of\r\nState for the War Department, and Viscount Palmerston suspends for\r\nthe present any recommendation to your Majesty for the office of\r\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as that office may be made\r\navailable for giving strength either in the House of Lords or in the\r\nHouse of Commons according to circumstances.\r\n\r\n  PROPOSED CABINET.\r\n\r\n  _First Lord of Treasury_           Viscount PALMERSTON.\r\n  _Organ of the Government or_    }  Marquis of LANSDOWNE.\r\n    _Leader of the House of Lords_}\r\n  _Lord Chancellor_                  Lord CRANWORTH.\r\n  _President of the Council_         Earl GRANVILLE.\r\n  _Privy Seal_                       Duke of ARGYLL.\r\n  _Foreign Affairs_                  Earl of CLARENDON.\r\n  _War Department_                   Lord PANMURE.\r\n  _Home Office_                     {Mr SIDNEY HERBERT\r\n                                    {  or Sir GEORGE GREY.\r\n  _Colonial Department_             {Sir GEORGE GREY or\r\n                                    {  Mr SIDNEY HERBERT.\r\n  _Admiralty_                        Sir JAMES GRAHAM.\r\n  _Chancellor of Exchequer_          Mr GLADSTONE.\r\n  _India Board_                      Sir CHARLES WOOD.\r\n  _Board of Works_                   Sir WILLIAM MOLESWORTH.\r\n  _Post Office_                      VISCOUNT CANNING.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: George Henry Grey, afterwards Lieut.-Colonel\r\n    of the Northumberland Militia, and Captain in the Grenadier\r\n    Guards; father of the present Sir Edward Grey, M.P.

The general opinion was\r\nthat the best way of meeting the Motion for naming the Committee\r\nwhich Mr Roebuck has fixed for next Thursday, would be to move some\r\ninstruction to the Committee directing or limiting the range of its\r\nenquiry. This is a matter, however, which will be well considered at\r\nthe meeting of the Cabinet to-morrow....\r\n\r\nThe reason alleged for the determination of Members to vote for Mr\r\nRoebuck's Committee is the general desire throughout the Country\r\nthat an enquiry should be instituted to ascertain the causes of the\r\nsufferings of your Majesty's troops in the Crimea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of Prussia._ [_Translation._]\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _20th February 1855_.\r\n\r\nDEAREST BROTHER,--I must not let Lord John Russell visit Berlin\r\nwithout personally recommending him to your Majesty--an honour\r\nwhich he deserves in a high degree, as a statesman of wide outlook,\r\nwell-informed, and moderate.

I told him, however, the substance of Lord\r\nPalmerston's letter, and of the Queen's answer, the wisdom of which,\r\nhe said, nobody could doubt for a moment, and added that the choice\r\nlying only between many evils, I hoped he and his friends would not\r\nstrive to obtain an absolute good, and thereby lose the Queen the\r\nservices of an efficient Government. He begged that I should rest\r\nassured that the first and primary consideration which would guide\r\ntheir determination would be the position of the Crown in these\r\ncritical circumstances. He had had no opportunity of consulting these\r\nlast days either Mr S. Herbert or Sir James Graham. But for himself he\r\nfelt the greatest difficulty in letting the House of Commons succeed\r\nin what he must consider a most unconstitutional, most presumptuous,\r\nand most dangerous course, after which it would be impossible for\r\nthe Executive ever to oppose again the most absurd and preposterous\r\ndemands for enquiry.[37]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: See _post_, 21st February, 1855, note 38.]\r\n\r\nI asked, \"But can you stop it?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered: I believe Lord Palmerston made a mistake in not grappling\r\nwith it from the first, and using all the power the Crown had\r\nentrusted to him, even ostentatiously, for the purpose. Now it might\r\nbe most difficult--but it ought not to pass without a solemn protest\r\non the part of the men who were not connected with the Government,\r\nand should not be supposed to have any other than the interests of\r\nthe Country at heart. A Government was powerless in resisting such an\r\nencroachment of the House, where the whole Opposition, from personal\r\nmotives, and the supporters of Government from fear of their\r\nconstituents, were bent upon carrying it. Such a protest, however,\r\nmight form a rallying-point upon which future resistance might be\r\nbased, and the Country, now intoxicated by agitation, might come to\r\nits senses.\r\n\r\nAs to the strength of the Government, he believed it had very little\r\nat this moment in the House, and that such would be the case with any\r\nGovernment Lord Palmerston could form, he had foretold him, when Lord\r\nDerby had made him the offer to join an Administration of his forming.\r\nAt this moment the secession of the Peelites would rather strengthen\r\nthe Government than otherwise, as, from their connection with Lord\r\nAberdeen, they had been decried in the Country with him, and the Whigs\r\nlooked upon them with all the personal feelings of men deprived of\r\ntheir offices by them.\r\n\r\nHe agreed with me that in the present disruption of Parties, the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining any strong Government consists, not in the\r\npaucity of men, but in the over-supply of Right Honourable gentlemen\r\nproduced by the many attempts to form a Government on a more extended\r\nbase. There were now at least three Ministers for each office, from\r\nwhich the two excluded were always cried up as superior to the one\r\nin power. He said this could not be amended until we got back to two\r\nParties--each of them capable of presenting to the Queen an efficient\r\nAdministration. Now the one Party did not support its Chief from\r\npersonal rivalry--and the other, from the very feeling of its own\r\nincapacity, became reckless as to the course of its political actions.\r\n\r\nHe concluded by saying he felt it right to reserve his final\r\ndetermination till the last moment at which it would become necessary.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RESIGNATION OF THE PEELITES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _21st February 1855_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nfeels extreme regret in having to state to your Majesty that Sir James\r\nGraham, Mr Gladstone, and Mr Sidney Herbert announced at the Cabinet\r\nMeeting to-day their determination to retire from the Government in\r\nconsequence of their inability to consent to the nomination of Mr\r\nRoebuck's Committee.[38] _No other_ Member of the Government has\r\nas yet intimated any intention to retire.

The frost has left us,\r\nwhich personally I regret, as it agrees so well with me; but I believe\r\nit was very necessary on account of the great distress which was\r\nprevalent, so many people being thrown out of employment.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's meditated voyage[41]--though natural in him to wish--I\r\nthink most alarming; in fact, I don't know how things are to go on\r\nwithout him, independent of the great danger he exposes himself\r\nto besides. I own it makes one tremble, for _his life_ is of such\r\n_immense importance_. I still hope that he may be deterred from it,\r\nbut Walewski was in a great state about it.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday we saw twenty-six of the wounded Coldstream Guards, and\r\non Friday thirty-four of the Scotch Fusileers. A most interesting and\r\ntouching sight--_such_ fine men, and so brave and patient! _so ready_\r\nto go back and \"_be at them again_.\" A great many of them, I am glad\r\nto say, will be able to remain in the Service. Those who have lost\r\ntheir limbs cannot, of course. There were two poor boys of nineteen\r\nand twenty--the one had lost his leg, quite high up, by the bursting\r\nof a shell in the trenches, and the other his poor arm so shot that it\r\nis perfectly useless. Both had smooth girls' faces; these were in the\r\nColdstream, who certainly look the worst. In the Scotch Fusileers,\r\nthere were also two very young men--the one shot through the\r\ncheek, the other through the _skull_--but both recovered! Among the\r\nGrenadiers there is one very sad object, shot _dreadfully_, a ball\r\nhaving gone in through the cheek and behind the nose and eye and out\r\nthrough the other side! He is shockingly disfigured, but is recovered.\r\nI feel so much for them, and am _so fond_ of my dear soldiers--so\r\n_proud_ of them! We could not have avoided sending the Guards; it\r\nwould have been their ruin if they had not gone....\r\n\r\nI must now conclude.

It is probable that the Grand Duke\r\nHereditary will succeed quietly, notwithstanding the notion that a\r\ndoubt would be started whether he, as son of the Grand Duke Nicholas,\r\nwould not be superseded by his younger brother born son of the\r\nCzar.[44] It is possible that the new Emperor may revert to that\r\npeaceful policy which he was understood to advocate in the beginning\r\nof these transactions, but it is possible, on the other hand, that\r\nhe may feel bound to follow out the policy of his father, and may be\r\nimpelled by the headstrong ambition of his brother Constantine. At all\r\nevents, this change at Petersburg should not for the present slacken\r\nthe proceedings and the arrangements of the Allies.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons has been engaged in discussing Mr Roebuck's\r\nproposal that the Committee of Enquiry should be a secret one. This\r\nproposal was made by the majority of the Committee on the ground that\r\nthey anticipated a difficulty in conducting their enquiries without\r\ntrenching on the delicate and dangerous ground of questioning the\r\nproceedings of the French. The proposal was objected to by Lord\r\nSeymour[45] and Mr Ellice, members of the Committee, by Sir James\r\nGraham as unjust towards the Duke of Newcastle, and others whose\r\nconduct ought to be enquired into with all the safeguards which\r\npublicity secures for justice, and not before a Secret Tribunal in the\r\nnature of an Inquisition. The general sense of the House was against\r\nsecrecy, and Viscount Palmerston expressed an opinion adverse to it,\r\non the ground that it could not be enforced because the Committee\r\ncould not gag the witnesses, and that the character of secrecy\r\nwould excite suspicion and disappoint public expectation.

The\r\nproposition of having hulks prepared for their reception will do very\r\nwell at first, but it would not, the Queen thinks, do for any length\r\nof time. A hulk is a very gloomy place, and these poor men require\r\ntheir spirits to be cheered as much as their physical sufferings to be\r\nattended to. The Queen is particularly anxious on this subject, which\r\nis, he may truly say, constantly in her thoughts, as is everything\r\nconnected with her beloved troops, who have fought so bravely and\r\nborne so heroically all their sufferings and privations.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes before long to visit all the Hospitals at Portsmouth,\r\nand to see in what state they are.\r\n\r\n_When_ will the medals be ready for distribution?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheader: LORD DALHOUSIE RESIGNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marquis of Dalhousie to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nOOTACAMUND, _14th March 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General presents his most humble duty to your Majesty;\r\nand in obedience to the command, which your Majesty was pleased to lay\r\nupon him, that he should keep your Majesty acquainted with the course\r\nof public events in India, he has the honour to inform your Majesty\r\nthat he has now felt it to be his duty to request the President of\r\nthe Board of Control to solicit for him your Majesty's permission to\r\nretire from the office of Governor-General of India about the close of\r\nthe present year.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General begs permission respectfully to represent, that\r\nin January next, he will have held his present office for eight years;\r\nthat his health during the last few months has seriously failed him;\r\nand that although he believes that the invigorating air of these hills\r\nwill enable him to discharge all his duties efficiently during this\r\nseason, yet he is conscious that the effects of an Indian climate have\r\nlaid such a hold upon him that by the close of the present year he\r\nwill be wholly unfit any longer to serve your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie, therefore, humbly trusts that your Majesty will\r\ngraciously permit him to resign the great office which he holds before\r\nhe ceases to command the strength which is needed to sustain it.

They don't\r\nalter her opinion as to our demands. Every concession in form and\r\nwording ought to be made which could save Russian _amour-propre_; but\r\nthis ought in no way to trench upon the _substance_ of our demands, to\r\nwhich Austria must feel herself bound.[47]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: As has already been stated, the \"Four Points\"\r\n    were the basis of the negotiations at Vienna; the third\r\n    alone, which the Allies and Austria had defined as intended\r\n    to terminate Russian preponderance in the Black Sea, caused\r\n    difficulty.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE VIENNA CONFERENCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _19th March 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has read with the greatest interest Lord Cowley's three\r\nreports. The changeableness of the French views are most perplexing,\r\nalthough they have hitherto not prevented a steady course from being\r\nfollowed in the end. Lord Cowley seems to have been a little off his\r\nguard when he took the proposal of our taking Sinope as a second Malta\r\nor Gibraltar, for a mere act of generosity and confidence towards\r\nus. We must be careful not to break down ourselves the barrier of the\r\n\"abnegation clause\" of our original treaty.[48] The Austrian proposal\r\ncan hardly be serious, for to require 1,200,000 men before going to\r\nwar is almost ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe Queen read with much concern the two simultaneous proposals\r\nfrom the King of Prussia's simultaneous Plenipotentiaries--both\r\ninadmissible, in her opinion. A very civil answer would appear to the\r\nQueen as the best, to the effect that, as Prussia was evidently not\r\nnow in a mood to resume her position amongst the great Powers with the\r\nresponsibilities attaching to it, we could not hope to arrive at any\r\nsatisfactory result by the present negotiations, but shall be ready\r\nto treat Prussia with the same regard with which we have always done,\r\nwhen she shall have something tangible to propose.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: _I.e._ the formal renunciation by the Allies of\r\n    any scheme of territorial acquisition.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BALTIC EXPEDITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _19th March 1855_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Expedition to the Baltic[49] the Queen concurs in\r\nbelieving it probable that we shall have to confine ourselves to a\r\nblockade, but this should be with the _certainty_ of its being done\r\neffectually and free from any danger to the squadron, from a sudden\r\nstart of the Russian fleet. Twenty sail of the Line (to which add\r\nfive French) would be a sufficient force if supported by the necessary\r\ncomplement of frigates, corvettes, and gunboats, etc., etc.; alone,\r\nthey would be useless from their draught of water, and if twenty ships\r\nonly are meant (not sail of the Line), the force would seem wholly\r\ninadequate. The Queen would therefore wish, before giving her sanction\r\nto the proposed plan of campaign, to have a complete list submitted\r\nto her of what it is intended to constitute the Baltic Fleet.[50]\r\nWe ought likewise not to leave ourselves destitute of any Reserve at\r\nhome, which the uncertain contingencies of another year's war may call\r\nupon at any moment.\r\n\r\nThe Queen regrets Lord Shaftesbury's declining office, and approves of\r\nLord Elgin's selection in his place.[51]\r\n\r\nShe thanks Lord Palmerston for the clear and comprehensive explanation\r\nof Sir George Lewis's Stamp Duties Bill,[52] and approves of Lord\r\nPalmerston's proposal for the adjournment of Parliament for the Easter\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: The expedition was commanded by Rear-Admiral\r\n    Richard Dundas.

The Queen has since thought that\r\nthe value of this Medal would be greatly enhanced if _she_, were\r\n_personally_ to deliver it to the officers and a certain number of men\r\n(selected for that purpose). The valour displayed by our troops,\r\nas well as the sufferings they have endured, have never been\r\nsurpassed--perhaps hardly equalled; and as the Queen has been a\r\nwitness of _what_ they have gone through, having visited them in their\r\nhospitals, she would _like_ to be able _personally_ to give them\r\nthe reward they have earned so well, and will value so much.

Drouyn de Lhuys, even with his pretended modification, could not\r\nbe described more accurately than in the concise terms of H.R.H.\r\nthe Prince Albert, namely, that instead of making to cease the\r\npreponderance of Russia in the Black Sea, it would perpetuate and\r\nlegalise that preponderance, and that instead of establishing a secure\r\nand permanent Peace, it would only establish a prospective case for\r\nwar. Such a proposal therefore your Majesty's Advisers could not\r\nrecommend your Majesty to adopt; but as the step to be taken seems\r\nrather to be to make such a proposal to Austria than to answer such\r\na proposal which Austria has not formally made, and as M. Drouyn's\r\ntelegraphic despatch stated that he thought that Lord John Russell\r\nwould recommend such an arrangement to his colleagues, the Cabinet\r\nwere of opinion that the best course would be simply to take no\r\nstep at all until Lord John Russell's return, which may be expected\r\nto-morrow or next day, especially as Lord Clarendon had already, by\r\ntelegraphic message of yesterday, intimated to the French Government\r\nthat such an arrangement as that proposed by M. Drouyn, and which\r\nwould sanction a Russian Fleet in the Black Sea to any amount short by\r\none ship of the number existing in 1853, could not be agreed to by\r\nthe British Government. Such an arrangement would, in the opinion of\r\nViscount Palmerston, be alike dangerous and dishonourable; and as\r\nto the accompanying alliance with Austria for the future defence of\r\nTurkey and for making war with Russia, if she were to raise her Black\r\nSea Fleet up to the amount of 1853, what reason is there to believe\r\nthat Austria, who shrinks from war with Russia now that the Army\r\nof Russia has been much reduced by the losses of the last twelve\r\nmonths--now that her Forces are divided and occupied elsewhere than on\r\nthe Austrian frontier, and now that England and France are actually in\r\nthe field with great Armies, supported by great Fleets, what reason\r\nis there to believe that this same Austria would be more ready to\r\nmake war four or five years hence, when the Army of Russia shall have\r\nrepaired its losses and shall be more concentrated to attack\r\nAustria, when the Austrian Army shall have been reduced to its Peace\r\nEstablishment, and when the Peace Establishments of England and\r\nFrance, withdrawn within their home stations, shall be less ready to\r\nco-operate with Austria in war? What reason, moreover, is there for\r\nsupposing that Austria, who has recently declared that though prepared\r\nfor war she will not make war for ten sail of the Line more or less\r\nin the Russian Black Sea Fleet, will some few years hence, when\r\nunprepared for war, draw the sword on account of the addition of one\r\nship of war to the Russian Fleet in the Black Sea?\r\n\r\nSuch proposals are really a mockery.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: It had long become evident that Russia\r\n    would refuse assent to the Third Point, terminating her\r\n    preponderance in the Black Sea, but Austria now came forward\r\n    with a proposal to limit the Russian force there to the number\r\n    of ships authorised before the war. This was rejected by\r\n    Russia, whereupon the representatives of England and France\r\n    withdrew from the negotiations. Count Buol, representing\r\n    Austria, then came forward again with a scheme the salient\r\n    features of which were that, if Russia increased her Black Sea\r\n    fleet beyond its existing strength, Turkey might maintain a\r\n    force equal to it, and England and France might each have a\r\n    naval force in the Black Sea equal to half the Russian force,\r\n    while the increase of the Russian fleet beyond its strength\r\n    in 1853 would be regarded by Austria as a _casus belli_. These\r\n    terms were satisfactory neither to the British Government\r\n    nor to the French Emperor, so that it was learned with some\r\n    surprise that Lord John Russell and M. Drouyn de Lhuys (the\r\n    French Plenipotentiary) had approved of them. Upon the\r\n    Emperor definitely rejecting the proposals, M. Drouyn de\r\n    Lhuys resigned; he was succeeded as Foreign Minister by Count\r\n    Walewski, M. de Persigny becoming Ambassador in London.\r\n    Lord John Russell tendered his resignation, but, at Lord\r\n    Palmerston's solicitation, and most unfortunately for himself,\r\n    he withdrew it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _28th April 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns these very important letters.

The\r\n_attentat_[56] on the Emperor will have shocked you, as it did us; it\r\nshocked me _the more_ as we had _watched over_ him with such anxiety\r\nwhile he was with us.\r\n\r\nIt has produced an immense sensation in France, we hear, and many of\r\n_his_ political _enemies_, he says, cheered him loudly as he returned\r\nto the Tuileries. As you say, he is _very personal_, and _therefore_\r\nkindness _shown_ him _personally_ will make a _lasting_ effect on his\r\nmind, peculiarly susceptible to _kindness_. Another feature in his\r\ncharacter is that _il ne fait pas de phrases_--and _what_ is said\r\nis the result of deep reflection. I therefore send you (in _strict\r\nconfidence_) a copy of the really very kind letter he wrote me,\r\nand which I am sure is _quite sincere_. He felt the simple and kind\r\ntreatment of him and her _more_ than _all_ the outward homage and\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nPlease kindly to return it when you have done with it.\r\n\r\nI am sure you would be charmed with the Empress; it is not such great\r\nbeauty, but such grace, elegance, sweetness, and _nature_. Her manners\r\nare charming; the _profile_ and figure beautiful and particularly\r\n_distingués_.\r\n\r\nYou will be pleased (as I was) at the abandonment of the journey to\r\nthe Crimea, though I think, as regarded the Campaign, it would have\r\nbeen a good thing....\r\n\r\nLord John is returned.

A\r\nremarkable combination of circumstances has brought about the very\r\nintimate alliance which now unites England and France, for so many\r\ncenturies the bitterest enemies and rivals, and this, under the reign\r\nof the present Emperor, the nephew of our greatest foe, and bearing\r\nhis name, and brought about by the policy of the late Emperor of\r\nRussia, who considered himself as the head of the European Alliance\r\nagainst France!\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on the character of the present Emperor Napoleon, and\r\nthe impression I have conceived of it, the following thoughts present\r\nthemselves to my mind:\r\n\r\nThat he _is_ a very _extraordinary_ man, with great qualities\r\nthere can be _no_ doubt--I might almost say a mysterious man. He is\r\nevidently possessed of _indomitable courage_, _unflinching firmness\r\nof purpose_, _self-reliance_, _perseverance_, and _great secrecy_; to\r\nthis should be added, a great reliance on what he calls his _Star_,\r\nand a belief in omens and incidents as connected with his future\r\ndestiny, which is almost romantic--and at the same time he is endowed\r\nwith wonderful _self-control_, great _calmness_, even _gentleness_,\r\nand with a _power_ of _fascination_, the effect of which upon\r\nall those who become more intimately acquainted with him is _most\r\nsensibly_ felt.\r\n\r\nHow far he is actuated by a strong _moral_ sense of _right_ and\r\n_wrong_ is difficult to say. On the one hand, his attempts at\r\nStrasbourg and Boulogne, and this last after having given a solemn\r\npromise never to return or make a similar attempt--in which he openly\r\ncalled on the subjects of the then King of the French to follow him\r\nas the successor of Napoleon, the _Coup d'État_ of December 1851,\r\nfollowed by great ... severity and the confiscation of the property of\r\nthe unfortunate Orleans family, would lead one to believe that he is\r\nnot. On the other hand, his kindness and gratitude towards all those,\r\nwhether high or low, who have befriended him or stood by him through\r\nlife, and his straightforward and steady conduct towards us throughout\r\nthe very difficult and anxious contest in which we have been engaged\r\nfor a year and a half, show that he is possessed of noble and right\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nMy impression is, that in all these apparently inexcusable acts, he\r\nhas invariably been guided by the belief that he is _fulfilling a\r\ndestiny_ which God has _imposed_ upon him, and that, though cruel or\r\nharsh in themselves, they were _necessary_ to obtain the result which\r\nhe considered _himself_ as _chosen_ to carry out, and _not_ acts of\r\n_wanton_ cruelty or injustice; for it is impossible to know him and\r\nnot to see that there is much that is truly amiable, kind, and honest\r\nin his character. Another remarkable and important feature in his\r\ncomposition is, that everything he says or expresses is the _result_\r\nof deep reflection and of settled purpose, and not merely _des phrases\r\nde politesse_, consequently when we read words used in his speech\r\nmade in the City, we may feel sure that he _means_ what he says; and\r\ntherefore I would rely with confidence on his behaving honestly and\r\nfaithfully towards us. I am not able to say whether he is deeply\r\nversed in History--I should rather think not, as regards it\r\n_generally_, though he may be, and probably is, well informed in\r\nthe history of his own country, certainly fully so in that of the\r\n_Empire_, he having made it his special study to contemplate and\r\nreflect upon all the acts and designs of his great uncle. He is very\r\nwell read in German literature, to which he seems to be very partial.\r\nIt is said, and I am inclined to think with truth, that he reads but\r\nlittle, even as regards despatches from his own foreign Ministers, he\r\nhaving expressed his surprise at my reading them daily. He seems to\r\nbe singularly ignorant in matters not connected with the branch of\r\nhis _special_ studies, and to be ill informed upon them by those who\r\nsurround him.\r\n\r\nIf we compare him with poor King Louis Philippe, I should say that the\r\nlatter (Louis Philippe) was possessed of vast knowledge upon all and\r\nevery subject, of immense experience in public affairs, and of great\r\nactivity of mind; whereas the Emperor possesses greater judgment and\r\nmuch greater firmness of purpose, but no experience of public affairs,\r\nnor mental application; he is endowed, as was the late King, with much\r\nfertility of imagination.\r\n\r\nAnother great difference between King Louis Philippe and the\r\nEmperor is, that the poor King was _thoroughly French_ in character,\r\npossessing all the liveliness and talkativeness of that people,\r\nwhereas the Emperor is as _unlike_ a _Frenchman_ as possible, being\r\nmuch more _German_ than French in character.... How could it be\r\nexpected that the Emperor _should_ have any _experience_ in _public\r\naffairs_, considering that till six years ago he lived as a poor\r\nexile, for some years even in prison, and never having taken the\r\nslightest part in the _public_ affairs of _any_ country?\r\n\r\nIt is therefore the more astounding, indeed almost incomprehensible,\r\nthat he should show all those powers of Government, and all that\r\nwonderful tact in his conduct and manners which he evinces, and which\r\nmany a King's son, nurtured in palaces and educated in the midst of\r\naffairs, never succeeds in attaining. I likewise believe that he would\r\nbe incapable of such tricks and over-reachings as practised by poor\r\nKing Louis Philippe (for whose memory, as the old and kind friend of\r\nmy father, and of whose kindness and amiable qualities I shall ever\r\nretain a lively sense), who in great as well as in small things took\r\na pleasure in being cleverer and more cunning than others, often\r\nwhen there was no advantage to be gained by it, and which was,\r\nunfortunately, strikingly displayed in the transactions connected with\r\nthe Spanish marriages, which led to the King's downfall and ruined\r\nhim in the eyes of all Europe. On the other hand, I believe that the\r\nEmperor Napoleon would not hesitate to do a thing by main force,\r\neven if in itself unjust and tyrannical, should he consider that the\r\n_accomplishment of his destiny_ demanded it.\r\n\r\nThe _great advantage_ to be derived for the permanent alliance\r\nof England and France, which is of such vital importance to both\r\ncountries, by the Emperor's recent visit, I take to be this: that,\r\nwith his peculiar character and views, which are very personal, a\r\nkind, unaffected, and hearty reception by us _personally_ in our own\r\nfamily will make a lasting impression upon his mind; he will see\r\nthat he can rely upon our friendship and honesty towards him and his\r\ncountry so long as he remains faithful towards us; naturally frank,\r\nhe will see the advantage to be derived from continuing so; and if he\r\nreflects on the downfall of the former dynasty, he will see that it\r\narose _chiefly_ from a _breach_ of pledges,... and will be sure, if I\r\nbe not very much mistaken in his character, to _avoid_ such a course.\r\nIt must likewise not be overlooked that this kindly feeling towards\r\nus, and consequently towards England (the interests of which are\r\n_inseparable_ from us), must be increased when it is remembered that\r\n_we_ are almost the only people in _his_ own position with whom he has\r\nbeen able to be on any terms of intimacy, consequently almost the only\r\nones to whom he could talk easily and unreservedly, which he cannot\r\ndo naturally with his inferiors. He and the Empress are in a most\r\nisolated position, unable to trust the only relations who are near\r\nthem in France, and surrounded by courtiers and servants, who from\r\nfear or interest do not tell them the truth. It is, therefore, natural\r\nto believe that he will not willingly separate from those who, like\r\nus, do not scruple to put him in possession of the real facts, and\r\nwhose conduct is guided by justice and honesty, and this the more\r\nreadily as he is supposed to have always been a searcher after truth.\r\nI would go still further, and think that it is in our power to _keep_\r\nhim in the right course, and to protect him against the extreme\r\nflightiness, changeableness, and to a certain extent want of honesty\r\nof his own servants and nation. We should never lose the opportunity\r\nof checking in the bud any attempt on the part of his agents or\r\nministers to play us false, frankly informing him of the facts, and\r\nencouraging him to bring forward in an equally frank manner whatever\r\nhe has to complain of. This is the course which we have hitherto\r\npursued, and as he is France in his own sole person, it becomes of the\r\nutmost importance to encourage by every means in our power that very\r\nopen intercourse which I must say has existed between him and Lord\r\nCowley for the last year and a half, and now, since our personal\r\nacquaintance, between ourselves.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, the words which fall from his lips are the result of\r\ndeep reflection, and part of the deep plan which he has staked out\r\nfor himself, and which he intends to carry out. I would therefore lay\r\nstress on the following words which he pronounced to me immediately\r\nafter the investiture of the Order of the Garter: \"_C'est un lien de\r\nplus entre nous, j'ai prêté serment de fidélité à votre Majesté et\r\nje le garderai soigneusement. C'est un grand événement pour moi, et\r\nj'espère pouvoir prouver ma reconnaissance envers votre Majesté et son\r\nPays._\" In a letter said to be written by him to Mr F. Campbell, the\r\ntranslator of M. Thiers's _History of the Consulate and Empire_, when\r\nreturning the proof-sheets in 1847, he says \"Let us hope the day may\r\nyet come when I shall carry out the intentions of my Uncle by uniting\r\nthe policy and interests of England and France in an indissoluble\r\nalliance. That hope cheers and encourages me. It forbids my repining\r\nat the altered fortunes of my family.\"\r\n\r\nIf these be truly his words, he certainly has acted up to them, since\r\nhe has swayed with an iron hand the destinies of that most versatile\r\nnation, the French. That he should have written this at a moment when\r\nLouis Philippe had succeeded in all his wishes, and seemed securer\r\nthan ever in the possession of his Throne, shows a calm reliance in\r\nhis destiny and in the realisation of hopes entertained from his very\r\nchildhood which borders on the supernatural.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the many reflections caused by the observation and\r\nacquaintance with the character of this most extraordinary man, in\r\nwhose fate not only the interests of this country, but the whole of\r\nEurope are intimately bound up. I shall be curious to see if, after\r\nthe lapse of time, my opinion and estimate of it has been the right\r\none.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _10th May 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns these interesting letters to Lord Clarendon. When\r\nthe Emperor expresses a wish that positive instructions should be sent\r\nto Lord Raglan to join in a general forward movement about to take\r\nplace, he should be made aware that Lord Raglan has been ready and\r\nmost anxious for the assault taking place on the 26th, and that he\r\nonly consented to postpone it for a few days at General Canrobert's\r\nearnest desire, who wished to wait for the army of Reserve. It should\r\nbe kept in mind, however, that the English cannot proceed farther as\r\nlong as the Mamelon has not been taken, and that as long as the\r\nFrench refuse to do this they must not complain of Lord Raglan's not\r\nadvancing. The refusal to undertake this has, the Queen is sorry to\r\nsay, produced a bad feeling amongst many of our officers and men,\r\nwhich she owns alarms her.[57]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57: General Canrobert was deficient in dash and\r\n    initiative; he knew his defects, and was relieved of his\r\n    command at his own request, being succeeded by General\r\n    Pélissier.\r\n\r\n    On the 24th of May (the Queen's Birthday) a successful\r\n    expedition was made against Kertsch, the granary of\r\n    Sebastopol, and vast quantities of coal, corn, and flour were\r\n    either seized by the Allies, or destroyed in anticipation of\r\n    their seizure by the Russians.\r\n\r\n    On the 7th of June, the Mamelon (a knoll crowned by a redoubt\r\n    and protected by the Rifle Pits) was taken by the French,\r\n    and the Gravel Pits, an outwork in front of the Redan, by the\r\n    English.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CRIMEAN MEDAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _22nd May 1855_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST, KINDEST UNCLE,--... The state of affairs is uncomfortable\r\nand complicated just now, but our course is _straight_; we _cannot_\r\ncome to any peace unless we have such guarantees by _decided_\r\nlimitation of the Fleet, which would secure us against Russian\r\npreponderance for the future.[58]\r\n\r\nErnest will have told you what a _beautiful_ and _touching_ sight\r\nand ceremony (the first of the kind ever witnessed in England) the\r\ndistribution of the Medals was. From the highest Prince of the Blood\r\nto the lowest Private, all received the same distinction for the\r\nbravest conduct in the severest actions, and the rough hand of the\r\nbrave and honest private soldier came for the first time in contact\r\nwith that of their Sovereign and their Queen! Noble fellows! I own I\r\nfeel as if they were _my own children_; my heart beats for _them_ as\r\nfor my _nearest and dearest_. They were so touched, so pleased; many,\r\nI hear, cried--and they won't hear of giving up their Medals, to have\r\ntheir names engraved upon them, for fear they should _not_ receive the\r\n_identical one_ put into _their hands by me_, which is quite touching.\r\nSeveral came by in a sadly mutilated state. None created more interest\r\nor is more gallant than young Sir Thomas Troubridge, who had, at\r\nInkerman, _one leg_ and the _other foot_ carried away by a round shot,\r\nand continued commanding his battery till the battle was won, refusing\r\nto be carried away, only desiring his shattered limbs to be raised in\r\norder to prevent too great a hemorrhage! He was dragged by in a bath\r\nchair, and when I gave him his medal I told him I should make him one\r\nof my Aides-de-camp for his very gallant conduct, to which he replied:\r\n\"I am amply repaid for everything!\"[59]\r\n\r\n_One must_ revere and love such soldiers as those! The account in the\r\n_Times_ of Saturday is very correct and good.\r\n\r\nI must, however, conclude now, hoping soon to hear from you again.\r\nCould you kindly tell me if you could in a few days forward some\r\nletters and papers with _safety_ to good Stockmar. Ever your devoted\r\nNiece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: Prince Albert, in a Memorandum dated the 25th of\r\n    May, emphasised the difficulties in the way of peace caused\r\n    by the attitude of Austria, and the possibility of her passing\r\n    from the one alliance to the other.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: He was made a C.B. and a Brevet-Colonel; and\r\n    also received the Legion of Honour.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SUCCESSOR TO LORD DALHOUSIE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Mr Vernon Smith._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _19th June 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Mr Vernon Smith's letter on the subject of Lord\r\nDalhousie's resignation and the appointment of a successor. She\r\nwas somewhat astonished that the name of a successor to that most\r\nimportant appointment should for the first time be brought before her\r\nafter all official steps for carrying it out had been completed.\r\nIf the selection should now not receive the Queen's approval, it is\r\nevident that great awkwardness must arise.[60]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60: Mr Vernon Smith, in reply, referred to the\r\n    statutory power then existing of the Directors of the East\r\n    India Company to nominate a Governor-General, subject to the\r\n    approbation of the Crown.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Mr Vernon Smith._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _20th June 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen received Mr V. Smith's letter yesterday evening after her\r\nreturn from Chatham. She readily acquits him of any _intentional_\r\nwant of respect towards her, or of any neglect in going through the\r\nprescribed forms with regard to the appointment in question, neither\r\nof which she meant to insinuate by her letter. But she does not\r\nlook upon the question as one of form. She takes a deep and natural\r\ninterest in the welfare of her Indian Empire, and must consider the\r\nselection of the fittest person for the post of Governor-General as\r\nof paramount importance. She had frequently discussed this point with\r\nLord Palmerston, but the name of Lord Canning never occurred amongst\r\nthe candidates alluded to. The Queen is even now quite ignorant as to\r\nthe reasons and motives which led to his selection in preference to\r\nthose other names, and Mr V. Smith will see at once that, were the\r\nQueen inclined to object to it, she could not _now_ do so without\r\ninflicting a deep, personal injury on a public man, for whose personal\r\nqualities and talents the Queen has a high regard.\r\n\r\nShe accordingly approves the recommendation, but must repeat her\r\nregret that no opportunity had been given to her to discuss the\r\npropriety of it with her Ministers previous to the intention of the\r\nrecommendation becoming known to all concerned in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF LORD RAGLAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Simpson to Lord Panmure._[61]\r\n[_Telegram._]\r\n\r\n_29th June 1855._\r\n(8.30 A.M.)\r\n\r\nLord Raglan had been going on favourably until four in the afternoon\r\nyesterday, when very serious symptoms made their appearance.\r\nDifficulty of breathing was experienced, which gradually increased.\r\nUp to five o'clock he was conscious, and from this time his strength\r\ndeclined almost imperceptibly until twenty-five minutes before nine,\r\nwhen he died. I have assumed the command, as Sir George Brown is too\r\nill on board ship.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: On the 18th of June, the fortieth anniversary of\r\n    Waterloo, a combined attack by the English on the Redan, and\r\n    the French on the Malakhoff, was repulsed with heavy losses.\r\n    The scheme was that of Pélissier, and Lord Raglan acquiesced\r\n    against his better judgment.

We both feel _most\r\ndeeply_ for you and your daughters, to whom this blow must be most\r\nsevere and sudden. He was so strong, and his health had borne the bad\r\nclimate, great fatigues, and anxieties so well, ever since he left\r\nEngland, that, though we were much alarmed at hearing of his illness,\r\nwe were full of hopes of his speedy recovery.\r\n\r\nWe must bow to the will of God; but to be taken away thus, on the eve\r\nof the successful result of so much labour, so much suffering, and so\r\nmuch anxiety, is cruel indeed!\r\n\r\nWe feel much, too, for the brave Army, whom he was so proud of, who\r\nwill be sadly cast down at losing their gallant Commander, who had led\r\nthem so often to victory and glory.\r\n\r\nIf sympathy can be any consolation, you have it, for _we all_ have\r\n_alike_ to mourn, and no one more than I, who have lost a faithful and\r\ndevoted Servant, in whom I had the greatest confidence.\r\n\r\nWe both most anxiously hope that your health, and that of your\r\ndaughters, may not materially suffer from this dreadful shock. Believe\r\nme always, my dear Lady Raglan, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GENERAL SIMPSON TAKES COMMAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to General Simpson._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _7th July 1855_.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen last wrote to General Simpson to express to him, and\r\nthrough him to her Army in the Crimea, her _deep_ grief at the loss\r\nof their noble, gallant, and excellent Commander, it was not yet known\r\nthat Sir George Brown would return home, and that the command of the\r\nArmy would devolve upon General Simpson. She writes to him, therefore,\r\nto-day, for the _first_ time as the Commander-in-Chief of her heroic\r\nArmy in the East, to assure him of her confidence and support. It is\r\nas proud a command as any soldier could desire, but its difficulties\r\nand responsibilities are also very great.\r\n\r\nGeneral Simpson knows well how admirably his lamented predecessor\r\nconducted all the communications with our Allies the French, and he\r\ncannot do better than follow in the same course. While showing the\r\ngreatest readiness to act with perfect cordiality towards them, he\r\nwill, the Queen trusts, never allow her Army to be unduly pressed\r\nupon, which would only injure both Armies.\r\n\r\nThe Queen feels very anxious lest the fearful heat which the Army\r\nis exposed to should increase cholera and fever. Both the Prince and\r\nherself, the Queen can only repeat, have their minds _constantly_\r\noccupied with the Army, and count the days and hours between the\r\nmails, and it would be a relief to the Queen to hear herself directly\r\nfrom General Simpson from time to time when he has leisure to write.\r\n\r\nThe Prince wishes to be most kindly named to General Simpson, and\r\njoins with the Queen in every possible good wish for himself and her\r\nbrave and beloved troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S UNPOPULARITY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _12th July 1855_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty....\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston very much regrets to have to say that the adverse\r\nfeeling in regard to Lord John Russell grows stronger and spreads\r\nwider every day, and there is a general desire that he should\r\nresign.[62] This desire is expressed by the great bulk of the\r\nsteadiest supporters of the Government, and was conveyed to Lord John\r\nthis evening in the House of Commons by Mr Bouverie on behalf of those\r\nmembers of the Government who are not in the Cabinet. Lord John has\r\nhimself come to the same conclusion, and informed Viscount Palmerston\r\nthis evening in the House of Commons that he has finally determined to\r\nresign, and will to-morrow or next day write a letter to that effect\r\nto be laid before your Majesty. Viscount Palmerston told him that\r\nhowever great would be the loss of the Government by his resignation,\r\nyet as this is a question which more peculiarly regards Lord John\r\npersonally, his course must be decided by his own judgment and\r\nfeelings; but that if he did not think necessary to resign, Viscount\r\nPalmerston would face Sir Edward Bulwer's Motion with the Government\r\nas it is.[63] He asked Lord John, however, whether, if he determined\r\nto resign, there was any arrangement which he would wish to have\r\nsubmitted for your Majesty's consideration, and especially whether, if\r\nyour Majesty should be graciously pleased to raise him to the Peerage,\r\nsuch an Honour would be agreeable to him. He said that perhaps in the\r\nautumn such an act of favour on the part of your Majesty might fall in\r\nwith his views and would be gratefully received, but it would not do\r\nat present, and should not be mentioned....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: Lord John Russell had, as stated above, favoured\r\n    the proposals of Count Buol at Vienna, compromising the Third\r\n    Point to the advantage of Russia.

On the 24th\r\n    of May, Mr Disraeli moved a vote of censure on the Government\r\n    for its conduct of the war, fiercely assailing Lord John for\r\n    his proceedings both at Vienna and as Minister. In repelling\r\n    the charge, Lord John made a vigorous speech disclosing no\r\n    disposition to modify the British attitude towards Russian\r\n    preponderance in the Black Sea, and Mr Disraeli's Motion was\r\n    lost by a majority of 100. On a subsequent night he made a\r\n    further speech strongly antagonistic to Russia, his attitude\r\n    as to the Austrian proposals being still undisclosed to the\r\n    public. But these speeches caused Count Buol to reveal the\r\n    favourable view taken of his proposals by the English\r\n    and French Plenipotentiaries, and Lord John Russell's\r\n    inconsistency aroused widespread indignation.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63: This Motion was one of censure on Lord John\r\n    Russell for his conduct at Vienna, and it was deeply galling\r\n    to be informed by subordinate members of the Government that,\r\n    unless he resigned, they would support the vote of censure.\r\n    Lord John bowed before the storm and retired from office.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL RESIGNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _13th July 1855_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nsubmits for your Majesty's gracious acceptance the resignation of Lord\r\nJohn Russell's office, which Viscount Palmerston trusts your Majesty\r\nwill think is expressed in terms highly honourable to Lord John\r\nRussell's feelings as a man and as a Minister.\r\n\r\nThe step, Viscount Palmerston regrets to say, has become unavoidable.\r\nThe storm of public opinion, however much it may exceed any just or\r\nreasonable cause, is too overbearing to be resisted, and Lord John\r\nRussell has no doubt best consulted his own personal interests in\r\nyielding to it. After a time there will be a reaction and justice will\r\nbe done; but resistance at present would be ineffectual, and would\r\nonly increase irritation.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston is not as yet prepared to submit for your\r\nMajesty's consideration the arrangement which will become necessary\r\nfor filling up the gap thus made in the Government....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _13th July 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is much concerned by what Lord Palmerston writes respecting\r\nthe feeling of the House of Commons. Lord John's resignation, although\r\na severe loss, may possibly assuage the storm which he had chiefly\r\nproduced. But she finds that Sir E. Lytton's Motion will be equally\r\napplicable to the Government after this event as it would have been\r\nbefore it. She trusts that no stone will be left unturned to defeat\r\nthe success of that Motion, which would plunge the Queen and the\r\nexecutive Government of the Country into new and most dangerous\r\ncomplications.

The resignation had become unavoidable, and Lord\r\nPalmerston will do well to let the Debate go by before proposing a\r\nsuccessor, whom it will be difficult to find under any circumstances.\r\nHaving expressed her feelings on the position of affairs in her letter\r\nof yesterday, she will not repeat them here.\r\n\r\nShe grants her permission to Lord Palmerston to state in Parliament\r\nwhat he may think necessary for the defence of the Cabinet. She could\r\nhave the Council here on Wednesday, which day will probably be the\r\nleast inconvenient to the Members of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord Palmerston's letter of last night,\r\nwhich gives a more cheering prospect.[65]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 64: Stating that his continuance in office would\r\n    embarrass and endanger the Ministry.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 65: In consequence of Lord John's resignation, the\r\n    motion of censure was withdrawn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _24th July 1855_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I feel _quite_ grieved that it must again be _by\r\nletter_ that I express to you all my feelings of love and affection,\r\nwhich yesterday morning I could still do _de vive voix_. It was indeed\r\na _happy_ time; I only fear that I was a dull companion--silent,\r\nabsent, stupid, which I feel I have become since the War; and the\r\nconstant anxiety and preoccupation which that odious Sebastopol causes\r\nme and my dear, brave Army, added to which the last week, or\r\nindeed the _whole fortnight_ since we arrived here, was one of such\r\nuncertainty about this tiresome scarlatina, that it made me still more\r\n_préoccupée_.\r\n\r\nThe _only_ thing that at all lessened my sorrow at seeing you depart\r\nwas my thankfulness that you got safe _out_ of our _Hospital_....

Now, having read the whole of these\r\ndocuments, she confesses that she requires some explanation as to the\r\nadvantages which are to arise to England from the proposed Treaty,\r\nbefore she can come to any decision about it. When a Treaty with\r\nSweden was last in contemplation, she was to have joined in the war\r\nagainst Russia and to have received a guarantee of the integrity of\r\nher dominions by England and France in return; yet this clause was\r\nfound so onerous to this Country, and opening so entirely a new field\r\nof questions and considerations, that the Cabinet would not\r\nentertain it. Now the same guarantee is to be given by us without the\r\ncounterbalancing advantage of Sweden giving us her assistance in the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 66: Mr (afterwards Sir) Arthur Charles Magenis,\r\n    Minister at Stockholm (and afterwards at Lisbon), had written\r\n    to say that an attempt was being made to change the partial\r\n    guarantee of Finmark into a general guarantee on behalf of\r\n    Sweden and Norway. An important Treaty was concluded between\r\n    Sweden and Norway, and the Western Powers, in the following\r\n    November, which secured the integrity of Sweden and Norway.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GENERAL SIMPSON'S DIFFICULTIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _30th July 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Panmure's letter of yesterday evening,\r\nand has signed the dormant Commission for Sir W. Codrington. A similar\r\ncourse was pursued with regard to Sir George Cathcart. The Queen hopes\r\nthat General Simpson may still rally. He must be in a great state of\r\nhelplessness at this moment, knowing that he wants, as everybody out\r\nthere, the advantages which Lord Raglan's name, experience, position,\r\nrank, prestige, etc., etc., gave him, having his Military Secretary\r\nill on board, the head of the Intelligence Department dead, and no\r\nmeans left him whereby to gather information or to keep up secret\r\ncorrespondence with the Tartars--Colonel Vico[67] dead, who, as Prince\r\nEdward told the Queen, had become a _most important_ element in the\r\ngood understanding with the French Army and its new Commander, and\r\nnot possessing military rank enough to make the Sardinian General[68]\r\nconsider him as his Chief. If all these difficulties are added to\r\nthose inherent to the task imposed upon him, one cannot be surprised\r\nat his low tone of hopefulness. As most of these will, however, meet\r\nevery Commander whom we now can appoint, the Queen trusts that means\r\nwill be devised to assist him as much as possible in relieving him\r\nfrom too much writing, and in the diplomatic correspondence he has to\r\ncarry on. The Queen repeats her opinion that a _Chef de Chancellerie\r\nDiplomatique_, such as is customary in the Russian Army, ought to be\r\nplaced at his command, and she wishes Lord Panmure to show this letter\r\nto Lords Palmerston and Clarendon, and to consult with them on the\r\nsubject. Neither the Chief of the Staff nor the Military Secretary\r\ncan supply that want, and the General himself must feel unequal to it\r\nwithout any experience on the subject, and so will his successor.\r\n\r\nPrince Edward told the Queen _in strict confidence_ that General\r\nSimpson's position in Lord Raglan's Headquarters had been anything\r\nbut pleasant, that the Staff had been barely civil to him; he was\r\ngenerally treated as an interloper, so that the Sardinian and French\r\nOfficers attached to our Headquarters observed upon it as a strange\r\nthing which would not be tolerated in their Armies, and that General\r\nSimpson showed himself grateful to them for the civility which they\r\nshowed to a General Officer of rank _aux cheveux blancs_. These little\r\ndetails, considered together with the General's extreme modesty,\r\nenable one to conceive what his present feelings must be.[69]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 67: Colonel Vico, the French Commissioner attached\r\n    to Lord Raglan's staff, had died on the 10th.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 68: General La Marmora.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 69: The Russian resources for the defence of\r\n    Sebastopol, both as to ammunition and provisions, were\r\n    becoming exhausted, and a supreme effort was to be made,\r\n    by massing more Russian troops in the Crimea, to inflict a\r\n    decisive blow on the besieging forces of the Allies. Early on\r\n    the morning of the 16th of August Prince Gortschakoff attacked\r\n    the French and Piedmontese at the River Tchernaya. The attack\r\n    on the left was repulsed by the French with the utmost spirit\r\n    and with very little loss; while the Russian loss, both in\r\n    killed and wounded, was severe. The Sardinian army, under\r\n    General La Marmora, were no less successful on the right. The\r\n    news of this victory did not reach England until the Queen and\r\n    Prince had left for their visit to Paris.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\n[OSBORNE, _7th August 1855_.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen has read Sir B.

I will therefore only give in a few words\r\nmy impressions.\r\n\r\nI am _delighted_, _enchanted_, _amused_, and _interested_, and think\r\nI never saw anything more _beautiful_ and gay than Paris--or more\r\nsplendid than all the Palaces. Our reception is _most_ gratifying--for\r\nit is enthusiastic and really kind in the highest degree; and Maréchal\r\nMagnan[74] (whom you know well) says that such a reception as I have\r\nreceived _every day here_ is much greater and much more enthusiastic\r\neven than Napoleon on his return from his victories had received! Our\r\nentrance into Paris was a scene which was _quite feenhaft_, and\r\nwhich could hardly be seen anywhere else; was quite _overpowering_--\r\nsplendidly decorated--illuminated--immensely\r\ncrowded--and 60,000 troops out--from the Gare de Strasbourg to St\r\nCloud, of which 20,000 Gardes Nationales, who had come great distances\r\nto see me.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor has done wonders for Paris, and for the Bois de Boulogne.\r\nEverything is beautifully _monté_ at Court--_very_ quiet, and\r\nin excellent order; I must say we are both much struck with the\r\ndifference between this and the poor King's time, when the noise,\r\nconfusion, and bustle were great. We have been to the Exposition,\r\nto Versailles--which is most splendid and magnificent--to the Grand\r\nOpéra, where the reception and the way in which \"God save the Queen\"\r\nwas sung were _most magnificent_. Yesterday we went to the Tuileries;\r\nin the evening _Théâtre ici_; to-night an immense ball at the Hôtel de\r\nVille. They have asked to call a new street, which we opened, _after\r\nme!_\r\n\r\nThe heat is very great, but the weather splendid, and though the sun\r\nmay be hotter, the air is certainly _lighter_ than ours--and I have no\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\nThe _Zouaves_ are on guard here, and you can't see finer men; the Cent\r\nGardes are splendid too.\r\n\r\nWe drove to look at poor Neuilly on Sunday, the Emperor and Empress\r\nproposing it themselves; and it was a most _melancholy sight_, all in\r\nruins. At _le grand Trianon_ we saw the pretty chapel in which poor\r\nMarie was married; at the Tuileries the Cabinet where the poor King\r\nsigned his fatal abdication. I wish _you_ would take an opportunity of\r\ntelling the poor Queen that we had thought much of her and the family\r\nhere, had visited those spots which were connected with them in\r\nparticular, and that we had greatly admired the King's great works at\r\nVersailles, which have been left _quite intact_. Indeed, the Emperor\r\n(as in everything) has shown _great_ tact and good feeling about all\r\nthis, and spoke without any bitterness of the King.\r\n\r\nI still mean to visit (and this was _his_ proposition) the Chapelle de\r\nSt Ferdinand, which I hope you will likewise mention to the Queen....\r\n\r\nThe children are so fond of the Emperor, who is so very kind to them.\r\nHe _is_ very _fascinating_, with that great quiet and gentleness. He\r\nhas certainly excellent manners, and both he and the dear and _very_\r\ncharming Empress (whom Albert likes particularly) do the _honneurs\r\nextremely_ well and _very_ gracefully, and are full of _every kind_\r\nattention....\r\n\r\nInstead of my short letter I have written you a very long one, and\r\nmust end.

The Army were most friendly and\r\namicable towards us also.\r\n\r\nIn short, the _complete_ Union of the two countries is stamped and\r\nsealed in the most satisfactory and solid manner, for it is not _only_\r\na Union of the two Governments--the two Sovereigns--it is that of\r\nthe _two Nations!_ Albert has told you of all the very extraordinary\r\ncombinations of circumstances which helped to make all so interesting,\r\nso satisfactory. Of the splendour of the _Fête_ at Versailles I can\r\nreally give _no_ faint impression, for it exceeded all imagination! I\r\nhave formed a _great_ affection for the Emperor, and I believe it is\r\nvery reciprocal, for he showed us a confidence which we must feel\r\nas very gratifying, and spoke to us on all subjects, even the _most\r\ndelicate_. I find _no_ great personal rancour towards the Orleans. He\r\nhas destroyed nothing that the King did, even to the Gymnastics of the\r\nchildren at St Cloud, and showed much kind and good feeling in taking\r\nus to see poor Chartres' monument, which is beautiful. Nothing could\r\nexceed his tact and kindness. I find I must end in a great hurry, and\r\nwill say more another day. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Baron Stockmar._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _1st September 1855_.\r\n\r\nYou continue to refuse to answer me, but I am _not_ discouraged by it;\r\nbut on the contrary _must_ write to you to give _vent_ to my _delight_\r\nat our triumphant, most interesting, and most enjoyable visit to\r\nParis! The Prince has written to you, and given you some general\r\naccounts, which will please you, and the _Times_ has some descriptions\r\n... of the wonderful beauty and magnificence of _every_thing. I never\r\nenjoyed myself more, or was more delighted or more interested, _and\r\nI can think_ and talk of nothing else. I am _deeply_ touched by the\r\nextraordinary warmth, heartiness, and enthusiasm with which we have\r\nbeen received by _all_ ranks, and the kindness shown to every one\r\nhas brought us all back--beginning with ourselves and ending with\r\nthe lowest of our servants--full of gratitude, pleasure, admiration,\r\nregret at its being over, and a great desire to see such a visit\r\nrenewed! It was touching and pleasing in the extreme to see the\r\nalliance sealed so completely, and without lowering _either_ Country's\r\npride, and to see old enmities and rivalries _wiped out_ over the tomb\r\nof Napoleon I., before whose coffin I stood (by torchlight) at the arm\r\nof Napoleon III., now my nearest and dearest ally! We have come back\r\nwith feelings of _real_ affection for and interest in _France_--and\r\nindeed how could it be otherwise when one saw _how_ much was done to\r\n_please_ and delight us? The Army too (such a fine one!) I feel a real\r\naffection for, as the companions of my beloved troops!\r\n\r\nFor the Emperor _personally_ I have conceived a _real_ affection and\r\nfriendship, and so I may truly say of the Prince. You know what _I\r\nfelt_ the moment I saw him and became acquainted with him, what I\r\nwrote down about him, etc. Well, we have now seen him for full _ten\r\ndays_, from twelve to fourteen hours every day--often alone; and I\r\ncannot say _how_ pleasant and easy it is to live with him, or how\r\nattached one becomes to him. I know _no_ one who puts me more at my\r\nease, or to whom I felt more inclined to talk unreservedly, or in whom\r\ninvoluntarily I should be more inclined to confide, than the Emperor!\r\nHe was entirely at his ease with us--spoke most openly and frankly\r\nwith us on all subjects--EVEN the _most_ delicate, viz. the Orleans\r\nFamily (this was with _me_, for I was driving alone with him), and I\r\nam happy to _feel_ that there is nothing now between us which could\r\n_mar_ our personal good _entente_ and friendly and intimate footing.\r\nHe is so simple, so _naïf_, never making _des phrases_, or paying\r\ncompliments--so full of tact, good taste, high breeding; his\r\nattentions and respect towards us were so simple and unaffected, his\r\nkindness and friendship for the Prince so natural and so gratifying,\r\n_because_ it is _not_ forced, not _pour faire des compliments_. He\r\nis quite _The Emperor_, and yet in _no_ way playing it; the Court and\r\nwhole house infinitely more _regal_ and better managed than in poor\r\nLouis Philippe's time, when all was in great noise and confusion, and\r\nthere was _no_ Court. We parted with _mutual_ sorrow, and the Emperor\r\nexpressed his hope that we shall frequently meet and \"pas avec de si\r\ngrandes cérémonies\"!\r\n\r\nWhat I write here is my feeling and conviction: wonderful it is that\r\nthis _man_--whom certainly we were _not_ over well-disposed to--should\r\nby _force_ of _circumstances_ be drawn into such close connection with\r\nus, and become _personally_ our friend, and _this_ entirely by his\r\n_own personal_ qualities, in spite of so much that _was and could_ be\r\nsaid against him! To the children (who behaved beautifully, and had\r\nthe most extraordinary success) his kindness, and judicious kindness,\r\nwas _great_, and they are _excessively_ fond of him. In short, without\r\n_attempting_ to do anything particular to _make_ one like him, or\r\nANY personal attraction in outward appearance, he _has_ the power\r\nof _attaching_ those to him who come near him and know him, which is\r\n_quite incredible_. He is excessively kind in private, and so very\r\nquiet. I shall always look back on the time passed not only in France,\r\nbut with _him_ personally, as _most_ agreeable. The Prince, though\r\nless enthusiastic than I am, I can see well, shares this feeling, and\r\nI think it is very reciprocal on the Emperor's part; he is very fond\r\nof the Prince and truly appreciates him. With respect to the War,\r\nnothing can be more frank and fair and honest than he is about it, but\r\nit makes him unhappy and anxious.\r\n\r\nThe dear Empress, who was all kindness and goodness, whom we are all\r\nvery fond of, we saw comparatively but little of, as for _really_ and\r\n_certainly very_ good reasons she must take great care of herself....\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MISGOVERNMENT AT NAPLES]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CO-OPERATION OF THE POWERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _3rd September 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has read the enclosed papers, and must express her strongest\r\nobjection to a Naval Demonstration (which to be effectual must be\r\nprepared to pass on to measures of hostility), in order to obtain\r\nchanges in the _internal system of Government_ of the Kingdom of\r\nNaples.[75] England would thereby undertake a responsibility which\r\nshe is in no way capable of bearing, unless she took the Government\r\npermanently into her own hands. The plea on which the interference is\r\nto be based, viz. that the misgovernment at Naples brings Monarchical\r\ninstitutions into disrepute, and might place weapons in the hands of\r\nthe democracy (as put forth by Sir W. Temple),[76] would be wholly\r\n_insufficient_ to justify the proceeding. Whether such an armed\r\ninterference in favour of the people of Naples against their\r\nGovernment would lead to a Revolution or not, as apprehended by the\r\nFrench Government and disbelieved by Lord Palmerston, must be so\r\nentirely a matter of chance that it would be idle to predict the\r\nexact consequences. If 99 out of every 100 Neapolitans, however, are\r\ndissatisfied with their Government (as Lord Palmerston states), it\r\nis not unreasonable to expect that our demonstration may give them\r\nconfidence enough to rise, and if beat down by the King's troops\r\nin presence of our ships, our position would become exceedingly\r\nhumiliating.\r\n\r\nAny insult offered to the British Government, on the other hand, it\r\nhas a perfect right to resent, and to ask reparation for. The case,\r\nhowever, is a very unpleasant one. The Neapolitan Government deny\r\nhaving intended any slight on the British Legation by the order\r\nrespecting the Box of the \"Intendant du Théâtre,\" which they state to\r\nhave been general, and deny any intention to interfere with the free\r\nintercourse of the members of our Legation with Neapolitans, to which\r\nSir W.

The Queen and the\r\nPrince are much pleased with the draft of your Despatch to Naples;\r\nthey think it good and dignified. With respect to the draft to Lord\r\nStratford, instructing him to recommend to the Porte an application\r\nto the Austrian Government for the withdrawal or diminution of the\r\nAustrian troops in the Principalities, I have been commanded to write\r\nwhat the Queen has not time this morning to put on paper. Her Majesty\r\ndoes not feel that the objects of this proposed Despatch have been\r\nsufficiently explained. It does not appear to Her Majesty that, in\r\na military point of view, the plans of the Allies are sufficiently\r\nmatured to make it clear whether the withdrawal of the Austrian Army\r\nwould be an advantage or a disadvantage. If the Allies intend to\r\nmarch through the Principalities, and attack Russia on that side, the\r\npresence of the Austrians might be an inconvenience. If, on the other\r\nhand, they advance from the East, it is a positive advantage to have\r\nthe Russians contained on the other flank, by the Austrians in their\r\npresent position. Looking at the political bearing of this move, Her\r\nMajesty thinks that it will not fail to have an unfavourable effect on\r\nAustria, who will be hurt at the Allies urging the Porte to endeavour\r\nto put an end to an arrangement entered into at the suggestion, or at\r\nall events with the approval, of the Allies. It cannot be an object\r\nat this moment, when extraneous circumstances have probably acted\r\nfavourably for us on the minds of the Emperor of Austria and his\r\nGovernment, to check that disposition, make them distrust us, and\r\nincline them to throw themselves towards Russia, who now will spare no\r\nefforts to gain them. Her Majesty sees by your proposed Despatch you\r\ndo not expect the Austrians to comply with this demand. Even if they\r\nconsented to diminish the numbers of their Troops, they would do so\r\nonly to suit their own convenience, and such diminution would in no\r\nways decrease the evils of the occupation. Lastly, the Queen is of\r\nopinion that if such a proposal is to be made, it ought not to be done\r\nthrough Lord Stratford and the Porte, but that the subject should\r\nbe broached at Vienna and the Austrian Government asked what their\r\nintentions are; that this would be the more friendly, more open, and\r\nmore dignified course, and more likely than the other plan of being\r\nsuccessful. Her Majesty, however, doubts that any such demand will be\r\nacceded to by the Austrians, and believes that their refusal will put\r\nthe Allies in an awkward position.\r\n\r\nThis is, I believe, the pith of Her Majesty's opinions--there appears\r\nto me to be much sense in them--and they are well deserving of your\r\nand Palmerston's consideration. Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nGRANVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LIFE PEERAGES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _19th September 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to thank Lord Palmerston for his letter of the 16th. The\r\nwant of Law Lords in the Upper House has often been complained of, and\r\nthe Queen has long been of opinion that in order to remedy the same\r\nwithout adding permanently to the Peerage, the Crown ought to use its\r\nprerogative in creating Peers for life only. Lord Lansdowne coincided\r\nwith this view, and Lord John Russell actually proposed a \"Life\r\nPeerage\" to Dr. Lushington, who declined it, however, from a dislike\r\nto become the first of the kind. Mr Pemberton Leigh has _twice_\r\ndeclined a Peerage, but the Queen can have no objection to its being\r\noffered to him again.[81]...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 81: See _ante_, vol. ii., 25th January, 1851, note 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _20th September 1855_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty....\r\n\r\nA Blue Ribbon has become vacant by the death of the late Duke of\r\nSomerset, and Viscount Palmerston having communicated with Lord\r\nLansdowne and Lord Clarendon on the subject, would beg to submit for\r\nyour Majesty's gracious consideration that this honour might be well\r\nconferred upon the Duke of Newcastle, who has been the object of much\r\nundeserved attack, though certainly from inexperience not altogether\r\nexempt from criticism, and who since his retirement from office\r\nhas shaped his public course in a manner honourable to himself, and\r\nadvantageously contrasting with the aberrations of some of his former\r\ncolleagues.[82]\r\n\r\nYour Majesty must no doubt have been struck with the vast accumulation\r\nof warlike stores found at Sebastopol. That there should have remained\r\nthere four thousand cannon, after the wear and tear of the Siege,\r\nproves the great importance attached by the Russian Government to that\r\nArsenal over which your Majesty's Flag is now triumphantly flying.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 82: He had gone out to the Crimea, and entered\r\n    Sebastopol with General Simpson.

Moreover, Marshal Vaillant receiving the G.C.B., whilst it\r\nhas been thought more prudent not to accept the _Légion d'Honneur_ for\r\nLord Hardinge, makes it the more desirable. The Prince is now again\r\nthe only Field-Marshal in the Army, which has always had several. The\r\nQueen thinks that Lord Combermere, being the second senior officer of\r\nthe whole Army, a full General of 1825, might expect not to be passed\r\nover when Lord Hardinge is made. The only other General of distinction\r\nand seniority might be Lord Strafford, but he is only a full General\r\nof 1841. On this point Lord Palmerston might consult Lord Hardinge\r\nhimself. If he and Lord Combermere alone are made, the honour is the\r\ngreater for him.[83]\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks likewise that Lord Panmure ought to receive a mark\r\nof favour and approval of his conduct on the occasion of the Fall of\r\nSebastopol; either the Civil G.C.B. or a step in the Peerage--that of\r\nViscount.[84]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston would perhaps, without delay, give his opinion\r\non these subjects to the Queen; the honours she would wish then\r\n_personally_ to bestow upon the recipients, and she thinks the arrival\r\nof the official Despatches the right moment for doing so.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 83: Lord Hardinge, Lord Strafford, and Lord\r\n    Combermere were all made Field-Marshals.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 84: He received the G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prince Albert to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _21st September 1855_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD CLARENDON,--The Queen wishes me to send you the enclosed\r\nletters, with the request that they may be sent by messengers to\r\nCoblentz.[85]\r\n\r\nI may tell you in the strictest confidence that Prince Frederic\r\nWilliam has yesterday laid before us his wish for an alliance with the\r\nPrincess Royal with the full concurrence of his parents, as well as\r\nof the King of Prussia. We have accepted his proposal as far as we are\r\npersonally concerned, but have asked that the child should not be\r\nmade acquainted with it until after her confirmation, which is to take\r\nplace next Spring, when he might make it to her himself, and receive\r\nfrom her own lips the answer which is only valuable when flowing\r\nfrom those of the person chiefly concerned. A marriage would not be\r\npossible before the completion of the Princess's seventeenth year,\r\nwhich is in two years from this time. The Queen empowers me to say\r\nthat you may communicate this event to Lord Palmerston, but we beg\r\nthat under present circumstances it may be kept a strict secret.

I\r\nneed _not_ tell you with _what_ joy _we_ accepted him _for_ our\r\npart; but the child herself is to know nothing till _after_ her\r\nconfirmation, which is to take place next Easter, when he probably\r\nwill come over, and, as he wishes himself, make her the proposal,\r\nwhich, however, I have little--indeed no--doubt she will gladly\r\n_accept_. He is a dear, excellent, charming young man, whom we shall\r\ngive our dear child to with perfect confidence. What pleases us\r\ngreatly is to see that he is really delighted with Vicky.\r\n\r\nNow, with Albert's affectionate love, and with the prayer that _you_\r\nwill give _your_ blessing to this alliance, as you have done to ours,\r\never your devoted Niece and Child,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _22nd September 1855_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nbegs, in the first place, to be allowed to offer to your Majesty his\r\nmost sincere congratulations upon the prospective arrangement which\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince Albert announced in his letter to Lord\r\nClarendon, but which, for obvious reasons, should be left to public\r\nconjecture for the present.

Lord Stanley said that he should go down to Knowsley by the\r\nfive o'clock train this afternoon, and that he would at an early\r\nmoment communicate his answer to Viscount Palmerston; but he said\r\nthat if he was to state now his anticipation of what Lord Derby would\r\nrecommend and wish him to do, it would rather be to decline the offer.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 87: Sir William Molesworth, who had represented\r\n    Radicalism in the Cabinets of Lord Aberdeen and Lord\r\n    Palmerston, died on the 22nd, at the age of forty-five.

Viscount Palmerston having well considered\r\nthe matter in concert with Sir Charles Wood and Sir George Grey, is\r\nof opinion that it would be advantageous not only for the present, but\r\nalso with a view to the future, to detach Mr Herbert from the clique\r\nwith which accidental circumstances have for the moment apparently\r\nassociated him, and to fix him to better principles of action than\r\nthose by which Mr Gladstone and Sir James Graham appear to be guided.\r\nFor this purpose Viscount Palmerston proposes with your Majesty's\r\nsanction to offer to Mr Herbert to return to the Colonial Office,\r\nwhich he held on the formation of the present Government.\r\n\r\nMr Herbert is the most promising man of his standing in the House of\r\nCommons, and is personally very popular in that House; he is a good\r\nand an improving speaker, and his accession to the Government would\r\nadd a good speaker to the Treasury Bench, and take away a good speaker\r\nfrom ranks that may become hostile.\r\n\r\nHe would also supply the place of Lord Canning as a kind of link\r\nbetween the Government and some well-disposed members of both Houses\r\nwho belonged more or less to what is called the Peel Party. It would\r\nbe necessary, of course, to ascertain clearly that Mr Herbert's views\r\nabout the war and about conditions of peace are the same as they were\r\nwhen he was a Member of the Government, and not such as those which Mr\r\nGladstone and Sir James Graham have of late adopted.\r\n\r\nIf Mr Herbert were to accept, Sir George Grey, who has a strong\r\ndisinclination for the Colonies, would remain at the Home Office; and\r\nif Lord Harrowby would take the Post Office, which must be held by a\r\nPeer, the Duchy of Lancaster, which may be held by a Commoner, might\r\nbe offered to Mr Baines[88] with a seat in the Cabinet, and Mr Baines\r\nmight perhaps, with reference to his health, prefer an office not\r\nattended with much departmental business of detail, while he would be\r\nthus more free to make himself master of general questions. Such an\r\narrangement would leave the Cabinet, as stated in the accompanying\r\npaper, seven and seven; and if afterwards Lord Stanley of Alderley\r\nwere added in the Lords, and Sir Benjamin Hall in the Commons, which,\r\nhowever, would be a matter entirely for future consideration, the\r\nequality of division would still be preserved.[89]\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston finds that Mr Herbert is gone down to Wilton, and\r\nas Viscount Palmerston is going this afternoon to Broadlands to\r\nremain there till Tuesday morning, he proposes during the interval to\r\ncommunicate with Mr Herbert, Wilton being not much more than an hour's\r\ndistance from Broadlands by the Salisbury railway.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 88: Mr. Matthew Talbot Baines died prematurely in\r\n    1860.

Whatever may be the case,\r\nthe Queen thinks it the wisest course not to disturb the Emperor's\r\nplans, or to show suspicion of them, but merely to insist upon the\r\nimportance of the Army in the Crimea being kept so imposing that\r\nRussia cannot safely arrange her plans on the supposition of a change\r\nof policy on the part of the Western Powers.\r\n\r\nHad the Queen known of Lord Cowley's letter a few hours earlier, she\r\ncould have spoken to the Duke of Cambridge, who was here; as it was,\r\nboth she and the Prince were very cautious and reserved in what they\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thought it right to let Sir Hamilton Seymour, who is staying\r\nhere, see the letters, as his thorough acquaintance with the present\r\nposition of affairs is most important.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 90: The Emperor was now bent on the termination\r\n    of hostilities, and the French and Austrian Governments had\r\n    concerted proposals for peace to be submitted to Russia, with\r\n    which they somewhat peremptorily demanded that England should\r\n    concur. Lord Palmerston announced that, rather than make an\r\n    unsatisfactory peace, he would continue the war without the\r\n    aid of France. States such as Saxony and Bavaria favoured\r\n    Russia, and Baron Beust and M. von der Pfordten, their\r\n    respective Prime Ministers, had interviews with the Emperor,\r\n    who was anxious for peace on the basis of the Third Point,\r\n    on which, since the fall of Sebastopol, the Allies were in a\r\n    better position to insist.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Charles Wood._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _16th November 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes to draw Sir Charles Wood's attention to a subject\r\nwhich may become of much importance for the future. It is the absence\r\nof any Dockyard for building and repairing out of the Channel,\r\nwith the exception of Pembroke. Should we ever be threatened by\r\na combination of Russia and France, the absence of a Government\r\nestablishment in the north would be very serious. It strikes the Queen\r\nthat the present moment, when our yards hardly supply the demands\r\nmade upon them, and when attention is directed to the Baltic, is a\r\nparticularly favourable one to add an establishment in the Firth of\r\nForth, for which the Queen believes the Government possess the ground\r\nat Leith. Such a measure would at the same time be very popular in\r\nScotland, and by making the Queen's Navy known there, which it hardly\r\nis at present, would open a new field for recruiting our Marine.\r\n\r\nWhether Cork in Ireland should not also be made more available is very\r\nwell worth consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would ask Sir Charles to communicate this letter to Lord\r\nPalmerston, who has always had the state of our powers of defence so\r\nmuch at heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE AUSTRIAN ULTIMATUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _19th November 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has attentively perused the voluminous papers, which she now\r\nreturns according to Lord Clarendon's wish.\r\n\r\nAn anxious consideration of their contents has convinced her that it\r\nwould be the height of impolicy if we were not to enter fairly and\r\nunreservedly into the French proposal, and she wishes Lord Clarendon\r\nto express this her opinion to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the Austrian Ultimatum are clear and complete and very\r\nfavourable to us, if accepted by Russia.[91] If refused, which they\r\nalmost must be, rupture of diplomatic relations between Austria and\r\nRussia is a decided step gained by us, and will produce a state of\r\nthings which can scarcely fail to lead them to war.\r\n\r\nA refusal to entertain the proposal may induce and perhaps justify the\r\nEmperor of the French in backing out of the War, which would leave us\r\nin a miserable position.\r\n\r\nIf we are to agree to the Emperor's wishes, it must be politic not to\r\nrisk the advantage of the whole measure by a discussion with Austria\r\nupon minor points of detail, which will cost time, and may lead to\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 91: The Queen and her Ministers, however, insisted\r\n    that the neutralisation clause (the Third Point) should be\r\n    made effective, not left illusory, and incorporated in the\r\n    principal and not in a supplementary treaty. Modified in this\r\n    and other particulars, an ultimatum embodying the Austrian\r\n    proposals, which stipulated, _inter alia_, for the cession of\r\n    a portion of Bessarabia, was despatched to St Petersburg on\r\n    the 15th of December, and the 18th of January was fixed as the\r\n    last day on which a reply would be accepted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Hardinge._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd November 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen informs Lord Hardinge that on speaking to Sir Colin Campbell\r\nyesterday, and informing him how much she wished that his valuable\r\nservices should not be lost to her Army in the Crimea, he replied in\r\nthe handsomest manner, that he would return immediately--\"for that, if\r\nthe Queen wished it, he was ready to serve under a Corporal\"!\r\nConduct like this is very gratifying, and will only add to Sir Colin\r\nCampbell's high name; but, as by Lord Hardinge's and Lord Panmure's\r\nadvice, the Queen has obtained from him this _sacrifice_ of _his\r\nown_ feelings to _her_ wishes, _she_ feels personally bound _not_\r\nto _permit_ him to be passed over a _second_ time should the Command\r\nagain become vacant.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has had a good deal of conversation with him, and from what\r\nhe told her, as well as from what she has heard from others, there\r\nseems to be a good deal of laxity of discipline--particularly as\r\nregards the officers--in the Army in the Crimea; and she thinks Lord\r\nHardinge should give an order to prevent so many officers coming home\r\non leave except when _really ill_. The effect of this on the French\r\nis very bad, and the Prince had a letter only two days ago from the\r\nPrince of Prussia, saying that every one was shocked at the manner in\r\nwhich our officers came home, and that it lowered our Army very much\r\nin the eyes of foreign Armies, and generally decreased the\r\nsympathy for our troops. We deeply regret the death of poor General\r\nMarkham.[92]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 92: He commanded the 2nd Division of the Army at\r\n    the attack on the Redan, and after the fall of Sebastopol, his\r\n    health, already shattered, broke down completely; he returned\r\n    home, and died on the 21st of November.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FRANCE AND AUSTRIA]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NEUTRALISATION CLAUSE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd November 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letter, and returns the very\r\nsatisfactory enclosures from Lord Cowley. Count Walewski remains true\r\nto himself; yet the admission that the Neutralisation Clause ought to\r\nbe part of the European treaty, and not an annex, which _he makes_, is\r\nthe most important concession which we could desire. That the Sea\r\nof Azov is to be dropped the Queen is glad of, as it would appear so\r\nhumiliating to Russia that Austria would probably decline proposing\r\nit. What the Queen is most afraid of, and what she believes actuates\r\nthe Emperor also, is the consideration that Austria, made aware of\r\nthe intense feeling for Peace _à tout prix_ in France, might get\r\nfrightened at the good terms for us she meant to propose to Russia,\r\nand might long for an opportunity given by us, in any unreasonable\r\ndemand for modification, to back out of her proposal altogether. Lord\r\nA. Loftus in his last letter states that Baron Manteuffel[93] even was\r\nafraid of having admitted as proper, terms too hard upon Russia, since\r\npeace is wanted at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe course intended to be pursued by Lord Clarendon in summing up the\r\nwhole question in a public Despatch seems quite the right one, as it\r\nwould never do, on the other hand, to let England be considered as\r\nmerely _à la remorque_ of France, an impression unfortunately very\r\nprevalent on the Continent at this moment.[94]\r\n\r\nAs to Marshal Pélissier, the best thing the Emperor could do would be\r\nto recall him, and to put a younger and more enterprising man in his\r\nplace. As we have got our hero coming home, his French colleague might\r\nbe recalled also.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle's letter is very interesting; the Queen will\r\nreturn it this evening. It confirms the truth of the axiom that a\r\n_settled policy_ ought to precede a military plan of campaign, for\r\nwhich the Prince is always contending.\r\n\r\nWe have been much pleased with old Sir Colin Campbell, who is a\r\nthorough soldier, and appears not at all wanting in good sense. On\r\nasking him about our rising men, and the officer whom _he_ would point\r\nout as the one of most promise, he said that Colonel Mansfield[95] was\r\nwithout comparison the man from whom great services could be expected\r\nboth in the Field and as an Administrator. Lord Clarendon will be\r\npleased to hear this, but will also not be surprised if the Queen\r\nshould look out for an opportunity to reclaim him for the Army from\r\nthe Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 93: President of the Prussian Ministry.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 94: Lord Clarendon, in the letter to which this\r\n    was a reply, observed that he had asked Lord Cowley to inform\r\n    Count Walewski that he would have to learn that England was a\r\n    principal in the matter, and \"not a political and diplomatic\r\n    Contingent.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 95: He had distinguished himself in the first\r\n    Sikh War, and was in 1855 Military Adviser to the British\r\n    Ambassador at Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th November 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns Lord Cowley's letter and General Pélissier's\r\ntelegram. Lord Cowley is quite right in insisting upon a clear\r\nunderstanding between England and France before negotiations are\r\nentered into with Austria. To come to a speedy agreement, it will be\r\nwise to drop the minor points and _insist_ upon the most important.\r\nThese the Queen takes to be the incorporation of the _Neutralisation_\r\nClause in the general Treaty, and the promise on the part of Austria\r\nnot to accept and communicate to us counter-proposals from Russia. If\r\nFrance agreed to this, we might agree to the rest of the arrangement.\r\nGeneral Pélissier's plan has the advantage of setting us free, but\r\ndeprives us of the Sardinians in the field, an object the French\r\nhave kept steadily in view. The Duke of Cambridge will come down here\r\nto-night, and we may then hear more on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of the French has been taken dangerously ill at Genoa; the\r\nDuc d'Aumale and Prince de Joinville have been summoned by telegraph.\r\nThe Queen has asked the Foreign Office to telegraph to enquire after\r\nthe Queen's state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR WILLIAM CODRINGTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir William Codrington._[96]\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _26th November 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe first Despatches of Sir William Codrington, acknowledging his\r\nappointment to the Command of the Queen's gallant Army in the East,\r\nhaving arrived, she will no longer delay writing herself to Sir\r\nWilliam, to assure him of her support and confidence in his new,\r\nproud, and important, though at the same time difficult position.\r\nShe wishes to assure him of her confidence and support. It is with\r\npleasure that she sees the son of her old friend and devoted servant,\r\nhimself so distinguished in the sister Service, raised by his own\r\nmerits to so exalted a position. Sir William knows the Queen's pride\r\nin her beloved Troops, as well as her unceasing solicitude for their\r\nwelfare and glory, and she trusts he will on all occasions express\r\nthese feelings from herself personally.\r\n\r\nThe Queen feels certain that Sir William Codrington will learn, with\r\ngreat satisfaction, that that distinguished and gallant officer, Sir\r\nColin Campbell, has most readily and handsomely complied with the\r\nQueen's wishes that he should return to the Crimea and take command\r\nof the First Corps d'Armée. His presence and his assistance will be\r\nof essential service to Sir William Codrington, who, the Queen knows,\r\nentertains so high an opinion of him.\r\n\r\nThe Prince wishes his sincere congratulations and kind remembrance to\r\nbe conveyed to Sir William Codrington.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would be glad if Sir William could--when he has leisure to\r\ndo so--from time to time write to her himself, informing her of the\r\nstate of her Army, and of affairs in the Crimea.\r\n\r\nShe concludes with every wish for his welfare and success.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 96: Considerable difficulty had been found in\r\n    appointing a successor to General Simpson, who had resigned\r\n    a task which he found overtaxed his powers. Sir William\r\n    Codrington was junior to three other Generals, who might\r\n    have felt aggrieved by being passed over. The sagacity of the\r\n    Prince found a way out of the difficulty by appointing two\r\n    of the three to the commands of the two _corps d'armée_ into\r\n    which the Army had, at his instance, been subdivided.

He leaves us to-morrow at an extraordinary hour--four\r\no'clock in the morning (which you did once or twice)--wishing to be at\r\nCompiègne to-morrow night, and at Turin on Tuesday. He is _eine ganz\r\nbesondere, abenteuerliche Erscheinung_, startling in the extreme in\r\nappearance and manner when you _first_ see him, but, just as Aumale\r\nsays, _il faut l'aimer quand on le connaît bien_. He is so frank,\r\nopen, just, straightforward, liberal and tolerant, with much sound\r\ngood sense. He never breaks his word, and you may rely on him, but\r\nwild and extravagant, courting adventures and dangers, and with a very\r\nstrange, short, rough manner, an exaggeration of that short manner of\r\nspeaking which his poor brother had. He is shy in society, which makes\r\nhim still more brusque, and he does not know (never having been out of\r\nhis own country or even out in Society) what to say to the number\r\nof people who are presented to him here, and which is, I know from\r\nexperience, a most odious thing. He is truly attached to the Orleans\r\nfamily, particularly to Aumale, and will be a friend and adviser to\r\nthem. To-day he will be invested with the Order of the Garter. He is\r\nmore like a Knight or King of the Middle Ages than anything one knows\r\nnowadays.\r\n\r\nOn Monday we go to Osborne till the 21st.\r\n\r\nOne word about Vicky. I must say that she has a quick discernment of\r\ncharacter, and I have never seen her take _any_ predilection for a\r\nperson which was _not motivé_ by personal amiability, goodness, or\r\ndistinction of some kind or other. You need be under no apprehension\r\nwhatever on this subject; and she has, moreover, great tact and\r\n_esprit de conduite_. It is quite extraordinary how popular she is in\r\nSociety--and again now, all these Foreigners are so struck with her\r\nsense and _conversation_ for her age.\r\n\r\nHoping soon to hear from you again, and wishing that naughty Stockmar\r\nmay yet be brought to come, believe me ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 97: King Victor Emmanuel was received with\r\n    great cordiality by the English people, grateful for his\r\n    co-operation and for the gallantry of his soldiers at the\r\n    Tchernaya.

Viscount Palmerston on his return\r\nfrom Woburn, where he was for two days, saw the Duke of Newcastle, but\r\nfound that the enclosed letter expressed the intention which he had\r\nformed. Viscount Palmerston would propose to your Majesty the Earl\r\nof Fortescue as a deserving object of your Majesty's gracious favour;\r\nLord Fortescue held the high office of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and\r\nis a person highly and universally respected.[98]\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston cannot refrain from saying on this occasion that\r\nhe is not without a misgiving that the high amount of fees which he\r\nunderstands is paid by persons who are made Knights of the Garter may\r\nhave some effect in rendering those whose incomes are not very large\r\nless anxious than they would otherwise be to receive this distinction;\r\nand he cannot but think that it is unseemly in general that persons\r\nupon whom your Majesty may be disposed to confer dignities and\r\nhonours, either as a mark of your Majesty's favour or as a reward for\r\ntheir public services, should on that account be subject to a heavy\r\npecuniary fine; and he intends to collect information with a view to\r\nconsider whether all such fees might not be abolished, the officers to\r\nwhom they are now paid receiving compensation in the shape of adequate\r\nfixed salary.[99] ...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 98: Earl Fortescue received the Garter; he died in\r\n    1861.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 99: This reform was effected in 1905.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd December 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Panmure's answer to her letter from\r\nOsborne, and is glad to see from it that he is quite agreed with the\r\nQueen on the subject of the Land Transport Corps. She would _most\r\nstrongly_ urge Lord Panmure to give at once _carte blanche_ to Sir\r\nW. Codrington to organise it as he thinks best, and to make him\r\npersonally responsible for it. We have only eight weeks left to the\r\nbeginning of spring; a few references home and their answers would\r\nconsume the whole of that time! The Army has now to carry their huts\r\non their backs up to the Camp; if it had been fighting, it would have\r\nperished for want of them, like the last winter. If each Division,\r\nBrigade, and Battalion has not got within itself what it requires for\r\nits daily existence in the field, a movement will be quite impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Queen approves the intended increase of Artillery and Sappers\r\nand Miners; but hopes that these will be taken from the _nominal_ and\r\n_not_ the existing strength of the Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter two years' duration, the Crimean War was terminated in March\r\n1856, at a Conference of the Powers assembled at Paris, by a treaty\r\nthe principal terms of which provided for the integrity of Turkey,\r\nand her due participation in the public law and system of Europe,\r\nthe neutralisation of the Black Sea, and the opening of its waters to\r\ncommerce (with the interdiction, except in a limited degree, of the\r\nflag of war of any nation, and of the erection by either Russia or\r\nTurkey of arsenals), free navigation of the Danube, cession of a\r\nportion of Bessarabia by Russia, and the reciprocal evacuation of\r\ninvaded territories; the Principalities to be continued in their\r\nexisting privileges under the suzerainty of the Porte and a guarantee\r\nof the Contracting Powers. No European protectorate was to be\r\nestablished over the Sultan's Christian subjects. Certain general\r\nprinciples of International Law were also agreed upon. In the course\r\nof the summer, the Guards made a public re-entry into London; and the\r\nCrimea was finally evacuated; great reviews of the returned troops\r\ntaking place at Aldershot. The thanks of Parliament were accorded to\r\nthe soldiers and sailors engaged, and peace-rejoicings celebrated on a\r\ngreat scale.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners who had been sent out, nearly a year before, to the\r\nCrimea, to investigate the causes of the breakdown in various military\r\ndepartments, presented a Report, censuring several high officials;\r\na Military Commission was accordingly appointed to investigate the\r\nReport, and after sitting for some months at Chelsea, completely\r\nexonerated the officials in question.\r\n\r\nThe Government having resolved to strengthen the administration of the\r\nappellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords, Letters Patent were made\r\nout purporting to create Sir James Parke, an ex-Judge, a Baron for\r\nhis life, under the title of Lord Wensleydale. After frequent and\r\nprotracted debates on this question, the Peers decided that such\r\na patent conferred no right to sit and vote in Parliament. The\r\nGovernment gave up the contest by creating Sir James (who had no son)\r\na hereditary peer.\r\n\r\nThe Czar Alexander was crowned at Moscow in September with great\r\nceremonial, the Sultan being duly represented, while Lord Granville\r\nwas present as special Ambassador for the Queen. The discovery of\r\nthe cruelty with which political offenders were being treated in\r\nNeapolitan prisons led to the rupture of diplomatic relations between\r\nEngland in union with France on the one hand, and King Ferdinand on\r\nthe other; while a dispute as to the enlistment of recruits for the\r\nEnglish Army in the United States led to the dismissal of the British\r\nMinister at Washington, and to temporary friction between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Treaty of Paris were not carried out without\r\nconsiderable procrastination on the part of Russia, which, by its\r\nmethod of evacuating Kars and surrendering Ismail and Reni, and by\r\nlaying claim to Serpent's Island at the mouth of the Danube, compelled\r\nEngland to send a fleet to the Black Sea, to enforce strict observance\r\nof the Treaty. By the end of the year the matter was arranged, though\r\nin the meantime the possibility of Great Britain being represented at\r\nthe Czar's coronation had been imperilled.\r\n\r\nThe abuses which had long existed in the Government of Oudh induced\r\nthe Governor-General of India, early in the year, to issue a\r\nproclamation placing that kingdom permanently under the authority of\r\nthe British Crown. Lord Dalhousie at this time retired from the office\r\n(which he had held for eight years) of Governor-General, and was\r\nsucceeded by Lord Canning. It fell to the lot of the latter to\r\nannounce the commencement of hostilities between this country and\r\nPersia, on the ground that the latter was endeavouring, in defiance\r\nof Treaties, to subvert the independence of Herat. The Shah had laid\r\nsiege to the town, when, in December, the English fleet, under Admiral\r\nSir Henry Leeke, attacked and captured Bushire on the Persian Gulf.\r\nSoon afterwards, Sir James Outram arrived on the scene from Bombay,\r\nand assumed the command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n1856\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _5th January 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the drawings for the \"Victoria Cross.\" She has\r\nmarked the one she approves with an X; she thinks, however, that it\r\nmight be a trifle smaller. The motto would be better \"For Valour\" than\r\n\"For the Brave,\" as this would lead to the inference that only those\r\nare deemed brave who have got the Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _7th January 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letter, and in answer to his\r\nquestion expresses her opinion that Lord Cowley's presence at the\r\nCouncil of War will be absolutely necessary.[1] She believes Lord\r\nClarendon to be agreed with her, that the value of a plan of military\r\ncampaign is entirely dependent upon the _general policy_ which the\r\nGovernment intends to pursue. As none of our Commissioners at the\r\nCouncil of War are in the least acquainted with the latter, they might\r\nbe drawn into plans which would not at all agree with it. Lord Cowley\r\nwould take that part of the question into his own hands, in which\r\nit will be quite safe. The Queen thinks that it is of secondary\r\nimportance whether Count Walewski attends or not, but that the Emperor\r\ncannot have the same need of his presence which we have of that of our\r\nAmbassador.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: A satisfactory and speedy conclusion of\r\n    hostilities appearing at this time far from probable, a\r\n    Council of War to settle the course of operations was, at the\r\n    Emperor's suggestion, summoned to meet at Paris. Lord Cowley,\r\n    Count Walewski, Prince Jérôme Bonaparte, and others, were\r\n    present, besides Naval and Military representatives of the\r\n    Allies, among whom was the Duke of Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: POLICY OF CAVOUR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _9th January 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has read Sir J. Hudson's[2] letter with much interest.\r\nThere is much truth in what Count Cavour says, and it must ever be our\r\nobject and our interest to see Sardinia independent and strong; as\r\na Liberal constitutional country, opposing a barrier alike to\r\nunenlightened and absolute as well as revolutionary principles--and\r\nthis she has a right to expect us to support her in.\r\n\r\nBut _what_ she wants to obtain from Austria is not clear. She has no\r\nright, however, to expect further assurances from us on wishes which\r\nshe seems even to be afraid to state distinctly.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly impossible to ask Austria to give up a portion of Italy\r\nto her, if nothing has occurred to make this necessary to Austria. At\r\nany rate Sardinia can have lost nothing, but on the contrary must\r\nhave gained by the position which she is placed in as an ally of the\r\nWestern Powers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: British Minister at Turin, and an enthusiastic\r\n    sympathiser with Cavour. The latter had complained to him that\r\n    if the Austrian proposals were accepted, and peace were made,\r\n    Sardinia could expect no realisation of her cherished hopes,\r\n    viz.

It is quite natural and excusable that our patience\r\nshould at last be worn out by the miserable policy which Prussia is\r\npursuing, but it can never be our interest openly to quarrel with her.\r\nThis would be simply playing the game of Russia, who would thus be\r\nrelieved from all attacks upon her and see the theatre of the war\r\ntransferred to Germany; all other complications (which would arise\r\ntherefrom)--ruinous to the best interests of the Western Powers\r\nas they would be--the Queen need not refer to. But when the draft\r\nconcludes with a declaration to Prussia that England \"_considers her\r\nneutrality as now at an end_,\" this is tantamount to a declaration of\r\n_war!_ The late articles in our newspapers, and the language of Count\r\nWalewski to Lord Cowley, make the Queen doubly anxious to warn the\r\nGovernment not to let themselves be drawn on to such a policy.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The draft expressed disapproval of the silence\r\n    maintained by the Prussian Government towards England with\r\n    regard to the Austrian proposals, of the active measures\r\n    adopted to induce the German Powers not to take part with\r\n    Austria, as well as of the extended facilities afforded by\r\n    Prussia to Russia for carrying on the war.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER FROM NAPOLEON III]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR AND PEACE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Emperor of the French to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nTUILERIES, _le 14 Janvier 1856_.\r\n\r\nMADAME ET CHÈRE S[OE]UR,--Votre Majesté m'ayant permis de lui parler\r\nà c[oe]ur ouvert toutes les fois que des circonstances graves se\r\nprésenteraient, je viens aujourd'hui profiter de la faveur qu'elle a\r\nbien voulu m'accorder.\r\n\r\nJe viens de recevoir aujourd'hui la nouvelle de la réponse de la\r\nRussie à l'Ultimatum de Vienne, et avant d'avoir manifesté mon\r\nimpression à qui que ce soit, pas même à Walewski, je viens la\r\ncommuniquer à votre Majesté pour avoir son avis.\r\n\r\nJe résume la question: La Russie accepte tout l'Ultimatum autrichien\r\nsauf la rectification de frontière de la Bessarabie, et sauf le\r\nparagraphe relatif aux conditions _particulières_ qu'elle déclare ne\r\npas connaître. De plus, profitant du succès de Kars, elle s'engage à\r\nrendre cette forteresse et le territoire occupé en échange des points\r\nque nous possédons en Crimée et ailleurs.\r\n\r\nDans quelle position allons-nous nous trouver? D'après la convention,\r\nl'Autriche est obligée de retirer son ambassadeur, et nous, nous\r\npoursuivons la guerre! Mais dans quel but allons-nous demander à nos\r\ndeux pays de nouveaux sacrifices d'hommes et d'argent? Pour un intérêt\r\npurement autrichien et pour une question qui ne consolide en rien\r\nl'empire ottoman.\r\n\r\nCependant nous y sommes obligés et nous ne devons pas avoir l'air\r\nde manquer à nos engagements. Nous serions donc placés dans une\r\nalternative bien triste si l'Autriche elle-même ne semblait pas déjà\r\nnous inviter de ne point rompre toute négociation. Or en réfléchissant\r\naujourd'hui à cette situation, je me disais: ne pourrait-on pas\r\nrépondre à l'Autriche ceci: La prise de Kars a tant soit peu changé\r\nnos situations; puisque la Russie consent à évacuer toute l'Asie\r\nMineure nous nous bornons à demander pour la Turquie, au lieu de la\r\nrectification de frontière, les places fortes formant _tête de pont_\r\nsur le Danube, tels que Ismail et Kilia. Pour nous, nous demandons en\r\nfait de conditions particulières, l'engagement de ne point rétablir\r\nles forts des îles d'Aland et une amnistie pour les Tartares. Mon\r\nsentiment est qu'à ces conditions-là la paix serait très désirable;\r\ncar sans cela je ne puis pas m'empêcher de redouter l'opinion publique\r\nquand elle me dira: \"Vous aviez obtenu le but réel de la guerre, Aland\r\nétait tombé et ne pouvait plus se relever, Sebastopol avait eu le\r\nmême sort, la flotte Russe était anéantie, et la Russie promettait non\r\nseulement de ne plus la faire reparaître dans la Mer Noire, mais même\r\nde ne plus avoir d'arsenaux maritimes sur toutes ses rives; la Russie\r\nabandonnait ses conquêtes dans l'Asie Mineure, elle abandonnait son\r\nprotectorat dans les principautés, son action sur le cours du Danube,\r\nson influence sur ces correligionnaires sujets du Sultan, etc.,\r\netc. Vous aviez obtenu tout cela non sans d'immenses sacrifices et\r\ncependant vous allez les continuer, compromettre les finances de la\r\nFrance, répandre ses trésors et son sang et pourquoi: pour obtenir\r\nquelques landes de la Bessarabie!!!\"\r\n\r\nVoilà, Madame, les réflexions qui me préoccupent; car autant je me\r\nsens de force quand je crois être dans le vrai pour inculquer mes\r\nidées à mon pays et pour lui faire partager ma persuasion, autant je\r\nme sentirais faible si je n'étais pas sûr d'avoir raison ni de faire\r\nmon devoir.\r\n\r\nMais ainsi que je l'ai dit en commençant à votre Majesté je n'ai\r\ncommuniqué ma première impression qu'au Duc de Cambridge, et autour de\r\nmoi au contraire j'ai dit qu'il fallait continuer la guerre. J'espère\r\nque votre Majesté accueillera avec bonté cette lettre écrite à la\r\nhâte et qu'elle y verra une nouvelle preuve de mon désir de m'entendre\r\ntoujours avec elle avant de prendre une résolution. En remerciant\r\nvotre Majesté de l'aimable lettre que S.A.R. le Duc de Cambridge m'a\r\nremise de sa part, je la prie de recevoir la nouvelle assurance de mes\r\nsentiments de tendre et respectueux attachement avec lesquels je suis\r\nde votre Majesté, le bon frère et ami,\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON.\r\n\r\nJe remercie bien le Prince Arthur de son bon souvenir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _15th January 1856_.\r\n\r\n...

She will enclose it _open_ to Lord Clarendon,\r\nwho will seal and send it after having read it.\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot conceal from Lord Clarendon what _her own_ feelings\r\nand wishes at this moment are. They _cannot_ be for peace _now_, for\r\nshe is _convinced_ that this country would _not_ stand in the eyes of\r\nEurope as she _ought_, and as the Queen is convinced she _would_ after\r\n_this_ year's campaign. The honour and glory of her dear Army is as\r\n_near_ her heart as almost anything, and she cannot _bear_ the thought\r\nthat \"the failure on the Redan\" should be our _last fait d'Armes_, and\r\nit would cost her more than words can express to conclude a peace with\r\n_this_ as the end. However, what is best and wisest must be done.\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot yet bring herself to believe that the Russians are at\r\nall sincere, or that it will _now_ end in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S REPLY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Emperor of the French._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _le 15 Janvier 1856_.\r\n\r\nSIRE ET CHER FRÈRE,--La bonne et aimable lettre que je viens de\r\nrecevoir de la main de votre Majesté m'a causé un très-vif plaisir.\r\nJ'y vois une preuve bien satisfaisante pour moi que vous avez apprécié\r\ntous les avantages de ces épanchements sans réserve, et que votre\r\nMajesté en sent comme moi le besoin dans les circonstances graves où\r\nnous sommes. Je sens aussi toute la responsabilité que votre confiance\r\nm'impose, et c'est dans la crainte qu'une opinion formée et exprimée\r\npar moi trop à la hâte pourrait nuire à la décision finale à prendre\r\nque je me vois obligée de différer pour le moment la réponse plus\r\ndétaillée sur les considérations que vous avez si clairement et si\r\nconsciencieusement développées. Cependant, je ne veux point tarder de\r\nvous remercier de votre lettre, et de vous soumettre de mon côté les\r\nréflexions qui me sont venues en la lisant. La Réponse Russe ne nous\r\nest pas encore arrivée; nous n'en connaissons pas exactement les\r\ntermes; par conséquent, il serait imprudent de former une opinion\r\ndéfinitive sur la manière d'y répondre, surtout comme le Prince\r\nGortschakoff paraît avoir demandé un nouveau délai du Gouvernement\r\nAutrichien et de nouvelles instructions de St Pétersbourg, et comme M.\r\nde Bourqueney paraît penser que la Russie n'a pas dit son dernier\r\nmot. Nous pourrions donc perdre une chance d'avoir de meilleures\r\nconditions, en montrant trop d'empressement à accueillir celles\r\noffertes dans ce moment. Celles-ci arriveront peut-être dans le\r\ncourant de la journée, ou demain, quand mon Cabinet sera réuni pour\r\nles examiner. Nous sommes au 15; le 18 les relations diplomatiques\r\nentre l'Autriche et la Russie doivent être rompues; je crois que\r\nnotre position vis-à-vis de la Russie sera meilleure en discutant\r\nses propositions après la rupture et après en avoir vu les effets.\r\nEn attendant, rien ne sera plus utile à la cause de la paix que la\r\nrésolution que vous avez si sagement prise de dire à tous ceux qui\r\nvous approchent qu'il faut continuer la guerre. Soyez bien sûr que\r\ndans l'opinion finale que je me formerai, votre position et votre\r\npersuasion personnelle seront toujours présentes à mon esprit et\r\nauront le plus grand poids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE BRITISH ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _17th January 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the Duke of Cambridge's and Lord Cowley's letters,\r\nwhich together with the account which Lord Clarendon gives of his\r\ninterview with M. de Persigny causes the Queen no little anxiety. If\r\nnegotiations on a vague basis are allowed to be begun, the Russian\r\nnegotiator is sure to find out that the French are ready to grant\r\nanything....\r\n\r\nHowever, whatever happens, one consolation the Queen ever will have,\r\nwhich is--that with the one exception of that failure on the _Redan_,\r\nher noble Army--in spite of every possible disadvantage which any army\r\ncould labour under, _has_ invariably been victorious, and the Russians\r\nhave always and everywhere been beaten excepting at Kars, where\r\n_famine_ alone enabled them to succeed.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore not be (as alas! we have often been) its detractors\r\nby our croaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: POSITION OF THE EMPEROR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _17th January 1856_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nconcludes that Lord Lansdowne informed your Majesty that the Cabinet,\r\nafter hearing from Lord Clarendon a statement of the course of\r\nthe recent negotiations as explained by the despatches which Lord\r\nClarendon read, came to the decision that no further step should be\r\ntaken, and no further communication should be made to the Government\r\nof France on the matters at issue, until the final decision of the\r\nRussian Government on the pure and simple adoption of the Austrian\r\nultimatum[4] should be known. Viscount Palmerston begs to congratulate\r\nyour Majesty upon the telegraphic message received this morning from\r\nSir Hamilton Seymour, announcing that the Russian Government has\r\nadopted that Austrian ultimatum. So far so well, and the success which\r\nhas attended firmness and steadiness of purpose in regard to those\r\nconditions may be looked upon as a tolerably sure indication that a\r\nperseverance in the same course will bring the Russian Government to\r\nconsent to those remaining conditions which the Austrian Government\r\nhas not yet (as it says) made known to the Cabinet of Petersburg.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the letter of the Emperor of the French to your\r\nMajesty, and the statements made to Lord Clarendon by the Count de\r\nPersigny as to the difficulties of the Emperor's internal position\r\nwith respect to finance, and a general desire for peace throughout\r\nthe Nation, Viscount Palmerston expressed his opinion to the Cabinet\r\nyesterday that all those representations were greatly exaggerated. He\r\nis convinced that the Emperor of the French is perfectly master of his\r\nown position, and that he can as to peace or war take the course which\r\nhe may determine to adopt.\r\n\r\nThe cabal of stock-jobbing politicians, by whom he is surrounded,\r\n_must_ give way to him if he is firm. They have no standing place in\r\nthe confidence and respect of their fellow-countrymen, they represent\r\nnothing but the Stock Exchange speculations in which they are engaged,\r\nand the Emperor's throne would probably be stronger, rather than\r\nweaker, if they were swept away, and better men put in their places.\r\nAnd it is a very remarkable circumstance that at the very moment when\r\nyour Majesty and your Majesty's Government were being told that\r\nthe Emperor would be unable to go on with the war on account of the\r\ndifficulty of finding money, the French Government was putting forth\r\nin the _Moniteur_ an official statement showing that they have a\r\nreserve surplus of twenty-one millions sterling for defraying the\r\nexpenses of a campaign in the ensuing spring, without the necessity of\r\nraising any fresh loan.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston fully concurs in the sentiment of regret expressed\r\nby your Majesty to Lord Clarendon that the last action of the war in\r\nwhich your Majesty's troops have been engaged, should, if peace be now\r\nconcluded, have been the repulse at the Redan; but however it may suit\r\nnational jealousy, which will always be found to exist on the other\r\nside of the Channel, to dwell upon that check, yet your Majesty may\r\nrely upon it that the Alma and Inkerman have left recollections which\r\nwill dwell in the memory of the living and not be forgotten in the\r\npage of history; and although it would no doubt have been gratifying\r\nto your Majesty and to the Nation that another summer should have\r\nwitnessed the destruction of Cronstadt by your Majesty's gallant Navy,\r\nand the expulsion of the Russians from the countries south of the\r\nCaucasus by your Majesty's brave Army, yet if peace _can_ now be\r\nconcluded on conditions honourable and secure, it would, as your\r\nMajesty justly observes, not be right to continue the war for the\r\nmere purpose of prospective victories. It will, however, be obviously\r\nnecessary to continue active preparations for war up to the moment\r\nwhen a definite Treaty of Peace is signed, in order that the Russians\r\nmay not find it for their interest to break off negotiations when the\r\nseason for operations shall approach, emboldened by any relaxation\r\non the part of the Allies induced by too ready confidence in the good\r\nfaith of their adversary....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: See _ante_, 19th November, 1855, note 91.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE AT PARIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Cambridge to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nTUILERIES, _20th January 1856_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUSIN,--Your letters of the 14th and 18th have reached me,\r\nand I am happy to find by them that you approve in conjunction with\r\nthe Government with what has been done by me and my colleagues whilst\r\nat Paris.[5] I have given all the messages and carried out all the\r\ninstructions as contained in your letters, and I trust as far as\r\npossible I have been enabled to do some good. On the other hand, I\r\ncannot deny that the feelings universally expressed here as to the\r\nprospects of a speedy peace are so different from those felt in\r\nEngland, that it is extremely difficult to produce any impression in\r\nthe sense that we could wish it. France wishes for peace more than\r\nanything else on earth, and this feeling does not confine itself\r\nto Walewski or the Ministers--it extends itself to all classes. The\r\nEmperor alone is reasonable and sensible in this respect, but his\r\nposition is a most painful one, and he feels it very much. The fact\r\nis that public opinion is much more felt and more loudly expressed\r\nin this country than anybody in England at all imagines. No doubt the\r\nEmperor can do much that he wishes, but still he cannot go altogether\r\nagainst a feeling which so loudly expresses itself on all occasions,\r\nwithout thereby injuring his own position most seriously. I have\r\nwritten to Clarendon very fully on this subject, and have explained to\r\nhim my reasons for wishing to return to England as soon as possible,\r\nnow that our military mission is concluded. It is essential that\r\nI should see the members of the Government, and that I should\r\ncommunicate to them the exact state of feeling here and the views of\r\nthe Emperor as to the mode of smoothing down all difficulties. This\r\ncan only be done by a personal interview on the part of somebody\r\nthoroughly aware of the present position of affairs. Probably at this\r\nmoment I am in a better position to do this than anybody else, from\r\nthe peculiar circumstances in which I have been placed while here, and\r\nit is this feeling which makes me desirous to return to England with\r\nthe least possible delay. It is my intention therefore to start\r\nwith my colleagues to-morrow, Monday night, for England, to which\r\narrangement the Emperor has given his sanction, and by which time he\r\nwill be prepared to tell me what he thinks had best be done, from his\r\nview of the question. I think it my duty to communicate this to you,\r\nand hope that you will give my resolution your sanction. I beg to\r\nremain, my dear Cousin, your most dutiful Cousin,\r\n\r\nGEORGE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: At the Council of War.

There seems, however, really no _end_ to _cancans_ at\r\n_Paris_; for the Duke of Cambridge seems to have shared the same fate.\r\nThe two atmospheres of France and England, as well as the Society, are\r\nso different that people get to talk differently. It seems also that\r\nthe King got frightened lest he should at Paris be thought too liberal\r\nin his _religious_ views (having been complimented for it) which he\r\nwas very proud of--and thought it necessary to tell the _Emperor_ he\r\nwas a _good Catholic_. This is not unnatural in his peculiar position.\r\nWhen Lord Clarendon goes to Paris, he will be able to _silence_ any\r\nfurther allusion to these idle stories which only lead to mischief,\r\nand which even Lord Cowley seems to have made more of (as to his own\r\nfeelings upon them) than was necessary, but that is equally natural.\r\nSpeaking of his King--General La Marmora said: \"Il ne dira jamais ce\r\nqu'il ne pense pas, mais il dit quelquefois ce qui serait mieux qu'il\r\nne dit pas.\" He more than any other regrets the King's not having seen\r\nmore of the world, and says his journey had done him a _great_ deal of\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: The Sardinian Commander had been attending the\r\n    Council of War at Paris.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The King of Sardinia was reported to have told\r\n    the Emperor that the latter's loyalty to the Alliance was\r\n    questioned by Great Britain, and that it was conjectured in\r\n    London that he was in favour of co-operation with Austria\r\n    instead.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\n_28th January 1856._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns to Lord Palmerston the draft of the speech, which\r\nshe thinks _extremely well_ worded, and which she therefore trusts\r\nwill be (with the exception of those passages marked) as little\r\naltered as possible. Lord John Russell used to say that as soon as\r\na speech was discussed in the Cabinet, it was so much _pruned_ and\r\naltered as to lose all its force. The Queen must own that she is\r\n_much_ alarmed at hearing that the _papers_ of the War Council were to\r\nbe printed and circulated amongst the Cabinet, as she fears that the\r\nsecrecy, which is so necessary, upon which the Emperor laid so _much\r\nstress_, will be very difficult to be maintained. The Emperor's\r\nopinion at least, the Queen hopes, will _not_ be printed or generally\r\ncirculated?\r\n\r\nThe Queen must again press for a very early decision on the subject.\r\nIf this is allowed to _drag_, it will appear, particularly to the\r\n_Emperor_, as if we were not really in earnest, though we stickled so\r\nmuch for our additional conditions, which might lessen the hopes\r\nof peace. Of course the Government must not give any answer on this\r\nsubject--should Parliament be so indiscreet as to ask _what_ the\r\nresult of the deliberations of the Council of War has been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWindsor Castle, _29th January 1856_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--You will kindly forgive my letter being short, but\r\nwe are going to be present this morning at the wedding of Phipps's\r\ndaughter[8] with that handsome lame young officer whom you remember\r\nat Osborne.

I cannot at all see HOW you could _even_ entertain\r\nthe question, for, as I just said, the _basis_ of the _existence_ of\r\nBelgium is her _neutrality_.\r\n\r\nThe weather is so mild that we should almost hope Stockmar would start\r\nsoon. If _he_ can't come himself, he should send his son for a few\r\ndays, who could bring us any confidential communication from his\r\nfather, and could be the bearer of any from us. Something of this kind\r\nis most necessary, for it is overwhelming to write to one another upon\r\nso many details which require immediate answer....\r\n\r\nWith Albert's love, and ours to your young people, believe me, always,\r\nyour devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\n_14th February 1856._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has seen in the reports of the House of Commons that a\r\nreturn has been moved for of all the decorations of the Bath given\r\nsince the war. The Queen hopes the Government will not allow the House\r\nof Commons so much further to trespass upon the prerogatives of\r\nthe Crown as now _virtually_ to take also the control over the\r\ndistribution of honours and rewards into their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: TERMS OF PEACE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _15th February 1856_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I have to thank you for your dear kind letter of\r\nthe 12th. Madame de Sévigné says, with great truth, that a letter to\r\nbe a good letter ought to be as if one heard the person speak; your\r\ndear letters are always so, and you would therefore be praised by\r\nMadame de Sévigné, and that very deservedly. Lord Clarendon is, Heaven\r\nbe praised, well calculated to bring matters to a happy conclusion. I\r\nwill try to make some impression on the mind of the Emperor Alexander,\r\nhis best policy will be the most honest. By all I can learn they\r\nwish most sincerely the conclusion of this war. If on the side of the\r\nAllies only the things which really protect the territories of\r\nthe present Turkish Empire are asked, the Russians ought not to\r\nman[oe]uvre, but grant it, and the Allies also ought to be moderate.\r\nYou are very properly never to be contradicted, but there are a few\r\nthings to be remarked. This neutrality was in the real interest of\r\nthis country, but our good Congress here did _not_ wish it, and even\r\nopposed it; it was _imposé_ upon them. A neutrality to be respected\r\nmust be _protected_. France at all time in cases of general war can\r\nput an end to it, by declaring to us _Vous devez être avec nous ou\r\ncontre nous_. If we answer _Nous sommes neutres_, they will certainly\r\ntry to occupy us; then the case of self-defence arises and the claim\r\nto be protected by the other powers....\r\n\r\nMy beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CONFERENCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Emperor of the French._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _le 15 Février 1856_.\r\n\r\nSIRE ET CHER FRÈRE,--Mes Commissaires pour le Conseil de Guerre sont\r\nà peine revenus de Paris et notre plan de campagne est à peine arrêté,\r\nque mes Plénipotentiaires pour la Conférence de paix se mettent\r\nen route pour assister sous les yeux de V.M. à l'[oe]uvre de la\r\npacification. Je n'ai pas besoin de vous recommander Lord Clarendon,\r\nmais je ne veux pas le laisser partir sans le rendre porteur de\r\nquelques mots de ma part.\r\n\r\nQuoique bien convaincue qu'il ne pourra dans les discussions\r\nprochaines s'élever de questions sur lesquelles il y aurait divergence\r\nd'opinions entre nos deux Gouvernements, j'attache toutefois le plus\r\nhaut prix à ce que l'accord le plus parfait soit établi avant que les\r\nconférences ne soient ouvertes; et c'est dans ce but que j'ai chargé\r\nLord Clarendon de se rendre à Paris quelques jours avant, afin qu'il\r\npût rendre un compte exact des opinions de mon Gouvernement, et jouir\r\nde l'avantage de connaître _à fond_ la pensée de V.M.\r\n\r\nJ'éprouverai un sentiment d'intime satisfaction dans ce moment\r\ncritique, et je le regarderai comme une preuve toute particulière\r\nde votre amitié, si vous voulez permettre à Lord Clarendon de vous\r\nexposer personnellement mes vues et d'entendre les Vôtres de Votre\r\nproper bouche.\r\n\r\nLes opérations de nos armées et de nos flottes combinées, sous un\r\ncommandement divisé, ont été sujettes à d'énormes difficultés; mais\r\nces difficultés ont été heureusement vaincues. Dans la Diplomatie\r\ncomme à la guerre, les Russes auront sur Nous le grand avantage de\r\nl'unité de plan et d'action, et je les crois plus forts sur ce terrain\r\nque sur le champ de bataille; mais à coup sûr, nous y resterons\r\négalement victorieux, si nous réussissons à empêcher l'ennemi de\r\ndiviser nos forces et de nous battre en détail.\r\n\r\nSans vouloir jeter un doute sur la sincérité de la Russie en acceptant\r\nnos propositions, il est impossible d'avoir à ce sujet une conviction\r\npleine et entière. J'ai tout lieu de croire cependant que nul effort\r\net nul stratagème ne seront negligés pour rompre, s'il était possible,\r\nou au moins pour affaiblir notre alliance. Mais je repose à cet égard\r\ndans la fermeté de V.M. la même confiance qui saura détruire\r\ntoutes ces espérances, que j'ai dans la mienne et dans celle de mes\r\nMinistres. Cependant, on ne saurait attacher trop d'importance à\r\nce que cette commune fermeté soit reconnue et appréciée dès le\r\ncommencement des négociations, car de là dépendra, j'en ai la\r\nconviction, la solution, si nous devons obtenir une paix dont les\r\ntermes pourront être considérés comme satisfaisants pour l'honneur de\r\nla France et de l'Angleterre, et comme donnant une juste compensation\r\npour les énormes sacrifices que les deux pays ont faits. Une autre\r\nconsidération encore me porte à attacher le plus haut prix à cet\r\naccord parfait, c'est que si, par son absence, nous étions entraînés\r\ndans une paix qui ne satisferait point la juste attente de nos\r\npeuples, cela donnerait lieu à des plaintes et à des récriminations\r\nqui ne pourraient manquer de fausser les relations amicales des deux\r\npays au lieu de les cimenter davantage comme mon c[oe]ur le désire\r\nardemment.\r\n\r\nD'ailleurs, je ne doute pas un moment qu'une paix telle que la France\r\net l'Angleterre ont le droit de la demander sera bien certainement\r\nobtenue par une détermination inébranlable de ne point rabaisser les\r\ndemandes modérées que nous avons faites.\r\n\r\nVous excuserez, Sire, la longueur de cette lettre, mais il m'est si\r\ndoux de pouvoir épancher mes sentiments sur toutes ces questions si\r\nimportantes et si difficiles, avec une personne que je considère non\r\nseulement comme un Allié fidèle, mais comme un ami sur lequel je puis\r\ncompter en toute occasion, et qui, j'en suis sûre, est animé envers\r\nnous des mêmes sentiments.\r\n\r\nLe Prince me charge de vous offrir ses hommages les plus affectueux,\r\net moi je me dis pour toujours, Sire et cher Frère, de V.M.I., la très\r\naffectionnée S[oe]ur et Amie,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CRIMEAN ENQUIRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _16th February 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe subject to which Lord Palmerston refers in his letter of last\r\nnight, and upon which the Cabinet is going to deliberate to-day, has\r\nalso caused the Queen much anxiety.\r\n\r\nA Civil Commission is sent out by the Government to enquire into the\r\nconduct of the officers in command in the Crimea; this is done without\r\nany consultation with the Commander-in-Chief. They report to the\r\nGovernment, inculpating several general officers and others in high\r\ncommand; this report is not communicated to the military authorities,\r\nnor to the persons affected by it, but is laid on the table of both\r\nHouses of Parliament.[12] These officers then for the first time\r\nfind themselves accused under the authority of Government, and that\r\naccusation communicated to the Legislature without ever having been\r\nheard in answer or allowed an opportunity to defend themselves. It\r\nis stated in both Houses by the Government that the officers may send\r\npapers in reply if they choose! But who is to be the Judge on the\r\ntrial? The Press, of course, and the _Times_ at the head, have already\r\njudged and condemned, and the House of Commons is now moving _in\r\ndefault of another Judge_ to constitute its tribunal by a Committee of\r\nEnquiry.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident if matters are left so, and military officers of\r\nthe Queen's Army are to be judged as to the manner in which they have\r\ndischarged their military duties before an enemy by a Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons, the command of the Army is at once transferred from\r\nthe Crown to that Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis result is quite inevitable if the Government appear as accusers,\r\nas they do by the report of their Commission, and then submit the\r\naccusation for Parliament to deal with, without taking any steps of\r\ntheir own!\r\n\r\nThe course suggested by Sir James Graham and alluded to by Lord\r\nPalmerston, of following the precedent of the enquiry into the\r\nConvention of Cintra,[13] appears therefore to the Queen to be the\r\nonly prudent one.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks it most unfair to the officers to publish their\r\nstatements beforehand, as these will not go before judges feeling\r\nthe weight of their responsibility, but before the newspapers who are\r\ntheir sworn enemies and determined to effect their ruin, for which\r\nthey possess unlimited means.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes Lord Palmerston to read this letter to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Sir John MacNeill and Colonel Tulloch had\r\n    been sent out to the Crimea early in 1855 to investigate the\r\n    breakdown of various military departments. They had issued a\r\n    preliminary report in the summer of 1855, and a final one in\r\n    January 1856, which was presented to Parliament. The officers\r\n    specially censured were Lord Lucan (who had been given the\r\n    command of a Regiment), Lord Cardigan, Inspector of Cavalry,\r\n    Sir Richard Airey, Quartermaster-General, and Colonel Gordon,\r\n    Deputy Quartermaster-General. Lord Panmure wrote on the 17th\r\n    of February that the Government recommended the appointment\r\n    of a Commission of Enquiry, consisting of General Sir Howard\r\n    Douglas and six other high military officers. The Commission\r\n    sat at Chelsea, and made its report in July, exonerating the\r\n    officers censured.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: The Convention of Cintra was concluded on\r\n    the 30th of August 1808. It was founded on the basis of an\r\n    armistice agreed upon between Sir Arthur Wellesley and General\r\n    Kellerman, on the day after the battle of Vimiera, and some of\r\n    its provisions were considered too favourable to the French. A\r\n    Board of Enquiry, under the presidency of Sir David Dundas,\r\n    in the first instance exculpated the British officers; but the\r\n    Government having instructed the members of the Board to give\r\n    their opinions individually, four were found to approve and\r\n    three to disapprove the armistice and convention.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR'S CORDIALITY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPARIS, _18th February 1856_.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and humbly\r\nbegs to say that he dined last night at the Tuileries, and had a\r\nconversation of two hours with the Emperor, which was in all respects\r\nsatisfactory. On no occasion has Lord Clarendon heard the Emperor\r\nexpress himself more warmly or with greater determination in favour\r\nof the Alliance, and H.M. entirely concurred with Lord Clarendon, that\r\nupon the perfect understanding between the two Governments, and the\r\nconviction on the part of others that the Alliance was not to be\r\nshaken, depended the facility with which negotiations might be\r\nconducted, and the terms on which peace would be made. Lord Clarendon\r\nspoke with the utmost frankness about the flattery that had been\r\nand would continue to be addressed to His Majesty, and the contrast\r\nperpetually drawn between England and France, to the disparagement of\r\nthe former, for the purpose of disturbing the relations between them;\r\nbut that your Majesty and your Majesty's Government had always treated\r\nthese tricks with contempt, because the confidence in the Emperor's\r\nhonour and loyalty was complete. Lord Clarendon dwelt particularly\r\nupon the feelings of your Majesty and of the Prince on this subject,\r\nand the pleasure it gave the Emperor was evident; and he desired Lord\r\nClarendon to say that your Majesty should never find such confidence\r\nmisplaced.\r\n\r\nHe promised Lord Clarendon that he would give Baron Brunnow and\r\nCount Buol to understand that if they thought the Alliance could be\r\ndisturbed by them they would find themselves grievously mistaken, and\r\nthat it would be waste of time to try and alter any conditions upon\r\nwhich he had agreed with the English Government.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor appeared to be much gratified by your Majesty's letter,\r\nfor the first thing he said to Lord Clarendon on coming into the room\r\nbefore dinner was \"_quelle charmante lettre vous m'avez apportée de\r\nla Reine_,\" and then began upon the extraordinary clearness with which\r\nyour Majesty treated all matters of business, and the pleasure he\r\nderived from every discussion of them with your Majesty....\r\n\r\nThe Empress was looking in great health and beauty. She was in the\r\nhighest spirits, and full of affectionate enquiry for your Majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: OUDH]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING'S APPEAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marquis of Dalhousie to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCALCUTTA, _19th February 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General presents his most humble duty to your Majesty,\r\nand has the honour of submitting to your Majesty a copy of a\r\nProclamation, whereby the Kingdom of Oudh has been placed exclusively\r\nand permanently under the authority of your Majesty's Government.[14]\r\n\r\nThe various considerations, and the course of public events, which\r\nled to this necessity, have long since been laid before your Majesty's\r\nGovernment in great detail.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General during the past summer communicated to the Home\r\nAuthorities his readiness to remain in India as long as he dared,\r\nnamely, for one additional month, until the 1st of March, for the\r\npurpose of carrying into effect the proposed policy regarding Oudh--if\r\nit was desired that he should do so.\r\n\r\nThe orders from the Home Government reached the Governor-General only\r\nupon the 2nd of January, leaving barely two months for the assembling\r\nof the military force which was necessary to provide against all\r\nrisks--for the negotiations with the King--and for the organisation of\r\nthe future Civil and Military Administration of Oudh.\r\n\r\nEvery preparation having been completed, the Resident at Lucknow\r\nwaited upon the King in person--communicated to him the resolution\r\nwhich the British Government had taken--and tendered for his\r\nacceptance a new Treaty, whereby the transfer of the Government of\r\nOudh would have been made a matter of amicable agreement.\r\n\r\nThe King wholly refused to sign any Treaty. He declared himself ready\r\nto submit to the will of the British Government in all things. He bade\r\nthe Resident observe that every mark of power had already been laid\r\ndown by His Majesty's own orders--the guns at the palace gates were\r\ndismounted, the guards bore no arms, and, though drawn up as usual in\r\nthe Court, they saluted the Resident with their hands only; while not\r\na weapon was worn by any officer in the Palace.\r\n\r\nThe King gave way to passionate bursts of grief and anger--implored\r\nthe intercession of the Resident in his behalf--and finally,\r\nuncovering his head, he placed his turban in the Resident's hands.\r\nThis act--the deepest mark of humiliation and helplessness which a\r\nnative of the East can exhibit--became doubly touching and significant\r\nwhen the head thus bared in supplication was one that had worn a royal\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, had already borne too long with the wrongs\r\ninflicted by the sovereigns of Oudh upon their unhappy subjects. The\r\nclamorous grief of the King could not be allowed to shut out the cry\r\nof his people's misery. The King's appeal, therefore, could not be\r\nlistened to; and as His Majesty, at the end of the three days' space\r\nwhich was allowed him for deliberation, still resolutely refused to\r\nsign a Treaty, the territory of Oudh was taken possession of, by the\r\nissue of the Proclamation which has now been respectfully submitted to\r\nyour Majesty.\r\n\r\nIt is the fourth kingdom in India which has passed under your\r\nMajesty's sceptre during the last eight years.[15]\r\n\r\nPerfect tranquillity has prevailed in Oudh since the event which\r\nhas just been narrated. General Outram writes that the populace of\r\nLucknow, more interested than any other community in the maintenance\r\nof the native dynasty, already \"appear to have forgotten they ever had\r\na King.\" In the districts the Proclamation has been heartily welcomed\r\nby the middle and lower classes; while even the higher orders, who of\r\ncourse lose much in a native state by the cessation of corruption and\r\ntyranny, have shown no symptoms of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThere seems every reason to hope and expect that the same complete\r\ntranquillity will attend the further progress of our arrangements for\r\nthe future administration of Oudh....\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General has only further to report to your Majesty that\r\nLord Canning arrived at Madras on the 14th inst., and that he will\r\nassume the Government of India on the last day of this month.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General will report hereafter Lord Canning's arrival at\r\nFort William; and he has now the honour to subscribe himself, your\r\nMajesty's most obedient, most humble and devoted Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nDALHOUSIE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: In a letter of the 13th, Mr Vernon Smith had\r\n    told the Queen that the Press rumours of \"annexation\" were\r\n    premature, and that the use of the word itself had been\r\n    avoided in Lord Canning's correspondence with the Court of\r\n    Directors.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: The earlier annexations were those of the Punjab\r\n    (1849), Pegu (1852), and Nagpur (1853); some minor additions\r\n    were also made under what was called the \"doctrine of lapse.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRELIMINARIES OF PEACE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _27th February 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns Lord Clarendon's letter.\r\n\r\nThe matter becomes very serious, and it would be a bad position for\r\nus to be left quite alone in the Conference, which the Russians, the\r\nQueen has every reason to believe, are anxiously striving to bring\r\nabout. In fact, well-informed persons pretend that this was the main\r\naim of Russia in accepting the Austrian ultimatum and going to Paris.\r\n\r\nWould it not answer to take this line: to say to Russia, \"You have\r\naccepted the ultimatum, _pur et simple_, and have now again recognised\r\nits stipulations as preliminaries of peace. You will, therefore, first\r\nof all, have to execute them; you may then come to the question of\r\nKars and say you mean to keep it--then you will see that Europe, bound\r\nto maintain the integrity of Turkey, will be obliged to go on with\r\nthe war, and it will be for you to consider whether you mean to go on\r\nfighting for Kars; but at present this is not in question, as you are\r\nonly called upon to fulfil the engagements to which you have solemnly\r\npledged yourself\"?\r\n\r\nPerhaps Lord Palmerston will discuss this suggestion with his\r\ncolleagues to-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _27th February 1856_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that as the result of the deliberations of the Cabinet this\r\nevening, the accompanying telegraphic message is proposed to be sent\r\nto-morrow morning to Lord Clarendon.

In an hour's time he will have assumed the\r\nGovernment of India. Lord Dalhousie will transfer it to him in a\r\nstate of perfect tranquillity. There is peace, within and without. And\r\nalthough no prudent man will ever venture to predict the certainty\r\nof continued peace in India, yet Lord Dalhousie is able to declare,\r\nwithin reservation, that he knows of no quarter in which it is\r\nprobable that trouble will arise.[16]\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie desires that his very last act, as Governor-General,\r\nshould be to submit to your Majesty a respectful expression of the\r\ndeep sense he entertains of your Majesty's constant approbation of\r\nhis public conduct while he has held the office of Governor-General\r\nof India; together with a humble assurance of the heartfelt gratitude\r\nwith which he shall ever remember your Majesty's gracious favour\r\ntowards him through the eight long years during which he has borne the\r\nponderous burden he lays down to-day.\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie begs permission to take leave of your Majesty, and has\r\nthe honour to subscribe himself, with deep devotion, your Majesty's\r\nmost obedient, most humble and faithful Subject and Servant,\r\n\r\nDALHOUSIE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: It has been, however, freely alleged that the\r\n    failure to repress acts of insubordination in the administration\r\n    of Lord Dalhousie was a contributory, if not the direct, cause\r\n    of the events of 1857.

March_] _1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns these letters to Lord Palmerston. She entirely\r\nconcurs in Lord Palmerston's general views of the question, but at the\r\nsame time she thinks--as circumstances, which are beyond our control,\r\nmay so vary from day to day or even from hour to hour--that Lord\r\nClarendon should receive full powers to act according to what may\r\nappear to him to be best and wisest at the time, even if it should not\r\nbe in strict accordance with what we originally contemplated and must\r\nnaturally wish. Such a power would certainly not be misplaced in Lord\r\nClarendon's hands; his firmness, and his sense of what this country\r\nexpects, are too well known to lead us to doubt of his permitting\r\nanything but what would _really_ be for the best of this country, and\r\nfor the maintenance of the Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _6th March 1856_.\r\n\r\nWith reference to Lord Clarendon's letter, the Queen must say that\r\nshe, though _very reluctantly_, shares his opinion, that we have no\r\nchoice _now_ but to accept the peace, even if it is not all we could\r\ndesire, and if another campaign might have got us better terms. She\r\nfeels certain that the bad accounts of the French Army in the Crimea,\r\nwhich appears to suffer _now_ all the misery which ours suffered last\r\nyear at the worst time of the siege, will more than ever indispose the\r\nEmperor from risking a renewal of hostilities. It is affirmed that the\r\nFrench have beyond 20,000 men in hospital!\r\n\r\nIf we are to have this peace, however, the Queen must again agree with\r\nLord Clarendon that we ought not _ourselves_ to depreciate it, as our\r\nPress has done the deeds of our Army.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the principalities, it is the Queen's opinion that\r\nnothing will oppose a barrier to Russia and her intrigues but\r\nthe arrangement which will satisfy the people themselves, viz. an\r\n_hereditary monarchy_. The example of Egypt might perfectly well be\r\nfollowed in Wallachia and Moldavia.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Poland would, in the Queen's opinion, be much better\r\nleft unintroduced into the present negotiations; we have no claim\r\narising out of this war to ask Russia to make concessions on that\r\nhead, which, moreover, would be treated by her as an internal question\r\nnot admitting of foreign interference.\r\n\r\nThe clause in the Treaty of Vienna about the Bonapartes is a dead\r\nletter, as this very Treaty, now to be signed, will prove, and the\r\nEmperor would act very unwisely to call for an alteration in which all\r\nPowers who signed the original Treaty would claim to be consulted. We\r\nhave every interest not to bring about a European Congress _pour la\r\nRévision des Traités_, which many people suspect the Emperor wishes to\r\nturn the present Conference into.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes only to add that, should Prussia be asked to join in\r\nthe final Treaty on the ground of her having been a party to the July\r\nTreaty, we should take care that it does not appear that this was\r\nan act of courtesy of all the other Powers towards Prussia except\r\nEngland, who need not be made to take additional unpopularity in\r\nGermany upon herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPARIS, _18th March 1856._\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and humbly\r\nbegs to say that the Emperor gave him to-day the most satisfactory\r\nreport of the Empress and the young Prince.[17] There appears to be\r\nlittle or no fever now, and a great power of sleeping. The Emperor's\r\neyes filled with tears when he described the tortures of the Empress\r\nand his own sensations. He said he hardly knew how to express his\r\ngratitude for the interest which your Majesty had manifested for the\r\nEmpress, and for the letters which he had received from your Majesty\r\nand the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Plenipotentiaries[18] were admitted at the close of the\r\nConference this afternoon--all important matters under negotiation\r\nhaving been concluded.\r\n\r\nCount Walewski made an ineffectual attempt to make it appear by a\r\ndoubtful form of expression that Prussia had taken part throughout in\r\nthe negotiations. Lord Cowley and Lord Clarendon said that they wished\r\nto show all courtesy to Prussia, but could not consent to sign what\r\nwas manifestly untrue....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The Prince Imperial, Napoléon Eugène Louis Jean\r\n    Joseph, was born on the 16th of March.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Baron Manteuffel and Count Hatzfeldt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE PRINCESS ROYAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from Mr Cobden to a Friend._[19]\r\n\r\nMIDHURST, _20th March 1856._\r\n\r\n... It is generally thought that the young Prince Frederic William\r\nof Prussia is to be married to our Princess Royal. I was dining\r\n_tête-à-tête_ with Mr Buchanan, the American Minister, a few days ago,\r\nwho had dined the day before at the Queen's table, and sat next to\r\nthe Princess Royal. He was in raptures about her, and said she was\r\nthe most charming girl he had ever met: \"All life and spirit, full\r\nof frolic and fun, with an excellent head, and a _heart as big as\r\na mountain_\"--those were his words. Another friend of mine, Colonel\r\nFitzmayer, dined with the Queen last week, and in writing to me a\r\ndescription of the company, he says, that when the Princess Royal\r\nsmiles, \"it makes one feel as if additional light were thrown upon the\r\nscene.\" So I should judge that this said Prince is a lucky fellow, and\r\nI trust he will make a good husband. If not, although a man of peace,\r\nI shall consider it a _casus belli_....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Submitted to the Queen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPARIS, _29th March 1856._\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and humbly\r\nbegs to say that the Emperor sent General Ney to him this morning to\r\nrequest that Lord Clarendon would convey the cordial thanks of the\r\nEmperor to your Majesty for the _feu de joie_ fired by your Majesty's\r\ntroops in the Crimea upon the announcement of the birth of the Prince\r\nImperial.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon was much embarrassed by a letter this morning from\r\nLord Palmerston, desiring that the signature of the Treaty should be\r\npostponed till Monday, in case the Cabinet should have any amendments\r\nto propose; and Lord Clarendon humbly hopes that your Majesty may not\r\nbe displeased at his not having acted upon this injunction, because\r\nhe had promised to sign the Treaty to-morrow in accordance with the\r\ngeneral wish of the Congress, notwithstanding that it was Sunday, and\r\nhe could not therefore go back from his engagement--every preparation\r\nis made for illuminations, not alone at Paris, but throughout France,\r\nas all the Prefects have been informed of the signature--the odium\r\nthat would have fallen [on] us all would have been extreme throughout\r\nEurope it may be said, and it would have been regarded as a last\r\nproof of our unwillingness to make peace. The friendly feeling of the\r\nCongress towards the English P.P.'s[20] would have changed, and they\r\nprobably would have agreed to no amendments, requiring that all\r\nthe seven copies of the Treaty should be recopied. In short, Lord\r\nClarendon felt that he had no choice but to take upon himself the\r\nresponsibility of signing to-morrow; but he has suggested that Lord\r\nPalmerston's private letter should be converted into a despatch,\r\nin order that the sole and entire blame should rest with Lord\r\nClarendon....[21]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: _I.e._, Plenipotentiaries.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: For the chief stipulations of the Treaty, see\r\n    _ante_, Introductory Note to Chapter XXV.

Greater\r\nand more brilliant successes by land and sea might probably have been\r\naccomplished by the Allies if the war had continued, but any great\r\nand important additional security against future aggressions by Russia\r\ncould only have been obtained by severing from Russia large portions\r\nof her frontier territory, such as Finland, Poland, and Georgia; and\r\nalthough by great military and financial efforts and sacrifices those\r\nterritories might for a time have been occupied, Russia must have been\r\nreduced to the lowest state of internal distress, before her Emperor\r\ncould have been brought to put his name to a Treaty of Peace finally\r\nsurrendering his sovereignty over those extensive countries; and\r\nto have continued the war long enough for these purposes would have\r\nrequired greater endurance than was possessed by your Majesty's\r\nAllies, and might possibly have exhausted the good-will of your\r\nMajesty's own subjects....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE TREATY OF PARIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPARIS, _30th March 1856._\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and humbly\r\nbegs to congratulate your Majesty upon the signature of peace this\r\nafternoon. It is not to be doubted that another campaign must have\r\nbrought glory to your Majesty's arms, and would have enabled England\r\nto impose different terms upon Russia, but setting aside the cost and\r\nthe horrors of war, in themselves evils of the greatest magnitude,\r\nwe cannot feel sure that victory might not have been purchased too\r\ndearly--a continuation of the war would hardly have been possible\r\neither with or without France--if we had dragged her on with us it\r\nwould have been most reluctantly on her part, her finances would have\r\nsuffered still more, she would have borne us ill-will, would have\r\nacted feebly with us, and would on the first favourable occasion\r\nhave left us in the lurch. If we had continued the war single-handed,\r\nFrance would feel that she had behaved shabbily to us, and would\r\n_therefore_ have hated us all the more, and become our enemy sooner\r\nthan under any other circumstances; a coalition of Europe might then\r\nhave taken place against England, to which the United States would\r\nbut too gladly have adhered, and the consequence might have been most\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon would not make such an assertion lightly, but he feels\r\nconvinced that your Majesty may feel satisfied with the position now\r\noccupied by England--six weeks ago it was a painful position here,\r\neverybody was against us, our motives were suspected, and our policy\r\nwas denounced; but the universal feeling now is that we are the only\r\ncountry able and ready, and willing, if necessary, to continue the\r\nwar; that we might have prevented peace, but that having announced\r\nour readiness to make peace on honourable terms we have honestly and\r\nunselfishly acted up to our word. It is well known, too, that the\r\nconditions on which peace is made would have been different if England\r\nhad not been firm, and everybody is, of course, glad _even here_ that\r\npeace should not have brought dishonour to France.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon, therefore, ventures to hope that the language\r\nin England with respect to the peace will not be apologetic or\r\ndissatisfied. It would be unwise and undignified, and would invite\r\ncriticism if such language were held before the conditions are\r\npublicly known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: END OF THE WAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st March 1856._\r\n\r\nThe Queen thanks Lord Clarendon much for his two letters of Saturday\r\nand yesterday; and we congratulate _him_ on the success of his\r\n_efforts_ in obtaining the Peace, for to him _alone_ it is due, and\r\nalso _to him alone_ is due the dignified position which the Queen's\r\nbeloved country holds, and which she owes to a straightforward,\r\nsteady, and unselfish policy throughout.\r\n\r\nMuch as the Queen disliked the idea of _Peace_, she has become\r\nreconciled to it, by the conviction that France would either not have\r\ncontinued the war, or continued it in such a manner that _no_ glory\r\ncould have been hoped for for us.\r\n\r\nWe have a striking proof of this in Pélissier not having obeyed the\r\nEmperor's orders and never having thought of occupying Sak.[22] _This\r\nreally might_ be hinted to the Emperor....\r\n\r\nThe Queen finds Lord Palmerston very well pleased with the Peace,\r\nthough he struggled as long as he could for better conditions....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: The word is so written in the original draft.\r\n    There was a place of the name near Old Fort in the Crimea,\r\n    but this is more probably an abbreviation for Sakatal in\r\n    Caucasia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _1st April 1856_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--... _Peace is signed!_ But till the ratifications\r\nhave taken place its terms cannot be known.

It ought\r\nto be a man of higher position and standing, and who could represent\r\nhis Sovereign adequately....\r\n\r\nShe wishes further to observe that Mr Labouchere should in future take\r\ncare that, while he tries to ascertain the feelings of people as to\r\ntheir accepting the offer of a Colonial appointment, before he submits\r\nthem to the Queen, that these enquiries should be made in such a\r\nmanner as not to lead these persons to _expect_ the appointment,\r\nelse, if the _Queen_ does not approve of them, the whole odium of the\r\nrefusal will fall upon her. The best way, and the way in which similar\r\nappointments are conducted in the other Offices, would be to mention\r\nthe names first to the Queen, and if she approves of them, to\r\nascertain the feelings of the respective candidates.

Now that\r\nself-Government has been established in the Colonies, the person of\r\nthe Governor is the only connection remaining with the Mother Country;\r\nand if the Government were once filled from among the public men in\r\nthe Colonies, this would become a precedent most difficult to break\r\nthrough again, and possibly paving the way for total separation.[28]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: Sir Henry Bulwer declined.

Wood for his long and clear statement\r\nas to the present position of the Naval Force, which she quite\r\nunderstands. She attaches the greatest importance to perfect faith\r\nbeing kept with the sailors, and on that account was distressed to\r\nhear of the misapprehension at Portsmouth the other day.\r\n\r\nA good system for a Naval Reserve would be most important. The Queen\r\nthinks a Commission, composed chiefly of _younger officers_ still\r\nconversant with the _present_ feelings of our sailors, would best be\r\nable to advise on the subject; the old Admirals are always and not\r\nunnaturally somewhat behind their time.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the policy of not too rapidly reducing our naval\r\narmaments, Sir C. Wood only anticipates the Queen's most anxious wish\r\non this subject, for we cannot tell what may not happen anywhere at\r\nany moment; our relations with America are very unsettled, and our\r\nAlliance with France _depends_ upon the life of one man. And it\r\nis best to be prepared, for else you excite suspicion if you have\r\nsuddenly to make preparations without being _able_ to state for what\r\nthey are intended.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Sailors' Homes, the Queen concurs in the advantage\r\nof leaving them to private management; but the Government, having so\r\nlarge a stake in the sailors' welfare, would act wisely and justly to\r\nmake a handsome donation to all of them at the present moment, taking\r\ncare that this should be used by the different establishments for\r\ntheir permanent extension. Five thousand pounds amongst them would\r\nbe by no means an unreasonable sum to give as a token of the interest\r\ntaken in the well-being of these brave men when no immediate return in\r\nshape of service was expected for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _21st May 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is very anxious about the fixing of our Peace establishment\r\nboth for the Army and Navy. Although Lord Hardinge's proposals are\r\nbefore the Government already for some time, no proposal has yet been\r\nsubmitted to the Queen; and on enquiry from Sir C. Wood, he stated\r\nbut two days ago that no reduction of the Navy was yet settled. On\r\nthe other hand, the Queen sees from the Chancellor of the Exchequer's\r\nspeech that he specifies the sums by which both Army and Navy\r\nestimates are to be reduced. This _prejudges_ the whole question,\r\nand will deprive the Government of all power freely to consider\r\nthese important questions. The Queen was, moreover, sorry to find\r\nMr Disraeli, Mr Gladstone, and Sir Francis Baring agreeing with the\r\ndoctrine of the _Times_ and Lord Grey that we ought _not_ to improve\r\nour state of preparation for war; and if we had been better prepared\r\nfor the late war, we should have been still more disappointed.[29]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: In the course of an elaborate reply, Lord\r\n    Palmerston stated that the country had never been in a better\r\n    condition of defence than at the present time, but he insisted\r\n    that the Militia, which from 1815 to 1832 had been allowed\r\n    to become extinct, must be maintained in an efficient\r\n    state--120,000 strong.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: TITLE OF PRINCE CONSORT]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PRECEDENCE OF PRINCE ALBERT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _May 1856_.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange omission in our Constitution that while _the wife_\r\nof a _King_ has the highest rank and dignity in the realm after her\r\nhusband assigned to her by law, the _husband_ of a _Queen regnant_\r\nis entirely ignored by the law. This is the more extraordinary, as\r\na husband has in this country such particular rights and such great\r\npower over his wife, and as the Queen is married just as any other\r\nwoman is, and swears to obey her lord and master, as such, while by\r\nlaw he has no rank or defined position. This is a strange anomaly.\r\nNo doubt, as is the case _now_--the Queen _can_ give her husband the\r\nhighest _place_ by _placing_ him _always near her person_, and the\r\nNation would give it him as a _matter of course_. Still, when I first\r\nmarried, we had much difficulty on this subject; much bad feeling was\r\nshown, and several members of the Royal Family showed bad grace\r\nin giving precedence to the Prince, and the late King of Hanover\r\npositively resisted doing so. I gave the Prince precedence by issuing\r\nLetters Patent, but these give no rank in Parliament--or at the\r\nCouncil Board--and it would be far better to put this question beyond\r\nall doubt, and to secure its settlement for _all future Consorts of\r\nQueens_, and thus have this omission in the Constitution rectified.\r\nNaturally my own feeling would be to give the Prince the same title\r\nand rank as I have, but a Titular King is a complete novelty in\r\nthis country, and might be productive of more inconveniences than\r\nadvantages to the individual who bears it. Therefore, upon mature\r\nreflection, and after considering the question for nearly _sixteen\r\nyears_, I have come to the conclusion that the title which is now by\r\nuniversal consent given him of \"Prince Consort,\" with the highest rank\r\nin and out of Parliament immediately after the Queen, and before every\r\nother Prince of the Royal Family, should be the one assigned to the\r\nhusband of the Queen regnant _once and for all_. This ought to be done\r\nbefore our children grow up, and it seems peculiarly easy to do so\r\n_now_ that none of the old branches of the Royal Family are still\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nThe present position is this: that while every British subject, down\r\nto the Knight, Bachelor, Doctor, and Esquire, has a rank and position\r\nby _Law_, the Queen's husband alone has one by _favour_--and by his\r\nwife's favour, who may grant it or not! When granted as in the present\r\ncase, it does not extend to Parliament and the Council, and the\r\nchildren may deny the position which their mother has given to their\r\nfather as a usurpation over them, having the law on their side; or if\r\nthey waive their rights in his favour, he will hold a position granted\r\nby the forbearance of his children. In both cases this is a position\r\nmost derogatory to the Queen as well as to her husband, and most\r\ndangerous to the peace and well-being of her family. If the children\r\nresist, the Queen will have her husband pushed away from her side by\r\nher children, and they will take precedence over the man whom she is\r\nbound to obey; if they are dutiful, she will owe her peace of mind to\r\ntheir continued generosity.\r\n\r\nWith relation to Foreign Courts, the Queen's position is equally\r\nhumiliating in this respect. _Some_ Sovereigns (crowned heads) address\r\nher husband as \"Brother,\" some as \"Brother and Cousin,\" some merely as\r\n\"Cousin.\" When the Queen has been abroad, her husband's position has\r\nalways been a subject of negotiation and vexation; the position which\r\nhas been accorded to him the Queen has always had to acknowledge as\r\na grace and favour bestowed on her by the Sovereign whom she visited.\r\nWhile last year the Emperor of the French treated the Prince as a\r\nRoyal personage, his uncle declined to come to Paris avowedly because\r\nhe would not give precedence to the Prince; and on the Rhine in 1845\r\nthe King of Prussia could not give the place to the Queen's husband\r\nwhich common civility required, because of the presence of an\r\nArchduke, the third son of an uncle of the then reigning Emperor of\r\nAustria, who would not give the _pas_, and whom the King would not\r\noffend.\r\n\r\nThe only legal position in Europe, according to international law,\r\nwhich the husband of the Queen of England enjoys, is that of a younger\r\nbrother of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, and this merely because the\r\nEnglish law does not know of him. This is derogatory to the dignity of\r\nthe Crown of England.\r\n\r\nBut _nationally_ also it is an injury to the position of the Crown\r\nthat the Queen's husband should have no other title than that of\r\nPrince of Saxe-Coburg, and thus be perpetually represented to the\r\ncountry as a foreigner. \"The Queen and her foreign husband, the Prince\r\nAlbert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha!\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen has a right to claim that her husband should be an\r\nEnglishman, bearing an English title, and enjoying a legal position\r\nwhich she has not to defend with a wife's anxiety as a usurpation\r\nagainst her own children, her subjects, and Foreign Courts.\r\n\r\nThe question has often been discussed by me with different Prime\r\nMinisters and Lord Chancellors, who have invariably entirely agreed\r\nwith me; but the wish to wait for a good moment to bring the matter\r\nbefore Parliament has caused one year after another to elapse without\r\nanything being done. If I become _now_ more anxious to have it\r\nsettled, it is in order that it should be so before our children are\r\ngrown up, that it might not appear to be done in order to guard their\r\nfather's position against them personally, which could not fail to\r\nproduce a painful impression upon their minds.\r\n\r\nIf properly explained to Parliament and the country, I cannot foresee\r\nthe slightest difficulty in getting such a necessary measure passed,\r\nparticularly if it be made quite clear to the House of Commons that it\r\nis in no way connected with a desire to obtain an increased grant for\r\nthe Prince.[30]\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: See _post_, 28th June, 1856, note 33.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SABBATARIANISM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Hardinge._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st June 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen understands that there is an attempt to be made to prevent\r\nthe military bands from playing when the Troops march to church on a\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nShe is anxious to express to Lord Hardinge her very strong feeling on\r\nthis subject, and her wish that he should on _no_ account give way\r\nto such a proposal. _Whatever_ has been the custom should be firmly\r\nadhered to, and Lord Hardinge is perfectly at liberty to make use of\r\nthe Queen's name, and say he could not bring such a proposal before\r\nher, as he knew she would not consent to it.[31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: The custom of bands playing in the public parks\r\n    on Sundays had been objected to by various religious bodies,\r\n    and in April a letter on the subject was written to Lord\r\n    Palmerston by the Archbishop of Canterbury, after which the\r\n    performances were discontinued, the Government giving way\r\n    before the threat of a vote of censure.

Your kind _question_ puts me into\r\nconsiderable perplexity, and I think I cannot do better than by\r\nputting you in full possession of the state of the case.\r\n\r\nOur house is very full--and it is _possible_ that we may have very\r\nshortly the visit of Prince Oscar of Sweden. These Princes have very\r\nlarge _suites_, and I should therefore in such a case be totally\r\nunable to lodge you and _them_. But there is another reason. While\r\nFritz Wilhelm is here, _every_ spare moment Vicky has (and _I_ have,\r\nfor I must chaperon this loving couple--which takes away so much of my\r\nprecious time) is devoted to her bridegroom, who is _so_ much in\r\nlove, that, even if he is out driving and walking with her, he is not\r\nsatisfied, and says he has not seen her, unless he can have her for an\r\nhour to himself, when I am naturally bound to be acting as chaperon.\r\nUnder these circumstances I may truly say that dear Charlotte would\r\nhave very little enjoyment; she would see very little of Vicky, _I\r\ncould not_ take care of her, and I fear it would be anything but\r\nagreeable for her. Fritz Wilhelm would besides be miserable if I took\r\nVicky more away from him than I already do, and therefore _while he_\r\nis here, it would _not_, I think, be advisable that _Charlotte_ should\r\ncome. Could you _not_ come a little in August when the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Prussia have left us? Or would you prefer coming in\r\nOctober, when we return from Scotland? You will easily believe,\r\ndearest Uncle, _what_ pleasure it gives me to see you; but I know you\r\nwill understand the reasons I here give for begging you to delay this\r\ndear visit either to August or October....\r\n\r\nI had a little hope that the Archduke and Charlotte _might_ take a\r\nmutual liking; it would be such a good _parti_.\r\n\r\nWe had an interesting ceremony yesterday, the laying of the first\r\nstone of the Wellington College--which is the monument to the memory\r\nof the dear old Duke. Dear little Arthur appeared for the first time\r\nin public, and I hope you will approve my answer.[32]\r\n\r\nNow, dearest Uncle, ever your truly devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: The Queen's reply to an address presented to\r\n    her, on behalf of the College, by Lord Derby.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NATIONAL GALLERY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th June 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen and Prince had intended to take their visitors down to\r\nthe Camp on Monday next--the _only day_ which we shall have for\r\na fortnight free from other engagements--and hears, to her _utter\r\nastonishment_, that _all_ the troops are gone--not only the Militia,\r\nbut the 3rd Battalion of the Rifles!--and this without the Queen's\r\nhearing _one_ word of it! The Queen is the more astonished and\r\nannoyed, as Lord Panmure had promised that the Militia regiments\r\nshould _not_ be disembodied until there were other troops to replace\r\nthem, which will not be the case for some little time. _What_ is the\r\ncause of this, sudden determination? The Queen is much vexed, as her\r\nvisitors will not stay long, and are very anxious to visit the Camp;\r\nand it is of much importance that Foreign Princes should see what we\r\nhave, and in what state of efficiency our troops are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _26th June 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes Lord Palmerston will make it quite clear to the\r\nsubordinate Members of the Government that they cannot be allowed\r\nto vote against the Government proposal about the National Gallery\r\nto-morrow, as she hears that several fancy themselves at liberty to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: TITLE OF PRINCE CONSORT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._[33]\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _28th June 1856_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty ... will be prepared, as well as Lord\r\nLyndhurst, to give his cordial support to such a Bill as that sketched\r\nout by the Lord Chancellor; but using that freedom which is invited by\r\nand due to the gracious confidence reposed in him by your Majesty, he\r\nhopes he may be pardoned for earnestly submitting to your Majesty's\r\nserious consideration the question whether it may be expedient to\r\nraise a discussion on such a subject during the short remainder of the\r\npresent Session of Parliament. Measures of public importance already\r\nin progress are now beginning to be abandoned in consequence of\r\nthe advanced period of the Session, and Lord Lyndhurst concurs very\r\nstrongly in Lord Derby's apprehensions as to the result on public\r\nfeeling of the introduction of such a measure at the present moment.\r\nIf it could be stated that your Majesty contemplated a foreign visit\r\nin the course of the summer, which rendered it desirable that a\r\nmeasure should be passed to obviate the embarrassment which had been\r\ncreated on previous occasions of the same sort, some case might be\r\nmade out for immediate legislation, though even then the question\r\nwould arise why it was not thought of sooner; but in the absence of\r\nany change of circumstances, and in the present unfortunate temper of\r\nthe House of Commons, of which a proof was given last night, such\r\na course would probably lead to suspicions and remarks of the most\r\npainful character. It would be said, and with some justice, that the\r\ngreater the constitutional importance of a settlement, the greater was\r\nalso the necessity of ample opportunity for consideration being given\r\nto Parliament; and the hurry of passing the Bill would be cited as a\r\nproof that it covered some unavowed and objectionable design. If such\r\nsuspicions should lead to the postponement of the measure, not only\r\nwould the Crown have been subjected to a mortifying defeat, but the\r\nBill would be open to the hostile criticisms of the Press during the\r\nwhole summer and autumn, the effect of which might even endanger its\r\nultimate success....\r\n\r\nShould your Majesty be otherwise advised, Lord Derby will be ready to\r\ngive the Bill his personal support, but he would be wanting in candour\r\nif he did not frankly state to your Majesty the serious apprehensions\r\nwhich he should entertain as to the result. Such an unreserved\r\nexpression of his opinions is the only and very inadequate return\r\nwhich he can make to your Majesty for the gracious confidence with\r\nwhich your Majesty has honoured him, and for which he feels most\r\ndeeply grateful.\r\n\r\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant\r\nand Subject,\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: The Queen had sent to Lord Derby a copy of her\r\n    Memorandum, _ante_, May, 1856, a letter from Lord Palmerston to\r\n    herself on the same subject, and the sketch of a Bill drawn\r\n    up by the Lord Chancellor to give effect to her wishes.

Mr Labouchere begs to\r\nsubmit the following observations in reply to Her Majesty's enquiries\r\nrespecting the Free States in the vicinity of the British Colonies in\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nThere are two independent States there:--\r\n\r\n(1.) The Transvaal Republic, founded by Boers who left the Colony for\r\nthe most part from ten to fifteen years ago. The territory on which\r\nthey are established never was British. The Government of the day,\r\nthinking it useless and impolitic to pursue them there, entered into\r\na capitulation with them and recognised their independent existence.\r\nThey inhabit the plains north of the Vaal or Yellow River.\r\n\r\n(2.) The Orange River Free State. This occupies the territory between\r\nthe Vaal River to the north and the Orange River to the south. This\r\nterritory, like the former, was occupied originally by emigrant Boers,\r\nand was beyond the boundaries of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nBut Sir Harry Smith, in 1849, after a severe military struggle with\r\nthe Boers, thought proper without authority from home to annex it to\r\nBritish Dominion.[37] This annexation was ratified by Lord Grey,\r\nand the country remained for three or four years under British rule.\r\nAfterwards it was resolved to abandon it, during the administration\r\nof the Duke of Newcastle, as a result of the general revision of our\r\naffairs which took place at the conclusion of the Kaffir War. The\r\nOrange River Territory was recognised as a separate Republic in 1854.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that the existence of these Free States may\r\ncomplicate our relations with the Kaffirs, and possibly be a source\r\nof danger to the security of British dominion in South Africa. But the\r\nlatter danger seems very remote. They possess _no_ portion of the\r\nsea coast, and are altogether a pastoral people, and are engaged in a\r\nconstant struggle with the barbarous tribes in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nTo retain and protect these territories would have involved an immense\r\nexpenditure, and been attended with great difficulties. Besides, the\r\nsame question would have speedily recurred, as these emigrant Boers\r\nwould have soon gone further into the interior, and again have\r\nasserted their independence. Our present relations with both these\r\nStates are very amicable. When Governor Sir George Grey went to the\r\nCape all these questions had been finally disposed of.[38]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be good reason to hope that the apprehensions of a\r\nKaffir War will not be realised. The Colony is very prosperous, and\r\nis beginning to export wool in large quantities. The new legislature\r\nappears to be disposed to act harmoniously with the Governor, and to\r\nbe actuated by a spirit of loyalty and attachment to this country.\r\nWhat they most want is a supply of European settlers, which it is to\r\nbe hoped that the soldiers of the German and Swiss Legions will give\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: See _ante_, vol. ii., Introductory Note to Chapter\r\n    XVII, and 25th October, 1848, note 45.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Sir George Grey had been sent out by the Duke\r\n    of Newcastle in 1854.

I quite overlooked _one_ very important\r\ncase of very late date, viz. the Plenipotentiary at Paris--on whom the\r\nEmperor pressed very hard to confer his order in commemoration of the\r\nPeace; but it was refused, and the Emperor was a good _deal hurt_. If\r\n_now_ Lord Westmorland received the permission, the Emperor might with\r\n_right_ complain. I am much grieved, dearest Uncle, at all this, but\r\nit was quite unavoidable, and I was at the time much distressed at\r\nyour giving the order to Lord Westmorland as I foresaw nothing but\r\ndifficulties. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: King Leopold had proposed to bestow a decoration\r\n    on Lord Westmorland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _1st August 1856_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... When your excellent Ministers will consider\r\nthings coolly, which is not to be expected in this hot weather, I am\r\nsure they will come to other conclusions. The rule is a _very wise\r\none_, and has been kept up even at the time of those great congresses\r\nof Paris, Vienna, and ditto Paris in 1815. But in cases of particular\r\naffection and feeling _not_ connected with politics, there have been\r\nduring the reigns of George IV. and William IV. exceptions. The Duke\r\nof Devonshire was sent to the Coronation, I think, of the Emperor\r\nNicholas, because one knew the Emperor liked him. And he has worn ever\r\nsince that diamond star of the St Andrew of the largest dimensions.\r\n\r\nOur Napoleon is too wise not to understand that a treaty has a direct\r\npolitical character. And, during the next fifty years of your glorious\r\nreign, there will be most probably a great many more treaties and\r\ncongresses. You may get all sorts of things during that time, but you\r\ncannot either by the power of heaven or of earth get a new uncle, who\r\nhas kept his word twenty-five years; rather an undertaking considering\r\ncircumstances.... I remain, my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nON BOARD THE _Victoria and Albert_,\r\n_14th August 1856_.\r\n\r\nDEAREST UNCLE,--You will be surprised to get a letter so soon again\r\nfrom me, and still more on _so_ trivial a subject, but I come as a\r\npetitioner for a supply of the cakes or _Oblaten_ which you kindly\r\nalways send me, but which have come to a dead _stop_, having been too\r\nrapidly consumed; _all_ the children having taken to eat them. As I\r\nam not a very good breakfast eater, they are often the _only_ things\r\nI _can_ take at that time, and consequently I miss them much. May I\r\ntherefore beg them to be sent?\r\n\r\nWe are still here; profiting by the _bad_ sea, to visit many beautiful\r\n_points de vue_ in this really beautiful country. We saw yesterday one\r\nof the loveliest places possible--_Endsleigh_--the Duke of Bedford's,\r\nabout twenty miles from here.\r\n\r\nThe weather is so bad, and it blows so hard, that we shall go back\r\nto Southampton to-morrow by railroad--a beautiful line which we have\r\nnever seen. I must close in haste. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nWe went to Saltram, Lord Morley's, this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD GRANVILLE'S MISSION]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CZAR ALEXANDER]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CORONATION OF THE CZAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Granville to Queen Victoria._[40]\r\n\r\nMOSCOW, _30th August 1856_.\r\n\r\nLord Granville presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs,\r\naccording to your Majesty's desire, to submit to your Majesty the\r\nimpressions which he has received during the short time of his stay in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nLord Granville's conversation with the Emperor of Russia, and what he\r\nhas heard from various reliable sources, have led him to the following\r\nconclusions respecting His Imperial Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe is handsome, but thinner and graver than when he was in England.\r\nWhen speaking with energy to Lord Granville his manner seemed to be\r\nrather an imitation of some one else than his own, and he did not look\r\nLord Granville in the face. His usual manner is singularly gentle and\r\npleasing. He does not give the idea of having much strength either of\r\nintellect or of character, but looks intelligent and amiable.\r\nAlthough the education of a Cæsarwitch must be subject to pernicious\r\ninfluences, the present Emperor has had advantages which those in his\r\nposition have not usually had. The Emperor Nicholas came to the throne\r\nwithout having had the confidences of his predecessor. He initiated\r\nhis son into everything that was going on, while others who knew the\r\ngood-nature of the Grand Duke Alexander's character, told him that\r\nwhich they did not tell his father. He was supposed to have different\r\ntastes from the late Emperor, but, since the death of the latter, he\r\nhas liked the late Emperor's favourite residence which he himself had\r\nformerly disliked, he has taken to all the military pursuits of\r\nhis father, and is said to have shown undignified haste in issuing\r\nregulations about, and in appearing in, new uniforms. He is liked by\r\nthose who surround him, but is blamed for not having those habits of\r\npunctuality and of quick decision in business which characterised the\r\nlate Emperor.\r\n\r\nThere is still much talk of stimulants to be applied by His Imperial\r\nMajesty to commerce and to the development of the resources of the\r\ncountry.... There are persons, however, here well qualified to judge,\r\nwho doubt whether much more will be performed than has formerly\r\nbeen done, after brilliant promises at the beginning of a reign. His\r\nImperial Majesty is not supposed to have that power of will which will\r\nenable him to deal with the mass of corruption which pervades every\r\nclass in this country. The Empress,[41] a woman of sense and ability,\r\nis believed to have great influence with her husband when he is with\r\nher, but he is generally guided by the person who speaks last to\r\nhim before he acts--and His Imperial Majesty has not the talent of\r\nsurrounding himself with able men. His Ministers certainly do not\r\nappear to be men of that remarkable intellect as have been usually\r\nsupposed to be employed by the Court of St Petersburg. Count Orloff\r\nis stated to have but little influence, and to have lost his\r\nformer activity. Prince Gortschakoff is clever in society, of easy\r\nconversation and some smartness in repartee. He is vain, a great\r\ntalker, and indiscreet. It is difficult to keep him to the point. He\r\nflies about from one thing to another, and he is so loose in his talk,\r\nthat the repetition of isolated phrases might lead to impressions of\r\nhis meaning, which would not be correct....\r\n\r\nThe Serf Question is admitted by all to be of a very difficult\r\ncharacter, and will become more so as the wealth of the country\r\nincreases. Indeed when that state of things occurs, it is more than\r\nlikely that popular movements will take place, and it is frightful to\r\nconsider the immediate results of a revolution in a country organised\r\nas this is at present. No country in Europe will furnish so fair a\r\nchance of success to Socialism. The reins of Government were held so\r\ntight during the last reign, that even the relaxation which now exists\r\nis not altogether without danger.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the Coronation are on an immense scale. The\r\npresent estimate of the expenses is £1,000,000; the last Coronation\r\ncost half that sum; the Coronation of Alexander, £150,000; while that\r\nof the Emperor Paul did not exceed £50,000. The military household of\r\nthe present Emperor consists of one hundred and twenty generals--that\r\nof Nicholas, at the beginning of his reign, consisted of twenty.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty is spoken of by the Emperor and by the Society here with\r\nthe greatest respect. Lord and Lady Granville have met with nothing\r\nbut remarkable civility from all classes.\r\n\r\nLord Granville has had great pleasure in seeing His Royal Highness\r\nPrince Frederick William of Prussia in such good health and spirits.\r\nHis only anxiety was an interval of fourteen days during which His\r\nRoyal Highness did not hear from England. That anxiety has been\r\nrelieved by a letter received to-day. Lord Granville ventures to\r\nrequest your Majesty to present his respectful remembrances to the\r\nPrincess Royal with his congratulations at Her Royal Highness's\r\ncomplete recovery. Lord Granville begs to advise Her Royal Highness,\r\nwhen residing abroad, not to engage a Russian maid. Lady Wodehouse\r\nfound hers eating the contents of a pot on her dressing-table--it\r\nhappened to be castor oil pomatum for the hair.\r\n\r\nLord Granville has been requested to convey to your Majesty and to\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Albert the Prince of Nassau's expressions of\r\ndevotion and respect. The atmosphere in which His Highness at present\r\nresides does not appear to have had much influence on His Highness's\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: Lord Granville was appointed head of a special\r\n    mission, with the temporary rank of Ambassador, to attend the\r\n    Coronation of the Czar Alexander.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: Marie Alexandrovna, formerly the Princess Marie\r\n    of Hesse, daughter of the Grand Duke Louis II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CHURCH APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST LEONARDS, _6th September 1856_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto submit for your Majesty's gracious approval that Dr Tait, Dean\r\nof Carlisle, should be appointed Bishop of London with a clear\r\nexplanation to him that the Diocese will probably be divided into\r\ntwo--one of London and one of Westminster.\r\n\r\nThat the Bishop of Ripon[42] should be appointed Bishop of Durham,\r\nwith a like explanation that the Diocese of Durham may possibly be\r\ndivided into two--one for Durham and one for Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThat the Dean of Hereford[43] should be appointed Bishop of Ripon; and\r\nthat Dr Trench[44] be appointed Dean of Westminster with the condition\r\nthat he is not to receive any fees or emoluments arising out of\r\nappointments of Knights of the Bath.\r\n\r\nDr Trench is a man of the world and of literature, and would in\r\nthose respects be well suited to be Dean of Westminster, and if his\r\ntendencies are, as some persons suppose, rather towards High Church\r\nopinions, his position as Dean would not afford him any particular\r\nmeans of making those opinions prevail; while his appointment would\r\nshow that the patronage of the Crown was not flowing exclusively in\r\none direction.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston will, on another occasion, submit to your Majesty\r\nthe names of persons for the Deaneries of Hereford and Carlisle.[45]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: Charles Thomas Longley (1774-1868) became Bishop\r\n    of Durham 1856, Archbishop of York 1860, and Archbishop of\r\n    Canterbury 1862.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: Richard Dawes, who became Dean in 1850, and\r\n    restored the Cathedral.

As I know that Clarendon was very anxious to have an early\r\nreply, I have in the first instance sent Mary's letter on to him, and\r\nhave requested him, after perusing it, to send it on to you, and I\r\nhope you will not think that I have been wanting in respect to you in\r\nso doing. With many thanks to you for your great kindness in having\r\nleft the decision of this weighty matter entirely in our hands, I beg\r\nto remain, my dear Cousin, your most dutiful Cousin,\r\n\r\nGEORGE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: The King had, in January 1855, lost his consort,\r\n    Queen Marie Adélaïde, daughter of the Archduke Rénier of\r\n    Austria. Lord Clarendon wrote to Baron Marochetti:--...\r\n\r\n    \"The Queen's first care was for the happiness of Princess\r\n    Mary, and it was the wish of Her Majesty and of Her Majesty's\r\n    Government that the decision should be left to the unbiassed\r\n    judgment of Her Royal Highness.\r\n\r\n    \"Princess Mary, having maturely weighed the matter in all its\r\n    different bearings, has come to the conclusion that it is\r\n    her duty as regards both the King of Sardinia and herself to\r\n    decline the offer, which you were empowered to make on the\r\n    part of His Majesty.\r\n\r\n    \"Princess Mary fully appreciates the many excellent and\r\n    noble qualities of the King. She does not doubt that in him\r\n    individually she would be happy, and she thinks that the\r\n    alliance would be popular in England; but Her Royal Highness\r\n    feels that as the Protestant Queen of Sardinia she must be in\r\n    a false position, and that a wife can never find herself thus\r\n    placed without injury to her husband.\r\n\r\n    \"Princess Mary is deeply attached to her religion, which is\r\n    the first consideration in this world, and in the free and\r\n    undisturbed exercise of that religion, however much it might\r\n    be sanctioned by the King, and supported by His Majesty's\r\n    Government, she feels that she would be the object of\r\n    constant suspicion, that her motives would be liable to\r\n    misconstruction, and that the King would be exposed to grave\r\n    embarrassments, which time would only serve to increase.\r\n\r\n    \"I am not surprised at this decision, which, from my knowledge\r\n    of Princess Mary's profound religious feeling, I rather led\r\n    you to anticipate; but I am bound to say that with reference\r\n    to her religion, and with reference to that alone, Her\r\n    Royal Highness has, in my opinion, decided with wisdom and\r\n    foresight.\r\n\r\n    \"I am convinced, however, that in renouncing upon\r\n    conscientious grounds the brilliant position which has been\r\n    offered to her, of which she fully appreciated the advantages,\r\n    Princess Mary can only have added to the respect which the\r\n    King already feels for the noble and elevated character of Her\r\n    Royal Highness.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING OF PORTUGAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _19th September 1856._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I cannot have your kind and confidential letter of\r\nthe 15th answered, and therefore write to-day to thank you for it.

Comme\r\ndans ce cas [nous] nos deux pays sont tenus par Traité à reprendre les\r\narmes, il me paraît de notre devoir à prévenir de tels dangers.

Added to all this we have ever\r\nhad _such_ a true affection and personal friendship for dear Lord\r\nHardinge, and know how warmly these feelings were requited. _All_\r\nwho had the pleasure of knowing him must ever remember his benevolent\r\nsmile and kind eye.\r\n\r\nBut I speak of ourselves and of what we have lost, when I _ought_ only\r\nto express _our_ sympathy with _you_, in your present overwhelming\r\nloss, but I could not restrain my pen, and the expression of our\r\nfeelings may perhaps be soothing to your bleeding heart.\r\n\r\nMost truly also do we sympathise with your children.\r\n\r\nPray do not think of answering this yourself, but let us hear through\r\nyour son or daughter how you are.

I can well understand that it grieves you\r\nto leave the Highlands. It is not a great proof of the happiness of\r\nhuman kind, that all love to be elsewhere than at the place where\r\ntheir real residence is, notwithstanding all songs of home sweet home,\r\netc. I plead quite guilty to this, though I used to be much attached\r\nto my old home at Coburg and to Claremont. That the weather should\r\nhave been unfavourable is a great pity; here we have had a most\r\nbeautiful and mild weather till the 8th, when a severe thunderstorm\r\nput an end to it.\r\n\r\nPoor Lord Hardinge! I believe after all, though all these people\r\npretend _not_ to mind it, that the Press killed him. I once told Lady\r\nMaryborough and the late Duchess of Wellington that it was fortunate\r\nthe Duke cared so little for the Press. \"Care little,\" they said;\r\n\"why, nothing annoys and irritates him more.\" I find it natural; doing\r\none's best, working with all one's nerves, and to be abused for it, is\r\nnot pleasant.\r\n\r\nTo explain the real state of dear Charlotte's affair I enclose the\r\nonly copy of my letter which exists, and pray you kindly to send it me\r\nback. My object is and was that Charlotte should decide as _she_\r\nlikes it, and uninfluenced by what I might prefer. _I_ should _prefer_\r\nPedro, that I confess, but the Archduke[53] has made a favourable\r\nimpression on Charlotte; I saw that long before any question of\r\nengagement had taken place. The Archduke is out at sea, and nothing\r\ncan well be heard before the 25th of this month. If the thing takes\r\nplace the Emperor ought to put him at the head of Venice; he is well\r\ncalculated for it.\r\n\r\nI am going on the 15th to Ardenne for a week. I have been since that\r\nrevolution of 1848 kept away from it almost entirely, compared\r\nto former days. And now, with my best love to Albert, I must end,\r\nremaining ever, my dearest Victoria, your truly devoted and only\r\nUncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: The Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph of\r\n    Austria, afterwards Emperor of Mexico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _13th October 1856_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I am truly thankful for your kind letter and the\r\nvery confidential enclosure which I return, and which has interested\r\nus both very much, and is truly kind and paternal. I _still hope_ by\r\nyour letter that Charlotte has not finally made up her mind--as we\r\nboth feel so strongly convinced of the immense superiority of Pedro\r\nover any other young Prince even _dans les relations journalistes_,\r\nbesides which the position is so infinitely preferable. The Austrian\r\nsociety is _médisante_ and profligate and worthless--and the Italian\r\npossessions very shaky. Pedro is full of resource--fond of music, fond\r\nof drawing, of languages, of natural history, and literature, in all\r\nof which Charlotte would suit him, and would be a _real_ benefit to\r\nthe country. If Charlotte asked _me_, I should not hesitate a moment,\r\nas I would give any of my own daughters to him were he not a Catholic;\r\nand if Charlotte consulted her friend Vicky I know what _her_ answer\r\nwould be as she is so very fond of Pedro.\r\n\r\n_14th._--I could not finish last night, and so continue to-day. I\r\nshall be most anxious to hear from you about Charlotte, when a _final_\r\ndecision has been taken.\r\n\r\nSince the 6th we have the _most beautiful weather_--with the country\r\nin the _most_ brilliant beauty--but _not_ the bracing weather which\r\ndid one so much good; yesterday and to-day it is _quite_ warm and\r\nrelaxing. Albert has continued to have wonderful sport; not only has\r\nhe killed seven more stags since I wrote, but the finest, largest\r\nstags in the whole neighbourhood--or indeed killed in almost any\r\nforest!...\r\n\r\nEver your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MILITARY EFFICIENCY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _9th November 1856_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Panmure's two boxes of the 4th. She is\r\nglad to hear that the Military and the Defence Committees of the\r\nCabinet are to be reassembled. The absence of all plans for our\r\ndefences is a great evil, and hardly credible. There should exist a\r\nwell-considered general scheme for each place supported by a detailed\r\nargument; this when approved by the Government, should be sanctioned\r\nand signed by the Sovereign, and not deviated from except upon\r\nresubmission and full explanation of the causes which render such\r\ndeviation necessary; no special work should be undertaken which does\r\nnot realise part of this general scheme. The Queen trusts that Lord\r\nPanmure will succeed in effecting this.\r\n\r\nIt is very much to be regretted that so few of the soldiers of\r\nthe German Legion should have accepted the liberal terms of the\r\nGovernment. Those should, however, be made to sail soon.\r\n\r\nThe returns of the different Departments for the last quarter show a\r\nlamentable deficiency in small arms. Fifty-two thousand three hundred\r\nand twenty-two for the whole of the United Kingdom is a sadly small\r\nreserve to have in store; we should never be short of 500,000. The\r\nQueen was struck also with the little work done at Enfield. It appears\r\nthat during the whole quarter this new and extensive establishment has\r\ncompleted only three muskets!\r\n\r\nWith regard to some of the barracks, the tenders have not even yet\r\nbeen accepted, although the year is nearly drawing to a close.\r\nThe Queen hopes soon to receive the returns for the Fortification\r\nDepartment, which is fully two months in arrear....\r\n\r\nWith respect to the list for the Bath, the Queen is somewhat startled\r\nby the large number. Before sanctioning it, she thinks it right to ask\r\nfor an explanation of the services of the officers, and the reasons\r\nfor which they are selected for the honour. She returns the list for\r\nthat purpose to Lord Panmure, who will perhaps cause the statement\r\nto be attached to each name. This, of course, does not apply to the\r\nforeigners. Amongst the Sardinians, however, the Queen observes the\r\nabsence of the names of the Military Commissioners attached first to\r\nLord Raglan and afterwards to General Simpson. The first was a Count\r\nRevel, who has frequently applied for the honour, and the Queen thinks\r\nought to have it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FRANCE AND RUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _10th November 1856_.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty, and humbly begs to transmit\r\na letter from the Empress which was left here this afternoon by M. de\r\nPersigny, who also left a despatch from Count Walewski, of which Lord\r\nClarendon begs to transmit a copy.[54] It is a most unsatisfactory\r\nresult of all the tripotage that has been going on, as it is an\r\ninvitation _pur et simple_ to reassemble the conference with Prussia,\r\nand to abide by the decision of the majority.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon is to see M. de Persigny to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: Count Walewski had written to Count Persigny:\r\n    \"The communications which I have received give us cause to\r\n    fear that Her Majesty's Government may persist in declining\r\n    the proposal to reassemble the Conference....

The letter does not seem to require\r\nan answer at present.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon had a conversation of two hours this morning with M. de\r\nPersigny, who fought all his battles o'er again, but did not say\r\nmuch beyond what Lord Cowley had reported. He is quite sure that the\r\nEmperor is as staunch as ever to the Alliance, and that he believes\r\nall his own personal interests as well as those of France are bound up\r\nwith England. He said, too, that the Empress was not the least taken\r\nin by the flatteries of Russia, which she estimates at their _juste\r\nvaleur_.\r\n\r\nM. de Persigny seems to have performed an act of painful duty and\r\nrather of true devotion, by giving the Empress some advice about her\r\nown conduct and the fate she was preparing for herself if she was not\r\nmore properly mindful of her position and the obligations it entails.\r\nLord Clarendon has seldom heard anything more eloquent or more\r\ntouching than the language of M. de Persigny in describing what he\r\nsaid to the Empress, who appears to have taken it in the best part,\r\nand to have begun acting upon the advice the next day. M. de Persigny\r\nhas no doubt that Count Walewski will soon be removed from his present\r\noffice, and will be _promoted to St. Petersburg_, but Lord Clarendon\r\nwill wait to believe this until it is a _fait accompli_, as it is more\r\nlikely than not that when M. de Persigny is no longer on the spot to\r\nurge the Emperor, Count Walewski will resume his influence.\r\n\r\nCount Walewski's despatch made a very unfavourable impression upon\r\nthe Cabinet, who were of opinion that upon such an invitation and such\r\nslender assurances respecting the course that Sardinia might take,\r\nwe ought not to give up our solid and often repeated objections to\r\nreassembling the Congress--at all events it was considered that we\r\nought to have a positive answer from Turin before we gave a final\r\nanswer....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _13th November 1856_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that Sir Alexander Cockburn[56] accepts the office of\r\nChief Justice of the Common Pleas, but expresses a strong wish not\r\naltogether to be shut out from Parliamentary functions. His health,\r\nwhich has frequently interfered with his attendance in the House of\r\nCommons, makes him feel uncertain as to the future, and he is not\r\ndesirous of being immediately placed in the House of Lords, but he\r\nwould be glad to be allowed to look forward to such a favour from\r\nyour Majesty at some future time if he should find his health stand\r\nsufficiently good to give him a fair prospect of being useful in the\r\nHouse of Lords. He says that with the Baronetcy of an uncle he will\r\nsucceed to an estate of £5,000 a year, independent of what he has\r\nrealised by his own professional exertions; and that consequently\r\nthere would be a provision for a Peerage. Viscount Palmerston begs to\r\nsubmit for your Majesty's gracious approval that such a prospect\r\nmight be held out to Sir Alexander Cockburn. The Chancellor and\r\nLord Lansdowne and Lord Granville concur with Viscount Palmerston in\r\nthinking that much public advantage would arise from the presence of\r\nboth Sir Alexander Cockburn, and of the Master of the Rolls,[57] in\r\nthe House of Lords, and there are numerous precedents for the Chief\r\nJustice of the Common Pleas, and for the Master of the Rolls being\r\nPeers of Parliament.[58] Their judicial duties would no doubt prevent\r\nthem from sitting in the morning on appeal cases, but their presence\r\nin the evening in debates in which the opinions and learning of men\r\nholding high positions in the legal profession would be required,\r\ncould not fail to be of great public advantage.

The real blow was last year; if that could\r\nhave been mitigated, life might have been preserved under tolerable\r\ncircumstances. As things, however, proceeded, if the present attack\r\ncould have been warded off, Charles's existence would have been one\r\nof the most awful suffering, particularly for one whose mental\r\ndisposition was quick and lively. Your sentiments on this occasion do\r\nyou honour; it is by feelings like those you express that evidently\r\n_der Anknüpfungspunkt_ with a future life must be looked for, and\r\nthat alone with such sentiments we can show ourselves fit for such an\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nFor your precious health we must now claim that you will not permit\r\nyour imagination to dwell too much on the very melancholy picture of\r\nthe last moments of one whom you loved, however natural it may be, and\r\nhowever difficult it is to dismiss such ideas.\r\n\r\nFeo feels all this in a most beautiful and truly pious way. It is\r\nstrange that November should be so full of sad anniversaries.

All the accounts of his peaceful death, of his fine\r\nand touching funeral, seem to me to be the descriptions of _another\r\nperson's_ death and burial--not poor dear Charles's.\r\n\r\nDon't fear for my health, it is particularly good--and _grief_ never\r\nseems to affect it; little worries and annoyances fret and irritate\r\nme, but _not great_ or sad events.

The Queen\r\nhas for some time been expecting the proposal of a well-digested and\r\nconsidered plan for the education of the officers of the Army, and\r\nknows that the Duke of Cambridge has had such a one elaborated.\r\nSurely, in the absence of any fixed and approved system of education,\r\nit would be most imprudent to establish an Office for the discharge of\r\ncertain important functions which are not yet defined.

As we are in complete possession since 1849\r\nof the Maharajah's enormous and splendid Kingdom, the Queen thinks we\r\nought to do _everything_ (which does not interfere with the safety of\r\nher Indian dominions) to render the position of this interesting and\r\npeculiarly good and amiable Prince as agreeable as possible, and not\r\nto let him have the feeling that he is _a prisoner_.\r\n\r\nHis being a Christian and completely European (or rather more English)\r\nin his habits and feelings, renders this much more necessary, and at\r\nthe same time more easy.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has a very strong feeling that everything should be done to\r\nshow respect and kindness towards these poor fallen Indian Princes,\r\nwhose Kingdoms we have taken from them, and who are naturally very\r\nsensitive to attention and kindness.\r\n\r\nAmongst all these, however, the Maharajah stands to a certain degree\r\nalone, from his civilisation, and likewise from his having lost his\r\nkingdom when he was a child entirely by the faults and misdeeds of\r\nothers.[62]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: In reply, Mr Vernon Smith stated that he had\r\n    brought all the Queen's wishes before the Company.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MILITARY EDUCATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _18th December 1856._\r\n\r\nIn answer to Lord Palmerston's explanation with regard to Colonel\r\nLefroy's[63] appointment, the Queen has to say, that if he is to be\r\nmade Inspector of Regimental Schools, she has no objection; but she\r\nmust protest against his being made _Director_ of Education for the\r\nArmy generally. We want a Director-General of Education very much, but\r\nhe ought to be immediately under the Commander-in-Chief, if possible\r\na General Officer of weight, assisted by a Board of Officers of the\r\ndifferent Arms.\r\n\r\nEducation ought to be made one of the essential requisites of an\r\nofficer, and the reports on his proficiency ought to go direct through\r\nthe proper superior from the bottom to the top, particularly if\r\nselection by merit is to receive a greater application for the future.\r\nIf for his military proficiency and moral discipline, an officer is to\r\nbe responsible to his Military chief, but for his mental acquirements\r\nto a Civil department, the unity of the system will be broken and the\r\nArmy ruined; and this _must_ be the case if the superintendence of the\r\neducation is separated from the Military command.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Military Education has, as Lord Palmerston says, often\r\nbeen discussed in Parliament, which expects that some sufficient\r\narrangement shall be made for it. But the mere creation of a place\r\nfor an officer, however meritorious, to find him an equivalent for one\r\nwhich has to be reduced, can hardly be so called, and may even defeat\r\nthe object itself. This subject is a most important one, and ought to\r\nbe thoroughly examined before acting. The Queen understands that the\r\nDuke of Cambridge has transmitted to Lord Panmure a complete scheme,\r\nwhich must be now before him. If Lord Palmerston, Lord Panmure,\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge, and the Prince were to meet to consider this\r\nscheme, and the whole question in connection with it, the Queen would\r\nfeel every confidence that a satisfactory decision would be arrived\r\nat.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63: John Henry Lefroy, who now became\r\n    Inspector-General of Army Schools, was an artillery officer of\r\n    considerable scientific attainments.

The Captain's right\r\nto fly the flag was questionable, for the term of registry, even if\r\nvalid in the first instance, which was disputed, had expired (though\r\nthe circumstance was unknown to the Chinese authorities), and the\r\nship's earlier history under the Chinese flag had been an evil one.\r\nBut Sir John Bowring, British Plenipotentiary at Hong Kong, took\r\npunitive measures to enforce treaty obligations; Admiral Seymour\r\ndestroyed the forts on the river, and occupied the island and fort of\r\nDutch Folly. In retaliation, the Chinese Governor Yeh put a price on\r\nBowring's head, and his assassination, and that of other residents, by\r\npoison, was attempted. The British Government's action, however, was\r\nstigmatised as highhanded, and a resolution censuring them was carried\r\nin the Commons, being moved by Mr Cobden and supported by a coalition\r\nof Conservatives, Peelites, and the Peace Party,--Lord John Russell\r\nalso opposing the Government. In consequence of this vote, Parliament\r\nwas dissolved, and at the ensuing election the Peace Party was\r\nscattered to the winds; Bright, Milner Gibson, and Cobden all losing\r\ntheir seats. Lord Palmerston obtained a triumphant majority in the\r\nnew House of Commons, of which Mr J. E. Denison was elected Speaker in\r\nsuccession to Mr Shaw-Lefevre, now created Viscount Eversley. At\r\nthe end of the year an ultimatum was sent to Governor Yeh, requiring\r\nobservance of the Treaty of Nankin, Canton was bombarded, and\r\nsubsequently occupied by the English and French troops.\r\n\r\nHostilities with Persia were terminated by a treaty signed at Paris;\r\nthe Shah engaging to abstain from interference in Afghanistan, and to\r\nrecognise the independence of Herat.\r\n\r\nA century had passed since the victory of Clive at Plassey, but the\r\nAfghan disasters and the more recent war with Russia had caused doubts\r\nto arise as to British stability in India, where the native forces\r\nwere very large in comparison with the European. Other causes, among\r\nwhich may be mentioned the legalising of the remarriage of Hindoo\r\nwidows, and a supposed intention to coerce the natives into\r\nChristianity, were operating to foment dissatisfaction, while recent\r\nacts of insubordination and symptoms of mutiny had been inadequately\r\nrepressed; but the immediate visible provocation to mutiny among the\r\nBengal troops was the use of cartridges said to be treated with\r\na preparation of the fat of pigs and cows, the use of which was\r\nabhorrent, on religious grounds, both to Hindoos and Mohammedans. The\r\nGovernor-General assured the Sepoys by proclamation that no offence to\r\ntheir religion or injury to their caste was intended; but on the\r\n10th of May the native portion of the garrison at Meerut broke out\r\nin revolt. The Mutineers proceeded to Delhi, and were joined by the\r\nnative troops there; they established as Emperor the octogenarian\r\nKing, a man of unscrupulous character, who had been living under\r\nBritish protection.\r\n\r\nGreat cruelties were practised on the European population of all ages\r\nand both sexes, at Lucknow, Allahabad, and especially Cawnpore; by\r\nthe end of June, the Sepoys had mutinied at twenty-two stations--the\r\ndistricts chiefly affected being Bengal, the North-West Provinces,\r\nand Oudh. To cope with this state of things, a large body of British\r\nsoldiers on their way to China were diverted by Lord Elgin to India,\r\nand a force of 40,000 men was despatched from England round the Cape;\r\nwhile Sir Colin Campbell was sent out as Commander-in-Chief. Meanwhile\r\nreinforcements had been drawn from the Punjab, which had remained\r\nloyal. Lucknow was for a long time besieged by the rebels, and\r\nSir Henry Lawrence, its gallant defender, killed. The garrison was\r\nreinforced on the 25th of September by General Havelock; but the\r\nnon-combatants could not be extricated from their perilous position\r\ntill November, when the Garrison was relieved by Sir Colin Campbell.\r\nDelhi was taken in the course of September, but a considerable period\r\nelapsed before the rebellion was finally suppressed. Summary vengeance\r\nwas inflicted on the Sepoy rebels, which gave rise to some criticism\r\nof our troops for inhumanity; but Lord Canning, the Governor-General,\r\nwas no less severely blamed for his clemency; and the general verdict\r\nwas in favour of the measures adopted by the military and civilian\r\nofficers, whose zeal and capacity suppressed the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nBefore the Dissolution of Parliament, Mr Gladstone and Mr Disraeli had\r\njoined in an attack on the budget of Sir George Lewis, and the\r\nPeelite ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer seemed for the moment disposed\r\ndefinitely to return to the Conservative party. To the Divorce Bill,\r\nthe chief legislative result of the second Session, Mr Gladstone gave\r\na persistent and unyielding opposition: but it passed the Commons by\r\nlarge majorities; a Bill for the removal of Jewish disabilities was\r\nmuch debated, but not carried. In August, another visit, this time of\r\na private character, was paid by the Emperor and Empress of the\r\nFrench to the Queen at Osborne. In the middle of November a series of\r\ncommercial disasters of great magnitude took place. The Government,\r\nas in 1847, authorised the infringement for a time of the Bank Charter\r\nAct, and a third session was held to pass an Act of Indemnity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n1857\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Mr Labouchere._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _8th January 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe despatches from Sir George Grey[1] which the Queen returns are\r\nmost interesting. The two chief objects to accomplish appear to be the\r\nbringing the Kaffirs in British Kaffraria within the pale of the law,\r\nso that they may know the blessings of it--and the re-absorption, if\r\npossible, of the Orange River Free State. To both these objects the\r\nefforts of the Government should be steadily directed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: See _ante_, 26th July, 1856.

He is, however, at present on crutches,\r\nand can hardly expect to be in marching order for some few days to\r\ncome. With regard to the matters that are likely to be discussed when\r\nParliament meets, Viscount Palmerston would beg to submit that the one\r\nwhich has for some months past occupied the attention of all Europe,\r\nnamely, the execution of the Treaty of Paris, has been settled in\r\na manner satisfactory to all parties; and this is not only a great\r\nrelief to the Government, but is also a security for the continuance\r\nof the Anglo-French Alliance, which would have been greatly endangered\r\nby the discussions and explanations that might otherwise have been\r\nforced on.\r\n\r\nThe various questions of difference between your Majesty's Government,\r\nand that of the United States, have also been settled, and the\r\ndiplomatic relations between the two countries are about to be\r\nreplaced upon their usual footing. This result will have given great\r\nsatisfaction to the commercial and manufacturing interests.\r\n\r\nSome discussion will take place as to the Expedition to the coast of\r\nPersia, and some persons will, of course, find fault with the whole\r\npolicy pursued on that matter; but people in general will understand\r\nthat Herat is an advanced post of attack against British India,\r\nand that whatever belongs nominally to Persia must be considered as\r\nbelonging practically to Russia, whenever Russia may want to use it\r\nfor her own purposes.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of hostilities at Canton[2] was the result of the\r\ndecision of your Majesty's officers on the spot, and not the\r\nconsequence of orders from home. The first responsibility must\r\ntherefore rest with the local authorities, but Viscount Palmerston\r\ncannot doubt that the Government will be deemed to have acted right\r\nin advising your Majesty to approve the proceedings, and to direct\r\nmeasures for obtaining from the Chinese Government concessions which\r\nare indispensable for the maintenance of friendly relations between\r\nChina and the Governments of Europe.\r\n\r\nOf domestic questions, that which will probably be the most agitated\r\nwill be a large and immediate diminution of the Income Tax; but\r\nany such diminution would disturb the financial arrangements of the\r\ncountry, and it is to be hoped that Parliament will adopt the scheme\r\nwhich will be proposed by Sir G. C. Lewis, by which the Income Tax\r\nwould be made equal in each of the next three years, the amount now\r\nfixed by Law for 1857 being diminished, but the amount now fixed by\r\nLaw for 1858 and 1859 being increased....\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston hears from persons likely to know, that the\r\nConservative Party are not more united than they were last Session.\r\nThat Mr Disraeli and the great bulk of his nominal followers are far\r\nfrom being on good terms together, and that there is no immediate\r\njunction to be expected between Mr Disraeli and Mr Gladstone.[3]\r\n\r\nMr Cobden has given it to be understood that he wishes at the next\r\nGeneral Election to retire from the West Riding of Yorkshire. The real\r\nfact being that the line he took about the late war has made him so\r\nunpopular with his constituents that he would probably not be returned\r\nagain.[4]\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston has heard privately and confidentially that Lord\r\nJohn Russell wrote some little time ago to the Duke of Bedford to say\r\nthat it had been intimated to him that an offer would be made to him\r\nif he were disposed to accept it, to go to the House of Lords and to\r\nbecome there the Leader of the Government. In case your Majesty may\r\nhave heard this report, Viscount Palmerston thinks it right to say\r\nthat no such communication to Lord John Russell was ever authorised\r\nby him, nor has been, so far as he is aware, ever made, and in truth\r\nViscount Palmerston must candidly say that in the present state\r\nof public opinion about the course which Lord John has on several\r\noccasions pursued, he is not inclined to think that his accession to\r\nthe Government would give the Government any additional strength.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: See _ante_, Introductory Note, to Chapter XXVI.\r\n    The difficulty with China had arisen out of her refusal to\r\n    throw open the city of Canton to European trade in conformity\r\n    with the Treaty of Nankin, _ante_, vol. i. 23rd November,\r\n    1842. Sir John Bowring, Chief Superintendent of Trade (and,\r\n    in effect, British Plenipotentiary) at Hong-Kong, had\r\n    resented this, and the feeling thus engendered had come to\r\n    a crisis on the occasion of the seizure of the crew of the\r\n    _Arrow_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The probability of this combination was now\r\n    being perpetually mooted, and, in fact, the two ex-Chancellors\r\n    combined in attacking the Budget.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: He stood instead for Huddersfleld, and was\r\n    defeated by an untried politician; one Liberal (the present\r\n    Lord Ripon) and one Conservative were returned unopposed in\r\n    the West Riding.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CHURCH APPOINTMENTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th February 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen would wish to know before she approves of the appointment\r\nof Mr Alford, of Quebec Chapel, to the head Deanery of Canterbury,\r\nwhether he is a very Low Churchman, as Lord Palmerston will remember\r\nthat he agreed in her observation after the appointment of several of\r\nthe Bishops, that it would be advisable to choose those who were\r\nof moderate opinions--not leaning too much to either side. Extreme\r\nopinions lead to mischief in the end, and produce much discord in the\r\nChurch, which it would be advisable to avoid.[5]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Garter, which the Duke of Norfolk has declined,\r\nshe approves of its being offered to the Duke of Portland.[6] She\r\nthinks that the one now vacant by the death of poor Lord Ellesmere[7]\r\nmight most properly be bestowed on Lord Granville--he is Lord\r\nPresident and Leader of the House of Lords, and acquitted himself\r\nadmirably in his difficult mission as Ambassador to the Emperor of\r\nRussia's Coronation.\r\n\r\nShould Lord Palmerston agree in this view he might at once mention it\r\nto Lord Granville.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: The Deanery was offered to and accepted by Mr\r\n    Alford.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: William John Cavendish Bentinck-Scott, fifth Duke\r\n    (1800-1879).

It has been suggested to\r\nViscount Palmerston that it would be useful to have a meeting of the\r\nParty in Downing Street on Monday, and that many wavering members only\r\nwant to have something said to them which they could quote as a reason\r\nfor changing their intended course; and Viscount Palmerston has given\r\ndirections for summoning such a meeting.\r\n\r\nLord Derby has had meetings of his followers, and has told them that\r\nunless they will support him in a body he will cease to be their\r\nleader, as he will not be the head of a divided Party. Viscount\r\nPalmerston can scarcely bring himself to believe that the House of\r\nCommons will be so fickle as suddenly and without reason to turn round\r\nupon the Government, and after having given them last Session and\r\nthis Session large majorities on important questions, put them in a\r\nminority on what Mr Disraeli last night in a few words said on the\r\nmotion for adjournment described as a Vote of Censure. With regard,\r\nhowever, to the question put by your Majesty as to what would be the\r\ncourse pursued by the Government in the event of a defeat, Viscount\r\nPalmerston could hardly answer it without deliberation with his\r\ncolleagues. His own firm belief is that the present Government has\r\nthe confidence of the country in a greater degree than any other\r\nGovernment that could now be formed would have, and that consequently\r\nupon a Dissolution of Parliament, a House of Commons would be returned\r\nmore favourable to the Government than the present. Whether the state\r\nof business as connected with votes of supply and the Mutiny Act would\r\nadmit of a Dissolution, supposing such a measure to be sanctioned\r\nby your Majesty, would remain to be enquired into; but Viscount\r\nPalmerston believes that there would be no insurmountable difficulty\r\non that score. He will have the honour of waiting upon your Majesty at\r\na little before three to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Mr (afterwards Sir) William Hayter, Liberal Whip,\r\n    the father of Lord Haversham.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: See _ante_, Introductory Note, to Chapter XXVI.

She is sorry that her health imperatively\r\nrequires her going into the country for a few days, and having put off\r\nher going to Windsor on account of the Debate which was expected\r\nto close yesterday, she cannot now do so again to-day. She feels,\r\nhowever, the inconvenience of her absence should the division turn out\r\nas ill as is now anticipated. The Queen could not possibly come to a\r\ndecision on so important a point as a Dissolution without a personal\r\ndiscussion and conference with you, and therefore hopes that you might\r\nbe able to go down to-morrow perhaps for dinner and to stay over the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe Queen feels herself physically quite unable to go through the\r\nanxiety of a Ministerial Crisis and the fruitless attempt to form\r\na new Government out of the heterogeneous elements out of which\r\nthe present Opposition is composed, should the Government feel it\r\nnecessary to offer their resignation, and would on that account\r\n_prefer any other alternative_....

Mr Gladstone, with great vehemence, repelled\r\nthe charge of combination, evidently meaning to answer attacks made\r\nout of the House....\r\n\r\nThe result of what passed seems to be that no serious difficulty will\r\nbe thrown in the way of an early Dissolution.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: Mr Cobden's motion was carried by 263 to 247,\r\n    and Lord Palmerston promptly accepted Mr Disraeli's challenge\r\n    to dissolve Parliament.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Granville to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n[_Undated._ ? _16th March 1857._]\r\n\r\nLord Granville presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs to\r\nsubmit that Lord Derby made a speech of two hours, in which he glanced\r\nat the present state of affairs.[11] He made a personal attack on Lord\r\nPalmerston, and described his colleagues as cyphers and appendages.\r\nThe rest of his speech was of a singularly apologetic and defensive\r\ncharacter. He was quite successful in clearing himself from an\r\nunderstanding--not from political conversations with Mr Gladstone.\r\n\r\nLord Granville, in his reply, was thought very discourteous by Lord\r\nMalmesbury and Lord Hardwicke, who closed the conversation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Lord Derby's resolutions in the Lords, which\r\n    were to the same effect as Mr Cobden's motion, were rejected\r\n    by 146 to 110.

Viscount Palmerston begs to state that the Speaker has chosen the\r\ntitle of Eversley, the name of a small place near his residence[13]\r\nin Hampshire, all the large towns in the county having already been\r\nadopted as titles for Peers. The ordinary course would be that your\r\nMajesty should make him a Baron, and that is the course which was\r\nfollowed in the cases of Mr Abbot made Lord Colchester, and Mr\r\nAbercromby made Lord Dunfermline; but in the case of Mr Manners Sutton\r\na different course was pursued, and he was made Viscount Canterbury.\r\nThe present Speaker is very anxious that his services, which, in fact,\r\nhave been more meritorious and useful than those of Mr Manners Sutton,\r\nshould not appear to be considered by your Majesty as less deserving\r\nof your Majesty's Royal favour, and as the present Speaker may justly\r\nbe said to have been the best who ever filled the chair, Viscount\r\nPalmerston would beg to submit for your Majesty's gracious approval\r\nthat he may be created Viscount Eversley. It will be well at the same\r\ntime if your Majesty should sanction this arrangement that a Record\r\nshould be entered at the Home Office stating that this act of grace\r\nand favour of your Majesty being founded on the peculiar circumstances\r\nof the case, is not to [be] deemed a precedent for the cases of future\r\nSpeakers.\r\n\r\nLord Canterbury was also made a Grand Cross of the Civil Order of the\r\nBath; it will be for your Majesty to consider whether it might not be\r\ngracious to follow in all respects on the present occasion the course\r\nwhich was pursued in the case of Mr Manners Sutton.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: On the 9th, Mr Speaker Shaw-Lefevre had\r\n    announced in the House of Commons his intended retirement from\r\n    the Chair, which he had occupied since 1839, when his election\r\n    had been made a trial of strength between parties.

The Opposition have played their game most\r\nfoolishly, and the result is that _all_ the old Tories say they\r\nwill certainly _not_ support them; they very truly say Lord\r\nDerby's party--that is those who want to get into office _coûte que\r\ncoûte_--whether the country suffers for it or not, wanted to get in\r\nunder _false colours_, and that they won't support or abide--which\r\nthey are _quite_ right in.

Lord Lyndhurst made a most\r\nable speech in favour of the Bill, but wished it to go further,\r\nand give permission to a woman to sue for a divorce if she was\r\n\"maliciously deserted\" by her husband.... The Bishop of Oxford\r\npretended that he was not going to speak at all, in order to secure\r\nhis following instead of preceding the Bishop of London; but upon\r\na division being called he was obliged to speak, and did so with\r\nconsiderable force and eloquence, but betraying the greatest possible\r\npreparation. The Bishop of London, after showing that the Bishop\r\nof Oxford's speech was a repetition of Mr Keble's speech, made an\r\nexcellent answer. The Debate was finished by the Duke of Argyll.\r\n\r\n          For the Bill, 47.     Against it, 18.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: Before this date a divorce could only be\r\n    obtained in England by Act of Parliament, after sentence in\r\n    the ecclesiastical Court, and (in the case of a husband's\r\n    application) a verdict in _crim. con._ against the adulterer.\r\n    The present English law was established by the Bill of 1857,\r\n    the chief amendment made in Committee being the provision\r\n    exempting the clergy from the obligation to marry divorced\r\n    persons. Bishop Wilberforce opposed the Bill strenuously,\r\n    while Archbishop Sumner and Bishop Tait of London supported\r\n    it.

France was the only country in\r\nEurope that could do England harm, and on the other hand England was\r\nthe only country that could injure France--the late war with Russia\r\nhad not the slightest effect upon France except costing her money, but\r\na war with England would set every party in France into activity each\r\nwith its own peculiar objects, but all of them against the existing\r\norder of things--_l'ordre social serait bouleversé_ and the Empire\r\nmight perish in the convulsion.\r\n\r\nThe result of this and other conversations appears to be an earnest\r\ndesire of the Emperor to come to England on a private visit to\r\nthe Queen, if possible at Osborne, and at any time that might be\r\nconvenient to Her Majesty. M. de Persigny describes him as being\r\nintent upon this project, and as attaching the utmost importance to\r\nit in order to _éclairer_ his own ideas, to guide his policy, and to\r\nprevent by personal communication with the Queen, your Royal Highness,\r\nand Her Majesty's Government the dissidences and _mésintelligences_\r\nwhich the Emperor thinks will arise from the want of such\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nI fear that such a visit would not be very agreeable to Her Majesty,\r\nbut in the Emperor's present frame of mind, and his evident alarm lest\r\nit should be thought that the Alliance has been in any way _ébranlée_,\r\nI cannot entertain a doubt that much good might be done, or, at all\r\nevents, that much mischief might be averted by the Emperor being\r\nallowed to pay his respects to Her Majesty in the manner he proposes.\r\n\r\nI have discussed the matter after the Cabinet this evening with Lord\r\nPalmerston, who takes entirely the same view of the matter as I have\r\ntaken the liberty of expressing to your Royal Highness.

We shall, therefore,\r\nbe ready to receive the Emperor, with or without the Empress, here at\r\nOsborne in the quiet way which he proposes. The present moment would,\r\nhowever, hardly do, Drawing-rooms and parties being announced in\r\nLondon, Parliament sitting, and the Season going on and the Queen\r\nhaving only a few days from the Grand Duke's visit to her return\r\nto Town. The latter half of July, the time at which the Queen would\r\nnaturally be here and the best yachting season, might appear to the\r\nEmperor the most eligible, as being the least _forcé_.\r\n\r\nTill then a cottage which is rebuilding will, we hope, be ready to\r\naccommodate some of the suite, whom we could otherwise not properly\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that good will arise from a renewed intercourse\r\nwith the Emperor; the only thing one may perhaps be afraid of is the\r\npossibility of his wishing to gain us over to his views with regard to\r\na redistribution of Europe, and may be disappointed at our not being\r\nable to assent to his plans and aspirations.\r\n\r\nALBERT.[17]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: See _post_, 4th August, 1857, note 30.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _16th June 1857_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--The christening of little Beatrice[18] is just\r\nover--and was very brilliant and nice.

With the exception of his mouth and chin,\r\nhe is good-looking; and I think one does not the least care for that,\r\nas he is so very kind and clever and pleasant. I wish you really joy,\r\ndearest Uncle, at having got _such_ a husband for dear Charlotte, as\r\nI am sure he will make her happy, and is quite worthy of her.

Viscount Palmerston is sorry to have received the accompanying\r\naccount of the extension of the Mutiny among the native troops in\r\nIndia, but he has no fear of its results.[20] The bulk of the European\r\nforce is stationed on the North-West Frontier, and is, therefore,\r\nwithin comparatively easy reach of Delhi, and about six thousand\r\nEuropean troops will have returned to Bombay from Persia. It will,\r\nhowever, seem to be advisable to send off at once the force amounting\r\nto nearly eight thousand men, now under orders for embarkation for\r\nIndia; and when the despatches arrive, which will be about the middle\r\nof next week, it will be seen whether any further reinforcements will\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the Mutiny appears to indicate some deeper cause than\r\nthat which was ascribed to the first insubordination. That cause may\r\nbe, as some allege, the apprehension of the Hindoo priests that their\r\nreligion is in danger by the progress of civilisation in India, or it\r\nmay be some hostile foreign agency.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Alarming accounts of disturbances in India had\r\n    been received for some weeks past, but Lord Palmerston\r\n    failed to grasp the gravity of the situation. Even after\r\n    the intelligence reached England of the mutiny of the native\r\n    regiments at Meerut, on the 10th of May, and of the horrible\r\n    massacres of women and children, the Ministry did not fully\r\n    realise the peril threatening our Indian possessions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE VICTORIA CROSS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure._\r\n\r\n[_Undated,_ ? _June 1857._]\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks that the persons decorated with the Victoria Cross\r\nmight very properly be allowed to bear some distinctive mark after\r\ntheir name.[21] The warrant instituting the decoration does not style\r\nit \"an Order,\" but merely \"a Naval and Military Decoration\" and\r\na distinction; nor is it properly speaking an order, being not\r\n_constituted_.

She had long been of opinion that reinforcements waiting\r\nto go to India ought not to be delayed. The moment is certainly a very\r\ncritical one, and the additional reinforcements now proposed will be\r\nmuch wanted. The Queen entirely agrees with Lord Panmure that it will\r\nbe good policy to oblige the East India Company to keep permanently a\r\nlarger portion of the Royal Army in India than heretofore. The Empire\r\nhas nearly doubled itself within the last twenty years, and the\r\nQueen's troops have been kept at the old establishment. They are the\r\nbody on whom the maintenance of that Empire depends, and the Company\r\nought not to sacrifice the highest interests to love of patronage.\r\nThe Queen hopes that the new reinforcements will be sent out in their\r\nBrigade organisation, and not as detached regiments; good Commanding\r\nOfficers knowing their troops will be of the highest importance next\r\nto the troops themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must ask that the troops by whom we shall be diminished at\r\nhome by the transfer of so many regiments to the Company should be\r\nforthwith replaced by an increase of the establishment up to the\r\nnumber voted by Parliament, and for which the estimates have been\r\ntaken, else we denude ourselves altogether to a degree dangerous to\r\nour own safety at home, and incapable of meeting a sudden emergency,\r\nwhich, as the present example shows, may come upon us at any moment.\r\nIf we had not reduced in such a hurry this spring, we should now have\r\nall the men wanted!\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes Lord Panmure to communicate this letter to Lord\r\nPalmerston.

She has\r\nsanctioned the going of four Regiments to the East Indies. With regard\r\nto the reduction of the garrison of Malta to four Regiments, she hopes\r\nthe Government will well consider whether this will not reduce this\r\nvaluable and exposed spot to a state of insecurity.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is sorry to find Lord Panmure still objecting to a proper\r\nBrigade system, without which no army in the world can be efficient.\r\nWe want General Officers, and cannot train them unless we employ them\r\non military duty, not on clerks' duty in district or colony, but in\r\nthe command of troops. The detachment of Regiments is no reason for\r\nhaving no system, and the country will not pay for General Officers\r\nwhose employment is not part of a system; our Army is then deprived\r\nof its efficiency by the refusal to adopt a system on the part of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DELHI]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GRAVE ANXIETY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Canning to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCALCUTTA, _4th July 1857_.\r\n\r\nLord Canning presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and although\r\nunable to give to your Majesty the complete details of the capture\r\nof Delhi, and of the defeat of the rebels in that city,[22] as he has\r\nlong desired to do, he can at least announce to your Majesty that the\r\ncity is in the possession of the British troops, under Major-General\r\nSir Henry Barnard; and that nothing remains in the hands of the\r\ninsurgents except the Palace or Fort, in which they have all taken\r\nrefuge. This was the state of things on the 13th and 14th of June,\r\nthe latest day of which any certain accounts have been received from\r\nDelhi; but nothing was likely to interfere with the completion of the\r\ncapture within forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nThis event has been long and anxiously awaited, and the time which has\r\nelapsed has cost England and India very dear. Many precious lives have\r\nbeen lost, and much heartrending suffering has been endured, for which\r\nthere can be no compensation. The reputation of England's power, too,\r\nhas had a rude shake; and nothing but a long-continued manifestation\r\nof her might before the eyes of the whole Indian Empire, evinced by\r\nthe presence of such an English force as shall make the thought of\r\noppositon hopeless, will re-establish confidence in her strength.\r\n\r\nLord Canning much fears that there are parts of India where, until\r\nthis is done, a complete return to peace and order will not be\r\neffected. Wherever the little band of English soldiers--little\r\nwhen compared with the stretch of country over which they have to\r\noperate--which Lord Canning has at his disposal has shown itself, the\r\neffect has been instantaneous.\r\n\r\nExcept at Delhi, there has scarcely been an attempt at resistance to\r\nan European soldier, and the march of the smallest detachments has\r\npreserved order right and left of the roads. The same has been the\r\ncase in large cities, such as Benares, Patna, and others; all going to\r\nprove that little more than the presence of English troops is needed\r\nto ensure peace. On the other hand, where such troops are known not to\r\nbe within reach, anarchy and violence, when once let loose, continue\r\nunrestrained; and, until further additions are made to the English\r\nregiments in the disturbed districts, this state of things will not\r\nonly continue, but extend itself. The fall of Delhi will act to\r\nsome degree as a check; but where rapine and outrage have raged\r\nuncontrolled, even for a few hours, it is to be feared that nothing\r\nbut the actual presence of force will bring the country into order.\r\n\r\nLord Canning rejoices to say that to-day the first Regiment of your\r\nMajesty's Forces destined for China has entered the Hooghly. Lord\r\nCanning did not scruple, knowing how much was at stake, earnestly to\r\npress Lord Elgin to allow those forces to be turned aside to India\r\nbefore proceeding to the support of your Majesty's Plenipotentiary\r\nin China;[23] and to this, so far as regards the first two Regiments,\r\nLord Elgin readily assented. From what Lord Canning has ventured to\r\nstate above, your Majesty will easily understand the satisfaction with\r\nwhich each new arrival of an English transport in Calcutta is regarded\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nAs yet no military operations south of Delhi have been undertaken.\r\nNext week, however, a column composed of your Majesty's 64th and\r\n78th (Highland) Regiments will reach Cawnpore[24] and Lucknow, in the\r\nneighbourhood of which it is probable that an opportunity will offer\r\nof striking a decisive blow at the band of rebels which, after that\r\nin Delhi, is the strongest and most compact. But Lord Canning greatly\r\ndoubts whether they will await the onset. Unfortunately, they may run\r\naway from the English troops, and yet prove very formidable to any who\r\nare weaker than themselves--whether Indians or unarmed Europeans.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty is aware that in the critical condition of affairs which\r\nnow exists, Lord Canning has felt himself compelled to adopt the\r\nmeasure of placing the King of Oudh in confinement in Fort William,\r\nin consequence of the use made of his name by those who have been busy\r\ntampering with the Sepoys; and of the intrigues which there is good\r\nreason to believe that the Minister of the King, who is also in the\r\nFort, has carried on in his master's name.[25] The King has been, and\r\nwill continue to be, treated with every mark of respect and indulgence\r\nwhich is compatible with his position, so long as it may be necessary\r\nthat he should be retained in the Fort.\r\n\r\nLord Canning earnestly hopes that your Majesty and the Prince are in\r\nthe enjoyment of good health, and prays your Majesty to be graciously\r\npleased to accept the expression of his sincere devotion and dutiful\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: After the outbreak at Meerut in May, the\r\n    fugitive Sepoys fled to Delhi, and endeavoured to capture the\r\n    magazine, which, however, was exploded by British soldiers.\r\n    Delhi was not captured until September (see _post_, 25th\r\n    September, 1857). On the 11th of July, the Government received\r\n    intelligence of the spread of the Mutiny throughout Bengal,\r\n    and the resulting diminution of the Indian Army.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: For Sir George Grey's action at Cape Town, in\r\n    reference to the troops destined for China, see his Memoir, in\r\n    the _Dictionary of National Biography_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: On the 4th of June, two native regiments had\r\n    mutinied at Cawnpore, and the English residents, under General\r\n    Sir Hugh Wheeler, were besieged. After many deaths and much\r\n    privation, the garrison were induced by the perfidy of Nana\r\n    Sahib, who had caused the Cawnpore rising, to surrender, on\r\n    condition of their lives being spared.

His Motion was ostensibly for\r\ntwo papers, one of which does not exist, at least in the possession of\r\nthe Government, and the other of which ought not to be made public,\r\nas it relates to the arrangements for defending India against external\r\nattack. He represented the disturbances in India as a national revolt,\r\nand not as a mere military mutiny; and he enumerated various causes\r\nwhich in his opinion accounted, for and justified this general revolt.\r\nSome of these causes were various measures of improved civilisation\r\nwhich from time to time during the last ten years the Indian\r\nGovernment had been urged by Parliament to take. Mr Vernon Smith\r\nfollowed, and in a very able speech answered in great detail Mr\r\nDisraeli's allegations. Sir Erskine Perry,[26] who evidently had\r\nfurnished Mr Disraeli with much of his mistaken assertions, supported\r\nhis views. Mr Campbell, Member for Weymouth, who had been many years\r\nin India, showed the fallacy of Mr Disraeli's arguments, and the\r\ngroundlessness of many of his assertions. Mr Whiteside supported\r\nthe Motion. Lord John Russell, who had after Mr Disraeli's speech\r\ncommunicated with the Government, expressed his disapprobation of\r\nMr Disraeli's speech, and moved as an Amendment an Address to your\r\nMajesty expressing the assurance of the support of the House for\r\nmeasures to suppress the present disturbances, and their co-operation\r\nwith your Majesty in measures for the permanent establishment of\r\ntranquillity and contentment in India.[27] Mr Mangles, the Chairman\r\nof the Directors, replied at much length, and very conclusively to Mr\r\nDisraeli's speech. Mr Liddell, with much simplicity, asked the Speaker\r\nto tell him how he should vote, but approved entirely of Lord John\r\nRussell's address. Mr Ayrton moved an adjournment of the Debate, which\r\nwas negatived by 203 to 79. Mr Hadfield then shortly stated in his\r\nprovincial dialect that \"we can never keep our 'old upon Hindia by\r\nthe Force of Harms.\" Mr Disraeli then made an animated reply to the\r\nspeeches against him, but in a manner almost too animated for the\r\noccasion. Mr Thomas Baring set Mr Disraeli right, but in rather strong\r\nterms, about some proceedings of the Committee on Indian Affairs\r\nin 1853, with regard to which Mr Disraeli's memory had proved\r\nuntrustworthy. Viscount Palmerston shortly made some observations on\r\nthe Motion and the speech which had introduced it; and the Motion was\r\nthen negatived without a division, and the Address was unanimously\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: Chief Justice of Bombay 1847-1852, and M.P. for\r\n    Devonport 1854-1859.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: \"One of those dry constitutional platitudes,\"\r\n    said Mr Disraeli in reply, \"which in a moment of difficulty\r\n    the noble lord pulls out of the dusty pigeon-holes of his\r\n    mind, and shakes in the perplexed face of the baffled House\r\n    of Commons.\" Mr Disraeli was admittedly much annoyed by the\r\n    statesmanlike intervention of Lord John.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MARRIAGE OF PRINCESS CHARLOTTE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _27th July 1857_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--At _this_ very _moment_ the marriage[28] is going\r\non--the _Knot_ is being tied which binds your lovely sweet child to a\r\nthoroughly worthy husband--and I am sure you will be much moved. May\r\nevery blessing attend her! I wish _I_ could be present--but my dearest\r\n_Half_ being there makes me feel as I were there myself. I try to\r\npicture to myself how _all_ will be. I could not give you a greater\r\nproof of my love for you all, and my anxiety to give you and dearest\r\nCharlotte pleasure, than in urging my dearest Albert to go over--for I\r\nencouraged and _urged_ him to go though you cannot think _combien\r\ncela me coûte_ or how completely _déroutée_ I am and _feel_ when he\r\nis away, or how I count the hours till he returns. _All_ the numerous\r\nchildren are as _nothing_ to me when _he is away_; it seems as if the\r\nwhole life of the house and home were gone, when he is away!\r\n\r\nWe do all we can to _fêter_ in our very _quiet_ way this dear day.\r\nWe are all out of mourning; the younger children are to have a\r\nhalf-holiday, Alice is to _dine_ for the first time in the evening\r\nwith us; we shall drink _the Archduke and Archduchess's_ healths; and\r\nI have ordered _wine_ for our servants, and _grog_ for our sailors to\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\nVicky (who is painting in the Alcove near me) wishes me to say\r\neverything to you and the _dear young couple_, and pray tell dear\r\nCharlotte _all_ that we have been doing....\r\n\r\nHere we are in anxious (and I fear many people in very _cruel_)\r\nsuspense, for news from India. They _ought_ to have arrived the day\r\nbefore yesterday.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, then, we are to have Prince Napoleon, and on the\r\nfollowing Thursday the Emperor and Empress; and after them for _one_\r\nnight, the Queen of Holland,[29] whose activity is astounding--and she\r\nsees everything and everybody and goes everywhere; she is certainly\r\nclever and amiable....\r\n\r\nNow, with our children's affectionate love, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nPray offer my kind regards to _all_ your visitors, even to those whom\r\nI do _not_ know.

She must say, that the last accounts\r\nfrom India show so formidable a state of things that the military\r\nmeasures hitherto taken by the Home Government, on whom the salvation\r\nof India must mainly depend, appear to the Queen as by no means\r\nadequate to the emergency. We have nearly gone to the full extent of\r\nour available means, just as we did in the Crimean War, and may be\r\nable to obtain successes; but we have not laid in a store of troops,\r\nnor formed Reserves which could carry us over a long struggle, or meet\r\nunforeseen new calls. Herein we are always most shortsighted, and have\r\nfinally to suffer either in power and reputation, or to pay enormous\r\nsums for small advantages in the end--generally both.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes that the Cabinet will look the question boldly in the\r\nface; nothing could be better than the Resolutions passed in the House\r\nof Commons, insuring to the Government every possible support in the\r\nadoption of vigorous measures. It is generally the Government, and not\r\nthe House of Commons, who hang back. The Queen wishes Lord Palmerston\r\nto communicate this letter to his Colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE NAVY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _4th August 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe defenceless state of our shores, now that the Army has been\r\nreduced to eighteen effective Battalions, and the evident inclinations\r\nof the Continental Powers, chiefly France and Russia, to dictate to us\r\nwith regard to the Oriental Question, makes the Queen naturally turn\r\nher attention to the state of our naval preparations and force.\r\n\r\nTo render it possible to salute the Emperor[30] when he comes here,\r\nthe old _St Vincent_ has been brought out of the harbour, but has been\r\nmanned chiefly by the men of the _Excellent_ gunnery ship; and we\r\nhave been warned by the Admiralty not to visit the _Excellent_ in\r\nconsequence. This does not show a very brilliant condition! But what\r\nis still more worthy of consideration is, that our new fleet, which\r\nhad been completed at the end of the Russian War, was _a steam_ fleet;\r\nwhen it was broken up at the Peace the dockyard expenses were also\r\ncut down, and men discharged at the very moment when totally new and\r\nextensive arrangements became necessary to repair and keep in a state\r\nof efficiency the valuable steam machinery, and to house our gunboat\r\nflotilla on shore. To render any of these steamships fit for sea,\r\nnow that they are dismantled, with our _small_ means as to basins and\r\ndocks, must necessarily cost much time.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes accordingly to have a report sent to her as to the\r\nforce of screw-ships of the Line and of other classes which can be got\r\nready at the different dockyards, and the time required to get them to\r\nsea for actual service; and also the time required to launch and get\r\nready the gunboats. She does not wish for a mere general answer from\r\nthe Lords of the Admiralty, but for detailed reports from the Admirals\r\ncommanding at the different ports, and particularly the Captains in\r\ncommand of the Steam Reserve. She would only add that she wishes no\r\nunnecessary time to be lost in the preparation of these reports. She\r\nrequests Lord Palmerston to have these, her wishes, carried out.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: The Emperor and Empress of the French arrived\r\n    at Osborne on the 6th of August on a visit to the Queen\r\n    and Prince, lasting for four days, during which time much\r\n    discussion took place between the Prince and Emperor on\r\n    affairs in Eastern Europe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF SIR HENRY LAWRENCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _22nd August 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is afraid from the telegram of this morning that affairs in\r\nIndia have not yet taken a favourable turn. Delhi seems still to hold\r\nout, and the death of Sir H. Lawrence[31] is a great loss. The Queen\r\nmust repeat to Lord Palmerston that the measures hitherto taken by the\r\nGovernment are not commensurate with the magnitude of the crisis.\r\n\r\nWe have given nearly all we have in reinforcements, and if new efforts\r\nshould become necessary, by the joining of the Madras and Bombay\r\nArmies in the Revolt, for instance, it will take months to prepare\r\nReserves which ought now to be ready. Ten Battalions of Militia to\r\nbe called out is quite inadequate; forty, at least, ought to be the\r\nnumber, for these also exist only on paper. The augmentation of the\r\nCavalry and the Guards has not yet been ordered.\r\n\r\nFinancial difficulties don't exist; the 14,000 men sent to India are\r\ntaken over by the Indian Government, and their expense saved to\r\nus; and this appears hardly the moment to make savings on the Army\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: On the previous day, the Queen and Prince had\r\n    returned from a visit to Cherbourg, and found very disquieting\r\n    news from India.

It is, no doubt, true that the\r\ntelegraphic account received yesterday evening does not show, that at\r\nthe dates mentioned from India, any improvement had taken place in the\r\nstate of affairs, and the loss of Sir Henry Lawrence and of General\r\nBarnard,[32] but especially of the former, is deeply to be lamented.\r\n\r\nWith regard, however, to the measures now taking to raise a force to\r\nsupply the place of the troops sent to India, and to enlist recruits\r\nto fill up vacancies in the Regiments in India, Viscount Palmerston\r\nwould beg to submit that the steps now taking seem to be well\r\ncalculated for their purpose. The recruiting for the Army has gone on\r\nmore rapidly than could have been expected at this particular time of\r\nyear, and in a fortnight or three weeks from this time will proceed\r\nstill more rapidly; the ten thousand Militia to be immediately\r\nembodied will be as much as could probably be got together at the\r\npresent moment without much local inconvenience; but if that number\r\nshould be found insufficient, it would be easy afterwards to embody\r\nmore. But, if the recruiting should go on successfully, that number\r\nof Militiamen in addition to the Regulars may be found sufficient.\r\nViscount Palmerston begs to assure your Majesty that there is no wish\r\nto make savings on the amount voted for Army Services, but, on the\r\nother hand, it would be very inconvenient and embarrassing to exceed\r\nthat amount without some urgent and adequate necessity....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: He died of cholera at Delhi, on the 5th of\r\n    July.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _22nd August 1857_.\r\n\r\nIn answer to Lord Palmerston's observations on our Military\r\npreparations, the Queen must reply that, although Lord Palmerston\r\ndisclaims, on the part of the Government, the intention of making a\r\nsaving on the Army estimates out of the fearful exigencies caused by\r\nthe Indian Revolt, the facts still remain. The Government have sent\r\nfourteen Battalions out of the country and transferred them to the\r\nEast India Company, and they mean to replace them only by ten new\r\nones, whose organisation has been ordered; but even in these, they\r\nmean for the present to save four Companies out of every twelve. The\r\nQueen, the House of Lords, the House of Commons, and the Press, all\r\ncall out for vigorous exertion, and the Government alone take an\r\napologetic line, anxious to do as little as possible, to wait for\r\nfurther news, to reduce as low as possible even what they do grant,\r\nand reason as if we had at most _only_ to replace what was sent out;\r\nwhilst if new demands should come upon us, the Reserves which ought\r\nnow to be decided upon and organised, are only then to be discussed.\r\nThe Queen can the less reconcile herself to the system, of \"letting\r\nout a little sail at a time,\" as Lord Palmerston called it the other\r\nday, as she feels convinced that, if vigour and determination to\r\nget what will be eventually wanted is shown by the Cabinet, it will\r\npervade the whole Government machinery and attain its object; but that\r\nif, on the other hand, people don't see what the Government really\r\nrequire, and find them satisfied with a little at a time, even that\r\nlittle will not be got, as the subordinates naturally take the tone\r\nfrom their superiors. Ten Militia Regiments would not even represent\r\nthe 10,000 men whom Parliament has voted the supplies for. A Battalion\r\nwill probably not reach 600 for a time, and from these we hope to draw\r\nvolunteers again!\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes the Cabinet will yet look the whole question in the\r\nface, and decide while there is time what they must know will become\r\nnecessary, and what must in the hurry at the end be done less well\r\nand at, probably, double the cost. The Queen can speak by very recent\r\nexperience, having seen exactly the same course followed in the late\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _23rd August 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen approves of Lord Fife[33] and Lord R.

The War Office pride themselves upon having got 1,000\r\nmen since the recruiting began; this is equal to 1,000 a month or\r\n12,000 a year, the ordinary wear and tear of the Army!! Where will the\r\nReserves for India be to be found? It does not suffice merely to get\r\n_recruits_, as Lord Palmerston says; they will not become _soldiers_\r\nfor six months when got, and in the meantime a sufficient number of\r\nMilitia Regiments ought to be drilled, and made efficient to relieve\r\nthe Line Regiments already sent, or yet to be sent, for these also are\r\nat present necessarily good for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must say that the Government incur a fearful responsibility\r\ntowards their country by their apparent indifference. God grant that\r\nno unforeseen European complication fall upon this country--but we are\r\nreally tempting Providence.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes Lord Palmerston has communicated to the Cabinet her\r\nviews on the subject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: After referring to the necessity for supplying\r\n    by fresh drafts the gaps created in the regiments in India,\r\n    Lord Palmerston had written:--\r\n\r\n    \"If the Militia officers were to find that they were\r\n    considered merely as drill sergeants for the Line, they would\r\n    grow careless and indifferent, and many whom it is desirable\r\n    to keep in the Service would leave it.\r\n\r\n    \"With regard to the number of Militiamen to be embodied, the\r\n    question seems to be, What is the number which will be wanted\r\n    for the whole period to the 31st of March, because it would be\r\n    undesirable to call out and embody now Militia Regiments which\r\n    would become unnecessary during the winter by the progress of\r\n    recruiting, and which, from there being no funds applicable to\r\n    their maintenance, it would become necessary to disembody. The\r\n    men would be now taken from industrial employment at a time\r\n    when labour is wanted, and would be turned adrift in the\r\n    winter when there is less demand for labour.\r\n\r\n    \"With respect to recruiting for the Army, every practicable\r\n    means has been adopted to hasten its success.

The only thing to be done is to\r\n    raise men as fast as possible, and to post them as they are\r\n    raised to the Regiments and Battalions for which they engage.\r\n    The standard, moreover, has been lowered....\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD LANSDOWNE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _31st August 1857_.\r\n\r\n...

Though we might have perhaps wished the Maharajah[40] to express\r\nhis feelings on the subject of the late atrocities in India, it was\r\nhardly to be expected that he (naturally of a negative, though gentle\r\nand very amiable disposition) should pronounce an opinion on so\r\npainful a subject, attached as he is to his country, and naturally\r\n_still_ possessing, with all his amiability and goodness, an _Eastern\r\nnature_; he can also hardly, a deposed Indian Sovereign, _not very_\r\nfond of the British rule as represented by the East India Company,\r\nand, above all, impatient of Sir John Login's[41] tutorship, be\r\nexpected to _like_ to hear his country-people called _fiends_ and\r\n_monsters_, and to see them brought in hundreds, if not thousands, to\r\nbe executed.\r\n\r\nHis best course is to say nothing, she must think.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mercy he, poor boy, is not there.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: Lord Clarendon had written that he was \"sorry to\r\n    learn that the Maharajah (Dhuleep Singh) had shown little or\r\n    no regret for the atrocities which have been committed, or\r\n    sympathy with the sufferers.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: Sir John Spencer Login, formerly surgeon at the\r\n    British Residency, Lucknow, guardian of the Maharajah Dhuleep\r\n    Singh, 1849-1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER FROM LORD CANNING]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR COLIN CAMPBELL]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDIA]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE POLICY OF CLEMENCY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Canning to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCALCUTTA, _25th September 1857_.\r\n\r\nLord Canning presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and asks leave\r\nagain to address your Majesty, although the desire which he has felt\r\nthat his next letter should announce to your Majesty the fall of\r\nDelhi, and the first steps towards a restoration of your Majesty's\r\nAuthority throughout the revolted Districts, cannot as yet be\r\naccomplished. But although it is not in Lord Canning's power to report\r\nany very marked success over the Rebels, he can confidently assure\r\nyour Majesty that a change in the aspect of affairs is gradually\r\ntaking place, which gives hope that the contest is drawing to a close,\r\nand the day of punishment at hand....\r\n\r\nAnother ground for good hopes is the appearance of things at Lucknow.\r\nNews just received from Sir James Outram announces that he has joined\r\nGeneral Havelock's force at Cawnpore, and that the Troops crossed the\r\nGanges into Oudh on the 19th, with hardly any opposition. The European\r\nforce now advancing on Lucknow is about [....][42] strong, well\r\nprovided with Artillery. The beleaguered Garrison was in good spirits\r\non the 16th of September, and had provisions enough to last to the\r\nend of the month. They had lately inflicted severe losses on their\r\nassailants, and some of the latter had dispersed. The influential\r\nproprietors and chiefs of the country had begun to show symptoms of\r\nsiding with us.\r\n\r\nThis is a very different state of things from that which existed when\r\nGeneral Havelock's force retired across the Ganges in July; and Lord\r\nCanning prays and believes that your Majesty will be spared the\r\npain and horror of hearing that the atrocities of Cawnpore have been\r\nre-enacted upon the brave and enduring garrison of Lucknow. Every\r\nEnglish soldier who could be made to reach Cawnpore has been pushed\r\non to General Outram, even to the denuding of some points of danger\r\nin the intervening country, and General Outram's instructions are to\r\nconsider the rescue of the garrison as the one paramount object to\r\nwhich everything else is to give way. The garrison (which, after all,\r\nis nothing more than the House of the Resident, with defences hastily\r\nthrown up) contains about three hundred and fifty European men, four\r\nhundred and fifty women and children, and one hundred and twenty sick,\r\nbesides three hundred natives, hitherto faithful. The city, and even\r\nthe province, may be abandoned and recovered again, but these lives\r\nmust be saved now or never; and to escape the sorrow and humiliation\r\nof such barbarities as have already been endured elsewhere is worth\r\nany sacrifice. It is in consideration of the state of things at\r\nthese two most critical points, Delhi and Lucknow, that Lord Canning\r\nventures to ask your Majesty to look hopefully to the events of the\r\nnext few weeks; notwithstanding that he is unable to announce any\r\nsignal success....\r\n\r\nSir Colin Campbell has been in a state of delight ever since his\r\nfavourite 93rd landed five days ago.[43] He went to see them on board\r\ntheir transport before they disembarked, and when Lord Canning asked\r\nhow he found them, replied that the only thing amiss was that they had\r\nbecome too fat on the voyage, and could not button their coats. But,\r\nindeed, all the troops of the China force have been landed in the\r\nhighest possible condition of health and vigour. The 23rd, from its\r\nlarge proportion of young soldiers, is perhaps the one most likely\r\nto suffer from the climate and the hardships of the Service--for,\r\nalthough no care or cost will be spared to keep them in health and\r\ncomfort, Lord Canning fears that hardships there must be, seeing how\r\nvast an extent of usually productive country will be barren for a\r\ntime, and that the districts from which some of our most valuable\r\nsupplies, especially the supply of carriage animals, are drawn,\r\nhave been stripped bare, or are still in revolt. As it is, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief has most wisely reduced the amount of tent\r\naccommodation for officers and men far below the ordinary luxurious\r\nIndian allowance.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the ships of the Royal Navy has been of the greatest\r\nservice. At least eleven thousand seamen and marines have been\r\ncontributed by them for duty on shore, and the broadsides of the\r\n_Sanspareil_, _Shannon_, and _Pearl_, as they lie along the esplanade,\r\nhave had a very reassuring effect upon the inhabitants of Calcutta,\r\nwho, until lately, have insisted pertinaciously that their lives and\r\nproperty were in hourly danger.[44]\r\n\r\nNo line-of-battle ship has been seen in the Hooghly since Admiral\r\nWatson sailed up to Chandernagore just a hundred years ago;[45] and\r\ncertainly nothing in his fleet was equal to the _Sanspareil_. The\r\nnatives stare at her, and call her \"the four-storied boat.\"\r\n\r\nFor the future, if Delhi should fall and Lucknow be secured, the work\r\nof pacification will go forward steadily. Many points will have to be\r\nwatched, and there may be occasional resistance; but nothing like\r\nan organised contest against authority is probable. The greatest\r\ndifficulties will be in the civil work of re-settlement. The recent\r\ndeath of Mr Colvin,[46] the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western\r\nProvinces, has removed an officer whose experience would there have\r\nbeen most valuable. He has died, fairly exhausted; and is the fourth\r\nofficer of high trust whose life has given way in the last four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest difficulties which lie ahead--and Lord Canning\r\ngrieves to say so to your Majesty--will be the violent rancour of a\r\nvery large proportion of the English community against every\r\nnative Indian of every class. There is a rabid and indiscriminate\r\nvindictiveness abroad, even amongst many who ought to set a better\r\nexample, which it is impossible to contemplate without something like\r\na feeling of shame for one's fellow-countrymen. Not one man in\r\nten seems to think that the hanging and shooting of forty or fifty\r\nthousand mutineers, besides other Rebels, can be otherwise than\r\npracticable and right; nor does it occur to those who talk and write\r\nmost upon the matter that for the Sovereign of England to hold and\r\ngovern India without employing, and, to a great degree, trusting\r\nnatives, both in civil and military service, is simply impossible. It\r\nis no exaggeration to say that a vast number of the European community\r\nwould hear with pleasure and approval that every Hindoo and Mohammedan\r\nhad been proscribed, and that none would be admitted to serve the\r\nGovernment except in a menial office. That which they desire is to see\r\na broad line of separation, and of declared distrust drawn between us\r\nEnglishmen and every subject of your Majesty who is not a Christian,\r\nand who has a dark skin; and there are some who entirely refuse\r\nto believe in the fidelity or goodwill of any native towards any\r\nEuropean; although many instances of the kindness and generosity\r\nof both Hindoos and Mohammedans have come upon record during these\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nTo those whose hearts have been torn by the foul barbarities inflicted\r\nupon those dear to them any degree of bitterness against the natives\r\nmay be excused. No man will dare to judge them for it. But the cry is\r\nraised loudest by those who have been sitting quietly in their homes\r\nfrom the beginning and have suffered little from the convulsions\r\naround them unless it be in pocket. It is to be feared that this\r\nfeeling of exasperation will be a great impediment in the way of\r\nrestoring tranquillity and good order, even after signal retribution\r\nshall have been deliberately measured out to all chief offenders.[47]\r\n\r\nLord Canning is ashamed of having trespassed upon your Majesty's\r\nindulgence at such length. He will only add that he has taken the\r\nliberty of sending to your Majesty by this mail a map which has just\r\nbeen finished, showing the distribution of the Army throughout India\r\nat the time of the outbreak of the Mutiny. It also shows the Regiments\r\nof the Bengal Army which have mutinied, and those which have been\r\ndisarmed, the number of European troops arrived in Calcutta up to the\r\n19th of September, and whence they came; with some few other points of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThere may be some slight inaccuracies, as the first copies of the map\r\nhave only just been struck off, and have not been corrected; but Lord\r\nCanning believes that it will be interesting to your Majesty at the\r\npresent moment.\r\n\r\nLord Canning begs to be allowed to express his earnest wishes for the\r\nhealth of your Majesty, and of His Royal Highness Prince Albert,\r\nand to offer to your Majesty the humble assurance of his sincere and\r\ndutiful devotion.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: Word omitted in the original.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: At the battle of the Alma, Sir Colin Campbell,\r\n    in command of the 2nd or Highland Brigade of the 1st Division,\r\n    had, with his Highlanders in line, routed the last compact\r\n    column of the Russians.

We have known him for three\r\nyears (our two boys intimately), and he always shuddered at hurting\r\nanything, and was peculiarly gentle and kind towards children and\r\nanimals, and if anything rather timid; so that all who knew him said\r\nhe never could have had a chance in his own country. His valet, who\r\nis a very respectable Englishman, and has been with him ever since\r\nhis twelfth year, says that he never knew a kinder or more amiable\r\ndisposition. The Queen fears that people who do not know him well have\r\nbeen led away by their present very natural feelings of hatred and\r\ndistrust of all Indians to slander him. What he might turn out, if\r\nleft in the hands of unscrupulous Indians in his own country, of\r\ncourse no one can foresee.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: See _ante_, 23rd September, 1857, note 40.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _17th October 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received yesterday evening the box with the Dockyard\r\nReturns.

It would be well if Lord Clarendon\r\nwould tell Lord Bloomfield not to _entertain_ the _possibility_ of\r\nsuch a question as the Princess Royal's marriage taking place at\r\nBerlin.[50] The Queen _never_ could consent to it, both for public\r\nand private reasons, and the assumption of its being _too much_ for a\r\nPrince Royal of Prussia to _come_ over to marry _the Princess Royal\r\nof Great Britain_ IN England is too _absurd_, to say the least. The\r\nQueen must say that there never was even the _shadow_ of a _doubt_ on\r\n_Prince Frederick William's_ part as to _where_ the marriage should\r\ntake place, and she suspects this to be the mere gossip of the\r\nBerliners. Whatever may be the usual practice of Prussian Princes, it\r\nis not _every_ day that one marries the eldest daughter of the Queen\r\nof England. The question therefore must be considered as settled and\r\nclosed....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: The marriage took place at the Chapel Royal, St\r\n    James's.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF THE DUCHESS DE NEMOURS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th November 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thanks Lord Clarendon much for his kind and sympathising\r\nletter, and is much gratified at Count Persigny's kind note. He _is_\r\na good, honest, warm-hearted man, for whom we have sincere esteem.\r\nThe news from India was a great relief and a _ray_ of sunshine in our\r\ngreat affliction.[51] The Queen had the happiness of informing poor\r\nSir George Couper of the relief of Lucknow, in which for four months\r\nhis son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren were shut up. The loss of\r\ntwo such distinguished officers as Generals Nicholson and Neill, and\r\nalas! of many inferior ones, is, however, very sad.\r\n\r\nWe visited the house of mourning yesterday, and _no words can_\r\ndescribe the scene of woe.[52] There was the venerable Queen with\r\nthe motherless children, admirable in her deep grief, and her pious\r\nresignation to the Will of God! yet even now the support, the comfort\r\nof all, thinking but of others and ready to devote her last remaining\r\nstrength and her declining years to her children and grandchildren.\r\nThere was the broken-hearted, almost distracted widower--_her\r\nson_--and lastly, there was in one room the lifeless, but oh! even in\r\nits ghostliness, most beautiful form of his young, lovely, and angelic\r\nwife, lying in her bed with her splendid hair covering her shoulders,\r\nand a heavenly expression of peace; and in the next room, the dear\r\nlittle pink infant sleeping in its cradle.\r\n\r\nThe Queen leaves to Lord Clarendon's kind heart to imagine what this\r\nspectacle of woe must be, and how _deeply_ afflicted and impressed _we\r\nmust be_--who have only so lately had a child born to us and have been\r\nso fortunate! The Prince has been _completely_ upset by this; and she\r\nwas besides like a dear sister to us. God's will be done! But it\r\nseems _too_ dreadful almost to believe it--too hard to bear. The dear\r\nDuchess's death must have been caused by some affection of the heart,\r\nfor she was perfectly well, having her hair combed, suddenly exclaimed\r\nto the Nurse, \"Oh! mon Dieu, Madame\"--her head fell on one side--and\r\nbefore the Duke could run upstairs her hand was cold! The Queen\r\nhad visited her on Saturday--looking well--and _yesterday_ saw her\r\nlifeless form in the very same spot!\r\n\r\nIf Lord Clarendon could give a slight hint to the _Times_ to say a few\r\nwords of sympathy on the awful and unparalleled misfortune of these\r\npoor exiles, she is sure it would be very soothing to their bleeding\r\nhearts.... The sad event at Claremont took place just five days later\r\nthan the death of poor Princess Charlotte under very similar\r\ncircumstances forty years ago; and the poor Duchess was the niece of\r\nPrincess Charlotte's husband.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: Havelock, in consequence of the strength of the\r\n    rebels in Oudh, had been unable to march to the assistance of\r\n    Lucknow immediately after the relief of Cawnpore.

She had seemed to make a good recovery after the\r\n    birth of a child on the 28th of October, but died quite\r\n    suddenly on the 10th of November, while at her toilette.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CRISIS IN THE CITY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SUSPENSION OF BANK CHARTER ACT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _12th November 1857_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that the condition of financial affairs became worse to-day\r\nthan it was yesterday.[53] The Governor of the bank represented that\r\nalmost all private firms have ceased to discount bills, and that the\r\nReserve Fund of the Bank of England, out of which discounts are made\r\nand liabilities satisfied, had been reduced last night to £1,400,000,\r\nand that if that fund should become exhausted the bank would have\r\nto suspend its operations. Under these circumstances it appeared to\r\nViscount Palmerston, and to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that a\r\ncase had arisen for doing the same thing which was done under somewhat\r\nsimilar circumstances in 1847--that is to say, that a letter should\r\nbe written by the first Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer to the Governor of the Bank of England, saying that if under\r\nthe pressure of the emergency the bank should deem it necessary to\r\nissue more notes than the amount to which they are at present confined\r\nby law, the Government would apply to Parliament to grant them an\r\nindemnity.\r\n\r\nThis Measure, in 1847, had the effect of stopping the then existing\r\npanic, and the necessity for making such an issue did not arise; on\r\nthe present occasion this announcement will, no doubt, have a salutary\r\neffect in allaying the present panic, but as the bank had to discount\r\nto-day bills to the amount of £2,000,000, which they could not have\r\ndone out of a fund of £1,400,000, unless deposits and payments in,\r\nto a considerable amount, had been made, the probability is that\r\nthe issue thus authorised will actually be made. The Governor and\r\nDeputy-Governor of the bank represented that the communication,\r\nin order to be effectual and to save from ruin firms which were in\r\nimminent danger, ought to be made forthwith, so that they might be\r\nenabled to announce it on the Stock Exchange before the closing of\r\nbusiness at four o'clock. Viscount Palmerston and Sir George Lewis\r\ntherefore signed at once, and gave to the Governor of the bank the\r\nletter of which the accompanying paper is a copy, the pressure of the\r\nmatter not allowing time to take your Majesty's pleasure beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe state of things now is more urgent than that which existed in\r\n1847, when the similar step was taken; at that time the Reserve Fund\r\nwas about £1,900,000, last night it was only £1,400,000; at that time\r\nthe bullion in the bank was above £8,000,000, it is now somewhat\r\nless than £8,000,000; at that time things were mending, they are now\r\ngetting worse.\r\n\r\nBut however necessary this Measure has been considered, and however\r\nuseful it may be expected to be, it inevitably entails one very\r\ninconvenient consequence. The Government have authorised the bank to\r\nbreak the law, and whether the law shall actually be broken or not,\r\nit would be highly unconstitutional for the Government not to take\r\nthe earliest opportunity of submitting the matter to the knowledge of\r\nParliament. This course was pursued in 1847. The letter from Lord John\r\nRussell and Sir Charles Wood to the Governor of the bank was dated on\r\nthe 25th October, Parliament then stood prorogued in the usual way\r\nto the 11th November, but a council was held on the 31st October, at\r\nwhich your Majesty summoned Parliament to meet for the despatch of\r\nbusiness on the 18th November; and on that day the session was opened\r\nin the usual way by a Speech from the Throne. It would be impossible\r\nunder present circumstances to put off till the beginning of February\r\na communication to Parliament of the step taken to-day.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston therefore would beg to submit for your Majesty's\r\napproval that a Council might be held at Windsor on Monday next, and\r\nthat Parliament might then be summoned to meet in fourteen days. This\r\nwould bring Parliament together in the first days of December, and\r\nafter sitting ten days, or a fortnight, if necessary, it might be\r\nadjourned till the first week in February.[54]\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston submits an explanatory Memorandum which he has\r\njust received for your Majesty's information from the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: The financial crisis had originated in numerous\r\n    stoppages of banks in the United States, where premature\r\n    schemes of railway extension had involved countless investors\r\n    in ruin; in consequence, the pressure on firms and financial\r\n    houses became even more acute than in 1847; see _ante_, vol.\r\n    ii., 14th October, 1847. The bank rate now rose to 10 per cent.\r\n    as against 9 per cent. in that year, and the bank reserve of\r\n    bullion was alarmingly depleted.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: Parliament accordingly met on the 3rd of\r\n    December, and the Session was opened by the Queen in person.\r\n    The Act of Indemnity was passed without serious opposition,\r\n    and a select committee re-appointed to enquire into the\r\n    operation of the Bank Charter Act.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ARMY ESTABLISHMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _18th December 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has had some correspondence with Lord Panmure upon the\r\nEstablishment of the Army for the next financial year.[55] She wishes\r\nnow to lay down the principle which she thinks ought to guide our\r\ndecision, and asks Lord Palmerston to consider it with his colleagues\r\nin Cabinet. Last year we reduced our Army suddenly to a low peace\r\nestablishment to meet the demand for reduction of taxation raised in\r\nthe House of Commons. With this peace establishment we had to meet the\r\nextraordinary demands of India, we have sent almost every available\r\nregiment, battalion, and battery, and are forced to contemplate the\r\ncertainty of a large increase of our force in India as a permanent\r\nnecessity. What the Queen requires is, that a well-considered and\r\ndigested estimate should be made of the additional regiments, etc.,\r\netc., so required, and that after deducting this number from our\r\nestablishment of 1857-1858, that for the next year should be brought\r\nup again to the same condition as if the Indian demand, which is\r\nforeign to our ordinary consideration, had not arisen. If this be done\r\nit will still leave us militarily weaker than we were at the beginning\r\nof the year, for the larger English Army maintained in India will\r\nrequire proportionally more reliefs and larger depôts.\r\n\r\nAs the Indian finances pay for the troops employed in India, the Force\r\nat home and in the colonies will, when raised to its old strength,\r\nnot cost a shilling more than the peace establishment of 1857 settled\r\nunder a pressure of financial reduction.\r\n\r\nAnything less than this will not leave this country in a safe\r\ncondition. The Queen does not ask only for the same number of men as\r\nin 1857-1858, but particularly for Regiments of Cavalry, Battalions\r\nof Infantry and Batteries of Artillery, which alone would enable us in\r\ncase of a war to effect the increase to a war establishment.\r\n\r\nThe Queen encloses her answer to Lord Panmure's last letter.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: On the 14th of December, the Queen had pressed\r\n    the immediate formation of two new Cavalry Regiments.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GOVERNMENT OF INDIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _24th December 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen only now returns to Lord Palmerston the Memorandum\r\ncontaining the Heads of an arrangement for the future Government of\r\nIndia, which the Committee of Cabinet have agreed to recommend. She\r\nwill have an opportunity of seeing Lord Palmerston before the Cabinet\r\nmeet again, and to hear a little more in detail the reasons which\r\ninfluenced the Committee in their several decisions. She wishes only\r\nto recommend two points to Lord Palmerston's consideration: 1st, the\r\nmode of communication between the Queen and the new Government which\r\nit is intended to establish. As long as the Government was that of the\r\nCompany, the Sovereign was generally left quite ignorant of decisions\r\nand despatches; now that the Government is to be that of the\r\nSovereign, and the direction will, she presumes, be given in her name,\r\na direct official responsibility to her will have to be established.\r\nShe doubts whether any one but a Secretary of State could speak in\r\nthe Queen's name, like the Foreign Secretary to Foreign Courts, the\r\nColonial Secretary to the Governors of the Colonies, and the Home\r\nSecretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and the Lieutenants of\r\nthe Counties of Great Britain, the Judges, Convocations, Mayors, etc.,\r\netc. On the other hand, would the position of a Secretary of State\r\nbe compatible with his being President of a Council? The Treasury\r\nand Admiralty act as \"My Lords,\" but they only administer special\r\ndepartments, and do not direct the policy of a country in the Queen's\r\nname. The mixture of supreme direction, and also of the conduct of the\r\nadministration of the department to be directed, has in practice\r\nbeen found as inconvenient in the War Department as it is wrong in\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThe other point is the importance of having only _one_ Army, whether\r\nnative, local, or general, with one discipline and one command,\r\nthat of the Commander-in-Chief. This is quite compatible with first\r\nappointments to the native Army, being vested as a point of patronage\r\nin the members of the Council, but it ought to be distinctly\r\nrecognised in order to do away with those miserable jealousies between\r\nthe different military services, which have done more harm to us in\r\nIndia than, perhaps, any other circumstance.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Lord Palmerston would circulate this letter amongst the\r\nmembers of the Committee who agreed upon the proposed scheme?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF HAVELOCK]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Canning to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE, CALCUTTA, _24th December 1857_.\r\n\r\nLord Canning presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\npermission to express to your Majesty at the earliest opportunity the\r\nrespectful gratitude with which he has received your Majesty's most\r\ngracious letter of the 9th of November.\r\n\r\nHowever certain Lord Canning might have been as to the sentiments with\r\nwhich your Majesty would view the spirit of bitter and unreasoning\r\nvengeance against your Majesty's Indian subjects with which too many\r\nminds are imbued in England as well as in this country, it has been\r\nan indescribable pleasure to him to read what your Majesty has\r\ncondescended to write to him upon this painful topic. Your Majesty's\r\ngracious kindness in the reference made by your Majesty to what is\r\nsaid by the newspapers is also deeply felt by Lord Canning. He can\r\ntruly and conscientiously assure your Majesty of his indifference to\r\nall such attacks--an indifference so complete indeed as to surprise\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLord Canning fears that the satisfaction which your Majesty will have\r\nexperienced very shortly after the date of your Majesty's letter, upon\r\nreceiving the news of Sir Henry Havelock's entry into Lucknow, will\r\nhave been painfully checked by the long and apparently blank interval\r\nwhich followed, and during which your Majesty's anxieties for the\r\nultimate safety of the garrison, largely increased by many precious\r\nlives, must have become more intense than ever. Happily, this suspense\r\nis over; and the real rescue effected by a glorious combination of\r\nskill and intrepidity on the part of Sir Colin Campbell and his troops\r\nmust have been truly gratifying to your Majesty.[56] The defence of\r\nLucknow and the relief of the defenders are two exploits which,\r\neach in their kind, will stand out brightly in the history of these\r\nterrible times.\r\n\r\n... Lord Canning has not failed to transmit your Majesty's gracious\r\nmessage to Sir Colin Campbell, and has taken the liberty to add your\r\nMajesty's words respecting his favourite 93rd, which will not be\r\nless grateful to the brave old soldier than the expression of your\r\nMajesty's consideration for himself.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty has lost two most valuable officers in Sir Henry Havelock\r\nand Brigadier-General Neill. They were very different, however. The\r\nfirst was quite of the old school--severe and precise with his men,\r\nand very cautious in his movements and plans--but in action bold\r\nas well as skilful. The second very open and impetuous, but full of\r\nresources; and to his soldiers as kind and thoughtful of their comfort\r\nas if they had been his children.\r\n\r\nWith earnest wishes for the health and happiness of your Majesty and\r\nthe Prince, Lord Canning begs permission to lay at your Majesty's feet\r\nthe assurance of his most dutiful and devoted attachment.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: Sir Colin Campbell had relieved Lucknow on\r\n    the 17th of November, but Sir Henry Havelock (as he had now\r\n    become) died from illness and exhaustion. General Neill had\r\n    been killed on the occasion of the reinforcement in September,\r\n    _ante_, 12th November, 1857.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ARMY ORGANISATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Panmure._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _29th December 1857_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Panmure's letter and Memorandum of the\r\n24th. She must say that she still adheres to her views as formerly\r\nexpressed. Lord Panmure admits that the two plans don't differ\r\nmaterially in expense. It becomes, then, a mere question of\r\norganisation and of policy. As to the first, all military authorities\r\nof all countries and times agree upon the point that numerous _cadres_\r\nwith fewer men give the readiest means of increasing an army on short\r\nnotice, the main point to be attended to in a constitutional and\r\ndemocratic country like England. As to the second, a system of\r\norganisation will always be easier defended than mere numbers\r\narbitrarily fixed, and Parliament ought to have the possibility of\r\nvoting more or voting fewer men, according to their views of the\r\nexigencies of the country, or the pressure of finance at different\r\ntimes, and to be able to do so without deranging the organisation.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes Lord Panmure will look at our position, as if the\r\nIndian demands had not arisen, and he will find that to come to\r\nParliament with the Cavalry borne on the estimates reduced by three\r\nregiments (as will be the case even after two shall have returned from\r\nIndia, and the two new ones shall have been formed), will certainly\r\nnot prove _too little_ anxiety on the part of the Government to cut\r\ndown our military establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of January of the new year (1858) Prince Frederick William\r\nof Prussia (afterwards the Emperor Frederick) was married, with\r\nbrilliant ceremonial, to the Princess Royal, at the Chapel Royal, St\r\nJames's, an event marked by general national rejoicings; another event\r\nin the private life of the Queen, but one of a melancholy character,\r\nwas the death of the Duchess of Orleans at the age of forty-four.\r\n\r\nA determined attempt was made by Orsini, Pierri, and others, members\r\nof the Carbonari Society, to assassinate the Emperor and Empress of\r\nthe French by throwing grenades filled with detonating powder under\r\ntheir carriage. The Emperor was only slightly hurt, but several\r\nbystanders were killed, and very many more wounded. The plot had been\r\nconceived, and the grenades manufactured in England, and a violently\r\nhostile feeling was engendered in France against this country, owing\r\nto the prescriptive right of asylum enjoyed by foreign refugees. The\r\nFrench _militaires_ were particularly vehement in their language,\r\nand Lord Palmerston so far bowed to the demands of the French Foreign\r\nMinister as to introduce a Bill to make the offence of conspiracy\r\nto murder, a felony instead of, as it had previously been, a\r\nmisdemeanour. The Conservative Party supported the introduction of the\r\nBill, but, on the second reading, joined with eighty-four Liberals\r\nand four Peelites in supporting an Amendment by Mr Milner Gibson,\r\npostponing the reform of the Criminal Law till the peremptory demands\r\nof Count Walewski had been formally answered. The Ministry was\r\ndefeated and resigned, and Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli returned to\r\nOffice. Orsini and Pierri were executed in Paris, but the state trial\r\nin London of a Dr Bernard, a resident of Bayswater, for complicity,\r\nended, mainly owing to the menacing attitude of France over the\r\nwhole question, in an acquittal. The Italian nationality of the chief\r\nconspirators endangered, but only temporarily, the important _entente_\r\nbetween France and Sardinia.\r\n\r\nBefore the resignation of the Ministry, the thanks of both Houses of\r\nParliament were voted to the civil and military officers of India for\r\ntheir exertions in suppressing the Mutiny; the Opposition endeavoured\r\nto obtain the omission of the name of Lord Canning from the address,\r\ntill his conduct of affairs had been discussed. The difficulties in\r\nIndia were not at an end, for Sir Colin Campbell had been unable to\r\nhold Lucknow, and had transferred the rescued garrison to Cawnpore,\r\nwhich he re-occupied. It was not till the end of March that Lucknow\r\nwas captured by the Commander-in-Chief, who was raised to the peerage\r\nas Lord Clyde, after the taking of Jhansi and of Gwalior in Central\r\nIndia, by Sir Hugh Rose, had virtually terminated the revolt.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of the capture of Lucknow, the Governor-General had\r\nprepared a proclamation for promulgation in Oudh, announcing that,\r\nexcept in the case of certain loyal Rajahs, proprietary rights in the\r\nsoil of the province would be confiscated. One copy of the draft was\r\nsent home, and another shown to Sir James Outram, Chief Commissioner\r\nof Oudh, and, in consequence of the latter's protest against its\r\nseverity, as making confiscation the rule and not the exception, an\r\nexemption was inserted in favour of such landowners as should actively\r\nco-operate in restoring order. On receiving the draft in its unaltered\r\nform, Lord Ellenborough, the new President of the Board of Control,\r\nforwarded a despatch to Lord Canning, strongly condemning his action,\r\nand, on the publication of this despatch, the Ministry narrowly\r\nescaped Parliamentary censure. Lord Ellenborough himself resigned,\r\nand was succeeded by Lord Stanley. Attempts had been made by both Lord\r\nPalmerston and Lord Derby to pass measures for the better government\r\nof India. After two Bills had been introduced and withdrawn, the\r\nprocedure by resolution was resorted to, and a measure was ultimately\r\npassed transferring the Government of India to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe China War terminated on the 26th of June, by the treaty of\r\nTien-tsin, which renewed the treaty of 1842, and further opened up\r\nChina to British commerce. A dispute with Japan led to a treaty\r\nsigned at Yeddo by Lord Elgin and the representatives of the Tycoon,\r\nenlarging British diplomatic and trade privileges in that country.\r\n\r\nThe Budget of Mr Disraeli imposed for the first time a penny stamp on\r\nbankers' cheques; a compromise was arrived at on the Oaths question,\r\nthe words \"on the true faith of a Christian\" having hitherto prevented\r\nJews from sitting in Parliament. They were now enabled to take the\r\noath with the omission of these words, and Baron Rothschild took his\r\nseat for the City of London accordingly.\r\n\r\nAmong the other events of importance in the year were the satisfactory\r\ntermination of a dispute with the Neapolitan Government arising out\r\nof the seizure of the _Cagliari_; a modified union, under a central\r\nCommission, of Moldavia and Wallachia; the despatch of Mr Gladstone\r\nby the Conservative Government as High Commissioner to the Ionian\r\nIslands; and the selection of Ottawa, formerly known as Bytown, for\r\nthe capital of the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n1858\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th January 1858_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Accept my warmest thanks for your kind and\r\naffectionate letter of the 8th. I hope and trust to hear that your\r\ncold has left you, and that on Monday I shall have the immense\r\nhappiness of embracing you.\r\n\r\nIt is a time of immense bustle and agitation; I _feel_ it is terrible\r\nto give up one's poor child, and _feel_ very nervous for the coming\r\ntime, and for the departure. But I am glad to see Vicky is quite well\r\nagain and _unberufen_ has got over her cold and is very well. But\r\nshe has had ever since January '57 a succession of emotions and\r\nleave-takings--most trying to any one, but particularly to so young\r\na girl with such _very_ powerful feelings. She is so much improved\r\nin self-control and is so clever (I may say wonderfully so), and so\r\nsensible that we can talk to her of anything--and therefore shall miss\r\nher sadly. But we try _not_ to dwell on or to think of _that_, as I\r\nam sure it is much better _not_ to do so and not get ourselves _émus_\r\nbeforehand, or she will break down as well as we, and that never would\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nTo-day arrive (on a visit _here_) _her_ Court--which is a very good\r\nthing, so that she will get acquainted with them....\r\n\r\nThe affection for her, and the loyalty shown by the country at large\r\non this occasion is _most_ truly gratifying--and for so young a child\r\nreally _very, very_ pleasing to our feelings. The Nation look upon\r\nher, as Cobden said, as \"_England's_ daughter,\" and as if they married\r\na child of their own, which is _very_ satisfactory, and shows, in\r\nspite of a few newspaper follies and absurdities, how really _sound_\r\nand _monarchical_ everything is in this country. Now, with Albert's\r\nlove, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MARRIAGE OF THE PRINCESS ROYAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _9th February 1858_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Accept my warmest thanks for your very kind and\r\naffectionate letter of the 4th, with such kind accounts of our dear\r\nchild, who was so thankful for your kindness and affection, and of\r\nwhose immense and universal success and admirable behaviour--natural\r\nyet dignified--we have the most charming accounts. I send you a letter\r\nfrom Augusta[1] (Mecklenburg), which will give you an idea of the\r\nimpression produced, begging you to let me have it back soon. She is\r\nquite well and _not_ tired. But the separation was _awful_, and the\r\npoor child was _quite_ broken-hearted, particularly at parting from\r\nher dearest beloved papa, whom she _idolises_. _How_ we miss her, I\r\ncan't say, and never having been separated from her since thirteen\r\nyears above a fortnight, I am in a constant fidget and impatience to\r\nknow everything about _every_thing. It is a _great, great_ trial for\r\na _Mother_ who has watched over her child with such anxiety day after\r\nday, to see her far away--dependent on herself! But I have great\r\nconfidence in her good sense, clever head, kind and good heart, in\r\nFritz's excellent character and devotion to her, and in faithful E.\r\nStockmar, who possesses her _entire_ confidence.\r\n\r\nThe blank she has left behind is _very great_ indeed....\r\n\r\nTo-morrow is the eighteenth anniversary of my blessed marriage, which\r\nhas brought such universal blessings on this country and Europe! For\r\n_what_ has not my beloved and perfect Albert done? Raised monarchy to\r\nthe _highest_ pinnacle of _respect_, and rendered it _popular_ beyond\r\nwhat it _ever_ was in this country!\r\n\r\nThe Bill proposed by the Government to improve the law respecting\r\nconspiracy and assassination will pass, and Lord Derby has been most\r\nuseful about it.[2] But people are very indignant here at the conduct\r\nof the French officers, and at the offensive insinuations against this\r\ncountry.[3]....\r\n\r\nHoping to hear that you are quite well, and begging to thank Leopold\r\nvery much for his very kind letter, believe me, your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Elder daughter of Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge,\r\n    and now Grand Duchess-Dowager of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Lord Derby and his party, however, changed their\r\n    attitude in the next few days, and succeeded in putting the\r\n    Government in a minority.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: On the 14th of January, the assassination of the\r\n    French Emperor, which had been planned in England by Felice\r\n    Orsini and other refugees, was attempted. On the arrival\r\n    of the Imperial carriage at the Opera House in the Rue\r\n    Lepelletier, explosive hand-grenades were thrown at it, and\r\n    though the Emperor and Empress were unhurt, ten people were\r\n    either killed outright or died of their wounds, and over one\r\n    hundred and fifty were injured. Notwithstanding the scene of\r\n    carnage, their Majesties maintained their composure and sat\r\n    through the performance of the Opera. In the addresses of\r\n    congratulation to the Emperor on his escape (published, some\r\n    of them inadvertently, in the official _Moniteur_), officers\r\n    commanding French regiments used language of the most\r\n    insulting character to England, and Count Walewski, the French\r\n    Foreign Minister, in a despatch, recommended the British\r\n    Government to take steps to prevent the right of asylum being\r\n    abused.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEFEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _19th February 1858_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and is\r\nsorry to have to inform your Majesty that the Government were beat\r\nthis evening on Mr Milner Gibson's[4] Amendment by a majority of\r\n19,[5] the numbers being for his Amendment, 234, and against it 215.\r\n\r\nMr Milner Gibson began the Debate by moving his Amendment in a speech\r\nof considerable ability, but abounding in misrepresentation, which\r\nnevertheless produced a marked effect upon the House. Mr Baines\r\nfollowed, but only argued the Bill without replying to Mr Gibson's\r\nspeech. This was remarked upon by Mr Walpole, who followed him, and\r\nwho said that though he approved of the Bill he could not vote for\r\nreading it a second time until Count Walewski's despatch had been\r\nanswered. Mr MacMahon supported the Amendment, as did Mr Byng. Sir\r\nGeorge Grey, who followed Mr Walpole, defended the Bill and the course\r\npursued by the Government in not having answered Count Walewski's\r\ndespatch until after the House of Commons should have affirmed the\r\nBill by a Second Reading. Mr Spooner remained steady to his purpose,\r\nand would vote against the Amendment, though in doing so he should\r\ndiffer from his friends. Lord Harry Vane opposed the Amendment, as\r\ninterfering with the passing of the Bill, and Mr Bentinck took the\r\nsame line, and replied to some of the arguments of Mr Milner Gibson.\r\nMr Henley said he should vote for the Amendment. The Lord Advocate\r\nmade a good speech against it. Mr Gladstone spoke with his\r\nusual talent in favour of the Amendment, and was answered by the\r\nAttorney-General in a speech which would have convinced men who had\r\nnot taken a previous determination. He was followed by Mr Disraeli,\r\nwho seemed confident of success, and he was replied to by Viscount\r\nPalmerston, and the House then divided.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Lord Derby had caught at an opportunity of putting the\r\nGovernment in a minority. He saw that there were ninety-nine Members\r\nwho were chiefly of the Liberal Party, who had voted against the Bill\r\nwhen it was first proposed, and who were determined to oppose it in\r\nall its stages. He calculated that if his own followers were to join\r\nthose ninety-nine, the Government might be run hard, or perhaps be\r\nbeaten, and he desired all his friends[6] to support Mr Milner Gibson;\r\non the other hand, many of the supporters of the Government, relying\r\nupon the majority of 200, by which the leave to bring the Bill in had\r\nbeen carried, and upon the majority of 145 of last night, had gone out\r\nof town for a few days, not anticipating any danger to the Government\r\nfrom Mr Gibson's Motion, and thus an adverse division was obtained.\r\nMoreover, Count Walewski's despatch, the tone and tenor of which had\r\nbeen much misrepresented, had produced a very unfavourable effect on\r\nthe mind of members in general, and there was a prevailing feeling\r\nvery difficult to overcome, that the proposed Bill was somehow or\r\nother a concession to the demand of a Foreign Government. The Cabinet\r\nwill have to consider at its meeting at three o'clock to-morrow what\r\ncourse the Government will have to pursue.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Mr Milner Gibson had found a seat at\r\n    Ashton-under-Lyne.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: The Conspiracy Bill aimed at making conspiracy\r\n    to murder a felony, instead of, as it had previously been, a\r\n    misdemeanour, and leave had been given by a large majority to\r\n    introduce it; but when Count Walewski's despatch to Count de\r\n    Persigny came to be published, the feeling gained ground that\r\n    the Government had shown undue subservience in meeting the\r\n    representations of the French Ambassador. The despatch had\r\n    not actually been answered, although verbal communications had\r\n    taken place. The opposition to the Bill was concerted by Lord\r\n    John Russell and Sir James Graham; see Parker's _Sir James\r\n    Graham_, vol. ii. p. 236, and the observation of the Prince,\r\n    _post_, 21st February, 1858. The purport of the Amendment was\r\n    to postpone any reform in the criminal law till the French\r\n    despatch had been replied to.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: See Ashley's _Life of Lord Palmerston_, vol. ii.\r\n    p. 146.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: RESIGNATION OF THE GOVERNMENT]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY SUMMONED]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: OFFER TO LORD DERBY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _21st February 1858_.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston came at five o'clock from the Cabinet, and tendered\r\nhis resignation in his own name, and that of his Colleagues. The\r\nCabinet had well considered their position and found that, as the vote\r\npassed by the House, although the result of an accidental combination\r\nof parties, was virtually a vote of censure upon their conduct, they\r\ncould not with honour or with any advantage to the public service\r\ncarry on the Government.\r\n\r\nThe combination was the whole of the Conservative Party (Lord Derby's\r\nfollowers), Lord John Russell, the Peelites, with Mr Gladstone and\r\nthe whole of the Radicals; but the Liberal Party generally is just now\r\nvery angry with Lord Palmerston personally, chiefly on account of his\r\napparent submission to French dictation, and the late appointment of\r\nLord Clanricarde as Privy Seal, who is looked upon as a reprobate.[7]\r\nLord Clanricarde's presence in the House of Commons during the Debate,\r\nand in a conspicuous place, enraged many supporters of Lord Palmerston\r\nto that degree that they voted at once with the Opposition.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Since his triumph at the polls in 1857, Lord\r\n    Palmerston had been somewhat arbitrary in his demeanour, and\r\n    had defied public opinion by taking Lord Clanricarde into the\r\n    Government, after some unpleasant disclosures in the Irish\r\n    Courts. While walking home on the 18th, after obtaining an\r\n    immense majority on the India Bill, he was told by Sir Joseph\r\n    Bethell that he ought, like the Roman Consuls in a triumph,\r\n    to have some one to remind him that he was, as a minister, not\r\n    immortal. Next day he was defeated.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen wrote to Lord Derby the letter here following;[8] he came a\r\nlittle after six o'clock. He stated that nobody was more surprised\r\nin his life than he had been at the result of the Debate, after the\r\nGovernment had only a few days before had a majority of more than 100\r\non the introduction of their Bill. He did not know how it came about,\r\nbut thought it was the work of Lord John Russell and Sir James Graham\r\nin the interest of the Radicals; Mr Gladstone's junction must have\r\nbeen accidental. As to his own people, they had, owing to his\r\nown personal exertions, as the Queen was aware, though many very\r\nunwillingly, supported the Bill; but the amendment of Mr Milner Gibson\r\nwas so skilfully worded, that it was difficult for them not to vote\r\nfor it; he had to admit this when they came to him to ask what they\r\nshould do, merely warning them to save the Measure itself, which the\r\nAmendment did. He then blamed the Government very much for leaving\r\nCount Walewski's despatch unanswered before coming before Parliament,\r\nwhich he could hardly understand.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Summoning him to advise her.]\r\n\r\nOn the Queen telling him that the Government had resigned, and that\r\nshe commissioned him to form a new Administration, he begged that\r\nthis offer might not be made to him without further consideration, and\r\nwould state clearly his own position. After what had happened in 1851\r\nand 1855, if the Queen made the offer he _must_ accept it, for if he\r\nrefused, the Conservative Party would be broken up for ever. Yet\r\nhe would find a majority of two to one against him in the House of\r\nCommons, would have difficulty in well filling the important offices,\r\nfound the external and internal relations of the country in a\r\nmost delicate and complicated position, war in India and in China,\r\ndifficulties with France, the Indian Bill introduced and a Reform\r\nBill promised; nothing but the forbearance and support of some of his\r\nopponents would make it possible for him to carry on any Government.\r\nThe person who was asked first by the Sovereign had always a great\r\ndisadvantage; perhaps other combinations were possible, which, if\r\nfound not to answer, would make him more readily accepted by the\r\ncountry. The position of Lord Palmerston was a most curious one,\r\nthe House of Commons had been returned chiefly for the purpose of\r\nsupporting him _personally_, and he had obtained a working majority\r\nof 100 (unheard of since the Reform Bill), yet his supporters had no\r\nprinciples in common and they generally suspected him; the question of\r\nthe Reform Bill had made him and Lord John run a race for popularity\r\nwhich might lead to disastrous consequences. Lord Derby did not at all\r\nknow what support he would be able to obtain in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Queen agreed to deferring her offer, and to take further time for\r\nconsideration on the understanding that if she made it it would at\r\nonce be accepted. Lord Derby expressed, however, his fear that the\r\nresignation of the Palmerston Cabinet might only be for the purpose of\r\ngoing through a crisis in order to come back again with new strength,\r\nfor there existed different kinds of resignations, some for this\r\npurpose, others really for abandoning office.\r\n\r\nA conversation which I had with Lord Clarendon after dinner, convinced\r\nme that the Cabinet had sent in their resignations from the real\r\nconviction of the impossibility to go on with honour and success; all\r\noffers of the friends of the Government to pass a vote of confidence,\r\netc., etc., had been rejected. Lord Derby was the only man who could\r\nform a Government; Mr Gladstone would probably join him. The whole\r\nmove had been planned, and most dexterously, by Sir James Graham.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _21st February 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has reconsidered the question of the formation of a new\r\nGovernment as she had settled with Lord Derby yesterday, and now\r\nwrites to him to tell him that further reflection has only confirmed\r\nher in her former resolution to offer the task to Lord Derby. The\r\nresignation of the present Government is the result of a conscientious\r\nconviction on their part, that, damaged by the censure passed upon\r\nthem in the House of Commons, they cannot with honour to themselves,\r\nor usefulness to the country, carry on public affairs, and Lord\r\nDerby is at the head of the only Party which affords the materials\r\nof forming a new Government, is sufficiently organised to secure a\r\ncertain support, and which the country would accept as an alternative\r\nfor that hitherto in power. Before actually offering any specific\r\noffice to anybody, Lord Derby would perhaps have another interview\r\nwith the Queen; but it would be right that he should have satisfied\r\nhimself a little as to his chances of strengthening his hands before\r\nshe sees him. With regard to the position of the India Bill, the Queen\r\nmust also have a further conversation with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S VIEW]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _21st February 1858_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, begs your Majesty to accept his\r\ngrateful acknowledgment of the signal mark of your Majesty's favour,\r\nwith which he has this morning been honoured. Encouraged by your\r\nMajesty's gracious confidence, he does not hesitate to submit himself\r\nto your Majesty's pleasure, and will address himself at once to the\r\ndifficult task which your Majesty has been pleased to entrust to him.\r\nHe fears that he can hardly hope, in the formation of a Government,\r\nfor much extrinsic aid; as almost all the men of eminence in either\r\nHouse of Parliament are more or less associated with other parties,\r\nwhose co-operation it would be impossible to obtain. Lord Derby will\r\nnot, however, hesitate to make the attempt in any quarters, in which\r\nhe may think he has any chance of success. With regard to the filling\r\nup of particular offices, Lord Derby would humbly beg your Majesty to\r\nbear in mind that, although among his own personal friends there will\r\nbe every desire to make individual convenience subservient to the\r\npublic interest, yet among those who are not now politically connected\r\nwith him, there may be some, whose co-operation or refusal might\r\nbe greatly influenced by the office which it was proposed that they\r\nshould hold; and, in such cases, Lord Derby must venture to bespeak\r\nyour Majesty's indulgence should he make a definite offer, subject, of\r\ncourse, to your Majesty's ultimate approval.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Lord Derby has made any progress in his proposed\r\narrangements, he will avail himself of your Majesty's gracious\r\npermission to solicit another Audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _21st February 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord Derby's letter, and would wish under\r\nall circumstances to see him at six this evening, in order to hear\r\nwhat progress he has made in his plans. The two offices the Queen is\r\nmost anxious should not be prejudged in any way, before the Queen has\r\nseen Lord Derby again, are the Foreign and the War Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR GLADSTONE AND LORD GREY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _21st February 1858_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty the two\r\nletters which he has this evening received from Lord Grey and Mr\r\nGladstone.[9] The reasons contained in the latter do not appear to\r\nLord Derby to be very conclusive; but he fears the result must be that\r\nhe cannot look, in the attempt to form a Cabinet, to much extraneous\r\nassistance. With deep regret Lord Derby is compelled to add that he\r\nfinds he cannot rely with certainty on the support of his son as a\r\nmember of his proposed Cabinet.[10] Still, having undertaken the task\r\nhe has in obedience to your Majesty's commands, Lord Derby will not\r\nrelax in his efforts to frame such a Government as may be honoured\r\nwith your Majesty's gracious approval, and prove itself equal to the\r\nemergency which calls it together.\r\n\r\nWhile in the very act of putting up this letter, Lord Derby has\r\nreceived one, which he also presumes to enclose to your Majesty,\r\nfrom Lord St Leonards, alleging his advanced age as a reason for not\r\naccepting the Great Seal which he formerly held. This reply has been\r\nwholly unexpected; and it is yet possible that Lord St Leonards may be\r\ninduced, at least temporarily, to withdraw his resignation. Should it,\r\nhowever, prove otherwise, and Lord Derby should succeed in making his\r\nother arrangements, he would humbly ask your Majesty's permission to\r\nendeavour to persuade Mr Pemberton Leigh to accept that high office,\r\nof course accompanied by the honour of the Peerage, which he is aware\r\nhas been already on more than one occasion offered to him. Lord Derby\r\nbegs to add that he has not had the slightest communication with\r\nMr Pemberton Leigh on the subject, nor has the least idea as to his\r\nfeelings upon it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Lord Grey wrote--\"I am much obliged to you for\r\n    the manner in which you have asked my assistance in performing\r\n    the task confided to you by Her Majesty.\r\n\r\n    \"I am not insensible to the danger of the present crisis, or\r\n    to the duty it imposes on public men, of giving any aid\r\n    in their power towards forming an Administration which may\r\n    command respect. I am also aware that the settlement of the\r\n    important political questions, on which we have differed,\r\n    has removed many of the obstacles which would formerly have\r\n    rendered my acting with you impracticable. Upon the other\r\n    hand, upon carefully considering the present state of affairs\r\n    and the materials at your disposal (especially in the House\r\n    of Commons) for forming an Administration, and that all the\r\n    political friends with whom I have been connected, would\r\n    probably be opposed to it, I do not think it would be either\r\n    useful to you or honourable to myself that I should singly\r\n    join your Government.\"\r\n\r\n    Mr Gladstone wrote--\"I am very sensible of the importance of\r\n    the vote taken on Friday, and I should deeply lament to see\r\n    the House of Commons trampled on in consequence of that vote.\r\n    The honour of the House is materially involved in giving it\r\n    full effect. It would therefore be my first wish to aid, if\r\n    possible, in such a task; and remembering the years when\r\n    we were colleagues, I may be permitted to say that there is\r\n    nothing in the fact of your being the Head of a Ministry,\r\n    which would avail to deter me from forming part of it.\r\n\r\n    \"Among the first questions I have had to put to myself in\r\n    consequence of the offer, which you have conveyed to me in\r\n    such friendly and flattering terms, has been the question,\r\n    whether it would be in my power by accepting it, either alone,\r\n    or in concert with others, to render you material service.\r\n\r\n    \"After the long years, during which we have been separated,\r\n    there would be various matters of public interest requiring to\r\n    be noticed between us; but the question I have mentioned is a\r\n    needful preliminary.\r\n\r\n    \"Upon the best consideration which the moment allows, I think\r\n    it plain that alone, as I must be, I could not render you\r\n    service worth your having.\r\n\r\n    \"The dissolution of last year excluded from Parliament men\r\n    with whom I had sympathies, and it in some degree affected the\r\n    position of those political friends with whom I have now for\r\n    many years been united, through evil and (much more rarely)\r\n    good report.\r\n\r\n    \"Those who lament the rupture of old traditions may well\r\n    desire the reconstruction of a Party; but the reconstitution\r\n    of a Party can only be effected, if at all, by the return of\r\n    the old influences to their places, and not by the junction of\r\n    one isolated person.\r\n\r\n    \"The difficulty is now enhanced in my case by the fact that in\r\n    your party, reduced as it is at the present moment in numbers,\r\n    there is a small but active and not unimportant section, who\r\n    avowedly regard me as the representative of the most dangerous\r\n    ideas. I should thus, unfortunately, be to you a source of\r\n    weakness in the heart of your own adherents, while I should\r\n    bring you no Party or group of friends to make up for their\r\n    defection or discontent.\r\n\r\n    \"For the reasons which I have thus stated or glanced at, my\r\n    reply to your letter must be in the negative.\r\n\r\n    \"I must, however, add that a Government formed by you at this\r\n    time will in my opinion have strong claims upon me, and upon\r\n    any one situated as I am, for favourable presumptions, and\r\n    in the absence of conscientious difference on important\r\n    questions, for support.\r\n\r\n    \"I have had an opportunity of seeing Lord Aberdeen and Sidney\r\n    Herbert, and they fully concur in the sentiment I have just\r\n    expressed.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: See _ante_, 31st October, 1855, note 87.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE CHANCELLORSHIP]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _22nd February 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen acknowledges Lord Derby's letter of yesterday, and returns\r\nhim these three letters. She much regrets that he cannot reckon on the\r\nsupport and assistance in the Government, which he is about to form,\r\nof such able men. The Queen authorises Lord Derby to offer the office\r\nof Lord Chancellor with a Peerage to Mr Pemberton Leigh; but she fears\r\nfrom what passed on previous occasions that he is not likely to accept\r\nit.[11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: He declined the office, and the Great Seal was\r\n    offered to and accepted by Sir Frederick Thesiger, who was\r\n    created Lord Chelmsford.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _22nd February 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has had a long conversation with the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nwhich however ended, as Lord Derby will have expected from what the\r\nDuke must have told him, in his declaring his conviction that he could\r\nbe of no use to the new Government by joining it, or in persuading his\r\nfriends to change their minds as to joining.

Lord Malmesbury hopes and believes that much of the\r\nexcitement that prevailed on the _other_ side the water is subsiding.\r\nAll his letters from _private_ sources, and the account of Colonel\r\nClaremont, agree on this point. In this country, if our differences\r\nwith France are settled, it is probable that the popular jealousy of\r\nforeign interference will be killed; but at least for some time it\r\nwill show foreign Courts how dangerous it is _even to criticise_ our\r\n_domestic_ Institutions. Lord Malmesbury has carefully abstained from\r\ngiving Lord Cowley or M. de Persigny the slightest hope that we could\r\nalter the law, but has confined himself to saying that the law was\r\nitself as much on its trial as the prisoners Bernard and Truelove.[13]\r\nIf, therefore, the law should prove to be a phantom of justice, or\r\nanomalous in its action, whatever measures your Majesty's Government\r\nmay hereafter take to reform it, it will be received by France as an\r\nunexpected boon and a proof of good faith and amity.\r\n\r\nIn attending to the idea referred to by your Majesty that the Emperor\r\ntook the oath of the Assassins' Society, Lord Malmesbury can almost\r\nassure your Majesty that such is not the case.[14] Lord Malmesbury\r\nfirst made His Majesty's acquaintance in Italy when they were both\r\nvery young men (twenty years of age). They were _both_ under the\r\ninfluence of those romantic feelings which the former history and\r\nthe present degradation of Italy may naturally inspire even at a more\r\nadvanced time of life--and the Prince Louis Napoleon, to the knowledge\r\nof Lord Malmesbury, certainly engaged himself in the conspiracies of\r\nthe time--but it was with the higher class of the Carbonari, men like\r\nGeneral Sercognani and General Pépé. The Prince used to talk to Lord\r\nMalmesbury upon these men and their ideas and plans with all the\r\nopenness that exists between two youths, and Lord Malmesbury has many\r\ntimes heard him condemn with disgust the societies of villains which\r\nhung on the flank of the conspirators, and which deterred many of the\r\nbest families and ablest gentlemen in Romagna from joining them. Lord\r\nMalmesbury believes the report therefore to be a fable, and at some\r\nfuture period will, if it should interest your Majesty, relate to\r\nyour Majesty some details respecting the Emperor's share in the\r\nconspiracies of 1828-1829....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: This was a letter from the Prince de Chimay to\r\n    the King of the Belgians in reference to the Orsini plot.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Before Lord Palmerston's Government had retired,\r\n    Simon Bernard, a resident of Bayswater, was committed\r\n    for trial for complicity in the Orsini _attentat_. He was\r\n    committed for conspiracy only, but, at the instance of the\r\n    new Government, the charge was altered to one of feloniously\r\n    slaying one of the persons killed by the explosion. As this\r\n    constructive murder was actually committed on French soil,\r\n    Bernard's trial had, under the existing law, to be held before\r\n    a Special Commission, over which Lord Campbell presided. The\r\n    evidence overwhelmingly established the prisoner's guilt,\r\n    but, carried away by the eloquent, if irrelevant, speech of Mr\r\n    Edwin James for the defence, the jury acquitted him. Truelove\r\n    was charged with criminal libel, for openly approving, in\r\n    a published pamphlet, Orsini's attempt, and regretting\r\n    its failure. The Government threw up the prosecution,\r\n    pusillanimously in the judgment of Lord Campbell, who records\r\n    that he carefuly studied, with a view to his own hearing\r\n    of the case, the proceedings against Lord George Gordon for\r\n    libelling Marie Antoinette, against Vint for libelling the\r\n    Emperor Paul, and against Peltier for libelling Napoleon I.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: The Queen had written:--\"There are people\r\n    who pretend that the Emperor, who was once a member of the\r\n    Carbonari Club of Italy, and who is supposed to be condemned\r\n    to death by the rules of that Secret Society for having\r\n    violated his oath to them, has offered them to pardon Orsini,\r\n    if they would release him from his oath, but that the Society\r\n    refused the offer. The fact that all the attempts have been\r\n    made by Italians, Orsini's letter, and the almost mad state of\r\n    fear in which the Emperor seems to be now, would give colour\r\n    to that story.\" Orsini had written two letters to the Emperor,\r\n    one read aloud at his trial by his counsel, Jules Favre, the\r\n    other while lying under sentence of death.

As the\r\nChancellor of Exchequer read the sketch of the Resolutions in his box,\r\nthis was amusing; he undertook the responsibility, thus urged, and\r\nalmost menaced; Lord John, though greatly mortified at not bringing\r\nin the Resolutions himself, for it is since known they were prepared,\r\nentirely and justly acquits Chancellor of Exchequer of any arrogance\r\nand intrusion, and the affair concludes in a manner dignified and more\r\nthan promising.

The Queen is anxious not to\r\nadd to Lord Derby's difficulties, but she must not leave unnoticed the\r\nfact that the despatch in question ought never to have been written\r\nwithout having been submitted to the Queen.

He said he had received\r\na copy of Lord Ellenborough's letter, and had told him that should\r\nthe Queen consult him (Lord Derby) he should advise her to accept the\r\nresignation, Lord Ellenborough had behaved in the handsomest\r\nmanner, and expressed his belief that he had brought bad luck to the\r\nGovernment, for this was now the second difficulty into which they had\r\ngot by his instrumentality, the first having been the Election Clause\r\nin the India Bill. Lord Derby hoped that this resignation would stop\r\nthe vote of censure in the House of Commons, as the House could not\r\nhold responsible and punish the Cabinet for that with which they had\r\nhad no concern. If the House persisted, it was clear that the motives\r\nwere factious, and he hoped the Queen would allow him to threaten a\r\nDissolution of Parliament, which he was certain would stop it. The\r\nQueen refused to give that permission; she said he might leave it\r\nquite undecided whether the Queen would grant a Dissolution or not,\r\nand take the benefit of the doubt in talking to others on the subject;\r\nbut she must be left quite free to act as she thought the good of the\r\ncountry might require at the time when the Government should have been\r\nbeat; there had been a Dissolution within the year, and if a Reform\r\nBill was passed there must be another immediately upon it; in the\r\nmeantime most violent pledges would be taken as to Reform if a general\r\nelection were to take place now. Lord Derby concurred in all this, and\r\nsaid he advised the threat particularly in order to render the reality\r\nunnecessary; when she persisted in her refusal, however, on the\r\nground that she could not threaten what she was not prepared to do, he\r\nappeared very much disappointed and mortified.\r\n\r\nWe then discussed the state of the question itself, and urged the\r\nnecessity of something being done to do away with the injurious\r\nimpression which the publication of the despatch must produce in\r\nIndia, as the resignation of Lord Ellenborough left this quite\r\nuntouched, and Parliament might with justice demand this. He agreed,\r\nafter much difficulty, to send a telegraphic despatch, which might\r\novertake and mitigate the other. On my remark that the public were\r\nunder the impression that there had been collusion, and that Mr Bright\r\nhad seen the despatch before he asked his question for its production,\r\nhe denied this stoutly, but let us understand that Mr Bright had\r\nknown of the existence of such a despatch, and had wished to put his\r\nquestion before, but had been asked to defer it until Lord Canning's\r\nProclamation should have appeared in the newspapers! (This is nearly\r\nas bad!!) The Queen could not have pledged herself to dissolve\r\nParliament in order to support such tricks!\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that Lord Derby should accept Lord Ellenborough's\r\nresignation in the Queen's name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Ellenborough._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _11th May 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge Lord Ellenborough's letter, which she did\r\nnot wish to do before she had seen Lord Derby.\r\n\r\nThe latter has just left the Queen, and will communicate to Lord\r\nEllenborough the Queen's acceptance of his resignation, which he has\r\nthought it right to tender to her from a sense of public duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S DESPATCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE [_11th May_].\r\n(9 P.M., _Tuesday_.)\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty the\r\nexpression of his hope that the discussion, or rather conversation,\r\nwhich has taken place in the House of Lords this evening, may have\r\nbeen not only advantageous to the Government, but beneficial in its\r\nresults to the public service....\r\n\r\nAfter the discussion, Lord Ellenborough made his statement; and it is\r\nonly doing bare justice to him to say that he made it in a manner\r\nand spirit which was most highly honourable to himself, and was fully\r\nappreciated by the House.\r\n\r\nPublic sympathy was entirely with him, especially when he vindicated\r\nthe policy which he had asserted, but took upon himself the whole\r\nand sole responsibility of having authorised the publication of the\r\ndespatch--which he vindicated--and announced his own resignation\r\nrather than embarrass his colleagues. Lord Grey shortly entered\r\nhis protest against bringing into discussion the policy of the\r\nProclamation and of the consequent despatch, into which Lord\r\nEllenborough had certainly entered too largely, opposing, very\r\nbroadly, the principle of confiscation against that of clemency. Lord\r\nDerby followed Lord Grey, and after an interruption on a point of\r\nform, vindicated the policy advocated in Lord Ellenborough's despatch,\r\nat the same time that he expressed not only his hope, but his belief,\r\nthat in practice the Governor-General would be found (and more\r\nespecially judging from the alterations inserted in the last\r\nProclamation of which an unofficial copy has been received) acting\r\non the principles laid down in Lord Ellenborough's despatch. In the\r\ntribute which he felt it his duty to pay to the personal, as well as\r\npolitical, character of Lord Ellenborough, the House concurred with\r\nentire unanimity and all did honour to the spirit which induced him\r\nto sacrifice his own position to the public service; and to atone, and\r\nmore than atone, for an act of indiscretion by the frank avowal that\r\nhe alone was responsible for it. Lord Derby thinks that the step which\r\nhas been taken may, even probably, prevent the Motions intended to\r\nbe made on Friday; and if made, will, almost certainly, result in a\r\nmajority for the Government.\r\n\r\nLord Derby believes that he may possibly be in time to telegraph\r\nto Malta early to-morrow, to Lord Canning. In that case he will\r\ndo himself the honour of submitting to your Majesty a copy of the\r\nmessage[31] sent, though he fears it will be impossible to do\r\nso before its despatch. He proposes in substance to say that the\r\npublication has been disapproved--that Lord Ellenborough has resigned\r\nin consequence--but that your Majesty's Government adhere in principle\r\nto the policy laid down in the despatch of 19th April, and entertain\r\nan earnest hope that the Governor-General, judging from the\r\nmodifications introduced into the amended Proclamation, has, in fact,\r\nthe intention of acting in the same spirit; but that your Majesty's\r\nGovernment are still of opinion that confiscation of private property\r\nought to be made the exception, and not the rule, and to be enforced\r\nonly against those who may stand out after a certain day, or who may\r\nbe proved to have been guilty of more than ordinary crimes.\r\n\r\nLord Derby hopes that your Majesty will excuse a very hasty sketch of\r\na very large subject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: _The Earl of Derby to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    _12th May 1858._\r\n\r\n    Send on the following message to Lord Canning by the Indian\r\n    mail.\r\n\r\n    The publication of the Secret Despatch of 19th April has\r\n    been disapproved. Lord Ellenborough has resigned office. His\r\n    successor has not been appointed. Nevertheless the policy\r\n    indicated in the above despatch is approved by Her Majesty's\r\n    Government. Confiscation of property of private individuals\r\n    (Talookdars and others) ought to be the exception and not the\r\n    rule. It ought to be held out as a penalty on those who do not\r\n    come in by a given day. From your amended Proclamation it\r\n    is hoped that such is your intention. Let it be clearly\r\n    understood that it is so. You were quite right in issuing no\r\n    Proclamation till after a signal success. That once obtained,\r\n    the more generous the terms, the better. A broad distinction\r\n    must be drawn between the Talookdars of Oudh and the Sepoys\r\n    who have been in our service.

Lord\r\nEllenborough's despatch,[32] now before her for the first time, is\r\nvery good and just in principle. But the Queen would be much surprised\r\nif it did not entirely coincide with the views of Lord Canning, at\r\nleast as far as he has hitherto expressed any in his letters. So are\r\nalso the sentiments written by Sir J. Lawrence; they contain almost\r\nthe very expressions frequently used by Lord Canning.\r\n\r\nSir J. Login,[33] who holds the same opinion, and has great Indian\r\nexperience, does not find any fault with the Proclamation, however\r\nseemingly it may sound at variance with these opinions, and this on\r\naccount of the peculiar position of affairs in Oudh. It is a great\r\npity that Lord Ellenborough, with his knowledge, experience, activity,\r\nand cleverness, should be so entirely unable to submit to general\r\nrules of conduct. The Queen has been for some time much alarmed at his\r\nwriting letters of his own to all the most important Indian Chiefs\r\nand Kings explaining his policy. All this renders the position of a\r\nGovernor-General almost untenable, and that of the Government at home\r\nvery hazardous.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: This was a later despatch of Lord\r\n    Ellenborough's, also in reference to the pacification of Oudh,\r\n    and not shown to the Cabinet before it was sent.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: See _ante_, 23rd September, 1857, note 41.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD ABERDEEN CONSULTED]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: PREROGATIVE OF DISSOLUTION]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: STATE OF PARTIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Sir Charles Phipps._\r\n\r\n[_Undated._ ? _15th May 1858._]\r\n\r\nUpon being admitted to Lord Aberdeen, I informed him that the Queen\r\nand Prince were anxious to hear his opinion upon the present most\r\nunfortunate state of affairs, but that, knowing how easily every event\r\nwas perverted in such times as the present, Her Majesty and His\r\nRoyal Highness had thought that it might have been subject to\r\nmisapprehension had he been known to have been at Buckingham Palace,\r\nand that I had been therefore directed to call upon him, with a view\r\nof obtaining his opinion and advice upon certain important points.\r\n\r\nThe first was the question of a Dissolution of Parliament in the\r\nevent of the Government being defeated upon the question which was at\r\npresent pending. I told him that I was permitted to communicate to him\r\nin the strictest confidence, that in a late Audience which Lord Derby\r\nhad with the Queen, he had asked her permission to be allowed to\r\nannounce that, in the event of an adverse majority, he had Her\r\nMajesty's sanction to a Dissolution of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThat the Queen had declined to give such sanction, or even such a\r\npledge, and equally guarded herself against being supposed to have\r\nmade up her mind to refuse her sanction to a Dissolution, had told\r\nLord Derby that she could not then make any prospective decision\r\nupon the subject. I told him that in point of fact Her Majesty was\r\ndisinclined to grant to Lord Derby her authority for a Dissolution,\r\nbut that the Queen had at once refused to grant to Lord Derby her\r\nsanction for making the announcement he wished, as she considered that\r\nit would be a very unconstitutional threat for him to hold over the\r\nhead of the Parliament, with her authority, by way of biassing their\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen interrupted me by saying that the Queen had done quite\r\nright--that he never heard of such a request being made, or authority\r\nfor such an announcement being sought--and he could not at all\r\nunderstand Lord Derby making such an application. He knew that the\r\nGovernment had threatened a Dissolution, that he thought that they had\r\na perfect right to do so, but that they would have been quite wrong in\r\njoining the Queen's name with it.\r\n\r\nHe said that he had never entertained the slightest doubt that if\r\nthe Minister advised the Queen to dissolve, she would, as a matter\r\nof course, do so. The Minister who advised the Dissolution took upon\r\nhimself the heavy responsibility of doing so, but that the Sovereign\r\nwas bound to suppose that the person whom she had appointed as a\r\nMinister was a gentleman and an honest man, and that he would not\r\nadvise Her Majesty to take such a step unless he thought that it\r\nwas for the good of the country. There was no doubt of the power and\r\nprerogative of the Sovereign to refuse a Dissolution--it was one\r\nof the very few acts which the Queen of England could do without\r\nresponsible advice at the moment; but even in this case whoever\r\nwas sent for to succeed, must, with his appointment, assume\r\nthe responsibility of this act, and be prepared to defend it in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nHe could not remember a single instance in which the undoubted power\r\nof the Sovereign had been exercised upon this point, and the advice of\r\nthe Minister to dissolve Parliament had been rejected--for it was\r\nto be remembered that Lord Derby would be still at this time her\r\nMinister--and that the result of such refusal would be that the Queen\r\nwould take upon herself the act of dismissing Lord Derby from office,\r\ninstead of his resigning from being unable longer to carry on the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had during her reign, and throughout the numerous changes\r\nof Government, maintained an unassailable position of constitutional\r\nimpartiality, and he had no hesitation in saying that he thought it\r\nwould be more right, and certainly more safe, for her to follow the\r\nusual course, than to take this dangerous time for exercising an\r\nunusual and, he believed he might say, an unprecedented, course,\r\nthough the power to exercise the authority was undoubted.\r\n\r\nHe said that he did not conceive that any reasons of expediency as\r\nto public business, or the possible effects of frequent general\r\nelections, would be sufficient grounds for refusing a Dissolution (and\r\nreasons would have to be given by the new Minister in Parliament),\r\nand, as he conceived, the only possible ground that could be\r\nmaintained as foundation for such an exercise of authority would be\r\nthe fearful danger to the existence of our power in India, which\r\nmight arise from the intemperate discussion upon every hustings of\r\nthe proceedings of the Government with respect to that country--as the\r\nquestion proposed to the country would certainly be considered to be\r\nseverity or mercy to the people of India.\r\n\r\nUpon the second point, as to a successor to Lord Derby in the event\r\nof his resignation, he said that the Queen would, he thought, have no\r\nalternative but to send for Lord Palmerston. The only other person who\r\ncould be suggested would be Lord John Russell, and he was neither\r\nthe mover of the Resolutions which displaced the Government, nor the\r\nostensible head of the Opposition, which the late meeting at Cambridge\r\nHouse pointed out Lord Palmerston to be. That he was not very fond of\r\nLord Palmerston, though he had forgiven him all, and he had had _much_\r\nto forgive; and that in the last few days it had appeared that he had\r\nless following than Lord John; but the Queen could not act upon such\r\ndaily changing circumstances, and it was evident that Lord Palmerston\r\nwas the ostensible man for the Queen to send for.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen seemed very low upon the state of public affairs. He\r\nsaid that the extreme Liberals were the only Party that appeared to\r\ngain strength. Not only was the Whig Party divided within itself,\r\nhated by the Radicals, and having a very doubtful support from the\r\nindependent Liberals, but even the little band called the Peelites had\r\nentirely crumbled to pieces. In the House of Lords, whilst the Duke of\r\nNewcastle voted with the Opposition, he (Lord Aberdeen) had purposely\r\nabstained from voting, whilst, in the House of Commons, Cardwell moved\r\nthe Resolution, and Mr Sidney Herbert would, he believed, vote for it;\r\nGladstone would speak on the other side, and Sir J. Graham would also\r\nvote with the Government.\r\n\r\nHe concluded by saying that if the majority against the Government\r\nwas a very large one, he thought that Lord Derby ought not to ask to\r\ndissolve; but that he knew that the members of the Government had said\r\nthat the present Parliament was elected upon a momentary Palmerstonian\r\ncry, and was quite an exceptional case, and that they would not\r\nconsent to be driven from office upon its verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND DISSOLUTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _16th May 1858_.\r\n\r\nWe saw Lord Derby after church. He brought interesting letters from\r\nLord Canning to Lord Ellenborough, of which copies follow here. It\r\nis evident that Lord Canning thinks that he is taking a most merciful\r\ncourse, and expects pacification from his \"Proclamation,\" attributing\r\nthe slow coming in of the chiefs to the Proclamation not being yet\r\nsufficiently known.\r\n\r\nLord Ellenborough's, and indeed the Government's, hearts, must have\r\nhad curious sensations in reading Lord Canning's frank declaration,\r\nthat he did not mean to resign on hearing of the formation of the Tory\r\nGovernment unless told to do so, and he had no fears that he would\r\nbe treated in a way implying want of confidence to make him resign,\r\nfeeling safe as to that in Lord Ellenborough's hands!\r\n\r\nLord Derby spoke much of the Debate, which he expects to go on for\r\nanother week. He expects to be beaten by from 15 to 35 votes under\r\npresent circumstances, but thinks still that he could be saved if it\r\nwere known that the Queen had not refused a Dissolution, which was\r\nstoutly maintained by Lord Palmerston's friends. He begged again to\r\nbe empowered to contradict the assertion. The Queen maintained that it\r\nwould be quite unconstitutional to threaten Parliament, and to use\r\nher name for that purpose. Lord Derby quite agreed, and disclaimed any\r\nsuch intention, but said there were modes of letting the fact be known\r\nwithout any risk. We agreed that we could not enter into such details.\r\nThe Queen allowed him (Lord Derby) to know that a Dissolution would\r\nnot be refused to him, and trusted that her honour would be safe in\r\nhis hands as to the use he made of that knowledge. He seemed greatly\r\nrelieved, and stated that had he had to resign, he would have\r\nwithdrawn from public business, and the Conservative Party would have\r\nbeen entirely, and he feared for ever, broken up. On a Dissolution he\r\nfelt certain of a large gain, as the country was in fact tired of the\r\n\"Whig Family Clique\"; the Radicals, like Mr Milner Gibson, Bright,\r\netc., would willingly support a Conservative Government.\r\n\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COLLAPSE OF THE ATTACK]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._[34]\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _21st May 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer with his humble duty to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe fullest House; it is said 620 Members present; it was supposed we\r\nshould have divided at three o'clock in the morning; Mr Gladstone\r\nwas to have spoken for the Government at half-past ten--very great\r\nexcitement--when there occurred a scene perhaps unprecedented in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nOne after another, perhaps twenty Members, on the Opposition benches,\r\nrising and entreating Mr Cardwell to withdraw his Resolution. After\r\nsome time, silence on the Government benches, Mr Cardwell went to\r\nLord John Russell, then to Lord Palmerston, then to Lord John Russell\r\nagain, then returned to Lord Palmerston, and retired with him.\r\n\r\nWhat are called the interpellations continued, when suddenly Lord\r\nPalmerston reappeared; embarrassed, with a faint smile; addressed the\r\nHouse; and after various preluding, announced the withdrawal of the\r\nMotion of Censure.\r\n\r\nA various Debate followed; the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nendeavouring, as far as regards Lord Canning, to fulfil your Majesty's\r\nwishes. It is impossible to estimate the importance of this unforeseen\r\nevent to your Majesty's servants. It has strengthened them more\r\nthan the most decided division in their favour, for it has revealed\r\ncomplete anarchy in the ranks of their opponents. With prudence and\r\nvigilance all must now go right.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Sir James Graham last night produced a very great\r\neffect. No report gives a fair idea of it. The great country\r\ngentleman, the broad views, the fine classical allusions, the happiest\r\nall omitted, the massy style, contrasted remarkably with Sir Richard\r\nBethell.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: Lord Shaftesbury's Motion in the Lords had been\r\n    lost by a majority of nine. In the Commons, Mr Cardwell was\r\n    replied to in a brilliant speech by Sir Hugh Cairns, the\r\n    Solicitor-General. The speeches of Sir James Graham, Mr\r\n    Bright, and others, showed that the Opposition was disunited,\r\n    and when it was understood that Mr Gladstone would support the\r\n    Ministry, the Liberal attack collapsed. Mr Disraeli, deprived\r\n    of the satisfaction of making an effective reply, subsequently\r\n    compared the discomfiture of his opponents to an earthquake\r\n    in Calabria or Peru. \"There was,\" he said, in the course of\r\n    a speech at Slough, \"a rumbling murmur, a groan, a shriek, a\r\n    sound of distant thunder. No one knew whether it came from the\r\n    top or bottom of the House. There was a rent, a fissure in\r\n    the ground, and then a village disappeared, then a tall tower\r\n    toppled down, and the whole of the Opposition benches became\r\n    one great dissolving view of anarchy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: OFFER TO MR GLADSTONE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _23rd May 1858_.\r\n(_Sunday night._)\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, gratefully acknowledges your\r\nMajesty's gracious letter just received, and the telegraphic message\r\nwith which he was honoured in answer to his on Friday night. Your\r\nMajesty can hardly be expected to estimate, at a distance from the\r\nimmediate scene of action, the effect of the event of that evening.\r\nIt was the utter explosion of a well-constructed mine, under the feet,\r\nnot of the assailed, but of the assailants; and the effect has been\r\nthe greater from the immense attendance in London of Members of the\r\nHouse of Commons. No effort had been spared. Lord Castlerosse, only\r\njust married, had been sent for from Italy--but Lord Derby hopes that\r\nhe had not been induced to come--for nothing. It is said that of\r\nthe 654 Members of whom the House is composed, 626 were actually\r\nin London. The Government could rely on 304 to 308, and the whole\r\nquestion turned on the absence, or the conversion, of a small number\r\nof \"Liberal\" Members. The result is to be attributed to two causes;\r\nfirst, and principally, to the fear of a Dissolution, and to the\r\ngrowing conviction that in case of necessity your Majesty would\r\nsanction such a course, which had been strenuously denied by Lord\r\nPalmerston--and in which Lord Derby hopes that your Majesty will have\r\nseen that your Majesty's name has never, for a moment, been brought in\r\nquestion; and secondly, to the effect produced by the correspondence\r\nbetween the Governor-General and Sir James Outram.[35] And here\r\nLord Derby may perhaps be allowed the opportunity of removing a\r\nmisconception from your Majesty's mind, as to any secret intelligence\r\nor underhand intrigue between Lord Ellenborough and Sir James Outram,\r\nto the detriment of Lord Canning. Lord Derby is in the position\r\nto know that if there is one person in the world to whom Lord\r\nEllenborough has an utter aversion, and with whom he has no personal\r\nor private correspondence, it is Sir James Outram. Anything therefore\r\nin common in their opinions must be the result of circumstances wholly\r\nirrespective of private concert. Lord Derby has written fully to Lord\r\nCanning, privately, by the mail which will go out on Tuesday; and\r\nwhile he has not concealed from him the opinion of your Majesty's\r\nservants that the Proclamation, of which so much has been said,\r\nconveyed too sweeping an Edict of Confiscation against the landowners,\r\ngreat and small, of Oudh, he has not hesitated to express also his\r\nconviction that Lord Canning's real intentions, in execution, would\r\nnot be found widely to differ from the views of your Majesty's\r\nservants. He has expressed to Lord Canning his regret at the premature\r\n_publication_ of the Draft Proclamation, at the same time that he has\r\npointed out the injustice done both to your Majesty's Government\r\nand to the Governor-General by the (Lord Derby will hardly call\r\nit fraudulent) suppression of the private letters addressed to the\r\nPresident of the Board of Control, and deprecating judgment on the\r\ntext of the Proclamation, until explanation should be received. Lord\r\nDerby cannot but be of opinion that this suppression, of which Lord\r\nPalmerston was fully cognisant, was an act which no political or party\r\ninterests were sufficient to justify.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Government, during the late crisis, was such as\r\nto render it impossible to make any arrangement for filling up Lord\r\nEllenborough's place at the Board of Control. Application has since\r\nbeen made to Mr Gladstone,[36] with the offer of that post, or of that\r\nof the Colonial Department, which Lord Stanley would give up for the\r\nconvenience of your Majesty's Government, though unwillingly, for\r\nIndia. Mr Gladstone demurred, on the ground of not wishing to leave\r\nhis friends; but when pressed to name whom he would wish to bring with\r\nhim, he could name none. Finally, he has written to ask advice as to\r\nhis course of Sir James Graham, who has returned to Netherby, and\r\nof Lord Aberdeen; and by them he will probably be guided. Should he\r\nfinally refuse, Lord Stanley _must_ take India; and the Colonies must\r\nbe offered in the first instance to Sir E. B. Lytton, who probably\r\nwill refuse, as he wants a Peerage, and is doubtful of his\r\nre-election; and failing him, to Sir William Heathcote, the Member for\r\nthe University of Oxford, who, without official experience, has great\r\nParliamentary knowledge and influence, and, if he will accept, is\r\nquite equal to the duties of the office. Lord Derby trusts that your\r\nMajesty will forgive this long intrusion on your Majesty's patience.\r\nHe has preferred the risk of it, to leaving your Majesty uninformed as\r\nto anything which was going on, or contemplated....\r\n\r\nIf Lord Dalhousie should be in a state to converse upon public\r\naffairs, there is no one with whom Lord Derby could confer more\r\nconfidentially than with him; nor of whose judgment, though he regrets\r\nto differ with him as to the annexation of Oudh, he has a higher\r\nopinion. He will endeavour to ascertain what is his present state\r\nof health, which he fears is very unsatisfactory, and will see and\r\nconverse with him, if possible.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: Especially Outram's remonstrance against what he\r\n    considered the excessive severity of the Proclamation.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: See Mr Disraeli's curious letter printed in\r\n    Morley's _Gladstone_, vol. i. p. 587, asking Mr Gladstone\r\n    whether the time had not come when he might deign to be\r\n    magnanimous.

She has heard from Mr Disraeli to-day relative to the\r\nanswer given by him to the question asked yesterday in the House of\r\nCommons as to what the Government meant to do.[37] He says that he\r\nhears there are rumours of other Motions on the subject. These the\r\nQueen hopes there will be no difficulty in defeating.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge seems rather uneasy altogether, but the Queen,\r\nthough equally anxious about it, owns she cannot contemplate\r\nthe possibility of any _real_ attempt to divest the Crown of its\r\nprerogative in this instance. The Army will not, she feels sure, stand\r\nit for a moment, and the Queen feels sure, that if properly defined\r\nand explained, the House of Commons will not acquiesce in any such\r\ndisloyal proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe Queen does not understand Lord John Russell's voting with the\r\nmajority, for she never understood him to express any such opinion.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: A question was asked whether it was the\r\n    intention of the Government to take any step in consequence\r\n    of a resolution of the House in favour of placing the\r\n    whole administration and control of the Army under the sole\r\n    authority of a single Minister. Mr. Disraeli replied that\r\n    \"considering the great importance of the subject,... the\r\n    comparatively small number of Members in the House when\r\n    the division took pace, and the bare majority by which the\r\n    decision was arrived at, Her Majesty's Government do not feel\r\n    that it is their duty to recommend any measure in consequence\r\n    of that resolution.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GOVERNMENT OF INDIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _24th June 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer with his humble duty to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe India Bill was read a second time without a division.[38] Lord\r\nStanley made a clear and vigorous exposition of its spirit and\r\nprovisions; Mr Bright delivered a powerful oration on the condition\r\nof India--its past government and future prospects; the rest of the\r\ndiscussion weak and desultory.\r\n\r\nNo serious opposition apprehended in Committee, which the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer has fixed for this day (Friday)[39] and almost hopes\r\nthat he may conclude the Committee on Monday. He proposes to proceed\r\nwith no other business until it is concluded.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bill has passed, the temper of the House, and its sanitary\r\nstate,[40] will assist him in passing the remaining estimates with\r\nrapidity; and he contemplates an early conclusion of the Session.\r\n\r\nIt will be a great thing to have carried the India Bill, which Mr\r\nThomas Baring, to-night, spoke of in terms of eulogy, and as a\r\ngreat improvement on the project of the late Government. It is, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer really thinks, a wise and well-digested\r\nmeasure, ripe with the experience of the last five months of\r\ndiscussion; but it is only the antechamber of an imperial palace; and\r\nyour Majesty would do well to deign to consider the steps which are\r\nnow necessary to influence the opinions and affect the imagination of\r\nthe Indian populations.

She will only refer to the\r\nclauses concerning the Indian Civil Service and the right of peace and\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first, the regulations under which servants of\r\nthe Crown are to be admitted or examined have always been an undoubted\r\nright and duty of the Executive; by the clause introduced by Lord\r\nStanley the system of \"Competitive Examination\" has been confirmed by\r\nAct of Parliament. That system may be right or wrong; it has since\r\nits introduction been carried on under the Orders in Council; now\r\nthe Crown and Government are to be deprived of any authority in the\r\nmatter, and the whole examinations, selection, and appointments,\r\netc., etc., are to be vested in the Civil Commissioners under a\r\nParliamentary title.\r\n\r\nAs to the right of the Crown to declare war and make peace, it\r\nrequires not a word of remark; yet Lord Stanley agrees to Mr\r\nGladstone's proposal to make over this prerogative with regard to\r\nIndian questions to Parliament under the auspices of the Queen's\r\nGovernment; she is thus placed in a position of less authority than\r\nthe President of the American Republic.[41]\r\n\r\nWhen a Bill has been introduced into Parliament, after having received\r\nthe Sovereign's approval, she has the right to expect that her\r\nMinisters will not subsequently introduce important alterations\r\nwithout previously obtaining her sanction. In the first of the two\r\ninstances referred to by the Queen, Lord Stanley introduced the\r\nalteration himself; in the second he agreed to it even without asking\r\nfor a moment's delay; and the Opposition party, which attempted to\r\nguard the Queen's prerogative, was overborne by the Government Leader\r\nof the House.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must remind Lord Derby that it is to him as the head of the\r\nGovernment that she looks for the protection of those prerogatives\r\nwhich form an integral part of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: An important amendment made at the instance\r\n    of Mr Gladstone provided that, except for repelling actual\r\n    invasion or upon urgent necessity, the Queen's Indian forces\r\n    should not be employed in operations outside India, without\r\n    Parliamentary sanction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _16th July 1858_.\r\n\r\nMY TRULY BELOVED VICTORIA,--Nothing can be _kinder_ or more\r\n_affectionate_ than your dear letter of the 13th, and it would\r\nhave done _your warm heart_ good to have _seen how much I have been\r\ndelighted and moved by it_.

Bulwer Lytton's letter.[44] If the name\r\nof New Caledonia is objected to as being already borne by another\r\ncolony or island claimed by the French, it may be better to give the\r\nnew colony west of the Rocky Mountains another name. New Hanover,\r\nNew Cornwall, and New Georgia appear from the maps to be the names of\r\nsub-divisions of that country, but do not appear on all maps. The only\r\nname which is given to the whole territory in every map the Queen has\r\nconsulted is \"Columbia,\" but as there exists also a Columbia in South\r\nAmerica, and the citizens of the United States call their country\r\nalso Columbia, at least in poetry, \"British Columbia\" might be, in the\r\nQueen's opinion, the best name.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Stating that objections were being made in\r\n    France to the name of New Caledonia being given to the\r\n    proposed colony between the Pacific and the Rocky Mountains.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ARMY COMMISSIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _29th July 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has been placed in a most unpleasant dilemma by the last\r\nvote in the House of Commons;[45] she feels all the force of Lord\r\nDerby's objections to risking another defeat on the same question and\r\nconverting the struggle into one against the Royal Prerogative; yet,\r\non the other hand, she can hardly sit still, and from mere want of\r\ncourage become a party to the most serious inroad which has yet\r\nbeen made upon it. It is the introduction of the principle into\r\nour legislation that the Sovereign is no longer the source of all\r\nappointments under the Crown, but that these appointments are the\r\nproperty of individuals under a Parliamentary title, which the Queen\r\nfeels bound to resist. Lord John Russell's Motion and Sir James\r\nGraham's speech only went to the Civil appointments; but after their\r\nMotion had been carried on a division, Lord Stanley gave way to Sir\r\nDe Lacy Evans also with regard to a _portion of the Army!_ If this\r\nprinciple is recognised and sanctioned by the entire legislature, its\r\nfuture extension can no longer be resisted on constitutional grounds,\r\nand Lord John in fact reminded Lord Stanley that the latter had\r\nstated that he only refrained from making the application general from\r\nthinking it _premature_, himself being of opinion that it ought to\r\nbe carried further, and yet its extension to the Army reduces the\r\nSovereign to a mere signing machine, as, to carry the case to its\r\nextreme consequence, _Law_ would _compel_ her to sign the Commission\r\nfor the officers, and they might have the right to sue at law for the\r\nrecovery of their property vested in them by Act of Parliament (viz.,\r\ntheir Commissions) if the Crown doubted for any reason the fitness of\r\nan appointment!! Have these consequences been considered and brought\r\ndistinctly before Parliament? It strikes the Queen that all the\r\nCommons want is a Parliamentary security against the abolition of the\r\nCompetitive System of Examinations by the Executive. Can this not\r\nbe obtained by means less subversive of the whole character of our\r\nConstitution? The Queen cannot believe that Lord Derby could not find\r\nmeans to come to some agreement with the Opposition, and she trusts he\r\nwill leave nothing undone to effect this.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: The Lords Amendments on the subject of\r\n    competitive examination were rejected by a majority of\r\n    thirteen in the Commons, and, in the circumstances, Lord Derby\r\n    had advised abiding by the decision and not risking another\r\n    defeat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: NAVAL ESTIMATES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _2nd August 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen feels it her duty to address a few lines to Lord Derby on\r\nthe subject of the reports made to Sir John Pakington on the subject\r\nof the French Naval preparations, to which she has already verbally\r\nadverted when she saw Lord Derby last. These reports reveal a state\r\nof things of the greatest moment to this country. It will be the first\r\ntime in her history that she will find herself in an absolute minority\r\nof ships on the sea! and this inferiority will be much greater\r\nin reality than even apparent, as our fleet will have to defend\r\npossessions and commerce all over the world, and has even in Europe\r\na strategical line to hold extending from Malta to Heligoland, whilst\r\nFrance keeps her fleet together and occupies the centre of that line\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks it irreconcilable with the duty which the Government\r\nowes to the country to be aware of this state of things without\r\nstraining every nerve to remedy it. With regard to men in whom we\r\nare also totally deficient in case of an emergency, a Commission of\r\nEnquiry is sitting to devise a remedy; but with regard to our ships\r\nand dockyards we require action, and immediate action. The plan\r\nproposed by the Surveyor of the Navy appears to the Queen excessively\r\nmoderate and judicious, and she trusts that the Cabinet will not\r\nhesitate to empower its execution, bearing in mind that £200,000\r\nspent now will probably do more work during the six or nine months\r\nfor working before us, than £2,000,000 would if voted in next year's\r\nestimate, letting our arrears in the dockyards, already admitted to\r\nbe very great, accumulate in the interval. Time is most precious under\r\nthese circumstances!\r\n\r\nIt is true that this sum of money would be in excess of the estimates\r\nof last Session, but the Queen feels sure that on the faith of the\r\nreports made by the Admiralty, the Government would find no difficulty\r\nin convincing Parliament that they have been good stewards of\r\nthe public money, in taking courageously the responsibility upon\r\nthemselves to spend judiciously what is necessary, and that the\r\ncountry will be deeply grateful for the honesty with which they will\r\nhave served her.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes Lord Derby to communicate this letter to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBABELSBERG, _15th August 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has asked Lord Malmesbury to explain in detail to Lord Derby\r\nher objections to the draft of Proclamation for India. The Queen\r\nwould be glad if Lord Derby would write it himself in his excellent\r\nlanguage, bearing in mind that it is a female Sovereign who speaks\r\nto more than 100,000,000 of Eastern people on assuming the direct\r\nGovernment over them after a bloody civil war, giving them pledges\r\nwhich her future reign is to redeem, and explaining the principles of\r\nher Government. Such a document should breathe feelings of generosity,\r\nbenevolence, and religious feeling, pointing out the privileges which\r\nthe Indians will receive in being placed on an equality with the\r\nsubjects of the British Crown, and the prosperity following in the\r\ntrain of civilisation.[46]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: The draft Proclamation was accordingly altered\r\n    so as to be in strict harmony with the Queen's wishes.

Yet a House of Commons, having been elected solely for the\r\nobject, and on the ground of supporting Lord Palmerston personally\r\n(an instance in our Parliamentary history without parallel), holds him\r\nsuddenly in such abhorrence, that not satisfied with having upset his\r\nGovernment, which had been successful in all its policy, and thrown\r\nhim out, it will hardly listen to him when he speaks. He is frequently\r\nreceived with hooting, and throughout the last Session it sufficed\r\nthat [he] took up any cause for the whole House voting against\r\nit, even if contrary to the principles which they had themselves\r\nadvocated, merely to have the satisfaction of putting him into a\r\nminority. How can this be accounted for? The man who was without\r\nrhyme or reason stamped the only _English_ statesman, the champion of\r\nliberty, the man of the people, etc., etc., now, without his having\r\nchanged in any one respect, having still the same virtues and the same\r\nfaults that he always had, young and vigorous in his seventy-fifth\r\nyear, and having succeeded in his policy, is now considered the head\r\nof a clique, the man of intrigue, past his work, etc., etc.--in fact\r\nhated! and this throughout the country. I cannot explain the enigma\r\nexcept by supposing that people had before joined in a cry which they\r\nthought was popular without themselves believing what they said and\r\nwrote, and that they now do the same; that the Radicals used his name\r\nto destroy other statesmen and politicians, and are destroying him now\r\nin his turn; that they hoped to govern through him, and that they\r\nsee a better chance now of doing it through a weak and incapable Tory\r\nGovernment which has entered into a secret bargain for their support.\r\nStill the phenomenon remains most curious.[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Charles Greville, in his Journal (16th June 1858), noted\r\nthe same circumstance, and drew the inference that Palmerston's public\r\ncareer was drawing to a close.]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston himself remains, outwardly at least, quite cheerful,\r\nand seems to care very little about his reverses; he speaks on all\r\nsubjects, bids for the Liberal support as before, even at the expense\r\nof his better conviction (as he used to do), and keeps as much as\r\npossible before the public; he made an official tour in Ireland, and\r\nis gone to visit the Emperor Napoleon at Paris; his Chinese policy\r\nupon which the general Dissolution had taken place in 1857 has just\r\nbeen crowned by the most complete success by the advantageous treaty\r\nsigned at Pekin by Lord Elgin; and yet even for this the public will\r\nnot allow him any credit.

With respect to the relations between his office and Her Majesty,\r\nhe said he was conscious that they had been conducted with great\r\ndeficiency of form, and, in many respects, in an unsatisfactory\r\nmanner; but he attributed all this to the inexperience and \"sheer\r\nignorance\" of a Department which had not been accustomed to direct\r\ncommunication with the Crown. Some portion of this, he said, he had\r\nalready remedied, and he wished to remedy all, though he experienced\r\ndifficulties, on some of which he consulted me.\r\n\r\nHe accepted, without reserve, and cordially, my position, that he must\r\nact always as the Minister of the Queen, and not of the Council, but\r\nhe said I took an exaggerated view of his relations with that body;\r\nthat he thoroughly knew their respective places, and should be\r\nvigilant that they did [? not] overstep their limits; that he had\r\nnever been, of which he reminded me, an admirer of the East India\r\nCompany, and had no intention of reviving their system; that the\r\nincident of submitting the legal case to the Council, etc., had\r\noriginated in a demand on the part of the Commander-in-Chief, which\r\ninvolved, if complied with, a grant of money, and that, under these\r\ncircumstances, an appeal to the Council was inevitable.\r\n\r\n2. He agreed with me, that, on all military matters, he would\r\nhabitually communicate with the Commander-in-Chief, and take His Royal\r\nHighness's advice on all such points; and that copies of all military\r\npapers, as I understood Lord Stanley, should be furnished to His Royal\r\nHighness.\r\n\r\n3. Having arrived at this point, I laid before him the views\r\nrespecting _military unity_, which formed the subject matter of\r\nrecent conversations. Lord Stanley assented to the principles which\r\nI attempted to enforce; and in reply to my reminding him that the\r\nold military system of India had entirely broken down, he said\r\nhe contemplated terminating the independent authority of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief at the inferior Presidencies, and of\r\nestablishing the absolute and complete authority of Her Majesty's\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India. He did not seem to see his way to any\r\nfurther step at present, and I did not think it judicious on this\r\noccasion to press the subject further.\r\n\r\nThroughout this interview, Lord Stanley's manner was candid, very\r\nconciliatory, and, for him, even soft. He was pleased to say that it\r\nwas a source of great satisfaction to him that your Royal Highness had\r\ndeigned to confer confidentially with me on the subject, and make me,\r\nas it were, a \"Mediator\" on matters which, he assured me with great\r\nemphasis, had occasioned him an amount of anxiety almost intolerable.\r\n\r\nHe had recurred, in the course of this interview, to a suggestion\r\nwhich he had thrown out on Tuesday, viz. that the difficulties of the\r\nposition might be removed, or greatly mitigated, by his retirement\r\nfrom the office, and accepting, if his continuance in the Government\r\nwas desirable, another post. I therefore thought it best at once to\r\npoint out to him that such a course of proceeding would only aggravate\r\nall the inconveniences and annoyances at present existing; that his\r\nretirement would be the signal for exaggerated rumours and factious\r\nmachinations, and would have the most baneful effect on the discussion\r\nin Parliament generally of all those military topics with which we\r\nwere threatened; that, far from being satisfactory to Her Majesty and\r\nyour Royal Highness, I was convinced that the Queen and yourself would\r\nhear of such an intention with regret.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley ultimately adopted entirely this view of his position,\r\nand he parted from me with an earnest expression of his hope that the\r\npainful misconceptions which had prevailed might at once, or at least\r\nin due course, entirely disappear.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is a very imperfect report of an important interview, but,\r\nas I collected from Lord Stanley, that nothing was really settled in\r\nhis conference on Tuesday with Lord Derby and the Lord Chancellor, I\r\nhave thought it my duty, without loss of time, to forward it to your\r\nRoyal Highness, and have the honour to remain, ever, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and sincerely obliged Servant,\r\n\r\nB.

I am glad that you made it\r\nclear to him that the Queen had never connected in her mind the\r\nobjections which she felt bound to take with anything personal,\r\nwhich could be removed by Lord Stanley's relinquishing the Indian\r\nSecretaryship. The difficulty would still remain to be solved, only\r\nunder additional complication and disadvantage. Lord Derby told me\r\nto-day that he was drawing up a Memorandum which, when seen by the\r\nChancellor and Lord Stanley, was to be submitted to the Queen. Ever\r\nyours truly,\r\n\r\nALBERT.[50]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: On the same day Lord Stanley wrote a lengthy\r\n    letter to the Queen justifying the course he had taken.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE INDIA OFFICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord Stanley_.\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _20th November 1858._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Stanley's letter entering into the subject\r\nof the difficulties which have arisen in the conduct of the new Indian\r\nDepartment. She had from the first foreseen that it would not be\r\nan easy matter to bring the establishments of the old Company's\r\nGovernment to fall into the practice and usages of the Constitutional\r\nMonarchy, and was therefore most anxious that distinct rules should\r\nbe laid down before the installation of the new Government, which\r\nunfortunately was not done, but she trusts will now be devised and\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe Queen most readily gives Lord Stanley credit for every intention\r\nto remove the obstacles in the way of the solution of these\r\ndifficulties as far as he was able, but she cannot but fear that the\r\nparticular form in which the opinion of the Law Officers has been\r\nasked, and the fact [that] the eighteen members of the Council (all\r\nnaturally wedded to a system under which they were trained) were made\r\nparties to the discussion between herself and her Secretary of State\r\non these difficulties--must increase instead of diminishing them.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Mr Temple, together with the last printed letters\r\nand Memoranda from the Punjab, give us serious cause of apprehension\r\nfor the future, and show that the _British_ Army is the only safeguard\r\nat present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD CANNING'S PROCLAMATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Canning._[51]\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _2nd December 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen acknowledges the receipt of Lord Canning's letter of the\r\n19th October, which she received on the 29th November, which has given\r\nher great pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of great satisfaction and pride to her to feel herself\r\nin direct communication with that enormous Empire which is so bright a\r\njewel of her Crown, and which she would wish to see happy, contented,\r\nand peaceful. May the publication of her Proclamation be the beginning\r\nof a new era, and may it draw a veil over the sad and bloody past!\r\n\r\nThe Queen rejoices to hear that her Viceroy approves this passage\r\nabout Religion.[52] She strongly insisted on it. She trusts also that\r\nthe certainty of the Amnesty remaining open till the 1st January may\r\nnot be productive of serious evil.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must express our admiration of Lord Canning's own\r\nProclamation, the wording of which is beautiful. The telegram received\r\nto-day brings continued good news, and announces her proclamation\r\nhaving been read, and having produced a good effect.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes to hear from Lord Canning, whenever he can spare time\r\nto write. She misses hearing from Lady Canning, not having heard from\r\nher since the 30th August; but the Queen fears that she is herself\r\nto blame, as she has not written to Lady Canning for a long time; she\r\nintends doing so by the next mail....\r\n\r\nBoth the Prince and herself hope that Lord Canning's health is now\r\nperfectly good, as well as dear Lady Canning's.

It is in the same\r\nsense as your Majesty's, and states that if he is anxious to improve\r\nthe lot of the worst governed country, namely the Papal States, he\r\nshould, instead of sulking with Austria, make an attempt with his\r\nCatholic brother to ameliorate the Papal Government. It is not for\r\nProtestant England to take the initiative, as her object would be\r\nmisunderstood and attributed to sectarian motives; but England could\r\ngive her moral support, and even her material aid _eventually_, if\r\nit were required to establish an improved Administration of the\r\nRoman States. Austria would gain by having a quiet frontier. The\r\ncorrespondence which took place in 1856 and 1857 between Lord\r\nClarendon and Mr Lyons shows that this is the only effective way of\r\nameliorating the condition of Italy without a war.\r\n\r\nLord Malmesbury thinks he can assure your Majesty that none is\r\nat present contemplated by the Emperor Napoleon (who has just\r\ncontradicted the report officially), and Count Buol is of the same\r\nopinion. The latter is constantly hurting the vanity of the French\r\nGovernment by his irritable despatches, and neither party makes the\r\nslightest effort to command their temper; but it appears impossible\r\nthat Napoleon can make a _casus belli_ against Austria. Besides this,\r\nyour Majesty may be assured that no warlike preparations are making in\r\nFrance, such as must precede such a plan as an Italian war.\r\n\r\nLord Malmesbury entirely agrees with your Majesty that it is desirable\r\nthat His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales should visit and remain\r\nat Rome incognito. It is also indispensable that when there His Royal\r\nHighness should receive no foreigner or stranger _alone_, so that\r\nno reports of pretended conversations with such persons could be\r\ncirculated without immediate refutation by Colonel Bruce.

Mr Walpole and Mr Henley\r\nthereupon withdrew from the Ministry, and Lord John Russell,\r\nfrom below the gangway, proposed an Amendment, protesting against\r\ninterference with the established freehold franchise, and calling for\r\na larger extension of the suffrage in towns. Lord Palmerston and the\r\nLiberal Opposition supported the Amendment, while Mr Gladstone, who\r\nwas opposed to most of the provisions of the Bill, supported it in\r\npreference to the Amendment, pleading, at the same time, for the\r\nretention of the small boroughs. The Ministry were defeated, and\r\nParliament thereupon dissolved, but not until the civil functionaries\r\nand all ranks of the native and European army had received its thanks\r\nfor the final suppression of the Indian Mutiny. The Ministry gained\r\ntwenty-five seats at the polls, but were still in a minority, and as\r\nsoon as it was known that Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston were\r\nreconciled, the end was in sight. A hostile Amendment to the\r\nAddress was carried by a majority of thirteen, but on Lord Derby's\r\nresignation, the Queen was placed in a dilemma by the competing claims\r\nof Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, who had each been Prime\r\nMinister and leader of the Liberal Party. Unwilling to be compelled to\r\ndecide between them, she called upon Lord Granville to form a\r\nMinistry representative of all sections of the Liberal Party; but the\r\ndifficulties proved insuperable, and Lord Palmerston eventually formed\r\na Ministry in which the Whigs, the Peelites, and the Manchester\r\nSchool were all represented, though Mr Cobden declined to join the\r\nGovernment. Mr Gladstone, who had returned from the mission he had\r\nundertaken for the Derby Cabinet, and voted with them in the critical\r\ndivision, became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and kept his seat for\r\nOxford University by a majority of nearly two hundred.\r\n\r\nThe continent of Europe was the scene of a contest between Austria on\r\nthe one hand, who was struggling to maintain her position in Italy,\r\nand France with Sardinia on the other. Sardinia, under the guidance of\r\nCavour, had joined the alliance of England and France against Russia;\r\nand in July 1858 an interview at Plombières, under rather mysterious\r\ncircumstances, between Cavour and Louis Napoleon, led to effective\r\nconfederacy; a marriage, arranged or suggested at the same time,\r\nbetween Princess Clothilde of Sardinia and a cousin of the Emperor,\r\nbrought the two illustrious houses still closer together. In the\r\nspring of 1859, Sardinia prepared to take up arms to resist Austrian\r\npredominance, and the assistance of the guerilla leader, Garibaldi,\r\nwas obtained. Count Cavour, in reply to interrogatories from the\r\nBritish Government, stated officially his grievances against Austria,\r\nwhile Lord Malmesbury despatched Lord Cowley on a special mission to\r\nVienna to mediate between Austria and France. In April, however,\r\nafter a curt summons to the Sardinians to disarm had been disregarded,\r\nAustria invaded Piedmont, and Victor Emmanuel placed himself at the\r\nhead of his army. The first engagement took place, with unfavourable\r\nresults to the Austrians, at Montebello, followed by French victories\r\nat Palestro and Magenta. A revolution had meanwhile taken place in\r\nFlorence. The Grand Duke had fled, and a Commissioner to administer\r\nthe affairs of the Grand Duchy had been appointed by the King\r\nof Sardinia with the assent of the Tuscans, who now joined the\r\nFranco-Sardinian alliance, while risings also took place in Parma and\r\nModena. The Austrians were again defeated at Malegnano, and, on the\r\n8th of June, the French Emperor and King Victor Emmanuel entered Milan\r\namid great enthusiasm. The bloody action of Solferino was fought\r\non the 24th of June, but on the 11th of July a treaty of peace was,\r\nsomewhat unexpectedly, concluded between the French and Austrian\r\nEmperors at Villafranca, under which an Italian Confederation was to\r\nbe erected, Lombardy substantially ceded to Sardinia, the Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany and the Duke of Modena reinstated, and Venetia, though\r\nincluded in the Confederation, to remain subject to the Imperial Crown\r\nof Austria; these preliminaries were subsequently converted into\r\na definite treaty at Zurich. Meanwhile, the newly constituted\r\nrepresentative Assemblies in Tuscany, Romagna, and the Duchies,\r\nunanimously pronounced for incorporation in the kingdom of Victor\r\nEmmanuel.\r\n\r\nAt home, on the 14th of October, the Queen opened the Glasgow\r\nwaterworks at the outflow of Loch Katrine, the construction of which\r\nhad necessitated engineering operations at that time considered\r\nstupendous; a few days later an appalling shipping calamity occurred,\r\nin the wreck of the _Royal Charter_ near Anglesey, and the loss of 459\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n1859\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _7th January 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns Mr Gladstone's letters, and gladly accepts his\r\npatriotic offer.[1] He will have difficulty in solving a delicate\r\nquestion, affecting national feeling, against time, but his offer\r\ncomes most opportunely.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: See _ante_, 1st November, 1858. Mr Gladstone\r\n    had been sent to enquire into the causes of the\r\n    dissatisfaction of the inhabitants of the Ionian Islands\r\n    with their High Commissioner, Sir John Young. He now\r\n    offered to act himself for a limited time as High\r\n    Commissioner, should it be decided to recall Sir John.\r\n    He was succeeded in February by Sir Henry Storks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: NATIONAL DEFENCES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _13th January 1859_.\r\n\r\nAs the Cabinet are now meeting, and will probably come to a decision\r\nabout the estimates for the year, the Queen thinks it her duty to\r\nurge upon them in the strongest manner her conviction that, under the\r\npresent aspect of political affairs in Europe, there will be no safety\r\nto the honour, power, and peace of this country except in Naval and\r\nMilitary strength. The extraordinary exertions which France is making\r\nin her Naval Department oblige us to exercise the utmost vigour to\r\nkeep up a superiority at sea, upon which our very existence may be\r\nsaid to depend, and which would be already lost at any moment that\r\nFrance were to be joined by any other country possessing a Navy.[2]\r\nThe war in India has drained us of every available Battalion. We\r\npossess at this moment only fourteen old Battalions of the Line within\r\nthe three kingdoms, and twelve Second Battalions newly raised, whilst\r\nour Mediterranean possessions are under-garrisoned, and Alderney has\r\nnot as yet any garrison at all. Under these circumstances the\r\nQueen has heard it rumoured that the Government intend to propose a\r\nreduction on the estimates of 9,000 men for this year. She trusts that\r\nsuch an idea, if ever entertained, will upon reflection be given up\r\nas inconsistent with the duty which the Government owe to the country.\r\nEven if it were said that these 9,000 men have only existed on paper,\r\nand have not yet been raised, such an act at this moment would be\r\nindefensible; for it would require a proof that circumstances have\r\narisen which make it desirable to ask for fewer troops than were\r\nconsidered requisite when the last estimates were passed, which really\r\ncannot be said to be the case! To be able to raise at any time an\r\nadditional 9,000 men (in political danger) without having to go to\r\nParliament for a supplementary vote and spreading alarm thereby, must\r\nbe of the utmost value to the Government, and if not wanted, the vote\r\nwill entail no additional expense.\r\n\r\nEngland will not be listened to in Europe, and be powerless for the\r\npreservation of the general peace, which must be her first object\r\nunder the present circumstances, if she is known to be despicably\r\nweak in her military resources, and no statesman will, the Queen\r\napprehends, maintain that if a European war were to break out she\r\ncould hope to remain long out of it. For peace and for war, therefore,\r\nan available Army is a necessity to her.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes Lord Derby to communicate this letter to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: The French Emperor had signalised the opening of\r\n    a new year by an ominous speech. To M. Hübner, the Austrian\r\n    Ambassador at Paris, who had attended, with the other foreign\r\n    representatives, to offer the usual congratulations on the 1st\r\n    of January, he observed: \"I regret that the relations between\r\n    our two Governments are not more satisfactory; but I beg\r\n    you to assure the Emperor that they in no respect alter my\r\n    feelings of friendship to himself.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE POPE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE POPE AND LORD PALMERSTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Odo Russell[3] to Mr Corbett._[4]\r\n\r\n(_Submitted to Queen Victoria_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nROME, _14th January 1859_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honour of being received by the Pope at a private\r\naudience this morning at the Vatican. No one else was present.\r\n\r\nHis Holiness, whose manner towards me was most kind and benevolent,\r\nsaid: \"You are appointed to succeed a very good man,[5] for whom I\r\nfelt great affection, and I regret that he has left Rome. You may be\r\nas good as he was, and we shall become friends, but I do not know you\r\nyet, and Mr Lyons I had known for many years; he is going to America,\r\nI hear, and he will find the Americans far more difficult to deal with\r\nthan with us.\r\n\r\n\"I am much gratified to hear that the Prince of Wales is likely to\r\nvisit Rome, and Her Majesty, I feel sure, has done well to allow him\r\nto prosecute his studies here. It will be an honour to me to receive\r\nhim at the Vatican, and I beg that you will confer with Cardinal\r\nAntonelli[6] as to the best means of making the Prince's visit here\r\nuseful and pleasant. We are anxious that all his wishes should be\r\nattended to, that he may preserve a pleasant recollection of Rome\r\nin the future. Alas! so many erroneous impressions exist about this\r\ncountry that I hope you will not judge of us too rashly. We are\r\nadvised to make reforms, and it is not understood that those very\r\nreforms, which would consist in giving this country a Government of\r\nlaymen, would make it cease to exist. It is called 'States of the\r\nChurch' (_États de l' Église_), and that is what it must remain. It\r\nis true I have lately appointed a layman to a post formerly held by an\r\necclesiastic, and I may do so again occasionally; but, however small\r\nwe may be, we cannot yield to outer pressure, and this country must\r\nbe administered by men of the Church. For my part, I shall fulfil my\r\nduties according to my conscience, and should Governments and events\r\nturn against me they cannot make me yield. I shall go with the\r\nfaithful to the Catacombs, as did the Christians of the early\r\ncenturies, and there await the will of the Supreme Being, for I dread\r\nno human Power upon earth and fear nothing but God.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Holy Father,\" I said, \"you speak as if some great danger\r\nthreatened Rome--is there any [real?] cause for apprehension?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not heard,\" His Holiness answered, \"that great excitement\r\nprevails throughout Italy?--the state of Lombardy is deplorable; evil\r\nspirits are at work even in my dominions, and the late speech of\r\nthe King of Sardinia is calculated to inflame the minds of all\r\nthe revolutionary men of Italy. It is true he says he will observe\r\nexisting Treaties, but that will scarcely counter-balance the effect\r\nproduced by other portions of his speech. News has also reached me of\r\nan extensive amnesty granted by the King of Naples--he did not yield\r\nto outer pressure, and he was right--but now, on the occasion of the\r\nmarriage of his son, an act of clemency on his part is well advised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it true,\" I said, \"that political prisoners are included in that\r\nAmnesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" His Holiness answered; \"I saw the name of Settembrini, and\r\nI think also of that other man in whom your Government took so much\r\ninterest--his name begins with a 'P' if I remember rightly----\"\r\n\r\n\"Poerio,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"That is the name,\" the Pope continued; \"and I fancy that all the\r\nother political prisoners will be released; they are to be sent to\r\nCadiz at the expense of the King, they are to be clothed and receive\r\nsome money, I believe, and after that arrangements have been made\r\nwith the Minister of the United States to have them conveyed to that\r\ncountry; they are to be exiled for life. I hope this event may\r\nhave the effect of making your Government and that of France renew\r\ndiplomatic relations with Naples; I always regretted that rupture, but\r\nthe King was right not to yield to outer pressure.\r\n\r\n\"It is lucky,\" the Pope ended with a smile, \"that Lord Palmerston\r\nis not in office; he was too fond of interfering in the concerns of\r\nforeign countries, and the present crisis would just have suited\r\nhim. _Addio, caro_,\" the Pope then said, and dismissed me with his\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nI then, according to usage, called on Cardinal Antonelli, and\r\nrecounted to him what had passed. He confirmed all the Pope had\r\nsaid, but denied that there was any very serious cause for immediate\r\napprehension of any general disturbance of the peace of Italy.

The\r\nEmperor is extremely irritated at our not concurring in his views on\r\nItaly, and Lord Malmesbury believes that nothing will restrain him but\r\nthe public opinion expressed against them, in France.[7] Austria\r\nhas, against all our advice and common prudence, made a false move by\r\nsending troops into the Papal States _against_ the wish of _the Pope_,\r\nand is now obliged to recall them. The speech of your Majesty is to\r\nbe discussed in Cabinet to-day.

If any\r\nman deserves an acknowledgment of his services at the hands of the\r\nCrown, it is surely he, and the Queen would be sorry that the grace\r\nof it should be taken away from her by questions being asked in\r\nParliament when it is assembled again, which will now be the case very\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nA step in the Peerage and the G.C.B. appear to the Queen an\r\nappropriate reward. Perhaps a pension should be awarded to him? Lord\r\nElphinstone also ought not to be left unrewarded, and a step in the\r\nPeerage with the G.C.B. does not appear too high an honour for him,\r\nfor he also has greatly contributed to the saving to the Indian\r\nEmpire.[8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Lord Canning was made an Earl and Lord\r\n    Elphinstone (who had been Governor of Bombay during the\r\n    Mutiny) a Peer of the United Kingdom, and both received the\r\n    G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S FIRST GRANDCHILD]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _2nd February 1859_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST, KINDEST UNCLE,--Accept my warmest thanks for your most\r\nkind letter of the 28th.

It would be removed from the direct command\r\nof the Crown, and entirely independent of Parliament. It would throw\r\nan unconstitutional amount of power and patronage into the hands of\r\nthe Indian Council and Government; it would be raised and maintained\r\nin antagonism to the Regular Army of the Crown; and professional\r\njealousy, and personal and private interests, would needs drive it\r\ninto a position of permanent hostility towards that Army.\r\n\r\nThis hostility has been already strongly marked in the proceedings of\r\nthe Commission itself.\r\n\r\nIts detrimental effects would not be confined to India alone, but\r\nwould form a most dangerous obstacle to the maintenance of the\r\ngovernment of the Regular Army by the Queen. Already, during\r\nthe Crimean War, most of the blows levelled at the Army and the\r\nprerogative of the Crown were directed by Indian officers, of whom,\r\nin future, a vast number would be at home, without employment or\r\nrecognised position, in compact organisation, and moved by a unity of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nThere may be points of detail, admitting differences of opinion as to\r\nthe relative advantages of a purely local or general Military Force\r\nfor India; but these are mere trifles, which sink into insignificance\r\nin the Queen's estimation, when she has to consider the duty which she\r\nowes to her Crown and her Country.\r\n\r\nThe Queen hopes Lord Derby will not consider that she intends, by this\r\nletter, unduly to influence his free consideration and decision as\r\nto the advice he may think it his duty to offer, but merely to guard\r\nagainst his being taken by surprise, and to prevent, if possible, an\r\nunseemly public difference between herself and Lord Stanley. She is\r\nimpelled to the apprehension that such may arise from the manner in\r\nwhich, since the first transfer of the Indian Government to the Crown,\r\nevery act of Lord Stanley has uniformly tended to place the Queen in a\r\nposition which would render her helpless and powerless in resisting a\r\nscheme which certain persons, imbued with the old Indian traditions,\r\nwould appear to wish to force upon the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Queen does not expect an answer to this letter from Lord Derby,\r\nand asks him to treat it as strictly confidential.\r\n\r\nThe Queen sees that Lord Stanley means to make a statement on Monday\r\non the Indian Finances. She trusts that there will be nothing said in\r\nthat statement to prejudge the Army Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Decipher from Lord Cowley._\r\n\r\nPARIS, _6th February 1859_.\r\n(1 A.M. _Received_ 4 A.M.)\r\n\r\nA great change for the better. The Queen's letter has produced an\r\nexcellent effect, as also the Debates in Parliament.[11] The Emperor\r\nhas expressed himself ready to subscribe to every word of Lord Derby's\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Parliament was opened by the Queen in person on\r\n    the 3rd; the ensuing debates, and especially the speeches of\r\n    the Liberal leaders, showed that, however much the English\r\n    nation, as a whole, might sympathise with Italian aspirations\r\n    for the expulsion of the Austrians from Lombardy, they would\r\n    regard unfavourably a war commenced in defiance of Treaty\r\n    obligations.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE INDIAN ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _6th February 1859_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty his\r\nrespectful acknowledgment of the explicitness with which the letter he\r\nhad the honour of receiving last night conveys to him the intimation\r\nof your Majesty's views upon the important subject of the Indian Army.\r\nHe cannot, however, disguise from your Majesty the deep pain which\r\nthat communication has occasioned him; first, that your Majesty should\r\nthink that Lord Stanley has so far mistaken his duty as systematically\r\nto place your Majesty in a false position; and next because unless\r\nLord Derby misconceives the purport of your Majesty's letter, he fears\r\nthat it may leave him no alternative but that of humbly entreating to\r\nbe relieved from a responsibility which nothing should have induced\r\nhim to undertake but a sense of duty to your Majesty, and the\r\nconviction that he might rely with confidence upon your Majesty's\r\ncontinued support. It would ill become Lord Derby to attempt to\r\nargue a question on which your Majesty has expressed so strong a\r\ndetermination; he has studiously avoided taking any step which might\r\nprejudge a question so important as the organisation of your Majesty's\r\nForces in India. He has awaited the report of the Commission appointed\r\nto enquire into the subject, and though aware of the wide difference\r\nof opinion which prevailed, has desired impartially to weigh and\r\nexamine the arguments adduced on both sides, and he has in the\r\nmeantime refused to give his sanction to a proposition, earnestly\r\npressed upon the Government by Lord Canning, for immediately raising\r\nadditional regiments for Indian Service. But the announcement of\r\nyour Majesty's determination (if he rightly understands it), under no\r\ncircumstances to continue an European Army in India, under terms of\r\nservice different from those of the Line, paid out of Indian Revenues,\r\nand officered by men educated for that especial service, and looking\r\nto India for their whole career, places Lord Derby in a position of no\r\nlittle embarrassment; for notwithstanding the gracious intimation that\r\nyour Majesty does not desire unduly to influence his judgment as to\r\nthe advice which he may tender, it amounts to a distinct warning\r\nthat if tendered in a particular direction it has no chance of being\r\naccepted by your Majesty. Nor, with that knowledge on his part not\r\nshared by his colleagues, can he freely discuss with them the course\r\nwhich they may consider it their duty to pursue.\r\n\r\nLord Derby humbly trusts, therefore, that your Majesty will be\r\ngraciously pleased, so far as the members of the Government are\r\nconcerned, to absolve him from the obligation of secrecy, and to allow\r\nhim to place before them a state of things which may lead to the most\r\nserious results, so far as their power of serving your Majesty is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nLord Derby will give Lord Stanley a caution not to say anything in\r\nhis statement of Indian Finance which may prejudge the question of a\r\nsingle or separate armies; but he hardly thinks the caution necessary,\r\nas European troops, whether in one Service or in two, will equally be\r\nchargeable to the revenues of India, which will only be affected by\r\nthe proportion which the whole of the European may bear to the whole\r\nof the native forces.\r\n\r\nLord Derby hopes that he may be permitted to offer his humble\r\ncongratulations to your Majesty on the very favourable reports\r\nreceived from Paris by telegraph, and upon the highly satisfactory\r\neffects produced by your Majesty's private letter to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant\r\nand Subject,\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDIVISIBILITY OF ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _7th February 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is very sorry to learn from Lord Derby's letter, received\r\nlast evening, that her communication to him on the Indian Army\r\nquestion had caused him deep pain. She had long hesitated whether\r\nshe should write it, from a fear that its purport and motive might\r\npossibly be misunderstood; but feeling that there ought to exist\r\nnothing but the most unreserved and entire confidence between herself\r\nand her Prime Minister, she thought it incumbent upon her to let Lord\r\nDerby see exactly what was passing in her mind.\r\n\r\nIf, notwithstanding the Queen's expressed hope that Lord Derby might\r\nnot consider the communication as intended unduly to influence his\r\nfree consideration of the important subject, he should feel that\r\nits possession, without being at liberty to communicate it to his\r\ncolleagues, does so in effect, she would ask him to return it to her,\r\nand to consider it as not having been written. If he should think,\r\nhowever, that a communication of the Queen's views to the Cabinet is\r\ndue to them, she is quite prepared to make one. In that case it would\r\nnaturally have to be differently worded, would omit every reference to\r\nLord Stanley, and might go more into detail.\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot close this letter without correcting some\r\nmisapprehensions into which Lord Derby seems to have fallen. It was\r\nnot the Queen's intention to impute any motives of systematic action\r\nto Lord Stanley; she referred simply to facts and steps, known as well\r\nto Lord Derby as to herself, which \"uniformly tended\" to place her in\r\na powerless position with regard to the Army question.\r\n\r\nThe Queen protested against \"the _creation_ of a British Army distinct\r\n(in its existence and constitutional position) from that of the\r\nCrown,\" and not against the \"_continuance_ of an European Army, under\r\nterms of service different from the Line, paid out of Indian Revenues,\r\nand officered by men educated for that special service, and looking to\r\nIndia for their whole career.\" In fact, she does not understand what\r\nmeaning Lord Derby attaches to the words \"terms of service.\" Every\r\nforce kept in India, however constituted, would be paid out of Indian\r\nRevenues. _This_ would therefore not form the distinction, and Lord\r\nDerby cannot intend to convey that on these revenues one set of\r\nEnglishmen can have a greater claim than another; nor does she see\r\nwhy English officers, commanding English soldiers and charged with\r\nthe maintenance of _their_ discipline and efficiency, should for\r\nthat object require to be specially and differently educated, and be\r\nrestricted to look to India for their whole career. Officers attached\r\nto native troops are in a different position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MISAPPREHENSION REMOVED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _7th February 1859_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty his grateful\r\nacknowledgments for your Majesty's most gracious note received this\r\nevening, the contents, and still more the tenor of which have relieved\r\nhim from the painful apprehension that he might be called upon to\r\nchoose between a strong sense of public duty, and, on the other side,\r\nhis deep devotion to your Majesty's service, and his gratitude for the\r\nfavourable consideration which his imperfect attempts to discharge\r\nhis public duty had always received at your Majesty's hand. The\r\nexplanation, with which he has now been honoured, of your Majesty's\r\nviews has entirely dispelled those apprehensions, and he feels that\r\nhe has only to thank your Majesty for the gracious explanation, with\r\nwhich he has been honoured, of your Majesty's motives in addressing to\r\nhim the letter which certainly caused him \"deep pain.\"...[12]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Lord Derby then proceeded to deal at some length\r\n    with the status of the troops in India, concluding with the\r\n    opinion that the local forces in India should never exceed\r\n    those sent from home as part of the Regular Army, subject to\r\n    the ordinary routine of service.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _8th February 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Derby's letter of yesterday, and is\r\npleased to find that he now appreciates the motives which dictated her\r\nfirst letter. It needs no assurance on her side that she never doubted\r\nthose which actuate Lord Derby. The Queen will, in compliance with\r\nhis request, defer any further notice of the subject until the\r\nCommissioners shall have made their report; it would not be fair,\r\nhowever, to Lord Derby, not to add that she fears from his explanation\r\nthat he has not now correctly estimated the nature of the Queen's\r\nobjection, which is not to a variety of forces, terms of service,\r\nlocal or general employment, etc., etc., etc., established in one\r\nArmy, but to the principle of _two_ British Armies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR'S SPEECH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to General Peel._[13]\r\n\r\n_13th February 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen relies with confidence that when the question of the Indian\r\nArmy comes before the Cabinet, General Peel will stoutly defend the\r\ninterests of the Crown and the British Army.

That your\r\nMajesty was unable to see in those circumstances, any which were\r\nbeyond the reach of diplomatic skill, if there were only a mutual\r\ndesire, on the part of the Chief Powers concerned, to give fair play\r\nto its exercise. That the only source of substantial danger was the\r\npresent state of Italy; and that even in that there would be little\r\ndanger of interruption to the general tranquillity, were it not for\r\nthe antagonism excited by interests and engagements, real or supposed,\r\nof France and Austria.\r\n\r\nThat your Majesty believed that the supposed divergence of these\r\ninterests and engagements might be capable of reconciliation if\r\nentered into with mutual frankness, and with a mutual disposition to\r\navoid the calamities of war; but that, as it appeared to your Majesty,\r\nneither party would be willing to invite the other to a friendly\r\ndiscussion of the points of difference between them.\r\n\r\nThat in this state of affairs your Majesty, as a mutual friend of both\r\nSovereigns, and having no individual interests to serve, entertained\r\nthe hope that by the spontaneous offer of good offices, your Majesty\r\nmight be the means of establishing certain bases, on which the Powers\r\nmainly interested might subsequently enter into amicable negotiations\r\nwith regard to the questions chiefly in dispute, or threatening\r\nserious results.\r\n\r\nOf these, the most pressing are those which relate to the Italian\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nThat your Majesty, anxiously revolving in your mind the question how\r\nyour Majesty's influence could best be brought to bear, had come to\r\nthe conclusion that your Majesty's Ambassador at Paris, having\r\nthe fullest knowledge of the views entertained by that Court, and\r\npossessing your Majesty's entire confidence, might usefully be\r\nintrusted with a highly confidential, but wholly unofficial mission,\r\nfor the purpose of ascertaining whether there were any possibility\r\nconsistently with the views of the two Courts of offering such\r\nsuggestions as might be mutually acceptable as the basis of future\r\narrangements; and, if such should happily be found to be the case, of\r\noffering them simultaneously to the two parties, as the suggestions of\r\na mutual friend.\r\n\r\nThat your Majesty trusted His R.I.A.[15] Majesty would look upon this\r\ncommunication in the truly friendly light in which it was intended,\r\nand that Lord Cowley, in his unofficial and confidential character,\r\nmight be permitted fully to develop the views which your Majesty\r\nentertained, and to meet with the most favourable consideration of his\r\nsuggestions from His R.I.A.

An understanding\r\nwith Austria on every point ought, if possible, to precede our giving\r\nour opinion to France or Russia. If they can _once_ get the Powers\r\nto agree upon a point upon which Austria disagrees, they have won the\r\ngame, and the Emperor can proceed to his war, having a declaration of\r\nEurope against Austria as his basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Malmesbury._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _12th April 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has marked a passage in this draft, which she thinks it\r\nwould be advisable to modify--so as not to _put_ upon _record_ (should\r\nthe Austrians refuse to give way on this point) that we consider their\r\nconduct as \"_reckless_.\" Should they persist, they would certainly not\r\nmeet with as much sympathy as they would do if they yielded, and\r\nsuch a course on their part would be very much to be regretted, as\r\nwe consider every sacrifice small, in comparison to the blessings\r\nof preserving peace; but still Austria would have a perfect right to\r\nstand out--and we originally supported her in this demand.\r\n\r\nIf something which _expressed_ the _above_ sentiments and opinions\r\ncould therefore be substituted for the present passage, the Queen\r\nthinks it would be very desirable _for the future_, both as regards\r\nAustria and England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ENGLAND AND AUSTRIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _21st April 1859_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty that it\r\nhas appeared to him, in consultation with his colleagues, with the\r\nexception of Lord Hardwicke and Sir John Pakington, who are out of\r\nTown, that the only step which can properly be taken at present is to\r\nprotest strongly against the course which Austria is now taking, and\r\nto warn her that whatever may be the results to herself, she deprives\r\nherself of all claim to the support or countenance of England.[25]\r\nYour Majesty will see by another telegram, received a few minutes ago\r\nfrom Lord Cowley, that Hübner!! advises that England should threaten\r\nto come to the aid of Sardinia, if the contemplated invasion should\r\ntake place! Your Majesty's servants are not, however, prepared to take\r\nso strong a step, which would commit them to measures to which they\r\nmight be unable at the moment to give due effect; and which, if\r\nAustria were to disregard the measure, would involve them in War as\r\nthe Allies of France. They have therefore limited themselves to\r\na protest, the terms of which will require to be very carefully\r\nconsidered before it is embodied in a despatch.

I have _no hope_ of peace _left_. Though it is _originally_ the\r\nwicked folly of Russia and France that have brought about this fearful\r\ncrisis, it is the madness and blindness of Austria which have brought\r\non the war _now!_[26] It has put _them_ in the wrong, and entirely\r\nchanged the feeling here, which was all that one could desire, into\r\nthe most _vehement_ sympathy for _Sardinia_, though we hope now again\r\nto be able to _throw_ the blame of the war on France, who _now_ won't\r\nhear of mediation, while Austria is again inclined to do so!\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy, sad Easter; but what grieves me the most (indeed,\r\ndistracts me)--for I have had nothing but disappointments in that\r\nquarter since November--is that in all probability Vicky will be\r\nunable to come in May!

Lord Derby has thought it necessary, in consequence of the\r\nattitude assumed by Russia, notwithstanding her assurances that there\r\nis nothing hostile to England in her secret treaty with France, to\r\ncall upon Sir J. Pakington to say what addition could be made to\r\nthe Channel Fleet within a period of two or three months, without\r\nweakening that in the Mediterranean. He has the honour of enclosing\r\nthe answer, which he has just received by messenger. Lord Derby\r\nproposes to go up to Town to confer with Sir J. Pakington on this\r\nimportant subject to-morrow, and Lord Malmesbury has summoned a\r\nCabinet for Friday to consider the general state of affairs.\r\n\r\nFrance having absolutely refused the proffered mediation of England,\r\nand Austria having only accepted it under the condition of the\r\ndisarmament of Sardinia, every effort to preserve the peace has been\r\nexhausted; and it only remains for this country to watch the course\r\nof events, to protect her own interests, and to look out for any\r\nopportunity which may offer to mediate between the contending parties.\r\nThis policy, announced by Lord Derby in the City on Monday,[27] was\r\nreceived with unanimous approval. It will require a great deal to\r\ninduce the country to be drawn into a war under any circumstances, and\r\nLord Derby's anxious efforts will not be wanting to avoid it as long\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: He had there described Austria's action as\r\n    hasty, precipitate, and (because involving warfare) criminal,\r\n    but the Government would still (he added) strive to avert war,\r\n    by urging Austria, under the Treaty of Paris, to invoke the\r\n    mediation of the Powers. The Derby Government, however, were\r\n    supposed to be giving encouragement to Austria. See Lord\r\n    Derby's letter of the 2nd of June, _post_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S POLICY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _29th April 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has read the last telegrams with much pain, as they show\r\nthat there is no chance left of stopping war. Indeed she thinks,\r\nconsidering the progress of revolution in the Duchies, and the daily\r\nincrease of military strength of France and financial exhaustion of\r\nAustria, that it would not be morally defensible to try to restrain\r\nAustria from defending herself while she still can.\r\n\r\nCount Buol's proposal to continue negotiations during the fight\r\nsounds strange, but ought not to be altogether put aside. The King of\r\nSardinia's assumption of the Government of Tuscany[28] and military\r\noccupation of Massa-Carrara form gross infractions of the Treaties of\r\n1815 and international law, and can hardly be left without a protest\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nHas Lord Derby heard that a Russian Fleet is expected soon to appear\r\nin the Black Sea? The Queen has just heard it from Berlin, where it is\r\nsupposed to be certain, and it would explain Lord Cowley's report\r\nof (the Queen believes) Prince Napoleon's[29] account of the Russian\r\nengagements, which are admitted to contemplate a junction of\r\nthe French and Russian Fleets to defend the Treaty closing the\r\nDardanelles.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: See _ante_, Introductory Note to Chapter XXVIII.\r\n    The Duchy of Modena and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany were in\r\n    revolution, and the Duchy of Parma soon followed their example.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: See _post_, 1st May, 1859, note 30.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FRANCE AND RUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nROEHAMPTON, _1st May 1859_.\r\n(_Sunday night_, 12 P.M.)\r\n\r\n... Lord Derby entirely concurs in your Majesty's opinion that no\r\ncredit is to be attached to the denials of the French or Russian\r\nGovernments in regard to the engagements subsisting between them.[30]\r\nIt is very easy to convey denials in terms which are literally true,\r\nbut practically and in spirit false; and Lord Derby has no doubt but\r\nthat France is well assured that in any case she may rely upon the\r\ntacit assistance, if not the active co-operation, of Russia; and that\r\nboth Powers are using their utmost endeavours to excite troubles\r\nin the East, as well as in Italy, as the result of which France may\r\ngratify her cherished designs of ambition in the latter, while Russia\r\ncarries on her projects of aggrandisement in the former. This is a\r\nlamentable state of affairs; but it is Lord Derby's duty to assure\r\nyour Majesty that no Government which could be formed in this country\r\ncould hope to carry public opinion with it in taking an active part,\r\nas matters now stand, in opposition to France and Russia, if in truth\r\nthey are acting in concert, as Lord Derby believes that they are. All\r\nthat can be done is to maintain the principle of strict neutrality\r\nin regard to the affairs of Italy, and probably of Montenegro also,\r\nthough there is not sufficient evidence of facts in that case to\r\njustify a positive conclusion. But in the meantime everything shows\r\nmore conclusively the absolute necessity for the increase of your\r\nMajesty's Naval Force,[31] which was determined at the Council\r\nyesterday, and respecting which it will be necessary, on the very\r\nfirst day of the meeting of the new Parliament, to call for an\r\nexplicit expression of opinion.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty enquires as to a supposed pledge given by the Emperor of\r\nthe French as to a denial of any Treaty with Sardinia. So far as\r\nLord Derby can recollect at this moment, there never was more than an\r\nassurance that so long as Austria remained within her own limits, he\r\nwould not interfere; and that he would not support Sardinia, unless\r\nshe were herself invaded in any _unjustifiable_ attack on Austria;\r\nand there was also a denial in the _Moniteur_, to which your Majesty\r\nprobably refers, of there having been any engagement entered into _as\r\na condition of the marriage_.[32] These are just the denials to\r\nwhich Lord Derby has already adverted, which appear at first sight\r\nsatisfactory, but which may be afterwards explained away, so as to\r\nescape the charge of absolute falsehood.\r\n\r\nLord Derby trusts that your Majesty will have understood, and excused,\r\nhis absence from the Council on Saturday, in consequence of the\r\nmisunderstanding as to the time appointed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: Lord Cowley, in a letter of the 29th of April\r\n    to Lord Malmesbury, described an interview with the Emperor of\r\n    the French, when the latter denied in terms the existence of\r\n    a signed Treaty between France and Russia. But, as Lord Cowley\r\n    added, there might be moral engagements which might easily\r\n    lead to a more specific alliance.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: The Emperor had interrogated Lord Cowley as to\r\n    this.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: In July 1858, the joint action of France and\r\n    Sardinia had been concerted at the confidential interview\r\n    at Plombières, between the Emperor and Cavour, the former\r\n    undertaking to assist Sardinia, under certain contingencies,\r\n    against Austria. On the same occasion the marriage was\r\n    suggested of the Princess Clothilde of Sardinia to the Prince\r\n    Napoleon Joseph Paul, son of Prince Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\n    An interesting account of the events of this time, and of the\r\n    character and aims of Cavour, will be found in De la Gorce's\r\n    _Histoire du Second Empire_; see especially vol. ii. book 14.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE POSITION OF FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Malmesbury._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _3rd May 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has carefully read the enclosed draft. She thinks that,\r\nwithout saying anything offensive to France,[33] this important\r\ndocument would not place matters before that Power in the world in\r\naccordance with the facts, and would lead to erroneous inferences\r\nif it left out altogether, as it does, any reference to the\r\nresponsibility which France has had in bringing about the present\r\nstate of affairs....

The inference would be that _we_ forsake her in her noble\r\ncourse, and deserve again the name of \"_perfide Albion_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen would ask Lord Malmesbury to consider this.

God\r\nknows we _are_ in a sad mess. The rashness of the Austrians is indeed\r\na _great_ misfortune, for it has placed them in the wrong. Still there\r\nis _one_ universal feeling of _anger_ at the conduct of France, and\r\nof _great suspicion_. The Treaty with Russia is _denied_, but I am\r\nperfectly certain that there _are engagements_....\r\n\r\nHere the Elections are not as satisfactory as could be wished, but the\r\nGovernment still think they will have a clear gain of 25 to 30 seats,\r\nwhich will make a difference of 50 or 60 votes on a Division. It\r\ngives unfortunately no majority; still, it must be remembered that the\r\nOpposition are very much divided, and not at all a compact body, which\r\nthe supporters of the Government are.[34]\r\n\r\nLord John has been holding moderate and prudent language on Foreign\r\nAffairs, whereas Lord Palmerston has made bad and mischievous\r\nspeeches, but _not_ at all in accordance with the feelings of\r\nthe country.

He is, and his figure much\r\nimproved. He is a good, kind, amiable boy whom one must like. He has\r\nsailed this morning with the Bridegroom, and on the 16th or 17th we\r\nmay expect them back with the dear young Bride.\r\n\r\nI venture to send you a letter I received some days ago from dear\r\nVicky, and the religious tone of which I think will please you.

It is indeed\r\ndistracting, and most difficult to understand them or do anything for\r\nthem. The Emperor leaves Paris for Genoa to-morrow. It is _not_ true\r\nthat the Empress was so warlike; Lord Cowley says, on the contrary,\r\nshe is very unhappy about it, and that the Emperor himself is low and\r\naltered.

He passed an hour in attempting to prove what it seems\r\nhe really believes himself--that the Emperor had no plan or even\r\nintention to make war in Italy; that His Imperial Majesty was drawn\r\ninto it step by step by M. de Cavour, who finally menaced to publish\r\nhis most confidential correspondence, etc.; that his army was totally\r\nunprepared, and is now in a very imperfect state, and that he himself\r\nwas overcome with surprise and fear when he learnt in the middle of\r\nlast month that the Austrians had 120,000 men on the Ticino.[37] The\r\nEmperor, however, now believes that he will easily gain a _couple_\r\nof victories, and that when he has _rejeté les Autrichiens dans leur\r\ntanière_ (by which he means their great fortresses), he will return\r\nto govern at Paris, and leave a Marshal to carry on the sieges and the\r\nwar. M. de Persigny's letters of appointment are not yet signed, and\r\nmust go to Italy to be so. He stated that a week ago he was named\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, and that Fould,[38] Walewski, and others\r\nwere to be dismissed, but that two days before the Emperor's departure\r\nMadame Walewska[39] and the Empress had on their knees obtained a\r\nreprieve, and that M. de Persigny was ordered to come here _sans\r\nraisonner_...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: Who had been re-appointed to London, where\r\n    Marshal Pélissier, Duc de Malakhoff, had replaced him in 1858.\r\n    See _ante_, 23rd March, 1858.

Sir J. Hudson added that\r\n    he had learned confidentially that the understanding on the\r\n    same subject between Cavour and the Emperor Napoleon was\r\n    complete, and that it had been expressed thus: \"Non seulement\r\n    nous prendrons la première occasion de faire la guerre à\r\n    l'Autriche, mais nous chercherons un prétexte.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Achille Fould, a Jewish banker, was a\r\n    colleague of Walewski, though not a loyal one, in the French\r\n    Government.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: Madame Walewska was a Florentine by birth,\r\n    descended on her mother's side from the princely family of\r\n    Poniatowski.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheader: ATTITUDE OF RUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Malmesbury._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _20th May 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was much surprised to receive the enclosed telegram. An\r\nalliance with Russia to _localise_ and _arrest_ the war by joint\r\ninterference, which is here proposed to Russia, is a policy to which\r\nthe Queen has not given her sanction, and which would require very\r\nmature deliberation before it could ever be entertained. The Queen\r\nis much afraid of these telegraphic short messages on principles of\r\npolicy, and would beg Lord Malmesbury to be most cautious as they\r\nmay lead us into difficulties without the possibility of previous\r\nconsideration. How can we propose to join Russia, whom we know to\r\nbe pledged to France? The Queen hopes Lord Malmesbury will stop the\r\ncommunication of this message, to Prince Gortschakoff.[40]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: A telegram had been received from St Petersburg,\r\n    saying that Prince Gortschakoff entirely coincided with\r\n    Lord Malmesbury's views as to localising the war; and Lord\r\n    Malmesbury had proposed to send a telegraphic reply containing\r\n    the words: \"We are anxious to unite with Russia, not only in\r\n    localising the war, but in arresting it.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _22nd May 1859_.\r\n\r\nIn answer to Lord Derby's letter of yesterday referring to the\r\nimportance of concerting with Russia the best modes of preventing the\r\nextension of the war, the Queen wishes merely to observe: That Russia\r\nhas acknowledged her desire to see the Austrians defeated, and her\r\nindifference to the maintenance of the Treaties of 1815; France\r\nwages war to drive the Austrians out of Italy, wresting from them\r\nthe Italian provinces secured to them by those treaties; and that the\r\nQueen has declared from the Throne her adhesion to these treaties\r\nto which Parliament unanimously responded. France and Russia may\r\ntherefore have an interest, and indeed _must_ have one, in not being\r\ndisturbed in any way in the prosecution of their Italian scheme.\r\nEngland can have no such interest. If France prove successful, the\r\nterritorial arrangements of Europe, in which England has found safety,\r\nand which she helped to establish in order to obtain safety against\r\nFrance after a war of twenty years' duration, will be subverted,\r\nand she herself may some day (perhaps _soon_) have her own safety\r\nimperilled. The Saxon provinces of Prussia will be in much greater\r\ndanger when France shall have destroyed Austria in Italy and ruined\r\nher at home, than while the latter remains a powerful member of the\r\nGerman Confederation. What the Queen is naturally anxious to guard\r\nagainst is our being drawn by degrees into playing the game of those\r\nwho have produced the present disturbance, and whose ulterior views\r\nare very naturally and very wisely by them concealed from us. The\r\nQueen is glad to hear that the telegram in question was not sent,\r\nhaving been alarmed by its being marked as having been despatched \"at\r\nnoon\" on the 20th. The Queen wishes Lord Derby to show this letter to\r\nLord Malmesbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheader: ILLNESS OF DUCHESS OF KENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _25th May 1859_.\r\n\r\nDEAREST UNCLE,--Thousand thanks for your dear kind letter and good\r\nwishes for my old birthday, and for your other dear letter of the\r\n21st.

As it stands, it conveys the\r\nimpression of a determination on the Queen's part of maintaining a\r\nneutrality--_à tout prix_--whatever circumstances may arise, which\r\nwould do harm abroad, and be inconvenient at home.[42] What the\r\nQueen may express is her wish to remain neutral, and her hope that\r\ncircumstances will allow her to do so. The paragraph about the\r\nNavy[43] as it stands makes our position still more humble, as it\r\ncontains a public apology for arming, and yet betrays fear of our\r\nbeing attacked by France.\r\n\r\nThe Queen suggests two amended forms for these passages, in which she\r\nhas taken pains to preserve Lord Derby's words as far as is possible,\r\nwith an avoidance of the objections before stated.\r\n\r\n\"Those endeavours have unhappily failed, and war has been declared\r\nbetween France and Sardinia on one side, and Austria on the other.\r\nI continue to receive at the same time assurances of friendship from\r\nboth contending parties. It being my anxious desire to preserve to\r\nmy people the blessing of uninterrupted peace, I trust in God's\r\nassistance to enable me to maintain a strict and impartial\r\nneutrality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Considering, however, the present state of Europe, and the\r\ncomplications which a war, carried on by some of its great Powers, may\r\nproduce, I have deemed it necessary, for the security of my dominions\r\nand the honour of my Crown, to increase my Naval Forces to an amount\r\nexceeding that which has been sanctioned by Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: In the Speech to be delivered by the Queen at\r\n    the opening of Parliament on the 7th of June.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: The passage originally ran: \"Receiving\r\n    assurances of friendship from both the contending parties, I\r\n    intend to maintain a strict and impartial neutrality, and\r\n    I hope, with God's assistance, to preserve to my people the\r\n    blessing of continued peace.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: The passage originally ran: \"I have, however,\r\n    deemed it necessary, in the present state of Europe, with no\r\n    object of aggression, but for the security of my dominions,\r\n    and for the honour of my Crown, to increase my Naval Forces\r\n    to an amount exceeding that which has been sanctioned by\r\n    Parliament.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheader: THE QUESTION OF NEUTRALITY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheader: THE NAVY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD DERBY'S CRITICISMS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _2nd June 1859_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty that he has\r\nmost anxiously, and with every desire to meet your Majesty's wishes,\r\nreflected upon the effect of the alterations suggested by your\r\nMajesty in the proposed Speech from the Throne. He has considered\r\nthe consequences involved so serious that he has thought it right\r\nto confer upon the subject with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as\r\nLeader of the House of Commons; and it is a duty which he owes to your\r\nMajesty not to withhold the expression of their clear and unhesitating\r\nconviction. Lord Derby trusts that your Majesty will forgive the\r\nfrankness with which, in the accompanying observations, he feels it\r\nnecessary to submit to your Majesty the grounds for the view which\r\nthey are compelled to take.\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph to which your Majesty takes exception is that\r\nwhich intimates your Majesty's \"intention\" to maintain a strict and\r\nimpartial neutrality, and \"hope\" to be enabled to preserve peace. Your\r\nMajesty apprehends that this may be interpreted into a determination\r\nto preserve neutrality _à tout prix_; but Lord Derby would venture to\r\nobserve that such an inference is negatived by the subsequent words,\r\nwhich only imply a \"hope\" of preserving peace. With the cessation\r\nof that hope, neutrality would necessarily terminate. But as matters\r\nstand at present, Lord Derby is warranted in assuring your Majesty\r\nthat if there is one subject on which more than another the mind of\r\nthe country is unanimous, it is that of an entire abstinence from\r\nparticipation in the struggle now going on in Italy. He collects this\r\nfrom the language of politicians of almost every class, from all the\r\npublic papers, from Addresses and Memorials which he receives every\r\nday--some urging, and some congratulating him upon the adoption of a\r\nperfectly neutral policy. The sympathies of the country are neither\r\nwith France nor with Austria, but were it not for the intervention of\r\nFrance, they would be general in favour of Italy. The charge now\r\nmade against your Majesty's servants, by the opposition Press, as the\r\n_Morning Post_ and _Daily News_, is that their neutrality covers\r\nsuch wishes and designs in favour of Austria; and any word in your\r\nMajesty's Speech which should imply a doubt of the continuance of\r\nstrict impartiality, would, undoubtedly, provoke a hostile Amendment,\r\nwhich might very possibly be carried in the Sardinian sense, and\r\nwhich, if so carried, would place your Majesty in the painful position\r\nof having to select an Administration, pledged against the interests\r\nof Austria and of Germany. Lord Derby says nothing of the personal\r\nresults to your Majesty's present servants, because, in such cases,\r\npersonal considerations ought not to be allowed to prevail; and it is\r\nin the interest of the country only, and even of the very cause which\r\nyour Majesty desires to uphold, that he earnestly trusts that your\r\nMajesty will not require any alteration in this part of the Speech.\r\nThere is, at this moment, in the country, a great jealousy and\r\nsuspicion of France, and of her ulterior designs--as indicated by\r\nthe demand of means of defence, the formation of Volunteer Corps,\r\netc.--but it is neutralised, partly by sympathy for Italy, partly by\r\nsuspicions, industriously circulated, of the pro-Austrian tendencies\r\nof the present Government. It is very important that the language of\r\nthe Speech should be so decided as to negative this impression, and\r\nLord Derby cannot but feel that if neutrality be spoken of not as a\r\nthing decided upon, but which, it is hoped, may be maintained, such\r\nlanguage will be taken to intimate the expectation of the Government\r\nthat it may, at no distant time, be departed from. In Lord Derby's\r\nhumble opinion Peace should be spoken of as subject to doubt, because,\r\nout of the present struggle, complications may arise which may\r\nnecessarily involve us in war; but neutrality, as between the present\r\nbelligerents, should be a matter open to no doubt or question. If\r\nthere be no attempt made to run counter to public opinion, and Austria\r\nshould sustain serious reverses, the jealousy of France will increase,\r\nand the feeling of the country will support your Majesty in a war,\r\nshould such arise, against her aggression; but if the slightest\r\npretext be afforded for doubting the _bonâ fide_ character of British\r\nneutrality, or the firm determination to maintain it, an anti-German\r\nfeeling will be excited, which will be fatal to the Administration,\r\nand seriously embarrassing to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe same observations apply, with hardly less force, to part of the\r\nAmendment suggested by your Majesty to the paragraph regarding the\r\nNavy. With submission to your Majesty, Lord Derby can hardly look upon\r\nit as humiliating to a great country, in announcing a large increase\r\nof its Naval Force, to disclaim any object of aggression. These words,\r\nhowever, might, if your Majesty were so pleased, be omitted, though\r\nLord Derby cannot go so far as to say that in his humble judgment the\r\nomission would be an improvement; but he trusts that your Majesty will\r\nbe satisfied with a general reference to the \"state of Europe\" without\r\nspeaking of the \"complications which a war carried on by some of the\r\nGreat Powers may produce.\" These words would infallibly lead to a\r\ndemand for explanation, and for a statement of the nature of the\r\n\"complications\" which the Government foresaw as likely to lead to war.\r\nIn humbly tendering to your Majesty his most earnest advice that\r\nyour Majesty will not insist on the proposed Amendments in his\r\nDraft Speech, he believes that he may assure your Majesty that he\r\nis expressing the unanimous opinion of his Colleagues. Of their\r\nsentiments your Majesty may judge by the fact that in the original\r\ndraft he had spoken of your Majesty's \"intention\" to preserve peace\r\n\"as long as it might be possible\"; but by universal concurrence these\r\nlatter words were struck out, and the \"hope\" was, instead of them,\r\nsubstituted for the \"intention.\" Should your Majesty, however, be\r\npleased so to order, Lord Derby will immediately submit the question\r\nto the consideration of his Colleagues, in order that your Majesty may\r\nbe put, in the most authentic form, in possession of their views.\r\nHe assures your Majesty that nothing can be more repugnant to his\r\nfeelings than to appear to offer objections to any suggestions\r\nemanating from your Majesty; and he has only been induced to do so\r\nupon the present occasion by the deep conviction which he entertains\r\nof the danger attending the course proposed, and the serious\r\nembarrassments which it would cause your Majesty. He regrets more\r\nespecially having been compelled to take this step at a moment when\r\nyour Majesty's thoughts are very differently engaged, and when it may\r\nbe doubly irksome to have matters of public business pressed upon your\r\nMajesty's consideration.\r\n\r\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant\r\nand Subject,\r\n\r\nDERBY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _3rd June 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Derby's answer to her observations on the\r\nproposed Speech. There is in fact no difference of opinion between her\r\nand Lord Derby; the latter only keeps in view the effect which certain\r\nwords will have in Parliament and upon the country, whilst she looks\r\nto the effect they will produce upon the European conflict. If\r\nthe Queen were not obliged to speak, both positions might be well\r\nreconciled; but if what she is going to declare from the Throne is\r\nto allay suspicions purposely raised by the Opposition against the\r\nGovernment that they intended to take part at some moment or other in\r\nthe war, and is to give absolute security to the country against this\r\ncontingency, this will be the very thing France would wish to bring\r\nabout in order to ensure to her the fullest liberty in prosecuting her\r\nschemes for disturbing and altering the territorial state of Europe.\r\nHow is this impression to be avoided? Lord Derby thinks that the\r\nexpression of \"hope\" to be able to preserve peace to this country is\r\na sufficient indication that this country reserves to herself still\r\na certain liberty of action; but the Queen would have interpreted\r\nit rather as the expression of a hope, that we may not be attacked,\r\nparticularly when followed by the sentence in which all intention of\r\naggression is disclaimed, and that our armaments are merely meant for\r\ndefence. The sense would then appear as this: \"As the belligerents\r\nseparately assure me of their friendship, I am determined to maintain\r\na strict neutrality between them, and hope they may not change their\r\nminds, and attack me; I arm, but merely to defend myself if attacked.\"\r\nThis would abdicate on the part of this country her position as one\r\nof the arbiters of Europe, declare her indifference to treaties or the\r\nbalance of power (which are, in fact, of the greatest value to her),\r\nand would preclude her from any action to preserve them. The Queen\r\nfully enters into the Parliamentary difficulty, and would deprecate\r\nnothing more than to expose the Government to a defeat on an Amendment\r\nwhich would lead to the formation of a new Government on the principle\r\nof neutrality _à tout prix_ imposed by Parliament on the Crown.\r\n\r\nIt will be for Lord Derby and his colleagues to consider how far they\r\nmay be able to avoid this danger without exposing themselves to that\r\npointed out by the Queen. She puts herself entirely in his hands, and\r\nhad suggested the verbal amendments merely with a view to indicate the\r\nnature of the difficulty which had struck her. Whatever decision Lord\r\nDerby may on further reflection come to, the Queen is prepared to\r\naccept.[44]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Ultimately the Cabinet recommended the\r\n    modification of the declaration of neutrality by the insertion\r\n    of the words \"between them\"; so as to run: \"I intend to\r\n    maintain _between them_ a strict and impartial neutrality,\"\r\n    etc.; and in the second paragraph proposed to omit the words\r\n    \"with no object of aggression, but\"--and adopting the form\r\n    of the Queen's paragraph, but omitting the words referring\r\n    to possible complications, to leave it thus: \"Considering,\r\n    however, the present state of Europe, I have deemed it\r\n    necessary for the security of my Dominions,\" etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: NEGOTIATIONS WITH RUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Malmesbury._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _5th June 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has read Lord Cowley's letter with regret. Nothing could\r\nbe more dangerous and unwise than at this moment to enter into\r\nnegotiations with Russia on the best manner of disposing of the\r\nEmperor of Austria's dominions. The Queen cannot understand how Lord\r\nCowley can propose anything so indefensible in a moral point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS [? _7th June 1859_.]\r\n(_Tuesday, quarter-past eight o'clock._)\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer with his humble duty to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nLord Hartington[45] spoke like a gentleman; was badly seconded.\r\n\r\nChancellor of Exchequer rose immediately at six o'clock, and is just\r\ndown. The House very full, and very enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of Exchequer presumes to say he thinks he satisfied his\r\nfriends.[46]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: Lord Hartington, afterwards eighth Duke of\r\n    Devonshire, moved an Amendment to the Address, expressing a\r\n    want of confidence in the Ministry.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: He flung his taunts right and left at the now\r\n    united Opposition, and was especially bitter against Sir\r\n    James Graham.

Now Willis's\r\n    Rooms are under the direction of patrons, and there are two of\r\n    these patrons below the gangway\" (indicating Lord John Russell\r\n    and Mr Sidney Herbert). In regard to its Foreign Policy, he\r\n    said the Government should not be condemned without direct\r\n    documentary evidence. Lord Malmesbury has since deplored\r\n    Mr Disraeli's neglect to produce the Blue Book with the\r\n    correspondence relating to the affairs of Italy and Austria,\r\n    and stated that, had he laid it on the table, the debate would\r\n    have ended differently (_Memoirs of an Ex-Minister_, vol. ii.\r\n    p. 188).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _10th June 1859_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty that the\r\ntone of the Government Agents in the House of Commons is less sanguine\r\nto-day than it was yesterday with regard to the issue of the Debate\r\nto-night. There are no actual changes announced of votes, but the tone\r\nof the Opposition is more confident; and when an opinion begins to\r\nprevail that the Government are likely to be in a minority, it often\r\nrealises itself by the effect which it produces on waverers and\r\nlukewarm supporters. The Division will certainly take place to-night;\r\nand, without absolutely anticipating failure, Lord Derby cannot\r\nconceal from your Majesty that he considers the situation very\r\ncritical. Mr Gladstone expressed privately his opinion last night\r\nthat, even if successful on the present occasion, the Government could\r\nnot possibly go on, which does not look like an intention, on the\r\npart of the Liberal Party, of considering the present division as\r\ndecisive.[47]...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: The rest of the letter relates to the\r\n    distribution of honours to the outgoing Ministers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Disraeli to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _11th June 1859_.\r\n(_Saturday morning, half-past two o'clock._)\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer with his humble duty to your Majesty:\r\n\r\nFor the Amendment                             323\r\nFor the Address                               310\r\n                                              ---\r\n  Majority against your Majesty's servants     13\r\n                                              ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE MINISTRY DEFEATED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Earl of Derby._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _11th June 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was very much grieved to receive Mr Disraeli's report of the\r\ndivision of yesterday, although she was fully prepared for this event.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer Lord Derby's letter of yesterday in order not to\r\nanticipate it. Now that the fate of the Government is decided, she\r\nis prepared to grant those favours and acknowledgments of service for\r\nwhich Lord Derby asked in his letter. The Queen _could_ not reconcile\r\nit with her own feelings, however, were she to omit this opportunity,\r\nwhen Lord Derby for the second time resigns the post of her Prime\r\nMinister, of giving to him personally a public mark of her approbation\r\nof his services. The Queen therefore asks him to accept the Garter\r\nfrom her hands.\r\n\r\nAs the Queen holds a Drawing-room to-day, and receives the City\r\nAddress after it, Lord Derby will be aware how little time she has\r\nthis morning (being naturally anxious to have some conversation with\r\nhim with as little delay as possible); she would ask him to come here\r\neither at half-past eleven or half-past twelve o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Derby to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nST JAMES'S SQUARE, _11th June 1859_.\r\n\r\nLord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty the\r\nexpression of his deep gratitude for your Majesty's most gracious note\r\nthis moment received, and for the terms in which your Majesty has been\r\npleased to speak of his very imperfect services. He gratefully accepts\r\nthe honour which your Majesty has been pleased to confer upon him as a\r\nmark of your Majesty's personal favour. As a Minister, he could never\r\nhave advised your Majesty to bestow it upon him, and he could not have\r\naccepted it on the recommendation of any Government to which he was\r\npolitically opposed; but as a spontaneous act of your Majesty, it\r\nacquires in his eyes a value which nothing else could have given to\r\nit. Lord Derby is this moment going down to the Cabinet, as a matter\r\nof form, and will obey your Majesty's commands as soon as possible\r\nafter half-past eleven, when he will have an opportunity of expressing\r\nin person his deep sense of your Majesty's goodness, and his entire\r\ndevotedness, in whatever situation he may be placed, to your Majesty's\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD GRANVILLE SUMMONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Earl Granville._\r\n\r\n[_Undated. 11th June 1859._]\r\n\r\nI waited at four o'clock this afternoon[48] upon the Queen by Her\r\nMajesty's gracious commands. The Queen was pleased to remark upon the\r\nimportance of the present crisis. Her Majesty informed me that Lord\r\nDerby had resigned, and that she had sent for me to desire that I\r\nshould attempt to form another Administration, which Her Majesty\r\nwished should be strong and comprehensive. I respectfully assured the\r\nQueen that Her Majesty's commands came upon me by surprise; that at\r\nany time I felt my own insufficiency for such a post, and that at this\r\ntime there were special difficulties; that I believed the only two\r\npersons who could form a strong Liberal Government were either Lord\r\nPalmerston or Lord John Russell; and that, although it had sometimes\r\nhappened that two statesmen of equal pretensions preferred having a\r\nnominal chief to serving under one another, I did not believe that\r\nthis was the case now. I said that I had reason to believe that Lords\r\nPalmerston and John Russell were ready to co-operate with one another,\r\nwhile I doubted whether either would consent to serve under a younger\r\nman of such small pretensions as myself.\r\n\r\nThe Queen in reply informed me that her first thoughts had been turned\r\nto Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, that they had both served\r\nher long and faithfully, and that Her Majesty felt it to be an\r\ninvidious task to select one of the two. Her Majesty was also of\r\nopinion that as different sections of the Liberal Party were more or\r\nless represented by each, it might be more easy for the Party to act\r\ntogether under a third person. Her Majesty added that she had selected\r\nme as the Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords, and a\r\nperson in whom both Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell had been in\r\nthe habit of placing confidence, and she expressed her confident\r\nhope that their attachment to herself would induce them to yield that\r\nassistance without which it would be difficult to form a strong and\r\ncomprehensive Government.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to state some of the most salient difficulties of the\r\ntask, and asked Her Majesty's permission to ascertain by negotiation\r\nwhat it would be possible to do.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty informed me that Her Majesty's experience of former\r\nchanges of administration had taught her that the construction of an\r\nadministration had failed when the person entrusted with the task had\r\nacted merely as a negotiator, and that the success of other attempts\r\nhad been owing to the acceptance of the charge by the person for whom\r\nshe had sent. Her Majesty laid Her Majesty's commands upon me to make\r\nthe attempt, and I had the honour of conveying two letters from Her\r\nMajesty to Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, stating that Her\r\nMajesty relied upon their assistance.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: The 11th of June.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE RIVAL LEADERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to_  {_Viscount Palmerston._\r\n                     {_Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _11th June 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen gives these lines to Lord Granville, whom she has entrusted\r\nwith the task of forming an administration on the resignation of Lord\r\nDerby. She has selected him as the Leader of the Liberal Party in the\r\nHouse of Lords. She feels that it is of the greatest importance that\r\nboth Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell should lend their services\r\nto the Crown and country in the present anxious circumstances, and\r\nthought at the same time that they might do so most agreeably to their\r\nown feelings by acting under a third person. They having both served\r\nthe Queen long and faithfully as her First Minister, she must not\r\nconceal from Lord Palmerston (John Russell) that it is a great relief\r\nto her feelings not to have to make the choice of one of them, and\r\nshe trusts that they will feel no difficulty to co-operate with one in\r\nwhom they have both been in the habit of placing confidence. From\r\nthe long experience the Queen has had of Lord Palmerston's (John\r\nRussell's) loyal attachment to her and the service of the Crown, she\r\nfeels confident she may rely on Lord Palmerston's (John Russell's)\r\nhearty assistance.[49]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: In reply, Lord Palmerston (in a letter printed\r\n    in Ashley's _Life of Lord Palmerston_, vol. ii. p. 155)\r\n    accepted his responsibility for uniting with others to\r\n    overthrow the Derby Ministry, and undertook to serve under\r\n    either Lord John Russell or Lord Granville, but stipulated\r\n    that any Government he joined must be an efficient and\r\n    representative one.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD GRANVILLE UNSUCCESSFUL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Granville to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBRUTON STREET, _12th June 1859_.\r\n(2 A.M.)\r\n\r\nLord Granville presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto submit that he saw Lord Palmerston immediately after he had left\r\nBuckingham Palace. Lord Granville stated what had passed there,\r\nomitting any reference to your Majesty's objection to the effect\r\nlikely to be produced on the Continent by Lord Palmerston's name, if\r\nhe had the direction of the Foreign Affairs. Nothing could be more\r\nfrank and cordial than Lord Palmerston's manner. He agreed to lead the\r\nHouse of Commons; he said that he had certainly anticipated that your\r\nMajesty would have sent for either Lord John or himself, but having\r\ntaken a part in the defeat of the present Government, he felt bound to\r\nput aside any personal objects, and co-operate with me; and that there\r\nwas no person whom he should prefer or even like as much as myself. He\r\nadded that his co-operation must depend upon my being able to form a\r\nstrong Government. Lord Granville then saw Lord John Russell, and\r\nhad a very long conversation with him. Lord John had no objection\r\nto serving under Lord Granville, but thought that he could not give\r\neffect to his political views unless he was either Prime Minister\r\nor Leader of the House of Commons, and he doubted whether he had\r\nconfidence in any one but Lord Palmerston for the Foreign Office. Lord\r\nGranville again saw Lord Palmerston, who informed him that if he had\r\nbeen sent for, he should have objected to go to the House of Lords,\r\nand that he could not now give up the lead of the House of Commons\r\n(which Lord Granville had already proposed to him to retain) to Lord\r\nJohn. This answer rendered it unnecessary for Lord Granville to allude\r\nto the objections to his holding the Foreign Office. Lord Granville\r\nhas seen Lord Clarendon, who acted up to the full spirit of your\r\nMajesty's letter, but deprecates strongly the attempt to form a\r\nGovernment without Lord John Russell. Sir George Grey is of the same\r\nopinion. Sir George Lewis, Mr Herbert, and Mr Gladstone think every\r\neffort should be made to secure Lord John, but that it would not be\r\nimpossible to form a Government without him. Mr Milner Gibson, with\r\nwhom Lord Granville had a more reserved conversation, considered it a\r\n_sine quâ non_ condition of support from the Liberal Party below the\r\ngangway, that Lord John should be a member of the Government. Lord\r\nGranville thinks that in his third interview with Lord Palmerston he\r\nobserved more dissatisfaction at not being sent for by your Majesty.\r\nLord Palmerston suggested that Lord John's absence from the Government\r\nwould make it more difficult for a Leader of the House, who was not\r\nPrime Minister, to hold his position.\r\n\r\nLord Granville has written to Lord John asking for a final answer\r\nbefore he informs your Majesty, whether he is able to attempt the task\r\nwhich your Majesty has with so much kindness and indulgence laid upon\r\nhim.[50]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: This letter, and Lord John's reply declining to\r\n    occupy only the third office in the State, and expressing\r\n    his anxiety for adequate security in the handling of Foreign\r\n    Affairs and Reform, are printed in Walpole's _Life of Lord\r\n    John Russell_, vol. ii. chap. xxvii.\r\n\r\n    Lord Granville then wrote to Lord John: \"I am glad that\r\n    I wrote to you yesterday evening, as your answer gave me\r\n    information which I had not gathered from your conversation\r\n    in the morning. I came away from Chesham Place with the\r\n    impression that union between you and Palmerston with or\r\n    without me was impossible. Your letter afforded a good\r\n    opportunity of arrangement. As soon as I found by it that I\r\n    was an obstacle instead of a facility towards the formation of\r\n    a strong Government. I went to the Queen to ask her to\r\n    excuse me from the task which she had so unexpectedly and so\r\n    graciously imposed upon me. In answer to a question, I stated\r\n    to Her Majesty that it was disagreeable to me to advise as to\r\n    which of you and Palmerston she should send for, but that I\r\n    was ready to do so if it was her wish.\r\n\r\n    \"The Queen did not press me. It is a great relief to have\r\n    finished this business.

But he positively declines entering the Cabinet or\r\ntaking any _other office_. He says, as _Foreign_ Secretary, he should\r\nbe ready to join the Government should there be a vacancy; but that\r\nhe has never directed his attention much to general politics, and his\r\ntaking any other office, after having held the Foreign Seals during\r\na long and important time, would be of no use to the Government, and\r\nwould only injure himself. The Queen told him that he might have any\r\noffice almost (naming several of those which Lord Palmerston discussed\r\nwith her), but she could not urge nor press him to do what _he felt_\r\nwould injure him, and indeed she found him quite determined in his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nHis absence from the Cabinet the Queen sincerely deplores, and she\r\nknows that Lord Palmerston will feel it a serious loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AN INDISCREET DISCLOSURE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Earl Granville._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _13th June 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is much shocked to find her whole conversation with Lord\r\nGranville yesterday and the day before detailed in this morning's\r\nleading article of the _Times_.[51] What passes between her and a\r\nMinister in her own room in confidential intercourse ought to be\r\nsacred, and it will be evident to Lord Granville that if it were not\r\nso, the Queen would be precluded from treating her Ministers with that\r\nunreserved confidence which can alone render a thorough understanding\r\npossible; moreover, any Minister could state what he pleased, against\r\nwhich the Queen would have no protection, as she could not well insert\r\ncontradictions or explanations in the newspapers herself.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: A circumstantial account of the Queen's\r\n    conversation with Lord Granville had appeared in the _Times_,\r\n    and Lord Derby drew attention to the matter in the House of\r\n    Lords.

Lord Granville in that\r\naccount laid much stress on the reasons which your Majesty gave for\r\nsending for Lord Granville, as he found that attempts had been made to\r\nattribute every sort of motive which might render the Court unpopular.\r\n\r\nBesides the gross impropriety of the appearance of reporting your\r\nMajesty's conversation, Lord Granville regrets the indirect attack\r\nupon Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\nLord Granville begs respectfully to express to your Majesty his\r\nvexation at the annoyance, which he has thus been the cause of\r\ninflicting on your Majesty, particularly at a moment when your Majesty\r\nhad just given him an additional proof of the indulgent kindness and\r\nconfidence which your Majesty has been pleased to place in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR COBDEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n94 PICCADILLY, _1st July 1859_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nbeen unable till within the last few minutes to make any Report about\r\nMr Cobden, from whom he had received no communication till about\r\nan hour ago, when Mr Cobden came to him.[52] The result of a long\r\nconversation between them has been that Mr Cobden, against the advice\r\nof all his friends and of his constituents, has decided to decline\r\ntaking office. He grounds his decision upon feelings personal\r\nto himself. He thinks that after having so often and so strongly\r\ndisapproved of the Foreign Policy of Viscount Palmerston as tending\r\ntoo much to involve this country in war, it would be inconsistent for\r\nhim to join the present Cabinet, and he also said that, at his time of\r\nlife and with his general habits, he does not consider himself fit for\r\nadministrative office.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston used every [means] in his power to induce him\r\nto change his decision, and showed that, with respect to present and\r\nfuture action, there is no apparent difference between his views and\r\nthose of Mr Cobden, since both would desire that this country should\r\nremain neutral in the war now raging in Italy. All his arguments,\r\nhowever, were useless, and though Mr Cobden discussed the matter in\r\nthe most friendly and good-humoured manner, and promised to give out\r\nof office all support to the Government, and said that he thought he\r\ncould do so more effectually out of office than in office, he could\r\nnot be persuaded to make any change in the answer which he came to\r\ngive.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston will consider what arrangement he may have to\r\npropose to your Majesty in consequence of Mr Cobden's answer.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: Mr Cobden had been visiting the United States.\r\n    On landing at Liverpool he learned that he had been elected\r\n    at Rochdale, and at the same time he received an offer of the\r\n    Board of Trade.]\r\n\r\nTHE MINISTRY AS FORMED BY VISCOUNT PALMERSTON.\r\n_in the month of June_ 1859.\r\n\r\n_First Lord of the Treasury_           VISCOUNT PALMERSTON.\r\n_Lord Chancellor_                      LORD CAMPBELL.\r\n_President of the Council_             EARL GRANVILLE.\r\n_Lord Privy Seal_                      DUKE OF ARGYLL.\r\n_Home Secretary_                       SIR G.

She is\r\nsorry not to be able to give her assent to his proposal with regard\r\nto Mr Bright.[54] Privy Councillors have sometimes exceptionally been\r\nmade without office, yet this has been as rewards, even in such cases,\r\nfor services rendered to the State. It would be impossible to allege\r\nany service Mr Bright has rendered, and if the honour were looked upon\r\nas a reward for his systematic attacks upon the institutions of the\r\ncountry, a very erroneous impression might be produced as to the\r\nfeeling which the Queen or her Government entertain towards these\r\ninstitutions. It is moreover very problematical whether such an\r\nhonour conferred upon Mr Bright would, as suggested, wean him from his\r\npresent line of policy, whilst, if he continued in it, he would only\r\nhave obtained additional weight in the country by his propounding his\r\nviews as one of the Queen's Privy Councillors.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: In 1859, Lord Palmerston, in offering Mr Cobden\r\n    a seat in the Cabinet, rejected the idea of accepting Mr\r\n    Bright as a colleague, on the ground that his public speeches\r\n    made it impossible.

He hopes that your\r\nMajesty will not have thought that there has been remissness in not\r\nmarking this happy event by an earlier public acknowledgment and\r\nthanksgiving in India, as has already been done in England.[55] The\r\ntruth is, that although this termination has long been steadily and\r\nsurely approaching, it is but just now that it can be said to be\r\ncomplete in the eyes of those who are near to the scene of action. It\r\nis only within the last three weeks that the exertions of our Troops\r\non the Oudh and Nepaulese frontier, and in some other parts, have been\r\nremitted, and almost every Gazette has recounted engagements with the\r\nrebels, which, although they have invariably had the same issue, would\r\nscarcely have consisted with a declaration that peace and tranquillity\r\nwere restored. Now, however, military operations have fairly ceased,\r\nand the rains and the climate, which would make a continuance of those\r\noperations much to be regretted, will do their work amongst the rebels\r\nwho are still in arms in the Nepaul jungles more terribly than any\r\nhuman avengers.\r\n\r\nLord Canning has used every exertion and device to bring these\r\nwretched men to submission; but many--it is difficult to say how many,\r\nbut certainly some few thousands--still hold out. With some of them\r\nthe reason no doubt is that they belong to the most guilty Regiments,\r\nand to those which murdered their officers; but this cannot apply\r\nto all; and it is to be feared that the prevailing cause is the bad\r\ninfluence of their leaders--the Nana, Bala Rao, and the Begum;[56] or\r\nrather the Begum's infamous advisers. It is certain that all of these,\r\nbelieving their own position to be desperate, have spared no pains\r\nto persuade their followers that the Government is seeking to entrap\r\nthem, and that, if they submit, their lives will be taken....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: There had been a Public Thanksgiving in England\r\n    on the 1st of May.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: Bala Rao was a brother of Nana Sahib, chief\r\n    instigator of the Sepoy Mutiny.

She is the more surprised at this, as Lord Palmerston\r\ntold her, when she saw him on the formation of the present Government,\r\nand she expressed her anxiety on the subject, that there would be no\r\nmore trouble about it, and he thought it would drop. The Queen\r\nexpects that the names of those who it is proposed should compose the\r\nCommittee, and the wording of it, will be submitted to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _5th July 1859_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that the re-appointment of the Committee on the Organisation\r\nof the Military Departments was unavoidable. That Committee had\r\nbeen affirmed by the House of Commons and consented to by the late\r\nGovernment, and had begun its sittings; but when a Dissolution of\r\nParliament was announced, it suspended its further sittings, with the\r\nunderstanding that it should be revived in the new Parliament; and to\r\nhave departed from that understanding would have been impossible. That\r\nwhich Viscount Palmerston intended to convey in what he said to your\r\nMajesty on the subject was, that the evidence given by Lord Panmure\r\nmight be deemed as having fully set aside the objection urged against\r\nthe present organisation by persons unacquainted with the bearing upon\r\nit of the fundamental principles of the Constitution, namely, that the\r\nCrown acts in regard to Military matters without having any official\r\nadviser responsible for its acts. Such a condition of things, if it\r\ncould exist, would be at variance with the fundamental principles\r\nof the British Constitution, and would be fraught with danger to the\r\nCrown, because then the Sovereign would be held personally answerable\r\nfor administrative acts, and would be brought personally in conflict\r\nin possible cases with public opinion, a most dangerous condition for\r\na Sovereign to be placed in.\r\n\r\nThe maxim of the British Constitution is that the Sovereign can do\r\nno wrong, but that does not mean that no wrong can be done by Royal\r\nauthority; it means that if wrong be done, the public servant who\r\nadvised the act, and not the Sovereign, must be held answerable for\r\nthe wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nBut the Ministers of the Crown for the time being are the persons who\r\nare constitutionally held answerable for all administrative acts in\r\nthe last resort, and that was the pith and substance of the evidence\r\ngiven by Lord Panmure. Those persons who want to make great changes\r\nin the existing arrangements were much vexed and disappointed by that\r\nevidence, and the attempt made yesterday to put off the Committee till\r\nnext year on the ground that the evidence now to be taken would be\r\none-sided only, and would tend to create erroneous impressions, was\r\nfounded upon those feelings of disappointment.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston submits names of the persons whom Mr Sidney\r\nHerbert proposes to appoint on the Committee, and they seem to be well\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _10th July 1859_.\r\n(7 P.M.)\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty. He has\r\njust received from Lord Palmerston, who is here, the paper, a copy of\r\nwhich is enclosed.[57]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has to add that Lord Palmerston and he are humbly of\r\nopinion that your Majesty should give to the Emperor of the French\r\nthe moral support which is asked. It is clearly understood that if the\r\nEmperor of Austria declines to accept the propositions, Great Britain\r\nwill still maintain her neutral position.\r\n\r\nBut it is probable that her moral support will put an end to the\r\nwar, and your Majesty's advisers cannot venture to make themselves\r\nresponsible for its continuance by refusing to counsel your Majesty to\r\naccept the proposal of France.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57: At the seat of war, a series of decisive French\r\n    victories had culminated in the battle of Solferino, on\r\n    Midsummer Day (see _ante_, Introductory Note to Chapter XXVIII).\r\n    But the French Emperor was beginning to think these successes\r\n    too dearly purchased, at the expense of so many French lives,\r\n    and, actuated either by this, or some similar motive, he\r\n    attempted, on the 6th of July, to negotiate through the British\r\n    Government with Austria. The attempt was a failure, but an\r\n    armistice was signed on the 8th, and again the Emperor sought\r\n    the moral support of England. The paper which Lord John\r\n    Russell submitted was a rough memorandum of M. de Persigny's,\r\n    proposing as a basis of negotiation the cession of Lombardy to\r\n    Piedmont, the independence of Venetia, and the erection of an\r\n    Italian Confederation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FRANCE AND AUSTRIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nPAVILION, ALDERSHOT, _10th July 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has just received Lord John Russell's letter with the\r\nenclosure which she returns, and hastens to say in reply, that\r\nshe does not consider the Emperor of the French or his Ambassador\r\njustified in asking the support of England to proposals he means to\r\nmake to his antagonist to-morrow. He made war on Austria in order to\r\nwrest her two Italian kingdoms from her, which were assured to her by\r\nthe treaties of 1815, to which England is a party; England declared\r\nher neutrality in the war. The Emperor succeeded in driving the\r\nAustrians out of one of these kingdoms after several bloody battles.\r\nHe means to drive her out of the second by diplomacy, and neutral\r\nEngland is to join him with her moral support in this endeavour.\r\n\r\nThe Queen having declared her neutrality, to which her Parliament and\r\npeople have given their unanimous assent, feels bound to adhere to it.\r\nShe conceives Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston ought not to ask\r\nher to give her \"moral support\" to one of the belligerents. As for\r\nherself, she sees no distinction between moral and general support;\r\nthe moral support of England _is_ her support, and she ought to be\r\nprepared to follow it up.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes this letter to be communicated to the Cabinet.[58]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: The Queen not having been informed whether this\r\n    instruction had been complied with, a correspondence took\r\n    place on the subject between the Prince and Lord Granville.\r\n    See the _Life of Lord Granville_, vol. i. chap. xiii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: END OF THE WAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _12th July 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has to acknowledge the receipt of Lord John Russell's letter\r\nreporting to her the result of the deliberations of the Cabinet, which\r\nhas very much relieved her mind. Lord John does not say whether\r\nher letter was read to the Cabinet, but from his former letter she\r\nconcludes it was. She is most anxious that there should exist no\r\nmisapprehension on their part as to the Queen's views. Our position\r\nmust be consistent and precisely defined. A negotiation to stop the\r\neffusion of blood, and to attain \"a peace which would be for the\r\ninterests of all belligerents,\" is a very vague term. Who is to\r\njudge of those interests? Is M. de Persigny or the Emperor Napoleon's\r\nopinion to be the guide, as they just now proposed to us? Austria must\r\nbe considered the exponent of her own interests. Prussia has explained\r\nto us the interests of Germany in the maintenance of the line of the\r\nfortresses on the Mincio, and was answered; her views were entirely\r\nerroneous, and her apprehensions exaggerated. It will require the\r\ngreatest caution on our part not to lose our neutral position, nor\r\nto be made the advocate of one side. Are the wishes of the Lombards,\r\nTuscans, etc., really ascertainable, while their countries are\r\noccupied by French and Sardinian armies? The Queen encloses an extract\r\nof a letter from the first Napoleon to his son, Prince Eugène,[59]\r\nshowing how the expression of a wish for annexation has already of old\r\nbeen used as a means for conquest.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg, son\r\n    of the Empress Josephine by her first marriage, and adopted\r\n    son of Napoleon I.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _13th July 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received the news of a concluded peace,[60] which Lord\r\nJohn Russell has sent to her yesterday, with as much surprise as it\r\nmust have caused Lord John. It was a joyous intelligence, as far\r\nas the stopping of the further effusion of innocent blood and the\r\nsecurity against further diplomatic complications is concerned, but\r\nit gives cause for serious reflection. The Emperor Napoleon, by\r\nhis military successes, and great apparent moderation or prudence\r\nimmediately after them, has created for himself a most formidable\r\nposition of strength in Europe. It is remarkable that he has acted\r\ntowards Austria now just as he did towards Russia after the fall of\r\nSebastopol; and if it was our lot then to be left alone to act the\r\npart of the extortioner whilst he acted that of the generous victor,\r\nthe Queen is doubly glad that we should not now have fallen into the\r\ntrap, to ask Austria (as friends and neutrals) concessions which he\r\nwas ready to waive. He will now probably omit no occasion to cajole\r\nAustria as he has done to Russia, and turn her spirit of revenge upon\r\nPrussia and Germany--the Emperor's probable next victims. Should he\r\nthus have rendered himself the master of the entire Continent, the\r\ntime may come for us either to obey or to fight him with terrible odds\r\nagainst us. This has been the Queen's view from the beginning of this\r\ncomplication, and events have hitherto wonderfully supported them. How\r\nItaly is to prosper under the Pope's presidency, whose misgovernment\r\nof his own small portion of it was the ostensible cause of the war,\r\nthe Queen is at a loss to conceive.

She entirely agrees with him \"that we\r\nhave no reason to seek a quarrel with France,\" and that \"the most\r\nsimple and most safe and most honest\" line of conduct for us will be\r\n\"to be well armed, and to be just to all our neighbours.\"\r\n\r\nShe trusts that as the poor Duchess of Parma[61] appears to be\r\noverlooked in the Italian Peace merely because nobody thinks it his\r\nbusiness to befriend her, we shall in the above spirit ask for justice\r\nand consideration for her.\r\n\r\nThe Queen concurs with Lord John that it will now be useless to\r\ncommunicate to France the advice given to the Porte.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: Louise Marie de Bourbon, daughter of the Duc de\r\n    Berri, and widow of Charles III., Duke of Parma.

But after mature\r\nreflection, I think it best you should be in possession of an accurate\r\nand conscientious account of the sentiments of His Holiness in the\r\npresent important juncture of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Caro mio Russell,\" the Pope said, \"you have been so long at Naples\r\nthat I was already thinking of sending after you to bring you back; we\r\ndo not like you to leave us, and the more so as I have heard you were\r\nattached to the Mission of Mr Elliot,[62] who is a son of Lord Minto;\r\nand if he entertains the same political views as his father, he is a\r\ndangerous man to the peace of Italy. Now I knew Lord Minto here, and\r\nalthough he may be a very good man, I do not think him a man of any\r\ncapacity, and his doctrines were calculated to bring on the ruin of\r\nItaly.\"\r\n\r\nI replied, \"I cannot agree with your Holiness, for I consider Lord\r\nMinto to be a very clever man, whose honest, sound, and liberal views,\r\nhad they been listened to, might have prevented the crisis which is\r\nnow convulsing Italy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pope said, \"Well, of course you belong to his party, but, _Poveri\r\nnoi!_ what is to become of us with your uncle and Lord Palmerston at\r\nthe head of affairs in England? They have always sympathised with the\r\nturbulent spirits of Italy, and their accession to power will greatly\r\nincrease the hopes of the Piedmontese Party. Indeed, I well know what\r\nthe English Government want: they want to see the Pope deprived of his\r\ntemporal power.\"\r\n\r\nI replied, \"Again I regret to find your Holiness so entirely mistaken\r\nwith respect to the policy of England. We derive great happiness from\r\nour free institutions, and we would be glad to see our neighbours in\r\nEurope as happy and as prosperous as we are, but we have no wish to\r\ninterfere with the internal concerns of other nations, or to give\r\nadvice without being asked for it; least of all as a Protestant\r\nPower would _we_ think of interfering one way or the other with the\r\nGovernment of your Holiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pope said, \"I do not doubt the good intentions of England, but\r\nunfortunately you do not understand this country, and your example\r\nis dangerous to the Italian minds, your speeches in Parliament excite\r\nthem, and you fancy because constitutional liberties and institutions\r\nsuit you, that they must suit all the world. Now the Italians are a\r\ndissatisfied, interfering, turbulent and intriguing race; they can\r\nnever learn to govern themselves, it is impossible; only see how they\r\nfollow Sardinia in all she tells them to do, simply because they love\r\nintrigue and revolution, whilst in reality they do not know what they\r\nwant; a hot-headed people like the Italians require a firm and just\r\ngovernment to guide and take care of them, and Italy might have\r\ncontinued tranquil and contented, had not the ambition of Sardinia led\r\nher to revolutionise the whole country. The Grand Duke of Tuscany,\r\nfor instance, is an excellent and just man, and nevertheless, at the\r\ninstigation of Piedmont, he was turned out of the country, and for no\r\nearthly purpose. I suppose you have read Monsieur About's book about\r\nRome[63]? well, all he says is untrue, pure calumny, and it would be\r\neasy for me to have it all refuted; but he is really not worthy of\r\nsuch an honour. His book, I see, has been translated into English,\r\nand I have no doubt it will be much read and believed in England. Such\r\nbooks and our refugees mislead your countrymen, and I often wonder at\r\nthe language your statesmen hold about us in the Houses of Parliament.\r\nI always read their speeches. Lord Palmerston, Lord John Russell,\r\nand Mr Gladstone do not know us; but when I think how kindly and\r\nhospitably Lord Granville was received at Rome last winter, and then\r\nread the extraordinary speech he made last February about us, I think\r\nthe gout he suffered from here must have gone to his head when he\r\nreached England, and I wonder how Her Majesty the Queen could send\r\nfor him to form a Government! Then again, Mr Gladstone, who allowed\r\nhimself to be deceived about the Neapolitan prisoners--he does not\r\nknow us and Italy--and Mr Cobden,--I knew him in 1847--he is always in\r\nfavour of peace, and he must be very fond of animals, for when he came\r\nhere from Spain he wanted me to write to that country and put a stop\r\nto bull-fights--a very good man, but I do not know his views about\r\nItaly. And Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, do you think he will be\r\nemployed again? he seemed so anxious to get a place. Mr Disraeli was\r\nmy friend; I regret him. But tell me, _caro mio Russell_, if you are a\r\nprophet, how all this war and fuss is to end?\"\r\n\r\nI replied, \"Your Holiness has better claims to being a prophet than\r\nI have, and I sincerely hope all this may end well for Italy; but\r\nas regards the present and the past, I must again say that I deeply\r\nregret to see your Holiness misconceive the honest views and sincere\r\nsympathies of the statesmen you have named, for the welfare of Italy;\r\nthey would like to see Italy independent, prosperous, progressing and\r\ncontented, and able to take care of herself without foreign troops.\r\nYour Holiness has done me the honour to speak freely and openly with\r\nme; permit me to do the same, and ask your Holiness what England must\r\nthink when she sees the temporal power of your Holiness imposed\r\nupon three millions of people by the constant presence of French\r\nand Austrian bayonets, and when, after ten years of occupation,\r\nthe Austrians withdraw suddenly, there is at once an insurrection\r\nthroughout the country; and if the French were to leave Rome it is\r\ngenerally acknowledged that a revolution would compel your Holiness to\r\nseek refuge in some foreign country. At the same time, when the troops\r\nof your Holiness are employed as at Perugia,[64] the Government is\r\ntoo weak to control them; they pillage and murder, and, instead\r\nof investigating their conduct, the excesses committed by them are\r\npublicly rewarded.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pope smiled, paused, took a pinch of snuff, and then said\r\ngood-humouredly: \"Although I am not a prophet, I know one thing; this\r\nwar will be followed by an European Congress, and a Congress about\r\nItalian Affairs is even worse for us than war. There will be changes\r\nin Italy, but mark my words, whatever these changes are, the Pope will\r\never be the Pope, whether he dwells in the Vatican or lives concealed\r\nin the Catacombs.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, I will give you some advice. Prepare and take care of\r\nyourselves in England, for I am quite certain the French Emperor\r\nintends sooner or later to attack you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pope then beckoned to me to approach, and making the sign of the\r\nCross, he gave me his blessing in Latin, then with both his hands,\r\nhe took one of mine, pressed it, and said with great warmth, \"Be our\r\nfriend in the hour of need.\" I have the honour to be, etc., etc.,\r\n\r\nODO RUSSELL.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: Mr (afterwards Sir) Henry Elliot, P.C., G.C.B.,\r\n    was Plenipotentiary to Naples.

Her position in Germany is at\r\npresent very painful, and may be for the future very dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe Queen feels strongly that we are not without considerable\r\nresponsibility in having from the first urged her to take no part in\r\nthe war, which certainly had great influence on her actions--and she\r\nwill very naturally look to us not to desert her when the evil hour\r\nfor her may come.[67]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 65: These were letters from Lord Cowley and Sir\r\n    James Hudson in reference to the Peace of Villafranca. The\r\n    former announced, as a result of his conversation with the\r\n    Empress and other persons, that among the causes which induced\r\n    the French Emperor to consent to peace were his horror at\r\n    any further sacrifice of life and time, disgust at what he\r\n    considered Italian apathy for the cause which the French\r\n    were upholding, and distrust of the intentions of the King\r\n    of Sardinia and Count Cavour. Sir James Hudson described the\r\n    unanimous feeling at Turin that the Nationalist cause had been\r\n    betrayed. Cavour, he wrote, could obtain no further response\r\n    to his remonstrances with Napoleon than \"Il fait bien chaud:\r\n    il fait bien chaud.\" Moreover, Napoleon knew (continued Sir\r\n    James) \"that Mazzini had dogged his footsteps to Milan, for,\r\n    the day before yesterday, sixty-six Orsini bombshells were\r\n    discovered there by the chief of the Sardinian police, who\r\n    arrested the man (a known follower of Mazzini) who had them.\r\n    The story is that he brought them from England for the purpose\r\n    of using them against the Austrians!!\" Count Cavour, who\r\n    resigned in disgust and was succeeded by Rattazzi, remained\r\n    out of office till the following January.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 66: He stated that he believed he could obtain\r\n    better terms direct from the French Emperor than those to\r\n    which England, Russia, and Prussia were likely to give their\r\n    moral support as a basis of mediation.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 67: Lord Cowley wrote to Lord John Russell on the\r\n    20th of July:--\r\n\r\n    \"... The two Emperors met in the most cordial manner, shaking\r\n    hands as if no difference had existed between them. As soon as\r\n    they were alone, the Emperor of Austria took the initiative,\r\n    and stated at once that he was ready to cede to the Emperor\r\n    of the French, for the sake of the restoration of peace, the\r\n    territory which the latter had conquered, but that he could\r\n    not do more, giving the reasons which I have mentioned to\r\n    your Lordship in former despatches. The Emperor of the French\r\n    replied that his own position in France, and the public\r\n    declarations which he had made, rendered something in addition\r\n    necessary: that the war had been undertaken for the freedom of\r\n    Italy, and that he could not justify to France a peace\r\n    which did not ensure this object. The Emperor Francis\r\n    Joseph rejoined that he had no objection to offer to the\r\n    Confederation which formed part of the Emperor Napoleon's\r\n    programme, and that he was ready to enter it with Venetia, and\r\n    when the Emperor Napoleon remarked that such a result would be\r\n    a derision, if the whole power and influence of Austria were\r\n    to be brought to bear upon the Confederation, the Emperor\r\n    Francis Joseph exclaimed against any such interpretation being\r\n    given to his words, his idea being that Venetia should be\r\n    placed on the same footing, in the Italian Confederation, as\r\n    Luxemburg holds in the Germanic Confederation....\r\n\r\n    \"In the course of conversation between the two Imperial\r\n    Sovereigns, the Emperor of Austria remarked to the Emperor of\r\n    the French with many expressions of goodwill, and of a desire\r\n    to see the dynasty of the latter firmly established on\r\n    the throne of France, that His Majesty took an odd way to\r\n    accomplish his end. 'Believe me,' said the Emperor Francis\r\n    Joseph, 'dynasties are not established by having recourse to\r\n    such bad company as you have chosen; revolutionists overturn,\r\n    but do not construct.' The Emperor Napoleon appears to have\r\n    taken the remark in very good part, and even to have excused\r\n    himself to a certain degree, observing that it was a further\r\n    reason that the Emperor Francis Joseph should aid him in\r\n    putting an end to the war, and to the revolutionary spirit to\r\n    which the war had given rise.\r\n\r\n    \"The Emperors having separated in the same cordial manner in\r\n    which they had met, the Emperor of the French himself drew up\r\n    the preliminaries and sent them in the evening to Verona\r\n    by his cousin, the Prince Napoleon. Being introduced to the\r\n    Emperor of Austria, who received His Imperial Highness\r\n    very courteously, His Majesty said, after reading the\r\n    preliminaries, that he must beg the Prince to excuse him for\r\n    a short time, as he had others to consult before signing them.\r\n    He then went into an adjoining room where, according to Prince\r\n    Napoleon's account, a loud and angry discussion ensued, in\r\n    which the Prince distinguished the Emperor's voice broken by\r\n    tears, as if His Majesty had been obliged to have recourse to\r\n    persuasion, to silence the opposition made to the conditions,\r\n    and it was not until some time had elapsed that His Majesty\r\n    returned and signed the paper containing them, or rather\r\n    I infer that he retained the paper signed by the Emperor\r\n    Napoleon, and returned one of similar purport signed by\r\n    himself; for among all the curious circumstances connected\r\n    with this transaction, not the least curious is the fact that\r\n    there does not exist any document recording the preliminaries\r\n    with the double signature of both Emperors.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: INDIAN AFFAIRS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Sir Charles Wood._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _23rd July 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's attention has been attracted by No. 86 (Foreign\r\nDepartment) of the printed abstracts of letters received from India,\r\nrelating to the affairs of Bussahir.[68] She would ask Sir C.

There are many points\r\nin it to which she cannot but feel the gravest objections. It is\r\nunnecessary, however, for her to go into these details, as it is\r\nagainst the principle of England volunteering at this moment the\r\nintrusion of a scheme of her own for the redistribution of the\r\nterritories and Governments of Northern Italy, that she must above all\r\nprotest. Moreover, a step of such importance, reversing the principle\r\nof non-intervention, which the Queen's Government has hitherto\r\npublicly declared and upheld, should, in the Queen's opinion, not be\r\nbrought before her without having received the fullest deliberation\r\nand concurrence of the assembled Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 69: A month earlier, on his return from the war, the\r\n    Emperor had tried to enlist British support in his scheme for\r\n    a European congress.

If\r\nintervention were to mean giving friendly advice, or even offering\r\nmediation, your Majesty's Government from January to May would have\r\npursued a course of intervention, for they were all that time advising\r\nAustria, France, Sardinia, and Germany.\r\n\r\nIf by friendly and judicious advice we can prevent a bloody and\r\ncauseless war in Italy we are bound to give such advice.\r\n\r\nIf we refrain from doing so, we may ultimately be obliged to have\r\nrecourse to intervention; that is to say, we may have to interfere\r\nagainst the ruthless tyranny of Austria, or the unchained ambition\r\nof France.

With regard to Lord John's letter of to-day, the Queen wishes\r\nmerely to say that from the outbreak of the war our negotiations have\r\nceased, and that the war is not over till the peace is concluded. Our\r\ninterference before that period may be prompted by a desire to prevent\r\na future war; but our first duty is not to interfere with the closing\r\nof the present. The desire to guard Italy against \"the ruthless\r\ntyranny of Austria, and the unchained ambition of France\" may produce\r\na state of things in Italy, forcing both to make common cause against\r\nher, and backed by the rest of Europe to isolate England, and making\r\nher responsible for the issue. It will be little satisfaction then to\r\nreflect upon the fact that our interference has been merely _advice_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FOREIGN POLICY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n94 PICCADILLY, _23rd August 1859_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nbegs to state that Lord John Russell has shown him your Majesty's\r\ncommunication, in which your Majesty objects to a proposed despatch\r\nto Lord Cowley, on the ground that it would be a departure from the\r\nprinciple of non-intervention which has been publicly proclaimed\r\nas the rule for Great Britain in the late events between France and\r\nAustria. But Viscount Palmerston would beg humbly to submit to your\r\nMajesty that the intervention which all parties agreed that this\r\ncountry ought to abstain from, was active interference by force of\r\narms in the war then going on, but that neither of the great political\r\nparties meant or asserted that this country should not interfere by\r\nits advice and opinions in regard to the matters to which the war\r\nrelated. Viscount Palmerston can assert that neither he nor any of\r\nthose who were acting with him out of office ever contemplated giving\r\nsuch a meaning to the doctrine of non-intervention; and that such a\r\nmeaning never was attached to it by the Conservative Leaders while\r\nthey were in office, is proved from one end of their Blue Book to the\r\nother.[70] The whole course of the Derby Government, in regard to\r\nthe matters on which the war turned, was one uninterrupted series of\r\ninterventions by advice, by opinions, and by censure now addressed to\r\none party and now to another. Whatever may be thought of the judgment\r\nwhich was shown by them, or of the bias by which they were guided, the\r\nprinciple on which they acted was undoubtedly right and proper.\r\n\r\nEngland is one of the greatest powers of the world, no event or series\r\nof events bearing on the balance of power, or on probabilities of\r\npeace or war can be matters of indifference to her, and her right to\r\nhave and to express opinions on matters thus bearing on her interests\r\nis unquestionable; and she is equally entitled to give upon such\r\nmatters any advice which she may think useful, or to suggest any\r\narrangements which she may deem conducive to the general good.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true that the Conservative Party, since they have\r\nceased to be responsible for the conduct of affairs, have held a\r\ndifferent doctrine, and in their anxiety lest the influence of England\r\nshould be exerted for the benefit of Italy, and to the disadvantage of\r\nAustria, have contended that any participation by Great Britain in the\r\nnegotiations for the settlement of Italy would be a departure from the\r\nprinciple of non-intervention; but their own practice while in office\r\nrefutes their newly adopted doctrine in opposition; and if that\r\ndoctrine were to be admitted, Great Britain would, by her own act,\r\nreduce herself to the rank of a third-class European State.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 70: This was the Blue Book, the production of which\r\n    would, according to Lord Malmesbury, have saved the Derby\r\n    Ministry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ITALIAN POLICY]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND LORD JOHN RUSSELL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _24th August 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is really placed in a position of much difficulty, giving\r\nher deep pain. She has been obliged to object to so many drafts sent\r\nto her from the Foreign Office on the Italian Question, and yet, no\r\nsooner is one withdrawn or altered, than others are submitted exactly\r\nof the same purport or tendency, if even couched in new words. The\r\nQueen has so often expressed her views that she is almost reluctant\r\nto reiterate them. She wishes, however, Lord John to re-peruse the two\r\ndrafts enclosed, which just came to her. If they have any meaning or\r\nobject, it must be to show to France that it would be to her interest\r\nto break in the Treaty of Zurich the leading conditions to which\r\nshe pledged herself to Austria at Villafranca. Those preliminaries\r\ncontained but three provisions affecting Austria: (1) That Austria\r\nwas to cede Lombardy; (2) That an Italian Confederation should be\r\nencouraged, of which Venetia was to form part; (3) That the Dukes of\r\nTuscany and Modena were to return to their Duchies. The two latter\r\nclauses must be considered as compensations for the losses inflicted\r\nin the first. Both the latter are now to be recommended by England, a\r\nneutral in the war, to be broken.\r\n\r\nNow, either it is expected that our advice will not be listened to, in\r\nwhich case it would not be useful and hardly dignified to give it,\r\nor it is expected that France will follow it. If, on finding herself\r\ncheated, Austria were to feel herself obliged to take up arms again,\r\nwe should be directly answerable for this fresh war. What would then\r\nbe our alternative? Either to leave France in the lurch, to re-fight\r\nher own battle, which would entail lasting danger and disgrace on this\r\ncountry, or to join her in the fresh war against Austria--a misfortune\r\nfrom which the Queen feels herself equally bound to protect her\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs this is a question of principle on which she clearly understood her\r\nCabinet to have been unanimous, she must ask her correspondence to be\r\ncirculated amongst its members, with a view to ascertain whether they\r\nalso would be parties to its reversal, and in order to prevent the\r\nnecessity of these frequent discussions, which, as the Queen has\r\nalready said, are very painful to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MEDIATION OF LORD GRANVILLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Granville to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _29th August 1859_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the middle of last week I received at Aldenham a letter from\r\nMr Sidney Herbert,[71] in which he told me that he had just received\r\na visit from Lord Palmerston, much perturbed and annoyed, saying that\r\nthe Queen had objected to all Lord John's despatches, and appeared to\r\nthink that it was objectionable for England to give any advice on the\r\nsubject of Italian affairs. Mr Herbert gave some good advice to Lord\r\nPalmerston, but, from the tone of his letter, I gather that he\r\nthought the objections made at Osborne unreasonable. I answered that\r\nI entirely concurred with him in the interest of everybody, that no\r\nfeelings of irritation should exist between the Sovereign and her\r\nleading Ministers; that it was possible that the Queen, forgetting\r\nhow very sensitive Lord John was to criticism, had pulled him up more\r\nsharply than he liked, but that I was convinced the objections made\r\nwere not exactly those mentioned by Lord Palmerston. I heard nothing\r\nmore till I received on Saturday evening a telegram, summoning me to a\r\nCabinet this day. I came to Town immediately, and saw Lord Palmerston\r\nyesterday. I enquired the reason of the sudden summons for a Cabinet.\r\nHe told me that there had been a discussion between the Queen and Lord\r\nJohn; that the Queen had objected to his (Lord John's) proposal that\r\nthe despatch of 25th July should be now communicated to the French\r\nGovernment. Lord John had informed him of the fact, and had requested\r\nhim to communicate with the Queen on the subject. Lord Palmerston\r\nthen read to me a well-written memorandum on the abstract question of\r\ngiving advice, which he had sent to Her Majesty. He told me that he\r\nhad been to Osborne; that the Queen had expressed a wish through Sir\r\nCharles Wood that he should not discuss the whole matter with her;\r\nthat he had had a satisfactory conversation with your Royal Highness,\r\nof which he gave me an abstract, which, however, contained his own\r\narguments at greater length than your Royal Highness's. He said that\r\nLord John had made a mistake with respect to the end of the despatch,\r\nin which Lord Cowley is desired to withhold it till after the Peace of\r\nZurich was concluded. Lord John gave a different interpretation to it\r\nfrom what appeared to be the case, as described by a previous letter\r\nof Lord John, in which he had said that the sentence was added at\r\nthe suggestion of the Cabinet, and with his entire approval. Lord\r\nPalmerston states that the Queen did not feel herself authorised\r\nto sanction a departure from what had been decided by the Cabinet,\r\nwithout the concurrence of the Cabinet, and that she thought it\r\ndesirable, if the Cabinet met, that they should agree on the future\r\npolicy as regards Italy. Lord John also wished for a Cabinet.\r\n\r\nI replied that there seemed to be a double question: first, a\r\ndifference between the Queen and Lord John Russell and himself; and\r\nsecond, the whole question of our Italian Policy. On the first point\r\nI could not but remember the apprehension generally felt at the\r\nformation of his first Government; that the feeling between the\r\nSovereign and himself might not be such as to give strength to the\r\nGovernment; that the result, however, was most satisfactory. I was not\r\naware of either the Queen or himself having given way on any one\r\npoint of principle, but the best understanding was kept up in the most\r\nhonourable way to both, and that, at the end of his Ministry, I knew\r\nthat the Queen had expressed to several persons how much she regretted\r\nto lose his services. That I most sincerely hoped that there was\r\nno chance of misunderstanding now arising; that would be most\r\ndisadvantageous to the Sovereign, to the public service, to the\r\nGovernment, and, above all, to himself. He interrupted me by assuring\r\nme that there was not the slightest chance of this. He repeated to\r\nme flattering things said by the Queen at the close of his last\r\nAdministration, and told me that it was impossible for the Queen to\r\nhave been more kind and civil than at his visit last week at Osborne.\r\nI continued that in Italian matters I believed the Cabinet was agreed.\r\nOur language to Italian Governments ought to show sympathy with Italy,\r\nand let them know that we were anxious that they should be left free\r\nto act and decide for themselves; that it should inform them in the\r\nclearest manner that in no case were they to obtain active assistance\r\nfrom us, and it ought to avoid giving any advice as to their conduct,\r\nwhich might make us responsible for the evil or danger which might\r\naccrue from following such advice. That our language to France and\r\nAustria ought to press upon them in every _judicious_ manner the\r\nexpediency of doing that which was likely to secure the permanent\r\nhappiness of Italy, and to persuade them to abstain from forcing upon\r\nthe Italians, persons and forms of Government to which they objected;\r\nnothing like a menace or a promise to be used....\r\n\r\nI then saw Sidney Herbert, who told me that Charles Wood's report\r\nhad entirely changed the aspect of things; that it was clear that the\r\nQueen had come to the assistance of the Cabinet, instead of opposing\r\nthem; that reason had been entirely on her side, and that Johnny had\r\nreduced the question now to the single point, which was not of much\r\nimportance, whether the 25th July despatch should now be communicated\r\nor not. He told me that Lord John was in a state of great irritation,\r\nand ready to kick over the traces. I dined at Lord Palmerston's, and\r\nmet Sir Charles Wood and Mr Gladstone. I had some guarded conversation\r\nwith the latter, who seemed very reasonable. Sir Charles Wood gave me\r\nall the information which I required. It appears to me that the\r\nreally important point is that the whole Cabinet should know the real\r\nquestion between the Queen and her Ministers, and that, if Lord John\r\ncan find plausible reasons for changing the date of the communication\r\nof the despatch, it may be better for the Queen to consent to this.\r\nSome of us will take care to have a decided opinion about the future\r\ncourse of our policy.\r\n\r\nI presume Sir George Grey will be at the Cabinet, and will be able to\r\nreport to your Royal Highness what has passed. If he is not there, I\r\nwill write again. I have the honour to be, Sir, with great respect,\r\nyour Royal Highness's obedient, humble, and faithful Servant,\r\n\r\nGRANVILLE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 71: See Lord Fitzmaurice's _Life of Lord Granville_,\r\n    vol. i. chap. xiii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S POSITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Granville to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nPRIVY COUNCIL OFFICE, _29th August 1859_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Cabinet was very satisfactory. Lord John looked ill, and\r\nevidently ashamed of much of his case. Many of the Cabinet\r\nthought that the despatch of 25th July had not only been sent but\r\ncommunicated. Others attached a different meaning to the closing\r\nparagraph than what it appears to bear. Lord John produced a most\r\nobjectionable draft of despatch in lieu of that of the 25th. It was\r\nuniversally condemned, and Lord Palmerston was empowered to tell the\r\nQueen that the Cabinet now thought that the despatch of the 25th might\r\nbe communicated.\r\n\r\nLords Palmerston and John Russell asked for further powers during the\r\nRecess, and recommended that we should give an opinion in favour of\r\nannexation of duchies to Sardinia. This was decidedly objected to, and\r\nwe all professed our readiness to meet again if necessary.[72]\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet thoroughly understood what had passed between the Queen\r\nand her two Ministers, although we could not get Lord John to show us\r\nall we required.\r\n\r\nGladstone took me aside after it was over to say that I must have\r\nthought him stupid yesterday evening, that now he knew the facts he\r\nthought Her Majesty had been put to most unnecessary annoyance. The\r\nChancellor said something of the same sort. I never saw the Cabinet\r\nmore united.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll, Lord Elgin, and Mr Cardwell were absent.

Here we have the very\r\ninterference with advice to which the Queen had objected when\r\nofficially brought before her for her sanction, to which the Cabinet\r\nobjected, and which Lord John Russell agreed to withdraw, carried\r\non by direct communication of the Prime Minister through the French\r\nAmbassador with the Emperor; and we have the very effect produced\r\nwhich the Queen dreaded, viz. the French Minister insinuating that\r\nwe called upon his master to do that which he would consider so\r\ndishonourable that he would rather resign than be a party to it! What\r\nis the use of the Queen's open and, she fears, sometimes wearisome\r\ncorrespondence, with her Ministers, what the use of long deliberations\r\nof the Cabinet, if the very policy can be carried out by indirect\r\nmeans which is set aside officially, and what protection has the Queen\r\nagainst this practice? Lord John Russell's distinction also between\r\nhis own official and private opinion or advice given to a Foreign\r\nMinister is a most dangerous, and, the Queen thinks, untenable theory,\r\nopen to the same objections, for what he states will have the weight\r\nof the official character of the Foreign Secretary, whether stated\r\nas his private or his public opinion. His advice to the Marquis\r\nd'Azeglio[73] is moreover quite open to the inference drawn by Count\r\nWalewski, that it is an encouragement to _Sardinia_, to Military\r\nintervention in and occupation of the Duchies, and Lord John Russell's\r\nanswer hardly meets this point if left as it stands at present;\r\nfor \"the _name_ of the King of Sardinia,... _the chief of a\r\nwell-disciplined army_,\" will have little influence unless he is\r\nprepared to use that army.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must ask Lord John to instruct Lord Cowley to state to Count\r\nWalewski that no opinions expressed on Foreign Policy are those of\r\n\"Her Majesty's Government\" but those which are given in the official\r\nand regular way, and that Her Majesty's Government never thought of\r\nadvising the French Government to break the solemn engagements into\r\nwhich the Emperor Napoleon entered towards the Emperor of Austria at\r\nVillafranca.\r\n\r\nThe Queen asks Lord John to communicate this letter to Lord\r\nPalmerston.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 73: Massimo d'Azeglio, Sardinian Commissioner in the\r\n    Romagna.

She is glad to find that he thinks\r\nthat no answer ought to be given to Count Persigny, but she thinks\r\nit important that it should be _stated to him that no answer can\r\nbe given_. Unfortunately, here has been again the Prime Minister\r\ndeclaring that he _quite agrees_ with the French Ambassador, but that\r\nthe proposal should come officially from France to be placed before\r\nthe Cabinet. The inference must be that the Cabinet and the Queen\r\nwill, as a matter of course, agree also, when it is so submitted. Now\r\nwhat is it that Lord Palmerston has approved? A plan for an alliance\r\nof England with France for the purpose of _overruling_ Austria, if the\r\nDuchies in which she is the heir, and to which the Archdukes were to\r\nreturn in accordance with the stipulations of Villafranca, were given\r\nto Sardinia and Austria should object. It is hoped indeed that this\r\nwill not immediately lead to war with her, but France is to expect\r\nthat she will not be left to fight single-handed for an object\r\ndeclared to be more English than French! Thus we are dragged step by\r\nstep into the position of a party in the Italian strife. The Queen\r\nthinks it incumbent upon her not to leave Lord John Russell in\r\nignorance of the fact that _she_ could not approve such a policy\r\nreversing our whole position since the commencement of the War.\r\n\r\nThe Queen must leave it to Lord John to consider how far it would be\r\nfair to his colleagues in the Cabinet to leave them unacquainted with\r\nthe various private steps lately taken, which must seriously affect\r\ntheir free consideration of the important question upon which they\r\nhave hitherto pledged themselves to a distinct principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _6th September 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns to Lord Palmerston his correspondence with M. de\r\nPersigny. Lord John Russell will have sent him her letter to him on\r\nthis subject. She has nothing to add, but to repeat her conviction\r\nof the great danger and inconvenience arising out of such private\r\ncommunications, and the apprehension she must naturally feel that\r\nthe attempt to convince the Emperor Napoleon that it would be for his\r\ninterest to break his word to the Emperor of Austria should reflect\r\nupon the honour of the Queen's Government. She must insist upon this\r\nbeing distinctly guarded against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL'S CRITICISMS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nABERGELDIE, _7th September 1859_.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he\r\ncannot refrain from making some remarks on your Majesty's letter of\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston appears to have answered M. de Persigny by saying\r\nthat he personally agreed with him, but that the proposition he had\r\nsketched must come from the French Government; that it must come from\r\nthem officially, and it would then have to be maturely considered by\r\nthe Cabinet.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell sees nothing to object to in this language. It might\r\nbe embarrassing to Lord Palmerston if such a proposition were to\r\ncome from France, and were to be rejected by the Cabinet. But Lord\r\nPalmerston could easily explain the matter to M. de Persigny. Lord\r\nPalmerston does not appear to have committed your Majesty, or Lord\r\nJohn Russell, or the Cabinet in any way.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, your Majesty cannot mean that the Cabinet is to\r\nbe precluded from maturely considering any proposition which may come\r\nofficially from France.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell feels, on his own part, that he must offer to your\r\nMajesty such advice as he thinks best adapted to secure the interests\r\nand dignity of your Majesty and the country. He will be held by\r\nParliament responsible for that advice. It will be always in your\r\nMajesty's power to reject it altogether.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell is of opinion that there never was a time when it\r\nwas less expedient to fetter this country by prospective engagements.\r\nBut it does not follow that the policy pursued last autumn and winter,\r\nand which ended in a war in Italy, would be the best course in any\r\nfuture contingency. Should another war arise it will be very difficult\r\nfor Great Britain to remain neutral. For this reason it is desirable\r\nto prevent such a war, if possible. It was difficult last winter, and\r\nmay be still more difficult this winter. For the present there is no\r\nbetter course than to keep this country free from engagements. After\r\nthe peace of Zurich is made, or not made, we shall see our way better.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has never concealed his opinions from his\r\ncolleagues. He even warned them that France might make such a\r\nproposition as M. de Persigny now contemplates.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter from Lord Palmerston and Mr Fane's[74] despatch\r\nwill show the feelings which exist between Austria and Prussia. The\r\nEmperor Napoleon does not appear to have satisfied Prince Metternich.\r\nHis object evidently is to gain time.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 74: Julian Henry Fane, son of the eleventh Earl of\r\n    Westmorland, and Secretary of Embassy at Vienna.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _7th September 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter. She can ask for\r\nnothing better than \"that we should be kept from any engagements,\" and\r\nshe never could have intended to convey the impression that she wished\r\nto \"see the Cabinet precluded from taking into consideration any\r\nproposal France might make.\" What she objects to is binding beforehand\r\nthe Government by expressions of opinion of its leading members to the\r\nFrench Government, and thus _bringing about_ those French proposals\r\nwhich it will be most embarrassing to the Cabinet either to reject\r\nor adopt. It is absolutely necessary, therefore, that the French\r\nGovernment should be told that the opinions given were private\r\nopinions not binding the Government. Lord John has not yet sent to the\r\nQueen drafts in conformity with her wishes expressed in her letter of\r\nthe day before yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTERS TO FOREIGN SOVEREIGNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROADLANDS, _9th September 1859_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\r\nhad the honour to receive your Majesty's communication of the 6th of\r\nthis month; and although he had the honour of addressing your Majesty\r\nyesterday afternoon, he deems it his duty to submit some observations\r\nupon this communication.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty states that Viscount Palmerston in his letter to Count\r\nPersigny endeavoured to persuade the Emperor of the French to break\r\nhis word to the Emperor of Austria, but Viscount Palmerston must beg\r\nvery respectfully but entirely to deny that accusation....[75]\r\n\r\nYour Majesty is pleased to observe upon the danger and inconvenience\r\nof private communications with Foreign Ministers, and to add that\r\nyour Majesty must insist upon this being distinctly guarded against.\r\nViscount [Palmerston] would be very desirous of knowing the precise\r\nmeaning of those last words. If your Majesty means that what is to be\r\nguarded against is any attempt to induce a Foreign Sovereign to break\r\nhis word, Viscount Palmerston cordially subscribes to that opinion,\r\nand maintains that he has not done so in the past, and declares that\r\nhe has no intention of doing so in the future. But if your\r\nMajesty's meaning is that Viscount Palmerston is to be debarred\r\nfrom communicating with Foreign Ministers except for the purpose\r\nof informing them officially of formal decisions of the British\r\nGovernment, Viscount Palmerston would beg humbly and respectfully to\r\nrepresent to your Majesty that such a curtailment of the proper and\r\nconstitutional functions of the office which he holds would render\r\nit impossible for him to serve your Majesty consistently with his own\r\nhonour or with advantage to the public interest.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 75: Lord Palmerston then gives a very long and\r\n    detailed account of his position.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S OPINION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _11th September 1859_.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston has written (on the 8th) a long letter to the Queen,\r\nwhich, besides giving his private opinion on the politics of Italy,\r\nwhich were not disputed, purports to show that when a principle\r\nof policy had been adopted by the Cabinet and sanctioned by the\r\nSovereign, the Foreign Secretary ought not to be impeded in carrying\r\nout the details, either by objections raised to them by the Sovereign,\r\nor by making them dependent on the meetings of Cabinets, difficult to\r\nobtain at this time of year. Now the question raised by the Queen\r\nwas _just the reverse_. The principle adopted by the Cabinet and\r\nsanctioned by the Queen was: not to interfere by active advice with\r\nthe peace to be made at Zurich; the Foreign Secretary had submitted a\r\ndraft which had appeared to the Queen to be in contradiction to this\r\nprinciple, which, upon the Sovereign's objection, he withdrew; the\r\nCabinet was summoned and rejected a similar draft submitted to them,\r\nand the Queen then complained that the very same advice should have\r\nbeen given by the Prime Minister in an indirect way to which the\r\nSovereign and Cabinet could not agree openly. Lord Palmerston's letter\r\nwas not communicated to the Queen until it had been alluded to in a\r\npublic despatch, and Count Walewski had insinuated to our Ambassador\r\nthat, rather than be a party to a line of conduct, which he would look\r\nupon as dishonourable for his master, he would resign office. What the\r\nQueen has asked for is: an intimation to the French Government that\r\nprivate communications like that of Lord Palmerston to M. de Persigny\r\nmust not be looked upon as the official expression of the opinion of\r\nHer Majesty's Government, and that we disclaim ever having intended\r\nto induce the Emperor to break his engagements made at Villafranca,\r\nwhatever they may have been. The Queen does not conceive that Lord\r\nPalmerston can object to this course, nor does he attempt to do so in\r\nhis letter.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--Since writing the above the Queen has received Lord\r\nPalmerston's letter of the 9th. As she has just written at length,\r\nshe does not conceive that it would be necessary to make any further\r\nobservations in reply, except to a distinct question put by him in\r\nthe latter part of his letter, viz. what the Queen wishes to have\r\n\"distinctly guarded against.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the danger and inconvenience of private communications with\r\nForeign Ministers, without a distinct understanding that they are\r\nstrictly private, and not to be treated as conveying the opinions of\r\nHer Majesty's Government, where the sanction of the Crown and adhesion\r\nof the Cabinet have not been obtained. Lord John Russell has now\r\nexpressed this in a paragraph in one of his drafts to Lord Cowley,\r\nwhich he will send to Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the necessity of such caution, the Queen, has only to\r\nrefer to the public use made of Lord Palmerston's private letter\r\nto Count Persigny, and the use made to our prejudice by the Emperor\r\nNapoleon at the time of the armistice at Villafranca of a private\r\ncommunication with Count Persigny, which was represented to imply\r\nassent to certain conditions of peace by England, with a desire of\r\npressing them on Austria, when no opinion had been expressed by the\r\nGovernment to justify such an inference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: ST JUAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Newcastle to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _26th September 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle presents his humble duty to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will receive from Sir George Lewis full information\r\nof the serious intelligence which has been received to-day from\r\nWashington and Vancouver Island respecting the Military occupation\r\nby United States troops of the island of St Juan,[76] and of the view\r\ntaken of it by your Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle begs leave to receive your Majesty's\r\ninstructions upon the acceptance of an offer made by Lord Clarendon\r\nwhilst on a visit at Clumber last week.

The question of supporting the Emperor of the French, if\r\nAustria should attempt force to impose a government in Italy against\r\nthe popular will, must be judged of according to the circumstances,\r\nshould they arise. Lord John Russell is certainly not prepared to say\r\nthat a case may not arise when the interests of Great Britain might\r\nrequire that she should give material support to the Emperor of the\r\nFrench. But he considers such a case as very improbable, and that\r\nthe fear of such an alliance will prevent Austria from disturbing the\r\npeace of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _2nd December 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was extremely sorry to find from Lord John Russell's letter\r\nof yesterday that he contemplates the possibility of our joining\r\nFrance in a fresh Italian war or demonstration of war against Austria,\r\nwhich the Queen had put entirely out of the question. If the Emperor\r\nof the French were allowed to believe in such a possibility, he would\r\nhave it in his power to bring it about, or obtain a just cause\r\nof complaint against us, if we abandoned him. It would be just as\r\ndangerous and unfair towards the Emperor to mislead him in this\r\nrespect as it would be for the Queen to conceal from Lord John that\r\nunder no pretence will she depart from her position of neutrality\r\nin the Italian quarrel, and inflict upon her country and Europe the\r\ncalamity of war on that account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SIR JAMES HUDSON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _6th December 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter recommending Sir\r\nJames Hudson[78] as the Second Representative at the Congress of\r\nParis. The Queen must decline sanctioning this selection. Lord John\r\nRussell has in his last letters avowed his conviction that England\r\ncannot again remain neutral in an Italian war, and his opinion that\r\nshe ought to support France and Sardinia by arms if Austria were to\r\nattempt to recover her supremacy by force. Lord Cowley wrote on the\r\n29th ult. that Prince Metternich declared that Austria kept her Army\r\nready because she could not permit either the military occupation\r\nof the Duchies by Sardinia or their annexation to that kingdom. Lord\r\nPalmerston sent to the Queen yesterday evening the copy of a letter he\r\nwrote to Count Persigny urging the Emperor Napoleon by every argument\r\nhe can find to consent to this annexation, even to the length of\r\nassuring him that such a state would always be obliged to lean on\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe Queen cannot help drawing her conclusions from these facts, and\r\nfeels more than ever the great responsibility resting on her, to\r\npreserve to her people the blessings of peace. She wishes this letter\r\nto be communicated to Lord Palmerston and to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe Queen approves of Lord Cowley as her First Representative at the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 78: Sir James Hudson, Minister at Turin, had been\r\n    a sympathiser in the policy of Cavour, to an extent almost\r\n    incompatible with his position as a British representative.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CENTRAL ITALY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _7th December 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter of yesterday.\r\nAlthough to avoid a long written discussion, she has not in her last\r\nletter stated any reason for her objecting to Sir James Hudson as\r\nPlenipotentiary at the Congress, she has no objection to state to Lord\r\nJohn that it is simply her want of confidence in him, being the result\r\nof her having watched his conduct at his post at Turin during these\r\nlast years. The Queen's representative at Paris ought to be a person\r\nin whom she can have entire confidence, that _English_ interests alone\r\nwill sway his conduct. From Lord John Russell's letter it appears\r\nthat many of his colleagues in Cabinet saw equal objections to the\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nThe Queen repeats her wish that her letter of yesterday may be\r\ncommunicated to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nLord Cowley's letter, which she returns, is not calculated to\r\ndiminish the Queen's alarm as to the direction in which we are being\r\nsystematically driven, viz. _War_ to support the Emperor Napoleon,\r\nwho almost claims such support already as his right! He has already\r\nshifted his ground further, and asks for it in case Austria should\r\noppose \"the armed interference of Sardinia in the affairs of Central\r\nItaly.\" Now Sardinia can have no more right to such interference than\r\nAustria; yet the Emperor says \"he is quite determined to renew the\r\nwar in case Austria resists.\" It is under these circumstances that the\r\nadvice of the Prime Minister of England to the Emperor, to withdraw\r\nthe only impediment which restrains the action of Sardinia, becomes a\r\nmatter of such grave moment.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is determined to hold to her neutrality in the Italian\r\nintrigues, revolutions, and wars. It is true, Lord John says, \"it\r\nbecomes a great power like Great Britain to preserve the peace of\r\nEurope, by throwing her great weight into the scale which has justice\r\non its side.\" But where justice lies, admits of every variety of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe Party placed in absolute power by a revolution and a foreign\r\ninvasion is not necessarily the exponent of the real wishes of a\r\npeople, and Lord Cowley reports Mr Layard \"hot from Italy to confirm\r\nhim in the opinion he has always held, that the annexation of Tuscany\r\nto Sardinia is not practicable.\" This, however, Lord Palmerston urges,\r\nand if it be agreed to by the Emperor and attempted by Sardinia,\r\nLord John would probably wish England to fight for it as the cause of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nHas Lord John ever contemplated the probability of Austria not being\r\nabandoned a second time by Germany, when attacked by France? The\r\nEmperor is sure to have calculated upon this, and has not played his\r\ngame badly, if he can get the Alliance of England to sanction and\r\nfoster his attack upon the Rhine, which would inevitably follow.\r\nThe Queen believes this to be a cherished object of France, and the\r\nsuccess certain if we become her dupes. The Queen can hardly for a\r\nmoment bring herself to think of the consequences.\r\n\r\nShe would wish this letter also to be shown to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MEETING OF THE CABINET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Granville to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _8th December 1859_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Lord John stated in what appeared to me a very fair way what\r\nhad taken place between himself and Lord Palmerston in their\r\ncommunications with Her Majesty, and read Her Majesty's letters. At\r\nthe end of his statement the Chancellor asked what was the question to\r\nbe decided by the Cabinet. Lord John answered that he wished to know\r\nwhether he was to inform Her Majesty that the Cabinet were of opinion\r\nthat they were still respectfully of opinion that Sir James Hudson was\r\nthe fittest person to be named Second Plenipotentiary, or whether he\r\nshould acquiesce in Her Majesty's commands, reserving his own opinion\r\nas to the fitness of Sir James. The Chancellor answered: \"Undoubtedly\r\nthe second course will be the best.\" I then stated my reasons, or\r\nrather repeated them, for objecting to Sir James Hudson. Mr Gladstone\r\nmade a hesitating remark. Sir G. Lewis and the Duke of Argyll, Sir\r\nCharles Wood, and Sir George Grey--the latter very strongly--supported\r\nthe second course proposed by Lord John. Lord Palmerston spoke with\r\nsome temper and dogmatically as to who were right and who were wrong,\r\nbut advised Lord John to take the second course. The appointment of\r\nLord Wodehouse[79] was proposed. Some of us do not think it a very\r\ngood one, but there are no sufficient grounds for our opposing it.\r\nI am not sure that Gladstone would not go any lengths in supporting\r\nLords Palmerston and John Russell on the Italian Question, although\r\nhe is more cautious than they are. The feeling of the rest of the\r\nCabinet, as far as I can judge, is perfectly sound about war, and on\r\nour taking an English and not a purely Sardinian attitude; but they\r\nare all inclined to sympathise with the national feeling in Italy, and\r\naverse to the restoration of the Dukes by force or by intrigue.\r\n\r\nLord John was sore and nervous, but talked of his letter to the Queen,\r\nand Lord Palmerston's to Persigny, as \"unlucky.\" Lord Palmerston seems\r\nconvinced that he is perfectly in the right, and everybody else in the\r\nwrong, and would, I am sure, take advantage of any step, taken without\r\nsufficient consideration by the Queen, to make a stand for his own\r\npolicy....\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, Sir, with great respect, your Royal\r\nHighness's obedient and faithful Servant,\r\n\r\nGRANVILLE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 79: Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,\r\n    and afterwards, as Earl of Kimberley, a member of successive\r\n    Liberal Cabinets.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DIVORCE CASES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Lord Chancellor_ (_Lord Campbell_).\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _26th December 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes to ask the Lord Chancellor whether no steps can be\r\ntaken to prevent the present publicity of the proceedings before the\r\nnew Divorce Court. These cases, which must necessarily increase when\r\nthe new law becomes more and more known, fill now almost daily a large\r\nportion of the newspapers, and are of so scandalous a character that\r\nit makes it almost impossible for a paper to be trusted in the hands\r\nof a young lady or boy.

In January 1860, he\r\nwas officially appointed a Plenipotentiary, with Lord Cowley, for\r\nthis purpose, and on the 23rd of that month the treaty was signed. It\r\nincluded mutual remissions and reductions of import duties, and was\r\ncontingent on obtaining the assent of the British Parliament, but\r\nneither party was fettered by any engagement not to extend similar\r\nconcessions to other countries. In February, on the introduction of\r\nthe Budget, the treaty was brought before the House of Commons, and\r\nratified by a great majority; at the same time Mr Gladstone abolished\r\na large number of import duties, but increased the income-tax for\r\nincomes over £150, from ninepence to tenpence in the pound. His\r\nproposal to repeal the paper duties was rejected by the Peers, the\r\nmajority in its favour in the Commons having sunk to nine. A Commons\r\nCommittee was appointed to deal with this conflict between the Houses,\r\nand resolutions defining the powers of the Peers in money bills were\r\npassed by the Lower House, Lord Palmerston clearly showing himself in\r\nsympathy with the Lords. Mr Gladstone expressed a desire to resign,\r\nin consequence of his difference with his colleagues, while Lord Derby\r\nand Lord Malmesbury intimated privately that they would support Lord\r\nPalmerston in office against any Radical secession. A Reform Bill of\r\nLord John Russell, reducing the Borough Franchise to £6, and making a\r\nmoderate redistribution of seats, was received with indifference, and\r\neventually dropped.\r\n\r\nItalian affairs mainly absorbed the attention of the country. The\r\nintended international congress was abandoned, owing to the attitude\r\nadopted by the French Emperor towards the Pope, but the former now\r\nobtained the annexation of Savoy and Nice, not, as had been arranged\r\nin 1858 as a reward for assisting to set Italy free \"from the Alps to\r\nthe Adriatic\"--an ideal which had not been realised--but as a price\r\nfor assisting Piedmont to incorporate the Central Italian Provinces.\r\nThe annexation was strongly resented, and suspicions of French designs\r\nwere aroused to such an extent as to give a substantial impetus to the\r\nVolunteer movement in this country. By the summer, 130,000 Volunteers\r\nhad been enrolled, and, at a review in Hyde Park, 21,000 men\r\nmarched past the Queen, while in August, in consequence of the\r\nsame apprehensions, it was decided by a large vote to carry out the\r\nrecommendations of the National Defence Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss made an ineffectual protest against the annexation of that\r\npart of Savoy which had been neutralised by the treaty of Vienna,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the Emperor Napoleon maintained that the\r\npeople of Savoy and Nice had the same right to transfer their country\r\nto France, as Tuscany and the Æmilia (under which name the Duchies\r\nof Parma and Modena and the Romagna were now united) had to place\r\nthemselves under the King of Sardinia. This they decided in March,\r\nby universal suffrage, to do; a few days later the treaty for the\r\nannexation of Savoy and Nice was signed, and in April it was ratified\r\nin the Piedmontese Parliament, Garibaldi, the deputy for Nice, his\r\nnative town, voting against it. In the same month, a _plébiscite_,\r\ntaken in the provinces affected, showed an immense majority in favour\r\nof annexation. Garibaldi himself was soon afterwards engaged in\r\nrendering assistance to the Sicilians in their insurrection against\r\nthe despotic King Francis II. Assuming the title of \"Dictator of\r\nSicily, in the name of Victor Emmanuel,\" Garibaldi attacked and\r\noccupied Palermo, and having established his ascendency in the island,\r\ninvaded the Neapolitan territory on the mainland. The Sardinian\r\nGovernment, for diplomatic reasons, disavowed the expedition, but gave\r\na retrospective assent to it later in the year.\r\n\r\nThe French Emperor's policy in Syria added to the distrust with which\r\nhe was regarded. The Maronites, a Christian tribe, had been attacked\r\nand massacred by the Druses, and the Emperor had proposed to send\r\ntroops to restore order. This step was eventually taken, after a\r\nEuropean conference had been held; but the Emperor's proposal was\r\nso severely criticised that he wrote a long letter to the French\r\nAmbassador in London, reviewing and justifying his policy in Italy and\r\nelsewhere, since the Peace of Villafranca.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi had ignored the instructions of Victor Emmanuel to abstain\r\nfrom further operations against Naples, until the two Sicilies had\r\nvoted for absorption into United Italy; King Francis fled to Gaëta,\r\nand Garibaldi entered the capital. At the same time, Cavour, in spite\r\nof a French protest, determined upon the invasion of the Papal States,\r\nand acted so promptly that in three weeks all effective opposition to\r\nthe Italian cause in that territory was put down, and Umbria and the\r\nMarches were conquered. In October, the Piedmontese Parliament voted\r\nfor the annexation of such of the southern Italian provinces as should\r\ndeclare themselves in favour of it; the Two Sicilies having accepted\r\nthe offer by overwhelming majorities, the King and Garibaldi joined\r\nhands at Teano, and finally defeated the Bourbon army, afterwards\r\nentering Naples. The Marches and Umbria also declared for\r\nincorporation in the new Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn July, the Prince of Wales, accompanied by the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nleft England for a tour in Canada, where he was welcomed with\r\nunbounded enthusiasm; he afterwards proceeded to the United States,\r\nvisiting New York, Chicago, and other great cities, being received\r\nby President Buchanan at Washington. The Prince returned home in the\r\ncourse of November.\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionist troubles, which for some time had been acute in the\r\nStates, came to a crisis in the last days of the year, South Carolina\r\nadopting autonomous ordinances, declaring her own independence and\r\nsovereignty as a State, and her secession from the Union.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Chinese Government to ratify the Treaty of\r\nTien-tsin, and an unwarranted attack on certain British ships, led to\r\na revival of hostilities. A desire being expressed by the Chinese to\r\nresume negotiations, some of the British representatives despatched\r\nfor that purpose were treacherously captured, and treated with great\r\ncruelty. The allied troops of England and France thereupon, marched\r\nto Pekin, when reparation was made, and retribution, exacted for the\r\noutrages. A Convention was eventually signed on the 24th of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _6th January 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I have to thank you for a _most affectionate_\r\nand gracious letter of the 3rd....\r\n\r\nI will speak to my pianist about Wagner's _Lohengrin_; he plays with\r\ngreat taste and feeling, and I purchased a fine Parisian piano to\r\nenable him to go on satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nNow I must speak a little of passing events. Louis Napoleon wished\r\nfor a Congress because it would have placed a new authority between\r\nhimself and the Italians, whom he fears evidently concerning their\r\nfondness of assassinating people. The pamphlet, \"The Pope and the\r\nCongress,\" remains _incomprehensible_[1]; it will do him much harm,\r\nand will deprive him of the confidence of the Catholics who have\r\nbeen in France his most devoted supporters. Now the Congress is then\r\npostponed, but what is to be done with Italy? One notion is, that\r\nthere would be some arrangement by which Piedmont would receive more,\r\nSavoy would go to France, and England would receive Sardinia. I am\r\nsure that England would by no means wish to have Sardinia. It will\r\ngive me great pleasure to hear what Lord Cowley has reported on these\r\nsubjects. I understand that Louis Napoleon is now much occupied with\r\nGermany, and studies its resources. This is somewhat alarming, as he\r\nhad followed, it seems, the same course about Italy. _Gare la bombe_,\r\nthe Prussians may say. One cannot understand why Louis Napoleon is\r\nusing so many odd subterfuges when plain acting would from the month\r\nof September have settled everything. I must say that I found Walewski\r\nat that time very sensible and conservative. His retiring will\r\ngive the impression that things are now to be carried on in a less\r\nconservative way, and people will be much alarmed. I know Thouvenel,\r\nand liked him, but that was in the poor King's time. In England his\r\nnomination will not give much pleasure, I should imagine, as he was in\r\nthe situation to oppose English notions in the Orient.... Your devoted\r\nUncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: This famous pamphlet, issued (like that of\r\n    February 1859, _ante_, 25th January, 1859, note 7) under\r\n    the nominal authorship of M. de la Guéronnière, expounded\r\n    the Emperor'sview that the Pope should be deprived of his\r\n    temporal dominions, Rome excepted. Its publication brought\r\n    about the resignation of Count Walewski (who was succeeded\r\n    by M. de Thouvenel) and the abandonment of the proposed\r\n    Congress.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _11th January 1860_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter, written after the\r\nCabinet yesterday evening. She was much relieved by finding a proposal\r\nto call upon France and Austria not to interfere in Italy substituted\r\nfor the former one implying war on our part for the defence of the\r\nProvisional Governments of Central Italy. The Queen must consider this\r\nnew proposal, however, as partial and incomplete as long as Sardinia\r\nis not asked as well to abstain from interference. Austria has\r\nreversionary rights in Tuscany and Modena, Sardinia has no rights\r\nat all, if a desire for acquisition is not to be considered as one.\r\nAustria will probably say she has no intention of interfering as long\r\nas Sardinia does not, but she cannot allow Sardinia to possess herself\r\nof her inheritance under her very eyes. It is also incorrect to place\r\nFrance and Austria entirely in the same line; Austria being an Italian\r\npower in virtue of Venetia, and France having nothing whatever to do\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: WHIG TRADITIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _11th January 1860_.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he has\r\njust had the honour to receive your Majesty's letter of this date.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell has sent to Lord Palmerston the proposal he humbly\r\nsubmits to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe will therefore only venture to say that the doctrines of the\r\nRevolution of 1688, doctrines which were supported by Mr Fox, Mr Pitt,\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, Lord Castlereagh, Mr Canning, and Lord Grey,\r\ncan hardly be abandoned in these days by your Majesty's present\r\nadvisers. According to those doctrines, all power held by Sovereigns\r\nmay be forfeited by misconduct, and each nation is the judge of its\r\nown internal government.[2]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell can hardly be expected to abjure those opinions, or\r\nto act in opposition to them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: In a despatch of the 27th of October, Lord John\r\n    took the same ground in the case of Naples. After quoting with\r\n    approval the view taken by Vattel of the lawfulness of the\r\n    assistance given by the United Provinces to the Prince of\r\n    Orange, and his conclusion that it is justifiable to assist\r\n    patriots revolting against an oppressor for \"good reasons,\" he\r\n    stated that the question was whether the people of Naples and\r\n    of the Roman States took up arms against their Government\r\n    for good reasons; and of this matter, he added, the people\r\n    themselves were the best judges.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _11th January 1860_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's note of this day, in which\r\nshe is not able to find any answer to her letter, or even an allusion\r\nto what she had written, viz. that Austria and France being asked to\r\nabstain from interference, such an arrangement would be partial and\r\nincomplete unless Sardinia was pledged also to non-interference. The\r\nQueen cannot make out what the doctrines of the Revolution of 1688 can\r\nhave to do with this, or how it would necessitate Lord John to abjure\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AFFAIRS OF ITALY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _17th January 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--Your dear letter of the 13th reached me on\r\nSaturday, and I at once forwarded your letter to good and faithful\r\nClark, who was for _two_ months unable to attend us from a severe\r\nattack of illness, but who is, I am happy to say, much better, indeed\r\nhis own good self again, and who is now _here_.[3] This good account\r\nyou give us of your precious health makes us truly happy.

You will hear no doubt of the last\r\nproposal soon, viz. that France and Austria should _both_ agree _not_\r\nto interfere in Italy--France withdrawing her troops from Rome, and\r\nSardinia to be asked not to send any troops into the Duchies until\r\nthere has been a _final vote_ expressive of their wishes. We could\r\n_not prevent_ this _proposal_, which I doubt being accepted--as the\r\nrest of the Cabinet thought it could _not_ be opposed, and entailed\r\n_no_ material _support_.

The Emperor shows unwillingness to\r\nevacuate Rome and Lombardy, disinclination to admit of the annexation\r\nof the Duchies to Sardinia, a feeling that he could not do so without\r\nappearing dishonourable in the eyes of Austria, and a determination\r\nto rob Sardinia of Savoy in order to repay the French Nation for the\r\nrupture with the Pope, and the abandonment of a protective tariff by\r\nthe reconquest of at least a portion of the \"_frontières naturelles de\r\nla France_.\"[4] Lord Cowley's letter proves clearly that it is (as the\r\nQueen all along felt and often said) most dangerous for us to offer\r\nto bind ourselves to a common action with the Emperor with regard to\r\nItaly, whilst he has entered into a variety of engagements with the\r\ndifferent parties engaged in the dispute, of which we know nothing,\r\nand has objects in view which we can only guess at, and which have not\r\nthe good of Italy in view, but his own aggrandisement to the serious\r\ndetriment of Europe.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Lord John Russell's answer, the Queen will only say\r\nthat our proposal having been made by us after serious reflection and\r\nthe anxious discussion of the Cabinet and the Queen, no deviation from\r\nit ought to take place without affording them ample opportunity to\r\nconsider the bearings and probable results of such alteration.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The cession by King Victor Emmanuel of Savoy\r\n    (the cradle of his race) and of Nice to France was the\r\n    consideration offered at Plombières for obtaining French\r\n    support to the movement for freeing Italy \"from the Alps to\r\n    the Adriatic\"; that result not having been achieved, a like\r\n    price was now offered for French assistance in effecting the\r\n    annexation of the Central Italian provinces.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _22nd January 1860_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord Palmerston's note and enclosures. She\r\nrather expects to be advised by her Ministers as to the course to\r\nbe adopted in matters which may lead to angry debate in the House\r\nof Lords, than to give personal directions on a case so incompletely\r\nplaced before her; Lord Willoughby's letter does not even name the\r\npersons in question nor the grounds upon which he assumes \"they\r\nwould not be received at Court.\"[5] The Queen does not know how far\r\nadmission or non-admission trenches upon the privileges of the House;\r\nfrom the submitted printed regulation, however, she would gather that\r\nthe Lord High Chamberlain has full power to admit or exclude. If\r\nLord Palmerston were to see Lord Granville as Leader, and the Lord\r\nChancellor as Speaker, of the House of Lords together with Lord\r\nWilloughby, they might so far discuss the question as to enable\r\nLord Palmerston to submit a decision for the Queen's consideration\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Lord Willoughby's question had reference to a\r\n    Peeress, who, he thought, would not be received at Court.\r\n    The difference between a State Opening of Parliament and\r\n    a Drawing-room was pointed out in Lord Palmerston's reply.\r\n    Though it would be \"unpleasant to the Peeresses to find\r\n    themselves sitting next to a person with whom they do not\r\n    associate,\" the Premier advised no interference with the lady\r\n    in question, if she persisted in attending.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _31st January 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Accept my warmest thanks for your kind letter of\r\nthe 27th, received on Saturday--by which I am delighted to see what\r\nsport you have had. I have _such_ an aversion for hunting that I am\r\n_quite_ pleased to hear of the destruction of the _fifty-one_ foxes. I\r\nsuppose it was not cold enough for _wolves_.\r\n\r\nI think Parliament has had a wholesome effect upon certain people;\r\nand that they are _altogether frightened_. There has been a strong\r\ndespatch written relative to Savoy--and altogether I think matters are\r\ntaking a better turn.

New Lodge must be exceedingly pretty, and,\r\nGod willing, I ought once to get sight of it. By all one can hear, the\r\nItalians certainly will attack the Austrians, if they are not told to\r\nleave it alone; Victor Emmanuel speaks openly of it, just as he did\r\nlast year, when one also thought it was a mere bravado. Things look\r\nin most directions very gloomy; my neighbour is creating dangers for\r\nhimself by the constitutional Government he gives to Italy. The\r\nFrench say, \"Sommes-nous moins que les Italiens pour avoir un peu de\r\nliberté?\" This may become more dangerous as things move on, not that\r\nI should regret it; we can never have any security as long as France\r\nremains without a constitutional Government. We have had slight\r\nbeginnings of cold, but not much of it, but the glass was fearfully\r\nlow. My ball of the 1st was rather pretty, and people were in great\r\ndancing mood. Princess Orloff, a Troubetzkoï, is a very pleasing young\r\nwoman. There is also a pretty Princess Metchersky. We had some new\r\nEnglish families _inconceivably ugly_; it is quite a calamity,\r\nthey look as if they had been selected on purpose. Having still the\r\nhappiness of being one of your Privy Council, I mean to propose some\r\nmeasure to obviate such a sad state of affairs. We have all of a\r\nsudden snow....

She also thinks that titles should be confined to those\r\nnow known and borne in India, and to be given sparingly; but would\r\nobject to the illimited power of the Governor-General and Viceroy\r\nin this respect. The highest dignities and titles ought to proceed\r\ndirectly from the Crown at the Viceroy's recommendation. The Queen\r\nconcurs in the view that honours cannot well be made hereditary\r\namongst Hindoos and Mussulmans, but where Princes (as we may hope\r\nwill be the case sometimes hereafter) have become Christians, the\r\nhereditary nature of honours should not be withheld.[7] ...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Lord Canning had written that he thought it would\r\n    be best to adhere to the precise titles already in use in\r\n    India, and that they should be at the direct disposal of the\r\n    Queen's Representative, without reference to the Crown. He did\r\n    not recommend that titles should be hereditary (except in\r\n    very special cases), in a country where primogeniture was\r\n    not established. As to the proposed Order of Knighthood, Lord\r\n    Canning thought that the institution of such an Order would\r\n    be both expedient and opportune. He recommended that it should\r\n    include both British-born and Native subjects.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE QUEEN AND HER MINISTERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _10th February 1860_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen sends a letter to Lord Palmerston which she has received\r\nyesterday evening from Lord John Russell.[8] She is induced to do\r\nso from a feeling that it is to Lord Palmerston, as head of the\r\nGovernment, that she has to look, when she may have reason to take\r\nexception to the tone of communications she may receive from members\r\nof his Cabinet. Lord Palmerston will not fail to perceive that the\r\nenclosed is not the kind of communication which the Foreign Secretary\r\nought to make, when asked by his Sovereign to explain the views of the\r\nCabinet upon a question so important and momentous as the annexation\r\nof Savoy to France, and the steps which they propose to take with\r\nregard to it. She need not remind Lord Palmerston that in her letter\r\ncommunicated to the Cabinet she had given no opinion whatever upon\r\nItalian liberation from a foreign yoke, nor need she protest against\r\na covert insinuation, such as is contained in Lord John's letter, that\r\nshe is no well-wisher of mankind and indifferent to its freedom and\r\nhappiness. But she must refer to the constitutional position of her\r\nMinisters towards herself. They are responsible for the advice they\r\ngave her, but they are bound fully, respectfully, and openly to place\r\nbefore her the grounds and reasons upon which their advice may be\r\nfounded, to enable her to judge whether she can give her assent to\r\nthat advice or not. The Government must come to a standstill if\r\nthe Minister meets a demand for explanation with an answer like the\r\nfollowing: \"I was asked by the Cabinet to give an answer, but as I do\r\nnot agree with you, I think it useless to explain my views.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen must demand that respect which is due from a Minister to his\r\nSovereign. As the Queen must consider the enclosed letter as deficient\r\nin it, she thinks Lord John Russell might probably wish to reconsider\r\nit, and asks Lord Palmerston to return it to him with that view.\r\n\r\nThat Lord Palmerston may be acquainted with the course the\r\ncorrespondence has taken, the Queen encloses the two preceding\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: The letter ran:--\"Lord John Russell unfortunately\r\n    does not partake your Majesty's opinions in regard to Italy,\r\n    and he is unwilling to obtrude on your Majesty unnecessary\r\n    statements of his views.... Whatever may be the consequence,\r\n    the liberation of the Italian people from a foreign yoke\r\n    is, in the eyes of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, an\r\n    increase of freedom and happiness at which as well-wishers to\r\n    mankind they cannot but rejoice.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR GLADSTONE'S BUDGET]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n94 PICCADILLY, _10th February 1860_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nbegs to state that Mr Gladstone made this afternoon his financial\r\nstatement.[9] His speech lasted three hours, from five to eight, and\r\nwas admirable, detailed, clear, comprehensive and eloquent; and he did\r\nnot appear to be fatigued by the effort.[10] The statement was well\r\nreceived by the House, and though parts of the arrangement may, and no\r\ndoubt will, be disputed and attacked as the various measures of which\r\nthe arrangement is composed, pass through the House, there seems to\r\nbe a fair probability that the Government will not sustain any serious\r\ndefeat upon any part of the arrangement. The scheme is too extensive\r\nand complicated to admit of an abstract of it being given to your\r\nMajesty in this Report; but no doubt a condensed summary of it will be\r\ngiven in the newspapers of to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: The Budget of 1860 was contemporaneous with\r\n    the commercial treaty with France negotiated by Mr Cobden,\r\n    reducing _inter alia_ the import duties on French wine and\r\n    brandy, and English coal, flax, and pig-iron. Mr Gladstone\r\n    abolished the duties on a large number of imports, and\r\n    proposed to repeal that on paper (regarded not only as a means\r\n    for the diffusion of knowledge, but a commodity in various\r\n    industries).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: This was all the more remarkable, as the Budget\r\n    had been postponed owing to his illness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _11th February 1860_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen acknowledges the receipt of Lord Palmerston's two letters\r\nof yesterday evening. She willingly accepts Lord John Russell's\r\nexpressions of regret, and certainly was led to read that one passage\r\nwhich Lord Palmerston explains in the sense which he supposed.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received the draft to Lord Cowley, and has written her\r\nobservations upon it to Lord John, who will communicate them to him.\r\nShe thinks that the omissions which she has pointed out can be very\r\nwell supplied consistently with that international courtesy which Lord\r\nPalmerston truly says ought to be observed.[11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: In this despatch, Lord John wrote that\r\n    the Government could not believe that a country in the\r\n    circumstances of France could be endangered by the existence,\r\n    \"on the other side of the Alps, of a State of 11,000,000 of\r\n    people lately joined by a cement not yet dry, threatened, on\r\n    the side of Lombardy, by Austria, and not very certain of its\r\n    own independence.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Granville to the Prince Albert._\r\n\r\nBRIGHTON, _11th February 1860_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Lord John produced before the Cabinet his draft of despatch\r\nin answer to M. Thouvenel. He read, without allusion to the previous\r\ncorrespondence, the Queen's Memorandum on his draft.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston supported Lord John, who was fidgety and nervous. We\r\nall criticised the draft. We thought it too much or too little. We\r\nrecommended that he should either write shortly, saying that he\r\ndid not acquiesce in M. Thouvenel's arguments, but as the French\r\nGovernment did not consider the question as now in existence, and\r\npromised that it should not be revised without the consent of Savoy,\r\nand consultation with the Great Powers, if the Government would\r\nreserve what they had to say on a question of such immense European\r\nimportance--or going into the subject he should state the whole\r\nargument and objections of the Government to the scheme.\r\n\r\nWe thought the historical reminiscences offensive to France, while the\r\nlanguage of the despatch was not sufficiently firm to satisfy what was\r\nexpected from the Government. We warned him that in this case public\r\nopinion would be at least as critical as the Queen.\r\n\r\nLord John gave us to understand that he would alter his draft, but\r\nI do not feel any security that it will be done in a satisfactory\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, with the greatest respect, your Royal Highness's obedient,\r\nhumble, and faithful servant,\r\n\r\nGRANVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD COWLEY AND THE EMPEROR]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Cowley to Lord John Russell._\r\n(_Submitted to the Queen._)\r\n\r\nPARIS, _7th March 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD JOHN,--I send a messenger this evening, in order that you\r\nmay not hear from any one else of the passage of arms which took place\r\nbetween the Emperor and myself yesterday evening. You will find the\r\naccount of it in the enclosed despatch. The more I reflect on it, the\r\nless I think that I could pass over the Emperor's conduct and language\r\nwithout notice. His tone and manner were really offensive, and if\r\nI had let them pass unheeded might have been repeated on another\r\noccasion. I must say that nothing could have been more friendly than\r\nHis Majesty's bearing after I had spoken to him. He was profuse in\r\nhis excuses, and the Empress told me later in the evening that he was\r\n_désolé_--\"qu'il s'était laissé entraîner par un mouvement d'humeur,\"\r\netc. I, of course, said that I should think no more about it.\r\n\r\nOne good thing has been gained by it, that the Emperor has declared\r\nthat he does not mean to act in defiance of the opinion of the Great\r\nPowers....\r\n\r\nI wish that I had not this disagreeable history to trouble you with,\r\nbut do not attach greater importance to it than it merits. I look upon\r\nit as at an end.\r\n\r\nCOWLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD COWLEY AND THE EMPEROR]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD COWLEY'S REMONSTRANCE]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR'S _AMENDE_]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Enclosure._]\r\n\r\n_Earl Cowley to Lord John Russell._\r\n(_Submitted to the Queen._)\r\n\r\nPARIS, _7th March 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY LORD,--It is with extreme regret that I call your Lordship's\r\nattention to the following occurrence.\r\n\r\nThere was a concert last night at the Tuileries, to which the Chiefs\r\nof the Diplomatic Body were invited. On these occasions seats are\r\nassigned to the Ambassadors according to their accidental rank, and\r\nI was placed between the Nuntio and the Russian Ambassador. It is\r\ncustomary for the Emperor, during the interval between the two\r\nparts of the concert, to say a few words to each of the Ambassadors\r\nindividually, and it is obvious that what His Majesty says to one may\r\neasily be overheard by that one's immediate neighbours.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening the Emperor, after saying a few words of no\r\nimportance to the Nuntio, addressed himself to me in a manner and\r\ntone very unusual with him, animadverting upon the hostile sentiments\r\nevinced towards him in the English Parliament and Press.[12] \"Wishing\r\nto avoid a discussion, I merely observed that I regretted that matters\r\nshould be in such a state, but that His Majesty must be aware that\r\nthere was quite as great irritation on this side the water. The\r\nEmperor enquired sharply whether this was to be wondered at,\r\nconsidering the terms and imputations applied to himself, and to the\r\nFrench nation, in England? They were only defending themselves against\r\nunfair attacks, His Majesty said. It was really too bad, he continued;\r\nhe had done all in his power to maintain a good understanding with\r\nEngland, but the conduct of England rendered it impossible. What had\r\nEngland to do with Savoy? And why was she not to be satisfied with the\r\ndeclaration that His Majesty had made to me, that he had no intention\r\nto annex Savoy to France without having previously obtained the\r\nconsent of the Great Powers.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Sire,\" I said, \"for interrupting your Majesty, but it\r\nis just what you did not say. Had you permitted me to convey that\r\nassurance to Her Majesty's Government, I will answer for it that all\r\nthose interpellations in Parliament would long since have ceased, and\r\nthat Her Majesty's Government and the country would at all events have\r\nawaited the decision at which the Great Powers might have arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I told you,\" continued the Emperor, \"that I would consult the\r\nGreat Powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sire,\" I replied, \"but your Majesty did not add that you would\r\nabide by their decision.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation had taken place, not only within the hearing of the\r\nRussian Ambassador, but the Emperor's remarks were addressed almost\r\nas much to my colleague as to myself. Turning then entirely towards\r\nGeneral Kisseleff, the Emperor continued: \"The conduct of England is\r\ninexplicable. I have done all in my power to keep on the best terms\r\nwith her; but I am at my wits' end _(je n'en puis plus)._ What,\" His\r\nMajesty exclaimed again, \"has England to do with Savoy? What would\r\nhave been the consequence if, when she took possession of the Island\r\nof Perim[13] for the safety of her Eastern dominions, I had raised the\r\nsame objections that she has now raised to the annexation of Savoy,\r\nwhich I want as much for the safety of France?\"\r\n\r\nHis Majesty continued to speak for a few seconds in the same strain,\r\nand I felt my position to be most awkward. With the remembrance of\r\nHis Majesty's intemperate words to M. de Hübner on New Year's Day,\r\n1859,[14] in my mind, I did not like to leave unnoticed observations\r\nof the tendency I have mentioned. At the same time I had to bear in\r\nmind that I was not present on an official occasion, but that I was\r\nthe Emperor's guest, and that it would not be right to continue a\r\ndiscussion in the presence of others. These thoughts passed rapidly\r\nthrough my mind, and I determined to be guided by a night's reflection\r\nin taking any further step in this matter. What that reflection might\r\nhave produced I cannot say, but circumstances led to more immediate\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\nAs the Emperor moved on, the circle in which we were standing was\r\nnot strictly kept, and after a few minutes I found myself standing a\r\nlittle in front, in the open space round which the circle was formed.\r\nThe Emperor again accosted me, and was beginning in the same strain,\r\nwhen I ventured to interrupt His Majesty and to tell him that I\r\nconsidered myself justified in calling his attention to the unusual\r\ncourse he had adopted, in indulging, in presence of the Russian\r\nAmbassador, in his animadversions on the conduct of England. That His\r\nMajesty, if he had, or thought he had, any cause for remonstrance or\r\nblame with regard to England, should address himself to me, was not\r\nonly natural, but would be a course which I should always beg him to\r\ntake, because free discussion was the best remedy for pent-up feeling.\r\nI should answer as best I could, and endeavour to convince His Majesty\r\nwhen I thought him wrong. Or if His Majesty considered it right to\r\ncomplain of the conduct of England to the Russian Ambassador, I had no\r\ndesire to interfere, provided it was not done in my presence; but what\r\nI could not approve, or consider compatible with my own dignity,\r\nor that of the Government which I represented, was that complaints\r\nrespecting England should be addressed to me in the hearing of the\r\nRussian Ambassador, and to the Russian Ambassador in my hearing.\r\n\r\nLeaving then this official tone, I added that, considering the long\r\nand intimate relations which His Majesty had been graciously pleased\r\nto permit should exist between himself and me, and knowing, as he did,\r\nthe personal attachment which I bore him, and the anxiety which I had\r\never manifested to smooth difficulties and prevent misunderstandings\r\nbetween the two Governments, in doing which I had perhaps exposed\r\nmyself to the suspicion of being more French than I ought to be, I had\r\nnot expected to have been addressed, as I had been, in the presence\r\nof the Russian Ambassador, or to have heard words addressed to that\r\nAmbassador complaining of the sentiments of the English nation.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor frequently interrupted me, expressing his great regret at\r\nwhat had occurred. He could assure me, His Majesty said, that he\r\nhad spoken without any bad intention--that he had just read what had\r\noccurred in Parliament the night before, and that he had been greatly\r\nhurt at the strictures passed upon his conduct; I must recollect\r\nfurther that he had not spoken of the Government, but of those who\r\nattacked him. Again, His Majesty begged me to think no more of the\r\nmatter, repeating the assurance that he had spoken without intention.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this second conversation the Emperor again asked,\r\nbut in a very different tone, why England had taken up the question of\r\nSavoy which so little regarded her. Had it been Prussia or one of the\r\nContinental Powers, His Majesty could have understood it, but not a\r\nword of remonstrance had proceeded from any one of them. I replied\r\nthat I did not think the Emperor could rely on that silence as\r\nindicating approbation, but at all events, I said, the position of Her\r\nMajesty's Government was very different from that of the other powers.\r\nHow was it possible, I asked, for Her Majesty's Government to remain\r\nsilent in presence of the interpellations respecting Savoy which were,\r\nnight after night, put to them? And if His Majesty enquired why these\r\ninterpellations were put, I would answer him that, if my judgment was\r\ncorrect, it was not so much on account of the actual plan of annexing\r\nSavoy, as on account of the circumstances connected with the whole\r\ntransaction. They were, in fact, interpellations of mistrust. And how,\r\nI asked, could it be otherwise? What could the English people think\r\non its transpiring that in spite of His Majesty's declarations,\r\nboth before and during the war, that in going to war he meditated\r\nno special advantages for France, overtures had positively been made\r\nmonths before, to Sardinia, for the eventual cession of Savoy; why had\r\nnot His Majesty told us fairly, in commencing this war, that if, by\r\nthe results of the war, the territory of Sardinia should be greatly\r\naugmented, he might be obliged, in deference to public opinion in\r\nFrance, to ask for some territorial advantage? Such a declaration,\r\nalthough it might have rendered the British Government still more\r\nanxious to prevent the war, would have hindered all the manifestation\r\nof public opinion which is now taking place.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor seemed to feel the weight of these observations, and\r\nhe ended the conversation by saying, that if this question of Savoy\r\nshould go further, he had pledged himself to consult the Great\r\nPowers, and that he need hardly add that if their opinion should be\r\nunfavourable to his wishes, it would have great weight with him.\r\n\"It is not likely,\" said His Majesty, \"that I should act against the\r\nadvice of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nI end, my Lord, as I commenced, in regretting this occurrence. I\r\ncould have wished that the Emperor had not spoken to me a second time\r\nyesterday, and that I had had a little time for reflection. I feel\r\nthat I spoke to His Majesty under considerable emotion, caused by the\r\ntone and manner which he had adopted; but I am certain that not a word\r\nescaped me which was not respectful to himself. To have passed the\r\nmatter over, would, in my judgment, have been a fault, but on the\r\nwhole I should have preferred conveying impressions to His Majesty\r\nthrough M. Thouvenel. I earnestly trust, however, that Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment will view my conduct in a favourable light.\r\n\r\nIt is but justice to my Russian colleague to state that nothing could\r\nhave been in better taste than his remarks in answer to the Emperor's\r\nobservations to him. I have told General Kisseleff this morning that\r\nhaving had an opportunity to do so, I had expressed to the Emperor\r\nthe opinion that it would have been better had His Majesty avoided\r\nirritating topics concerning England in the presence of another\r\nforeign representative.

The object appears to the Queen so\r\nimportant as a means of protection against the temptation of our own\r\nrepresentatives to seize upon the possessions of these Chiefs at any\r\nconvenient opportunity--and as a means of giving confidence to those\r\nChiefs that the Queen's Government is not actuated by rapacity--that\r\nshe must hope Lord Canning will indicate some mode, appearing less\r\nobjectionable to him, for attaining the same object.

We have no choice, and the consideration whether\r\nwhat we are doing may be pleasing or displeasing to France cannot be\r\nentertained for a moment, although the Queen is grieved to find from\r\nLord Cowley's last letter that he considers the question from that\r\npoint of view. We are parties to a treaty of guarantee together with\r\nother Powers, and have as such a clear and solemn _duty_ to perform.\r\nWe should therefore openly and avowedly call upon our partners in\r\nthis treaty and guarantee to consider the note addressed by the Swiss\r\nConfederation to us.\r\n\r\nThe proper course would be to summon the Ministers of the Contracting\r\nPowers to the Foreign Office (not excluding the French Ambassador),\r\nand to go with them into the matter. This would take it out of the\r\nhands of the Emperor and M. de Thouvenel, and make (the Queen is\r\ncertain of it) a deep impression upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wishes this letter to be shown to Lord Palmerston and Lord\r\nJohn's other colleagues.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: The Swiss Government claimed that the districts\r\n    of Chablais and Faucigny (being parts of Savoy which had\r\n    been handed over to Sardinia by the Treaty of Vienna under a\r\n    guarantee for their neutrality) should be given to Switzerland\r\n    for the protection of their frontier. The French Emperor\r\n    maintained that it was sufficient for him to guarantee the\r\n    neutrality of those districts. Speaking on the night of the\r\n    26th, Lord John Russell said: \"The powers of Europe, if they\r\n    wish to maintain peace, must respect each other's limits, and,\r\n    above all, restore and not disturb that commercial confidence\r\n    which is the result of peace, which tends to peace, and which\r\n    ultimately forms the happiness of nations.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _2nd April 1860_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter and Memorandum.[17]\r\nIn whatever Lord John might say in the House of Commons, care should\r\nbe taken not to give the French a handle to make the other Powers\r\nbelieve that there exists an understanding between them and us. It\r\nis by making each of them believe in their turn that the others have\r\nagreed with France that the Emperor paralyses their action. If he will\r\npromise distinctly to give up the neutral territory to Switzerland,\r\nthat would be an understanding which we might well avow, but the Queen\r\nfears Count Persigny with all his anxiety to smooth matters (as he\r\nsays) will not be able to give this assurance, and consequently if\r\nLord John sent the Commons home with a declaration that matters would\r\nbe _satisfactorily_ settled, and the Emperor intends to keep the\r\nneutral territory after all, it would unnecessarily make them dupes\r\nonce more, as the Government have from time to time given assurances\r\nbased on French promises, which were belied by subsequent acts.\r\n\r\nIs the Memorandum for the Queen to keep?\r\n\r\nThe Conference should be here, and on _no_ account at Paris.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Describing a conversation between Lord\r\n    Palmerston and Persigny, the former suggesting that a\r\n    statement should be made by Lord John in the House, in\r\n    reference to the securities to be given for the neutrality\r\n    and independence of Switzerland, such as would pacify the\r\n    Emperor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF PRINCE HOHENLOHE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _25th April 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--I write to you on this paper to-day, as it is our\r\ngood Alice's birthday--her seventeenth!

He gives a\r\ngood account of dear Stockmar too.\r\n\r\nMany, many thanks for your dear kind letter of the 20th, with the\r\nenclosure from dear Charlotte, whose happy, contented disposition is a\r\ngreat blessing.\r\n\r\nI was sure you would grieve for poor, dear, honest Ernest\r\nHohenlohe[19]; Feodore feels it dreadfully, and writes beautifully\r\nabout it. Thank God! she has every comfort in her second son, Hermann,\r\nwho--by an arrangement made last year with the eldest and poor\r\nErnest--has the entire management of everything; Charles has a certain\r\nincome and Weikersheim[20]; while Hermann has Langenburg and the\r\nmanagement of everything else; he naturally leaves the Austrian\r\nService.\r\n\r\nWe are too delighted to hear that you are, D.V., ready to come by the\r\n2nd of June; it will be so great a pleasure, and to dear Mamma\r\ntoo, who is _unberufen_ wonderfully well.

The Queen would be sorry to see a despatch go forth on\r\nthis subject, arguing on the ground of expediency alone.

He is\r\nsorry he cannot agree that there would be any moral wrong in assisting\r\nto overthrow the Government of the King of the Two Sicilies. The\r\nbest writers on International Law consider it a merit to overthrow\r\na tyrannical government, and there have been few governments so\r\ntyrannical as that of Naples. Of course the King of Sardinia has no\r\nright to assist the people of the Two Sicilies unless he was asked by\r\nthem to do so, as the Prince of Orange was asked by the best men in\r\nEngland to overthrow the tyranny of James II.--an attempt which has\r\nreceived the applause of all our great public writers, and is the\r\norigin of our present form of government.[22]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: See _ante_, 11th January, 1860.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _30th April 1860_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter, and trusts he will\r\nsee, upon further reflection, that the case before us is not one in\r\nwhich the Revolution of 1688, and the advent of William III. called\r\nto the Throne, can be appealed to as a parallel. The draft warns the\r\nGovernment of Sardinia \"_not to seek for new acquisitions_,\" as\r\nthe new \"_Provinces_ annexed have hardly as yet been thoroughly\r\namalgamated.\" Now, no public writer nor the International Law will\r\ncall it morally right, that one state should abet revolution in\r\nanother, not with the disinterested object of defending a suffering\r\npeople against tyranny, but in order to extinguish that State and make\r\nit \"an acquisition\" of its own. If William III. had made England a\r\nProvince of Holland, he would not have received the applause Lord John\r\nquotes.

We returned yesterday evening from Aldershot,\r\nwhere we spent two very pleasant days with very warm weather. Sunday\r\nwas a beautiful day and we rode over to Farnham, the Bishop of\r\nWinchester's Palace, and it was quite beautiful, the country is\r\nso green and sweet--and enjoyable. The warm rain of last week has\r\nproduced a burst of Spring which is quite beautiful. Yesterday\r\nmorning it rained when we first went out, but it cleared and became a\r\nbeautiful day, and we had a pretty field day. Your old Regiment\r\nlooked extremely well. In the afternoon we saw some very interesting\r\nrifle-shooting. The whole Army practises this now most unremittingly,\r\nand we saw three different companies of the Guards fire at 300 yards,\r\nand so on to 900 yards, and _hit_ the target! They fired in _volleys_.\r\nIt is very satisfactory, as this precision would be very _telling_ in\r\naction. I think you would be interested by it.\r\n\r\nI _hope_ you have forgiven my hurried note of Saturday--but I was _so_\r\nanxious at the time. We go to Osborne on the 19th, I am happy to say,\r\ntill the 31st.\r\n\r\nAffairs continue to be very threatening, and keep everybody in\r\nsuspense....

The foliage of many trees is hardly out yet, but\r\nthere are all the fruit-trees in fullest blossom--the lilacs and\r\npeonies out--the thorns only beginning and every wild flower\r\nin profusion--the grass splendidly green, and a fragrance about\r\neverything which is too delicious; and the birds singing _most_\r\nbeautifully. The nightingales were last night singing all round the\r\nhouse....\r\n\r\nAffairs are in a most bewildered state. Lord Palmerston is _very stout\r\nand right_ about our neighbour. I am glad to be able to _refute\r\nmost positively_ the report of our _ships_ having _prevented_ the\r\nNeapolitans from firing; the _case_ is _quite_ clear, and the French\r\nand Neapolitan Governments themselves have spread this falsehood.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords have thrown the Bill for the Abolition of the\r\npaper Duties[24] _out_ by a very large majority, which is a _very good\r\nthing_.

The\r\n    majority against it in the House of Lords was 89.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND MONEY BILLS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: COMMITTEE OF THE COMMONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n94 PICCADILLY, _22nd May 1860_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that the Cabinet met to-day at half-past twelve to consider\r\nwhat (if anything) should be done in consequence of the vote of the\r\nHouse of Lords last night. Lord John Russell, Mr Gladstone, and Mr\r\nMilner Gibson were desirous of finding some means of visiting their\r\ndispleasure upon the House of Lords, but it was shown to them that\r\nthe only measures which could be adopted were far too violent for the\r\noccasion, and that the House of Commons itself is powerless in the\r\nmatter. When the Lords do anything inconsistent with the asserted\r\nprivileges of the House of Commons, as, for instance, inserting a\r\ntaxing Clause in a Bill sent up to them, or making an alteration in\r\na Money Bill sent up to them, the House of Commons is necessarily\r\ninvited to do something afterwards in the matter, by assenting to what\r\nhas been done by the Lords; and the Commons then assert their claimed\r\nrights by throwing out the Bill thus, improperly, as the Commons say,\r\nmeddled with by the Lords; but when the Lords throw out a Bill there\r\nis nothing for the Commons to do, as the Bill has vanished, and the\r\nCommons are therefore furnished with no opportunity of asserting the\r\nright which they may claim. But, moreover, the Commons have always\r\ncontended that the Lords cannot originate or alter a Money Bill, but\r\nit has never been contended that the Lords may not reject a Money\r\nBill, though there are few instances of their having done so. These\r\narguments at length prevailed, and by four o'clock it was agreed that\r\nViscount Palmerston should give notice that he would on Thursday move\r\nthat a Committee be appointed to examine the Journals of the House\r\nof Lords to ascertain the fate of the Bill thus lost like Sir John\r\nFranklin, and that on Friday he should move the appointment of a\r\nCommittee to search for precedent applicable to the case. This course\r\nit was thought, while binding the Government to no particular course,\r\nwould in some degree satisfy those who think some step necessary. The\r\nmeasures mentioned, though it is fair to say not actually proposed,\r\nwere that Parliament should be prorogued, and reassembled either in\r\nthe Autumn or Winter, that then the same Bill should be brought\r\nin, and be sent up to the Lords, and that if that Bill were again\r\nrejected, Parliament should be dissolved. It was objected to all this,\r\nthat the case did not warrant such a course; that whether the Lords\r\nhave or have not overstepped their proper functions, the opinion of\r\nthe great majority of the public is that the Lords have done a right\r\nand useful thing (in confirmation of which it may be stated that the\r\npeople in the gallery of the House of Lords are said to have joined\r\nin the cheers which broke out when the numbers of the division were\r\nannounced).\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston, at the meeting of the House, gave notice\r\naccordingly that he should on Thursday move for a Committee to search\r\nthe Lords' Journals--a usual form of motion; and that he should on\r\nFriday move to appoint a Committee to search for precedents in order\r\nto ascertain facts; but he added that he did not take this course with\r\nany view of hostility towards the House of Lords. An attempt was made\r\nby Mr Whalley and Mr Digby Seymour to set up a complaint that this was\r\nnot the sort of proceeding which the gravity of the occasion required,\r\nbut this endeavour was put down by an unmistakable manifestation of a\r\ncontrary opinion by the rest of the House....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Duke of Somerset._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _29th June 1860_.\r\n\r\nBefore sanctioning the proposed change in the Naval Uniform,[25] the\r\nQueen wishes to know what the State occasions are on which the full\r\ndress is to be worn. The officers generally wear an undress without\r\nepaulettes, which in consequence are of little inconvenience to\r\nthem. She has always understood the Service to cling very much to its\r\npresent uniform, and she would be sorry to shock their feelings.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: The principal change proposed was that full\r\n    dress should cease to be obligatory at Courts-Martial.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR GLADSTONE SUGGESTS RESIGNATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, _2nd July 1860_.\r\n(8.30 P.M.)\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston has had the honour of receiving your Majesty's\r\nletter of this afternoon. Nothing of much importance as to Foreign\r\nAffairs was done at the Cabinet to-day.... The material question for\r\ndiscussion was the course to be pursued about the Tax Bill Report.\r\nLord John Russell had altered his opinion since Saturday, and had\r\nyesterday sent Viscount Palmerston a Draft of Resolution which he\r\nwished to be circulated to the members of the Cabinet before their\r\nmeeting at twelve to-day....\r\n\r\nAfter a long discussion, the draft, of which the enclosed is a copy,\r\nwas agreed to by all except Mr Gladstone. This draft is a combination\r\nof parts of Lord John's, parts of Sir James Graham's, and parts of\r\nViscount Palmerston's. No mention of course was made in Cabinet of Sir\r\nJames Graham having made any suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhen all the other members had left the room Mr Gladstone requested\r\nViscount Palmerston to submit to your Majesty that he could no longer\r\ncontinue to carry on the business of his Department.[26] His opinion\r\nstrongly was that action and not a Resolution was required, that\r\none of three courses ought to be pursued: either that the Paper Duty\r\nRepeal Bill should again be sent up to the Lords; or that a Bill\r\nshould be sent up for suspending the Paper Duties for a year; or that\r\na Bill should be sent up reducing those duties gradually year by year;\r\nor fourthly that with the Repeal of the Paper Duties should be coupled\r\nthe imposition of Spirit Duties. Viscount Palmerston said he really\r\ncould not undertake the communication which Mr Gladstone wished to\r\nbe submitted to your Majesty, and earnestly entreated Mr Gladstone to\r\nreconsider the matter; he urged in detail all the reasons which ought\r\nto dissuade such a step, and he thought that he had produced some\r\nimpression on Mr Gladstone. It was agreed between them that Viscount\r\nPalmerston, instead of giving notice this afternoon of a Motion\r\nto-morrow, and laying the Resolution on the table this evening, should\r\ngive notice this afternoon of a Motion for Thursday, and promise to\r\nlay the Resolution on the table to-morrow. This gives Mr Gladstone\r\nmore time to think, and more room to turn round in. Mr Milner Gibson\r\nhas no intention of going out, and has so told Mr Gladstone, strongly\r\nadvising him to stay in; and Viscount Palmerston's impression is\r\nthat Mr Gladstone, having failed to become master of the Cabinet by a\r\nthreat of resignation, will in the end yield to the almost unanimous\r\ndecision of his colleagues. The only person who supported Mr\r\nGladstone's views, except Mr Milner Gibson, was the Duke of\r\nArgyll, who, however, like Mr Gibson, had no intention whatever of\r\naccompanying Mr Gladstone in resignation.[27]...\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: This is said to have been an incident of\r\n    frequent occurrence during the second administration of Lord\r\n    Palmerston.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: The Queen wrote to King Leopold: \"As I told\r\n    you in my little note of Sunday, Lord John became _quite_\r\n    reasonable, and is very moderate about this affair; on the\r\n    other hand Mr Gladstone has threatened to resign--and it is\r\n    still uncertain if he will not persist in his intention.

He attacked Viscount\r\nPalmerston's speech, and highly praised that of Mr Gladstone, who,\r\nhe said, if he lost his place in the Cabinet in consequence of that\r\nspeech would be rewarded by a Throne in the affections of the Nation.\r\nMr Horsman then made a very able, eloquent, and remarkable speech,\r\nwell worth reading....\r\n\r\nMr Bright made an indignation speech in reply. He went over the same\r\nground as the former speaker about the precedents, was astonished and\r\nshocked at Mr Horsman's speech, was displeased with the Resolutions,\r\nand with Viscount Palmerston's speech, was in admiration unbounded of\r\nMr Gladstone, but all the time was so hoarse that his efforts to make\r\nhimself heard gave to his utterance an appearance of passion even\r\ngreater than that which he actually felt. After his speech the House\r\nbegan skirmishing as to the question of finishing the Debate or\r\nadjourning it, but the Resolutions were at last agreed to.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: The Resolutions, which the Committee\r\n    recommended, and the House of Commons adopted, declared _inter\r\n    alia_ that the Commons had in their own hands the power \"so to\r\n    impose and remit taxes, and frame bills of supply, that their\r\n    rights as to the matter, manner, measure, and time might be\r\n    maintained inviolate.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _13th July 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED VICTORIA,--...

It is that _our_ surmises\r\nrespecting Louis of Hesse[31] have turned out to be true, and that\r\nwe have _reason_ to _hope_ that this _affair_ will be in due time\r\nrealised. The feelings are very reciprocal on both sides, though\r\nnothing definitive will be settled till the young people meet again,\r\nprobably later this Autumn (_but not in Germany_).

Such reception and such kind\r\nconsiderate treatment of them is, as Lord Canning knows, entirely\r\nin unison with the Queen's _own_ feelings, and both the Prince and\r\nherself have been peculiarly gratified at reading this account, and\r\nfeel sure of the good effect it must have on these Princes, and on\r\nIndia in general.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen Lord Clyde looking wonderfully well; he speaks in\r\nhigh terms of Lord Canning, and enthusiastically of dear Lady Canning.\r\nAlas! another most valuable public servant and friend of ours, Lord\r\nElphinstone,[32] only returned to die!

We drove\r\noff from here quite early at eight, for twenty-one miles up to the\r\n_Geldie_, a small river--_rode_ from here on ponies across the hills\r\nto Glen Fishie, a beautiful spot, where the old Duchess of Bedford\r\nused to live in a sort of encampment of wooden huts--on to Loch Inch,\r\na beautiful but not wild lake (another twenty miles), crossed the\r\nSpey in a ferry, and posted in very rough vehicles to Grantown, again\r\ntwenty miles, coming in there at nine. We passed close by Kinrara\r\nwhere you used to be, but, unfortunately, not by the house. _No_ one\r\nknew us--anywhere or at the little inn. We went under the names of\r\nLord and Lady Churchill, and Lady Churchill and General Grey who went\r\nwith us, under the names of Miss Spencer and Dr Grey! Two maids\r\n_only_ went with us (whom we had sent round with our things), and\r\n_no_ servants but our two excellent Highlanders, viz. Albert's\r\nfirst stalker or head keeper, and _my own Highland servant_ and\r\nfactotum--_both_ excellent, intelligent, devoted people. _Only_ when\r\nwe had _left_ was it found out. We posted to Tomantoul, a wretched\r\nvillage--fourteen miles, _in four hours!!_ with a pair of wretched\r\ntired horses--over a big hilly road. At Tomantoul we again took our\r\nponies and rode by Avon Side and Glen Avon, also very fine; back to\r\nLoch Bulig--eight miles from here--whence we returned home in our\r\ncarriage. It was a _most delightful_ and enjoyable, as well as\r\n_beautiful_, expedition. I have been besides on many other ones for\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIn Italy I fear the state of affairs is very distressing--but really\r\nthe miserable, weak, and foolish conduct of the King of Naples[36] and\r\nthe squabbles of the whole family takes away all one's sympathy! We\r\nleave here alas! on Saturday, stop till Monday evening at Edinburgh to\r\nsee Mamma, and go on that night straight to Osborne, where we expect\r\nto arrive on Tuesday for breakfast.

Such a meeting\r\nwould undoubtedly be useful to the Emperor of Austria, by reason of\r\nthe good advice which he would receive from your Majesty, and from His\r\nRoyal Highness the Prince Consort; but your Majesty will probably\r\nbe able to find some other way of conveying to the Emperor counsel\r\ncalculated to save him from some of the dangers by which he appears to\r\nbe beset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n_21st September 1860._\r\n\r\nThe Queen received these letters from Lord Palmerston, who likewise\r\ncommunicated to her Lord John Russell's letter, respecting the hint\r\nthrown out by Count Rechberg[37] of a meeting with the Emperor of\r\nAustria. The Queen agrees with Lord Palmerston, that while such an\r\ninterview might for many reasons have been desirable, under present\r\ncircumstances it might lead to much talk and to many rumours which\r\nmight do harm, or at any rate give rise to useless conjectures. It\r\nwould therefore be better to \"nip this project in the bud\" as Lord\r\nJohn suggests, but care should be taken to do this in such a manner as\r\nnot to let it appear that there was any disinclination on the Queen's\r\npart to meet the Emperor of Austria.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: In a letter to Mr Julian Fane, Count Rechberg,\r\n    the Austrian Foreign Minister, had said that he had desired to\r\n    bring about an interview between the Queen and the Emperor of\r\n    Austria, but that there would have been difficulties in the\r\n    way.

J'étais, et je suis seul à lutter contre\r\ntoutes les forces de la révolution Européenne. Cette révolution s'est\r\nprésentée avec un pouvoir que jamais on ne lui avait connu, armes,\r\nparcs d'artillerie, munitions, vaisseaux, rien ne lui a manqué, pas\r\nmême les ports d'une puissance pour se recruter, et son drapeau pour\r\nla couvrir.\r\n\r\nCes événements établissent un nouveau droit public, fondé sur la\r\ndestruction des anciens traités et des principes reconnus du droit\r\ndes gens.

Bertie's visit seems to have gone off most\r\nsplendidly; its effects will be useful. The enemies of England always\r\nflatter themselves that mischief may come from that part of the world.\r\nTo see, therefore, friendly feelings arise, instead of war, will\r\ndisappoint them much. Alfred's appearance at the Cape[38] has also\r\nbeen a most wise measure. South Africa has a great future to expect,\r\nit is a pity it is so far and I too old to go there; the plants alone\r\nare already a great temptation. I should like very much to hear what\r\ncame to your knowledge of the Warsaw meeting.[39] Prince Gortschakoff\r\ntried hard to make it believe that it would bring _Russia nearer to\r\nFrance_. If this was to be the result of the meeting it would be a\r\nvery sad one indeed....\r\n\r\nThe way in which the English Press misunderstands all these things is\r\nquite lamentable. The meeting of the Sovereigns had this time a better\r\nobject than the oppression of the liberties of Nations; that this\r\nshould not be seen by people who would be the first sufferers of\r\nthe supremacy of a certain power is very lamentable, but they see\r\neverything only according to the colour of _their_ spectacles. _Le\r\nFlibustive_ movement at Naples is very shameful, but that poor King\r\nhas been so calumniated that Garibaldi is the rage of the present\r\nmoment; Colonel Walker[40] has been shot, and Garibaldi, who comes out\r\nof that self-same school, is divinised. But it is time I should end.\r\nWith my best love to dear Albert, I remain ever, my beloved Victoria,\r\nyour devoted old Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: Prince Alfred, who, some time before, had been\r\n    appointed to the _Euryalus_, in the course of the summer\r\n    visited South Africa.

In a letter written by the Prince\r\n    Consort a few weeks earlier to Baron Stockmar, he remarks upon\r\n    the noteworthy coincidence that almost in the same week in\r\n    which the elder brother would open the great bridge across the\r\n    St Lawrence, the younger would lay the foundation stone of the\r\n    breakwater for the Cape Town Harbour. \"What a cheering picture\r\n    is here,\" he wrote, \"of the progress and expansion of the\r\n    British race, and of the useful co-operation of the Royal\r\n    Family in the civilisation which England has developed and\r\n    advanced\" (_Life of the Prince Consort_, vol. v. p. 88).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: The Emperors of Russia and Austria, and the\r\n    Prince Regent of Prussia met at Warsaw on 20th October, and\r\n    held a conference which extended over several days.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: Walker, in the course of one of the Nicaraguan\r\n    revolutions, had seized the supreme power, and had been\r\n    recognised as President by the U.S. Government; he was\r\n    afterwards expelled, and, on venturing to return, was\r\n    arrested, and shot on the 25th of September 1860.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _3rd November 1860._\r\n\r\nThe Queen returns the enclosed draft,[41] which she is afraid is not\r\nlikely to produce the beneficial results which Lord John seems to\r\nanticipate.\r\n\r\nThe expression of our hope, that Rome and Venetia, from their Italian\r\nnationality, will soon share in the freedom and good government of\r\nthe rest of Italy, can only be understood as a declaration on our part\r\nthat we wish to see them share the annexation to Sardinia, after that\r\nof the Two Sicilies shall have been completed.\r\n\r\nThe declaration at the end after the quotations of the former\r\nprotests, vague as it is, viz. \"That if other Powers interfere England\r\nwould do as she pleases,\" means either nothing at all (for England\r\nis free to do as she pleases) or it means a threat of war, either\r\nan empty threat, or one intended to be followed up when the occasion\r\narises. The first would hardly be dignified for a great Power like\r\nEngland, and as to the second, the Queen for one is not prepared to\r\ndecide to go to war to ensure the success of the Italian Revolution.\r\n\r\nBut is such a declaration at the present moment called for by anything\r\nthat has happened? Another despatch has accepted as satisfactory the\r\nFrench explanation about the order given to the fleet before Gaëta,\r\nand Austria has renewed her assurances that she will not interfere;\r\nthe only Power likely to continue to interfere and to produce\r\nwar--Sardinia--is held to have an exceptional right to it, as an\r\n\"Italian\" Power.\r\n\r\nThe Queen thinks this important despatch should not be laid before\r\nher again without its having received the deliberate consideration\r\nand assent of the whole Cabinet, and in case Lord John should bring it\r\nbefore them the Queen would wish him to communicate this letter also\r\nto them, as embodying her views on the subject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: This draft despatch, prepared in order to be\r\n    sent to all the Powers, expressed approval of the Italian\r\n    Revolution. It concluded: \"Her Majesty's Government deem\r\n    it right to declare that if any other Power should attempt\r\n    forcible interference, Her Majesty's Government will hold\r\n    themselves free to act in such a manner as the rights of\r\n    nations, the independence of Italy, and the interests of\r\n    Europe may seem to them to require.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE LODGE, _3rd November 1860._\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty....\r\n\r\nWith regard to the position of Great Britain, Lord John Russell\r\nis bound to advise that it shall not suffer by the change of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nFrom 1815 to 1859 Austria ruled Italy. If Italians had reason to\r\ncomplain, England had nothing to fear from the use of Austrian\r\ninfluence against British interests.\r\n\r\nBut if France were to sway the united Navies of Genoa and Naples, and\r\nGreat Britain to look on from fear or apathy, or excessive love of\r\npeace, she might soon have to defend her possessions of Malta, Corfu,\r\nand Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nAustria would hardly attempt any new aggression on Italy, unless she\r\nwere assisted by France.\r\n\r\nItaly as one Power would derive strength from the declaration of Great\r\nBritain, as a disinterested friend.\r\n\r\nA letter of Lord Cowley will show your Majesty the suspicions and\r\ndoubts which exist as to French policy in Italy.[42] All these\r\nprojects will be scattered to the winds by the word of the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: Lord Cowley wrote that he had heard through\r\n    Count Metternich that the Emperor of the French would never\r\n    consent to the annexation of Naples to Piedmont, that he\r\n    wished the Pope to retain Umbria and the Marches, and that the\r\n    Romagna should be an independent State.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: REPLY TO KING OF NAPLES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of Naples._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _3rd November 1860._\r\n\r\nSIR, MY BROTHER,--The letter I have received from your Majesty, dated\r\nfrom Gaëta on the 6th of October, is altogether devoted to political\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have for a long time occupied the thoughts of\r\nmy confidential advisers, and I have directed them to convey to my\r\nMinisters abroad such instructions as occasion appeared to me to\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nI will therefore confine this letter to those topics which are not the\r\nimmediate subjects of political controversy.\r\n\r\nUpon your Majesty's accession to the Throne I lost no time in assuring\r\nyour Majesty of my sincere wishes for the prosperity of your reign,\r\nand the permanence of your dynasty.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I was fully aware of the difficulties of the period\r\nat which your Majesty succeeded to the Crown.

He is really such a dear, gifted, handsome\r\nchild, that it makes one doubly anxious he should have as few failings\r\nas mortal men can have. Our poor Bertie is still on the Atlantic,\r\ndetained by very contrary winds, which those large vessels with only\r\nan auxiliary screw and only eight days' coal cannot make any way\r\nagainst. Two powerful steamers have now gone out to look for him and\r\nbring him in....\r\n\r\nWith Albert's affectionate love, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: Major (afterwards Sir John) Cowell was appointed\r\n    as Tutor to Prince Alfred in 1856.

It would be an ungracious proceeding to\r\nleave the services of Mr Cobden with no other acknowledgment than\r\nthe praises contained in a Foreign Office despatch, and Viscount\r\nPalmerston therefore with the concurrence of Lord John Russell would\r\nbeg to submit for the gracious approval of your Majesty that Mr Cobden\r\nmight be offered his choice of being created a Knight Grand Cross\r\nof the Civil Order of the Bath, or of being made a Member of your\r\nMajesty's Privy Council.\r\n\r\n(_Note, in Queen's hand._--Was agreed to offer him either to be made a\r\nP.C., or a Baronet.)[44]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: Mr Cobden declined both the Honours.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nLAEKEN, _22nd November 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED VICTORIA,--I have to thank you for a most kind letter\r\nof the 20th. I hope you will see the young and very nice Empress of\r\nAustria,[45] perhaps you made a little excursion to Plymouth. I had,\r\nand have still, some cold, and therefore I was apprehensive of waiting\r\nat the station on the 20th in the evening; I sent Marie and Philip\r\nto receive the Empress. Yesterday before daybreak I went myself to\r\nAntwerp. I first paid the Empress a visit, and then I took her to your\r\nbeautiful ship. She was much struck with it, and it was _very kind_\r\nof you, and indeed, for an invalid, invaluable. It will show,\r\nbesides, that even beyond Garibaldi, and that amiable, disinterested\r\n_Annex_ander, you can feel some interest. I saw the Empress already\r\ndressed for her departure, but I think there is something very\r\npeculiar about her, which is very pleasing. Poor soul, to see her go\r\naway under, I fear, not very safe circumstances, as she coughs a great\r\ndeal, quite grieves one; though it certainly increased my stupid cold,\r\nstill I should have been sorry not to have assisted at her going to\r\nsea. It was a beautiful day, but this night it has begun to blow from\r\nthe West-south-west, which I fear will create a sea to the Westward.\r\n\r\nThat you had your sons about you must have been a great satisfaction\r\nto you. Bertie got well through his truly tremendous tour. I think\r\nthat the effect on the Americans will last for some time. That the\r\npoor Duke of Newcastle got home without accident is surprising. Affy\r\nhas something most winning, and is a dear little rogue. Eugénie's\r\nexpedition[46] is most astonishing. She also coughs much, and I never\r\nheard Scotland recommended for Winter excursions. I believe that the\r\ndeath of her sister affected her a good deal. She seems to have been a\r\ngood deal _choquée_ that she had been dancing in Africa when that poor\r\nsister was dying. Next to this, there seems a difference of opinion\r\nwith her master on the subject of the Pope. You will recollect that\r\nat the time of his elections the clergy rendered him undoubted good\r\nservice; I even doubt that he would have been elected without their\r\naid. Now he puts the axe to the root of the whole Catholic Church\r\nby destroying the Pope, and he does this _without the slightest\r\nprovocation_, and for the benefit of the revolution _et des\r\nrévolutionnaires_....\r\n\r\nI remain ever, my beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: The Empress Elizabeth was on her way to Madeira,\r\n    in a ship placed at her disposal by the Queen.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: The Empress of the French was making a tour in\r\n    England and Scotland for the benefit of her health; she\r\n    had sustained a bereavement by the death of her sister, the\r\n    Duchess of Alba.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: BETROTHAL OF PRINCESS ALICE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _1st December 1860_.\r\n\r\nDEAREST UNCLE,--I hasten to announce to you that yesterday our dear\r\nyoung couple here were engaged, and that we _are all_ very happy.[47]\r\nLouis was spoken to yesterday on our return from Aldershot by\r\nAlbert,--who told him he would have an opportunity of speaking to\r\nAlice--and this opportunity he took last night after dinner when\r\nhe was standing alone with her at the fire, and every one else was\r\noccupied in talking. They whispered it to me, and then, after we left\r\nthe drawing-room, we sent for good Louis--and the young people met and\r\nconfirmed in a very touching manner _what_ they had merely been able\r\nto whisper to one another before. He was very much overcome. He is\r\na dear, good, amiable, high-principled young man--who I am sure will\r\nmake our dearest Alice _very_ happy, and she will, I am sure, be a\r\nmost devoted loving wife to him. She is _very, very_ happy, and it is\r\na pleasure to see their young, happy faces beaming with love for\r\none another. Alice is so extremely reasonable and quiet. She wishes\r\neverything kind and affectionate to be said to you, and _hopes_ for\r\nyour _blessing!_ I am very, very happy, so are we both, but I am still\r\na good deal agitated and flurried by the whole event.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday the Empress arrives, but only to luncheon.

Lord Palmerston may now have an\r\nopportunity of selecting a stronger man of Liberal views from\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: Bishop Henry Pepys had died in November, and was\r\n    succeeded in the following January by Canon Henry Philpott of\r\n    Norwich, Master of St Catharine's College, Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: Probably the Rev.

For\r\nthese purposes it is desirable that a bishop should have practical\r\nknowledge of parochial functions, and should not be of an overbearing\r\nand intolerant temperament. His diocesan duties are enough to occupy\r\nall his time, and the less he engages in theological disputes the\r\nbetter. Much mischief has been done by theological bishops, and if the\r\nBench were filled with men like the Bishops of Oxford and Exeter there\r\nwould be no religious peace in the land. Nor have men chosen merely\r\nfor their learning succeeded better; Thirlwall, Bishop of St David's,\r\nand Blomfield, the late Bishop of London, were chosen on account of\r\ntheir learning; the former is acknowledged to be inefficient, the\r\nlatter greatly mismanaged his diocese. The theological learning of\r\nthe Bishop of Exeter[50] has caused much mischief to the Established\r\nChurch. Viscount Palmerston would also beg to submit that the\r\nintolerant maxims of the High Church bishops have exasperated the\r\nDissenters who form a large portion of the nation, and have given\r\noffence to many good Churchmen. The Bishop of Exeter, the late Bishop\r\nof Carlisle,[51] and the late Bishop of Rochester,[52] the two latter\r\nindividuals kind-hearted and good-natured men, refused to consecrate\r\nburial grounds unless a wall of separation divided the portion\r\nallotted to Churchmen from the portion allotted to Dissenters--a\r\ndemand which gave offence to both communities. Viscount Palmerston\r\nwould beg to submit that several of the bishops whom he has had the\r\nhonour of recommending to your Majesty had distinguished themselves by\r\ntheir classical and academical attainments, and he may mention in this\r\nrespect the names of Baring, Longley, Tait, Wigram, and Waldegrave.\r\nViscount Palmerston can assure your Majesty that although his\r\nselection of bishops has been much found fault with by the High\r\nChurch, Puseyite, and semi-Catholic Party, they have given great\r\nsatisfaction to the nation at large, and Viscount Palmerston has\r\nreceived communications to that effect, verbal and written, from\r\npersons of all classes, and political parties in all parts of the\r\ncountry. The people of this country are essentially Protestant, they\r\nfeel the deepest aversion to Catholicism, and they see that the High\r\nChurch, Tractarian, and Puseyite doctrines lead men to the Church of\r\nRome. The disgraceful scenes last year at St George's in the East[53]\r\nwere only an exaggerated outburst of a very general and deeply-rooted\r\nfeeling. Viscount Palmerston believes that the clergy of the\r\nEstablished Church were never more exemplary in the performance of\r\ntheir duties, more respected by the Laity and, generally speaking, on\r\nbetter terms with the Nonconformist body than at the present time.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: Henry Phillpotts, who was Bishop from 1830 to\r\n    1869.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 51: The Hon.

I trust that you have received both mine now. We expect the\r\nEmpress at half-past one, and I will certainly give her your message.\r\nShe is very amiable, and one must like her. There seems to be no\r\ndoubt that there were many scenes, partly about the Pope, and also on\r\naccount of her sister's funeral; she was so angry with Fould about it\r\nthat she insisted on his dismissal.[54] Then the Priests are said to\r\ntry and work upon her, and say that her son will die if the Emperor\r\ncontinues _dans cette voie_ against the Pope.\r\n\r\nWe saw Mr Elliot[55] from Naples yesterday, who has always been very\r\nfair. He says that _if_, when the King came to the Throne, he had\r\n_only_ insisted on the laws of the country being properly carried\r\nout, _no_ reforms or change in the Constitution would have been\r\nnecessary--but from the want of energy, and also no strength of\r\nintellect and great indecision of character of the poor King, as well\r\nas an unfortunate _Pietät_ for the memory of his father, nothing right\r\nwas done; bad counsellors surrounded him, the Queen Mother had a bad\r\ninfluence, and finally everything was given up as lost--when it might\r\nyet have been prevented. They dislike extremely being annexed, but\r\nprefer it to having back the former state of things.\r\n\r\nWe have since ten or twelve days almost incessant rain, so that we\r\nshall soon be on an island. This is the more distressing as we can't\r\ngo to Osborne at present--there being a sort of epidemic fever which\r\nthe doctors declare is in the air and that it would be running too\r\ngreat a risk if we went. But we have perpetual sunshine in the house\r\nwhen we look at our dear young lovers, who are _so_ happy, so devoted\r\nto each other, that it does one good to see it; he is so modest and\r\nunassuming that we feel as if he was one of our own children; and he\r\nis _so_ good and amiable, has such an open honest character, such\r\na warm heart, such high principles, and is withal so merry and\r\n_aufgeweckt_ that I feel we have _gained_ a son and shall _not_ lose a\r\ndaughter--for we shall be able to have them a good deal with us, Louis\r\nnot having any duties to detain him much at home at present. I can't\r\nsay what happiness and comfort it is to me. I feel my dear child\r\nwill first of all have a peaceful, quiet, happy home, without\r\ndifficulties--and secondly, that she will not be entirely cut off from\r\nus and monopolised as our poor Vicky is.\r\n\r\nI add a few lines since we have seen the Empress. She came at\r\nhalf-past one, and stayed till a little after three. She looked very\r\npretty, but very sad--and in speaking of her health and of her return\r\nfrom Algiers began to cry. She seems to be much better, however, for\r\nher journey; before she could neither eat nor sleep, nor would she\r\ntake notice of anything. She never mentioned the Emperor but once when\r\nshe offered his compliments, and there was not the slightest allusion\r\nto politics. It is altogether very strange. She remains another week\r\nin England, and then goes back as she came. I gave her your message,\r\nand she enquired after you. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: See _ante_, 15th May, 1859, note 38.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: See _ante_, 17th July, 1859, note 62.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: VISIT OF THE EMPRESS EUGENIE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\n_Windsor Castle, 11th December 1860_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--I have to thank you for two _most_ kind letters\r\nof the 4th and 7th. Your kind interest in our dear child's\r\nhappiness--your approval of this marriage of our dear Alice, which,\r\nI cannot deny, has been for _long_ an ardent wish of mine, and just\r\ntherefore I feared _so_ much it _never_ would come to pass, gives\r\nus the greatest pleasure. _Now_--that _all_ has been so _happily_\r\nsettled, and that I find the young man so very charming--my joy, and\r\nmy _deep_ gratitude to God are very great! He is so loveable, so\r\nvery _young_, and like one of our own children--not the _least in\r\nthe way_--but a dear, pleasant, _bright_ companion, full of fun and\r\nspirits, and I am _sure_ will be a _great_ comfort to us, besides\r\nbeing an excellent husband to our dear, good Alice, who, though\r\nradiant with joy and much in love (which well she may be), is as quiet\r\nand sensible as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Empress is still here, and enjoys her liberty of _all_ things. We\r\nwent to town for the Smithfield Cattle Show yesterday, and visited her\r\nat Claridge's Hotel. She very civilly wanted us to avoid the trouble,\r\nbut we felt that it would not be civil if we did not, and that\r\nhereafter even the French might say that she had not been treated with\r\ndue respect. She looked very pretty, and was in very good spirits, but\r\nagain carefully avoided any allusion to her husband and to politics,\r\nthough she talked a great deal about all she was seeing!...\r\n\r\nI must now wish you good-bye. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nTO CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1861--a year destined to close in sorrow and\r\ndesolation--Queen Victoria experienced a heavy grief in the death of\r\nher mother, the Duchess of Kent, at the age of seventy-four.\r\n\r\nIn January, fresh overtures were made to Lord Palmerston by the\r\nConservative leaders, with a view of supporting him in office against\r\nthe dissentients in his Ministry, especially Lord John Russell and Mr\r\nGladstone, whose views on the questions of Reform and National Defence\r\nrespectively were opposed to those of the Premier. Lord Palmerston was\r\nindifferent to the support of Mr Gladstone; but a unity of view on\r\nthe Italian policy of the Government held the three Liberal statesmen\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe attack on the Paper Duties was repeated by Mr Gladstone, who, on\r\nthis occasion, combined all his fiscal proposals in a single Bill. The\r\nmeasure, after strong opposition, passed the Commons by a majority of\r\nfifteen, and the Peers subsequently accepted the Budget, which took a\r\npenny off the income tax, while maintaining the existing tea and sugar\r\nDuties. In July, Lord John Russell, who had entered Parliament in\r\n1813, before he came of age and had been leader of the House of\r\nCommons at the time of the Queen's accession, was transferred to the\r\nHouse of Lords. In August, the Queen and the Prince Consort, with the\r\nPrince of Wales and Prince Alfred, paid a third visit to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Italy still continued to attract public attention.\r\nAt the end of 1860, the French fleet had been despatched to Gaëta\r\nto protect the interests of King Francis; this protection, given\r\nin violation of the principle of non-intervention, was withdrawn in\r\nJanuary, and the garrison surrendered to the Piedmontese Admiral. On\r\nthe 18th of February, the new Parliament of Italy met at Turin, the\r\ndebates emphasising the vital necessity of including both Rome and\r\nVenetia in a united nation; Victor Emmanuel was declared King of\r\nItaly, a title promptly recognised by Great Britain; but in June, to\r\nthe profound grief of the Italian nation, Cavour, its Prime Minister,\r\nand the mainspring of the Piedmontese policy, died while still in the\r\nprime of life.\r\n\r\nKing Frederick William of Prussia had died in January, and was\r\nsucceeded by his brother, William I., Prince of Prussia, who was\r\ncrowned with Queen Augusta, at Königsberg, on the 18th of October,\r\nLord Clarendon attending as British representative. In the following\r\nmonth, King Pedro of Portugal, son and successor of Donna Maria, and\r\nhis brother Ferdinand, died of typhoid fever; another brother, Prince\r\nJohn, succumbed to the same malady before the close of the year.\r\n\r\nEvents of great importance took place in North America, where the\r\nsecession of South Carolina was followed by that of other Southern\r\nStates. The delegates of the latter assembled in February at\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, and nominated Jefferson Davis as their President,\r\nAbraham Lincoln having been previously elected as the new President\r\nof the United States. The first shot had been fired, on the 9th of\r\nJanuary, in Charleston Harbour, where a Secessionist battery opened\r\nits guns on a vessel sent by the Federal Government to reinforce Fort\r\nSumter. In April, the Confederate troops attacked the Fort, which\r\nwas compelled to surrender, whereupon President Lincoln issued a\r\nproclamation calling for 75,000 volunteers; President Davis replied\r\nby issuing (in default of an official fleet) letters of marque to\r\nprivately owned vessels, and Lincoln declared the Southern ports in\r\na state of blockade. In May, Lord John Russell announced that the\r\nBritish Government would recognise the South as a belligerent power,\r\nand a proclamation of neutrality was issued. At Bull Run, on the\r\n21st of July, the Federals were defeated, and fled in confusion to\r\nWashington. Hostilities continued during the year, and Great Britain\r\nwas nearly involved in war, by the seizure, on the 8th of November, by\r\nthe captain of a Federal vessel, the _San Jacinto_, of Messrs Slidell\r\nand Mason, the envoys accredited by the Confederate States to Great\r\nBritain and France. This high-handed action was taken while the envoys\r\nin question were passengers to Europe, by the British mail steamer\r\n_Trent_, between Havana and St Thomas, and the public mind of Great\r\nBritain was greatly excited in consequence; but eventually the envoys\r\nwere transferred to a British ship-of-war, and arrived in Great\r\nBritain, not, however, until in view of a threatened aggression on\r\nBritish North America, troops had been despatched from England to\r\nstrengthen the Canadian garrisons on the frontier. The despatch\r\nof Lord Russell to the American Government, which led to a pacific\r\nresult, had been revised by Prince Albert, in the direction of leaving\r\nopen to that Government an honourable retreat from the aggressive\r\nattitude they had taken up; the Prince's action in this respect, the\r\nbeneficial effect of which it would be difficult to exaggerate,\r\nwas destined to be the last of a long series of political services\r\nrendered to this country.\r\n\r\nIt had become apparent in the autumn that Prince Albert's normal\r\nhealth was impaired, and in November he began to suffer from\r\npersistent insomnia; towards the end of the month the fever originated\r\nwhich was to prove fatal to him. He suffered at first from rheumatic\r\npains and constant weakness, until, early in December, what was\r\nthought to be influenza developed, and the Prince was confined to\r\nhis room. By the 11th his condition, though not hopeless, had become\r\ngrave, and the serious nature of the illness was made public; and,\r\nalthough on the 12th the Queen could write hopefully to King Leopold,\r\nthe malady continued to increase. On the evening of the 13th, a rally\r\ntook place, and encouraging reports were brought hourly to the Queen\r\nthrough the night; but congestion of the lungs supervened on the\r\nfollowing day, in the closing hours of which, to the inexpressible\r\ngrief both of the Queen and her subjects, the Prince passed peacefully\r\naway. The letters of the Queen to King Leopold and Lord Canning\r\nexpress, in language to which nothing can be added, the intensity of\r\nher grief, and, no less, the noble and unselfish courage with which\r\nshe resolved to devote her life to her children and country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CONSERVATIVE OVERTURES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBROADLANDS, _1st January 1861_.\r\n\r\nVISCOUNT PALMERSTON presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto be allowed to wish your Majesty and His Royal Highness the Prince\r\nConsort many prosperous returns of New Year's Day, with increasing\r\nhappiness to your Majesty and the Royal Family, and progressive\r\nadvantage to the Nation who have the good fortune to have your Majesty\r\nfor their Sovereign; and to adopt the language of Pope, he would say,\r\n\r\n  \"May day improve on day, and year on year,\r\n  Without a pain, a trouble, or a fear.\"\r\n\r\nThis Autumn and Winter, however, have been productive of events in\r\nthree of the four quarters of the Globe, which future years are not\r\nlikely to repeat. The capture of Pekin in Asia by British and French\r\ntroops; the Union in Europe of nearly the whole of Italy into one\r\nMonarchy; and the approaching and virtually accomplished Dissolution\r\nin America of the great Northern Confederation, are events full\r\nof importance for the future, as well as being remarkable in time\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston submits two letters which your Majesty may feel an\r\ninterest in seeing. With regard to that from Lord John Russell stating\r\na half-formed wish to go to the House of Lords, Viscount Palmerston\r\ndoes not expect that the desire will be repeated when the Session\r\nbegins, although Lord John said last year that he felt attendance in\r\nthe House of Commons in addition to the labour of his office, more\r\nthan he could well get through. He would be a loss to Viscount\r\nPalmerston in the House of Commons, especially after the removal of Mr\r\nSidney Herbert to the House of Lords;[1] and speaking confidentially\r\nto your Majesty with regard to the future, Viscount Palmerston would\r\nthink himself doing better service by recommending the House of Lords\r\nfor Mr Gladstone, than for Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\nMr Herbert will take the title of Lord Herbert of Lea, the title of\r\nHerbert being that borne by his elder brother during the life of the\r\nlate Lord Pembroke.\r\n\r\nThe other letter from Lord Malmesbury relates to a communication\r\nwhich he made to Viscount Palmerston last year from Lord Derby and Mr\r\nDisraeli at the beginning of the Session, to the effect that, if\r\nthe Government were then to break up from internal dissensions, the\r\nConservative Party would support during the then ensuing Session any\r\nadministration which Viscount Palmerston might be able provisionally\r\nto make, to carry through the business of the Session.[2] Viscount\r\nPalmerston is not aware of any circumstances which can have led to the\r\nexpectation that the present administration is likely to be broken up\r\nby internal divisions in the course of this next Session. There are\r\nno questions ahead so likely to produce discord as the Reform Bill of\r\nlast year, and the differences between the two Houses about the Paper\r\nDuties, about which it was very difficult to prevent Lord John and Mr\r\nGladstone from flying off, or the Fortification Question, upon which\r\nMr Gladstone announced to his colleagues, nearly a dozen times, that\r\nhe was firmly resolved to resign. Viscount Palmerston has asked Lord\r\nMalmesbury to come over to him to Broadlands at any time before the\r\n21st or 22nd of this month, which is the probable time at which the\r\nCabinet will have to meet in London.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston finds he has not got Lord John Russell's letter\r\nat hand, but the only thing of any interest in it was the intimation\r\nwhich Viscount Palmerston quoted.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Mr Herbert had been latterly in bad health, and\r\n    resigned office in the summer. He died on the 2nd of August.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: In his memoirs, Lord Malmesbury describes an\r\n    interview with Lord and Lady Palmerston on the 1st of June\r\n    1860, apparently the one at which this communication was made.\r\n    \"It is evident,\" he writes, \"he [Lord Palmerston] does not\r\n    wish to lose Lord John, though he would be very glad if\r\n    Gladstone resigned.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Emperor of the French to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPARIS, _le 31 Décembre 1860_.\r\n\r\nMADAME ET TRÈS CHÈRE S[OE]UR,--Je ne veux pas laisser cette année\r\ns'écouler sans venir porter à votre Majesté l'expression de mes\r\nsouhaits pour son bonheur et celui du Prince et de sa famille.\r\nJ'espère que l'année qui va commencer sera heureuse pour nos deux\r\nnations, et qu'elle verra encore nos liens se resserrer.

My head is in such a state, I do not know where\r\nI am hardly--whether I am in a dream or awake, what is yesterday and\r\nwhat to-day! What we have so long expected is come at last! All the\r\nconfusion, bustle, excitement, noise, etc., is all swallowed up in\r\nthat one thought for me--I have seen death for the first time! It has\r\nmade an impression upon me that I shall never, never forget as long\r\nas I live--and I feel so ill, so confused and upset by all that I have\r\ngone through in the last forty-eight hours, that you must forgive\r\nme if I write incoherently and unclearly. But to go back to Monday\r\nevening (it seems to me a year now). At a quarter to eight in the\r\nevening of Monday the 31st, I took dear darling Affie to the railway\r\nstation, and took leave of him with a heavy heart. You know I love\r\nthat dear boy distractedly, and that nothing could have given me more\r\npleasure than his dear, long-wished-for visit. At nine o'clock Fritz\r\nand I went to tea at the Prince Regent's; we four were alone together.\r\nThe Princess was rather low and unwell, the Prince low-spirited, and\r\nI thinking of nothing but Affie and of how dear he is. While we were\r\nsitting at tea we received bad news from Sans Souci,[3] but nothing\r\nto make us particularly uneasy. Fritz and I went home and to bed, not\r\nbeing in a humour to sit up till twelve.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past one we heard a knock at the door and my wardrobe maid\r\nbrought in a telegram saying the King was given up, and a note from\r\nthe Prince Regent saying he was going up immediately. We got up in the\r\ngreatest hurry and dressed--I hardly know how; I put on just what\r\nI found, and had not time to do my hair or anything. After we had\r\nhurried on our clothes we went downstairs and out--for there was no\r\ntime to get a carriage or a footman or anything--it was a splendid\r\nnight, but twelve degrees of cold (Réaumur). I thought I was in a\r\ndream finding myself alone in the street with Fritz at two o'clock\r\nat night. We went to the Prince Regent's, and then with them in their\r\ncarriages to the railway station--we four all alone in the train. We\r\narrived at Sans Souci and went directly into the room where the King\r\nlay--the stillness of death was in the room--only the light of the\r\nfire and of a dim lamp. We approached the bed and stood there at the\r\nfoot of it, not daring to look at one another or to say a word. The\r\nQueen was sitting in an armchair at the head of the bed, her arm\r\nunderneath the King's head, and her head on the same pillow on which\r\nhe lay; with her other hand she continually wiped the perspiration\r\nfrom his forehead. You might have heard a pin drop; no sound was heard\r\nbut the crackling of the fire and the _death-rattle_, that dreadful\r\nsound which goes to one's heart, and which tells plainly that life is\r\nebbing. This rattling in the throat lasted about an hour longer, and\r\nthen the King lay motionless. The doctors bent their heads low to hear\r\nwhether he still breathed--and we stood, not even daring to sit down,\r\nwatching the death-struggle; every now and then the King breathed very\r\nfast and loud, but never unclosed his eyes; he was very red in the\r\nface, and the cold perspiration pouring from his forehead. I never\r\nspent such an awful time! And to see the poor Queen sitting there\r\nquite rent my heart--three, four, five, six, seven struck, and we were\r\nstill standing there--one member of the family came in after the other\r\nand remained motionless in the room, sobs only breaking the silence.\r\nOh! it is dreadful to see a person die! All the thoughts and feelings\r\nthat crowded on my mind in those hours I cannot describe, more than in\r\nmy whole past lifetime. The light of the morning dawned, and the lamps\r\nwere taken away--oh, how sad for the first morning in the year! We\r\nall went into the next room, for I assure you, anxiety, watching,\r\nstanding, and crying had worn us out. The Princess fell asleep on a\r\nchair, I on a sofa, and the rest walked up and down the room asking\r\none another, How long will it last? Towards the middle of the day,\r\nMarianne and I went into the room alone, as we wished to stay there;\r\nwe came up and kissed the Queen's hand and knelt down and kissed the\r\nKing's; it was quite warm still. We stood about and waited till five\r\no'clock and then had some dinner, and I felt so sick and faint and\r\nunwell, that Fritz sent me here to bed. At one o'clock this morning I\r\ngot up and dressed, and heard that the King had not many minutes more\r\nto live, but by the time I had got the carriage I heard all was over.\r\nI drove to Sans Souci and saw the King and Queen. May God bless and\r\npreserve them, and may theirs be a long and happy and blessed reign.\r\nThen I went into the room where the King lay, and I could hardly bring\r\nmyself to go away again. There was so much of comfort in looking\r\nat that quiet, peaceful form, at rest at last after all he had\r\nsuffered--gone home at last from this world of suffering--so peaceful\r\nand quiet he looked, like a sleeping child. Every moment I expected to\r\nsee him move or breathe--his mouth and eyes closed, and such a sweet\r\nand happy expression--both his hands were on the coverlid. I kissed\r\nthem both for the last time; they were quite cold then. Fritz and I\r\nstood looking at him for some time. I could hardly bring myself\r\nto believe that this was really death, that which I had so often\r\nshuddered at and felt afraid of; there was nothing there dreadful or\r\nappalling, only a heavenly calm and peace. I felt it did me so much\r\ngood, and was such a comfort. \"Death, where is thy sting? Grave,\r\nwhere is thy victory?\" He was a just and good man, and had a heart\r\noverflowing with love and kindness, and he has gone to his rest after\r\na long trial which he bore with so much patience. I am not afraid of\r\ndeath now, and when I feel inclined to be so, I shall think of that\r\nsolemn and comforting sight, and that death is only a change for the\r\nbetter. We went home and to bed and this morning went there at ten.\r\nI sat some time with the poor Queen, who is so calm and resigned and\r\ntouching in her grief. She does not cry, but she looks heartbroken.\r\nShe said to me: \"I am not longer of any use in this world. I have no\r\nlonger any vocation, any duties to perform. I only lived for him.\"\r\nThen she was so kind to me, kinder than she has ever been yet, and\r\nsaid I was like her own child and a comfort to her. I saw the corpse\r\nagain this morning; he is unaltered, only changed in colour, and the\r\nhands are stiffened.\r\n\r\nThe funeral will be on Saturday; the King will lie in state till then.\r\nHis wish was to be buried in Friedenskirche before the altar--and his\r\nheart at Charlottenburg in the Mausoleum. Of course all will be done\r\nthat he wishes. His servants are in a dreadful state. They adored him,\r\nand nursed him day and night for three years with the most devoted\r\nattachment. The King and Queen stay at Sans Souci till after the\r\nfuneral, and Fritz and I here at Potsdam.... Ever your most dutiful\r\nand devoted Daughter,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--The funeral will only take place on Monday, and the body will\r\nbe embalmed to-morrow. To-morrow evening there will be prayers at the\r\nbedside, and the day after the lying in state.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The palace at Potsdam, built by Frederick the\r\n    Great, the usual residence of the King of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LETTER TO THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the Emperor of the French._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _le 3 Janvier 1861_.\r\n\r\nSIRE ET CHER FRÈRE,--Les bons v[oe]ux que votre Majesté veut bien\r\nm'exprimer à l'occasion de la nouvelle année me sont bien chers, et\r\nje vous prie d'en accepter mes remercîments sincères, ainsi que\r\nl'expression des v[oe]ux que je forme pour le bonheur de votre\r\nMajesté, de l'Impératrice et de votre cher enfant; le Prince se joint\r\nà moi dans ces sentiments.\r\n\r\nVotre Majesté a bien raison si elle regarde avec quelque inquiétude\r\nl'état agité de l'Europe, mais je partage aussi avec elle le ferme\r\nespoir, que le mal peut être beaucoup amoindri, tant que la France et\r\nl'Angleterre s'entendent, et j'y ajouterai, tant que cette entente a\r\npour but désintéressé de préserver au monde la paix et à chaque\r\nnation ses droits et ses possessions, et d'adoucir des animosités, qui\r\nmenacent de produire les plus graves calamités, des guerres civiles\r\net des luttes de races.

He is glad to be able to say that Lady\r\nJocelyn's youngest boy, whose illness has been the cause of very great\r\nanxiety, is now in the course of gradual, but favourable recovery.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston returns to your Majesty the letter of the Emperor\r\nof the French, and your Majesty's excellent answer; it is to be hoped\r\nthat he will profit by the sound advice which that answer contains.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of Italy your Majesty reminds Viscount Palmerston\r\nthat he stated last summer that it would be better for the interests\r\nof England that Southern Italy should be a separate Monarchy, rather\r\nthan that it should form part of an united Italy. Viscount Palmerston\r\nstill retains that opinion; because a separate kingdom of the Two\r\nSicilies would be more likely, in the event of war between England and\r\nFrance, to side, at least by its neutrality, with the strongest Naval\r\nPower, and it is to be hoped that such Power would be England. But\r\nthen it would be necessary that the Two Sicilies as an independent and\r\nseparate State should be well governed, and should have an enlightened\r\nSovereign. This unfortunately has become hopeless and impossible under\r\nthe Bourbon Dynasty, and no Englishman could wish to see a Murat or a\r\nPrince Napoleon on the Throne of Naples.[4] The course of events\r\nsince last summer seems to have finally decided the fate of Sicily and\r\nNaples, and there can be no doubt that for the interest of the people\r\nof Italy, and with a view to the general balance of Power in Europe,\r\na united Italy is the best arrangement. The Italian Kingdom will never\r\nside with France from partiality to France, and the stronger that\r\nkingdom becomes the better able it will be to resist political\r\ncoercion from France. The chief hold that France will have upon the\r\npolicy of the Kingdom of Italy consists in the retention of Venetia by\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston has heard no more from Lord John Russell about his\r\nwish eventually to go to the House of Lords, and it is probable that\r\nthis wish often before expressed will, as upon former occasions, be\r\nallowed to sleep undisturbed....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Prince Napoleon Murat, a son of Joachim Murat,\r\n    King of Naples, 1808-1815, had returned to France from the\r\n    United States in 1848; an attempt was now being made to form a\r\n    Murat party in Southern Italy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _19th January 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter enclosing his\r\ncorrespondence with Lord Clarendon.[5] She has kept the latter in\r\norder to show it to Lord Palmerston this evening, not knowing whether\r\nhe has seen it already. She must say that Lord Clarendon's arguments\r\nare very conclusive. Has it ever occurred to Lord John Russell that,\r\nif Lord Clarendon were to go to Berlin carrying the highest compliment\r\nthe Queen has to bestow, viz. the Order of the Garter to the new King\r\nof Prussia, and from thence to Vienna empty-handed to the Emperor of\r\nAustria for the purpose of giving good advice, the Emperor might look\r\nupon it as an offensive public proceeding towards him?\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Lord Clarendon was appointed to represent the\r\n    Queen at the Coronation of the King of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: CONSERVATIVE OVERTURES]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY, _27th January 1861_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty....\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston saw Lord Malmesbury on Friday before the Cabinet.\r\nThey both came up in the same train though not in the same carriage,\r\nand Lord Malmesbury came to Viscount Palmerston's in Piccadilly at\r\nthree o'clock.\r\n\r\nHe said that he was charged by Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli with a\r\nmessage similar to that which he had conveyed last year, namely, that\r\nif Mr Gladstone were to propose a democratic Budget making a great\r\ntransfer of burthens from indirect to direct Taxation, and if, the\r\nCabinet refusing its concurrence, Mr Gladstone were to retire, the\r\nConservative Party would give the Government substantial support\r\nexcept in the case of the Government wishing to take an active part\r\nin war against Austria. That this did not of course mean an abstinence\r\nfrom usual attacks and criticisms in debate, but that no step would\r\nin such case be taken to produce a change of Government. In fact, said\r\nLord Malmesbury, neither the Conservative leaders nor the Party wish\r\nat present to come into office, and have no intention of taking any\r\nstep to turn the present Government out. Mr Bright had indeed\r\nproposed to Mr Disraeli to join together with the Radical Party, the\r\nConservatives, for the purpose of turning out the present Government;\r\nand especially to get rid of Viscount Palmerston and Lord John\r\nRussell. Mr Bright said he would in that case give the Conservative\r\nGovernment a two years' existence, and by the end of that time the\r\ncountry, it might be hoped, would be prepared for a good and real\r\nReform Bill, and then a proper Government might be formed.\r\n\r\nThis proposal, which it must be owned was not very tempting, Lord\r\nMalmesbury said had been declined. He also said that Count Persigny,\r\non returning from one of his trips to Paris, had brought a\r\nsimilar proposal from Mr Cobden for a co-operation of Radicals and\r\nConservatives to overthrow the present Government; but that also had\r\nbeen declined. Viscount Palmerston requested Lord Malmesbury to\r\nconvey his thanks to Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli for the handsome\r\ncommunication which they had thus made to him, and to assure them that\r\nhe fully appreciated the honourable and patriotic motives by which it\r\nhad been prompted....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _29th January 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--I write to you on a sad anniversary--already\r\n_seventeen_ years ago, that it pleased God to take dearest Papa away\r\nfrom us all!

I have had no answer as yet, and the election is\r\nfixed for to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe election is on the same footing as that of a bishop who is\r\nnominally elected by the Chapter of the Diocese, but who is named for\r\nbeing so elected by the Crown. The Crown recommends the person to be\r\nnamed Provost, and the Fellows as a matter of course elect him. But\r\nthe election must be made within a stated period--I believe fifteen\r\ndays after the vacancy has happened; and if the Crown does not within\r\nthat period recommend, the Fellows proceed to make their own choice.\r\n\r\nThe election is fixed for to-morrow, and it would not, I think, be\r\ndesirable to let the Royal prerogative drop on this occasion. The\r\npersons who have been named as candidates are Dr Goodford, Headmaster,\r\nand with regard to him it is to be said that the office has generally\r\nbeen given to the Headmaster, and that, as far as the Provost has any\r\nfunction connected with improvements in the arrangement of the school,\r\nthere is an advantage in his having been conversant with the details\r\nof the existing system. Dr Goodford is qualified for the office by his\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe next candidate is Mr Coleridge, once a master in the school, but\r\nhe is not qualified by a sufficient degree, and there was a prejudice\r\nagainst him on account of his Puseyite tendencies.\r\n\r\nThe third is Dr Chapman, late Bishop of Colombo, qualified by his\r\ndegree, but having no peculiar claims or other recommendations for the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe fourth is Mr Birch, formerly tutor to the Prince of Wales,\r\nscarcely of sufficient calibre for the office, and not qualified by a\r\nsufficient degree.\r\n\r\nBetween Dr Goodford and Dr Chapman I think the preference should be\r\ngiven to Dr Goodford, and the more especially because Dr Chapman is\r\nsupposed to entertain theological opinions similar to those of Mr\r\nColeridge, his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nIf the Queen should approve of Dr Goodford being recommended,\r\nperhaps she would have the goodness to sign the document sent in the\r\naccompanying box, and if it is returned by the earliest opportunity it\r\nis just possible that I may be able to send it to Windsor in time for\r\nthe election to-morrow.[6] Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nPALMERSTON.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Dr Goodford was elected, and remained Provost\r\n    till his death in 1884.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n_10th February 1861._\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's letter enclosing the draft\r\nof one to General Garibaldi, which she now returns. She had much\r\ndoubt about its being altogether safe for the Government to get into\r\ncorrespondence, however unofficial, with the General, and thinks\r\nthat it would be better for Lord John _not_ to write to him. Lord\r\nPalmerston, who was here this afternoon on other business, has\r\nundertaken to explain the reasons in detail to Lord John--in which he\r\nfully concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: GARIBALDI]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord John Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nCHESHAM PLACE, _11th February 1861_.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; he\r\nearnestly entreats your Majesty to consider whether any step ought to\r\nbe omitted by which the peace of Europe may be preserved.\r\n\r\nGeneral Garibaldi is generally esteemed by Italians; even Count Ludolf\r\nspeaks of him in the highest terms of praise. General Garibaldi\r\nhas lost his country, and is full of resentment at Count Cavour for\r\nselling it. He respects and admires England for her disinterested\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident the French Emperor is again exciting the Hungarian\r\nparty. The Garibaldian legion is told to hold itself in readiness, and\r\nthe _Pays_ and _Patrie_ are instructed to praise the Legion. They are\r\nbeing assembled in Genoa and Piedmont.\r\n\r\nThere is little chance of Garibaldi's refusing to take part in this\r\nexpedition, and if he does proceed to the Dalmatian or Istrian coast,\r\nhis name will have an immense effect.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem reasonable to throw away any chance of saving the\r\nAustrian Empire and the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell will wait till Monday next to learn definitively\r\nyour Majesty's pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe proposed letter appears to him to give some hope of preventing\r\ngreat misfortunes. In this belief it is Lord John Russell's duty to\r\nendeavour to prevent the frightful war which is impending.\r\n\r\nKossuth is fabricating paper to the extent of from 140 to 300,000,000\r\nof florins to furnish the sinews of insurrection. In the month of\r\nMarch Hungary will be in a blaze. But if Italy, Germany, and France\r\nkeep away, the fire may burn out of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n_11th February 1861._\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and in\r\nreturning Lord John's letter begs to submit, that as Lord John is so\r\nanxious to send it, and seems so strongly of opinion that it is\r\nan effort which might be successful in dissuading Garibaldi from\r\nattempting to create disturbances in the Austrian territory by going\r\nthither with a band of adventurers, it may be best to let the letter\r\ngo, though it might perhaps be improved by pointing more directly\r\nto the nature of the expedition which it advises Garibaldi not to\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\nThere may be inconveniences which may arise from the letter, but they\r\nmight be dealt with; on the other hand, if Garibaldi undertakes his\r\nexpedition, it would be a matter of regret if it could be thought\r\nor said that a step which might have prevented the mischief had been\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _12th February 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has received Lord John Russell's reiterated request for her\r\nsanction to his writing to General Garibaldi. She still entertains\r\nthe same objections to the step, as implying a recognition of the\r\nGeneral's position as a European Power as enabling him to allow the\r\nimpression to prevail, that he is in communication with the British\r\nGovernment and acts under its inspiration, as possibly leading to a\r\nprolonged and embarrassing correspondence, and as implying for the\r\nfuture that when the disapprobation of the Government is not expressed\r\n(as in the present instance), it gives its consent to his aggressive\r\nschemes. The Queen will not prevent, however, Lord John from taking\r\na step which he considers gives a chance of averting a great European\r\ncalamity. Should Lord John therefore adhere to his opinion, she asks\r\nhim to let her see the letter again, upon the precise wording of which\r\nso much depends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A HAPPY ANNIVERSARY]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _12th February 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many, many thanks for your dear letter of the 8th.\r\nHere we have cold again since the day before yesterday, and last night\r\nseven degrees of frost. On Sunday we celebrated, with feelings of\r\n_deep gratitude_ and love, the _twenty-first_ anniversary of our\r\nblessed marriage, a day which had brought us, and I may say the\r\n_world_ at _large_, such incalculable blessings! _Very_ few can say\r\nwith me that their husband at the end of twenty-one years is _not_\r\nonly full of the friendship, kindness, and affection which a truly\r\nhappy marriage brings with it, but the same tender love of the _very\r\nfirst days of our marriage!_\r\n\r\nWe missed dear Mamma and _three_ of our children,[7] but had _six_\r\ndear ones round us--and assembled in the evening those of our\r\nHousehold _still_ remaining who were _with us then!_...\r\n\r\nIn Parliament things go on quietly enough, and every one _hopes_ for a\r\nshort session....\r\n\r\nHoping that these lines will find you well, believe me ever, your\r\ndevoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The Duchess of Kent was at Frogmore; the Princess\r\n    Royal, now Crown Princess of Prussia, was at Potsdam; the\r\n    Prince of Wales had just entered upon his first term at\r\n    Cambridge; and Prince Alfred had joined his ship, the\r\n    _Euryalus_, at Plymouth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: LORD JOHN RUSSELL AND GARIBALDI]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _13th February 1861_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\r\nbegs to state that the Cabinet at its meeting this afternoon were\r\nof opinion that Lord John Russell's proposed letter to Garibaldi, as\r\naltered by Lord John, might do good, and could scarcely be attended\r\nwith any material inconvenience, and that therefore it might go.[8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: It accordingly was sent in the following form:--\r\n\r\n    GENERAL,--You did me the honour, some time ago, to write me a\r\n    letter, thanking me for a speech I made in Parliament.\r\n\r\n    I was not insensible to the value of that compliment. My\r\n    present purpose however is not compliment.\r\n\r\n    I wish you seriously to reconsider your declaration that you\r\n    propose to begin a war in the Spring.\r\n\r\n    It seems to me that no individual, however distinguished, has\r\n    a right to determine for his country the momentous question of\r\n    peace or war with a foreign State.\r\n\r\n    Italy, represented by a free Parliament, is about to assemble\r\n    and declare her own sentiments and wishes.\r\n\r\n    It is surely for the King and the Parliament together to\r\n    decide on questions which may involve all Europe in bloodshed.\r\n\r\n    I cannot believe that you will be the man to give the signal\r\n    of dissension in Italy.

You, however,\r\n    judge me somewhat harshly; giving credence to rumours which\r\n    attribute to me projects that are not known to any one.\r\n\r\n    I hope to make war again for my country. But I desire that\r\n    you, deserving as you are of my esteem and attachment, should\r\n    believe that I will not undertake anything which may injure or\r\n    be in contradiction with the rights of the King and Parliament\r\n    of Italy.\r\n\r\n    I do not love war, Minister, but, in the present condition of\r\n    my country, it appears most difficult to constitute her in a\r\n    normal manner, without war.\r\n\r\n    I am sure that Italy is able to make her war of liberation\r\n    even this year. The person who directs does not feel the same\r\n    certainty, and I leave it to you to weigh his motives. I, if\r\n    I am not called upon by events, shall continue in my retreat,\r\n    and I will, in every way, endeavour to gain your good-will,\r\n    and that of the generous nation to whom my country owes so\r\n    much, etc., etc., etc. I am your devoted Servant,\r\n\r\n    G.

The\r\nnumber wanted appears large, but the Queen must add that she does not\r\nconsider one ship a sufficient preponderance over the French Navy for\r\nthis country.

It is _too_\r\ndreadful! But she is at peace--at rest--her fearful sufferings at\r\nan end! It was quite painless--though there was very _distressing_,\r\nheartrending breathing to witness. I held her dear, dear hand in mine\r\nto the very last, which I am truly thankful for! But the watching that\r\nprecious life going out was fearful! Alas! she never knew me!

On Sunday I took leave of those dearly beloved remains--a\r\ndreadful moment; I had never been near a coffin before, but dreadful\r\nand heartrending as it was, it was so beautifully arranged that it\r\nwould have pleased _her_, and most probably _she_ looked down and\r\nblessed _us_--as we poor sorrowing mortals knelt around, overwhelmed\r\nwith grief! It was covered with wreaths, and the carpet strewed\r\nwith sweet, white flowers. _I_ and our daughters did _not_ go\r\n_yesterday_--it would have been _far_ too much for _me_--and Albert\r\nwhen he returned, with tearful eyes told me it was well I did not\r\ngo--so affecting had been the sight--so _universal_ the sympathy.\r\n\r\nPoor little Arthur went too. I and my girls prayed at home together,\r\nand dwelt on her happiness and peace.\r\n\r\nBut oh! dearest Uncle--the loss--the truth of it--which _I cannot, do\r\nnot_ realise even when I go (as I do _daily_) to Frogmore--the _blank_\r\nbecomes _daily_ worse!\r\n\r\nThe constant intercourse of _forty-one_, years cannot cease without\r\nthe _total want_ of _power_ of _real enjoyment_ of _anything_. A sort\r\nof cloud which hangs over you, and seems to _oppress_ everything--and\r\na positive _weakness_ in the powers of reflection and mental exertion.\r\nThe doctors _tell_ me I _must not_ attempt to _force_ this. Long\r\nconversation, loud talking, the talking of many people together, I\r\n_can't_ bear yet. It must come _very_ gradually....\r\n\r\nI try to be, and very often am, quite _resigned_--but dearest Uncle,\r\nthis is a life sorrow. On _all_ festive or mournful occasions, on\r\n_all_ family events, _her love_ and _sympathy_ will be so _fearfully\r\nwanting_. Then again, except Albert (who I very often don't see but\r\nvery little in the day), I have _no human_ being except our children,\r\nand that is not the same _Verhältniss_, to _open_ myself to; and\r\nbesides, a _woman_ requires _woman's_ society and sympathy sometimes,\r\nas men do _men's_. All this, beloved Uncle, will show you that,\r\nwithout _dwelling_ constantly upon it, or _moping_ or becoming\r\n_morbid_, though the _blank_ and the _loss to me_, in my isolated\r\nposition especially, is _such_ a _dreadful_, and such an _irreparable\r\none_, the worst _trials_ are _yet_ to come. My poor birthday, I\r\ncan hardly think of it! Strange it is how often _little trifles_,\r\ninsignificant in themselves, upset one more even than greater\r\nthings....\r\n\r\nBut the general sympathy for _me_, and approval of the manner in\r\nwhich I have shown my grief, as well as the affection and respect for\r\ndearest Mamma's memory in the country, is _quite wonderful and most\r\ntouching_.

It is\r\n_to-day_ a _fortnight_ already, and it seems but yesterday--_all_ is\r\nbefore me, and at the same time _all, all_ seems _quite impossible_.\r\nThe blank--the desolation--the fearful and awful _Sehnsucht und\r\nWehmuth_ come back with redoubled force, and the _weeping_, which day\r\nafter day is my welcome friend, is my greatest relief.\r\n\r\nWe have an immense deal to do--and everything is in the greatest\r\n_order_; but to _open her_ drawers and presses, and to look at all her\r\ndear jewels and trinkets in order to identify everything, and relieve\r\nher really excellent servants from all responsibility and anxiety, is\r\nlike a sacrilege, and I feel as if my heart was being torn asunder! So\r\nmany recollections of my childhood are brought back to me, and these\r\ndumb souvenirs which she wore and used, and which so painfully survive\r\n_what_ we so _dearly_ and _passionately_ loved, touch chords in one's\r\nheart and soul, which are _most_ painful and yet pleasing too. We have\r\nfound many most interesting and valuable letters--the existence of\r\nwhich I was not aware of--and which, I _think_, must have come back\r\nwith poor Papa's letters, viz. letters from _my_ poor father asking\r\nfor dearest Mamma's hand--and sending a letter from you, encouraging\r\nhim to ask her. And many others--very precious letters--from dear\r\nGrandmamma; Albert has also found at Clarence House, where he went\r\nto-day, many of dear Grandpapa's.[10] ...\r\n\r\nFrogmore we mean to keep just as dear Mamma left it--and keep it\r\ncheerful and pretty as it still is. I go there constantly; I feel so\r\naccustomed to go down the hill, and _so_ attracted to it, for I fancy\r\n_she_ must be there.\r\n\r\nWas poor dear Grandpapa's death-bed such a sad one? You speak of its\r\ndistressing impressions.[11] ...\r\n\r\nShe watches _over us now_, you may be sure! Ever your devoted,\r\nsorrowing Child and Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\nAlbert is so kind, and does all with such tenderness and feeling.\r\nVicky goes on Tuesday, and we on Wednesday, to Osborne, where I think\r\nthe air and quiet will do me good.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: Duke Francis Frederick of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld,\r\n    and Duchess Augusta Caroline Sophia, the parents of the\r\n    Duchess of Kent and King Leopold.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: In a recent letter King Leopold had said that he\r\n    was not quite sixteen years old when his father died (1806),\r\n    and the elder son, Ernest, being alarmingly ill at Königsberg,\r\n    he was himself called upon to be the support of his mother.\r\n    \"The recollections of that death-bed,\" he adds, \"are fresh in\r\n    my memory, as if it had been yesterday.

I can see everything, and it makes me shed tears of the\r\nsincerest sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe bereavement, the impossibility, they are what one feels most\r\ndeeply and painfully, that nothing will bring back the beloved object,\r\nthat there is a rupture with everything earthly that nothing can\r\nremedy. Your good, dear Mamma was without ostentation, sincerely\r\nreligious, a great blessing, and the only solid support we can find.\r\nHappy those whose faith cannot be shaken; they can bear the hardships\r\nof earthly life with fortitude.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that if we compare the sorrows of our earthly life with the\r\nhope of an eternal existence, though painfully felt, still they shrink\r\nas it were in appreciation.\r\n\r\nYou feel so _truly_, so _affectionately_, that even in that you must\r\ngratify the dear being we lost. When I think of poor Aunt Julia,[12]\r\nshe was so alone that I cannot help to pity her even in all the\r\nobjects she valued and left behind; the affectionate care which is\r\nshown to everything connected with your dear Mamma could not have\r\nexisted, and still she was a noble character, and with a warm,\r\ngenerous heart. In all your dear Mamma's letters there will everywhere\r\nbe found traces of the affection which united us. From early childhood\r\nwe were close allies; she recollected everything so well of that\r\nperiod which now, since the departure of the two sisters, is totally\r\nunknown to every one but me, which, you can imagine, is a most\r\nmelancholy sensation. Time flies so fast that all dear recollections\r\nsoon get isolated. Your stay at Osborne will do you good, though\r\nSpring, when fine, affects one very much, to think that the one that\r\nwas beloved does not share in these pleasant sensations. You must try,\r\nhowever, not to shake your precious health too much. Your dear Mamma,\r\nwho watched your looks so affectionately, would not approve of it....\r\nYour devoted old Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Sister of King Leopold, and widow of the Grand\r\n    Duke Constantine, who had lived in retirement at Geneva for\r\n    many years, and died at Elfenau on the 15th of August 1860.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _9th April 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY DEARLY BELOVED UNCLE,--Your dear, _sad_ letter of the 5th found a\r\nwarm response in my poor heart, and I thank you with all my heart\r\nfor it. I am _now most_ anxiously waiting for an answer to my letter\r\nasking you to come to us _now_. You would, I think, find it soothing,\r\nand it would painfully interest you to look over her letters and\r\npapers, which make me _live_ in times I heard her talk of when I was\r\na child. It is touching to find how she treasured up every little\r\nflower, every bit of hair. I found some of dear Princess Charlotte's,\r\nand touching relics of my poor Father, in a little writing-desk of his\r\nI had never seen, with his last letters to her, and her notes _after_\r\nhis death written in a little book, expressing such longing to be\r\nreunited to him! _Now_ she _is!_ And what a comfort it is to think\r\n_how many very dear ones_ are gone on before her whom she will find!\r\nAll these notes show how very, very much she and my beloved Father\r\n_loved_ each other. _Such_ love and affection! I hardly knew it was\r\n_to that extent_. Then her love for _me_--it is _too_ touching! I have\r\nfound little books with the accounts of my babyhood, and they show\r\n_such_ unbounded tenderness! Oh! I am so wretched to think _how_, _for\r\na time_, _two people most_ wickedly estranged us!... To miss a mother's\r\nfriendship--not to be able to have her to confide in--when a girl\r\n_most_ needs it, was fearful! I _dare not_ think of it--it drives me\r\n_wild_ now! But thank God! that is all passed _long, long_ ago, and\r\nshe had forgotten it, and only thought of the last very happy years.\r\n\r\nAnd all that was brought by my good angel, dearest Albert, whom _she_\r\nadored, and in whom she had such unbounded confidence....\r\n\r\nOn Sunday our dear little Beatrice was four years old. It upset me\r\nmuch, for she was the idol of that beloved Grandmamma, and the child\r\nso fond of her. She continually speaks of her--how she \"is in Heaven,\"\r\nbut hopes she will return!

She has to observe that this reverses the whole\r\nposition taken by us hitherto. Prince Gortschakoff is quite right in\r\nreminding us that the engagements taken in 1852[13] did not contain\r\na formal guarantee (_obliging_ to take up arms for the defence of\r\nthe object guaranteed) in deference to the opinion of the British\r\nGovernment which, on general principles, has always objected to such\r\nengagements. These principles are as important now as ever, and yet\r\nLord John proposes \"to renew the _guarantee_ of the integrity of the\r\nDanish Monarchy contained in the Treaty of 8th May 1852,\" thereby\r\ngiving those engagements the force of a guarantee, which was on\r\nprinciple objected to by us at the time. Both Russia and France in\r\ntheir answers object to such a guarantee now, even with regard to\r\nSchleswig alone, as involving the guaranteeing powers in future grave\r\ndifficulties, and Lord John proposes to extend it to Holstein, a part\r\nof Germany and not of Denmark, by way of obviating the difficulty. The\r\nQueen cannot give her sanction to this proposal.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: A Treaty was signed by the European Powers on\r\n    the 8th of May 1852, by which the succession of the line of\r\n    Sonderburg-Glücksburg to the Danish throne was settled, and\r\n    the integrity of the kingdom guaranteed.

She thinks it of great importance that\r\nwe should be strong in Canada, and thinks an increase in Artillery as\r\nimportant as the sending of two more battalions, as that Arm cannot\r\nbe supplied at all by the Colony. The Naval forces would, however,\r\nrequire strengthening even more.

She\r\nis of opinion that so important a step as proposals on our part for\r\nthe solution of the Roman Question, with which we are not directly\r\nconcerned, and for the solution of which we are for many obvious\r\nreasons perhaps the Power possessing the least favourable position, is\r\na subject of such great importance, that it should not be undertaken\r\nwithout the most mature consideration. Has this draft been brought\r\nbefore the Cabinet? The Queen wishes to have their united advice\r\nbefore giving her decision.

If that\r\nwere possible, it might have the double advantage of strengthening his\r\nhands during the remainder of his stay, by affording so public a mark\r\nof your Majesty's approval; and moreover of making sure that Lord\r\nCanning should receive this mark of your Majesty's royal favour, while\r\nthe Government is in the hands of an administration similar to that\r\nat whose recommendation he was sent out, which perhaps might be more\r\nagreeable to his feelings than running the chance, always possible,\r\nthough Viscount Palmerston hopes it may not be probable, that\r\npolitical combinations might, before his return in May or June 1862,\r\nhave produced administrative changes.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: The Duke was First Lord of the Admiralty.

He spoke\r\nvery late in life of your Majesty's constant kindness. This feeling\r\nand early associations made him take a great interest in the Princess\r\nRoyal's marriage, which did not leave him. If it ever crossed your\r\nMajesty--if your Majesty should ever feel that I might have been\r\ndevoted, if I had had but one service, pray believe that he took the\r\ngreatest pleasure and pride in that other great service; and that\r\ntherefore he really felt it best it should be so.\r\n\r\nSince I have written this I have received your Majesty's most kind\r\nletter--and the precious gift of the photograph so wonderfully like,\r\nand rendering exactly that most kind and loving countenance.

How\r\noften I shall think of this in my altered life, in my solitude of\r\nheart! The admiration I have ever felt for the Prince has been one\r\nof the great pleasures of my life; that he should be your Majesty's\r\nhusband, a constant thankfulness.

Mr\r\nCharles Buxton seconded the Motion. Mr Cowper[21] opposed it, stating\r\nreasons for preferring the Italian style to the Gothic. Mr Layard was\r\nfor neither, but seemed to wish that somebody would invent a new style\r\nof architecture. Mr Tite,[22] the architect, was strongly for the\r\nItalian style; Lord John Manners, swayed by erroneous views in\r\nreligion and taste, was enthusiastic for Gothic;[23] Mr Dudley\r\nFortescue confided in a low voice to a limited range of hearers some\r\nweak arguments in favour of Gothic; Mr Osborne seemed to be against\r\neverything that anybody had ever proposed, and wanted to put off the\r\nbuilding till some plan better suited to his own taste should have\r\nbeen invented. Viscount Palmerston answered the objections made to the\r\nItalian plan, and Lord Elcho's Motion was negatived by 188 to 75. The\r\nHouse then went into Committee of Supply, and the first estimate being\r\nthat for the Foreign Office, some of the Gothic party who had not been\r\nable to deliver their speeches on Lord Elcho's Motion, let them off on\r\nthis estimate....\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Now Earl of Wemyss.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: Mr William Cowper, at this time First\r\n    Commissioner of Works.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: Mr (afterwards Sir) William Tite, was now Member\r\n    for Bath; he had been the architect entrusted with the task of\r\n    rebuilding the Royal Exchange.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Mr Gilbert Scott had made his first designs for\r\n    the new Foreign Office in the Gothic style; his appointment as\r\n    architect for the building was made by the Derby Government,\r\n    but the scheme which they favoured, for a Gothic building,\r\n    was opposed by Lord Palmerston, and Scott adopted the Italian\r\n    style in deference to his views.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _24th July 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is sorry that she cannot alter her determination about Mr\r\nLayard.[24] She fully recognises the importance of the Parliamentary\r\nexigencies; but the Queen cannot sacrifice to them the higher\r\ninterests of the country.

His tenure of office\r\nat that time was short; not from any fault of his, but because the\r\nGovernment of that day was overthrown by Viscount Palmerston's Motion\r\nin the House of Commons in February 1852 about the Militia; and Lord\r\nGranville speaks highly of Mr Layard's performance of his official\r\nduties at that time. There is no reason, but the reverse, for thinking\r\nhim less competent now than then; and an Under-Secretary of State is\r\nonly the instrument and mouthpiece of his principal to say what he is\r\ntold, and to write what he is bid.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Mr Layard's position in the House of Commons, he would\r\nin no respect be the representative of the Foreign Policy of the\r\ncountry; that function will belong to Viscount Palmerston, now that\r\nthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will be removed to the\r\nHouse of Lords, and it will be Viscount Palmerston's duty and care\r\nto see that nobody infringes upon that function. Mr Layard would be\r\nuseful to answer unimportant questions as to matters of fact, but all\r\nquestions involving the Foreign Policy of the country will be answered\r\nby Viscount Palmerston as head of the Government, as was done when\r\nLord Clarendon was Foreign Secretary and in the House of Lords. But\r\nthere are not unfrequently great debates on Foreign Affairs in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and there are many members, some of them not perhaps\r\nof great weight, who join in attacks on such matters. It is of great\r\nimportance to your Majesty's Government to have a sufficient number\r\nof speakers on such occasions. Lord John Russell and Lord Herbert\r\nwere ready and powerful. Mr Gladstone is almost the only one on the\r\nTreasury Bench who follows up foreign questions close enough to take\r\nan active part; it would be of great advantage to Viscount Palmerston\r\nto have as assistant on such occasions a man like Mr Layard, knowing\r\nthe details of matters discussed, able to make a good speech in reply\r\nto Mr Fitzgerald, or Mr Baillie Cochrane,[25] or Mr Hennessy,[26] or\r\nSir G. Bowyer,[27] and who would shape his course in strict conformity\r\nwith the line which might be chalked out for him by Viscount\r\nPalmerston. Your Majesty need therefore be under no apprehension that\r\nMr Layard or anybody else, who might in the House of Commons hold the\r\noffice of Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, would appear\r\nto the world as the organ or representative of the Foreign Policy of\r\nyour Majesty's Government. With respect to giving Mr Layard any other\r\noffice of the same kind, there is none other in which he could be\r\nplaced without putting into the Foreign Office somebody far less fit\r\nfor it, and putting Mr Layard into some office for which he is far\r\nless fit. His fitness is for the Foreign Department, and to use the\r\nillustration, which was a favourite one of the late Mr Drummond,\r\nit would be putting the wrong man into the wrong hole. Viscount\r\nPalmerston has, as charged with the conduct of the business of the\r\nGovernment in the House of Commons, sustained a severe loss by the\r\nremoval of two most able and useful colleagues, Lord Herbert and\r\nLord John Russell, and he earnestly hopes that your Majesty will be\r\ngraciously pleased to assist him in his endeavours, not indeed to\r\nsupply their place, but in some degree to lessen the detriment which\r\ntheir removal has occasioned.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: Afterwards Lord Lamington.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: Mr (afterwards Sir) John Pope Hennessy, M.P. for\r\n    King's County.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: M.P. for Dundalk.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: MR LAYARD]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _25th July 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe Prince has reported to the Queen all that Lord Palmerston said\r\nto him on the subject of Mr Layard; this has not had the effect of\r\naltering her opinion as to the disqualifications of that gentleman\r\nfor the particular office for which Lord Palmerston proposes him. This\r\nappointment would, in the Queen's opinion, be a serious evil. If Lord\r\nPalmerston on sincere self-examination should consider that without it\r\nthe difficulty of carrying on his Government was such as to endanger\r\nthe continuance of its success, the Queen will, of course, have to\r\nadmit an evil for the country in order to avert a greater. She still\r\ntrusts, however, that knowing the nature of the Queen's objections, he\r\nwill not place her in this dilemma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\n94 PICCADILLY, _26th July 1861_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto be allowed to make his grateful and respectful acknowledgments\r\nfor your Majesty's gracious and condescending acquiescence in his\r\nrecommendation of Mr Layard for the appointment of Under-Secretary\r\nof State for the Foreign Department. It is always a source of most\r\nsincere pain to Viscount Palmerston to find himself differing, on any\r\npoint, in opinion with your Majesty, a respect for whose soundness\r\nof judgment, and clearness of understanding, must always lead him to\r\ndistrust the value of his own conclusions when they differ from those\r\nto which your Majesty has arrived. But the question about Mr Layard\r\nturned mainly upon considerations connected with the conduct of public\r\nbusiness of your Majesty's Government in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston sits in that House four days in every week during\r\nthe Session of Parliament, from half-past four in the afternoon to any\r\nhour however late after midnight at which the House may adjourn. It\r\nis his duty carefully to watch the proceedings of the House, and to\r\nobserve and measure the fluctuating bearings of Party and of sectional\r\nassociations on the present position of the Government, and on its\r\nchances for the future; and he is thus led to form conclusions as to\r\npersons and parties which may not equally strike, or with equal force,\r\nthose who from without and from higher regions may see general results\r\nwithout being eye- and ear-witnesses of the many small and successive\r\ndetails out of which those results are built up.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Viscount Palmerston was led to a strong conviction\r\nthat the proposed appointment of Mr Layard would be a great advantage\r\nto your Majesty's Government as regards the conduct of business in\r\nthe House of Commons, and the position of your Majesty's Government\r\nin that House; and he is satisfied that he will be able to prevent\r\nMr Layard in any subsidiary part which he may have to take in any\r\ndiscussion on foreign questions, from departing from the line\r\nwhich may be traced out for him by Lord John Russell and Viscount\r\nPalmerston....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE KING OF SWEDEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _13th August 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--Since Saturday we have great heat. _Our_ King of\r\nSweden[28] arrived yesterday evening. We went out in the yacht to meet\r\nhim, and did so; but his ship going slow, the _dress_ of the _hohen\r\nHerrn only_ arrived at a quarter to nine, and we only sat down to\r\ndinner at a quarter past nine! The King and Prince Oscar[29] are\r\nvery French, and very Italian! I think that there is a dream of a\r\nScandinavian Kingdom floating before them. The King is a fine-looking\r\nman.... He is not at all difficult to get on with, and is very civil.\r\nOscar is very amiable and mild, and very proud of his three little\r\nboys. They leave again quite early to-morrow.\r\n\r\nOur _dear_ children leave us, alas! on Friday quite early, for\r\nAntwerp.[30] It will again be a painful trial! Their stay has been\r\nvery pleasant and _gemüthlich_, and we have seen more of and known\r\ndear Fritz more thoroughly than we ever did before, and really he is\r\n_very_ excellent, and would, I am convinced, make an excellent King.\r\nThe little children are _very great_ darlings, and we shall miss them\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th we go to poor, dear Frogmore, and on the 17th we shall\r\nvisit that dear grave! Last year she was still so well, and so full\r\nof life; but it was a _very_ sad birthday, two days after the loss of\r\nthat dear beloved sister, whom she has joined so soon! Oh! the agony\r\nof _Wehmuth_, the bitterness of the blank, do _not_ get better with\r\ntime! Beloved Mamma, how hourly she is in my mind!\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia will have great pleasure in visiting you at\r\nWiesbaden; he will arrive at Ostend on the 16th....\r\n\r\nGood-bye, and God bless you, dearest Uncle.

He must, in the first place,\r\nexplain that much of what was said to him by the King of Sweden and by\r\nPrince Oscar was not clearly understood by him. They would both\r\nspeak English--which they spoke with difficulty and in an indistinct\r\nutterance of voice--and he did not like to break the conversation into\r\nFrench, because to have done so would have looked like a condemnation\r\nof their English, of any imperfection of which they did not seem to be\r\nat all conscious.\r\n\r\nThe King was very guarded in all he said about France; the Prince\r\nspoke with more freedom and with less caution. The result of what\r\nViscount Palmerston gathered from their conversation, and perhaps for\r\nthis purpose they may be put together, because they probably both feel\r\nand think nearly alike, though the Prince lets his thoughts out more\r\nthan the King, may be summed up as follows.\r\n\r\nThey were much pleased and flattered by the kind and friendly\r\nreception given them by the French Emperor, and both he and they seem\r\nto have had present to their minds that the existing Royal Family of\r\nSweden is descended from General Bernadotte--a General in the Army of\r\nthe First Napoleon. They think the French Emperor sincerely desirous\r\nof maintaining his alliance with England, believing it to be for his\r\ninterest to do so. But they consider the French Nation essentially\r\naggressive, and they think that the Emperor is obliged to humour\r\nthat national feeling, and to follow, as far as the difference of\r\ncircumstances will allow, the policy of his Uncle. They consider the\r\nprinciple of nationalities to be the deciding principle of the day,\r\nand accordingly Venetia ought to belong to Italy, Poland ought to\r\nbe severed from Russia, and Finland ought to be restored to Sweden.\r\nHolstein should be purely German with its own Duke, Schleswig should\r\nbe united to Denmark, and when the proper time comes, Denmark, so\r\nconstituted, ought to form one Monarchy with Sweden and Norway. But\r\nthey see that there are great if not insuperable obstacles to all\r\nthese arrangements, and they do not admit that the Emperor of the\r\nFrench talked to them about these things, or about the map of Europe\r\nrevised for 1860. They lamented the dangerous state of the Austrian\r\nEmpire by reason of its financial embarrassments, and its differences\r\nbetween Vienna and Hungary. They admitted the difficulty of\r\nre-establishing a Polish State, seeing that Russia, Prussia, and\r\nAustria are all interested in preventing it; but they thought that\r\nRussia might make herself amends to the Eastward for giving up part of\r\nher Polish possessions.\r\n\r\nThey said the Swedes would be more adverse than the Danes to a Union\r\nof Denmark with Sweden. They said the Finns are writhing under the\r\nRussian yoke, and emigrate in considerable numbers to Sweden. They\r\nthink Russia paralysed for ten years to come by her war against\r\nEngland and France, by her internal changes, and her money\r\nembarrassments. When the Prince asked Viscount Palmerston to sit down,\r\nit was for the purpose of urging in the strongest and most earnest\r\nmanner that some British ships of war, or even one single gunboat, if\r\nmore could not be spared, should every year visit the Baltic, and make\r\na cruise in that sea. He said that the British Flag was never seen\r\nthere, although Great Britain has great interests, commercial and\r\npolitical, in that sea. That especially for Sweden it would be a great\r\nsupport if a British man-of-war were every year to show itself in\r\nSwedish waters. He said that our Navy know little or nothing of the\r\nBaltic, and when a war comes, as happened in the late war with Russia,\r\nour ships are obliged, as it were, to feel their way about in the\r\ndark; that the Russians send ships of war into British ports--why\r\nshould not England send ships of war into Russian ports? That we\r\nsurvey seas at the other side of the Globe, why should we not survey\r\na sea so near to us as the Baltic; that as far as Sweden is concerned,\r\nBritish ships would be most cordially received. I said that this\r\nshould receive due consideration; and in answer to a question he said\r\nthe best time for a Baltic cruise would be from the middle of June to\r\nthe latter end of August.\r\n\r\nThey both thought the Emperor of the French extremely popular in\r\nFrance--but, of course, they only saw outward demonstrations. They\r\nare very anxious for the maintenance of the Anglo-French Alliance;\r\nand they think the Emperor obliged to keep a large Army and to build a\r\nstrong Navy in order to please and satisfy the French Nation. Such\r\nis the summary of the impression made upon Viscount Palmerston by the\r\nanswers and observations drawn out by him in his conversations with\r\nthe King and the Prince; most of these things were said as above\r\nreported, some few of the above statements are perhaps inferences and\r\nconclusions drawn from indirect answers and remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: SWEDEN AND DENMARK]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FRANCE AND SWEDEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _18th August 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is very much obliged to Lord Palmerston for his detailed\r\naccount of his conversation with the King of Sweden, and sends\r\nboth Memorandums back to him in accordance with his wishes, in the\r\nexpectation of having them returned to her after they shall have been\r\ncopied.\r\n\r\nThe King may have been embarrassed by the presence of the Crown\r\nPrince of Prussia here at Osborne, and have on that account postponed\r\nspeaking openly to Lord Palmerston. His desire to acquire Denmark and\r\nFinland is not unnatural, and would not be very dangerous; but\r\nthe important part of the matter is, that the Emperor Napoleon has\r\nevidently tried to bribe him for his schemes by such expectations.\r\nAfter having established a large kingdom, dependent upon him and\r\npossessing a fleet, in the South of Europe on his right flank, he\r\nevidently tries to establish by the same means a similar power on his\r\nleft flank in the North. If then the Revolution of Poland and Hungary\r\ntakes Germany also in the rear, he will be exactly in the all-powerful\r\nposition which his Uncle held, and at which he himself aims, with that\r\none difference: that, unlike his Uncle, who had to fight England all\r\nthe time (who defended desperately her interests in Europe), he tries\r\nto effect his purposes in alliance with England, and uses for this end\r\nour own _free_ Press and in our own free country!\r\n\r\nThe Polish and Hungarian Revolutions (perhaps the Russian) and the\r\nassistance which may be (nobly?) given to them by Sweden, can easily\r\nbe made as popular in this country as the Italian has, and efforts\r\nto produce this result are fully visible already. The position and\r\nprospects of the Ally, when the Emperor shall have the whole Continent\r\nat his feet, and the command of the Mediterranean and the Baltic,\r\nwill not be a very pleasant one. Moreover, the Ally will probably have\r\nirritated him and the French Nation all the time by abusing them, and\r\nby showing that, although we may have approved of her policy, we did\r\nnot intend that France should reap any benefits from it. All this is\r\nprobably not thought of by our journalists, but requires the serious\r\nattention of our statesmen.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston will perhaps show this letter to Lord Russell when he\r\nsends him the copies of the Memoranda, which he will probably do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: FROGMORE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _20th August 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--Before I thank you for your dear letter of the\r\n14th, or at least before I answer it, I wish to tell you _how soothed_\r\nI was by that visit to that _lovely_ peaceful _Mausoleum at Frogmore_.\r\n\r\nWe parted from our dear children and grandchildren with heavy hearts\r\nat seven on the morning of the 16th, for their visit, excepting the\r\n_blank_ which clouds over everything, has been most peaceful and\r\nsatisfactory, and we have learnt to know and most highly\r\nappreciate the great _excellence_ of dear Fritz's character; noble,\r\nhigh-principled, so anxious to do what is right, and to improve\r\nin every way, and so sweet-tempered and affectionate--so, beyond\r\neverything, devoted to Vicky.\r\n\r\nI thought much of poor, dear Aunt Julia on the 15th; _that loss_ was\r\nthe _signal_ for my irreparable one!\r\n\r\nWe went that afternoon (16th) to Frogmore, where we slept. The first\r\nevening was terribly trying, and I must say quite overpowered me for a\r\nshort time; _all_ looked _like life_, and yet _she_ was not there! But\r\nI got calmer; the very fact of being surrounded by all she liked, and\r\nof seeing the dear pretty house inhabited again, was a satisfaction,\r\nand the next morning was beautiful, and we went after breakfast\r\nwith wreaths up to the Mausoleum, and into the vault which is _à\r\nplain-pied_, and so pretty--so airy--_so_ grand and simple, that,\r\naffecting as it is, there was no anguish or bitterness of grief,\r\nbut calm repose! We placed the wreaths upon the splendid granite\r\nsarcophagus, and at its feet, and _felt_ that _only_ the _earthly\r\nrobe_ we loved so much was there. The pure, tender, loving spirit\r\n_which loved us_ so tenderly, is above us--loving us, praying for us,\r\nand _free_ from _all_ suffering and woe--_yes_, that _is_ a _comfort_,\r\nand that _first birthday_ in _another_ world must have been a _far_\r\nbrighter one than _any_ in this poor world below! I only grieve _now_\r\nthat we should be going so far away from Frogmore, as I long to go\r\nthere; only Alice and dear Augusta Bruce[31](who feels as a daughter\r\nof hers) went with us. The morning was so beautiful, and the garden\r\n_so_ lovely!...\r\n\r\nThe news from Austria are very sad, and make one very anxious. The\r\nKing of Sweden is full of wild notions put into his head by the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, for whom he has the greatest admiration!...\r\n\r\nIt is high time I should end my long letter. With Albert's\r\naffectionate love, ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: Lady Augusta Bruce, who bad been living with the\r\n    Duchess of Kent at the time of her death, was appointed by the\r\n    Queen to be her resident Bedchamber Woman.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: VISIT TO IRELAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nVICE-REGAL LODGE, PHOENIX PARK, _26th August 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--_Not_ to miss your messenger I write a few hurried\r\nlines to thank you for your two dear letters of the 16th and the 22nd,\r\nthe last of which I received yesterday morning here.... Would to God\r\nthat affairs in Hungary took a favourable turn--_mais j'en ai bien\r\npeur_. We had a very good passage on Wednesday night, since which it\r\nhas blown very hard. We left Osborne on Wednesday morning (21st) at\r\nquarter to nine, and anchored in Kingstown Bay at half-past eleven\r\nthat night. The next day (22nd) we landed at eleven and came here,\r\nand it rained the whole day. On Saturday we all went over to the camp,\r\nwhere there was a field-day. It is a fine _emplacement_ with beautiful\r\nturf. We had two cooling showers. Bertie marched past with his\r\ncompany, and did not look at all so very small.\r\n\r\nYesterday was again a very bad day. I have felt weak and very nervous,\r\nand so low at times; I think _so_ much of dearest mamma, and miss her\r\nlove and interest and solicitude _dreadfully_; I feel as if we were no\r\nlonger cared for, and miss writing to her and telling her everything,\r\ndreadfully. At the Review they played one of her marches, which\r\nentirely upset me.\r\n\r\nGood Lord Carlisle[32] is most kind and amiable, and so much beloved.\r\nWe start for Killarney at half-past twelve.

I am so happy to see all the\r\ngood which your stay in the Highlands has done you, and I am sure it\r\nwill be _lasting_, though Windsor must have the effect of reviving\r\nstrongly some feelings.... When one looks back on those times, one\r\nmust say that they were full of difficulties, and one ought to feel\r\nvery grateful that such a happy present has grown out of them. I\r\nregret much Paris and Robert[34] having joined the Federal Army,\r\nmixing in a civil war!! The object is to show courage, to be able to\r\nsay: \"_Ils se sont beaucoup distingués_.\" They have a chance of being\r\nshot for Abraham Lincoln and the most rank Radicalism. I don't think\r\nthat step will please in France, where Radicalism is at discount\r\nfortunately. The poor Queen is very unhappy about it, but now nothing\r\ncan be done, only one may wish to see them well out of it. Poor Queen!\r\nconstantly new events painful to her assail her. I had rather a kind\r\nletter from the Emperor Napoleon about the state of Mexico. I fear he\r\nwill find his wishes to see there a stable Government not much liked\r\nin England, though his plans are _not_ for any advantage France is to\r\nderive from it. To-morrow we go to Liège to be in readiness for the\r\nfollowing day. The King William III.[35] will arrive for dinner, stay\r\nthe night, and go very early on Sunday. He will be extremely well\r\nreceived here, his _procédé_ being duly appreciated. To be very\r\ncivilly received in a country which one was heir to, is rather _un\r\npeu pénible_, and one feels a little awkward....

October 1861_].\r\n\r\nMADAM,--Though your Majesty has only very lately seen the Princess\r\nRoyal, I cannot refrain from addressing your Majesty, as I am sure\r\nyour Majesty will be pleased to hear how well Her Royal Highness was\r\nlooking during the Man[oe]uvres on the Rhine, and how much she seems\r\nto be beloved, not only by all those who know her, but also by those\r\nwho have only seen and heard of her. The English could not help\r\nfeeling proud of the way the Princess Royal was spoken of, and the\r\nhigh esteem she is held in. For one so young it is a most flattering\r\nposition, and certainly as the Princess's charm of manner and her kind\r\nunaffected words had in that short time won her the hearts of all the\r\nofficers and strangers present, one was not astonished at the praise\r\nthe Prussians themselves bestow on Her Royal Highness. The Royal\r\nFamily is so large, and their opinions politically and socially\r\nsometimes so different, that it must have been very difficult indeed\r\nat first for the Princess Royal, and people therefore cannot praise\r\nenough the high principles, great discretion, sound judgment, and\r\ncleverness Her Royal Highness has invariably displayed.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty would have been amused to hear General Wrangel[37] tell\r\nat the top of his voice how delighted the soldiers were to see the\r\nPrincess on horseback, and the interest she showed for them. What\r\npleased them specially was to see Her Royal Highness ride without a\r\nveil--such an odd thing in soldiers to remark. The King of Prussia\r\nis looking very well, but the Queen I thought very much altered. Her\r\nMajesty looks very pale and tired, and has such a painful drawn look\r\nabout the mouth. How the Queen will be able to go through all the\r\nfatigues of the Coronation I do not know, as Her Majesty already\r\ncomplained of being tired, and knocked up by the man[oe]vres and\r\ndinners, and had to go to Mentz for a few days to rest herself.\r\nTheir Majesties' kindness was very great, and the Duke told me of the\r\nextreme hospitality with which they were entertained. Every one,\r\nhigh and low, were rivalling each other in civility and friendliness\r\ntowards the strangers, especially the English, and one really felt\r\nquite ashamed of those wanton attacks the _Times_ always makes on\r\nPrussia, and which are read and copied into all the Prussian papers.\r\nThe last night all the officers dined together. General Forey put\r\nhimself into the President's place and insisted, to the exclusion of\r\nLord Clyde, who was by far the senior officer, and who was expected\r\nto do it, on proposing the health of the King, the Royal Family, the\r\nArmy, and Nation. Not content with doing it in French, he drew out of\r\nhis pocket a document written for him in German, for he did not know\r\nthe language, and read it with the most extraordinary pronunciation.\r\nThe English officers all admired the way the Germans kept their\r\ncountenance notwithstanding the absurdity of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st they have had great doings here at Hanover. I hear that to\r\nthe astonishment of everybody the Queen appeared at the _Enthüllung_,\r\nwhere all other people were _en grande tenue_, in a little small round\r\nhat with a lilac feather. Her Maids of Honour--she has only one now\r\nbesides that English Miss Stewart--were ordered to wear hats to keep\r\nHer Majesty in countenance. I wonder if your Majesty has read the\r\nspeech the King has addressed to his people on the occasion of the\r\n_Enthüllung_ and the Crown Prince's birthday. It cannot fail to excite\r\nthe greatest pity that such things, however well meant, should be\r\nwritten. Has your Majesty also heard of the pamphlet that has been\r\npublished here called _Das Welfe_--that name Welfe is quite an _idée\r\nfixe_ of the King now, and he brings it in on every occasion, and\r\nthis pamphlet is written throwing the whole idea into ridicule, and\r\nbeginning with the last years of the late King's reign. The Crown\r\nPrince[38] is very much liked, but, unfortunately, his new tutor will\r\nprobably also leave very shortly--he has no authority over him, the\r\nPrince still regretting M. de Issendorf. Besides, he is not allowed\r\nto exercise his judgment in the smallest way--the King going on the\r\nprinciple that a King only can educate a King. The reason the\r\nother tutor left, or was dismissed, was partly on account of his\r\nremonstrating against the religious instructions, which were carried\r\nso far that the Prince had hardly any time left to learn other\r\nthings. Besides the Prince, who dislikes the clergyman, had drawn a\r\ncaricature, to which the man very much gives himself, and the King\r\nthought M. de Issendorf had known of it, which turned out not to be\r\nthe case.... I have the honour to remain, your Majesty's most obedient\r\nand devoted Servant and Subject,\r\n\r\nLOUISE MANCHESTER.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: Louise Frederica Augusta, wife of the seventh\r\n    Duke of Manchester, and Mistress of the Robes.

I have got\r\nsuch a very bad cold on my chest, with a cough that leaves me no rest,\r\nand of course cannot take care of myself, and am obliged to stand and\r\nsit in every sort of draught with a low gown and without a cloak, so\r\nit is no wonder to have caught cold. I have not had a cough since\r\nI don't know when. I should like to be able to describe yesterday's\r\nceremony to you, but I cannot find words to tell you how fine and how\r\ntouching it was; it really was a magnificent sight! The King looked so\r\nvery handsome and so noble with the crown on; it seemed to suit him so\r\nexactly. The Queen, too, looked beautiful, and did all she had to do\r\nwith perfect grace, and looked so _vornehm_; I assure you the whole\r\nmust have made a great impression on everybody present, and all those\r\nto whom I have talked on the subject quite share my feeling. The\r\nmoment when the King put the crown on the Queen's head was very\r\ntouching, I think there was hardly a dry eye in the church. The\r\n_Schlosshof_ was the finest, I thought--five bands playing \"God save\r\nthe Queen,\" banners waving in all directions, cheers so loud that they\r\nquite drowned the sound of the music, and the procession moving slowly\r\non, the sky without a cloud; and all the uniforms, and the ladies'\r\ndiamonds glittering in the bright sunlight. I shall never forget it\r\nall, it was so very fine! Dearest Fritz's birthday being chosen for\r\nthe day made me very happy; he was in a great state of emotion and\r\nexcitement, as you can imagine, as we all were. Mr Thomas[39] was in\r\nthe chapel. I hope he will have been able to take down some useful\r\nmemoranda. The Grand Duke of Weimar,[40] the King and ourselves, have\r\nordered drawings of him.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'[oe]il_ was really beautiful; the chapel is in itself\r\nlovely, with a great deal of gold about it, and all hung with red\r\nvelvet and gold--the carpet, altar, thrones and canopies the same. The\r\nKnights of the Black Eagle with red velvet cloaks, the Queen's four\r\nyoung ladies all alike in white and gold, the two Palastdamen in\r\ncrimson velvet and gold, and the Oberhofmeisterin in gold and white\r\nbrocade with green velvet, Marianne and Addy in red and gold and red\r\nand silver; I, in gold with ermine and white satin, my ladies, one\r\nin blue velvet, the other in red velvet, and Countess Schulenberg,\r\ntogether with the two other Oberhofmeisterin of the other Princesses,\r\nin violet velvet and gold. All these colours together looked very\r\nbeautiful, and the sun shone, or rather poured in at the high windows,\r\nand gave quite magic tinges.\r\n\r\nThe music was very fine, the chorales were sung so loud and strong\r\nthat it really quite moved one. The King was immensely cheered,\r\nwherever he appeared--also the Queen, and even I.\r\n\r\nThere were illuminations last night, but I did not go to see them,\r\nas I was too tired and felt so unwell. There are five degrees of cold\r\n(Réaumur), and one is exposed to draughts every minute.\r\n\r\nSixteen hundred people dined in the Schloss last night! The King and\r\nQueen were most kind to me yesterday; the King gave me a charming\r\nlittle locket for his hair, and only think--what will sound most\r\nextraordinary, absurd, and incredible to your ears--made me Second\r\n_Chef_ of the 2nd Regiment of Hussars! I laughed so much, because\r\nreally I thought it was a joke--it seemed so strange for ladies; but\r\nthe Regiments like particularly having ladies for their _Chefs!_ The\r\nQueen and the Queen Dowager have Regiments, but I believe I am the\r\nfirst Princess on whom such an honour is conferred.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke addressed the King yesterday, in the name of all the\r\nforeign Princes present, in a very pretty speech.\r\n\r\nIt is such a pleasure to see good Philip here, and the two Portuguese\r\ncousins. Juan[41] is very nice, but he does not talk much; he has a\r\nvery fine, tall figure, and is nice-looking. I should think he must\r\nbe like his father. Prince Hohenzollern [42] is become Royal Highness,\r\nand the title is to descend to his eldest son. Half Europe is here,\r\nand one sees the funniest combinations in the world. It is like\r\na happy family shut up in a cage! The Italian Ambassador sat near\r\nCardinal Geisel, and the French one opposite the Archduke. The\r\nGrand Duke Nicolas is here--he is so nice--also the Crown Prince\r\nof Würtemberg,[43] Crown Prince of Saxony,[44] Prince Luitpold of\r\nBavaria,[45] Prince Charles of Hesse[46] (who nearly dies of fright\r\nand shyness amongst so many people), and Heinrich; Prince Elimar of\r\nOldenburg,[47] Prince Frederic of the Netherlands,[48] and the\r\nGrand Duke and Duchess of Weimar, who wish to be most particularly\r\nremembered to you and Papa.\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen are most kind to Lord Clarendon, and make a marked\r\ndifference between their marked cordiality to him and the stiff\r\netiquette with which the other Ambassadors are received.\r\n\r\nI think he is pleased with what he sees. The King has given the Queen\r\nthe Order of the Black Eagle in diamonds. I write all these details,\r\nas you wish them, at the risk of their not interesting you, besides\r\nmy being, as you know, a very bad hand at descriptions. I shall make a\r\npoint of your having newspapers.\r\n\r\nI am unable to appear at the _cour_ this morning, as my cough is too\r\nviolent: I hope to be able to be at the concert this evening, but I\r\nown it seems very doubtful. The state dinner looked very well; we were\r\nwaited on by our _Kammerherren_ and pages--the King being waited on\r\nby the _Oberhofchargen_--and our ladies stood behind our chairs. After\r\nthe first two dishes are round, the King asks to drink, and that is\r\nthe signal for the ladies and gentlemen to leave the room and go to\r\ndinner, while the Pages of Honour continue to serve the whole dinner\r\nreally wonderfully well, poor boys, considering it is no easy task.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow we leave Königsberg for Dantzic--we have not had one day's\r\nbad weather here, nothing but sunshine and a bright blue sky. I was so\r\nglad that Heaven smiled upon us yesterday, it would have been so sad\r\nif it had poured; it looked a little threatening early in the morning\r\nand a few drops fell, but it cleared completely before nine o'clock.\r\n\r\nFritz would thank you for your dear letters himself, but he is at the\r\nUniversity, where they have elected him _Rector Magnificus_, and where\r\nhe has to make a speech. We have all got our servants and carriages\r\nand horses here _every_ day--300 footmen in livery, together with\r\nother servants in livery, make 400. All the standards and colours of\r\nthe whole Army are here, and all the Colonels. Altogether, you cannot\r\nimagine what a crush and what a scramble there is on every occasion;\r\nthere was a man crushed to death in the crowd the other day, which\r\nis quite dreadful. I must say good-bye now, and send this scrawl by\r\na messenger, whom Lord Clarendon means to expedite. Ever your most\r\ndutiful and affectionate Daughter,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: George Housman Thomas, artist (1824-1868).

Lord Clarendon is at\r\na loss for words to describe to your Majesty the exquisite grace and\r\nthe intense emotion with which Her Royal Highness gave effect to her\r\nfeelings on the occasion. Many an older as well as younger man than\r\nLord Clarendon, who had not his interest in the Princess Royal, were\r\nquite as unable as himself to repress their emotion at that which was\r\nso touching, because so unaffected and sincere....\r\n\r\nIf His Majesty had the mind, the judgment, and the foresight of the\r\nPrincess Royal, there would be nothing to fear, and the example\r\nand influence of Prussia would soon be marvellously developed. Lord\r\nClarendon has had the honour to hold a very long conversation with\r\nHer Royal Highness, and has been more than ever astonished at the\r\n_statesmanlike_ and comprehensive views which she takes of the policy\r\nof Prussia, both internal and foreign, and of the _duties_ of a\r\nConstitutional King.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon is not at all astonished, but very much pleased, to\r\nfind how appreciated and beloved Her Royal Highness is by all classes.\r\nEvery member of the Royal Family has spoken of her to Lord Clarendon\r\nin terms of admiration, and through various channels he has had\r\nopportunities of learning how strong the feeling of educated and\r\nenlightened people is towards Her Royal Highness. All persons say\r\nmost truly that any one who saw Her Royal Highness yesterday can never\r\nforget her.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon is sorry to say that the Princess Royal has a feverish\r\ncold to-day--nothing at all serious--and as Her Royal Highness stayed\r\nin bed this afternoon, did not attend the great concert at the Palace\r\nthis evening, and, as Lord Clarendon hopes, will not go to Dantzic\r\nto-morrow, Her Royal Highness will probably be quite fit for the many\r\nfatiguing duties she will have to perform next week....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON'S AIMS]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AUSTRIA AND PRUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBERLIN, _20th October 1861_.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and humbly\r\nbegs to say that yesterday he had the honour of being sent for by the\r\nQueen, with whom he had a long and interesting conversation....\r\n\r\nThe Queen expressed her deep regret at the tone of the English\r\nnewspapers, but admitted that the German Press repaid the English\r\ninsults with large interest. Her Majesty said, however, that she\r\nand the King, and all sensible men with whom their Majesties hold\r\ncommunication, were determined to disregard the attacks, and by every\r\npossible means to draw nearer to England.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon took the opportunity of warning the Queen respecting\r\nthe Emperor and his _idée fixe_, that his dynasty could only be\r\nsecured by the territorial aggrandisement of France. Lord Clarendon\r\nexpressed his conviction that if the King had resembled M. de Cavour,\r\nsome strong proposals would already have been made to them, but that\r\nthe Emperor's plans had been foiled by the honourable character of the\r\nKing. There ought, nevertheless, to be no delusion here, but on the\r\ncontrary, a careful avoidance of the traps which cajolery and flattery\r\nwere setting for Prussia, because at any moment the Emperor might\r\nthink it necessary for his own purposes in France to seize upon the\r\nleft bank of the Rhine, and that all classes in France, no matter\r\nto what party belonging, would be delighted at his so doing, and his\r\npopularity and power in France would be enormously increased by it.\r\nThe Queen agreed, but was under the notion, which Lord Clarendon\r\nwas able effectually to dispel, that the dilapidated state of French\r\nfinances would prevent the Emperor from undertaking a war upon a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon thinks that he strengthened the Queen's opinion\r\nrespecting \"eventualities\" and the necessity of making preparations\r\nand evoking a national spirit against foreign aggression, such as that\r\nrecently manifested in England, and which had done so much in favour\r\nof peace as far as we ourselves were concerned. Her Majesty, however,\r\nsaid that Prussian policy towards Germany opened so large a chapter\r\nthat she wished to reserve the discussion of it for our next\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon fears that Count Bernstorff is disposed to think that\r\nAustria's difficulty is Prussia's opportunity, and to be exigent as\r\nto the concessions upon which a better understanding between the two\r\ncountries must be based. Lord Clarendon was confidentially informed\r\nyesterday that a Cabinet had just been held for the first time since\r\nCount Bernstorff became a member of it, and that with respect to\r\ninternal affairs he had greatly alarmed and annoyed some of his\r\ncolleagues by his retrograde opinions. Lord Clarendon had the honour\r\nof dining with the Crown Prince and Princess last night. The dinner\r\nwas perfect, and everything conducted in the most admirable manner;\r\nthere was afterwards a ball at \"The Queen's\" which was really a\r\nsplendid fête. The festivities and the visitings are so uninterrupted\r\nthat everybody is unwell and tired. The Duc de Magenta's grand fête\r\ntakes place on the 29th. The Austrian Minister gives a ball to-morrow\r\n(_Sunday_), which day has unfortunately been fixed by the King, to the\r\nannoyance of all the English; but Lord Clarendon has determined that\r\nthe Embassy shall attend, otherwise the King might consider that we\r\nwished to give him a public lesson upon the observance of the Sabbath.\r\nLord Clarendon trusts that your Majesty will approve the decision.\r\nLord Granville's visit appears to be highly appreciated by the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nBALMORAL, _21st October 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST UNCLE,--You will excuse a long letter as this is our last\r\nday, alas!

That journal had since years shown the same bias, but it is\r\nsince the Macdonald affair of last year,[49] that it has assumed\r\nthat tone of virulence, which could not fail to produce the deepest\r\nindignation amongst the people of Germany, and by degrees estrange the\r\nfeelings of the people of this country from Germany. Lord Palmerston,\r\nprobably not reading any German newspaper, nor having any personal\r\nintercourse with that country, can hardly be aware to what extent the\r\nmischief has already gone, though he will agree with the Queen that\r\nnational hatred between these two peoples is a real political calamity\r\nfor both. The Queen had often intended to write to Lord Palmerston\r\non the subject, and to ask him whether he would not be acting in the\r\nspirit of public duty if he endeavoured, as far at least as might\r\nbe in his power, to point out to the managers of the _Times_ (which\r\nderives some of its power from the belief abroad that it represents\r\nmore or less the feelings of the Government) how great the injury is\r\nwhich it inflicts upon the best interests of this country. She has,\r\nhowever, refrained from doing so, trusting in the chance of a change\r\nin tone, and feeling that Lord Palmerston might not like to enter into\r\ndiscussion with the Editors of the _Times_....\r\n\r\nThe Queen believes that Lord Palmerston is the only person who could\r\nexercise any influence over Mr Delane, and even if this should not\r\nbe much, it will be important that that gentleman should know the\r\nmischief his writings are doing, and that the Government sincerely\r\ndeplore it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: At Bonn, in September 1860, Captain Macdonald, a\r\n    railway passenger, had been ejected from his seat in the\r\n    train by the railway authorities, and committed to prison.\r\n    The incident became the subject of considerable diplomatic\r\n    correspondence, as well as of some fierce attacks on Prussia\r\n    in the _Times_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE ENGLISH PRESS]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Delane to Viscount Palmerston._[50]\r\n\r\n16 SERJEANT'S INN, _28th October 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LORD,--I shall be very glad to give the Prussians a respite\r\nfrom that most cruel of all inflictions--good advice.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I would not have intruded anything so unwelcome during the\r\nsplendid solemnities of the Coronation had not the King uttered those\r\nsurprising anachronisms upon Divine Right.\r\n\r\nPray observe, too, in extenuation of my offence that I sent a faithful\r\nchronicler to Königsberg, who has described all the splendours in a\r\nproper and reverent spirit, and done what man can do to render such\r\nceremonies intelligible, and the recital of them not too wearisome to\r\nthose who believe in Divine Right as little as your Lordship's very\r\nfaithful Servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN T. DELANE.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: Enclosed in the following letter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: THE _TIMES_]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _30th October 1861_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that when he received a few days ago from Lord Russell the\r\nMemorandum which your Majesty intended for him, and which he returned\r\nto Lord Russell, he wrote to Mr Delane in accordance with your\r\nMajesty's wishes, and he has this morning received the accompanying\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston would, however, beg to submit that an erroneous\r\nnotion prevails on the Continent as to English newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers on the Continent are all more or less under a certain\r\ndegree of control, and the most prominent among them are the organs of\r\npolitical parties, or of leading public men; and it is not unnatural\r\nthat Governments and Parties on the Continent should think that\r\nEnglish newspapers are published under similar conditions.\r\n\r\nBut in this country all thriving newspapers are commercial\r\nundertakings, and are conducted on commercial principles, and none\r\nothers are able long to maintain an existence. Attempts have often\r\nbeen made to establish newspapers to be directed by political men,\r\nand to be guided by the same considerations by which those men would\r\ngovern their own conduct, but such papers have seldom succeeded.\r\nThe Peelite Party tried some years ago such an experiment with the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_, but after spending a very large sum of money\r\non the undertaking they were obliged to give it up. The _Times_ is\r\ncarried on as a large commercial enterprise, though, of course, with\r\ncertain political tendencies and bias, but mainly with a view to\r\nprofit upon the large capital employed.\r\n\r\nThe actual price at which each copy of the newspaper is sold barely\r\npays the expense of paper, printing, and establishment; it is indeed\r\nsaid that the price does not repay those expenses. The profit of\r\nthe newspaper arises from the price paid for advertisements, and\r\nthe greater the number of advertisements the greater the profit. But\r\nadvertisements are sent by preference to the newspaper which has the\r\ngreatest circulation; and that paper gets the widest circulation which\r\nis the most amusing, the most interesting, and the most instructive.\r\nA dull paper is soon left off. The proprietors and managers of the\r\n_Times_ therefore go to great expense in sending correspondents to all\r\nparts of the world where interesting events are taking place, and they\r\nemploy a great many able and clever men to write articles upon all\r\nsubjects which from time to time engage public attention; and as\r\nmankind take more pleasure in reading criticism and fault-finding than\r\npraise, because it is soothing to individual vanity and conceit to\r\nfancy that the reader has become wiser than those about whom he reads,\r\nso the _Times_, in order to maintain its circulation, criticises\r\nfreely everybody and everything; and especially events and persons,\r\nand Governments abroad, because such strictures are less likely to\r\nmake enemies at home than violent attacks upon parties and persons in\r\nthis country. Foreign Governments and Parties ought therefore to look\r\nupon English newspapers in the true point of view, and not to be too\r\nsensitive as to attacks which those papers may contain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEMOCRACY IN PRUSSIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Earl of Clarendon to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nBERLIN, _5th November 1861_.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and humbly\r\nbegs to say that as he leaves Berlin to-morrow, the Princess Royal has\r\nmost kindly just given him an Audience of leave, although Her Royal\r\nHighness was still suffering considerable pain in her ear, and was\r\nquite unfit for any exertion. Her Royal Highness's countenance bears\r\ntraces of the severe illness of the last few days, but Lord Clarendon\r\ntrusts that the worst is now over, and that care alone is necessary\r\nfor her complete recovery. Her Royal Highness is still so weak that\r\nshe was obliged to desist from writing, which she attempted this\r\nmorning, and Lord Clarendon took the liberty of earnestly recommending\r\nthat the journey to Breslau, upon which Her Royal Highness appeared to\r\nbe bent, should be given up. Lord Clarendon intends to repeat the same\r\nadvice to the Queen, whom he is to see this evening, as there are to\r\nbe four days of rejoicings at Breslau, for the fatigue of which the\r\nCrown Princess must be utterly unfit.\r\n\r\nHer Royal Highness is much alarmed at the state of things here, and\r\nLord Clarendon thinks with great reason, for the King has quite made\r\nup his mind as to the course that he will pursue. He sees democracy\r\nand revolution in every symptom of opposition to his will. His\r\nMinisters are mere clerks, who are quite content to register the\r\nKing's decrees, and there is no person from whom His Majesty seeks\r\nadvice, or indeed who is capable or would have the moral courage to\r\ngive it. The King will always religiously keep his word, and will\r\nnever overturn the institutions he has sworn to maintain, but they\r\nare so distasteful to him, and so much at variance with his habit of\r\nthought and settled opinions as to the rights of the Crown, that His\r\nMajesty will never, if he can avoid it, accept the consequences\r\nof representative Government, or allow it to be a reality. This is\r\ngenerally known, and among the middle classes is producing an uneasy\r\nand resentful feeling, but as far as Lord Clarendon is able to judge,\r\nthere is no fear of revolution--the Army is too strong, and the\r\nrecollection of 1848 is too fresh to allow of acts of violence.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon had the honour of an Audience of the King on Sunday.\r\nHis Majesty was most friendly and kind, but evidently unwell and\r\nirritable. Lord Clarendon therefore thought that it would be neither\r\nprudent nor useful to say the many things that the Queen had wished\r\nthat the King should hear from Lord Clarendon. He touched upon the\r\nsubject of Constitutional Government, and His Majesty said: \"I have\r\nsworn to maintain our Institutions, and I declare to you, and I wish\r\nyou to inform your Government, that I will maintain them.\"\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon proposes to remain Friday at Brussels, and hopes to\r\nhave the honour of seeing the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF KING OF PORTUGAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _12th November 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--I hardly know _how_ to _write_, for my head reels\r\nand swims, and my heart is very sore![51] _What_ an awful misfortune\r\nthis is!

Viscount Palmerston met yesterday at dinner at Baron Brunnow's\r\nthe Grand Duke Constantine and the Grand Duchess, and they were\r\noverflowing with thankfulness for the kind and gracious reception they\r\nhad met with at Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\nThere was reason to suspect that an American federal steamer of war of\r\neight guns, which had lately arrived at Falmouth, and from thence at\r\nSouthampton, was intended to intercept the Mail Packet coming home\r\nwith the West Indian Mail, in order to take out of her Messrs Mason\r\nand Slidell, the two Envoys from the Southern Confederacy, supposed to\r\nbe coming in her.[53]\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston had on Monday a meeting at the Treasury of the\r\nChancellor, Doctor Lushington, the three Law Officers,[54] the Duke\r\nof Somerset, Sir George Grey, and Mr Hammond.[55] The result of their\r\ndeliberation was that, according to the Law of Nations, as laid down\r\nby Lord Stowell, and practised and enforced by England in the war\r\nwith France, the Northern Union being a belligerent is entitled by its\r\nships of war to stop and search any neutral Merchantmen, and the West\r\nIndia Packet is such; to search her if there is reasonable suspicion\r\nthat she is carrying enemy's despatches, and if such are found on\r\nboard to take her to a port of the belligerent, and there to proceed\r\nagainst her for condemnation. Such being ruled to be the law, the only\r\nthing that could be done was to order the _Phaeton_ frigate to drop\r\ndown to Yarmouth Roads from Portsmouth, and to watch the American\r\nsteamer, and to see that she did not exercise this belligerent right\r\nwithin the three-mile limit of British jurisdiction, and this was\r\ndone. But Viscount Palmerston sent yesterday for Mr Adams to ask him\r\nabout this matter, and to represent to him how unwise it would be to\r\ncreate irritation in this country merely for the sake of preventing\r\nthe landing of Mr Slidell, whose presence here would have no more\r\neffect on the policy of your Majesty with regard to America than the\r\npresence of the three other Southern Deputies who have been here for\r\nmany months. Mr Adams assured Viscount Palmerston that the American\r\nsteamer had orders not to meddle with any vessel under any foreign\r\nflag; that it came to intercept the _Nashville_, the Confederate ship\r\nin which it was thought the Southern Envoys might be coming; and not\r\nhaving met with her was going back to the American coast to watch some\r\nMerchantmen supposed to be taking arms to the Southern ports.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston heard from a source likely to be well informed\r\nthat at the interview between the Emperor and the King of Prussia\r\nat Compiègne, the Emperor, among other things, said to the King that\r\nthere were three systems of alliance between which France and Prussia\r\nmight choose: an alliance of France with England, an alliance of\r\nPrussia with England, an alliance of France with Prussia. The first\r\nthe Emperor said now to a certain degree exists, but is precarious and\r\nnot likely to last long, because England is too exacting; the second\r\nwould not be useful to Prussia, but might be dangerous, inasmuch as it\r\nwould look like hostility to France, and England would not be likely\r\nto back Prussia effectually if a rupture took place between Prussia\r\nand France. The last was the system best for Prussia, and was\r\ncalculated to promote her interests; at all events, the Emperor hoped\r\nthat if at any time there should be a rupture between France and\r\nEngland, Prussia would remain neutral. The King of Prussia said he was\r\nnot come to discuss matters of that kind with the Emperor, but only\r\nto pay him a visit of compliment. Your Majesty will be able to compare\r\nthis statement with the accounts your Majesty may have received of\r\nwhat passed at that visit....\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor[56] told the Cabinet as he was going away that he would\r\nsoon have to shut up the Court of Chancery in consequence of having\r\ndisposed of all the suits before it; and that in future the progress\r\nof a Chancery suit will be the emblem of rapidity, and not as formerly\r\nsynonymous with endless delay.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: See _ante_, Introductory Note to Chapter XXX.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: Sir William Atherton, Attorney-General, Sir\r\n    Roundell Palmer, Solicitor-General, and Dr Phillimore, Counsel\r\n    to the Admiralty.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign\r\n    Affairs, afterwards Lord Hammond.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: Lord Westbury.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _26th November 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--...

The day was very wet, and, though he\r\n    returned in the middle of the day to Windsor, the exertion\r\n    proved too severe for him; on the 24th he complained of\r\n    rheumatic pains, and of prolonged sleeplessness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: REDRESS DEMANDED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET, _29th November 1861_.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\r\nto state that the Cabinet at its meeting this afternoon resumed the\r\nconsideration of the forcible capture of the Southern Envoys from on\r\nboard the _Trent_ steamer upon which the law officers had yesterday\r\ngiven the opinion contained in the accompanying report. The law\r\nofficers and Doctor Phillimore, Counsel to the Admiralty, were in\r\nattendance. The result was that it appeared to the Cabinet that a\r\ngross outrage and violation of international law has been committed,\r\nand that your Majesty should be advised to demand reparation and\r\nredress. The Cabinet is to meet again to-morrow at two, by which time\r\nLord Russell will have prepared an instruction to Lord Lyons for the\r\nconsideration of the Cabinet, and for submission afterwards to your\r\nMajesty. The general outline and tenor which appeared to meet the\r\nopinions of the Cabinet would be, that the Washington Government\r\nshould be told that what has been done is a violation of international\r\nlaw, and of the rights of Great Britain, and that your Majesty's\r\nGovernment trust that the act will be disavowed and the prisoners set\r\nfree and restored to British Protection; and that Lord Lyons should\r\nbe instructed that if this demand is refused he should retire from the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Mrs and Miss Slidell, who are now in London, that the\r\nNorthern officer who came on board the _Trent_ said that they\r\nwere acting on their own responsibility without instructions from\r\nWashington; that very possibly their act might be disavowed and the\r\nprisoners set free on their arrival at Washington. But it was known\r\nthat the _San Jacinto_, though come from the African station, had\r\narrived from thence several weeks before, and had been at St Thomas,\r\nand had there received communications from New York; and it is also\r\nsaid that General Scott, who has recently arrived in France, has\r\nsaid to Americans in Paris that he has come not on an excursion of\r\npleasure, but on diplomatic business; that the seizure of these envoys\r\nwas discussed in Cabinet at Washington, he being present, and was\r\ndeliberately determined upon and ordered; that the Washington Cabinet\r\nfully foresaw it might lead to war with England; and that he was\r\ncommissioned to propose to France in that case to join the Northern\r\nStates in war against England, and to offer France in that case the\r\nrestoration of the French Province of Canada.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott will probably find himself much mistaken as to the\r\nsuccess of his overtures; for the French Government is more disposed\r\ntowards the South than the North, and is probably thinking more about\r\nCotton than about Canada....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: AN ULTIMATUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earl Russell to Queen Victoria._\r\n\r\nFOREIGN OFFICE, _29th November 1861_.\r\n\r\nLord Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty; Mr Gladstone\r\nhas undertaken to explain to your Majesty what has taken place at the\r\nCabinet to-day.\r\n\r\nLord Russell proposes to frame a draft for to-morrow's Cabinet of a\r\ndespatch to Lord Lyons, directing him to ask for the release of Messrs\r\nMason and Slidell and their two companions, and an apology.

Altogether, this nasty, feverish\r\nsort of influenza and deranged stomach is _on_ the mend, but it will\r\nbe slow and tedious, and though there has _not_ been one alarming\r\nsymptom, there has been such restlessness, such sleeplessness, and\r\nsuch (till to-day) _total_ refusal of all food, that it made one\r\n_very, very_ anxious, and I can't describe the _anxiety_ I have gone\r\nthrough! I feel to-day a good deal shaken, for for four nights I got\r\nonly two or three hours' sleep. We have, however, every reason to hope\r\nthe recovery, though it may be _somewhat_ tedious, will not be _very_\r\nslow. You shall hear again to-morrow. Ever your devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: HOPE NOT ABANDONED]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _9th December 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--I enclose you Clark's report, which I think you\r\nmay like to hear. Our beloved invalid goes on well--but it _must_ be\r\ntedious, and I need not tell you _what_ a trial it is to me. Every\r\nday, however, is bringing us nearer the end of this tiresome illness,\r\nwhich is much what I had at Ramsgate, only that I was much worse, and\r\nnot at first well attended to. You shall hear daily.\r\n\r\nYou will, I know, feel for me! The night was excellent; the first good\r\none he had.

Now we must be very patient,\r\nas an indisposition of this description at this time of the year is\r\ngenerally mending slowly. The great object must be to arrange all the\r\nlittle details exactly as the patient may wish them; that everything\r\nof that description may move very smoothly is highly beneficial.\r\nPatients are very different in their likings; to the great horror\r\nof angelic Louise, the moment I am ill I become almost invisible,\r\ndisliking to see anybody. Other people are fond of company, and wish\r\nto be surrounded. The medical advisors are, thank God! excellent, and\r\nClark knows Albert so well. Albert will wish you not to interrupt your\r\nusual airings; you want air, and to be deprived of it would do you\r\nharm. The temperature here at least has been extremely mild--this\r\nought to be favourable. I trust that every day will now show\r\nsome small improvement, and it will be very kind of you to let me\r\nfrequently know how dear Albert is going on. Believe me ever, my\r\nbeloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _11th December 1861_.\r\n\r\nDEAREST UNCLE,--I can report another good night, and _no_ loss of\r\nstrength, and continued satisfactory symptoms. But more we dare _not_\r\nexpect for some days; _not_ losing ground is a _gain, now_, of _every_\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt is very sad and trying for me, but I am well, and I think really\r\n_very_ courageous; for it is the first time that _I_ ever witnessed\r\nanything of this kind though _I_ suffered from the same at Ramsgate,\r\nand was much worse. The trial in every way is so very trying, for I\r\nhave lost my guide, my support, my all, _for a time_--as we can't\r\nask or tell him anything. Many thanks for your kind letter received\r\nyesterday. We have been and are reading Von Ense's book[59] to Albert;\r\nbut it is _not_ worth much. He likes very much being read to as\r\nit soothes him. W. Scott is also read to him. You shall hear again\r\nto-morrow, dearest Uncle, and, please God! each day will be more\r\ncheering.

He maintains his ground well--had another very good\r\nnight--takes plenty of nourishment, and shows surprising strength.\r\nI am constantly in and out of his room, but since the _first four\r\ndreadful_ nights, _last_ week, _before_ they had declared it to be\r\n_gastric fever_--I do not sit up with him at night as I could be of\r\nno use; and there is nothing to cause alarm. I go out twice a day\r\nfor about an hour. It is a very trying time, for a fever with its\r\ndespondency, weakness, and occasional and _invariable_ wandering, is\r\nmost painful to witness--but we have _never_ had _one unfavourable_\r\nsymptom; to-morrow, reckoning from the 22nd, when dear Albert first\r\nfell ill--after going on a wet day to look at some buildings--having\r\nlikewise been unusually depressed with worries of different kinds--is\r\nthe _end_ of the _third week_; we _may_ hope for improvement _after_\r\nthat, but the Doctors say they should _not_ be _at all disappointed\r\nif_ this did _not_ take place till the _end_ of the _fourth week_. I\r\ncannot sufficiently praise the skill, attention, and devotion of\r\nDr Jenner,[60] who is the _first fever_ Doctor in Europe, one may\r\nsay--and good old Clark is here every day; good Brown is also _most_\r\nuseful.... We have got Dr Watson[61] (who succeeded Dr Chambers[62])\r\nand Sir H. Holland[63] has also been here. But I have kept clear of\r\nthese two. Albert sleeps a good deal in the day. He is moved every day\r\ninto the next room on a sofa which is made up as a bed. He has only\r\n_kept_ his bed entirely since Monday. Many, many thanks for your dear,\r\nkind letter of the 11th. I knew how _you_ would _feel_ for and think\r\nof me. I am very wonderfully supported, and, excepting on three\r\noccasions, have borne up very well. I am sure Clark will tell you so.\r\nEver your most devoted Niece,\r\n\r\nVICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60: Dr (afterwards Sir) William Jenner, K.C.B.\r\n    (1815-1898), was at this time Physician-Extraordinary to the\r\n    Queen.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: Afterwards Sir Thomas Watson (1792-1882),\r\n    F.R.S.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: Dr. William Frederick Chambers (1786-1855) was\r\n    well known as a consulting physician.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63: Sir Henry Holland (1788-1873) was\r\n    Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen and the Prince Consort.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Grey to Sir Charles Wood._\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _13th December 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WOOD,--The Queen desires me to acknowledge the receipt of\r\nyour letter, and to say that she quite approves of the purport of your\r\ndespatch to the Governor-General, understanding it to be, not that\r\nthere is to be any reduction of the Artillery force which it had been\r\ndetermined to leave permanent in India as the proper establishment\r\nfor that country, but simply that some batteries which it had been\r\nresolved to bring home, at all events, are to return somewhat sooner\r\nthan had been intended, etc., etc., etc.,\r\n\r\nGREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: DEATH OF THE PRINCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _20th December 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY _OWN_ DEAREST, KINDEST _FATHER_,--For as such have I _ever_ loved\r\nyou! The poor fatherless baby of eight months is now the utterly\r\nbroken-hearted and crushed widow of forty-two!

But\r\noh! to be cut off in the prime of life--to see our pure, happy, quiet,\r\ndomestic life, which _alone_ enabled me to bear my _much_ disliked\r\nposition, CUT OFF at forty-two--when I _had_ hoped with such\r\ninstinctive certainty that God never _would_ part us, and would let\r\nus grow old together (though _he_ always talked of the shortness of\r\nlife)--is _too awful_, too cruel! And yet it _must_ be for _his_ good,\r\nhis happiness! His purity was too great, his aspiration _too high_ for\r\nthis poor, _miserable_ world! His great soul is _now only_ enjoying\r\n_that_ for which it _was_ worthy! And I will _not_ envy him--only pray\r\nthat _mine_ may be perfected by it and fit to be with him eternally,\r\nfor which blessed moment I earnestly long. Dearest, dearest Uncle,\r\n_how_ kind of you to come! It will be an unspeakable _comfort_, and\r\nyou _can do_ much to tell people to do what they ought to do.

Your Majesty\r\nwill have heard by the last mail of the heavy blow which has fallen\r\nupon Lord Canning. The kindness of your Majesty to Lady Canning has\r\nbeen so invariable and so great that he feels it to be right that\r\nyour Majesty should receive a sure account of her last illness with as\r\nlittle delay as possible.\r\n\r\nThe funeral is over. It took place quite privately at sunrise on the\r\n19th. There is no burial-place for the Governor-General or his family,\r\nand the cemeteries at Calcutta are odious in many ways: Lord Canning\r\nhas therefore set a portion of the garden at Barrackpore (fifteen\r\nmiles from Calcutta) apart for the purpose. It is a beautiful\r\nspot--looking upon that reach of the grand river which she was so\r\nfond of drawing--shaded from the glare of the sun by high trees--and\r\namongst the bright shrubs and flowers in which she had so much\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will be glad, but not surprised, to know of the deep\r\nrespect which has been paid to her memory, not only by the familiar\r\nmembers of the household and intimate friends, who refused to let any\r\nhired hands perform the last offices, but by the Civil and Military\r\nbodies, and by the community at large. The coffin was conveyed to\r\nBarrackpore by the Artillery, and was borne through the Garden by\r\nEnglish soldiers.\r\n\r\nLord Canning feels sure that your Majesty will not consider these\r\ndetails as an intrusion. He feels sure of your Majesty's kind\r\nsympathy. She loved your Majesty dearly, and Lord Canning is certain\r\nthat he is doing what would have been her wish in thus venturing to\r\nwrite to your Majesty. In the last connected conversation which he had\r\nwith her, just before the illness became really threatening, she said\r\nthat she must write again to the Queen, \"for I don't want her to think\r\nthat it was out of laziness that I was not at Allahabad.\" The fact is,\r\nthat she had always intended to be present at the Investiture, and had\r\nmade all her arrangements to go from Darjeeling to Allahabad for the\r\npurpose; but Lord Canning, hearing of the bad state of the roads,\r\nowing to the heavy and unseasonable rains, and knowing how fatiguing\r\nan additional journey of nearly 900 miles would be, had entreated her\r\nto abandon the intention, and to stay longer in the Hills, and then go\r\nstraight to Calcutta. Whether all might have gone differently if the\r\nfirst plan had been held to, God alone knows. His will has been done.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 65: Received on the 22nd of December, or\r\n    thereabouts.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: A NOBLE RESOLVE]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, _24th December 1861_.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED UNCLE,--Though, please God! I am to see you so soon, I must\r\nwrite these few lines to prepare you for the trying, sad existence you\r\nwill find it with your poor forlorn, desolate child--who drags on\r\na weary, pleasureless existence! I am also anxious to repeat _one_\r\nthing, and _that one_ is _my firm_ resolve, my _irrevocable decision_,\r\nviz. that _his_ wishes--_his_ plans--about everything, _his_ views\r\nabout _every_ thing are to be _my law!_ And _no human power_ will make\r\nme swerve from _what he_ decided and wished--and I look to _you_ to\r\n_support_ and _help_ me in this. I apply this particularly as regards\r\nour children--Bertie, etc.--for whose future he had traced everything\r\n_so_ carefully. I am _also determined_ that _no one_ person, may _he_\r\nbe ever so good, ever so devoted among my servants--is to lead or\r\nguide or dictate _to me_. I know _how he_ would disapprove it. And I\r\nlive _on_ with him, for him; in fact _I_ am only _outwardly_ separated\r\nfrom him, and _only_ for _a time_.\r\n\r\n_No one_ can tell you more of my feelings, and can put you more in\r\npossession of many touching facts than our excellent Dr Jenner, who\r\nhas been and is my great comfort, and whom I would _entreat_ you to\r\n_see and hear_ before you see _any one else_. Pray do this, for _I\r\nfear much_ others trying to see you first and say things and wish for\r\nthings which I _should not_ consent to.\r\n\r\nThough miserably weak and utterly shattered, my spirit rises when I\r\nthink _any_ wish or plan of his is to be touched or changed, or I\r\nam to be _made to do_ anything. I know you will help me in my utter\r\ndarkness. It is but for a short time, and _then_ I go--_never, never_\r\nto part! Oh! that blessed, blessed thought!

Viscount Palmerston would,\r\nhowever, humbly express a hope that the intensity of your Majesty's\r\ngrief may not lead your Majesty to neglect your health, the\r\npreservation of which is so important for the welfare of your\r\nMajesty's children, and for that of your Majesty's devotedly attached\r\nand affectionate subjects; and which is so essentially necessary\r\nto enable your Majesty to perform those duties which it will be the\r\nobject of your Majesty's life to fulfil.\r\n\r\nLord Granville has communicated to Viscount Palmerston your Majesty's\r\nwish that Mr Dilke[66] should be made a Baronet, and that Mr\r\nBowring[67] should be made a Companion of the Bath, and both of these\r\nthings will be done accordingly. But there are three other persons\r\nwhose names Viscount Palmerston has for some time wished to submit to\r\nyour Majesty for the dignity of Baronet, and if your Majesty should\r\nbe graciously pleased to approve of them, the list would stand as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nMr Dilke.\r\n\r\nMr William Brown,[68] of Liverpool, a very wealthy and\r\n  distinguished merchant, who lately made a magnificent\r\n  present of a public library to his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nMr Thomas Davies Lloyd, a rich and highly respectable\r\n  gentleman of the county of Carnarvon.\r\n\r\nMr Rich, to whom the Government is under great obligation,\r\n  for having of his own accord and without any condition\r\n  vacated last year his seat for Richmond in Yorkshire,\r\n  and having thus enabled the Government to obtain the\r\n  valuable services of Mr Roundell Palmer as your Majesty's\r\n  Solicitor-General.\r\n\r\nViscount Palmerston has put into this box some private letters which\r\nLord Russell thinks your Majesty might perhaps like to look at.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 66: Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke was on the Executive\r\n    Committee of the Exhibition of 1851, and on the Royal\r\n    Commission for the Exhibition of 1862.

In\r\nthe case of her adored, precious, perfect, and great husband, her dear\r\nlord and master, to whom this Nation owed more than it ever can truly\r\nknow, however, the fever went on most favourably till the day previous\r\nto the awful calamity, and then it was congestion of the lungs and\r\nwant of strength of circulation (the beloved Prince had always a weak\r\nand feeble pulse), which at the critical moment, indeed only two hours\r\nbefore God took him, caused this awful result. To lose one's partner\r\nin life is, as Lord Canning knows, like losing _half_ of one's _body_\r\nand _soul_, torn forcibly away--and dear Lady Canning was such a dear,\r\nworthy, devoted wife! But to the Queen--to a poor helpless woman--it\r\nis not that only--it is the stay, support and comfort which is lost!\r\nTo the Queen it is like _death_ in life! Great and small--_nothing_\r\nwas done without his loving advice and help--and she feels _alone_\r\nin the wide world, with many helpless children (except the Princess\r\nRoyal) to look to her--and the whole nation to look to her--_now_ when\r\nshe can barely struggle with her wretched existence! Her misery--her\r\nutter despair--she _cannot_ describe! Her _only_ support--the _only_\r\nray of comfort she gets for _a moment_, is in the _firm conviction_\r\nand certainty of his nearness, his undying love, and of their eternal\r\nreunion! Only she prays always, and pines for the latter with an\r\nanxiety she cannot describe. Like dear Lady Canning, the Queen's\r\ndarling is to rest in a garden--at Frogmore, in a Mausoleum the Queen\r\nis going to build for him and herself.\r\n\r\nThough ill, the Queen was able to tell her precious angel of Lord\r\nCanning's bereavement, and he was deeply grieved, recurring to it\r\nseveral times, and saying, \"What a loss! She was such a distinguished\r\nperson!\"\r\n\r\nMay God comfort and support Lord Canning, and may he think in his\r\nsorrow of his widowed and broken-hearted Sovereign--bowed to the earth\r\nwith the greatest of human sufferings and misfortunes!
