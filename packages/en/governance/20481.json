Many of\r\nthe principles of existing military systems date no farther back than to\r\nFrederic the Great, of Prussia, and many were originated by Napoleon.\r\nStaff departments, particularly, as now constituted, are of late origin.\r\nThe staff organization is undergoing constant changes. Its most improved\r\nform is to be found in France and Prussia. Our own staff system is of a\r\ncomposite, and, in some respects, heterogeneous character--not having\r\nbeen, constructed on any regular plan, but built up by gradual\r\naccretions and imitations of European features, from the time of our\r\nRevolution till the present. It has, however, worked with great vigor\r\nand efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe staff of any commander is usually spoken of in two classes--the\r\ndepartmental and the personal--the latter including the aides-de-camp,\r\nwho pertain more particularly to the person of the commander, while the\r\nformer belong to the organization. Of the departmental staff, the\r\nassistant adjutant-generals and assistant inspector-generals are\r\ndenominated the 'general staff,' because their functions extend through\r\nall branches of the organization, while the other officers are confined\r\nexclusively to their own departments.\r\n\r\nThe _chief of staff_ is a recent French imitation. The first officer\r\nassigned in that capacity was General Marcy, on the staff of General\r\nMcClellan, in the fall of 1861. Previous to that time the officers of\r\nthe adjutant-general's department--on account of their intimate\r\nrelations with commanding officers, as their official organs and the\r\nmediums through which all orders were transmitted--had occupied it. The\r\nduties of these officers, however, being chiefly of a bureau character,\r\nallowing them little opportunity for active external supervision, it has\r\nbeen deemed necessary to select for heads of the staffs, officers\r\nparticularly qualified to assist the commander in devising strategical\r\nplans, organizing, and moving troops, etc.; competent to oversee and\r\ndirect the proceedings of the various staff departments; untrammelled\r\nwith any exclusive routine of duty, and able in any emergency, when the\r\ncommander may be absent, to give necessary orders. For these reasons,\r\nalthough the innovation has not been sanctioned by any law, or any\r\nstanding rule of the War Department, and although its propriety is\r\ndiscussed by many, the custom of assigning officers as chiefs of staff\r\nhas become universal, and will probably be permanent. The extent and\r\ncharacter of their duties depend, however, upon themselves, being\r\nregulated by no orders, and the high responsibilities attached to the\r\nposition in France have not thus far been assumed by the officers\r\noccupying it here. In the French service, the chief of staff is the\r\nactual as well as the nominal head of the organization; he supervises\r\nall its operations; he is the _alter ego_ of the commander. In the\r\nWaterloo campaign, for instance, Marshal Soult was the chief of\r\nNapoleon's staff, and the emperor attributed his disaster, in part, to\r\nsome of the orders issued by the marshal.\r\n\r\nOur limits will not permit a description of the duties pertaining to the\r\nvarious members of the staff, but we pass to the consideration of those\r\ndepartments, the operations of which most directly affect the soldier,\r\nare indispensable to every army, and are most interesting to the public.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the _quartermaster's department_, which, from the\r\ncharacter and diversity of its duties, the amount of its expenditures,\r\nand its influence upon military operations, may be ranked as among the\r\nmost important. This department provides clothing, camp and garrison\r\nequipage, animals and transportation of all kinds, fuel, forage, straw,\r\nand stationery, an immense variety of the miscellaneous materials\r\nrequired by an army, and for a vast amount of miscellaneous\r\nexpenditures. It is, in fact, the great business operator of a military\r\norganization. In an active army, the success of movements depends very\r\nmuch on its efficiency. Unless the troops are kept properly clothed, the\r\nanimals and means of transportation maintained in good condition, and\r\nthe immense trains moved with regularity and promptness, the best\r\ncontrived plans will fail in their development and execution.\r\n\r\nThe department, at the commencement of the war, had supplies in store\r\nonly for the current uses of the regular army. When the volunteer forces\r\nwere organized it became necessary to make hasty contracts and purchases\r\nto a large amount; but as even the best-informed members of the\r\nGovernment had no adequate prevision of the extent and duration of the\r\nwar, and of the necessary arrangements for its demands, a considerable\r\nperiod elapsed before a sufficient quantity of the required materials\r\ncould be accumulated. Those were the days of 'shoddy' cloth and spavined\r\nhorses. The department, however, exhibited great administrative energy,\r\nunder the direction of its able head, General M. C. Meigs, and has amply\r\nprovided for the enormous demands upon it.\r\n\r\nDepots for the reception of supplies are established in the large\r\ncities, whence they are transferred as required to the great issuing\r\ndepots near the active armies, and from them to the depots in the field.\r\nThus, the main depots of the Army of the Potomac are at Washington and\r\nAlexandria--a field depot being established at its centre, when lying\r\nfor any length of time in camp. Only current supplies are kept on hand\r\nat the latter, and no surplus is transported on the march, except the\r\nrequired amounts of subsistence and forage.\r\n\r\nA great deal is said in connection with military movements, of 'bases of\r\noperation.' These are the points in the rear of an army from which it\r\nreceives supplies and reënforcements, and with which its communications\r\nmust at all hazards be kept open, except it has means of transportation\r\nsufficient to render it independent of its depots for a considerable\r\nperiod, or unless the country traversed is able to afford subsistence\r\nfor men and animals. When an army marches along a navigable river, its\r\nsecondary base becomes movable, and it is less confined to the necessity\r\nof protecting its rear. In Virginia, however, the connection of the Army\r\nof the Potomac with Washington is imperative, and this fact explains the\r\ncontracted sphere of the operations of that army.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of supplies is limited by the ability of the\r\nGovernment to provide trains, and by the ability of the army to protect\r\nthem; for large trains create large drafts on the troops for teamsters,\r\npioneers, guards, etc. An army train, upon the most limited allowance\r\ncompatible with freedom of operations for a few days, away from the\r\ndepots, is an immense affair. Under the existing allowances in the Army\r\nof the Potomac, a corps of thirty thousand infantry has about seven\r\nhundred wagons, drawn by four thousand two hundred mules; the horses of\r\nofficers and of the artillery will bring the number of animals to be\r\nprovided for up to about seven thousand. On the march it is calculated\r\nthat each wagon will occupy about eighty feet--in bad roads much more;\r\nconsequently a train of seven hundred wagons will cover fifty-six\r\nthousand feet of road--or over ten miles; the ambulances of a corps will\r\noccupy about a mile, and the batteries about three miles; thirty\r\nthousand troops need six miles to march in, if they form but one column;\r\nthe total length of the marching column of a corps is therefore _twenty\r\nmiles_, even without including the cattle herds and trains of bridge\r\nmaterial. Readers who have been accustomed to think that our armies have\r\nnot exhibited sufficient energy in surmounting the obstacles of bad\r\nroads, unbridged streams, etc., will be able to estimate, upon the above\r\nstatements, the immense difficulty of moving trains and artillery. The\r\ntrains of an army have been properly denominated its _impedimenta_, and\r\ntheir movement and protection is one of the most difficult incidental\r\noperations of warfare--particularly in a country like Virginia, where\r\nthe art of road making has attained no high degree of perfection, and\r\nwhere the forests swarm with guerillas.\r\n\r\nTo an unaccustomed observer the concourse of the trains of an army, in\r\nconnection with any rapid movement, would give the idea of inextricable\r\nconfusion. It is of course necessary to move them upon as many different\r\nroads as possible, but it will frequently happen that they must be\r\nconcentrated in a small space, and move in a small number of columns.\r\nDuring the celebrated 'change of base' from Richmond to Harrison's\r\nLanding, the trains were at first obliged to move upon only one\r\nroad--across White Oak Swamp--which happened fortunately to be wide\r\nenough for three wagons to go abreast. There were perhaps twenty-five\r\nhundred vehicles, which would make a continuous line of some forty or\r\nfifty miles. While the slow and toilsome course of this cumbrous column\r\nwas proceeding, the troops were obliged to remain in the rear and fight\r\nthe battles of Savage Station and White Oak Swamp for its protection. A\r\nsimilar situation of trains occurred last fall when General Meade\r\nretired from the Rappahannock, but fortunately the country presented\r\nseveral practicable routes. It is on a retreat, particularly, that the\r\ndifficulty of moving trains is experienced, and thousands of lives and\r\nmuch valuable material have been lost by the neglect of commanding\r\nofficers to place them sufficiently far in the rear during a battle, so\r\nas to permit the troops to fall back when necessary, without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nA march being ordered, supplies according to the capacity of the trains,\r\nare directed to be carried. The present capacity of the trams of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac is ten days' subsistence and forage, and sixty\r\nrounds of small-arm ammunition--the men carrying in addition a number of\r\ndays' rations, and a number of rounds, upon their persons. When the\r\nwagons reach camp each evening, such supplies as have been expended are\r\nreplenished from them. As a general rule the baggage wagons camp every\r\nnight with the troops, but the exigencies are sometimes such that\r\nofficers are compelled to deny themselves for one or even two weeks the\r\nluxury of a change of clothing--the wagons not reaching camp, perhaps,\r\ntill after midnight, and the troops resuming their march an hour or two\r\nafterward. Those who indulge in satires upon the wearers of shoulder\r\nstraps would be likely to form a more correct judgment of an officer's\r\nposition and its attendant hardships, could they see him at the close of\r\na fortnight's campaign. Like the soldier, he can rely on nothing for\r\nfood or clothing except what is carried by himself, unless he maintains\r\na servant, and the latter will find a few blankets, a coffee pot, some\r\ncrackers, meat, sugar, coffee, etc., for his own and his employer's\r\nconsumption, a sufficient burden.\r\n\r\nLet us see how the supplies of the quartermaster's department are\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nAt stated periods, if circumstances permit--usually at the first of each\r\nmonth--the regimental quartermasters, after consultation with the\r\ncompany officers, forward through their superiors to the chief\r\nquartermasters of corps, statements of the articles required by the men.\r\nThese are consolidated and presented to the chief quartermaster of the\r\narmy, who orders them from Washington, and issues them from the army\r\ndepot--the whole operation requiring about a week. The number of\r\ndifferent _kinds_ of articles thus drawn monthly is about five hundred;\r\nthe _quantity_ of each kind depends on the number of men to be supplied,\r\nand the nature of the service performed since the previous issue. If\r\nthere has been much marching, there will be a great demand for shoes; if\r\na battle, large quantities of all kinds of articles to replace those\r\nlost on the battle field will be required.\r\n\r\nAn infantry soldier is allowed the following principal articles of\r\nclothing during a three years' term of service:\r\n\r\n                   1st Year. 2d Year. 3d Year.\r\n  Cap,                 1        1                                      1\r\n  Coat,                2        1                                      2\r\n  Trowsers,            3        2                                      3\r\n  Flannel shirt,       3        3                                      3\r\n  Drawers,             3        2                                      2\r\n  Shoes,               4        4                                      4\r\n  Stockings,           4        4                                      4\r\n  Overcoat,            1        0                                      0\r\n  Blanket,             1        0                                      1\r\n  Indiarubber blanket, 1        1                                      1\r\n\r\nThe prices of these are stated each year in a circular from the\r\ndepartment, and, as the soldier draws them, his captain charges him with\r\nthe prices on the company books. The paymaster deducts from his pay any\r\nexcess which he may have drawn, or allows him if he has drawn less than\r\nhe is entitled to. The clothing is much cheaper than articles of the\r\nsame quality at home. Thus, according to the present prices, a coat\r\ncosts $7.30; overcoat, $7.50; trowsers, $2.70; flannel shirt, $1.53;\r\nstockings, 32 cents; shoes, $2.05.\r\n\r\nThe _commissary department_ provides exclusively the subsistence of the\r\ntroops. Each soldier is entitled to the following daily ration:\r\n\r\n     Twelve ounces of pork or bacon, or one pound four ounces of fresh\r\n     beef.\r\n\r\n     One pound six ounces of soft bread or flour, or one pound of hard\r\n     bread, or one pound four ounces of corn meal.\r\n\r\n     To every one hundred men, fifteen pounds of beans or peas, and ten\r\n     pounds of rice or hominy.\r\n\r\n     To every one hundred men, ten pounds of green coffee, or eight\r\n     pounds of roasted, or one pound and eight ounces of tea.\r\n\r\n     To every one hundred men, fifteen pounds of sugar, four quarts of\r\n     vinegar, one pound four ounces of candles, four pounds of soap,\r\n     three pounds twelve ounces of salt, four ounces of pepper, thirty\r\n     pounds of potatoes, when practicable, and one quart of molasses.\r\n\r\n     Fresh onions, beets, carrots, and turnips, when on hand, can be\r\n     issued in place of beans, peas, rice, or hominy, if the men desire.\r\n\r\n     They can also take in place of any part of the ration an amount\r\n     equal in value of dried apples, dried peaches, pickles, etc., when\r\n     on hand.\r\n\r\nA whiskey ration of a gill per day per man can be issued on the order of\r\nthe commander, in cases of extra hardship. It is, however, rarely\r\nissued, on account of the difficulty of finding room for its\r\ntransportation in any considerable quantities. Moreover, whiskey, in the\r\narmy, is subject to extraordinary and mysterious _leakages_, and an\r\nissue can scarcely be made with such care that some drunkenness will not\r\nensue. When lying in camp, sutlers and others sell to the soldiers\r\ncontrary to law, so that old topers usually find methods of gratifying\r\ntheir appetites--sometimes sacrificing a large proportion of their pay\r\nto the villains who pander to them. The utmost vigilance of the officers\r\nfails to detect the methods by which liquor is introduced into the army.\r\nWhen a cask is broached in any secluded place, the intelligence seems\r\ncommunicated by a pervading electrical current, and the men are seized\r\nwith a universal desire to leave camp for the purpose of washing, or\r\ngetting wood, or taking a walk, or other praise-worthy purposes.\r\n\r\nThe total weight of a ration is something over two pounds, but in\r\nmarching, some articles are omitted, and but a small quantity of salt\r\nmeat is carried--fresh beef being supplied from the herds of cattle\r\ndriven with the army. A bullock will afford about four hundred and fifty\r\nrations, so that an army of one hundred thousand men needs over two\r\nhundred cattle daily for its supply.\r\n\r\nIn camp the men can refrain from drawing portions of their rations, and\r\nthe surplus is allowed for by the commissaries in money, by which a\r\ncompany fund can be created, and expended in the purchase of gloves,\r\ngaiters, etc., or luxuries for the table. A hospital fund is formed in\r\nthe same way--by an allowance for the portions of the rations not\r\nconsumed by the patients--and is expended in articles adapted to diet\r\nfor the sick. The rations are ample and of good quality, though the salt\r\nmeat is rather tough occasionally, and the consistency of the hard bread\r\nis shot-proof. Company cooks are allowed, and in camp they contrive to\r\nfurnish quite appetizing meals. Their position is rather difficult to\r\nfill, and woe is the portion of the cook not competent for his\r\nprofession. The practical annoyances to which he is subject make him\r\nrealize to the fullest extent 'the unfathomable depths of human woe.' On\r\nthe march the men usually prefer to boil their coffee in tin cups, and\r\nto cook their meat on ram-rods--without waiting for the more formal\r\nmovements of the cooks. To reach camp before sunset, after a twenty-mile\r\nmarch, to pitch his little shelter tent, throw in it his heavy arms and\r\naccoutrements, collect some pine twigs for a couch, wash in some\r\nadjacent stream, drink his cup of hot, strong coffee, eat his salt pork\r\nand hard bread, and then wrap himself in his blanket for a dreamless\r\nslumber, is one of the most delicious combinations of luxurious\r\nenjoyment a soldier knows. To-morrow, perhaps, he starts up at the early\r\n_reveille_, takes his hasty breakfast, is marshalled into line before\r\nthe enemy, there is a shriek in the air rent by the murderous shell, and\r\nthe soldier's last march is ended.\r\n\r\nThe next department we shall consider is that of _ordnance_, which\r\nsupplies the munitions and portions of accoutrements.\r\n\r\nThe subject of _artillery_ is perhaps the most interesting of the great\r\nnumber connected with warfare. In the popular estimation it overshadows\r\nall others. All the poetry of war celebrates the grandeur of\r\n\r\n  'Those mortal engines whose rude throats\r\n  The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit.'\r\n\r\nThe thunder of great guns and the dashing of cavalry are the incidents\r\nwhich spontaneously present themselves to the mind when a battle is\r\nmentioned. Perhaps the accounts of Waterloo are responsible for this.\r\nThe steady fighting of masses of infantry, having less particulars to\r\nattract the imagination, is overlooked; the fact, preëminent above all\r\nothers in military science, that it is the infantry which contests and\r\ndecides battles, that artillery and cavalry are only subordinate\r\nagencies--is forgotten. So splendid have been the inventions and\r\nachievements of the last few years in respect to artillery, as\r\nillustrated particularly at Charleston, that some excuse may easily be\r\nfound for the popular misconception. A few remarks presenting some\r\ntruths relative to the appropriate sphere of artillery and its powers,\r\nand stating succinctly the results which have been accomplished, may be\r\nfound interesting.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into the history of artillery, it will be sufficient to\r\nstate that the peculiar distinguishing excellence of modern improvements\r\nin cannon is the attainment of superior efficiency, accuracy, and\r\nmobility, with a decrease in weight of metal. A gun of any given size is\r\nnow many times superior to one of the same size in use fifty or a\r\nhundred years ago. It is not so much in _big guns_ that we excel our\r\npredecessors--for there are many specimens of old cannon of great\r\ndimensions; but by our advance in science we are able so to shape our\r\nguns and our projectiles that with less weight of material we can throw\r\nlarger shot to a greater distance and with more accuracy. A long course\r\nof mathematical experiment and calculation has determined the exact\r\npressure of a charge of powder at all points in the bore of a cannon\r\nduring its combustion and evolution into gas. These experiments have\r\nproved that strength is principally required near the breech, and that a\r\ncannon need not be of so great length as was formerly supposed to be\r\nnecessary. We are thus able to construct guns which can be handled,\r\nthrowing balls of several hundred pounds' weight. Another splendid\r\nresult of scientific investigation is the method adopted for casting\r\nsuch monster guns. In order that the mass of metal may be of uniform\r\ntenacity and character, it should cool equably. This has been secured by\r\na plan for introducing a stream of water through the core of the\r\ncasting, so that the metal cools both within and without simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that the Italian war commenced, the subject of rifled\r\ncannon excited much popular interest. Exaggerated expectations were\r\nformed of the changes to be produced by them in the art of warfare. Many\r\nsaw in them the means of abolishing war entirely. Of what use is it,\r\nthey said, to array armies against each other, if they can be destroyed\r\nat two or three miles' distance? At the commencement of our own contest\r\nthere was an undue partiality for rifled ordnance. Almost every\r\ncommander of a battery desired to have rifled guns. The more correct\r\nviews of the thoroughly accomplished artillery officers to whom was\r\nconfided the arrangement of this branch of the service, and actual\r\nexperience, have dissipated the unfounded estimate of their utility for\r\nfield service, and established the proper proportions in an artillery\r\nforce which they should compose. It has been ascertained that fighting\r\nwill never be confined to long ranges--that guns which can throw large\r\nvolumes of spherical case and canister into lines only a few hundred\r\nyards distant are as necessary as ever.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for rifled cannon arose from the perfection of rifled\r\nmuskets. When these arms reached such a degree of excellence that horses\r\nand gunners could be shot down at a distance of one thousand yards, the\r\nold-fashioned smooth-bore artillery was deprived of its prestige. To\r\nretrieve this disadvantage and restore the superiority of artillery over\r\nmusketry in length of range, methods of rifling cannon for field service\r\nbecame an important study. For assailing distant lines of troops, for\r\nopening a battle, for dispersing bodies of cavalry, for shelling\r\nintrenchments, for firing over troops from hills in their rear, rifled\r\nguns are of invaluable service. But, notwithstanding troops are now\r\nuniversally armed with muskets of long range, no battle of importance is\r\nfought without close engagements of the lines. The alternate advances\r\nand retreats of the infantry, firing at distances of less than one\r\nhundred yards, charging with fixed bayonets and frantic shouts, will\r\nalways characterize any battle fought with vigor and enthusiasm. In such\r\nconflicts, wide-mouthed smooth bores, belching their torrents of iron,\r\nmust play a conspicuous part.\r\n\r\nAnother fact, which will perhaps surprise the general reader, is that\r\nthe form and character of _projectiles_ have been matters of as much\r\ndifficulty, have received as much investigation, and are of as much\r\nimportance, as the shape and character of the guns. In fact, rifled\r\npieces would be comparatively ineffective except projectiles adapted to\r\nthem had been invented. It was necessary that projectiles of greater\r\nweight, of less resistance to the atmosphere, and of more accuracy of\r\nflight, than the old round shot, should be introduced. To accomplish\r\nthese ends several things were necessary: 1st, the projectiles should be\r\nelongated; 2d, they should have conical points; 3d, the centre of\r\ngravity should be at a proper distance in front of the centre; 4th,\r\nthere should be methods of _steering_ them so that they should always go\r\npoint foremost through the whole curve of their flight; 5th, they should\r\nfit the gun so as to take the rifles, yet not so closely as to strain\r\nit. To attain these and other requisites, innumerable plans have been\r\ndevised. The projectile offering the best normal conditions is the\r\n_arrow_; it has length, a sharp point, centre of gravity near the head,\r\nand feathers for guiding it (sometimes so arranged that it shall rotate\r\nlike a rifled ball). Improved projectiles, therefore, both for muskets\r\nand cannon, correspond in these essentials to the first products of man\r\nin the savage state.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, in this article, further discuss either such general\r\nprinciples or those of a more abstruse character, in their application\r\nto artillery, but will briefly state a few facts relative to its\r\nemployment--confining ourselves exclusively to the _field service_.\r\n\r\nThe guns now principally used for battles, in the Northern armies, are\r\n10 and 12-pounder Parrotts, three-inch United States rifles, and light\r\n12-pounder smooth bores. The distinguishing characteristic of the\r\nParrott guns is lightness of construction, secured by strengthening the\r\nbreech (in accordance with the principles mentioned a few paragraphs\r\nback) with a band of wrought iron. This has been applied to guns of all\r\nsizes, and its excellence has been tested by General Gillmore in the\r\nreduction of Forts Pulaski and Sumter. The three-inch guns are made of\r\nwrought iron, are of light weight, but exceedingly tenacious and\r\naccurate. The 12-pounders, sometimes called Napoleons, are of bronze,\r\nwith large caliber, and used chiefly for throwing shell and canister at\r\ncomparatively short distances.\r\n\r\nThe greatest artillery conflict of the war (in the field) occurred at\r\nGettysburg. For two hours in the afternoon of the memorable third day's\r\nbattle, about four hundred cannon were filling the heavens with their\r\nthunder, and sending their volleys of death crashing in all directions.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that the discharges numbered five or six a second; in\r\nfact, the ear could hardly detect any cessations in the roar. The air\r\nwas constantly howling as the shells swept through it, while the falling\r\nof branches, cut from the trees by the furious missiles, seemed as if a\r\ntornado was in the height of its fury: every few minutes, a thunder\r\nheard above all other sounds, denoted the explosion of a caisson,\r\nsweeping into destruction, with a cataract of fire and iron, men and\r\nanimals for hundreds of feet around it. The effect of such a fire of\r\nartillery is, however, much less deadly than any except those who have\r\nbeen subject to it can believe. The prevalent impression concerning the\r\nrelative destructiveness of cannon and musketry is another instance of\r\npopular error. In the first place, all firing at over a mile distance\r\ncontains a large proportion of the elements of chance, for it is\r\nimpossible to get the range and to time the fuses so accurately as to\r\nmake any considerable percentage of the shots effective; and in the next\r\nplace, except when marching to a close conflict, the men are generally\r\nprotected by lying down behind inequalities of the ground, or other\r\naccidental or designed defences. The proportion killed in any battle by\r\nartillery fire is very small. Lines of men frequently lie exposed to\r\nconstant shelling for hours, with small loss; in fact, in such cases,\r\nold soldiers will eat their rations, or smoke their pipes, or perhaps\r\nhave a game of poker, with great equanimity.\r\n\r\nNo portion of the military service has been more misrepresented than the\r\n_medical department_. An opinion seems to prevail quite extensively that\r\nthe army surgeon is generally a young graduate, vain of his official\r\nposition, who cares little for the health of the soldier, and glories in\r\nthe opportunities afforded by a battle for reckless operations. Such an\r\nopinion is altogether fallacious. In the regiments there are undoubtedly\r\nmany physicians who have adopted the service as a resource for a living\r\nwhich they were unable to find at home, but the majority are exactly the\r\nsame class of professional men as those who pursue useful and honorable\r\ncareers in all our cities and villages. When a physician is called upon\r\nat home, it happens in a majority of cases--as every honest member of\r\nthe profession will admit--that there is little or no necessity for his\r\nservices. Too sagacious to avow this, he gravely makes some simple\r\nprescription, and as gravely pockets his fee. In camp, however, the\r\npotent argument of the fee does not prevail, and men who run to the\r\ndoctor with trifling ailments, by which they hope to be relieved from\r\nduty, receive a rebuff instead of a pill. They instantly write letters\r\ncomplaining of his inhumanity. In regard to operations, it is a frequent\r\nremark by the most experienced surgeons that lives are lost from the\r\nhesitancy to amputate, more frequently than limbs are removed\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe medical department of an army, like every other, is controlled by a\r\n_system_, and it is this which regulates its connections with the\r\nsoldier more than the qualifications of individual surgeons. In the army\r\nthe _system_ takes care of everything, even to the minutest details.\r\nHygienic regulations for preserving the salubrity of camps and the\r\ncleanliness of the troops and their tents, are prescribed and enforced.\r\nEvery day there is a 'sick call' at which men who find themselves ill\r\npresent themselves to the surgeons for treatment. If slightly affected,\r\nthey are taken care of in their own quarters; if more seriously, in the\r\nregimental hospitals; if still more so, in the large hospitals\r\nestablished by the chief medical officer of the corps; and if necessary,\r\nsent to the Government hospitals established at various places in the\r\ncountry. To the latter almost all the sick are transferred previous to a\r\nmarch. To be ill in the army, amid the constant noises of a camp, and\r\nwith the non-luxurious appliances of a field hospital, is no very\r\npleasant matter; but the sick soldier receives all the attention and\r\naccommodation possible under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo every corps is attached a train of ambulances, in the proportion of\r\ntwo or three to a regiment. They are spring wagons with seats along the\r\nsides, like an omnibus, which can, when necessary, be made to form a bed\r\nfor two or three persons. With each train is a number of wagons,\r\ncarrying tents, beds, medicine chests, etc., required for the\r\nestablishment of hospitals. On the march, the ambulances collect the\r\nsick and exhausted who fall out from the columns and have a surgeon's\r\ncertificate as to their condition. When a battle is impending, and the\r\nfield of conflict fixed, the chief medical officers of the corps take\r\npossession of houses and barns in the rear, collect hay and straw for\r\nbedding, or, if more convenient, pitch the tents at proper localities. A\r\ndetail of surgeons is made to give the necessary attendance. While the\r\nbattle proceeds, the lightly wounded fall to the rear, and are there\r\ntemporarily treated by the surgeons who have accompanied the troops to\r\nthe field, and then find their way to the hospitals. If the fighting has\r\npassed beyond the places where lie the more dangerously wounded, they\r\nare brought to the rear by the 'stretcher bearers' attached to the\r\nambulance trains, and carried to the hospitals in the ambulances.\r\nSometimes it happens that the strife will rage for hours on nearly the\r\nsame spot, and it may be night before the 'stretcher bearers' can go out\r\nand collect the wounded. But the surgeons make indefatigable exertions,\r\noften exposed to great danger, to give their attention to those who\r\nrequire it. At the best, war is terrible--all its 'pomp, pride, and\r\ncircumstance' disappear in the view of the wounded and dead on the\r\nfield, and of the mangled remnants of humanity in the hospitals. But\r\neverything that can be devised and applied to mitigate its horrors is\r\nprovided under the systematized organization of the medical department.\r\nIn the Army of the Potomac, at least, and undoubtedly in all the other\r\narmies of the North, that department combines skill, vigor, humanity,\r\nand efficiency to an astonishing degree. Its results are exhibited not\r\nonly in the small mortality of the camps, but in the celerity of its\r\noperation on the field of battle, and the great proportion of lives\r\npreserved after the terrible wounds inflicted by deadly fragments of\r\nshell and the still more deadly rifle bullet. Military surgery has\r\nattained a degree of proficiency during the experiences of the past\r\nthree years which a layman cannot adequately describe; its results are,\r\nhowever, palpable.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since that article was written, some changes of detail have\r\nbeen made, but the principles remain the same.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nÆNONE:\r\n\r\nA TALE OF SLAVE LIFE IN ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nRaising himself with an assumed air of careless indifference, in the\r\nhope of thereby concealing the momentary weakness into which his better\r\nfeelings had so nearly betrayed him, Sergius strolled off, humming a\r\nGallic wine song. Ænone also rose; and, struggling to stifle her\r\nemotion, confronted the new comer.\r\n\r\nShe, upon her part, stood silent and impassive, appearing to have heard\r\nor seen nothing of what had transpired, and to have no thought in her\r\nmind except the desire of fulfilling the duty which had brought her\r\nthither. But Ænone knew that the most unobservant person, upon entering,\r\ncould not have failed at a glance to comprehend the whole import of the\r\nscene--and that therefore any such studied pretence of ignorance was\r\nsuperfluous. The attitude of the parties, the ill-disguised confusion of\r\nSergius, her own tears, which could not be at once entirely\r\nrepressed--all combined to tell a tale of recrimination, pleading, and\r\nbaffled confidence, as plainly as words could have spoken it. Apart,\r\ntherefore, from her disappointment at being interrupted at the very\r\nmoment when her hopes had whispered that the happiness of reconciliation\r\nmight be at hand, Ænone could not but feel indignant that Leta should\r\nthus calmly stand before her with that pretence of innocent\r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\n'Why do you come hither? Who has demanded your presence?' Ænone cried,\r\nnow, in her indignation, caring but little what or how she spoke, or\r\nwhat further revelations her actions might occasion, as long as so much\r\nhad already been exposed.\r\n\r\n'My lady,' rejoined the Greek, raising her eyes with a well-executed air\r\nof surprise, 'do I intrude? I came but to say that in the antechamber\r\nthere is--'\r\n\r\n'Listen!' exclaimed Ænone, interrupting her, and taking her by the hand.\r\n'Not an hour ago you told me about your quiet home in Samos--its green\r\nvines--the blue mountains which encircled it--the little chamber where\r\nyour mother died, and in which you were born--and the lover whom you\r\nleft weeping at your cruel absence. You spoke of your affection for\r\nevery leaf and blade of grass about the place--and how you would give\r\nyour life itself to go back thither--yes, even your life, for you would\r\nbe content to lie down and die, if you could first return. Do you\r\nremember?'\r\n\r\n'Well, my lady?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you shall return, as you desired. You have been given to me for\r\nmy own; and whether or not the gift be a full and free one, I will claim\r\nmy rights under it and set you free. In the first ship which sails from\r\nOstia for any port of Greece, in that ship you may depart. Are you\r\ncontent, Leta?'\r\n\r\nStill holding her by the hand, Ænone gazed inquiringly into the burning\r\nblack eyes which fastened themselves upon her own, as though reading the\r\nbottom of her soul. She could not as yet believe that even if the Greek\r\nhad actually begun to cherish any love for Sergius, it could be more\r\nthan a passing fancy, engendered by foolish compliments or ill-judged\r\nsigns of admiration, and therefore she did not doubt that the offer of\r\nfreedom and restoration would be gratefully received. Her only\r\nuncertainty was with regard to the manner in which it would be listened\r\nto--whether with tears of joy or with loud protestations of gratitude\r\nupon bended knees; or whether the prospect of once again visiting that\r\ncottage home and all that had so long been held dear, would come with\r\nsuch unpremeditated intensity as to stifle all outward manifestations of\r\ndelight, except, perhaps, that trembling of the lip or ebb and flow of\r\ncolor which is so often the surest sign of a full and glowing heart.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Leta stood gazing up into the face of her mistress,\r\nuttering no word of thanks, and with no tear of joy glistening in her\r\neye, but with the deepened flush of uncontrollable emotion overspreading\r\nher features. And yet that flush seemed scarcely the token of a heart\r\noverpowered with sudden joy, but rather of a mind conscious of being\r\ninvolved in an unexpected dilemma, and puzzled with its inability to\r\nextricate itself.\r\n\r\n'My mistress,' she responded at length, with lowered gaze, 'it is true\r\nthat I said I would return, if possible, to that other home of mine. But\r\nnow that you offer me the gift, I would not desire to accept it. Let me\r\nstay here with you.'\r\n\r\nÆnone dropped the hand which till now she had held; and an agony of\r\nmingled surprise, suspicion, disappointment, and presentiment of evil\r\nswept across her features.\r\n\r\n'Are you then become like all others?' she said with bitterness. 'Has\r\nthe canker of this Roman life already commenced to eat into your soul,\r\nso that in future no memory of anything that is pure or good can attract\r\nyou from its hollow splendors? Are thoughts of home, of freedom, of\r\nfriends, even of the trusted lover of whom you spoke--are all these now\r\nof no account, when weighed against a few gilded pleasures?'\r\n\r\n'Why, indeed, should I care to return to that home?' responded the girl.\r\n'Have not the Roman soldiers trodden down those vines and uprooted that\r\nhearth? Is it a desolated and stricken home that I would care to see?'\r\n\r\n'False--false!' cried Ænone, no longer regardful of her words, but only\r\nanxious to give utterance--no matter how rashly--to the suspicions which\r\nshe had so long and painfully repressed. 'It is even more than the mere\r\ncharms of this imperial city which entice you. It is that you are my\r\nenemy, and would stay here to sting the hand that was so truly anxious\r\nto protect you--that for your own purposes you would watch about my\r\npath, and ever, as now, play the spy upon my actions, and--'\r\n\r\n'Nay, nay!' cried the Greek, her flashing eye and erect attitude in\r\nstrong contrast with the softened tone in which, more from habit than\r\nfrom prudence, she had spoken. 'When have I played the spy upon you? Not\r\nnow, indeed, for I have come in, not believing that I was doing harm,\r\nbut simply because my duty has led me hither. I came to tell you that\r\nthere is a stranger--an old man--standing in the court below, and that\r\nhe craves audience with you. Is this a wrong thing for me to do? Were I\r\nto forbear performance of this duty, would not my neglect insure me\r\npunishment?'\r\n\r\nÆnone answered not, but, by a strong effort, kept back the words that\r\nshe would have uttered. Still angry and crushed with the sense of being\r\ndeceived, and yet conscious that it was not a noble or dignified thing\r\nto be in disputation with her own slave, and that there was, moreover,\r\nthe remote possibility that the girl was not her enemy, and might really\r\ndread returning to a desolated and devastated home, what could she say\r\nor do? And while she pondered the matter, the door again opened.\r\n\r\n'And this is he of whom I spoke. Do you doubt me now?' exclaimed the\r\nGreek, in a tone in which a shade of malicious triumph mingled with soft\r\nreproach. And she moved away, and left the room, while Ænone, lifting\r\nher eyes, saw her father standing before her.\r\n\r\n'A plague take the wench who has just left you!' he muttered. 'Did she\r\nnot tell you that I was below? I sent word by her, and here she has left\r\nme for half an hour kicking my heels together in the courtyard. And I\r\nmight have stayed there forever, if I had not of myself found my way up.\r\nEven then, there were some who would have stopped me, deeming me,\r\nperhaps, too rough in appearance to be allowed to ascend. But I told\r\nthem that there was a time when members of the house of Porthenus did\r\nnot wait in antechambers, but stood beside the consuls of the old\r\nrepublic, and I touched the hilt of my dagger; and whether it was the\r\none argument or the other which prevailed, here I am.'\r\n\r\nWith a grim smile the centurion then threw himself down upon a settee\r\nnear the door, arranged as properly as possible the folds of his coarse\r\ntunic, drew his belt round so as to show more in front his dagger with\r\nrichly embossed sheath--the sole article of courtly and ceremonious\r\nattire in which he indulged--and endeavored to assume an easy and\r\nimposing attitude. For an instant he gazed around the room, observantly\r\ntaking in its wealth of mosaic pavement, paintings, statuary, and vases.\r\nThen, as he began to fear lest he might be yielding too much of his\r\npride before the overbearing influence of so much luxury, he\r\nstraightened himself up, gathered upon his features a hard and somewhat\r\ncontemptuous expression, and roughly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Yes, by the gods, the Portheni lived with consuls and proconsuls long\r\nbefore the house of Vanno began to rise from the dregs and become a\r\nhouse at all. And the imperator knows it, and is jealous of the fact,\r\ntoo, or else he would the better acknowledge it. What, now, is that?' he\r\nadded, pointing to the central fresco of the ceiling.\r\n\r\n'It is--I know not for certain, my father--but I think--'\r\n\r\n'Nay, but I know what it is. It is the old story of the three Vanni\r\novercoming the five Cimbri at the bridge of Athesis. No great matter,\r\nnor so very long ago, even if it were true. But why did he not paint up,\r\ninstead, how the founder of the Portheni, with his single arm, slew the\r\nten Carthaginians under the aqueduct of Megara? Is not now your family\r\nhistory a portion of his own? His jealousy prevented him, I suppose;\r\nthough I doubt not that, when in his cups with his high associates, he\r\noften boasts of his connection with the house of Porthenus. And yet he\r\nwould let the only relic of the family starve before assisting him.'\r\n\r\nÆnone stood as in a maze of confusion and uncertainty. Were the trials\r\nof the day never to end? First her unsatisfactory strife and pleading\r\nwith her husband; then the undignified contest with her own slave into\r\nwhich she had been betrayed; and now came this old man--her father, to\r\nbe sure--but so much the more mortifying to her, as his vulgarity,\r\nquerulous complaining, and insulting strictures were forced upon her\r\nears.\r\n\r\n'Are you not comfortable? What more can he or I do for you?' she said,\r\nwith some impatience.\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay; there it is,' growled the centurion. 'One person must have all\r\nluxuries--paintings, silver, and the like; but if the other has only\r\nmere comforts, an extra tunic, perhaps, or a spare bit of meat for a\r\ndog, what more can he want? But I will tell you what you can do? And it\r\nis not as a gift, I ask it. Poor and despised as he may be, no one can\r\nsay that the centurion Porthenus is a beggar. It is as a fair matter of\r\nbusiness that I offer it.'\r\n\r\n'Well, my father?'\r\n\r\n'It is this: I have two slaves, and can afford to keep only one of them,\r\nparticularly as but one can be of use to me. Will the imperator purchase\r\nthe other? I will give it for a fair price, and therefore no one can say\r\nthat I have asked for anything beyond a proper trade, with which either\r\nside should be well satisfied.'\r\n\r\nÆnone listened with a blush of shame for her father overspreading her\r\nface. It did not occur to her that the slave rejected as useless could\r\nbe any other than the hunchback, whom her husband had bestowed upon the\r\ncenturion a few days before; and for the receiver to try to sell back a\r\ngift to the giver was a depth of meanness for which no filial partiality\r\nor affection could find an excuse.\r\n\r\n'I will show him to you,' cried the centurion, losing a little of his\r\ngruffness in his eagerness to effect a transaction, whereby, under the\r\nthin guise of a simple trade, he could extort a benefit. 'I have brought\r\nhim with me, and left him below. You will see that he is of good\r\nappearance, and that the imperator will be pleased and grateful to me\r\nfor the opportunity of possessing him.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, Porthenus strode to the head of the stairway, and issued his\r\ncommands in a stern voice, which made the vaulted ceilings of the palace\r\nring. A faint, weak response came up in answer, and in a moment the\r\nslave entered the room.\r\n\r\n'Is this the one of whom you spoke?' faltered Ænone, unable for the\r\nmoment to retain her self-possession as she beheld, not the angular,\r\nwiry form of the hunchback, but the careworn and slim figure of Cleotos.\r\n'I thought--indeed I thought that you spoke of the inferior of the two.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, and so I do,' responded her father. 'Of what use to me can this man\r\nbe? The other one, indeed, is of tenfold value. There is no slave in\r\nRome like unto him for cleaning armor or sharpening a weapon, while to\r\nrun of an errand or manage any piece of business in which brains must\r\nbear their part, I will trust him against the world. But as for this man\r\nhere, with his weak limbs and his simple face--do you know that I did\r\nbut set him to polish the rim of a shield, and in his awkwardness he let\r\nit fall, and spoiled the surface as though a Jewish spear had stricken\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nÆnone remained silent, scarcely listening to the words of her father,\r\nwhile, in a troubled manner, she again mentally ran over, as she had\r\ndone hundreds of times before, the chances of recognition by the man who\r\nstood before her.\r\n\r\n'But listen to me still further,' continued the centurion, fearful lest\r\nhis disparaging comments might defeat the projected sale. 'I only speak\r\nof him as he is useful or not to me. To another person he would be most\r\nvaluable; for, though he cannot polish armor, he can polish verses, and\r\nhe can write as well as though he were educated for a scribe. For one\r\nfavored of fortune like the imperator Sergius Vanno,' and here again the\r\ncenturion began to roll the high-sounding name upon his tongue with\r\nobvious relish, 'who wishes an attendant to carry his wine cup, or to\r\nbear his cloak after him, or to trim his lamps, and read aloud his\r\nfavorite books, where could a better youth than this be found?'\r\n\r\nÆnone, still overpowered by her troubled thoughts, made no response.\r\n\r\n'Or to yourself,' eagerly continued the centurion, 'he would be most\r\nsuitable, with his pale, handsome face, and his slender limbs. Have you\r\na page?'\r\n\r\n'I have my maidens,' was the answer.\r\n\r\n'And that amounts to nothing at all,' asserted her father. 'A plebeian\r\ncan have her maidens in plenty, but it is not right that the wife of a\r\nhigh and mighty imperator,' and here again the words rolled majestically\r\noff his tongue, 'should not also have her male attendants. And the more\r\nso when that wife has been taken from an ancient house like that of\r\nPorthenus,' he added, with a frown in derogation of any tendency to give\r\nundue importance to her present position. 'But with this Cleotos--come\r\nforward, slave, and let yourself be seen.'\r\n\r\nCleotos, who, partly from natural diffidence, and partly from being\r\nabashed at the unaccustomed splendor about him, had, little by little,\r\nfrom his first entrance, shrunk into a corner, now advanced; and Ænone,\r\nonce more resolutely assuring herself that, with the changes which time,\r\nposition, difference of place and costume had thrown about her, she\r\ncould defy recognition, summoned all her courage, and looked him in the\r\nface. It may have been with an unacknowledged fear lest, now that she\r\nsaw him so freely in the broad daylight, some latent spark of the old\r\nattachment might burst into a flame, and withdraw her heart from its\r\nproper duty; but at the first glance she felt that in this respect she\r\nhad nothing to dread. In almost every particular, Cleotos had but little\r\nchanged. His costume was but slightly different from that which he had\r\nalways been accustomed to wear; for the centurion, in view of the chance\r\nof effecting a profitable sale, had, for that occasion, made him put on\r\nsuitable and becoming attire. The face was still youthful--the eye, as\r\nof old, soft, expressive, and unhardened by the ferocities of the world\r\nabout him. As Ænone looked, it seemed as though the years which had\r\npassed rolled back again, and that she was once more a girl. But it also\r\nseemed as though something else had passed away--as though she looked\r\nnot upon a lover, but rather upon a quiet, kindhearted, innocent\r\nfriend--one who could ever be dear to her as a brother, but as nothing\r\nelse. What was it which had so flitted away that the same face could now\r\nstir up no fire of passion, but only a friendly interest? Something, she\r\ncould not tell what; but she thanked the gods that it was so, and drew a\r\nlong breath of relief.\r\n\r\nBut it was none the less incumbent upon her, for the sake of that\r\npresent friendship and for the memory of that old regard, to cast her\r\nprotection over him. For an instant the thought flashed across her that\r\nit would be well to purchase him, not simply for a page, but so that she\r\ncould have him in the way of kind treatment and attention until some\r\nopportunity of restoring him to his native land might occur. But then\r\nagain was the danger that, if any great length of time should meanwhile\r\nelapse, unconsidered trifles might lead to a recognition. No, that plan\r\ncould not be thought of. She must keep a protecting eye upon him from a\r\ndistance, and trust to the future for a safe working out of the problem.\r\n\r\n'It cannot be,' she murmured, in answer, half to her father, half to her\r\nown suggestion.\r\n\r\n''Tis well,' muttered the centurion, rising with an air of displeasure\r\nwhich indicated that he thought it very ill. 'I supposed that it would\r\nbe a kindness to the imperator or to yourself to give the first offer of\r\nthe man. But it matters little. The captain Polidorus will take him any\r\nmoment at a fair price.'\r\n\r\n'You will not send him to the captain Polidorus?' exclaimed Ænone in\r\naffright. For at once the many atrocities of that man toward his slaves\r\nrose in her mind--how that he had slain one in a moment of passion--how\r\nthat he had deliberately beaten another to death for attempting to\r\nescape to the catacombs--how that stripes and torture were the daily\r\nportion of the unfortunates in his power--and that, not by reason of any\r\ngross neglect of their duty, but for the merest and most trifling\r\ninadvertencies. Better death than such a fate.\r\n\r\n'Pah! What can I do?' retorted Porthenus, skilfully touching the chord\r\nof her sympathies, as he saw how sensitive she was to its vibrations.\r\n'It is true that Polidorus is no fawning woman, and that he greets his\r\nslaves with the rod and the brand, and what not. It is true that he\r\nthinks but little of sending one of them to Hades through the avenue of\r\nhis fishponds. But that, after all, is his affair, and if he chooses to\r\ndestroy his property, what should it matter to me? Am I so rich that I\r\ncan afford to lose a fair purchaser because he may incline to hang or\r\ndrown his bargain? Such self-denial may suit the governor of a\r\nprovince, but should not be expected of a poor centurion.'\r\n\r\nÆnone trembled, and again the impulse to make the purchase came upon\r\nher. Better to risk anything for herself--recognition, discovery,\r\nsuspicion, or misconstruction, than that her friendship should so far\r\nfail as to allow this poor captive to fall into the hands of a brutish\r\ntyrant. There was a purse of gold in the half-opened drawer of a table\r\nwhich stood near her; and, in sore perplexity, she raised it, then let\r\nit fall, and again lifted it. As the centurion listened to the ring of\r\nthe metal, his eyes sparkled, and he prepared to apply new arguments,\r\nwhen Cleotos himself sprang forward.\r\n\r\n'I know nothing about this Polidorus of whom they speak,' said he,\r\ndropping upon one knee at her feet. 'And it is not to save myself from\r\nhis hands that I ask your pity, most noble lady. There is much that I\r\nhave already suffered, and perhaps a little more might make no\r\ndifference, or, better yet, might close the scene with me forever. It is\r\nfor other reasons that I would wish to be in this house--even as the\r\nlowest, meanest slave of all, rather than to live in the halls of the\r\nemperor Titus himself. There is one in this house, most noble lady, from\r\nwhom I have long been cruelly separated, and who--what can I say but\r\nthat if, when I was a free man, she gave me her love, now, in my\r\nabasement, she will not fail with that love to brighten my lot?'\r\n\r\nÆnone started. At hearing such words, there could be but one thought in\r\nher mind--that he had actually recognized her, and that, without waiting\r\nto see whether or not she had forgotten him, and certainly knowing that\r\nin any event her position toward him had become changed, he was daring\r\nto covertly suggest a renewal of their old relationship. But the next\r\nwords reassured her.\r\n\r\n'We lived near each other in Samos, my lady. I was happy, and I blessed\r\nthe fates for smiling upon us. How was I then to know that she would be\r\ntorn away from me upon the very day when I was to have led her to my own\r\nhome?'\r\n\r\n'You say that she is here? Is it--do you speak of Leta?' cried Ænone.\r\n\r\n'Leta was her name,' he responded, in some surprise that his secret had\r\nbeen so promptly penetrated before he had more than half unfolded it.\r\n'And she is here.'\r\n\r\nThere was to Ænone perhaps one instant of almost unconscious regret at\r\nlearning that she had been forgotten for another. But it passed away\r\nlike a fleeting cloud--banished from her mind by the full blaze of\r\nhappiness which poured in upon her at the thought that here at last was\r\nwhat would counteract the cruel schemes which were warring against her\r\npeace, and would thereby bring sure relief to her sorrow.\r\n\r\n'And she is here,' repeated Cleotos. 'When at the first she was torn\r\nfrom my side, most noble lady, I would have died, if I could, for I did\r\nnot believe that life had any further blessing in store for me. But,\r\nthough the Roman armies were cruel, the fates have been kind, and have\r\nagain brought us near. It was but a week ago that, as I looked up by the\r\nmoonlight at these palace walls, I saw her. Can it be, that after so\r\nlong a time, the gods meant I should be brought near, to have but this\r\none glimpse of happiness, and then again be sundered from it?'\r\n\r\n'It cannot be--it was not meant to be,' exclaimed Ænone, with energy;\r\nand again lifting the purse of gold, she placed it in the centurion's\r\nhand. 'There, I will purchase your slave,' she said. 'Take from this his\r\nproper price, and leave him with me.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe centurion received the purse with ill-dissembled joy. Had he been\r\nfully able to control himself, he would doubtless have maintained a\r\nquiet air of dignified self-possession, befitting one giving full value\r\nfor what he had received, and therefore not expected to exhibit any\r\npeculiarly marked or lively satisfaction. But the affair had been\r\nconcluded so suddenly, and with such a liberal confidence in his\r\ndiscretion, that, for the moment, his hands trembled with excitement,\r\nand his face shone with avaricious pleasure.\r\n\r\nThen he began to count out the gold pieces, gleefully dropping some into\r\nhis pouch, and reluctantly putting others back into the purse. From the\r\nfirst he had established in his own mind the valuation which he would\r\nplace upon the slave; and he had taken care to make his calculation upon\r\nsuch a liberal scale that he could well afford to consent to a large\r\ndeduction, if it were required of him. Now he reasoned that, as his\r\nchild had merely told him to take out what was proper, there could be no\r\nimpropriety in paying himself at the highest possible price. She would\r\nnever mind, and there were many comforts which he needed, and which an\r\nextra gold piece or two would enable him to procure for himself.\r\n\r\nThen, as he weighed the purse and pondered over it, numerous wants and\r\nrequirements, which he had hardly known until that time, came into his\r\nmind. He might supply them all, if he were not too timid or scrupulous\r\nin availing himself of an opportunity such as might never come to him\r\nagain. Had even his first valuation of the slave been a sufficient one?\r\nHe ought certainly to consider that the man could read and write, and\r\nwas of such beauty and grace that he could be trained to a most courtly\r\nair; and it was hardly proper to sell him for no more than the price of\r\na couple of gladiators, mere creatures of bone and brawn. And, in any\r\nevent, it was hardly probable that Ænone knew the true value of slaves,\r\nor even remembered how much her purse had contained.\r\n\r\nThus meanly reflecting, the centurion dropped more of the gold pieces\r\ninto his pocket, all the while eying the slave with keen scrutiny, as\r\nthough calculating the market value of every hair upon his head. Then,\r\nwith a sigh, he handed back the purse, most wofully lightened of its\r\ncontents, and turned from the room, endeavoring to compose his features\r\ninto a decent appearance of sober indifference, and muttering that he\r\nwould not have allowed himself to be betrayed into giving up such a\r\nprize so cheaply had it not been that he had an especial regard for the\r\nimperator Sergius Vanno, and that the house of Porthenus had never\r\nnourished mere traders to wrangle and chaffer over their property.\r\n\r\nIn one of his conjectures he had been correct. It was little that Ænone\r\nknew or cared about the price she was paying. Had the purse been\r\nreturned to her entirely empty, she would have thrown it unheedingly\r\ninto the drawer, and have never dreamed but that all had been rightly\r\ndone. There was now but one idea filling her heart. She thought not\r\nabout money nor any imprudence which she was committing, nor yet upon\r\nthe chance of recognition. She only reflected that the day of her\r\ntriumph had come--that at the sight of the long-absent lover, Leta would\r\nabandon the wrong path in which she had been straying, would throw\r\nherself into his arms, would tell him how, through the loss of him, she\r\nhad become reckless, and had allowed her suffering mind to become\r\nperverted from the right--but that now all was again well; and thus\r\nconfessing and being forgiven, would, in the ever-present joy of that\r\nforgiveness, lead for the future a different life, and, instead of a\r\nrival, become to her mistress a friend and ally.\r\n\r\nGlowing with this bright hope, Ænone scarcely noticed the shuffling\r\ndeparture of the centurion, but, fixing her eyes upon the captive,\r\nkeenly scrutinized his appearance. Not that it was likely that Leta, in\r\nthe first flush of her joy at meeting him, would notice or care in what\r\nguise he was presented, so long as the soul which had so often\r\nresponded to her own was there. But it was well that there should be\r\nnothing neglected which, without being directly essential to the\r\nproduction of a proper impression, might be tributary to it.\r\n\r\nThe inspection was satisfactory. Not only was the dress of the captive\r\nclean, neat, becoming, and suitable to his station, but his appearance\r\nhad undergone visible improvement since Ænone had last seen him. The\r\nrest and partial composure of even the few intervening days had sufficed\r\nto restore tone to his complexion, roundness to his cheeks, and\r\nsomething of the old merry smile to his eyes. And though complete\r\nrestoration was not yet effected, enough had been accomplished to show\r\nthat there was much latent beauty which would not fail to develop itself\r\nunder the stimulant of additional rest and kindly treatment.\r\n\r\n'Go in, thither,' said Ænone, pointing to the adjoining room, in which\r\nLeta was occupied. 'When you are there, you will--it will be told you\r\nwhat you are to do.'\r\n\r\nCleotos bowed low, and passed through into the other room; and Ænone\r\nfollowed him with a glance which betrayed the longing she felt to enter\r\nwith him and witness the meeting of the two lovers. But a sense of\r\npropriety outweighed her curiosity and restrained her. It was not right,\r\nindeed, that she should intrude. Such recognitions should be sacred to\r\nthe persons directly interested in them. She would therefore remain\r\noutside, and there await Cleotos's return. And as she took into her\r\nhands a little parchment ode which lay upon her table, and nervously\r\nendeavored to interest herself in it, she delightedly pictured the\r\nsudden transport of those within the next room, and the beaming joy with\r\nwhich, hand in hand, they would finally emerge to thank her for their\r\nnewly gained happiness.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Leta, having delivered her message, and received her\r\nrebuke for the interruption, had retired to the other room, and there,\r\nas usual, resumed her daily task of embroidery. Bending low over the\r\nintricate stitches and counting their spaces, her features, at a casual\r\nglance, still bore their impress of meek and unconscious humility, so\r\nfar did her accustomed self-control seem to accompany her even when\r\nalone. But a more attentive scrutiny would have detected, half hidden\r\nbeneath the fringed eyelids, a sparkle of gratified triumph, and, in the\r\nslightly bent corners of the mouth, a shade of haughty disdain; and\r\nlittle by little, as the moments progressed, these indications of an\r\ninner, irrepressible nature gained in intensity, and, as though her\r\nfingers were stayed by a tumult of thought, her work slowly began to\r\nslip from her grasp.\r\n\r\nAt length, lifting her head, and, perhaps, for the first time realizing\r\nthat she was alone and might indulge her impulses without restraint, she\r\nabruptly threw from her the folds of the embroidery, and stood erect.\r\nWhy should she longer trifle with that weak affair of velvet and dyes?\r\nWho was the poor, inanimate, and tearful statue in the next room, to\r\norder her to complete those tasks? What to herself were the past deeds\r\nof the Vanni, that they should be perpetuated in ill-fashioned tapestry,\r\nto be hung around a gilded banquet hall? By the gods! she would from\r\nthat day make a new history in the family life; and it should be\r\nrecorded, not with silken threads upon embroidered velvet, but should be\r\nengraved deeply and ineffaceably upon human hearts!\r\n\r\nStanding motionless in the centre of the room, with one foot upon the\r\nhalf-completed tapestry, she now for the first time, and in a flash of\r\ninspiration, gave shape and comeliness to her previously confusedly\r\narranged ideas. Until the present moment she had had but little thought\r\nof accomplishing anything beyond skilfully availing herself of her\r\nnatural attractions so as to climb from her menial position into\r\nsomething a little better and higher. If, in the struggle to raise\r\nherself from the degradation of slavery, she were obliged to engage in a\r\nrivalry with her mistress, and, by robbing her of the affection\r\nnaturally belonging to her, were to crush her to the earth, it was a\r\nthing to be deplored, but it must none the less be done. She might,\r\nperhaps, pity the victim, but the sacrifice must be accomplished all the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nBut now these vague dreams of a somewhat better lot, to be determined by\r\nfuture chance circumstances, rolled away like a shapeless cloud, and\r\nleft in their place one bright image as the settled object of her\r\nambition. So lofty, so dazzling seemed the prize, that another person\r\nwould have shrunk in dismay from even the thought of striving for it,\r\nand even she, for the moment, recoiled. But she was of too determined a\r\nnature to falter long. The higher the object to be attained the fewer\r\nwould be the competitors, and the greater the chance of success to\r\nunwearying determination. And if there were but one chance of success in\r\na thousand, it were still worth the struggle.\r\n\r\nThis great thought which stimulated her ambition was nothing less than\r\nthe resolution to become the wife of the imperator Sergius. At first it\r\nstartled her with its apparent wild extravagance; but little by little,\r\nas she weighed the chances, it seemed to become more practicable. There\r\nwas, indeed, nothing grossly impossible in the idea. Men of high rank\r\nhad ere now married their slaves, and the corrupted society of Rome had\r\nwinked at mesalliances which, in the days of the republic, would not\r\nhave been tolerated. And she was merely a slave from accidental\r\ncircumstances--being free born, and having, but a month before, been the\r\npride and ornament of a respectable though lowly family. Once let her\r\nliberty be restored, and the scarcely perceptible taint of a few weeks'\r\nserfdom be removed from her, and she would be, in all social respects,\r\nfully the equal of the poor, trembling maid of Ostia, to whom, a few\r\nyears before, the patrician had not been ashamed to stoop.\r\n\r\nThis bar of social inequality thus removed, the rest might be in her own\r\nhands. Sergius no longer felt for his wife the old affection, under the\r\nimpulse of which he had wedded her; and the few poor remains of the love\r\nwhich he still cherished, more from habit than otherwise, were fast\r\ndisappearing. This was already so evident as to have become the common\r\ngossip of even the lowliest slaves in the household. And he loved\r\nherself instead, for not only his actions, but his words had told her\r\nso. A little more craft and plotting, therefore--a little further\r\ndisplay of innocent and lowly meekness and timid obedience--a few more\r\nwell-considered efforts to widen the conjugal breach--a week or two more\r\npersistent exercise of those fascinations which men were so feeble to\r\nresist--jealousy, recrimination, quarrels, and a divorce--and the whole\r\nthing might be accomplished. In those days of laxity, divorce was an\r\neasy matter. In this case there was no family influence upon the part of\r\nthe wife to be set up in opposition--but merely an old centurion,\r\nignorant and powerless. A few writings, for form's sake--and the day\r\nthat sent the weeping wife from the door might install the manumitted\r\nand triumphant slave in her place.\r\n\r\nAll aglow with the ravishing prospect--her eager hopes converting the\r\npossible into the probable, and again, by a rapid change, the probable\r\ninto the certain, the Greek stood spurning the needle work at her feet.\r\nThen glancing around, the whim seized upon her to assume, for a moment\r\nin advance, her coming stately dignity. At the side of the room, upon a\r\nslightly elevated platform, was a crimson lounge--Ænone's especial and\r\nproper seat. Over one arm of this lounge hung, in loose folds, a robe\r\nof purple velvet, with an embroidered fringe of pearls--a kind of cloak\r\nof state, usually worn by her upon the reception of ceremonious visits.\r\nTo this lounge Leta strode, threw herself upon it, drew the velvet\r\ngarment over her shoulders, so that the long folds fell down gracefully\r\nand swept the marble pavement at her feet, and there, half sitting, half\r\nreclining, assumed an attitude of courtly dignity, as though mistress of\r\nthe palace.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be confessed that she well suited the place. With her lithe,\r\ngraceful figure thrown into a position in which the gentle languor of\r\nunembarrassed leisure was mingled with the dignity of queenly\r\nstate--with her burning eyes so tempered in their brilliancy that they\r\nseemed ready at the same instant to bid defiance to impertinent\r\nintrusion, and to bestow gracious condescension upon suppliant\r\ntimidity--with every feature glowing with that proper pride which is not\r\narrogance, and that proper kindliness which is not humility--there was\r\nprobably in all Rome no noble matron who could as well adorn her chair\r\nof ceremony. Beside her, the true mistress of the place would have\r\nappeared as a timid child dismayed with unaccustomed honors; and in\r\ncomparison, the empress herself might not fill her throne in the palace\r\nof the Cæsars with half the grace and dignity.\r\n\r\nThen, as she there sat, momentarily altering her attitude to correspond\r\nthe better with her ideas of proper bearing, and gathering into newer\r\nand more pleasing folds the sweeping breadths of the velvet mantle, the\r\ndoor was slowly swung open, and there glided noiselessly in, clad in its\r\nneat and coarse tunic, the timid figure of her old lover Cleotos.\r\n\r\nFor an instant they remained gazing at each other as though paralyzed.\r\nCleotos--who had looked to see her in her simple white vestment as of\r\nold, and had expected at her first glance to rush to her arms, and there\r\nbe allowed to pour forth his joy at again meeting her, never more to\r\npart--beheld with dismay this gorgeously arrayed and queenly figure.\r\nThis could not be the Leta whom he had known, or, if so, how changed!\r\nWas this the customary attire of slaves in high-placed families? Or\r\ncould it be the token of a guilty favoritism? His heart sank within him;\r\nand he stood nervously clinging against the door behind him, fearing to\r\nadvance, lest, at the first step, some terrible truth, of which he had\r\nalready seemed to feel the premonitions, might burst upon him.\r\n\r\nAnd she, for the moment, sat aghast, not knowing but that the gods, to\r\npunish her pride and ambition, had sent a spectre to confront her. But\r\nbeing of strong mind and but little given to superstitious terrors, she\r\ninstantly reasoned out the facts of his simultaneous captivity with\r\nherself and coincidence of ownership; and her sole remaining doubt was\r\nin what manner she should treat him. They had parted in sorrow and\r\ntears, and she knew that he now expected her to fall into his arms and\r\nthere repeat her former vows of constancy and love. But that could not\r\nbe. Had he come to her but an hour before, while her dreams of the\r\nfuture were of a vague and unsatisfactory character, she might have\r\nacted upon such an impulse. But now, a glorious vision of what might\r\npossibly happen had kindled her ambition with brighter fires than ever\r\nbefore; and could she surrender all that, and think again only upon\r\nstarving freedom in a cottage home?\r\n\r\n'Is it thou, Cleotos? Welcome to Rome!' she said at length, throwing\r\nfrom her shoulder the purple cloak, and approaching him. As she spoke,\r\nshe held out her hand. He took it in his own, in a lifeless and\r\nmechanical sort of way, and gazed into her face with a strange look of\r\ninquiring doubt, which momentarily settled into an expression of deeper\r\napprehension. The blackness of despair began to enter into his soul. Now\r\nthat she was divested of her borrowed richness, she looked more like\r\nherself, and that was surely her voice uttering tones of greeting; but\r\nsomehow her heart did not seem to be in them, and, for a certainty, this\r\nhad not been her wonted style of welcome.\r\n\r\n'I thought,' she continued, 'that thou wert slain. Certainly when I\r\nparted from you ere you fled into the mountains--'\r\n\r\n'You know that I fled not at all,' he interrupted, the color mounting\r\ninto his temples. 'Why do you speak so, Leta? I retired to the mountains\r\nto meet my friends there and with them carry on the defence; and,\r\nprevious thereto, I conducted you to what I believed to be a place of\r\nsafety. And I fought my best against the foe, and was brought nigh unto\r\ndeath. This I did, though I can boast of but a weak and slender frame.\r\nAnd it is hard that the first greeting of one so well loved as you\r\nshould be a taunt.'\r\n\r\n'Nay, forgive me,' she said. 'I doubt not your valor. It was but in\r\nforgetfulness that I spoke. I meant it not for a taunt.' And in truth\r\nshe had not so meant it. It was but the inadvertent expression of a\r\nfeeling which the sight of his feeble and boyish figure unwittingly made\r\nupon her--an incapacity to connect deeds of valor with apparent physical\r\nweakness. But this very inability to judge of his true nature by the\r\nsoul that strove to look into her own rather than by material\r\nimpressions was perhaps no slight proof of the little unison between her\r\nnature and his.\r\n\r\n'Sit down here,' she continued, 'and tell me all that has happened to\r\nyou.' And they sat together, and he briefly told her of his warlike\r\nadventures, his wound, his captivity, his recognition of herself, and\r\nhis successful attempt to be once more under the same roof with her. And\r\nsomehow it still seemed to him that their talk was not as of old, and\r\nthat her sympathy with his misfortunes was but weak and cheerless; and\r\nthough he tried to interweave the customary words of endearment with his\r\nstory, there was a kind of inner check upon him, so that they came not\r\nreadily to his lips as of old. And she sat, trying to listen, and indeed\r\nkeeping the thread of his adventures in her mind; but all the while\r\nfinding her attention fail as she speculated how she could best give\r\nthat explanation of her feelings which she knew would soon be demanded\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n'And here I am at last, Leta--as yourself, a slave!' he concluded.\r\n\r\n'Courage, my friend!' was her answer. 'There are very many degrees and\r\nfates reserved for all in this old Rome, and much for every man to\r\nlearn. And many a one who has begun as a slave has, in the end, attained\r\nnot only to freedom, but to high honor and station.'\r\n\r\n'If the gods were to give me honor and station, far be it from me to\r\nrefuse the gift,' he said. 'But that, of itself alone, would not content\r\nme, unless you were there to share the good with me. And with yourself I\r\nwould crave no other blessing. We are slaves here, Leta, but even that\r\nfate may have its mitigations and happiness for us.'\r\n\r\nShe was silent. How could she tell it to him? But his suspicions, at\r\nfirst vague, were now aroused by her very silence into more certainty.\r\n\r\n'Tell me,' he cried, again taking her hand, 'tell me my fate; and if\r\nsorrow is to come upon me, let it come now. It seems as though there\r\nwere indeed evil tidings in store for me. The blight of anticipated evil\r\neven weighed upon me ere I passed yonder hall, and when I knew no reason\r\nwhy I should not find you loving of heart and humble of desire as in\r\nother days. Is it all gone? Are you no longer the same? This tawdry\r\nvelvet in which I found you arrayed--is it the type of a something\r\nequally foreign to your nature, and which imperial Rome has thrown\r\nabout you to aid in crushing out the better feelings of your heart?'\r\n\r\n'My friend, my brother,' she said at length, with some real pity and\r\nsome false sorrow, 'why have we again met? Why is it now forced upon me\r\nto tell you that the past must always be the past with us?'\r\n\r\nHe dropped her hand, and the tears started into his eyes. Much as the\r\nwords and gestures of the last few minutes had prepared him for the\r\nannouncement, yet when it came, it smote him as though there had been no\r\npremonition of it; so lovingly had his heart persisted in clinging to\r\nthe faint hope that he might have been mistaken. A low wail of anguish\r\nburst from his lips.\r\n\r\n'And this is the end of all?' he sobbed.\r\n\r\n'Think only,' she said, 'think only that I am not worthy of you.'\r\n\r\n'The old story--the old story which has been repeated from the beginning\r\nof the world,' he cried, stung into life by something of heartlessness\r\nwhich he detected in her affected sympathy. 'The woman weaves her toils\r\nabout the man--gilds his life until there is no brightness which can\r\ncompare with it--fills his heart with high hopes of a blissful\r\nfuture--so changes his soul that he can cherish no thought but of\r\nher--so alters the whole tenor and purpose of his existence that he even\r\nwelcomes slavery as a precious boon because it brings him under the same\r\nroof with her. And then--some other fancy having crossed her mind--or an\r\nabsence of a week or two having produced forgetfulness--she insults him\r\nwith a cruel mockery of self-unworthiness as her sole apology for\r\nperfidy.'\r\n\r\n'Nay,' she exclaimed, half glad of an excuse to quarrel with him. 'If\r\nyou would rather have it otherwise, think, then, that I have never loved\r\nyou as I should, even though I may have imagined that I did.'\r\n\r\n'Go on,' he said, seeing that she hesitated.\r\n\r\n'I know,' she continued, 'that in other days you have had my words for\r\nit, uttered, indeed, in sympathy and truth, as I then felt them. But I\r\nwas a simple girl, then, Cleotos. The sea before me and the mountains\r\nbehind bounded all my knowledge of the world. The people whom I saw were\r\nbut few. The tastes I had were simple. Is it wonderful that I should\r\nhave listened to the first one who spoke to me of love, and should have\r\nimagined that my heart made response to him? But now, now, Cleotos--'\r\n\r\n'Now, what?' he exclaimed. 'Would you say that now you have seen the\r\nworld better and think differently? What is there in all that you have\r\nsince known that should change you? Is it that the sight of war and\r\ntumult--of burning towns and bleeding captives--of insolent soldiers and\r\ncruel taskmasters can have made you less in favor with our own native,\r\nvine-covered retreat, with its neighborhood of simple peasantry? Or\r\nwould you say that since then you have met others whom you can love\r\nbetter than me? Whom, indeed, have you seen but weary prisoners like\r\nmyself, or else unpitying conquerors whose love would be your shame? You\r\nblush, Leta! Pray the gods that it be not the latter! Struggle sternly\r\nwith yourself to realize that you are merely for the moment fascinated\r\nby the unaccustomed splendors of this swarming city; and that after its\r\nfirst brightness has worn off from your dazzled eyes, your soul may\r\nreturn to its native, pure simplicity and innocence, and--and to me.'\r\n\r\n'Speak not so, Cleotos,' she responded. 'My eyes are not dazzled with\r\nany splendors; but for all that, our ways now and forever lie in\r\ndifferent directions. We are slaves, and can give little heed to our\r\naffections. Our only course must be for each to strive to rise above\r\nthis serfdom; and if, in doing so, either can help the other, it must\r\nbe done--but in friendship, not in love. To you, through good conduct,\r\nthere may open, even in slavery, many posts of influence and profit;\r\nand, in so much, of better worth than our own boasted liberty with\r\npoverty. And as for me--I see my destiny already beckoning me to a\r\nposition such as many a free Roman woman might envy.'\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus obscurely of her anticipated grandeur--to be gained,\r\nperhaps, by abasement, but none the less in her mind certain to end in\r\nsuch legitimate position as might sanctify the previous steps\r\nthereto--her face again lit up with a glow of pride, as though she were\r\nalready the powerful patrician's wife. And revelling in such dreams, she\r\nsaw not the agony which overspread her listener's face as he read her\r\nthoughts partly awrong, and believed her content to throw herself away\r\nforever, in order to gain some temporary exaltation as a wealthy Roman's\r\nplaything.\r\n\r\n'And when that day does come,' she continued, 'if, for the memory of our\r\nold friendship, I can help to elevate you to some better sphere--'\r\n\r\n'Enough! No more!' he cried bitterly; and starting from her, he fled out\r\nof the room. It were hard enough that he should lose her, harder yet\r\nthat he should hear her marking out for herself a life of ruin for some\r\ntemporary gain, but harder than all, that she should dare to mistake his\r\nnature so far as to insult him with the promise of aiding his prosperity\r\nthrough such an influence.\r\n\r\n'Let me go hence!' he cried, in his agony, to Ænone, who, still radiant\r\nwith her newly discovered hope, met him at the door. 'Send me to the\r\ncaptain Polidorus--anywhere--only let me leave this house!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SLAVERY AND FINANCES.\r\n\r\nBy Hon. Robert J. Walker.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The following article, from the pen of Hon. R. J. Walker, forms\r\n     the APPENDIX to the volume just published in England, and\r\n     now exciting great attention there, containing the various\r\n     pamphlets issued by him during the last six months. The subjects\r\n     discussed embrace Jefferson Davis and Repudiation, Recognition,\r\n     Slavery, Finances and Resources of the United States. It would be\r\n     difficult to overestimate the effect of these Letters abroad. As\r\n     our readers already possess them in the pages of THE\r\n     CONTINENTAL, we enable them to complete the series by\r\n     furnishing the ensuing Appendix. It closes with an extract from an\r\n     'Introductory Address' delivered by Mr. Walker before the National\r\n     Institute, at Washington, D. C., giving a short account of the\r\n     various improvements and discoveries made by our countrymen in the\r\n     Inductive Sciences. As showing to England what a high rank we had\r\n     even then taken in the world of science, and pointing out to her\r\n     the number and fame of our savants, it will be read with just pride\r\n     and interest. As the Address was delivered in 1844, it of course\r\n     contains no details of our marvellous progress since that date in\r\n     science and discovery.--ED. CONTINENTAL.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen by the Census Tables, if the product _per capita_ of the\r\nSlave States in 1859 had been equal to that of the Free States for that\r\nyear, that the ADDITIONAL value produced in 1859 in the Slave\r\nStates would have been $1,531,631,000. Now as our population augmented\r\nduring that decade 35.59 per cent., this _increased_ value, at that\r\nratio, in 1869 would have been $2,052,332,272. If multiplying the amount\r\n_each year_ by three only, instead of 3-559/1000 the result, during that\r\ndecade, would have been as follows:\r\n\r\n  Product of 1860, $1,559,039,962\r\n       \"     1861,  1,605,811,060\r\n       \"     1862,  1,654,085,391\r\n       \"     1863,  1,703,707,952\r\n       \"     1864,  1,754,819,198\r\n       \"     1865,  1,807,464,773\r\n       \"     1866,  1,861,688,716\r\n       \"     1867,  1,917,539,377\r\n       \"     1868,  1,975,065,558\r\n       \"     1869,  2,034,317,524\r\n                    -------------\r\n  Total augmented\r\n  product of the  $17,873,539,511\r\n  decade\r\n\r\nThat is, the total _increased_ product of the Slave States, during the\r\ndecade from 1859 to 1869, would have been $17,873,539,511, if the\r\nproduction in the Slave States had been equal, _per capita_, to that of\r\nthe Free States. This, it will be remembered, is gross product. This, it\r\nwill be perceived, is far below the actual result, as we can see by\r\ncomparing the real product of 1869, $2,052,332,272, as before given,\r\nwith the $2,034,317,524, as the result of a multiplication by three each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the increase of our _wealth_, from 1850 to 1860, as shown\r\nby the census, was much greater than that of our population--namely,\r\n126.45 per cent. Multiplying by this ratio (126.45), the result would be\r\nan _additional_ product in 1860, in the Slave States, of $3,427,619,475.\r\nBut our wealth increases in an augmented ratio during each decade.\r\n\r\nThus, the ratio of the increase of our wealth, as shown by the census,\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n  From 1820 to 1830, 41 per cent.\r\n   \"   1830 to 1840, 42     \"\r\n   \"   1840 to 1850, 64     \"\r\n   \"   1850 to 1860, 126.45 \"\r\n\r\nThus, the increase of our wealth from 1840 to 1850, was more than 50 per\r\ncent. greater than from 1830 to 1840; and from 1850 to 1860, nearly\r\ndouble that from 1840 to 1850. At the same duplicate ratio, from 1850 to\r\n1870, the result would be over 250 per cent. That such would have been a\r\nclose approximation to the true result, is rendered still more probable\r\nby the fact, that the product of 1859, as shown by the census, was 250\r\nper cent. greater than that of 1849.\r\n\r\nIf, then, instead of 126.45 per cent., we were to assume 250 per cent.\r\nas the ratio, the result would be in 1869, $5,297,708,612, as the\r\n_increased_ product of the Slave States that year, if the ratio _per\r\ncapita_ were equal to that of the Free States. If we carry out these\r\nratios from 1859 to 1869, either of 126.45, or of 250, into the\r\naggregate of the decade, the results are startling. Assuming, however,\r\nthat of the population only, we have seen that the aggregate result in\r\nthe decade from 1859 to 1869 was over seventeen billions of dollars, or\r\nlargely more than ten times our debt incurred by this rebellion.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, I reassert the opinion, heretofore expressed by me, that as\r\nthe result of the superiority of free over slave labor, our wealth in\r\n1870, and especially in each succeeding decade, as a consequence of the\r\nentire abolition of Slavery in the United States, will be far greater,\r\nnotwithstanding the debt, than if the rebellion had never occurred,\r\nthere is here presented conclusive official proof of the truth of this\r\nstatement. We have seen that our wealth increased from 1850 to 1860,\r\n126.45 per cent., whilst that of England, from 1851 to 1861, augmented\r\nonly at the rate of 37 per cent.\r\n\r\nApplying these several ratios to the progress of the wealth of the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States, respectively, in 1870, 1880, 1890,\r\nand 1900, the result is given below.\r\n\r\nWe have seen by the census, that our national wealth was, in\r\n\r\n  1850,   $7,135,780,228\r\n  1860,   16,159,616,068\r\n\r\nIncrease from 1850 to 1860, 126.45 per cent.\r\n\r\nEngland, from 1851 to 1861, 37 per cent.\r\n\r\nAssuming these ratios, the result would be as follows:\r\n\r\n  UNITED KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n  1861, wealth, $31,500,000,000\r\n  1871,   \"      48,155,000,000\r\n  1881,   \"      59,122,350,000\r\n  1891,   \"      80,997,619,500\r\n  1901,   \"     110,966,837,715\r\n\r\n\r\n  UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n  1860, wealth, $16,159,616,068\r\n  1870,   \"      36,593,450,585\r\n  1880,   \"      82,865,868,849\r\n  1890,   \"     187,314,353,225\r\n  1900,   \"     423,330,438,288\r\n\r\nThus, it appears by the census of each nation, that, each increasing in\r\nthe same ratio respectively as for the last decade, the wealth of the\r\nUnited States in 1880 would exceed that of the United Kingdom\r\n$23,743,518,849; that in 1890 it would be much more than double, and in\r\n1900, approaching quadruple that of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that England increases in wealth much more rapidly than\r\nany other country of Europe, the value of these statistics may be\r\nestimated, as proving how readily our national debt can be extinguished\r\nwithout oppressive taxation.\r\n\r\nThese are the results, founded on the actual statistics, without\r\nestimating the enormous increase of our national wealth, arising from\r\nthe abolition of Slavery. We have seen that, by the official tables of\r\nthe census of 1860, the value of the _products_ of the United States, so\r\nfar as given, for the year 1859, was $5,290,000,000. But this is very\r\nshort of the actual result. The official report (pages 59, 190, 198 to\r\n210) shows that this included _only_ the products of 'agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, mines, and fisheries.' In referring to the result as to\r\n'_manufactures_,' at page 59 of his official report before given, the\r\nSuperintendent says: 'If to this amount were added the very large\r\naggregate of mechanical productions below the annual value of $500, of\r\nwhich no official cognizance is taken, the result would be one of\r\n_startling magnitude_.'\r\n\r\n1. This omission alone, for gross product, is estimated at $500,000,000.\r\n\r\n2. Milk and eggs, fodder, wood, poultry, and feathers, omitted, gross\r\nproducts, estimated at $350,000,000.\r\n\r\n3. Gross earnings of trade and commerce, including freights, &c., by\r\nland and water, $1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n4. Gross earnings of all other pursuits and business, including all\r\nother omissions, $1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nTotal gross products of 1860, as thus estimated, $8,140,000,000, of\r\nwhich the amount for the Free States, as estimated, is $6,558,334,000,\r\nand for the Slave States, $1,581,666,000.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore referred to the vast influence of _education_ as one\r\nof the principal causes of the greater product _per capita_ in the Free\r\nthan in the Slave States, of the much larger number of patents, of\r\ninventions, and discoveries, in the former than in the latter.\r\n\r\nAt the April meeting of 1844, upon the request of the Society, I\r\ndelivered at Washington (D. C.) the Introductory Address for the\r\nNational Institute, in which, up to that date, an account was given by\r\nme of 'the various improvements and discoveries made by our countrymen\r\nin the inductive sciences.' On reference to that address, which was\r\npublished at its date (April, 1844), with their _bulletin_, it will be\r\nseen that, from the great Franklin down to Kinnersley, Fitch, Rumsey,\r\nFulton, Evans, Rush, the Stevenses of New Jersey, Whitney, Godfrey,\r\nRittenhouse, Silliman, J. Q. Adams, Cleveland, Adrain, Bowditch, Hare,\r\nBache, Henry, Pierce, Espy, Patterson, Nulty, Morse, Walker, Loomis,\r\nRogers, Saxton, and many others; these men, with scarcely an exception,\r\nwere from the Free States.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, of electricity. This has been cultivated with the greatest\r\nsuccess in our country, from the time when Franklin with his kite drew\r\ndown electricity from the thunder cloud, to that when Henry showed the\r\nelectrical currents produced by the distant lightning discharge. In\r\nFranklin's day the idea prevailed that there were two kinds of\r\nelectricity, one produced by rubbing vitreous substances, the other by\r\nthe friction of resinous bodies. Franklin's theory of one electric fluid\r\nin all bodies, disturbed in its equilibrium by friction, and thus\r\naccumulating in one and deserting the other, maintains its ground, still\r\ncapable of explaining the facts elicited in the progress of modern\r\ndiscovery. Franklin believed that electricity and lightning were the\r\nsame, and proceeded to the proof. He made the perilous experiment, by\r\nexploring the air with a kite, and drawing down from the thunder cloud\r\nthe lightning's discharge upon his own person. The bold philosopher\r\nreceived unharmed the shock of the electric fluid, more fortunate than\r\nothers who have fallen victims to less daring experiments. The world was\r\ndelighted with the discoveries of the great American, and for a time\r\nelectricity was called Franklinism on the continent of Europe; but\r\nFranklin was born here, and the name was not adopted in England. While\r\nFranklin made experiments, Kinnersley exhibited and illustrated them,\r\nand also rediscovered the seemingly opposite electricities of glass and\r\nresin. Franklin's lightning rod is gradually surmounting the many\r\ndifficulties with which it contended, as experience attests the greater\r\nsafety of houses protected by the rod, properly mounted, whilst the\r\nBritish attempt to substitute balls for points has failed. This\r\nquestion, as to powder magazines, has lately excited much controversy.\r\nShould a rod be attached to the magazine, or should it be placed upon a\r\npost at some distance? This question has been solved by Henry. When an\r\nelectrical discharge passes from one body to another, the electricity in\r\nall the bodies in the neighborhood is affected. Henry magnetized a\r\nneedle in a long conductor, by the discharge from a cloud, more than a\r\nmile from the conductor. If a discharge passes down a rod, attached to a\r\npowder house, may it not cause a spark to pass from one receptacle for\r\npowder to another, and thus inflame the whole? The electrical plenum,\r\nwhich Henry supposed, is no doubt disturbed, and to great distances; but\r\nthe effect diminishes with the distance. If all the principal conductors\r\nabout a building can be connected with a lightning rod, there is no\r\ndanger of a discharge; for it is only in leaving or entering a conductor\r\nthat electricity produces heating effects; but if not, the rod is safer\r\nat a moderate distance from the building. The rate at which electricity\r\nmoved was another of the experiments of Franklin. A wire was led over a\r\ngreat extent of ground, and a discharge passed through it. No interval\r\ncould be perceived between the time of the spark passing to and from the\r\nwire at the two ends. Not long since, Wheatston of England, aided by our\r\nown great mechanic, Saxton, solved the problem. This has induced Arago,\r\nof France, to propose to test the rival theories of light, by similar\r\nmeans--to measure thus a velocity, to detect which has heretofore\r\nrequired a motion over the line of the diameter of the earth's orbit.\r\n\r\nIn galvanism, our countrymen have made many important discoveries. Dr.\r\nHare invented instruments of such great power as well to deserve the\r\nnames of calorimeter and deflagrator. The most refractory substances\r\nyielded to the action of the deflagrator, melting like wax before a\r\ncommon fire. Even charcoal was supposed to be fused in the experiments\r\nof Hare and Silliman, and the visionary speculated on the possibility of\r\nblack as well as white diamonds. Draper, by his most ingenious galvanic\r\nbattery, of two metals and two liquids, with one set of elements, in a\r\nglass tube not the size of the little finger, was able to decompose\r\nwater. Faraday, of England, discovered the principle, that when a\r\ncurrent of electricity is set in motion, or stopped in a conductor, a\r\nneighboring conductor has a current produced in the opposite direction.\r\nHenry proved that this principle might be made available to produce an\r\naction of a current upon itself, by forming a conductor in the whirls of\r\na spiral, so that sparks and shocks might be obtained by the use of such\r\nspirals, when connected with a pair of galvanic plates, a current from\r\nwhich could give no sparks and no shocks. Henry's discoveries of the\r\neffects of a current in producing several alternations in currents in\r\nneighboring conductors--the change of the quality of electricity which\r\ngives shocks to the muscles into that producing heat, and _vice\r\nversa_--his mode of graduating these shocks--his theoretical\r\ninvestigations into the causes of these alternations--are abstruse, but\r\nadmirable; and his papers have been republished throughout Europe. The\r\nheating effects of a galvanic current have been applied by Dr. Hare to\r\nblasting. The accidents which so often happen in quarries may be avoided\r\nby firing the charge from a distance, as the current which heats the\r\nwire, passing through the charge, may be conveyed, without perceptible\r\ndiminution, through long distances. A feeble attempt to attribute this\r\nimportant invention of Dr. Hare to Colonel Pasley, an English engineer,\r\nhas been abandoned. This is the marvellous agent by which our eminent\r\ncountryman, Morse, encouraged by an appropriation made by Congress,\r\nwill, by means of his electric telegraph, soon communicate information\r\nforty miles, from Washington to Baltimore, more rapidly than by\r\nwhispering in the ear of a friend sitting near us. A telegraph on a new\r\nplan at that time, invented by Mr. Grout, of Massachusetts, in 1799,\r\nasked a question and received an answer in less than ten minutes through\r\na distance of ninety miles. The telegraph of Mr. Morse will prove, I\r\nthink, superior to all others; and the day is not distant when, by its\r\naid, we may perhaps ask questions and receive replies across our\r\ncontinent, from _ocean to ocean_, thus uniting with steam in enlarging\r\nthe limits over which our Republic may be safely extended.[2]\r\n\r\nMany of our countrymen have contributed to the branch which regards the\r\naction of electrified and magnetic bodies. Lukens's application of\r\nmagnetism to steel (called _touching_), the compass of Bissel for\r\ndetecting local attraction, of Burt for determining the variation of the\r\ncompass, and the observations on the variations of the needle made by\r\nWinthrop and Dewitt, deserve notice and commendation. Not long since,\r\nGauss, of Germany, invented instruments by which the changes of magnetic\r\nvariation and force could be accurately determined. Magnetic action is\r\never varying. The needle does not point in the same direction for even a\r\nfew minutes together. The force of magnetism, also, perpetually varies.\r\n'True as the needle to the pole' is not a correct simile for the same\r\nplace, and, if we pass from one spot to another, is falsified at each\r\nchange of our position; for the needle changes its direction, and the\r\nforce varies. Enlarged and united observations, embracing the various\r\nportions of the world, must produce important results. The observations\r\nat Philadelphia, conducted by Dr. A. D. Bache, and now continued by him\r\nunder the direction of the Topographical Bureau, are of great value, and\r\nwill, it is hoped, be published by Congress. Part of them have already\r\nfirst seen the light in Europe--a result much to be regretted, for we\r\nare not strong enough in science to spare from the national records the\r\ncontributions of our countrymen.\r\n\r\nThese combined observations, progressing throughout the world, are of\r\nthe highest importance. The University of Cambridge, the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, and Girard College have erected observatories;\r\nand one connected with the Depot of Charts and Instruments has been\r\nbuilt in this city last year by the Government, and thoroughly furnished\r\nwith instruments for complete observations. The names of Bache, Gillis,\r\nPierce, Lovering, and Bond are well known in connection with these\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nA magnetic survey of Pennsylvania has been made by private enterprise,\r\nand the beginning of a survey in New York. Loomis has observed in Ohio,\r\nLocke in Ohio and Iowa, and to him belongs the discovery of the position\r\nof the point of greatest magnetic intensity in the Western World. Most\r\ninteresting magnetic observations (now in progress of publication by\r\nCongress) are the result of the toilsome, perilous, and successful\r\nexpedition, under Commander Wilkes, of our navy, by whom was discovered\r\nthe Antarctic continent, and a portion of its soil and rock brought home\r\nto our country.\r\n\r\nThe analogy of the auroral displays with those of electricity in motion,\r\nwas first pointed out by Dr. A. D. Bache, whose researches, in\r\nconjunction with Lloyd of Dublin, to determine whether differences of\r\nlongitude could be measured by the observations of small simultaneous\r\nchanges in the position of the magnetic needle, led to the knowledge of\r\nthe curious fact, that these changes, which had been traced as\r\nsimultaneous, or nearly so, in the continent of Europe, did not so\r\nextend across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nKindred to these two branches are electro-magnetism and\r\nmagneto-electricity, connected with which, as discoverers, are our\r\ncountrymen Dana, Green, Hare, Henry, Page, Rogers, and Saxton. The\r\nreciprocal machine for producing shocks, invented by Page, and the\r\npowerful galvanic magnet of Henry, are entitled to respectful notice.\r\nThis force, it was thought, might be substituted for steam; but no\r\nexperiments have as yet established its use, on any important scale, as\r\na motive power. The fact that an electrical spark could be produced by a\r\npeculiar arrangement of a coil of wire, connected with a magnet, is a\r\nrecent discovery; and the first magneto-electric machine capable of\r\nkeeping up a continuous current was invented by Saxton.\r\n\r\nElectricity and magnetism touch in some points upon heat. Heat produces\r\nelectrical currents; electrical currents produce heat. Heat destroys\r\nmagnetism. Melted iron is incapable of magnetic influence. Reduction of\r\ntemperature in iron so far decreases the force, that a celebrated\r\nphilosopher made an elaborate series of experiments to ascertain whether\r\na great reduction of temperature might not develop magnetic properties\r\nin metals other than iron. This branch of thermo-electricity has\r\nreceived from us but little attention. Franklin's experiments, by\r\nplacing differently colored cloths in the snow, and showing the depth to\r\nwhich they sank, are still quoted, and great praise has been bestowed\r\nabroad on a more elaborate series of experiments, by a descendant of\r\nhis, Dr. A. D. Bache, proving that this law does not hold good as to\r\nheat, unaccompanied by light. The experiments of Saxon and Goddard\r\ndemonstrate that solid bodies do slowly evaporate. It is proper here to\r\nmention our countryman, Count Rumford, whose discoveries as to the\r\nnature and properties of heat, improvement in stoves and gunnery, and in\r\nthe structure of chimneys and economy of fuel, have been so great and\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nLight accompanies heat of a certain temperature. That it acts directly\r\nto increase or decrease magnetic force, is not yet proved; and the\r\ninteresting experiments made by Dr. Draper, in Virginia, go to show that\r\nit is without magnetic influence. The discussion of this subject forms,\r\nthe branch of optics, touching physical science on the one side, the\r\nmost refined, and the highest range of mathematics on the other.\r\nRittenhouse first suggested the true explanation of the experiment, of\r\nthe apparent conversion of a cameo into an intaglio, when viewed through\r\na compound microscope, and anticipated many years Brewster's theory.\r\nHopkinson wrote well on the experiment made by looking at a street lamp\r\nthrough a slight texture of silk. Joscelyn, of New York, investigated\r\nthe causes of the irradiation manifested by luminous bodies, as for\r\ninstance the stars. Of late, photographic experiments have occupied much\r\nattention, and Draper has advanced the bold idea, supported by\r\nexperiment, that the agent in the so-called photography, is not light,\r\nnor heat, but an agent differing from any other known principle. Henry\r\nhas investigated the luminous emanation from lime, calcined with\r\nsulphur, and certain other substances, and finds that it differs much\r\nfrom light in some of its qualities.\r\n\r\nAstronomy is the most ancient and highest branch of physics. One of our\r\nearliest and greatest efforts in this branch was the invention of the\r\nmariner's quadrant, by Godfrey, a glazier of Philadelphia. The transit\r\nof Venus, in the last century, called forth the researches of\r\nRittenhouse, Owen, Biddle, and President Smith, near Philadelphia, and\r\nof Winthrop, at Boston. Two orreries were made by Rittenhouse, as also a\r\nmachine for predicting eclipses. Most useful observations, connected\r\nwith the solar eclipses, from 1832 to 1840, have been made by Paine, of\r\nBoston. We have now well-supplied observatories at West Point,\r\nWashington, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Hudson, Ohio, and Tuskaloosa,\r\nAlabama; and the valuable labors of Loomis, Bartlett, Gillis, Bond,\r\nPierce, Walker, and Kendall are well known. Mr. Adams, so distinguished\r\nin this branch and that of weights and measures, laid last year the\r\ncorner stone of an observatory at Cincinnati, where will soon be one of\r\nthe largest and most powerful telescopes in the world. Most interesting\r\nobservations as to the great comet of 1843 were made by Alexander,\r\nAnderson, Bartlett, Kendall, Pierce, Walker, Downes, and Loomis, and\r\nvaluable astronomical instruments have been constructed by Amasa\r\nHolcomb, of Massachusetts, and Wm. J. Young, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to class the brilliant meteors of November the 13th,\r\n1833. If such meteors are periodic, the discovery was made by Professor\r\nOlmsted; and Mr. Herrick, of New Haven, has added valuable suggestions.\r\nThe idea that observers, differently placed at the time of appearance\r\nand disappearance of the same meteor, would give the means of\r\ndetermining differences of longitude, was first applied in our own\r\ncountry, where the difference of longitude of Princeton and Philadelphia\r\nwas determined by observations of Henry and Alexander, Espy and Bache.\r\nIn meteorology our countrymen have succeeded well. Dr. Wells, of South\r\nCarolina, elaborated his beautiful and original theory of the formation\r\nof dew, and supported it by many well-devised and conclusive\r\nexperiments. The series of hourly observations, by Professor Snell and\r\nCaptain Mordecai, are well known; and the efforts of New York and\r\nPennsylvania, of the medical department of the army, and its present\r\nenlightened head, Dr. Lawson, have much advanced this branch of science.\r\nThe interesting question, Does our climate change? seems to be answered\r\nthus far in the negative, by registers kept in Massachusetts and New\r\nYork. There are two rival theories of storms. That of Redfield, of a\r\nrotary motion of a wide column of air, combined with a progressive\r\nmotion in a curved line. Espy builds on the law of physics, examines the\r\naction of an upmoving column of air, shows the causes of its motion and\r\nthe results, and then deduces his most beautiful theory of rain and of\r\nland and water spouts. This he puts to the test of observation; and in\r\nthe inward motion of wind toward the centre of storms, finds a striking\r\nverification of his theory. This theory is also sustained by the\r\noverthrow or injury, in the recent tornado at Natchez, of the houses\r\nwhose doors and windows were closed, while those which were open mostly\r\nescaped unhurt. Mr. Espy must be considered, not only here, but\r\nthroughout the world, as at the head of this branch of science. This\r\nsubject has been greatly advanced by Professor Loomis, whose paper has\r\nbeen pronounced, by the highest authority, to be the best specimen of\r\ninductive reasoning which meteorology has produced. The most recent and\r\nhighly valuable meteorological works of Dr. Samuel Forry are much\r\nesteemed. Many important discoveries in pneumatics were made by Dr.\r\nFranklin and Count Rumford, and the air pump was also greatly improved\r\nby Dr. Prince, of Salem.\r\n\r\nChemistry, in all its departments, has been successfully pursued among\r\nus. Dana, Draper, Ellet, Emmet, Hare, the Mitchells, Silliman, and\r\nTorrey, are well known as chemical philosophers; and Booth, Boyé,\r\nChilton, Keating, Mather, R. Rogers, Seybert, Shepherd, and Vanuxen, as\r\n_analysts_; and F. Bache, Webster, Greene, Mitchell, Silliman, and Hare,\r\nas authors. In my native town of Northumberland, Pennsylvania, resided\r\ntwo adopted citizens, most eminent as chemists and philosophers,\r\nPriestley and Cooper. The latter, who was one of my own preceptors, was\r\ngreatly distinguished as a writer, scholar, jurist, and physician, as\r\nwell as a chemist. Priestley, although I do not concur in his peculiar\r\nviews of theology, was certainly one of the most able and learned of\r\necclesiastical writers, and possessed also a mind most vigorous and\r\noriginal. His discoveries in pneumatic chemistry have exceeded those of\r\nany other philosopher. He discovered vital air, many new acids, chemical\r\nsubstances, paints, and dyes. He separated nitrous and oxygenous airs,\r\nand first exhibited acids and alkalies in a gaseous form. He ascertained\r\nthat air could be purified by the process of vegetation, and that light\r\nevolved pure air from vegetables. He detected the powerful action of\r\noxygenous air upon the blood, and first pointed out the true theory of\r\nrespiration. The eudiometer, a most curious instrument for fixing the\r\npurity of air, by measuring the proportion of oxygen, was discovered by\r\nDr. Priestley. He lived and died in my native town, universally beloved\r\nas a man, and greatly admired as a philosopher. Chemistry has actively\r\nadvanced among us during the present century. Hare's compound blowpipe\r\ncame from his hand so perfect, in 1802, that all succeeding attempts of\r\nDr. Clark, of England, and of all others, in Europe and America, to\r\nimprove upon it or go beyond the effects produced, have wholly failed.\r\nHis mode of mixing oxygen and hydrogen gases, the instant before burning\r\nthem, was at once simple, effective, and safe. The most refractory\r\nmetallic and mineral substances yielded to the intense heat produced by\r\nthe flame of the blowpipe. In chemical analysis, the useful labors of\r\nKeating, Vanuxen, Seybert, Booth, Clemson, Litton, and Moss, would fill\r\nmany volumes. In organic chemistry, the researches of Clark, Hare, and\r\nBoyé were rewarded by the discovery of a new ether, the most explosive\r\ncompound known to man. Mitchell's experiments on the penetration of\r\nmembranes by gases, and the ingenious extension of them by Dr. Rogers,\r\nare worthy of all praise. The softening of indiarubber, by Dr. Mitchell,\r\nrenders it a most useful article. Dyer's discovery of soda ash yielded\r\nhim a competence. Our countrymen have also made most valuable\r\nimprovements in refining sugar, in the manufacture of lard oil and\r\nstearin candles, and the preservation of timber by Earle's process.\r\nSugar and molasses have been extracted in our country from the\r\ncornstalk, but with what, if any profit, as to either, is not yet\r\ndetermined. No part of mechanics has produced such surprising results as\r\nthe steam engine, and our countrymen have been among the foremost and\r\nmost distinguished in this great and progressive branch. When Rumsey, of\r\nPennsylvania, made a steamboat, which moved against the current of the\r\nJames River four miles an hour, his achievement was so much in advance\r\nof the age, as to acquire no public confidence. When John Fitch's boat\r\nstemmed the current of the Delaware, contending successfully with sail\r\nboats, it was called, in derision, the _scheme boat_. So the New\r\nYorkers, when the steamboat of their own truly great mechanic, Stevens,\r\nafter making a trip from Hoboken, burnt accidentally one of its boiler\r\ntubes, it was proclaimed a failure. Fulton also encountered unbounded\r\nridicule and opposition, as he advanced to confer the greatest benefits\r\non mankind by the application of steam to navigation. So Oliver Evans,\r\nof Pennsylvania (who has made such useful improvements in the flour\r\nmill), was pronounced insane, when he applied to the Legislatures of\r\nPennsylvania and Maryland for special privileges in regard to the\r\napplication of steam to locomotion on common roads. In 1810 he was\r\nescorted by a mob of boys, when his amphibolas was moved on wheels by\r\nsteam more than a mile through the streets of Philadelphia to the river\r\nSchuylkill, and there, taking to the water, was paddled by steam to the\r\nwharves of the Delaware, where it was to work as a dredging machine.\r\nFulton's was the first successful steamboat, Stevens's the first that\r\nnavigated the ocean, Oliver Evans's the first high-pressure engine\r\napplied to steam navigation. Stevens's boat, by an accident, did not\r\nprecede Fulton's, and Stevens's engine was wholly American, and\r\nconstructed entirely by himself, and his propeller resembled much that\r\nnow introduced by Ericsson. Stevens united the highest mechanical skill\r\nwith a bold, original, inventive genius. His sons (especially Mr. Robert\r\nL. Stevens, of New York) have inherited much of the extraordinary skill\r\nand talent of their distinguished father. The first steamboat that ever\r\ncrossed the ocean was built by one of our countrymen, and their skill in\r\nnaval architecture has been put in requisition by the Emperor of Russia\r\nand the Sultan of Turkey. The steam machines invented by our countrymen\r\nto drive piles, load vessels, and excavate roads, are most ingenious and\r\nuseful. The use of steam, as a locomotive power, upon the water and the\r\nland, is admirably adapted to our mighty rivers and extended territory.\r\nFrom Washington to the mouth of the Oregon is but one half,[3] and to\r\nthe mouth of the Del Norte but one fourth, of the distance of the\r\nrailroads already constructed here; and to the latter point, at the rate\r\nof motion (thirty miles an hour) now in daily use abroad, the trip would\r\nbe performed in two days, and to the former in four days. Thus, steam,\r\nif we measure distance by the time in which it is traversed, renders our\r\nwhole Union, with its most extended limits, smaller than was the State\r\nof New York ten years since. Steam cars have been moved, as an\r\nexperiment, both here and abroad, many hundred miles, at the rate of\r\nsixty miles an hour; but what will be the highest velocity ultimately\r\nattained in common use, either upon the water or the land, is a most\r\nimportant problem, as yet entirely unsolved. Our respected citizens,\r\nMorey and Drake, have endeavored to substitute the force of explosion of\r\ngaseous compounds for steam. The first was the pioneer, and the second\r\nhas shown that the problem is still worth pursuing to solution. An\r\nenergetic Western mechanic made a bold but unsuccessful effort to put in\r\noperation an engine acting by the expansion of air by heat; and a\r\nsimilar most ingenious attempt was made by Mr. Walter Byrnes, of\r\nConcordia, Louisiana; as also to substitute compressed air, and air\r\ncompressed and expanded, as a locomotive power. All attempts to use air\r\nas a motive power, except the balloon, the sail vessel, the air gun, and\r\nthe windmill, have thus far failed; but what inventive genius may yet\r\naccomplish in this respect, remains yet undetermined. There is, it is\r\ntrue, a mile or more of pneumatic railway used between Dublin and\r\nKingstown. An air pump, driven by steam, exhausts the air from a\r\ncylinder in which a piston moves; this cylinder is laid the whole length\r\nof the road, and the piston is connected to a car above, so that, as the\r\npiston moves forward on the exhaustion of the air in front of it, the\r\ncar is also carried forward. The original idea of this pneumatic railway\r\nwas derived from the contrivance of an American, quite unknown to fame,\r\nwho, as his sign expressed it, showed to visitors a new mode of carrying\r\nthe mail,[4] more simple, and quite as valuable, practically, as this\r\natmospheric railway. The submerged propeller of Ericsson, and the\r\nsubmerged paddle wheel, the rival experiments of our two distinguished\r\nnaval officers, Stockton and Hunter, are now candidates for public\r\nfavor; and the Princeton on the ocean, as she moves in noiseless\r\nmajesty, at a speed never before attained at sea, seems to attest the\r\nvalue of one of these experiments, while the other is yet to be\r\ndetermined. The impenetrable iron steam vessel of Mr. Stevens is not yet\r\ncompleted, nor have those terrific engines of war, his explosive shells,\r\nyet been brought to the test of actual conflict.\r\n\r\nIn curious and useful mechanical inventions, our countrymen are\r\nunsurpassed, and a visit to our new and beautiful Patent Office will\r\nconvince the close observer that the inventive genius of America never\r\nwas more active than at the present moment. The machines for working up\r\ncotton, hemp, and wool, from their most crude state to the finest and\r\nmost useful fabrics, have all been improved among us. The cotton gin of\r\nEli Whitney has altered the destinies of one third of our country, and\r\ndoubled the exports of the Union. The ingenious improvements for\r\nimitating medals, by parallel lines upon a plain surface, which, by the\r\ndistances between them, give all the effects of light and shade that\r\nbelong to a raised or depressed surface, invented by Gobrecht and\r\nperfected by Spencer, has been rendered entirely automatic by Saxton, so\r\nthat it not only rules its lines at proper distances and of suitable\r\nlengths, but when its work is done it stops. In hydraulics, we have\r\nsucceeded well; and the great aqueduct over the Potomac at Georgetown,\r\nconstructed by Major Turnbull, of the Topographical Corps, exhibits new\r\ncontrivances, in overcoming obstacles never heretofore encountered in\r\nsimilar projects, and has been pronounced in Europe one of the most\r\nskilful works of the age.\r\n\r\nThe abstract mathematics does not seem so well suited to the genius of\r\nour countrymen as its application to other sciences. Those among us who\r\nhave most successfully pursued the pure mathematics, are chiefly our\r\nmuch-esteemed adopted citizens, such as Nulty, Adrain, Bonnycastle,\r\nGill, and Hassler. Bowditch was an American, and is highly distinguished\r\nat home and abroad. Such men as Plana and Babbage rank him among the\r\nfirst class, and his commentary on the 'Mécanique Céleste' of Laplace,\r\nhas secured for him a niche in the temple of fame, near to that of its\r\nillustrious author. Anderson and Strong are known to all who love\r\nmathematics, and Fischer was cut off by death in the commencement of a\r\nbright career. And may I here be indulged in grateful remembrance of two\r\nof my own preceptors, Dr. R. M. Patterson and Eugene Nulty. The first\r\nwas the professor at my Alma Mater (the University of Pennsylvania) in\r\nnatural philosophy and the application of mathematics to many branches\r\nof science. He was beloved and respected by all the class, as the\r\ncourteous gentleman and the profound scholar; and the Mint of the United\r\nStates, now under his direction, at Philadelphia, has reached the\r\nhighest point of system, skill, and efficiency. In the pure mathematics\r\nNulty is unsurpassed at home or abroad. In an earlier day, the elder\r\nPatterson, Ellicot, and Mansfield cultivated this branch successfully in\r\nconnection with astronomy.\r\n\r\nA new and extensive country is the great field for descriptive natural\r\nhistory. The beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, insects, shells, plants,\r\nstones, and rocks are to be examined individually and classed; many new\r\nvarieties and species are found, and even new genera may occur. The\r\nlearned Mitchell, of New York, delighted in these branches. The eminent\r\nHarlan, of Philadelphia, and McMultrie were of a later and more\r\nphilosophic school. Nuttall, of Cambridge, has distinguished himself in\r\nnatural history, and Haldeman is rising to eminence.\r\n\r\nOrnithology is one of the most attractive branches of natural history.\r\nWilson was the pioneer; Ord, his biographer, followed, and his friend\r\nTitian Peale; Audubon is universally known, and stands preëminent; and\r\nthe learned Nuttall and excellent and enthusiastic Townsend are much\r\nrespected. Most of these men have compassed sea and land, and\r\nencountered many perils and hardships to find their specimens. They have\r\nexplored the mountains of the North, the swamps of Florida, the prairies\r\nof the West, and accompanied the Exploring Expedition to the Antarctic,\r\nand round the world. As botanists, the Bartrams, Barton, and Collins, of\r\nPhiladelphia, Torrey, of New York, Gray and Nuttall of Cambridge,\r\nDarlington, of Westchester, are much esteemed. The first botanical\r\ngarden in our country was that of the Bartons, near Philadelphia; and\r\nthe first work on botany was from Barton, of the same city. Logan,\r\nWoodward, Brailsford, Shelby, Cooper, Horsfield, Colden, Clayton,\r\nMuhlenburg, Marshall, Cutler, and Hosack, were also distinguished in\r\nthis delightful branch.\r\n\r\nA study of the shells of our country has raised to eminence the names of\r\nBarnes, Conrad, Lea, and Raffinesque. The magnificent fresh-water shells\r\nof our Western rivers are unrivalled in the Old World in size and\r\nbeauty. How interesting would be a collection of all the specimens which\r\nthe organic kingdom of America presents, properly classified and\r\narranged according to the regions and States whence they were brought!\r\nParis has the museum of the natural history of France, and London of\r\nGreat Britain; but Washington has no museum[5] of the United States,\r\nthough so much richer in all these specimens.\r\n\r\nIn mineralogy, the work of Cleveland is most distinguished. Shepherd,\r\nMather, Troost, Torrey, and a few others, still pursue mineralogy for\r\nits own sake; but, generally, our mineralogists have turned geologists,\r\nstudying rocks on a large scale, instead of their individual\r\nconstituents, and vieing with their brethren in Europe in bold and\r\nsuccessful generalization, and in the application of physical science to\r\ntheir subject. Maclure was one of the pioneers, and Eaton and Silliman\r\ncontributed much to the stock of knowledge. This school has given rise\r\nto the great geological surveys made or progressing in several of the\r\nStates. Jackson, in Maine, Hitchcock, in Massachusetts; Vanuxen, Conrad,\r\nand Mather, in New York; the Rogerses, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nVirginia; Ducatel, in Maryland; Owen and Locke, in the West; Troost, in\r\nTennessee; Horton, in Ohio; the courageous, scientific, and lamented\r\nNicolet, in Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin, have made contributions, not\r\nonly to the geology of our country, but to the science of geology\r\nitself, which are conceded to be among the most valuable of the present\r\nday. The able reports of Owen and Nicolet were made to Congress, and\r\ndeserve the highest commendation.\r\n\r\nIn geographical science, the explorations of Lewis and Clark; of Long,\r\nNicolet, and the able and intrepid Fremont; the effective State survey\r\nof Massachusetts; the surveys of our public lands; the determination of\r\nthe boundaries of our States, and especially those of Pennsylvania, by\r\nRittenhouse and Elliott; of part of Louisiana, by Graham and Kearny; of\r\nMichigan, by Talcott; and of Maine, by Graham; have gained us great\r\ncredit. The national work of the coast survey, begun by the late Mr.\r\nHassler, and prosecuted through all discouragements and difficulties by\r\nthat indomitable man, has reflected honor upon his adopted country,\r\nthrough the Government which liberally supported the work, and through\r\nwhose aid it is now progressing, under new auspices, with great\r\nenergy.[6] The lake survey is also now advancing under the direction of\r\nCaptain Williams, of the Topographical Corps. Among the important recent\r\nexplorations, is that of the enlightened, untiring, and intrepid\r\nFremont, to Oregon, which fixes the pass of the Rocky Mountains within\r\ntwenty miles of the northern boundary of Texas. Lieutenant Fremont is a\r\nmember of the Topographical Corps, which, together with that of\r\nEngineers, contains so many distinguished officers, whose labors,\r\ntogether with those of their most able and distinguished chiefs, Colonel\r\nTotten and Colonel Abert, fill so large a portion of the public\r\ndocuments, and are so well known and highly appreciated by both Houses\r\nof Congress and by the country. The Emperor of Russia has entered the\r\nranks of our Topographical Corps, and employed one of their\r\ndistinguished members, Captain Whistler, to construct his great railroad\r\nfrom St. Petersburg to Moscow. The travels of our countrymen, Stephens,\r\nto Yucatan and Guatemala, to Egypt, Arabia, and Jerusalem, and of Dr.\r\nGrant to Nestoria, have increased our knowledge of geography and of\r\nantiquities, and have added new and striking proofs of the truths of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nFossil geology occupied much of the time and attention of the great\r\nphilosopher and statesman, Jefferson, and he was rewarded by the\r\ndiscovery of the megatherium. The mastodon, exhumed in 1801, from the\r\nmarl pits of New York, by Charles Wilson Peale, has proved but one of an\r\norder of animal giants. Even the tetracaulodon, or tusked mastodon, of\r\nGodman, upon which rested his claims to fame, is not the most curious of\r\nthis order, as the investigations of Hayes and Horner have proved. This\r\norder has excited the attention, not only of such minds as Cooper,\r\nHarlan, and Hayes, but has also occupied the best naturalists of France,\r\nBritain, Germany, and Italy.\r\n\r\nFossil conchology has attracted the attention of Conrad, the Lees, and\r\nthe Rogerses, not only calling forth much ingenuity in description and\r\nclassification, but also throwing great light upon the relative ages of\r\nsome of the most interesting geological formations. The earthquake\r\ntheory of the Rogerses is one of the boldest generalizations, founded\r\nupon physical reasoning, which our geologists have produced. In the\r\nparallel ridges into which the Apalachian chain is thrown, they see the\r\ncrests of great earthquake waves, propagated from long lines of focal\r\nearthquake action, more violent than any which the world now witnesses.\r\nThe geologist deals in such sublime conceptions as a world of molten\r\nmatter, tossed into waves by violent efforts of escaping vapors,\r\ncooling, cracking, and rending, in dire convulsion. He then ceases to\r\ndiscuss the changes and formation of worlds, and condescends to inform\r\nus how to fertilize our soil, where to look for coal and iron, copper,\r\ntin, cobalt, lead, and where we need not look for either. He is the\r\nMilton of poetry, and the Watt of philosophy. And here let me add, that\r\nthe recent application of chemistry to agriculture is producing the most\r\nsurprising results, in increasing and improving the products of the\r\nearth, and setting at defiance Malthus's theory of population.\r\n\r\nIn medicine, that great and most useful branch of physics, our\r\ncountrymen have been most distinguished. From the days of the great\r\nphilosopher, physician, patriot, and statesman, Benjamin Rush, down to\r\nthe present period, our country has been unsurpassed in this branch; but\r\nI have not time even to give an outline of the eminent Americans, whose\r\nimprovements and discoveries in medicine have contributed so much to\r\nelevate the character of our country, and advance the comfort and\r\nhappiness of man. Rush, one of the founders of this branch in America,\r\nwas one of the signers of our Declaration of Independence, and his\r\nschool of medicine was as independent and national as his course in our\r\nRevolutionary struggle. Statistics are chiefly concerned, as furnishing\r\nthe facts connected with government and political economy, but they are\r\nalso ancillary to physics. The statistical work of Mr. Archibald\r\nRussell, of New York, which immediately preceded the last census,\r\ncontained many valuable suggestions, some of which were adopted by\r\nCongress; and had more been incorporated into the law, the census would\r\nhave been much more complete and satisfactory. The recent statistical\r\nwork of Mr. George Tucker, of Virginia, on the census of 1840, is\r\ndistinguished by great talent and research, and is invaluable to the\r\nscholar, the philosopher, the statesman, and philanthropist.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This address was made and published several months before\r\nany electric telegraph line was in operation, and is believed to\r\nbe the first prediction of the success of this principle, as\r\nCONTINENTAL or OCEANIC.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now only one tenth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This Idea unquestionably originated in the United States,\r\nbut was improved last year, and has been introduced by Mr. Rammel, of\r\nEngland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: We now have several such museums in Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Our Coast Survey, as commenced by Hassler, and being\r\ncompleted by Bache, is admitted in Europe to be the best in the world.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Holy Father, Thou this day\r\n  Dost a cross upon me lay.\r\n  If I tremble as I lift,\r\n  First, and feel Thine awful gift,\r\n  Let me tremble not for pain,\r\n  But lest I may lose the gain\r\n  Which thereby my soul should bless,\r\n  Through mine own unworthiness.\r\n\r\n  Let me, drawing deeper breath,\r\n  Stand more firmly, lest beneath\r\n  Thy load I sink, and slavishly\r\n  In the dust it crusheth me.\r\n  Bearing this, so may I strength\r\n  Gather to receive at length\r\n  In turn eternal glory's great\r\n  And far more exceeding weight.\r\n\r\n  No, I am not crushed.

This newspaper boasted\r\nbut four pages, and was composed by a new process, with types consisting\r\nof words and syllables instead of single letters. On New Year's day,\r\n1788, its denomination was changed to _The Times_, a name which is\r\npotent all the world over, whithersoever Englishmen convey themselves\r\nand their belongings, and wherever the mighty utterances of the sturdy\r\nAnglo-Saxon tongue are heard. It was long before the infant 'Jupiter'\r\nbegan to exhibit any foreshadowing of his future greatness, and he had a\r\nvery difficult and up-hill struggle to wage. _The Morning Post_, _The\r\nMorning Herald_, _The Morning Chronicle_, and _The General Advertiser_\r\namply supplied or seemed to supply the wants of the reading public, and\r\nthe new competitor for public favor did not exhibit such superior\r\nability as to attract any great attention or to diminish the\r\nsubscription lists of its rivals. _The Morning Herald_ had been started\r\nin 1780 by Parson Bate, who quarrelled with his colleagues of _The\r\nPost_. This journal, which is now the organ of mild and antiquated\r\nconservatism, was originally started upon liberal principles. Bate\r\nimmediately ranged himself upon the side of the Prince of Wales and his\r\nparty, and thus his fortunes were secured. In 1781 his paper sustained a\r\nprosecution, and the printer was sentenced to pay a fine of £100, and to\r\nundergo one year's imprisonment, for a libel upon the Russian\r\nambassador. For this same libel the printers and publishers of _The\r\nLondon Courant_, _The Noon Gazette_, _The Gazetteer_, _The Whitehall\r\nEvening Journal_, _The St. James's Chronicle_, and _The Middlesex\r\nJournal_ received various sentences of fine and imprisonment, together\r\nwith, in some cases, the indignity of the pillory. Prosecutions for\r\nlibel abounded in those days. Horace Walpole says that, dating from\r\nWilkes's famous No. 45, no less than two hundred informations had been\r\nlaid, a much larger number than during the whole thirty-three years of\r\nthe previous reign. But the great majority of these must have fallen to\r\nthe ground, for, in 1791, the then attorney-general stated that, in the\r\nlast thirty-one years, there had been seventy prosecutions for libel,\r\nand about fifty convictions, in twelve of which the sentences had been\r\nsevere--including even, in five instances, the pillory. The law of libel\r\nwas extremely harsh, to say the least of it. One of its dogmas was that\r\na publisher could be held criminally liable for the acts of his\r\nservants, unless proved to be neither privy nor assenting to such acts.\r\nThe monstrous part of this was that, after a time, the judges refused to\r\nreceive any exculpatory evidence, and ruled that the publication of a\r\nlibel by a publisher's servant was proof sufficient of that publisher's\r\ncriminality. This rule actually obtained until 1843, when it was swept\r\naway by an act of Parliament, under the auspices of Lord Campbell. The\r\nsecond was even worse; for it placed the judge above the jury, and\r\nsuperseded the action of that dearly prized safeguard of an\r\nEnglishman's liberties, it asserting that it was for the judge alone,\r\nand not for the jury, to decide as to the criminality of a libel. Such\r\nstartling and outrageous doctrines as these roused the whole country,\r\nand the matter was taken up in Parliament. Fierce debates followed from\r\ntime to time, and the assailants of this monstrous overriding of the\r\nConstitution--for it was nothing less--were unremitting in their\r\nefforts. Among the most distinguished of these were Burke, Sheridan, and\r\nErskine, the last of whom was constantly engaged as counsel for the\r\ndefence in the most celebrated libel trials of the day. In 1791, Fox\r\nbrought in a bill for amending the law of libel, and so great had the\r\nchange become in public opinion, through the agitation that had been\r\ncarried on, that it passed unanimously in the House of Commons. Erskine\r\ntook a very prominent part in this measure, and, after demonstrating\r\nthat the judges had arrogated to themselves the rights and functions of\r\nthe jury, said that if, upon a motion in arrest of judgment, the\r\ninnocence of the defendant's intention was argued before the court, the\r\nanswer would be, and was, given uniformly, that the verdict of guilty\r\nhad concluded the criminality of the intention, though the consideration\r\nof that question had been by the judge's authority wholly withdrawn from\r\nthe jury at the trial. The bill met with opposition in the House of\r\nLords, especially from Lord Thurlow, who procured the postponement of\r\nthe second reading until the opinion of the judges should have been\r\nascertained. They, on being appealed to, declared that the criminality\r\nor innocence of any act was the result of the judgment which the law\r\npronounces upon that act, and must therefore be in all cases and under\r\nall circumstances matter of law, and not matter of fact, and that the\r\ncriminality or innocence of letters or papers set forth as overt acts of\r\ntreason, was matter of law, and not of fact. These startling assertions\r\nhad not much weight with the House of Lords, thanks to the able\r\narguments of Lord Camden, and the bill passed, with a protest attached\r\nfrom Lord Thurlow and five others, in which they predicted 'the\r\nconfusion and destruction of the law of England.' Of this bill, Macaulay\r\nsays: 'Fox and Pitt are fairly entitled to divide the high honor of\r\nhaving added to our statute book the inestimable law which places the\r\nliberty of the press under the protection of juries.' Intimately\r\nconnected with this struggle for the liberty of public opinion was\r\nanother mighty engine, which was brought to bear, and that was the\r\nPublic Association, with its legitimate offspring, the Public Meeting.\r\nThe power and influence which this organization exerted were enormous,\r\nand, though it was often employed in a bad or unworthy cause--such, for\r\ninstance, as the Protestant agitation, culminating in Lord George\r\nGordon's riots in 1780--yet it has been of incalculable advantage to the\r\nprogress of the state, the enlightenment of the nation, and the\r\nadvancement of civilization, freedom, and truth. Take, for instance, the\r\nSlave-Trade Association, the object and scope of which are thus\r\nadmirably described by Erskine May, in his 'Constitutional History of\r\nEngland':\r\n\r\n     'It was almost beyond the range of politics. It had no\r\n     constitutional change to seek, no interest to promote, no prejudice\r\n     to gratify, not even the national welfare to advance. Its clients\r\n     were a despised race in a distant clime--an inferior type of the\r\n     human family--for whom natures of a higher mould felt repugnance\r\n     rather than sympathy. Benevolence and Christian charity were its\r\n     only incentives. On the other hand, the slave-trade was supported\r\n     by some of the most powerful classes in the country--merchants,\r\n     shipowners, planters. Before it could be proscribed, vested\r\n     interests must be overborne--ignorance enlightened--prejudices and\r\n     indifference overcome--public opinion converted. And to this great\r\n     work did Granville Sharpe, Wilberforce, Clarkson, and other noble\r\n     spirits devote their lives. Never was cause supported by greater\r\n     earnestness and activity. The organization of the society\r\n     comprehended all classes and religious denominations. Evidence was\r\n     collected from every source to lay bare the cruelties and\r\n     iniquities of the traffic. Illustration and argument were\r\n     inexhaustible. Men of feeling and sensibility appealed with deep\r\n     emotion to the religious feelings and benevolence of the people. If\r\n     extravagance and bad taste sometimes courted ridicule, the high\r\n     purpose, just sentiments, and eloquence of the leaders of the\r\n     movement won respect and admiration. Tracts found their way into\r\n     every house, pulpits and platforms resounded with the wrongs of the\r\n     negro; petitions were multiplied, ministers and Parliament moved to\r\n     inquiry and action.... Parliament was soon prevailed upon to\r\n     attempt the mitigation of the worst evils which had been brought to\r\n     light, and in little more than twenty years the slave trade was\r\n     utterly condemned and prohibited.'\r\n\r\nAnd this magnificent result sprang from a Public Association. In this,\r\nthe most noble crusade that has ever been undertaken by man, the\r\nnewspapers bore a conspicuous part, and though, as might be expected,\r\nthey did not all take the same views, yet they rendered good service to\r\nthe glorious cause. But this tempting subject has carried us away into a\r\nrather lengthy digression from our immediate topic. To return,\r\ntherefore:\r\n\r\nIn 1786 there was a memorable action for libel brought by Pitt against\r\n_The Morning Herald_ and _The Morning Advertiser_, for accusing him of\r\nhaving gambled in the public funds. He laid his damages at £10,000, but\r\nonly obtained a verdict for £250 in the first case, and £150 in the\r\nsecond. In 1789 John Walter was sentenced to pay a fine of £50, to be\r\nexposed in the pillory for an hour, and to be imprisoned for one year,\r\nat the expiration of which he was ordered to find substantial bail for\r\nhis good behavior for seven years, for a libel upon the Duke of York. In\r\nthe following year he was again prosecuted and convicted for libels upon\r\nthe Prince of Wales, the Duke of York, and the Duke of Clarence, but,\r\nafter undergoing four months of his second term of one year's\r\nimprisonment, he was set free, at the instance of the Prince of Wales.\r\nThe last trial for libel, previous to the passing of Fox's libel bill,\r\nwas that of one Stockdale, for publishing a defence of Warren Hastings,\r\na pamphlet that was considered as libellously reflecting upon the House\r\nof Commons. However, through the great exertions of Erskine, his\r\ncounsel, he was acquitted.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 appeared the first daily evening paper, _The Star_, which\r\ncontinued until 1831, when it was amalgamated with _The Albion_. The\r\nyear 1789 is memorable for the assumption of the editorship of _The\r\nMorning Chronicle_ by James Perry, under whose management it reached a\r\ngreater pitch of prosperity and success than it ever enjoyed either\r\nbefore or since--greater, in fact, than any journal had hitherto\r\nattained. One of the chief reasons of this success was that he printed\r\nthe night's debates in his next morning's issue, a thing which had never\r\nbefore been accomplished or even attempted. Another secret of Perry's\r\nsuccess was the wonderful tact with which, while continuing to be\r\nthoroughly outspoken and independent, he yet contrived--with one\r\nexception, hereafter to be noticed--to steer clear of giving offence to\r\nthe Government. He is thus spoken of by a writer in _The Edinburgh\r\nReview_: 'He held the office of editor for nearly forty years, and he\r\nheld firm to his party and his principles all that time--a long time for\r\npolitical honesty and consistency to last! He was a man of strong\r\nnatural sense, some acquired knowledge, a quick tact, prudent,\r\nplausible, and with great heartiness and warmth of feeling.' His want of\r\neducation, however, now and then betrayed him into errors, and a curious\r\ninstance of this is, that on one occasion, when he meant to say\r\n'epithalamia,' he wrote and printed 'epicedia,' a mistake which he\r\ncorrected with the greatest coolness on the following day thus: 'For\r\n'epicedia' read 'epithalamia.'\r\n\r\nThe next event of importance is the appearance of Bell's _Weekly\r\nMessenger_, in 1796, a newspaper that met with immediate success, and is\r\nthe only one of the weeklies of that period which have survived to the\r\npresent time. The year '96 is also remarkable for an action brought by\r\n_The Telegraph_ against _The Morning Post_, for damages suffered by\r\npublishing an extract from a French paper, which purported to give the\r\nintelligence of peace between the Emperor of Germany and France, but\r\nwhich was forged and surreptitiously sent to _The Telegraph_ by the\r\nproprietors of _The Morning Post_. The result was that _The Telegraph_\r\nobtained a verdict for £100 damages. In 1794, _The Morning Advertiser_\r\nhad been established by the Licensed Victuallers of London, with the\r\nintention of benefiting by its sale the funds of the asylum which that\r\nbody had recently established. It at once obtained a large circulation,\r\ninasmuch as every publican became a subscriber. It exists to the present\r\nday, and is known by the slang _sobriquet_ of the 'Tub,' an appellation\r\nsuggested by its _clientèle_. Its opinions are radical, and it is\r\nconducted not without a fair share of ability, but, occasionally\r\nventuring out of its depth, it has more than once been most successfully\r\nand amusingly hoaxed. One of these cases was when a correspondent\r\ncontributed an extraordinary Greek inscription, which he asserted had\r\nbeen recently discovered. This so-called inscription was in reality\r\nnothing but some English doggerel of anything but a refined character\r\nturned into Greek.\r\n\r\nIn 1797, Canning brought out _The Anti-Jacobin_ as a Government organ,\r\nand Gifford--who began life as a cobbler's apprentice at an\r\nout-of-the-way little town in Devonshire, and afterward became editor of\r\n_The Quarterly Review_ in its palmiest days--was intrusted with its\r\nmanagement. _The Anti-Jacobin_ lasted barely eight months, but was\r\nprobably the most potent satirical production that has ever emanated\r\nfrom the English press. The first talent of the day was engaged upon it;\r\nand among its contributors we find Pitt, Lord Mornington, afterward\r\nMarquis of Wellesley, Lord Morpeth, afterward Earl of Carlisle,\r\nJenkinson, afterward Earl of Liverpool, Canning, George Ellis, Southey,\r\nLord Bathurst, Addington, John Hookham Frere, and a host of other\r\nprominent names at the time. The poetry of _The Anti-Jacobin_--its\r\nstrongest feature--has been collected into a volume, which has passed\r\nthrough several editions. This journal was the first to inaugurate\r\n'sensation' headings; for the three columns which were respectively\r\nentitled 'Mistakes,' 'Misrepresentations,' 'Lies,' and which most\r\ntruculently slashed away at the opponents of the political opinions of\r\n_The Anti-Jacobin_, decidedly come under that category.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at another era of persecution. Those were ticklish\r\ntimes, and Pitt, fearing lest revolutionary theories might be\r\npromulgated through the instrumentality of the press, determined to\r\ntighten the reins, and curb that freedom of expression which, after an\r\ninterval of rest from prosecution, was manifestly degenerating. Poor\r\nPerry was arraigned on a charge of exhibiting a leaning toward France,\r\nand he and his printer were fined and sent to prison. Pitt really\r\nappears to have had good ground for action, in one instance, at least,\r\nfor _The Courier_ had made certain statements which might fairly be\r\nconstrued as hostile to the Government, and favorable to France.\r\nMoreover, it was stated in the House of Commons by the attorney-general,\r\nthat a parcel of unstamped newspapers had been seized in a neutral\r\nvessel bound to France, containing information 'which, if any one had\r\nwritten and sent in another form to the enemy, he would have committed\r\nthe highest crime of which a man can be guilty.' Among other things,\r\nthe departure of the West India fleet under the convoy of two frigates\r\nonly was noticed, and the greatest fears were expressed for its safety\r\nin consequence. Another thing mentioned was, that as there was to be a\r\nlevy _en masse_ in this country, the French would not be so ill advised\r\nas to come here, but would make a swoop upon Ireland. A bill was brought\r\nforward, the chief provisions of which were that the proprietors and\r\nprinters of all newspapers should inscribe their names in a book, kept\r\nfor that purpose at the stamp office, in order that the book might be\r\nproduced in court on occasion of any trial, as evidence of the\r\nproprietorship and responsibility, and that a copy of each issue of\r\nevery newspaper should be filed at the stamp office, to be produced as\r\ngood and sufficient evidence of publication. A vehement debate followed,\r\nin the course of which Lord William Russell declared the bill to be an\r\ninsidious blow at the liberty of the press; and Sir W. Pulteney said\r\nthat 'the liberty of the press was of such a sacred nature that we ought\r\nto suffer many inconveniences rather than check its influence in such a\r\nmanner as to endanger our liberties; for he had no hesitation in saying\r\nthat without the liberty of the press the freedom of this country would\r\nbe a mere shadow.' But the great speech of the debate was that of Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett, who did not then foresee that the time would come when\r\nhe himself should make an attack upon the press.\r\n\r\n     'The liberty of the press,' he said, 'is of so delicate a nature,\r\n     and so important for the preservation of that small portion of\r\n     liberty which still remains to the country, that I cannot allow the\r\n     bill to pass without giving it my opposition. A good Government, a\r\n     free Government, has nothing to apprehend, and everything to hope\r\n     from the liberty of the press; it reflects a lustre upon all its\r\n     actions, and fosters every virtue. But despotism courts shade and\r\n     obscurity, and dreads the scrutinizing eye of liberty, the freedom\r\n     of the press, which pries into its secret recesses, discovering it\r\n     in its lurking holes, and drags it forth to public detestation. If\r\n     a tyrannically disposed prince, supported by an unprincipled,\r\n     profligate minister, backed by a notoriously corrupt Parliament,\r\n     were to cast about for means to secure such a triple tyranny, I\r\n     know of no means he could devise so effectual for that purpose as\r\n     the bill now upon the table.'\r\n\r\nSpite, however, of this vigorous opposition, the bill passed, and among\r\nother coercive measures it decreed heavy penalties against any\r\ninfringement of the stamp act, such as: 'Every person who shall\r\nknowingly and wilfully retain or keep in custody any newspaper not duly\r\nstamped, shall forfeit twenty pounds for each, such unstamped newspaper\r\nhe shall so have in custody'--'every person who shall knowingly or\r\nwilfully, directly or indirectly, send or carry or cause to be sent or\r\ncarried out of Great Britain any unstamped newspaper, shall forfeit one\r\nhundred pounds,' and 'every person during the present war who shall send\r\nany newspaper out of Great Britain into any country not in amity with\r\nhis Majesty, shall forfeit five hundred pounds.' Stringent measures\r\nthese, with a vengeance! The onslaught initiated by Parliament was well\r\nseconded by the judges, and Lord Kenyon especially distinguished himself\r\nas an unscrupulous (the word is not one whit too strong) foe to the\r\npress. To such an extent was this persecution carried, that the printer,\r\npublisher, and proprietor of _The Courier_ were fined and imprisoned for\r\nthe following 'libel' upon the Emperor Paul: 'The Emperor of Russia is\r\nrendering himself obnoxious to his subjects by various acts of tyranny,\r\nand ridiculous in the eyes of Europe by his inconsistency. He has now\r\npassed an edict prohibiting the exportation of timber deal,' etc. To\r\nfine a man £100 and imprison him for six months for this was a little\r\noverstepping the mark, and a reaction soon followed, as a proof of which\r\nmay be noticed the act 39th and 40th George III., cap. 72, which allows\r\nthe newspaper to be increased from the old regulation size of\r\ntwenty-eight inches by twenty to that of thirty inches and a half by\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cobbett now makes his bow as an English journalist. He was\r\nalready notorious in America, as the author of the 'Letters of Peter\r\nPorcupine,' published at Philadelphia; and, upon his return to England,\r\nhe projected an anti-democratic newspaper, under the title of _The\r\nPorcupine_, the first number of which appeared in November, 1800. It was\r\na very vigorous production, and at once commanded public attention and a\r\nlarge sale. Nevertheless it was but short lived, for the passions and\r\nfears to which it ministered soon calmed down; and, its occupation being\r\ngone, it naturally gave up the ghost and died. Among other celebrities\r\nwho now wrote for the newspapers are Porson, the accomplished but\r\nbibulous Greek scholar and critic; Tom Campbell, several of whose most\r\nbeautiful poems first appeared in the columns of _The Morning\r\nChronicle_, Charles Lamb, Southey, Wordsworth, and Mackintosh. These\r\nlast five wrote for _The Morning Post_, and raised it, by their\r\nbrilliant contributions, from the last place among the dailies--its\r\ncirculation had actually sunk to three hundred and fifty before they\r\njoined its ranks--to the second place, and caused it to tread very\r\nclosely upon the heels of _The Chronicle_. Tom Campbell, besides his\r\npoetry, wrote prose articles, and was also regularly engaged as a writer\r\nin _The Star_. Porson married James Perry's sister, and many scholarly\r\narticles which graced the columns of _The Morning Chronicle_ toward the\r\nclose of the eighteenth century are generally believed to have emanated\r\nfrom his pen. Mackintosh had written foreign political articles in _The\r\nOracle_ and _Morning Chronicle_, but, marrying the sister of Daniel\r\nStuart, the proprietor of _The Morning Post_ and _The Courier_, he\r\ntransferred his services to those journals, as well as occasionally to\r\n_The Star_, which belonged to a brother of Stuart. Southey and\r\nWordsworth's contributions to Stuart's papers were principally poetry.\r\nCharles Lamb's contributions were principally short, witty paragraphs,\r\nwhich he contributed to any of the papers that would receive them, and\r\nfor which he received the magnificent remuneration of sixpence each!\r\nColeridge had first appeared in the newspaper world as a contributor of\r\npoetry to _The Morning Chronicle_, but was soon after regularly engaged\r\nupon _The Morning Post_ and _The Courier_. Some of his prose articles\r\nhave been collected together into a volume, and republished with the\r\ntitle of 'Essays on His Own Times.' He was especially hostile to France,\r\nand the best proof of the ability and vigor of his anti-Gallican\r\narticles is that Napoleon actually sent a frigate in pursuit of him,\r\nwhen he was returning from Leghorn to England, with the avowed intention\r\nof getting him into his power if possible. The First Consul had\r\nendeavored to get him arrested at Rome, but Coleridge got a friendly\r\nhint--according to some from Jerome Bonaparte, and according to others\r\nfrom the Pope, who assisted him in making his escape. Bonaparte had\r\nprobably gained intelligence of the whereabout of Coleridge from a\r\ndebate in the House of Commons, in the course of which Fox said that the\r\nrupture of the Peace of Amiens was owing to Coleridge's articles in _The\r\nMorning Post_, and added that the writer was then at Rome, and therefore\r\nmight possibly fall into the hands of his enemy. Napoleon was very much\r\nirritated by the attacks upon him in _The Morning Chronicle_ as well as\r\nby those in Cobbett's _Political Register_--_The Porcupine_ under a new\r\nname--the _Courrier François de Londres_--the French _emigrés'_\r\npaper--and _L'Ambigu_, which was rather a political pamphlet, published\r\nat periodical intervals, than a regular newspaper. He therefore thought\r\nproper peremptorily to call upon the English Government to put these\r\npapers down with a high hand. But the British cabinet sent this noble\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n     'His Majesty neither can nor will in consequence of any\r\n     representation or menace from a foreign power make any concession\r\n     which may be in the smallest degree dangerous to the liberty of the\r\n     press as secured by the Constitution of this country. This liberty\r\n     is justly dear to every British subject; the Constitution admits of\r\n     no previous restraints upon publications of any description; but\r\n     there exist judicatures wholly independent of the executive,\r\n     capable of taking cognizance of such publications as the law deems\r\n     to be criminal; and which are bound to inflict the punishment the\r\n     delinquents may deserve. These judicatures may investigate and\r\n     punish not only libels against the Government and magistracy of\r\n     this kingdom, but, as has been repeatedly experienced, of\r\n     publications defamatory of those in whose hands the administration\r\n     of foreign Governments is placed. Our Government neither has, nor\r\n     wants, any other protection than what the laws of the country\r\n     afford; and though they are willing and ready to give to every\r\n     foreign Government all the protection against offences of this\r\n     nature which the principles of their laws and Constitution will\r\n     admit, they can never consent to new-model those laws or to change\r\n     their Constitution to gratify the wishes of any foreign power.'\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon indignantly declined to avail himself of the means of\r\nredress suggested to him, and continued to urge the English Government;\r\nwho at length made a sort of compromise, by undertaking a prosecution of\r\nPeltier, the proprietor of _L'Ambigu_. Mackintosh was his counsel; and\r\nin spite of his speech for the defence, which Spencer Perceval\r\ncharacterized as 'one of the most splendid displays of eloquence he ever\r\nhad occasion to hear,' and Lord Ellenborough as 'eloquence almost\r\nunparalleled,' Peltier was found guilty--but, as hostilities soon after\r\nbroke out again with France, was never sentenced. The best part of the\r\nstory, however, is, that all the time ministers were paying Peltier in\r\nprivate for writing the very articles for which they prosecuted him in\r\npublic! This did not come out until some years afterward, when Lord\r\nCastlereagh explained the sums thus expended as 'grants for public and\r\nnot private service, and for conveying instructions to the Continent\r\nwhen no other mode could be found.' The trial of Peltier aroused a\r\nstrong feeling of indignation in the country; the English nation has\r\nalways been very jealous of any interference with its laws at the\r\ndictation of any foreign potentate, as Lord Palmerston on a recent\r\noccasion found to his cost.\r\n\r\nCobbett was soon after tried for a libel--not, however, upon Napoleon,\r\nbut upon the English Government. There must have been an innate tendency\r\nin Cobbett's mind to set himself in opposition to everything around him,\r\nfor whereas he had made America too hot to hold him by his\r\nanti-republican views, he now contrived to set the authorities at home\r\nagainst him by his advanced radicalism. He had to stand two trials in\r\n1804, in connection with Robert Emmet's rebellion. On the second of\r\nthese he was fined £500, and Judge Johnson, one of the Irish judges, who\r\nwas the author of the libels complained of, retired from his judicial\r\nposition with a pension. These reflections in question upon the Irish\r\nauthorities would hardly be called libels now-a-days, consisting as they\r\ndid chiefly of ridicule and satire, which was, after all, mild and\r\nharmless enough. In 1810, Cobbett got into trouble again. Some militia\r\nsoldiers had been flogged, while a detachment of the German Legion stood\r\nby to maintain order. Cobbett immediately published a diatribe against\r\nflogging in the army and the employment of foreign mercenaries. He was\r\nindicted for a 'libel' upon the German Legion, convicted, and sentenced\r\nto two years' imprisonment, to pay a fine of £1,000, and to find\r\nsecurity in £3,000 for his good behavior during seven years--a sentence\r\nwhich created universal disgust among all classes, and which was not too\r\nstrongly designated by Sydney Smith as 'atrocious.'\r\n\r\n_The Oracle_--which, by the way, boasted Canning among its\r\ncontributors--was rash enough to publish an article in defence of Lord\r\nMelville. The House of Commons fired up at this, and, led on by\r\nSheridan--_quantum mutatus ab illo!_--Fox, Wyndham, and others, who had\r\nformerly professed themselves friends to the liberty of the press, but\r\nwho were now carried away by the virulence of party spirit, caused the\r\npublisher to be brought before them, and made him apologize and make his\r\nsubmission upon his knees.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 appeared _The News_, a paper started by John Hunt and his\r\nbrother Leigh, then but a mere boy, but who had, nevertheless, had some\r\nexperience in newspaper writing from having been an occasional\r\ncontributor to _The Traveller_, an evening paper, that was afterward\r\namalgamated with _The Globe_, which still retains the double title. The\r\nyear 1808 was fruitful in prosecutions for libels, but is chiefly\r\nremarkable for the appearance of Hunt's new paper, _The Examiner_. This\r\nwas conducted upon what was styled by their opponents revolutionary\r\nprinciples, an accusation which Leigh Hunt afterward vehemently\r\nrepudiated. This same year also gave birth to the first religious paper\r\nwhich had as yet appeared, under the name of _The Instructor_, as well\r\nas to _The Anti-Gallican_, which seems to have quickly perished of\r\nspontaneous combustion, and _The Political Register_, an impudent piracy\r\nof the title of Cobbett's paper, and directed against him. In 1809,\r\nGovernment passed a bill in favor of newspapers, to amend some of the\r\nrestrictions under which they labored. This was done on account of the\r\nhigh price of paper: and yet in the following year another attempt was\r\nmade to exclude the reporters from the House of Commons. These men had\r\nalways done their work well and honestly, although in their private\r\nlives some of them had not borne the very best character. A capital\r\nstory is told of Mark Supple, an Irish reporter of the old school, who\r\nwas employed on _The Chronicle_. One evening, when there was a sudden\r\nsilence in the midst of a debate, Supple bawled out: 'A song from Mr.\r\nSpeaker.' The members could not have been more astonished had a\r\nbombshell been suddenly discharged into the midst of them; but, after a\r\nslight pause, every one--Pitt among the first--went off into such shouts\r\nof laughter, that the halls of the House shook again. The\r\nsergeant-at-arms was, however, sent to the gallery to ascertain who had\r\nhad the audacity to propose such a thing; whereupon Supple winked at him\r\nand pointed out a meek, sober Quaker as the culprit. Broadbrim was\r\nimmediately taken into custody; but Supple, being found out, was locked\r\nup in a solitary chamber to cool his heels for a while, and then having\r\nmade a humble apology, to the effect that 'it was the dhrink that did\r\nit,' or something of the kind, was set at liberty. But the reporters at\r\nthe period of this unjust and foolish exclusion--for it was successful\r\nfor a time--were a very different class of men; and Sheridan told the\r\nHouse that 'of about twenty-three gentlemen who were now employed\r\nreporting parliamentary debates for the newspapers, no less than\r\neighteen were men regularly educated at the universities of Oxford or\r\nCambridge, Edinburgh or Dublin, most of them graduates at those\r\nuniversities, and several of them had gained prizes and other\r\ndistinctions there by their literary attainments.' It was during this\r\ndebate that Sheridan uttered that memorable and glowing eulogium upon\r\nthe press which has been quoted in the first of the present series of\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that at one time the church was the profession which\r\nmost liberally supplied the press with writers; but now the bar appears\r\nto have furnished a very large share, and many young barristers had\r\nbeen and were reporters. The benchers of Lincoln's Inn endeavored to put\r\na stop to this, and passed a by-law that no man who had ever been paid\r\nfor writing in the newspapers should be eligible for a call to the bar.\r\nThis by-law was appealed against in the House of Commons, and, after a\r\ndebate, in which Sheridan spoke very warmly against the benchers, the\r\npetition was withdrawn upon the understanding that the by-law should be\r\nrecalled. From that time to the present, writing in the newspapers and\r\nreporting the debates have been the means whereby many of the most\r\ndistinguished of our lawyers have been enabled to struggle through the\r\ndays of their studentship and the earlier years of their difficult\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThe last attempt of the House of Commons against the press culminated in\r\nSir Francis Burdett's coming forward in its behalf, and, in an article\r\nin Cobbett's paper, among other things he asserted that the House of\r\nCommons had no legal right to imprison the People of England. In acting\r\nthus, Sir Francis amply atoned for the ridiculous attempt which,\r\nprompted by wounded vanity, he had made a few years before to engage the\r\ninterference of the House of Commons in his behalf in what he called a\r\nbreach of privilege--the said breach of privilege consisting merely in\r\nan advertisement in _The True Briton_ of the resolutions passed at a\r\npublic meeting to petition against his return to Parliament. The results\r\nof his bold attack upon the power of the House of Commons, his\r\nimprisonment, the riots, and lamentable loss of life which followed, are\r\nso well known as to render any particularizing of them here unnecessary.\r\nOriginating with this affair was a Government prosecution of _The Day_,\r\nthe upshot of which was that Eugenius Roche, the editor--who was also\r\nproprietor of another flourishing journal, _The National Register_--one\r\nof the most able, honorable, and gentlemanly men ever connected with the\r\npress, of whom it has been truly said that 'during the lapse of more\r\nthan twenty years that he was connected with the journals of London, he\r\nnever gained an enemy or lost a friend,' was most unjustly condemned to\r\na year's imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe next important event is the trial of the Hunts for a libel in _The\r\nExaminer_ in 1811. Brougham was their counsel, and made a masterly\r\ndefence; and, though Lord Ellenborough, the presiding judge, summed up\r\ndead against the defendants--the judges always appear to have done\r\nso--the jury acquitted them. Yet Brougham in the course of his address\r\ndrew the following unfavorable picture of the then state of the press:\r\n\r\n     'The licentiousness of the press has reached to a height which it\r\n     certainly never attained in any other country, nor even in this at\r\n     any former period. That licentiousness has indeed of late years\r\n     appeared to despise all the bounds which had once been prescribed\r\n     to the attacks on private character, insomuch that there is not\r\n     only no personage so important or exalted--for of that I do not\r\n     complain--but no person so humble, harmless, and retired as to\r\n     escape the defamation which is daily and hourly poured forth by the\r\n     venal crew to gratify the idle curiosity or still less excusable\r\n     malignity of the public. To mark out for the indulgence of that\r\n     propensity individuals retiring into the privacy of domestic\r\n     life--to hunt them down and drag them forth as a laughing stock to\r\n     the vulgar, has become in our days with some men the road even to\r\n     popularity, but with multitudes the means of earning a base\r\n     subsistence.'\r\n\r\nSoon after this trial and another provincial one connected with the same\r\n'libel'--one gets quite sick of the word--in which the defendants were\r\nfound guilty in spite of Brougham's exertions in their behalf and the\r\nprevious verdict of the London jury in the case of the Hunts, a debate\r\narose in the House of Commons on the subject of _ex-officio_\r\ninformations generally, and especially with regard to their\r\napplicability to the case of newspapers. In the course of this debate\r\nLord Folkestone charged the Government with partiality in their\r\nprosecutions, and said: 'It appears that the real rule which guides\r\nthese prosecutions is this: that _The Courier_ and the other papers\r\nwhich support the ministry of the day, may say whatever they please\r\nwithout the fear of prosecution, whereas _The Examiner_, _The\r\nIndependent Whig_, _The Statesman_, and papers that take the contrary\r\nline, are sure to be prosecuted for any expression that may be offensive\r\nto the minister'--an accusation which was decidedly true.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the Hunts were again prosecuted for a libel upon the Prince\r\nRegent, and sentenced to be imprisoned two years, and to pay a fine of\r\n£500. Bat the imprisonment was alleviated in every possible way, as we\r\ngather from Leigh Hunt's charming description of his prison in his\r\nAutobiography.\r\n\r\n     'I papered the walls with a trellis of roses; I had the ceiling\r\n     colored with clouds and sky; the barred windows were screened with\r\n     venetian blinds; and when my book cases were set up with their\r\n     busts and flowers, and a pianoforte made its appearance, perhaps\r\n     there was not a handsomer room on that side of the water.... There\r\n     was a little yard outside, railed off from another belonging to a\r\n     neighboring ward. This yard I shut in with green palings, adorned\r\n     it with a trellis, bordered it with a thick bed of earth from a\r\n     nursery, and even contrived to have a grass plot. The earth I\r\n     filled with flowers and young trees. There was an apple tree from\r\n     which we managed to get a pudding the second year. As to my\r\n     flowers, they were allowed to be perfect.'\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at a period which may almost be called that of the\r\npresent, inasmuch as many well-known names which still continue to adorn\r\nour current literature first begin to appear, together with many others,\r\nthe bearers of which have but recently departed from among us. Cyrus\r\nRedding, John Payne Collier, and Samuel Carter Hall still survive, and,\r\nit is to be hoped, are far off yet from the end of their honorable\r\ncareer; and William Hazlitt, Theodore Hook, Lord Campbell, Dr. Maginn,\r\nDr. Croly, Thomas Barnes, William Jordan, and many others, belong as\r\nmuch to the present generation as to the past. Among other distinguished\r\nwriters must be mentioned Jeremy Bentham and David Ricardo, who\r\ncontributed articles of sterling merit upon political economy and\r\nfinance to the newspapers, and especially to _The Morning Chronicle_, in\r\nwhich journal William Hazlitt succeeded Lord Campbell, then 'plain John\r\nCampbell,' as theatrical critic. Cyrus Redding was at one time editor of\r\n_Galignani's Messenger_, and was afterward connected with _The Pilot_,\r\nwhich was considered the best authority on Indian matters, and in some\r\nway or another, at different times, with most of the newspapers of the\r\nday. John P. Collier wrote in _The Times_ and _Morning Chronicle_,\r\nThomas Barnes in _The Morning Chronicle_ and _Champion_, Croly and S. C.\r\nHall in _The New Times_--a newspaper started by Stoddart, the editor of\r\n_The Times_, after his quarrel with Walter--Maginn in _The New Times_,\r\n_Standard_, _John Bull_, and many others, William Hazlitt in _The\r\nMorning Chronicle_, _Examiner_, and _Atlas_, and Theodore Hook in _John\r\nBull_, of which he was the editor.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, the advertisement duty, which had hitherto stood at three\r\nshillings, was raised to three shillings and sixpence, and an additional\r\nhalfpenny was clapped on to the stamp duty. There were then fifty-five\r\nnewspapers published in London, of which fifteen were daily, one hundred\r\nand twenty-two in the provinces of England and Wales, twenty-six in\r\nScotland, and forty-nine in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAnd here let us pause to consider the position which the press had\r\nreached. It had survived all the attempts made to crush it; nay, more,\r\nit had triumphed over all its foes. Grateful to Parliament, whenever\r\nthat august assemblage befriended it, and standing manfully at bay\r\nwhenever its liberties had been threatened in either House, it had\r\novercome all resistance, and Lords and Commons recognized in it a safe\r\nand honorable tribunal, before which their acts would be impartially\r\njudged, as well as the truest and most legitimate medium between the\r\nrulers and the ruled. The greatest names of the day in politics and in\r\nliterature were proud to range themselves under its banners and to aid\r\nin the glorious work of extending its influence, developing its\r\nusefulness, and elevating its tone and character; and the people at\r\nlarge had learned to look upon it as the firm friend of national\r\nenlightenment, and the most trustworthy guardian of their constitutional\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE ON A BLOCKADER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife in the camp and in the field has formed the staple of much writing\r\nsince the commencement of the war, and all have now at least a tolerable\r\nidea of the soldier's ordinary life. Our sailors are a different matter,\r\nand while we study the daily papers for Army news, we are apt to ignore\r\nthe Navy, and forget that, though brave men are in the field, a smaller\r\nproportion of equally brave serve on a more uncertain field, where not\r\none alone but many forms of death are before them. Shot and shell it is\r\nthe soldier's duty to face, and the sailor's as well, but one ball at\r\nsea may do the work of a thousand on shore: it may pass through a\r\nvessel, touching not a soul on board, and yet from the flying splinters\r\nleft in its path cause the death of a score; its way may lie through the\r\nboilers, still touching no one, and yet the most horrible of all deaths,\r\nthat by scalding steam, result. It may chance to hit the powder\r\nmagazine, and sudden annihilation be the fate of both ship and crew; or,\r\npassing below the water line, bring a no less certain, though slower\r\nfate--that which met the brave little Keokuk at Charleston, not many\r\nmonths since.\r\n\r\nLife at sea is a compound of dangers, and though the old tar may\r\ncongratulate himself in a stormy night on being safe in the maintop, and\r\nsing after Dibdin--\r\n\r\n  'Lord help us! how I pitys\r\n    All unhappy folks on shore'--\r\n\r\nto the majority of our present Navy, made up as it is, in part at least,\r\nof volunteer officers and men, it is essentially distasteful, and\r\nendured only as the soldier endures trench duty or forced marches--as a\r\nmeans of sooner ending the Rebellion, and bringing white-winged Peace in\r\nthe stead of grim War.\r\n\r\nThe history of our ironclads, from their first placing on the stocks, to\r\nthe present time, when Charleston engrosses them all, is read with\r\navidity, but few know anything of life on our blockaders, or, thinking\r\nthere is not the dignity of danger associated with them, take little or\r\nno interest in what they may chance to see concerning them. Those who\r\nhave friends on blockade duty may be interested to know more of their\r\ndaily life than can be crowded into the compass of home letters, and the\r\nwriter, one of the squadron off Wilmington, would constitute himself\r\nhistorian of the doings of at least one ship of the fleet.\r\n\r\nWilmington, Charleston, and Mobile, alone remain of all the rebel ports,\r\nbut it is with the first we have to do--where it is, how it looks, &c.\r\n\r\nRight down the coast, some 450 miles from New York, and a hundred or\r\nmore from the stormy cape of Hatteras, you will see the river which\r\nfloats the merchandise to and from the docks at Wilmington, emptying\r\ninto the ocean at Cape Fear, from which it takes its name. The river has\r\ntwo mouths, or rather a mouth proper, which opens to the south of the\r\ncape, and an opening into the side of the river, north of the cape\r\ncalled New Inlet. Perhaps more seek entrance by this inlet than the\r\nmouth, which is guarded by Fort Caswell, a strong, regularly built fort,\r\nonce in Union hands, mounting some long-range English Whitworth guns.\r\nOne other fort has been built here since the commencement of the war.\r\nThis inlet is guarded by a long line of earthworks, mounted by Whitworth\r\nand other guns of heavy caliber. Wilmington lies some twenty miles from\r\nthe mouth, and fifteen north of New Inlet.\r\n\r\nOne great characteristic of this coast is the columns of smoke, which\r\nevery few miles shoot up from its forests and lowlands. All along the\r\ncoasts may be seen mounds where pitch, tar, and turpentine are being\r\nmade. These primitive manufactories for the staple of North Carolina are\r\nin many places close down to the water's edge, whence their products may\r\neasily be shipped on schooners or light-draft vessels, with little\r\ndanger of being caught by the blockaders, who draw too much water to\r\nmake a very near approach to shore. So much for the coast we guard; now\r\nfor ourselves.\r\n\r\nOur vessel, of some thirteen hundred tons, and manned by a crew of about\r\n200 all told, reached blockade ground the early part of March. Our\r\nvoyage down the coast had been unmarked by any special incident, and\r\nwhen at dusk, one spring afternoon, we descried a faint blue line of\r\nland in the distance, and knew it as the enemy's territory, speculation\r\nwas rife as to the prospect of prizes. About 11 P. M. a vessel\r\nhove in sight, which, as it neared, proved to be a steamer of about half\r\nour tonnage. Our guns were trained upon the craft, but, instead of\r\nrunning, she steamed up toward us. We struck a light, but it was as loth\r\nto show its brightness as the ancient bushel-hidden candle. A rope was\r\nturpentined, and touched with burning match, but the flame spread up and\r\ndown the whole spiral length of the rope torch, to the infinite vexation\r\nof the lighter. Fierce stampings and fiercer execrations swiftly\r\nterrorized the trembling quartermaster, who, good fellow, did his best,\r\nand then, frightened into doing something desperate, made this blaze. We\r\nhailed them while waiting for fire to throw signals, letting them know\r\nwho we were; but the wind carried away our shoutings, and the vessel\r\nactually seemed inclined to run us down. Worse yet--what could the\r\nlittle vixen mean?--a bright light, flashed across her decks, showed\r\ngathering round her guns a swift-moving band of men. Her crew were\r\ntraining their guns upon us for our swift capture or destruction: she\r\ncould not see our heavy weight of metal, for our ports were closed. She\r\nmight be a friend, for so her signal lights seemed to indicate; but if\r\nof our fleet, how should we let her know in time to save the loss of\r\nlife and irreparable harm a single ball from her might do? She had\r\nwaited long enough for friendly signals from us, and the wind, which\r\nswept our shouts from hearing, brought to us from them, first, questions\r\nas to who we were, then threats to fire if we did not quickly tell, and\r\nthen orders passed to the men at the foremost gun: 'One point to the\r\nstarboard train her!'--words which made their aim on us more sure and\r\nfatal. 'Bear a hand with that fire and torch! Be quick, for God's sake,\r\nor we'll have a shot through us, and that from a friend, unless we blaze\r\naway like lightning with our rockets.' The crew were stepping from the\r\ngun to get out of the way as it was fired; the captain of the gun held\r\nthe lock string in his hand; but the instant had not been lost, and our\r\nrockets, springing high in air, told our story. Danger is past: we learn\r\nthey are not only friends, but to be neighbors, and steam in together to\r\nour post rather nearer the shore than other vessels here.\r\n\r\nDays pass on in watching, and as yet no foreign sail. We study the line\r\nof our western horizon, and find it well filled in with forts,\r\nembrazures, earthworks, black-nosed dogs of war, and busy traitors. As\r\ntime goes on, a new thing opens to the view: a short week ago it seemed\r\nbut a molehill: now it has risen to the height of a man, and hourly\r\nincreases in size. Two weeks, and now its summit is far above the reach\r\nof spade or shovel throw, and crowned by a platform firmly knit and held\r\ntogether by well-spliced timbers. As to its object we are somewhat\r\ndubious, but think it the beginning of an earthwork fortress, built high\r\nin order that guns may be depressed and brought to bear on the turrets\r\nof any Monitors which might possibly come down upon this place or\r\nWilmington.\r\n\r\nAt night we draw nearer to the shore, watching narrowly for blockade\r\nrunners, which evade us occasionally, but oftener scud away\r\ndisappointed. One night or early morning, 3 A. M. by the clock,\r\nwe tried to heave up anchor; the pin slipped from the shackles, and the\r\nanchor, with forty fathoms of chain attached, slipped and sank to the\r\nbottom in some eight fathoms of water.\r\n\r\nThe next day we steamed into our moorings of the previous night and\r\nsought to drag for it. While arranging to do so, we saw a puff of smoke\r\nfrom the shore. Bang! and a massive cannon ball tore whizzing over our\r\nheads. The shore batteries had us in their range, and the firing from\r\nthe far-reaching Whitworth guns grows more rapid. Puff after puff rolls\r\nup from the long line of battery-covered hillocks, under the bastard\r\nflag, and the rolling thunder peals on our ears with the whizzing of\r\ndeath-threatening balls. Oh! the excitement of watching and wondering\r\nwhere the next ball will strike, and whether it will crush a hole right\r\nthrough us, wasting rich human life, and scattering our decks with\r\ntorn-off limbs and running pools of blood. Quickly as possible we up\r\nanchor and away, and soon are out of reach of balls, which splash the\r\nwater not a ship's length from us. Even then we involuntarily dodge\r\nbehind some pine board or other equally serviceable screen; and a\r\nnewspaper, if that were nearest, would be used for the same purpose--so\r\nsay those who have tasted many a naval fight. In fact, the dodge is as\r\noften after the ball has hit as before, as this story of one of our\r\nbrave quartermasters will prove: Under fire from rebel batteries, he\r\nnoted the cloud of smoke which burst from one of the fort's\r\nembrazures--watched sharply for the ball--heard the distant roar and its\r\ncutting whiz overhead--watched still further, saw it fall into the sea\r\nbeyond, and then sang out to the captain, 'There it fell, sir!' and like\r\nlightning dodged behind a mast, as though the necessity had but just\r\noccurred to him.\r\n\r\nAs our rebel friends see their shot falling short of us, the firing\r\nceases, and thus harmlessly ends the action which for a few moments\r\nthreatened so much, teaching us the folly of too near approaches to\r\nland, or attempts to batter down, to which we have often been tempted,\r\nthe earthworks daily erecting. It is folly to attempt it, because the\r\ndisabling of these few blockade steamers would open the port to all who\r\nchoose to barter with our Southern foes; and, _en passant_, this will\r\nexplain why here and elsewhere the rebels build their works under the\r\nvery noses of our men-of-war. Thus a vessel runs the blockade, and takes\r\ninto them English Whitworth guns, which send balls flying through the\r\nair a good five miles, and whose range is longer than our far-famed\r\nParrott rifled cannon. These Whitworths they place concealed in\r\nhillsides, or in forests back of the places where they build the regular\r\nfort to protect them. If our vessels approach to batter down these germs\r\nof forts, fire is opened on us from these long rangers, and nine chances\r\nout of ten we are disabled before we can so much as touch them with our\r\nguns; so that for ourselves we accomplish nothing, thereby benefiting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWeek days and Sundays pass on alike as far as outside incident is\r\nconcerned, but new features in each other open to view as time goes on.\r\nNaval discipline develops the bump of reverence, or at any rate fosters\r\nit for a time, and to the volunteer in his first days or weeks passed on\r\nboard a man-of-war, the dignified captain in the retirement of his cabin\r\nis an object of veneration, and the slight peculiarities of some other\r\nofficers, merely ornamental additions to shining characters. On a\r\nSunday, for instance, in the early part of the cruise, the said bump\r\nreceives as it were a strengthening plaster, at the sight of officers\r\nand men in full dress--the first resplendent in gold-banded\r\ncaps--multiplied buttons--shining sword hilts, et cetera, et cetera, and\r\nthe men in white ducks, blue shirts, et cetera, scattered about the\r\ndecks in picturesque groups. The captain, from the fact of his occupying\r\na private cabin, and seeing the officers merely to give orders or\r\nreceive reports in the line of their duty, comes but little in contact\r\nwith them, and, as there is a certain idea of grandeur in isolation,\r\nobliges a degree of reverence not accorded to those with whom one is in\r\nconstant intercourse. A slight feeling of superiority always exists in\r\nthe minds of those of the regular navy over the volunteer officers, and\r\nthough at first the ward-room mess all seemed 'hail fellow, well met,'\r\nfamiliarity develops various traits and tendencies, which, in a mess of\r\neight or nine, will not be persuaded to form a harmonious whole. Our\r\nlieutenant, for instance, who, in the first days of the cruise, appeared\r\na compound of all the Christian graces, and a 'pattern of a gentleman,'\r\ndevelops a pleasant little tendency to swear viciously on slight\r\nprovocation, and, though, rather afraid to indulge his propensities to\r\nthe full, lest the rules of naval service be violated, and disgrace\r\nfollow, still recreates himself privately, by pinching the little\r\nmessenger boys till they dance, and gritting his teeth, as if he longed\r\nto do more, but didn't dare. It is wonderful how salt water develops\r\ncharacter. Our (on land) _debonnaire_, chivalrous executive, is merged\r\nin the swearing blackguard as far as he can be; and yet strange as it\r\nmay seem, no man can be braver in time of danger, or apparently more\r\nforgetful of self. Our paymaster, too, has suffered a sea change: the\r\ngentleman is put away with his Sunday uniform, and taken out to air only\r\nwhen it is politic to do so: wine and cigars, owned by somebody else,\r\noccasion its instant appearance. No man on ship can show more deference\r\nfor another's feelings where the captain is concerned; no man more\r\nthorough disregard where the sailors come into question. Yet this man\r\nhas also his redeeming points or point, made perceptible by a solitary\r\nremark, remembered in his favor at times when the inclination has been\r\nto call him a hypocritical scoundrel. One of the mess, rather given to\r\nprofanity, said to him one day: 'Paymaster, what's the reason you never\r\nswear?' 'Because,' was the answer, 'I never set an example at home which\r\nI would not wish my children to follow, and so I've got out of the way\r\nof it.'\r\n\r\nVarious criticisms might be made on officers and men: there are\r\ncharacters enough among them to furnish material for a volume. Some are\r\nmoderately patriotic, but would have been as much so on the other side,\r\nhad as strong inducements been held out in the way of 'loaves and\r\nfishes.' Others love the cause for itself, and hold life cheap if its\r\nsacrifice may in any way advance it. Blockade duty is perhaps a harder\r\ntest of this love than actual field service; and as months pass on, it\r\nbecomes almost unendurable. The first few days can be taken up in sight\r\nseeing on board, and the most novel of these said sights is the drill\r\nwhich follows the daily call to quarters. The rapid roll of the drum is\r\nthe signal: here, there, everywhere, on berth deck, spar deck, quarter\r\ndeck, men spring to their feet, jump from their hammocks, and every door\r\nand passage way is blocked up by the crowd, who rush to their respective\r\nquarters, and about the armory, each seeking to be the first, who, fully\r\nequipped with cutlass, gun, and sabre-bayonet affixed, shall be in his\r\nplace. Another instant, and all stand about their several guns in rows,\r\nawaiting orders from their officers, who sing out in clear commanding\r\ntones, as though a real fight were impending: 'Pass 9-inch shell and\r\nload!' They drive it home. 'Now run out! train her two points off port\r\nquarter; elevate for five hundred yards! Fire! Run her in! Run out\r\nstarboard gun! Run her home! Train her three points off starboard\r\nquarter! Fire!'\r\n\r\nHigh up on the bridge of the hurricane deck, stands the first\r\nlieutenant, overlooking the men as they work the guns, train, load, run\r\nout, and mimic fire. Suddenly he shouts through the trumpet: 'Boarders\r\nand pikemen at port quarter! First boarders advance! Second boarders\r\nadvance! Repel boarders! Retreat boarders! Pikemen cover cutlass\r\ndivision! Fire! Repel boarders!' The second hand scarcely sweeps over a\r\nquarter of its dial before the men have crowded around the port\r\nbulwarks, and are slashing the air with a most Quixotic fury--then\r\ncrouch on bent knee, to make ready their pistols, while in their rear,\r\nmarines and pikemen, musket and rifle armed, snap their pieces, and pour\r\ninto an imaginary foe a vast volley of imaginary balls; then pierce the\r\nair with savage bayonet thrusts. The farce, and yet a most useful farce,\r\nis gone through with. The retreat is ordered to be beat, and all retire;\r\nrefill the armory with their deadly rifles and side arms, and then\r\nreturn to their respective watches, work, or recreation--some gathering\r\nround a canvas checker board; some polishing up bright work; others\r\nmaking pants, shirts, or coats, or braiding light straw hats. Some are\r\naloft, and watching with eager eyes to catch the first glimpse of a sail\r\non the distant horizon; and this he must do from his loftly outlook\r\nbefore the officer of the deck or quartermaster espies one, as they\r\nsweep the sky with their long-reaching glasses--else he may suffer\r\nreprimand and prison fare.\r\n\r\nThese and our meals are epochs which measure out the time, between which\r\nthe minutes and hours pass most wearily, and are filled with longings\r\nfor home or some welcome words from there, the next meal, or the drum\r\nbeat to quarters. Said one to me whose time is not used up as is that of\r\nthe watch officers, by four-hour watches twice in the twenty-four hours:\r\n'When breakfast's done, the next thing I look forward to is dinner, and\r\nwhen that's done, I look for supper time, and then wait in patience till\r\nthe clock strikes ten, and the 'master at arms' knocks at our several\r\ndoors, saying: 'Four bells, gentlemen; lights out, sirs.'' So time drags\r\noften for weeks together. No new excitement fills the head with thought,\r\nand more or less of _ennui_ takes hold on all. In fact, some consider\r\nlife on shipboard not many removes from prison life; and a man\r\noverflowing with the sap of life, whose muscles from head to foot tingle\r\nfor a good mile run across some open field, a tramp through a grand\r\nforest, or climb of some mountain crag, and who loves the freedom of\r\ngood solid _terra firma_--he, I say, feels like a close-caged lion.\r\n\r\nAfter every calm comes a storm, and so, after weeks of listless waiting,\r\ndoing nothing, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, a very gale of bustle\r\ncomes on. 'Sail ho!' comes from the lookout aloft. 'One point off our\r\nstarboard bow!' 'Man the windlass and up anchor!' shouts the officer of\r\nthe deck, as the strange sail bears down steadily toward us, finally\r\nshowing signals which tell us she's a friend and brings a mail. The\r\nIroquois steams out to meet her; their anchors drop, and they hold\r\nfriendly confab. We, too, soon come up, and hear that letters, papers,\r\nfresh meat, and ice await us, on the good old Bay State steamer\r\nMassachusetts. We prepare to lower boats and get our goodies, when we\r\nare told from the Iroquois that a sail lies far off to the N. N. E., and\r\nare ordered off on chase. 'It never rains but it pours,' think we.\r\nLetters, goodies, and now a chance at a prize! 'Begone dull care!' 'Ay,\r\nay, sir!' responds swift-vanishing _ennui_, as our eyes are strained in\r\nthe direction we were told the vessel was seen. No sign of one yet; but\r\nas we enter on our second mile, our lookout cries for the first time: 'A\r\nsail! dead ahead, sir!' After a five miles' run, we near the vessel\r\nsufficiently to make out that she is the brig Perry, one of Uncle Sam's\r\nswiftest sailing vessels, and so we quit chasing, and return to get our\r\nletters and provisions ere the Massachusetts starts again. An hour from\r\nour first meeting we are back, and find her heaving anchor to be off,\r\nfor she runs on time, and may not delay here; so haste away with the\r\nboats, or we lose mails, provisions, and all. The boat returns well\r\nladen with barrels of potatoes, quarter of beef, and chunks of ice, but\r\nno mail. 'Letters and papers all sent on board the Iroquois,' says the\r\nMassachusetts; so if we have any, there they are, but no word of any for\r\nus is sent; so with hearts disappointed, but stomachs rejoicing in the\r\nprospect of ice water and fresh meat, we settle down.\r\n\r\nOur tongues, under red-tape discipline, keep mum, but inwardly we\r\nprotest against this deprivation, brought about by the wild-goose chase\r\non which we were ordered. Well, to-morrow the State of Georgia is\r\nexpected down from Beaufort, and she will bring us a mail, we hope. The\r\nmorrow comes, and at daydawn she heaves in sight, just halting as she\r\nnears the flagship, to report herself returned all right, and then down\r\ntoward us--with a mail, we trust. She is hardly ten ship's lengths away,\r\nwhen she spies a sail to southward, notifies us, and we both make chase.\r\nShe is deeply laden, we but lightly, so we soon outstrip her, and\r\novertake the sail, which is a schooner, and looks suspicious, very. We\r\norder her to 'heave to,' which order is wilfully or unwittingly\r\nmisunderstood. At any rate she does not slacken her speed, till she\r\nfinds our guns brought to bear, and we nearly running her down. Then she\r\nstops: we send a boat with officers and men to board her and see if we\r\nhave really a prize, and all is excitement. One officer offers his share\r\nfor ten dollars--another for twenty--a third for a V, and one for fifty\r\ncents; but would-be salesmen of their shares are far more numerous than\r\nbuyers. And soon the boat returns, reporting the vessel as bound for\r\nPort Royal, with coffee, sugar, and sutlers' stores. Her papers are all\r\nright, and she may go on without further hinderance. Now back to the\r\nState of Georgia for our mails. 'Our mails! our mails!' is the hungry\r\ncry of our almost home-sick hearts. As we get within hailing distance,\r\nwe sing out for our letters, and are answered: 'While you were chasing\r\nthe schooner, we left your mail on board the Iroquois.' 'The devil you\r\ndid!' say some in bitter disappointment, but red tape demands that we\r\nwait till the flagship sees fit to signal us to come for letters. The\r\nhours pass wearily. We have waited weeks for home news, and, now that it\r\nis here, we must wait again--a day, two days--a week even, if it suits\r\nthe flagship's convenience. At last the signals float and read: 'Letters\r\nfor the ----; come and get them.'\r\n\r\nAt last! The seals are broken and we read the news. One tells of a sick\r\nmother, dying, and longing to see her son. Another is from M----'s lady\r\nlove: we know by the way he blushes, the fine hand and closely written\r\npages, and various other symptoms. And our fleet of ironclads are busy\r\nat Charleston. Heaven help the cause they work for! Now we must hasten\r\nwith our answers, to have them ready for sending at a moment's notice,\r\nwhen it is signalled: 'A vessel bound North, and will carry your mails,\r\nif ready.'\r\n\r\nAs the sun goes down, the horizon is lit up with bonfires stretching\r\nalong the coast for miles. 'These fires mean something,' we say\r\nknowingly; 'depend upon it, the rebs expect some vessel in to-night.'\r\nNothing came of it, however, though the following afternoon we saw a\r\nsteamer with two smoke stacks come down the river and take a look,\r\nperhaps to see as to her chances of getting out that night. The twilight\r\ndarkened into night, and night wore on into the small hours, and now we\r\ngazed into the gloom anxiously, for at this time, if any, she would seek\r\nto run out. With straining eyes and the most intense quiet, we listen\r\nfor the sound of paddle wheels. A stranger passing along our decks,\r\nseeing in the darkness the shadowy forms of men crouched in listening\r\nattitudes, would have fancied himself among a body of Indians watching\r\nstealthily some savage prey. The night passes on; gray dawn tells of the\r\nsun's approach, and soon his streaming splendor lights up sea and land.\r\nWe look to see if our hoped for prize still waits in the river, but\r\nno--she is not there. The day wears on and still no signs of her. If she\r\nhas slipped by us, it is through the mouth and not the inlet, we feel\r\nsure, but still are chagrined, and, doubting the possibility of ever\r\ncatching one, go to bed with the blues.\r\n\r\nThe next day we brighten up a little, to be saddened the more, for the\r\nMassachusetts on her return trip tells us that, so far from there being\r\ngood news from Charleston, we have only the worst to hear. The brave\r\nlittle Keokuk is riddled with balls and sunk, and the fleet of ironclads\r\nhave retired from before the city. It is a costly experience, though it\r\nmay yet bear precious fruit, for they tell us it has revealed what was\r\nnecessary to make our next attack successful. What it is, we cannot\r\nlearn, the authorities meaning in the future, doubtless, to wait till\r\ndeeds have won them praise, before they make promises of great work.\r\n\r\nNight draws on again, and we move in toward shore. Signal lights are\r\nburning, and huge bonfires, built behind the forests, that their glare\r\nmay not light up the water, but their reflection against the background\r\nof the sky shows blockade runners the lay and bearings of the land.\r\nSomething will surely be done to-night, and we keep vigilant watch. Two\r\no'clock A. M., and a sound is heard, whether of paddle wheels,\r\nsurf on the beach, or blowing off of steam, we cannot tell. 'It's paddle\r\nwheels,' says our ensign, and reports quickly to the captain. The first\r\nlieutenant springs on deck, a steam whistle is heard, so faint that only\r\nsteam-taught ears know the sound, and word is passed to slip our chain\r\nand anchor, and make chase in the direction of the sound. They spring to\r\nthe chain and work with a will to unshackle it quickly, but things are\r\nnot as they should be; the hammer is not at hand, and the pins not fixed\r\nfor speedy slipping out, even when struck a sharp, heavy blow. 'I think\r\nI see a dark object off the direction of the sound we heard, sir,' says\r\nsome one. 'Confound the chain! will it never unshackle?' they exclaim,\r\nas they seek to unloose it. At last it slips, we steam up, and are off\r\nin pursuit, but which way shall we turn, and where shall we chase? There\r\nis no guiding sound now, and we paddle cautiously on, spending the\r\nbalance of the night in this blind work, feeling for the prize which has\r\nslipped from our fingers, for, as day dawns, we see a large steamer,\r\nsafe under the walls of the fort. If disappointments make philosophers,\r\nwe ought to rank with Diogenes.\r\n\r\nThe next day is filled with growl and 'ifs' and 'ands,' and 'if _this_\r\nhad been so and so,' and 'but for that neglect, which we shall know how\r\nto avoid next time,' etc., etc. The afternoon of another day comes on,\r\nand then a sail is descried, and off we go after it. Seven or eight\r\nmiles' run brings us close to it; still it pays no attention, but keeps\r\nstraight on. The captain orders a ball to be fired across her bows,\r\nwhich explodes so near as to splash great jets of water over them. Her\r\ncrew and captain strike sail, and let go halliards, while they fly\r\nbehind masts, down cockpit, or wherever they can get for safety. Finding\r\nno further harm is meant than to bring them to, they answer back our\r\nhail--say they are going to Beaufort, quite a different direction from\r\nthe one they are heading--and seem generally confused. As an excuse they\r\nsay their compass is out of order, and as they appear to be wreckers, we\r\nallow them to go on without further molestation, and steam back to our\r\nmoorings, consoling ourselves by the fact that these bootless chases are\r\nusing up coal, and thereby hastening the time of our going to Beaufort\r\nto coal up, where we shall have a chance to step once more on _terra\r\nfirma_.\r\n\r\nAnother night passes, and there are no indications of runners having\r\ntried to escape us; but at sunrise we see, far to the south, a schooner,\r\nand soon the flagship signals that a prize has been taken by one of our\r\nfleet. It looks very much like the schooner we let go yesterday, and our\r\nhead officers swear, if it _is_ that schooner, never to let another go\r\nso easily. One declares the vessel is loaded with cotton, and worth at\r\nleast $100,000, but that, notwithstanding, he will sell his share for\r\n$500 in good gold. No one bids so high. Our ensign offers his for one\r\ndollar, and the paymaster sells his to the surgeon for fifty cents, the\r\nmagnificence of which bargain the latter learns from the captain, who\r\nsays his share will be about seven and a half cents! We steam alongside,\r\nand learn that our prize is the schooner St. George, bound for\r\nWilmington, via the Bermudas, with a cargo of salt, saltpetre, etc., and\r\nworth perhaps four thousand dollars. We send our prize list on board the\r\nflagship, and have a nice chat over the capture. It puts us in good\r\nhumor, and our vessels _chassée_ around each other till afternoon, when\r\nwe separate, to hear shortly that the schooner, on being searched, has\r\ndisclosed rich merchandise, gold, Whitworth guns, &c., hidden under her\r\nnominal cargo of salt. So hurra again for our prize list! This _almost_\r\nmakes up for the loss of the steamer.\r\n\r\nAs we are on the point of letting go our anchor, the distant boom of\r\ncannon is heard, and the flagship orders us to repair to the seat of\r\ndanger with all speed. We haste away, and as we go, hear a third gun\r\nfired. It comes from the direction of the brig Perry, and we cut through\r\nthe water toward it, at a twelve-knot rate, for a good half hour, but\r\nhearing no more firing, put in near the shore to watch for the rebel\r\nvessel, as we think those guns were intended to put us on our guard. It\r\nsoon grows dark; lights are ordered out, and each man blinds his port.\r\nNo talking above a whisper must be heard; we are to be still as an\r\narctic night. Midnight passes, and lights still flicker along the shore.\r\nIt is so dark we cannot see the land, though not more than a mile from\r\nit, and only know what it is by our compass and bearings, and the fires\r\nwhich lighten up the clouds in spots right over them. One, two, and\r\nthree o'clock have passed; no sail or sound yet, and the night so dark\r\nwe cannot see a ship's length away. Half past three, and we begin to\r\nheave anchor. The rattle of the chains is just enough to drown the sound\r\nof paddle wheels should a steamer approach, and the sound of her own\r\nwheels would in turn drown our noise; so if one does run in to land, it\r\nmay be over us, for any warning we should have of its whereabout.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the acting master jumps, looks for an instant across the bows\r\ninto the thick darkness, and bids a boy report to the captain and\r\nlieutenant 'a vessel almost on us.' The man at the windlass is stopped,\r\nunshackles the chain, and lets the anchor go with a buoy attached.\r\nCaptain and lieutenant come on deck, and order to blaze away with our\r\nfifty-pound Parrott. Crash! through the still air rings the sharp\r\nreport, and the ball goes whizzing through the gloom, in the direction\r\nthe vessel was seen. The bright flash of the gun, and the thick cloud of\r\nsmoke make the darkness tenfold more impenetrable. For half an hour, we\r\nchase in every direction, then fire again toward the shore. It is just\r\nfour; a gray light is working up through the mist, and we catch the\r\nfaintest glimpse of the Daylight, one of our fleet. A few minutes later,\r\nand we see a speck near the shore, which the spyglass shows to be the\r\nsteamer we chased and fired after in the night. The surf beats about\r\nher; in her frantic efforts to escape, she in the darkness has been run\r\nashore by our close pursuit. We steam up, to get within range and\r\ndestroy, if we cannot take her, when the Daylight, now discovering her,\r\nopens fire. Once, twice, three times she has banged away a broadside at\r\nthe rebel sidewheel, and now the batteries on shore in turn open fire on\r\nher. The sea fog hangs like a shroud over and between us and the land,\r\nwhich looms up mysteriously, stretching its gray length along the\r\nwestern horizon. Spots of fire bursting from the midst of it, tear\r\nthrough the fog cloud right at us. It seems, in its vast, vague\r\nundefinedness, rather an old-time dragon, with mouth spouting fire and\r\nthunder, than harmless earth. The smoke of our own guns settles around\r\nus; our ears ring with our own firing: the excitement of the moment is\r\nintense. The jets of flame seem to spout right at one, and the\r\ninclination to dodge becomes very strong. The Daylight has stopped\r\nfiring: what is the matter? The fog lifts slightly, and as the flagship\r\nadvances to join in the fight, we see that the Daylight is moving back\r\nto reload and let her pass in, which she does, entering the circle of\r\nthe rebel fire, between us and them. She finds it out quickly, for their\r\nguns are brought to bear on her, and the balls strike the water\r\nfrightfully near. She turns, but, as she leaves the fiery circle,\r\ndelivers, one after the other, a whole broadside of guns, followed by\r\nthe Penobscot, who too gives them a few iron pills.\r\n\r\nFrom six to eight A. M., the vessels gather in a cluster at\r\nsafe distance from the land, and the commanders of the different vessels\r\nrepair on board the flagship to consult what next shall be done.\r\nMeanwhile the spyglass shows crowds of rebels along the shore, and great\r\nefforts seem to be making to get the steamer off. Puffs of steam and\r\nclouds of black smoke from her chimneys show that she is blowing off\r\nsteam, firing up, and pushing hard against the shore. Now her paddle\r\nwheels are working; her stern is afloat. Again and again it is reported,\r\n'She's getting herself off the beach; she'll soon be off!' but it does\r\nnot appear to hasten the powers that be, who apparently have decided\r\nthat, as it will not be high tide till nearly one P. M., she is\r\nsafely aground till then.\r\n\r\nFinally, after long delay, it is decided that all hands shall be piped\r\nto breakfast, and we go in for a regular fight afterward. So the\r\nboatswain blows his whistle, and each man goes to his mess. Breakfast is\r\nleisurely gone through with, and then the drum beats all to quarters.\r\nAnd now it looks like serious work. Men gather round their guns eager\r\nfor battle, and the surgeon stands ready, instruments before him, for\r\nwhatever may come. But hardly are they ready for the fight, when the\r\nrebel steamer, with its traitor flag floating high in air, has\r\nextricated itself from the beach, and is steaming down the coast as fast\r\nas it can go. The golden opportunity is lost--was lost when the morning\r\nhour was spent in unnecessary discussion, eating, and drinking. Still\r\nthey try to make up for lost time by rapid firing now, for she may be\r\ntaking in a precious and comforting cargo of arms and other stores of\r\nwar. The shots fall close about her, but a little short. Whitworth guns\r\nprotect her as she goes, for our steamers dare not venture too near\r\nland, lest some long-range ball smash through their steam chests. The\r\nbatteries from which the rebels fired were mostly erected after the\r\nsteamer ran ashore, and seemed to consist principally of field pieces\r\nand guns hastily drawn to the spot, with no earthworks to protect them.\r\nThis speedy work of theirs was in strong contrast to our slow motions.\r\nWith a spyglass we could see telegraph poles stretched along the shore.\r\nThe steamer had probably not been ashore one hour, when eight miles\r\nsouth to the fort, and eight or ten miles north to Wilmington, the news\r\nhad spread of its arrival, and busy hands bestirred themselves, dragging\r\nup guns and ammunition to cover their stranded prize. As soon as\r\nsunlight lit up the beach, squads of men were seen pulling at ropes to\r\nwork the vessel off the sandy beach. While they were thus engaged,\r\nbreakfast was being quietly eaten on board our vessels! We kept up our\r\nfire till the steamer got under the guns of the fort and out of our\r\nreach, and then retired; and so ended our chase in nothing but noise and\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nWe have given the reader a clue to a little of the inefficiency of the\r\nWilmington blockade. In our next paper, we shall endeavor to picture\r\nsome of the effects of naval life on character, and the strange\r\nexperiences one can have on shipboard, even in the monotony of life on a\r\nblockader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKLE, DRAPER; CHURCH AND STATE.\r\n\r\n_FOURTH PAPER._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first paper of this series, reference was made to the Principles\r\nof _Unity_ and _Individuality_ as dominating over distinctive epochs of\r\nthe world's progress; and certain characteristics of each epoch were\r\npointed out which may be briefly recapitulated. Up to a period of time\r\nwhich is commonly said to commence with the publication of Lord Bacon's\r\n_Novum Organum_, the preponderating tendency in all the affairs of\r\nSociety--in Government, in Religion, in Thought, in Practical\r\nActivities--was _convergent_ and toward Consolidation, Centralization,\r\nOrder, or, in one word, _Unity_; with a minor reference only to Freedom,\r\nIndependence, or Individuality. A change then took place, and the\r\nTendency to Unity began to yield, as the _major_ or _chief_ tendency in\r\nsociety, to the opposite or divergent drift toward Disunity or\r\nIndividuality, which gradually came to be pre-eminently active. The\r\nSpirit of Disintegration which thus arose, has exhibited and is still\r\nexhibiting itself in Religious affairs, by the destruction of the\r\nintegrality of the Church, and its division into numerous sects; and in\r\nthe State, by the Democratic principle of popular rule, as opposed to\r\nthe Monarchical theory of the supremacy of one.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived, in the course of our development as a race, at the\r\nculminating point of the second Stage of Progress--the Era of\r\n_Individuality_. The predominant tendency of our time in things\r\nReligious, Governmental, Intellectual, and Practical, is toward the\r\nutter rejection of all clogs upon the personal freedom of Man or Woman.\r\nThis is seen by the neglect into which institutions of all kinds tend to\r\nfall, and the disrespect in which they are held; in the movements for\r\nthe abolition of Slavery and Serfdom; in the recognition of the people's\r\nright of rule, even in Monarchical countries; more radically in the\r\nWoman's Rights Crusade, and in the absolute rejection, by the School of\r\nReformers known as Individualists, of all governmental authority other\r\nthan that voluntarily accepted, as an infringement of the individual's\r\ninherent right of self-sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThis Spirit of Individuality, this desire to throw off all trammels, and\r\nto live in the atmosphere of one's own personality, exhibits itself in a\r\nmarked degree in the literature of our day. It is the animating spirit\r\nof John Stuart Mill's work 'On Liberty'--a work which, as the writer has\r\nelsewhere shown, was substantially borrowed, although without any openly\r\navowed acknowledgment of indebtedness, from an American publication. It\r\nis this spirit which has inspired some of the most remarkable of Herbert\r\nSpencer's Essays; and is distinctively apparent in the Fourth one of the\r\nPropositions which Mr. Buckle affirms to be 'the basis of the history of\r\ncivilization;' and in the general tenor of Prof. Draper's _Intellectual\r\nDevelopment of Europe_.\r\n\r\nThe gist of this doctrine of Individuality, as it is now largely\r\nprevalent in respect to the institutions of the Church and the State,\r\nand which is squarely affirmed in the proposition above mentioned, is\r\nthis: Men and Women do not wish nor do they need a Spiritual Society to\r\nteach them what to believe, nor a Political Society to teach them what\r\nto do. If they are simply left alone, they will thrive well enough. An\r\nEcclesiastical Organization is not only useless, but positively\r\ninjurious; it is a decided hinderance to the progress of humanity; and\r\nthe same is true of a Civil Organization, except in so far as it serves\r\nthe purpose of protection to person and property.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to show in this article the erroneousness of this\r\ndoctrine; to point out that Religious and Political Institutions have,\r\nin the past, been great aids to human advancement; that they are still\r\nso; and will be in the future. In this manner we shall meet the\r\narguments of those who regard such institutions as having always been\r\nunnecessary and a hinderance; and of those who, while considering them\r\nas essential in the past, believe that they are now becoming obsolete,\r\nare detrimental to the cause of human progress, and in the future to be\r\nwholly dispensed with.\r\n\r\nMankind in its entirety resembles a pyramid. At the base are the\r\nignorant and superstitious nations of the earth, comprising the great\r\nmajority of its inhabitants. A step higher includes the next greatest\r\nnumber of nations, in which the people are less ignorant and less\r\ndegraded, but still very low as respects organization and culture. So,\r\nas we rise in the scale of national development, the lines of inclusion\r\ncontinually narrow, until we reach the apex, occupied by the most\r\nadvanced nation or nations.\r\n\r\nThat which is true of nations is so of classes and of individuals\r\ncomposing classes. Every community has its natural aristocracy, its\r\nsuperior men and women. These constitute the top of the pyramid of\r\nSociety; and comprise those in whom intellectual powers, moral purposes,\r\nand practical capacities are most highly developed and combined. Below\r\nthem comes the somewhat larger body of persons who are less endowed in\r\nrespect to the qualities just enumerated. Below these comes, in turn,\r\nthe still greater congregation who are still less gifted; and so on, the\r\nnumber increasing as the range of general capacity decreases, until we\r\nreach the layer which embodies the great mass of Society; who, though\r\nmeasurably affectionate, well-intentioned, and docile, are ignorant,\r\nsuperstitious, and simple minded, wanting in any large degree of high\r\nmoral purpose, and constantly prone to the development of the vicious\r\nand depraved passions incident to this lower stratum of life.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that to meet the needs of these widely different grades of\r\nindividuals, widely different manners, customs, and institutions are\r\nindispensable. Culture, delicacy, and intelligence have their own\r\nattractions, which are wholly diverse from those of crudeness,\r\ncoarseness, and simplicity. The surroundings which would bring happiness\r\nto the lover of art or the man of large mental endowment, would render\r\nmiserable the peasant who still lacked the development to appreciate the\r\nelegancies of refinement; while the tidy cottage and plain comforts\r\nwhich might constitute the paradise of the humble and illiterate rustic,\r\nwould be utterly inadequate to the requirements of larger and more\r\nhighly organized natures.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution and Structure of Society should be of such a nature,\r\ntherefore, for the purposes of human growth and happiness, as to allow\r\nthe needs and wants of every one of its members to be adequately\r\nsupplied. As yet there has been no such arrangement of our social\r\norganization. In nations governed by Monarchical or Aristocratic rule,\r\nthe institutions of the country are made to satisfy the demands of the\r\nprivileged classes; with scarcely any reference to the wants of the\r\nmasses. In Democratic communities, the opposite method is adopted; and\r\nthe character of their public organizations and of their public\r\nopinion--the latter always the most despotic of institutions--is\r\ndetermined by the average notions of the middle class, which ordinarily\r\nfurnishes the bulk of the voters; with little consideration to the\r\ndesires of the higher or the necessities of the lower orders.\r\n\r\nThe institutions of any people, civil or religious, are, therefore,\r\nrepresentative, in the main, of the state of development of the dominant\r\nand controlling class in the community. In a Monarchical or Aristocratic\r\nnation it is the upper portion of the body politic whose condition is\r\nchiefly indicated. In this case, the manners, customs, laws, etc., of\r\nthe country are _in advance_ of the great body of the people, who have\r\nyet to grow up to them. In Democratic states, the manners, customs,\r\nlaws, etc., conform to the stage of advancement which the majority of\r\nthe people have reached. They are thus _above_ the level of the lower\r\nclasses, who are not sufficiently developed to participate in their full\r\nbenefits; and _below_ the capacity of the superior ranks, who, though\r\nfitted for the right use and enjoyment of more liberal and higher social\r\nadaptations, are nevertheless obliged to cramp their natures and dwarf\r\ntheir activities to the measure of the capacities of the more numerous\r\ncircle of citizens.\r\n\r\nThree classes have thus far been named as the _personnel_ of any\r\nSociety. There is, however, a body of individuals which, although made\r\nup of persons from the three classes above indicated, constitute, in a\r\npeculiar sense, a distinct order. This includes the Philosophers, Poets,\r\nScientists--the Thinkers of all kinds--who are in advance of the best\r\ninstitutions of either Monarchical or Democratic countries; who see\r\nfarther into the future than even the great bulk of men of intelligence\r\nand high development; who especially understand the transient nature and\r\ninadequate provisions of existing societies, and feel the need of better\r\nconditions for intellectual, social, and moral growth.\r\n\r\nIt is from this body of men that the incentives to progress chiefly\r\nspring. They behold the errors which encumber old systems--they are,\r\nindeed, too apt to conceive them as _wholly_ composed of errors. To\r\nthem, the common and current beliefs appear to be simply superstitious.\r\nIt irks them that humanity should wallow in its ignorance and blindness.\r\nThey chafe and fret against the organizations which embody and foster\r\nwhat they are firmly convinced is _all_ false. The Church is, in their\r\neyes, only a vast agglomeration of priests, some of them self-deceived\r\nthrough ignorance; most of them not so, but deliberately bolstering up\r\nan obsolete faith for place, profit, and power. The State, both as\r\nexisting in the past and now, is likewise, in their understanding, a\r\ntremendous engine of tyranny, keeping the light of knowledge from the\r\nmasses; withholding liberty; and hindering the prosperity of mankind.\r\n\r\nThat there is much truth in such opinions, too much by far, is not to be\r\ndenied. That Society needs regeneration in all departments of its\r\nlife--political, religious, industrial, and social--is plainly apparent.\r\nBut there is an essential omission in the kind of reform which is\r\nspontaneously taking place at this time, and which is lauded by Mill,\r\nBuckle, Spencer, Draper, and the advanced Thinkers of the day generally,\r\nas the true direction in which change should be made; an omission which\r\nwill bring Society to disastrous revolution, even, it may be, to fatal\r\noverthrow, unless supplied.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of modern reform in reference to the institutions of Church\r\nand State--and these, in the sense in which they are here used, include\r\nall other institutions--is, as has been said, to do away with the former\r\naltogether, and to restrict the latter to the sole functions of\r\nprotection of person and property. Reformatory ideas come, it has also\r\nbeen said, from that small circle of men and women in Society, who are\r\nin advance of the general development of the age even as represented in\r\nthe superior class--meaning by this, the class which, in the average\r\nestimate, occupies the highest position; as, for instance, the\r\nAristocracy in England, and the Wealthy Families of America.\r\n\r\nHuman Society, in all its Institutions, has been, thus far in the\r\nhistory of the world, a thing of spontaneous, instinctual, or automatic\r\ngrowth. There has never been and is not to-day, so far as is publicly\r\nknown, any _Science_ of Social Organization; any System of Laws or\r\nPrinciples embodying the true mode of Social Construction. There has not\r\nbeen, in other words, any discovery of the right Principles upon which\r\nthe affairs of mankind should be conducted in reference to their mutual\r\nrelationships; and hence, there is no real _knowledge_, but only\r\nconjecture, of what are the right relations. _Might_ has always been the\r\naccepted Right and the only Standard of Right in the regulation of\r\nSociety. The opinions of the Ruling Power give tone to human thought and\r\naction. While Kings and Oligarchies were in the ascendency, the Standard\r\nof Right--the King's or the Oligarchs' will--were based on his or their\r\nideas of right. Later, when the People secured the conduct of their own\r\naffairs, the voice of the Majority became the voice of God, as expressed\r\nin the popular motto: _Vox populi, vox Dei_.\r\n\r\nHaving then no Standard of true Social Organization, it is natural,\r\nthough short sighted, that the reformatory party--perceiving the\r\ninsufficiencies and drawbacks of our present Societary Arrangements,\r\nfeeling that _they_ have no need of the Governmental and Religious\r\ninstitutions of the day, that these are, indeed, rather hindrances than\r\naids to _their_ progress--should think that the people of the whole\r\nworld, of the civilized nations, or of one civilized nation, at least,\r\nwere in like state of preparation, and that those Institutions could be\r\nsafely and advantageously dispensed with. There could scarcely be a\r\ngreater mistake. There are but comparatively few individuals in the\r\nworld who are so highly developed in their intellectual and moral\r\ncapacities, and in practical ability also, as to be competent to be a\r\nlaw unto themselves in the general conduct of life. The great mass of\r\nmankind, even in the most advanced communities, need still the guiding\r\nhand of a wisely constituted and really paternal Government, and the\r\nreligious admonitions of a true priesthood. The greatest danger with\r\nwhich Society is threatened in modern times, arises from the lack of\r\nthese essential concomitants of any high civilization. The degradation,\r\nsqualor, ignorance, and brutality of the lowest classes; the\r\nirreverence, disrespect, dishonesty, and moral blindness of the middle\r\norders; and the apathy, heartlessness, unscrupulousness, selfishness,\r\ncupidity, and irreligion of the upper stratum of Society, are alike due\r\nto the absence of a rightly organized State, which should command the\r\nallegiance, and of a rightly constituted Church, which should absorb the\r\ndevotion, of the whole community.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Society must be moulded with reference to the\r\ncharacter of the individuals in it. Of these, some are sagacious,\r\nexecutive, intelligent, benevolent, sympathetic, philanthropic,\r\nself-reliant; possessed of all the qualities, in fine, which inspire\r\nrespect and confidence in their fellow men, and cause them to be\r\nrecognized as leaders. Others are timid, ignorant, feeble-minded,\r\ncredulous, prone to lean upon others, hero worshippers; people whose\r\nnatural bent it is to follow some one in whom they put faith. The\r\nsentiment of loyalty is inherent in the human breast, and will find an\r\nobject whereon to fasten. At one time it is an Alexander; then a\r\nWashington, a Napoleon, or a Wellington; at another, a Clay, a Webster,\r\nor a Grant. There are ranks and orders in Society as there are ranks and\r\norders among individuals. And as the inherent rank of an _individual_\r\nis, as a general rule, recognized and accorded, no matter what may be\r\nthe social constitution of the land in which he lives, so it is with\r\n_classes_. Theoretically, all individuals and orders are equal in the\r\nUnited States. But the Law of Nature is stronger than the laws of man;\r\nand the men and women of superior endowment in moral power, intellectual\r\nforce, or practical ability, receive the voluntary homage of those who\r\nfeel themselves to be inferior.\r\n\r\nIn considering the nature of the Institutions which Society needs, we\r\nhave simply to consider by what mode we may best provide for the normal\r\ntendencies which ever have been and ever will be active in man. It is\r\nnot in our power to change these tendencies, nor to prevent their play.\r\nBut we may so order our social polity as to _assist_ their natural\r\ndrift, or to _obstruct_ it. In the one case, the affairs of the\r\ncommunity are conducted with harmony, and with the least possible\r\nfriction. In the other, they are discordant, and are forced to reach\r\ntheir proximately proper adjustment through antagonism and struggle. It\r\nis the difference between the ship which flies swiftly to her destined\r\nport with favoring winds, fair skies, and peaceful seas, and one which\r\nstruggles wearily to her harbor through adverse gales and stormy waves,\r\nbattered, broken, and tempest tossed. The great mass of the people have\r\nalways looked to the more highly developed of their race for practical\r\nguidance in the secular concerns of life, and for spiritual guidance in\r\nreligious things. That they have done so, and that the Church and the\r\nState have been large factors in the sum of human progress, we shall\r\npresently see. We shall also see brought out more distinctly and clearly\r\nthe fact, that the dominant classes in Society, whether the form of\r\nGovernment be a Monarchy, an Oligarchy, or a Democracy, are, in the\r\nmain, and except, perhaps, in transitional epochs, the classes who\r\npossess, in reality, superior capacities of the quality the age most\r\nrequires in its leaders.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest ages of the world, when brute force was regarded as the\r\nhighest attribute of greatness, the men of might, the renowned warriors,\r\nthe Nimrods and the Agamemnons, occupied the highest pinnacle of\r\nSociety, and received homage from their fellows as supreme men. Of their\r\nage they were the supreme men. To our enlightened epoch, the fighting\r\nheroes of the past are but brutal bullies a little above the level of\r\nthe animals whose powers and habits they so sedulously emulated. But if\r\nwe plant ourselves in thought back in that savage era, if we reflect\r\nthat its habits and instincts were almost wholly physical, that the\r\nchief controlling powers of the time were the arm of might and\r\nsuperstition, and if we ponder a moment upon the force of will, the\r\ndauntless courage, the inexorable rigor, the terrible energy, the\r\nceaseless activity, and the gigantic personal strength which must have\r\ncombined in a single man to have enabled him to rule so turbulent and so\r\nanimal a people; we shall be apt to understand that the only being who\r\ncould, in that age, stand first among his fellows, must have been the\r\nsuperior brute of all.\r\n\r\nIf we consider still further the ferocious natures of the men of that\r\ntime, we shall perceive the necessity which existed for a strong\r\nGovernment, regulating all the affairs of Society, and administered by\r\nthe most severe and savage chieftain; one who could hold all others in\r\nsubjection by the terror of his might, preserve a semblance at least of\r\norder in the community, and protect his subjects from outside wrong.\r\n\r\nBut what could hold _him_ in subjection--an irresponsible despot,\r\nwithout human sympathy, without any awakened sense of moral\r\nresponsibility, capricious, self-willed, ambitious, lustful, vindictive,\r\nwithout self-control, and possessing absolute power over the lives and\r\nproperty of his subjects? Nothing but the dread of an offended God or\r\ngods. And, as a consolidated despotism, wielded by brute force, was the\r\nbest form of Government possible in this age; so a worship based chiefly\r\nupon the incitements and terrors of retributive law--the holding out of\r\ninducements of reward for the good, and of determents of direful\r\npunishment for the wicked, in a future world--was the best religion for\r\nwhich the time was prepared.\r\n\r\nTracing the history of the world down to later times, we shall find the\r\nsame state of things in society at large, until a period which it is\r\ndifficult to fix, but which, we may say, did not fairly begin until the\r\nbeginning or the middle of the eighteenth century. Down to that time,\r\nphysical force was the dominant element among the nations. The great\r\nwarriors were still the prominent men upon the stage of action, though\r\nmany of the brutal characteristics of the earlier ages had disappeared.\r\nThe people were still ignorant, credulous, childlike, and looked to the\r\nFeudal Aristocracy for direction and support--an Aristocracy founded on\r\nsuperiority of warlike talent; thus fitly representing the leading\r\nspirit of the age, and the proper guardians of the people in this\r\nwarlike time. The Catholic Church, and, at a later period, the\r\nProtestant sects, held the upper classes from oppressing the lower, and\r\ntaught the latter to respect and defer to the former. The Feudal Lords\r\nwere thus the Social providence and protection of the poor and weak,\r\nthinking and acting for them in things beyond their range of capacity;\r\nwhile these, in turn, performed the agricultural and other labors to\r\nwhich they were competent. Each class occupied its appropriate position\r\nand fulfilled its legitimate calling. The superior orders held the\r\nsuperior situations; and were recognized for what they really were,\r\nleaders and guides. The masses of the community were faithful and\r\nobedient as followers. The Church inspired each with a feeling of\r\ndevotion to duty, protected the subject and controlled the ruler. In its\r\nfunction of a Governmental arrangement, the Feudal System was admirably\r\nadapted to the necessities of the time. In its religious capacity, the\r\nCatholic Church was the bulwark of Social order during the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nAbout the period of time mentioned above, the warlike spirit which had\r\ntheretofore pervaded the world and controlled its destinies, began to\r\nyield before the enlightenment of civilization. Commercial, industrial,\r\nand intellectual pursuits commenced to assume the leading position among\r\nthe interests of Society. At the same time physical force and hereditary\r\nblood began to give way, as tokens of superior character, to\r\nintellectual greatness and executive commercial ability. The struggle\r\nwhich then commenced between the Aristocracy of Birth and the\r\nAristocracy of Genius in all its forms, mental or practical, is still\r\npending in the Old World. In America it has declared itself in favor of\r\nthe latter. The only Noblemen here recognized are those of Nature's\r\nmake--those who bear in their organizations and culture the stamp of\r\nsuperiority. These are, in the main, quickly recognized and\r\nacknowledged; whether they exhibit their genius in the field of\r\nLiterature, Science, Invention, Government, Religion, Art--or in the\r\nthousand Commercial and Industrial Enterprises which are characteristic\r\nof this era, and especially of this country.\r\n\r\nWith the breaking up of the Feudal System and the advent of modern\r\ncommercial activities, a great change took place in the organization of\r\nSociety. Under this system a community was, as has been indicated, made\r\nup in such a manner that the whole body formed, so to speak, one family,\r\nhaving mutual interests; each individual performing those functions--for\r\nthe benefit of the whole--for which he was, as a general rule, best\r\nfitted. The most warlike, sagacious, executive--those, in short, who\r\nwere best capacitated for leaders and protectors, being at the head, and\r\nlooking after the welfare of the whole; while others occupied such\r\nstations and rendered such services as their qualifications made them\r\nadequate to, in subordination to these leaders. Thus the interests of\r\ncommunity were linked immediately together. They formed a grand\r\nCoöperative Association, in which each member recognized his obligations\r\nto the whole body of associates, and to every individual associate, _and\r\nmeasurably fulfilled those obligations as they were understood at that\r\nday_. The poor were not left to fall into starvation and misery for the\r\nwant of work; there were no paupers; and the rich and powerful classes\r\ndid not neglect the affairs of the indigent and weak as those who had no\r\nclaim upon them. On the contrary, they felt that mankind were the\r\nchildren of one Father, and their brethren. They felt that their\r\nsuperior powers devolved upon them accompanying responsibilities; that\r\nbecause they were comparatively far seeing and strong, they were bound\r\nby all the nobler sentiments of manhood to watch over and guide the\r\nshort sighted and the feeble. Under the inspiration of the Catholic\r\nChurch--a Church whose persistent efforts were ever devoted in a marked\r\ndegree to the amelioration of the physical no less than the spiritual\r\nconditions of humanity, a Church which strove in the darkest hours of\r\nits history and always to stand between the helpless and suffering and\r\ntheir oppressors--they accepted this office and fulfilled its functions.\r\nTo the beat of their understanding--with the light they then had,\r\nconsidering the times in which they lived, and the state of the world's\r\nprogress--they executed well and faithfully the duties which pertained\r\nto it. Far better, indeed, as we shall presently see, than the opulent\r\nand powerful perform the same duties in our day.\r\n\r\nWith the commencement of more peaceful times and the gradual\r\ncivilization of Society, the necessity of personal protection which had,\r\nin great measure, given rise to the Feudal System, passed away. Civil\r\nlaw acquired the protective power which had formerly resided in the arm\r\nof physical force. Travel became safe. The accumulations of industry\r\nwere less liable to be wrenched from their legitimate owner by the hand\r\nof the robber. There was a rapid opening up of intelligence among the\r\nmasses. Individual energy was stimulated. Commerce received a wonderful\r\nimpetus. The bounds of personal freedom were enlarged. Men felt no\r\nlonger the necessity of association for the sake of safety. They felt,\r\nmoreover, the restless surging of new-born powers within them; and\r\nlonged to give them exercise. So the old forms of community life were\r\nslowly broken up. Individuals embarked in various enterprises; now no\r\nlonger consociated with others in mutual coöperation, but for their\r\nindividual benefit. Thus _competitive_ industry gradually supplanted the\r\nold method of _coöperative_ or _associated_ industry, as seen in its\r\ncrude and imperfect form, and the inauguration of the false and selfish\r\nsystem which still prevails began.\r\n\r\nThere could be but one result to a mode of commercial and industrial\r\ntraffic and a system of labor and wages which pits the various classes\r\nof Society together in a strife for the wealth of the world, the\r\nfundamental principle of which strife is, _that it is perfectly right to\r\ntake advantage of the necessities of our neighbors in order to obtain\r\ntheir means for our own enrichment_.\r\n\r\nFor this was the principle which instinctively sprang up in the world as\r\nthe basis of business, and which has never been changed. Traffic\r\noriginated in the necessities of life, and was extended by the desire to\r\nobtain wealth. Each individual perceived some want in his neighbor, and\r\nforthwith proceeded to supply this want, _charging just as much for the\r\nthing supplied as the desire for the article or his need of it would\r\nforce the person supplied to pay; without reference to the equitable\r\nprice, estimated with respect to the labor bestowed in supplying the\r\nwant_. This principle of trade, originating in the most complete\r\nselfishness, and, viewed from any high moral point, both unjust and\r\ndishonest, has always been and is to-day the fundamental principle of\r\nour Political Economy. That 'a thing is worth what it will bring,' is a\r\nbasic axiom of all trade. The only price which is recognized in commerce\r\nis the market price; which is, again, what a commodity will bring. What\r\na commodity will bring is what the necessities of mankind will make them\r\npay. Thus is exhibited the curious spectacle of the existence of a\r\nReligion which inculcates good will and love to our neighbor as the\r\nfoundation of all true civilization and virtue, coexisting side by side\r\nwith a Commercial System, a relic, like slavery, of ancient barbarism,\r\nwhich forces all men to traffic with each other on the principle that\r\nour neighbor is an object of legitimate prey.\r\n\r\nOf course, in a System of Competitive Industry thus carried on, the\r\nwealth of the world would fall into the hands of those of superior\r\npowers; while the feeble, the stolid, and the ignorant would be left\r\npoor and helpless. And, as the different classes of the community would\r\nbe no longer directly associated with each other in their labors and\r\ninterests, but would be, on the contrary, competitors--and as the fact\r\nthat there had been free competition would be held by all classes to\r\nabsolve them from any responsibility as to each other's welfare--it\r\nwould inevitably result that the weaker orders should fall into\r\nindigence, degradation, wretchedness, starvation, and premature death.\r\n\r\nSuch has been the case. With the advent of Competitive Industry in\r\nEurope and America--to confine ourselves to these countries--with the\r\ndisintegration of the Social System in which the different classes were\r\nassociated in mutually dependent and coöperative efforts; with the\r\nabrogation, on the part of the superior body of citizens, of all\r\nresponsibility for, and direct interest in, the affairs and comfort of\r\nthe lower orders, has come Pauperism, Social Instability, and a degree\r\nof misery and depravity among the poorest of the masses, never before\r\nknown in the history of the world, all things being taken into\r\nconsideration. It is a well-known saying of Political Economists, that\r\nthe rich are daily growing richer, and the poor poorer. It might be\r\nadded with truth: and more degraded and dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this method of Competitive Industry upon the higher\r\nclasses have been scarcely less injurious, though in a different\r\ndirection. It has bred an intense selfishness and an apathy in respect\r\nto the sufferings of others which no lover of his race can contemplate\r\nwithout emotions of anguish. Not only is the idea of any effort for the\r\npermanent relief of the poorer classes, for taking them under special\r\ncare and making their welfare the business of Society, not entertained\r\nby any large number of persons; but those who do feel keenly the\r\nnecessity of such a step, and whose sympathies are aroused by the\r\nsufferings of the masses around them, are too deeply imbued with the\r\nease-loving spirit of the age, too much wedded to their own comfort, to\r\ntake any active measures for the realization of their desires, or to\r\nforego their momentary interests to secure them.\r\n\r\nThe rich heap up riches by the iniquitous trade-system which drifts the\r\nearnings of the laborers into their net, and are dead to the call of\r\nthose whom they are, unconsciously in most cases, defrauding. Nay! they\r\neven struggle to wring from them the largest possible amount of work for\r\nthe smallest possible pay! Day by day they grow more exacting as they\r\ngrow wealthier; day by day the laboring orders sink into more harassing\r\nand hopeless conditions. Had the functions of Government in our own\r\ncountry and in England been those only of protection to persons and\r\nproperty; had not the general and local authorities in some degree\r\nassisted the oppressed toilers; had not the Church by her admonitions\r\nand pleadings kept some sparks of feeling alive in the breast of the\r\npeople of this money-getting age, and stimulated somewhat their\r\nbenevolence, the laboring classes of England and America would long\r\nsince have sunk to utter destitution. Nor would this have been all. For\r\nwhen the mass of the people reach such a point; when they are driven to\r\ndespair, as they are now fast being driven, and would long ago have been\r\ndriven but for the circumstances stated, then comes the terrible\r\nreaction, the frightful revolution, the upheaval of all order, anarchy,\r\nand--who shall tell what else? The Riot of July is still ringing its\r\nsolemn warning--all unheeded--in the ears of this people. Society has\r\nyet and speedily to lift the masses out of their ignorance, poverty,\r\nsqualor, and accompanying brutality, or to sink awfully beneath their\r\nmaddened retaliation.\r\n\r\nIn thus criticizing the Industrial Polity of modern times as, in the\r\nrespects indicated, inferior to that of the Feudal System, the writer\r\ndoes not wish to be understood as affirming any more than is really\r\nsaid. The idea which it is desired to express is this: that the plan\r\nupon which this system was founded--the mutual interdependence of\r\nclasses and their reciprocally coöperative labor--was far superior to\r\nthe method of Competitive Industry now in vogue; and the true type--when\r\nrightly carried out, without the drawbacks and the evils of the Feudal\r\nSystem--of Social organization. That there are compensations in our\r\nmodern mode, and that, on the whole, Society advances in adopting it, is\r\ntrue. But it will take a further step in advance when it reverts to that\r\nplan on the footing above indicated; when it adopts the _plan_ without\r\nthe evils which in an ignorant and undeveloped age necessarily\r\naccompanied it.\r\n\r\nIt has not been forgotten that the Church has arrayed itself, to no\r\nsmall extent, against the advent of new knowledge; that the State has\r\nsuppressed the enlarging tendencies of individual liberty; and that both\r\nhave been, in this way and in other ways, as Mr. Buckle and Professor\r\nDraper have clearly shown, clogs upon the hurrying wheels of the\r\nnations. It is precisely because they _have_ been and _are_ still so,\r\nthat they served and do serve the cause of progress.\r\n\r\nIt has been previously stated that new truths come from the body of\r\nadvanced Thinkers, who constitute a fourth and comparatively small class\r\nin the community. The discoverer of a new truth sees the immense\r\nadvantages which would accrue to Society from a knowledge of it, and is\r\neager for its immediate promulgation and acceptance; and, if it be of a\r\npractical nature, for its incorporation into the working principles of\r\nthe Social polity. This may be true. But there is another verity of\r\nequal importance, which ordinarily he does not take into consideration,\r\nnamely: that the great mass of the people who form Society are not\r\nprepared for the change which he contemplates. They comprehend and act\r\nmore slowly than the Thinkers. The novelty must be brought home to their\r\nunderstandings gradually, and assimilated. Old forms of thought, old\r\nassociations, encrusted prejudices, the deep-seated opinions of years\r\nmust be modified before the new will find a lodgment in their\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nIt is well that the Thinker should urge with impetuous and ardent zeal\r\nhis side of the case; that he should insist upon the immediate\r\nadjustment of thought or activity in accordance with advanced right. It\r\nis true that he will not instantly succeed. It is equally true that,\r\nwith human nature and Society as they now are, he would destroy all\r\norder if he did. Men can live only in that portion of truth which they\r\nare competent to appreciate. Place the Indian in the heated city, and\r\nmake him conform to the usages of city life, he pines and dies. If it\r\nwere possible to take away from the ignorant and child-minded races of\r\nthe earth or portions of community their superstitious faith, and\r\nsubstitute the higher truths of a more spiritual interpretation, yet\r\nwould they not subserve their religious purposes. So, when the new\r\nverity is held up to view, to the great mass who cannot understand it,\r\nit is no truth, but a lie. They oppose it. Thus the discovery becomes\r\nknown. Discussion excites new thought. The Thinkers array themselves\r\nupon one side, urging forward; the State and the Church, representing\r\nthe body of Society, take the other, standing sturdily still, or\r\nhesitating, doubting either the validity of the alleged truth or its\r\nuses. Between the clash of contending opinions the new ideas take shape\r\nin the awakened minds which are prepared for them. These come shortly to\r\nbe the majority. The State and the Church gradually and imperceptibly\r\nmodify their methods or their creeds; and so, safely and without\r\ndisaster, humanity takes a step in advance.\r\n\r\nIt would be better, indeed, if this slow process were not necessary.\r\nWhen the whole scope of Fundamental Truths is apprehended; when a\r\nScience of the Universe is known; when truth is no longer fragmentary;\r\nand when there is mutual confidence and coöperation among the different\r\nclasses of community, it will not be necessary. But until then, any\r\nattempt to force an instantaneous acceptance of new truths or an\r\nimmediate inauguration of new methods upon the mass of the people will\r\nonly serve, if successful, to overthrow order in Society, and introduce\r\nSocial anarchy in its stead. From such an attempt came the chaos of the\r\nFrench Revolution;--from an endeavor to inaugurate ideas essentially\r\ncorrect among a people noway ready to comprehend them rightly. The\r\nConservative Element is as essential to the well-being of society as the\r\nProgressive. To eliminate either is to destroy its balanced action; and\r\nto give it over to stagnation on the one hand, or to frenzy on the\r\nother. The Thinkers of the past have done, and those of the present are\r\ndoing, good work for humanity, on the Progressive side. The Church and\r\nthe State of the past have done, the Church and the State of the present\r\nare doing, good work for humanity, on the Conservative side. Through the\r\ninstrumentality of the Thinkers, the Church, and the State, the world\r\nhas been brought slowly, steadily, and safely along the path of\r\nprogress, now gaining in one way, and now in another; at times\r\nabandoning one line of advance, only to go ahead upon a different one;\r\nyet always moving onward, and standing to-day, in spite of its seeming\r\nretrogressions, at the highest point of development which it has ever\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nThe Church and the State of the future will be the subject of subsequent\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOKOUT MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nFor months that followed the triumph the rebels had boasted they wrought,\r\nBut which lost to them Chattanooga, thus bringing their triumph to nought;\r\nThe mountain-walled citadel city, with its outposts in billowy crowds,\r\nGrand soarers among the lightnings, stern conquerors of the clouds!\r\nFor months, I say, had the rebels, with the eyes of their cannon, looked\r\n   down\r\nFrom the high-crested forehead of Lookout, from the Mission's long sinuous\r\n   crown\r\nTill GRANT, our invincible hero, the winner of every fight!\r\nWho joys in the strife, like the eagle that drinks from the storm delight!\r\nMarshalled his war-worn legions, and, pointing to them the foe,\r\nKindled their hearts with the tidings that now should be stricken the blow,\r\nThe rebel to sweep from old Lookout, that cloud-post dizzily high,\r\nWhence the taunt of his cannon and banner had affronted so long the sky.\r\n\r\nBrave THOMAS the foeman had brushed from his summit the nearest, and now\r\nThe balm of the midnight's quiet soothed Nature's agonized brow:\r\nA midnight of murkiest darkness, and Lookout's dark undefined mass\r\nHeaved grandly a frown on the welkin, a barricade nothing might pass.\r\nIts breast was sprinkled with sparkles, its crest was dotted in gold,\r\nTelling the camps of the rebels secure as they deemed in their hold.\r\nWhere glimmered the creek of the Lookout, it seemed the black dome of the\r\n   night\r\nHad dropped all its stars in the valley, it glittered so over with light:\r\nThere were voices and clashings of weapons, and drum beat and bugle and\r\n   tramp,\r\nQuick flittings athwart the broad watchfires that spotted the grays of the\r\n   camp:\r\nDark columns would glimmer and vanish, a rider flit by like a ghost;\r\nThere was movement all over the valley, the movement and din of a host.\r\n\r\n'Twas the legion so famed of the 'White Star,' and led on by GEARY the\r\n   brave,\r\nThat was chosen to gather the laurel or find on the mountain a grave.\r\nThey crossed the dim creek of the Lookout, and toiled up the sable ascent,\r\nTill the atoms black crawling and struggling in the dense upper darkness\r\n   were blent.\r\nMists, fitful in rain, came at daydawn, they spread in one mantle the\r\n   skies,\r\nAnd we that were posted below stood and watched with our hearts in our\r\n   eyes;\r\nWe watched as the mists broke and joined, the quick flits and the blanks of\r\n   the fray;\r\nThere was thunder, but not of the clouds; there was lightning, but redder\r\n   in ray;\r\nOh, warm rose our hopes to the 'White Star,' oh, wild went our pleadings\r\n   to heaven;\r\nWe knew, and we shuddered to know it, how fierce oft the rebels had\r\n   striven;\r\nWe saw, and we shuddered to see it, the rebel flag still in the air;\r\nShall our boys be hurled back? God of Battles! oh, bring not such bitter\r\n   despair!\r\n\r\nBut the battle is rolling still up, it has plunged in the mantle o'erhead,\r\nWe hear the low hum of the volley, we see the fierce bomb-burst of red;\r\nStill the rock in the forehead of Lookout through the rents of the windy\r\n   mist shows\r\nThe horrible flag of the Crossbar, the counterfeit rag of our foes:\r\nPortentous it looks through the vapor, then melts to the eye, but it tells\r\nThat the rebels still cling to their stronghold, and hope for the moment\r\n   dispels.\r\nBut the roll of the thunder seems louder, flame angrier smites on the eye,\r\nThe scene from the fog is laid open--a battle field fought in the sky!\r\nEye to eye, hand to hand, all are struggling;--ha, traitors! ha, rebels,\r\n   ye know\r\nNow the might in the arm of our heroes! dare ye bide their roused terrible\r\n   blow?\r\nThey drive them, our braves drive the rebels! they flee, and our heroes\r\n   pursue!\r\nWe scale rock and trunk--from their breastworks they run! oh, the joy of\r\n   the view!\r\n\r\nHurrah, how they drive them! hurrah, how they drive the fierce rebels\r\n   along!\r\nOne more cheer, still another! each lip seems as ready to burst into song.\r\nOn, on, ye bold blue-coated heroes! thrust, strike, pour your shots in\r\n   amain!\r\nBanners fly, columns rush, seen and lost in the quick, fitful gauzes of\r\n   rain.\r\nOh, boys, how your young blood is streaming! but falter not, drive them\r\n   to rout!\r\nFrom barricade, breastwork, and riflepit, how the scourged rebels pour out!\r\nWe see the swift plunge of the caisson within the dim background of haze,\r\nWith the shreds of platoons inward scudding, and fainter their batteries\r\n   blaze;\r\nAs the mist curtain falls all is blank; as it lifts, a wild picture out\r\n   glares,\r\nA wild shifting picture of battle, and dread our warm hopefulness shares;\r\nBut never the braves of the 'White Star' have sullied their fame in defeat,\r\nAnd they will not to-day see the triumph pass by them the foeman to greet!\r\n\r\nNo, no, for the battle is ending; the ranks on the slope of the crest\r\nAre the true Union blue, and our banners alone catch the gleams of the\r\n   west,\r\nThough the Crossbar still flies from the summit, we roll out our cheering\r\n   of pride!\r\nNot in vain, O ye heroes of Lookout! O brave Union boys! have ye died!\r\nOne brief struggle more sees the banner, that blot on the sky, brushed\r\n   away,\r\nWhen the broad moon now basking upon us shall yield her rich lustre to-day:\r\nShe brings out the black hulk of Lookout, its outlines traced sharp in\r\n   the skies,\r\nAll alive with the camps of our braves glancing down with their numberless\r\n   eyes.\r\nSee, the darkness below the red dottings is twinkling with many a spark!\r\nSergeant Teague thinks them souls of the rebels red fleeing from ours in\r\n   the dark;\r\nBut the light shocks of sound tell the tale, they are battle's fierce\r\n   fireworks at play!\r\nIt is slaughter's wild carnival revel bequeathed to the night by the day.\r\n\r\nDawn breaks, the sky clears--ha! the shape upon Lookout's tall crest that\r\n   we see,\r\nIs the bright beaming flag of the 'White Star,' the beautiful Flag of the\r\n   Free!\r\nHow it waves its rich folds in the zenith, and looks in the dawn's open\r\n   eye,\r\nWith its starred breast of pearl and of crimson, as if with heaven's colors\r\n   to vie!\r\n'Hurrah!' rolls from Moccasin Point, and 'Hurrah!' from bold Cameron's\r\n   Hill!\r\n'Hurrah!' peals from glad Chattanooga! bliss seems every bosom to fill!\r\n\r\nThanks, thanks, O ye heroes of Lookout! O brave Union boys! during Time\r\nShall stand this, your column of glory, shall shine this, your triumph\r\n   sublime!\r\nTo the deep mountain den of the panther the hunter climbed, drove him to\r\n   bay,\r\nThen fought the fierce foe till he turned and fled, bleeding and gnashing,\r\n   away!\r\nFled away from the scene where so late broke his growls and he shot down\r\n   his glare,\r\nAs he paced to and fro, for the hunter his wild craggy cavern to dare!\r\n\r\nThanks, thanks, O ye heroes of Lookout! ye girded your souls to the fight,\r\nDrew the sword, dropped the scabbard, and went in the full conscious\r\n   strength of your might!\r\nNow climbing o'er rock and o'er tree mound, up, up, by the hemlock ye\r\n   swung!\r\nNow plunging through thicket and swamp, on the edge of the hollow ye hung!\r\nOne hand grasped the musket, the other clutched ladder of root and of\r\n   bough:\r\nThe trunk the tornado had shivered, the landmark pale glimmering now,\r\nAnd now the mad torrent's white lightning;--no drum tapped, no bugle\r\n   was blown--\r\nTo the words that encouraged each other, and quick breaths, ye toiled up\r\n   alone!\r\nOh, long as the mountains shall rise o'er the waters of bright Tennessee,\r\nShall be told the proud deeds of the 'White Star,' the cloud-treading host\r\n   of the free!\r\nThe camp-fire shall blaze to the chorus, the picket-post peal it on high,\r\nHow was fought the fierce battle of Lookout--how won THE GRAND FIGHT OF\r\n   THE SKY!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nFrom the window at which I write, in these November days, I see a muddy,\r\nswollen river, spread over the meadows into a dingy lake; it is not a\r\npicturesque or a pretty stream, in spite of its Indian name. Beyond it\r\nthe land slopes away into a range of long, low hills, which the autumn\r\nhas browned; the long swaths of fog stretching between river and hill\r\nare so like to them and to the dissolving gray sky that they all blend\r\nin one general gloom. This picture filling my eye narrows and shapes\r\nitself into the beginning of my story: I see a lazy, dirty river on the\r\noutskirts of a manufacturing city; where the stream has broadened into a\r\nsort of pond it is cut short by the dam, and there is a little cluster\r\nof mills. They all belong to one work, however, and they look as if they\r\nhad been set down there for a few months only; 'contract' seems written\r\nall over them, and very properly, for they are running on a Government\r\norder for small arms. There is no noise but an underhum of revolving\r\nshafts and the smothered thud of trip hammers. Ore dust blackens\r\neverything, and is scattered everywhere, so that the whole ground is a\r\npatchwork of black and gray; elsewhere there is snow, but here the snow\r\nis turned to the dingy color of the place. It is very quiet outside,\r\nbeing early morning yet; a cold mist hides the dawn, and the water falls\r\nwith a winter hiss; the paths are indistinct, for the sky is only just\r\nenough lightening to show the east.\r\n\r\nThe coal dust around one door shows that the fires are there; a\r\ncavernous place, suddenly letting a lurid glow out upon the night, and\r\nthen black again. It is only a narrow alley through the building, making\r\nsure of a good draft; on one side are the piles of coal, and on the\r\nother a row of furnace doors. The stoker is sitting on a heap of\r\ncinder. He is only an old man, a little stooping, with a head that is\r\nturning ashes color; his eye is faded, and his face nearly\r\nexpressionless, while he sits perfectly still on the heap, as if he were\r\na part of the engine which turns slowly in a shed adjoining and pants\r\nthrough its vent in the roof. He has been sitting there so long that he\r\nhas a vague notion that his mind has somehow gone out of him into the\r\niron doors and the rough coal, and he only goes round and round like the\r\nengine. Yet he never considered the matter at all, any more than the\r\nengine wanted to use its own wheel, which it turned month after month in\r\nthe same place, to propel itself through the world; just so often he\r\nopened and shut each door in its turn, fed the fires, and then sat down\r\nand sat still.\r\n\r\nHe was looking at a boy of six, asleep at his feet on a pile of ashes\r\nand cinder, which was not so bad a bed, for the gentle heat left in it\r\nwas as good as a lullaby, and Shakspeare long ago told us that sleep has\r\na preference for sitting by hard pillows. The child was an odd bit of\r\nhumanity. An accident at an early age had given it a hump, though\r\notherwise it was fair enough; and now perhaps society would have seen\r\nthere only an animal watching its sleeping cub. Presently the boy woke\r\nand got on his feet, and began to walk toward the cold air with short,\r\nuncertain steps, almost falling against a furnace door. The old man\r\njumped and caught him.\r\n\r\n'Ta, ta, Nobby,' he said, 'what's thou doin'? Them's hotter nor cender.\r\nBurnt child dreads fire--did knowst 'twas fire?'\r\n\r\nHe had a sort of language of his own, and his voice was singularly\r\nharsh, as if breathing in that grimy place so long had roughened his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n'There, go, Nobby, look thee out an' see howst black she is. Ta, but\r\nit's hawt,' and he rubbed his forehead with his sleeve; 'it's a deal\r\npity this hot can nawt go out where's cold, an' people needin' it.\r\nHere's hot, there's cold, but 'twill stay here, as it loved the place\r\n'twas born--home, like. Why, Net, that thee?'\r\n\r\nThere was no door to the place to knock at or open, but the craunch of a\r\nfoot was heard on the coal outside, and a girl came in, moist and\r\nshivering. The stoker set her down in a warm corner, and looked at her\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n'Is thee, my little Net?' he repeated.\r\n\r\n'Yes, and I've brought your breakfast, father; 'twas striking six before\r\nI come in.'\r\n\r\n'Too early, my girl, sleep her sleep out. Here's hot an' cosey like, an'\r\ntime goes, an' I could wait for breakfast, till I'm home. I'll nawt let\r\nmy little girl's sleep.'\r\n\r\n'No, father, I couldn't sleep after five, anyway; and I thought I must\r\nbring your breakfast to-day. You'll walk back through the cold easier\r\nafter something hot to eat.'\r\n\r\n'That's my dear little girl. Shiverin' yet, she is. There, lay down on\r\nthis,' raking out a heap of fresh ashes, 'them warm an' soft like, an'\r\ngo ye to sleep till I go.'\r\n\r\n'No, I must heat your coffee,' she answered, steadying the pot before\r\none of the furnaces with bits of coal.\r\n\r\n''Ware that door doan' fly back an' hurt ye; them does so sometimes.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I'll be careful. Why, you've got Whitney here!'\r\n\r\n'He come down to-night, Net. By himself, somehow, though I doan' knaw\r\nhow Lord kep' his short feet from the river bank an' the floom. An' he\r\ncouldn't go back, nor I couldn't go with him. He's slep' on the cender,\r\nnice; all's a cradle to Nobby.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, cinder's a good bed, when the eyes are shut,' said the girl,\r\nbitterly. 'The coffee was smoking hot when I started, but it's cold out\r\nthis morning, so there's all this to be done over.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, outdoors has cooled it. The world was hungry, like, an' wanted to\r\neat it. Small nubbin' for all the world, but it stole the hot an' the\r\nsmell o' the meat.'\r\n\r\nThe girl did not reply to this bit of pleasantry. She was about\r\neighteen, and her face would have been strikingly pretty except for the\r\neager, hungering look of the eye; but in every motion, every look, and\r\neven the way in which she wore her neat and simple clothing, there was\r\nthe word 'unsatisfied.'\r\n\r\nFinally, she brought coffee and meat to him.\r\n\r\n'Here, Net, take ye a sip,' said he; ''twill warm ye nice. Shiverin' yet\r\nshe is; 'deed the mornin's clammy cold; there's naw love in thet. Drink!\r\nI cawnt take ye home so, an' my time's most up; it's gettin' light.'\r\n\r\nBut she refused it, and sat and watched him as he ate, never taking her\r\neyes from his face.\r\n\r\n'Father,' she presently said, 'what do you do here?'\r\n\r\nThe old stoker laughed: 'Do, my girl? Why, keep up the fires. It's like\r\nI'm a spoke in a wheel or summut. I keeps the fires, an' the fires makes\r\nthe angeen go, an' thet turns the works thet makes the pistols, so't\r\nfolks may kill theirsel's. There's naw peace anywheres in the world.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't mean that; but what do you do the rest of the time? Don't you\r\nthink? Aren't you tired of this place, father?'\r\n\r\n'Sometimes it's like I think so; but how's the use, my Net? Here's\r\nrough, an' here's rough too,' touching his chest. 'On smooth floors,\r\nsuch as I couldn't work, if we could get there. How's the use o' bein'\r\ntired? We've got to keep steady at summut. It's best to be content, like\r\nNobby there; cender's as good a bed as the king's got.'\r\n\r\n'Well, if you _were_ tired, you're going to rest now, so I wish you\r\nwere.'\r\n\r\n'What's that mean?'\r\n\r\n'You've got through here, that's all,' cried the girl, with a smothered\r\nsob.\r\n\r\nHe set down his pot of coffee and his pail: 'Who told ye so?' he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n'Margery Eames.'\r\n\r\nCatching the girl's hand, the old man half dragged her through the\r\nopening into a yard devoted to coal storage. Picking their way through\r\nthe spotted mire, they entered a shed where trip hammers were pounding\r\nin showers of sparks, stepped over a great revolving shaft, and came to\r\na stairway; up, up, to the fifth floor, where the finishing rooms were.\r\n\r\nFaint daylight was straggling through the narrow windows, and most of\r\nthe lamps were out, those that were burning being very sickly, as if\r\nthey did it under protest. A number of women were employed here, because\r\nmuch of the work was merely automatic, and just now men were scarce and\r\nwomen would work cheaper. The women were coarse and rough, rather the\r\nscum of the city--perhaps some might have fallen; but the place was\r\nnoisome and grimy, with a sickening smell of oil everywhere, repulsive\r\nenough to be fit for any workers.\r\n\r\nThe stoker and his daughter walked to the farther end, and came to where\r\na little group of women were sitting round a bench; one of the group\r\ntipped a wink to the rest.\r\n\r\n'How's coal an' fires now, Adam?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Did ye tell my girl anythin'?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'Of course I did.'\r\n\r\n'What was't then?'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said she, wiping her greasy hands on the bosom of her dress, 'I\r\nwatched on the road for her this morning, an' I told her.'\r\n\r\n'_What?_'\r\n\r\n'I told her she needn't try to put on airs, she was only a stoker's\r\ndaughter, an' he'll not have that place any more.'\r\n\r\n'Did ye knaw she didn't knaw't?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. What do you care, old dusty? She's got a good place.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, she has, Lord's good for't.'\r\n\r\n'Shall we fight it out, Adam? Hold on till I wipe my hands.'\r\n\r\n'Nawt till one can fight by hersel', Margery. I forgive yer spite, an'\r\nhope Lord woan' bring it back to ye ever. What's said can nawt be\r\nhelped. Come, Net.'\r\n\r\n'You're a mean creature, Margery, to tell him that,' said one, after\r\nthey were gone. 'I expected to hear you tell him about the place his\r\ngirl's got. Lord! he's innocent as a baby about it, an' thinks she's on\r\nthe way up, while everybody else knows it, an' knows it's the way down.'\r\n\r\n''Tis that,' said Margery, 'but I've that much decency that I didn't say\r\nit. Let the old man take one thing at a time; he'll know it soon enough\r\nwhen she fetches up at the bottom.'\r\n\r\n'What did you want to trouble old Adam for?'\r\n\r\n'Because I did!' cried the woman, with a sudden flash; 'because I like\r\nto hurt people. _I've_ been struck, an' stabbed, an' bruised, an'\r\nseared, an' people pointin' fingers at me, whose heart wasn't fouler'n\r\ntheirs, if my lips were. It's all cut an' slash in the world, an' the\r\nonly way to get on with pain when you're hit, is to hit somebody else.\r\nI'd rather find a soft spot in somebody than have a dollar give me,\r\nsure's my name's Margery. What business has he to have any feelin's,\r\nworkin' year after year down there in the coal? Why haven't people been\r\ngood to _me_? I never come up here into this grease; people sent me; an'\r\nwhen hit's the game I'll do my part. I hope his girl's a comfort to him;\r\nhe'll be proud enough of her some time, you see.'\r\n\r\nAdam seated his girl again, opened the doors one after another, and\r\nraked and fed the fires; then he shut them, and stood his rake in the\r\ncorner, and seated himself.\r\n\r\n'Well, it's come out,' he said; 'but I didn't mean ye should know, yet.\r\nMargery's ill willed, but it's like she didn't think.'\r\n\r\n'I oughtn't to have told you till after to-morrow, father.'\r\n\r\n'There's how't seems hard, thet it must come to Christmas. An' when I've\r\nbeen here so long, twenty year noo, Net.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't call me that any more, father; I don't like it.'\r\n\r\n'Why nawt, little girl? What should I call her? You used to love to hear\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'Not now, not now,' said the girl, in a choking voice, 'not to-day, not\r\ntill Christmas is over. Call me Jane.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, twenty year ago I come here, an' I've been settin' on them piles\r\no' cender ever sence. 'Deed I most love them doors an' the rake an'\r\npoker. I've hed my frets about it sometimes, but I doan' want to go\r\nthough.'\r\n\r\n'And I say it's a shame in them to use you so!' cried the girl. 'Making\r\ntheir money hand over hand, and to go and grudge you this ash hole, for\r\nthe sake of saving! They'll get no good from such reckoning. I wish\r\ntheir cruel old mill would burn down!'\r\n\r\n'No, Jane, hold hersel'! Here's fire--should _I_ do it?'\r\n\r\n'It's Cowles's work. I hate him.'\r\n\r\n'The mill's their own, Jane; they gev me what they liked; I've no claim.\r\nMr. Cowles do as he think best for t'mill.'\r\n\r\n'Then to do it just now! I hope _his_ dinner'll be sweet.'\r\n\r\n'I nawt meant my girl to knaw't till Christmas wor done. But ye'll nawt\r\nmind it, Jane, ye'll nawt! We'll nawt lose Christmas, too, for it come\r\nfor us. Mr. Cowles doan' own _thet_. We'll hev thet anyhow, an' keep it.\r\nShe'll nawt fret hersel', my little girl!'\r\n\r\nJane did not answer.\r\n\r\n'We'll get on somehoo, Lord knaws hoo. We never starved yet, an' you've\r\ngot a good place. It'll all be right, an' Christmas day to-morrow!'\r\n\r\n'I got a good place! Oh, father!'\r\n\r\n'Why, Jane, I thought so. Doan' they use her well?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, they do,' quickly answered the girl; 'I don't know why I spoke\r\nso. I'm a bit discontented, perhaps, but don't you fear for me, father;\r\nand we mustn't fret--anyway, till after to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'She's nawt content, is she?' said the stoker, settling his head into\r\nhis hands. 'I've hed my frets, too, alone here, thinkin' summut like I\r\nshould liked to knaw books, an' been defferent, but it's like I'd nawt\r\nbeen content. Lord knows. 'Deed I loves them doors an' the old place\r\nhere, but seems as if summut was sayin' there's better things; it's like\r\nthere is, but nawt for such as me. I doan' care for mysel', but I'd like\r\nto hev more to gev my little girl.'\r\n\r\n'You give me all you've got, father, and I ought to be satisfied. But\r\nI'm not--it's not your blame, father, but I know I'm not,' she said,\r\nwith sudden energy. 'I don't know what I want; it's something--it seems\r\nas if I was hungry.'\r\n\r\n'Nawt hungry, Jane! She's nawt starvin'!'\r\n\r\n'No, I don't want any more to eat, nor better clothes,' she said,\r\ngetting out the words painfully. 'It's something else; I can't tell what\r\nit is, unless I'm hungry.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I knaw I doan' understan' her,' said the man sadly. 'I doan' knaw\r\nmy little girl. Is it _him_ she's thinkin' of?'\r\n\r\nThe fire-glow on the girl's face hid any change that may have come\r\nthere, and she only drew a little farther away, without answering.\r\n\r\n'I've nawt seen many people, Jane, but sometimes I likes an' dislikes,\r\nas Nobby does, an' I doan' like _him_. An' I doan' like him to be nigh\r\nmy girl; there's naw truth in him. I wish she'd say she'll hev naw more\r\nspeech with him.'\r\n\r\n'No, no, father, don't ask me that. I don't care for him, but I can't\r\npromise not to speak to him--I do! I do! Oh, father!' sobbed the girl,\r\n'everything comes at once!'\r\n\r\nThe old man drew her head on his knee, and even his rough voice grew\r\nsofter, talking to his 'little girl.' He bent and kissed her.\r\n\r\n'I wish 'twere nawt so,' he said; 'but mebbe I'm wrong. Lord keep my\r\nlittle girl, an' we'll nawt fret, but be happy to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nAnother man came in with a big tread. It was the engineer, a hale, burly\r\nfellow, with a genuine, rollicking kindness. He tossed the boy into the\r\nair, pinched Jane's cheek, and gave his morning salutation in several\r\nlusty thumps on the stoker's back.\r\n\r\n'Rippin' day this'll be, Adam,' said he; 'say t'won't, an' I'll shake\r\nyour ribs loose. Just such a day's I like to breathe in; an' when I've\r\nset all night in my chair there, not sleepin' of course, but seein' that\r\neverlastin' old crosshead go in an' out, an' that wheel turnin' away\r\njust so fast an' no faster, I swear I do go to sleep with my eyes open;\r\nan' when it gets light such a day's this, I get up an' shake\r\nmyself--this fashion,' giving him an extra jerk. 'Keep up heart, Adam; I\r\nknow it, an' I don't know what Cowles is thinkin' of. I don't want to\r\ncrowd you out, an' you ought to be the last one to go. I'd quit 'em for\r\nit myself, afford it or not, only 'twon't do you no good.'\r\n\r\n'Merry Christmas, Mr. Grump!' cried Nobby, rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n'You've slept over, my young 'un,' laughed the engineer; 'you're one day\r\nahead. Of course the palty mill must run to-morrow. Mine don't, I\r\nwarrant. My machinery runs on a fat turkey, twenty pound if he's an\r\nounce. That's me.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, and we've got a turkey too,' chimed Nobby.\r\n\r\n'I warrant you have. An' he had as good an appetite when he was alive as\r\nanybody else's turkey; them fellows do gobble their grub quite\r\nconscientiously, fattin' 'emselves without knowin' or carin' whether\r\nrich or poor'll eat 'em. _I'll_ bet yours's as fat an' good's Mr.\r\nPrescott's, or old Cowles's--damn him! No, I don't mean quite that, so\r\nnear Christmas, but he ought to be choked with his own dinner, I'll say\r\nthat. Keep up good heart, Adam; an' now clear out, every one! cut home\r\nto yer breakfasts! My watch now, and' I won't have one of ye\r\nround--scud! or wait a minute an' I'll pitch ye out.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAfter his breakfast, Adam walked back to the factory. He was wondering,\r\nas he went along, why they should begin with him if they wanted to save\r\nexpense. Eighteen dollars a month was a good deal to him, but what was\r\nit to the mill? Every turn of the water wheel, he thought, made more\r\nmoney than his day's wages. But possibly Mr. Prescott had found out that\r\nhis son fancied Jane, and meant to drive them out of town. The very day\r\nthat Mr. Prescott saw him first, Mr. Cowles, the manager, told him he\r\nwasn't needed any longer, that the under engineer would see to the\r\nfires. That was punishing him for another's fault--just the way with\r\nrich men; and for a while he almost hated Mr. Prescott.\r\n\r\nAdam Craig had had a peculiar life, as he thought. He wanted education,\r\nmoney, and such other things, besides something to eat and wear; but\r\nthey never came to him, and he drifted into a place at the machine\r\nshops, and got the stamp put on him, and then went his round year after\r\nyear with less and less thought of stepping out of it. Yet he always\r\nbelieved he once had some uncommon stuff in him, and he claimed his own\r\nrespect for having had it, even if he had lost it now; he had his own\r\nway of proving it too. His wife was the mirror by which he judged\r\nhimself. She was a German woman, whom he found in the city hospital; or\r\nrather she found him, shot through the throat by the accidental\r\ndischarge of a rifle. She was just from the fatherland, and could not\r\nspeak a word of English; with his swollen head he could not speak at\r\nall; but she watched him through it, and by the signs of that language\r\nwhich is common to all nations, they managed to understand each other,\r\nand signalized the day of his recovery by marrying. This was the pride\r\nof Adam's whole life, and convinced him he was made capable of being\r\nsomebody; he held his wife to be a superior woman, and her appreciation\r\nwas a consolation that never left him. 'She knawed me,' he used to say,\r\n'she saw into me better nor I did.' And though he would talk stoutly\r\nsometimes for democracy, he had an odd notion that marrying a\r\nContinental European gave him some sort of distinction; and all his\r\ntroubled talks with himself ended in his saying: 'Ah, well, if I'd been\r\nborn in Germany, I might been somebody.'\r\n\r\nAdam watched for Mr. Cowles most of the forenoon, determined to ask\r\nabout his dismissal; at last the manager strolled through the shops, and\r\nAdam made a desperate effort, and went to him. He turned short about, as\r\nthe stoker spoke.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Cowles, was ye told to send me away?'\r\n\r\n'Told! Who should tell me?'\r\n\r\n'But I thought--I thought Mr. Prescott might said summut--'\r\n\r\n'Do you suppose he concerns himself about you? I'm master here, and I\r\ndon't ask what I shall do.'\r\n\r\nAdam took hope: 'Hev ye said sure I must go, Mr. Cowles? I've been here\r\nso long, an' noo I'm old. I've got gray at t'mill,' touching his head as\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n'You've had your wages regular, haven't you?' said Cowles, roughly. 'I\r\ndon't inquire how long you've been here. Would I keep an old lathe that\r\nwas worn or that I had no use for, because I'd had it a good while? Stay\r\nround to-day, if you like, and then go.'\r\n\r\n'But eighteen dollars is nawt much to t'mill,' said Adam, humbly; 'doan'\r\nbe hard, an' gev me a chance, a chance to help mysel'! T'winter's hard,\r\nan' I've a family!'\r\n\r\n'Did I make your family? You should have thought of that long ago. Stand\r\nout of the way, if you're done.'\r\n\r\nThe stoker clung to the doorpost.\r\n\r\n'Summut else I could do--there must be summut--ye knaw summut else, Mr.\r\nCowles?'\r\n\r\n'Something else to do, you fool! What could you do--run the engine? tend\r\nthe planers? If I wanted you at all, I should keep you where you were.'\r\n\r\nHe moved off at this. Adam seated himself on the familiar cinder heaps\r\nand grieved in his simple way, for a time feeling almost bitter.\r\n\r\nLittle Nobby's deformity was one of the strange things that made Adam\r\nthink. Several years before, he had the child with him at the factory\r\none night, just old enough to walk a little. In Adam's momentary absence\r\nthe boy managed to get upon a box near one of the furnace doors, and,\r\nrolling against the blistering iron, was horribly burned; yet\r\nunaccountably he did not die, but grew bent into a scarred, shapeless\r\nbody, though his face was a sweet, childish one, innocent of fire.\r\nNobby, as Adam called him after that, was a silent preacher to the\r\nstoker. When a clergyman asked him once if he was a Christian, he\r\npointed to Nobby's back:\r\n\r\n'I knaw there's a Lord,' he said,' or else Nobby'd died, burnt so sore\r\nthet way; an' I knaw He's good, or Nobby'd been a fool a'terward, like\r\nchildren thet burn theirsel's. Saved Nobby from dyin' an' from bein'\r\nworse nor dead, both, Lord meant him good.'\r\n\r\nThe boy was Adam Craig's grandson. His firstborn, Tom, was wild, and\r\nwent to sea--the old story--leaving wife and unborn child for his father\r\nto look to. Six years had gone--the seventh began at New Year's; the boy\r\nwas born, burnt, saved alive, and not idiotic; its mother had died;\r\nAdam's life was outrunning the child's, and he would soon have to leave\r\nit to go on by itself; but his faith in his son's return never shook.\r\n\r\n'Him'll come back,' he would say, simply, and in perfect confidence, 'I\r\nknaw't well. Lord never burnt Nobby for nawt. Him's nawt dead; him'll\r\ncome back some time, I knaw.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAdam went back at noon, and found something else to take his thoughts:\r\nNobby was in his pains--a sad remnant of his terrible mishap. These were\r\nirregular, and he had been free for several months, but he had been\r\nexposed to the cold to-day. There was little to be done. At such times\r\nAdam could only cry over him, hold him in his arms while he was twisting\r\nhis crooked body so that it would hardly stay in or upon anything, and\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n'Poor, poor Nobby. Him'll nawt die, Katry; but how can he live? Lord\r\nsend back Tom!'\r\n\r\nJane was busy somewhere, and did not come home till evening. Her father\r\nhad been turned out of his place; Nobby was in his pains again, after\r\nthey had been hoping he wouldn't have any more; and to-morrow was\r\nChristmas! As she said, everything came at once. Things seemed to swim\r\nbefore her eyes--Nobby's pain was the most real of all--and as she could\r\nnot help him, she wanted to get out of sight. It was all true. Aching\r\nand longing intolerably for something more than she had known, she had\r\nmet Will Prescott--and he had loved her--he said so; and he had promised\r\nher books and pictures, and chances for travel and study.\r\n\r\nShe went into the best room, already trimmed for to-morrow; the\r\nChristmas tree was clustered with gifts and with candles ready for\r\nlighting, and the motto was on the top, '_Gott zur hülfe_.' Jane looked\r\nit all over, and her lip quivered.\r\n\r\n'This is pure and honest, as it says,' said she; 'and _I'm_ a lie\r\nmyself, cheating father. Christmas to-morrow! 'twon't last long; if\r\n_he_ only knew I go to--I won't say the word--would he ever care about\r\nme again?'\r\n\r\nShe went into the other room for her shawl.\r\n\r\n'Hes my little girl got to go out to-night?' said Adam. 'Well, there's\r\nto-morrow. Doan' stay late, Net,' kissing her good-by.\r\n\r\nShe pulled the hood over her face and went out, taking the road to the\r\ncity, never slackening her pace till the lights along the way grew\r\nthicker, and she came upon the pavements. Crossing the great\r\nthoroughfare, she turned into a narrow street, and from that descended a\r\nshort flight of steps into a narrower one lit only by a great lamp in\r\nfront of a door, with the word '_Tanzhaus_' above it; she went in here\r\nunhesitatingly. A large room with a bar on one side, small tables in the\r\nmiddle, and a stage at the farther end; some tables had occupants,\r\ndrinking and looking at several women dancing on the stage. This was\r\nJane's 'place;' the dance house wanted her face at its tables, and as\r\nthere was nothing else open, in very desperation she went. She turned\r\ninto a smaller room where the private tables were, to which she\r\nbelonged; at first they had tried to teach her to dance, but she would\r\nnot learn. The furniture was worn, with a slimy polish in spots; an\r\nunclean, stifling smell in the air; a few coarse prints of racers and\r\nchampions hung around; and in one place a drunken artist had sketched\r\none night a Crucifixion on the wall; the owner was angry enough, but\r\nsomething held back his hand from touching it, and it staid there,\r\ncovered by an old newspaper.\r\n\r\nAs Jane laid away her shawl and hood, a woman came forward to meet her.\r\n\r\n'What are you here for?' she said, fiercely; 'this is Christmas eve!\r\nthere's none for me--I wish I could cry, but my tears are dried up,'\r\nsnatching her tawdry cap from her head and stamping on it; 'but you're\r\nnot a devil yet. Go home, if you've got a home! out the back\r\nway--quick!'\r\n\r\nThe woman caught her shoulder, pulled away the paper, and pointed to the\r\npicture on the wall.\r\n\r\n'Look at _that_! When I see that, I think sometimes I'm in hell! What\r\nhas that got to do with me? Do you want to get out of the reach of that?\r\nGo home, go home,' shaking her furiously.\r\n\r\n'I can't! I can't!' cried Jane, desperately. 'He won't let me. 'Twas\r\nhere or the street, I thought; I've been here three weeks, and\r\nto-night's no more'n other nights.'\r\n\r\nA voice called in the front room, and the woman put on her cap and ran\r\nin; Jane stood where she left her. She hardly knew what moved her\r\nto-night; she saw her own body walking about, tense and foreign, as\r\nthough some possession had it; she had felt a new, strange kind of\r\nstrength all day, after she had her cry out. She looked up at the\r\npicture again, saying slowly to herself:\r\n\r\n'It's for _them_--I've got father, and mother, and sister, and\r\nbrethren.'\r\n\r\nNine o'clock struck, and people began to come in; there was likely to be\r\na rush to-night, and the players in the front room commenced their\r\nliveliest round of operatic airs. One after another turned into the side\r\nroom, and the calls for service grew lively. Jane moved among them\r\nmechanically, thinking all the while of Nobby tossing in his pain; of\r\nthe tree waiting for to-morrow; of her father turned out of his place;\r\nof the rent and the grocer's bill that were about due; and of her own\r\nwages, pretty much all that was left. Was it such a terrible sin to be\r\nthere--for _them_? Then she shivered to think she might be sliding down.\r\nNo, no, she would be kept--they should be taken care of, but she\r\nwouldn't fall while she had them to think of. A hot flush colored her\r\nface as she thought of young Prescott, confusing her so that she almost\r\nstumbled. What would _he_ think if he knew where she worked? No matter,\r\nhe shouldn't know it. He would take her out of this by and by, and after\r\nthat she would tell him all about it, and what she did it for, and he\r\nwould love her all the better for it.\r\n\r\nThe hours struck and went by, and the room grew hotter and noisier. Once\r\nthe tables were emptied; but a fresh party came in, and their leader\r\nwaved them to seats with maudlin politeness. He was a handsome young\r\nman, partly drunk already; he pushed the woman he had with him into a\r\nchair, and dropped into another himself. His back was toward Jane; she\r\nstood still a minute, then walked slowly, as if something dragged her,\r\ntill she could see his face.\r\n\r\nThe glass she held fell from her hand with a crash, but she stood dumb\r\nand white, and clung trembling to the table. He started, but gave her a\r\nnod.\r\n\r\n'_You_, Will Prescott! Oh, my God!'\r\n\r\n'You here, Jane! And you're one of 'em too! I didn't think it quite so\r\nsoon.'\r\n\r\nShe did not seem to hear the last words. The blood surged back to her\r\nface, and she sank at his feet.\r\n\r\n'No, no,' she moaned, 'I'm not, I'm not--I'm only here. You won't think\r\nworse of me, Will, seeing I did it for _them_? I must work somewhere,\r\nand this was all I could find. Say you don't think _that_! Say you\r\nbelieve me!'\r\n\r\nHe smiled in a drunken way, without speaking.\r\n\r\n'Say it, Will! Say you love me, and take me out of this!'\r\n\r\n'Ho, ho! that's a devilish good one! You're here, and so'm I; I'm just a\r\nlittle merry to-night--couldn't wait till to-morrow. We're well met,\r\nJane--these are my friends; here's my most par-ticular friend,' laying\r\nhis hand on his companion's shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed to be stunned so that she did not understand.\r\n\r\n'See it, hey? 'Say you love me!' You do it beautifully, Jane--do some\r\nmore. Did you ever think I loved you?--Oh, yes! and that I wanted to\r\nmarry you--of course! If your face hadn't looked prettier'n it does now,\r\ndamn me if I'd ever looked twice at it!'\r\n\r\nHe turned his chair a little.\r\n\r\n'What's that!' he screamed, catching sight of the painting on the wall.\r\n'Take it away! You put it there, you wretch!' staring at it with his\r\neyes fixed.\r\n\r\nThe noise brought the owner to the door--a burly Dutchman.\r\n\r\n'Landlord, put that thing away--cover it up! Damnation! Do I want to\r\ncome here to be preached at?'\r\n\r\n'Who pulled that paper off, I say?' said the man. 'I pinned _The\r\nClipper_ over it. You did it, I swar! Be off with yer!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, let her stay, Lumpsey,' said a woman that came in from the bar;\r\n'she'll be one on 'em when she gits round.'\r\n\r\n'I won't; I won't have nobody here that's better'n we be no longer.\r\nHere's yer pay; an' now, missis, start yerself, an' don't yer come nigh\r\nhere agen 'thout yer'll behave decent an' be one on us.'\r\n\r\nHe tossed some bank notes toward her, took her by the shoulders, and\r\nshoved her out, shutting the door upon her.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nEverybody had gone out on Christmas eve--darting about in sleighs; at\r\nservice in the churches; at a party given in their set; shopping, as if\r\ntheir lives depended on it. Buying, selling, visiting, looking, the city\r\nwas all astir. In the churches, soberly gay with evergreen trimming,\r\nlike a young widow very stylish in black, but very proper withal, people\r\nwere listening to the anthems, and everything about the place was wide\r\nawake, unless it was the chimes taking a nap until twelve o'clock;\r\ndrygoods men ran to and fro, dropping smiles, and winding themselves up\r\nin a great medley reel of silks, laces, and things of _virtu_ in\r\ngeneral; next door, the booksellers were resplendent in dazzling\r\nbindings, pictures and photographs of everything and everybody, all of\r\nwhich were at everybody's disposal--take 'em all home, if you pleased;\r\nlivery stables were as bare as if there had been an invasion of the\r\ncountry that day, and smiling keepers touched their pockets, and shook\r\ntheir heads pityingly at late comers; and even in the markets jolly\r\nbutchers laughed, and sawed, and cut, and counted their money--and those\r\nleathery fellows that were never jolly, suddenly found out a new\r\ncommercial maxim, that jollity is the best policy, and they fell to\r\nlaughing too. 'Christmas is coming!' thought everybody. 'Christmas is\r\ncoming!' and some of the lively small bells in the towers, not grown yet\r\nto years of ripe discretion, whispered to each other, and had to bite\r\ntheir tongues to keep from shouting it right out.\r\n\r\nThe dance house and the narrow alley left behind, Jane was in the street\r\ntoo; she went with the crowd, pulling her hood so as to hide her face.\r\nShe glanced at the costly goods that lay in confusion on the counters of\r\nthe stores, and smiled bitterly, taking hold of her own cheap dress; the\r\nsleighs almost ran over her, they shot back and forth so wildly, to her\r\nwhirling brain; a German air that a band was playing on a serenade\r\nsomewhere in the distance seemed to roar in her ears like thunder. She\r\nstopped before a confectioner's. The hot smell of meats came up through\r\nthe grating where she stood; the window was ablaze with gas, piled high\r\nwith pyramids of glittering frost, which rose out of a heaped profusion\r\nof carved lobster and turkey, and fruits and candies; she saw girls with\r\npretty faces and nice dresses waiting on the fashionable crowd inside,\r\nand said to herself that she ought to be there. Some one touched her. It\r\nwas a girl younger than herself, who stood glaring at the window,\r\nshivering in her ragged clothing; her eyes looked unnaturally large out\r\nof her sharp, pinched face, daubed with tears and dirt.\r\n\r\n'Look a' thar!' she cried eagerly, catching Jane's arm, 'see _them_! Why\r\nben't them mine? Why ben't I in thar, a buyin' o' them? I ort to ride,\r\nortn't I? Why ben't I got nice things on, like a' them thar? Pinchin'\r\nDave's got my dress for three shillin' to-night--the last un I been a\r\nsavin'; must ha' some drink, so't I'd be forgettin'--to-night, to-night,\r\nye see, I say--hoh!'\r\n\r\nGiving a wild laugh, the girl ran off. A man inside was looking angrily\r\nthrough the window; so Jane turned from the thoroughfare, and finally\r\nstruck into the road by which she came. The street lamps had given way\r\nto the moon. The flats adjoining the city were all white except marshy\r\nspots; passing two tall buildings, that made a sort of gateway, the\r\ncountry spread to the sky unbroken, except where rows of dreary houses,\r\nshadowy without the twinkle of a light, stood on some new land; this was\r\nnot the fashionable road, and it was empty. How pure and cool it was! In\r\nthe city, there was straggling moonlight, darkened by the brick walls,\r\nbut no moon; out here, the moon had just broken from a bank of cloud low\r\ndown, piled on a bank of snow, all looking snowy and alike, the horizon\r\nline being hardly distinguishable; the light poured from the edge in a\r\nshining flood, and rippled without a sound over the crisp, crusted\r\nsnow--all of one kin, cold, sparkling, desolate.\r\n\r\nJane noted nothing of this; she walked dizzily along the road. Only one\r\nday since morning, after living a whole lifetime in that! She scooped up\r\na handful of snow, and rubbed it furiously into her face and eyes, they\r\nburned so; her eyes were dry, melting the snow without feeling wet any.\r\nClear back in the morning, Margery Eames met her; then the day dragged\r\nalong as if it never would go, and she ate nothing but the tears she\r\nswallowed; going down those steps, through that dreadful door, waiting\r\non those tables--the evening, till Will Prescott came in. She had wanted\r\nso to have what others had, to study, to paint--such things as she had\r\nseen, and she couldn't make a stroke! to learn to sing, as she had heard\r\nthem sing in the churches; to see Germany, that her mother had told her\r\nabout; she wanted to be loved--not like father and Nobby, but another\r\nway too; she had a right to have such things--other people had them.\r\n_He_ had praised her, stroked her hair; said she was too pale, but no\r\nmatter, she'd brighten up by and by; she was his little bluebell he had\r\nfound in the woods, that he was going to make over into a red rose; she\r\nshould have everything she wanted, and go with him everywhere, pretty\r\nsoon--only be patient; if he could wait, couldn't she? And she had been\r\npatient, without telling father about it, though somehow he found out;\r\nshe had waited in the road an hour more than once for a kind word and a\r\nsmile as he rode by; she had borne with her hard fare, and waited for\r\nhim to do the things he promised; and after she had to go into the dance\r\nhouse, she hated it most for his sake--she hated him to kiss her, for\r\nfear he'd find some taint on her lips of the place she went to; she\r\nthought of him all the while, to keep up courage; of course it was for\r\nfather and Nobby she did it, but he helped her. It was all over now.\r\n\r\nShe came to the bridge over the river, and stopped on it. Just then she\r\nhappened to think of a choral her mother liked to sing: 'A mighty\r\nfortress is our God.' A fortress--not hers. Did He sometimes turn\r\nagainst people and crowd them--who crowded the girl at the\r\nconfectioner's window? Was there any God at all? Not in the city; only\r\ntwo sorts of people were there, who either lived in fine houses, and had\r\nno souls at all, or else went about the streets, and had lost them. Was\r\nthere any God out here? If there was, He wouldn't have let Mr. Cowles\r\nturn her father off, and she wouldn't be out in the cold; there wasn't\r\nany anywhere.\r\n\r\nJane looked down at the water. It was muddy, but it gave a wavering\r\nreflection as the wind ruffled it; now and then a piece of driftwood\r\nglided from under the bridge, and was borne along toward the factory\r\ndam. Her mind flashed round to the factory, and home, and the Christmas\r\ntree for to-morrow, and she laughed bitterly. Jump! She had lost _him_,\r\nall that had been keeping her up so long--he never meant to marry her,\r\nthough he said so, and she believed him. Everything went with that love;\r\nwhat was there left? What matter what came now? Jump! But father and\r\nNobby? She couldn't leave them unprovided for. Money, money! she must\r\nhave money, for _them_.\r\n\r\nThe bells began to chime very softly, as they always did at twelve\r\no'clock of this night in the year. They seemed to say: 'Come! come!\r\ncome!' She caught at the sound. There was money in the city, and one way\r\nyet to earn it.\r\n\r\n'They're calling me!' she cried, clutching her dress wildly with both\r\nhands; 'they're pushing me into hell--why shouldn't I go? _They'll_ have\r\nmoney, and I'm gone already.'\r\n\r\nShe turned, and walked back without faltering, to the edge of the city,\r\nand stopped between the two buildings. There was an alley close by, like\r\none she knew so well; by the noise there was revel in it. She hesitated\r\na minute, crouching out of sight in the shadow of the buildings.\r\n\r\n'Don't stop here!' she muttered to herself; 'now as well as any other\r\ntime!' and turned into the alley. The light was streaming from a door\r\nnear the middle, and a man in sailor's dress came out and caught a\r\nglimpse of her creeping along close to the wall.\r\n\r\n'Hey, lass!' he said, 'merry Christmas to ye! 'Rived in port to-day.\r\nBeen a cruisin'. Locker full, an' all hands piped ashore. What craft be\r\nyou--a Dutch galley? Sail down a bit, till I get within speakin'\r\ndistance.'\r\n\r\nShe only staggered closer against the wall.\r\n\r\n'Beatin' off, hey? Well, lass, come an' drink to better acquaintance.'\r\n\r\n'It's the first time, but I'll go--I'll go with you,' she answered. She\r\nfollowed him to the door. The gas flared full on his face, and she gave\r\na mortal scream.\r\n\r\n'Brother Tom!'\r\n\r\nHe made a headlong clutch at her, but she broke away, leaving a fragment\r\nof her dress in his hand, and flew round the corner out of his sight.\r\n\r\nShe ran blindly through several streets, but finally she regained the\r\nroad, and never stopped her headlong speed till she leaned against the\r\ndoor of Adam Craig's cottage. She pushed the door open softly, and went\r\nin. Quick as she had been, her brother was there already, standing by\r\nNobby's bed; Adam Craig was there, but his back was turned.\r\n\r\n'Did you--tell him?' she whispered.\r\n\r\nHer brother nodded, and put out his hand. She took it, with a half\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n'He understands,' he whispered, answering the question of her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe old stoker turned around. She made a move to shrink away, but he\r\ncaught her, and drew her to his breast, crying and sobbing:\r\n\r\n'Lord, Lord, Lord's good!' he cried, 'thank Him for't! She's saved, my\r\nlittle girl! I've found more'n I've lost, to-day. Oh, she's pure yet,\r\nshe's saved--she's nawt lost, my girl, she's nawt! I didn't knaw't!\r\ndidn't knaw what she was doin', but it's all right noo! We'll never want\r\nany more, but if Net'd been lost--but she's nawt, nawt--she's nawt gone,\r\nshe's here, an' harm never'll come nigh her any more! I knowed Tom'd\r\ncome back, an' now Net! they both hev saved each other, Lord's good\r\nfor't!'\r\n\r\n'But Nobby?' she whispered.\r\n\r\n'Lord brought us one, an' noo He's goin' to take back t'other,' said\r\nAdam.\r\n\r\nThe child was twisting in his father's arms in the height of his pain.\r\n\r\n'I knaw noo why 'twas I went away thet mornin', an' Nobby got t'bump,'\r\nsaid Adam, looking on sadly.\r\n\r\nThe young sailor made no answer. The partial drunkenness of his first\r\nnight on shore was gone, and he only held his suffering child, wiping\r\nthe drops from its face. So they stood watching, and the hours went on.\r\n\r\n'Zuhöret!' cried Adam's wife. 'Die Weihnachtsglocken!'\r\n\r\nIt was the bells, ringing out the full morning carol. The child was\r\nlying on his bed; he brightened up a little, then shut his eyes wearily,\r\nand stopped writhing. For little Nobby it that moment became true that\r\n\r\n  'Christ was born on Christmas day.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISM.--NO. VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sufficient reason why the common developments of intellect are so\r\npoor, is not so much in the want of native capacity, as in the low moral\r\nestate of our nature. Our hearts are so dry, our better affections so\r\ndull, that we are not the subjects of stimulus adequate to the calling\r\nforth of efforts suitable to the necessities of the case. Here and\r\nthere, one is so richly endowed in mind, that his love of science or art\r\nmay suffice to tax his powers to the full: but a world could never be\r\nconstituted of such geniuses. The mass of men, if ever to be led up to\r\nany high plane of mental life, must be so under the promptings of\r\naffections and passions which find their excitement in the more\r\npractical spheres of our existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES FENIMORE COOPER ON SECESSION AND STATE RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier numbers of _The Spirit of the Fair_, the newspaper\r\npublished by a committee of gentlemen for the benefit of the New York\r\nMetropolitan Fair, appeared a series of very remarkable papers from the\r\npen of James Fenimore Cooper, the American novelist.[7] The history of\r\nthese papers is very curious, as announced by the editors of _The Spirit\r\nof the Fair_, in their introductory, as follows:\r\n\r\n     'UNPUBLISHED MSS. OF JAMES FENIMORE COOPER.\r\n\r\n     'Our national novelist died in the autumn of 1850; previous to his\r\n     fatal illness he was engaged upon a historical work, to be entitled\r\n     'The Men of Manhattan,' only the Introduction to which had been\r\n     sent to the press. The printing office was destroyed by fire, and\r\n     with it the opening chapters of this work; fortunately a few pages\r\n     had been set up, and the impression sent to a literary gentleman,\r\n     then editor of a popular critical journal, and were thus saved from\r\n     destruction. To him we are indebted for the posthumous articles of\r\n     Cooper, wherewith, by a coincidence as remarkable as it is\r\n     auspicious, we now enrich our columns with a contribution from the\r\n     American pioneer in letters.'\r\n\r\nMany readers at the time passed over these papers without the careful\r\nattention which they deserved. Others, who perused them more thoroughly,\r\nwere struck with the remarkable prescience which the great writer's\r\nthoughts exhibited on topics which the events now passing before us lend\r\na tremendous interest. Cooper, it must be remembered, uttered his views\r\non 'Secession,' 'State Rights,' etc., upward of _fifteen years ago_, and\r\nat a period when the horrors of rebellion, as a consequence of slavery,\r\nwere little foreseen as likely to succeed those years of peace and\r\nprosperity. Had these opinions been published at the period intended by\r\ntheir writer, they would doubtless have been pronounced visionary and\r\nillogical. By a singular succession of events, however, the MS. has been\r\nhidden in the chrysalis of years, until, lo! it sees the light of day at\r\na period when the prophetic words of their author come up, as it were,\r\nfrom his grave, with the vindication of truth and historic fidelity.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who have not read these papers in the newspaper\r\nwhere they originally appeared, we make the following extracts, feeling\r\nassured that no man interested in passing events, or in the causes which\r\nled to them, can fail to recognize in these passages the astonishing\r\npower and comprehensiveness of the mind that fifteen years ago discussed\r\nthese vital topics. Let it be remembered, too, that their author was a\r\nman whose sympathies were largely with his countrymen, not less of the\r\nSouth than of the North, and that it was doubtless with a view of\r\nwarning his Southern friends of the danger which hovered over the\r\n'institution' of slavery, that they were written. Probably had they\r\nappeared in print at that time, they would have produced no effect where\r\nmostly effect was aimed at; but now that they have appeared, when the\r\nsmall cloud of evil pointed out has spread over the Southern land and\r\nbroken into a deluge of devastation, they will at least prove that the\r\nwords of warning were not perishable utterances signifying nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n'SECESSION.\r\n\r\n'The first popular error that we shall venture to assail, is that\r\nconnected with the prevalent notion of the sovereignty of the States. We\r\ndo not believe that the several States of this Union are, in any\r\nlegitimate meaning of the term, sovereign at all. We are fully aware\r\nthat this will be regarded as a bold, and possibly as a presuming\r\nproposition, but we shall endeavor to work it out with such means as we\r\nmay have at command.\r\n\r\n'We lay down the following premises as too indisputable to need any\r\narguments to sustain them: viz., the authority which formed the present\r\nConstitution of the United States had the legal power to do so. That\r\nauthority was in the Government of the States, respectively, and not in\r\ntheir people in the popular signification, but through their people in\r\nthe political meaning of the term, and what was then done must be\r\nregarded as acts connected with the composition and nature of\r\ngovernments, and of no minor or different interests of human affairs.\r\n\r\n'It being admitted, that the power which formed the Government was\r\nlegitimate, we obtain one of the purest compacts for the organization of\r\nhuman society that probably ever existed. The ancient allegiance, under\r\nwhich the colonies had grown up to importance, had been extinguished by\r\nsolemn treaty, and the States met in Convention sustained by all the law\r\nthey had, and backed in every instance by institutions that were more or\r\nless popular. The history of the world cannot, probably, furnish another\r\ninstance of the settlement of the fundamental contract of a great nation\r\nunder circumstances of so much obvious justice. This gives unusual\r\nsolemnity and authority to the Constitution of 1787, and invests it with\r\nadditional claims to our admiration and respect.\r\n\r\n'The authority which formed the Constitution admitted, we come next to\r\nthe examination of its acts. It is apparent from the debates and\r\nproceedings of the Convention, that two opinions existed in that body;\r\nthe one leaning strongly toward the concentration of power in the hands\r\nof the Federal Government, and the other desirous of leaving as much as\r\npossible with the respective States. The principle that the powers which\r\nare not directly conceded to the Union should remain in first hands,\r\nwould seem never to have been denied; and some years after the\r\norganization of the Government, it was solemnly recognized in an\r\namendment. We are not disposed, however, to look for arguments in the\r\ndebates and discussions of the Convention, in our view often a deceptive\r\nand dangerous method of construing a law, since the vote is very\r\nfrequently given on even conflicting reasons. Different minds arrive at\r\nthe same results by different processes; and it is no unusual thing for\r\nmen to deny each other's premises, while they accept their conclusions.\r\nWe shall look, therefore, solely to the compact itself, as the most\r\ncertain mode of ascertaining what was done.\r\n\r\n'No one will deny that all the great powers of sovereignty are directly\r\nconceded to the Union. The right to make war and peace, to coin money,\r\nmaintain armies and navies, etc., etc., in themselves overshadow most of\r\nthe sovereignty of the States. The amendatory clause would seem to\r\nannihilate it. By the provisions of that clause three fourths of the\r\nStates can take away all the powers and rights now resting in the hands\r\nof the respective States, with a single exception. This exception gives\r\nbreadth and emphasis to the efficiency of the clause. It will be\r\nremembered that all this can be done within the present Constitution.\r\nIt is a part of the original bargain. Thus, New York can legally be\r\ndeprived of the authority to punish for theft, to lay out highways, to\r\nincorporate banks, and all the ordinary interests over which she at\r\npresent exercises control, every human being within her limits\r\ndissenting. Now as sovereignty means power in the last resort, this\r\namendatory clause most clearly deprives the State of all sovereign power\r\nthus put at the disposition of Conventions of the several States; in\r\nfact, the votes of these Conventions, or that of the respective\r\nLegislatures acting in the same capacity, is nothing but the highest\r\nspecies of legislation known to the country; and no other mode of\r\naltering the institutions would be legal. It follows unavoidably, we\r\nrepeat, that the sovereignty which remains in the several States must be\r\nlooked for solely in the exception. What, then, is this exception?\r\n\r\n'It is a provision which says, that no State may be deprived of its\r\nequal representation in the Senate, without its own consent. It might\r\nwell be questioned whether this provision of the Constitution renders a\r\nSenate indispensable to the Government. But we are willing to concede\r\nthis point and admit that it does. Can the vote of a single State, which\r\nis one of a body of thirty, and which is bound to submit to the decision\r\nof a legal majority, be deemed a sovereign vote? Assuming that the whole\r\npower of the Government of the United States were in the Senate, would\r\nany one State be sovereign in such a condition of things? We think not.\r\nBut the Senate does not constitute by any means the whole or the half of\r\nthe authority of this Government; its legislative power is divided with\r\na popular body, without the concurrence of which it can do nothing; this\r\ndilutes the sovereignty to a degree that renders it very imperceptible,\r\nif not very absurd. Nor is this all. After a law is passed by the\r\nconcurrence of the two houses of Congress, it is sent to a perfectly\r\nindependent tribunal to decide whether it is in conformity with the\r\nprinciples of the great national compact; thus demonstrating, as we\r\nassume, that the sovereignty of this whole country rests, not in its\r\npeople, not in its States, but in the Government of the Union.\r\n\r\n'Sovereignty, and that of the most absolute character, is indispensable\r\nto the right of secession: nay, sovereignty, in the ordinary acceptation\r\nof the meaning of the term, might exist in a State without this right of\r\nsecession. We doubt if it would be held sound doctrine to maintain that\r\nany single State had a right to secede from the German Confederation,\r\nfor instance; and many alliances, or mere treaties, are held to be\r\nsacred and indissoluble; they are only broken by an appeal to violence.\r\n\r\n'Every human contract may be said to possess its distinctive character.\r\nThus, marriage is to be distinguished from a partnership in trade,\r\nwithout recurrence to any particular form of words. Marriage, contracted\r\nby any ceremony whatever, is held to be a contract for life. The same is\r\ntrue of Governments: in their nature they are intended to be\r\nindissoluble. We doubt if there be an instance on record of a Government\r\nthat ever existed, under conditions, expressed or implied, that the\r\nparts of its territory might separate at will. There are so many\r\ncontrolling and obvious reasons why such a privilege should not remain\r\nin the hands of sections or districts, that it is unnecessary to advert\r\nto them. But after a country has rounded its territory, constructed its\r\nlines of defence, established its system of custom houses, and made all\r\nthe other provisions for security, convenience, and concentration, that\r\nare necessary to the affairs of a great nation, it would seem to be very\r\npresumptuous to impute to any particular district the right to destroy\r\nor mutilate a system regulated with so much care.\r\n\r\n'The only manner in which the right of secession could exist in one of\r\nthe American States, would be by an express reservation to that effect\r\nin the Constitution, There is no such clause; did it exist it would\r\nchange the whole character of the Government, rendering it a mere\r\nalliance, instead of being that which it now is--a lasting Union. But,\r\nwhatever may be the legal principles connected with this serious\r\nsubject, there always exists, in large bodies of men, a power to change\r\ntheir institutions by means of the strong hand. This is termed the right\r\nof revolution, and it has often been appealed to to redress grievances\r\nthat could be removed by no other agency. It is undeniable that the\r\ninstitution of domestic slavery, as it now exists in what are termed the\r\nSouthern and Southwestern States of this country, creates an interest of\r\nthe most delicate and sensitive character. Nearly one half of the entire\r\nproperty of the slaveholding States consists in this right to the\r\nservices of human beings of a race so different from our own as to\r\nrender any amalgamation to the last degree improbable, if not\r\nimpossible. Any one may easily estimate the deep interest that the\r\nmasters feel in the preservation of their property. The spirit of the\r\nage is decidedly against them, and of this they must be sensible; it\r\ndoubly augments their anxiety for the future. The natural increase,\r\nmoreover, of these human chattels renders an outlet indispensable, or\r\nthey will soon cease to be profitable by the excess of their numbers. To\r\nthese facts we owe the figments which have rendered the Southern school\r\nof logicians a little presuming, perhaps, and certainly very\r\nsophistical. Among other theories we find the bold one, that the\r\nTerritories of the United States are the property, not of the several\r\nStates, but of their individual people; in other words, that the native\r\nof New York or Rhode Island, regardless of the laws of the country, has\r\na right to remove to any one of these Territories, carry with him just\r\nsuch property as he may see fit, and make such use of it as he may find\r\nconvenient. This is a novel copartnership in jurisdiction, to say the\r\nleast, and really does not seem worthy of a serious reply.'\r\n\r\n\r\n'SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n'The American Union has much more adhesiveness than is commonly\r\nimagined. The diversity and complexity of its interests form a network\r\nthat will be found, like the web of the spider, to possess a power of\r\nresistance far exceeding its gossamer appearance--one strong enough to\r\nhold all that it was ever intended to enclose. The slave interest is now\r\nmaking its final effort for supremacy, and men are deceived by the\r\nthroes of a departing power. The institution of domestic slavery cannot\r\nlast. It is opposed to the spirit of the age; and the figments of Mr.\r\nCalhoun, in affirming that the Territories belong to the States, instead\r\nof the Government of the United States; and the celebrated doctrine of\r\nthe equilibrium, for which we look in vain into the Constitution for a\r\nsingle sound argument to sustain it, are merely the expiring efforts of\r\na reasoning that cannot resist the common sense of the nation. As it is\r\nhealthful to exhaust all such questions, let us turn aside a moment, to\r\ngive a passing glance at this very material subject.\r\n\r\n'At the time when the Constitution was adopted, three classes of persons\r\nwere 'held to service' in the country--apprentices, redemptioners, and\r\nslaves. The two first classes were by no means insignificant in 1789,\r\nand the redemptioners were rapidly increasing in numbers. In that day it\r\nlooked as if this speculative importation of laborers from Europe was to\r\nform a material part of the domestic policy of the Northern States. Now\r\nthe negro is a human being, as well as an apprentice or a redemptioner,\r\nthough the Constitution does not consider him as the equal of either.\r\nIt is a great mistake to suppose that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, as it now exists, recognizes slavery in any manner whatever,\r\nunless it be to mark it as an interest that has less than the common\r\nclaim to the ordinary rights of humanity. In the apportionment, or\r\nrepresentation clause, the redemptioner and the apprentice counts each\r\nas a man, whereas five slaves are enumerated as only three free men. The\r\nfree black is counted as a man, in all particulars, and is represented\r\nas such, but his fellow in slavery has only three fifths of his\r\npolitical value.'\r\n\r\n\r\n'THE LOVE OF UNION.\r\n\r\n'The attachment to the Union is very strong and general throughout the\r\nwhole of this vast country, and it is only necessary to sound the tocsin\r\nto bring to its maintenance a phalanx equal to uphold its standard\r\nagainst the assaults of any enemies. The impossibility of the\r\nNorthwestern States consenting that the mouth of the Mississippi should\r\nbe held by a foreign power, is in itself a guarantee of the long\r\nexistence of the present political ties. Then, the increasing and\r\novershadowing power of the nation is of a character so vast, so\r\nexciting, so attractive, so well adapted to carry with it popular\r\nimpulses, that men become proud of the name of American, and feel\r\nunwilling to throw away the distinction for any of the minor\r\nconsiderations of local policy. Every man sees and feels that a state is\r\nrapidly advancing to maturity which must reduce the pretensions of even\r\nancient Rome to supremacy, to a secondary place in the estimation of\r\nmankind. A century will unquestionably place the United States of\r\nAmerica prominently at the head of civilized nations, unless their\r\npeople throw away their advantages by their own mistakes--the only real\r\ndanger they have to apprehend: and the mind clings to this hope with a\r\nbuoyancy and fondness that are becoming profoundly national. We have a\r\nthousand weaknesses, and make many blunders, beyond a doubt, as a\r\npeople; but where shall we turn to find a parallel to our progress, our\r\nenergy, and increasing power? That which it has required centuries, in\r\nother regions, to effect, is here accomplished in a single life; and the\r\nstudent in history finds the results of all his studies crowded, as it\r\nmight be, into the incidents of the day.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The stereotype plates of _The Spirit of the Fair_, in which\r\nthe Cooper articles originally appeared, are owned by Mr. Trow.

VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'We shall never know much while we have so many books.'\r\n\r\nSuch was my thought, many years ago; and such does all my observation\r\nand experience still confirm. Knowledges we may have, even if we do read\r\nmuch: but not much knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut, some will ask, if one has true ideas, though derived from\r\nothers--is not that knowledge? Yes, if he has ideas: but propositions\r\nexpressing them are not enough: one may have many of these, and know but\r\nlittle. For example, let us suppose Locke right about the mind's coming\r\ninto existence as a sheet of white paper--a man may receive this, and\r\nyet not know it. See how easily this may be tested. White paper will\r\nreceive any impression you please: can the human mind receive the\r\nimpression that two and two are five, or that a part is equal to the\r\nwhole? Locke could have answered this, and seemed to save his theory.\r\nThe borrower from Locke cannot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESURRECTION FLOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a traveller in Egypt were to bow before the Sphynx, and receive a nod\r\nin return, he could scarcely be more surprised than I was to-day, upon\r\nseeing a little, dried-up thing--the remains of what had once bloomed\r\nand faded ''mid beleaguering sands'--spring into life and beauty before\r\nmy very eyes. All the Abbott Collection contains nothing more rare or\r\ncurious. Old, perhaps, as Cheops, and apparently as sound asleep, it is\r\nstartled at the touch of water, and, stretching forth its tiny petals,\r\nwakes into life as brightly as a new-born flower.\r\n\r\nNo one could believe, upon looking at this little ball, hanging on its\r\nfragile stem, and resembling both in color and shape a shrunken\r\npoppy-head, or some of the acorn tribe, what magical results could arise\r\nfrom merely wetting its surface--yet so it is.\r\n\r\nSleeping, but not dead, the flower is aroused by being for an instant\r\nimmersed in water, and then supported in an upright position. Soon the\r\nupper fibres begin to stir. Slowly, yet visibly, they unfold, until,\r\nwith petals thrown back in equidistant order, it assumes the appearance\r\nof a beautifully radiated, starry flower, not unlike some of the Asters\r\nin form. Resting a moment, it suddenly, as though inspired by some new\r\nimpulse, throws its very heart to the daylight, curving back its petals\r\nfarther still, and disclosing beauties undreamed of even in the\r\nloveliness of its first awakening.\r\n\r\nTo say that, in general effect, its appearance resembles the\r\npassion-flower is to give but a poor description, and yet one searches\r\nin vain for a more fitting comparison. Lacking entirely the strong\r\ncontrasts in color of the latter, it yet wears a halo of its own, unlike\r\nany other in the whole range of floral effects.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed through a powerful lens, the heart of the flower, which, to\r\nthe naked eye, lies flooded in a warm, colorless light, assumes the most\r\nexquisite iridescent hues, far more beautiful than the defined tints of\r\nthe passion-flower. Melting to the eye in its juiciness and delicacy,\r\nyet firm in its pure outline and rounded finish, it bears the same\r\nrelation to that chosen type of the great Suffering, that peace bears to\r\npassion, or that promise bears to prayer.\r\n\r\nSoon the aspect of the flower changes. As though over the well-spring of\r\nits eternal life hangs some ruthless power forcing it back into\r\ndarkness, before an hour has passed, we can see that its newly-found\r\nvigor is fading away. The pulsing light at its heart grows fainter and\r\nfainter--slowly the petals raise themselves, to drop wearily side by\r\nside upon its bosom--and finally, its beauty vanished, its strength\r\nexhausted, it hangs heavy and brown upon its stem, waiting for the touch\r\nthat alone can waken it again.\r\n\r\nThis rare botanical wonder, blooming one moment before admiring eyes,\r\nand next lying dried and shrivelled in a tomb-like box, is not without\r\nits legendary interest, though the odor of its oriental history has, by\r\nthis time, been nearly blown away by that sharp simoom of investigation,\r\nwhich has already whirled so many pretty fables and theories into\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nThe story of the flower, as given in 1856, by the late Dr. Deck, the\r\nnaturalist, is as follows:\r\n\r\nWhile travelling on a professional tour in Upper Egypt, eight years\r\nbefore, engaged in exploring for some lost emerald and copper mines, he\r\nchanced to render medical service to an Arab attached to his party. In\r\ngratitude, the child of the desert formally presented to him this\r\nnow-called 'Resurrection Flower,' at the same time enjoining upon him\r\nnever to part with it. Like the fabled gift of the Egyptian, it was\r\nsupposed to have 'magic in the web of it.' The doctor was solemnly\r\nassured by the Arab, and others of his race, that it had been taken ten\r\nyears before from the breast of an Egyptian mummy, a high priestess, and\r\nwas deemed a great rarity; that it would never decay if properly cared\r\nfor; that its possession through life would tend to revive hope in\r\nadversity, and, if buried with its owner, would ensure for him hereafter\r\nall the enjoyments of the Seventh Heaven of Mahomet. When presented,\r\nthis flower was one of two hanging upon the same stem. Dr. Deck\r\ncarefully preserved one; the twin specimen he presented to Baron\r\nHumboldt, who acknowledged it to be the greatest floral wonder he had\r\nyet seen, and the only one of its kind he had met with in the course of\r\nhis extensive travels.\r\n\r\nFor years the doctor carried his treasure with him everywhere, prizing\r\nit for its intrinsic qualities, and invariably awakening the deepest\r\ninterest whenever he chanced to display its wondrous powers. During the\r\nremainder of his life he caused the flower to open more than one\r\nthousand times, without producing any diminution of its extraordinary\r\nproperty, or any injury to it whatever. It is proper to state that,\r\nthough closely examined by some of the most eminent naturalists, both at\r\nhome and abroad, no positive position in the botanical kingdom was ever\r\nassigned to it--indeed to this day it remains a waif in the floral\r\nworld, none having determined under what classification it belongs.\r\n\r\nI need not say that the doctor, while gratefully accepting the gift of\r\nhis Arab friend, quietly rejected the accompanying superstitions.\r\nSubsequent trials and proofs positive confirmed his doubts of its\r\nhope-inspiring power, while his inclination and good old prejudices\r\ntempted him to forego the delights of the Seventh Heaven by bequeathing\r\nhis treasure to his friend and pupil, Dr. C. J. Eames, of New York, than\r\nwhom none could regard it with a truer appreciation, or recognize its\r\nexquisite perfection with a feeling nearer akin to veneration.\r\n\r\nIt has now been in the possession of Dr. Eames for several years, and\r\nhas, in the mean time, been unfolded many hundred times, still without\r\nany deterioration of its mysterious power. It opens as fairly and\r\nfreshly to-day, as when, under Egyptian skies, more than sixteen years\r\nago, its delicate fibres, heavy with the dust of ages, quivered into a\r\nnew life before the astonished eyes of Dr. Deck.\r\n\r\nWell-named as, in some respects, it seems to be, this marvel of the\r\nbotanical world has already given rise to not a few discussions among\r\nthe scientific and curious, some earnestly proclaiming its right to the\r\ntitle of 'Resurrection Flower,' and others denying that it is a flower\r\nat all. Indeed, in its unfolded state, its resemblance to a flattened\r\npoppy-head, and other seed vessels, offers strong argument in favor of\r\nthe latter opinion. In alluding to it, one uses the term 'flower' with\r\ndecided 'mental reservation'--beautiful flower, as it seems to be when\r\nopened--and speaks of its 'petals' with a deprecating glance at\r\nimaginary hosts of irate botanists. Some, it is true, still insist that\r\nit is a _bona fide_ flower; but Dr. Deck himself inclined to the belief\r\nthat it was the pericarp or seed vessel of some desert shrub, rare\r\nindeed, as few or none like it have appeared in centuries, yet not\r\nwithout its analogies in the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nThe famous Rose of Jericho (not that mentioned in the Apocrypha, or the\r\nvery common kind peculiar to the far East, but that long-lost variety\r\nprized by the Crusaders as a holy emblem of their zeal and pilgrimage)\r\nwas, in all probability, a member of the same genus to which the\r\n'Resurrection Flower' belongs. This opinion is supported by the fact\r\nthat resemblances of the 'flower,' both open and closed, are sculptured\r\nupon some of the tombs of the Crusaders--two, in the Temple Church of\r\nLondon, and several in the Cathedrals of Bayeux and Rouen in Normandy,\r\nwhere lie some of the most renowned followers of Peter the Hermit.\r\n\r\nA brother of Dr. Deck, engaged in antiquarian research in the island of\r\nMalta, discovered the same device graven upon the knights' tombs, and\r\ninvariably on that portion of the shield, the 'dexter chief,' which was\r\nconsidered the place of highest honor. This gentleman has also furnished\r\nthe following quotation from an old monkish manuscript, describing 'a\r\nwonder obtained from Jerusalem by the holy men, and called by them the\r\n'Star of Bethlehem,' as, if exposed to the moon on the eve of the\r\nEpiphany, it would become wondrous fair to view, and like unto the star\r\nof the Saviour; and with the first glory of the sun, it would return to\r\nits lowliness.'\r\n\r\nDoubtless the old chroniclers, had they lived in these days of evidence\r\nand 'solid fact,' would have given some credit to the heavy dews\r\npeculiar to moonlight nights, an exposure to which would assuredly have\r\nproduced all the effect of immersion upon the flower.\r\n\r\nThe fact of so close a representation of the 'Resurrection Flower' being\r\nupon the tombs of the Crusaders, added to the circumstance that in his\r\nEgyptian researches he had never met with any allusion to it, induced\r\nDr. Deck to discard the story of its Egyptian origin as untenable. 'I\r\nhave unwrapped many mummies myself,' he wrote, 'and have had\r\nopportunities of being present at unrolling of others of all classes,\r\nand have never discovered another Resurrection Flower, nor heard of any\r\none who had; and in the examination of hieroglyphics of every age and\r\nvariety, I never discovered anything bearing the remotest resemblance to\r\nit. Those who are conversant with the wonderful features of the Egyptian\r\nreligion and priestcraft, will observe how eagerly they seized upon and\r\ndeified anything symbolical of their mysterious tenets, and transmitted\r\nthem to posterity, figured as hieroglyphics; and it is but natural to\r\npresume that this homely-looking flower, with its halo, so typical of\r\nglory and resurrection, would have ranked high in their mythology, if\r\nit, and its properties, had been known to them. Moreover, an examination\r\nof the elaborate works of Josephus, Herodotus, King, and Diodorus, so\r\nfull in their description of Egyptian mythology, has failed to elicit\r\nany description or notice of it whatever.'\r\n\r\nNearly every one has read of the famous Rose of Jericho (_Anastatica\r\nhierochontina_) or Holy Rose--a low, gray-leaved annual, utterly unlike\r\na rose, growing abundantly in the arid wastes of Egypt, and also\r\nthroughout Palestine and Barbary, and along the sandy coasts of the Red\r\nSea. One of the most curious of the cruciferous plants, it exhibits, in\r\na rare degree, a hygrometric action in its process of reproduction.\r\nDuring the hot season it blooms freely, growing close to the ground,\r\nbearing its leaves and blossoms upon its upper surface; when these fall\r\noff, the stems become dry and ligneous, curving upward and inward until\r\nthe plant becomes a ball of twigs, containing its closed seed-vessels in\r\nthe centre, and held to the sand by a short fibreless root. In this\r\ncondition, it is readily freed by the winds, and blown across the\r\ndesert, until it reaches an oasis or the sea; when, yielding to the\r\n'_Open Sesame_' of water, it uncloses, leaving nature to use its\r\njealously guarded treasures at her will.\r\n\r\nThe dried plant, if carefully preserved, retains for a long time its\r\nhygrometric quality. When wet, it expands to its original form,\r\ndisplaying florets (?) not unlike those of the elder, but larger,\r\nclosing again as soon as the moisture evaporates. Hence it is\r\nreverenced in Syria as a holy emblem. The people call it _Kaf Maryam_,\r\nor Mary's Flower, and many superstitions are held regarding it, one of\r\nwhich is, that it first blossomed on the night on which our Saviour was\r\nborn. Growing everywhere, upon heaps of rubbish and roofs of old houses,\r\nby the wayside, and almost under the very door-stones, it creeps into\r\nthe surroundings of the people, weaving its chains of white, yellow, or\r\npurple flowers while sunshine lasts, and, when apparent decay overtakes\r\nit, teaching its beautiful lesson of Life in Death. Who can cavil at the\r\nthought which raises it to a symbol of that Eternal Love forever weaving\r\nendless chains from heart to heart, no spot too lowly for its tendrils\r\nto penetrate, or too dreary for its bloom.\r\n\r\nSome specimens of the Anastatica have been carried to this country by\r\ntravellers. One, in the cabinet of Fisher Howe, Esq., of Brooklyn, and\r\nbrought by him from Jericho fourteen years ago, still retains its\r\nremarkable habit; and another, older still, is in the possession of Dr.\r\nEames.\r\n\r\nAmong the plants which exhibit curious phases of hygrometric action\r\nmight be cited some of the Fig Marigolds (_Mesembryanthemum_); also the\r\nScaly Club Moss (_Lycopodium_). The latter, after being thoroughly\r\nwithered, will, if laid in water, gradually expand, turn green, and\r\nassume the appearance of a thriving plant. When again dried, it becomes\r\na brown, shrunken mass, capable, however, of being revived _ad libitum_.\r\n\r\nSome species of Fungi also exhibit a similar property--and all have\r\nobserved with what promptitude the various pine and larch cones cover\r\ntheir seed in a storm, or even when it 'looks like rain.' I remember\r\nbeing once not a little puzzled in trying to open a drawer that some\r\nweeks before had been filled with damp pine cones. Upon becoming dry,\r\neach individual had attempted a humble imitation of the genii in the\r\n'Arabian Nights,' expanding to its fullest extent, only to be subjugated\r\nby being cast again into the water.\r\n\r\nSome of the Algæ exhibit properties similar to that of the Club Moss;\r\nand a marine plant known as the Californian Rock-rose is still more\r\ncurious. Clinging closely to the rocks, and feeding upon some invisible\r\ndebris, or, like certain orchids, drawing its sustenance from the air\r\n(for the rocks upon which it grows, sometimes are lifted far above the\r\nwater), it attains an enormous size, being in some instances as large as\r\na bushel basket. It is not without a certain jagged beauty of contour,\r\nresembling, more than anything else, clusters of Arbor Vitæ branches cut\r\nout of wet leather, and meeting in the centre. Once torn from its stony\r\nbed, the Rock-rose curls up into an apparently tangled mass of network,\r\nhaving the general outline of a rose, but it will at any time, upon\r\nbeing immersed in water, assume its original appearance. I have seen a\r\nfine specimen of this plant open and close, for the hundredth time,\r\nyears after it had been taken from the rock.\r\n\r\nThe Hygrometric Ground Star (_Geastrum hygrometricum_), found in many\r\nportions of Europe, is well known; nearer home, we have a variety\r\n(_Geastrum Saratogensis_) differing in some respects from its\r\ntransatlantic relative, which is of a warm brown color, and flourishes\r\nin gravelly soil.\r\n\r\nThe American variety grows abundantly in the drifting sands of Saratoga\r\nCounty, N. Y. It has no stem or root, excepting here and there a fine\r\ncapillary fibre by which it clings to the ground. When dry, it contracts\r\nto a perfect sphere, is rolled by the wind across the sand, and\r\n(according to the account given by Dr. Asa Fitch, who has had a specimen\r\nin his possession for twenty years) shakes a few seeds from the orifice\r\nat its summit at each revolution. This seed ball also possesses the\r\npower of opening when moistened, changing its spherical form to that of\r\nan open flower about two inches in diameter. When opened, it displays\r\neight elliptical divisions, resembling petals. These are white as snow\r\non the inside, and traversed by a network of small irregular cracks,\r\nwhile their outer surface resembles kid leather, both in color and\r\ntexture.\r\n\r\nThe Ground Star differs in habit from the 'Resurrection Flower,' which\r\nnever yields its seed unless expanded by moisture (if Dr. Deck's theory\r\nbe correct), and is not nearly as intricate or beautiful in construction\r\nas the oriental relic. Indeed, to this day, the 'Resurrection Flower,'\r\nas one must call it for want of a better name, remains without a known\r\nrival in the botanical world. From time to time, brief notices\r\nconcerning it have been published; and where writers, sometimes without\r\nhaving seen the original, have claimed the knowledge or possession of\r\nsimilar specimens, they have become convinced of their mistake on\r\npersonal inspection. Even the plants alluded to in a short account,\r\ngiven eight years ago, in a leading New York periodical, as being the\r\nsame as the 'Resurrection Flower,' proved, on comparison by Dr. Eames,\r\nto be entirely different.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is by no means certain that the plant in Baron Humboldt's\r\ncollection, and that owned by Dr Eames, are the only individuals of\r\ntheir kind in existence, the fact of their great rarity is well\r\nestablished. As far as I have been able to ascertain, there is but one\r\n'Resurrection Flower' in America.\r\n\r\nThat new plants might be obtained from this lonely representative of its\r\nrace few can doubt; but to this day the germs exposed so temptingly at\r\neach awakening, have never been removed. Old as it is, it has never done\r\nits work, the only seeds it has sown being those of inquiry and\r\nadoration in the minds of all who have witnessed its marvellous powers.\r\n\r\nWhether the pretty oriental tale of its origin be true or not--and it\r\nrequires an oriental faith to believe it in the face of contradictory\r\nevidence--none can gaze upon that little emblem of 'Life in Death'--so\r\nhomely and frail, and yet so beautiful and so eternal--without peculiar\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nWhat drooping, weary soul, parched with the dust of earth, but sometimes\r\nlongs to be forever steeped in that great Love in which it may expand\r\nand bloom--casting its treasures upon Heavenly soil,--and glowing\r\nevermore with the radiance of the Awakening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now in the chambers of my heart is day,\r\n    And form and order. A most sacred guest\r\n    Is come therein, and at his high behest\r\n  Beauty and Light, who his calm glance obey,\r\n  Flew to prepare them for his regal sway.\r\n    Now solitude I seek, which once, possessed,\r\n    I fled; now, solitude to me is blessed,\r\n  Wherein I hearken Love's mysterious lay,\r\n  And hold with thee communion in my heart.\r\n    That thou art beautiful, thou who art mine--\r\n    That with thy beauty, Beauty's soul divine\r\n  Has filled my soul, I muse upon apart.\r\n    In the blue dome of Heaven's eternity,\r\n    Rising I seem upborne by thoughts of thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN-HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY OF A GERMAN CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our countrymen look upon Germany as all one. The varieties of\r\noutlandish customs, costumes, and dialects observed among our emigrant\r\npopulation from that land are little noticed, and never regarded as\r\nmarking districts of the fatherland from which they severally sprung.\r\nOne of the most fruitful themes of pleasant humor and biting sarcasm in\r\nour periodical literature and in the popular mouth, is the ignorance\r\nbetrayed by enlightened foreigners, and especially foreign journalists,\r\nin regard to the geography of our country; as though America were, _par\r\nexcellence_, THE land, and on whatever other subject the world might,\r\nwithout meriting our contempt, fail to inform itself, our country, not\r\nonly in its glorious history and more glorious destiny, but in the\r\nminuter details of the picture, must be understood and acknowledged.\r\nThis charge of ignorance is not unfounded. Often have I been not a\r\nlittle amused when an intelligent German has inquired of me as a New\r\nYorker, with the sure hope of news from his friend in Panama, or another\r\nto learn how he might collect a debt from a merchant at Valparaiso, or a\r\nthird to be informed why he received no answers to letters addressed to\r\nfriends in Cuba, and so on. But if the tables were turned upon us, there\r\nis no point on which we should be found open to a more fearful\r\nretribution than on this. I know an American gentleman of education--and\r\nhe told me the story himself--who applied at Washington for letters to\r\nour diplomatic representatives in Europe, and who had sufficiently\r\ninformed himself to be on the point of sailing for several years'\r\nresidence abroad, and still, when letters were handed him for our\r\nconsul-general at Frankfort and our minister in Prussia, asked, with no\r\nlittle concern, whether a letter to our minister in _Germany_ could not\r\nbe given him. I knew a correspondent of a New York journal fearfully to\r\nscourge a distinguished German for his ignorance of American geography.\r\nThe same person, after months of residence in Munich, having about\r\nexhausted the resources which it offered him for his correspondence,\r\ngave a somewhat detailed account of the affairs of Greece, in which he\r\nreferred to King Otho as _brother_ of King Lewis of Bavaria, although\r\nalmost any peasant could have told him that the latter was _father_ to\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there is nothing strange about this, unless it be that any one\r\nshould deem himself quite above the class of blunders which he\r\nsatirizes. It is less to be wondered at that one should continue to hurl\r\nhis satiric javelins at those who commit the same class of errors with\r\nhimself, since he seldom becomes aware of his own ridiculous mistakes.\r\nIn regard to Germany, our people know but its grand divisions and its\r\nlarge cities; and of its people among us but their exterior\r\ndistinctions, and mainly those offered to the eye, arrest attention. We\r\nmeet them as servants or employés in kitchens, shops, and gardens, and\r\non farms, or as neighbors, competitors, or associates in business. At\r\nevening we separate, and they go to their own domestic or social\r\ncircles, where alone the native character speaks itself freely forth in\r\nthe native language and dialect. There only the homebred wit and humor\r\nfreely flow and flash. There the half-forgotten legends and\r\nsuperstitions, the utterance of which to other ears than those of their\r\nown people is forbidden--perhaps by a slight sense of shame, perhaps by\r\nthe utter failure of language,--together with the pastimes and\r\nadventures of their native villages or districts, are arrested in their\r\nrapid progress to oblivion, as they are occasionally called forth to\r\namuse the dull hours or lighten the heavy ones of a home-sick life in a\r\nforeign land. Could we but half enter into the hearts of the peasant\r\nGermans who move among us, and are by some regarded as scarcely raised\r\nin refinement and sensibility above the rank of the more polished\r\ndomestic animals of our own great and enlightened land, we should often\r\nfind them replete with the choicest elements of the truly epic, the\r\ncomic, and the tragic.\r\n\r\nHow seldom do the people of different lands and languages learn to\r\nunderstand each other--become so well acquainted as to appreciate each\r\nother's most engaging traits? The German emigrant seeks a home among us,\r\nand desires to identify himself with us. The costume of his native\r\ndistrict is thrown off as soon as he needs a new garment, often much\r\nsooner. His language is laid aside except for domestic use and certain\r\nsocial and business purposes, as soon as he has a few words of ours.\r\nThese words serve the ends of business, and rarely does he ever learn\r\nenough for any other purpose. The other parts of the man remain\r\nconcealed from our view. He is to us a pure utilitarian of the grossest\r\nschool. His pipe suspended from his mouth, his whole time given to his\r\nshop, his farm, or his garden, and to certain amusements unknown to us,\r\nhe is deemed to vegetate much like the plants he grows, or to live a\r\nlife on the same level with that of the animal he feeds, incapable of\r\nappreciating those higher and more refined pleasures to which we have\r\nrisen--in other words, the true type of dulness and coarseness. An\r\nintelligent Welshman once told me that he could not talk religion in\r\nEnglish nor politics in Welsh. So with the Germans among us. Their\r\nbusiness and politics learn to put themselves into English, their\r\nreligious, domestic, and social being remains forever shut up in the\r\nenclosure of their mother tongue, and from this we rashly judge that\r\nwhat they express is all there is of them. We have never considered the\r\ndifficulty of transferring all the utterances of humanity from their\r\nfirst and native mediums to foreign ones. It is easy to learn the daily\r\nwants of life or the formal details of business in a new language. Here\r\nwords have a uniform sense. But the nice shades and turns of thought\r\nwhich appear in the happiest and most delicate jets of wit and humor,\r\nand which form the great staples of pleasant social intercourse, depend\r\nupon those subtile discriminations in the sense of words which are\r\nrarely acquired by foreigners. One may have all the words of a language\r\nand not be able to understand them in sallies of wit. How nicely\r\nadjusted then must be the scales which weigh out the innumerable and\r\ndelicate bits of pleasantry which give the charm to social life! The\r\nwords to relate the legends connected with the knights and castles of\r\nchivalry, saints, witches, elves, spooks, and gypsies, the foreigners\r\namong us never acquire, or at least never so as to have the ready and\r\ndelicate use of them in social life, until their foreign character has\r\nbecome quite absorbed in the fully developed American, and the taste, if\r\nnot the material for picturing the customs and legends of the fatherland\r\nare forever gone.\r\n\r\nIt is mainly North Germany with whose institutions we have become more\r\nor less familiar through our newspaper literature, and the numbers of\r\nstudents who have from time to time gone thither for educational\r\npurposes. Some acquaintance has also been made with Baden and\r\nWirtemberg, in South Germany, as these principalities have a population\r\nmainly Protestant; and Heidelberg, at least, has been a favorite resort\r\nfor American students. But the same is not true of Catholic South\r\nGermany. Munich's collections and institutions of art--mainly the work\r\nof the late and still living King Lewis I.--have, indeed, become\r\ngenerally known. Mary Howitt, in her 'Art Student in Munich,' has given\r\nus some graphic delineations of life there. The talented and witty\r\nBaroness Tautphoens has done us still better service in her 'Initials'\r\nand 'Quits,' in relation both to life in the capital and in the\r\nmountains; yet the character, institutions, and customs of the people\r\nremain an almost unexplored field to the American reader.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the twelfth century Munich was still an insignificant\r\nvillage on the Isar, and had not even been erected into a separate\r\nparish. About this time Henry the Lion added to his duchy of Saxony,\r\nthat of Bavaria, and having destroyed the old town of Foehring, which\r\nlay a little below the site of Munich on the other side of the river,\r\ntransferred to the latter place the market and the collection of the\r\ncustoms, which had till then been held by the bishops of Freising with\r\nthe imperial consent. The emperor Frederic I., in the year 1158,\r\nconfirmed, against the remonstrances of Bishop Otho I., the doings of\r\nHenry. The duke hastened to surround the village with a wall and moat to\r\nafford protection to those who might choose to settle there, and in\r\ntwenty years it had become a city. But the duke fell into disgrace with\r\nthe emperor, and the latter revoked the rights he had granted; but this\r\nwas like taking back a slander which had already been circulated. The\r\neffect had been produced. Munich was to become a capital.\r\n\r\nBishop Otho's successor would gladly have destroyed the infant city and\r\nthe bridge which had been the making of it. In consequence, however, of\r\nhis early death, this beneficent purpose toward his see of Freising\r\nremained unexecuted. The next successor continued the same policy. He\r\nbuilt a castle with the design of seizing the trading trains which\r\nshould take the road to Munich, perhaps deeming this the best way of\r\nmagnifying his office as a leader in the church militant. But before he\r\ncould achieve his purpose of cutting off all supplies from the rival\r\ntown, and turning trade and tribute all to his own place, a new defender\r\nof the rising city had sprung up in the house of Wittelsbocher--the same\r\nwhich still reigns over the kingdom of Bavaria,--and the matter of the\r\nfeud was finally adjusted by the quiet surrender of the bridge and the\r\ntolls to the city.\r\n\r\nThe imperial decree, therefore, of 1158, must be regarded as having laid\r\nthe foundation of Munich as a city, and accordingly the seven hundredth\r\nanniversary of its founding was celebrated in the year 1858. I shall\r\nplace a notice of this _fête_ at the head of the list of those which\r\noccurred during my residence in that capital.\r\n\r\nIt was a part of the plan that the ceremony of laying the foundation of\r\na new bridge over the Isar should be performed by the king. This was\r\ndeemed specially appropriate, because the springing up of the city had\r\ndepended upon a bridge over the river to draw thither the trade which\r\nhad gone to the old Freising. This occurred on Sunday, and I did not see\r\nit. I never heard, however, but that his majesty acquitted himself as\r\nwell in this stone mason's work as he does in the affairs of court or\r\nstate--just as well, perhaps, as one of our more democratic Chief\r\nMagistrates, accustomed to splitting rails or other kinds of manual\r\nlabor, would have done. I took a walk with my children at evening, and\r\nmet the long line of court carriages returning, followed by a procession\r\non foot, the archbishop, with some church dignitaries, walking under a\r\ncanopy and distributing, by a wave of the hand at each step of his\r\nprogress, his blessing to the crowds which thronged both sides of the\r\nbroad street. Some, perhaps, prized this more than we did, but I do not\r\nsuppose that there was anything in the nature of the blessing or in the\r\nwill of the benevolent prelate to turn it from our heretical heads.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of this celebration consisted in dinners, plays in the\r\ntheatres, a meeting at the _Rathhaus_, at which were read papers on the\r\ndevelopment of Munich for the seven hundred years of its existence, and\r\na procession, the whole occupying about a week. I shall only notice\r\nspecially the procession, and in connection with it the art exhibition\r\nfor all Germany, which closed at the same time, having been in progress\r\nfor three months; for the two greatly contributed to each other.\r\n\r\nThe illustrated weekly, published at Stuttgart by the well-known\r\nnovelist Hacklaender, under the title of _Ueber Land und Meer_, refers\r\nto these festivities in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     'Munich, the South German metropolis of art, was, during the\r\n     closing days of September, transformed into a festive city. The\r\n     German artists had assembled from all parts of the country, that\r\n     they might, within those walls, charmed by the genius of the muses,\r\n     wander through the halls in which the academy had collected the\r\n     best works of German art, and take counsel upon the common\r\n     interests, as they had formerly done at Bingen and Stuttgart. The\r\n     artists and the magistracy vied with each other in preparing happy\r\n     days for the visitors--an emulation which was crowned with the most\r\n     delightful results. The artists' festival, however, was but the\r\n     harbinger to the the city of the great seventh centennial birthday\r\n     festival of the Bavarian capital, which had been so long in\r\n     preparation, and was waited for with such impatience. Concerts and\r\n     theatres opened the festal series. Services in all the churches of\r\n     both confessions consecrated the coming days, and the laying of the\r\n     foundation of the new bridge over the Isar, leading to the\r\n     Maximilianeum, formed, historically, a monumental memorial for the\r\n     occasion. Favored by the fairest of weather, the city celebrated\r\n     the main festival on the 27th of September. It was a historical\r\n     procession, moved through all the principal streets of the city,\r\n     and caused departed centuries to pass in full life before the eyes\r\n     of the citizens and the vast assemblage of strangers there present.\r\n     It was no masquerade, but a true picture of the civilization of the\r\n     city, from its first appearance in history to the present day--'a\r\n     mirrored image,' says a chronicler of the festival, 'of times long\r\n     since gone by.\r\n\r\n     'The twelfth century opened the procession--representations of the\r\n     present time in science, art, and industry, as developed under the\r\n     reigns of Lewis and Maximilian, which have been so promotive of all\r\n     that is great, closed it up. But one voice was heard in regard to\r\n     the success of this festival.'\r\n\r\nThe plan was to let representatives of the people for this whole period\r\nof seven hundred years pass before the eyes of the spectators in the\r\nfashions and costumes of their respective ages, bearing the implements\r\nor badges of their several guilds or professions. The preparation had\r\nbeen begun months beforehand. Artists had been employed to sketch\r\ndesigns. The best had been selected. The costumes were historical. We\r\nsee sometimes in every part of our country, costumes extemporized from\r\ngarrets for old folks' concerts and other like occasions, but generally\r\nthey do not correspond with each other, or with the performances. The\r\nresult is committed to accident. The actors wear what their meagre\r\nwardrobes of the antique furnish. The wider the divergence from present\r\nfashions the better. Chance may bring together the styles of a dozen\r\nsuccessive periods, and render the whole without coherence. In such an\r\nexhibition our interest is felt simply in the grotesque. It shows us how\r\na countenance familiar to us is set off by a strange and outlandish\r\ncostume. It represents no history. Such was not this procession. Its\r\nfront had twelfth century costumes of peasants, burghers, and even the\r\nducal family. So down to the very day of the festival; for statues of\r\nthe present royal family on open cars closed up the long line. It did\r\nnot seem indeed quite right that the successive ages of the dead should\r\npass before us living, and the living age alone lifeless. In one part of\r\nthe procession was an imperial carriage of state drawn by six horses, a\r\nman in livery leading each horse, with all the necessary footmen,\r\noutriders, and outrunners. The whole was antiquity and novelty happily\r\ncombined. The costumes and insignia of all classes, with the tools and\r\nimplements of all handicrafts, from the day when Duke Henry and Bishop\r\nOtho, seven hundred years before, had had their petty bickerings about\r\nthe tolls of a paltry village, down to the present day, the whole\r\ntransformed into a living panorama, and made to pass in about four hours\r\nbefore the eye.\r\n\r\nTo set forth great things by small, a bridal pair remove from the East\r\nand settle in our Western wilds. In a score of years they return to\r\ntheir native place, wearing the very garments in which they had stood up\r\nand been pronounced husband and wife. The picture is equal to a volume\r\nof history and one of comedy, the two bound in one. But here, instead of\r\na score of _years_ we have a score of _ages_, reaching back to a period\r\nfarther beyond that great popular movement in which modern society had\r\nits birth, than that is anterior to our own age. If all the costumes,\r\nfashions, implements, and tools of the house, the shop, and the field,\r\ninsignia and liveries, from those of the first Dutch settlers of New\r\nAmsterdam, down to those of New York's belles, beaux, and beggars of the\r\npresent day, should be made to pass in review before us, how absurdly\r\ngrotesque would be the scene! That veritable 'History of New York from\r\nthe Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrick\r\nKnickerbocker,' has perhaps shaken as many sides and helped digest as\r\nmany dinners as almost any book since Cervantes gave the world his\r\naccount of the adventures of his knight Don Quixote, and yet this great\r\nhistorical work hints but a part of that picture, though doubtless\r\ngreatly improved by the author's delicate touches, which would pass\r\nbefore us in a procession illustrating two centuries of New York's\r\nhistory. Using such hints, the reader may partially judge of the\r\nimpression made by this setting forth of seven centuries of a capital of\r\nCentral Europe, and yet one can hardly tell, without the trial, whether\r\nhe would rather smile at the grotesqueness of the pageant, or be lost in\r\nthe profound contemplation of the magnificent march of history reënacted\r\nin this drama.\r\n\r\nThis procession spoke but to the eye. It was but a tableau, dumb, though\r\nin its way eloquent. It detailed no actions; it only hinted them. It\r\nsimply presented the men who acted, clad in the outward garb, and\r\nbearing the tools and weapons of their day. The cut of a garment, the\r\nform of a helmet or halberd, a saddle or a semitar, a hoe or a hatchet,\r\nor the cut of the hair or the beard, may speak of the heart and soul,\r\nonly, however, by distant hints. But just as the representation is less\r\ndistinct and detailed, is it a mightier lever for imagination to use in\r\nraising again to life centuries which had long slept in the dust. The\r\nsuperstructure of history, indeed, which we should rear upon such a\r\nbasis, would be wide of the truth on one side, just as the narratives\r\nand philosophical disquisitions which come to us under that name are on\r\nthe other. History generally relates those things in which all ages have\r\nbeen most alike--the same which have 'been from the beginning and ever\r\nshall be'--the intrigues of courts and of diplomacy--varied mainly by\r\nthe influence of the religion of the Bible, as at first persecuted, then\r\nrising by degrees to a rank either with or above the state, and becoming\r\na persecuting power, and then finally modifying and softening down the\r\nnative rudeness of the human race, until mutual and universal tolerance\r\nis the result; court life, diplomacy, and war, however, remaining and\r\nstill to remain the perpetual subjects of historical composition. But\r\nbetween this elevated range and the humble one of burghers' tools and\r\ncostumes, lies a boundless field of aspect, variegated with all the\r\nforms which checker social and domestic life. Oh!--thought a little\r\ngroup of American spectators occupying a room near the corner of Ludwig\r\nand Theresien streets--could we but rend the veil of time which conceals\r\nMunich's seven hundred years of burgher and peasant life, how odd, how\r\nrude a scene would present itself! The reader's fancy may make the\r\nattempt. I will aid a little if I can, and there was indeed some\r\nmaterial furnished in addresses prepared for that occasion, and in some\r\nother papers which have come into my hands.\r\n\r\nThe people of that little village on the banks of the Isar were but the\r\nowners and tillers of the barren soil. Nearly a century (1238) after\r\nHenry the Lion had surrounded it with walls, and a local magistracy had\r\nbeen chosen; when two parishes--those of St. Peter and St. Mary--had\r\nbeen already long established, we find a schoolmaster signing, doubtless\r\nby virtue of his office, a certificate of the freedom of a certain\r\nmonastery from the city customs. That the school teacher must, _ex\r\nofficio_, sign such papers, spoke volumes. How few could have had the\r\nlearning, for it must indeed be done in Latin. And then the history of\r\nthe city runs nearly a century back of this date. What was the burgher\r\nlife of that first century of Munich's history? It is but the faintest\r\necho that answers. Schools there were at that day and long before. Nay,\r\nthe cloister schools were already in decay; but more than three hundred\r\nyears were yet to elapse before the rise of the Jesuit schools. Three\r\nhundred years! How can we, of this age of steam, estimate what was\r\nslowly revolving in society in those years? In 1271 we find an order of\r\nthe bishop of Freising requiring the parish rector to have a school in\r\neach parish of the city; half a century later than this we meet\r\ndocumentary evidence that school teaching had assumed a rank with other\r\nworldly occupations, and was no longer subject to the rector of the\r\nparish. If I could but set the reader down in a school room of that day,\r\nI might forego any attempt to portray the times; but, alas! I cannot. He\r\nwould, however, doubtless see there groups of boys--for I half suspect\r\nthat this was before girls had generally developed the capability of\r\nlearning--the faces and garments clean or smutty, showing the grade of\r\nsocial progress which had been gained, for we may presume that the use\r\nof soap and water had been to some extent introduced, and if so, I have\r\nerred again, for the dirty and the ragged did not go to school. These\r\ncould do without education. We should see, too, the beaming or the dull\r\nand leaden eye--if, indeed, the eye spoke then as now--proclaiming the\r\nmaster's success or failure. And then the schoolmaster, the chief figure\r\nin the group, would be found to have the _otium cum dignitate_, and\r\nespecially the former, in a higher sense than is now known. And what was\r\nthe staple information which circulated among the people? Of this we\r\nknow more. It was made up of adventures of knights, miracles wrought by\r\nthe host, by crucifixes and Madonnas, and apparitions of saints, leading\r\nsome emperor or prince to found a church or monastery--a kind of history\r\nwhich few churches or other religious institutions want. If there was\r\nless of life in the humanity of that age than we have at present, there\r\nwas as much more in other things; for even those holy pictures and\r\nstatues could move their eyes and other parts. They found various ways\r\nof expressing approbation of the pious, and frowning upon scoffers.\r\nCrucifixes and Madonnas, carried by freshets over barren fields, brought\r\nfertility. The devil, too, figured more largely in the narratives of\r\ndays before printed books formed the basis of education. He generally\r\nappeared in the persons of giants and witches, which latter were his\r\nagents by special contract. Their freaks had all shades of enormity,\r\nfrom the slight teasing of the housewife in her baking and churning to\r\nthe peril of life and limb and endless perdition. The devil sometimes\r\ncoming in one of these forms endangered the lives of the quiet people of\r\nthe city by formally dismissing the watch between the hours of eleven\r\nand twelve o'clock at night. So hundreds of things which he has become\r\ntoo genteel in our day to practise.\r\n\r\nThe founding of the city was near the close of that great movement known\r\nas the crusades. What a world of material these furnished to be used in\r\npopular education! The feats of knights, instead of assuming distinct\r\nforms and being stereotyped and told to them in books, were surrendered\r\nto the popular mouth for preservation and propagation. Saints, angels,\r\nand demons attached themselves from time to time to these circulating\r\nmyths. Original characters often dropped out, and the discrimination of\r\nthe wisest believer in the real and ideal, became confused. Then came\r\nthe period of the Hussite war. This gave rise to many a miracle of\r\ndivine judgment. The Bohemian mocker of the holy mass, or of some\r\nwonder-working statue of the Virgin, is pursued with divine vengeance.\r\nThe Jews--how suggestive the name, in the history of mediæval Europe, of\r\nmystery, miracle, and murder!--were early allowed to settle in Munich.\r\nThey were assigned to a particular street. In the year 1285 a story was\r\nstarted--it had been long stereotyped, and editions of it circulated in\r\nevery part of Christendom--of the murder of a Christian child. A\r\npersecution of the Jews was the result--one hundred and forty were\r\nburned in their own houses--and the poor Israelites must doubtless\r\nsuffer without redress, although many of them were then, as they now\r\nare, bankers and brokers to the spiritual and temporal lords. Not far\r\nfrom the same time the ducal mint was destroyed, because the people were\r\nenraged to find the metal in their coin growing alarmingly less. For\r\nthis the city must pay a fine.\r\n\r\nFrom our first knowledge of this town it continued gradually, but very\r\nslowly, to advance in intelligence--we should rather say from century to\r\ncentury than from year to year; for during this period progress was too\r\nslow to be perceptible, unless the observation were verified by the\r\npillars erected to mark the boundary lines between successive centuries.\r\nThe inquirer into the past often sighs out the wish that art had found a\r\nway to transmit full impressions of all departed generations to the\r\nlatest living one. Perhaps he prudently limits the desired favor to\r\nhimself, otherwise the wish would not be wise; its realization would\r\nplace every lazy observer upon the same level with the studious\r\ninvestigator. The cumbrous details, too, of sixty centuries piled upon\r\none mind would crush it, unless human nature were a very different thing\r\nfrom that which we now behold. It is in accordance with a wise plan of\r\nProvidence that the deeds of past ages should perish with them, except\r\nthe few needed to cast their gleam of light upon the world's future\r\npathway. We are made capable of rescuing just enough for the highest\r\npurposes of life, not enough to overwhelm and burden us in our march\r\ntoward the goal before us. It is thought by some that the point and\r\nfinish of the ancient Greek authors, as compared with the moderns, is\r\nattributable to the fact that they were less perplexed with accumulated\r\nlore and the multiplication of books and subjects of study. Their minds\r\nwere not subject to the dissipating effects of large libraries, and\r\ndaily newspapers with telegraphs from Asia, Africa, and Hesperia. I\r\nshall not discuss this question. The amount of information handed down\r\nfrom past ages even _now_ is but as the spray which rises above the\r\nocean's surface to the vast depths which lie below. The historical\r\nfossils of those ages are therefore left to exercise the genius of the\r\nCuviers of historical inquiry. As that naturalist could, from a single\r\nbone of an extinct animal species, make up and describe the animal, so\r\nhave inquirers into the past succeeded in picturing a departed age from\r\nthe few relics left of it. Hence we are treated occasionally with such\r\nagreeable surprises in the march of history as the discovery of Pompeii,\r\nHerculaneum, and Nineveh. The genius of our Wincklemanns, Champollions,\r\nHumboldts, and Layards has found a worthy field. Such days as that I am\r\nattempting to describe, representing seven centuries of a modern capital\r\nbefore the admiring eyes of the present generation of its people, become\r\npossible. Instead of the monotony of a perpetual observation, we have\r\nthe charm of alternate lulls and surprises.\r\n\r\nThis picture has a further likeness to the naturalist's description made\r\nfrom the fossils of extinct genera of animals. In the latter the animal\r\nis made to stand before us. We have the data necessary to infer his\r\nhabits. But we see him not perfect in his wilderness home of unnumbered\r\nages past. We see him not the pursuer or the pursued; we hear not the\r\nfierce growls or the plaintive note of alarm or distress. These we must\r\nimagine. So, too, the slowly and peacefully moving train which passes\r\nour windows, setting forth the sleeping centuries of this city. There is\r\nthe emperor in state--dukes in ducal magnificence--knights in armor with\r\nhorses richly and fancifully caparisoned--citizens in the dress of their\r\ntimes--the various mechanics' and traders' guilds, with their\r\nimplements, their badges and their banners, with priests thickly\r\nscattered through the whole line, which is ever changing as the\r\nrepresentatives of one age succeed those of another. The whole is calm\r\nand quiet. The fierce contests, the angry broils, private and\r\npublic--now throwing the whole city into a ferment of innocent alarm,\r\nnow deluging its streets with blood--the rage of plagues, sealing up the\r\nsources of human activity, and causing the stillness of the grave to\r\nsettle over the scene--all these we must supply; and surely the\r\nthoughtful mind is busy in doing this as it contemplates the passing\r\ntrain. We conceive rival claimants for the ducal throne, contending,\r\nregardless of dying counsel, until death again settles what death had\r\nthrown open to contest. Everything which has ever transpired on the\r\ntheatre of the world's great empires, may be conceived as enacted on\r\nthis narrower stage. The difference is less in talents and prowess than\r\nin the extent of the field and the numbers of actors.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of the Reformation down we can form the picture with\r\nmore distinctness. Seehofen, son of a citizen of Munich, while a student\r\nat Wittenberg, received Luther's doctrine, and through him many of his\r\ntownsmen. The most learned and able opponent whom the Reformer had to\r\nencounter was John Eck, chancellor of the Bavarian University of\r\nIngolstadt--one of the most renowned at that day in Europe--which, by\r\nremoval to the capital, has now become the University of Munich. In 1522\r\nDuke William, of Bavaria, issued an edict forbidding any of his people\r\nto receive the reformed doctrine. Bavaria, therefore, remained Catholic,\r\nand Munich became the headquarters of German Catholicism. The electoral\r\nduke, Maximilian, of Bavaria, was head of the Catholic league which\r\ncarried on the 'Thirty Years' War' against the Protestants under\r\nGustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, in the early part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The city is full of sayings derived from this whole period,\r\nsuch as to leave us no ground to wonder that few Catholics are inclined\r\nto become Protestants. The only Protestant church in the city was built\r\nwithin the last thirty years. It is but a few years since the house was\r\nstill shown in Scudlinger street, in which Luther, in his flight from\r\nAugsburg, whither he had been called to answer for his teaching before\r\nCardinal di Vio in 1518,[8] stopped, his horse all in a foam, to take a\r\ndrink, and in his hurry forgot to pay for the piece of sausage which he\r\nate. In the market place was a likeness of Luther and his 'Katherl.'[9]\r\nThere are also numerous derisive pictures, such as the Reformer riding\r\nupon a swine, with a sausage in his hand, which, however, all originated\r\nin the mockery of the Jews, who were afterward compelled to surrender\r\nsome of them to the leading spirit of the Reformation. At Saurloch, a\r\nlittle distance south of Munich, there were still, in 1840, to be seen\r\npictures of Luther and his wife in a group made up of chimney sweeps,\r\nbuffoons, and many others of the class. As this age passed before the\r\neyes of the spectators, they would doubtless give it new life by\r\nattributing to it the spirit exemplified in these choice and tasteful\r\npictures and sayings, amusing at this day, doubtless, to both parties.\r\n\r\nThe period of the 'Thirty Years' War' and the visit to Munich of\r\nGustavus Adolphus has left more sayings and monuments, and thus do more\r\nhonor to the people. After the Catholic victory near Prague, in 1620,\r\nthe elector celebrated a public entry into the city amid the jubilations\r\nof the people and the Jesuits. A pillar was erected in remembrance of\r\nthe victory, and dedicated, eighteen years afterward, to the Virgin, in\r\naccordance with a vow. The city was also variously adorned. The\r\nrejoicing was somewhat premature. In 1632 the duchess and ducal family\r\nhad to remove to Salzburg for safety, whither they carried with them the\r\nbones of St. Benno, the patron saint of the city, and other valuables.\r\nThe king of Sweden entered the walls under a promise, which he had made\r\nin consideration of three hundred thousand florins, to be paid to him by\r\nthe people, to secure them against fire, sword, and plunder. Ladies\r\nfreely gave up their precious ornaments to make up the amount. But they\r\nfailed. The conqueror took forty-two priests of the religious orders,\r\nand twenty respectable citizens, as hostages for the payment. These\r\nwandered around with his camp for three years, and then all returned\r\nexcept four, who died during the time. The traditions of the people give\r\nthe king credit for having strictly abstained from plunder, and executed\r\nthe only man who transgressed his rule, although the citizens failed on\r\ntheir part. How beautifully the brilliant and the glorious mingle with\r\nthe sad and the sombre in the picture which we form of this age as the\r\npassing train brings it before our minds! How religion, variously tinged\r\nwith the sable hues of superstition, wrought upon that age! The Swedish\r\nking, the moment victory turns in his favor, dropping upon his knees in\r\nthe midst of the dead and the dying, the clouds of smoke and dust as yet\r\nunsettled, pours out his soul in fervent prayer and thanksgiving.[10] He\r\nbut represents his army and his age. The Catholic army are not less\r\ndevout in their way. Germany is full of monuments and sayings of this\r\nperiod. Those of Munich are of the Catholic side. There stands in a\r\npublic square an equestrian statue of colossal size, in bronze, of the\r\nelector Maximilian, head of the Catholic League--his pillar to the\r\nVirgin still stands--and the great general of the League, Count Tilley,\r\nrepresented in bronze, is among the prominent objects viewed by the\r\nvisitor to this capital. On the other hand, the greatest organization in\r\nEurope for the aid of Protestants in Catholic lands, having branches\r\neverywhere, bears the name of Gustavus Adolphus. Let the reader then\r\nconceive the visions which flit through the minds of the spectators as\r\nthis age passes in review before them.\r\n\r\nBut here I shall close this part of the picture. The description of the\r\ncity as it now exists belongs in other connections. It has been\r\nsuggested, as greatly adding to the interest of this birthday festival\r\nof the capital, that it concurred in time with the exhibition of the art\r\nof all Germany in the Crystal Palace. Although the two had no natural\r\nconnection, yet they became so intertwined in fact as not easily to be\r\nseparated. I shall therefore just touch upon the art display.\r\n\r\nWorks of art are dry subjects of description, and that too just in the\r\nproportion of their exquisiteness to behold. Things made for the eye\r\nmust be presented to the eye. Works of a coarse and comic nature can,\r\nindeed, be described so as to produce their effect. Here, for instance,\r\nis a railroad-station man. Such in Bavaria, dressed in their quaint\r\nlittle red coats, must stand with the hand to the hat as if in token of\r\nprofound respect for the train while it passes. This one, when lathered\r\nand half shaved, was suddenly called by the train, and in this\r\npredicament he stands while it passes. The best new work in the\r\nexhibition was one in water colors by Professor Schwind, of Munich,\r\nsetting forth the popular German myth of the seven ravens. It sold to a\r\nprince for seven thousand florins. I know better than to attempt a\r\ndescription. The 'Raising of Jairus' Daughter,' a picture sent on by the\r\nking of Prussia, gave the best impression I have ever had of life once\r\ndeparted, and now suddenly beginning again to quiver on the lip and\r\ngleam in the eye; or as Willis has it:\r\n\r\n                    'And suddenly a flush\r\n  Shot o'er her forehead and along her lips,\r\n  And through her cheek the rallied color ran;\r\n  And the still outline of her graceful form\r\n  Stirred in the linen vesture;'\r\n\r\nthus changing the sadness of the family assembled round the couch into a\r\nlustre sympathetic with that of her own reopened eyes.\r\n\r\nThese specimens have been given to show that such subjects are incapable\r\nof description. The exhibition continued from June to October, and the\r\ncollection was so extensive that a shorter period would have been\r\nscarcely sufficient for the study of works exhibited. During this time\r\nthe characteristic enthusiasm and jealousies of the artists were\r\nvariously exemplified. The delightful hours spent in walking through\r\nthese halls will be among my latest remembrances.\r\n\r\nThis whole festive period culminated with the closing days of September.\r\nThe city had been unusually full all summer, but as its great birthday\r\nfestival approached, the crowds thickened, until its capacity for\r\nlodging room had been transcended. All parts of Germany were\r\nrepresented, nor did delegates from the rest of the civilized world\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, whether New York, Boston, or Philadelphia\r\nhas a history which would appear well in such a drama! Although our\r\nhistory extends back over little more than one fourth of the period\r\noccupied by that of Munich, it might afford this material. The annals of\r\npublic events would be found preserved with great fulness and\r\ndistinctness--the archives of city and state councils and of the\r\nchurches would supply the needed facts--but who could furnish the\r\nfashions, tools, and implements of each successive age from that of the\r\nPilgrim fathers to that of the great rebellion? Who would perform the\r\nlabor of research necessary to ascertain what they were? Where is the\r\nAmerican court, supported at an expense of several millions per annum,\r\nto preserve all these in collections, or to get them up for court\r\ntheatres? Who would pay for making all these for a procession of twenty\r\nthousand persons, with all the necessary horses and carriages? And\r\nsurely, if we could not feel the confidence that everything was\r\nhistorical, all our interest in the display would be gone. I am\r\napprehensive that we shall be obliged to leave such exhibitions to those\r\ncountries which have hereditary heads, and, making a virtue of\r\nnecessity, console ourselves with the thought that we have something\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Luther was not in Munich at that time, if indeed he ever\r\nwas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Catherine Bora, Luther's wife.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Vide_ Schiller's 'Geschichte des dreisigjährigen\r\nKrieges.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DANISH SAILOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Far by the Baltic shore,\r\n    Where storied Elsinore\r\n  Rears its dark walls, invincible to time;\r\n    Where yet Horatio walks,\r\n    And with Marcellus talks,\r\n  And Hamlet dreams soliloquy sublime;\r\n\r\n    Though forms of Old Romance,\r\n    Mail-clad, with shield and lance,\r\n  Are laid in 'fair Ophelia's' watery tomb,\r\n    Still, passion rules her hour,\r\n    Love, Hate, Revenge, have power,\r\n  And hearts, in Elsinore, know joy and gloom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Grouped round a massy gun\r\n    Black sleeping in the sun,\r\n  The belted gunners list to many a tale\r\n    Told by grim Jarl, the tar,\r\n    Old Danish dog of war,\r\n  Of his young days in battle and in gale.\r\n\r\n    The medal at his breast,\r\n    The single-sleeved blue vest,\r\n  His thin, white hair, tossed by the Norway breeze,\r\n    His knotted, horny hand,\r\n    And wrinkled face, dark tanned,\r\n  Tell of the times when Nelson sailed the seas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Steam-winged, upon the tides\r\n    A gallant vessel glides,\r\n  Two royal flags float blended at her fore,\r\n    Gay convoyed by a fleet,\r\n    Whose answering guns repeat\r\n  The joyous 'God speeds' thundered from the shore.\r\n\r\n  'Look, comrades!

These two far distant points of view are the\r\nforeign and the native. We are, more perhaps than any other nation in\r\nexistence, a peculiar people. Our institutions are new and in most\r\nrespects original, and cannot be judged by the experience of other\r\nnations. Our manner of life and modes of thought--all our ideas of\r\nindividual and national progress, are _sui generis_, and our experience,\r\nboth social and political, as based upon those ideas, has been similar\r\nto that of no other race which history records. Hence to the foreign\r\nhistorian or philosopher our inner life is a sealed book; he can neither\r\nunderstand the hidden springs of action which govern all the movements\r\nof our body politic, nor appreciate the motives or the aspirations of\r\nthe American mind: in a word, he can never be imbued with the _spirit_\r\nof our intellectual and moral life, which alone can give the key-note to\r\nprophecy, the pitch and tone to true and impartial history. And he who,\r\nreasoning from the few _à priori_ truths of human nature, or from those\r\ncharacteristics which the American mind possesses in common with that of\r\nthe Old World, shall pretend to treat of our systems and our\r\nintellectual life, or to map out our future destiny, will be as much at\r\nfault as the historian of a thousand years ago who should attempt to\r\nportray the events of this our day and generation. The historian of\r\nAmerican civilization must not only be among us, but _of_ us--one who is\r\nable not only to identify his material interests with those of the great\r\nAmerican people, but also to partake of our moral habitudes, to be\r\nactuated by the same feelings, desires, aspirations, and be governed by\r\nthe same motives. By such an one alone, who is able to understand our\r\nmoral life in all its phases and bearings, can a clear and truthful view\r\nbe taken of the great events which are continually agitating our\r\nsociety, and their bearings upon our present and future civilization be\r\ncorrectly estimated.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely from lack of this sympathy and of appreciation of the\r\ndifficulties under which we have labored, that America has suffered in\r\nthe opinion of the world. For the foreign view, looking upon us not as a\r\nnew people, but as the offshoot of an old and cultivated race, has\r\nconceded to us little more than a certain mechanical ingenuity in\r\nfitting together the parts of an edifice built upon a foundation already\r\nlaid for us away back in the ages--a carrying out of plans already\r\nperfected for us, and requiring little of originality for their\r\ndevelopment; forgetting that oftentimes the laying of the foundation is\r\nthe easiest part of the work, while the erection and embellishment of\r\nthe superstructure has taxed the efforts of the loftiest genius. In so\r\nfar as regards the development of the national mind, the strengthening\r\nof the originating and energetic faculties, and the capability of\r\nprofound and well directed thought arising therefrom, we are, as a race,\r\ndeeply indebted to our progenitors of the Old World, and we have reaped\r\ntherefrom a great advantage over other nationalities in their inception.\r\nBut aside from these benefits, the cultivation of the race before the\r\nsettlement of our country has been rather a hamper upon our progress.\r\nFor here was to be inaugurated a new civilization, upon a different\r\nbasis from and entirely incompatible with that of the Old World; here\r\nwas to be established an idea antagonistic to those of the preexisting\r\nworld, and evolving a new and more progressive social life, which needed\r\nnot only a new sphere and new material, but also entire freedom from the\r\nrestraints of the old-time civilization. And it is harder to unlearn an\r\nold lesson than to learn a new. The institutions and modes of thought of\r\nthe Old World are to the last degree unfavorable to the progress of such\r\na nationality as ours. Their tendency being toward the aggrandizement of\r\nthe few and the centralization of power, renders them wholly\r\nincompatible with that freedom of thought and action, that opening up of\r\nlarge fields of exertion as well as of the road to distinction and\r\neminence, with all their incentives to effort, which are the very life\r\nof a majestic republic stretching over a large portion of the earth's\r\nsurface, embracing such mixed nationalities, and founded upon principles\r\nof progress both in its physical and mental relations which have\r\nrendered it in very truth a new experiment among the nations. We had\r\nfirst to forget the divine right of kings, and the invidious\r\ndistinctions of class, with all their deep-seated and time-honored\r\nprejudices, and to start forward in a different and hitherto despised\r\npath toward which the iron hand of our necessity pointed, and in which\r\nall men should be considered equal in their rights, and the position of\r\neach should depend, not upon the distance to which he could trace a\r\nproud genealogy, but upon the energy with which he should grapple with\r\nthe stern realities of life, the honesty and uprightness with which he\r\nshould tread its path, and the use he should make of the blessings which\r\nGod and his own exertions bestowed upon him. We had to learn the great\r\nbut simple lesson that\r\n\r\n  'The rank is but the guinea's stamp,\r\n  The man's the man for a' that;'\r\n\r\nand in so doing, to accept, for a time, the position of the Pariahs of\r\nChristendom, through the imputation of degrading all things high and\r\nnoble to the rank of the low and vulgar, of casting the pearls of a\r\nlofty and ennobled class before the swinish multitude, of throwing open\r\nthe doors of the treasury, that creatures of low, plebeian blood might\r\ngrasp the crown jewels which had for ages been kept sacred to the\r\npatrician few; in a word, we had to take upon ourselves all the odium of\r\na despised democracy--a moral agrarianism which should make common\r\nproperty of all blessings and privileges, and mingle together all\r\nthings, pure and impure, in one common hotch-potch of corruption and\r\ndegradation. Greater heresy than all this was not then known, and the\r\nphilosopher of to-day has little conception of the sacrifice required of\r\nthose who would at that time accept such a position.\r\n\r\nAnother and not less important lesson which our ancestors had to learn\r\nwas, that national prosperity which depends upon the learning and\r\nrefinement or energy of a certain privileged class, can never be\r\notherwise than ephemeral; that the common people--the low plebeians,\r\nwhom they had been taught to consider of the least importance in the\r\nstate, are in reality the strength of the land; and that in the\r\namelioration of their condition, in the education and mental training of\r\nthe masses, while at the same time placing before them the highest\r\nincentives to individual exertion, lies the only sure basis of an\r\nenduring prosperity--that the only healthful national growth is that\r\nwhich is made up of the individual strivings of the great mass rather\r\nthan the self-interested movements of the few; and as a consequence of\r\nthis truth, that the privileged minority is really the least important\r\nof the two classes in any community. In the infancy of government, when\r\na rude and unlettered people are little able to take care of\r\nthemselves, the establishment of class distinctions is undoubtedly\r\nconducive to progress, as it tends to unite the people, thereby\r\ncounteracting the thousand petty jealousies and strifes and bickerings\r\nwhich invariably beset an infant people, and to organize and systematize\r\nall progressive effort. It is, in fact, a putting of the people to\r\nschool under such wholesome restraints as shall compel them forward\r\nwhile guarding them against those evil influences which militate against\r\ntheir prosperity. But in the course of events the time comes when these\r\nrestraints are no longer necessary, but rather become hampers upon the\r\nwheels of progress; and when that period arrives, all these invidious\r\ndistinctions should, in a well-regulated state, gradually disappear and\r\ngive place to that freedom which is essential to individual advancement\r\nas the basis of national power. Trained as our ancestors had been to\r\nconsider these distinctions divinely appointed, it was no easy task for\r\nthem to abrogate so aged and apparently sacred a system, and nothing but\r\nthe material evidence before their eyes in the experience of their own\r\nsociety, convincing them that such a course was an actual necessity of\r\ntheir future well-being, could have induced them so to depart from the\r\nteachings of their progenitors. Nor was it less difficult to determine\r\nhow far these safeguards of the olden time might safely be dispensed\r\nwith, or where or how deeply the knife should be applied which, in the\r\nfallibility of human judgment, might possibly cut away some main root of\r\ntheir social organization. Here was required the exercise of the\r\nprofoundest wisdom and the most careful discretion--wisdom unassisted by\r\nany experience in the past history of the world other than that of the\r\nutter failure of all past experiments in any way similar to their own.\r\nTo us of to-day, viewed in the light of intervening experience and of\r\nthe increased knowledge of human affairs, this may seem a little thing;\r\nbut to them it was not so, for the path was new and untried, and they\r\nwere surrounded by the thickest of darkness. Thus it will be seen that\r\nin the founding of our system there were great difficulties, which only\r\nthe loftiest aims and the utmost firmness and determination in the cause\r\nof the good and the true, with the liveliest sense of the necessities\r\nand the yearnings of human nature, and the true end of all human\r\nexistence, could have overcome,--difficulties which, with all the\r\ncultivation of their past, rendered their task not less arduous than\r\nthat of the founders of any community recorded in history even among the\r\nrudest and most savage of peoples. And for all their energy and\r\nperseverance the world has not yet given them the credit which is their\r\ndue, although the yearly developing results of their labors are\r\ngradually restoring them to their proper position in the appreciation of\r\nhumanity. And the time will come when their memory will be cherished all\r\nover the earth as that of the greatest benefactors of the human kind. As\r\nthe Alpine glacier year after year heaves out to its surface the bodies\r\nof those who many decades ago were buried beneath the everlasting snows,\r\nso time in its revolutions heaves up to the view of the world, one by\r\none, the great facts of the buried past, to be carefully laid away in\r\nthe graveyard of memory, with a towering monument above them to mark to\r\nall succeeding ages the spot where they have wrought in the interest of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nAnother evil effect of this same foreign view is to lead the world to\r\nexpect of us, the descendants of an old and polished civilization, more\r\nthan is warranted by the facts of our history or even by the\r\ncapabilities of human nature in its present stage. And this, too, arises\r\nfrom a false estimate of the difficulties which have beset us on every\r\nside, and from the paucity of the world's experience, and consequent\r\nknowledge, of such experiments as our own. The march of human\r\nadvancement has but just begun in this its new path; and it is but\r\nlittle wonder that, excited by our past successes, and stimulated to an\r\ninordinate degree as their ideas of progress have become through the new\r\ntruths which our efforts have brought to light, the friends of human\r\nfreedom all over the world should expect from us more astonishing\r\ndevelopments, more rapid progress, than is compatible with the frailties\r\nand fallibilities of our humanity. Hence in the light of this morbid\r\nview our greatest successes are looked upon as somewhat below the\r\nstandard which our advantages demand.\r\n\r\nWith the foreign view we, as a nation, have nothing to do. We must be\r\ncontent to act entirely independently of the opinions of the outside\r\nworld, being only careful steadfastly to pursue the path of right,\r\nleaving to future ages to vindicate our ideas and our motives. So only\r\ncan we possess that true national independence which is the foundation\r\nof all national dignity and worth, and the source of all progress. We\r\nmust free ourselves from all the hampering influences of old-time dogmas\r\nand worn-out theories of social life, content to submit to the\r\naspersions of Old-World malice, confident that time will prove the\r\ncorrectness of our policy. So only can we throw wide open the doors of\r\ninvestigation, and give free scope to those truths which will not fail\r\nto follow the earnest strivings of a great people for the purest right\r\nand the highest good.\r\n\r\nIn estimating any civilization at its true value, the law of God is\r\nobviously the highest standard. Yet in these days of divided opinion and\r\nextended scepticism, when scarcely any two hold exactly the same\r\nreligious views, and when all manner of beliefs are professedly founded\r\non Holy Writ, such a comparison would only result in as many different\r\nestimates as there are reflecting minds, and the investigation would be\r\nin no degree advanced. Even the moral sense of our own community is so\r\ndivided upon the distinctions of abstract right, that the application of\r\nsuch a standard to our civilization would only open endless fields of\r\nuseless because interested and bigoted discussions.\r\n\r\nThere are two other and more feasible methods of conducting such an\r\ninvestigation; the first of which is that of comparing our own\r\ncivilization with that of Europe; marking the differences, and judging\r\nof them according to our knowledge of human nature and the light of past\r\nexperience and analogy. Yet such a course presents the serious objection\r\nof preventing an impartial judgment through the strong temptation to\r\nself-laudation, which is in itself the blinding of reason as well as the\r\ncounteraction of all aspirations for a still higher good.\r\n\r\nThe third and last method is that which takes cognizance of the most\r\nobvious and deeply felt evils connected with our own system, and\r\nreasoning from universally conceded principles of abstract right, and\r\nfrom the highest moral standard of our own society, to study how they\r\nmay best be remedied and errors most successfully combated. From such a\r\ncourse of investigation truth cannot fail to be evolved, and the moral\r\nappreciation of the thinker to be heightened. For such a method presents\r\nless danger of partiality from local prejudices, religious bias, or\r\nnational antipathy. And such is the method which we shall endeavor to\r\npursue.\r\n\r\nJudging from mankind's sense of right, of justice, and of that moral\r\nnobility which each individual's spiritual worthiness seems to demand, a\r\npure democracy is the highest and most perfect form of government. But\r\nsuch a system presupposes a _perfect_ humanity as its basis, a humanity\r\nwhich no portion of the earth has yet attained or is likely to attain\r\nfor many ages to come. Hence the vices as well as the weaknesses of\r\nhuman nature render certain restraints necessary, which are more or\r\nless severe according as the nation is advanced in moral excellence and\r\nintellectual cultivation, and which must gradually disappear as the race\r\nprogresses, giving place to others newer and more appropriate to the\r\nchanging times and conditions of men. Under this view that progress in\r\nthe science of government is alone healthy which keeps exact pace with\r\nthe moral progress of the nation, and tends toward a pure democracy in\r\nexactly the degree in which the people become fitted to appreciate, to\r\nrationally enjoy, and faithfully guard the blessings of perfect liberty.\r\nToo rapid progress leads to political anarchy by stimulating, to a\r\ndegree unsustained by their acquirements and natural ability, the\r\naspirations of the ambitious and the reckless, thereby begetting and\r\nnationalizing a spirit of lawlessness which grasps continually at\r\nunmerited honors, and strives to make all other and higher\r\nconsiderations bend to that of individual advancement and personal\r\nvanity. The truth of this position is seen in the utter failure of all\r\nattempted democratic systems in the past, which may be traced to this\r\ntoo eager haste in the march of human freedom, ending invariably in the\r\nblackest of despotism, as well as from the fact in our own history that\r\nevery era of unusual political corruption and reckless strife for\r\nposition and power, has followed close upon the moral abrogation of some\r\none of those safeguards which the wisdom of our fathers threw around our\r\npolitical system.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, advancement which does not keep pace with the\r\nexpansion of thought, the intellectual development, and consequent\r\ncapacity of the people for self-government, not only offers no\r\nencouragement to effort, but actually discourages all striving, and\r\nblunts the appetites of the searchers for truth. It fossilizes the\r\npeople, retards the march of intellect by its reactionary force, and\r\nrolls backward the wheels of all progress, till the nation becomes a\r\ncommunity of dull, contented plodders, fixed in the ruts of a bygone\r\nage, suffering all its energy and life to rust away, day by day, in\r\ninaction. Such we find to be the case with those nations of the Old\r\nWorld which are still ruled by the effete systems of a feudal age. The\r\ngovernmental policy and the intellectual status of the masses mutually\r\nreact upon each other, effectually neutralizing all progress, whether\r\nmoral or physical.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons that nicely graduated mean between political\r\nrecklessness and national old fogyism, which alone guarantees an\r\nenduring progress, is the object of search to all disinterested\r\npolitical reformers. For only by following such a golden mean, in which\r\npolitical reform shall keep even pace with intellectual and moral\r\nadvancement, can physical and mental progress be made mutually to\r\nsustain each other in the onward march. Yet this mean is extremely\r\ndifficult to find, for though we be guided by all the experience of the\r\npast, and earnestly and sincerely endeavor to profit by the failures as\r\nwell as the successes of those who have gone before us, the paths of\r\nexperiment are so infinite and the combinations of method so boundless,\r\nthat the wisest may easily be led astray. Hence the failures of the\r\nrepublics of the past, however pure the motives and lofty the aims of\r\ntheir founders, may be attributed to a leaning to one side or the other\r\nof this strait and narrow way, which lies so closely concealed amid the\r\nmyriad ramifications of the paths of method. The slightest divergence,\r\nif it be not corrected, like the infinitesimal divergence of two\r\nstraight lines, goes on increasing to all time, till that which was at\r\nfirst imperceptible, becomes at last a boundless ocean of intervening\r\nspace, which no human effort can bridge.\r\n\r\nTo say that we, as a nation, are following closely this golden mean,\r\nthat our wisdom has enabled us to discover that which for so many ages\r\nhas remained hidden from men, were simply egotistical bombast; for it\r\nwere to assert that with us human nature had lost its fallibility and\r\nhuman judgment become unerring. Yet we may safely assert that no system\r\nexists at the present day which so clearly tends toward the attainment\r\nof such a mean, and which contains within itself so many elements of\r\nreform, as our own. For ours is a system of extreme elasticity, a sort\r\nof compensation balance, constructed with a view to the changing climate\r\nof the political world, and capable of accommodating itself to the\r\nshifting condition of men and things. And this not by forcing or leading\r\npublic sentiment, but by yielding to it. Thus while it is founded upon,\r\nand in its workings evolves, so many lofty and ennobling truths, keeping\r\nconstantly before the eyes of the people lessons of purity and moral\r\ndignity, acting as a check upon the visionary and a safeguard to our\r\nliberties, it nevertheless yields quietly to the requirements of the\r\ntimes, and changes according to the necessities of the governed, thus\r\nbeing far from proving a hamper upon our intellectual advancement, but,\r\non the contrary, leaving free and unimpeded the paths of national\r\nprogress. And it is one of the most distinctive features of our\r\ninstitutions that, while few foreign Governments admit of much change\r\nwithout danger of revolution, with us the most thorough reforms may be\r\nconsummated and the greatest changes effected without danger of ruffling\r\nthe waves of our society. For with us change is effected so gradually\r\nand in such exact consonance with the necessities of the people as to be\r\nalmost imperceptible, and to afford no handle to the turbulent and\r\ndesigning revolutionist. The gratification of legitimate ambition is\r\nguaranteed, but our system utterly revolts against the sacrifice of the\r\npublic good to the inordinate cravings of personal ambition or\r\naggrandizement. It is in recognition of this principle of gradual change\r\nthat the politician of to-day hesitates not to avow and to advocate\r\nprinciples which twenty years ago he deemed the height of political\r\nabsurdity. It is not abstract truth that has altered, but the necessary\r\nmodification of theories resulting from the altered condition and\r\nexigencies of society. Were this truth not recognized, no statesman\r\ncould for many years retain his hold upon the popular appreciation, for\r\nhe would at once be branded with inconsistency and incontinently thrown\r\naside as an unsafe counsellor. Hence the hackneyed phrase, 'ahead of the\r\ntimes,' contains within itself a deep and important meaning, since it is\r\nbut a recognition of the fact that relative right and wrong may change\r\nwith the condition of society, and that theories may be beneficial in a\r\nmore advanced stage, which at present would be noxious in the extreme,\r\nand that, in consequence, he is an unsafe leader who grasps at some\r\nexalted good without making sure of the preliminary steps which alone\r\ncan make such blessings durable--who would, at a single leap, place the\r\nnation far ahead in the race of improvement, without first subjecting it\r\nto that trial and discipline which are absolutely necessary to fit it\r\nfor a new sphere. And the extreme disfavor with which such agitators are\r\nregarded by society is an evidence of the safeguard which our\r\ninstitutions contain within themselves, which, by moulding the minds of\r\nthe people to a proper appreciation of the blessings of limited reform\r\nand of the inevitable and necessary stages and degrees of progress, as\r\nwell as of the danger of too sudden and radical change, effectually\r\ncounteract the evil influence of the unmethodical and empirical\r\nreformer.\r\n\r\nOur Government, in its form, can in no sense of the word be called a\r\ndemocracy, however much its workings may tend toward such a result in\r\nsome far-distant future. It is founded in a recognition of the fact that\r\nhowever equal all men may be in their civil and political\r\nrights--however the humblest and most ignorant member of the community\r\nmay be entitled to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,' all\r\nmen are not equal either in intellectual endowments or personal\r\nacquirements, and consequently in their influence upon society, or\r\nequally fitted either to govern or to choose their rulers. Our ancestors\r\nrecognized the fact that the people are not, in the democratic sense of\r\nthe term, fitted to govern themselves. Hence they threw around their\r\nsystem a network of safeguards, and adopted and firmly established\r\nrestraints to counteract this principle of democratic rule, without\r\nwhich our infant republic would soon have fallen to pieces by the force\r\nof its own internal convulsions. And time has proven the wisdom of their\r\ncourse, and we shall do well if we shall reflect long and deeply before\r\nwe essay to remove the least of those restraints, remembering that when\r\nonce the floodgate is opened to change, the eternal tide is set in\r\nmotion, and a precedent established which will prove dangerous if it be\r\nnot carefully restrained within the limits of the necessities of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nTo draw an illustration from the constitution of our body politic: we\r\nfind that the people meet in their primary elections, and choose a\r\nrepresentative to their State legislature, which representative is,\r\n_theoretically_, considerably advanced above his constituents in\r\nintellect, and in knowledge and experience of governmental affairs, and\r\nof the necessities of the nation; by whom, in conjunction with his\r\ncolleagues--and not by the people themselves--a Senator is chosen to\r\nrepresent the State in the national Congress,--which Senator, in his\r\nturn, _theoretically_, is elevated above his constituents, not by the\r\nfortuitous circumstance of birth or of worldly possessions, but in point\r\nof intellect and acquirements, and consequent capacity to govern. Again,\r\nthe people do not directly choose their President, but select certain\r\nelectors, to whose superior wisdom and judgment is intrusted the task of\r\ndetermining who is most fitted to rule the nation for the coming\r\npresidential term. In the single instance of the representative to\r\nCongress do the people choose directly from among themselves. And this\r\nwas adopted as a wise precaution that he, springing directly from their\r\nmidst, owing both his present and future position to their suffrages,\r\nmore closely identified with them in interest, and partaking more nearly\r\nof their modes of thought, and who from the shortness of his term might\r\neasily be displaced if he should prove recreant to his trust, thus\r\nhaving every inducement to correctly represent the sentiments and\r\nprotect the rights of his constituents, might act as a check upon that\r\nother house, which, further removed in every respect from the people,\r\nelected more in accordance with, the aristocratic institutions of the\r\nmother country, and from this exalted and exclusive position, and long\r\nterm of office, more liable to aristocratic influences, might be tempted\r\nto combine for the consolidation of power and the gratification of\r\npersonal ambition, even at the expense of the liberties of the people.\r\n\r\nSuch is the _theory_ of our form of Government; the practical working of\r\nit has altered with the times. While the form of the Constitution is\r\nstill observed to the letter, the spirit is, in a great measure,\r\nabrogated. The people now choose only those representatives whose\r\nsentiments are well known and whose future course can safely be\r\npredicated--only those electors who stand pledged to cast their votes\r\nfor a designated candidate. Yet even now there is nothing to prevent\r\nthose representatives from pursuing a course entirely opposed\r\nto all previous professions, and the known wishes of their\r\nconstituents--nothing to hinder those electors from casting their votes\r\nfor some third party, or combining to place in the executive chair some\r\nunknown person whom the people have not chosen or desired; nothing, if\r\nonly we except the eternal odium and political damnation of public\r\nopinion. Yet it may well be questioned if this same public opinion be\r\nnot after all the safest custodian of the public interest, the most\r\npowerful restraint which could be imposed upon these representatives of\r\nthe people to compel them to a strict performance of their trust.\r\n\r\nYet while, as we have said, a pure democracy is but another term for the\r\nhighest type of civilization, the fact that our form of Government is\r\nnot in any sense of the word a democracy, is no argument against our\r\ncivilization, but rather in its favor. For it is but a recognition of\r\nthe fact that no people on earth is yet fitted for a pure democracy as a\r\nbasis of their institutions: it is an adapting of ourselves to that\r\nstate of things for which we are most fitted, instead of grasping at\r\nsome Utopian scheme of perfection, which the common sense of the nation\r\ntells us is beyond our present capacity. On the other hand, it is a\r\nfrank acknowledgment of our own defects and frailties. As the '[Greek:\r\ngnôthi seauton]' of the heathen philosophers contained within itself the\r\ngerm of all individual philosophy and moral progress, so does it\r\ncomprehend the whole problem of national growth and progress. It is only\r\nthe rudest, most ignorant and barbarous nation that arrogates to itself\r\nperfection: it is that nation only which, conscious of no defects, sees\r\nno necessity for reform, and has no incentive thereto. The consciousness\r\nof defects, both physical and moral, is the life of all reform, and\r\nhence of all progress; while the capacity to detect error in our system\r\nimplies the ability for thorough reform, and the cultivation which\r\nunderlies such knowledge implies the inclination to effect it. The\r\nestablishment of a pure democracy in our midst, in the present state of\r\nhuman advancement, were evidence of a lack of that civilization which\r\ndepends upon earnest thought and a proper appreciation of the present\r\ncapabilities as well as the frailties and imperfections of our humanity.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that while, in the matter of choosing our rulers and\r\nlegislators, our institutions are, in their practical workings,\r\ndemocratic, in form they are by no means so. This cannot long remain so.\r\nAn empty form is of little value, and ere many years the country will\r\neither return to the principles of the olden time--which in the present\r\nadvanced state of public sentiment is not likely--or else sweep away the\r\nform and simplify the whole system. Already the question has begun to be\r\nagitated of submitting the presidential vote directly to the people\r\nwithout intervention of electors. But it may well be doubted whether, in\r\nthe light of the political corruption of to-day, even this be not too\r\ngreat an advance upon the democratic principle for the moral condition\r\nof our people. For many years our country has been the victim of a\r\ndemagoguism, resulting from the working of this very principle, and the\r\nquestion admits of serious discussion whether, instead of abrogating the\r\nform, a return to the _spirit_ of the Constitution, while, at the same\r\ntime, holding strictly amenable those to whom this important choice is\r\nintrusted, would not result in a pure and more statesmanlike\r\nadministration of public affairs. For the elector, being held\r\npolitically responsible for the conduct of the candidate for whom his\r\nvote was cast, and for all the evils resulting from mal-administration,\r\nwould soon learn that to be faithful is not less important than to be\r\nwise, and that his political interest was identified with the well-being\r\nof the country. But it is one of the evils of our rapid progress that\r\nthe past is looked upon with such disfavor as to effectually prevent a\r\nreturn even upon the path of error. In the pride of our civilization the\r\nsimpler theories of the olden time are despised as unworthy of, if not\r\nwholly unfitted for, our present exalted intellectuality. The principle\r\nis ignored that reform may sometimes be effected by retracing the steps\r\nof years. Hence reform in this particular must either adopt the\r\ndangerous experiment of establishing the pure democratic principle, or\r\nelse devise some third plan which shall charm by its novelty at the same\r\ntime that it is founded upon some evident and abiding truth.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connection another great evil becomes evident which is in\r\nitself a fault of our civilization, and not a defect arising from any\r\nfundamental error in our system; an evil which, although always\r\npredominant, has been more active in its workings, more injurious in its\r\neffects during the present war than ever before. It is the spirit of\r\nbitter, uncharitable, and even malicious opposition of the minority to\r\nthe acts and theories of the party in power, forgetting that no great\r\nevil was ever yet effectually counteracted by opposition, which only\r\nfans the flame and makes the fire burn hotter. And while no good can be\r\neffected by such opposition, its direful effect is to divide the\r\ncouncils of the nation, to paralyze the executive arm in all times of\r\ngreat emergency, to render but half effectual every great national\r\nenterprise, to make wavering the national policy, to exasperate\r\npolitical parties more and more against each other, thereby dividing the\r\npeople and weakening the national life and progress, preventing all\r\nconcentration of effort and unanimity of purpose, and--worst of\r\nall--subjecting the country periodically to the violent shock of\r\nopposing systems, according as parties alternate in power, tossing the\r\nship of state in the brief period of a four years' term from one wave of\r\ntheory to another, and opposing one, only to be hurled back as violently\r\nas before. Can it be doubted that such a state of affairs is injurious\r\nto prosperity and either political or social advancement? Were the\r\nresults of every Administration for _good_, there would be less danger;\r\nbut radical evils cannot but result from the bitter partisanship of the\r\nparty in power, and when the scale is reversed and the opposite party\r\ngains the ascendency, the new Administration has scarcely time to\r\ncorrect the errors of its predecessors and to establish its own theory,\r\nere the popular tide ebbs and flows again in the opposite direction, the\r\nins are out and the outs are in, and again the alternation begins.\r\nCertainly party divisions are the life of a republic, from their\r\ntendency to counterbalance each other, and periodically reform abuses,\r\nthus keeping the vessel in the straight course; yet when those divisions\r\nreach the point which we see in our midst to-day, when the avowal of any\r\nprinciple or theory by the one party, however just or beneficial it may\r\nseem, is but the signal for the uncompromising hostility and bitter\r\ndenunciation of the opposition, who seek to make of it a handle to move\r\nthe giant lever of political power, unmindful of the wants and the\r\nurgent necessities of the land--a hostility having for its basis the\r\nsingle fact that the new measures are unfortunately advocated by the\r\nopposite party--then such divisions become not only injurious to the\r\nbody politic, but a foul blot upon the civilization of our day and\r\nnation. This is perhaps putting the question in a strong light; but,\r\nadmitting that we have not yet reached that point, are we not swiftly\r\ndrifting in that direction? Let every candid thinker put the question to\r\nhimself and ponder it deeply, remembering, while looking for the\r\nultimate result, that it was the bitter hostility of opposing factions\r\nwhich ruined the republics of old, and which to-day convulse many that\r\nmight otherwise take rank among the most powerful and progressive\r\nnations of the earth, neutralizing their progress, and holding them\r\nconstantly suspended above the gulf of anarchy and desolation.\r\n\r\nAsk the oppositionist of to-day what he proposes or expects to\r\naccomplish by his hostility to the powers that be, and he will answer\r\nto little purpose. A vague idea is floating in his brain of some 'good\r\ntime coming' for his party, yet he knows very little what or when this\r\ngood time shall be, living on in the hope of some unknown event which\r\nshall reverse the political chessboard. The opposition of to-day is that\r\nof ultra conservatism to radicalism, of which the tendency of the one is\r\ntoward the stationary, that of the other to the rapidly progressive. The\r\nso-called conservative, apparently blind to the result, and looking to a\r\nreturn of the nation to the worn-out theories of the past as the result\r\nof the efforts of his clique, is straining every nerve to paralyze the\r\narm of the Government, and to neutralize the effect of every great\r\nachievement, doing everything in his power to exasperate the large\r\nmajority who are endeavoring to sustain the country in her hour of\r\nperil, seemingly unconscious that in so doing he is not only working\r\nsteadily to defeat his own purpose, but also paving the way for the\r\ndestruction of his faction. For he is endeavoring to drag the country\r\nbackward along the track of years--an object which, as all history\r\nproves, can never be effected with any progressive race; on the\r\ncontrary, such nations have ever owed their ruin to the inevitable\r\ntendency to too rapid advancement. Again, by embittering the feelings of\r\nhis opponents toward himself and his coadjutors, he is effectually\r\npreventing any future reconciliation and coöperation of the divided\r\nfactions, in which only could he hope for success, and raising up a\r\npowerful opposition which will counteract all his future efforts.\r\n\r\nA purer civilization would look at this question of party divisions in a\r\ndifferent light, recognizing it as an institution of Providence, whereby\r\ngreat good may be effected when its benefits are properly appreciated,\r\nand at the same time as a terrible engine of destruction when misused or\r\nnot properly controlled. A purer civilization would recognize and\r\ncandidly acknowledge every element of good in the theories of even the\r\nfiercest opponents, and heartily coöperate in every enterprise whose\r\ntendency was to the national good, working steadily and cheerfully side\r\nby side with rivals and political opposers, and confining its own\r\nopposition strictly to those measures of which the effect is, judged by\r\nits own standard, obviously evil. The _rôle_ of the true reformer is to\r\nglide quietly along with the tide of events, becoming reconciled to\r\nthose measures which, though contrary to his own convictions, are\r\nnevertheless too firmly established to admit of being shaken by his most\r\npowerful efforts; and so while carefully avoiding all unnecessary\r\nantagonisms, all useless stirring up of old bitternesses, to seek so to\r\nidentify himself with the current of events, and so to become part and\r\nparcel of the nation's political life and progress, as to be enabled to\r\nguide into the channel of future good the movement which at first\r\nstarted awry. Even where the vessel has widely diverged from the path of\r\ngood, and follows that which leads to inevitable destruction, it is his\r\npart, instead of wasting his powers in useless struggles to stay her\r\ncourse, to continue on as part and parcel of the precious freight,\r\nseeking opportunity so to guide the erring prow that she shall be\r\ngradually diverted from the evil course toward some distant and advanced\r\npoint of the forsaken track, without being violently dragged back along\r\nher wake. So reaching at last the accustomed course, the good ship will\r\nstill be far advanced upon her way with all the benefits of past\r\nexperience of evil to act as a warning against future digressions from\r\nthe established path of progress. It will be time enough then to point\r\nout the dangers she has escaped, and to argue the absurdity of the olden\r\ntheories which have so seriously interfered with her navigation. By such\r\na course alone will he secure the respect of his opponents, and the\r\nlove and admiration of those who never fail to appreciate sterling\r\nintegrity of purpose, uprightness of motives, and persevering effort in\r\nthe cause of the public good, which is that of the right and the true;\r\nand so only will he quiet and disarm that factious spirit which would\r\notherwise be ever ready to start into a violent opposition at his first\r\neffort in the public cause. Nor must such a course imply time-serving or\r\nsycophancy, or the least concealment of any of the loftiest and noblest\r\nsentiments. In any matter of wrong, where the voice and the concentrated\r\neffort of the true philanthropist can avail to check the nation's\r\ncareer, the voice of the reformer should not fail to be raised in its\r\nmost powerful tones, and all his energy exerted to form such political\r\nand social combinations as shall effect his purpose. But in those stages\r\nwhich are prominent in every nation's progress, when the tide of public\r\nopinion sets full and irresistibly in one direction, sweeping along all\r\nthought and energy in its course, against which it were madness to\r\ncontend until the tempest shall have worn itself out by its own\r\nviolence--more especially when the great questions involve a mere\r\ndifference of opinion as to the results of important measures or the\r\ngeneral tendency of the public policy--then, when opposition would only\r\nserve to arouse a factious or disputatious spirit, his part is to glide\r\nquietly along with the popular movement, acquiescing in and reconciling\r\nhimself to the condition of affairs till such time as the public\r\nsentiment is ripe, and the circumstances fitting for the advocacy and\r\nthe triumph of his own views; meanwhile letting no opportunity escape to\r\nguide the national mind and direct the nation's strivings to such a\r\nconsummation.\r\n\r\nBy such a course only can he effect great results and make durable the\r\nestablishment of his own cherished principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest Christian period of which we have any knowledge, music\r\nhas been employed in the public worship of Christian communities. Its\r\npurposes are, to afford to the devotion of the worshippers a means of\r\nexpression more subtile than even human speech, to increase that\r\ndevotion, and to add additional lustre and solemnity to the outward\r\nservice offered to God. Music has a wonderful power in stirring the\r\nsouls of men, in (so to speak) moving the soil of the heart, that the\r\ngood seed sown by prayer and instruction may find ready entrance, and a\r\nwholesome stimulus to facilitate growth. Now, it is the duty of all\r\nconcerned in the ordering of public worship to see that the music\r\nemployed tends to effect these ends.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1565, the composers of church music were in the habit of\r\nemploying so many and well-known secular melodies, and of rearing upon\r\nthem and upon their own inventions such complicated and unintelligible\r\ncontrapuntal structures, that the church authorities took the matter\r\nseriously in hand, and there is no knowing what might have been the\r\nfinal sentence, had not Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina brought his\r\ngenius to the rescue, and, in sundry compositions, especially in a\r\nsix-part mass, dedicated to Pope Marcellus II., shown that science need\r\nnot exclude clearness, and the possibility of hearing the words sung,\r\nand that the truly inventive artist has no need to seek his themes in\r\ninappropriate spheres.\r\n\r\nIn this day we run little risk of ship-wreck through too great an amount\r\nof science. Scarlatti and Bach would laugh at the efforts styled 'canon'\r\nand 'fugue,' by the aspiring tyros of the present age. Our difficulties\r\narise, not from musical complexity, but from want of suitableness,\r\nadaptation, and characterization, together with the ever-increasing feud\r\nbetween choir and congregational singing. In some churches on the\r\nContinent of Europe, these two latter modes are happily blended, certain\r\nservices or portions of services being left to the choir, and the\r\nremainder being entrusted to the entire congregation. Of course this\r\narrangement is only practicable where there is a certain variety in the\r\nmusical portion of the service. Where the singing of hymns (in the\r\nordinary sense of the phrase) is the only musical form used in the\r\nworship, such differences would be difficult to establish, and a variety\r\nof circumstances must determine which of the two modes, or what\r\ncombination of them, be selected by the congregation. Even where\r\nsplendor is studiously avoided, all desire order and decency in the\r\nconduct of public worship, and such order is painfully violated where\r\ndiscordant sounds or unsuitable selections of music are permitted to\r\ndistract attention and disturb devotion. A ragged carpet, faded fringes,\r\nor dingy window panes, would speedily find a reformer; and surely the\r\nsensitive, defenceless ear has as good a claim to exact order as the\r\nmore voluntary sense of seeing. Better, indeed, no music, than such as\r\nbinds the wings of the soul to earth instead of aiding them to fly\r\nheavenward.\r\n\r\nThe above remarks apply as well to choir as to congregational singing.\r\nLet us suppose now that the mere primal foundation--the mechanical\r\nexecution--be respectably good; that the congregation or choir have been\r\ntaught to sing in tune; that all be harmonious and properly balanced; in\r\nshort, that the auditory nerves be spared any very severe shock--and\r\nwhat then will we ordinarily find? A few good old church melodies,\r\nalmost lost amid a dreary maze of the most recent droning platitudes, or\r\na multitude of worldly acquaintances, negro minstrelsy, ancient love\r\nditties, bar room roundelays, passionate scenes from favorite operas,\r\nwith snatches from instrumental symphonies, concertos, or what not!\r\nMusic, as I have said, is even more subtile in its power of expression\r\nthan speech, and the _new words_, which we may perhaps not even hear,\r\ncan never banish from our minds the _old impressions_ associated with\r\nthe melody. The ears may even be cognizant of the holy sentiments\r\nintended to be conveyed, but the mind's eye will see Sambo, 'First upon\r\nthe heel top, then upon the toe;' the love-lorn dame weeping her false\r\nlover, 'Ah, no, she never blamed him, never;' a roystering set of good\r\nfellows clinking glasses, 'We won't go home till morning;' Lucia\r\nimploring mercy from her hard-hearted brother and selfish suitor; Norma\r\nconfiding her little ones to the keeping of her rival; or perhaps the\r\nfull orchestra at the last 'philharmonic,' supplying the missing notes,\r\nthe beginning and the end of some noble idea, now vainly struggling with\r\nthe difficulties and incongruities of its new position, its maimed\r\nmembers mourning their incompleteness, its tortured spirit longing for\r\nthe body given by the original creator.\r\n\r\nAre we Christians then so poor that we must go begging and stealing\r\nshreds and patches from our more fortunate secular brethren? Has music\r\ndeserted us to dwell solely in the camps of the gypsying world? If so,\r\nthere must be some fault among ourselves, for music is a pure gift from\r\nGod, the only _earthly_ pleasure _promised_ us in heaven. Such\r\nimputation would indeed be a libel upon the almost infinite variety in\r\nthe character of music, and its power of consecration to the very\r\nloftiest ends. Ah! there we fear is the rub. _The character of music!_\r\n_That_ seems to have been forgotten. If all these melodies be adapted to\r\ntheir original aims, can they be suited to new ones so different? Is\r\nthere really in musical form, rhythm, melody, and harmony, no capacity\r\nfor any real expression? Will the same tune do as well for a dance as\r\nfor a prayer, for a moonlight serenade as for an imploration of Divine\r\nmercy?\r\n\r\nNow we have no quarrel with dances; they are innocent and useful in\r\ntheir proper place; human love is a noble gift from the Almighty; we are\r\nnot shocked by a good drinking song, provided the singers be sober;\r\noperas _might_ be made highly instrumental in elevating the tone of\r\nmodern society; and we listen reverentially to the grand creations of\r\nthe masters; but, in addition to all these, we require a music adapted\r\nto signify the relations between ourselves and our Heavenly Father, a\r\nmusic which shall express adoration and love, praise and thanksgiving,\r\ncontrition and humble confidence, which shall implore mercy and waft\r\nprayer to the very gates of the abode of omnipotence. Let such music be\r\nsimple or complex, according to the thought to be rendered or the\r\ncapacity of the executants, let it be for voices, for instruments, or\r\nfor a blending of the two, but let it always be appropriate to the\r\nsubject, and rise with the thought or emotions to be conveyed. Who can\r\ntell what would be the effect of such a church music? What a feeling of\r\nearnestness and sincerity would it not lend to services now often marred\r\nby the shallowness or meretricious glitter of their musical portions?\r\nThe range is wide, the field broad; there is scope for grandeur,\r\nsublimity, power, jubilation, the brightest strains of extatic joy,\r\nmourning, pathos, and the passionate pleading of the human soul severed\r\nfrom its highest good; but all should be in accordance with the dignity\r\nof the personalities represented: on the one hand, the Father and\r\nCreator of all, and on the other, the weak, erring, dependent creature,\r\nmade, nevertheless, in the image of his Creator, and for whom a God\r\nthought it no unworthiness to live, to suffer, and to die.\r\n\r\nHave we any such music? Yes--a little; but that little is not always the\r\nbest known nor the most frequently employed. Are there any composers now\r\ncapable of writing such? Are the composers of genius, or even of talent,\r\nsufficiently earnest and devout? for here we want no shams. Each one\r\nmust answer these questions in accordance with his own experience. The\r\npractical question is, What can be done toward an amelioration of the\r\npresent state of affairs, not confined to this continent, but unhappily\r\nonly too prevalent everywhere? Let the head of the musical department of\r\nevery church service begin by weeding from his repertory all _trash_,\r\nwhether profane or simply stupid and nonsensical. As the number of\r\nmusical creations remaining will not be very large, let him retain for\r\nthe present all that are not positively bad or inane; a few old song\r\nmelodies have, through long usage, lost their original associations, and\r\nhence, though perhaps only imperfectly adapted to devotional purposes,\r\nare yet, on the whole, unobjectionable, and perhaps better than many\r\nmodern inventions.\r\n\r\nAn idea seems prevalent that, to write words for music is an easy task,\r\nand hence the many wounds inflicted upon both music and poetry in their\r\nfrequent union. When a melody is to be composed for a set of verses, the\r\nsame melody to be sung to every verse, the composer naturally examines\r\nthe general tone and form of the poem. These of course determine his\r\nselection of rhythmical character, of time, key, movement, etc. The\r\nmelody is constructed upon the basis of the first verse. To the words\r\nembodying the most important thoughts or feelings, he gives the most\r\nimportant, the emphatic notes, striving to make the sound a faithful and\r\nintensifying medium whereby to convey the sense. _His_ work is then\r\ndone, as the same melody is to be repeated to every verse, and the end\r\nsought will have been attained if the poet have carefully fulfilled\r\n_his_ part. But if he have introduced inequalities into his rhythm, or\r\nhave given unimportant words the places occupied by important ones in\r\nthe first verse, so that an emphatic note will fall upon an 'in,' or a\r\n'the,' or some similar particle, the effect will be bad, and the result\r\nunsatisfactory to all concerned. Old association, or intrinsic beauty of\r\npoetry or melody may, in rare cases, render such blemishes tolerable,\r\nbut the creator of a new work should strive to avoid all blemishes, and\r\nat least _aim_ at perfection.\r\n\r\nIf to each good religious poem we possess, or may hereafter possess (be\r\nthat poem psalm, hymn, sequence, litany, prayer, or form of doctrine),\r\nwe could attach, or find attached, the musical form best adapted to its\r\nhighest expression, what delight would we not experience in its\r\nrendering? Some such poems might, by reason of old associations, or of\r\nespecial adaptation, be always sung to the same melodies, while to\r\nothers might be accorded greater facilities for variety. This only by\r\nway of suggestion. The common practice of selecting melodies for verses,\r\nhap-hazard, with regard only to the 'metre,' of course destroys all\r\npossibility of any especial characterization. If the original 'marriage'\r\nhave been a congenial one, a divorce, with view to a second union,\r\nrarely proves advisable. The same verses may bear another musical\r\nrendering, but the music will very rarely endure adaptation to other\r\nverses.\r\n\r\nBut we left our _maestro di capella_, our head of the music in any\r\nreligious assemblage, weeding his repertory. A difficult task! for, to\r\nsound principles of discrimination he must add the best counsel and the\r\nwidest information he can procure from every competent quarter, not\r\nnarrow nor one-sided, but commensurate with the breadth, the world-wide\r\ndiffusion of the subject.\r\n\r\nWe cannot hope for very speedy progress in this matter, so large a share\r\nof its advancement depending upon general, real and proper musical\r\ncultivation; but if each one interested will think the matter over\r\nseriously and intelligently, and do the little that may lie in his\r\npower, a beginning will have been made, which may in the end lead to\r\ngrand, beautiful, and most precious results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISM.--NO. IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Saviour says of life: 'I have power to lay it down, and power to\r\ntake it again.' We have not such power in our own hands; but our Lord\r\nholds it for us, so that our position is independent of the world, and\r\nof the power of evil, just as His was; and as in His case He did resume\r\nmore than He laid down, so will be given to us by the same Almighty hand\r\nmore than any creature has to surrender for the highest objects of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nSuch doctrine, I may add, is not, in its essence, merely Christian: it\r\nhas been the common sentiment of our race, that one of the highest\r\nprivileges of our being is to sacrifice ourselves, in various modes and\r\ndegrees, for the good of our fellow men; and those who cheerfully do\r\nthis, even if it be in the actual surrender of life, are esteemed\r\nblessed, as they are also placed above others in the ranks of honorable\r\nfame, and held to be secure of the final rewards of a heavenly state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LIFE OF WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT. By GEORGE\r\n     TICKNOR. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1864.\r\n\r\nThere are no discordant voices on either side of the Atlantic with\r\nregard to the literary merits of William H. Prescott. Truth, dignity,\r\nresearch, candor, erudition, chaste and simple elegance, mark all he has\r\never written. His noble powers were in perfect consonance with his noble\r\nsoul. His strict sense of justice shines in all its brilliancy, in his\r\nevident desire to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, of every\r\ncharacter appearing in his conscientious pages. No current of popular\r\nprejudice, however strong, swerves him from his righteous path; no\r\nopportunity for glitter or oratorical display ever misleads him; no\r\nspecial pleading bewilders his readers; no 'might is right' corrupts\r\nthem. His genius is pure, dramatic, and wide; his comprehension of\r\ncharacter acute and clear; his characterization of it, chiselled and\r\nchaste; his ready comprehension of magnanimous deeds evinces his own\r\nmagnanimity; his correct understanding of various creeds and motives of\r\naction proves his own wide Christianity; chivalry was known to him,\r\nbecause he was himself chivalrous; and we have reason to rejoice that\r\nthe field in and through which his noble faculties were developed, was\r\nthe vast and varied one of history. We doubt if any one ever read his\r\nworks without forming a high conception of the character of their\r\nauthor, a conception which will be found fully realized in the excellent\r\nLife given us by George Ticknor. If no one is qualified to write the\r\nLife of a man, save one who has familiarly lived with him, who but Mr.\r\nTicknor could have given us such a biography of Prescott? This\r\nadvantage, together with the similarity of literary tastes, the common\r\nnationality in which their spheres of labor lay, their long friendship,\r\ntheir congeniality of spirit, with the mental qualifications brought by\r\nMr. Ticknor to his task of love, renders his production one of\r\ninestimable value. It is indeed full of sweet, grave charm, and\r\nthoroughly reliable. In these pages we see how it was that no man ever\r\nfound fault with or spoke disparagingly of Prescott--we find the reason\r\nfor it in the perfect balance of his conscientious and kindly character.\r\nHe was in the strictest sense of the words 'lord of himself,' mulcting\r\nhimself with fines and punishments for what he regarded as his\r\nderelictions in his labors, compelling himself to pursue the tasks which\r\nhe had determined to achieve. There is no more interesting record than\r\nthat of his constant struggles to conquer the effects of his growing\r\nblindness, none more inspiriting than the results of his efforts. He\r\nloved and lived among his books; his last request was that his body\r\nshould be placed among them ere it was given to the grave.\r\n\r\nThis delightful biography, which has been received so warmly, both at\r\nhome and abroad, was originally published in an elegant quarto volume,\r\nillustrated in the highest style of art, and an edition was printed\r\nwhich was considered quite too large for the present times. But the\r\nedition was soon exhausted, and Messrs. Ticknor & Fields have now given\r\nus the Life in a 12mo volume, thus placing it within the means of all\r\nreaders. We rejoice at this, because Prescott belongs to us all: while\r\nhis life is dear to the scholar and lover of his kind, it furnishes some\r\nof the most important lessons to Young America. Such a man is a true\r\nnational glory. We close our imperfect notice with a short extract from\r\nMr. Ticknor's preface: 'But if, after all, this memoir should fail to\r\nset the author of the 'Ferdinand and Isabella' before those who had not\r\nthe happiness to know him personally, as a man whose life for more than\r\nforty years was one of almost constant struggle--of an almost constant\r\nsacrifice to duty, of the present to the future--it will have failed to\r\nteach its true lesson, or to present my friend to others as he stood\r\nbefore the very few who knew him as he was.\r\n\r\n  \"Virtue could see to do what virtue would\r\n  By her own radiant light, though sun and moon\r\n  Were in the flat sea sunk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     SERMONS, Preached at Trinity Chapel, Brighton, by the late\r\n     Rev. FREDERICK W. ROBERTSON, M. A., the Incumbent. Fifth\r\n     Series. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1864. For sale by D. Appleton &\r\n     Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThe sermons of Mr. Robertson are very popular in England. They are\r\nremarkable for clearness and excellence of style, and earnestness of\r\npurpose. Many noble lessons are to be drawn from them, even by those who\r\ndiffer with the author on sundry points of doctrine. We wish, however,\r\nfor the credit of theological exactness, that he had been somewhat more\r\ncareful in stating the views of his adversaries. Referring to the use of\r\nindulgences, he says: 'The Romish Church permits crime for certain\r\nconsiderations.' The Roman Catholic doctrine as actually held is, that\r\nan indulgence is a remission of a portion of the earthly or purgatorial\r\npunishment due to any sin, after it has been duly repented of,\r\nconfessed, abandoned, and restitution made so far as possible. It can\r\nconsequently never mean a pardon for sins to come, as is often\r\nignorantly supposed, and is apparently a reminiscence of the ancient\r\npractice of canonical penances inflicted on penitents.\r\n\r\nJust now, when the entire scientific world is being convulsed by the\r\nattempted substitution of some inflexible law for a personal God with a\r\nliving _will_, it is not strange that some phase of the same idea should\r\ncreep into even the purest theology, and that in Mr. Robertson's theory\r\nof prayer we should find traces of the rigidity characterizing 'ultra\r\npredestinarian' as well as 'development' schemes of creation.\r\n\r\nWe cannot better conclude than by quoting the following passage from the\r\nsermon on 'Selfishness,' a home thrust to nearly all of us: 'It is\r\npossible to have sublime feelings, great passions, even great sympathies\r\nwith the race, and yet not to love man. To feel mightily is one thing,\r\nto live truly and charitably another. Sin may be felt at the core, and\r\nyet not be cast out. Brethren, beware. See how a man may be going on\r\nuttering fine words, orthodox truths, and yet be rotten at the heart.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     WOMAN AND HER ERA. By ELIZA W. FARNHAM. 'Every\r\n     book of knowledge known to Oosana or Vreehaspatec, is by nature\r\n     implanted in the understandings of women.'--_Vishnu Sarma._ In 2\r\n     volumes. New York: A. J. Davis & Co., 274 Canal street.\r\n\r\nThis is a book which will excite violent criticism, and call forth\r\nopposition, as all new statements invariably do. Its author says it is\r\ntwenty-two years since its truths took possession of her mind, and that\r\nthey are as firmly grounded among the eternal truths for her, as are the\r\nribbed strata of the rocks, or the hollows of the everlasting sea. Mrs.\r\nFarnham attempts to prove the superiority of woman in all, save the\r\nexternal world of the senses, the material structure of the work-a-day\r\nworld. She regards the knowledge and acceptance of this fact as of vital\r\nimportance to the order of society, the happiness of man, the\r\ndevelopment of his being, and the improvement of the human race. Her\r\nargument is not the sentimental one so often profaned in our midst. She\r\ntraces the proofs of her assertions to the most profound sources,\r\npresents them in her acute analyses and philosophical arguments, and\r\ndraws practical applications from them. She is sincere in her\r\nconvictions, and able in her arguments; she sets up a high standard of\r\nwomanly excellence for _noblesse oblige_, and teaches faith in God and\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to follow Mrs. Farnham's argument: it would require a\r\nreview rather than a cursory notice. She shows that there is an\r\nintuitive recognition of the superiority of woman in the universal\r\nsentiments of humanity, that man's love when pure assumes the superior\r\nqualities of the woman loved, that he looks to her to aid him in his\r\naspirations for a better life than he has lived before; but woman never\r\nproposes to herself a reform from any gross or vicious habit by reason\r\nof her first lesson in love. The reverse is more apt to be the case.\r\n\r\nIn man the love of power is an infernal passion, because its root is\r\nself love; in woman, it is a divine impulse, connected only with the\r\nlove of noble uses. Our author is no advocate for women's rights, there\r\nbeing two orders of human capacities, masculine and feminine. Man is\r\nmaster of the outer world: woman cannot cope with him there; her sphere\r\nis freer, deeper, higher, and of more importance to the future destinies\r\nof the race. This book will be sharply criticized by the clergy, pure\r\nand good men, but always hard on woman, although she keeps the lamp of\r\nfaith trimmed and burning in the churches, believing her always a mere\r\nsubordinate of man, and utter submission to him her chief virtue. The\r\nlady-killers and men of pleasure will scorn it, for it exposes many of\r\ntheir claims and vices, which they labor to hide with glittering veils\r\nof dazzling sophisms. Will our women read it? We think not. Mrs. Farnham\r\ntreats of difficult subjects, with the freedom and innocence of an\r\nanatomist; but will our fair and shrinking students enter the dissecting\r\nroom, even to learn some of the secrets of life?\r\n\r\nWe differ from Mrs. Farnham in many important particulars. We think she\r\nhas made some errors fatal to the well-being of her system. But she has\r\nentered upon a new path, one in which there are indeed _lions upon the\r\nway_; she has advanced freely and boldly through its dangers; her aims\r\nhave been generous and sincere; she has given the mature a suggestive\r\nand thoughtful book; and shall we not greet her when she returns with\r\nher hard-won trophies from the mystical land of earth's fair Psyches?\r\n\r\n  'O woman! lovely woman! nature made thee\r\n  To temper man; we had been brutes without you!\r\n  Angels are painted fair to look like you;\r\n  There's in you all that we believe of heaven!'\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE HOLY AND PROFANE STATES. By THOMAS FULLER.\r\n     With some Account of the Author and his Writings. Boston: Little,\r\n     Brown & Co. For sale by D. Appleton & Co.\r\n\r\nA book from quaint old Fuller will always find its audience ready to\r\nreceive it. It is only by contrasting his works with those of his\r\ncontemporaries that we can do him full justice. He was an eminent\r\nhistorian and divine of the Church of England, in the stormy times of\r\nCharles I. and the Commonwealth. He made his first appearance as an\r\nauthor in 1631, in a poem entitled 'David's hainous Sin, heartie\r\nRepentance, and heavie Punishment.' He was much beloved in his day,\r\nfollowing faithfully as chaplain the fortunes of the royal army. As a\r\nwriter, every subject is alike to him; if dull, he enlivens it;\r\nagreeable, he improves it; deep, he enlightens it; and if tough,\r\ngrapples bravely with it. As he was unwilling to go all lengths with\r\neither party, he was abused by both. The storms which convulsed the\r\nGovernment, had only the effect of throwing him upon his own resources,\r\nand he thus produced the various works which won the admiration of his\r\ncontemporaries, and through which he still receives the gratitude of\r\nposterity, keeping his memory still green in our souls. The table of\r\ncontents in the present volume is very varied, the chapters are short,\r\nand treat of familiar and home-like topics.\r\n\r\n\r\n     FAMILIAR QUOTATIONS: Being an Attempt to Trace to their\r\n     Sources Passages and Phrases in Common Use, chiefly from English\r\n     Authors. By JOHN BARTLETT. Fourth edition. Boston: Little,\r\n     Brown & Co. 1864.\r\n\r\nThe compiler of this book says the favor shown to former editions has\r\nencouraged him to go on with the work and make it still more worthy. The\r\nobject has been to present the general reader with such quotations as he\r\nwould readily recognize as old friends. The index of authors is a wide\r\none, placing before us at a glance many of the names treasured in our\r\nmemories; the index of subjects, alphabetically arranged, covers seventy\r\nclosely printed pages, and is exceedingly well ordered. We consider such\r\nbooks as of great value, planting pregnant thoughts in the soul, and\r\naffording rich illustrations. We cheerfully commend Mr. Bartlett's\r\nexcerpts. They are well chosen, and the binding, paper, and print of the\r\nbook are admirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ARNOLD AND ANDRÉ. An Historical Drama. By GEORGE\r\n     CALVERT, author of 'Scenes and Thoughts in Europe,' and 'The\r\n     Gentleman.' Boston: Little, Brown & Co. 1864.\r\n\r\nMr. Calvert says, 'an historical drama being the incarnation--through\r\nthe most compact and brilliant literary form--of the spirit of a\r\nnational epoch, the dramatic author, in adopting historic personages and\r\nevents, is bound to subordinate himself with conscientious faithfulness\r\nto the actuality he attempts to reproduce. His task is, by help of\r\nimaginative power, to give to important conjunctures, and to the\r\nindividuals that rule them, a more vivid embodiment than can be given on\r\nthe literal page of history--not to transform, but to elevate and\r\nanimate an enacted reality, and, by injecting it with poetic rays, to\r\nmake it throw out a light whereby its features shall be more visible.' A\r\njust theory and well stated; and in 'Arnold and André,' our author has\r\nsubordinated himself with conscientious faithfulness to historic truth,\r\nand is always correct and dignified; but the imaginative gift of deep\r\ninsight is wanting, and the fire of genius kindles not the heart of the\r\nstately record to reveal its hidden power and pathos.\r\n\r\n\r\n     HISTORY OF THE ROMANS UNDER THE EMPIRE. By CHARLES\r\n     MERIVALE, B.D., late Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.\r\n     From the fourth London edition. With a copious Analytical Index.\r\n     Vol. III. New York: D. Appleton & Co., Broadway.\r\n\r\nMerivale's third volume commences with the proceedings upon the death of\r\nCæsar, and concludes with the Imperial Administration, thus containing\r\none of the most interesting and important periods of Roman history.\r\nAntonius, Octavius, Cicero, Cleopatra, Octavia, Cæsarion, Herod,\r\nAntipater, Mariamne, Agrippa, etc., make part of the brilliant array\r\nrekindled before us. We have no doubt that the readers of ancient\r\nhistory will gladly avail themselves of the opportunity to possess\r\nthemselves of Merivale's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SELECTIONS FROM THE WORKS OF JEREMY TAYLOR. With some\r\n     Account of the Author and his Writings. Boston: Little, Brown & Co.\r\n     1864.\r\n\r\nBishop Heber says, when speaking of the three great English divines,\r\n'Hooker is the object of our reverence. Barrow of our admiration, and\r\nJeremy Taylor of our love.' Taylor was a man of devout and glowing soul,\r\nof imaginative genius, so that, whatever may have been the prejudices of\r\nhis times, the restrictions of his creed, his thoughts are still fresh\r\nand captivating, his quaint pages full of interest. He loved his Master,\r\nand his love glows through much of his writing.\r\n\r\nHe was an accomplished scholar, and in spite of his contests with\r\n'Papists,' a kindhearted man. His biographer says: 'To sum up all in a\r\nfew words, this great prelate had the good humor of a gentleman, the\r\neloquence of an orator, the fancy of a poet, the acuteness of a\r\nschoolman, the profoundness of a philosopher, the wisdom of a\r\nchancellor, the sagacity of a prophet, the reason of an angel, and the\r\npiety of a saint, devotion enough for a cloister, learning enough for a\r\nuniversity, and wit enough for a college of virtuosi.'\r\n\r\nThese selections are judiciously made, and will commend themselves to\r\nall readers of taste. It is a good sign to see Jeremy Taylor and old\r\nFuller reappearing among us.\r\n\r\n\r\n     POEMS. By FREDERICK GODDARD TUCKERMAN. Boston:\r\n     Ticknor & Fields. 1864.\r\n\r\nMr. Tuckerman has given us a volume of philosophically thought, tenderly\r\nand purely felt, and musically rhythmed poems. No roughness disfigures,\r\nno sensualism blights, no straining for effect chills, no meretricious\r\nornament destroys them. The ideas are grave and tender, the diction\r\nscholarly, and if the fire and passion of genius flame not through them,\r\nthey seem to have been the natural growth of a heart\r\n\r\n          'Hearing oftentimes\r\n  The still sad music of humanity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     THOUGHTS ON PERSONAL RELIGION. Being a Treatise on the\r\n     Christian Life, in its two Chief Elements, Devotion and Practice.\r\n     By EDWARD MEYRICK GOULBURN, D. D., Prebendary of St.\r\n     Paul's, Chaplain to the Bishop of Oxford, and one of her Majesty's\r\n     Chaplains in Ordinary. First American, from the fifth London\r\n     edition. With a Prefatory Note, by George H. Houghton, D.D., Rector\r\n     of the Church of the Transfiguration, in the City of New York. New\r\n     York: D. Appleton & Co., 443 and 445 Broadway. 1864.\r\n\r\nThis is, in the main, an excellent work on practical religion. From its\r\nfervent spirit and sound common sense, it came very near being such a\r\none as we could have recommended for the perusal and attentive study of\r\nthe great body of Christians in our country. Unfortunately, the author,\r\nby sundry flings at other Christian communities, and by the use of\r\nnicknames, as Quaker, Romanist, Dissenter, etc., in speaking of them,\r\nhas restricted its usefulness chiefly to the members of his own\r\ncommunion, the Protestant Episcopal Church. To such, it will doubtless\r\nprove highly satisfactory and beneficial. A very few omissions would\r\nhave procured for it the wide range of acceptance and power of working\r\ngood to which its intrinsic excellence would then have entitled it. When\r\nwill our religious writers learn that the great battle now is not among\r\nthe various sections of the Christian camp, but with an outside enemy,\r\nindefatigable, learned, plausible, and every day gaining ground? Who can\r\ntell but that a careful examination of, and more accurate acquaintance\r\nwith the principles and practice of divisions serving under the same\r\ngreat Captain, might dissipate many a prejudice, and reconcile many a\r\ndifficulty? One of the first requisites is, that all learn _to know_ and\r\n_to speak_ the truth about one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE SPIRIT OF THE FAIR. 1864. 'None but the brave deserve\r\n     the Fair.'

Hoppin, Henry\r\n     Sedgwick, Frederick Sheldon, Charles K. Tuckerman. New York: John\r\n     F. Trow, Publisher, 50 Greene street.\r\n\r\nIn recommending to our readers this neatly bound volume of the daily\r\nproduct of the great 'Metropolitan Fair,' we cannot do better than\r\nextract the little introductory notice of the publisher, who says: 'By\r\nthe request of many patrons of the 'Spirit of the Fair,' the publisher\r\npurchased the stereotype plates and copyrights of the paper, for the\r\npurpose of supplying bound copies for permanent preservation. The\r\ntalented ladies and gentlemen who conducted the 'Spirit of the Fair,'\r\nduring its brief and brilliant career, have, by their well-directed\r\nefforts, made a volume worthy of preservation, both from its high\r\nliterary excellence, and from the recollections with which it is\r\nassociated. Its pages are illuminated with the writings of the most\r\ndistinguished authors. Every article in the paper first saw the light of\r\nprint in the 'Spirit of the Fair.' Poets, Historians, Statesmen,\r\nNovelists, and Essayists furnished contributions prepared expressly for\r\nits columns; and their efforts in behalf of the noble charity which the\r\npaper represented, should alone entitle the volume to be cherished as a\r\nmost valued memento and heirloom.\r\n\r\n'The publisher, therefore, presents this volume to the public, in the\r\nhope that it will not only gratify the reader of the present, but that\r\nit will assist to preserve the 'Spirit of the Fair' for the reader of\r\nthe future.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE LITTLE REBEL. Boston: J. E. Tilton & Co. 1864. For\r\n     sale by Hurd & Houghton, New York.\r\n\r\nA very interesting book for the little ones. It presents vivid pictures\r\nof New England life, and is fragrant and dewy with fresh breezes from\r\nthe maple bush, the hillside, and the pasture lands. The style is\r\nexcellent, and the matter as sprightly and entertaining as it is simply\r\nnatural and morally improving.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE POET, AND OTHER POEMS. By ACHSA W. SPRAGUE.\r\n     Boston: William White & Co., 158 Washington street. For sale by A.\r\n     J. Davis, New York.\r\n\r\n'Miss Sprague was chiefly known to the world as a trance lecturer under\r\nwhat claimed to be spirit influence. Although speaking in the interest\r\nof a faith generally unpopular, and involved in no slight degree in\r\ncrudities, extravagance, and quackery, she was herself neither fool nor\r\nfanatic. She was a true child of nature, direct and simple in her\r\nmanners, and impatient of the artificiality and formal etiquette of\r\nfashionable society.' These poems are characterized by great case of\r\nstyle, flowing rhythm, earnestness in the cause of philanthropy, and\r\nfrequently contain high moral lessons. But it is somewhat strange that\r\nthe poems of trance writers and speakers, so often marked by exquisite,\r\nvaried, and delicate chimes of ringing rhythm, of brilliant words, of\r\nsparkling poetic dust blown from the pages of great writers, and\r\ndrifting through the world, should so seldom give us those great granite\r\nblocks of originality, which must constitute the enduring base for the\r\nnew era therein announced. Is there nothing new in the world beyond the\r\ngrave which they deem open to their vision? We ask this in no spirit of\r\ncensure or cavil, for we have no prejudice against the school of\r\nspiritualistic literature, save where it militates against the faith in\r\nour Redeemer.\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOLUME VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A Castle in the Air.
