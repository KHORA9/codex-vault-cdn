B.\r\n\r\nREPORTER TO THE COMMITTEE,\r\n\r\nAND ORNAMENTED WITH SHARP CUTS DRAWN ON THE SPOT\r\n\r\nBy G. K. C.\r\n\r\nDUCKWORTH & CO.,\r\n\r\n3 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT GARDEN, W.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL RECORD OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE GREAT INQUIRY,\r\n\r\nWITH ITS CONCLUSIONS, MAJORITY AND MINORITY REPORT, ETC.\r\n\r\n_Printed by Order of the Committee._\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Inquiring Body, or Commission of Inquest, has been formed of a\r\nsection of the Cabinet, with power to add to their number.\r\n\r\nOf this power they have availed themselves sparingly and judiciously,\r\nas the following list will show:\r\n\r\n  THE LORD PRIVY SEAL.\r\n  MR. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, M.P.\r\n  THE PRIME MINISTER.\r\n  HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH.\r\n  HIS EXCELLENCY THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE.\r\n  MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.\r\n  MR. GERALD BALFOUR.\r\n  THE COLONIAL SECRETARY.\r\n  THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR THE COLONIES.\r\n  HIS MAJESTY’S SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\r\n  THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n          and\r\n  MR. BALFOUR himself.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen, your Committee, having been sworn, in the Scotch\r\nmanner, “that they would well and truly bolt out the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, such as would profit and serve this\r\nOur realm of England, the Channel Islands, and all Our dominions beyond\r\nthe seas, so help them God,” the proceedings opened by a prayer that\r\nthe wisdom of this world might be turned into foolishness, and that the\r\nfalse pride of Reason might be humbled, and the insolence of\r\nphilosophers confounded.\r\n\r\nUpon which was called Mr. BAINES, of Middlesbrough, a\r\ngentlemanly-looking person, who deposed that:\r\n\r\nThe country was upon the verge of ruin. In the iron trade, competition\r\nwith America, and latterly with Belgium and Germany, had been felt very\r\nseverely. Mrs. Baines and self had passed through many anxious moments\r\nsince 1892. The extravagance of their eldest son William at the\r\nUniversity, which, under normal circumstances, would have caused them\r\nno uneasiness, had driven them almost distracted and had led to a most\r\nregrettable coolness between parent and child. For the last eight years\r\nhe had found it impossible to spend more than one month, or at the most\r\nsix weeks, in London during the season, and that in a hired house. In\r\nthe worst year, 1897, Mrs. Baines had been compelled to take lodgings.\r\nIt was only by an unstinted and harassing attention to detail that the\r\nbusiness had been kept going. His hair, which twenty years ago had been\r\nof a rich nut-brown colour, was now quite grey, and growing very thin\r\nand patchy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_A gentlemanly-looking person._”]\r\n\r\nMr. GERALD BALFOUR, who had followed the business side of the argument\r\nvery closely, here asked what remedy Mr. Baines proposed for this state\r\nof things?\r\n\r\nMr. BAINES replied that there seemed to be but two courses to follow.\r\nThe best way would be for the Government to pay him quarterly not less\r\nthan 25_s._ for every ton of pig-iron he might manufacture. If, for\r\nparty reasons, it was impossible to grant him such a sum, the second\r\ncourse would be to impose a duty on all other iron which would raise\r\nhis, Mr. Baines’, iron by a similar amount.\r\n\r\nAsked by Mr. CHAMBERLAIN whether it was his opinion that the wages of\r\nhis hands would rise under such a system, Mr. Baines looked a trifle\r\npuzzled, and confessed that he did not understand the drift of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_smiling pleasantly_): “I will put my question in\r\nanother form. Would you offer your employés a portion of the profit so\r\nacquired?”\r\n\r\nMr. BAINES (_bewildered_): “Why should I?”\r\n\r\nThe POSTMASTER-GENERAL: “Let me tackle him, father....” (_To Mr.\r\nBaines_): “I take it all your men have a vote?”\r\n\r\nMr. BAINES: “Yes, all except Ben Gailey, who did time for ghurling.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_What is ghurling?_”]\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR (_with great interest_): “What is ghurling?”\r\n\r\nThe POSTMASTER-GENERAL (_hurriedly_): “That’s all right. Well, now, the\r\nquestion is this: if we give you £1 down for every ton of pig iron you\r\nshove on the market, and we make it a condition that you pay at least\r\n5_s._ of it in extra wages, will you clinch?”\r\n\r\nMr. BAINES: “Like a nut!”\r\n\r\nThe witness, who was complimented by Lord Lansdowne on the manly and\r\nstraightforward way in which he had given his evidence, then stood\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nMr. HARRY GIBBS, farmer of Goudhurst, questioned upon Hops, said that\r\nW’ops were in a turrible bad way, and all. He knew his own mind. He was\r\na practical man. He said: “Let the Government prohibit all foreign\r\nW’ops, Sussex and all, and let brewers have a law, and let ’un buy\r\nKentish W’ops. There was old Sir Charles Gorle, there was, member of\r\nParliament and all, and he knew for certain as that old man in his\r\nbrewery never bought none but Sussex, and he’d have a law....”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_sternly_): “Stand down.”\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_loudly_): “Ar! I’m a plain man and not to be druv, and I tell\r\nyou....”\r\n\r\nLord LANSDOWNE: “Stand down, sir!”\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_more loudly_): “I tell you if you let these dang Sussex\r\nW’ops....”\r\n\r\nThe whole Committee here rose and in chorus ordered the witness to\r\nstand down.\r\n\r\nWITNESS: “You hear me! These Sussex W’ops, they have the vly; they\r\naren’t....”\r\n\r\nThe police here removed the witness, who struggled violently, shaking\r\nhis fist over his shoulder, and shouting:\r\n\r\n“Ar, it’s stan’ down naow!... You wait till t’election.... Ar. You see\r\nwhich way I voät then.... Ar!”\r\n\r\nSimilar cries were heard in the passage without, until his voice was\r\nlost in the distance, or was perhaps gagged by the police.\r\n\r\nThis unpleasant scene was succeeded by the testimony of a very\r\ndifferent witness, Lord RENTON, who was of opinion that the good money\r\nshould be kept in the country.... He, for his part, could see no kind\r\nof reason why we should buy from abroad what we could very well make\r\nfor ourselves.... He was interested in butter.... He believed that the\r\npreservation of eggs was only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Mr. Balfour observing that the Committee had sat for\r\nfull twenty minutes, the inquiry was adjourned. Mr. Chamberlain went\r\nout with Lord Renton, and partook of his motor-car, as he was stopping\r\nwith His Lordship from Saturday to Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRAIN OF GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the second weekly meeting of the Cabinet Committee of Inquiry into\r\nour Fiscal System, Lord HALSBURY joined the Committee.\r\n\r\nMr. MANNING, of East Ham, whose striking pamphlets, _What We Really\r\nEat_ and _Not by Bread Alone_, have brought him well-deserved fame, was\r\nasked to join, but declined on the ground of party loyalty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_Mr. Manning, of East Ham._”]\r\n\r\nThe DUKE OF SUTHERLAND, who had also been invited to sit, had\r\ninstructed his private secretary to write to the same effect,\r\nexpressing an ardent sympathy with the objects of the Committee, but\r\nrecalling the great part he had played in Liberal politics for many\r\nyears, and pointing out that he could better serve the cause by\r\nremaining attached to a party which he hoped to leaven by his example\r\nand oratory.\r\n\r\nMr. BENJAMIN KIDD, the first witness, deposed on oath that he was a\r\nphilosopher. He begged leave to give his testimony in metaphysical\r\nlanguage, as he could speak no other. After some consultation leave was\r\ngranted, and the sworn interpreter at Scotland Yard was summoned by\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_The Official Interpreter._”]\r\n\r\nThus relieved, the witness swore that the synthesis of an\r\nagglomeration, real or imaginary--in plain words, of all thinkable\r\ncongeries--was informed by an appreciation of its organic or inorganic\r\ncharacter. He was far from saying that the organic and inorganic were\r\nseparated by any hard and fast line, but he did maintain----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: I think that point is clear.\r\n\r\nMr. BENJAMIN KIDD, continuing, deposed that a political entity was\r\nemphatically of the former kind as to its consciousness. And without\r\nconsciousness where were they? He then maintained it demonstrable\r\nbeyond argument that all truisms, including altruism, lead to one\r\ncentral principle, namely, that in all inequalities differences\r\nappeared, for if they did not, then where were they? Applying this\r\nprimordial and cosmic truth to the particular region of international\r\nexchange, he could but conclude that _all material increment_ of res\r\nmercatoriæ _must and did connote diminution of_ eorundem facilitas _and\r\nvice versâ_.\r\n\r\nThe witness here sat down, and the interpreter, who had been taking\r\nnotes, declared in a loud voice that Mr. Kidd’s speech meant, in\r\nEnglish, that the excess of imports was paid for in gold. (_Murmurs of\r\napplause._)\r\n\r\nThe LORD CHANCELLOR (_emphatically_): I always said it!\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_triumphantly to Mr. Balfour_): What about Seddon\r\n_now_?\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR (_in some confusion_): I never said anything against\r\nSeddon, besides which, who knows but what Kidd--\r\n\r\n_Here Mr. Kidd was observed to break down and sob bitterly; willing\r\nhands supported him to the Carlton, where first aid to the wounded was\r\nskilfully rendered by Doctor Sir Conan Doyle, V.C.... On recovering\r\nconsciousness he attributed his agony to severance from the Great\r\nLiberal Party, of which he had so long been the most brilliant\r\nornament. The distinguished physician, who had himself suffered such\r\npangs, soothed him as best he could, and conveyed the news to the\r\nCommittee, who were profoundly moved._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_solemnly_): If this man dies, the Opposition will\r\nhave a heavy weight upon its soul.\r\n\r\n[_The Committee here murmured their approval, and the Inquiry\r\nproceeded._]\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR: It is now our task, I think, to find by what issue the\r\ngold escapes, and to stop the leak.\r\n\r\nMr. CHARLES GRIGGS (_expert_) deposed: That such a gold export would\r\nrequire fifty-six vessels, each 500 ft. long by 45 broad with a draught\r\nof 27 ft.\r\n\r\nPETER GARRY (_Private Detective in the pay of the Birmingham Caucus_):\r\n“I have watched all the ports, and can swear that no such vessel, let\r\nalone fifty-six, has cleared with gold since July, 1902.”\r\n\r\nIn view of the difficulties raised by this witness, it was determined\r\nto call further testimony:\r\n\r\nPETER CALE (_porter_) deposed to hauling great sacks of something hard\r\nand heavy on to the passenger boats at Dover last April. These sacks\r\nmight very well have contained gold. Cross-examined: They might have\r\ncontained almost anything else. They had no smell.\r\n\r\nMARTHA QUINN (_labourer’s wife_) swore that she had often heard people,\r\nespecially her husband’s master, say that a power of money went abroad\r\nto pay for foreign kickshaws. She herself had paid a considerable sum\r\nlast year for Norwegian matches, American tobacco, German sausage,\r\nforeign tea, and all. Cross-examined as to where the tea came from, she\r\nsaid, after some hesitation, that she thought it came from Lipton.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_sternly_): That is within this Empire.\r\n\r\nMARTHA QUINN (_curtseying_) begged the pardon of the Court. She was\r\nordered to stand down.\r\n\r\nMr. THOMAS HEPTON, draper, of Regent Street, W., swore that he sold in\r\nthe past year some 50,000 or 60,000 cases of foreign woven stuffs,\r\nevery one of which had to be paid for. The profit only remained in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nCross-examined: He did not himself pay for the goods in gold, but he\r\ngave a cheque upon his bankers, who doubtless sent the money abroad in\r\npacking cases, and all that went to the ---- foreigner.\r\n\r\nLord LANSDOWNE: Moderate your language.\r\n\r\nMr. HEPTON: I am sorry, my lord, but if you had sent case after case of\r\nsolid gold away to France week after week for ten years, you would feel\r\nas I do.\r\n\r\nMr. HAYWOOD of Bicester, Mr. CALM of Stroud, Mr. MERRY of Lincoln, Mr.\r\nBOWSE of Lichfield, Mr. HOPPER of Lancaster, Mr. GRAPE of Shrewsbury,\r\n&c., bank managers, swore that their business consisted almost wholly\r\nof handing out large masses of bullion daily to offensive people, many\r\nof whom had the appearance of foreigners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_With the appearance of foreigners_”]\r\n\r\nLord HALSBURY: All this is hearsay evidence, and not worth the paper it\r\nis written on.\r\n\r\nDuring a short altercation between the legal and non-legal members of\r\nthe Committee, a person at the back of the room leapt to his feet and\r\ndemanded to be heard. He was permitted to speak, and deposed:\r\n\r\nThat he had been gathering statistics in the employment of a politician\r\nwhose name he must conceal.\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR: I am afraid we must have that name.\r\n\r\nWITNESS: May I send it up on a piece of paper?\r\n\r\nLord HALSBURY: Is he a peer?\r\n\r\nWITNESS: No, my lord.\r\n\r\nLord HALSBURY: Well, is he a person of importance?\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_eagerly_): Oh! yes, my lord.\r\n\r\nLord HALSBURY (_after consulting his colleagues_): We do not think his\r\nname material. Proceed.\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_in an emphatic manner_): The facts I have to produce are\r\nsimple. They are well known. It is their meaning which has escaped the\r\npublic. When the meaning is grasped it will amply account for our great\r\nannual loss of gold.\r\n\r\n(_Here the Committee betrayed an interest bordering on frenzy, leaning\r\nforward and fixing burning eyes on the witness, who continued_:)\r\n\r\n“The number of passenger tickets taken at the ports of this country is\r\nover 12 millions annually. (_Sensation._) Ships’ crews (excluding\r\ncoasters), fishermen running across to the continent, fugitive\r\ncriminals, and King’s messengers bring the number up to 18 millions.\r\n(_Sensation._) Not one of these 18 millions leaves without a sum of\r\nmoney ... many carry away immense sums ... our office can prove that\r\nthe very clergy in their annual excursions will carry 20, 30, nay, 100\r\npounds a family. (_Sensation._) How many return with any money at all?\r\n(_Here the speaker made a dramatic pause._) ... I have little more to\r\nadd. The total sum so lost by innumerable outlets amounts certainly to\r\n200, possibly to 230, million pounds. _England is a sieve._”\r\n\r\nWitness here left the box, and the Committee rose in a state of\r\nseething excitement, several of the more commonplace members repeating\r\nmechanically, “_A sieve!_” “_A regular sieve!_” “_Poor old England is a\r\nsieve!_”\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain looked radiant in a black frock coat and top hat, with\r\nboots to match, and a flower of some kind in his buttonhole, while Mr.\r\nBalfour was quite cheerful and vivacious. As the Court rose the opinion\r\nwas freely expressed that the day’s work has given the Cause a great\r\nlift forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third meeting of the Grand Committee of Inquest, commissioned under\r\nthe Privy Seal of Great Britain and Ireland and the Dominions beyond\r\nthe Seas, met at Downing Street this week to further explore--we mean,\r\nto explore further--the Fiscal Conditions of this Realm of England.\r\n\r\nThe late arrival of the members of the Committee gave rise to some\r\nanxious talk in the passage which corresponds to the Lobby of the House\r\nin Downing Street. The wildest rumours were afloat. Some said that Mr.\r\nChamberlain had resigned; others that he had committed suicide. The\r\nmore sober would have it that the inquest was indefinitely postponed,\r\nand that the whole scheme for protecting or not protecting native\r\nindustries, or food, or what-not, as the Inquiry might or might not\r\nhave shown to be necessary, or unnecessary, or either, was to be\r\ndropped. Among the adherents of the latter (or former) opinion were\r\nseveral journalists, a bishop, four diplomats, and an economist.\r\n\r\nAll doubts were set at rest by the arrival at 3.35 or thereabouts of\r\nthe first members of the Committee and two members of the Birmingham\r\n“gang.” Three-quarters of an hour later Mr. Balfour was towed up in his\r\nmotor-car, and the Court opened.\r\n\r\nThe business before the Court this morning was to receive the testimony\r\nof some fifty-eight witnesses on the technical details of our chief\r\nindustries, and to hear their views on special points; especially on\r\nthe inroads made by foreign competition in matters of construction.\r\n\r\nA definition having been asked of where “technical detail” began, the\r\nPrime Minister refused to define the matter, but he ventured so far as\r\nto ask a question--whether there were not foreigners in the habit of\r\nsubstituting in small but essential parts of machinery patterns to\r\nwhich we, being of a superior race, could not stoop without changing\r\nthe very conditions of our psychology? It was more or less upon these\r\nlines (said the Prime Minister) that the questions--if they could be\r\ncalled questions--were, so to speak, to proceed; and he hoped that the\r\nanswers they should receive, using the word “answers” in its most\r\ngeneral sense, would on the whole conform to some such conception of\r\nthe duties more or less before them. (_Applause._)\r\n\r\nThe first witness to be called was the _Times_ economist, who refused\r\nto reveal his real name. Being threatened with the torture, he\r\nconfessed to several aliases. He admitted to having signed many letters\r\nbefore this above the pseudonym of “_Verax_,” and, more lately, above\r\nthose of “_A Conservative Working-Man_” and “_A Disgusted Liberal_.” He\r\nwas not specially paid for these articles: it was all in the day’s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCross-examined: He admitted to having written for the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_; he was not “_Maude_” of _Chit-Chat_. Asked whether he were\r\nthe “_Revenue Officer_” of pious memory, he denied the imputation--or,\r\nas he called it, the “soft impeachment”--with the utmost violence. He\r\nalso denied any connection, direct or indirect, with the “_Times_\r\nEncyclopædia,” the “_Times_ System of Payment by Instalments,” the\r\n“Parnell Letters,” the “Hawkesley Letters,” the “Jameson Raid,” the\r\n“Argument upon the Mortality in the Concentration Camps,” the recent\r\n“Roman Correspondence,” the _Times_ “Dramatic Criticism,” and “The\r\nIndustrial Freedom League,” and, indeed, everything else connected with\r\nthat journal. The witness here swore with some heat, the ingenuous\r\ncolour mounting to his cheeks, that he had never changed a date, nor\r\nforged nor garbled a letter, nor taken South African shares, nor\r\nsuppressed evidence, nor done any of these things.\r\n\r\nCOUNSEL (_suavely_): My dear Mr. (I really do not know your name), when\r\nhas there been a bare suggestion of anything of the kind?\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_hotly_): I could see very well where your questions were\r\ndriving.\r\n\r\nWhen this little scene had come to an end, the witness proceeded to\r\ngive evidence that the great mass of imported manufactured goods were\r\nloaded with damnable contraptions, with the undoubted object of\r\ndestroying our own industry, and of supplanting them by that of the\r\nforeigner. He quoted statistics to show that the iron trade, the\r\ntextile trade of Lancashire, the plain chair and kitchen table trade of\r\nHigh Wycombe, the boot, shoe, and slipper trade, the cork trade, the\r\nshipbuilding trade, the glue and gum trade, the fishbone manure trade,\r\nand the manufacture of cheese had declined during the last fifteen\r\nyears from 10 to 30 per cent. He ascribed this deplorable breakdown\r\npartly to the ignorance of technical detail prevalent among\r\npoliticians, but more to the devilish contrivances which gave foreign\r\nmachinery a specious appearance of superiority to our own. He thought\r\nit could be proved that no one of these trades would have declined or\r\ndisappeared had not Britain suffered from this most unjust and tricky\r\nform of competition. He was confident of one thing--that unless the\r\ngreatest attention was given by the Committee to what he called\r\n“Spade-work,” uninteresting but essential matters of fact, it was all\r\nup with the Empire.\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR (_with some hesitation_): All this is mere assertion.\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_calmly_): Upon assertion every great religion has been built.\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR (_seraphically_): You are quite right. I have always\r\nmaintained that the analytical function, and even the quasi-postulated\r\nphenomena of the senses----\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I have always maintained_”]\r\n\r\nA VOICE: Shut up!\r\n\r\nLORD LANSDOWNE (_smartly_): If any further expressions of private\r\nopinion are delivered from the well of the Court, I, for one, shall\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_to the unknown person_): Ked!\r\n\r\nThe Court then proceeded to call further witnesses.\r\n\r\nMr. HENDERSON, Gentleman-Agriculturalist, deposed that it was the habit\r\nof foreigners, principally Frenchmen and Dutchmen, to arrive in his\r\ndistrict of Norfolk every summer with great masses of vegetables,\r\nprincipally onions, which they had grown at least three weeks earlier\r\nthan they could honestly be produced. There was less infamy of this\r\nkind in agriculture perhaps than in other trades--but it was there all\r\nthe same. The witness mentioned melons and giant earlies, and alluded\r\nin passing to yellow kidneys, mammoths, Reading prides, and other\r\nvegetables, in proof of his contention. But the chief example was\r\nHessian fly.\r\n\r\nCross-examined: Witness could not see what all this had to do with\r\nmachinery. Perhaps he had mistaken the day.... Anyhow he was a\r\npractical man.\r\n\r\n  (_Here followed a short and awkward pause._)\r\n\r\nThe witness then stood down with an inconclusive frown.\r\n\r\nMr. LUTWORTHY, of 236, Eton Square, and “The Knoll,” Birmingham,\r\ndeposed that for the last fifteen years German hardware of all kinds\r\nhad been flung at his head, and that it was not in human nature to\r\nwithstand it. To give an example. Iron king-bolts with flange\r\nattachments selling in Newcastle at 35_s._ the imperial gross in 1897,\r\nby discount, were rebated on the margin--(_here the Duke of Marlborough\r\nstarted violently, recovered himself, gazed wildly at the witness, and\r\nthen began taking notes_)--on the margin, he repeated, at a cover of 10\r\nto 8 according to the higgling of the market. In 1898 the margin had\r\nrisen to the minimum fifth, in spite of heavy buying from Russia. In\r\n1899----\r\n\r\nLord HALSBURY: Was not that before the little trouble in South Africa?\r\n\r\nMr. LUTWORTHY: Yes, my lord, but it was late in the year. Towards\r\nSeptember _futures_ were quoted at less than the old “Charles Henry\r\nAgreement” rate--excluding freights. In 1900----\r\n\r\nMr. GERALD BALFOUR (_anxiously_): Would you mind repeating that last\r\nsentence?\r\n\r\nMr. LUTWORTHY (_pleasantly_): Let me make it perfectly clear. (_The\r\nwhole Committee here leant forward with the utmost attention._) Let us\r\nsuppose this (_taking up the Book on which he had been sworn_) to be a\r\nking-bolt. Each king-bolt has at the centre what is known as a _flange\r\nattachment_, as might be this. (_The witness then constructed a\r\ncomplicated thing out of a piece of paper lying near, and stuck it all\r\nround the Book._) Now, to attach the flange attachment so as to be\r\nattachable and detachable, it is necessary to--(_here the witness\r\nlooked all round the table anxiously_)--Oh! yes. There; that will\r\ndo!--(_picking up a pencil_)--to affix either to it or to its bevel a\r\ncatch, as might be this pencil, so. (_The witness here suited the\r\naction to the word._) Now, the Germans, instead of _that_, which is the\r\nright way, they drop the counter, lift the main-ratch, and so get all\r\nthe head-gear into one piece. (_Here the witness paused with a set,\r\nangry face; several people in the well of the Court cried “Shame!” and\r\nMr. Balfour’s hand trembled. Then Mr. Lutworthy added in a shaking\r\nvoice_): One can do nothing against that kind of hitting below the\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: And you took that lying down!\r\n\r\nMr. LUTWORTHY (_despairingly_): I had to. What could I do? If the bevel\r\nhad been galvanised or plated, or even treated with mercury in the\r\noriginal patent, I might have shifted the catch myself. But as it\r\nwas--(_fiercely_)--Oh! how I have struggled!\r\n\r\nLord LANSDOWNE (_in a deep voice_): It is not for long!\r\n\r\nThe witness here stood down with a bowed head.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_briskly_): Next!\r\n\r\nSir CHARLES CASTLEGATE, introduced between two policemen, deposed that:\r\nAs the results of his bankruptcy were still at issue, he must speak\r\nguardedly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_Between two policemen._”]\r\n\r\nLord HALSBURY (_sympathetically_): We quite understand, Sir Charles ...\r\npray continue.\r\n\r\nSir CHARLES (_hurriedly_): I have been concerned, as a company-promoter\r\nand member of the Carlton Club, with gyroscopes, penny-in-the-slot\r\nmachines, atmospheric double-gear brakes, man-lifting kites, clenched\r\ncarrying chains, and many other labour-saving devices. I will deal\r\nfirst with the auto-motor-sheaf-binder. It was originally all British.\r\n(_At this point Mr. Balfour handed a note marked “Urgent” to a\r\nmessenger, who rushed from the room._) It was originally all British.\r\nNow, what happened? I will make myself clear. In every sheaf-binding\r\nmachine the essential parts are a “binder” and a “clutch.” Now, the\r\nbinder is familiar to you all ... (_Here some clamour seemed to rise\r\nfrom the street_) the clutch is more complicated. You must consider\r\nthese in the clutch. Either the pick and the main-nut or (which is much\r\nthe same) the spring, the oil-pan, and the “dagger.” I will draw a\r\nrough sketch.... (_As the prisoner leant over the paper a loud cry of_\r\n“FIRE!” _was raised without, several fire engines were heard ringing\r\ntheir bells and shouting down Whitehall. Immediately afterwards a\r\nfour-inch stream of water burst into the room and played upon the\r\nCourt._\r\n\r\n_The Committee rose in the utmost trepidation and alarm, and the whole\r\nCourt poured down the historic staircase. Several young gentlemen were\r\ncrushed, one beyond recovery, and a grave tragedy was only averted by\r\nthe presence of mind of Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain, who escaped\r\nwith dignity and composure by another entry, and so relieved the\r\npressure. Nevertheless, the fruits of the day were, it is feared,\r\nwholly lost, and no conclusion was arrived at._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUMPING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the fourth meeting of the Cabinet Committee, appointed by its own\r\nmembers, with right of co-option, to discover by what means our Fiscal\r\nRelations--suitable, no doubt, for an earlier age--might be brought\r\ninto closer relation, or relations, with the modern, &c., &c.... All\r\nthe members arrived most punctually, several peers waiting outside in\r\nthe rain for some moments before the doors opened. (_Paragraph._)\r\n\r\nWhen the Bench was seated, silence was imposed by the voice of a\r\nherald, and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN rose:\r\n\r\nHe assured the Court he would detain them but a few moments. Lord Byron\r\nhad wittily said that still waters ran deep, and he, for his part,\r\nafter a long life spent in close, hard-headed bargaining, had noticed\r\nthat the less a man said, the more he was worth. It was a rule he\r\nhimself had always observed. In his conception of Empire, the silent\r\nman, who never spoke, but _did_, should rule until he reached the sky.\r\n\r\n(_Here Lord Lansdowne began muttering to himself, Lord Halsbury openly\r\npulled out his watch, Mr. Balfour shut his eyes and crossed his legs,\r\nand the Duke of Marlborough said “Hear, hear!” in a subdued voice._)\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain, continuing in a manner which combined courtesy with\r\nfirmness, and which was emphasised by his favourite gesture, said that\r\nhe felt it his duty to mention two painful incidents. One was the\r\npremature announcement in the _Daily Mail_ that he was backing down. He\r\nhad no intention of backing down till next February, and there was an\r\nend of that. The second was the misadventure which had broken up last\r\nweek’s sitting. He alluded to the false alarm of fire, and especially\r\nto the pouring of a four-inch stream of water into a building sacred to\r\nhis own immortal predecessor, Mr. Pitt, the father of Lord Chatham and\r\nthe Saviour of Europe--the man to whom we owed Gibraltar, and all that\r\nGibraltar stood for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_Courtesy and firmness_”]\r\n\r\nWhoever gave that false alarm was unworthy of the name of Briton. A\r\npro-Boer newspaper had gone so far as to ascribe it to a conspiracy\r\nagainst him among his own colleagues. (_Here Mr. Chamberlain looked\r\nround, and was met by nervous laughter._) It was like a great deal else\r\nthat such people said; it was a lie.\r\n\r\nHe had now passed several years in close intimacy with them all, and he\r\ncould only say that a more honourable and courteous set of men he had\r\nnever dealt with. He was sure they would reciprocate the feeling.\r\n\r\nHe could safely say _this_: After visiting in all its extent the\r\nmajesty of the Empire, and returning to England, he could only ascribe\r\nwhat had been done in his absence to the loyal support of the men\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain here sat down. He rose again, however, in a moment,\r\nwith the words, “I shall detain you but a very few minutes,” and some\r\ntime after closed an interesting and fruitful speech by saying that the\r\npractice of “Dumping” was universally admitted, and that the business\r\nbefore the Court that day would consist in hearing from witnesses the\r\nform which the process took in various industries.\r\n\r\nThe first witness to be called was--\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY SALTER, manager of Messrs. Garrant and Schüler. He was\r\nwilling to turn King’s Evidence. (_Murmurs._)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: I hope the witness will be heard with respect. He is\r\ndoing his duty, as did our brave allies on the veldt, and as did my old\r\nfriend Le Caron. (_To witness_) Mr. Salter, I am proud to shake you by\r\nthe hand. I wish I had known you in 1886. Such men are rare.\r\n\r\nWitness, continuing, deposed that for no less than eight years past his\r\nemployers had given away their German bicycles free.\r\n\r\n[_Sensation. A furious voice from the well of the court cried, “Let me\r\nget at him!” and an Anglo-Saxon of huge stature was with difficulty\r\nprevented from making an ugly rush. He turned out to be a patentee of\r\nthe old style of high bicycles, who had been ruined by the competition\r\nof safeties._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_An Anglo-Saxon of huge stature_”]\r\n\r\nWitness, further examined, estimated the total number of bicycles he\r\nhad thus offered free at a little over three millions.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_smiling_): Oh, come, Mr. Salter, come!\r\n\r\nMr. SALTER (_shuffling uneasily_): Business is business, my lord.\r\n(_Loud laughter, in which Mr. Chamberlain joined._) There’s nothing to\r\nlaugh at. Every man must make the best of himself.\r\n\r\nLord LANSDOWNE: How were these bicycles bestowed? Did you ask people to\r\nyour country house, and give them by way of their private secretaries,\r\nor did you forget to send in the bill?\r\n\r\nMr. SALTER: Neither, Sir Thomas; we put an advertisement in the papers,\r\nsaying, a “£12 bicycle given away free.”\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR (_with interest_): I have seen such advertisements, but I\r\nnever understood what they meant. The words alone seem to make no\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nMr. SALTER (_eagerly_): They do, indeed, sir! All the competitors had\r\nto do was to send 1_s._ 6_d._ in stamps, and to get orders for ten\r\nother bicycles. (_A pause, after which the witness added, anxiously_)\r\nAm I free now?\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR (_in confusion_): Yes--I suppose so--you may go.\r\n\r\nMr. SALTER: Yes. But I mean----They can’t do anything to me?\r\n\r\nLord HALSBURY (_peevishly_): No! no! no! My good man! All this is\r\nprivileged, of course.\r\n\r\n[_The witness, heaving a deep sigh of relief, walked slowly and rather\r\ninsolently past two policemen, and sauntered into the street, where he\r\nwas at once arrested._]\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_briskly_): That settles Bicycles. Now for Powder!\r\nNext!\r\n\r\n[_At the mention of “Powder” there stepped forward a most popular\r\ngentleman, with whom all members of the Committee warmly shook hands._]\r\n\r\nWITNESS, examined, swore that while his discovery was still in the\r\nexperimental stage, a hideous foreigner had appeared at his works, and\r\nhad proposed “a deal.” This foreigner produced a sample of Powder which\r\nexploded practically at any moment the gunner might choose; at other\r\ntimes--in magazines or manufactories--the Powder would not explode. It\r\nkept in hot climates, and spread no disease aboard ship. It was\r\ncertainly a most remarkable product. The foreigner proposed that they\r\nshould furnish it to the Government as witness’s own, and share\r\nprofits. (_Indignation._)\r\n\r\nLord LANSDOWNE: And you refused?\r\n\r\nWITNESS: Certainly I refused, Lansdowne! I was not given my monopoly to\r\nlet in foreign spies!\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR: We owe you a profound debt of gratitude!\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_visibly affected_): Thank you, Arthur. I can only repay you\r\nall by loyal service; and I think your kindness will be partly\r\njustified when I tell you that I am within sight of producing powder\r\nthat explodes. Some has already gone off by accident in one of my sheds\r\nand killed a German.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[_Witness here shook hands again warmly all round and went out._]\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: Oil! Next!\r\n\r\nMr. ELIHU Z. KAPPER swore that he was an American. In 1872 he first\r\nbegan to import mineral oil into this country. The people took kindly\r\nto it, and used it in a thousand ways. By 1880 he was importing 50,000\r\ngallons a year of it. Meanwhile he was chiselled out by Mr.\r\nRockefeller, and left to freeze. Mr. Rockefeller was a great man. He\r\n(witness) had then turned his attention to the English field, and had\r\ndiscovered vast lakes of oil in Devon, Norfolk, Denbigh, Cumberland,\r\nand Rutland. He had floated ten companies.\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR (_aside_): Wasted capital!\r\n\r\nWITNESS: They had all gone bankrupt, and their bankruptcy was\r\nundoubtedly due to underselling from America. England had more\r\nundeveloped oil than any other country in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: Now let me put you a practical question. If we\r\nprohibited the import of foreign oil, could you float an eleventh\r\ncompany?\r\n\r\nMr. KAPPER (_promptly_): I have an eleventh floated already,\r\nSecretary--I could float a twelfth.\r\n\r\nWitness was succeeded by young Mr. GARRY, of Steynton Hall, Rugby, who\r\nswore that a foreigner, a Prince, had met him at the Savoy last June,\r\nand had given him several articles of foreign manufacture--a cane, a\r\nmatch-box, a dachshund, a wrist-watch, and a dozen of hock. In return\r\nhe had given nothing. He had lent the Prince sums of money on various\r\noccasions, but it had all remained in the country.\r\n\r\nThe next witness was Lord RUSTINGTON. His lordship was visibly affected\r\nby illness, and his face, framed by great whiskers, bore an anxious and\r\neven irritable expression. He hobbled on a stick and said “thank you”\r\nto an assistant who offered him a chair. He had received the summons.\r\nHe was willing to give evidence on dumping. It was a growing evil. At\r\nfirst (in his case) tin cans, packing boxes, and paper were the only\r\nthings to complain of. Last year boots were found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. GERALD BALFOUR (_puzzled_): How “found”?\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_testily_): Please let me finish what I was going to say!...\r\nWere found, I say, and occasionally empty bottles as well----\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: But, surely----\r\n\r\nWITNESS (_angrily_): Will you let me finish a sentence? Empty bottles,\r\ncertainly, empty bottles. And this year it was awful. Old rakes, broken\r\nwheels, heaps of filthy hats, baskets, and--it might seem\r\nincredible--an old mowing-machine.\r\n\r\nCross-examined on the place of origin of these imports, witness said:\r\nIt was the gipsies. They always camped near that corner of the home\r\nfarm on the Pulboro’-road. They threw all sorts of things over the\r\nhedge----\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR (_firmly_): There is some error. This can have nothing to\r\ndo with our inquiry. My dear Lord Rustentown----\r\n\r\nWITNESS: Rustington!\r\n\r\n[_At this point the Committee consulted. After a little whispering Mr.\r\nBalfour explained with the utmost gentleness that there had been a\r\nmistake. The summons should have been sent to Lord Rustentown, the\r\nwell-known ironfounder, money-lender, newspaper-proprietor, and\r\nsupporter of the Government. If any apology of his----_]\r\n\r\n_Witness_ in a towering passion declared that the fault lay with this\r\nGovernment and their accursed folly in flooding the country with new\r\npeers and letting them take any accursed name they fancied. In the\r\ncourse of his remarks witness struck his game foot with his stick, and\r\nthereupon became so violent that he was compelled to retire.\r\n\r\nThere succeeded a dignified silence of some few minutes, at the close\r\nof which Lord Halsbury said:\r\n\r\nLord HALSBURY: Humph!\r\n\r\nHis lordship then rose to his full height and strode solemnly out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nMr. GERALD BALFOUR was the next to leave. He hurried through the door\r\nwithout a word. The PRIME MINISTER followed him, talking to himself.\r\n\r\nLord LANSDOWNE smiled a little anxiously, looked right and left at his\r\ncolleagues, tapped on the table with his fingers, and then got up in\r\nhis turn and went out in a thoughtful manner.\r\n\r\nThroughout this painful scene Mr. CHAMBERLAIN sat immovable, with a\r\nfixed stare and with set lips. At last, in a tone of characteristic\r\nenergy and resource, he broke the silence with the cry of “_Next!_” But\r\nin the universal uncertainty and alarm no one responded to the summons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe unnatural tension was relaxed by the abrupt departure of the three\r\nremaining members of the Court, Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN preceding his\r\nfather, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH following his chief.\r\n\r\nAs the audience dispersed, the gloomiest forebodings arose upon the\r\nsubject of the next sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifth--and, in some respects, or, as Mr. Balfour has put it, “in\r\nmany ways,” the most important--meeting of the Cabinet Committee\r\nappointed to Inquire upon the Causes of our National Decline, and to\r\nsuggest some Remedy Therefor, was held at Downing Street in the usual\r\nplace: the little room on the first floor to the left of the door.\r\n\r\nThe window, sketches of which have already appeared in the illustrated\r\npapers, may be distinguished by the new and perfectly clean panes of\r\nglass replacing those broken during the recent alarm of Fire.\r\n\r\nA large crowd began to assemble at two o’clock outside the premises\r\nwherein the tragedy was to take place, and it was with difficulty that\r\na number of policemen in plain clothes, but shod in the regulation\r\nboots, kept a lane open through the anxious though good-natured\r\npopulace.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain was the first to arrive, accompanied by the\r\nPostmaster-General. They came on foot, faultlessly dressed and\r\napparently in the highest good humour.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the Duke of Marlborough appeared in the lowest good\r\nhumour; he was on horseback, and bore several very large volumes\r\nprecariously under one arm. The crowd waited in vain for the other\r\nmembers of the Committee; they did not come.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it was explained to the Court within that the three members\r\npresent constituted a quorum, and the sitting was opened by\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN rising and saying he would detain them but a very few\r\nmoments. He pointed out that his opponents were perpetually harping\r\nsordidly upon the mere economic evils which might follow the\r\nintroduction of Preferential Free Trade. To reply to these criticisms\r\nmight have baffled a man of less determination; he could not ask\r\nvolunteers to come forward and submit themselves to the test, and\r\nhis--he supposed he must call him his honourable--friend had refused to\r\nlend the Boer Prisoners still (he was glad to say) in captivity. He had\r\nsurmounted those difficulties. He would call a number of living animals\r\nupon whom the whole scheme, from the recent procedure in Parliament to\r\nthe effect of cheap tobacco upon the stomach, had been tried. (_To the\r\nDoor-keeper._) Let loose the----\r\n\r\nThe proceedings were here interrupted by Counsel for the Cobden Club,\r\nwho rose and said he had a “replevin et demurrer” to lay before the\r\nCourt. He believed such action to be cognisable under the writ “de\r\nHæretico Comburendo,” and submitted, in all respect, that it was\r\nindictable by the Chartered Secretary of the S.P.C.F.C.H.H.[1] before\r\nthe Justices in Eyre or in Chambers.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN, holding in his hand a little slip of paper, spoke in\r\nhis legal capacity as member of the Privy Council; still deciphering\r\nthe said slip, he pointed out that the jurisdiction of the Courts\r\nSeizined was inferior to that of the Courts “En Plein” such as was this\r\nCourt. He was sure of his facts. He would allow no interruption,\r\ncontradiction, observation, Garrant in Warren or in Main, Bart,\r\nBlaspheme or Marraeny, under pain of contempt. He trusted his learned\r\nbrother (turning to the Duke of Marlborough) would agree with him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of MARLBOROUGH, rising with his hands clasped behind his back,\r\nspoke in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard. He was understood\r\nto say that it was all right.\r\n\r\nMr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, speaking _De Auctoritate Suâ_, said they had\r\nheard the opinion of the greatest statesman and jurist in England, and\r\nalso of one who, as one of the highest members of the Highest Court in\r\nthe Realm--the House of Lords--was an unimpeachable authority.\r\n\r\nThe Court thus agreeing, Counsel for the Cobden Club was fined a\r\nhundred pounds for contempt, and the Inquiry proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe first witness to be called was a HORSE.\r\n\r\nAs it was evidently impious to swear the animal, and impossible to take\r\nhis affirmation with hand lifted over the head in the Agnostic style,\r\nhe was allowed to pledge himself by proxy that he would do nothing for\r\nthe sake of gain, prejudice, hate, love, favour, or worldly advantage.\r\n\r\nThe TRAINER then explained that the horse would prove to demonstration\r\nthat muzzling produced no ill effect upon living creatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: Have you tried the experiment upon Human Beings?\r\n\r\nThe TRAINER: No.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: No _what_?\r\n\r\nThe TRAINER: No, your worship.\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_sternly_): That is better.... (_Gently_) You have not\r\ntried it upon Human Beings because you thought an experiment _in\r\ncorporis viro_ would suffice?\r\n\r\nThe TRAINER: ...? ...?\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_testily_): Do you hear me?\r\n\r\nThe TRAINER (_sulkily_): Yus!\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_to the Court, and especially to the Press_): The\r\nHorse, you will observe, is free. He can whinny, neigh, or bite at\r\nwill. Observe!\r\n\r\n(_At this word a gentleman called_ JAMES _ran a pin into the_ WITNESS,\r\n_who thereupon lashed out a violent kick against the wall._)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: He shall now be muzzled.\r\n\r\n(_A large leathern bag completely enveloping its head and mane was put\r\nover the witness, who thereupon shuffled uneasily, as though\r\nbewildered._)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: Now!\r\n\r\n(Mr. JAMES _again touched up the witness with the pin. Instead of\r\nkicking, the witness danced in an agitated manner and went through\r\nvarious contortions_.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: I think no further proof is needed of the\r\nadvantage--or at any rate the innoxiousness--of the muzzle or gag. I\r\ntrust the experiment will put an end to those foolish complaints in\r\nParliament and the Press which have recently caused the continent\r\nitself to sneer. Next!\r\n\r\nThe next witnesses called were TWO PIGS.\r\n\r\nThe Counsel for the Cobden Club, at the risk of his fortune, rose to\r\nprotest. His disclaim was not so much against the Pigs themselves\r\n(_porcs de soi_), for the Court had allowed them, and he\r\n(_emphatically_) was not there to contradict the superior wisdom of the\r\nCourt. It was rather against the presence of _two_ witnesses in the box\r\nat the same time. It was wholly opposed to the spirit of Our English\r\nLaw. Latterly that spirit had been attacked in a hundred ways:\r\nPrisoners could speak for themselves, even solicitors--he was ashamed\r\nto say--could plead in inferior Courts, but two witnesses in the same\r\nbox was more, he thought, than the temper that produced an Eldon and a\r\nHalsbury could stand. Let alone the relaxation of the moral bond (for\r\nhow could these two witnesses feel in common the awful meaning of an\r\nindividual oath?) let alone the moral bond....\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN (_suddenly_): You are making a speech!\r\n\r\nThe Counsel for the Cobden Club was then taken off to prison. The\r\nInquiry proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe WITNESSES solemnly deposed by another’s mouth (as do infants in\r\nbaptism) that they were born of one litter in the beautiful old-world\r\nvillage of....\r\n\r\nMr. CHAMBERLAIN: Go on! go on!\r\n\r\nWITNESSES, continuing, affirmed that they were reared in the same way\r\nto the age of six months. It was then determined to feed the one (Tom)\r\nin the Protectionist, the other (Bill) in the Free Trade spirit. All\r\nmanner of food was stuffed into the latter at all hours; the former had\r\na sparse meal once a week of honest English husks and bean-pods, with a\r\nlittle straw. Look at them now! “Kruger,” the free-trader pig, was so\r\nfat he could hardly walk. His life was a burden: he implored the\r\nrelease of death. “Roosevelt,” on the other hand, was a frisky,\r\namiable, and active pig, capable of the most amusing tricks, and a fit\r\ncompanion for the best wits of the age.\r\n\r\nThe WITNESSES then stood down after receiving the thanks of the Court.\r\n\r\nA FERRET, two DORMICE, and a CAPERCAILZIE having been heard to little\r\neffect,\r\n\r\nA BOA-CONSTRICTOR was called to show that indirect taxation was capable\r\nof indefinite expansion, and a HIPPOPOTAMUS to satisfy the Court that a\r\nbroad basis was synonymous with stability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA TRAINED LION was sworn, and showed, in the most amusing manner, under\r\nthe artificial stimulus of a trainer with a whip, how in old age, with\r\nhis teeth drawn and his spirit thoroughly broken, even so dangerous a\r\nbeast could be put to the most useful work: such as rolling a log,\r\nbalancing a see-saw, ploughing the sand, wiping something off a slate,\r\ndoing a little spade work, and even roaring at command more loudly than\r\nin youth. The Imperial Brute was dressed in a large Union-Jack, and\r\nwhile it provided instruction afforded also entertainment to the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nMany other witnesses, subpœnaed at enormous expense, carried conviction\r\nto all present, when Mr. CHAMBERLAIN ordered to be introduced the\r\nELEPHANT, presented by our Friend and Ally, the Maharajah of Gûm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter some delay, during which the anxiety of the Court was terrible to\r\nbehold, a Marabout arrived announcing that the Faithful Animal and\r\nLoyal Servant of the Empire had breathed its last that very hour in its\r\nRooms at St. James’s! The Marabout, who elected to be sworn in the\r\nHindoo manner, that is, formally and without prejudice, recounted with\r\nmany sobs the last hours of the noble Pachyderm. It was chosen, he\r\nassured the Court, on account of its peculiar longevity; it being\r\nassumed by His Highness the Maharajah (_here witness bowed once to the\r\nCourt, once to the Royal Arms, and once to nothing in particular_) that\r\nan animal which had outlived the Empire of the Great Mogul would\r\nsurvive the protracted Inquiry upon the Fiscal Relations of the &c.,\r\n&c. Alas! Providence had otherwise disposed!\r\n\r\nIn a chastened and humble mood, and dwelling upon the vanity of human\r\naffairs, the Court solemnly adjourned. The Duke of Marlborough was\r\nheard to murmur, in the words of Burke, “What shadows we are, and what\r\nshadows we pursue!” a phrase which Mr. Chamberlain immediately entered\r\nin his pocket-book under the heading “p. 273, pop. quota.; mem. Latin\r\noriginal?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sixth and last sitting of the Inquiry upon the Fiscal (skip the\r\nrest) was remarkable in many ways, but especially for the fact that Mr.\r\nChamberlain alone appeared.\r\n\r\nThe audience in the street outside, and the many experts and officials\r\nwho were privileged to enter the court, were waiting in vain for the\r\nadvent of at least the Duke of Marlborough or Mr. Austen Chamberlain,\r\nwhen the Colonial Secretary rose, and after remarking that he would\r\ndetain them for but a very few moments, begged that they would not take\r\nalarm at the constitution of the court.\r\n\r\nThe absence of his colleagues was just the kind of thing that his more\r\nvirulent opponents might put down to some difference within the\r\nCabinet. Against malicious ignorance of that kind there was no weapon\r\nbut direct contradiction. He would contradict it here and now, as he\r\nhad successfully contradicted in the past his connection with the\r\nJameson raid, the stupid story about the garden party at Lord\r\nRothschild’s, and the legend of his having been a Free Trader and a\r\nHome Ruler, in some remote past which his enemies found it very\r\ndifficult to discover. (_Laughter._)\r\n\r\nHe did not think it seemly that a man should talk too much about\r\nhimself. He would therefore make no allusion to the services he had\r\nrendered his country. Such as they were, they could never be more than\r\nthe services of one man. A great man perhaps, a loveable man certainly,\r\nbut after all, only one man.\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield had said that men imputed themselves. He was not\r\nquite clear what this meant, but,--....\r\n\r\n(_Here Mr. Chamberlain took up another little bit of paper, frowned,\r\nlet drop his eye-glass, fiddled a little with his fingers, frowned\r\nagain, replaced his eye-glass, and explained that he had mislaid some\r\nof his notes._)\r\n\r\nContinuing in a more natural tone, and with far less fluency, he\r\nproceeded to give in detail the reasons for the absence of each of his\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister was occupied at Deptford, arguing with some\r\nNonconformists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_Arguing with Nonconformists._”]\r\n\r\nLord Halsbury had retired into a monastery, to make his peace with God.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne had been suddenly called to the Foreign Office to\r\ntranslate some Frenchified stuff or other in the Sugar Convention.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Marlborough was suffering from brain fever, and, in spite\r\nof the terribly contagious nature of the disease, Mr. Gerald Balfour\r\nwas nursing him with all the tenderness of a woman.\r\n\r\nHis own son, Austen, had that very morning received a letter from a\r\nMrs. Augusta Legge, of Tooting. It was addressed to the\r\nPostmaster-General, and complained that a box of fish, despatched by\r\nher ten days ago, had been lost in the post. The Postmaster-General\r\nalways attended to these things himself. It was in the tradition of\r\nhard, silent self-denial in which he had himself been brought up, and\r\nin which he had brought up his family.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances he thought he would not call any witnesses ...\r\nsomething much more convincing than any number of witnesses was being\r\nprepared in the Horse Guards’ parade.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain cordially invited those present to attend, and sat down\r\nafter speaking two hours and thirty-four minutes, during the whole of\r\nwhich prodigious space of time he kept his audience entranced and\r\nspeechless.\r\n\r\nAt the close of these proceedings, Lord Burnham came forward in his\r\nrobes, his escutcheon borne by pages, and displaying as supporters,\r\nHummim and Thummim, with the legend “_Nec Nomina Mutant_.” The\r\nVenerable Peer presented the Colonial Secretary with a pair of white\r\ngloves, according to an ancient and touching custom, which prescribes\r\nsuch a gift when a Court is happily spared the painful duty of\r\ndelivering a verdict.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain then disappeared through a little door to robe himself\r\nas a Roman Emperor, in which character he proposed to address the\r\npageant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Horse Guards’ Parade an enormous crowd was discovered\r\nstretching as far as the eye could reach, but leaving between\r\nthemselves and the grand stand a space, through which could defile the\r\nprocession which had been arranged. At precisely fifteen minutes to six\r\nMr. Chamberlain rose to address the crowd, and by a fine conception the\r\nbrass band, the flags, and the various contingents of the procession\r\nbegan marching past at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps on this account that his speech was not very clearly\r\nheard. The opening sentence, however, rang high and clear: “I shall\r\ndetain you,” he said, “for but a very few moments.” What followed was\r\ndrowned in a blast of trumpets preceding the arrival of----\r\n\r\nA dozen miserable Unionist Free Traders. The unhappy men were gagged\r\nand driven forward, with their hands tied behind their backs, by a\r\nconvoy of voters from Birmingham, arranged in blocks of five, and\r\nbearing banners ornamented with mottoes in their own dialect.\r\n\r\nIn the short interval following their passage, several of Mr.\r\nChamberlain’s sentences could be plainly heard:\r\n\r\n“I will tell the truth ... that has ever been ... Imperial race ... one\r\nunited....”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the contingent of National Scouts, cheering wildly and\r\ngalloping past the saluting point, drowned the master’s voice.\r\n\r\nWhen the dust they had raised had somewhat fallen, his stern, impassive\r\nfeatures were once more discernible, and a few more sentences could be\r\ncaught above the din, though with increasing difficulty, as the mob\r\nwere beginning to indulge in that loud horse-play which is inseparable\r\nfrom great popular movements.\r\n\r\n“He was not often mistaken.... They could not point to any opinion\r\nwhich he had ... and which had not been....”\r\n\r\nThough it was evident from the considerable distension of his mouth\r\nthat the Great Statesman was still making history, nothing more could\r\nbe heard: every word was swallowed up, as it were, in the increasing\r\nenthusiasm of the crowd.\r\n\r\nAn effigy of Mr. Winston Churchill, stuffed with straw, was dragged\r\npast the grand stand amid hoots and jeers, and finally burnt at the\r\nstake in the open space near the Duke of York’s steps.\r\n\r\nFifty-seven enormous vans, drawn by twelve strong horses each, and\r\nloaded to the height of at least forty feet with pamphlets and small\r\nhandbooks, received perhaps a greater ovation than any other section of\r\nthe procession, until, at its close, and, as though to emphasize that\r\nunity among all our fellow subjects, which has been the object of Mr.\r\nChamberlain’s life, a number of Kaffirs, dressed as nearly as possible\r\nin the manner of the British working man, appeared on the extreme\r\nright, and marched past with colours flying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the approaching tramp and order of these brave men fell upon their\r\nears, the crowd could no longer restrain themselves. Loud shouts of\r\n“Tweebosch!” and the names of other well-fought fields whereon they had\r\nfought and bled for us, rose from the three educated men who were to be\r\ndiscovered in that vast assembly. As the legion passed the stand\r\nitself, and turned eyes right to the majestic figure that had enrolled\r\nthem in the common service of the Island Race, a great song, of which\r\nthe words were at first indistinct, rose spontaneously from various\r\nparts of the parade: within a few seconds half a million undaunted\r\nvoices were giving forth the great Song of Empire:\r\n\r\n  “Whoi carn’t every man\r\n    ’Ave three woives!”\r\n\r\nSpurred by such emotions, the crowd broke through the cordon which had\r\nhitherto been stoutly maintained by a body of Mr. Brodrick’s recruits,\r\nand made a rush for the grand stand; it unfortunately collapsed under\r\nthe multitude of those attempting to honour their leader by a personal\r\nembrace. Perhaps no fitter termination could have been imagined for a\r\nscene which marked a turning point in the history of the Horse Guards’\r\nParade.\r\n\r\nThe Colonial Secretary, it need scarcely be added, did not remain to\r\nreceive this last testimony to his popularity, but the beginning of the\r\nenthusiastic movement in the crowd was enough to convince him that he\r\nhad thousands at his back, and, as Napoleon is reported to have said to\r\nhis coachman after Waterloo, “With such numbers behind him a man should\r\nbe capable of all things.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nAPPOINTED TO\r\n\r\nSIT HARD UPON\r\n\r\nTHE FISCAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nMOTHERLAND.\r\n\r\n_Made to the Cabinet in Full Session, crowned, robed, and regardant,\r\nand ordered to be enrolled among the Imperial Archives_\r\n\r\n=Under the Great Seal, the Privy Seal, and the Mace Statuant.=\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR COMMITTEE--\r\n\r\nDid first consider whether they should pursue the course of stating\r\ntheir reasons before their conclusions; or, secondly, their conclusions\r\nbefore their reasons; or, thirdly, their reasons only; or, fourthly,\r\ntheir conclusions only; or, fifthly, a sort of rhodomontade in which\r\nthere should be neither reasons nor conclusions, as is the more common\r\npractice. Your Committee divided upon each of these questions, when it\r\nappeared that--\r\n\r\n  The first course was rejected unanimously.\r\n  The second course was rejected by acclamation.\r\n  The third course was rejected by inspiration.\r\n  The fourth course was rejected by infatuation.\r\n  The fifth course was rejected by error.\r\n\r\nIt having thus arrived, in the heat of the moment, that Your Committee\r\nhad by accident rejected all courses, and had nothing left to go\r\nupon--there being no precedent for such a misadventure--\r\n\r\nYOUR COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nThereupon decided to begin _de novo et ab ovo_, and there was drawn up\r\nby\r\n\r\nYOUR COMMITTEE, with the aid of an expert prose-writer, a majority\r\nreport, in the following tenor:--\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION I.= YOUR COMMITTEE are of opinion, after hearing all the\r\nevidence presented to them, that--\r\n\r\n  _The Empire cannot go on like this._ It is amply proved that not only\r\n  Great Britain and Ireland, but the Colonies also, are and have been\r\n  for many years increasing in wealth, population, and power, to the\r\n  grave detriment of the Christian Virtues of Humility and Holy Dread.\r\n  It is further proved beyond cavil that the cheapness of goods of all\r\n  kinds has enabled the mass of the population to live riotously, has\r\n  destroyed thrift, impaired industry, and even threatened that\r\n  Sobriety which had hitherto been the chief mark of our race.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION II.= There is, however, another side of the picture. Not only\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, but the Colonies also, are on the verge of\r\nbankruptcy; their population is for the most part starving; in many\r\ndistricts, notably in Lancashire, the Isle of Thanet, Manitoba, and the\r\nWagga-Muri country, N.S.W., the wretched populace subsist on grass like\r\nbeasts of the field, and have lost all semblance of human form. Even\r\nthe wealthy classes have felt the pinch. Three furnished houses in\r\nSouth Audley Street are untenanted, and it has been necessary to\r\nprovide out-door relief for the clergy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADE IN POOR OLD KENT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION III.= Gold has accumulated so rapidly of late years as at once\r\nto clog the main channels of business, and to make men lose all sense\r\nof the value of the precious metal. An increase of five million pounds\r\na year in the circulating medium of the country cannot be regarded\r\nwithout alarm. Innumerable 10_s._ bits are carelessly mistaken for\r\nsixpences. Whole sovereigns are dropped in cabs, and capitalists of\r\ngreat prominence allow vast sums to be withdrawn by fraud from their\r\nbalances at the banks. The precious metals are used in making cigarette\r\ncases, medals, and statuettes, and are even wantonly wasted upon\r\nobjects of superstition in the churches. All these evils undoubtedly\r\nproceed from what Professor Macfadden has called “The Plethora of\r\nGold.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION IV.= Meanwhile there is an awful and hitherto irresistible\r\ndrain of gold from every port in the kingdom. Most of our population,\r\neven those betraying every outward sign of prosperity, say that “they\r\ndo not know where to turn for money.” The young men at our universities\r\nare all of them deeply in debt, and even the old men are often pretty\r\ndicky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_The young men are all of them deeply in debt, and even\r\nthe old men are often pretty dicky._”]\r\n\r\nFour Colonial loans have failed during the year.\r\n\r\nMr. Seddon informs us that a paltry reward offered him by a grateful\r\nnation had to be raised in no less than five instalments. Indeed, he\r\nwas for a long time most anxious about the fifth.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to get change.\r\n\r\nNumerous cases are on record in which gentlemen of good birth have\r\nfound themselves in omnibuses without the means to pay their fare. Some\r\nof them have been thrown out with violence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_Gentlemen of good birth_”]\r\n\r\nShort temporary loans, such as could once be negotiated by friends for\r\nnothing, can now only be raised upon ruinous terms--sometimes as much\r\nas 60 per cent.--from total strangers.\r\n\r\nPaper is everywhere creeping in in the place of metal, in the shape of\r\ncheques, bank-notes, stamps, I.O.U.s, and dunning letters: a state of\r\naffairs rather worthy of Spain than of a Race which has spread its\r\nlanguage over half the new world.\r\n\r\nAll these evils are most undoubtedly caused by the drain of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION V.= Foreign nations, in a fit of madness, are perpetually\r\nforcing presents upon us, to the ruin of our legitimate trade. Patriots\r\nwho attempt to refuse these gifts are met by threats.\r\n\r\nA well-known alderman, of Peckham, who persistently bought English wine\r\nin preference to foreign trash, has recently died in torment under the\r\nsuspicion of poison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA promising young clerk and poet, known as Balmy Jim, who dressed\r\nexclusively in clothes of his own manufacture, has been discovered\r\nhanging to a tree in Richmond Park.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Charles Henty, Fellow of St. Barnabas, who broke a lot of\r\nglass in Kew Gardens to encourage English glazing, has been\r\nincarcerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION VI.= No less than fourteen professors of political economy\r\nhave pointed out, in a very able manifesto, that they differ from some\r\nof the most remarkable of our politicians upon fiscal matters. This\r\nalone should show the intense interest aroused by the whole question,\r\nand the absurdity of pretending that an inquiry was not demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION VII.= We are informed by our colleagues that they have been\r\nscurrilously attacked by no less than fourteen pedants, whom they\r\nbelieve to be in the pay of foreign powers. This is not the kind of\r\naccusation that can be proved or disproved. It suffices to show the\r\nimportance of the issues before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION VIII.= The Editors of the _Daily Mail_, of the _Spectator_, of\r\nthe _Standard_, and so forth, have suddenly turned nasty against the\r\nEditors of the _Times_, the _Daily Express_, the _Globe_, and what not,\r\nwhoever they may be. This alone should show, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION IX.= The Duke of Devonshire has made some most irritating\r\nremarks, so has Sir John Gorst. This alone, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYOUR COMMITTEE are, therefore, totally unable to make up their minds\r\nwhat on earth should be done.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to decide.\r\n\r\nThey are on the horns of a dilemma.\r\n\r\nThey are in the utmost perturbation.\r\n\r\nThey heartily wish you had not asked them to undertake this task.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd Your Commissioners will ever pray, &c.\r\n\r\n  PRINTED BY R.
