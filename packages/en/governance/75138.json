Princess\r\nChristian of Schleswig-Holstein, whose retentive memory of the persons\r\nmentioned in the text has been unreservedly and generously brought to\r\nbear upon the notes to these volumes, and to H.R.H. Princess Henry of\r\nBattenberg, to whose pious regard for her Mother’s memory, as Executrix\r\nof Queen Victoria’s Will, the publication of the Journals may be\r\nascribed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, he is anxious to thank Lord Rosebery for his friendly\r\nco-operation in having read the proofs, and for many valuable\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, he cannot sufficiently acknowledge the care lavished upon\r\nthe publication of this book by his friend John Murray, junior, whose\r\ninherited gifts have been placed unreservedly at the disposal of the\r\nEditor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGES\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                                                        1–41\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n                                 1832\r\n\r\nJourney by St. Albans, Dunstable, Coventry, and Birmingham\r\n    to Welshpool — Arrival at Powis Castle — At Beaumaris —\r\n    Visit to Baron Hill — Sir Richard and Lady Bulkeley — At\r\n    Plas Newydd — Journey to Eaton — Visit to Lord and Lady\r\n    Westminster — The Grosvenor family — Visit to Chatsworth\r\n    — The Cavendish family — Expedition to Haddon Hall —\r\n    Visit to Alton Towers — A hunting episode — Visit to\r\n    Wytham Abbey — A day in Oxford — Back to Kensington —\r\n    Christmas presents                                             42–62\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n                                 1833\r\n\r\nArrival of “Dash” — Various lessons — At the Opera —\r\n    _Kenilworth_ ballet — Life at Kensington — Recreations\r\n    — Dinner party for the King; and the guests — The Opera\r\n    and Taglioni — Somerset House Exhibition — The Duke of\r\n    Orleans — Fourteenth birthday — Presents — A birthday\r\n    ball — Alexander and Ernest of Würtemberg — Paganini and\r\n    Malibran — Journey to Portsmouth — At Norris Castle — On\r\n    board the _Emerald_ — Visit to the _Victory_ — Journey\r\n    to Plymouth — Presentation of Colours — The Queen of\r\n    Portugal — Spanish affairs — At Drury Lane — A lecture on\r\n    physics                                                        63–90\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                                 1834\r\n\r\nThe Order of Maria Louisa — At the Opera — _Anna Boulena_ and\r\n    _Othello_ — Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg — Feodore, Princess\r\n    von Hohenlohe-Langenburg and her children — Visit to\r\n    Windsor — The King and Queen — Portuguese affairs — At\r\n    St. Leonards — A carriage accident — Death of the Duke of\r\n    Gloucester — A fine sermon                                    91–106\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n                                 1835\r\n\r\nAt St. Leonards — A shipwreck — Lessons — Back to Kensington\r\n    — Death of the Duke of Leuchtenberg — Opera _Otello_\r\n    — Visit to Windsor — A concert — Grisi, Lablache, and\r\n    Tamburini — Sixteenth birthday — Presents — Eton Montem —\r\n    At the opera — Death of Countess Mensdorff — Confirmation\r\n    — Ceremony at St. James’s — First Communion — At\r\n    Tunbridge Wells — Races — Reading — Back to Kensington\r\n    — Duc de Nemours — Journey to Bishopthorpe — Harcourt\r\n    family — York Minster — At Canterbury — Ramsgate — The\r\n    King and Queen of the Belgians                               107–139\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                                 1836\r\n\r\nAt Ramsgate — Back to Kensington — Change of rooms —\r\n    Marriage of the Queen of Portugal — A dinner party — The\r\n    theatre — Kemble and Macready — Helen Faucit — Charles\r\n    Mathews — Visit to Windsor — State ball — Princes\r\n    Ferdinand and Augustus — King Leopold’s _Directions_\r\n    — Visit of Ernest and Albert of Saxe-Coburg — Their\r\n    characteristics and charms — Seventeenth birthday — The\r\n    British Gallery — The Victoria Asylum — Lablache — At\r\n    Claremont — Portuguese revolution — Events in Lisbon\r\n    — King Leopold and Belgium — Death of Malibran — At\r\n    Ramsgate — Books read — A dinner party — Louis Napoleon\r\n    at Strasburg — A stormy journey — Rochester — Back to\r\n    Kensington — Claremont — A gipsy camp                        140–182\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n                                 1837\r\n\r\nGipsies — M.

Both\r\nmounted the Throne early in life alone and unprotected, at a moment of\r\nreaction against the abuses of monarchy. Under George III. as under\r\nHenry VIII. this country had been subjected to violent commotion\r\nconsequent on the struggle for national freedom against a foreign\r\npower. The Reformation in England and the Napoleonic wars owed their\r\nsuccessful issue to the persistent determination of the English people\r\nto be free. The hated marriage of Mary and the matrimonial scandals\r\nof George IV. had cast a gloom over the temper of the nation. Even\r\nthe triumph of the popular cause, due to the grudging support given\r\nby William IV. to his Whig Ministers, had not restored the forfeited\r\nprestige of the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nReaction was the corollary against the fear inspired by Philip in the\r\none case and the humiliating memories of Queen Caroline in the other.\r\nThat reaction came in the shape of the popular enthusiasm inspired by a\r\nyoung and attractive Tudor princess, who at Hatfield on a late November\r\nafternoon in 1558 heard from Cecil that she was Queen of England. Three\r\ncenturies later a similar outburst followed the accession of another\r\nyouthful princess only just eighteen years old, looking scarcely\r\nmore than a child, when she received the homage of Lord Melbourne at\r\nKensington Palace on a June morning of 1837.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to follow this seductive pathway through the devious\r\nalleys of historical comparison and contrasts. The troubles of\r\nElizabeth’s childhood at Hunsdon, the pitiful laments of her excellent\r\ngoverness at the poverty of her ward’s surroundings, and the hostile\r\natmosphere surrounding her person were reflected in a minor degree\r\nwithin the precincts of Kensington during the early years of Princess\r\nVictoria’s life.\r\n\r\nOur concern, however, is not with Elizabeth but with Victoria, with the\r\nEngland into which she was born, and with the influences which helped\r\nto give her character and bearing a certain strength and dignity,\r\nand attuned her heart, not perhaps to deep tenderness, but to much\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\nThe pen recoils from an attempt to tell again the story of Princess\r\nVictoria’s birth and early life, or to describe once more the political\r\nevents of her first years upon the Throne. Moreover, these volumes tell\r\ntheir own tale. They set forth in the young Princess’s own artless\r\nwords the daily facts of her existence at Kensington, or when making\r\nsome provincial royal progress in the company of her mother.\r\n\r\nThe reader can catch many a glimpse here and there of the soul of a\r\nPrincess, proud and headstrong, affectionate and sometimes perverse,\r\nseated on the lonely heights of the Throne. The portrait is here,\r\nwithin these pages. It is not unskilfully drawn, when the youth of the\r\nartist is borne in mind. At the time when the first entries in these\r\nJournals were made, the writer was thirteen years old. The last page\r\nwas written on the day of her marriage. She had been two years a Queen,\r\nand she was in her twenty-first year.\r\n\r\nPrincess Victoria, the only child of the Duke and Duchess of Kent,\r\nand the ultimate heiress in direct succession of George III., was\r\nborn on May 24, 1819. In 1819 the aspect of English country life\r\nwas not very different from that of to-day; if the roads were not\r\nso well surfaced, and if woodlands were rather more plentiful, the\r\nfields and hedgerows, the farmsteads with cottages grouped around\r\nthem, the Tudor manor-houses, the Georgian villas, the church spires,\r\nand the village greens have remained unchanged. Except for lines of\r\nrailway and telegraph poles, the hop-fields of Kent and the Surrey\r\ncommons have kept their shape and contours. So that, in spite of the\r\nmiracles wrought by machinery in the minutiæ of life, any one of our\r\ngrandparents cruising in an airship at an elevation of some hundreds of\r\nfeet over the lands where he hunted and shot, or even the great town\r\nin which he spent his summer months, would probably be unconscious of\r\nmuch distinctive change.\r\n\r\nYoung people, however, think it odd when they read that when Princess\r\nVictoria was taken from Kensington to Claremont—a journey now\r\naccomplished with as little thought as would then have been given to\r\na drive between the Palace and Hyde Park—it was considered a “family\r\nremoval” of such moment as to require all the provision and precautions\r\nassociated to-day with an autumn holiday.\r\n\r\nTo those still young, but old enough to remember Queen Victoria, it\r\nmay seem hardly credible that she was born into a world devoid of\r\nall the marvels of steam and electric contrivance that appear to us\r\nthe necessities, and not merely the luxuries, of life. How much more\r\ndifficult it must be for them to realise that when the young Princess\r\n(whom they remember a great and mysterious figure, welcoming back\r\nonly the other day her soldiers from South Africa, and rejoicing in\r\ntheir victories) was carried into the saloon of Kensington Palace to\r\nbe received by Archbishop Manners Sutton into the Church of Christ,\r\nthe mighty spirit of Napoleon brooded still behind the palisades of\r\nLongwood, and George III.’s white and weary head could still be seen at\r\nthe window of his library at Windsor!\r\n\r\nThe Victorian era covers the period of the expansion of England into\r\nthe British Empire. The soldier, still young to-day, who put the\r\ncoping-stone on the Empire in Africa in 1900 is linked by the life of\r\nthe Queen to his forbears, who, when she was born, were still nursing\r\nthe wounds gloriously earned four years before in laying its foundation\r\nin a Belgian cornfield.\r\n\r\nThat year 1819, however, was a year of deep despondency in England. In\r\nEurope it was the “glorious year of Metternich,” then at the height\r\nof his maleficent power. Europe was quit of Napoleon, but had got\r\nMetternich in exchange, and was ill pleased with the bargain. Great\r\nBritain, it is true, was free, but our people were overwrought by\r\npoverty and suffering. The storm-swell of the great Napoleonic wars\r\nstill disturbed the surface of English life, and few realised that they\r\nwere better off than they had been during the past decade.\r\n\r\nAt Holland House, its coteries thinner but still talking, Lady\r\nHolland—old Madagascar—was still debating what inscription should\r\nrecord the merits of Mr. Fox upon his monument in the Abbey for\r\nthe edification of future ages. In St. James’s Place Sam Rogers’s\r\nbreakfasts had not lost their vogue. Tommy Moore was still dining with\r\nHorace Twiss, and meeting Kean, and Mrs. Siddons, “cold and queenlike,”\r\non her way to view Caroline of Brunswick’s “things” shortly to be sold\r\nat Christie’s, or to criticise Miss O’Neill’s dress rehearsals. On the\r\nvery day that Princess Victoria was born, Byron was writing to John\r\nMurray from Venice “in the agonies of a sirocco,” and clamouring for\r\nthe proofs of the first canto of _Don Juan_. In that year _Ivanhoe_\r\nwas finished, and in the hands of eager readers; whilst Scott was\r\nreceiving at Abbotsford a certain Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, uncle\r\nof the baby at Kensington, destined thereafter to play a large part in\r\nher early life. Keats had just published _Endymion_. It was his last\r\nyear in England before going south to die. And it was Shelley’s _annus\r\nmirabilis_: the year in which he wrote _Prometheus_ and _The Cenci_—an\r\nachievement, some have since said, unparalleled in English poetry since\r\nShakespeare lived and wrote.\r\n\r\n_The Excursion_ had been published five years before, but Wordsworth\r\nwas at Rydal Mount completing _The White Doe of Rylston_. Southey\r\nwas Poet Laureate. Three years before, in the “wild and desolate\r\nneighbourhood amid great tracts of bleak land enclosed by stone dykes\r\nsweeping up Clayton heights,” Charlotte Brontë’s eyes had opened upon\r\nher sad world. Carlyle, then a young teacher in Edinburgh, was passing\r\nthrough that stormy period of the soul which comes sooner or later to\r\nevery one whose manhood is worth testing by God. And half-way between\r\nHorncastle and Spilsby, on the lower slope of a Lincolnshire wold,\r\nAlfred Tennyson was reading Pope’s _Iliad_ and himself “writing an\r\nepic of 6,000 lines _à la_ Walter Scott.” At Shrewsbury School under\r\nDr. Butler, Charles Darwin, then a boy of ten, had already begun to\r\ndevelop a taste for “collecting,” manifested in “franks” and seals and\r\ncoins. Robert Browning, a turbulent and destructive child of seven,\r\nhad already commenced making rhymes less complicated, but not less\r\nambitious, than those which puzzled his readers sixty years later.\r\nGoethe, who had grown to manhood within earshot of Frederick the Great\r\nand of the Empress Maria Theresa, was living at Weimar with many years\r\nof life still before him, corresponding with the boy Mendelssohn, later\r\nto be a welcome guest, at Windsor, of the little Princess, then in\r\nher cradle in Kensington Palace. Mazzini, aged fourteen, was at the\r\nUniversity in Genoa, a rebellious lad, but already affecting the deep\r\nmourning dress he never altered later in life. Cavour, aged nine, was\r\nat school in Turin. Sir Thomas Lawrence was in that year engaged in\r\nfinishing his magnificent series of historical portraits afterwards to\r\nfind a home at Windsor Castle, illustrating for all time the Congress\r\nof Vienna and the story of the Great Coalition against Napoleon.\r\n\r\nUnder this galaxy of stars, some slowly sinking below the horizon, and\r\nothers just rising above it, Princess Victoria was born.\r\n\r\nIn the year following, King George III. died. Historians, mostly\r\npartisans of the Whig party, have not done this King justice. Of\r\nall Sovereigns who have ever reigned in England, none so completely\r\nrepresented the average man among his subjects. The King’s blameless\r\nmorals, his regular habits, his conservative instincts and narrow\r\nobstinacy, were characteristics which he shared with the people he\r\nruled. Of the House of Hanover he was the first King born in England,\r\nand he spoke his native tongue without a foreign accent. If he could\r\nhave reconciled it to the family tradition, he would have married an\r\nEnglish wife. He was essentially British in character and sentiment.\r\nHad he not been overborne by his Ministers, he would have fought out\r\nto a finish the war with America, and peace with Washington would not\r\nhave been concluded. He never for a moment contemplated abandoning the\r\nstruggle against Napoleon. No party whip could have taken more trouble\r\nto keep his chief in office than did George III. to support Mr. Pitt\r\nthroughout that Minister’s first administration. He has been called\r\ndespotic, but that adjective can only be used, in speaking of him,\r\nin the sense that he wished to see his views prevail. He was a good\r\npartisan fighter, and this, in the main, his subjects never disliked.\r\nA close and impartial examination of the character of George III.\r\ndiscloses a temperament strongly resembling that which her Ministers\r\nwere destined in the middle and later years of her reign to find in\r\nhis granddaughter. Strong tenacity of view and of purpose, a vivid\r\nsense of duty, a firm though unrevealed belief in the transcendental\r\nright of the Sovereign to rule, a curious mingling of etiquette and\r\ndomestic simplicity, and a high standard of domestic virtue were marked\r\ncharacteristics of George III. and of Queen Victoria. Both these\r\ndescendants of Princess Sophia had little in common with the Stewarts,\r\nbut, like Elizabeth and the Tudors, they had intense pride in England,\r\nand they showed a firm resolve to cherish and keep intact their mighty\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nWhen George III. died at Windsor in 1820, and during the ten following\r\nyears, Princess Victoria’s uncle, George IV., reigned as King. For the\r\nprevious ten years he had reigned as Prince Regent. If his father has\r\nbeen misjudged, this Sovereign too has been misrepresented by those\r\nwho have made it their business to write the political history of our\r\ncountry. He is generally described as being wholly bad, and devoid of\r\nany decent quality as a man and as a Sovereign. Decency perhaps was not\r\nhis strong point; but though it is not possible to esteem him as a man,\r\nGeorge IV. was not a bad King. In his youth, as Prince of Wales, in\r\nspite of glaring follies and many vices, he possessed a certain charm.\r\nWhen a boy he had broken loose from the over-strict and over-judicious\r\nwatchfulness of his parents. Kept in monotonous seclusion, cloistered\r\nwithin the narrow confines of a Palace, fettered by an Oriental system\r\nof domestic spies, cut off from intercourse with the intellectual\r\nmovement of the outer world, the royal children, warm-blooded and of\r\nrebellious spirit, ran secret riot after a fashion which modern memoirs\r\nhave revealed in Borgian colours. It was a natural reaction of young\r\nanimal life against unnatural and unhealthy restraint. The Prince of\r\nWales, when he was eighteen years old, was unwillingly and perforce\r\nliberated. It followed, simply enough, that he became a source of\r\nconstant grief and annoyance to his royal father. Not only were the\r\ncanons of morality violated by him with little regard for the outward\r\ndecorum due to his great position, but the young Prince plunged into a\r\nturgid sea of politics, and it was not long before he stood forth as\r\nthe nominal head of a faction bitterly opposed to the King’s Ministers,\r\nand the head and front of personal offence to the King himself.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of high society he was a Prince Charming, vicious if you\r\nwill, a spendthrift and a rake, the embodiment of a reactionary spirit\r\nagainst the dulness and monotonous respectability of the Court. He\r\nwas known to appreciate beautiful objects as well as beautiful faces.\r\nHe was not altogether without literary culture. He appeared to be\r\ninstinctively drawn to the arts and sciences with a full sense of the\r\njoy of patronage, and he made it clear to every one that he welcomed\r\nthe free intercourse of men of all ranks, provided that they possessed\r\nsome originality of character or some distinction of mind. In Mr. Fox\r\nhe found a willing mentor and an irresistible boon companion. Among\r\nthat little group of Whigs, of whom Sheridan was the ornament and\r\nthe disgrace, he found precisely the atmosphere which suited him, so\r\ncompletely was it the antithesis of that in which his boyhood had been\r\nspent. As he grew older, the rose-tinted vices of his youth became grey\r\nand unlovely, while the shortcomings of his mind and his heart were\r\nmore readily discerned; but much of his personal charm remained. In his\r\nmost degenerate days, in the years of his regency and kingship, when he\r\ndragged into the public eye the indecencies of his domestic misfortunes\r\nand paraded his mistresses before the world, he still managed to retain\r\na curious and genuine hold upon the affections of his Ministers.\r\nAlthough he possessed none of their regard, he was not altogether\r\nwithout some following among the people.\r\n\r\nGeorge IV.’s merits were a certain epicurean kindness of heart and a\r\nnot ungenerous desire to give pleasure, coupled with a true sense of\r\nhis constitutional position and a firm-drawn resolve to distinguish\r\nbetween his private predilections and his public duty. The nation owes\r\nhim very little, but in any case it owes him this, that he was the\r\nfirst Sovereign since Charles I. who showed a blundering reverence for\r\nbeautiful things. He enlarged and consolidated the artistic wealth of\r\nthe nation. A life-long patron of artists, he fostered the growth of\r\nnational art. He added largely to the splendid collections which now\r\nadorn Windsor and the metropolis. Whatever the final judgment passed\r\nupon him may be, both as a man and as a Sovereign, he must in strict\r\njustice be spared the unqualified contempt with which superior spirits,\r\ntaking their cue from Thackeray, have treated him. It should weigh\r\nwith every man who reads _The Four Georges_ that King George IV. was\r\ncertainly liked, and was certainly not despised, by Sir Walter Scott.\r\nIn his later years the old King displayed some little kindness to his\r\nniece, the young Princess Victoria, who had succeeded his own daughter\r\nas prospective heiress of England. If he saw her but rarely, he now\r\nand again betrayed knowledge of her existence, and once took her for a\r\ndrive in his pony-carriage. There are still extant some short letters\r\nwhich she wrote to him in a large baby hand. In 1830 he died, and was\r\nsucceeded by his brother the Duke of Clarence.\r\n\r\nWilliam IV. was the most fortunate of the children of George III.\r\nThanks to his profession as a sea-officer, he escaped early from the\r\nstifling atmosphere of the Court, and had the glorious privilege of\r\nserving under the command of Hood and of Nelson. His sea service ended\r\nwhen he was only twenty-five years old. It left the usual dominant\r\nsea-mark upon his character. Like so many gallant sailors, his mind was\r\nuntrained and ill-disciplined. His sense of duty was strong, though\r\nundiscerning. He was courageous and truthful. He had ten children by\r\nMrs. Jordan born out of wedlock, but they were all well cared for and\r\nnever disowned. He realised his constitutional duty sufficiently to\r\nsee that he must yield to the expressed will of the nation, but he\r\nyielded so clumsily that all men believed him to be coerced. Wisely\r\nanxious to be well known and popular among his subjects, he chose the\r\ncurious method of walking down St. James’s Street dressed in long\r\nboots and spurs during the most crowded hour of the afternoon. His\r\npredecessor had lived the last years of his life in seclusion and\r\nsilence; he determined therefore to give full scope to his naturally\r\ngarrulous disposition. He talked in season and out of season with an\r\nirresponsibility which savoured of the quarter-deck, but wholly without\r\nthe salt of the sea. By his Ministers he was regarded with kindliness,\r\nalthough it cannot be said, in spite of Lord Grey’s panegyric, that\r\nthey held him in much respect. By the middle classes he was looked upon\r\nwith amused and not unfriendly amazement. In the eyes of the masses he\r\nwas “Billy,” their sailor-King, and among monarchical safeguards there\r\nare few stronger than a nickname and the aureole of the Navy.\r\n\r\nWilliam IV. married late in life Princess Adelaide of\r\nSaxe-Coburg-Meiningen, but the fates left him with no surviving\r\nchildren when he ascended the Throne in 1830. During his reign of seven\r\nyears the King showed much kindness to the little niece who was clearly\r\ndesignated as his successor. Her mother, however, contrived to irritate\r\nhim by giving too much prominence to the obvious fact of her daughter’s\r\nheirship to the Throne. By “progresses” made on different occasions and\r\nundertaken with considerable ceremonial, the Duchess of Kent excited\r\nthe wrath of the King, who made no attempt to conceal his annoyance,\r\nand took evident pleasure in the display of it at embarrassing moments\r\nin public. It was partly owing to the friction between her mother and\r\nKing William and to the unpleasant atmosphere created in consequence of\r\nthese quarrels, and partly to the presence in her mother’s household\r\nof Sir John Conroy and his family—persons very distasteful to the\r\nyoung Princess—that Queen Victoria was in the habit of saying that her\r\nchildhood had been a sad one. These Journals, begun in her fourteenth\r\nyear, betray no sense of childish sorrow, and no reader can glean\r\nfrom them any confirmation of her statement that her early life was\r\nunhappy. It must be remembered, however, that this Journal was not\r\na sealed book. It was not privately put away under lock and key and\r\nreserved only for the eye of the writer. The young Princess’s Journals\r\nwere commenced in a volume given to her by her mother for the express\r\npurpose that she should record the facts of her daily life, and that\r\nthis record of facts and impressions should be open to the inspection\r\nof the child’s governess as well as of her mother. It is natural,\r\ntherefore, that the earlier volumes should contain very little beyond\r\nthe obvious and simple things which any girl would be likely to write\r\ndown if she were attempting to describe her life from day to day. When\r\nthe Princess ascended the Throne and assumed her queenly independence,\r\nthe tone of the Journals changes at once. It becomes immediately\r\nclear to the reader that while the Princess’s Journal was written for\r\nher mother, the Queen’s Journal was written for herself. One of her\r\nearliest entries after her succession was to state her intention of\r\ninvariably seeing her Ministers alone; and she might have added, had\r\nshe thought it worth stating, that her Journal also would in future be\r\nseen by her alone.\r\n\r\nJournals are often said to be useful to the historian. This theory\r\nis based on the assumption, hardly borne out by experience, that he\r\nwho writes a journal writes what is true. A journal is supposed to\r\nrecord events, great or small, which are happening at the moment,\r\nand to convey impressions about personages with whom the writer\r\ncomes in contact, or who loom sufficiently large to justify their\r\nbeing mentioned. When, however, it is remembered how inaccurate our\r\ninformation generally is, and how mistaken we often are about the\r\ncharacter and motives even of those we know intimately, it is not\r\nsurprising that the most brilliant diarist should frequently state\r\nfacts which cannot be verified from other sources, and colour the\r\npersonality of his contemporaries in a manner quite unjustifiable\r\nunless truth be deliberately sacrificed to the picturesque. The\r\nJournal of Charles Greville, perhaps the most famous of English modern\r\njournals, is full of gross inaccuracies in matters of fact and still\r\ngrosser distortions of character. It is, nevertheless, a striking\r\npicture of the political and social world haunted by that persistent\r\neavesdropper, and, like any well-written journal, throws a vivid and\r\ninteresting light upon the character of the writer.\r\n\r\nSimilar criticisms apply to most famous memoirs, like Saint-Simon’s\r\nor Lord Hervey’s, written with a view to serving the historian of the\r\nfuture, and with the distinct purpose of giving bias to history.\r\n\r\nThey do not apply to these diaries of Queen Victoria. The Queen makes\r\nno attempt to analyse character or the meaning of events. She never\r\nstrives after effect. Her statements are just homely descriptions\r\nof everyday life and plain references to the people she meets at\r\nKensington or at Windsor. If the young Princess sees a play that\r\npleases her or hears a song that touches her, she says so. If the Queen\r\nhears something said that strikes her as original or quaint, the saying\r\nis put on record. She is not writing for the historian. She writes for\r\nher own pleasure and amusement, although there is always present to her\r\nmind a vague idea, common enough at the time, that to “keep a journal”\r\nis in some undefined way an act of grace.\r\n\r\nThe reader should not lose sight of the fact that these Journals are\r\nthe simple impressions of a young girl, not twenty years old, about her\r\nown life and about the people she met. This constitutes their charm.\r\nShe writes of her daily movements, and of the men and happenings that\r\ngave her pleasure. Either by nature or design, she avoided the mention\r\nof disagreeable things, so that these early Journals give one a notion\r\nof a life happily and simply led.\r\n\r\nIf they throw no new light on the history of the period, they will give\r\nto future generations an insight, of never-failing interest, into the\r\ncharacter of the young Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nPrincess Victoria’s first Journal was commenced on August 1, 1832.\r\nShe was thirteen years old. The first entry is made in a small octavo\r\nvolume half bound in red morocco, of a very unpretentious kind.[1]\r\nOn the first page there appear the words, “This book Mamma gave me,\r\nthat I might write the journal of my journey to Wales in it.—Victoria,\r\nKensington Palace, July 31.”\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Kent was at this time forty-six years of age. She had\r\nbeen a widow for twelve years. She was the fourth daughter of the\r\nDuke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and was first married to the Prince of\r\nLeiningen-Dachburg-Hadenburg. He was twenty-three years her senior.\r\nBy him she had one son, Charles, often mentioned in these Journals,\r\nand one daughter Feodorowna, subsequently married to Ernest, Prince of\r\nHohenlohe-Langenburg.\r\n\r\nTwo years after her second marriage, to the fourth son of George III.,\r\nthe Duchess of Kent was left a widow for the second time. Crippled by\r\nthe Duke’s debts, that she was quite unable to pay,[2] with three young\r\nchildren on her hands, she was miserably poor. Her jointure yielded her\r\nan income of under £300. Her brother Leopold, then living at Claremont,\r\ncame to her assistance, and made her an allowance of £3,000 a year.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, when it became evident that her daughter Princess Victoria\r\nwould in all probability succeed to the Throne of England, Parliament\r\nvoted an annuity of £6,000 to the Duchess, for the maintenance and\r\neducation of her child, and this was subsequently increased after the\r\naccession of William IV.\r\n\r\nThe upbringing of her daughter became her absorbing occupation, and,\r\nshutting herself up in Kensington Palace, she devoted herself to the\r\nchild’s education.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of Princess Victoria’s childhood were superintended by the\r\nDean of Chester. Her education, judged by the standards of to-day,\r\nwas not of an exceptionally high order. It would be interesting to\r\nknow what old Roger Ascham would have thought of the Dean of Chester’s\r\ncurriculum. So far as can be gathered from her own childish records\r\nand from the correspondence and memoirs of those who had access to\r\nKensington, she was taught the ordinary things which children are\r\nsupposed to learn. Fortunately, perhaps, no effort of any special\r\nkind was made to train her mind or mould her character, with a view\r\nto the responsibilities which lay before her or to the position she\r\nappeared destined to fill. When, at a later stage, the Bishops of\r\nLondon and Lincoln were requested to draw up a report, for presentation\r\nto Parliament, upon her moral and intellectual attainments, they\r\nfound no difficulty in giving credit to the Duchess of Kent for the\r\nconscientious manner in which she had endeavoured to educate the\r\nheiress to the Throne. We may, however, take leave to doubt whether\r\nthose entrusted with the Princess’s education were teachers endowed\r\nwith any special aptitudes; and it is certain that the outlook of\r\nthe Duchess herself, although practical and wise, was not of that\r\ndiscerning character which enabled her to differentiate between a\r\ncommonplace education and its more subtle forms. It was precisely what\r\nmight have been expected from one whose youth had been spent in a small\r\nGerman Court, and whose later opportunities had not brought her into\r\ncontact with highly trained and thoughtful minds.\r\n\r\nA foreign observer and critic once suggested a doubt whether the Queen\r\ncould have maintained through life her admirable mental equilibrium if\r\neducation had developed in her high intellectual curiosity or fantastic\r\nimagination. It is an interesting speculation. Soundness of judgment\r\npossibly rests upon the receptive rather than upon the creative\r\nfaculties, and upon physical rather than upon intellectual activities.\r\nIt may, as has been said, require a rare type of intelligence—that of\r\nDisraeli—to combine ideas and dreams with the realities of public life.\r\nIn the domain of learning, Queen Victoria had very little in common\r\nwith Elizabeth or with any Sovereign of the Renaissance. Her mother and\r\nthe worthy Dean, who watched over her youth, were content to foster the\r\nquality of good sense, and to inculcate high standards of private and\r\npublic virtue. Her future subjects, could they have been consulted,\r\nwould have strongly approved. In after-years the English middle-class\r\nrecognised in the Queen a certain strain of German sentimentality which\r\nthey affectionately condoned, and a robust equilibrium of mind which\r\nthey thoroughly admired.\r\n\r\nIt is as well, therefore, that events took the shape they did, and\r\nthat the mind and character of the Princess were trained upon simple\r\nlines in accordance with the practice of the average citizen families\r\nsubsequently to be her subjects. In years to come the Queen was perhaps\r\nbetter able to look at events and persons from the point of view\r\nof the majority of her people than would have been possible if her\r\neducation had given her a high place among the intellectuals. It was a\r\nsaving grace throughout her long reign that while she could recognise\r\nintellect and capacity, her sympathies were with average people, whose\r\nfeelings and opinions she more readily understood and in reality\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nIn these days, when Accomplishments, as they were called in the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century, are no longer esteemed in young people,\r\nand their place has been usurped by athletic exercises, it is difficult\r\nto describe, in a way that appeals to the serious imagination, the\r\ngirlish tastes of Princess Victoria. Perhaps the world has not lost\r\nmuch because young ladies to-day learn to play golf and have ceased to\r\nsing duets.\r\n\r\nIn the thirties, music and painting and a knowledge of modern languages\r\nwere the necessary equipment of a girl destined to move in Society.\r\nIt mattered little how reedy and small the voice, she was expected to\r\nvocalise like Grisi and to sing duets with Mario.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had been well trained musically, according to the lights\r\nof those days. She could appreciate the simpler forms of melody,\r\nespecially Italian opera, while she could sing and play sufficiently\r\nwell to give much pleasure to herself and mild pleasure to others. As a\r\nlinguist, as a reader, and as a writer of letters and memoranda she had\r\nno pretensions to pre-eminence; but she could speak modern languages as\r\nwell as any Queen is called upon to do, she could read and appreciate\r\nhigh literature, although not without effort, and she could express\r\nherself with pungency and vigour, although not with any marked literary\r\nskill or distinction of style.\r\n\r\nHer drawings and water-colour sketches were through life a constant\r\nsource of happiness to the Queen. There are at Windsor literally\r\nhundreds of small sketch-books, containing reminiscences of her\r\njourneys and sojournings in Scotland and in Italy, again not of high\r\nartistic merit, but sufficiently vital to suggest the reflection that\r\na young lady of to-day is possibly no gainer by having substituted the\r\ngolf-club for the pencil.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s teachers were excellent, commonplace people, and they\r\nleft precisely those traces on her mind that might have been expected.\r\nHer character was another matter. They could not and did not influence\r\nthat, and it is the character of the Queen that places her in the small\r\ncategory of rulers who have not only deserved well of their country,\r\nbut have left an indelible stamp upon the life of their people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThese Journals were commenced in the year 1832, a year memorable in our\r\nhistory for the fruition of hopes deeply cherished by the political\r\nparty that had arisen, under the auspices of Canning, after the close\r\nof the struggle with Napoleon.\r\n\r\nDuring the year when the first Reform Bill became the law of the land,\r\nthe passions of men had been deeply stirred throughout Great Britain.\r\nThe political struggle, begun seventeen years before, had come to a\r\nhead. The classes still paramount had found themselves face to face\r\nwith the desires and aspirations of classes hitherto subordinate to\r\nhave a share in the government of the country. These feelings had grown\r\nfiercer year by year, and, encouraged by the Whig party headed by\r\nEarl Grey, had found ultimate expression in the Reform Bill of 1832,\r\nframed under the ægis of that Minister. All over Europe the stream of\r\nchange and reform, loosed by the French Revolution and subsequently\r\nchecked by the Congress of Vienna, began once more to flow. During the\r\nsixteen years that followed Princess Victoria’s first entry in these\r\nJournals, the waters of Revolution had flooded Europe. Thrones and\r\ninstitutions in every European country were shaken, many of them to\r\ntheir foundations, and some with disastrous results. Fortunately for\r\nGreat Britain, her statesmen had anticipated the events of 1848, and\r\nthe Reform Bill had so far satisfied the aspirations of the hitherto\r\nunenfranchised classes as to render innocuous the frothing of agitators\r\nduring that tragic year of revolution. In aptitude for anticipating\r\nsocial and political change and avoiding violent manifestations of\r\npopular will, the English race stands pre-eminent. Our people as well\r\nas our statesmen have from the earliest times proved themselves to\r\nbe experts in the art of government, and the history of Europe is a\r\ncommentary upon that gift of the British nation.\r\n\r\nThere have, of course, been moments when the atmosphere of politics\r\nhas been highly charged with electricity. Such a moment occurred in\r\n1832. A storm broke with unusual violence over the head of William IV.\r\nThe House of Lords was bitterly hostile to a Bill, accepted by the\r\nHouse of Commons and supported with enthusiasm by the majority of his\r\nsubjects. There was no machinery existing under the Constitution for\r\nadjusting these differences except that of creating a sufficient number\r\nof Peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill through the House of\r\nLords. The King therefore found himself in the unpleasant position of\r\nhaving to place his prerogative of creating peers in the hands of his\r\nMinisters, or else by his own act to dispense with their services.\r\nThe choice found him undecided and left him baffled. He was not acute\r\nenough to see that in the existing state of public opinion he had no\r\nchoice. If he had possessed wit to read the signs of the times, it is\r\ndoubtful whether he would have had sufficient single-minded courage to\r\ntake immediate action in accordance with the opinion he had formed.\r\nPenetrating vision the King lacked, and responsibility was distasteful\r\nto him. Consequently he was not only weak, but he showed weakness.\r\nIt was clear that the Government of Lord Grey held unimpaired the\r\nconfidence of the House of Commons and possessed the full approval of\r\nthe country. Every intelligent observer realised that the Reform Bill,\r\nin spite of its aristocratic foes, in spite of the prophets of evil,\r\nand in spite of its inherent defects, was bound to be passed into law.\r\nKing William, however, conceived it to be his duty to endeavour to\r\nfind an alternative Government. It was as certain as anything could\r\nbe in politics, that Sir Robert Peel would not, and that the Duke of\r\nWellington could not, come to his assistance. There was something\r\npitiful about the spectacle of the old sailor-King casting about for a\r\nsafe anchorage, and finding one cable parting after another. Security\r\nwas only to be found in the Ministers who had advised him, in the last\r\nresort, to use his prerogative for the purpose of swamping a majority\r\nin the House of Lords that hesitated to bow to the will of the people.\r\nUltimately he was constrained to accept their advice, but it was only\r\nafter a loss of personal dignity and a distinct weakening of the\r\nauthority of the Crown. The King, men said, had touted about to find\r\nMinisters to serve him, and had failed to find them. This humiliation,\r\nat least, King William might have avoided, had he possessed a clearer\r\nvision of possibilities and greater firmness of character.\r\n\r\nThe political storms of 1832 appear to have broken noiselessly against\r\nthe walls of Kensington Palace, for in the little Princess’s Journals\r\nthere is no sign that she was aware of them. The King’s worries,\r\nhowever, so affected his temper, that it was impossible for the\r\nPrincess and her mother not to feel its reflex action. In the Journals\r\nno mention is made of the domestic troubles which have been described\r\nelsewhere, and we know, from expressions of Queen Victoria’s in later\r\nyears, that she had purposely refrained, in compiling her Journals,\r\nfrom referring to her mother’s worries and her own.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years that immediately preceded Princess Victoria’s\r\naccession to the Throne, from 1832 to 1836, these Journals give us\r\nthe picture of a young life passed amid the tranquil surroundings of\r\nKensington Palace, its educational monotony only varied by attendance\r\nat the opera or the theatre, by autumnal trips into the provinces,\r\nor by welcome visits from foreign cousins. These autumnal trips were\r\nthe “royal progresses,” as he called them, against which King William\r\nwas wont to protest in vehement language. They evidently gave intense\r\npleasure to the Princess. Her Journals contain records of them all.\r\nSome examples have been given, in these extracts, of her method of\r\ndescribing her visits to provincial cities and towns, to seaside\r\nsummer resorts, and to a few of the great homes of those who were\r\nafterwards to be her Ministers or subjects.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that she got her first glimpse of the Isle\r\nof Wight, where so much of her life was afterwards to be spent. The\r\nfact that Sir John Conroy, whom she disliked, lived for many years\r\nat Osborne Lodge seems not to have prevented her from subsequently\r\nbecoming deeply attached to that quiet home amid beautiful surroundings\r\ncreated by her and Prince Albert upon the site where Osborne Lodge had\r\nstood. Whippingham Church, to be so closely connected with her and her\r\nchildren, was first visited in the year 1833.\r\n\r\nEnough has been included in these extracts to show her liking for the\r\nopera and for the theatre, her pleasure in music, her devotion to the\r\npursuit of riding, and that love for animals which characterised her\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\nWhen she was sixteen she went to Ascot for the first time, and\r\nfigured in the royal procession. It began to be recognised that the\r\nyoung Princess had passed the threshold of girlhood. In that year\r\nher Confirmation took place at the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, and\r\nArchbishop Howley, believed to be the last prelate who wore a wig,\r\nofficiated. During the autumn she visited Yorkshire and stayed with\r\nArchbishop Harcourt at Bishopthorpe and with Lord Fitzwilliam at\r\nWentworth. Coming south, she was the guest of the Duke of Rutland at\r\nBelvoir, of Lord Exeter at Burghley, and of Lord Leicester at Holkham.\r\nIn the following year, 1836, she met for the first time her cousin\r\nPrince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. He and his elder brother Ernest visited\r\nKensington Palace at the instance of her uncle Leopold. The fact that\r\nPrince Albert had been thought of years before by the King of the\r\nBelgians as a possible husband for Princess Victoria was sufficient\r\nto set King William IV. against the match. The King, however, was not\r\nuncivil to the brothers when they visited London, but he had ideas of\r\nhis own about the future of his niece, and he tried hard to lay the\r\nfoundations of an alliance between the young Princess and the younger\r\nson of the Prince of Orange. Prince Albert on this occasion made no\r\ndeep impression upon Princess Victoria’s mind or heart, but her loyalty\r\nto her uncle Leopold and her regard for his opinion led her to show\r\nthe graceful young Coburg Prince marked preference over the somewhat\r\nungainly candidate of King William. Her heart was clearly untouched,\r\nbut she was willing to be guided by the advice of that counsellor and\r\nfriend to whom in preference to every one she had already begun to\r\nturn for help and guidance. As this became obvious to King William,\r\nhis jealousy and dislike for the Duchess of Kent increased; and in the\r\nautumn of this year, 1836, having invited his sister-in-law to a state\r\nbanquet, he scandalised Society by delivering an after-dinner speech\r\ncharged with recrimination and insult to his guest.\r\n\r\nThis was the Princess’s penultimate year as a minor. King William had\r\nfor a long time been haunted with the fear that he would die before his\r\nniece came of age, and that a regency would devolve upon his hated\r\nsister-in-law. He was spared what he would have considered this final\r\nhumiliation, for on May 24, 1837, the young Princess came of age, just\r\na month before the King died at Windsor.\r\n\r\nDuring the final years of her minority she was thrown freely into the\r\nsociety of many of the eminent and distinguished persons soon to be her\r\nsubjects. The Duchess gave a series of entertainments at Kensington\r\nPalace, and the Princess was brought into contact with her mother’s\r\nguests. Accounts of these dinners and concerts, and full lists of the\r\nguests, are all minutely recorded in the Journals. Comments, however,\r\nbeyond an occasional expression of delight at the music and admiration\r\nfor its performers, are excluded. Her life was still the life of a\r\nchild, and her days were mostly spent with her preceptors, under the\r\nauspices of the Duchess of Northumberland, her official governess, and\r\nof the Dean of Chester, her tutor.\r\n\r\nShe had been parted some years before from her half brother and sister\r\nby the usual exigencies of time. Prince Charles of Leiningen had become\r\na sea-officer, and Princess Feodore was married. Into the inner orbit\r\nof her young life there penetrated only Sir John Conroy, whose person\r\nwas odious to her, and Baroness Lehzen, the daughter of a Hanoverian\r\nclergyman, who had been the Princess’s governess since 1824, and to\r\nwhom she was deeply attached. Lablache, her singing-master, a man of\r\nsome originality and charm, was a constant source of interest and\r\namusement to the young Princess, and she preferred his lessons to all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt was during these last few years before her accession that the final\r\ntouches were given to her character by the subtle influences of her\r\nenvironment. The position occupied by Sir John Conroy in her mother’s\r\nhouse inspired and fortified her subsequent resolve to avoid intimacies\r\nwith members of her household. She became distant and reserved to\r\nthose about her, and her relations with her mother were chilled. Her\r\nmind acquired an impression that family ties, however binding from the\r\npoint of view of duty, might be superseded by those of friendship. It\r\nis undoubtedly the case that Baroness Lehzen occupied at this time\r\nthe first place in her pupil’s thoughts and affections; while the\r\ndawning necessity felt by Princess Victoria for sympathy, and for those\r\nintimate communings so attractive to sentimental natures, had a very\r\ndistinct influence upon the mind and conduct of the Queen in subsequent\r\nyears. Her Journals afford proof, if proof had been wanting, that, in\r\nspite of the opinions of her attainments vouchsafed by eminent clerics,\r\nthe Princess had not been afforded an education specially designed to\r\nfit her for the situation she was to occupy.\r\n\r\nShe was, at eighteen, as moderately and indifferently equipped as the\r\naverage girl of her age. If her conversation was not brilliant, her\r\nheart was kindly and her judgment sound. She was shrewd and eminently\r\ntruthful. In spite of her small stature, she was curiously dignified\r\nand impressive. Her voice was musical and carried far. And above all\r\nthings, her rectitude was unassailable, and her sense of duty so\r\nkeen and high that it supplied any lack of imagination or spiritual\r\ndeficiency. She was humble-minded, but not, perhaps, very tender. She\r\nwas passionate and imperious, but always faithful. She was supremely\r\nconscious of the responsibilities and prerogatives of her calling,\r\nwhich she was convinced, then and always, were her appanage by the gift\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in her Journals or elsewhere to show that before she\r\nwas eighteen years old she had ever talked seriously and at any length\r\nto any man or woman of exceptional gifts. It was only when her uncle\r\nKing Leopold heard of the illness of William IV. that Stockmar was\r\ninstructed to speak with due gravity upon important matters to the\r\nyoung girl whose accession to the Throne appeared imminent. Her mind\r\nat that time was a blank page in so far as questions of high politics\r\nor of administration were concerned. In point of fact, this was a\r\nfortunate circumstance, and rendered easier the task of those who were\r\nbound in the nature of things, and under the constitution of these\r\nislands, to use this youthful Princess as one of the chief instruments\r\nof government. Her mind was free from any political bias or complexion,\r\nand ready to receive the impress of her constitutional Ministers. When,\r\nwithin less than a month of her eighteenth birthday, King William\r\ndied, and when on June 20, 1837, the Queen found herself face to face\r\nwith those Whig statesmen in whose hands the destinies of the country\r\nhad been placed for the time being, their task was unhampered by\r\npreconceived ideas or by foregone prejudice in their pupil. For the\r\nQueen a new chapter of life was opened. She at once threw off the\r\ntrammels of pupilage. Not only was she able immediately and without\r\neffort to shake herself clear of the domestic influences she had\r\nresented and disliked, but for the first time she was enabled to meet\r\nand to question distinguished men, with whose names she was familiar,\r\nbut whose standards of thought and conversation were far higher than\r\nany to which she had been accustomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nIt was “in a palace in a garden, meet scene for youth and innocence,”\r\nas one in later years to be her favoured Minister wrote, that Princess\r\nVictoria received the news of her accession to a Throne overlooking\r\n“every sea and nations in every zone.” The scene and the circumstances\r\nin which her accession was announced to her by the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and Lord Conynghame are described by the Queen in her\r\nJournal. She has also recorded her impressions of what followed when\r\nfor the first time she met the Privy Council. What the Queen has not\r\ndescribed is the effect produced upon those present by her personality,\r\nher youthful charm, her self-possession and perfect modesty, in such\r\nstrong contrast to everything which her Privy Councillors had been\r\naccustomed to find in their former Sovereigns. The Queen was not\r\naware of the interest and curiosity she then excited in the minds of\r\nher subjects. She had been brought up in such comparative seclusion,\r\nthat both to “Society” and to the great world outside her character\r\nwas an enigma and even her appearance very little known. Her sex and\r\nyouth rendered her personality exciting to a public satiated with the\r\nelderly vagaries of her uncles. It was noticed at her first Council\r\nthat her manner was very graceful and engaging. It was particularly\r\nobserved that after she had read her speech in a clear and singularly\r\nfirm voice, when the two surviving sons of George III., the Dukes of\r\nCumberland and Sussex, knelt before her, swearing allegiance, she\r\nblushed up to the eyes as if she felt the contrast between their public\r\nand private relations, between their august age and her inexperienced\r\nyouth. It was also noticed that she spoke to no one, and that not the\r\nsmallest difference in her manner could be detected, even by sharp\r\nwatching eyes, between her attitude towards Lord Melbourne and the\r\nMinisters on the one hand, and towards the Duke of Wellington and Sir\r\nRobert Peel on the other. The Queen does not mention, for she was not\r\nthen aware of it, that Lord Melbourne was charmed and Sir Robert Peel\r\namazed at her demeanour. They spoke afterwards with emotion of her\r\nmodesty, firmness, and evident deep sense of her situation. She did not\r\nknow then, although she knew later, that the Duke of Wellington said\r\nthat had she been his own daughter he could not have desired to see her\r\nperform her part better.\r\n\r\nThese Journals only accentuate what is already known from many\r\nsources, that the Queen showed in difficult circumstances not only\r\ngood taste and good feeling, but admirable good sense. Her attention\r\nto details, which some might consider trifles, but which differentiate\r\nthe careful from the thoughtless mind, was noticed with approval and\r\nsurprise by her Ministers. She exhibited caution in her treatment of\r\nthose persons who had been about her since childhood, and she made\r\nno appeal to any of them for advice or guidance. Nor did she permit\r\nadvice to be proffered. Sir John Conroy was dismissed at once from\r\nher surroundings. Baroness Lehzen she retained, as before, about\r\nher person, and she speaks of her, throughout these Journals, with\r\ndeep feeling. It was noticed, whenever she was asked to decide some\r\ndifficult matter, her customary reply was that she would think it over,\r\nand give her answer on the morrow. Onlookers, knowing that she relied\r\non the advice of Lord Melbourne, generally assumed that she referred\r\nto him in the interval. He, however, declared that to many of his\r\nquestions a similar reply was given. In point of fact, she was obeying\r\none of the precepts of her uncle, the King of the Belgians.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious to the readers of this book that a potent influence\r\nover the mind and actions of the young Queen was exercised by Lord\r\nMelbourne. It was the natural outcome of the business relation between\r\na very charming and experienced man of the world who happened to be\r\nher Prime Minister and a very young girl isolated in the solitary\r\natmosphere of the Throne. From the Queen’s accession to the day of\r\nher marriage the table-talk of Lord Melbourne fills the largest space\r\nin her journals. Her description of their intercourse confirms what we\r\nknow from other sources, that Lord Melbourne became absorbed by the\r\nnovel and striking duty that had fallen to his lot. His temperament and\r\nhis antecedents rendered him peculiarly sensitive to the fascinating\r\ninfluences of the strange relation in which he stood to this young\r\nQueen. Lord Melbourne’s life had been chequered by curious experiences,\r\nand his mind had been thoroughly well trained, for a man of his\r\nstation, according to the lights of those days. A classical education,\r\nthe privilege from youth upwards of free intercourse with every one\r\nworth knowing, the best Whig connection, and an inherited capacity for\r\ngoverning men under oligarchic institutions, had equipped his intellect\r\nand judgment with everything that was necessary to enable him carefully\r\nto watch and safeguard the blossoming of the character of the girl who\r\nwas both his pupil and his Sovereign.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer young, but he was not old. His person was attractive.\r\nAccording to Leslie, no mean judge, his head was a truly noble one,\r\nand he was a fine specimen of manly beauty in the meridian of life.\r\nNot only were his features handsome, but his expression was in the\r\nhighest degree intellectual. His laugh was frequent and the most joyous\r\npossible, his voice so deep and musical that to hear him say the most\r\nordinary thing was a pleasure; and his frankness, his freedom from\r\naffectation, and his peculiar humour rendered almost everything he\r\nsaid, however easy and natural, quite original. Chantrey’s bust and\r\nthe well-known portraits of Melbourne corroborate the descriptions\r\ngiven by his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s Journals afford us some illustrations of the extent of\r\nhis memory and reading. In his knowledge of political history he was\r\nunsurpassed by any living Englishman, and among the statesmen of that\r\nday there were none by age, character, and experience so well qualified\r\nfor the task of making the Queen acquainted with the art of government,\r\nor better able to give her a correct interpretation of the laws and\r\nspirit of the constitution. He understood perfectly the importance\r\nof training her to work straightforwardly but secretly with that\r\nsmall committee of active politicians, representing the parliamentary\r\nmajority of the day, which goes by the name of the Cabinet. Sir Robert\r\nPeel and the Duke of Wellington, the Leaders of the Opposition, felt\r\nand admitted that for her initiation into the mysteries of Kingcraft,\r\nthe Queen could not have been in wiser hands. It will be obvious from\r\nthese Journals that the Queen drifted into political partisanship.\r\nShe lived in dread of losing her Whig Ministers, and she got “to\r\nhate” the Tories. This only meant—and under all the circumstances it\r\nwas natural—that she ardently desired to retain her mentor at her\r\nside. It is to the credit of Lord Melbourne that he was constantly\r\ndiscouraging his Sovereign’s bias towards the Whig Party, of which he\r\nwas the head, and that he never lost an opportunity of smoothing the\r\nway for the advent of Sir Robert Peel which he knew to be inevitable.\r\nHe was, not inaptly, called a Regius Professor with no professorial\r\ndisqualifications, and it was precisely from this point of view that\r\nthe Tory leaders recognised the indispensable nature of his task, and\r\napproved his manner of performing it. He was a Whig no doubt, says his\r\nbiographer, but at any rate he was an honest-hearted Englishman, and,\r\nin no merely conventional sense, a gentleman on whose perfect honour no\r\none hesitated to place reliance.\r\n\r\nHe treated the Queen with unbounded consideration and respect, yet he\r\ndid not hesitate to administer reproof. He consulted her tastes and her\r\nwishes, but he checked her inclination to be headstrong and arbitrary.\r\nHe knew well how to chide with parental firmness, but he did so with a\r\ndeference that could not fail to fascinate any young girl in a man of\r\nhis age and attainments. The Queen was completely under his charm. The\r\nease of his frank and natural manners, his quaint epigrams and humorous\r\nparadox, his romantic bias and worldly shrewdness, were magnified by\r\nher into the noblest manly virtues.\r\n\r\nHe saw her every day, but never appeared to weary of her society.\r\nShe certainly never tired of his. Yet he was fifty-eight years old,\r\na time-worn politician, and she was a girl of eighteen. He was her\r\nconfidential servant and at the same time her guardian. She was his\r\nward and at the same time his Sovereign. The situation was full of the\r\npossibilities of drama, yet nothing can be more delightful than the\r\nhigh comedy revealed in the passages of the Journals that refer to Lord\r\nMelbourne. That he should have happened to be First Minister of the\r\nCrown when King William died was a rare piece of good fortune for the\r\nnew Sovereign and for the country. With all the immense powers of head\r\nand heart which the Queen came later to discover in Sir Robert Peel,\r\nwe may take leave to doubt if he could so lightly and so wisely have\r\nassumed and fulfilled the duties imposed upon his predecessor.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the effect produced upon the mind and\r\ncharacter of the Queen by the apostolic letters of her uncle. Even the\r\nsound constitutional dogma of Stockmar might have failed to influence\r\none naturally inclined to be autocratic. Those, however, who were to\r\nreap the profit in later years of the shrewd daily culture of the\r\nQueen’s mind, of the skilful pruning away of ideas dangerous in a\r\nBritish Sovereign, of the respectful explanation of her duties, of the\r\nhumorous rallying upon slight weaknesses which might have developed\r\ninto awkward habits, were deeply indebted, as these Journals show, to\r\nthe sagacity of Lord Melbourne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nTwo Queens Regnant, Queen Mary and Queen Anne, both of Stewart blood,\r\nlived much at Kensington Palace, and both died there. As a place of\r\nresidence it had no attractions for the Sovereigns of the House of\r\nHanover. Queen Victoria was fond of the old wing in which her youth had\r\nbeen spent, and which was subsequently occupied for many years by the\r\nDuchess of Teck and her children. Built on piles, those portions of the\r\nPalace that were uninhabited, and therefore indifferently looked after,\r\nhad towards the end of the Queen’s reign fallen into such disrepair\r\nthat their demolition had been decided by the Treasury. The Queen\r\ndisliked intensely the idea of removing any part of the old building.\r\nUltimately a bargain was made with the Chancellor of the Exchequer of\r\nthe day. It involved a certain exchange of houses in the gift of the\r\nCrown and some shifting of financial responsibility. Kensington Palace\r\nwas saved, and a considerable sum was voted by Parliament for its\r\nrestoration, on condition that the public should be admitted to certain\r\nrooms of historic interest.\r\n\r\nKing George’s dream, and no one knows better its visionary character,\r\nis to pull down Buckingham Palace, to round off St. James’s and the\r\nGreen Parks at Constitution Hill and Buckingham Gate, and then, with\r\nthe money obtained by the sale of the Gardens of Buckingham Palace, to\r\nreconstruct Kensington Palace as the town residence of the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nFor Queen Mary the place is full of memories and, because of her keen\r\nhistoric sense, full of interest.\r\n\r\nCompared with most of the great European capitals, London is poor in\r\npalaces. The homes of the Tudor Sovereigns in and near the metropolis,\r\nNonsuch, Greenwich, and Whitehall, have disappeared. London contains\r\nno single palace residentially associated with our long line of\r\nSovereigns. The Court of St. James was housed, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, in the Palace of that name. It seems to have been adequate\r\nfor the needs of the Hanoverian Princes, who had none of the amplitude\r\nof the Tudors or the fine taste of the Stewarts.\r\n\r\nThe memories of Windsor, however, are long memories. Although Queen\r\nVictoria never liked Windsor, perhaps because she was never in good\r\nhealth there, it is with Windsor Castle that the principal events\r\nof her reign are associated. The thoughts of the few, the very few,\r\ncomparatively speaking, of her subjects who were admitted to the\r\nseclusion of Court life during two-thirds of the Queen’s reign may\r\ncarry them back to quiet days at Balmoral or Osborne, but it was round\r\nWindsor that the political interest of the Victorian era centred. There\r\nthe links of the chain have remained unsevered between the Sovereigns\r\nof Great Britain to-day and their Plantagenet ancestors.\r\n\r\nIf the Queen’s attachment to Windsor was not deep, she was more\r\nindifferent still to Buckingham Palace. There is not a word in her\r\nDiaries or correspondence to show that she in any way looked upon it as\r\na home or even a residence in any degree interesting or attractive. No\r\nattempt was made, after the death of the Prince Consort, to improve or\r\nbeautify it. The magnificent objects of art and the splendid collection\r\nof pictures were badly displayed and quite unappreciated. Few, outside\r\nthe circle of the Court, knew of their existence. The Palace was judged\r\nby its mean façade, and the nation was rather shamefaced about the home\r\nof its Sovereign, and certainly took no credit for the really noble\r\nrooms and their contents which Buckingham Palace contains.\r\n\r\nYet, through the picture-gallery of this Palace hung with masterpieces\r\nof the Dutch School, through the throne-room and the drawing-room\r\nresplendent with the royal portraits of Reynolds and Gainsborough, or\r\nthrough the matchless corridor at Windsor, have passed nearly all the\r\ngreat figures of the nineteenth century, practically the whole of which\r\nwas spanned by the life of the Queen.\r\n\r\nIt is an imposing array, worthy of its setting. Heroes and statesmen,\r\nmen of science and letters, artists and scholars, all moved, with\r\na feeling of awe, into the presence of the Queen whose girlhood is\r\nrecounted by herself in these pages.\r\n\r\nTo those accustomed to the easier manners of more recent times it is\r\ndifficult to convey a sense of the atmosphere of Windsor during the\r\nreign of the Queen. Her extraordinary aloofness was its determining\r\ncause, but the effect was that of a shrine. Grave men walked softly\r\nthrough the rooms of the Castle, and no voice was ever raised. The\r\npresence of the Sovereign brooded, so to speak, over the Palace and\r\nits environment. The desire to be negligently at ease never entered\r\nthe mind. The air was rarefied by a feeling that somewhere, in a\r\nregion unvisited by any but the most highly privileged, was seated,\r\nnot in an ordinary arm-chair, but on a throne, the awe-inspiring\r\nand ever-dignified figure of the Sovereign. The proud intellect of\r\nGladstone and the rugged self-sufficiency of Bright bent before the\r\nsmall, homely figure in widow’s weeds. In spite of this homeliness of\r\nappearance, notwithstanding her love of simplicity and her dislike of\r\ntawdriness and display, her spirit never put aside the regal habit.\r\nHow rarely the Queen extended her hand! It was a great privilege, and\r\nonly on special occasions vouchsafed to her Ministers. Men and women\r\nbent very low to kiss that hand. This was not due to her small stature,\r\nbut to the curious, indefinable awe that she undoubtedly inspired\r\nduring the later portion of her life in all who approached her. Will\r\nthe reader find, in these records of her girlhood, intimations of that\r\nmoral ascendency she afterwards acquired over her subjects?\r\n\r\nIt was unquestionably a triumph of character. Even now to attempt a\r\nserious estimate of the intellectual capacity of Queen Victoria is a\r\ndifficult task. There are too many still among us the greater part of\r\nwhose lives were spent under her sway. It is a fault in nearly all\r\nrecent biographies that they attempt appreciations which only the lapse\r\nof time can enable a writer to draw in true perspective.\r\n\r\nA venerable Sovereign, in full possession of his great powers of\r\nintellect and character, who was almost an exact contemporary, still\r\nrules a European people as proud of him as were her subjects of the\r\nQueen. At least one of her faithful servants, who was present at\r\nher Coronation seventy-four years ago and at every great ceremonial\r\nthroughout her reign, is still alive and full of manly vigour. Her\r\nchildren are in the prime of life, and her favourite grandson is the\r\nbeloved Sovereign of the people she governed. Unqualified praise is\r\nalways distasteful, and critical analysis may easily prove to be in\r\nsingularly bad taste. Queen Victoria’s womanly and royal virtues are\r\nwritten in golden letters upon the face of the vast Empire over which\r\nshe reigned. Her faults may well lie buried, for some time yet, in her\r\ngrave under the shadow of Windsor.\r\n\r\nIn the muniment-room of the Castle are preserved the private records of\r\nher life-work. Over a thousand bound volumes of letters, from and to\r\nthe Queen upon all subjects, public and domestic, are there; and over a\r\nhundred volumes of her Journals written in her own hand.\r\n\r\nIt is a unique record. The private papers of George III. have\r\ndisappeared. Of those of George IV. and William IV., only a few are in\r\nexistence. Selections from the correspondence of the Queen up to 1861\r\nwere published by permission of King Edward. These selections from her\r\nearly Journals have been made by the gracious leave of King George. It\r\nmay be many years before it would be wise or prudent to make public\r\nany more of the private history of Queen Victoria’s reign. Those who,\r\nby good fortune, have had access to these records can, however, safely\r\npredict that whatever hereafter leaps to light, the Queen never can be\r\nshamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  When the Queen’s Journal opens she was thirteen years and two\r\n  months old. When she was four years younger Sir Walter Scott was\r\n  presented to the little Princess Victoria and noted that she was\r\n  “educating with much care.” At that time she was supposed not to\r\n  know that she was the “heir of England,” but Scott thought that\r\n  if the little heart could be dissected it would be found that\r\n  some little bird had carried the matter. According to Baroness\r\n  Lehzen, the truth was not revealed until a year before the Princess\r\n  commenced to write her first Journal. There was a picture painted\r\n  of her about this time, and it corroborates Lord Albemarle’s\r\n  description of the little girl of extreme fairness whom he watched\r\n  watering, at Kensington, a child’s garden, wearing a large straw\r\n  hat and a suit of white cotton, her only ornament being a coloured\r\n  fichu round the neck.\r\n\r\n  The Princess was guarded with extreme care. Leigh Hunt noticed that\r\n  she was invariably followed, when walking, by a footman in gorgeous\r\n  raiment. She told her daughters many years later that she was so\r\n  carefully tended until the day of her accession, that she had never\r\n  been permitted to walk downstairs without someone holding her hand.\r\n\r\n  The Princess’s journey commenced August 1, 1832, although the first\r\n  part of what her Uncle, King William, called her Royal Progresses\r\n  was not her first trip into the country. With her mother she paid\r\n  several visits to Ramsgate and Broadstairs. She had stayed with\r\n  Lord Winchelsea at Eastwell, near Ashford, and she had visited\r\n  George IV. at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Park. She had spent an\r\n  autumn at Norris Castle, Isle of Wight, and had been to Bath and\r\n  Malvern.\r\n\r\n  Sir Walter Scott expressed a hope that she would not retain the\r\n  name of Victoria, and when upon the accession of William IV. extra\r\n  provision was demanded of Parliament for the little Princess\r\n  Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, who then became heir-presumptive to\r\n  the Crown, Sir Matthew White Ridley and Sir Robert Inglis desired\r\n  to make the Parliamentary grant contingent upon the Princess, as\r\n  Queen, assuming the style of Elizabeth II., on the ground that the\r\n  name Victoria did not accord with the feelings of the people. The\r\n  name Victoria, however, was destined to acquire lustre not inferior\r\n  to that of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  The Princess’s first Progress is minutely described in the first\r\n  volume of her Journal. Before it ended, Robert Lowe, afterwards\r\n  her Chancellor of the Exchequer, caught a glimpse of the child as\r\n  she passed from the Bodleian to lunch with the Vice-Chancellor at\r\n  Oxford. Her foot was on the threshold of public life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                                 1832\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, August 1st._ We left K.P.[3] at 6 minutes past 7 and went\r\nthrough the Lower-field gate to the right. We went on, & turned to the\r\nleft by the new road to Regent’s Park. The road & scenery is beautiful.\r\n20 minutes to 9. We have just changed horses at Barnet, a very pretty\r\nlittle town. 5 minutes past ½ past 9. We have just changed horses\r\nat St. Albans. The situation is very pretty & there is a beautiful\r\nold abbey there. 5 minutes past 10. The country is beautiful here:\r\nthey have began to cut the corn; it is so golden & fine that I think\r\nthey will have a very good harvest, at least here. There are also\r\npretty hills & trees. 20 minutes past ten. We have just passed a most\r\nbeautiful old house in a fine park with splendid trees. A ¼ to 11. We\r\nhave just changed horses at Dunstable; there was a fair there; the\r\nbooths filled with fruit, ribbons, &c. looked very pretty. The town\r\nseems old & there is a fine abbey before it. The country is very bleak\r\n& chalky. 12 minutes to 12. We have just changed horses at Brickhill.\r\nThe country is very beautiful about here. 19 minutes to 1. We have\r\njust changed horses at Stony Stratford. The country is very pretty.\r\nAbout ½ past 1 o’clock we arrived at Towcester & lunched there. At 14\r\nminutes past two we left it. A ¼ past 3. We have just changed horses\r\nat Daventry. The road continues to be very dusty. 1 minute past ½ past\r\n3. We have just[4] passed through Braunston where there is a curious\r\nspire. The Oxford canal is close to the town. 1 minute to 4. We have\r\njust changed horses at Dunchurch & it is raining.\r\n\r\nFor some time past already, and now, our road is entirely up an avenue\r\nof trees going on and on, it is quite delightful but it still rains.\r\nJust now we go at a _tremendous_ rate. 4 minutes to 5. We have just\r\nchanged horses at Coventry, a large town where there is a very old\r\nchurch (in appearance at least). At ½ past 5 we arrived at Meridon; and\r\nwe are now going to dress for dinner. ½ past 8. I am undressing to go\r\nto bed. Mamma is not well and is lying on the sofa in the next room. I\r\nwas asleep in a minute in my own little bed which travels always with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 2d August._—I got up after a very good night at 5 o’clock\r\nthis morning. Mamma is much better I am happy to say, and I am now\r\ndressing to go to breakfast. 6 minutes to ½ past 7. We have just left\r\nMeridon, a very clean inn. It is a very bad day. 10 minutes to 9. We\r\nhave just changed horses at Birmingham where I was two years ago and\r\nwe visited the manufactories which are very curious. It rains very\r\nhard. We just passed through a town where all coal mines are and you\r\nsee the fire glimmer at a distance in the engines in many places. The\r\nmen, women, children, country and houses are all black. But I can\r\nnot by any description give an idea of its strange and extraordinary\r\nappearance. The country is very desolate every where; there are coals\r\nabout, and the grass is quite blasted and black. I just now see an\r\nextraordinary building flaming with fire. The country continues black,\r\nengines flaming, coals, in abundance, every where, smoking and burning\r\ncoal heaps, intermingled with wretched huts and carts and little ragged\r\nchildren....\r\n\r\nI received from the mayor an oaken box with a silver top and filled\r\nwith the famous Shrewsbury cakes. We lunched there. We left it at a ¼\r\nto 3. As we passed along the streets a poor unhappy hen, frightened\r\nby the noise flew on the carriage but she was taken off. We had our\r\nhorses watered half way. When we arrived at the outskirts of Welshpool\r\nwe were met by a troop of Yeomanry who escorted us for a long time and\r\nthe little town was ornamented with arches, flowers, branches, flags,\r\nribbons, &c., &c. The guns fired as we came up the park and the band\r\nplayed before Powis Castle; Lord Powis[5] and Mr. Clive met us at the\r\ndoor of his beautiful old Castle and Lady Lucy and Lady Harriet Clive\r\nwere in the gallery. The Castle is very old and beautiful; the little\r\nold windows jutting in and out and a fine gallery with a dry-rubbed\r\nfloor and some beautiful busts. I am now dressing for dinner....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 9th August._—I awoke at ½ past 6 and got up at 7. I am\r\nnow dressing. A little after 8 I went out in the garden, and at\r\nabout ¼ to 9 we took breakfast. I began to write a letter after\r\nbreakfast, and then dressed. At ½ past 10 Mamma received an address\r\nfrom the Mayor and Corporation of Beaumaris, and another from the\r\ngentlemen inhabitants, and visitors of the town. At ½ past 11 we got\r\ninto our carriages with my Cousins on the box of ours. In passing\r\nthe Menai-bridge, we received a salute, and on entering the town\r\nof Carnarvon, we were met, not only by an immense crowd, who were\r\nextremely kind, and pleased, but by the Corporation also, who walked\r\nbefore the carriage, while a salute was firing. We then arrived at\r\nthe inn, where Mamma received an address. The address being over we\r\ntook luncheon, and after that was over, we went to see the ruins of\r\nthe Castle, which are beautiful, while a salute was fired, from the\r\nrampart. We then got into the _Emerald_, where we were several times\r\nsaluted, at the last being nearly becalmed, we were towed by a steam\r\npacket, called _Paul Pry_, which saluted us 4 times in the day. We\r\narrived at home at ¼ to 7, and dined at ½ past 7. We drank Uncle\r\nLeopold’s health in honour of his marriage that day. I stayed up till ½\r\npast 9. I went to bed soon after, and was soon asleep....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 29th August._—I awoke at ½ past 6 and got up at 7. It is\r\nnow 6 minutes past 8 & I am quite ready dressed. I then played. We\r\nbreakfasted at ½ past 8 but without Lady Catherine[6] who is very\r\nunwell. I then did my lessons & then played. At ½ past 12 I went\r\nout walking. We lunched at 1. At ½ past 3 went to Baron Hill Sir R.\r\nBulkeley’s[7] place. We arrived there at a little after 4. We were\r\nreceived at the door by Sir Richard & farther on by Lady Bulkeley whose\r\ndress I shall describe. It was a white satin trimmed with blonde, short\r\nsleeves & a necklace, ear-rings and sévigné of perridos & diamonds with\r\na wreath of orange-flowers in her hair. We then went upon the terrace\r\n& the band of the Anglesea Militia played “God save the King.” We\r\nthen presented all the bards & poets with medals. We then [went] into\r\nthe drawing-room and remained there till dinner. In the drawing-room\r\nthere were a great many other people. At 5 we went to dinner, which\r\nwas in a temporary building which was lined in the inside with pink\r\nand white linen. The dinner was splendidly served & the china was rich\r\nand beautiful. The fruit was magnificent. After dessert was over Sir\r\nRichard made a speech and brought out a toast in honor of Mamma & me.\r\nWe then left the room & went into the drawing-room. We went upstairs\r\ninto Lady Bulkeley’s pretty little dressing-room. Her toilet table was\r\npink with white muslin over it trimmed with beautiful lace & her things\r\non the toilet table were gold. We then went downstairs and took coffee\r\nand the famous dog of Lady Williams,[8] Cabriolle, played tricks. At\r\nabout 7 we left Baron Hill & proceeded homewards. Poor Lady Catherine\r\nwho was not able to go was in the evening much better. We arrived at\r\nhome at about a ¼ past 8. I then went downstairs & stayed up till near\r\n9. I was soon in bed and asleep....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 17th September._—I awoke at about 8, & got up at near ½ past\r\n8. We breakfasted at 9 downstairs. I then played and did other things.\r\nAt 1 we lunched. I then played on the piano, & at a little before 3\r\nplayed at billiards downstairs, with Victoire,[9] & then went out\r\nwalking. When I came home I first worked & then we blew soap-bubbles.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 14th October._—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At ½ past\r\n8 we breakfasted. I then wrote my Journal and some music and at 11 we\r\nwent to chapel for the last time and the sailors likewise for the last\r\ntime. The service was performed as usual by Mr. W. Jones. It was over\r\nat ¼ past 12. I then walked out with Lehzen[10] and Victoire. At 1 we\r\nlunched. At 3 we went out riding, and as we passed through the Park\r\ngate the old woman at the lodge came out as usual, to open the gate and\r\nshe thanked Mamma for what she had given her. We galloped over a green\r\nfield which we had already done several times. Rosa went an enormous\r\nrate; she literally _flew_. We then went on towards the Menai bridge\r\nbut turned back under the hill. We cantered a great deal and Rosa went\r\nthe whole time beautifully. It was a delightful ride. When we came home\r\nMamma got on Rosa and I got on Thomas and cantered him. We came in at ½\r\npast 4. Alas! it was our last ride at _dear_ Plas Newydd. I then walked\r\non the terrace for a short time. At 7 we dined and I stayed up till ½\r\npast 8. I was soon in bed and asleep.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 15th October._—I awoke at ½ past 5 and got up at 6. At 7 we\r\nbreakfasted with all the family; and a most beautiful falcon which\r\nSir John Williams[11] sent me was brought in that I might see it. The\r\nsailors were so busy and so useful for I saw Kew and Sparks going to\r\nand fro. At a ¼ to 8 we got into our carriages and drove out amidst\r\nthe shouts of the sailors of the _Emerald_, who were standing on the\r\nrigging two by two on the rope-ladders, till the last man was at the\r\nvery top of all. I looked out of the carriage window that I might get a\r\nlast look of the _dear Emerald_ and her _excellent crew_. As we passed\r\nalong the road we saw Mr. Griffith and Mr. W. Jones and his family....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTOIRE CONROY.\r\n\r\n  From a sketch by Princess Victoria.]\r\n\r\n10 minutes to 4.—We have just passed through Northop. At about ½\r\npast 4 we went through the Park of Mr. Granville up to his castle.\r\nLord Grosvenor met us there at the head of his Cavalry. And Lord\r\nWestminster[12] sent his own fine horses, which were put to our\r\ncarriage. At about ½ past 5 we arrived at Eaton Hall. We were received\r\nat the door by Lord and Lady Westminster, Lady Grosvenor and Lady\r\nWilton. The house is magnificent. You drive up to the door under a\r\nlofty vaulted portico with a flight of steps under it, and it takes\r\nyou to the hall, which is beautiful. The floor is inlaid with various\r\nmarbles, and arches spring from the sides. Then you enter a beautiful\r\ndrawing-room; the ceiling joins in a round gilt, with great taste and\r\nrichness, while the sides arch towards the top. An organ on the right\r\nas you enter the room and a large fireplace on the left with stained\r\nglass windows. Then Lady Westminster after we had been downstairs a\r\nlittle, showed us our apartments, which are indeed beautiful. I was in\r\nbed at ½ past 8.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 16th October._—I awoke at 6 and got up at 7. I then dressed\r\nand took some tea. At ½ past 9 we breakfasted. The breakfast-room is\r\nmagnificent. There are 4 fireplaces; and the windows are of stained\r\nglass very beautifully done. A massive lustre of gold with an eagle\r\nlikewise in gold hangs from the ceiling in the middle of the room.\r\nPillars arching to the top and gilt in parts rise from the sides.\r\nSeveral tables of oak and elm stand in the windows, and the breakfast\r\nwas served in handsome silver tea and coffee pots; a crown of gold with\r\nprecious stones contained the bread. Besides Lady Grosvenor and Lady\r\nWilton, there were also Lady Egerton,[13] Mrs. Lane and Miss Bagot.\r\nAfter breakfast Lady Grosvenor brought her 4 children. We then went\r\ninto our own rooms and I wrote my journal. At 12 Mamma went into the\r\ngreat saloon where all the ladies were and an address from the mayor\r\nand corporation of Chester arrived and then another from the gentlemen\r\nand inhabitants of Chester, presented by Lord Robert.[14] After this\r\nwe looked about the room which is indeed beautiful. The ceiling is\r\ndone in the same splendid manner and a magnificent lustre of gold\r\nand glass with a coronet of velvet and pearls hung from the ceiling\r\nin the room. Two windows of stained glass, very handsomely done, are\r\non different sides. A superb chimney-place with beautiful furniture\r\nand rich carpets, complete the room. 4 beautiful pictures painted by\r\ndifferent artists are likewise in the room. We then walked out with\r\nmost of the people; I walking in front with the eldest and third little\r\ngirl, the second not being well. We walked about the garden and looked\r\nat an aloe which flowers only once in 100 years. We came in at ½ past\r\n1, and lunched at 2. At ½ past 2 we went out driving; Lady Westminster\r\nand little Elinor,[15] the eldest child, were in our carriage; she\r\nis a delightful child. Lady Catherine and Lehzen followed in another\r\ncarriage. We drove about the park which is beautiful. When we came\r\nhome we walked in the kitchen gardens which are indeed very pretty. At\r\n½ past 4 we came home and I worked. At 7 we dined. The dining-room is\r\na fine room beautifully worked at the ceiling. Four large statues of\r\nMaltese stone occupy 4 corners, very beautifully executed; one with a\r\nhelmet is Sir Gilbert le Grosvenor,[16] and the lady[17] next by him\r\nis the heiress of Eaton; on the opposite side the man is Sir Robert le\r\nGrosvenor, distinguished in the battle of Cressy; the lady near him is\r\na Miss Davis who by intermarrying brought the possessions in town, as\r\nGrosvenor Square, Belgrave Square, etc., etc.[18] The window is stained\r\nglass with the figure of Hugh Lupus on it. The dinner was served on\r\nplate, and the plateau was very handsome with gilt cups on it. The\r\nside table was covered with gold plate. After dinner we played at a\r\ngame of letters and then I sang and Mamma and Lady Catherine sang and\r\nafterwards Lady Westminster played on the organ. I stayed up till 10....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 18th October._—When we went out after luncheon we went in\r\nthe garden first and saw a Roman altar which had been dug up near\r\nChester. At 7 we dined. The breakfast-room had been arranged for this\r\npurpose. A temporary floor had been arranged at the top of the room,\r\nfor our table (for all the company who had come to the bow-meeting\r\ndined here), and the other four were lower. After the dinner (we being\r\nstill at table) was over some glee-singers from Chester came and sang\r\nthe grace in Latin. Then Lord Westminster gave out some toasts; amongst\r\nothers, “The King,” “The Queen,” Mamma and me; which were received\r\nextremely well. After dinner was over, I gave the children, who had\r\ncome when dinner was over, a little remembrance. I then took leave of\r\nthe whole family and went to bed. I stayed up till 10.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 19th October._— ... ½ past 4. We have just changed horses at\r\nBuxton, which is a pretty place. The houses are well built and form a\r\ncrescent. The country about here is very pretty, high rocks covered\r\nwith trees. There are all about here little rivulets and fountains,\r\nrippling over stones. At ½ past 6 we arrived at Chatsworth, which is\r\na beautiful house. It was quite dark. It is built in the shape of a\r\nsquare joined by an arch under which one must drive. We were met at the\r\ndoor by the Duke of Devonshire[19] who conducted us up the staircase,\r\nwhich is made of wood, to our apartments which are indeed beautiful. In\r\nthe corridor there are some beautiful statues. I dined by myself in my\r\nown room with Lehzen. I stayed up till ½ past 8. I was soon in bed and\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 20th October._—I awoke at ½ past 7 and got up at 8. At a\r\nlittle past 9 we breakfasted, us 5 by ourselves in a lovely room giving\r\non the park and garden where one could see a cascade which ran all the\r\nway down. The room is small; the ceiling is painted and represents some\r\nmythology, with books round the room and a splendid carpet. At about 11\r\nwe went over the house with the company, which consisted of Lord and\r\nLady Cavendish,[20] Lord and Lady Newburgh,[21] Mr. and Lady Caroline\r\nLascelles,[22] Count Karoly, Mrs. Arkwright, Lady Clifford, Lord and\r\nLady Wharncliffe,[23] Mrs. Talbot, Lord Morpeth,[24] Mr. Cooper, Mr.\r\nHenry Greville, and Miss Fanny Cavendish.[25] It would take me days,\r\nwere I to describe minutely the whole. We went all over the house,\r\nand the carving of the frame-work of some looking-glasses was quite\r\nbeautiful; they are carved in the shape of birds, the plumage being so\r\nexquisite that if it was not of the colour of wood one might take them\r\nfor feathers. It not only surrounds the mirrors but the ceilings of\r\nsome of the rooms. We saw Lady Cavendish’s little boy who is 10 months\r\nold, a beautiful child. We likewise saw the kitchen which is superb for\r\nits size and cleanliness; and the confectionary which is as pretty and\r\nneat. The Duke’s own apartments contain some superb statues of Canova\r\nand others; likewise a beautiful collection of minerals. We saw the\r\nlibrary and dining-room which are all beautiful. The library’s ceiling\r\nis painted in figures; and the carpet is beautiful. The conservatory\r\nwhich leads from the dining-room is very pretty. We then walked out in\r\nthe garden, I went into another conservatory which contains a rockery\r\nwith water falling from it. There are some curious plants there,\r\namongst others two which are worthy of remark; the one is called the\r\npitcher-plant because at the end of each leaf hangs a little bag or\r\npitcher which fills with the dew and supplies the plant when it wants\r\nwater; the other is called the fly-catcher plant, because whenever a\r\nfly touches it, it closes. From the conservatory we went and looked at\r\na monkey which is in the garden, chained. We then went to the cascade\r\nand saw some other fountains very curious and pretty. When we had come\r\non the terrace the Duke wished us to plant two trees down under the\r\nterrace. So we did, I planted an oak and Mamma a Spanish chesnut. After\r\nthat we went upon the terrace again and went up a platform which had\r\nbeen arranged with carpets, to view the cricket-match below; the Buxton\r\nband playing “God save the King” and the people hurraying and others\r\nunder tents looked very pretty. From there we went to the stables where\r\nwe saw some pretty ponies and a Russian coachman in his full dress, and\r\nthe only Russian horse which remained reared at his command; there were\r\n3 other horses, English ones, but trained like the other. At about ½\r\npast 1 we came home and lunched with the whole party. At ½ past 2 we\r\nwent in a carriage and 6 with the Duke and Mrs. Cavendish, to Haddon\r\nHall, a very old and singular place. The old tapestry still remaining\r\nand iron hooks to keep it back. We then went to the Rookery, a small\r\ncottage belonging to the Duke on the banks of the river Wye, very\r\npretty and cool. From there we walked to the Marble Mills and saw how\r\nthey sawed and polished the marble. There was a little cottage where\r\nthey sold Derbyshire spar in different little shapes and forms, and\r\nsome pieces of marble too. We then drove home after having bought a\r\ngood many things. We came in at 5. At 7 we dined and after dinner at\r\nabout ½ past 9 we looked at the cascade illuminated, which looked very\r\npretty, and the fountains, blue lights, red lights, rockets, etc. At\r\nabout 10 the charade began in 3 syllables and 4 scenes. The first act\r\nwas a scene out of _Bluebeard_; Lady Caroline Lascelles and Miss F.\r\nCavendish acting the ladies, and Count Karoly as Bluebeard, with Lord\r\nNewburgh and Mr. Lascelles as their friends. The next act was a scene\r\nof carrying offerings to Father Nile; Mrs. Talbot, Lady Cavendish,\r\nLady Clifford, Miss Cavendish, and the two Miss Smiths as the vestals;\r\nand Lord Morpeth, Lord Newburgh, Count Karoly, Mr. Greville, Sir A.\r\nClifford,[26] Mr Cooper, and Mr. Lascelles as the men. Mr. Beaumont was\r\nFather Nile. The third act was a scene of _Tom Thumb_; Lord Morpeth\r\nas Tom Thumb, and Lord Newburgh as the nurse. The fourth act was a\r\nscene out of _Kenilworth_ (which was the word); Mrs. Talbot as Queen\r\nElizabeth, Lady Cavendish as Amy, Lady Caroline and Miss Cavendish\r\n(who danced the menuet with Count Karoly) as her attendants; little\r\nGeorgina Lascelles[27] as page to bear the Queen’s train, Lord Morpeth\r\nas Lord Leicester, Lord Newburgh as an attendant, Count Karoly as Lord\r\nShrewsbury, Mr. Cooper as Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lord Waterpark[28]\r\nand Mr. Greville as two more men of the Queen’s, not to omit Lady\r\nClifford as the Queen’s lady, and Sir Augustus as a gentleman of the\r\nQueen. They were all in regular costumes. When it was over, which was\r\nat ¼ to 12, I went to bed....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 24th October._— ... At 1 we arrived at Alton Towers, the\r\nseat of Lord Shrewsbury.[29] This is an extraordinary house. On\r\narriving one goes into a sort of gallery filled with armour, guns,\r\nswords, pistols, models, flags, etc., etc., then into a gallery filled\r\nwith beautiful pictures and then into a conservatory with birds. We\r\nlunched there and the luncheon was served on splendid gold plate. We\r\nthen walked in the gardens. At ½ past 2 we left it....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 31st October._—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At ½\r\npast 9 we breakfasted in the drawing-room, for the gentlemen who were\r\ngoing to hunt breakfasted in the other room, all the ladies and Sir\r\nJohn breakfasting with us. After breakfast at about ½ past 10 we went\r\ninto the room where they were, and they gave us a toast with many\r\ncheers. After that we walked out to see the hunt. We saw them set off.\r\nIt was an immense field of horsemen, who in their red jackets and black\r\nhats looked lively and gave an animating appearance to the whole. They\r\nhad a large pack of hounds and three huntsmen or Whippers-in. They drew\r\na covert near here in hopes of finding a fox, but as they did not they\r\nreturned and we got into the carriage with Lady Selina[30] and Lehzen\r\nwhile all the huntsmen and the hounds followed. When we came to a\r\nfield, they drew another covert and succeeded; we saw the fox dash past\r\nand all the people and hounds after him, the hounds in full cry. The\r\nhounds killed him in a wood quite close by. The huntsman then brought\r\nhim out and cutting off the brush Sir Edward Smith (to whom the hounds\r\nbelong) brought it to me. Then the huntsmen cut off for themselves\r\nthe ears and 4 paws, and lastly they threw it to the dogs, who tore\r\nit from side to side till there was nothing left. We then went home.\r\nAt 1 we lunched, and at 2, I, Lady Selina, Lady Louisa[31] and dear\r\nLehzen went out walking, towards a farm of Lord Liverpool’s, and when\r\nwe had passed the farm and were going to return by the village, we\r\nheard the blast of a horn and we looked and saw the hounds and hunters\r\ngoing full gallop along a field which was below the field in which we\r\nwere walking. They came and crossed the field in which we were and we\r\nsaw all the riders leap over a ditch. We went back the same way that\r\nwe might see them. When we came near home we saw them go home by the\r\nhouse. At ½ past 3 we came home. At ½ past 6 we dined, and I received\r\nmy brush which had been fixed on a stick by the huntsman; it is a\r\nbeautiful one. Amongst the people who were here, those who remain are\r\nMr., Mrs., and Miss Corbett, Mr., Mrs., and Miss Child. After dinner\r\nthe young ladies played some pretty things from the _Pirata_ and from\r\n_Fra Diavolo_. I stayed up till near 10....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 7th November._— ... ¼ to 4. We have just changed horses\r\nat Woodstock, and another detachment of Yeomanry commanded by Lord\r\nChurchill[32] ride with us now. We passed through Oxford on our way.\r\nAt about a little past 5 we arrived at Wytham Abbey, the seat of Lord\r\nAbingdon.[33] We were received at the door by Lord and Lady Abingdon,\r\nLady Charlotte Bertie and Lady Emily Bathurst, their daughters. The\r\nhouse is very comfortable; in the drawing-room there is a lovely\r\npicture by Angelica Kauffman, Penelope. After staying a few minutes\r\ndownstairs we went upstairs to our rooms which are very pretty and\r\ncomfortable. At a little past 7 we dined with several other people. I\r\nstayed up till a little past 9.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 8th November._—I awoke at a little to 8 and got up at 8. At\r\na little past 9 we breakfasted with the whole party. At 10 o’clock we\r\nset out for Oxford in a close carriage and 4 with Lord Abingdon and\r\nLady Charlotte Bertie; the other ladies going in carriages before us.\r\nWe got out first at the Divinity College, and walked from thence to\r\nthe theatre, which was built by Sir Christopher Wren. The ceiling is\r\npainted with allegorical figures. The galleries are ornamented with\r\ncarving enriched with gold. It was filled to excess. We were most\r\nWARMLY and ENTHUSIASTICALLY received. They hurrayed and applauded\r\nus immensely for there were all the students there; all in their\r\ngowns and caps. Mamma received an address which was presented by the\r\nVice-Chancellor, Dr. Rowly, and Mamma answered it as usual. Then\r\nSir John[34] was made a Doctor of Civil Law. After that was over,\r\nwe returned through Divinity College and proceeded in our carriages\r\nto the Council Chamber where Mamma received an address there, from\r\nthe corporation of Oxford, and Sir John the freedom of the City of\r\nOxford. We then went to Christ Church, which is very fine, viewed the\r\nhall and chapel and library. Dr. Gaisford[35] is the Dean of Christ\r\nChurch and is at the head of that college. From there we went to the\r\nBodleian library which is immense. Amongst other curiosities there is\r\nQueen Elizabeth’s Latin exercise book when she was of my age (13). We\r\nwent through Mr. Sneed’s house to our carriages. From there to All\r\nSouls’ College where Mr. Sneed is the warden. It is not a college for\r\neducation, but after they have taken their degree. We saw the library\r\nand chapel which is very beautiful. We then went to University College\r\nof which the Vice-chancellor is the head. We lunched there and saw\r\nthe chapel which is very fine. From there we went to New College of\r\nwhich Dr. Shuttleworth[36] is the head. We saw the chapel and hall.\r\nFrom there to the Clarendon printing-press which is very amusing but\r\nwould take up too much space and time to describe. We then went home.\r\nWe arrived at home at ½ past 3. At 7 we dined with some other people\r\nwho were Lord Cantelupe,[37] Lord Folkestone,[38] Lord Loftus,[39] Mr.\r\nGage,[40] Mr. Canning,[41] Lord Thomas Clinton,[42] Mr. L. Gower,[43]\r\nLord Boscawen,[44] etc. etc. After dinner the young ladies sang to\r\nthe guitar which one of them played. We then sang and Lord Abingdon. I\r\nstayed up till 10.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 9th November._— ... At about ½ past 5 we arrived at Kensington\r\nPalace. We resumed our old rooms. At 7 we dined with Jane and Victoire\r\nConroy, Lord Liverpool and Sir John. My aunt Sophia[45] came after\r\ndinner. I stayed up till a ¼ to 9.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 24th December._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 9 we\r\nbreakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean,[46] and I gave him Mamma’s\r\nand my Christmas box. He stayed till ½ past 11. In the course of the\r\nmorning I gave Mrs. Brock a Christmas box and all our people. At ½ past\r\n1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came Mr. Westall[47] till ½ past 3. At 4 came\r\nMr. Sale[48] till 5. At a ¼ to 7 we dined with the whole Conroy family\r\nand Mr. Hore downstairs, as our Christmas tables were arranged in our\r\ndining-room. After dinner we went upstairs. I then saw Flora, the dog\r\nwhich Sir John was going to give Mamma. Aunt Sophia came also. We then\r\nwent into the drawing-room near the dining-room. After Mamma had rung\r\na bell three times we went in. There were two large round tables on\r\nwhich were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All\r\nthe presents being placed round the tree. I had one table for myself\r\nand the Conroy family had the other together. Lehzen had likewise a\r\nlittle table. Mamma gave me a little lovely pink bag which she had\r\nworked with a little sachet likewise done by her; a beautiful little\r\nopal brooch and earrings, books, some lovely prints, a pink satin dress\r\nand a cloak lined with fur. Aunt Sophia gave me a dress which she\r\nworked herself, and Aunt Mary[49] a pair of amethyst earrings. Lehzen\r\na lovely music-book. Victoire a _very_ pretty white bag worked by\r\nherself, and Sir John a silver brush. I gave Lehzen some little things\r\nand Mamma gave her a writing table. We then went to my room where I had\r\narranged Mamma’s table. I gave Mamma a white bag which I had worked,\r\na collar and a steel chain for Flora, and an Annual; Aunt Sophia a\r\npair of turquoise earrings; Lehzen a little white and gold pincushion\r\nand a pin with two little gold hearts hanging to it; Sir John, Flora,\r\na book-holder and an Annual. Mamma then took me up into my bedroom\r\nwith all the ladies. There was my new toilet table with a white muslin\r\ncover over pink, and all my silver things standing on it with a fine\r\nnew looking-glass. I stayed up till ½ past 9. The dog went away again\r\nto the doctor for her leg. I saw good Louis[50] for an instant and she\r\ngave me a lovely little wooden box with bottles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.R.H. PRINCESS SOPHIA.\r\n\r\n  From a portrait by Sir W. Ross.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  When the Princess was fourteen years old she obtained her first\r\n  sight of Osborne, that future home in the Isle of Wight where\r\n  she was destined to spend so many happy years, and which was\r\n  associated with the closing scenes of her life. Osborne Lodge was\r\n  the residence of Sir John Conroy. It occupied the site of Osborne\r\n  Cottage, now the residence of the Queen’s youngest daughter,\r\n  Princess Henry of Battenberg. In spite of the changes made in the\r\n  appearance of Osborne by the erection of Osborne House and the\r\n  laying-out of the grounds round it, that portion of the estate\r\n  where Osborne Cottage stands, and Whippingham Church, with its\r\n  manifold associations, have much the same aspect as they had when\r\n  first explored by Princess Victoria in 1833.\r\n\r\n  On her birthday, King William gave a children’s party at St.\r\n  James’s in his niece’s honour, and the ball was opened by the\r\n  little Princess and her cousin Prince George of Cambridge, then a\r\n  boy of fourteen, who was afterwards to be the Commander-in-Chief of\r\n  her armies. The Princess speaks of the ball-room. It is difficult\r\n  to be sure which room is meant by this. The eastern end of St.\r\n  James’s Palace had been destroyed by fire in 1809, and had only\r\n  recently been rebuilt. The Palace was occupied by William IV. and\r\n  Queen Adelaide, the Queen’s rooms being in that portion which is\r\n  now called Clarence House, and the King’s apartments occupying\r\n  the western end of what is now St. James’s Palace proper. It was\r\n  probably the room hung with yellow silk, next but one to the\r\n  Throne-room, so familiar to those who attend the King’s Levées,\r\n  that the little Princess opened her first ball.\r\n\r\n  This was not her first introduction into Society. Three years\r\n  before she had been seen at Court, and in 1831 she had attended a\r\n  Drawing-room.\r\n\r\n  The Princess now acquired a habit (which she practised for many\r\n  years) of making sketches from memory of the artists and scenes\r\n  that struck her imagination during her visits to the theatre.\r\n  There are many volumes at Windsor Castle full of the Princess’s\r\n  recollections of the theatre, drawn in pencil or in water-colour.\r\n  Although the technique may be faulty, these sketches are full\r\n  of movement and quaintly descriptive. They indicate an absorbed\r\n  attention on her part, and a vivid memory. They suggest a power\r\n  of concentration upon the thing she was about, which became in\r\n  after-life a marked characteristic. From her journals and her\r\n  sketches as a child of fourteen, an inference might be drawn that\r\n  little escaped the acute observation of the little Princess. There\r\n  are many who remember how in later life very little escaped the\r\n  observation of the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                                 1833\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 15th January._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 10 minutes to\r\n9 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till ½ past 11. Just before\r\nwe went out, Mamma’s little dog, a beautiful spaniel of King Charles’s\r\nbreed, called Dash, and which Sir John gave her yesterday, came and\r\nwill now remain here. At a ¼ past 12 Lehzen and I went out walking in\r\nthe park. We met Mrs. Talbot. When we came home I fed dear Rosy who was\r\n_so_ greedy. At ½ past 1 we lunched. At 3 came Mr. Steward[51] till 4.\r\nAt 4 came Mons. Grandineau[52] till 5. Little Dash is _perfection_, he\r\nis already much attached to Mamma and lies always at her feet. At 7 we\r\ndined. Aunt Sophia came at 8. Sir John dined here. I stayed up till ½\r\npast 8....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 31st January._—At 1 we lunched. At 2 I sat to Mr. Hayter[53]\r\ntill 10 minutes to 4. At 5 we dined. Sir John dined here. At ½ past 6\r\nwe went with Lady Conroy, Jane and Victoire to the play to Drury Lane.\r\nIt was the opera of _The Barber of Seville_. It is so well known that\r\nI need not describe it. The principal characters were Count Almaviva,\r\nMr. Wood, who looked, sang, and acted _extremely_ well; Rosina, Mrs.\r\nWood; Figaro, Mr. Philipps, who sung very well; Dr. Bartolo, Mr.\r\nSeguin, who acted very well. It was in 3 acts and I was very _much\r\namused_. The after piece called _The Nervous Man_ is only amusing in\r\nparts, for Mr. Farren[54] and Mr. Power, two excellent comic actors. We\r\ndid not see the end of it. We came home at 12....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 9th February._—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At\r\n½ past 8 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till 11. At ½\r\npast 12 we lunched. At I we paid a visit to my aunt the Duchess of\r\nGloucester.[55] When we came home I fed dear little Rosa, and little\r\nIsabell. At ½ past 2 came Mr. Westall[56] till ½ past 3. At a ¼ past\r\n5 we dined. Sir John dined here. At ½ past 6 we went to the play\r\nwith Lady Conroy, Victoire and Lehzen as usual. It was the ballet\r\nof _Kenilworth_. The subject is taken from the novel by Sir Walter\r\nScott, which being so well known I shall not describe. The principal\r\ncharacters were, Lord Leicester, Mons. Theodore Guerinot, who danced\r\nbeautifully; Amy Robsart, Mdlle. Pauline Leroux, who danced and\r\nacted _beautifully_ and looked _quite_ lovely; Jenny, Madame Proche\r\nGiubilei, who acted very well and looked very pretty; Queen Elizabeth,\r\nMrs. Vining; Varney, Mr. W. H. Payne; Earl of Sussex, Signor Rossi;\r\nLord Shrewsbury, Mr. Bertram. Besides these, Mdlle. Adele and Mdlle.\r\nChavigny danced a pas de trois with Mons. Theodore Guerinot. They\r\ndanced very well. At 20 minutes past 9 we came home. I then took tea....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 5th April._—To-day is Good Friday. At 10 we went to prayers.\r\nJane and Victoire also. The service was performed by the Dean, who\r\ngave us likewise a very good sermon. It was taken from the 8th chapter\r\nof the Acts of the Apostles, 30th verse. At a ¼ past 12 we went out\r\nwalking. When we came home I fed sweet Rosy. At ½ past I we lunched. At\r\n3 came Victoire till 5. At 7 we dined. At 8 came Aunt Sophia.

The Duchess of Northumberland, Lady Charlotte St. Maur,[58]\r\nand Sir John dined here. At 20 minutes to 7 we went out with them\r\nto the Opera. We were very much _disappointed_ for Taglioni did not\r\nmake her début, nor Rubini. We had only one scene of _Il Barbière di\r\nSiviglia_, in which Signor Tambourini, who is a _beautiful_ singer and\r\nactor, appeared, and Donizelli. After waiting for half an hour Laporte\r\n(the manager) was called out, and he said that Mlle. Taglioni was very\r\nunwell in bed, and Mad. Méric was likewise ill, so that _Il Pirato_\r\ncould not be performed, but that Rubini would be there directly. After\r\none act of _Fidelio_, which was _shockingly_ performed, Rubini came on\r\nand sang a song out of _Anna Boulena_ _quite beautifully_. After that\r\nthere was the ballet of _La Somnambula_. The principal characters were\r\nMdlle. Pauline Leroux, who looked QUITE LOVELY and acted prettily;\r\nMdlle. Adele; Madame Proche Giubelei who looked _very pretty_; Messrs.\r\nAlbert and Coulon.

The Duchess of\r\nNorthumberland was present. At a ¼ past 12 we went out riding with Lady\r\nConroy, Victoire, Lehzen, and Sir John. We rode a little way in the\r\npark, but the fog was so thick that we turned round and rode down by\r\nGloucester Road, and turned up by Phillimore Place, where it was very\r\nfine and not at all foggy. _Dear_ Rosa went _beautifully_. We came home\r\nat ½ past 1. At ½ past 1 we lunched. At 3 came Mr. Steward till 4. At\r\n4 came Mons. Grandineau till 5. At a ¼ to 7 we dined.

At about 8 I went to my room\r\nwith Lehzen. At 20 minutes past 9 I went into the saloon with her to\r\nmeet the company. The Grenadier Guards’ band played after dinner. I saw\r\nall the company go. I stayed up till 11....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 27th April._—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to 8. At a ¼ to\r\n9 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till 11.

It was her first appearance\r\nthis season and she was called out. The sisters were two FRIGHTFUL\r\ncreatures. The ballet which followed was _Flore et Zephir_. Mdlle.\r\nTaglioni[80] made her first appearance this season. She is grown very\r\nthin, but danced _beautifully_, so lightly and _gracefully_, and each\r\nstep so finished! She took the part of Flore, and was very prettily\r\ndressed in a plain gauze dress, trimmed with flowers across her skirt;\r\na wreath of flowers round her head, and her hair quite flat. Pearls\r\nround her neck and arms. She looked _lovely_, for she is all-ways\r\nsmiling. We went away soon. We came home at 12....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 3rd May._—At 12 we went with the Duchess of Northumberland,\r\nLady Charlotte St. Maur, Lady Catherine Jenkinson, Lady Cust, Lady\r\nConroy, Lehzen, Sir George Anson, and Sir John, to the Exhibition\r\nat Somerset House.

At a little past 7 Lehzen and I went into the saloon, for\r\nMamma gave a dinner.

We went into the Closet. Soon after, the doors were opened, and\r\nthe King leading me went into the ball-room. Madame Bourdin was there\r\nas dancing-mistress. Victoire was also there, as well as _many_ other\r\nchildren whom I knew. Dancing began soon after. I danced first with my\r\ncousin George Cambridge, then with Prince George Lieven,[116] then with\r\nLord Brook,[117] then Lord March,[118] then with Lord Athlone,[119]\r\nthen with Lord Fitzroy Lennox,[120] then with Lord Emlyn.[121] We then\r\nwent to supper. It was ½ past 11; the King leading me again. I sat\r\nbetween the King and Queen. We left supper soon. My health was drunk.\r\nI then danced one more quadrille with Lord Paget. I danced in all _8_\r\nquadrilles. We came home at ½ past 12. I was VERY much amused....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 16th June._—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At a ¼ to\r\n9 we breakfasted. At 10 we went to prayers. At 10 came Victoire and\r\nwent to prayers with us. The service was performed by Mr. Pittman, as\r\nthe poor Dean had the misfortune to lose his little girl Charlotte, of\r\nthe scarlet fever, which I was very sorry for. Mr. Pittman gave us a\r\nbeautiful sermon. It was taken from the 11th chapter of the Gospel of\r\nSt. Luke, 1st verse. At 1 we lunched. Victoire stayed till ½ past 2.\r\nAt 3 arrived my two cousins, Princes Alexander and Ernst Würtemberg,\r\nsons of Mamma’s sister, my Aunt Antoinette.[122] They are both\r\n_extremely tall_. Alexander is _very handsome_ and Ernst has a _very\r\nkind expression_. They are both EXTREMELY _amiable_. At 4 we went out\r\ndriving in the open carriage. We paid a visit to Aunt Gloucester, and\r\nthen drove home through the park. We came home at a ¼ to 6. At a ¼ past\r\n7 we dined. Besides Alexander, Ernst and Charles, Prince Reuss[123] and\r\nSir John dined here....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 27th June._—At ½ past 9 we went to the Exhibition of the\r\nwater-colours, with Alexander and Lehzen in our carriage, and Sir John\r\nin another. We met the Duchess of Northumberland there. It is a VERY\r\nFINE exhibition. From there we went to the British Gallery, where\r\nthe works of Sir Joshua Reynolds, West, and Sir Thomas Lawrence are\r\nexhibiting. We came home at ½ past 11. At 1 we lunched. At 2 came Lady\r\nStafford with her two little girls, Elizabeth[124] and Evelyn,[125]\r\nand Lady Caroline[126] with her little Georgiana. All beautiful\r\nchildren. At ½ past 4 we drove out in the park, and walked home through\r\nthe gardens. We came home at ½ past 5. At 7 we all dined. Sir John\r\ndined here. At a little after 9 we went, with Alexander and Lehzen\r\nin our carriage, and Ernst, Charles and Sir John in another carriage\r\nfollowing, to the Opera. We came in at the beginning of the 2nd act\r\nof _Norma_, in which Madame Pasta sung BEAUTIFULLY. After that Signor\r\nPaganini played by himself some variations, most WONDERFULLY; he is\r\nhimself a _curiosity_. After that was given the last act of _Otello_;\r\nDesdemona, Madame Malibran,[127] who sang and acted BEAUTIFULLY. After\r\nthat was performed _La Sylphide_; Taglioni danced BEAUTIFULLY and\r\nlooked LOVELY. Fanny Elsler danced also _very well_. We saw the whole\r\nof the 1st act and half of the second. It was Laporte’s benefit. I\r\nwas VERY MUCH AMUSED. We came home at ½ past 1. I was soon in bed and\r\nasleep....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 1st July._—I awoke at ½ past 4 and got up at a ¼ past 5. At a\r\n¼ past 6 we all breakfasted. At 7 o’clock we left Kensington Palace,\r\nSir John going in a post-chaise before us, then our post-chaise, then\r\nLehzen’s landau, then my Cousins’ carriage, then Charles’s, then Lady\r\nConroy’s, and then our maids’. It is a lovely morning. 5 minutes past\r\n8—we have just changed horses at Esher. Lynedoch Gardiner[128] brought\r\nus a basket full of beautiful flowers. 10 o’clock; we have just changed\r\nhorses at Guildford. POOR DEAR LITTLE Dashy could not go with us as he\r\nwas not quite well, so he is gone with Mason with the horses. 4 minutes\r\npast 1; we have just left Liphook where we took our luncheon. 5 minutes\r\nto 2, we have just changed horses at Petersfield. 5 minutes to 3, we\r\nhave just changed horses at Horndean. At 4 we arrived at Portsmouth.\r\nThe streets were lined with soldiers, and Sir Colin Campbell[129] rode\r\nby the carriage. Sir Thomas Williams,[130] the Admiral, took us in his\r\nbarge, on board the _dear Emerald_. The Admiral presented some of\r\nthe officers to us. We stayed about ½ an hour waiting for the baggage\r\nto be put on board the steamer, which was to tow us. We then set off\r\nand arrived at Cowes at about 7. We were most civilly received. Cowes\r\nCastle, the yacht-club, yachts, &c., &c., saluting us. We saw Lord\r\nDurham[131] who is staying at Cowes. We drove up in a fly to Norris\r\nCastle, where we lodged two years ago, and where we are again living.\r\nMy cousins and my brother were _delighted_ with it. At about ½ past 7\r\nwe all dined. Lady Conroy and her family went to their cottage after\r\ndinner....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 8th July._—At about 10 we went on board the _Emerald_ with\r\nAlexander, Ernst, Lady Charlotte, Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Sir\r\nJohn and Henry. We were towed up to Southampton by the _Medina_\r\nsteam-packet. It rained several times very hard, and we were obliged\r\nto go down into the cabin very often. When we arrived at Southampton,\r\nMamma received an address on board from the Corporation. We then got\r\ninto the barge and rowed up to the new pier. The crowd was tremendous.\r\nWe went into a tent erected on the pier, and I was very much frightened\r\nfor fear my cousins and the rest of our party should get knocked about;\r\nhowever they at last got in. We then got into our barge and went on\r\nboard the _Emerald_ where we took our luncheon. We stayed a little\r\nwhile to see the regatta, which was going on, and then sailed home. It\r\nwas a very wet afternoon. We came home at ½ past 5. At 7 we dined. Lady\r\nConroy, Jane, Victoire, Sir John, and Henry dined here....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 12th July._—I awoke at 6 and got up at ½ past 6. At 7 we\r\nbreakfasted. It was a _sad_ breakfast, for us indeed, as my dear\r\ncousins were going so soon. At about a ¼ to 8 we walked down our\r\npier with them and there took leave of them, which made us both VERY\r\nUNHAPPY. We saw them get into the barge, and watched them sailing away\r\nfor some time on the beach. They were so amiable and so pleasant to\r\nhave in the house; they were _always satisfied, always good humoured_;\r\nAlexander took such care of me in getting out of the boat, and rode\r\nnext to me; so did Ernst. They talked about _such interesting things_,\r\nabout their Turkish Campaign, about Russia, &c., &c. We shall miss\r\nthem at _breakfast_, at _luncheon_, at _dinner_, _riding_, _sailing_,\r\n_driving_, _walking_, in _fact everywhere_.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours after my cousins had gone, Mamma received the\r\ndistressing news that my cousins’ father, the Duke Alexander of\r\nWürtemberg,[132] who had been ill for some time, was dead. I was\r\nextremely sorry for them. Mamma immediately dispatched an estafette\r\nafter them to Dover with the news. At 1 we lunched. It was a dull\r\nluncheon. At 4 we went out riding with Lady Charlotte, Lady Conroy,\r\nJane, Victoire, Sir John and Henry. Victoire rode Alice, and Lehzen\r\nIsabel. The ride would have appeared to me much pleasanter had\r\nAlexander and Ernst been there. We came home at 6. We heard from a\r\nservant of ours, who had crossed over with them to Portsmouth, that\r\nthey had had a very quick and good passage and that they had not been\r\nat all sick. At 7 we dined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Sir John,\r\nEdward, and Henry dined here. Here again they were missing....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 18th July._—At a ¼ to 10 we went on board the _Emerald_ with\r\nLady Charlotte, Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Lehzen, and Sir John,\r\nand were towed by the _Messenger_ steam-packet up to Portsmouth. We\r\nthen got into the Admiral’s barge, and landed in the docks. We then\r\nsaw from an elevation, the launch of the _Racer_, a sloop of war. We\r\nthen re-entered the Admiral’s barge and went to the _Victory_, his\r\nflag-ship. We there received the salute on board. We saw the spot where\r\nNelson fell, and which is covered up with a brazen plate and his motto\r\nis inscribed on it, “Every Englishman is expected to do his duty.” We\r\nwent down as low as the tanks, and there tasted the water which had\r\nbeen in there for two years, and which was excellent. We also saw the\r\nplace where Nelson died. The whole ship is remarkable for its neatness\r\nand order. We tasted some of the men’s beef and potatoes, which were\r\nexcellent, and likewise some grog. The company consisted of Lady\r\nWilliams, the Admiral’s lady, Sir Graham and Lady Moore,[133] Mr. and\r\nMrs. Ricardo, Sir Frederick and Lady Maitland,[134] etc., etc. We then\r\npartook of a luncheon at the Admiral’s House and then returned on board\r\nthe _Emerald_. We got home by 5. We both wished so much that _dear_\r\nAlexander and _dear_ Ernest had been there, I think it would have\r\namused them....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 2nd August._—I awoke at about a ¼ to 6 and got up at ½\r\npast 7. At ½ past 8 we all breakfasted. We then saw several ladies\r\nand gentlemen. At about ½ past 9 we went on board the _dear little\r\nEmerald_. We were to be towed up to Plymouth. Mamma and Lehzen were\r\nvery sick, and I was sick for about ½ an hour. At 1 I had a hot\r\nmutton chop on deck. We passed Dartmouth. At about 4 we approached\r\nPlymouth Harbour. It is a magnificent place and the breakwater is\r\nwonderful indeed. You pass Mount Edgecumbe, the seat of Lord Mount\r\nEdgecumbe.[135] It is beautifully situated. The Admiral, Sir William\r\nHargood,[136] Captain Falkland his flag-captain, and Mr. Yorke[137]\r\ncame on board. Captain Brown, who is on board the _Caledonia_, and\r\nCaptain Macay, on board the _Revenge_, also came on board. As we\r\nentered the harbour, our dear little _Emerald_ ran foul of a hulk, her\r\nmast broke and we were in the _greatest danger_. Thank God! the mast\r\ndid not fall and no one was hurt. But I was _dreadfully_ frightened\r\nfor _Mamma_ and for _all_. The poor dear _Emerald_ is very much hurt\r\nI fear. Saunders was not at all in fault; he saved us by pulling the\r\nrope which fixed us to the steamer. We arrived at Plymouth at 5. It is\r\na beautiful town and we were very well received. _Sweet Dash_ was under\r\nSaunders’s arm the whole time, but he never let him drop in all the\r\ndanger. At 7 we dined. The hotel is very fine indeed. After dinner Sir\r\nJohn saw Saunders, who said that the mast of the _Emerald_ was broken\r\nin two places, and that we had had the _narrowest escape possible_;\r\nbut that she would be repaired and ready for us to go back in her on\r\nTuesday.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 3rd August._—At 10 came Sir John Cameron,[138] the Governor,\r\nand his officers. At ½ past 10 came Sir William Hargood and his\r\nofficers and captains. Soon after came Lord Hill, who is over here to\r\ninspect the troops, and Sir John Macdonald,[139] Sir Richard Jackson,\r\nand Captain Hill. At ½ past 11 Mamma received an address from the\r\nMayor and Corporation of Plymouth, downstairs in a large room full of\r\npeople. At 12 we went with all our own party to a review of the 89th,\r\nthe 22nd, and the 84th regiments. Mamma made a speech, and I then gave\r\nthe colours to the 89th regiment. The names of the two Ensigns to whom\r\nI gave the colours are Miles and Egerton. We then saw them march by in\r\nline. We then went to the Admiral’s house where we had our luncheon,\r\nand then proceeded to the docks. We went in the Admiral’s barge on\r\nboard the Admiral’s flag-ship, the _St. Joseph_, taken by Lord Nelson\r\nfrom the Spanish, in the battle of St. Vincent. We received a salute on\r\nboard. She is a magnificent vessel of 120 guns. We saw her lower decks\r\nand cabins, which are extremely light, airy, roomy and clean. We then\r\nreturned in the Admiral’s barge, rowed round the _Caledonia_ 120 guns,\r\nand the _Revenge_ 76 guns. We landed at the Dockyard and went home. At\r\n7 we dined....\r\n\r\nEnd of my third Journal-book. Norris Castle, August 11th, 1833....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 16th September._—At 10 we went on board the _Emerald_ with\r\nLady Catherine, Lady Conroy, Jane, Lehzen, Victoire, and Sir John,\r\nand sailed to Portsmouth, where we were going to pay a visit to their\r\nMajesties the Queen of Portugal[140] and the Duchess of Braganza (her\r\nstep-mother). We got there at ½ past 11. We entered the Admiral’s\r\nbarge with Lady Catherine, Lady Conroy, Lehzen, and Sir John, and were\r\nrowed ashore. We landed at the stairs in the dockyard. Mamma and I got\r\ninto a close carriage, and our ladies followed in an open carriage.\r\nThe whole way from the dock-yard to the Admiral’s house, where their\r\nMajesties reside, was lined with troops and various bands were placed\r\nat different distances. We were received at the door by the gentlemen\r\nand ladies of the court. Inside the hall we were met by the Queen and\r\nthe Duchess. The Queen led Mamma, and the Duchess followed leading\r\nme into the room. The Queen was in England 4 years ago; she is only\r\na month older than I am and is very kind to me. She was then already\r\nvery tall for her age, but had a very beautiful figure; she is grown\r\nvery tall but also very stout. She has a beautiful complexion, and is\r\nvery sweet and friendly. She wore her hair in two large curls in front\r\nand a thick fine plait turned up behind. The Empress (or Duchess as\r\nshe is now called) was never before in England. She is only 21 and is\r\nvery pleasing. She has beautiful blue eyes, and has a fine tall figure.\r\nShe has black hair and wore ringlets in front and a plait behind. She\r\nwas simply dressed in a grey watered moire trimmed with blonde. Their\r\nMajesties arrived at Portsmouth from Havre on the morning of the 8th\r\nof September; and proceeded to Windsor on the 10th, on a visit to the\r\nKing and Queen, from whence they returned last Saturday, and they\r\nintend leaving Portsmouth to-day at 2 o’clock for Lisbon. The Queen and\r\nDuchess having desired us to sit down, talked some time with us. The\r\nDuchess then went and fetched her little girl, a child of 21 months\r\nold. We soon after went, the Queen leading Mamma and the Duchess me in\r\nthe same manner as before. We returned in the same way. We lunched on\r\nboard the _Emerald_ and then were towed by the _Messenger_ home. We\r\ncame home at 3....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 14th October._— ... Ferdinand the 7th of Spain[141] died\r\non the 29th of September, and his young and lovely Queen Christina\r\ninstantly became Regent for the infant Queen Isabella the 2nd, her\r\ndaughter, and who is only 3 years old. The Queen has a powerful enemy\r\nin Don Carlos and his wife, but she is very courageous and very clever.\r\nIt is a singular coincidence that there should be a young Queen in\r\nSpain as well as in Portugal. At 7 we 4 dined. I stayed up till 9....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 9th December._—At 5 we dined. Sir John dined here. At ½ past\r\n6 we went to the play to Drury Lane with Lady Conroy, Lehzen, and\r\nSir John. It was Shakespear’s tragedy of _King John_. The principal\r\ncharacters were: King John, Mr. Macready,[142] who acted _beautifully_;\r\nPrince Arthur, Miss Poole, who acted delightfully; Hubert, Mr. Bennett\r\nwho acted well; Faulconbridge, Mr. Cooper, who also acted well; Philip\r\nKing of France, Mr. Diddear; Louis the Dauphin, Mr. Brendal; Archduke\r\nof Austria, Mr. Thompson; Queen Elinor, Mrs. Faucit[143]; the Lady\r\nConstance, Mrs. Sloman; Blanche of Castile, Miss Murray. The second\r\npiece was the melo-drama of _The Innkeeper’s Daughter_, which is very\r\nhorrible but _extremely interesting_, but it would take me too much\r\ntime to relate the story of it. The characters were: Richard, Mr.\r\nCooper, who acted _very well_; Frankland, Mr. Ayliffe; Monkton, Mr.\r\nThompson; Langley, Mr. Tayleure; Harrop, Mr. Webster,[144] who looked\r\n_horrid_ but acted well; he was one of the leading characters in\r\nthe play; Edward Harrop, Mr. Richardson; Wentworth, Mr. Baker; Hans\r\nKetzler, Mr. T. P. Cooke, who acted very well; Tricksey, Mr. Hughes;\r\nWilliam, Mr. Howell; White, Mr. East; Smith, Mr. Henry; Allsop, Mr. S.\r\nJones; Mary, Miss Kelly,[145] who acted _quite beautifully_; she is\r\nquite mature. Marian, Mrs. Broad. We came to the very beginning and\r\nstayed to the very end. We came home at 10 minutes past 12. I was VERY\r\nMUCH AMUSED....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 26th December._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 9 we\r\nbreakfasted. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came Captain Burnes who\r\nhas lately travelled over Northern East India. He gave us some very\r\ninteresting accounts. He likewise brought with him to show us, his\r\nservant, a native of Cabul, dressed in his native dress. He is called\r\nGulam Hussein; is of a dark olive complexion and had a dress of real\r\nCashmere made in the beautiful valley of Cashmere.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 27th December._—At ½ past 2 came Mr. T. Griffiths to lecture\r\non Physics. The plan of the lecture was: Introductory—Objects of\r\nAlchymy, viz.

All these different\r\nsubjects were illustrated by very curious and interesting experiments.\r\nIt was over at ½ past 3. Lehzen, Lady Conroy, Victoire, the Dean, and\r\nSir John were likewise present. I was _very much amused_....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 30th December._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 9 we\r\nbreakfasted. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came Mr. Walker to\r\nlecture. The plan of the lecture was: Properties of Matter—Particles\r\ninfinitely small, divisible, and hard—Cohesion—Capillary attraction,\r\nMagnetic attraction, &c., &c.—Repulsion exhibited in various ways,\r\nas counteracting the preceding influences—Recapitulation—Mechanics:\r\nGravity considered, its effects on descending and projected\r\nbodies—National weights and measures—Vis inertia, momentum,\r\nwhat—Mechanical Powers, explained by various machines, applications,\r\n&c. &c.—Draft of horses—Defect of wheel carriages, road, &c. pointed\r\nout—Some improvements suggested—Removal of Great Stone of St.\r\nPetersburg. The lecture lasted till a ¼ to 4. Lehzen, Lady Conroy,\r\nthe Dean, and Sir John were present besides ourselves. At a ¼ to 7 we\r\ndined. Sir John dined here. At a ¼ past 8 we went with Lehzen, Lady\r\nConroy, and Sir John to the play to Covent Garden. We came in for the\r\nlast scene of _Gustavus_, the Masqued Ball, and stayed the whole of\r\nthe pantomime, which is called “_Old Mother Hubbard and her Dog; or\r\nHarlequin and Tales of the Nursery_.” The scenery was very pretty and\r\nthe principal characters were: Venus, Miss Lee; Cupid, Miss Poole who\r\nappeared in three other dresses: as a peasant boy, as a drummer, and\r\nas Mother Hubbard, and she looked _very_ pretty and acted very well\r\nindeed. Old Mother Hubbard, Mr. Wieland; Schock (her dog), Master\r\nW. Mitchinson. The Duchess Griffinwinkle Blowsabella (afterwards\r\nPantaloon), Mr. Barnes. King Rundytundy O (afterwards Dandy Lover),\r\nMr. W. H. Payne. The Princess Graciosa (afterwards Columbine), a very\r\npretty person, Miss Foster. Prince Percineth (afterwards Harlequin) Mr.\r\nEllar. Head Cook (afterwards Clown) Mr. T. Mathews. The panorama at the\r\nend was also pretty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  The year 1834 was spent very quietly by Princess Victoria. Her\r\n  education progressed in simple and placid grooves, but her visits\r\n  to the opera and the theatre became more frequent. She became\r\n  devoted to Italian opera, and formed an attachment to music of the\r\n  Italian school from which even Prince Albert, steeped as he was in\r\n  German music, never contrived to wean her. She accepted then, and\r\n  ever afterwards, Giulia Grisi as the supreme singer and artist.\r\n  From the month of June, when she was present at a Festival in\r\n  Westminster Abbey, to the end of the autumn, she devoted herself,\r\n  at St. Leonards and at Tunbridge Wells, to the study of music and\r\n  singing and to practising upon the harp.\r\n\r\n  This year the Whig Ministry of Lord Grey tottered and fell. In July\r\n  King William, much to the surprise of politicians on both sides,\r\n  entrusted Lord Melbourne with the formation of a Government. The\r\n  King wanted a coalition and made a tentative effort to achieve it,\r\n  but he did not succeed in obtaining the co-operation of either\r\n  Party. It was not anticipated that Lord Melbourne’s Government\r\n  could last. In the month of November Lord Spencer died, and Lord\r\n  Althorp, his son, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, seized with\r\n  unrestrained delight the opportunity to retire from public life.\r\n  Lord Melbourne thereupon resigned, and Sir Robert Peel, returning\r\n  hurriedly from Rome, formed an administration likewise destined to\r\n  be short-lived.\r\n\r\n  If King William had some difficulty in finding a stable Ministry,\r\n  his brother-monarch across the Channel was in no better plight.\r\n  The Parliamentary difficulties in France reached a stage of such\r\n  complexity, that it looked for a moment as if the French monarchy\r\n  itself might succumb to the vehemence of political and partisan\r\n  strife. The Citizen-King found it necessary to employ 100,000\r\n  troops to keep in awe the three cities of Paris, Marseilles, and\r\n  Lyons. At this moment died Lafayette, one of the last links between\r\n  the opening and concluding discords of the French Revolution. It\r\n  was during this year that two foreigners of eminence, long resident\r\n  in England, finally disappeared from London society. Princess\r\n  Lieven left the Russian, and Talleyrand the French Embassy.\r\n\r\n  This year, too, saw the destruction, by fire, of the old Houses\r\n  of Parliament, associated with so many historic memories. None of\r\n  these events, however, caused a ripple upon the surface of the\r\n  little Princess’s secluded life at Kensington.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                                 1834\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 16th January._—About a fortnight or three weeks ago I\r\nreceived the Order of Maria Louisa, accompanied by a very flattering\r\nletter from Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain, in the name of her\r\ndaughter Queen Isabel the 2nd. Having some time ago asked for the\r\nhandwriting of Her Majesty for my collection, the Queen hearing of it,\r\nsent me the Order accompanied by a very gracious letter. The Order is a\r\nviolet and white ribbon, to which is suspended (en négligé) an enamel\r\nsort of star, and in high dress one superbly studded with diamonds.[146]\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 13th April._—At 10 we went to prayers with Lady Theresa[147]\r\nand Lehzen. The service was performed by the Dean, who gave us likewise\r\na very good sermon. It was taken from the 3rd chapter of Acts, 23rd\r\nverse: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, a Prophet shall the Lord\r\nyour God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye\r\nhear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come\r\nto pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be\r\ndestroyed from among the people.” At 1 we lunched. At 7 we 3 and Lady\r\nTheresa also dined. After dinner came Aunt Sophia. I stayed up till a ¼\r\nto 9.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 14th April._—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At ½ past 8\r\nwe all breakfasted. As I am now about to return to my usual studies, I\r\nmust not omit to mention how very anxious my dear Mamma was throughout\r\nmy indisposition, and how unceasing _dear_ Lehzen was in her attentions\r\nand care to me....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 19th April._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 9 we\r\nbreakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till ½ past 10. At 12 we\r\nwent out walking. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came the Duchess of\r\nNorthumberland. At 3 came Lady Robert Grosvenor[148] with her little\r\ngirl Victoria. She is a dear little child, so clever and intelligent.\r\nAt 4 came Mrs. Anderson till 5. At 6 we dined. At a ¼ past 7 we went\r\nwith Lady Conroy, Lehzen and Sir John to the Opera. We came in just at\r\nthe beginning of the Opera of _Anna Boulena_. The characters were: Anna\r\nBoulena, Mdlle. Guiletta Grisi.[149] She is a most beautiful singer and\r\nactress and is likewise very young and pretty. She sang _beautifully_\r\nthroughout but particularly in the last scene when she is mad, which\r\nshe _acted_ likewise _beautifully_. Giovanna Seymour, Mrs. E. Seguin,\r\nwho sings very well. Enrico, Signor Tambourini, who sang beautifully.\r\nRicardo Percy, M. Ivanhoff, who sings very well. He has a very\r\npleasing though not a very strong voice. Between the acts there was a\r\ndivertissement, in which Mdlle. Theresa Elsler danced a pas de deux\r\nwith Mons. T. Guerinot, and Mdlle. Fanny Elsler with M. Perrot. Mdlle.\r\nFanny danced beautifully; she ran up the stage on the tips of her toes\r\nin a most extraordinary manner. She likewise made many other pretty\r\nlittle steps. M. Perrot (whom I had never seen before) danced likewise\r\nquite beautifully. We went away as soon as the 2nd act of the opera was\r\nover. We came home at 12. I was VERY MUCH AMUSED INDEED!...\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 26th April._—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to 8. At 9\r\nwe breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till 11. The Duchess of\r\nNorthumberland was present. At 12 we went to pay a visit to Aunt\r\nGloucester. At 1 we lunched. At 3 came Mr. Steward till 4. At 4 came\r\nMrs. Anderson till 5. At 6 we dined. Sir John dined here. At a ¼ past 7\r\nwe went with Lehzen and Sir John to the Opera. We came in just at the\r\nbeginning of the opera of _Otello_. The characters were: Otello, Signor\r\nRubini who sang quite beautifully and acted very well. Iago, Signor\r\nTambourini who sung likewise _beautifully_. Rodrigo, M. Ivanhoff who\r\nsung _very well_.——Signor Zuchello. Desdemona, Signora Giuletta Grisi.\r\nShe _sang_ and _acted_ quite beautifully! and looked lovely. She acted\r\nand sang _most sweetly and beautifully_ in the last scene; and also in\r\nthe two trios in the 1st and 2nd acts. When the opera was over she was\r\ncalled for, and she came on, led by Rubini. At that moment a wreath of\r\nroses with a small roll of paper inside was thrown on the stage; Rubini\r\npicked it up and placed it on her head. They were very much applauded.\r\nWe came away directly after the opera. Lord Ilchester[150] and Lady\r\nTheresa joined us there. We came home at a ¼ to 12. I was VERY MUCH\r\nAMUSED INDEED!!!...\r\n\r\n_Monday, 28th April._—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to 8. At a ¼ to 9\r\nwe breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till a ¼ past 11. The Duchess\r\nof Northumberland was present. At 12 Lehzen and I drove out. At 1 we\r\nlunched. At 3 came Mr. Steward till 4. I then went to the painting\r\nroom. At 7 we dined. After dinner while we were playing on the piano,\r\narrived Uncle Ferdinand[151] and Charles.[152] Uncle Ferdinand is\r\nMamma’s second brother and she had not seen him for _16 years_! I have\r\nnow seen all my uncles, except Uncle Mensdorff[153] (Aunt Sophie’s\r\nhusband), for Mamma’s eldest brother, Uncle Ernest,[154] was here 3\r\nyears ago, the same year Uncle Leopold went to Belgium. Charles is\r\nlooking very well and is grown much fatter. Uncle Ferdinand is not at\r\nall like my other Uncles. He is fair. It is a great pleasure for me to\r\nsee both Uncle Ferdinand and Charles. I stayed up till 9....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 5th June._—At 11 arrived my DEAREST sister Feodora whom I\r\nhad not seen for _6 years_. She is accompanied by Ernest, her husband,\r\nand her two eldest children Charles and Eliza. Dear Feodora looks very\r\nwell but is grown much stouter since I saw her. She was married on the\r\n18th of February 1828 and went away to Germany a week after and she\r\nnever came here again since. Hohenlohe looks also very well. As for\r\nthe children they are the DEAREST little loves I ever saw. Charles is\r\n4 years and a half old. He is very tall and is a sweet good-tempered\r\nlittle fellow. He is not handsome but he is a very nice-looking boy.\r\nHe has light blue eyes and fair hair. Eliza is 3 years and a half\r\nold; she is also very tall and is a _perfect_ little beauty. She\r\nhas immense dark brown eyes and a very small mouth and light brown\r\nhair. She is very clever and amusing. We then showed her their rooms,\r\nand afterwards, at ½ past 12, we went to see the dear children take\r\ntheir dinner. They took it with Mr. Rol, Charles’s tutor. At 1 we all\r\nlunched, that is to say, Mamma, dear Feodore, Ernst Hohenlohe, Charly,\r\nLehzen, and I. After luncheon, Feodore and the others went upstairs. At\r\n2 Charles and Eliza came down and stayed with us alone. They are _dear\r\nsweet_ children; not at all shy and _so_ good; they never hurt or spoil\r\nanything. At a little after 2 came Lady Westminster.[155] The _dear_\r\nchildren behaved _so_ well. They are so very sensible. They staid till\r\nafter 3. Eliza speaks German and French very nicely. She has a French\r\nSwiss bonne called Louise who speaks French with her. At ½ past 4 we\r\nwent out driving with _dear_ Feodore and Lehzen. We came home at 6. At\r\n7 we dined. Besides dearest Feodore, Ernest, Charles and Lehzen, Sir J.\r\nConroy dined here. When the 2nd course was put on, Charles and Eliza\r\ncame in, and staid there. They were very funny and amusing and talked\r\nimmensely. They staid up till ½ past 8. At ½ past 9 we went to\r\nthe Opera with Ernst Hohenlohe, Charles, Lehzen, and Sir John Conroy,\r\npoor _dear_ Feodora being too tired to go. We came in at about the\r\nmiddle of the 2nd act of Rossini’s Opera of _L’Assiedo di Corrinto_.\r\nIt is in 3 acts. The principal characters are: Mahomet (Emperor of\r\nthe Turks), Signor Tamburini, who sang beautifully and looked _very\r\nwell_. Cleomene (Governor of Corrinto), Mons. Ivanoff who likewise sang\r\nvery well. Nioclene, Signor Rubini who also sang quite beautifully.\r\nPamira, Mdlle. Giuletta Grisi, who sang quite beautifully and acted\r\nand looked _extremely well_. It was Laporte’s benefit, and the first\r\ntime this opera was ever performed in this country. Then followed the\r\n2nd act of _La Sylphide_ in which Taglioni made her first appearance\r\nsince an absence of some months. She danced quite beautifully, quite\r\nas if she flew in the air, so gracefully and lightly. She looked also\r\nvery well. There was also a Pas de Trois danced by Mdlles. Theresa and\r\nFanny Elsler and Mons. Theodore. Mdlle. Fanny danced _beautifully_. We\r\ncame home at 10 minutes to 1. There is only one thing wanting to my\r\nhappiness in being with my dear sister and her children, that is that I\r\ncannot share that happiness with one whom I love so very dearly but who\r\nis far far away—that is my _most dear_ Uncle Ferdinand....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.S.H. Princess Adelaide of Hohenlohe-Langenburg from a\r\n  portrait by Gutekunst_]\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 11th June._—_Dear_ little Eliza and Charles came down to\r\nbreakfast. Eliza came into my room and staid with me for some time.\r\nShe is a dear good little girl. At 1 we lunched. Eliza came again\r\ninto my room and staid with me for nearly an hour. At 3 we went with\r\nLady Flora Hastings[156] and Lehzen to Windsor on a visit to their\r\nMajesties. We were very sorry to leave the dear children. At a ¼\r\npast 5 we arrived at Windsor. The Queen, _dear_ Feodore, Ernest and\r\nseveral ladies and gentlemen of the court, received us at the door\r\nand conducted us upstairs to the Queen’s room, where the King was. I\r\nwas very happy to see my _dear_ sister again. Some time afterwards\r\nthe Queen conducted us to our rooms which are very handsome. At 7 we\r\ndined. Besides the King and Queen, Feodore and Ernest, Mamma and I,\r\nLady Flora and Lehzen, there dined there: George Cambridge, the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Richmond,[157] the Duchess of Northumberland, the Duke\r\nof Grafton,[158] the Duke of Dorset,[159] the Duke of Cleveland,[160]\r\nthe Marquis and Marchioness of Conyngham,[161] Lady Clinton (Lady of\r\nthe Bedchamber in Waiting), Lord and Lady Frederick Fitzclarence,[162]\r\nLord Denbigh,[163] Lady Sophia Sidney,[164] Miss Eden,[165] Miss Hope\r\nJohnston, Miss Wilson, Lord Albemarle,[166] Sir Frederick Watson,\r\nColonel Lygon,[167] Mr. Wood,[168] &c., &c. The Queen went first with\r\nErnest, then came the King who led Mamma and I in, and then came\r\nFeodore with the Duke of Richmond. The rest I do not recollect. I sat\r\nbetween the King and the Duke of Dorset. I stayed up till ½ past 9.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 12th June._—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to 8. At ½ past\r\n9 we breakfasted, with the King, the Queen, Feodore, Ernest, George\r\nCambridge, the Duchess of Northumberland, and Lady Clinton. All the\r\nother ladies breakfasted together. We then went into the Queen’s room.\r\nAt a ¼ past 12 we went to Ascot Races with the whole company in 9\r\ncarriages. In the first went the King, the Queen, Mamma and I. In the\r\nsecond Feodore, the Duchess of Richmond, the Duchess of Northumberland\r\nand Lady Clinton. In the third Lady Flora, Lady Sophia Sydney, the Duke\r\nof Richmond, and the Duke of Cleveland. In the fourth Lehzen, Miss\r\nHope Johnston, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Dorset. How all the\r\nothers went I do not know. At about 1 we arrived on the race course and\r\nentered the King’s stand with all our party. The races were very good\r\nand there was an immense concourse of people there of all ranks. At\r\nabout ½ past 2 we had luncheon. At a little after 6 we left the stand\r\nand returned to the castle in the same way as we came except that, as\r\nit rained very hard, we came home in shut carriages. At 7 we arrived at\r\nthe castle. At ½ past 7 we dined. The company at dinner were the same\r\nas yesterday with the exception of Lord and Lady Conyngham not dining\r\nhere, and a few other gentlemen having dined here. We went in in the\r\nsame way. I sat between the King and the Duke of Cleveland. I stayed up\r\ntill a ¼ to 11. I was very much amused indeed at the races....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 27th July._—At 9 we breakfasted. How sad I felt at breakfast\r\nnot to see the door open and DEAR Feodore come in smiling and leading\r\nher dear little girl; and not to get the accustomed morning kiss\r\nfrom her. At 11 we went to the chapel with Lehzen, Lady Conroy, and\r\nVictoire. The Bishop of London preached a very fine sermon. Victoire\r\nConroy stayed till ½ past 2. At 1 we lunched. I missed dear Feodore\r\nhere again terribly. I miss her so much to-day. She used to be with\r\nme so much on Sunday always. We used to talk together so pleasantly.\r\nLast Sunday afternoon she painted in my room. At ½ past 3 we went with\r\nLehzen to visit Aunt Gloucester, and then drove home through the park.\r\nHow dull that drive appeared to me without dear Feodore. We came home\r\nat ½ past 5. At 7 we dined. After dinner came Aunt Sophia. We passed a\r\nsad dull evening. I stayed up till a ¼ to 9....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 5th October._— ... The news were received a few days ago that\r\nDom Pedro, Regent of Portugal,[169] was dead. He expired on the 24th\r\ninstant, at the age of 35. His daughter, Donna Maria, the young Queen,\r\nthough only 15, is declared of age and able to govern by herself. The\r\nlovely young Empress is left a widow at the age of 22 only. It is a sad\r\nsituation both for the young Queen and the poor Empress, in whom both I\r\ntake the greatest interest as I know them personally. I saw Dom Pedro\r\nwhen he was in England about 3 years ago. At 11 we went to church. At 1\r\nwe lunched. At ½ past 3 we went out driving with Lady Flora and Lehzen,\r\nin the pony-carriage. We came home in the large carriage at 6. At 7 we\r\ndined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Sir J., Messrs. E., S., and H. C.\r\ndined here. I stayed up till ½ past 9....\r\n\r\nST. LEONARDS, _Wednesday, 4th November_.—I said in my last journal\r\nbook that I would describe in this book all what passed yesterday. We\r\nreached Battle Abbey at about a ¼ to 1. We were received at the door by\r\nLady Webster.[170] Battle Abbey was built by King William the Conqueror\r\nand stands on the site where the famous battle of Hastings was fought.\r\nThe place is still preserved where Harold fell. She showed us first\r\ninto a large hall supposed to be the highest in England. There are\r\nportraits of King Charles the 2nd, King William the 3rd, and Queen\r\nAnne in it, &c. &c. There is also a very large picture of the battle of\r\nHastings. Some old suits of armour are also in the hall. We saw also\r\nwhat were the cloisters now turned into a room. We saw the Beggars’\r\nHall, a curious walk of the monks, and the garden. We lastly partook of\r\nsome refreshment in a very pretty room in which there was a picture of\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon, not full length, only to the waist; which is said\r\nto be very like. The outside of the abbey is very fine too. We left it\r\nagain at ½ past 1. The tenants again accompanied us till Broadeslowe.\r\nThere some gentlemen from Hastings met us and accompanied us to St.\r\nLeonards. We passed under an arch formed of laurels and decorated with\r\nflowers and inscriptions. As soon as we passed the 2nd arch the Mayor\r\ngot out of his carriage and came to our door asking leave to precede\r\nus in his carriage. An immense concourse of people walking with the\r\ncarriage. The mayor and aldermen preceding us in carriages as also\r\na band of music. Throughout Hastings the houses were decorated with\r\nflowers, ribands and inscriptions, and arches of flowers and laurels.\r\nLadies and children waving handkerchiefs and laurels on the balconies\r\nand at the windows. Cries of “Welcome, welcome, Royal visitors,” were\r\nconstantly heard. We reached Hastings at ½ past 2, and it was 4 o’clock\r\nbefore we arrived at our house at St. Leonards. It was indeed a most\r\nsplendid reception. We stepped out on the balcony and were loudly\r\ncheered. One sight was extremely pretty. Six fishermen in rough blue\r\njackets, red caps and coarse white aprons, preceded by a band, bore a\r\nbasket ornamented with flowers, full of fish as a present for us. We\r\nfound _dear_ Dashy in perfect health. Our house is very comfortable.\r\nAt 6 we dined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Messrs. E., S., H., and Sir\r\nJ. C. dined here. After 8 the fireworks began and lasted till 9. They\r\nwere very fine. I stayed up till 9.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 5th November._—I awoke this morning at 7 and got up at ½\r\npast 7. At 9 we breakfasted. At 12 Mamma received an address from the\r\nMayor, Corporation, and Inhabitants of Hastings and St. Leonards. After\r\n1 we lunched. At 7 we dined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Messrs. E.,\r\nS., and Sir J. C. dined here.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 11th November._— ... At ½ past 11 we went out driving in the\r\nbarouche with Lady Flora and Lehzen. We got out and walked and sent the\r\nbarouche home. We afterwards got into the close landau with a postilion\r\nand horse in hand. As we came to the commencement of the town where a\r\nseminary is to be built, the hand-horse kicked up and getting entangled\r\nin the traces fell down, pulling the other with it; the horse with the\r\npostilion however instantly recovered itself but the other remained on\r\nthe ground kicking and struggling most violently. Two gentlemen very\r\ncivilly came and held the horse’s head down while we all got out as\r\nfast as possible. I called for poor dear little Dashy who was in the\r\nrumble; Wood (our footman) took him down and I ran on with him in my\r\narms calling Mamma to follow, Lehzen and Lady Flora followed us also.\r\nThey then cut the traces, the horse still struggling violently. The\r\nother horse which had been quite quiet, being frightened by the other’s\r\nkicking, backed and fell over into a foundation pit, while Wood held\r\nhim, and he (Wood) with difficulty prevented himself from falling; the\r\nhorse recovering himself ran after us and we instantly ran behind a\r\nlow stone wall; but the horse went along the road, and a workman took\r\nhim and gave him to Wood. The other horse had ceased kicking and got\r\nup. We ought to be _most grateful_ to Almighty God for His merciful\r\nprovidence in thus preserving us, for it was a _very narrow escape_.\r\nBoth Wood and Bacleberry behaved very well indeed. The names of the two\r\ngentlemen who held the horse’s head are Rev. Mr. Gould and Mr. Peckham\r\nMicklethwaite.[171] The latter I am sorry to say was hurt, but not very\r\nmaterially. The poor horse is cut from head to foot; but the other is\r\nnot at all hurt only very much frightened. We walked home....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 30th November._— ... We went to church with Lady Flora and\r\nLehzen. Mr. Randolph preached a most beautiful sermon. It was taken\r\nfrom the 6th chapter of St. Paul’s 2nd Epistle to the Corinthians, 1st\r\nand 2nd verses. “We then, as workers together with Him, beseech you\r\nalso that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. For He saith, I\r\nhave heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I\r\nsuccoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the\r\nday of salvation.” At 1 we lunched. At 3 came Victoire Conroy till a ¼\r\npast 6. At 7 we dined. Jane, Victoire, Messrs. E., H., and Sir J. C.\r\ndined here.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 2nd December._—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. We\r\nreceived this morning the news that my poor Uncle, the Duke of\r\nGloucester,[172] was dead. He expired on Sunday evening, the 30th of\r\nNovember, 1834, at 20 minutes to 7. I am very sorry that we have lost\r\nhim as he was always a _most affectionate_ and _kind_ Uncle to me. Aunt\r\nMary, I hear, bears her loss wonderfully. Poor Aunt Sophia Matilda,\r\nhis only sister and who was excessively fond of him, is dreadfully\r\ndistressed at losing her only brother. But her piety will enable her to\r\nbear this great loss. He was so kind to think of us the morning before\r\nhe died. Aunt S. Matilda told him that we had asked how he was, upon\r\nwhich he answered, “Tell them that I say, God bless them, and that I\r\nlove them.” This kind message proved the quiet state of mind he was in.\r\nHe showed such piety, such peace and resignation, that that proved a\r\ngreat comfort to his poor sister. He was in his 59th year....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 23rd December._— ... I received from _dear_ Uncle Leopold\r\nthis morning some most interesting autographs which are: Louis Seize’s,\r\nMarie Antoinette’s, Henri IV.’s, the Duke of Marlborough’s, the Empress\r\nMaria Theresa’s and her husband’s, and Lafayette’s....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 28th December._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 20 minutes to\r\n8. At 9 we breakfasted. At 11 we went to church with Lady Flora and\r\nLehzen. Mr. Randolph preached a very fine sermon. It was taken from the\r\n1st chapter of St. Matthew, 21st verse: “And she shall bring forth a\r\nSon, and thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people\r\nfrom their sins.” At ½ past 1 we lunched. I forgot to mention that I\r\nreceived this morning a very kind letter from dear Uncle Leopold,\r\naccompanied by a beautiful shawl and the autographs of Louis XV., his\r\nQueen, Marie Leczinska, and the Dauphin, father to Louis XVI. At ½ past\r\n2 we went out with Lady Flora and Lehzen and came home after 3....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  The Princess attached importance to this year of her life. It\r\n  appeared to her that she benefited more fully by her lessons,\r\n  and began to realise their importance. About a month after her\r\n  birthday she was confirmed at the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, by the\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury. She was impressed by the solemnity of\r\n  the occasion and frightened by the austerity of Archbishop Howley.\r\n  This year marked an epoch in ways other than spiritual. She was\r\n  allowed more freely to mix with her mother’s guests. Personages of\r\n  distinction were asked to meet her, and she had an opportunity of\r\n  seeing some of the more eminent of those who were to be her future\r\n  subjects, although she had scant opportunity of getting to know\r\n  them well.\r\n\r\n  She went to Ascot this year in the Royal Procession, and then,\r\n  in the autumn, her mother arranged for her a Progress on the\r\n  lines of that which is recorded in her Journals of 1832. There\r\n  is nothing, however, to show that she was alive to the trend of\r\n  public events. The existence of Lord Melbourne’s second Ministry\r\n  was precarious. It was said that Lord Melbourne had against him the\r\n  King, the Church, the Bar, the Agricultural and Monied interest,\r\n  and a large minority in the House of Commons; whereas he only\r\n  had in his favour a small majority in the House of Commons, the\r\n  manufacturing towns, and a portion of the rabble. This was the Tory\r\n  analysis of the political situation in 1835. “Threatened men and\r\n  threatened Ministries enjoy a long life,” and Lord Melbourne’s was\r\n  no exception.\r\n\r\n  The Princess was in frequent communication by letter with her\r\n  Uncle, King Leopold. He sent her many interesting autographs for\r\n  the collection she at that time was forming. They corresponded\r\n  about books. It was he who recommended her Sully’s _Memoirs_,\r\n  which, as her Journals show, she assiduously read, and he now\r\n  and then referred in admonitory terms to her future regal\r\n  responsibilities and duties.\r\n\r\n  On one occasion he sent her an extract from a French Memoir\r\n  containing a severe criticism on the political character of Queen\r\n  Anne, to which she replied that as he had endeavoured to point out\r\n  to her what a Queen “ought not to be,” she hoped he would give her\r\n  some idea of what a Queen “ought to be.” Those who are familiar\r\n  with the character and disposition of King Leopold can imagine that\r\n  he responded willingly to the invitation. It was upon this note\r\n  that the year 1835 came to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                                 1835\r\n\r\n_Monday, 5th January._—I quite forgot to mention that on the morning\r\nof the 20th of November a ship laden with either coal or chalk sank,\r\nbut all the crew came off safe. Lieutenant Gilley and five men put off\r\nin a boat from the 3rd Martello Tower, in hopes of being able to save\r\nsome of the goods of the sunken ship. The sea was very high, the boat\r\nslight and over-loaded, and they had scarcely left the shore when the\r\nboat was upset and they were _all six drowned_! The poor sister of the\r\nLieutenant is residing here. Three of the poor men were married and\r\nleft their poor widows (all young) plunged in the greatest grief. The\r\nbody of Weeks, one of the married men and who had 3 children, was found\r\ntwo days after, at Pevensey. The poor Lieutenant’s body was only found\r\nlast Sunday, the 28th December, quite near here; and one of the other\r\nmarried men, called Conely, who had 4 children, was found the next\r\nmorning near Hastings; and Andrews, the last married man, who had only\r\nbeen married a very short time, was found on Wednesday night, the 31st\r\nDecember, in the same place. It was a great gratification to the poor\r\nwidows that their husbands’ bodies have been found. We saw two of them\r\nat a distance the other day. They are all very decent-looking, tidy\r\nand nice people. At a ¼ to 12 we went out walking with Lehzen till 1.\r\nAs we walked along by the towers we met Mrs. Weeks, one of the widows,\r\nwith her little girl. She had a widow-cap and bonnet on, and a Scotch\r\ncloak. She looks as pale as death but has a mild sweet expression....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 24th January._—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ past 8. At ½\r\npast 9 we breakfasted. At 10 came the Dean till 20 minutes to 11. It\r\nwas yesterday _15 years_ that it pleased God to take my _most beloved_\r\nPapa from us. Alas! _I_ was but 6 months when this affliction came upon\r\nus; and I therefore never had the happiness to know him....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 27th January._—I awoke at ½ past 7, got up at a ¼ past 8. At\r\n½ past 9 we breakfasted. At 1 we lunched. I ought to have mentioned\r\nthat besides my lessons with the Dean (and also when my other masters\r\ncome) I have many occupations with Lehzen. And now, though we are\r\nall in the bustle of packing, I am constantly employed by myself in\r\nvarious ways; and I read French History to Lehzen, and one of Racine’s\r\ntragedies with her in the afternoons which I delight in. I _love_ to be\r\n_employed_; I _hate_ to be _idle_....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 29th January._—I awoke at ½ past 5 and got up at 7. At 8\r\nwe all breakfasted. At a ¼ to 9 we left St. Leonards. Dear Lehzen,\r\nLady Flora, Lady Conroy &c. following in another carriage. All\r\nour acquaintances were out to see us go (except Mr. and Lady Mary\r\nDundas).... For some reasons I am sorry we have left St. Leonards,\r\nwhich are, the nice walks, the absence of fogs, and looking out of my\r\nwindow and seeing the people walk on the esplanade, and seeing the sun\r\nrise and set, which was quite beautiful. The rising began by the sky\r\nbeing quite pink and blending softly into a bright blue, and the sun\r\nrose by degrees from a little red streak to a ball of red copper. The\r\nsetting began by the whole horizon being orange, crimson and blue, and\r\nthe sun sunk down a ball of fiery gold dyeing the sands crimson. But\r\nthen again my reasons for _not_ being sorry to go are, my not sleeping\r\nwell there, my not having been well, and the roaring of the sea. We\r\nchanged horses first at Battle, then at Stony Crouch, then at Woodgate,\r\nwhich was quite near _dear_ Tunbridge, then at Sevenoaks, and lastly at\r\nBromley. We reached Kensington Palace at 5. My room is very prettily\r\nnewly papered, newly furnished, and has a new carpet, and looks very\r\npretty indeed. Our bedroom also newly papered and furnished and looks\r\nvery nice and clean. Pedro and my dear little wax-bills came quite\r\nsafe. Dear Dashy was in our carriage and behaved like a darling....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 6th April._—The melancholy news were received yesterday of the\r\ndeath of the Prince Augustus, Duke of Leuchtenberg,[173] which happened\r\non the 28th of March. It is a _most lamentable_ and dreadful event.\r\nHis Royal Highness was in his 25th year, and in the flower of his age.\r\nYoung, amiable, good and well-meaning; for since his arrival at Lisbon\r\nhe had won the hearts of many by his affability and good-nature. He\r\ncaught a cold, which he neglected and it ended in the quinsy. It is\r\nreally quite dreadful for the poor young Queen, who is now left a widow\r\nat the early age of 16! Her Majesty completed her 16th year on the 4th\r\nof this month. It is likewise dreadful for his amiable and accomplished\r\nsister the young Empress-widow, who is still in mourning for her\r\nhusband, Dom Pedro; and also dreadful for his mother, the Duchess of\r\nLeuchtenberg. Not two months ago he was seen leading his young bride\r\nfrom the altar, and now all that prospect of happiness is cut off!...\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 2nd May._— ... At 6 we dined. Lady Flora dined here. At\r\na ¼ past 7 we went to the opera with dear Lehzen and Lady Flora. It\r\nwas Rossini’s opera seria of _Otello_ in 3 acts. The characters were:\r\nDesdemona, Mdlle. Grisi, who looked BEAUTIFUL and sung MOST EXQUISITELY\r\nand acted BEAUTIFULLY. She personates the meek and ill-treated\r\nDesdemona in a most _perfect_ and _touching_ manner. Elmiro (a Venetian\r\npatrician and father to Desdemona), Signor Lablache who sang and acted\r\nbeautifully.... The finest parts are: the song which Otello sings in\r\nthe 1st scene of the 1st act, and which Rubini sang beautifully. The\r\nduet between Iago and Roderigo in the 1st act which Tamburini and\r\nIvanoff sang beautifully together. The song which Desdemona sings\r\nwhen she first comes on in the first act, which begins “Stanca di più\r\ncombattere,” and which Grisi sung _most exquisitely_! (It is not by\r\nRossini; it is composed expressly for Grisi by Marliani.) The Finale\r\nto the 1st act which commences with that beautiful trio, “Ti parli\r\nl’amore,” between Elmiro, Roderigo, and Desdemona, which Lablache,\r\nIvanoff and Grisi sang most beautifully. It was enchored. And when\r\nOtello comes on and declares her to be his wife and Elmiro in his rage\r\nexclaims: “Empia! ti maledico!” and which Lablache did in a manner\r\n_most splendid_ while Desdemona falls at his feet. The Duet between\r\nIago and Otello in the 2nd act which Tamburini and Rubini sang most\r\nbeautifully. The duet between Roderigo and Otello which follows it and\r\nwhich was likewise beautifully sung. When Desdemona enquires from the\r\npeople if Otello (who had fought with Roderigo) still lives, and when\r\nshe exclaims in delight: “Altro non chiede il cor,” and which Grisi\r\ndid in a most splendid manner; and when at the end of the 3rd act she\r\nkneels before her father and says, “L’error d’un infelice pietoso in me\r\nperdona: Se il padre m’abbandona, da chi sperar pieta?” which she did\r\nin a most touching manner. The song in the 3rd act with the harp which\r\nGrisi sung most _beautifully_, as also the prayer; and when Otello\r\ncomes on to stab her and she reproaches him exclaiming: “Uccidimi se\r\nvuoi, perfido, ingrato”; which Grisi did in such a mild and pathetic\r\nmanner. He then stabs her and immediately afterwards himself. Grisi and\r\nRubini were called out and were loudly applauded. We came in before the\r\noverture was begun and came away directly after the opera was over. It\r\nis a beautiful opera and I like it much better than _Anna Boulena_....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 6th May._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At a ¼ past 9 we\r\nbreakfasted. At 11 we set off with Lady Flora and Lehzen for Windsor\r\nCastle, where we arrived at ½ past 1. At 2 we all lunched; that is\r\nto say, besides the Queen, the Landgravine,[174] and us two,—the\r\nDuchess of Northumberland, Lady Brownlow,[175] Lady Sophia Cust,\r\nLady De Lisle,[176] Lady Falkland,[177] Lady Flora, Lehzen, the\r\nBaroness de Stein, Miss Mitchel, Miss Hudson, Lord Howe,[178] and Lord\r\nDenbigh.[179] At ½ past 2 we went out walking with the Queen, the\r\nDuchess of Northumberland, Lady Flora, Lady Sophia Cust, Lehzen, Miss\r\nMitchel and Miss Hudson, Lord Howe, Lord Denbigh, Lord Brownlow, and\r\nSir Andrew Bernard. We walked to Adelaide Cottage[180] and all got into\r\ncarriages except the gentlemen who rode. The Queen, Mamma, the Duchess\r\nand I were in one carriage, and all the rest followed in others. We\r\ncame home at 6. At ½ past 7 we dined....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 7th May._— ... At 12 we went all over the Castle with the\r\nKing, the Queen, the Landgravine, the Duchess, Lady Brownlow, Lady\r\nFlora, Lehzen, Miss Mitchel, Lord Howe, Lord Denbigh, Lord Brownlow,\r\nand Sir Andrew Bernard....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 8th May._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At ½ past 8 we\r\nbreakfasted. The Queen came and sat with us at breakfast. At ½ past 9\r\nwe left Windsor with Lady Flora and Lehzen. I was very much pleased\r\nthere, as both my Uncle and Aunt are _so very kind_ to me....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 18th May._— ... At 7 we 3 dined. ½ past 9 we went into the\r\nfirst large room (as in the preceding parties) and received the company\r\n(the list of which is adjoined). The singers which were Grisi, Rubini,\r\nIvanoff, Tamburini, Lablache,[181] and Costa[182] for the piano, had\r\njust arrived. Our people were the same as the other day. When all the\r\ncompany had arrived which was at ½ past 10, we all went into the other\r\nroom which was arranged with chairs all across the room for the people\r\nto sit on. We were in the first row with Aunt Sophia and the Duchess\r\nof Cambridge and quite close to the piano. Grisi is _quite beautiful_\r\noff the stage. She is not tall, and rather pale; and she has such\r\na lovely mild expression in her face. Her face and neck has such a\r\nbeautiful soft shape. She has such beautiful dark eyes with fine long\r\neyelashes, a fine nose, and very sweet mouth. She was dressed in a\r\nwhite flowered silk, with blonde trimmings about the body and sleeves\r\nwhich reached to the elbows. Her beautiful dark hair was as usual quite\r\nflat in front with an amethyst bandeau round it, and a fine plait at\r\nthe very back of her head. She is very quiet, ladylike and unaffected\r\nin her manners. I spoke to her, and she answered in a very pleasing\r\nmanner. She has a very pretty expression when she speaks. Rubini is\r\nshort and not good-looking. Ivanoff is also very short and has a very\r\nsingular Calmuck face. Tamburini is short but very good-looking and\r\ngentlemanlike. Lablache does not look so tall off the stage as he\r\ndoes on it, and is likewise very gentlemanlike. The concert began\r\nwith a trio from _L’Assiedo di Corrinto_, “Destin terribile”; Grisi,\r\nRubini and Ivanoff sang beautifully. Then Tamburini sang “Sorgete”\r\nfrom _L’Assiedo_ beautifully. After this Lablache sang “Dove vai?”\r\nfrom _Guillaume Tell_ beautifully. Then Grisi sang “Tanti affetti,”\r\nan aria from the _Donna del Lago_, most beautifully. Her _lovely_\r\nvoice sounds beautiful in a room. Lablache and Tamburini then sang “Il\r\nrival salvar tu dei” most beautifully. It is from _I Puritani_. They\r\nsing beautifully together. Their two fine voices go so well together.\r\nLablache’s voice is immensely powerful but not too much so (for my\r\ntaste), _even_ in a room. Tamburini’s too is most splendid. He is even\r\na more skilful and finished singer than Lablache. Then came a trio\r\n“Allor che Scorre” from _Guillaume Tell_, between Rubini, Tamburini\r\nand Lablache, which they sang likewise extremely well. This ended the\r\n1st act. Near the end of the 1st act Mme. Malibran arrived. She was\r\ndressed in white satin with a scarlet hat and feathers. She is shorter\r\nthan Grisi and _not near so pretty_. We went into the refreshment room\r\nbetween the acts. We then sat down again and the 2nd act began with a\r\n_most lovely_ polonaise, “Son Vergin vezzosa” from _I Puritani_, which\r\nGrisi sang most exquisitely, accompanied by all the singers except\r\nMalibran. Then Grisi and Tamburini sang “Che veggo oh Ciel,” from\r\n_L’Assiedo_ most beautifully together. Malibran then sang a song by\r\nPersiani very well. Her low notes are _beautiful_, but her high notes\r\nare thick and not clear. _I_ like _Grisi by far better_ than her.\r\nThen Grisi and Rubini sang a beautiful duet “Artuor dove sai” from _I\r\nPuritani_ by Bellini, _beautifully_. His voice is delightful in a\r\nroom. It is so sweet and so full of expression. Malibran and Lablache\r\nthen sang a buffa duet “Con pazienza supportiamo,” by Fioravente,\r\nbeautifully. Lablache is _so_ funny and _so_ amusing. Lablache then\r\nsang a Neapolitan air (a buffa song) of his own composition and\r\naccompanying himself, _delightfully_. Then came a quartet “A te oh\r\ncaro!” from the _Puritani_, which Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini, and\r\nLablache sung beautifully. This ended the _most delightful concert I\r\never heard_. Aunt Sophia, who had _never_ heard any of these singers\r\nbefore, was delighted; but no one could be _more enchanted_ than _I_\r\nwas. I shall never forget it. It was Mamma’s birthday present for me!\r\nCosta accompanied on the piano beautifully. I stayed up till 20 minutes\r\npast 1. I was MOST EXCEEDINGLY delighted....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 24th May._—Today is my 16TH birthday! How very old that\r\nsounds; but I feel that the two years to come till I attain my 18th are\r\nthe most important of any almost. I now only begin to appreciate my\r\nlessons, and hope from this time on, to make great progress. I awoke\r\nat ½ past 6. Mamma got up soon after and gave me a lovely brooch made\r\nof her own hair, a letter from herself, one from dearest Feodore with\r\na nosegay, and a drawing and a pair of slippers done by her. I gave\r\nher a drawing I had done. Dear Lehzen gave me a lovely little leather\r\nbox with knives, pencils &c. in it, two small dictionaries and a very\r\npretty print of Mdlle. Taglioni. Mamma gave her a pair of amethyst\r\nearrings and I gave her a penholder and a drawing done by myself.\r\nMy maids Frances and Caroline gave me a pincushion done by Frances\r\nand a portefolio done by Caroline. Anne Mason (Lehzen’s maid) gave\r\na small flower vase with flowers. _Dashy_ gave an ivory basket with\r\nbarley-sugar and chocolate. At 9 we breakfasted. I then received my\r\ntable. From my DEAR Mamma I received a lovely enamel bracelet with her\r\nhair, a pair of fine china vases, a lovely shawl and some English and\r\nItalian books. From dearest Feodore a lovely enamel bracelet with hers\r\nand the children’s hair; from Charles some pretty prints; from Späth\r\na very pretty case for handkerchiefs embroidered in silver; from Sir\r\nRobert and Lady Gardiner a very pretty sort of china vase; from Sir\r\nJ. Conroy a writing-case; from the whole Conroy family some prints;\r\nand from Mr. George Hayter a beautiful drawing done by him. I quite\r\nforgot to say that I received a beautiful pair of sapphire and diamond\r\nearrings from the King and a beautiful prayer-book and very kind letter\r\nfrom the Queen. I also received a prayer-book from a bookseller of\r\nthe name of Hatchard. At 10 we went down to prayers with Lehzen and\r\nCharles. The service was performed by the Dean who gave us likewise\r\na _very_ good sermon. It was taken from the 24th chapter of Joshua,\r\n15th verse: “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose ye\r\nthis day whom ye will serve; but as for me and my house we will serve\r\nthe Lord.” After church, I received a Bible from Sir F. Trench[183]\r\nwith a picture of Norris Castle painted on the margin; and also two\r\nsmall oil pictures from an old Mrs. Pakenham, done by a Mr. King. I\r\nalso saw Mrs. Brock, Sarah (my former maid), and Mrs. Fletcher (our\r\nformer housekeeper). At a ¼ to 1 came Aunt Sophia who gave me with Aunt\r\nGloucester a very pretty diamond brooch. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 2\r\ncame the Duchess of Northumberland, who gave me a very fine fillagree\r\nornament in the shape of a flower, and another little fillagree\r\nornament from Miss Wynn. Lady Flora, who gave me a pretty paper-knife\r\nand penholder of jasper from Arthur’s Seat, the rock which overhangs\r\nEdinburgh. Lady Theresa, who gave me a small pocket-book of her own\r\nwork. Lady Catherine, who gave me a very fine velvet Music-book.\r\nLady Cust, who gave me a very fine japanned box. Sir G. Anson who\r\ngave me a print; Sir Frederick Wetherall, who gave me a little china\r\nscent-bottle. Lady Conroy, Jane, and Victoire. At 3 came the Duke of\r\nSussex, who gave me a gold bracelet with turquoises; and soon after\r\nLady Charlotte St. Maur who gave me a purse of her own work. At a ¼\r\npast 3 came the Landgravine who gave me a head-ornament of emeralds,\r\nand Aunt Augusta, who gave me a chrisoprase bracelet. At 4 came the\r\nDuchess of Cambridge,[184] who brought me a lovely turquoise bracelet\r\nfrom Uncle Cambridge, and gave me a box with sandal-wood instruments in\r\nit; Augusta who gave me a small turquoise ring; and George who gave me\r\nan album with a drawing of his in it. At 20 minutes to 5 we drove out\r\nwith Lehzen and Charles. At 7 we dined, Lady Flora, Lady Conroy, Jane,\r\nVictoire, Messrs E. and H., and Sir J. Conroy dined here. After dinner\r\ncame Aunt Sophia. Mdlle. David (sister to Mme. Dulcken) played on the\r\npiano. I stayed up till ½ past 9. My _dear_ Mamma’s great present was\r\nthat delicious concert which I shall _never forget_....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 9th June._—I awoke at ½ past 8 and got up soon after. At ½\r\npast 9 we breakfasted with the King, the Queen, Charles, the Duchess\r\nof Northumberland, Lady Brownlow, Lady Catherine, and Lehzen. At ½\r\npast 10 we went with the whole party to Eton College to see Eton\r\nMontem. In the first carriage were the King, the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge, and George, who had all 3 just arrived; in\r\nthe 2nd, the Queen, Mamma, I, and Charles; in the 3rd, the Duke and\r\nDuchess of Northumberland and Lady Brownlow; in the 4th Lord and Lady\r\nDenbigh; in the 5th Lady Sophia Cust, Lady De Lisle, Miss Eden, and\r\nMr. Schiffner; in the 6th Lord and Lady Frederick Fitzclarence and\r\ntheir daughter; in the 7th Lehzen, Miss Hudson, and Miss Wilson. All\r\nthe other gentlemen rode. This is as near as I can remember. We were\r\nreceived by the Provost[185] and Dr. Hawtrey.[186] We then went into\r\nthe yard under a sort of veranda and saw all the boys pass by which was\r\na very pretty sight. Some of the costumes were very pretty. Some were\r\ndressed like Greeks, some like archers, others like Scotchmen, &c. We\r\nthen went into the Provost’s house, and from thence saw the boy wave\r\nthe standard. We also saw the Library which is very curious and old.\r\nEton College was founded by King Henry the Sixth. We then re-entered\r\nour carriages and drove to Salt Hill where we again saw the standard\r\nwaved by the boy. We then drove home. The heat the whole time was\r\nTREMENDOUS. We came home at ½ past 1. At 2 we lunched with the King,\r\nthe Queen, the Dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge, George, the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Northumberland, Lord and Lady Brownlow, Lady Denbigh,\r\nLady De Lisle, Lady Sophia Cust, Lady Frederick Fitzclarence, Lord\r\nHowe, Lady Catherine, and Lehzen. At 4 we went out driving. The Queen,\r\nMamma, I and Charles were in the first carriage; the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Northumberland and Lord and Lady Brownlow in the 2nd; Lord Denbigh\r\nand Miss Eden in the 3rd; and Lady Catherine and Lehzen in the 4th. We\r\ndrove to the Virginia Waters. We went on the water there, and at a ¼ to\r\n6 re-entered the carriages and reached home at 7. We went on the steps\r\nbefore the Castle and saw all the boys and many other people walking\r\non the terrace. They cheered the King and Queen _very loudly_, and me\r\nalso. At 8 we dined. We went in to dinner in the same way as yesterday\r\nand the dinner-party was the same, only that Lord and Lady Frederick\r\nwere not there. The Dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge and George had\r\nleft the Castle after luncheon. I stayed up till a ¼ past 10....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 14th July._—At 11 came the Dean till 12. At 12 came Mr.\r\nWestall till 1. At 1 we lunched. The Duchess of Northumberland was\r\npresent at the first lesson. At ½ past 2 I sat to Mr. Collen till ½\r\npast 3. At a ¼ to 4 came the Dean till a ¼ past 4. At 5 we went out\r\nwith Lehzen and came home at 6. At a ¼ to 7 we dined. Lady Theresa\r\ndined here. At 8 we went to the opera with Lady Theresa and Lehzen. It\r\nwas the _dear Puritani_. Grisi was in perfect voice and sang and acted\r\nbeautifully; but I must say that she shows her many fatigues in her\r\nface, and she is certainly much thinner than when she arrived. It is\r\na great pity too that she now wears her front hair so much lower than\r\nshe did. It is no improvement to her appearance, though (do what she\r\nmay) _spoil_ her face she _never_ can, it is too lovely for that. And\r\nbesides, she forgot to change her dress when she came on to sing the\r\nPolacca. In general she comes on to sing that as a bride, attired in a\r\nwhite satin dress with a wreath of white roses round her head; instead\r\nof which she remained in her first dress (likewise very pretty) of\r\nblue satin with a little sort of handkerchief at the back of her head.\r\nLablache, Tamburini and Rubini were also all 3 in high good voice. The\r\nexquisite quartet “A te o cara” and the lovely Polacca “Son vergin\r\nvezzosa” were both encored as was also the _splendid_ duet “Il rival.”\r\nAfter the opera was over, Grisi, Rubini, Lablache, and Tamburini came\r\nout and were loudly applauded. The two last always make a separate bow\r\nto our box, which is very amusing to see. We came away immediately\r\nafter the opera was over, for the ballet is not worth seeing since La\r\nDéesse de la Danse has flown back to Paris again. She appeared for the\r\nlast time on Saturday the 4th of this month. We came home at 10 minutes\r\nto 12. I was _highly amused_ and _pleased_! We came in while Tamburini\r\nwas singing his song, which is just before the lovely duet between\r\nGrisi and Lablache....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.S.H. Princess Sophia of Saxe-Coburg Countess\r\n  Mensdorff Pouilly_\r\n\r\n  _from a portrait by Dickinson_.]\r\n\r\n_Monday, 20th July._—I awoke at 7. Mamma told me this morning that\r\nshe had received the melancholy news last night of the death of my\r\ndear Aunt Sophie, Countess Mensdorff,[187] who was here now nearly\r\ntwo years ago. It is so sudden and unexpected that we were _very much\r\nshocked_, _surprised_ and _distressed_ at the _sad_ news. My poor\r\ndear Aunt had been for many years in very bad health, and when she\r\nvisited us she was unable to walk alone almost; but as we had not heard\r\nthat she was unwell even, it startled and shocked us very much. She\r\nwent from Prague, already very unwell, in spite of Uncle Mensdorff’s\r\nefforts to prevent her, to visit her youngest son Arthur who was in his\r\ngarrison in a wretched little village in Bohemia, and it was there,\r\nfar from her relations (except Uncle Mensdorff and Arthur), without\r\nany of the comforts which she was accustomed to, in a poor sort of\r\ncottage, that she breathed her last! My poor dear Aunt, I feel this\r\nloss _very_ deeply. The more so for having seen her here! At ½ past\r\n9 we breakfasted. At 10 we walked out with Lehzen till ½ past 10.\r\nThe melancholy event happened on the 8th of this month! I feel the\r\nloss of my dear Aunt _very deeply_! Though I should be equally sad at\r\nlosing her, had I _not_ known her, because all Mamma’s relations are\r\n_dear_ to me; but having seen her, having lived with her in the\r\nsame house for more than a week, having been in her room and seen her\r\nat her occupations, and having experienced her great kindness to me\r\npersonally, makes it more striking still, and makes me feel the weight\r\nof the loss we have experienced more. At 1 we lunched. At 5 we drove\r\nout in the country with Lehzen till 7. At ½ past 7 we dined. I stayed\r\nup till a ¼ past 9. We passed a very sad evening....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 23rd July._— ... Mamma received this afternoon a letter from\r\nUncle Ernest enclosing the copy of one written by dear Uncle Mensdorff,\r\ngiving all the sad details about my poor _dear_ Aunt. I fear her\r\nsufferings must have been very severe at first and during her illness;\r\nbut at the last she seems to have had no suffering, no struggle. Her\r\nlast moment was so quiet that Uncle Mensdorff thought she slept, and\r\nwhen he rose at 4 o’clock in the morning, he was pleased to see her\r\nsleep so quietly and said to his servant that he hoped the danger was\r\nover. Alas! how different was it really! My Aunt’s maid went into the\r\nroom and perceiving she did not breathe, called my Uncle in, who then\r\nsaw the dreadful truth! She slept truly, but she slept never more to\r\nwake! What dear Uncle’s feelings were at that moment, and what they\r\nstill are, may be well imagined! She has been placed temporarily in the\r\nvault of the convent of the Elisabetherin Nuns, at Kaden in Bohemia.\r\nThe funeral was splendid. Thousands came from far and near and all her\r\nformer friends followed her to her last abode, where she will suffer no\r\nmore grief or pain! Two regiments with their bands playing the funereal\r\nmusic followed and all the Nuns with burning tapers. They strewed the\r\ncoffin with flowers when it entered the convent, and ornamented the\r\nvault in the same manner. It is a happiness to know that she was so\r\nmuch beloved. My poor dear Aunt, I loved her _dearly_ and feel the loss\r\ndeeply. Time may weaken, but it can never never efface the recollection\r\nof this loss. I shall always try to do what I can to please, and to\r\ncontribute to the happiness of _dear_ Uncle Mensdorff and my four\r\ncousins. They say that a smile was imprinted on her countenance when\r\nshe died, and that she looked more friendly after her death than she\r\nhad done some time previous to it....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 30th July._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. I gave Mamma a\r\nlittle pin and drawing done by me in recollection of today. I gave\r\nLehzen a ring, also in recollection of today. I forgot to say that\r\nMamma gave me 3 little books yesterday, two of which I have quite read\r\nthrough and the third in part. They are _A Method of Preparation for\r\nConfirmation_, by William Hale Hale; _An Address to the Candidates for\r\nConfirmation_, by Dr. John Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln; and _An Address to\r\nthe Students of Eton College who are about to present themselves for\r\nConfirmation in 1833_. They are all 3 very nice books. At a ¼ past 9\r\nwe breakfasted. I forgot to say that dear Lehzen gave me 4 very pretty\r\nprints of religious subjects. At ½ past 11 we went with Lady Flora,\r\nLehzen, the Dean &c. to St. James’s where I was to be confirmed. I\r\nfelt that my confirmation was one of the most solemn and important\r\nevents and acts in my life; and that I trusted that it might have a\r\nsalutary effect on my mind. I felt deeply repentant for all what I\r\nhad done which was wrong and trusted in God Almighty to strengthen my\r\nheart and mind; and to forsake all that is bad and follow all that is\r\nvirtuous and right. I went with the firm determination to become a\r\ntrue Christian, to try and comfort my dear Mamma in all her griefs,\r\ntrials and anxieties, and to become a dutiful and affectionate daughter\r\nto her. Also to be obedient to _dear_ Lehzen who has done so much for\r\nme. I was dressed in a white lace dress, with a white crape bonnet\r\nwith a wreath of white roses round it. I went in the chariot with my\r\ndear Mamma and the others followed in another carriage. We went into\r\nthe King’s Closet with Lady Flora and Lehzen, where we were received\r\nby the King and Queen. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Aunt Sophia,\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland, the Duchess of Weimar,[188] the Duchess of\r\nNorthumberland, the Marquis of Conyngham, Earl Denbigh, Mr. Ashley, the\r\nDuke of Northumberland &c., were also there. We then went with all into\r\nthe Royal Pew in the Chapel. The usual morning service was performed;\r\nafter which we all went down into the lower part of the Chapel. The\r\nKing went first leading me, the Queen followed leading Mamma, and all\r\nthe others followed after. I stood without the rail before the Altar,\r\nbetween the King and my dear Mamma. The Queen and all the rest went\r\ninto pews on each side of the Altar. The Archbishop of Canterbury and\r\nBishop of London[189] stood on either side of the Altar. I took off my\r\nbonnet. When the usual address had been read, I (as is usual for all to\r\ndo) replied “I do,” and then knelt down and received the benediction\r\nfrom the Archbishop. The whole was performed by the Archbishop who\r\nread also a very fine address to me, composed by him expressly for\r\nthe occasion. He did the whole very well, and I felt the whole _very\r\ndeeply_. My dear Mamma was very much affected by the whole. We went\r\naway from the Altar in the same way as we came and then went into the\r\nCloset again; where the King gave me a very handsome set of emeralds,\r\nand the Queen a head-piece of the same kind. We then drove home. We\r\ncame home at a ¼ to 2. I was very much affected indeed when we came\r\nhome. My dear Mamma gave me a very lovely bracelet with her hair in\r\nit, and a very pretty set of turquoises. She gave dear Lehzen a very\r\npretty bracelet. We received the joyful news this afternoon that my\r\ndearest sister Feodore had been safely confined on the 20th instant\r\nwith a daughter[190] which is to be called Adelaide, Victoria, Mary,\r\nLouisa, Amelia, Constance. I hope to God that both Mother and Child\r\nwill continue as well as they have hitherto been. At 6 we dined. At 7\r\nwe drove out with Lehzen till ½ past 8. The heat continues intense! I\r\nstayed up till ½ past 9....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 2nd August._—I awoke after 7 and got up at ½ past 8. At ½\r\npast 9 Lehzen and I breakfasted. At 11 we went to the Chapel with Lady\r\nFlora and Lehzen. The Dean performed the service; and the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury preached a very fine sermon. The text was taken from the 5th\r\nchapter of the 2nd epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, 10th verse:\r\n“For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ; that every\r\none may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath\r\ndone, whether it be good or bad.” After the sermon was over we took\r\nthe holy sacrament with Lady Flora, dear Lehzen, and Sir J. C. The\r\nArchbishop and the Dean administered it to us. It was the first time\r\nof taking it. It is a very solemn and impressive ceremony and when one\r\nrecollects and thinks that we take it in remembrance of the death of\r\nour blessed Saviour, one _ought_, nay _must_ feel deeply impressed with\r\nholy and pious feelings!...\r\n\r\nTUNBRIDGE WELLS, _Wednesday, 19th August_.—Today is my _poor dear_ Aunt\r\nSophie’s birthday.... I read to Lehzen out of Sully’s Memoirs. It is\r\nwonderful when one considers how many years ago they have been written.\r\nUpwards of 300 years, and how modern and pure the style is! His account\r\nof the horrible massacre of St. Bartholomew is highly interesting as\r\ncoming from the pen of an eye-witness! I then played on the piano with\r\nMamma and by myself. At ½ past 12 we lunched. At 1 we went to the races\r\nwith Lady Flora, Lehzen, and Sir G. Anson. It was very amusing. The day\r\nwas beautiful and we sat under a sort of covering of cloth decorated\r\nwith flowers, in our carriage. The Manor Stakes were won by a chesnut\r\nmare called Tirara belonging to a Mr. James Bacon. The Give-and-Take\r\nplate as it was entitled, was won by Mr. John Bacon’s chesnut mare\r\nMalibran, and the Kent and Sussex stakes was won by Mr. Pegg’s horse\r\nLittle-thought-of. Amongst the numbers of beggars, itinerary musicians,\r\nactors etc. of all sorts and kinds, was a boy of 14 years old who\r\ncalled himself the son of an actor Williamson, very poorly dressed, who\r\ndeclaimed by heart a part of Marmion and of Campbell’s poems with great\r\nfeeling and talent. We came home at 5. At a ¼ past 7 we dined. When we\r\ncame home I played on the piano and wrote my journal. Lady, the Misses,\r\nand M. S. Conroy, and Mr. Palmer dined here. After dinner came Mme.\r\nDulcken. I stayed up till a ¼ past 9....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 23rd August._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At a ¼ past 9\r\nwe breakfasted. After breakfast I wrote my journal and some extracts\r\nfrom the Peerage. At 11 we went with Lady Flora and Lehzen to church.\r\nMr. Pope officiated and preached a sermon. The text was from the 6th\r\nchapter of St. Matthew, 10th verse: “Thy kingdom come.” It was not one\r\nof his best sermons and it was not according to my liking. He can and\r\nhas preached some very fine sermons. At 1 we lunched. After luncheon\r\nI wrote extracts again. Lehzen then read to me out of the Sketch-book\r\nwhile I worked. At ½ past 4 we drove out with Lady Flora and Lehzen and\r\ncame home at 6. I then wrote my journal. At a ¼ past 7 we dined. Sir\r\nGeorge, Mr. and Miss Anson, Lady and the Misses and Mr. S. Conroy dined\r\nhere. After dinner I took up Mrs. Butler’s Journal[191] and read a\r\nlittle in it. It certainly is very pertly and oddly written. One would\r\nimagine by the style that the authoress must be very pert, and not well\r\nbred; for there are so many vulgar expressions in it. It is a great\r\npity that a person endowed with so much talent as Mrs. Butler really\r\nis, should turn it to so little account and publish a book which is so\r\nfull of trash and nonsense which can only do her harm. I stayed up\r\ntill 20 minutes past 9....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 25th August._— ... At ½ past 2 sat to M. Collen for my\r\npicture till ½ past 3, while Lehzen read to me in Mme. de Sévigné’s\r\nLetters. How truly elegant and natural her style is! It is so full of\r\nnaïveté, cleverness and grace. Then I played on the piano. At 4 we\r\nwalked out with Lady Flora and Lehzen and came home at 5 minutes to 5.\r\nIn our walk we met a man with beautiful parrots. Amongst them was one\r\ndear little paroquet of a green colour with a pale brown head and so\r\nvery tame that Mamma took it on her finger and it would hardly leave\r\nher. It talks also, the man says. It is not so remarkable for its fine\r\nplumage than for its great tameness. Mamma bought the dear little\r\nthing. It is now in Mamma’s room....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 28th August._—At ½ past 11 came the Dean till 1. I read\r\nfirst in the Old Testament, then in Clarendon, and finished with the\r\n_Spectator_. At 1 we lunched. I read after luncheon in the Bishop of\r\nChester’s _Exposition of the Gospel of St. Matthew._ It is a very\r\nfine book indeed. Just the sort of one I like; which is just plain\r\nand comprehensible and full of truth and good feeling. It is not one\r\nof those learned books in which you have to cavil at almost every\r\nparagraph. Lehzen gave it me on the Sunday that I took the Sacrament. I\r\nhave given up reading Smith’s _Theology_. It is more a book to refer to\r\nthan to read all through....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 1st September._—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At ½\r\npast 8 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 we left _dear_ Tunbridge Wells with\r\nLady Flora and Lehzen. I am _very_ sorry to leave the dear place. I am\r\nso very fond of it. I liked Boyne House better a good deal than old\r\nMount Pleasant.... We changed horses first at Tunbridge Town, then at\r\nSevenoaks, and lastly at Bromley. We reached Kensington Palace at 2. At\r\na ¼ past 2 we lunched. Lady Flora went home after luncheon to her own\r\nfamily. At 3 we went over to Aunt Sophia’s (all our carpets being taken\r\nup), to receive the Duc de Nemours. Aunt Sophia of course was _not_\r\npresent. The Duc de Nemours is nearly 21. That is to say His Royal\r\nHighness will complete his 21st year on the 25th of October. He is Aunt\r\nLouisa’s 2nd brother. He is tall, has a very fine slender figure, and\r\nis extremely fair. He is good-looking but not so much so as his brother\r\nthe Duke of Orleans. The Duc de Nemours is extremely pleasing but\r\nrather timid. He brought Mamma a letter from his Mother, the Queen of\r\nthe French, and a beautiful set of instruments made of French pebbles\r\nfor me, from her. I wrote my journal then. We then saw Lady Catherine\r\nJenkinson, and afterwards my Uncle Sussex. I then wrote my journal and\r\ndid various other things. At a ¼ past 7 we dined. Lord Liverpool and\r\nLady Catherine dined here. After dinner came Princess Sophia. I stayed\r\nup till ½ past 9....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 4th September._—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At ½\r\npast 8 we all breakfasted. At ½ past 9 we left Wansford. It is a very\r\nnice clean Inn. We passed through Stamford, a large and populous town,\r\nafter having changed horses at Witham Common. We changed horses 2ndly\r\nat Grantham, also a large town. These 3 are in Lincolnshire. 3rdly at\r\nNewark, also a large town, and lastly at Scarthing Moor. The country\r\nfrom Wansford to Scarthing Moor was like yesterday, extremely flat\r\nand ugly. From Scarthing Moor to Barnby Moor, where we arrived at\r\n5 o’clock, the country is rich and wooded, but very flat. This Inn\r\n(Barnby Moor) is extremely clean and pretty. Newark, Scarthing Moor\r\nand Barnby Moor are all in Nottinghamshire. I am struck by the number\r\nof small villages in the counties which we passed through today, each\r\nwith their church. And what is likewise peculiar is, that the churches\r\nhave all steeples of a spiral shape. I read in the _Alhambra_ again\r\nin the carriage. Finished the 1st vol. and began the 2nd. We all\r\nwalked in the little garden behind the house for a short time. When\r\nwe came in I wrote my journal. At a ¼ to 7 we all dined. After dinner\r\nLady Catherine played on the piano, for there was one in the Inn. She\r\nplayed a variation of Herz’s, one of Hünten’s, and the Polacca; and she\r\naccompanied us while we sang “Il rival.” I stayed up till 9.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 5th September._—I awoke at ½ past 6 and got up at 7. Read\r\nin the _Exposition of St. Matt.’s Gospel_ while my hair was doing, and\r\nalso in the Venetian History. Last night I also read in the Gospel and\r\nin Mme. de Sévigné. At a ¼ to 8 we all breakfasted. At a ¼ to 9 we\r\nleft Barnby Moor. It is a remarkably nice and clean Inn. We changed\r\nhorses 1st at Doncaster, a very pretty town, 2ndly at Ferry bridge\r\nwhere there is a fine bridge, and lastly at Tadcaster. All these towns\r\nare in Yorkshire. We reached Bishopthorpe (the Archbishop of York’s\r\nPalace) at 2. It is 2 miles and a half from York. It is a very large\r\nhouse and part of it is very old. Besides the Archbishop[192] and\r\nMiss Harcourt (his daughter), the Duchess of Northumberland, Lady\r\nNorreys,[193] Sir John and Lady Johnstone[194] (Lady Johnstone is the\r\nArchbishop’s daughter), Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Granville Harcourt,[195]\r\nColonel Francis Harcourt,[5] Mr. Vernon, are staying in the house.\r\nAfter half an hour we lunched in a large dining-room. We then went to\r\nour rooms which are very nice. I finished the _Alhambra_. It is a most\r\nentertaining book and has amused me very much. I wrote my journal when\r\nI came into my room. Wrote a letter to Feodore and read in the Venetian\r\nHistory. The country through which we travelled today is very flat and\r\nugly, but extremely rich. I find the air in Yorkshire cooler than in\r\nKent and the South of England. I read in Mrs. Butler’s journal which\r\namuses me. There are some very fine feelings in it. At a ¼ to 7 we\r\ndined. Besides the people whom I mentioned, Mr. Charles Harcourt,[196]\r\nMr. William Harcourt, the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress, Colonel York,\r\nColonel[197] and Mrs. Wildman, &c. After dinner Lady Norreys and her\r\ncousin Miss Vernon sang a duet from _La Gazza Ladra_ beautifully, and\r\nalso “Suoni la tromba.” They are both extremely pretty. They are\r\npupils of Tamburini. We sang something then. I like Miss Vernon’s voice\r\nthe best of the two. We then went to prayers. After that, I sang the\r\nBarcarola from _Faliero_, frightened to death. I stayed up till a ¼ to\r\n11....\r\n\r\nBISHOPTHORPE, _Wednesday, 9th September_.—... At a ¼ past 11 we went to\r\nthe York Minster with the same party as yesterday with the exception\r\nof Lord and Lady Norreys and Mrs. Vernon, who remained at home. The\r\nMinster was fuller than on the preceding day. It was Handel’s Oratorio\r\nof _The Messiah_. It is considered very fine, but I must say that, with\r\nthe exception of a few Choruses and one or two songs, it is very heavy\r\nand tiresome. It is in 3 parts. In the 1st part Grisi sang “Rejoice\r\ngreatly” _most beautifully_. She pronounces the English so _very well_,\r\nand sang the whole in such excellent style.... The Hallelujah Chorus\r\nat the end of the 2nd part and another at the end of the 3rd act are\r\nthe finest things besides “Rejoice greatly.” But I am not at all fond\r\nof Handel’s music, I like the present Italian school such as Rossini,\r\nBellini, Donizetti &c., _much better_....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 11th September._— ... Lablache and Rubini sang only once each.\r\nAlas! it will be a long time before I shall hear their two fine voices\r\nagain. But time passes away quickly and April and the dear Opera will\r\nsoon return. I am to learn to sing next year. Mamma promised I should;\r\nand I hope to learn of Lablache. What a delightful master he would be\r\nto learn of! Grisi sang “Laudate Dominum,” by Mozart, accompanied by\r\nDr. Camidge[198] on the organ. She executed the delicate passages in\r\nit _beautifully_. Between the two parts we lunched at the Deanery with\r\nour party and many others. Grisi came in with her uncle while we were\r\nat luncheon. She is extremely handsome, near-by, by day-light. Her\r\nfeatures are not small, but extremely fine, and her eyes are beautiful\r\nas are also her teeth. She has such a sweet amiable expression when she\r\nsmiles, and has pleasing quiet manners. She had an ugly dingy foulard\r\ndress on, with a large coloured handkerchief under a large muslin\r\ncollar. And she had a frightful little pink bonnet on, but in spite of\r\nall her ugly attire she looked very handsome. She is a most fascinating\r\nlittle creature.... Grisi sang the last air “Sing ye to the Lord.”\r\nNever did I hear anything so beautiful. It was a complete triumph! and\r\nwas quite electrifying! Though a very little bit and with very little\r\naccompaniment, the manner, the power with which she sang it, and the\r\nemphasis which she put into it, was truly splendid. I shall just write\r\ndown the lines:\r\n\r\n    Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously:\r\n    The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.\r\n\r\nShe pronounced it beautifully. When she had sung “The horse and his\r\nrider hath He thrown” she paused a moment, and then came out most\r\nemphatically with “_into the sea_!”...\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 12th September._— ... At 11 we left Bishopthorpe, but not\r\nwithout regret. They are a very amiable family. Miss Harcourt is a very\r\nnice person. She ought by rights to be called Miss Georgiana Harcourt,\r\nthe Archbishop’s eldest daughter being unmarried, but as she never\r\ngoes out and does not make the _honneurs_ in the house, Miss Georgiana\r\nis always called Miss Harcourt.[199] The Archbishop has _10_ sons, 5\r\nof whom were at Bishopthorpe; 3 staying in the house, Mr. Granville\r\nHarcourt, Colonel Harcourt,[200] and Mr. Egerton Harcourt, and two out\r\nof the house, Mr. William Harcourt[201] and Mr. Charles Harcourt,[202]\r\nstaying at the residence. Mrs. William Harcourt is a very nice person.\r\nWe passed a pleasant time at Bishopthorpe in spite of fatigues which\r\nwere _not slight_ and which I begin to _feel_....\r\n\r\nCANTERBURY, _Thursday, 29th September_.—I awoke at 6 and got up at ½\r\npast 7. At ½ past 8 we all breakfasted. At ½ past 9 Mamma received an\r\naddress from the Mayor and Corporation here. We then saw some officers.\r\nAfter this we left Canterbury. It is a very clean nice Inn. It was a\r\nfine day. We reached Ramsgate at ½ past 12. The people received us in a\r\nmost friendly and kind way. The whole was very well conducted, and the\r\npeople were very orderly. The streets were ornamented with arches of\r\nflowers and flags. The open, free, boundless (to the eye) ocean looked\r\nvery refreshing. There is nothing between us and France but the sea,\r\nhere. We have got a small but very nice house, overlooking the sea. At\r\na ¼ past 2 we walked down to the Albion Hotel to see the preparations\r\nmade for dear Uncle Leopold and dear Aunt Louisa. At a little past 4\r\nwe went down to the Hotel with Lady Flora, Lehzen and Lady Conroy, as\r\nthe steamer was in sight. With beating hearts and longing eyes we\r\nsat at the window, anxiously watching the steamer’s progress. There\r\nwas an immense concourse of people on the pier to see them arrive.\r\nAfter about half an hour’s time, the steamer entered the Harbour,\r\namidst loud cheering and the salute of guns from the pier, with the\r\nBelgian flag on its mast. My _dearest_ Uncle Leopold, King of the\r\nBelgians, and _dearest_ Aunt Louisa were very warmly received. It was\r\nbut the people’s duty to do so, as dear Uncle has lived for so long in\r\nEngland and was so much beloved. After another ¼ of an hour of anxious\r\nsuspense, the waiter told us that “Their Majesties were coming.” We\r\nhastened downstairs to receive them. There was an immense crowd before\r\nthe door. At length Uncle appeared, having Aunt Louisa at his arm. What\r\na happiness was it for me to throw myself in the arms of that _dearest_\r\nof Uncles, who has always been to me like a father, and whom I love\r\nso _very dearly_! I had not seen him for 4 years and 2 months. I was\r\nalso delighted to make the acquaintance of that dear Aunt who is such\r\na perfection and who has been always so kind to me, without knowing\r\nme. We hastened upstairs, where Uncle Leopold and Aunt Louisa showed\r\nthemselves at the window and were loudly cheered; as they ought to be.\r\nI do not find dear Uncle at all changed. On the contrary I think he\r\nlooks better than he did when I last saw him. Aunt Louisa is not quite\r\nso tall as Mamma, and has a very pretty slight figure. Her hair is of\r\na lovely fair colour; her nose is aquiline, her eyes are quite lovely;\r\nthey are light blue and have such a charming expression. She has such a\r\nsweet mouth and smile too. She is delightful, and was so affectionate\r\nto me directly. She pronounces English extremely well and speaks it\r\nvery fluently. She almost always speaks it with Uncle. She was very\r\nsimply dressed in a light brown silk dress, with a sky-blue silk bonnet\r\nand white veil. Uncle and Aunt are accompanied by Comtesse Henri de\r\nMérode (Dame d’Honneur to Aunt Louisa), and General Goblet.[203] M.\r\nVan de Weyer is also here. We then left them and Lehzen and I drove\r\nhome and Mamma and the rest walked home. At a little after 7 we dined.\r\nDear Uncle Leopold, dear Aunt Louisa, the Duc de Nemours (who had only\r\narrived half an hour ago), Comtesse H. de Mérode, General Goblet,\r\nGeneral Baudrand,[204] M. Van de Weyer, Dr. Clark,[205] Mr. and Miss V.\r\nConroy, dined here. I sat between Uncle Leopold and the Duc de Nemours;\r\ntwo _delightful_ neighbours. When I say _next_ to a person, as for\r\ninstance I said the other day, and many days, “I sat next to the Duc de\r\nNemours,” “I sat next to the Duke of Norfolk,” &c., &c., I mean, as I\r\ndid today, that I sat _between_ or _next_ to them at _dinner_. The Duc\r\nde Nemours, now that I see him and Aunt Louisa together, is not like\r\nher. He has such a _good_ kind expression in his face; and Aunt Louisa\r\nhas the most _delightful sweet_ expression I ever saw. She is quite\r\ndelightful and charming. She is so gay and merry too. She had a white\r\nmoiré dress on, and her fine hair was so well done, in a plait behind\r\nand curls in front with a row of pearls and three black velvet bows\r\nin it. After dinner came two other gentlemen of the Duc de Nemours,\r\nColonel Boyer and Monsieur Larnac. We passed a _most delightful_\r\nevening....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 5th November._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. Dressed, walked\r\nover to my room and breakfasted at 9. Read in the Exposition of St.\r\nMatt.’s Gospel, and in the Venetian History while my hair was doing.\r\n_Dear good_ Lehzen takes such care of me, and is so unceasing in her\r\nattentions to me, that I shall never be able to repay her sufficiently\r\nfor it but by my love and gratitude. I never can sufficiently repay her\r\nfor all she has _borne_ and done for me. She is the _most affectionate,\r\ndevoted, attached_, and _disinterested_ friend I have, and I love her\r\nmost _dearly_....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 2nd December._— ... We walked on the Pier which was\r\nvery amusing. There are a number of foreign ships in the harbour;\r\nPortuguese, Finland, and a number of French fishing-boats. The dress\r\nof the French fishermen is very picturesque. There were some Spanish\r\nsailors playing on the pier, who looked very singular. Amongst others\r\nthere was a little French fisher-boy playing with another boy with a\r\npulley. He had a funny round rosy face, and was dressed in a loose blue\r\nwoven woolen jacket, with huge boots which reached to his knees, and\r\na red cap. Mamma asked him what he was doing, upon which he answered\r\nwith naïveté, “Nous sommes à jouer un peu.” She asked him where he came\r\nfrom; “De Dunkirk,” was his reply. He said this all, and some other\r\nthings, in such a funny naif way, and with such a sly arch smile, that\r\nit was quite amusing. He asked for a “sou,” and we gave him 6 pence,\r\nwhich pleased him very much....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  When the Princess was seventeen the shadow of coming events was\r\n  cast over her placid life. Her Journals contain evidence of\r\n  this. She became aware that her Uncle, King Leopold, had begun\r\n  to think with grave anticipation of the high position she might\r\n  before long have to occupy, and of the project of uniting her in\r\n  marriage to some Prince worthy to share with her the anxieties and\r\n  responsibilities of a Throne. She knew that he had fixed upon her\r\n  cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg.\r\n\r\n  In May of this year she saw the Prince for the first time. William\r\n  IV. did not favour the views of King Leopold. His candidate was a\r\n  younger son of the Prince of Orange. Both Princes were invited to\r\n  London, and both were present at a ball given by the Duchess of\r\n  Kent in honour of her daughter attaining the age of seventeen.\r\n\r\n  The young Princess was not attracted by the Prince of Orange. It\r\n  would be an exaggeration to say that she felt more than a sisterly\r\n  affection for Prince Albert. She thought him good-looking and\r\n  charming, and they sketched and sang together. He found her very\r\n  amiable and astonishingly self-possessed. There is not a trace on\r\n  either side of deeper sentiment. When the Prince left England, she\r\n  wrote to her Uncle Leopold expressing anxiety to fall in with his\r\n  wishes in respect of her future marriage as in everything else,\r\n  but there is no indication that her heart was touched. The seed,\r\n  however, was sown which was to ripen later, and ultimately to bear\r\n  fruit, the sweetest she was destined to taste in her long life.\r\n\r\n  The plans of King Leopold were an open secret, and roused\r\n  considerable interest in all classes. On his return home Prince\r\n  Albert was entertained in Paris at an official dinner given by Lord\r\n  Granville, which was taken to mean that good progress had been made\r\n  with the scheme of the projected marriage.\r\n\r\n  In the course of this year the Princess resided at Claremont, then\r\n  the property of King Leopold. Her life there was one of great\r\n  simplicity. There were lately living a few old people in the\r\n  village of Esher who remembered the little Princess attending the\r\n  ancient church, now disused, dressed in spotted muslin with a large\r\n  poke bonnet.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps owing to the consciousness that his candidate had failed\r\n  to create a favourable impression, King William during this year\r\n  displayed more than usual hostility to his sister-in-law, the\r\n  Duchess of Kent. The King’s behaviour to her mother undoubtedly\r\n  saddened the life of the little Princess, more especially as it was\r\n  in somewhat strong contrast to the kindness with which she herself\r\n  was treated by King William and Queen Adelaide.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile, the stream of public events rolled smoothly along.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                                 1836\r\n\r\n_Monday, 11th January._— ... We went out walking at a ¼ to 2 with\r\nLady Flora and Lehzen; it had cleared up and was quite mild and\r\nbright. We walked on the pier and got into a boat. There was a good\r\ndeal of swell in the Harbour, and at the mouth of it our boat pitched\r\nand rolled a good deal; Mamma began to look queerish, but I thought\r\nit very pleasant. There were numbers of people on the pier. The 3\r\nPortuguese vessels hoisted their Portuguese standards, as did also the\r\ntwo Spaniards. We landed at the same stairs where we embarked. The\r\nwhole of Ramsgate seemed to be out on the pier. We walked to the head\r\nof the pier and back again and got into the carriage. We drove to the\r\ncliff where the stairs called “Jacob’s ladder” are. We got out there\r\nand went down the stairs, and walked on the other side of the pier. We\r\ntook a parting look at the end of the pier, of all the ships, the pier\r\n&c., for we go tomorrow. There were, I think, 7 French boats in the\r\nHarbour; and there were numbers of little French boys on the pier; we\r\ngave them something, but they (for the first time) proved dissatisfied\r\nand rebellious. They quite attacked Lehzen, who always gives the money,\r\ncoming round her on all sides, stretching out their hands, saying\r\n“Donnez-moi un sou,” “Je n’ai pas un,” “Madame, Madame, donnez-moi\r\nun sou,” &c. Some little urchins were _rusés_ enough to say “C’est\r\npour nos matelots, nous allons à bord dans l’instant.” Lehzen threw\r\nthem a shilling, whereupon they all fell on the ground in one heap,\r\nscrambling after it. They were quiet for a little while, but a few\r\nlittle determined fellows came again and followed us for sometime. They\r\nat length got something, and went away. Cela était fort amusant et très\r\nridicule à voir....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 13th January._—I awoke at a little past 6 and got up\r\nat 7. Dressed and had my hair done. We breakfasted at 8. We left\r\nSittingbourne at 9. It was a bitterly cold day, though bright and\r\nclear. We changed horses at Rochester, 2ndly at Gravesend, and 3rdly\r\nat Blackheath. We reached Kensington Palace at a little before 2. We\r\ninstantly went upstairs, that is to say, up _two_ staircases, to our\r\nnew sleeping and sitting apartments which are very lofty and handsome.\r\nTo describe them minutely and accurately would be impossible. Our\r\nbedroom[206] is very large and lofty, and is very nicely furnished,\r\nthen comes a little room for the maid, and a dressing-room for Mamma;\r\nthen comes the old gallery which is partitioned into 3 large, lofty,\r\nfine and cheerful rooms.[207] One only of these (the one near Mamma’s\r\ndressing-room) is ready furnished; it is my sitting-room and is _very_\r\nprettily furnished indeed. My pictures are not yet in it. The next is\r\nmy study, and the last is an anteroom; this last has no fireplace, but\r\nthe two others have, and my sitting-room is very warm and comfortable.\r\nThere is another room, belonging to me, on another side of the bed-room\r\n(Lehzen’s former bed-room) which is not freshly furnished, but is a\r\npassage &c. Lehzen is now in our former bed-room. When I went down into\r\nmy poor former sitting-room,[208] I could not help looking at it with\r\naffection, and pleasant recollections, having passed so many days of my\r\nlife and many very pleasant ones there; but our new rooms are much more\r\nairy and roomy....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 14th January._— ... Read out of Mme. de Sévigné while my\r\nhair was doing to Lehzen. We all breakfasted at a ¼ past 9. Carried\r\nthings from my old room, upstairs to my new room, and put them into\r\nthe new presses. Wrote my journal. My pictures are being hung up and\r\nmy room is in a great confusion; the workmen in my study are making a\r\ngreat noise, so that I am _un peu confuse_. Walked about. We lunched\r\nat 1. Arranged things. Saw Dr. Clark at 2. Received a most kind and\r\nlong letter from dearest Aunt Louise in which she tells me that Uncle\r\nLeopold and my little cousin are well, as also Uncle Ferdinand, who\r\nis with them; and that the Duke of Orleans[209] (whom she calls\r\n_Chartres_, as the whole family generally do) is better but not quite\r\nwell yet. She further adds, that the dear Queen of the French who had a\r\nvery bad cold, is better....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 3rd February._—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to 8. Read\r\nin the Irish History while my hair was doing. At 9 we breakfasted.\r\nPasted my name in some of my books. At 10 came the Dean till 11. Read\r\nwith him first in the Old Testament and then in Hume. Pasted my name in\r\nsome of my books. I have got all the same pictures I had in my former\r\nroom, hung up in my present room, with the exception of some old prints\r\nand of the two ugly oil pictures of my Father and Mother, and with\r\nthe addition of Hayter’s drawing of Mamma and I. My fine casts of the\r\n_dear_ French family are also hung up in my sitting-room; they only\r\ncame home today as the frame had to be mended. I am so fond of them.\r\nVarious prints are also being hung up in my study. Wrote my journal.\r\nDrew....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 6th February._— ... I have quite forgotten to mention\r\nthat the young Queen of Portugal was married by proxy on the 1st of\r\nJanuary to—_my Cousin Ferdinand_, Uncle Ferdinand’s eldest son, and\r\nwho completed his 19th year on the 29th of last October.[210] The\r\nnegotiations to this purpose have been going on since last September,\r\nand have only just now come to an end. Count Lavradio, whom we saw just\r\nbefore we went to Ramsgate, went to Cobourg to meet Uncle Ferdinand and\r\nmy dear Cousins Ferdinand and Augustus, there. Dear Uncle Leopold has\r\nmanaged a _great_ deal of the business; he is ever ready and ever _most\r\nable_ to assist his family. Uncle Ferdinand has not long left Brussels,\r\nwhere he came to settle and arrange about the marriage. Dear Uncle\r\nFerdinand is, of course, full of anxiety for the welfare and happiness\r\nof his son. Ferdinand will soon come to Brussels with Augustus on his\r\nway to Lisbon and they will also come here. I cannot say how happy I\r\nam to become thus related to the Queen of Portugal, who has always\r\nbeen so kind to me and for whom I have always had a great affection.\r\nShe is warm-hearted, honest and affectionate, and when she talks, is\r\nvery pleasing. We have known each other since our 8th year (for there\r\nis only a month’s difference of age between us). She is far from plain\r\ntoo; she has an exquisite complexion, a good nose and fine hair. I hear\r\nthat Ferdinand is full of good and excellent qualities, has a pure and\r\nunsophisticated mind, and is very good-looking....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 20th February._— ... At ½ past 3 came the Dean till 4. Read\r\nwith him in Milton’s _Paradise Lost_. Practised on the piano for Mrs.\r\nAnderson.[211] Drew while Lehzen read to me out of that Rapport about\r\nFieschi.[212] Practised again on the piano. At ½ past 7 we dined.\r\nAunt Gloucester, the Prince of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeldt,[213]\r\nthe Archbishop of York and Miss Harcourt, the Duke of Wellington,\r\nCount[214] and Countess Charles Pozzo di Borgo, the Earl and Countess\r\nof Lincoln,[215] Viscount and Viscountess Beresford,[216] Lord Hill,\r\nLady Caroline Legge,[217] Lady Theresa Strangways, Sir Robert and Lady\r\nPeel, General Upton and Sir Samuel Higgins dined here. I sat between\r\nthe Duke of Wellington and Count C. Pozzo di Borgo. The Count is a\r\nvery agreeable man. His wife, the dear little Countess, looked lovely;\r\nshe is such a charming person; she is the 3rd daughter of the Duc de\r\nCrillon and is called Valentina. Lady Lincoln is also a very charming\r\nyoung person; she was so pretty but she is very much changed as she\r\nwas very ill all last summer and is still very far from well. I sat a\r\ngood deal with her and the little Countess Pozzo, and found them very\r\namiable and cheerful....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 27th February._— ... It was Miss Joanna Baillie’s[218]\r\nTragedy of _The Separation_ in 5 acts, performed for the 2nd time.\r\nThe principal characters are: Garcio (an Italian Count), Mr. Charles\r\nKemble,[219] who acted finely in parts but is dreadfully changed;\r\nRovani (his friend), G. Bennett who acted disagreeably and affectedly;\r\nthe Marquis of Tortona, Mr. Pritchard, a poor odd-looking creature;\r\nMargaret (wife to Garcio), Miss Helen Faucit,[220] who acted well in\r\nthe pathetic quiet parts. I had not seen Charles Kemble since 5 years,\r\nand I did not quite recollect his countenance; those however who had\r\nseen him in his good days, when he was an excellent actor and a very\r\nhandsome man, found the change _very great_. _I_, for _my_ part, like\r\nMacready by far better. Kemble whines so much and drawls the words in\r\nsuch a slow peculiar manner; his actions too (to me) are overdone and\r\naffected, and his voice is not pleasant to me; he makes terrible faces\r\nalso which spoils his countenance and he looks old and does not carry\r\nhimself well. He was very fine, however, at the end of the 3rd act when\r\nhe snatches the picture out of his wife’s hand, and when he discovers\r\nit to be that of her brother Ulrico whom he murdered,—the way in which\r\nhe throws the picture on the ground and sinks trembling and gasping\r\nagainst the bed, while his countenance pourtrays the violent feelings\r\nof remorse, horror and conscience this Kemble did _very finely_, and\r\nalso when he takes leave of Margaret. He _was_ undoubtedly a very fine\r\nactor, nay, still _is_, but he is not natural enough for my taste. I\r\n_do_ think Macready is so feeling and natural, particularly now; he\r\nwas perhaps formerly rather affected and violent at times. His voice\r\ntoo I like so much and he does not drawl the words; I like him best\r\nafter Young, who was the _most beautiful_ actor I ever saw, or who\r\nperhaps ever existed in this country, except Garrick and John Kemble\r\n(Charles K.’s elder brother). I only saw Young twice but I shall never\r\nforget it. I saw him 1st in _Macbeth_ and then I saw him take his\r\nfinal leave of the stage in _Hamlet_. I must say a few words about\r\nG. Bennett[221] and Miss Helen Faucit. Bennett, whom I have seen act\r\nreally extremely well in _The Miller and His Men_, in _Pizarro_, in\r\n_King John_ as Hubert, &c., &c., was extremely disagreeable yesterday\r\nas Rovani; he twisted his arms, hands, legs, back and even eyes in all\r\ndirections, and drawled his words in speaking most disagreeably. Miss\r\nFaucit is plain and thin, and her voice is much against her, but when\r\nshe is gentle and pathetic she is far from disagreeable; she rants and\r\nscreams[222] too much also, but as she is very young, they say she may\r\n_become_ a good actress. The Tragedy though well written is rather\r\nunnatural and very heavy in parts; I must say _I_ greatly prefer _The\r\nProvost of Bruges_ and think it by far more natural. Kemble and Miss\r\nFaucit were called out and were much applauded....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _P.V. del. R.P. April 1837._\r\n\r\n  _M^r. Charles Mathews as Dapperwit in The Rape of the Lock_\r\n\r\n  CHARLES MATHEWS.\r\n\r\n  From a sketch by Princess Victoria.]\r\n\r\n_Monday, 29th February._— ... At ½ past 7 we went to the play to Mme.\r\nVestris’s[223] Olympic, with Lehzen and Sir J. C. I had never been\r\nthere before; it is a very small but pretty, clean little theatre.\r\nIt was the burletta of _One Hour_ or _The Carnival Ball_ in one\r\nact. The principal characters are: Mr. Charles Swiftly, Mr. Charles\r\nMathews,[224] a most _delightful_ and _charming_ actor; he is son to\r\nthe celebrated old Mathews who died last year. He is quite a young man,\r\nI should say not more than five or six and twenty.[225] His face is\r\nnot good-looking, but very clever and pleasing; he has a very slight,\r\npretty figure, with very small feet and is very graceful and immensely\r\nactive; he skips and runs about the stage in a most agile manner.\r\nHe is _so_ natural and amusing, and never vulgar but always very\r\ngentlemanlike. He is a most charming actor....\r\n\r\nCharles Mathews is the most delightful and amusing actor possible. He\r\nis the only child of his parents and was intended for an architect and\r\nstudied in Greece and Italy for that purpose; but having a penchant for\r\nthe stage, he abandoned his profession and had become an actor; we see\r\nhow it has succeeded—_most perfectly_!...\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 2nd March._— ... Lady Burghersh[226] told me that she knew\r\nCharles Mathews very well when she was in Florence, where he was come\r\nfor the purpose of studying architecture; she said she had often acted\r\nwith him in their private theatricals and that he always showed a\r\ngreat talent for acting, and that he then performed as a gentleman; he\r\n_now_ acts quite like a gentleman, and looks so too; he is a charming\r\nperformer I think. Lady Burghersh also said that he looks younger than\r\nhe is, for that he must be 3 or 4 and thirty. He told her when at\r\nFlorence that he had a great passion for the stage, but, as his father\r\nwas greatly averse to his son becoming an actor, he refrained from\r\ndoing it during his father’s lifetime....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 17th March._— ... We reached Windsor Castle at 6. We went\r\nto the Queen’s room where Ferdinand and Augustus were presented to the\r\nKing. We then went to our rooms. At ½ past 7 we dined in St. George’s\r\nHall with an immense number of people. Ferdinand looked very well. He\r\nwore the 3 Portuguese Orders in one ribbon, which he has the right of\r\ndoing as husband to the Queen of Portugal. Ferdinand led the Queen in\r\nto dinner and the King led Mamma and I. I sat between the King and\r\nGeorge Cambridge and opposite dear Ferdinand. After dinner we went into\r\na beautiful new drawing-room[227] where we remained till the gentlemen\r\ncame from dinner. We then all went into the Waterloo Gallery where the\r\nball was. The King went in first, then the Queen and Mamma, and then\r\ndear Ferdinand with me at his arm. I danced 3 quadrilles; 1st with dear\r\nFerdinand, then with George Cambridge, and lastly with dear Augustus.\r\nDuring the evening dear Ferdinand came and sat near me and talked so\r\ndearly and so sensibly. I do _so_ love him. Dear Augustus also sat near\r\nme and talked with me and he is also a dear good young man, and is\r\nvery handsome. He is extremely quiet and silent, but there is a great\r\ndeal in him. I am so fond too of my Uncle Ferdinand. I stayed up till\r\n1. I was much amused and pleased. Uncle Ferdinand brought me two kind\r\nnotes from Uncle Leopold and Aunt Louise. Ferdinand is so fond of Aunt\r\nLouise. He told me: “Oh, je l’aime tant!” Both he and Augustus speak\r\nFrench extremely well. This dinner and ball were in honour of dear\r\nFerdinand.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 18th March._— ... At ½ past 9 we breakfasted with the King,\r\nthe Queen, dear Ferdinand (who came nearly at the end of the breakfast,\r\nhaving slept a long while), dear Uncle Ferdinand, Augustus, Charles,\r\nPrince Ernst of Hesse P.B.,[228] the Duchess of Northumberland, George\r\nCambridge, Lady Ely,[229] Lady Flora, and Lehzen. After breakfast Mamma\r\nand I went into the Queen’s room and looked at some of her many pretty\r\nthings. Wrote my journal. At ½ past 11 we drove out with the Queen\r\nand dear Ferdinand in our carriage, Ferdinand and I sitting on the\r\nback seat and the Queen and Mamma on the front seat. Uncle Ferdinand,\r\nAugustus, Charles and Prince Ernest of Hesse P.B. followed in another,\r\nand all the rest in other carriages. We went to see a hunt and saw a\r\nstag let out of a cart and all the horsemen followed in great numbers.\r\nIt was a very pretty sight, and a beautiful warm day. We were all in\r\nopen carriages. I talked a good deal with Ferdinand, and like him\r\n_more_ and _more_; he is so sensible, so natural, so unaffected, and\r\nunsophisticated and so _truly_ good. His tutor, who has been with\r\nhim 13 years, M. Dietz, and whom he told me he is very fond of, will\r\ngo with him to Lisbon as his “secrétaire intime,” he told me. He (M.\r\nDietz)[230] came with several other gentlemen to Kensington yesterday.\r\nFerdinand is so fond of Augustus; the separation will be dreadful for\r\nthe two brothers; and he is very fond of his sister Victoire. We came\r\nhome at ½ past 1. Wrote the _brouillon_ of a French letter to Aunt\r\nLouise. At 2 we lunched with the whole party. I sat between the King\r\nand Uncle Ferdinand. Wrote my letter to Aunt Louise. Wrote my journal.\r\nWalked about. At about ½ past 5 dear Ferdinand, Uncle Ferdinand, and\r\ndear Augustus came into our room for a little while. At ½ past 7 we\r\ndined; again in St. George’s Hall and with the same large company as\r\nthe day before. Ferdinand went first (as he did also yesterday) with\r\nthe Queen; then came the King with us two. I sat between the King\r\nand George Cambridge, and opposite dear Fernando. After dinner Uncle\r\nFerdinand and my Cousins came and sat near us every now and then. Dear\r\nFerdinand has elicited universal admiration from all parties; the King\r\nis very much pleased with him, and the Queen is quite taken with him.\r\nHe is so very unaffected, and has such a distinguished appearance and\r\ncarriage. They are both very dear and charming young men; Augustus is\r\nvery amiable too, and when known, shows much good sense; he is very\r\nquiet and gentle. There is such an innocence and simplicity in them,\r\nand such a childish gaiety, and again they are very grown-up and nice\r\nin their manners, which are very unaffected and pleasing. Stayed up\r\ntill ½ past 11....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 1st April._—Today is Good Friday. At ½ past 9 we breakfasted\r\nwith dear Uncle Ferdinand, dear Augustus, Charles, Lady Flora and\r\nLehzen. I sat between dear Augustus and Charles. I stayed downstairs\r\ntill a ¼ past 10. Received the Order of Ste. Isabelle from my Cousin\r\nDonna Maria. The ribbon is very pale pink and white. Went up stairs,\r\nand wrote part of the _brouillon_ of a French letter to Aunt Louise.\r\nDear good Augustus came up at ½ past 10 and stayed till 11. These\r\nvisits please me very much; he is _so_ quiet, and goes about looking\r\nat the things in the room, sits down and reads the newspapers, and\r\nnever is in the way. He is a dear boy, and is so extremely good, kind\r\nand gentle; he has such a sweet expression and kind smile. I think\r\nFerdinand handsomer than Augustus, his eyes are so beautiful, and\r\nhe has such a lively, clever expression; _both_ have such a sweet\r\nexpression; Ferdinand has something _quite beautiful_ in his expression\r\nwhen he speaks and smiles and he is _so_ good. They are both very\r\nhandsome and _very dear_! Ferdinand is superior to Augustus in various\r\nways, and is by far more forward for his age in his mind than the\r\nlatter. They have both learnt, and know, a great deal, and are both\r\nvery orderly and tidy. At 11 we went down to prayers with Charles,\r\nLehzen, Lady Flora &c. &c. The service was performed by the poor Dean\r\nwho gave us likewise a sermon. We saw him for an instant after the\r\nservice was over. He is very calm and resigned. We remained with Uncle\r\na little while downstairs. Finished my _brouillon_ of my French letter.\r\nBegan to copy it. Went downstairs to see some paintings done by a Mr.\r\nCowen.[231] They are very well done indeed. Augustus came in also and\r\nlooked at them for a moment. Came up to my room and went on writing my\r\nletter to dear Aunt Louise. Dearest Uncle Ferdinand came up to me for\r\na few minutes and then went down again. Augustus came up and stayed a\r\nlittle while, while I was writing my letter and then went down. I gave\r\nhim this morning a seal and some prints which pleased him very much.\r\nFinished my letter to Aunt Louise and wrote my journal. At 25 minutes\r\nto 4 _dear_ good Augustus came up and sat in my room looking at annuals\r\ntill 4. He assisted me in sealing my letters, and we both made a mess,\r\nand he burnt a cover in sealing it, dear boy, for me, which made us\r\nboth laugh. He went down for 5 minutes, came up again, and Uncle, after\r\nstaying a few minutes, fetched him away to pay visits to the Duke of\r\nSussex and Princess Sophia. Played and sung. At 10 minutes to 6 came\r\nMrs. Wellesley[232] who is going tomorrow and will reach Stuttgardt on\r\nFriday. Augustus came in and we stayed with Uncle and him a few minutes\r\ndownstairs. Oh! could I but have some more such days, with that dear\r\nUncle and dear Augustus, whom I love so much! I shall feel very lonely\r\nand unhappy when they leave us....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 10th April._— ... Read to Lehzen part of _The Directions and\r\nAdvices_ which dearest Uncle Leopold has written down for Ferdinand,\r\nmost cleverly and beautifully done. They are written in French and are\r\ndivided into 3 parts. The part I have read is _Affaires Politiques_,\r\nwhich is divided into headings of all the departments of the\r\nGovernment. Dear Uncle has studied[233] the Portuguese Constitution,\r\nGovernment, People, Country, &c., &c., so completely since the intended\r\nmarriage of Ferdinand with the Queen of Portugal, that he is as\r\nfamiliar with the whole as though he were in the country. Dear Uncle\r\nLeopold is so clever and so prudent and so kind; he has taken so much\r\npains and trouble about Ferdinand and I must say he is repaid for his\r\ntrouble by the affection and gratitude Ferdinand has for him; and\r\ncertainly he has _not_ thrown away his time in so doing, for Ferdinand\r\nis not only _very good_, but _clever_, and therefore with Uncle’s\r\nadvice he will succeed, I am sure. Van de Weyer is a most trusty,\r\nclever person, and as he has also copies of these papers, will be of\r\nthe greatest use to Ferdinand. I see by the part I have read, which\r\ncontains most valuable, important and sage advice, one thing which I\r\nam very glad of, which is, that the Queen will associate Ferdinand\r\nwith her in the Council, &c., that he is always to be present at all\r\nher Councils. Uncle advises him to listen and not to give his opinion\r\nuntil he has become acquainted with the characters of the persons in\r\nthe Council, and then, after having well weighed what he means to say,\r\nto give his opinion. There is so much of all the advice which I wish I\r\ncould insert here, but which I have no time to do.[234]\r\n\r\n_Monday, 11th April._—Lehzen read to me while I was dressing and I read\r\nto her while my hair was doing, one of the parts of the Directions\r\nfor Ferdinand, called _Observations Générales_, and began the last\r\none called _Note communiquée au Comte de Lavradio_. Dear Uncle\r\nLeopold is so clever and governs Belgium so beautifully, that he is a\r\nmodel for every Sovereign and will contribute to the happiness and\r\nre-organisation of Portugal, as he has done to Belgium; for _that_\r\ncountry owes _all_ its prosperity, happiness, everything, to dearest\r\nUncle Leopold; it was in a sad state when Uncle arrived, and by his\r\ngreat prudence, sagacity, and extreme cleverness, Belgium is now one of\r\nthe most flourishing Kingdoms in Europe....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 3rd May._— ... At 10 minutes past 11 came _Lablache_ till\r\n10 minutes past 12. He complained much of the cold weather, and said\r\n“qu’ils étaient tous enrhumés” and that they had all been very hoarse\r\nlast night at a concert, except Rubini. I like Lablache very much, he\r\nis such a nice, good-natured, good-humoured man, and a very patient and\r\nexcellent master; he is so merry too.[235] _En profile_ he has a very\r\nfine countenance, I think, an aquiline nose, dark arched eye-brows, and\r\nfine long eyelashes, and a very clever expression. He has a profusion\r\nof hair, which is very grey, and strangely mixed with some few black\r\nlocks here and there. I sung first the recitative of “Notte d’orrore,”\r\nfrom _Marino Faliero_, several times over. Then Mamma and I sung\r\n“Mira oh! Norma” and “Si fine al ore,” both twice over and “Qual cor\r\ntradesti” twice over. Then I sang twice with Lablache “Io son ricco e\r\ntu sei bella,” a very pretty little duo from _L’Elisire d’Amore_ by\r\nDonizetti. He sang this delightfully, he has such a fine voice and\r\npronounces so distinctly and so well. _En conclusion_ I sang “Vivi tu.”\r\nI liked my lesson extremely; I only wish I had one every _day_ instead\r\nof one every _week_....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 13th May._— ... Mme. Malibran de Bériot[236] (as she now\r\ncalls herself since her marriage with the eminent violinist de Bériot)\r\nwas in very fine voice and sang extremely well indeed, twice. She\r\nsang first the prayer which Anna sings in her sleep in the 2nd act of\r\n_La Sonnambula_, and “Ah! non giunge unam pensiero!” I prefer Grisi’s\r\nsinging of these very much to Malibran’s; there is a sweetness,\r\nmildness and softness, accompanied with such beautifully clear\r\nexecution, in the _former_, which the _latter_ does _not_ possess in\r\nthe high notes. Malibran’s deep tones are beautiful, touching and\r\nfeeling, but her high notes are harsh, sharp and _voilée_. The 2nd\r\nthing she sang was pretty and well adapted to her voice....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 18th May._— ... At a ¼ to 2 we went down into the Hall, to\r\nreceive my Uncle Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and my Cousins,\r\nErnest and Albert, his sons. My Uncle was here, now 5 years ago, and is\r\nlooking extremely well. Ernest is as tall as Ferdinand and Augustus; he\r\nhas dark hair, and fine dark eyes and eyebrows, but the nose and mouth\r\nare not good; he has a most kind, honest and intelligent expression\r\nin his countenance, and has a very good figure. Albert, who is just\r\nas tall as Ernest but stouter, is extremely handsome; his hair is\r\nabout the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he\r\nhas a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the\r\ncharm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful;\r\n_c’est à la fois_ full of goodness and sweetness, and very clever\r\nand intelligent. We went upstairs with them, and after staying a few\r\nminutes with them, I went up to my room. Played and sang. Drew. At a\r\nlittle after 4 Uncle Ernest and my Cousins came up to us and stayed in\r\nmy room till 10 minutes past 5. Both my Cousins are so kind and good;\r\nthey are much more _formés_ and men of the world than Augustus; they\r\nspeak English very well, and I speak it with them. Ernest will be 18\r\nyears old on the 21st of June and Albert 17 on the 26th of August. Dear\r\nUncle Ernest made me the present of a most delightful _Lory_, which\r\nis so tame that it remains on your hand, and you may put your finger\r\ninto its beak, or do anything with it, without its ever attempting to\r\nbite. It is larger than Mamma’s grey Parrot, and has a most beautiful\r\nplumage; it is scarlet, blue, brown, yellow, and purple. At 6 we went\r\nwith Lehzen, Lady Flora &c., to dine at the Archbishop of York’s, and I\r\nwas very sorry to leave my dear Uncle and Cousins behind us at home....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.S.H. Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg_\r\n\r\n  _aged nine_\r\n\r\n  _from a portrait by Schneider, after Eckhart._]\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 19th May._—Read in the _Exposition_ while my hair was\r\ndoing. At 9 we breakfasted with Uncle Ernest, Ernest, Albert, Lehzen\r\nand Charles. I sat between my dear Cousins. At ½ past 10 Lehzen and I\r\nwalked in the gardens and came home at ½ past 11. At a ¼ to 12 came\r\nthe Dean till ½ past 12. Read with him in the New Testament and in\r\nClarendon. At ½ past 12 came Mr. Steward till ½ past 1. Played and\r\nsung. At a ¼ past 2 came the Dean till 3. Read with him in Paley. At 3\r\ncame Mrs. Anderson till 4. At a ¼ to 5 we walked in the gardens with\r\nLehzen till ½ past 5. Wrote my journal. At 7 we dined. Besides us 3 and\r\nUncle, my Cousins and Charles,—Count Kolowrat (one of Uncle Ernest’s\r\ngentlemen), Lady Flora and the Miss Conroys &c., dined here. I sat\r\nbetween dear Ernest and dear Albert. After dinner came Aunt Sophia.\r\nReceived a very kind letter from dear Aunt Louise and some ribbons.\r\nStayed up till ½ past 10. I like my Cousins extremely, they are so\r\nkind, so good, and so merry....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 21st May._— ... At ½ past 7 we dined with Uncle Ernest,\r\nErnest, Albert, Charles, Lady Flora, Count Kolowrat, Baron Alvensleben,\r\n&c. I sat between my dear Cousins. After dinner came Princess Sophia.\r\nBaron de Hoggier, who had arrived from Lisbon the day before, came\r\nafter dinner, and took leave, on his way home. I sat between my dear\r\nCousins on the sofa and we looked at drawings. They both draw very\r\nwell, particularly Albert, and are both exceedingly fond of music;\r\nthey play very nicely on the piano. The more I see them the more I am\r\ndelighted with them, and the more I love them. They are so natural, so\r\nkind, so _very_ good and so well instructed and informed; they are so\r\nwell bred, so truly merry and quite like children and yet very grown up\r\nin their manners and conversation. It is delightful to be with them;\r\nthey are so fond of being occupied too; they are quite an example for\r\nany young person....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 22nd May._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. Read in _Cornwallis\r\non the Sacrament_ while my hair was doing. At a ¼ past 9 we all\r\nbreakfasted. I sat between _i miei carissimi cugini_. At a ¼ past 10\r\ndear Lehzen and I walked out in the gardens and came home at a ¼ to\r\n11. Received the news of the death of my poor old Nurse, Mrs. Brock,\r\nwhich took place the day before yesterday. She was not a pleasant\r\nperson, and undoubtedly had, as everybody has, her faults, but she\r\nwas extremely attached to and fond of me, having been with me from my\r\nbirth till my fifth year, therefore it is impossible, and it would be\r\nvery wrong, if I did not feel her death. My chief regret is, that she\r\ndid not live till I was my own mistress, and could make her quite\r\ncomfortable....[237]\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 24th May._—I awoke at 7. Today I complete my 17th year; a\r\nvery old person I am indeed! I am most thankful that I was brought\r\nthrough this year safely, and I beseech my heavenly Father to extend\r\nHis benediction and blessing over me for this year and for many\r\nothers....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 10th June._—At 9 we all breakfasted for the _last_ time\r\ntogether! It was our last HAPPY HAPPY breakfast, with this dear Uncle\r\nand those _dearest_, beloved Cousins, whom I _do_ love so VERY VERY\r\ndearly; _much more dearly_ than any other Cousins in the _world_.\r\nDearly as I love Ferdinand, and also good Augustus, I love Ernest and\r\nAlbert _more_ than them, oh yes, MUCH _more_. Augustus was like a good,\r\naffectionate child, quite unacquainted with the world, phlegmatic,\r\nand talking but very little; but dearest Ernest and dearest Albert\r\nare so grown-up in their manners, so gentle, so kind, so amiable, so\r\nagreeable, so very sensible and reasonable, and so _really_ and truly\r\ngood and kind-hearted. They have both learnt a good deal, and are\r\nvery clever, naturally clever, particularly Albert, who is the most\r\nreflecting of the two, and they like very much talking about serious\r\nand instructive things and yet are so _very very_ merry and gay and\r\nhappy, like young people ought to be; Albert used always to have some\r\nfun and some clever witty answer at breakfast and everywhere; he\r\nused to play and fondle Dash so funnily too. Both he and Ernest are\r\nextremely attentive to _whatever_ they hear and see, and take interest\r\nin everything they see. They were much interested with the sight of St.\r\nPaul’s yesterday. We remained down with them till 10. I then went up\r\nto my room and came down again at a little after 10. We remained with\r\nthem again, Uncle Ernest going in and out of the room. I am so very\r\nfond of _him_ too; now that I know him much better and have talked with\r\nhim, I love him as much as dear Uncle Ferdinand. He is so mild, so kind\r\nand so good. Dearest Albert was playing on the piano when I came down.\r\nAt 11 dear Uncle, my _dearest beloved_ Cousins, and Charles, left us,\r\naccompanied by Count Kolowrat. I embraced both my dearest Cousins most\r\nwarmly, as also my dear Uncle. I cried bitterly, very bitterly....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 31st July._—Read in _The Young Divine_ and began to read in\r\n_Ikon Basilike_ in one vol., a book which came out a few days after\r\npoor Charles I. had been beheaded; while my hair was doing. It is\r\nsaid to have been written by him during his captivity, and contains\r\nmeditations and prayers; but the Dean, who gave it me a few days ago,\r\ntold me that great disputes have arisen as to whether it was really\r\nwritten by Charles, or whether some friend of his had collected sayings\r\nand meditations he might have heard the King make, and put them\r\ntogether and that this point has not been settled yet. Whatever it may\r\nbe, and by whomever it may have been written or compiled, one thing is\r\ncertain, that it is a very good and pious book and is authentic as to\r\nits contents....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 3rd August._—Read in the _Exposition_ and in _The Conquest\r\nof Granada_ while my hair was doing. At 9 we breakfasted. At a ¼ to 10\r\nwe went to the British Gallery with Lehzen to see the Exhibition by the\r\nancient Masters (all private property). Never did I see anything more\r\nbeautiful than this collection of the _immortal Masters’_ paintings,\r\nfor so I must call them as their names will never pass away. There\r\nwere such numbers of beautiful paintings, that I really know not which\r\nto name in preference. Upon the whole, I think the finest were those\r\nby Murillo and Guido. The finest by Murillo are “The Angels coming to\r\nAbraham,” “The return of the Prodigal Son,” splendid both, belonging\r\nto the Duke of Sutherland. “St. Joseph leading the infant Saviour who\r\ncarries a basket of carpenter’s tools,” quite in another style but\r\nbeautiful; “Santa Rosa, espousing the infant Saviour,” exquisite; and\r\n“Portrait of Don Andres de Antrade and his favourite dog,” very fine.\r\nThe finest by Guido are, “The Assumption of the Virgin,” the expression\r\nof the Virgin’s face is beautiful; two different heads of St. Peter,\r\nboth very fine. “The Magdalen,” beautiful. The finest by Vandyke are\r\n“The Virgin and Infant Saviour,” very lovely.... At a ¼ to 4 we went\r\nwith Lehzen and Lady Flora to Chiswick, to the Victoria Asylum or\r\nChildren’s Friend Society. It is a most interesting and delightful\r\nestablishment, and has been founded almost entirely by Lady George[238]\r\nand Miss Murray. It is for poor vagrant girls, who are received under\r\nthe age of 15; and Miss Murray says that they have never had a girl 6\r\nmonths who did not become a perfectly good child. I forget how young\r\nthey receive children, but there are—[unintelligible] girls in all,\r\nand they are divided, a few being in an infant school upstairs. When\r\nthey have become quite good and can read, write and do work of all\r\nkinds necessary for a house, they are sent abroad, mostly to the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, where they are apprenticed and become excellent servants.\r\nMiss Murray told us many curious stories of the depraved and wretched\r\nstate in which many arrive, and how soon they become reformed and good.\r\nThere is one little girl in particular, a very pretty black-eyed girl,\r\n11 years old, called Ellen Ford, who was received two months ago from\r\n_Newgate_, and who boasted she could steal and tell lies better than\r\nanybody. She had been but two or three days in the school, and she got\r\nover 3 high walls, and stole a sheet; she was caught and brought back\r\nagain. Miss Murray spoke to her, and found that the poor girl had no\r\nidea whatever of a _God_, and had a drunken father, a low Irishman;\r\nthis man had lost his 1st wife and married again, and this step-mother\r\ntaught the girl nothing but stealing and lying. Miss Murray told her\r\nof God, and spoke to her very seriously; the girl was put in solitary\r\nconfinement for that night and was taken out the next morning; and ever\r\nsince she has been a perfectly good girl. There are many cases of the\r\nsame sort which Miss Murray said she could relate. Before I finish this\r\nchapter I must mention the Matron, a most respectable excellent person,\r\ncalled Mrs. Bowerhill; she is assisted by her two daughters, and by an\r\nold woman for work; but besides this old woman, the children do all\r\nthe work themselves. We came home at ½ p. 6. I was very much pleased\r\nindeed with all I saw. Miss Murray gave me a book into which she had\r\ncopied several of the letters of the children from abroad, and very\r\nnice well-written letters they are. Miss Murray’s exertions are immense\r\nand most praiseworthy for the Children’s Friend Society. There is a\r\nCommittee of Ladies who meet every other Tuesday I believe; but Lady\r\nGeorge and Miss Murray go down 3 times a week and oftener. At a ¼ p. 7\r\nwe dined. After dinner came Princess Sophia. Stayed up till 10 minutes\r\nto 10....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 8th August._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At a ¼ past 9 we\r\nbreakfasted. At a ¼ to 10 Lehzen and I walked out till ½ past 10.\r\nArranged things for packing. At 11 came my good Lablache and stayed\r\ntill 20 minutes past 12. I sang 1st “Come per me sereno,” from _La\r\nSonnambula_. Then he sang with me “Claudio, Claudio, ritorna fra le\r\nbraccia paterne,” twice over; then he sang with me “Se un istante\r\nall’ offerta d’un soglio,” also from _Elisa e Claudio_. The former\r\nof these two was the one that I sang so very ill on Saturday, but\r\nwhich Lablache did not mind at all. _He_ thought it went better\r\ntoday; but he is too indulgent. _He_ was in delightful voice, and\r\nsang _beautifully_. After this he sang “Non temer il mio bel cadetto”\r\nfrom _Il Posto abbandonato_, by Mercadante, with me. His volubility\r\nof tongue is wonderful; he can sing such quantities of words and at\r\nsuch a rate. There are plenty in this Duo, and still more in “Quand\r\namore,” and in “Voglio dire,” both from _L’Elisire d’Amore_. Then he\r\nsang my favourite “O amato zio” from my dear _Puritani_, with me. After\r\nthis he sang “O nume benefico” with us; then “Ridiamo, cantiamo,” and\r\nthen, _alas! per finire_, “Dopo due lustri ahi! misero,” from _Donna\r\nCaritea_, by Mercadante. Lablache told me that he likes _Guillaume\r\nTell_ the best of _all_ Rossini’s operas, _Otello_ the best of his\r\nOperas Seria, and _Il Barbiere_ the best of his buffa operas. _Ha\r\nragione._ His son (Lablache’s) is gone, he told me; he went yesterday,\r\nas did also Rubini. I asked him if any other of his 8 children sang, or\r\nwere musical. He replied, “Non, ils sont trop jeunes; l’aîné n’a que\r\ndouze ans.” And the youngest of all, he says, is only _2_ years old.\r\nThere is an opera tomorrow, but the boxes &c., &c. are let, shocking to\r\nsay, at the play-house prices, and “C’est un pasticcio,” he said. It\r\nis not in the regular number of nights. He said that I have improved\r\ngreatly in my singing since he has sung with me. After the last trio,\r\nI took leave of _il mio buon e caro Maestro_ with _great_ regret. I\r\nmust repeat again that he is not only a most delightful, patient, and\r\nagreeable master, but a most good-humoured, pleasing, agreeable and\r\nhonest man; his manners are very gentlemanly and quiet, and he has\r\nsomething very frank, open and honest in his countenance; everybody\r\nwho knows him agrees in his being such a good man. I have had _26_\r\nlessons of Lablache and shall think back with great delight on them;\r\nand shall look forward with equal delight to next April, when I hope\r\nLablache will be here, so that I can resume them again. It was such a\r\npleasure to hear his fine voice and to sing with him. Everything that\r\nis pleasant, alas! passes so quickly in this “wide world of troubles.”\r\nHow often I have experienced that, in greater pleasures, when my dear\r\nrelations have left me! But then there are the pleasant _recollections_\r\nof all that is past, and one must be happy one has had them. I was\r\nexceedingly delighted with this my _last_ lesson; the time seemed to\r\nfly even faster than usual, for it always appeared to me that these\r\npleasant lessons were over in an instant. Lablache accompanied really\r\nvery fairly, and when he came to any difficult parts, he put in “des\r\naccords,” which did just as well. I have already mentioned how very\r\nobliging he is; he was always ready to sing anything I like and to stay\r\nas long as I liked. He is extremely active for his size, which really\r\nis very considerable. It amused me always to see him come in and go\r\nout of my room; he walked so erect and made such a fine dignified bow.\r\nSo now all, all is over for this season, not only the Opera but my\r\nfavourite singing-lessons too....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 10th August._— ... A propos, I shall never forget when, in\r\nmy first singing-lesson, I was so frightened to sing before Lablache,\r\nhe said in his good-natured way, “Personne n’a jamais eu peur de moi,”\r\nwhich I am sure nobody can ever be who knows him....\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _Friday, 16th September_.—At ½ past 9 we breakfasted, that\r\nis to say, dearest Uncle, we two, Lehzen &c., Lady Catherine not being\r\nwell enough, and Uncle’s two gentlemen being gone to town. Went up to\r\nmy room and copied out music. At about a ¼ to 12 dearest Uncle came and\r\nsat with me till ½ p. 12. He talked over many important things. He is\r\n_so_ clever, _so_ mild, and _so_ prudent; _he_ alone can give me good\r\nadvice on _every_ thing. His advice is perfect. He is indeed “il mio\r\nsecondo padre” or rather “_solo_ padre”! for he is indeed like my real\r\nfather, as I have none, and he is so kind and so good to me, he has\r\never been so to me. He has been and always is of such use to me and\r\ndoes _so_ much good....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 18th September._—Baron Moncorvo brought yesterday the\r\ndistressing news that the same unfortunate revolution which took place\r\nin Spain, has likewise taken place in Portugal, and that the Queen\r\nwas forced to proclaim the constitution of 1820 similar to the one of\r\n1812.[239] It happened between Friday the 9th and Saturday the 10th, in\r\nthe night. I do so feel for poor dear Ferdinand in this trying moment,\r\nas also for the poor good Queen. The difference between this and the\r\none in Spain was: that in _Portugal_ they behaved respectfully towards\r\ndear Ferdinand and Donna Maria, and in Spain they almost insulted the\r\nQueen Regent. In Portugal, thank God! no blood has been shed. As soon\r\nas the Empress heard what had happened, or rather what would happen,\r\nshe hastened to the Palace de Necessidades, where Ferdinand and the\r\nQueen were, arrived there at 3 o’clock in the night, and remained there\r\ntill all was over. The Princess Isabella, the Queen’s Aunt (and the\r\nformer Regent), also came and remained with them. Uncle Leopold was\r\nmuch shocked and distressed when he heard it, as were we also, I am\r\nsure.... Dear Uncle came up for a minute and brought us 3 letters which\r\nVan de Weyer had written to him, giving a detailed account of these\r\nhorrid transactions at Lisbon. Van de Weyer’s conduct throughout this\r\ndreadful business, when everybody else seems to have lost their heads\r\nand senses, was most courageous, prudent and judicious; and if his and\r\nFerdinand’s advice had been followed, the Queen would _not_ have been\r\nobliged to sign the Promulgation of the _Constitution_ of 1820. Van de\r\nWeyer says that _all_ was given up “avec la plus affreuse lâcheté!”\r\nwithout a struggle or attempt, when _all might yet have been saved_....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 21st September._— ... Dear Uncle came up and fetched us\r\ndown to breakfast, as he has done already once before, and twice for\r\ndinner. He always accompanied us upstairs when we went to bed. It was\r\nour last breakfast with him; I sat, as usual, near him and General\r\nGoblet.[240] To hear dear Uncle speak on any subject is like reading\r\na highly instructive book; his conversation is so enlightened, so\r\nclear. He is universally admitted to be one of the first politicians\r\nnow extant. He speaks so mildly, yet firmly and impartially, about\r\nPolitics. Uncle tells me that Belgium is quite a pattern for its\r\norganisation, industry and prosperity; the finances are in the greatest\r\nperfection. Uncle is so beloved and revered by his Belgian subjects,\r\nthat it must be a great compensation for all his extreme trouble. He is\r\nso mild, gentle and kind, and so clever and firm....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mᵐᵉ Malibran\r\n  from recollection\r\n  P.V. del. Bentest[?]\r\n  Sept. 1836.\r\n\r\n  MADAME MALIBRAN.\r\n  From a sketch by Princess Victoria.]\r\n\r\n_Monday, 26th September._— ... Read in the Morning Post of\r\ntoday the melancholy and almost incredible news of the _death_\r\nof—_Malibran_![241] which took place at Manchester on Friday night\r\nat 12 o’clock, at the early age of 28. She had gone there for the\r\nfestival which took place the week before last, and only sang on\r\nTuesday the 13th instant, and tried to do so on the Wednesday but was\r\nunable, after which she was taken so alarmingly ill that all singing\r\nwas over. On Saturday the account in the papers was that she was out\r\nof danger, but the improvement was only transient and on Friday\r\nnight this wonderful singer and extraordinary person was no more. She\r\nwill be, and is, a very _great_ loss indeed; for, though I liked and\r\nadmired Grisi by far more than Malibran, I admired many parts of the\r\nlatter’s singing very much, in particular those touching and splendid\r\nlow notes which gave one quite a thrill. In point of cleverness and\r\ngenius there is not a doubt that Malibran far surpassed Grisi; for she\r\nwas not proficient alone in singing and acting, she knew Spanish (her\r\nown language), Italian, French, English, and German perfectly, as also\r\nvarious Italian _patois_. She composed very prettily, drew well, rode\r\nwell on horseback, danced beautifully, and enfin _climbed_ well, as\r\nGeneral Alava told us, who knew her very well; he said you could speak\r\nwith her on any subject and she was equally _à son aise_. She was born\r\nin 1808 at Paris, and is the daughter of a famous Spanish singer called\r\n_Garcia_; she married first an old French merchant called _Malibran_,\r\nfrom whom she was divorced; and secondly this spring the incomparable\r\nviolinist De Bériot. Mamma saw her make her debut as _Maria Garcia_,\r\nonly 16 years old, in _Il Crociato_, at the Italian Opera in London,\r\nas “un giovinetto Cavalier.” There is something peculiarly awful\r\nand striking in the death of this great Cantatrice, undoubtedly the\r\n_second in the world_, (Grisi being the _first_ in _my opinion_). To be\r\nthus cut off in the bloom of her youth and the height of her career,\r\nsuddenly, is dreadful!...\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 28th September._— ... The news from Lisbon are far from\r\ngood, I am _sorry to say_. Mamma received a letter from Van de Weyer\r\nthis morning, dated 11th Sept., in which he said that there had\r\nbeen another _émeute_ the afternoon before, which however had been\r\ndissipated, and that both _dearest_ Ferdinand and Donna Maria showed\r\ngreat calmness and dignity. It is a great trial for poor dear Ferdinand\r\nand for the good Queen. Van de Weyer says they are all in a very\r\nuncomfortable situation....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 30th September._— ... Read in _The Times_ last night a\r\ndistressing account of the details of poor Malibran’s illness and\r\ndeath. Poor young creature! she seems to have been neglected at a time\r\nwhen her life might perhaps still have been saved; for she complained\r\nof head-ache and shivering the same afternoon she arrived (Sunday\r\n11th Sept.). On the Wednesday night after singing that fine but _now_\r\npainful Duo “Vanne se alberghi in petto,” she was taken so very very\r\nill. Notwithstanding all this she got up on Thursday morning and\r\nwas dressed with the assistance of Mrs. Richardson, landlady of the\r\nMosely Arms Hotel at Manchester, for she had no female attendant, a\r\nman-servant of De Bériot’s being (as is said in the newspapers, for all\r\nwhat I have hitherto related about her illness and death is taken from\r\nthe newspapers) their only servant. In spite of every effort to prevent\r\nher, the poor dying Malibran insisted upon going to the Oratorio that\r\nmorning, and was accordingly carried to her carriage; but being seized\r\nwith hysterics she was instantly taken back. She never left her room,\r\nand scarcely her bed, from that time till her death. Dr. Belluomini,\r\nher own Physician, only arrived on Sunday the 18th, though other\r\nphysicians had attended her (from Manchester) before. She was perfectly\r\ninsensible when she died; as also two or 3 days before her death. De\r\nBériot was distracted and overpowered on learning of her death, in\r\nanother room whither they had compelled him to retire when it was\r\ndrawing to a close. He never saw her afterwards, and left the place 2\r\nhours after all was over. It is the most melancholy end that could be\r\nimagined! To come to an inn in a foreign land with nobody to nurse her,\r\nand _die_ there! What a sad and tragical end to her bright career! I\r\ncan still hardly believe it possible that she, whom I can see before\r\nme as she was at our own concert, dressed in white satin, so merry and\r\nlively, and whose pathetic voice when speaking I can hear, is now in\r\nthe silent tomb; for the funeral was to take place at 10 o’clock this\r\nmorning with great splendour. And so today, all, all is over with poor\r\nMalibran!...\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 9th October._— ... We went to the church at Ramsgate with\r\nLady Catherine and Lehzen. Mr. Harvey preached. The text was from the\r\n5th chapter of the 2nd Epistle to Cor., 10th verse: “For we must all\r\nappear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every man may receive\r\nthe things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it\r\nbe good or bad.” Came home at 20 minutes to 1. Wrote my journal. Copied\r\nout music. At a ¼ to 3 we went to the chapel with Lady Catherine and\r\ndear Lehzen, &c. The service was read by Mr. Lewis, and Dr. Longley\r\n(late Master of Harrow School) preached, and _most beautifully_; so\r\nmildly and emphatically; his voice is very good, his pronunciation very\r\npure, his delivery calm and impressive, his language beautiful yet\r\nsimple, and his appearance very pleasing. He must be between 30 and 40,\r\nI should say. The text was from the 3rd chapter of Daniel, 16th, 17th,\r\nand 18th verses: “Shadrach, Meshech, and Abed-nego answered and said to\r\nthe King, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this\r\nmatter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from\r\nthe burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of thine hand, O\r\nKing. But if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not serve\r\nthy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.” It was a\r\nmost beautiful sermon in every way, and I was _very much_ pleased and\r\nimpressed with it. Dr. Longley is to be Bishop of Ripon....[242]\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 27th October._— ... Read in _The Conquest of Granada_\r\nwhile my hair was doing. At 9 we breakfasted. Wrote a letter to my\r\nbrother. At 10 came the Dean till ½ p. 11. Read with him in the\r\nN.T., in _The Life of Colonel Hutchinson_, and in Paley. _The Life\r\nof Colonel Hutchinson_ is written by his wife, who wrote it for her\r\nchildren after their father’s death. Colonel Hutchinson lived in the\r\ntime of Charles I., the Commonwealth, and even of Charles II. He was\r\non the Puritanical side, and though a very good man, signed the King’s\r\ndeath-warrant, being very _strong_ on his side, which is to be seen by\r\nMrs. Hutchinson’s writings; his and her feelings being totally opposite\r\nto Clarendon’s, render it interesting, though it is more a private\r\naccount of his life than any public History of the Times, but of course\r\na good deal of history will be mixed up in it as Col. Hutchinson had\r\na good deal to do in the wars. Mrs. Hutchinson’s style is remarkably\r\nquaint and ancient, indeed in some parts so much so as to render it\r\nalmost ridiculous, but there are again some very pretty feeling parts\r\nin it (indeed feeling and pious throughout it), one of which, in which\r\nshe speaks of her husband and herself I shall quote; before I do so,\r\nhowever, I must say that the editor, a descendant of the family, has\r\nleft the orthography just as she wrote it, which is very antiquated\r\nand imperfect: “The greatest excellence she (Mrs. Hutchinson) had was\r\nthe power of apprehending and the vertue of loving his (Col. H.’s)\r\nsoe as his shadow, she waited on him every where, till he was taken\r\ninto that region of light, which admits of none, and then she vanisht\r\ninto nothing.” There is likewise another passage speaking of a son she\r\nlost: “... call’d by his owne name John, who liv’d scarce six yeares,\r\nand was a very hopefull child, full of his father’s vigor and spiritt,\r\nbut death soone nipt that blossome.” Lehzen of course still continues\r\nreading to me while I dress, the delightful letters of Mme. de Sévigné;\r\nwe are now in the middle of the 10th vol., and I like them more and\r\nmore, they are so beautiful, so easy, they show the character of the\r\nperson who wrote them so perfectly, you become acquainted with her\r\nand hers, and there are such tender and beautiful feelings expressed\r\nin them, towards that daughter who was her all & all; and the style\r\nis so elegant and so beautiful. I shall quote a passage relating to\r\na vexation she had about not procuring the “députation” for her son\r\nM. de Sévigné: “Ne faut-il point être juste et se mettre à la place\r\ndes gens? c’est ce qu’on ne fait jamais.” How true this is. Then how\r\npretty this is, in writing to Mme. de Grignan: “Vous me louez trop\r\nde la douce retraite que je fais ici; rien n’y est pénible que votre\r\nabsence.” There is certainly nothing so beautiful of the kind, in any\r\nlanguage as these letters. I shall just quote two passages from the\r\nextracts in _The Edinburgh Review_ of Sir James Mackintosh’s life,\r\nabout Mme. de Sévigné: “In the midst of all the rage felt at Paris\r\nagainst King William, the admirable good-sense and natural moderation\r\nof Mme. de Sévigné catches a glimpse of his real character, through the\r\nmists of Rome and Versailles: ‘Le prince n’a pas songé à faire périr\r\nson beau-père. Il est à Londres, à la place du Roi, sans en prendre\r\nle nom, ne voulant que rétablir une religion qu’il croit bonne, et\r\nmaintenir les loix du pays sans qu’il en coûte une goutte de sang....\r\nPour le Roi d’Angleterre il y (St. Germains) parait content,—et c’est\r\npour cela qu’il est là.’ Observe the perfect good-sense of the last\r\nremark, and the ease and liveliness with which it is made. Tacitus and\r\nMachiavel could have said nothing better; but a superficial reader\r\nwill think no more of it than the writer herself seems to do.”—Again,\r\nfurther on: “The style of Mme. de Sévigné is evidently copied not only\r\nby her worshipper Walpole, but even by Gray; who notwithstanding the\r\nextraordinary merits of his matter, has the double stiffness of an\r\nimitator and of a college recluse....”\r\n\r\n_Friday, 28th October._—I awoke at 7 and got up at 20 minutes to 8.\r\nRead in the _Exposition_ while my hair was doing. Received a most kind\r\ndear and pretty letter from dearest Aunt Louise, from which I will copy\r\na passage: “I have today not much to say. It is my brother Nemours’\r\nbirthday; and in the same time, the anniversary of the death of my dear\r\ngoverness” (Mme. de Mallet, who died when Aunt Louise was at Paris last\r\nyear) “of the best and truest friend I had for twenty years, to make me\r\nmelancholy. In her was broken the first link of the chain of my strong\r\nand youthful affections. How many more shall I live perhaps to see\r\ndestroyed?” How pretty and feeling this is; it comes straight from her\r\ndear good heart. I can well say of my _precious_ Lehzen what she says\r\nof Mme. de Mallet, that she is my “best and truest friend” I have had\r\nfor nearly 17 years and I trust I shall have for 30 or 40 and _many_\r\nmore!...\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 1st November._— ... Read in _The Conquest of Granada_, and\r\nwrote my journal. There are two lines in _Rokeby_ (which is so full of\r\nbeauty that I could copy the whole and not find one part which is not\r\nfull of loveliness, sweetness, grace, elegance, and feeling, for the\r\nimmortal bard who wrote these beautiful poems never _could_ write an\r\n_ugly_ line in _my_ opinion) which struck me, as well as the Dean, who\r\nis, s’il est permis de le dire, poetry-mad, as most splendid.... Oh!\r\nWalter Scott is my _beau idéal_ of a Poet; I do so admire him both in\r\nPoetry and Prose!...\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 3rd November._— ... After 7 we dined. The Duke of\r\nWellington, the Countess of Ashburnham,[243] and Lady Elinor\r\nAshburnham,[244] Lord and Lady Radstock,[245] Lord and Lady\r\nBarham,[246] Colonel Stopford,[247] Colonel Barnard, Mr. Sicklemore,\r\nand Mr. Mayhew dined here. I sat between the Duke of Wellington and\r\nLord Radstock. The Duke looked remarkably well and was in very good\r\nspirits. Lady Barham looked very handsome; she had a reddish brown\r\nvelvet turban and a dark velvet dress. She is a likeness of the\r\nDuchess of Sutherland in dark, but the Duchess is handsomer, in figure\r\nand all together handsomer, having a finer nose and mouth than Lady\r\nBarham. Lady Barham has a beautiful brow and fine dark expressive\r\neyes with a fine pale complexion, but the lower part of her face,\r\nparticularly the mouth and chin, are not at all good. She looks 28 and\r\nis only 22....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 6th November._— ... We walked home at 1. Read in _Astoria_.\r\nAdded a few lines to my letter to Feodore. Wrote one to Aunt Sophia\r\nand my journal. At ½ p. 2 we went out with _dearest_ Lehzen and came\r\nhome at a little before 4. Received a most kind letter from dearest\r\nUncle Leopold accompanied by a “supplément extraordinaire” to the\r\n_Moniteur Universel_, giving an account of the “échauffourée” which\r\ntook place at Strasburg on the 30th October, headed by Louis Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte,[248] a young man of 28 years old, son of the Duchesse\r\nde St. Leu (Hortense), and who tried to make the Troops rise in his\r\nfavour, but the latter proved faithful to their King (Louis Philippe)\r\nand country, as they ought; and the Prince and Rebels have been put in\r\nprison. The Queen of the French sent Uncle the paper....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 20th November._— ... Read a letter of Lord Palmerston’s to\r\nMamma relative to the late unfortunate affairs at Lisbon, which is very\r\nconsolatory. Marshal Saldanha was charged to bring about the reaction,\r\nwhich was to spread first in the provinces and then to the capital\r\nand the Queen was _not_ to give the first impulse.[249] Unfortunately\r\npoor Donna Maria was hurried into this step by the jealousy of those\r\nabout her. The friends of the Duke of Terceira, unwilling that Marshal\r\nSaldanha should have the credit of the reaction, snatched it out of\r\nhis hands and brought on all this confusion. However, Lord Palmerston\r\nconcludes with this: “The result of the whole is, that the Queen’s\r\nposition is _better_ than it _was_, not so _bad_ as it _might_ have\r\nbeen after such a failure, but _much less good_ than if she had waited\r\npatiently till the proper time for action had arrived. The Prince\r\nbehaved throughout with spirit, courage and firmness and has acquired\r\nby his conduct the respect of both parties.” That our beloved and\r\nprecious Ferdinand has behaved in such a way is most _delightful_ for\r\nme, who _love him_ like the _dearest of Brothers_. It could not be\r\notherwise, I was sure....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 29th November._— ... At 8 we left poor West Cliff House....\r\nWe reached Canterbury in safety in spite of the rain and some wind,\r\nbut not very long after we left it, it began to blow so dreadfully,\r\naccompanied by floods of rain at intervals, that our carriage swung and\r\nthe post-boys could scarcely keep on their horses. As we approached\r\nSittingbourne, the _hurricane_, for I cannot call it by any other name,\r\nbecame quite frightful and even alarming; corn stacks were flying\r\nabout, trees torn up by their roots, and chimneys blown to atoms. We\r\ngot out, or rather were _blown_ out, at Sittingbourne. After staying\r\nthere for a short while we got into the carriage where Lady Theresa\r\nand Lehzen were, with them, which being larger and heavier than our\r\npost-chaise, would not shake so much. For the first 4 or 5 miles all\r\nwent on more smoothly and I began to hope our difficulties were at an\r\nend. Alas! far from it. The wind blew worse than before and in going\r\ndown the hill just before Chatham, the hurricane was so tremendous that\r\nthe horses stopped for a minute, and I thought that we were undone,\r\nbut by dint of whipping and very good management of the post-boys\r\nwe reached Rochester in safety. Here we got out, and here it was\r\ndetermined that we must pass the night. Here we are therefore, and here\r\nwe must remain, greatly to my annoyance, for I am totally unprepared,\r\nLehzen’s and my wardrobe maid are gone on to Claremont, and I hate\r\nsleeping at an Inn. I had been so glad at the thought of not doing so\r\nthis time, mais “l’homme propose et Dieu dispose,” and it would have\r\nbeen temerity to proceed, for a coach had been upset on the bridge\r\njust before we arrived, and the battlements of the bridge itself were\r\ntotally blown in....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 18th December._— ... I sat between Mr. Croker[250] and Col.\r\nWemyss.[251] Der erste ist ein kluger, aber nach meiner Meinung, nicht\r\nangenehmer Mann; er spricht zu viel. He has a very excellent memory and\r\ntells anecdotes cleverly but with a peculiar pronunciation of the _r_.\r\nHe said that the Duke of Wellington had told him that the character\r\nof the 3 nations, the English, Scotch, and Irish, was very apparent\r\nin the army. He said (the Duke), “It may seem like a joke what I am\r\ngoing to say, but it is quite true; the _Scotch_ were pleased when the\r\n_money_ arrived, the _Irish_ when they got into a _wine country_, and\r\nthe _English_ when the _roast beef_ came up.” He told many anecdotes\r\nand made many remarks upon the various nations, ein wenig sehr stark.\r\nIl aime trop à étaler, il n’a pas de tacte; il prend trop le ton\r\nsupérieur....\r\n\r\nCLAREMONT, _Saturday, 24th December (Xmas Eve)_.—I awoke after 7\r\nand got up at 8. After 9 we breakfasted. At a little after 10 we\r\nleft Kensington with dearest Lehzen, Lady Conroy and—_Dashy_! and\r\nreached Claremont at a ¼ to 12. Played and sang. At 2 dearest Lehzen,\r\nVictoire and I [? went out] and came home at 20 minutes p. 3. No one\r\nwas stirring about the Gipsy encampment except George, which I was\r\nsorry for, as I was anxious to know how our poor friends were after\r\nthis bitterly cold night. Played and sang. Received from dearest best\r\nLehzen as a Christmas box: 2 lovely little Dresden china figures, 2\r\npair of lovely little chased gold buttons, a small lovely button with\r\nan angel’s head which she used to wear herself, and a pretty music\r\nbook; from good Louis a beautiful piece of Persian stuff for an album;\r\nand from Victoire and Emily Gardiner a small box worked by themselves.\r\nWrote my journal. Went down to arrange Mamma’s table for her. At 6\r\nwe dined. Mr. Edmund Byng[252] and Mr. Conroy dined here. Mr. Byng\r\nis going to stay here a night or two. Very soon after dinner Mamma\r\nsent for us into the Gallery, where all the things were arranged on\r\ndifferent tables. From my dear Mamma I received a beautiful massive\r\ngold buckle in the shape of two serpents; a lovely little delicate\r\ngold chain with a turquoise clasp; a lovely coloured sketch of dearest\r\nAunt Louise by Partridge, copied from the picture he brought, and so\r\nlike her; 3 beautiful drawings by Munn, one lovely sea view by Purser,\r\nand one beautiful cattle piece by Cooper (all coloured), 3 prints, a\r\nbook called _Finden’s Tableaux_, _Heath’s Picturesque Annual for 1837,\r\nIreland_; both these are very pretty; _Friendship’s Offering_, and _The\r\nEnglish Annual for 1837_, _The Holy Land_ illustrated beautifully,\r\ntwo handkerchiefs, a very pretty black satin apron trimmed with red\r\nvelvet, and two almanacks. I am very thankful to my dear Mamma for\r\nall these very pretty things. From dear Uncle Leopold, a beautiful\r\nturquoise ring; from the Queen a fine piece of Indian gold tissue; and\r\nfrom Sir J. Conroy a print. I gave my dear Lehzen a green morocco jewel\r\ncase, and the _Picturesque Annual_; Mamma gave her a shawl, a dress,\r\na pair of turquoise earrings, an annual, and handkerchiefs. I then\r\ntook Mamma to the Library where my humble table was arranged. I gave\r\nher a bracelet made of my hair, the clasp of which contains Charles’,\r\nFeodore’s and my hair; and the _Keepsake_ and _Oriental Annual_. Lehzen\r\ngave her two pair of little buttons just like mine. I danced a little\r\nwith Victoire. Stayed up till 11.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 25th December (Xmas day)._—At 9 we all breakfasted. Mamma,\r\nLehzen and I read prayers. Arranged my new drawings. At a little\r\nbefore 2 dearest Lehzen, Victoire and I went out and came home at 3.\r\nAs we were approaching _the camp_,[253] we met Rea coming from it, who\r\nhad been sent there by Mamma to enquire into the story of these poor\r\nwanderers. He told us (what I was quite sure of before) that all was\r\nquite true, that the poor young woman and baby were doing very well,\r\nthough very weak and miserable and that what they wanted chiefly was\r\nfuel and nourishment. Mamma has ordered broth and fuel to be sent\r\ntonight, as also 2 blankets; and several of our people have sent old\r\nflannel things for them. Mamma has ordered that the broth and fuel is\r\nto be sent each day till the woman is recovered. Lehzen sent them by\r\nour footmen a little worsted knit jacket for the poor baby, and when we\r\ndrove by, Aunt Sarah,[254] the old woman and the Husband all looked out\r\nand bowed most gratefully. Rea gave them directly a sovereign. I cannot\r\nsay how happy I am that these poor creatures are assisted, for they are\r\nsuch a nice set of Gipsies, so quiet, so affectionate to one another,\r\nso discreet, not at all forward or importunate, and _so_ grateful; so\r\nunlike the gossiping, fortune-telling race-gipsies; and this is such a\r\npeculiar and touching case. Their being assisted makes me quite merry\r\nand happy today, for yesterday night when I was safe and happy at home\r\nin that cold night and today when it snowed so and everything looked\r\nwhite, I felt quite unhappy and grieved to think that our poor gipsy\r\nfriends should perish and shiver for want; and now today I shall go to\r\nbed happy, knowing they are better off and more comfortable....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 29th December._— ... At 12 we went out with dear Lehzen\r\nand came home at 2. Everything still looked very white and the ground\r\nrather slippery but not so much as yesterday. It snowed part of the\r\ntime we were walking. I saw Aunt Sarah and the least pretty of the two\r\nsisters-in-law, who has returned, in a shop at Esher. How I _do_ wish\r\nI could do something for their _spiritual_ and _mental_ benefit and\r\nfor the education of their children and in particular for the poor\r\nlittle baby who I have known since its birth, in the admirable manner\r\nMr. Crabbe in his _Gipsies’ Advocate_ so strongly urges; he beseeches\r\nand urges those who have kind hearts and Christian feelings to think of\r\nthese poor wanderers, who have many good qualities and who have many\r\ngood people amongst them. He says, and alas! I _too well_ know its\r\ntruth, from experience, that whenever any poor Gipsies are encamped\r\nanywhere and crimes and robberies &c. occur, it is invariably laid to\r\ntheir account, which is shocking; and if they are always looked upon as\r\nvagabonds, how _can_ they become good people? I trust in Heaven that\r\nthe day may come when _I_ may do something for these poor people, and\r\nfor this particular family! I am sure that the little kindness which\r\nthey have experienced from us will have a good and lasting effect on\r\nthem!...\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GYPSY WOMEN.\r\n\r\n  From a sketch by Princess Victoria.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  This was her _annus mirabilis_, her wonder-year. The earlier months\r\n  passed much as usual. On 24th May she was eighteen years old. The\r\n  entry in her Journal shows some presentiment of what was to come.\r\n  In less than a month she had stepped from out of the precincts of\r\n  that quiet, ill-furnished palace in Kensington Gardens into the\r\n  full glare of the Throne. The 20th June was her most wonderful\r\n  day, but although keenly alive to its significance and glory, she\r\n  never lost her self-control. The hidden forces which even her\r\n  Journals failed to reveal, appear so to have moulded her character\r\n  that she was enabled to appreciate and yet resist the glamours of\r\n  this supreme moment. There is not a trace of doubt or misgiving.\r\n  She was conscious of a mysterious duty imposed upon her by Divine\r\n  Providence, and although she obviously felt her inexperience, she\r\n  never for a moment doubted her fitness for her task. King William\r\n  died at Windsor soon after two in the morning, and three hours\r\n  later the Archbishop and Lord Conyngham were at Kensington Palace.\r\n  The Princess received them in a dressing-gown hastily thrown over\r\n  her nightdress, her feet in slippers, and her fair hair loose about\r\n  her head. Four hours later she received for the first time Lord\r\n  Melbourne, the Prime Minister, who was destined until the day of\r\n  her marriage to exercise a potent influence over her thoughts and\r\n  actions. Her caution in the selection of confidantes, her wariness\r\n  in granting her approval, and her care to safeguard the regal\r\n  tradition, are clearly apparent from the day of her accession.\r\n  Although she accepted advice, she never appeared to yield. There\r\n  is nothing in these Journals that displays the inner thoughts of\r\n  the Queen, in a light differing from that in which her conduct\r\n  appeared both to her Ministers and to her courtiers. Then, as in\r\n  after-years, she fulfilled the hope publicly expressed by Lord\r\n  John Russell, that she would prove to be an Elizabeth without her\r\n  tyranny and an Anne without her weakness.\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that from the day of her accession the Crowns\r\n  of Great Britain and Hanover were divided. Her uncle, Ernest, Duke\r\n  of Cumberland, succeeded to the Throne of Hanover. The fear that\r\n  he might succeed to the Throne of Great Britain had always haunted\r\n  the minds of the people, and added to the feeling of gladness with\r\n  which they welcomed the young Queen. On the second day of her reign\r\n  the name Alexandrina was dropped for ever, and she was thenceforth\r\n  known, as she desired to be, by the name of Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                                 1837\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 8th January._— ... The service was performed by the Dean,\r\nwho gave us likewise a sermon. The text was from the 1st Chapter of\r\nIsaiah,—verse:—“Wash you, make you clean.” At 12 dear Lehzen and I went\r\nout and came home at 10 minutes p. 1. It is today a week that we took\r\nleave of our poor good friends the Gipsies, and I am quite sorry when\r\nI pass the spot so long enlivened by their little camp, and behold it\r\nempty and deserted, and with almost no trace to be seen of their ever\r\nhaving been there. They had been there more than a month, for they\r\nencamped there about 5 days after we arrived here and have been there\r\never since until last Wednesday or Thursday. To _my_ feeling, the chief\r\nornament of the Portsmouth Road is gone since their departure. But this\r\nis their life; they are happy and grateful and we have done them some\r\ngood. The place and spot may be forgotten, but the Gipsy family Cooper\r\nwill _never_ be obliterated from my memory!...\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 10th January._— ... At a ¼ p. 3 came M. Van de Weyer, who\r\narrived in London last night from Lisbon. He gave us most interesting\r\nand most valuable information about Portugal; praised our _dearest_\r\nFerdinand to the skies, said he showed cleverness, firmness, and\r\ncharacter which no other young man of his age hardly ever showed; said\r\nthe poor Queen was totally indifferent to whatever happened, but was\r\nextremely obedient to Ferdinand who had great power over her. He told\r\nus much to distress us, but said that the present ministers were ready\r\nto do anything that was right. He is a most clever, clear-sighted,\r\nsensible little man, Van de Weyer himself. He looks much careworn and\r\nfatigued, and _no_ wonder at it....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 7th February._—Read in _Bajazet_. Read to Lehzen out of\r\n_Polyeucte_ and finished it; it is certainly _very_ beautiful and\r\nfull of most beautiful and highminded feelings, but the end is, to my\r\nfeelings, rather unnatural. Lehzen dictated to me some passages from\r\n_Polyeucte_....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 9th February._— ... Read to dear Lehzen out of the\r\nnewspapers Lord John Russell’s very able and judicious speech\r\non bringing in the Irish Corporation bill; and out of the Irish\r\nHistory.... Read in _Bajazet_ and wrote my journal. Lehzen dictated\r\nFrench to me. Played and sang. Read in Raumer’s _Königinnen_. Read\r\nin Clive’s life[255] while my hair was doing. At 6 we dined. Read in\r\n_Bajazet_. Sang, and Mamma also. Stayed up till 10. Read in School\r\nShakespeare while my hair was undoing.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 8th April._—At 10 came the Dean till 11. Read with him in\r\nthe N.T. and in Boswell’s _Life of Johnson_. At ½ p. 11 I went down\r\nand sat to Mr. Lane[256] till a ¼ to 1. He showed me 4 very beautiful\r\ncoloured drawings by Chalon, 3 portraits,—Mrs. Ashley, very like;\r\nMiss Fanny Wyndham as Contino in _Scaramuccia_, ridiculously like; and\r\nBellini as Figaro; the 4th is a very beautiful head and hands of Juliet\r\nasleep after she has taken the draught. Mr. Lane likewise showed me a\r\nvery beautiful miniature of Lady Blessington[257] painted by Chalon\r\nabout 15 years ago; and a beautiful drawing of C. Kemble as Falstaff,\r\ndone by himself. He is a great friend of Kemble’s and admires him\r\nbeyond everything. He is also very intimate with Mr. Macready, and\r\nsays he is such an excellent father and husband. Charles Mathews, he\r\nsays, speaks Italian as well as he does French.... At 20 minutes p. 7\r\nwe went with dear Lehzen, Lady Theresa, Charles and Lord Ilchester &c.\r\nto the Opera. It was my dear _I Puritani_, and they were singing the\r\nopening Chorus when we came in. Grisi, Rubini, Lablache, and Tamburini\r\nmade their first appearance this season, and were all enthusiastically\r\ncheered on their appearance, in particular my worthy Master and Rubini.\r\nThere is not a word of truth in what was said about Grisi, for I never\r\nsaw anything look more lovely that she did, and she sang deliciously,\r\nas did also Rubini whose voice seems to get if possible finer each\r\nyear. It is useless to add that the singing of these 4 incomparable and\r\nunequalled _artistes_ was, as always, perfection! with the exception\r\nperhaps of Lablache’s being a little hoarse at times; he did not look\r\nwell and was not in his usual spirits I thought. The Quartet “Ah! te o\r\ncara,” the Polacca, “Suoni la tromba,” and “Ella è tremante” were all\r\nloudly encored. After the Opera was over the 4 cantanti were called out\r\nand loudly cheered....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 11th April._—Heard that poor Lady De L’Isle,[258] the King’s\r\neldest daughter, had expired at 10 o’clock the night before. On the\r\ndeath of old Mrs. Strode last February, the King made Lady De L’Isle\r\nhousekeeper of Kensington Palace; and she arrived here about 2 or 3\r\ndays after we came from Claremont, was confined with a daughter about a\r\nmonth ago, and was going on very well, when she was taken so alarmingly\r\nill, I think on Sunday. It is very awful and very dreadful for her 4\r\npoor children.\r\n\r\nAfter 9 we breakfasted. At a little before 10 came the Dean till 12\r\nminutes to 11. Read with him in the N.T. and in Hume. At 11 came my\r\ngood Lablache and stayed till 6 minutes to 12. He was as good-humoured,\r\nkind, ready, and gentlemanlike as ever; there never is any difference\r\nin his manners or ways, may he be ill, well, tired or not tired, he is\r\nalways in the same ready good-humour. He is perhaps a little greyer,\r\n_mais voilà tout_. He was in splendid voice and sang beautifully. It\r\nwas quite a delight for me to hear his fine and unique voice again and\r\nto sing with him; it is such a support to my voice and he accompanies\r\nso agreeably. I sang first with him the favourite duo of mine: “Voglio\r\ndire,” from _L’Elisire d’Amore_; then “Una furtiva lagrima,” a pretty\r\nlittle Aria from the same opera, which I repeated and which Catone\r\nused to sing so nicely, as also “Quanto è bella quanto è cara” from\r\n_L’Elisir_, which I also sung. After this Lablache sang with Mamma and\r\nme “Se il fratel stringere” from _Belisario_, which he _had never seen_\r\nor even _heard_ before!...\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 20th April._—I got up at 8. Read in the _Exposition_ while\r\nmy hair was doing. After 9 we breakfasted. Played and sang; practised\r\nfor Lablache. Drew. At 20 minutes to 2 we went to the Drawing Room with\r\ndear Lehzen, Lady Mary Stopford,[259] Sir George Anson &c. The poor\r\nQueen not being well, the King held the Drawing-room, and (strange to\r\nsay) Princess Augusta represented her. There were several young ladies\r\npresented, amongst whom were Lady Wilhelmina Stanhope (daughter to\r\nthe Earl and Countess Stanhope),[260] a beautiful girl; Lady Fanny\r\nCowper[261] (daughter to the Earl and Countess Cowper), also pretty;\r\nLady Mary Grimston,[262] Miss Louisa Percy,[263] Miss Wynn (niece to\r\nthe Duchess of Northumberland), Victoire Conroy, &c. The poor Duchess\r\nof Northumberland was unable to attend me, having a bad cold. We came\r\nhome at 20 minutes p. 3....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 19th May._—Got up at 8. Wrote the _brouillon_ of a French\r\nletter to dearest Aunt Louise while my hair was doing. After 9 we\r\nbreakfasted. The children played in the room. At 10 Mary,[264] Lehzen,\r\nI and the children went out walking and came home at 10 minutes to 11.\r\nWrote my letter to dearest Aunt Louise. At ½ p. 11 came M. Guazzaroni\r\ntill 12. Received a letter from _the King_ by Lord Conyngham....\r\n\r\nRead in W. Scott’s Life. Received an address from the Mayor and City of\r\nLincoln, which was presented by Colonel Sibthorp[265] and Mr. Edward\r\nLytton Bulwer,[266] the two Members. I was attended by my dearest\r\nLehzen, and Mamma by Lady Flora. Played and sung &c. Wrote my journal.\r\nDrew. Felt very miserable and agitated. Did not go down to dinner, but\r\ndined in my own room at 8 o’clock. Stayed up till 10.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 20th May._—Got up after 8. After 9 we breakfasted. The dear\r\nchildren were in the room and played very merrily. Wrote a letter to\r\nthe King, which Mamma had previously written for me. At 3 minutes\r\npast 11 came my buon Maestro Lablache, looking pale and coughing, and\r\ncomplaining he was still unwell and feared he would remain so till the\r\nweather became warmer....\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Lablache\r\n  from recollection._\r\n\r\n  _P.V. del:—\r\n  Kensington\r\n  Palace Aug. 1836._\r\n\r\n  LUIGI LABLACHE.\r\n\r\n  From a sketch by Princess Victoria.]\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 24th May._—Today is my 18th birthday! How old! and yet\r\nhow far am I from being what I should be. I shall from this day take\r\nthe _firm_ resolution to study with renewed assiduity, to keep my\r\nattention always well fixed on whatever I am about, and to strive to\r\nbecome every day less trifling and more fit for what, if Heaven wills\r\nit, I’m some day to be!... At ½ p. 3 we drove out with Mary and dear\r\nLehzen and came home at 5. The demonstrations of loyalty and affection\r\nfrom all the people were highly gratifying. The parks and streets were\r\nthronged and everything looked like a _Gala_ day. Numbers of people\r\nput down their names and amongst others good old Lablache inscribed\r\nhis.... At ½ p. 10 we went to the ball at St. James’s with the Duchess\r\nof Northumberland, dear Lehzen, Lady Flora and Lady Conroy &c. The King\r\nthough much better was unable of course to be there, and the Queen\r\nneither, so that, strange to say, Princess Augusta made the _honneurs_!\r\nI danced first with Lord Fitzalan,[267] 2ndly with Prince Nicholas\r\nEsterhazy,[268] who is a very amiable, agreeable, gentlemanly young\r\nman; 3rdly with the Marquis of Granby[269]; 4thly with the Marquis of\r\nDouro[270] who is very odd and amusing; and 5thly and lastly with the\r\nEarl of Sandwich[271] who is an agreeable young man. I wished to dance\r\nwith Count Waldstein who is such an amiable man, but he replied that\r\nhe could not dance quadrilles, and as in my station I unfortunately\r\ncannot valse and gallop, I could not dance with him. The beauties\r\nthere were (in my opinion) the Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Frances (or\r\nFanny) Cowper, who is very pleasing, natural and clever-looking.... The\r\nCourtyard and the streets were crammed when we went to the Ball, and\r\nthe anxiety of the people to see poor stupid me was very great, and I\r\nmust say I am quite touched by it, and feel proud which I always have\r\ndone of my country and of the English Nation. I forgot to say that\r\nbefore we went to dinner we saw the dear children. I gave my beloved\r\nLehzen a small brooch of my hair.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 26th May._— ... Wrote a letter to dear Uncle Leopold, to\r\ndearest Albert from whom I received a most kind and affectionate\r\nletter for my birthday yesterday, and to Ernest Hohenlohe. Finished my\r\n_brouillon_ of Aunt’s letter and began to write it. At 2 we went with\r\ndear Lehzen and I received two more Addresses, one from Kidderminster\r\npresented (not _read_) by Lord Foley[272]; the other from the Borough\r\nof Louth by ——. First of all the Sheriffs of the City came and wished\r\nto know when we should be pleased to receive the Address from the Mayor\r\nand Corporation of London....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 29th May._—At ½ p. 1 we went to the Drawing-Room with the\r\nDuchess of Northumberland, dear Lehzen, Lady Mary Stopford, Lady\r\nCatherine Jenkinson, Lady Flora Hastings, Lady Cust, Sir George\r\nAnson, &c. The King and Queen being both unwell, though better, the\r\nDrawing-room was held by the Princess Augusta!! It was an immensely\r\nfull one—2000 people, and we did not get home till a ¼ p. 5. The\r\nhandsomest people there were: the Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Fanny\r\nCowper, the Marchioness of Abercorn,[273] Lady Seymour,[274] Mrs.\r\nBlackwood, &c., &c. Countess Emanuel Zichy (Miss Strachan that was)\r\nand who was also at our Concert, was presented. Count Zichy is very\r\ngood-looking in uniform, but not in plain clothes. Count Waldstein\r\nlooks remarkably well in his pretty Hungarian uniform....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 30th May._—At ½ p. 2 we went into the saloon with Mary and\r\nPrincess Sophia, I being attended by the Duchess of Northumberland\r\nand dear Lehzen, and Mamma by all her ladies and gentlemen. The Lord\r\nMayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London presented Mamma 1st\r\nwith an Address to which she read an answer, and then me with a very\r\nkind one. I only answered the following words, from my own accord: “I\r\nam very thankful for your kindness and my Mother has expressed all my\r\nfeelings.” The Addresses were read by the Recorder of London (Mr. Law).\r\nThere were all together 150 who came up with the Lord Mayor....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 4th June._—Read in the _Exposition_ while my hair was doing.\r\nAt ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. The children played in the room. Wrote a\r\nletter to dear Feodore. Drew. At 11 we went to Chapel with dear Lehzen.\r\nThe whole service was performed by Mr. Jackson. Wrote my journal.\r\nWrote. Drew. At a little after 3 came my good and honest friend,\r\n_Stockmar_,[275] and stayed with me till ½ p. 3. He had a very pleasant\r\nand useful conversation with me; he is one of those few people who tell\r\nplain honest truth, don’t flatter, give wholesome necessary advice, and\r\nstrive to do good and smooth all dissensions. He is Uncle Leopold’s\r\ngreatest and most confidential attached and disinterested friend, and\r\nI hope he is the same to me, at least, I feel so towards him; Lehzen\r\nbeing of course the _greatest_ friend I have....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 15th June._—After 9 we breakfasted. The children played\r\nin the room. At 10 Mary, dear Lehzen and I drove out and came home\r\nat 10 minutes to 11. _Wrote!!_ The news of the King are so very bad\r\nthat all my lessons save the Dean’s are put off, including Lablache’s,\r\nMrs. Anderson’s, Guazzaroni’s, &c., &c., and we see _nobody_. I regret\r\nrather my singing-lesson, though it is only for a short period, but\r\nduty and _proper feeling_ go before _all pleasures_.—10 minutes to\r\n1,—I just hear that the Doctors think my poor Uncle the King cannot\r\nlast more than 48 hours! Poor man! he was always kind to me, and he\r\n_meant_ it well I know; I am grateful for it, and shall ever remember\r\nhis kindness with gratitude. He was odd, very odd and singular, but his\r\nintentions were often ill interpreted!—Wrote my journal. At about a ¼\r\np. 2 came Lord Liverpool and I had a highly important conversation with\r\nhim—_alone_....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 16th June._— ... Began and read to Lehzen out of De Lolme, _On\r\nthe English Constitution_. I forgot to mention that Lehzen finished\r\nreading to me on the 16th of May the delightful letters of Mme. de\r\nSévigné, and began on the following day _Les Mémoires de l’Impératrice\r\nJoséphine_, par Mdlle. Le Normand, en 2 tomes, which is written in a\r\nvery affected and flourished style, but is amusing. The news of the\r\npoor King were a shade better. At a little after 5 we drove out with\r\nMary and Lehzen and came home at a ¼ to 7. At ½ p. 7 we dined. Saw the\r\nchildren before dinner. Sang _un poco_. Stayed up till ½ p. 10.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 17th June._—Read in the _Exposition_ while my hair was\r\ndoing. After 9 we breakfasted. The children played in the room. At 10\r\nMary, dear Lehzen, the dear children and I drove out and came home at\r\n11. I like Mary very much; she is a very honest, warm-hearted, good\r\nsoul, and very susceptible of kindness shown to her; she is extremely\r\ndiscreet and retiring too. The news of the King are worse again today.\r\nWrote my journal &c. Arranged some prints &c. At a little after 2 came\r\nBaron Stockmar and stayed till near 3. The news of the poor King were\r\n_very_ bad! Drew. At a ¼ to 5 we drove out with Mary, Lehzen and dear\r\nlittle Edward, who was very funny and amusing. We came home at 6....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 18th June._—Got up at 8. After 9 we breakfasted. The children\r\nplayed in the room. At 10 we went down to prayers with dear Lehzen.\r\nThe Dean read and preached. The text was from the 2nd Chapter of St.\r\nJohn’s epistle, 5th verse. Drew and painted. Mary came up with Edward\r\nand stayed some time. Edward also remained alone with me for a ¼ of\r\nan hour. Painted. Saw Stockmar, who brought me a letter from Uncle\r\nLeopold!!—Painted. The poor King, they say, can live but a few hours\r\nmore!—Wrote my journal....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 19th June._—Got up at a ¼ p. 8. Read in _Les Veillées du\r\nChâteau_ while my hair was doing. After 9 we breakfasted. The children\r\nplayed in the room. At a ¼ p. 10 Mary, Lehzen, the children and I\r\ndrove out and came home at a little after 11. Read in _Les Veillées du\r\nChâteau_. Wrote my journal. Saw Dr. Clark. Saw Ernest Hohenlohe who\r\nbrought me the news from Windsor that the poor King was _so_ ill that\r\nhe could hardly live through the day. He likewise brought me a very\r\nkind message from the poor Queen, and also one from the poor old King.\r\nAfter 7 we dined. Saw the children before dinner for a minute. Stayed\r\nup till a ¼ p. 10. Read in W. Scott’s life while my hair was undoing.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 20th June._—I was awoke at 6 o’clock by Mamma, who told\r\nme that the Archbishop of Canterbury[276] and Lord Conyngham[277]\r\nwere here, and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my\r\nsitting-room (only in my dressing-gown), and _alone_, and saw them.\r\nLord Conyngham (the Lord Chamberlain) then acquainted me that my poor\r\nUncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes p. 2 this\r\nmorning, and consequently that I am _Queen_. Lord Conyngham knelt down\r\nand kissed my hand, at the same time delivering to me the official\r\nannouncement of the poor King’s demise. The Archbishop then told\r\nme that the Queen was desirous that he should come and tell me the\r\ndetails of the last moments of my poor, good Uncle; he said that he had\r\ndirected his mind to religion, and had died in a perfectly happy, quiet\r\nstate of mind, and was quite prepared for his death. He added that the\r\nKing’s sufferings at the last were not very great but that there was a\r\ngood deal of uneasiness. Lord Conyngham, whom I charged to express my\r\nfeelings of condolence and sorrow to the poor Queen, returned directly\r\nto Windsor. I then went to my room and dressed.\r\n\r\nSince it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall\r\ndo my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young and\r\nperhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am\r\nsure, that very few have more real good will and more real desire to do\r\nwhat is fit and right than I have.\r\n\r\nBreakfasted, during which time good faithful Stockmar[278] came and\r\ntalked to me. Wrote a letter to dear Uncle Leopold and a few words\r\nto dear good Feodore. Received a letter from Lord Melbourne[279] in\r\nwhich he said he would wait upon me at a little before 9. At 9 came\r\nLord Melbourne, whom I saw in my room, and of COURSE _quite_ ALONE as\r\nI shall _always_ do all my Ministers. He kissed my hand and I then\r\nacquainted him that it had long been my intention to retain him and the\r\nrest of the present Ministry at the head of affairs, and that it could\r\nnot be in better hands than his. He then again kissed my hand. He then\r\nread to me the Declaration which I was to read to the Council, which he\r\nwrote himself and which is a very fine one. I then talked with him some\r\nlittle longer time after which he left me. He was in full dress. I like\r\nhim very much and feel confidence in him. He is a very straightforward,\r\nhonest, clever and good man. I then wrote a letter to the Queen. At\r\nabout 11 Lord Melbourne came again to me and spoke to me upon various\r\nsubjects. At about ½ p. 11 I went downstairs and held a Council in\r\nthe red saloon. I went in of course quite alone, and remained seated\r\nthe whole time. My two Uncles, the Dukes of Cumberland[280] and\r\nSussex,[281] and Lord Melbourne conducted me. The declaration, the\r\nvarious forms, the swearing in of the Privy Councillors of which there\r\nwere a great number present, and the reception of some of the Lords of\r\nCouncil, previous to the Council in an adjacent room (likewise alone)\r\nI subjoin here. I was not at all nervous and had the satisfaction of\r\nhearing that people were satisfied with what I had done and how I had\r\ndone it. Receiving after this, Audiences of Lord Melbourne, Lord John\r\nRussell, Lord Albemarle (Master of the Horse), and the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, all in my room and alone. Saw Stockmar. Saw Clark, whom\r\nI named my Physician. Saw Mary. Wrote to Uncle Ernest. Saw Ernest\r\nHohenlohe who brought me a kind and very feeling letter from the poor\r\nQueen. I feel very much for her, and really feel that the poor good\r\nKing was always so kind personally to me, that I should be ungrateful\r\nwere I not to recollect it and feel grieved at his death. The poor\r\nQueen is wonderfully composed now, I hear. Wrote my journal. Took my\r\ndinner upstairs alone. Went downstairs. Saw Stockmar. At about 20\r\nminutes to 9 came Lord Melbourne and remained till near 10. I had a\r\nvery important and a very _comfortable_ conversation with him. Each\r\ntime I see him I feel more confidence in him; I find him very kind in\r\nhis manner too. Saw Stockmar. Went down and said good-night to Mamma\r\n&c. My _dear_ Lehzen will ALWAYS remain with me as my friend but will\r\ntake no situation about me, and I think she is right.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 21st June._—Got up at 8. At 9 we all breakfasted. At ½ p.\r\n9 I went to St. James’s in state. Mamma and Lady Mary Stopford were in\r\nmy carriage, and Lord Albemarle, Col. Cavendish, Lady Flora Hastings,\r\nand Col. Harcourt in the others.... After the Proclamation Mamma and\r\nthe ladies repaired to an adjoining room and left me in the Closet. I\r\ngave audiences to Lord Melbourne (a long one), the Earl Marshal (Duke\r\nof Norfolk), and Garter King at Arms (Sir John Woods), relative to the\r\nfuneral of my poor Uncle the late King; to Lord Albemarle, Lord Hill,\r\nLord Melbourne (again for some time), and the Lord President (Lord\r\nLansdowne). I then held a Privy Council in the Throne Room. It was\r\nnot fully attended and was not the third part so full as it had been\r\non the preceding day. The Marquis of Anglesey,[282] the Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer (Mr. Spring Rice),[283] Lords Wharncliffe,[284]\r\nAshburton,[285] and Wynford,[286] Sir Hussey Vivian,[287] and some\r\nJudges were sworn in as Privy Councillors and kissed hands. After\r\nthe Council I gave audiences to Lord Melbourne, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and all the Bishops except one or two, the Lord Chancellor\r\nand all the Judges; Sir Hussey Vivian (Master General of the Ordnance),\r\nLord John Russell, Lord Glenelg,[288] Mr. Poulett Thomson,[289] Lord\r\nHowick,[290] Lord Palmerston, and Lord Minto.[291] I then returned\r\nhome at 1. I must say it was quite like a dream and a sad one, when\r\nI was seated in the Closet where but barely 5 weeks ago I beheld for\r\nthe last time my poor Uncle. At 2 came Stockmar till after 3. Wrote to\r\nthe Duchess of Gloucester and Princess Augusta.[292] Walked. Saw the\r\nDuke of Norfolk. Wrote my journal. At 7 we dined. At 10 minutes to 9\r\ncame Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 10. I had an agreeable and\r\nimportant and satisfactory conversation with him. Stayed up till a ¼ p.\r\n10. Lord Hill told me a curious coincidence which is that the 21st of\r\nJune, the day on which I was proclaimed, is likewise the anniversary of\r\nthe Battle of Vittoria!\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 22nd June._—Got up after 8. After 9 we breakfasted. The\r\nchildren played in the room. At a ¼ p. 10 I walked out with Mary,\r\nLehzen, Charles and Edward, and came home at 20 minutes to 11. Wrote\r\nto the Duchess of Gloucester. Wrote my journal. At 12 came the Judge\r\nAdvocate General (Mr. Cutlar Ferguson)[293] to submit various sentences\r\nof Court Martial to me. He is a very clever intelligent man and\r\nexplained all the cases very clearly to me. I, of _course_, saw him\r\nalone....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 23rd June._—Got up at ½ p. 8. After 9 we breakfasted. The\r\nchildren played in the room. I do not mention the VERY _frequent_\r\ncommunications I have with Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell,[294]\r\n&c., &c., &c., as also the other official letters I have to write and\r\nreceive, for want of time and space. Saw good Stockmar, who remained\r\nin my room for some time. Saw the Marquis of Conyngham, then Lord\r\nHill, who explained to me finally about the Court Martials, then Sir\r\nHenry Wheatley[295] and Col. Wood, who as Executors of the late\r\nKing, brought me his Will. At ½ p. 12 arrived Lady Catherine[296]\r\nwho remained in one of my sitting-rooms till now and still remains\r\n(4 o’clock) answering letters, &c., &c. Saw the Duke of Argyll\r\n(Lord Steward) at ½ p. 2. I wrote a letter to the Marchioness of\r\nTavistock[297] while Stockmar was here, asking her to become one of\r\nmy Ladies of the Bedchamber. Lay down. Wrote to the Marchioness of\r\nLansdowne,[298] asking her to become my first Lady of the Bedchamber.\r\nAt ½ p. 5 I drove out with Mary and Lehzen, and came home at ½ p.\r\n6. After 7 we all dined. I had a GREAT deal of business to do after\r\ndinner. Saw Stockmar. Received a very kind letter from Lady Lansdowne\r\naccepting the situation. After dinner came Princess Sophia. Stayed up\r\ntill after 10.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 24th June._—Got up after 8. At ½ p. 9 we all breakfasted.\r\nThe children played in the room. Wrote a letter to the Duke of Sussex,\r\nand to good Späth. At 11 came Lord Melbourne and stayed till 12. He is\r\na very honest, good and kind-hearted, as well as very clever man. He\r\ntold me that Lady Tavistock had accepted the situation. And he read\r\nto me the answer which I was to give to the address from the House of\r\nLords. He told me that the Duke of Argyll would bring the Address but\r\nwould not read it; and consequently I was not to read mine. Wrote. At\r\n12 came Lady Catherine Jenkinson and remained in my room till near 3.\r\nSaw Stockmar at a little after 12. Saw Sir Frederick Wetherall.[299]\r\nSaw Lord John Russell. _Wrote._—I really have immensely to do; I\r\nreceive so many communications from my Ministers but I like it very\r\nmuch....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 25th June._—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. The\r\nchildren played in the room. At 10 I went down to prayers with Mamma,\r\nMary, Lehzen, and Charles. The service was read by the Dean who\r\nwas much affected when he read the prayers in which my name is now\r\nmentioned in the place of my poor Uncle, the late King. He preached a\r\nvery good and appropriate sermon; the text of which was from the 3rd\r\nchapter of the Epistle General of St. Peter, 13th and 14th verses....\r\nAt a few minutes p. 12 came the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Spring\r\nRice) and stayed some time. He is a very clever and good man.... At\r\nabout 20 minutes p. 4 came Lord Melbourne till 20 minutes p. 5. He is a\r\ngood, honest, kind-hearted and clever man, and I like to talk to him....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 26th June._—Got up at 8. Before 9 we breakfasted. At ½ p.\r\n9 went with Mamma to Windsor. I was attended by Lady Tavistock and\r\nColonel Cavendish,[300] and Mamma by Lady Flora Hastings. We arrived\r\nat the Castle, which looked very mournful and melancholy with the flag\r\nhalf mast high, at about a ¼ p. 11. We went instantly to the poor\r\nQueen’s apartments.[301] She received me _most kindly_ but was at first\r\nmuch affected. She however soon regained her self-possession and was\r\nwonderfully calm and composed. She gave us many painfully interesting\r\ndetails of the illness and last moments of my poor Uncle the late\r\nKing. He bore his dreadful sufferings with the most exemplary patience\r\nand always thanked Heaven when these sufferings were but slightly and\r\nmomentarily alleviated. He was in the happiest state of mind possible\r\nand his death was worthy his high station. He felt so composed and\r\nseemed to find so much consolation in Religion. The Queen is really a\r\nmost estimable and excellent person and she bears the prospect of the\r\ngreat change she must soon go through in leaving Windsor and changing\r\nher position in a most admirable, strong and high-minded manner. I do\r\nnot think her looking ill and the widow’s cap and weeds rather become\r\nher. I saw Ernest Hohenlohe, Gustav and Prince Ernest of Hesse P.B. We\r\nleft Windsor at ½ p. 12. It gave me a very painful feeling to think\r\nthat the remains of my poor Uncle were in the Castle. Altogether the\r\nwhole rather upset me. We came at ½ p. 2. I forgot to say that Lord\r\nMelbourne told me that the Duchess of Sutherland[302] has accepted the\r\noffice of Mistress of the Robes, and the Countess of Charlemont[303]\r\nof one of my ladies of the Bedchamber. At ½ p. 2 came the Duchess of\r\nSutherland, whom I am delighted to have as my Mistress of the Robes;\r\nshe was looking so handsome and nice. At about 10 minutes to 4 came\r\nLord Melbourne and stayed till ½ p. 4. I talked with him as usual on\r\nPolitical affairs, about my Household, and various other _Confidential_\r\naffairs....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.M. Queen Adelaide_\r\n\r\n  _from a portrait by Sir W. Ross_]\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 27th June._—Got up at ½ p. 8. At a ¼ to 10 we breakfasted.\r\nThe children played in the room. Wrote my journal. At about 20 minutes\r\np. 11 came Lord Melbourne and stayed till ½ p. 12. At a little after\r\n½ p. 12 came Lord Palmerston and stayed till a little p. 1. He is a\r\nclever and agreeable man. Saw Lord John Russell and Lord Melbourne\r\nfor a minute. At a few minutes p. 2 I went down into the saloon with\r\nLady Lansdowne; Col. Cavendish, the Vice-Chamberlain (Lord Charles\r\nFitzroy),[304] and the Comptroller of the Household (Mr. Byng)[305]\r\nwere in waiting. Lord Melbourne then came in and announced that the\r\nAddresses from the House of Commons were ready to come in. They were\r\nread by Lord John Russell and I read an answer to both. Lord Melbourne\r\nstood on my left hand and Lady Lansdowne behind me. Most of the Privy\r\nCouncillors of the House of Commons were present. After this Lord\r\nPalmerston brought in the Earl of Durham,[306] who is just returned\r\nfrom St. Petersburg. I conferred on him the Grand Cross of the Bath.\r\nI knighted him with the Sword of State which is so enormously heavy\r\nthat Lord Melbourne was obliged to hold it for me, and I only inclined\r\nit. I then put the ribbon over his shoulder. After this the foreign\r\nAmbassadors and Ministers were severally introduced to me by Lord\r\nPalmerston. I then went upstairs and gave audiences to the Earl of\r\nMulgrave[307] and to the Earl of Durham. The latter gave a long\r\naccount of Russia. Did various things. Saw Stockmar. As I did not feel\r\nwell I did not come down to dinner, but dined upstairs. I went down\r\nafter dinner. Stayed up till 10. I wore the blue Ribbon and Star of the\r\nGarter in the afternoon....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 1st July._—Got up after 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. Edward\r\nplayed in the room only, Ernest not being good. Wrote. I repeat what I\r\nsaid before that I have _so many_ communications from the Ministers,\r\nand from me to them, and I get so many papers to sign _every_ day, that\r\nI have always a _very great_ deal to do; but for want of time and space\r\nI do not write these things down. I _delight_ in this work. Saw Lord\r\nMelbourne. At about ½ p. 11 or a ¼ to 12 came Mr. Spring Rice. Saw Lord\r\nJohn Russell. Wrote &c. At 2 came Sir Henry Wheatley to kiss hands upon\r\nbeing appointed my Privy Purse. At a little after 2 I saw Stockmar for\r\na minute. At 10 minutes p. 2 came Lord Palmerston and stayed till 6\r\nminutes p. 3. We talked about Russia and Turkey a good deal &c. He is\r\nvery agreeable, and clear in what he says. Saw Stockmar for some time\r\nafterwards. Wrote my journal. I forgot to mention that I received a\r\nletter from dearest Aunt Louise in the morning. The children played in\r\nmy room for a little while. At ½ past 5 I drove out with Mamma and dear\r\nLehzen and came home at 20 minutes to 7. At ½ p. 7 we dined. Stayed up\r\ntill a ¼ p. 10.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 2nd July._—Got up at ½ p. 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. The\r\nchildren played in the room. At 10 I went to prayers with Mamma, Mary,\r\nand dear Lehzen. The service was performed by the Dean who gave us also\r\na very good sermon. The text was from the 6th chapter of St. Matthew,\r\n9th and 10th verses. Wrote, signed, &c. Wrote to dear Feodore. Received\r\na kind long letter from dear Uncle Leopold. At 10 minutes to 2 came\r\nLord Melbourne till a few minutes p. 3. Talked with him about many\r\nimportant things. He is indeed a most truly honest, straightforward\r\nand noble-minded man and I esteem myself _most_ fortunate to have such\r\na man at the head of the Government; a man in whom I can safely place\r\nconfidence. There are not _many_ like him in this world of deceit!\r\nMary and the children came up for a few minutes. At a little before 4\r\ncame Stockmar and stayed till a little before 5. He is a most honest,\r\nexcellent, disinterested and straightforward man, and most exceedingly\r\nattached and devoted to me; he has been, and is, of the greatest use to\r\nme....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 8th July._—Got up at a little after 8. At ½ p. 9 we\r\nbreakfasted. The children played in the room. Signed, &c. Sat to Mr.\r\nLane for a few minutes. Wrote to the poor Queen from whom I received\r\na _very_ kind letter last night; &c., &c. Saw good Stockmar for some\r\ntime. Saw Lord John Russell. At a few minutes p. 12 came my good\r\nand honest friend Lord Melbourne and stayed till 20 minutes p. 1.\r\nTalked over many important things. Saw Mr. Spring Rice.... I forgot\r\nto say that Lord Melbourne wrote me word yesterday evening that Lady\r\nMulgrave[308] I was very desirous to become one of my Ladies of the\r\nBedchamber, and I told Lord Melbourne this morning that I would make\r\nher one of my ladies. Wrote to Lady Lyttelton[309] to ask her to become\r\none of my ladies of the Bedchamber (in a _year_), for she is still in\r\nwidow’s weeds.... At a ¼ p. 7 I, Mamma, Mary and Lehzen dined, Charles\r\nhaving gone at 5 o’clock to Windsor to attend the funeral of my poor\r\nUncle, the late King. It was very very sad to hear from ½ p. 8 till\r\nnearly 10 o’clock, those dreadful minute guns! Alas! my poor Uncle, he\r\nnow reposes in quiet and peace! As Lord Melbourne said to me, the first\r\nmorning when I became Queen, that the poor King “had his faults as we\r\nall have, but that he possessed many valuable qualities.” I have heard\r\nfrom all sides that he was really very fond of me, and I shall _ever_\r\nretain a grateful sense of his kindness to me and shall never forget\r\nhim. Life is short and uncertain, and I am determined to employ my time\r\nwell, so that when I am called away from this world my end may be a\r\npeaceful and a happy one!...\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 11th July._—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. The\r\nchildren played in the room. At a little after 10, sat to Mr. Lane for\r\na few minutes. Saw Col. Cavendish. Wrote, &c., &c. At ½ p. 11. came\r\nStockmar who brought me the unwelcome news of poor Lord Melbourne’s\r\ncontinued indisposition and total incapability of coming to see me\r\nto-day, which I regret for two reasons: first because I have many\r\nthings to ask him, 2ndly because I like very much to talk to him, as he\r\nis so quiet in what he says....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 12th July._—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. Did\r\nvarious things. At ½ p. 10 came Stockmar and stayed for some time. At\r\n½ p. 11 came Lord Melbourne and stayed till ½ p. 12. He looked and\r\nsaid he was better, but not quite well. Dressed. At a little before\r\n2 I went with Mamma and the Duchess of Sutherland (in my carriage),\r\nCharles and Mary and Lady Tavistock and Lord Albemarle (in the next\r\ncarriage), and Lady Mary Stopford and Colonel Cavendish in another. I\r\nwas in full dress and wore the Order of the Bath. I went in state with\r\na large escort. I was received at the door by the Lord Chamberlain,\r\nthe Lord Steward, &c., &c., and was by them conducted into the Closet,\r\nwhere some people kissed hands. I then went into the Throne Room, Lord\r\nConyngham handing me in, and a Page of Honour (Master Ellice) bearing\r\nmy train. I sat on the Throne. Mamma and Mary stood on the steps of the\r\nThrone on one side, and the Duchess of Sutherland and Lady Tavistock\r\nstood near me (behind). I then received the two Addresses (of which, as\r\nalso of all the other things, I subjoin an account), and read Answers\r\nto both. I then returned to the Closet; and went into another room to\r\nput on the Mantle of the Bath[310] (of crimson satin lined with white\r\nsilk); I then saw Lord Melbourne in the Closet for a few minutes.\r\nAfter this I went again into the Throne-room, and seated myself on\r\nthe Throne. I then conferred the Order of the Bath (_not sitting_ of\r\ncourse) upon Prince Esterhazy. After this I again went into the Closet.\r\nMamma, Mary, Charles and Lady Mary Stopford then went home; it was 3\r\no’clock. I then took off my Mantle. Received two Deputations from the\r\nSheriffs &c., to ask when I would receive two more Addresses from the\r\nCity. My two Ladies attended me, but after this they went into another\r\nroom, where they remained till I went. I then gave an Audience to Lord\r\nLansdowne. After this I held a Privy Council. After the Council I gave\r\naudiences to the Earl of Yarborough[311] (who thanked me very much for\r\nhaving appointed his amiable daughter, Lady Charlotte Copley, one of my\r\nBedchamber Women); to Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell, Lord Mulgrave,\r\nand Lord Hill. I then left the Palace, the Duchess of Sutherland (who\r\nlooked lovely, as she always does), and Lady Tavistock, going with me\r\nin my carriage, in the same way as I came, and got home at a ¼ to 5....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 13th July._—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. It\r\nwas the _last time_ that I slept in this poor old Palace,[312] as I\r\ngo into Buckingham Palace today. Though I rejoice to _go_ into B.P.\r\nfor many reasons, it is not without feelings of regret that I shall\r\nbid adieu _for ever_ (that is to say _for ever_ as a DWELLING), to\r\nthis my birth-place, where I have been born and bred, and to which\r\nI am really attached! I have seen my dear sister married here, I\r\nhave seen many of my dear relations here, I have had pleasant balls\r\nand _delicious_ concerts here, my present rooms upstairs are really\r\nvery pleasant, comfortable and pretty, and _enfin_ I like this poor\r\nPalace. I have held my first Council here too! I have gone through\r\npainful and disagreeable scenes here, ’tis true, but still I am fond\r\nof the poor old Palace. Lord Melbourne told me yesterday that the\r\nHon. Miss Dillon[313] (to whom I had offered it), has accepted the\r\nsituation of Maid of Honour. I always saw Lord Melbourne and also\r\nStockmar in my Private Sitting-room (the first of the three), but all\r\nthe other Ministers &c. &c. I saw in the further room (the farthest\r\nof the 3). Did various things. Saw Stockmar for some time. The poor\r\nrooms look so sad and deserted, everything being taken away. Wrote my\r\njournal. At a little after 2 I went with Mamma and Lady Lansdowne (in\r\nmy carriage), Lehzen, and Col. Cavendish (in the next) to Buckingham\r\nPalace. I am much pleased with my rooms.[314] They are high, pleasant\r\nand cheerful. Arranged things. At a little after 4 Lady Lansdowne\r\nbrought Miss Pitt[315] and Miss Spring Rice[316] (the two Maids of\r\nHonour in Waiting, and who lodge here) to kiss hands. Miss Pitt is\r\na _very_ pretty, elegant, nice girl, and Miss Spring Rice is a nice,\r\nclever-looking girl. Saw Stockmar. Lady Lansdowne afterwards brought\r\nMiss Davys to kiss hands, who is a very nice girl (though not at all\r\npretty). I then walked round the garden (which is large and very\r\npretty) with Mamma. Dear _Dashy_ was quite happy in it....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.R.H. Princess Victoria_\r\n\r\n  _from a portrait by R. J. Lane 1829._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  The break between the life of Princess Victoria and that of the\r\n  young Queen was now complete. Changes came innumerable and fast.\r\n  Her Household was formed, and it reflected the complexion of Lord\r\n  Melbourne’s Ministry, which had been established in power after\r\n  the General Election by a majority of thirty-eight. The Queen left\r\n  the home of her childhood for ever. She was the first Sovereign to\r\n  occupy Buckingham Palace. The building had been begun by George\r\n  IV., and although finished by William IV., had never been prepared\r\n  for occupation. It remained an inconvenient house until it was\r\n  added to in after-years by Prince Albert. Although Baron Stockmar,\r\n  the old medical attendant of King Leopold, who had been domiciled\r\n  in England by command of his master, was reputed to be acting as\r\n  the Queen’s Private Secretary, that post was in reality occupied\r\n  by Lord Melbourne himself. He was both Private Secretary and Tutor\r\n  to the young Queen at this stage of her career. Her political\r\n  education proceeded fast, and she learned with avidity. Her good\r\n  sense and composure were indeed remarkable. It was noted by all\r\n  that she was considerate and thoughtful to her elderly relatives,\r\n  and to the friends and servants of her predecessor. Her girlish\r\n  charm was attractive to those who were privileged to be about her,\r\n  and its influence over her subjects was soon widespread. When\r\n  within a month of her accession she appeared in the House of Lords\r\n  to dissolve Parliament in accordance with the Law, she read her\r\n  Speech, said Fanny Kemble, who was present, with splendid effect.\r\n  This well-qualified judge observed that the Queen’s voice was\r\n  exquisite, that her enunciation was as perfect as the intonation\r\n  was melodious, and that it was impossible to hear more excellent\r\n  utterance than that of the Queen’s English by the English Queen.\r\n\r\n  It is difficult always to remember that the writer of these\r\n  Journals was at this epoch little more than a child, that she\r\n  had been educated almost exclusively by women, and that she had\r\n  lived on the whole a very solitary life, hampered by the unhappy\r\n  conditions attached to a girl who possesses no brothers and\r\n  sisters, and is in addition heir to a Throne. She was now suddenly\r\n  thrown almost entirely among men, grave and old, all of whom were\r\n  engaged in administering the complicated affairs of that Kingdom of\r\n  which she was Queen. It is difficult to imagine a greater contrast.\r\n  How rapidly the youthful Princess became a woman under the pressure\r\n  of these extraordinary circumstances becomes clear from her\r\n  Journals. They indicate a curious maturity, through which, however,\r\n  there peeps occasionally the face and figure of a child.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                                 1837\r\n\r\n_Friday, 14th July._—Got up after 8. At ½ p. 9 I, Mamma, Lehzen, and\r\nLady Flora breakfasted upstairs. Wrote, signed, &c. Saw Sir F. Watson,\r\nCol. Cavendish, Sir H. Wheatley, Stockmar. At a little after 11 saw\r\nSir John Hobhouse[317] for a little while. He is a very clever and\r\nagreeable man. I saw him (where I shall see all the Ministers &c.) in\r\nthe small room[318] which opens into my sitting-room. Wrote my journal.\r\nDressed. At a few minutes to 2 I went with Mamma and the Duchess of\r\nSutherland (in my carriage), Lady Charlemont and Lord Albemarle (in the\r\nnext carriage), and Charles, Mary, and Lady Flora (in the other) to St.\r\nJames’s. I was in full dress and wore the blue ribbon and star of the\r\nGarter, and the Garter round my arm. I was received in the same way as\r\nbefore. I went into the Throne Room, sat on the Throne, and received\r\nthree Addresses in the same way as on Friday. Two of the Addresses\r\nwere _very fully_ attended and the room became intensely hot. I then\r\nput on the Mantle and Collar of the Garter (of dark blue velvet lined\r\nwith white silk). Gave a few minutes audience to Lord Melbourne. I then\r\nwent into the Throne Room (did not sit on the Throne), held a Chapter\r\nof the Garter and conferred that Order on Charles. Mamma, Charles and\r\nMary went away immediately after this, but I remained and gave a long\r\naudience to Lord Melbourne, who read to me the Speech which I am to\r\ndeliver when I prorogue Parliament. He reads so well and with _so_ much\r\ngood feeling. I am sorry to see him still looking ill. I then saw the\r\nDuke of Devonshire.[319] Came home with my two Ladies at ½ p. 4.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 15th July._—At a few minutes p. 2 I went into one of the\r\nlarge drawing-rooms and held a Cabinet Council, at which were present\r\nall the Ministers. The Council lasted but a very short while. I then\r\nwent into my Closet and received Lord Melbourne there. He stayed with\r\nme till 20 minutes to 4. He seemed and said he was better. He has\r\nsuch an honest, frank, and yet gentle manner. He talks so quietly.\r\nI always feel peculiarly satisfied when I have talked with him. I\r\nhave _great_ confidence in him. Saw the Duke of Argyll[320] and Lord\r\nAlbemarle. At 10 minutes to 4 came Lord Palmerston and stayed about\r\n20 minutes. He is a very clever and agreeable man. I then saw Lord\r\nGlenelg for a short while. Played and sang. Wrote my journal. At a ¼\r\nto 8 I dined. Mamma being unwell did not come to dinner. Besides the\r\npeople in the House which made with me 6,—Charles, Mary, the Duke of\r\nSussex, Princess Sophia, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl and Countess\r\nof Mulgrave, the Earl and Countess of Durham, the Earl of Liverpool\r\nand the Ladies Jenkinson, the Lord and the Equerry in Waiting, and\r\nLord John Churchill[321] dined here. I sat between Uncle Sussex and\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk. After dinner, at 10 o’clock came _Thalberg_,[322]\r\nthe most famous pianist in the world! He played four things, all by\r\nheart. They were all Fantasias by him; (1) on _The Preghiera of Mosé_,\r\n(2) on “God save the King” and “Rule Britannia,” (3) on _Norma_, (4)\r\non _Les Huguenots_. _Never, never_ did I hear anything at all like\r\nhim! He combines the most _exquisite_, _delicate_ and touching feeling\r\nwith the most wonderful and powerful execution! He is unique and I am\r\nquite in ecstasies and raptures with him. I sat quite near the piano\r\nand it is quite extraordinary to watch his hands, which are large,\r\nbut fine and graceful. He draws tones and sounds from the piano which\r\nno one else can do. He is _unique_. He is quite young, about 25,\r\nsmall, delicate-looking, a very pleasing countenance, and extremely\r\ngentlemanlike. He is modest to a degree and very agreeable to talk to.\r\nJ’étais en extase!...\r\n\r\n_Monday, 17th July._—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. Saw Sir\r\nF. Watson and Col. Cavendish. Saw Stockmar. At ½ p. 1 I went in state\r\nto the House of Lords, with the Duchess of Sutherland and the Master\r\nof the Horse in my carriage, and Lady Lansdowne and Lady Mulgrave in\r\nanother. Had I time I would give a very minute account of the whole,\r\nbut as I have _very_ little, I will only say what I feel I wish\r\nparticularly to name. I went first to the Robing-room, but as there\r\nwere so many people there I went to a Dressing-room where I put on\r\nthe Robe which is enormously heavy. After this I entered the House of\r\nLords preceded by all the Officers of State and Lord Melbourne bearing\r\nthe Sword of State walking just before me. He stood quite close to me\r\non the left-hand of the Throne, and I feel always a satisfaction to\r\nhave him near me on such occasions, as he is such an honest, good,\r\nkind-hearted man and is my _friend_, I know it. The Lord Chancellor\r\nstood on my left. The house was very full and I felt somewhat (but very\r\nlittle) nervous before I read my speech, but it did very well, and I\r\nwas happy to hear people were satisfied. I then unrobed in the Library\r\nand came home as I went, at 20 minutes p. 3....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 19th July._—Got up at ½ p. 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. Saw\r\nSir F. Watson, Col. Cavendish, and Stockmar. At 20 minutes p. 11 came\r\nLord Melbourne till a ¼ p. 12. Talked over many things. Dressed. At a\r\n¼ p. 1 I went with the Duchess of Sutherland and Lady Portman in my\r\ncarriage, to St. James’s. I received two addresses on the Throne and\r\nread answers to them. After that Col. Buckley[323] and Col. Wemyss\r\nkissed hands on being appointed Equerries, as also the Hon. William\r\nCowper (nephew to Lord Melbourne) as Groom in Waiting. Also many\r\nothers. I gave audiences to various foreign Ambassadors, amongst which\r\nwere Count Orloff,[324] sent by the Emperor of Russia to compliment me.\r\nHe presented me with a letter from the Empress of Russia accompanied\r\nby the Order of St. Catherine all set in diamonds. (I, of course,\r\nas I generally do every evening, wore the Garter.) The Levee began\r\nimmediately after this and lasted till ½ p. 4 without one minute’s\r\ninterruption. I had my hand kissed nearly _3000_ times! I then held a\r\nCouncil, at which were present almost all the Ministers. After this I\r\nsaw Lord Melbourne for a little while, and then Lord Palmerston....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 2nd August._— ... After dinner I sat on the sofa with\r\nthe pretty amiable little Countess C. Pozzo di Borgo and Lady\r\nSalisbury,[325] and Count Pozzo di Borgo and Prince Auersperg[326]\r\nsat near us. Prince Auersperg is a very nice, good-looking young\r\nman, very quiet, good-humoured and retiring. Lady Seymour is\r\ncertainly _exceedingly_ beautiful; she has not the splendid eyes and\r\nfine expression of her sister Mrs. Norton, but altogether she is\r\nhandsomest, and there is a sweetness and gentleness about her which\r\nneither Mrs. Norton nor Mrs. Blackwood have.[327] Stayed up till ½ p.\r\n10....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 9th August._—Got up at a little after 8 and breakfasted at\r\n½ p. 9. Saw Sir Frederic Watson and Col. Buckley. Began a letter to\r\ndear Uncle Leopold. Saw Stockmar. Finished my letter to Uncle Leopold\r\nand wrote my journal. At 7 minutes to 12 came Lord Melbourne and stayed\r\ntill a ¼ to 2. Talked over many serious subjects. I’m somewhat anxious\r\nabout the Elections but I trust in Heaven that we shall have a Majority\r\nfor us, and that the present Government may remain firm for _long_.\r\nLord Melbourne spoke so candidly, so disinterestedly, and so calmly\r\nabout all this. Wrote my journal. Drew. At 3 came the Queen Adelaide’s\r\nsister, Ida, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar,[328] with 3 of her children. Her\r\n2nd son, Edward, 14 years old, who was born here[329] and consequently\r\nis my subject, and her little girls, Anna and Amalie, 9 and 7 years\r\nold. Edward is a very nice boy. I stayed some time with them and then\r\nwent down and drew in my room while Mamma took them into the garden....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 15th August._—Got up at ½ p. 8, and breakfasted in my own\r\nroom at a ¼ to 10. Put on my habit and went with dear Lehzen, Miss\r\nCavendish,[330] Lord Albemarle, Col. Cavendish, Col. Buckley and\r\nStockmar, to the Mews, which are in the garden. The Riding-house is\r\nvery large. Sir George Quentin and Mr. Fozard (who has a situation in\r\nmy Stables) &c., were there. I had not ridden for 2 years! I first\r\nrode a bay horse, a delightful one called Ottoman, and cantered about\r\na good while. I then tried for a minute another horse which I did not\r\nlike so well. I then remounted Ottoman. After him I mounted a beautiful\r\nand very powerful but delightful grey horse, a Hanoverian, called\r\nFearon. Miss Cavendish rode also the whole time; she rides very nicely.\r\nCame home at 20 minutes to 12. Mamma came into the School when I had\r\nbeen riding a little while....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 16th August._—Got up at ½ p. 8, and breakfasted before 10\r\nin my own room. At ½ p. 10 I went to the Riding House with Mamma, Miss\r\nCocks,[331] Miss Cavendish, dearest Lehzen, Col. Cavendish, and Col.\r\nBuckley. I rode 1st a horse called Rosa (not my poor little Rosa), then\r\nMonarch, rather a nice horse, then Emma, not a bad horse, then Fearon,\r\nmy favourite, and lastly Emperor, a _very_ nice chestnut horse. Mamma\r\nand my Maids of Honour also rode. Came home at 12. At 7 minutes past 1\r\ncame Lord Melbourne and stayed till a ¼ to 3....\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE, _Tuesday, 22nd August_.—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and\r\nbreakfasted at 10. Saw Col. Buckley. Wrote to the Grand Duchess of\r\nOldenbourg.[332] Arranged various things. At 20 minutes to 12 came my\r\nkind, good friend Lord Melbourne and stayed till ½ p. 1. I am quite\r\nsorry to think I shall not see him till next Monday, when he comes down\r\nto me at Windsor, for I am so fond of him, and his conversations do\r\nme much good; he is such a thoroughly straightforward, disinterested,\r\nexcellent and kindhearted man. He goes down to Brocket Hall tonight\r\nwith his sister Lady Cowper, Lady Fanny, and Mr. Cowper (my Groom), and\r\nthe younger brother, Spencer Cowper. I hope the country air and rest\r\nwill do him good. Saw Sir H. Wheatley, and Stockmar. Wrote my journal.\r\nSaw Sir F. Wetherall,[333] and Prince Ernest of Hesse P.B.[334] At ½\r\np. 2 I went with Mamma, Lady Charlotte Copley, and Lady Flora in my\r\ncarriage; dear Lehzen, Miss Cocks, Miss Cavendish, and Col. Buckley\r\ngoing in the other, to Windsor Castle, where I arrived at ½ p. 5. I had\r\nescort of Lancers. All along the road the people were very loyal and\r\ncivil, and my poor native place, Kensington, particularly so. When we\r\nreached the Long Walk at Windsor a larger escort of the 1st Life Guards\r\nmet me; the Walk was thronged with people, where a dinner was given to\r\nthem in honour of my arrival. The people were remarkably friendly and\r\ncivil. Unfortunately it began to rain before we reached the Long Walk.\r\nWindsor looked somewhat gloomy and I cannot help feeling as though _I_\r\nwas not the Mistress of the House and as if I was to see the poor King\r\nand Queen. There is sadness about the whole which I must say I feel.\r\nLady Tavistock, who is in waiting for 4 weeks, Lord Conyngham, and the\r\nLord Steward received me at the door. I inhabit the Queen’s rooms,\r\nthough not in the same way as she did. At ½ p. 7 we dined....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 26th August._—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and at 10 we breakfasted\r\nwith all the Ladies including Lady Charlemont and Lady Barham. To-day\r\nis my _dearest_ cousin Albert’s 18th birthday, and I pray Heaven to\r\npour its choicest blessings on his beloved head! Took leave of Lady\r\nBarham as both she and he go away....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 27th August._— ... At ½ p. 2 we all went into the drawing-room\r\nand received the King of Würtemburg[335] who came to take leave. He\r\nwas accompanied by Count Mandelsloh, Baron Spitzemberg, and General\r\nFleischmann. He took luncheon with us and the whole party including\r\nLord Glenelg, whom I asked to stay another night. By some mistake Lord\r\nTavistock did not come to luncheon. I sat between the King and Count\r\nMandelsloh. After luncheon I showed the King the State Rooms &c. and at\r\n4 he took leave and went away. He leaves England on Tuesday and is much\r\npleased with what he has seen....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 28th August._— ... I hope Lord Melbourne will stay here for\r\nsome days. At 4 I rode out with Mamma, Lady Charlotte Copley, Lady\r\nMary Stopford (who got into the carriage and drove), Miss Cavendish,\r\nMiss Cocks, Lord Melbourne, Lord Conyngham, Lord Torrington,[336]\r\nCol. Cavendish, Col. Buckley, and Mr. Rich. As Sir George Quentin\r\nand Mr. Fozard _always_ ride out with us, I shall not mention them\r\nany more. Lady Tavistock and Lehzen followed in a pony carriage. I\r\nrode Duchess, a nice bay horse, but rather too quiet and not near so\r\npleasant as Monarch. Mamma rode Barbara. Lord Melbourne rode his own\r\nhorse, a very fine black mare which came down from London this day. It\r\nwas a very pleasant ride and we came home at a ¼ p. 6.... _Tuesday,\r\n29th August._—Got up at ½ p. 8 and at ½ p. 9 we breakfasted with all\r\nthe ladies. Wrote my journal. At ½ p. 11 or rather at a ¼ to 12 came\r\nLord Melbourne and stayed till a ¼ to 2. At 3 I walked over the House\r\nwith Mamma and most of the ladies, and Lord Conyngham, Col. Buckley,\r\nCol. Cavendish, &c. The offices are not good. We then walked a little\r\nwhile on the Terrace. Played on the piano or rather more sang with\r\nMamma. At 7 o’clock arrived my _dearest most beloved_ Uncle Leopold\r\nand my _dearest most beloved_ Aunt Louise. They _are both_, and _look\r\nboth_, _very well_; dearest Aunt Louise is looking so well and is grown\r\n_quite_ fat. I and Mamma as well as my whole court were all at the door\r\nto receive them. It is an inexpressible _happiness_ and _joy_ to me,\r\nto have these dearest beloved relations with me and in _my own_ house.\r\nI took them to their rooms, and then hastened to dress for dinner. At\r\n8 we dined.... Dearest Aunt Louise went in first with Lord Lansdowne,\r\nthen I with dear Uncle, and Mamma with M. Van de Weyer. I sat between\r\ndear Uncle and my good Lord Melbourne; two delightful neighbours. Dear\r\nAunt Louise sat opposite. After dinner I sat on the sofa with dearest\r\nAunt Louise, who is really _an angel_, and Lord Melbourne sat near me.\r\nUncle talked with Lord Palmerston. It was a most delightful evening....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 1st September._— ... I rode Monarch who went delightfully,\r\nand Aunt Louise and Mamma the same horses as the preceding day. The\r\nweather looked lowering when we went out. When we were about the middle\r\nof Queen Anne’s Walk, there came a most unexpected and violent flash of\r\nlightning which was followed instantaneously by a tremendous clap of\r\nthunder. My horse jumped a little, but very little, but Aunt Louise’s\r\nbeing very much alarmed by the thunder, _ran away, full gallop_, to our\r\ngreat horror, and poor dear Aunt lost her hat; thank God! the horse\r\nstopped after 100 yards at the foot of a hill and was led back. We had\r\nmeanwhile got into a close carriage with the three ladies, and dear\r\nAunt Louise who was not the _least_ frightened but only “quite ashamed”\r\nas she said, also got in, and we drove home (all six) in a tremendous\r\nthunderstorm and deluge of rain. We reached home in perfect safety at 5\r\no’clock....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 8th September._—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and at a little before 10\r\nI breakfasted with dearest Uncle Leopold, dearest Aunt Louise, Mamma\r\nand the Duke of Sussex. Talked with Uncle Leopold for some time. How I\r\nwish I had time to take _minutes_ of the very interesting and highly\r\nimportant conversations I have with my Uncle and with Lord Melbourne;\r\nthe sound observations they make, and the impartial advice they give\r\nme would make a most interesting book. At 11 Lord Melbourne came to\r\nme and stayed with me till 20 minutes to 1. He is a most excellent,\r\nkindhearted, honest and upright man, and my beloved Uncle is delighted\r\nwith him, which makes me very happy, as I am so fond of Lord Melbourne,\r\nand he _has been_ and _is such_ a _kind friend_ to me. Uncle and he\r\nperfectly agree in Politics too, which are the _best_ there _are_. Lord\r\nMelbourne goes to town, I’m sorry to say, today, but will be back here\r\ntomorrow. Saw dearest Uncle Leopold. Talked with him. Signed. Wrote my\r\njournal....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 12th September._— ... After dinner I sat part of the evening\r\non the sofa with Lady Tavistock, dearest Uncle Leopold and Lord\r\nMelbourne sitting near me; they talked very interestingly together.\r\nThe rest of the evening I sat on the sofa with dearest Aunt Louise,\r\nwho played a game at chess with me, to _teach_ me, and Lord Melbourne\r\nsat near me. Lord Tavistock, Lord Palmerston, Mrs. Cavendish, Sir J.\r\nHobhouse and Mme. de Mérode,[337] sat round the table. Lord Melbourne,\r\nLord Palmerston, Sir J. Hobhouse, and later too Lord Conyngham, all\r\ngave me advice, and _all different_ advice, about my playing at chess,\r\nand _all_ got so _eager_ that it was very amusing; in particular Lord\r\nPalmerston and Sir J. Hobhouse,[338] who differed totally and got quite\r\nexcited and serious about it. Between them all, I got quite beat, and\r\nAunt Louise triumphed over my Council of Ministers!...\r\n\r\n_Monday, 18th September._— ... After dinner I sat on the sofa part\r\nof the evening with Lady Tavistock, Lord Melbourne sitting near me,\r\nand the rest with my _dearest_ Aunt Louise, with whom I played a game\r\nat chess, and _beat_ her; Lord Palmerston, Lord Melbourne, and Lord\r\nConyngham sat near me advising me. At 11, our _last happy evening_\r\nbroke up, and Aunt Louise took leave in the kindest way imaginable\r\nof the whole party except my gentlemen; and good Lord Melbourne was\r\ntouched to tears by this leave-taking. I cannot say _how_ I shall\r\nmiss my dearest Aunt Louise; she combines with _great_ cleverness and\r\nlearning, so much merriment, and has all the liveliness and fun of a\r\ngirl of 16, with all the _sense_ and _deep_ thought of one of 30 and\r\nmuch older even. And I think she is _so lovely_, so graceful, she\r\nhas such an angelic expression in her clear eyes; and she dresses _so\r\nwell_, morning and evening. And then my beloved Uncle whom I look up\r\nto and _love_ as a _father_, how I shall _miss_ his protection out\r\n_riding_, and his conversation!...\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 28th September._—Got up at ½ p. 8 and breakfasted with\r\nMamma at a ¼ to 10. Wrote to the Duchess of Gloucester. Saw Sir\r\nJeffrey Wyattville.[339] Wrote to the Queen and my journal. At 12 Lord\r\nMelbourne came to me and stayed with me till 10 m. p. 1. Dressed, in a\r\nhabit of dark blue with red collar and cuffs (the Windsor Uniform which\r\nall my gentlemen wear), a military cap, and my Order of the Garter, as\r\nI was going to review the Troops. At 2 I mounted Leopold, who was very\r\nhandsomely harnessed; all the gentlemen were in uniform, that is to say\r\nLord Hill, Lord Alfred Paget[340] (who looked remarkably handsome in\r\nhis uniform of the Blues), Prince Lichtenstein,[341] Baron Reisehach,\r\n&c., and my other gentlemen wore the Windsor uniform with cocked hats.\r\nMamma and Miss Cavendish rode, as did also my pretty little page,\r\nGeorge Cavendish, who looked so pretty in his uniform, mounted on a\r\nlittle pony all harnessed like a large horse. Lord Palmerston also\r\nrode. All the other ladies and gentlemen, including Lord Melbourne,\r\ndrove in carriages after us. The Lancers escorted us. When we came\r\nupon the ground, which is in the Home Park, I rode up with the whole\r\nparty to where a Sergeant was stationed with the colours, and there\r\nstopped, and the regiments saluted me. I saluted them by putting my\r\nhand to my cap like the officers do, and was much admired for my manner\r\nof doing so. I then cantered up to the Lines with all the gentlemen\r\nand rode along them. Leopold behaved most beautifully, so quietly, the\r\nBands really playing _in_ his face. I then cantered back to my first\r\nposition and there remained while the Troops marched by in slow and\r\nquick time, and when they manœuvred, which they did beautifully. The\r\nTroops consisted of the 1st Regiment of Life Guards who are beautiful,\r\nof the Grenadier Guards, and of some of the Lancers. They fired and\r\nskirmished a good deal, and near us, and Leopold never moved. The whole\r\nwent off beautifully; and I felt for the first time like a man, as if\r\nI could fight myself at the head of my Troops. We rode back to the\r\nCastle at ½ p. 4, and I mounted Barbara and rode out with Mamma, Prince\r\nLichtenstein, Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Baron Reisehach, Lord\r\nTorrington, Lord Alfred Paget, Miss Cavendish, Lady Mary, Mr. Murray\r\nand Miss Murray, and came home at 7 m. to 6. Lord Melbourne rode near\r\nme.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 29th September._—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and breakfasted at 10 with\r\nMamma. Wrote to dear Ferdinand and to the good Queen of Portugal while\r\nmy hair was doing before breakfast. Wrote to dearest Aunt Louise and\r\nmy journal. At 12 Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed with me till ½\r\np. 1. He read to me a Paper about the Civil List, and explained it to\r\nme, and so _clearly_ and _well_ he explained it; he reads very well\r\ntoo, so distinctly and with so much good emphasis....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 30th September._—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and breakfasted at 10\r\nwith Mamma. Saw Lord Albemarle. Wrote my journal. At a ¼ p. 11 Lord\r\nMelbourne came to me and stayed with me till a ¼ to 12. At a ¼ to 12\r\ncame the Queen with her sister the Duchess of Saxe-Weimar and stayed\r\nwith me till 1 o’clock. The poor Queen was very much composed, though\r\nit must have been a very painful and severe trial for her, considering\r\nshe had not been here since she left the Castle, the night after the\r\npoor King’s funeral. I showed her all my rooms with which she was much\r\npleased; and she went by herself to see the room where the King died. I\r\nsang a little and Mamma also, while they were there....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 3rd October._—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and at a ¼ p. 10 I\r\nbreakfasted with Mamma. Wrote to dearest Uncle Leopold and my journal.\r\nSaw Sir H. Wheatley. At ½ p. 12 Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed\r\nwith me till 5 m. to 2. He read to me some Despatches from Canada\r\nwhich are not very satisfactory. Saw Princess Augusta. At ½ p. 3 I\r\nrode out with Mamma, Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Lady Mary, Lord\r\nTorrington, Mr. Murray, Mr. Brand, Col., Mrs. and Miss Cavendish, and\r\nMiss Murray, and came home at 6. We rode all round Virginia Water, a\r\nbeautiful ride, and cantered almost the whole way home. It was the\r\nhottest summer evening that can be imagined, not a breath of air, and\r\nhotter coming home than going out. Alas! it was our last ride here!\r\nI am _very sorry_ indeed to go! I passed such a very pleasant time\r\nhere; the pleasantest summer I EVER passed in _my life_, and I shall\r\nnever forget this first summer of my Reign. I have had the _great_\r\nhappiness of having my beloved Uncle and Aunt here with me, I have had\r\nvery pleasant people and kind friends staying with me, and I have had\r\n_delicious_ rides which have done me a world of good. Lord Melbourne\r\nrode near me the whole time. The more I see of him and the more I know\r\nof him, the more I like and appreciate his fine and honest character.\r\nI have seen a great deal of him, every day, these last 5 weeks, and I\r\nhave always found him in good humour, kind, good, and most agreeable;\r\nI have seen him in my Closet for Political Affairs, I have ridden out\r\nwith him (every day), I have sat near him constantly at and after\r\ndinner, and talked about all sorts of things, and have always found him\r\na kind and most excellent and very agreeable man. I am very fond of\r\nhim. Wrote my journal....\r\n\r\nBRIGHTON, _Wednesday, 4th October_.—... I constantly regret I cannot\r\nwrite down many of the pleasant and instructive conversations I have\r\nwith clever people, such as Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Lord\r\nHolland, &c., &c. And many of the Foreign Despatches which I read, in\r\nparticular some of the Private letters of the Ambassadors and Ministers\r\nto Lord Palmerston, are _so_ interesting and well written that I wish\r\nI could note them down. I read one of Mr. Villiers’[342] from Madrid\r\nto-day, which is remarkably well written....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 24th October._—Got up at 25 m. p. 8 and breakfasted at a ¼\r\nto 10 with Mamma, having signed &c. before breakfast. Wrote my journal\r\n&c. At 3 m. to 11 Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed with me till ½\r\np. 12. Talked over many things and gave him a letter I had received\r\nthis morning from Uncle Leopold, to read; he took it with him. Sat to\r\nSir David Wilkie. Before I left the painting room, I sent for Lord\r\nMelbourne to see the Picture, with which he was much pleased. It is\r\nto be my _First Council_,[343] and a great many Portraits will be\r\nintroduced into the picture; Lord Melbourne will be painted standing\r\nnear me. Wrote my journal....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 29th October._— ... At a little after 3 I _tried_ to drive out\r\nwith Lady Mulgrave, Lady Gardiner and Miss Paget[344] following, but\r\nwe were obliged to come home again almost directly as it rained the\r\nwhole time. It is really most provoking weather. Finished my letter\r\nto Feodore, and wrote one to my _Cousin Marie_.[345] Saw Stockmar for\r\none instant. At 7 we dined....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 1st November._—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and breakfasted at 10\r\nwith Mamma. Received before breakfast a letter from Ferdinand and\r\none from Mary with a very pretty little ring in it. At ½ p. 10 my\r\nexcellent, kind friend Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed with me\r\ntill 12. Talked over many things; and talked over some _disagreeable\r\nbusiness_ about which Lord Melbourne is _very kind_ (as he is about\r\n_everything_, for he is the best-hearted, kindest and most feeling man\r\nin the world) and very anxious. Showed him dear Ferdinand’s letter.\r\nPoor Ferdinand’s position and the unfortunate state of Portuguese\r\naffairs distress him much; he takes everything so much to heart,\r\nwhich is generally not the case with a Statesman. I observed to Lord\r\nMelbourne that there were not many very good preachers to be found;\r\nhe replied in the affirmative and added, “But there are not _many\r\nvery good anything_,” which is _very true_.... I then took leave of\r\nhim, told him I was very sorry he went, to which he replied he was\r\nalso very sorry. I shall see him again however on Saturday when I go\r\nto town. I am _very sorry_ to lose his agreeable company (as I always\r\nlike to have those who are kind to me, and _my_ friends, with me)\r\nthese last days here. And I am very sorry to think that the summer and\r\nautumn (the pleasantest _I_ EVER passed) are over! How time flies when\r\npleasantly spent!! Lord Melbourne also was much better for this quiet\r\nlife and liked it too. He is a great friend of Lehzen’s which makes\r\nme _more_ fond of him still. I always saw Lord Melbourne in my little\r\nsitting-room; I being seated on a sofa, and he in an armchair near or\r\nclose opposite me; the other ministers and visitors I saw in another\r\nlittle room just the same size as this one, where Lehzen always sits;\r\nit is close to the other, one little room only being between the two....\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE, _Saturday, 4th November_.—Got up at ½ p. 7. Wrote\r\nmy journal while my hair was doing. Received a few lines from Lord\r\nMelbourne. At 9 I breakfasted with Mama. Saw Stockmar. At 10 minutes\r\nto 10 I left Brighton with Mama and Lady Mulgrave; Miss Dillon, Lady\r\nMary Stopford, dearest Lehzen and Col. Cavendish following in another\r\ncarriage. Lady Gardiner went in her own carriage. I took leave of Miss\r\nPaget before I went; both her and Miss Dillon’s waitings were out on\r\nThursday, but I did not wish to give the other Maids of Honour the\r\ntrouble of coming down only for two days and then going back again.\r\nMiss Paget is a very good, quiet, nice, unaffected girl. We changed\r\nhorses first at Hickstead, 2ndly at Crawley, 3rdly at Redhill, and\r\nlastly at Croydon, and reached Buckingham Palace at 3. It is a journey\r\nof 52 miles.... I have changed my rooms, that is to say, I sit in my\r\ndressing-room, and make it both my sitting and dressing-room, which is\r\nmuch more comfortable and cheerful than the other rooms on the other\r\nside; and I shall see all my Ministers &c. in the former breakfast\r\nroom,[346] next my dressing-room, which is now very prettily furnished\r\nand looks very nice and cheerful. Lehzen’s little sitting-room is next\r\nthis room. At a few m. p. 4 came my good Lord Melbourne, whom I was\r\nhappy to see well and in good spirits, though a little tired with the\r\ndeal he has to do; he stayed with me till 10 m. p. 5, and we talked\r\nover various important things. I, of course, saw him in the _new\r\nMinisterial Room_....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 9th November._—Got up at ½ p. 9 and breakfasted by myself\r\nin my room at ½ p. 10. Played on the piano and sang. Wrote my journal.\r\nDressed for the Lord Mayor’s dinner, in _all my finery_. At 2 I went\r\nin the state carriage and 8 horses with the Duchess of Sutherland and\r\nLord Albemarle; all my suite, the Royal Family, &c., went before me.\r\nI reached the Guildhall at a little before 4. Throughout my progress\r\nto the city, I met with the MOST gratifying, affectionate, hearty\r\nand brilliant reception from the greatest concourse of people I ever\r\nwitnessed; the streets being _immensely crowded_ as were also the\r\nwindows, houses, churches, balconies, every where. I was then conducted\r\nby the Lord Chamberlain, the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress preceding\r\nme, and my whole suite following me,—to a private drawing-room, where\r\nI found Mamma, the Duchess of Gloucester, the Duchess of Cambridge,\r\nand Augusta, and all their Ladies. All my Ladies came in there. After\r\nwaiting some little time, I sent for Lord Melbourne and Lord John\r\nRussell, to ask them some questions, and they came in for a minute or\r\ntwo, and then went away. After waiting a little longer, I was conducted\r\nby Lord Conyngham in the same way as before, the Royal Family and my\r\nLadies &c. following, to the Council Room, where were the Dukes of\r\nSussex and Cambridge and George,—all my Ministers, all the Foreign\r\nAmbassadors and Ministers &c., &c., the Lord Mayor, all the Aldermen,\r\nthe Lady Mayoress and all the Aldermen’s wives. I was seated in a large\r\narm-chair, all the others standing. The Recorder then read an Address,\r\nto which I read an answer; when the Lord Mayor was presented I said to\r\nLord John Russell (what I had previously been told to do), “I desire\r\nyou to take proper measures for conferring the dignity of Baronet on\r\nthe Lord Mayor.” I then knighted the Sheriffs, one of whom was Mr.\r\nMontefiore, a Jew, an excellent man[347]; and I was very glad that I\r\nwas the first to do what _I_ think quite right, as it should be. The\r\nLady Mayoress and all the Aldermen’s wives were then presented. After\r\nthis we returned, as before, to the Private Drawing room and remained\r\nthere till a ¼ p. 5 when we went to dinner.... I drank a glass of wine\r\nwith the Lord Mayor (John Cowan) and the late Lord Mayor. The Lord\r\nMayor is a quiet little old man of 70 (they say). When my health was\r\ngiven out, there was great cheering and applause. I left dinner in the\r\nsame way I came in at about ½ p. 7; and we went as before into the\r\nPrivate Drawing room and waited there till the carriages were ready.\r\nAll the Royal Family went away before me. I went at ½ p. 8 in a usual\r\ncarriage (not a state carriage) with the Duchess of Sutherland and Lord\r\nAlbemarle as before. We came back just in the same way as we went,\r\nonly that each carriage had only a pair of horses, and there were no\r\npeople on foot walking by the carriage. The crowd was, if possible,\r\ngreater than it had been when I went in the day; and they cheered me\r\nexcessively as I came along. The streets were beautifully illuminated\r\non all sides, and looked very brilliant and gay. I got home by 20\r\nm. to 10, and quite safely; I trust there have been no accidents. I\r\ncannot say HOW gratified, and HOW _touched_ I am by the very brilliant,\r\naffectionate, cordial, enthusiastic and _unanimous_ reception I met\r\nwith in this the _greatest_ Metropolis in the _World_; there was not\r\na discontented look, not a sign of displeasure—all loyalty, affection\r\nand loud greeting from the immense multitude I passed through; and\r\nno disorder whatever. I feel _deeply grateful_ for this display of\r\naffection and unfeigned loyalty and _attachment_ from my good people.\r\nIt is much more than I deserve, and I shall do my utmost to render\r\nmyself worthy of all this love and affection. I had a very bad headache\r\nin the morning, but it went off during all the ceremonies; it was\r\nsomewhat bad when I came home, but I went to bed immediately after I\r\nhad signed a few papers....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 12th November._— ... Saw Stockmar. Walked. Signed. Wrote my\r\njournal. Read Despatches. At a little after 7 we dined. Our whole party\r\nmade only 12 in number, which were, us 10 (for Miss Davys and Col.\r\nCavendish had gone home and Lady Mary was ill), Lord Melbourne and Mr.\r\nCowper. Lord Melbourne led me in and I sat between him and Mr. Cowper.\r\nI was happy to see Lord Melbourne in very good spirits; he was very\r\namusing about Theatricals and has peculiar tastes of his own about\r\nactors. He has such an honest, blunt, and amusing manner of coming out\r\nwith his remarks and observations. After dinner I sat on the sofa with\r\nMamma, and Lord Melbourne sat near me the whole evening. Mr. Cowper\r\n(who, as usual, was very amusing), and Lady Mulgrave sat near the\r\ntable. Lord Melbourne does not, I think, look quite as well as he used\r\nto do when at Windsor and Brighton; he looks paler and tired often; and\r\nhe says he feels the want of exercise. I fear since I have come to the\r\nthrone he has still more to do than he had before; but he is always\r\nready to assist me in every way, and will not admit that I trouble him.\r\nStayed up till 11. It was a very pleasant evening.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 13th November._— ... I do not mention when I get\r\ncommunications from Lord Melbourne and when I write to him, for that\r\noccurs _every_ day and _generally_ 2 or 3 times a day, so that it would\r\ntake up too much time; I also receive communications from all the\r\nother Ministers; the one with whom I communicate _oftenest_ after Lord\r\nMelbourne is Lord Palmerston....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 16th November._— ... At a ¼ p. 2 Lord Melbourne came to me\r\nand stayed with me till 12 m. p. 3. He read me the Speech again, as\r\nit is settled to be now; and became touched to tears in reading the\r\nconcluding part which alludes to my youth and reliance on the Loyalty\r\nof my People—kind, excellent, good man. Talked over various things....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 17th November._— ... After dinner I went at ½ p. 6 with all\r\nthe dinner party, except Lehzen (who again went with Mr. Rich to the\r\nplay in a box opposite), Miss Davys (who did not go), and Lord Alfred\r\nPaget (who was on the escort and rode by the carriage), to the play to\r\nCovent Garden, the Duchess of Sutherland and Lord Albemarle going with\r\nme in the carriage. I met with the same brilliant reception, the house\r\nbeing _so_ full that there was a great piece of work for want of room,\r\nand many people had to be _pulled_ out of the Pit by their wrists and\r\narms into the Dress Circle. I never saw such an exhibition; it was the\r\noddest thing I ever saw. My Ladies took it by turns, (their standing\r\nbehind me, I mean). Mamma sat near me, and Lady Mary stood behind her.\r\nThe performances were the fine but dreadful tragedy of _Werner_ by Lord\r\nByron, and the 1st act of _Fra Diavolo_....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 20th November._—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and breakfasted by myself\r\nat a ¼ p. 10. Played on the piano. Saw Mr. Spring Rice. Dressed for\r\ngoing to the House of Lords, exactly in the same costume as last\r\nJuly. When I was dressed I saw the Duchess of Gloucester, the Duchess\r\nof Cambridge, and Augusta[348] and little Mary.[349] At ½ p. 1 I\r\nwent in the State Carriage with the Duchess of Sutherland and Lord\r\nAlbemarle; Lady Lansdowne, Lady Barham, and all my gentlemen (except\r\nLord Conyngham who went as a Peer and not in my suite), and 3 Pages,\r\ngoing in 6 other carriages, to the House of Lords to open Parliament.\r\nI arrived there at 2, and was conducted to the Library—all the Great\r\nOfficers of State, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President, the Lord\r\nPrivy Seal, preceding me—Lord Melbourne walking quite close before\r\nme bearing the sword of state. I robed in the Library, all the\r\nabove-mentioned people, my ladies and gentlemen, being there, and then\r\nproceeded into the House of Lords—the manner of going in being the same\r\nas before—and seated myself on the Throne; Lord Melbourne standing\r\nquite close to me on my left; I feel a satisfaction in having this\r\nexcellent man near me on such important public occasions. I read the\r\nDeclaration about Transubstantiation, or rather repeated it after the\r\nChancellor—the Commons having been summoned to the Bar. After this I\r\nread the Speech (which I think an excellent one) and which people were\r\npleased to say I read well. The House was very full. I then returned\r\nto the Library and unrobed. Good, kind Melbourne was quite touched to\r\ntears after I read the Speech. I could only say a very few words to\r\nhim. I came home, as I went, at a ¼ p. 3. Lehzen was at the House,\r\nwhich I am very glad of, and _she_ was pleased with my manner.... The\r\nDuke of Sussex was the mover of the Address in the House of Lords, and\r\nmade a very able and judicious speech, Lord Melbourne wrote me word.\r\nI got Lord Melbourne’s despatch while I was at dinner, and I left the\r\ntable for a minute to read it. Lord Melbourne likewise informed me\r\nthat “the Address was voted without a dissentient voice”; and that the\r\nDuke of Wellington spoke fairly; adhering to his declaration of last\r\nSession, and saying that the manner in which the Measures for Ireland\r\nwere mentioned in the Speech would facilitate his intention to support\r\nMinisters in their measures. None of the Ministers spoke. I hail this\r\nbright and unanimous beginning as an auspicious augury of the coming\r\nSession and I trust that all will do well....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 24th November._— ... Saw Lord Conyngham and Edwin Landseer,\r\nwho brought a beautiful little sketch which he has done this morning,\r\nof a picture he is to paint for me of Hector and Dash. He is an\r\nunassuming, pleasing and very young-looking man, with fair hair. At 1\r\nLord Melbourne came to me and stayed with me till a ¼ to 2. Talked over\r\nvarious things....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 28th November._— ... At 20 m. to 1 came Lord Melbourne and\r\nstayed with me till 2. I was glad to see him looking well and in high\r\nspirits. He said it was “a very good debate” in the House of Lords;\r\nthat the Duke of Wellington had been somewhat eager but had been put\r\ndown. The House sat till p. 11, and Lord Melbourne only got his dinner\r\nthen. I showed him Lord John’s account of the Debate in the H. of\r\nCommons. He said there was a good deal in this _large_ majority as the\r\nOpposition had made rather a point of it to carry it. Lord Melbourne\r\nwas quite touched in saying this, as he knows how anxious I am the\r\nGovernment should be _firm_ for the peace of the Country and for my\r\nown peace and happiness; as also when he spoke of the readiness with\r\nwhich the Civil List would be voted. He is _so_ kind to me; I have the\r\nGREATEST confidence in him. He is so truly excellent. I cannot say\r\nHOW happy I am at this _good_ beginning! Lord Melbourne even said,\r\neverything went much better than they expected. I trust most fervently\r\nthat all will continue thus well....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 29th November._— ... At 20 m. p. 12 Lord Melbourne came\r\nto me and stayed with me till 2. He told me there had been a very\r\nshort debate upon the Duke of Newcastle’s[350] bringing in a Bill for\r\nthe Repeal of the Catholic Emancipation Act (a most absurd idea). He\r\n(the Duke of Newcastle) was only supported by Lord Lorton[351] and\r\nLord Winchilsea. Lord Melbourne and Lord Brougham spoke. I read the\r\nspeech of the former (Lord Melbourne) in the papers; it is, as all his\r\nspeeches and sayings are, remarkably judicious and clever.... At ½ p.\r\n7 we dined.... I sat between the Duke of Wellington and the Marquis\r\nConyngham. The former I thought looking very old, and silent and out\r\nof spirits. I think he does not feel _à son aise dans sa position_; he\r\nfears to displease his friends and does not wish to oppose the Ministry\r\nviolently.... I sat on the sofa with Lady Mulgrave and Lady Barham;\r\nLady Wilhelmina Stanhope[352] and Lady Caroline Strangways[353] sitting\r\nnear me. Lady Wilhelmina is not so handsome as she was; she is not to\r\nbe compared, in _my_ opinion, to Lady Fanny Cowper, whose great charm,\r\nbesides her lovely face, fine complexion and beautiful figure is her\r\ngreat quietness, and unaffected manners, and unconsciousness of her\r\nbeauty. Lady Wilhelmina is nevertheless an agreeable, clever girl....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 4th December._—Got up at ½ p. 9.... At about 10 m. to 1 came\r\nLord Melbourne and stayed with me till 2. Talked about many things,\r\nand amongst others about the Pensions which give so much trouble. Lord\r\nMelbourne said he thought it “quite an abomination to meddle with the\r\npensions” which people now had; that upon the whole, hereafter, he was\r\nrather against giving pensions, for he said, “if people know that you\r\nhave the power to grant them, they apply without end, and it is very\r\ndifficult to refuse”; “it requires,” he added, “nerves of _iron_ to\r\nrefuse,” and “if you have none to give away, why there is an end of\r\nit.” I think this is all very true....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 6th December._—At 1 came Lord Melbourne and stayed with me\r\ntill a ¼ p. 2. He told me that there was a good deal of speaking in\r\nthe House of Lords yesterday, upon the 2nd reading of the Imprisonment\r\nfor Debt Bill, and that they sat till 10 o’clock. The bill, though\r\nopposed in detail, by some, was read a 2nd time, and was referred to\r\na Committee. In the House of Commons, the Municipal Corporation Bill\r\nfor Ireland was introduced without opposition. There was some debate\r\nupon an affair of the dismissal of a Col. Verner in Ireland (which was\r\ndone, as Lord Melbourne told me at Windsor, against his (Lord M.’s)\r\nwish, and which he still dislikes, but which cannot be helped now), on\r\naccount of a toast he gave at a public dinner. Lord Morpeth quite put\r\nhim (Col. Verner) down, by “a triumphant speech,” as Lord John wrote me\r\nword; I always shew these reports of Lord John to Lord Melbourne....\r\nLord Melbourne led me in, and I sat between him and Lord Canning, who\r\nis exceedingly shy. Lord Melbourne was in good spirits and we talked a\r\ngood deal upon various subjects; I made him laugh very much by telling\r\nhim what the Duchess of Sutherland told me _he_ had told _her_ about\r\nLord Brougham’s speech on education, which was: “That it was tiresome\r\nto hear, tiresome to educate, and tiresome to be educated.” He said, “I\r\nthink it is very true....”\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 7th December._—Went into the Drawing room where Mr. Landseer\r\nshowed me two _most_ beautiful pictures, done by himself, one large,\r\nthe other small, which he had brought for me to see; the figures\r\nand animals are all most beautifully painted and grouped; and most\r\nexquisitely finished, so that I looked at them through a _magnifying\r\nglass_; I never saw anything so exquisite in every way. He also showed\r\nme a sketch in oils (small) of Lord Melbourne which is like, but too\r\nfat, and though flattered is not in my opinion half pleasing enough.\r\nIt is very well done; he also showed me a sketch of Mrs. Lister done\r\nin _one_ sitting, and exceedingly pretty. He had only had two sittings\r\nof Lord Melbourne. He certainly is the cleverest artist there is. Sat\r\nto Mr. Hayter for a long while. Showed him some of my drawings which\r\nhe praised and told me where they were in fault. Drew. Tried to sketch\r\nlittle Mary Barrington while her mother amused her....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 8th December._— ... After dinner I sat on the sofa with Lady\r\nAshley,[354] who was very agreeable and talked to me of her children\r\n&c. One of her charms is her being so natural. Lord Melbourne sat near\r\nme the whole evening. He talked to me about the play, about Joan of\r\nArc, whom he admires, and said, “It is clearly proved that what she did\r\nis not to be attributed to any impropriety of conduct.” Many historians\r\nhave chosen to blemish the character of this poor, innocent maid, who\r\nwas _so_ great. He asked me if I had ever read Barante’s _History of\r\nthe Princes of the House of Burgundy_, in 8 vols., which gives a whole\r\naccount of Joan; which I have not. M. de Barente is French Ambassador\r\nat St. Petersburg. Lord Melbourne also spoke to me of Lord Ashley, who\r\nhe says is a very good man; and less eager in Politics than he was;\r\nLord Ashley is a high Tory. He “adores” Lady Ashley, Lord Melbourne\r\nsays. Lord Melbourne also told me that when I first came to the\r\nThrone, Lord Ashley “wrote to Emily” (Lady Cowper) “and said, ‘Why,\r\nit’s shocking that Lord Melbourne has only put Whig ladies about the\r\nQueen’; upon which Lady Cowper said, ‘Why, Lady Barham is not such a\r\ngreat Whig’; ‘Oh!’ said Ashley, ‘_she_ is quite terrible, _she_ is the\r\nworst of all.’” This amused me much. There is no end to the amusing\r\nanecdotes and stories Lord Melbourne tells, and he tells them all\r\nin such an amusing funny way. Spoke to me about horses; he told me\r\nhis pretty black mare is rather crippled by his having travelled her\r\nabout so much, and that she must get rest. Lady Ashley says that Lady\r\nCowper dotes upon her grandchildren and would give them and let them do\r\nanything. Stayed up till 11. It was a _very_ pleasant evening.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 9th December._— ... I forgot to say that Lord Melbourne\r\ngot a letter after dinner from Mr. Cowper (which he showed me) from\r\nthe House of Commons, in which he said, “The Debate is going in our\r\nfavour.” Lord Melbourne spoke to me about several of the speakers in\r\nthe House of Commons; spoke of Sir E. Sugden[355] whom he says is a\r\nvery clever lawyer, and said, “His father was a hair-cutter; he cut my\r\nhair very often.” This is a singular thing. Told me of an affront which\r\nthe “Demagogue Hunt”[356] offered William Peel one day, in the House\r\nof Commons, on the latter’s attacking him. William Peel said something\r\nderogatory about Hunt’s extraction, upon which Hunt replied: “If _my_\r\nfather was the _first gentleman_ of his family, _your_ father was the\r\n_last gentleman_ of _his_ family....”\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 12th December._— ... Lord Melbourne, though looking pale,\r\nI was happy to see in very good spirits. A few minutes after we had\r\nsat down, he turned to me and said, “We have had a great _set-to_ in\r\nthe House of Lords.” He added that Lord Brougham[357] had made an\r\nunexpected opposition against the Message which Lord Melbourne read\r\nin my name the day before, pressing my increase of income for my\r\nMother. Lord Duncannon told me that Lord Brougham had lately taken\r\nto making cutting attacks against my Ministers, and that he had most\r\nunhandsomely attacked my excellent Lord Melbourne, called him “a\r\nCourtier,” &c., &c., which, no wonder, roused Lord Melbourne’s temper,\r\nand that he returned it Lord Brougham most admirably. He always speaks\r\nwell, but particularly well this time, Lord Duncannon said. I turned\r\nto Lord Melbourne and said I had heard he had spoken so well, “as you\r\nalways do,” I added. But he is so modest and backward about his own\r\nextraordinary merits. He said to me, there might be a like difficulty\r\nin the H. of Commons upon this Message. Spoke to me about many other\r\nthings and about boys at school, and told me a very amusing anecdote\r\nabout himself. He and Lady Mulgrave were saying how imprudent it was\r\nto tell children things which they might not repeat. So he said, “When\r\nI was a boy of ten, and came home, my Mother was asking me about the\r\nboys at school, and I mentioned who were there, and amongst others the\r\npresent Lord Boston.[358] My Mother said ‘Oh! every Irby is a fool,’\r\nwhich is very true; so, when I went back to school, I told this, and\r\nsaid, ‘My Mother says every Irby is a fool.’ This was repeated, and\r\nwritten back to Lord Boston,[359] and created most dreadful offence.”\r\nWe then spoke about Magnetism, which every body is mad about now; and\r\nI said it was very disagreeable to be magnetised, as people got to say\r\nsuch odd things in this _magnetic_ state. “Why,” said Lord Melbourne,\r\n“people say odd enough things without being magnetised....” Spoke of\r\nLord and Lady Ashley, their happiness and fondness for each other. I\r\nspoke to him of Lady C. Barrington’s[360] gratitude to me, at which his\r\neyes filled with tears. He is the kindest, best, and tenderest hearted\r\nman I know; he is so truly excellent, and moral, and has such a strong\r\nfeeling against immorality and wickedness; and he is _so_ truly kind to\r\nme....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 22nd December._— ... Lord Melbourne spoke to me a good deal\r\nabout the Privy Purse, about its expenses, the Pensions on it, &c., &c.\r\nAbout the Household Expenditure; about many other things concerning\r\nexpenditure; about the late Kings, George 4th and William 4th’s\r\nfancies, &c., &c. His ideas about all these things are so reasonable\r\nand so excellent.... I sat between Lord Melbourne (who led me in) and\r\nLord Palmerston. I was delighted to see Lord Melbourne in excellent\r\nspirits, and looking much better. He was very clever and funny about\r\neducation, at dinner; his ideas are excellent about it, I think. He\r\nsaid that he thought almost every body’s character was formed by their\r\nMother, and that if the children did not turn out well, the mothers\r\nshould be punished for it. I daresay _his_ noble, fine and excellent\r\ncharacter was formed by his mother,[361] for she was a remarkably\r\nclever and sensible woman. He told me that the Civil List Bill was\r\nread a third time that evening, without any opposition. The news are,\r\nI grieve to say, very bad from Canada[362]; that is to say rumours and\r\nreports by the Papers, though we have no Official Reports. But Lord\r\nMelbourne hopes that it may not be so bad as it is rumoured. There\r\ncertainly is open Rebellion. This makes it expedient that Parliament\r\nshould meet again on the 16th January and not adjourn _till_ the 1st\r\nFeb. as was at first intended....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 26th December._— ... At 3 I left Buckingham Palace (with\r\nregret, as I had passed a pleasant time there), with Mamma and Lady\r\nMulgrave; Lady Mary, Miss Cocks, Mrs. Campbell, Col. Grey,[363] Lehzen,\r\nMiss Dillon, and Miss Davys following in 2 other carriages. We arrived\r\nat Windsor Castle at ½ p. 5. It was quite dark. The Castle looked very\r\ncheerful and comfortable, and I cannot say _how_ much it put me in mind\r\nof last summer and of the VERY VERY HAPPY days I spent there....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 27th December._— ... Besides our party of yesterday, the\r\nDuke and Duchess of Sutherland and the Duke of Argyll (who all stay\r\nhere till Monday, 1st Jan.) dined here. The Duchess was looking so\r\nwell; neither she nor the Duke have ever been staying at Windsor before\r\nand are delighted with the Castle. I sat between the Duke of Sutherland\r\nand Mr. Cowper. I talked a great deal with the latter, and a great deal\r\nabout Lord Melbourne. He says that all the people who have never seen\r\nLord Melbourne and come to have interviews with him, and those Members\r\nof the H. of Commons who dine with him and have not seen or known\r\nhim before and expect to find the Prime Minister a very proud, stiff\r\nperson, are quite delighted with his very kind, unaffected, merry and\r\nopen, frank manner, which I think everybody _must_ and _ought_ to be.\r\nHe told me some amusing anecdotes about him, &c., &c., and many other\r\nfunny things. Lord Melbourne is very absent when in company, often, and\r\ntalks to himself every now and then, loud enough to be heard but never\r\nloud enough to be understood. I am now, from habit, quite accustomed to\r\nit, but at first I turned round sometimes, thinking he was talking to\r\nme. Mr. Cowper says he does not think his uncle is aware of it; he says\r\nhe is much less absent than he used to be....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.S.H. Charles Prince of Leiningen from a portrait by\r\n  R. J. Lane]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  The impression produced by the Queen at this time is vividly\r\n  described by Princess Lieven in a letter to Lord Aberdeen. “I have\r\n  seen the Queen twice,” she writes; “I have seen her alone, and I\r\n  have seen her in Society with her Prime Minister. She possesses\r\n  a composure, an air of command, and of dignity, which with her\r\n  childlike face, her tiny figure, and her pretty smile, create\r\n  one of the most extraordinary impressions that it is possible to\r\n  imagine. She is extremely reserved in conversation. It is said that\r\n  prudence is one of her highest qualities. Lord Melbourne adopts,\r\n  when he is near her, an attitude of affection, of content, of\r\n  self-consciousness mingled with a great deal of respect, which with\r\n  his easy manners, the obvious habit of holding the first place amid\r\n  her surroundings, his dreaminess at one moment, and his gaiety at\r\n  another, make a picture you can easily realise. The Queen is full\r\n  of amiability towards him.”\r\n\r\n  That is a glimpse of the external setting in which these Journals\r\n  were composed. Lord Melbourne never forgot, from the outset, that\r\n  the girl to whom he was acting as guardian and tutor was the\r\n  Sovereign of these Realms. His letters from the first are written\r\n  in the conventional form of a Minister addressing the Sovereign.\r\n  Although he obviously tried in conversation to amuse the Queen, and\r\n  to impart to her youthful intelligence some knowledge of Society,\r\n  and of the world of Affairs in which she was about to take part,\r\n  he did not shrink from the graver topics of statecraft, and did\r\n  not spare her the details of public matters that must have been\r\n  difficult for her to grasp and comprehend.\r\n\r\n  There is a passage in one of his letters, written about this time,\r\n  in which he is explaining to the Queen the powers and duties which\r\n  it was intended to transfer from the Secretary of State, who\r\n  combined at that time the administration of Colonial and Military\r\n  affairs, to a new Secretary of State for War. Lord Melbourne adds\r\n  these words: “Your Majesty will not suppose that Lord Melbourne by\r\n  laying before you the whole case has an idea of throwing the weight\r\n  of such a decision entirely upon Your Majesty. Lord Melbourne will\r\n  deem it his duty to offer to Your Majesty a decided opinion upon\r\n  the subject.” This passage illuminates, if taken in conjunction\r\n  with Princess Lieven’s descriptive passage, the atmosphere in which\r\n  Lord Melbourne and the Queen were living at this time. To this\r\n  young Queen he was Roger Ascham and Burleigh in one and _in petto_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                                 1838\r\n\r\n_Monday, 1st January._— ... The Duke of Sutherland told me the\r\nother night, that Lord Melbourne’s mother (whom he knew) was a very\r\nagreeable, sensible, clever woman, and that Lord Melbourne was very\r\nlike her as to features; Lady Melbourne was very large latterly. Lord\r\nMelbourne’s father, on the contrary, the Duke said, was very far from\r\nagreeable or clever; he was a short fat man and not like any of his\r\nchildren. He died at the age of 80. The Duchess of Sutherland spoke to\r\nme last night about Lady Caroline Lamb,[364] Lord Melbourne’s wife;\r\nshe was Lord Duncannon’s only sister, and the strangest person that\r\never lived, really half crazy, and quite so when she died; she was not\r\ngood-looking, but very clever, and could be very amusing. She teazed\r\nthat excellent Lord Melbourne in every way, dreadfully, and quite\r\nembittered his life, which it ought to have been her pride to study\r\nto render a happy one; he was the kindest of husbands to her, and\r\nbore it most admirably; any other man would have separated from such\r\na wife. He has now the greatest horror of any woman who is in any\r\nway eccentric or extravagant, which shows how very much he must have\r\nsuffered from such a wife. The Duchess told me the strangest stories\r\nabout her....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 2nd January._— ... I rode a new horse, a most _delightful_\r\ncreature, called Tartar; he is taller than Barbara, excessively pretty,\r\nand of a very dark brown colour; he has a very springy charming canter\r\nand action, is full of spirit, and yet as quiet as a lamb, never shies\r\nand is the best-tempered creature possible; to crown all these valuable\r\nqualities, Tartar is exceedingly sure-footed. It was a delightful ride\r\nand we cantered a great deal coming home; the roads were so dirty that\r\nmy habit was quite heavy with mud. Changed my dress and walked out with\r\nLady Mulgrave and Lehzen and came home at ½ p. 3. Read Despatches from\r\nCanada which are very interesting....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 4th January._— ... At ½ p. 5 came my excellent, kind friend,\r\nLord Melbourne, whom I was quite delighted to see again after such a\r\nlong absence, the longest that has taken place since I came to the\r\nThrone. I thought him in very good spirits, and looking well, though\r\npale, and as kind, amiable and mild as ever; never do I find any\r\ndifference in this excellent man, may he be very tired, or not tired,\r\nhe is always equally kind and gentle, though he may at times be low.\r\nI was agreeably surprised to find him in good spirits, for from his\r\nletters and all the troubles and difficulties he has had of late, I\r\nfeared it might not be so. He spoke to me first a good deal about\r\nCanada; said they were all agreed as to what was to be done, namely\r\nto repeal a Statute (_which_, I cannot say), and _for_ the present,\r\ngovern as Canada had been governed before; but that Lord Howick was of\r\na different opinion and thought that these strong measures ought to be\r\naccompanied by conciliatory measures, which Lord Melbourne said would\r\nnot answer the purpose and have a bad effect; Lord Howick, he said, was\r\nexcessively eager about this, for various reasons which Lord Melbourne\r\nexplained to me; “if Lord Howick was to resign,” he added, “I do not\r\nthink that would affect the Government; it would be a bad thing for\r\nthere is a good deal of strength in him.” The other question, about the\r\nArmy, he considered a more difficult one; the five Ministers who signed\r\nthe Report relative to the changes meditated in the office of the\r\nSecretary of War, are, Lord John Russell, Lord Howick, Lord Palmerston,\r\nSir J. Hobhouse, and Mr. Spring Rice. Lord Howick and Lord John, he\r\nsaid, are the only two who are eager about it; the others he believed\r\nsigned it reluctantly, particularly Mr. Rice. We spoke a good deal\r\nabout this difficult question; there is, in my opinion, a good deal for\r\nand a good deal against it. It is, as Lord Melbourne says, creating\r\na new Minister with new powers, by giving the Secretary at War great\r\npower over the Army. There have been, as Lord Melbourne says, great\r\nabuses which it would be desirable to remedy. Spoke about the Troops\r\nto be sent to Canada; about Mr. Rice’s wish to take the Chair; about\r\n_his_ reasons for doing so; how to replace _him_; about the present\r\nSpeaker; about the quarrel in Belgium relative to the cutting of timber\r\nin the Grünewald; about the King of Hanover’s foolish proceedings; how\r\nthey are viewed in Germany; about some despatches from Sir Frederick\r\nLamb,[365] saying that Metternich was much displeased at the expulsion\r\nof the Archbishop of Cologne, at the manner of doing it, and at the\r\nimpolicy of the act. Lord Melbourne said he had dined once or twice at\r\nLord Holland’s[366] since I had seen him. I was quite happy to talk to\r\nhim again, as there were many subjects on which I wanted explanation\r\nand he explains _so_ well and so clearly and agreeably.... My good\r\nLord Melbourne led me in and I sat between him and Lord Torrington. He\r\n(Ld. M.) spoke to me about many things; about riding and horses; about\r\n_bad ears_ for Music; said that everybody would suppose from Scott’s\r\nwritings that he was very fond of and understood music very well;\r\nwhereas Lord Melbourne said, _he_ said: “In music I don’t know _high_\r\nfrom _low_!”...\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 9th January._— ... At 22 m. to 12 came my excellent Lord\r\nMelbourne and stayed with me till 27 m. p. 12. He had informed me\r\nby a note in the morning, that he should be obliged to go to London\r\nwhich I am extremely sorry for; Lord Glenelg wrote to him wishing\r\nto see him, and both he and Lord Glenelg were to see Lord Durham\r\nat _four_ about this Canadian business. _I_ shall say more of this\r\nhereafter. Lord Melbourne said: “It will be a long interview, I\r\ndare say; probably last 2 hours, and there would be no time to be\r\nback,”—meaning for dinner tonight, so he will only come back at 4\r\ntomorrow; I am _very_ sorry to lose him _even_ for _one_ night. Spoke\r\na good while about this. Spoke about this army business, upon which\r\nLord Melbourne will see Lord Howick. He said, “It would be madness to\r\npropose at this moment a complete change in the Administration of the\r\nArmy, when we have got all these affairs of Canada.” He spoke of this\r\na good deal; and seemed to hope Lord Howick would give it up; he said\r\nthe others would be ready to do so if he did.... Though I think Lord\r\nDuncannon agreeable and amusing, I cannot find in him or in any of\r\nthe other Ministers, that kindness, mildness, and open frankness, and\r\n_agreeability_ (to use a word of Lady Mary Stopford’s) which I find in\r\nmy kind friend Lord Melbourne; _he alone_ inspires me with that feeling\r\nof great confidence and I may say _security_, for I feel _so safe_ when\r\nhe speaks to me and is with me; what he says is all so kind and good,\r\nand he never says anything which could alarm or hurt me. But I should\r\nnot _wish_ to be on the same confidential footing with any of my other\r\nMinisters as I am with this truly excellent friend....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 10th January._— ... Lord Melbourne said that he had seen\r\nLord Durham who seemed very much inclined to accept the Proposition\r\nof going to Canada; he (Ld. D.) was not quite satisfied with all the\r\nplans proposed by Government, and particularly with a Council of 17,\r\nwhich he said was too many; that he could not manage more than 4 or 5.\r\nLord Durham requires, Lord Melbourne added, a large outfit, as he would\r\nnot spend any of his private fortune; and he would not go till the\r\nNavigation was open. Lord Melbourne then told me that he had seen Lord\r\nHowick who seemed “disposed to reconsider” the question of the army,\r\nand said he would not press parts of it, and would give way on some\r\npoints. This is a great satisfaction and I think Lord Melbourne seemed\r\nquite happy about it....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 17th January._— ... My excellent Lord Melbourne led me in,\r\nand I sat between him and Lord Glenelg. Lord Melbourne _said_ he was,\r\nand I was happy to see he _looked_, better. He said, as he led me in,\r\nthat the Majority in the House of Commons of the night before was very\r\nfavourable. He spoke to me about Greece; said he had heard from his\r\nbrother that they were very uneasy at Vienna about the state of Greece;\r\nsaid that the only person who showed any sense or character there was\r\nthe Queen of Greece,[367] but that she was very young and was placed in\r\nrather a rougher situation than suited her; that the Archduke John[368]\r\nhad told Sir Frederic (on his return from Greece) “that she was like\r\na Brazillian Paraquite in a wood of firs covered with snow,” meaning\r\nthat she was in a position not suited to her; I said to Lord Melbourne\r\nthat I had heard in the Summer that there were hopes of there being\r\nan _heir_ in some time; he said, “I am afraid not.” He told me that\r\nthe Archduke John had likewise told his brother that the Emperor of\r\nRussia[369] was beginning to sink under the immense weight and fatigue\r\nof governing such an empire as Russia; we spoke about him some time;\r\nand also a good deal about the Austrian Royal Family; Lord Melbourne\r\ntold me that the Emperor of Austria[370] was worse, and hardly able to\r\ndo anything; but, that as his _mental faculties decreased_, his _bodily\r\nstrength increased_. Spoke of Aunt Louise; of the Queen of Portugal;\r\nof Clementine, Augustus, &c., of Feodore, her happiness, her not being\r\nrich; he spoke of the poverty of the younger branches in high families\r\nin England, and of their being often obliged to gain their livelihood\r\nin inferior situations; he said that he thought his nephew Lord Cowper\r\nwas cleverer and had “a sounder understanding” than William Cowper....\r\nSpoke about Shakespear’s plays; _Hamlet_, _Macbeth_, _Lear_, &c., &c.;\r\nhe thinks the 2 first named the finest; he said: “I think the German\r\ncritics understand Shakespear better than we do here”; mentioned\r\nGoethe’s _Wilhelm Meister_, and Schlegel’s book upon Shakespear, which\r\nhe thinks very good; he knew, or at least saw, Schlegel here; he knew\r\nMme. de Staël; spoke of her, of her daughter, the Duchess de Broglie;\r\nspoke of actresses; of their marrying out of their sphere; of its often\r\nnot answering; of Lady Harrington,[371] Lady Craven[372] (the Dowager),\r\nLady Derby (the late),[373] Mrs. Butler; of marriages in _general_,\r\nand most cleverly and sensibly; of their often being broken off—the\r\nreasons why. Lord Melbourne said, “Why, you see, a gentleman hardly\r\nknows a girl till he has proposed, and then when he has an unrestrained\r\nintercourse with her he sees something and says, ‘This I don’t quite\r\nlike....’”\r\n\r\n_Friday, 19th January._— ... The cold increases, the snow is getting\r\ndeep, and I hear the Thames is frozen over very nearly, which has not\r\nhappened since 1814. At ½ p. 1 came my excellent friend Lord Melbourne\r\nand stayed with me till 3. He looked well, I was very happy to see, and\r\nsaid he was not at all tired. He said that they had got through this\r\nCanada business very well; that Lord Brougham made a good though very\r\nviolent speech; that the Duke of Wellington’s was very fair; in fact\r\nvery friendly; that he (Lord Melbourne) thought the only difficult part\r\nto defend was the not having sent more troops; “but,” he added, “there\r\nthe Duke of Wellington came to our assistance, and said there were\r\nnot too few troops.” Spoke about Canada for some time.... In speaking\r\nof the Duke of Wellington he said: “He has no oratorical powers; he\r\nattempts no ornament, but speaks generally very much to the point; he\r\ncannot always express what he feels and understands.” He added that\r\npeople sometimes who were great in action could not express well in\r\nwords what they meant and conceived; spoke of all the Duke’s family,\r\nand said he thought the Duke was the cleverest; asked me if I had ever\r\nread the Duke’s Despatches, and said they were worth looking at, to see\r\nthe way he did them.... Lord Melbourne told me, in speaking of the Duke\r\nof Wellington, “His people are very angry with him; they think he is\r\nleaving them.” How wrong of these people! I told Lord Melbourne what\r\nmy Uncle Leopold had written to me about him (Ld M.), which seemed\r\nto please him. Talked of other things. Talked for some time with him\r\nand Lord Palmerston, about education, punishments, &c., Lord Melbourne\r\nwas amazingly funny and amusing about this. I said I thought solitary\r\nconfinement a good punishment: Lord Melbourne replied, “I think it’s\r\na very stupefying punishment.” I mentioned the system of _silence_ as\r\na very good one and quoted myself as a proof of its having answered,\r\nwhich made them laugh very much. Lord Melbourne said, “It may do very\r\nwell with a lively child; but with one of a sulky, _grumpy_ disposition\r\nit would not answer....” I said I thought it cruel to punish children\r\nby depriving them of their meals and saying they should go without\r\ntheir supper, &c. Lord Melbourne replied, “Why, when I was a child,\r\nthey had contrived to annoy me so, and had made me cry so much, that I\r\nhad lost all appetite.”\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 20th January._— ... At ½ p. 12 Lord Glenelg presented Lord\r\nDurham to me on his appointment; Lord Glenelg then left the room\r\nand Lord Durham remained with me for about ½ an hour, I should say.\r\nHe spoke entirely about Canada which subject he seems to understand\r\nthoroughly; said he considered the task he was about to undertake, a\r\nmost difficult one; and he _might_ not succeed; but that he would do\r\nhis utmost to restore tranquillity in Canada; said he wished to have my\r\nauthority, when the rebellion was quelled, to conciliate these deluded\r\npeople and to hold out mercy to them. He spoke at much length about\r\nall this,—about what he intended to do,—the difficulty of the task,\r\n&c., &c. At ½ p. 1 came Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 20 m.\r\np. 2. He seemed well. He said, “I am sorry to say I received a letter\r\nfrom Lord Howick this morning and that he makes a great demur about\r\nthis Army affair.” Lord Melbourne then added that as it was such a\r\ndifficult question and as it could be done “as it were by one blow,”\r\nand as the Army disliked it so much and altogether it was such a bad\r\ntime for it, and he thought it such a difficult question, that he could\r\nnot give way to him upon it, and could not advise me to do it; he added\r\nhe would not mind it near so much if it were brought before Parliament\r\nand there fairly discussed, for then if it passed, it would be done\r\nby the authority of Parliament; but in this way, it was so entirely\r\nto be done by me, as it were, that he really could not agree to it;\r\nmoreover that if even it were a very good thing in itself (which he\r\ndoes not think it), this would not be the moment for doing it; none\r\nof the other Ministers he thought were eager for it; but if it were\r\nproposed in the Cabinet and carried by a majority against Lord Howick,\r\nhe (Ld. H.) might resign (which Lord M. says would be a bad thing, but\r\nwould not affect the Government), and Lord Melbourne did not know what\r\nLord John Russell might _then_ do, if Lord Howick held out on it; which\r\nwould then affect the Government. I told Lord Melbourne that if it\r\ncould be of any use, he might say that _I quite_ agreed with him (Lord\r\nMelbourne) and that he might rely upon me; which assurance pleased him,\r\nthough I think he must long be aware of my firm resolution to support\r\nthis kind and true friend of mine, as he truly and really is, in every\r\nway.... Got a few lines (when I went to my room) from Lord Melbourne (I\r\ngenerally _hear from_ him and _write to him_ every day, and very often\r\n_two_ or _three_ times a day), in which he said that great difference\r\nhad prevailed and did prevail in the Cabinet respecting the Details\r\nabout Canada. A Cabinet had been held immediately after he left me. I\r\nam _very_ sorry to hear this.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 21st January._— ... After dinner before we sat down, I talked\r\nto Lord Melbourne about some important things; I asked him the cause of\r\nthe differences in the Cabinet; he said that he wished, and also most\r\nof the others, that the Legislative Council in Canada should be chosen\r\nfrom those which composed the present Legislative Assembly,—whereas\r\nLord Howick and some others wished the Council should be chosen from\r\nthe Country at large, and not from the Assembly; Lord Melbourne was\r\nagainst this and for this reason; we should probably lose by such an\r\nElection many of the _English_ party, now in the Legislative Assembly,\r\nand get a good many of the _French_ party who would be hostile to us;\r\nand consequently diminish our influence; none of the other Ministers\r\nwere as obstinately for this as Lord Howick—but he at length gave\r\nway.... He was very funny about a word which Lady Mary gave me to find\r\nout; she gave me the ivory letters and I was to find out the word; she\r\ngave me “thermometer,” and she spelt it with an “a” instead of an “e,”\r\nand laughed very much at her bad spelling; upon which Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid, “It is a very good way to spell it, but not _the_ way,” which\r\nmade us laugh. I said to him I was reading the first novel I had ever\r\nread—_The Bride of Lammermoor_; he said it was a very melancholy—a\r\nterrible story—but admires it; he mentioned _Old Mortality_, _Quentin\r\nDurward_, _The Fair Maid of Perth_, and _Kenilworth_, as Scott’s best\r\nnovels; he said there was “a great deal of good” and “a great deal of\r\nbad” in his novels; said he admired his poems very much, though most\r\npeople said his novels were greatly superior in their way to his poems;\r\nspoke of Richard Cœur de Lion whom we both rather admire; of Henry IV.\r\nand Sully; Lord Melbourne said that Sully was a clever and good man,\r\nand greatly superior to those Ministers who followed him; Richelieu and\r\nMazarin; “They were shocking fellows,” he added....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 23rd January._— ... He spoke of what had just taken place\r\nin Canada; said Sir John Colborne[374] was an excellent officer. “A\r\ngood officer,” he added, “can generally effect with a small force,\r\nwhat a bad officer with a large force would fail in.” Spoke about this\r\nquestion of the Army. Said that Lord Francis Egerton[375] had said in\r\nthe House, “That the troops had done remarkably well and that he hoped\r\nnothing would be done to tamper with the management of the Army,”\r\nevidently alluding, Lord Melbourne observed, to the intended changes\r\nin the Army. I told Lord Melbourne that Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence, on\r\nbeing told that I would continue to him and his brothers and sisters\r\nthe same annual allowance they enjoyed from the late King, burst into\r\ntears, and said it was unexpected, for they did not dare to hope for\r\nanything....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 24th January._— ... Lady Falkland,[376] whom I had not yet\r\nseen, was of course presented to me by Lady Portman.[377] I (as usual\r\nto all Peeresses and Ladies by courtesy) wished to kiss her, but she\r\ninsisted on kissing my hand first and then only received her kiss from\r\nme.... I observed to Lord Melbourne that it must be a great trial for\r\npoor Lady Falkland dining here.... Lady Falkland must have felt very\r\nlow, and it must have been a sad trial for her to see me for the 1st\r\ntime in the place of her poor father, but she behaved uncommonly well;\r\nshe is a very nice person. She looked pale and thin, but still very\r\npretty. I sat on the sofa with her; Lord Melbourne sitting near me\r\nthe whole evening; and all the other ladies sitting round the table.\r\nSpoke with Lord Melbourne about Lady Falkland &c. Asked him what he\r\nthought was the best History of the last 60 or 70 years. He said there\r\nwas no History of that time _only_, but that it must be got from\r\ndifferent books; that the _Annual Register_ was as good a book as any,\r\nif I wanted to look for any particular event in any one year. That\r\nthe beginning was written by Burke, and followed up by Dr. Laurence\r\n&c. Said that being written at the time, it was tinctured with party\r\nspirit. He said Adolphus’s _History of George III._ was curious as he\r\nhad got a good deal of information, and that the anecdotes told in it\r\nwere true, though the _names_ of the people were sometimes wrong.\r\nSaid that Hume’s _History of England_ was undoubtedly the best, in\r\nspite of his party prejudices, and that he thought I would like it much\r\nbetter now than when I read it before. Spoke of Clarendon’s _History\r\nof the Rebellion_ (which I told him I had read), which he thought\r\ncurious, but likes his (Clarendon’s) _Memoirs_ better. Spoke of Mrs.\r\nHutchinson’s book, said I had been reading it; he thinks that “a nice\r\nbook” and “very curious”; he knew the Editor of it; spoke of Charles\r\nthe First, whom I thought much to blame.... Spoke of Sismondi, whom he\r\nthinks a dull writer; he recommends Barante’s _History of the House\r\nof Burgundy_; and Daru’s _History of Venice_; spoke of Voltaire’s\r\nHistories; of O’Driscol’s _Ireland_ which he likes and whom he knew; of\r\nScott’s _History of Scotland_ which he has not read, &c. &c....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 25th January._— ... At ½ p. 3 came my excellent Lord\r\nMelbourne and stayed with me till ½ p. 4. He said, “I think we have\r\npatched this up,” meaning the affair about the bill relating to Canada.\r\n“We mean to stand by the bill,” he added, “and take our chance of a\r\ndivision.” Lord John, he said, was very much for leaving the Preamble\r\nout, and was not at all pleased at being obliged to stand by it; and\r\nLord Melbourne said it was a bad thing “to force a man to do what he\r\ndislikes when he has a principal part to act in it,” which is very\r\ntrue. He added something more about Canada and what was meant to be\r\ndone, if they were beat about this clause. He said that Lord Howick’s\r\ngreat violence irritated the others on the other side (in the Cabinet);\r\nMr. Thomson was very eager against Lord Howick’s ideas about Canada.\r\nI asked him if Mr. Poulett Thomson was eager; he replied that he was,\r\nbut that he could control himself, which Lord Howick could not, and\r\nwas excessively cross, and kept saying he would resign and would not\r\nbe party to this and that, which offended the others.... Spoke of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, who I observed I thought was more eager than the Duke\r\nof Wellington. Lord Melbourne replied he was not acquainted with Sir\r\nRobert Peel’s character, could not judge of his feelings, did “not know\r\nif he was desirous of office or not.” Said he believed that his (the\r\nDuke’s) party were very angry with him for what he had said in the\r\nHouse of Lords, and therefore that Sir Robert was obliged to be more\r\nviolent in order to keep his party together. “This I believe to be the\r\ntruth,” Lord Melbourne observed....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 26th January._— ... He told me that they had settled the\r\nmatter about Canada. “We have settled to leave out the Preamble; Lord\r\nHowick has given way, and owned he was in the wrong.” He added: “It\r\nwill be a triumph to the other party, but I don’t much mind that.” I\r\nsaid that I was surprised Lord Howick had given way. Lord Melbourne\r\nreplied: “He is not devoid of candour,” but that his opinions were so\r\nvery strong that he did not feel able to “surrender them.” Said that\r\nSir Robert Peel had justly observed that: “what was the necessity of\r\nasking Parliament about what they _were going_ to do”; “we don’t mean\r\nto oppose you; we won’t fetter you.” “Why therefore ask our approbation\r\nof what you are going to do?” “Act like any other Ministers and then\r\nafterwards we will approve or disapprove what has been done.”[378]\r\n“Now,” Lord Melbourne said, “this is almost unanswerable.” He is the\r\nfairest person about his opponents I ever knew; _so_ frank, so noble!\r\nso candid!... Spoke of the Combinations of the workmen in Scotland and\r\nIreland and England, which he says are quite frightful. This led him\r\nto speak of servants, of their combinations with tradespeople, their\r\nbeing bribed, &c. He observed how disagreeable it was to recommend\r\ntradespeople or servants; he said that his coachmaker had come to him\r\nthis morning and begged him to write a letter to the Bishop of Ely to\r\nrecommend him to him. “Very well,” said Lord Melbourne, “I will write\r\na letter if you wish which I will show you.” “So I wrote to the Bishop\r\nof Ely,” continued Lord Melbourne; “‘My dear Lord,—Mr. Robson has been\r\nmy coachmaker for many years, and I believe him to be a very good one,\r\nbut so he ought, for I must say he is a very dear one.’ ‘Now,’ I said\r\nto the man, ‘here is the letter, you may read it if you like....’” At\r\n7 I went to Drury Lane with the Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Portman,\r\nMiss Cavendish, Lady Mary Stopford, Lord Conyngham, Lord Headfort, and\r\nCol. Buckley (who this day replaced Col. Grey). It was Shakespear’s\r\ntragedy of _Hamlet_, and we came in at the beginning of it. Mr.\r\nCharles Kean (son of old Kean) acted the part of Hamlet and I must say\r\nbeautifully. His conception of this very difficult and I may almost\r\nsay incomprehensible character, is admirable; his delivery of all the\r\nfine long speeches quite beautiful; he is excessively graceful and all\r\nhis actions and attitudes are good, though not at all good-looking\r\nin face; the two finest scenes I thought were the _Play-scene_,\r\nwhich he acts, they say, quite differently to any other actor who\r\nhas performed Hamlet; and the scene with his mother, the Queen; it\r\nwas quite beautiful when he rushed out after having killed Polonius,\r\nexclaiming, “Is it the King?” He fights uncommonly well too. All the\r\nother characters were very badly acted. I came away just as _Hamlet_\r\nwas over. They would recognise me between the 2nd and 3rd acts,—I was\r\ncompelled to come forward, curtsey, and hear “God save the Queen” sung.\r\nThe house was amazingly crowded and they received me admirably. Came\r\nhome at ½ p. 10.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 27th January._— ... Told Lord M. I had been much pleased\r\nwith _Hamlet_ last night; observed it was a very hard play to\r\nunderstand, which he agreed in; he said he thought the end of it\r\n“awkward” and horrid; said he thought Hamlet was supposed to be mad, of\r\na philosophical mind, and urged to do something which he did not like\r\nto do. He added that Mr. Fox always said that _Hamlet_ possessed more\r\nof Shakespear’s faults than almost any other play of Shakespear, &c.,\r\n&c.—Saw Lord Palmerston who introduced Baron Munchausen, Minister from\r\nthe Court of Hanover.... I told Ld. M. of my last recollection of Baron\r\nMunchausen,[379] namely, my giving him a commission to send me some\r\nwax dolls from Berlin, which made Lord Melbourne laugh excessively.\r\nHe spoke of children’s love for dolls, and that they sometimes think\r\nthey are alive. Spoke of my former great love for dolls....[380]\r\nAfter dinner, talked (before I sat down) with all the gentlemen, &c.\r\nSpoke about Kean with Lord Melbourne; about Landseer and the sketches\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne saw and none of which he “thought _like_,” he\r\nsaid, though very clever.... Lord Melbourne said that _Richard III._\r\nby Shakespear was a very fine play; I observed that Richard was a very\r\nbad man; Lord Melbourne also thinks he was a horrid man; he believes\r\nhim to have been deformed (which some people deny), and thinks “there\r\nis no doubt that he murdered those two young Princes.” I was delighted\r\nto hear Lord Melbourne say he thought Henry 7th a very bad man, and\r\nreckless of blood; spoke of the inhuman _murder_, I may call it, of the\r\nyoung Earl of Warwick; he said that Ferdinand of Spain would not give\r\nhis daughter Catherine to _Arthur_ unless this poor Warwick was got\r\nrid of; that Catherine felt this all along and observed that it dwelt\r\nupon her and “that it did not go well with her in the world” for this\r\nreason. He spoke of Henry VIII.; said he was not so bad at first and\r\nhad begun with good intentions; spoke of Catherine of Arragon, &c.,\r\n&c.; that when Henry VIII. took a liking to somebody else, he only\r\nsought to get rid of the other in the quickest way. Spoke of the wars\r\nin Flanders.... He fell asleep for a little while in the evening, which\r\nis always a proof that he is not quite well....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 30th January._— ... I asked Lord M. what Lord Palmerston’s\r\nPolitics were at the time when he stood against Lord Lansdowne and Lord\r\nAlthorp. Lord Melbourne said that Lord Palmerston then belonged to\r\nthe _high Tory_ Party! Spoke of the change of opinions &c., &c. Spoke\r\nof the salaries &c. of my people, and spoke of Names, Christian names,\r\nfor a long while; said that Lady Vivian’s[381] little girl was called\r\n_Lalage_, from Horace; he thought the name rather pretty on account of\r\nthe lines which he repeated and which are, I _think_, “Dulce ridentem,\r\nLalagen amabo, Dulce loquentem.” Told him of the intention there once\r\nwas of changing my name, which he was surprised at, and could not think\r\nhow it could have been done.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 1st February._—The curious old form of pricking the Sheriffs\r\nwas gone through; and I had to prick them all, with a huge pin. This\r\nwas the first Council that I have yet held at which Lord Melbourne was\r\nnot present, and I must say I felt sad not to see him in his place as\r\nI feel a peculiar satisfaction, nay I must own almost _security_, at\r\nseeing him present at these formal proceedings, as I know and feel that\r\nI have a _friend_ near me, when I am as it were alone among so many\r\nstrangers. This may sound almost childish, but it is not so. Saw Lord\r\nJohn Russell....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 3rd February._—Received a communication from Lord Melbourne\r\nwhich I shall transcribe: “Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to\r\nYour Majesty and acquaints Y.M. that the Canada Government Bill was\r\nread a second time in the House of Lords, with the single dissentient\r\nvoice of Lord Brougham. Lord Melbourne sends the returns of the\r\nattendance and the speeches. Lord Brougham made a long and able speech,\r\nnot over-violent for him. The Duke of Wellington made a moderate\r\nspeech and concluded with some very able views” (I think) “of the\r\nsubject. Lord Aberdeen and Lord Wharncliffe also spoke, both strongly\r\ncondemning the conduct of Government.” This note was dated from last\r\nnight. Heard also from Lord John Russell that they had proceeded in the\r\nHouse of Commons with the Irish Corporation Bill and the Pluralities\r\nBill.... Lord M. said they sat till near 12 o’clock last night. Said\r\n“it was a very good Debate.” “The Duke of Wellington,” he added, “again\r\nmade a very fair speech”; and that the Duke’s remarks were very good\r\nabout Canada, for that there was a great deal to say about it; and that\r\nthe Duke observed, “that each Mail brought the account of some new and\r\nvery important event.” He (Ld. Melbourne) said that Lord Aberdeen and\r\nLord Wharncliffe “were very severe.” I asked him if Lord Aberdeen was\r\nnot rather a dull and heavy speaker; he replied in the affirmative; and\r\nsaid (in reply to my question as to whether he were a good speaker)\r\nthat Lord Wharncliffe was a good speaker and spoke “very clearly.” I\r\nasked him about Lord Brougham’s speech which he said “was more bitter\r\nthan violent; very bitter, but a fine speech.” Lord Melbourne told me:\r\n“We have not yet settled this Army Question; but I am more and more\r\nconvinced it would be madness to propose it; and after this affair of\r\nCanada too.” He seemed, however, I thought, sanguine about its being\r\nultimately settled.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 4th February._—Lord Melbourne asked if I had seen _King Lear_\r\n(which I had half intended to do last week); I said I had not. He\r\nsaid (alluding to the manner in which it is being performed at Covent\r\nGarden), “It is _King Lear_ as Shakespear wrote it; and which has not\r\nbeen performed so, since the time of Queen Anne.” As it is generally\r\nacted, Lord Melbourne told me, it is altered by Cibber, who “put in a\r\ndeal of stuff” of his own; that it was a much finer play as Shakespear\r\nwrote it, but “most dreadfully tragic.” That Dr. Johnson had seen it\r\nperformed in that way, and that “it made such an impression on him that\r\nhe never forgot it.” I observed to him that I feared that, and did not\r\nlike all that madness on the stage. Lord Melbourne said, “I can’t bear\r\nthat, but still it is a very fine play, and many think Shakespear’s\r\nbest.” Spoke of the play of _Richard III._, which I said I was going\r\nto see. Lord Melbourne said it was “a fine striking play.” He observed\r\nthat that scene where Richard makes love to Anne, at the funeral of\r\nHenry VI., did not belong to the play, but was taken from _Henry VI._;\r\nhe said, “That is a very foolish scene; I always thought it a most\r\nridiculous scene; and there is not the slightest foundation in History\r\nfor it; he married her 8 years afterwards.” He added that Shakespear\r\nconstantly mixed up events, in his Historical plays, without minding\r\nwhen they happened, and how far asunder.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 5th February._—Lord M. showed me a letter he had got this\r\nmorning, from Lord Ebrington,[382] saying that Lord Tavistock (who,\r\nLord Melbourne tells me, has great influence over Lord John, and was\r\nsent for) had prevailed on Lord John to put off the Army Question\r\ntill June or July; so that Lord Melbourne says they will get over\r\nit this Session; and when a thing is put off, he added, it is often\r\nforgotten or the moment not found suitable for it. “But,” continued\r\nLord Melbourne, “when one gets over one difficulty, there always comes\r\nanother; and there is now another question of great difficulty, which\r\nis the Ballot.” He then explained to me, that not only several of their\r\nsupporters but even some of the Government had pledged themselves to\r\nthe Ballot, and consequently after Lord John made that very decided\r\ndeclaration against the Ballot, these people said they must go against\r\nthis; amongst others Sir Hussey Vivian who has pledged himself to\r\nit; and Lord Melbourne says if they should vote for it after Lord\r\nJohn’s declaration, either they or perhaps Lord John will resign, and\r\nthis “would make such gaps in the Government as would make it very\r\ndifficult to fill up; and Sir Hussey Vivian has written to Lord John\r\nthis morning, and he to me, saying I shall have to choose whether I\r\nwill accept Sir Hussey’s or his resignation.” Lord Melbourne however\r\nsaid he would see if he could manage it, which I fervently hope and\r\ntrust he will; but he is sadly teazed and plagued. He said, “There\r\nis a succession of difficulties in a Government....” At 20 m. to 7 I\r\nwent with Lady Portman, Lady Tavistock, Miss Cavendish, Miss Pitt,\r\nLord Conyngham, Lord Headfort, and Col. Buckley to Drury Lane theatre.\r\nWe came in before the performance had commenced. It was Shakespear’s\r\ntragedy of _Richard III._, and Charles Kean’s first appearance (in\r\nLondon) as Richard. The house was crammed to the ceiling; and the\r\napplause was tremendous when Kean came on; he was unable to make\r\nhimself heard for at least five minutes I should say. He was dressed\r\nexactly like his father, and all those who were with me, and who\r\nhad seen his father, were struck with the great resemblance to his\r\nfather both in appearance and voice. It would be impossible for me to\r\nattempt to describe the _admirable_ manner in which Kean delineated\r\nthe ferocious and fiend-like Richard. It was quite a _triumph_ and the\r\nlatter part particularly so; he was applauded throughout in the most\r\nenthusiastic manner. He acted with such spirit too! One of the best\r\nscenes was the one when the Lord Mayor urges him to accept the regal\r\nDignity, which Kean did uncommonly well. As also the disagreeable\r\nand absurd scene with Lady Anne. The manner in which he gave: “So\r\nmuch for Buckingham,” was truly _splendid_, and called down thunders\r\nof applause, as also many other of the scenes where he gets very\r\nmuch excited; he fought and died beautifully. He was uncommonly well\r\ndisguised, and looked very deformed and wicked. All the other parts\r\nwere very badly acted, and the three women were _quite detestable_. It\r\nis a fine, heart-stirring play, and there are some beautiful passages\r\nin it. I but just escaped being recognised, for as the curtain was\r\ndropping and I left the box, they called out “the Queen.”\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 6th February._—At 17 m. p. 2 came my kind friend Lord\r\nMelbourne who said he was better, and stayed with me till 20 m. p. 3.\r\nHe spoke to me about Mr. Roebuck’s[383] speech of last night; said “it\r\nwas a very bitter speech.” I told him what Lord John had written to me\r\nof what took place in the House of Commons last night. He spoke to me\r\nabout this Parliamentary Elections Bill; said it would he thought not\r\npass the House of Lords. Gave me an explanation about it, and about\r\npeople’s being unable to vote unless they had paid the rates up to the\r\nvery day; and that many people wanted to get rid of this; but the Lords\r\ndid not like that as they thought it was “meddling with the Reform\r\nBill.” I asked him if he had done anything more about the Ballot. He\r\nreplied that he had heard from Lord John this morning, who said they\r\nhad best wait the decision; he added that Lord John thinks he must\r\nresign if any of the others vote for the Ballot, as after his very\r\nstrong declaration against it, he would consider their voting for it\r\nas “passing a censure upon him”; Lord Melbourne said he did not quite\r\nthink that, and that he thought Lord John took it rather too seriously;\r\nbut he added: “Lord John does.” Lord Melbourne said he thinks it better\r\nnot to take much notice of who vote for or against it; and he added “we\r\ntook no notice of it when Lord Charles Fitzroy voted for it (Ballot)\r\nlast year; he is a very foolish man, I think.” I said to him that I\r\nbelieved the _Cabinet_ were all agreed upon this question; he replied\r\nthey were; “that is to say either to vote against its being made an\r\nopen question, or not to vote at all.” He added that Sir John Hobhouse\r\nand Mr. Poulett Thomson did not vote at all, having he believed pledged\r\nthemselves before they came into the Ministry.... Lord Melbourne told\r\nme he had dined at home the night before. Spoke to him about the play\r\nof _Richard III._, and of Kean; spoke of Richard III. himself, who\r\nhe (Ld. M.) believes to have been crooked and deformed, and to have\r\nmurdered the two young Princes; though, he said, that great pains had\r\nbeen taken to trace it all in the _Historical Doubts_ by Horace Walpole\r\nand to prove the contrary. He also mentioned the well-known old story\r\nof the old Countess of Desmond,[384] who “said she had danced with him”\r\n(Richard) “the night of his Coronation and that he was a very handsome\r\nman.” Spoke of the Duke of Wellington; he said “The Duke of Wellington\r\nis amazingly sensible to attention; nothing pleases him so much as if\r\none asks him his opinion about anything.” He added that many people\r\nwere offended with the Duke’s abrupt manner of speaking; I observed\r\nthat I thought that was only a manner, and that he did not mean it\r\nso. “No more do I,” replied Lord Melbourne. Spoke of Lord Ebrington,\r\nwho Lord Melbourne has known a long while and says is a clever man\r\nand possesses a considerable influence over Lord John; Lord Tavistock\r\nalso he added, has influence over his brother John; “but,” said Lord\r\nMelbourne, “Lord Tavistock has also got some strange notions; he lives\r\na great deal in the country; and people who live a great deal in the\r\ncountry pick up strange ideas.” I asked him if he thought there would\r\nbe much opposition to the Irish Poor Laws in the House of Lords. “I\r\nthink there will be none,” he said. “I don’t think there will be any\r\ndifficulty about any of the _Questions_—it’s only this Ballot.” I asked\r\nhim if he had seen Lord John about it. He replied that others had, but\r\nthat “I don’t like to speak to him about it; I feel rather awkward\r\nabout speaking to him about it, as last year he wanted me to make it\r\nan open question and I refused; and now that I want him to relax he\r\nwould say, ‘Why, what have you to say?’” He said Lord John was “very\r\nunbendable” about it. Lord Melbourne wanted him not to be so very\r\nparticular about it, and let them vote for or against it (its being an\r\nopen question) and not take much notice of it; but Lord John said that\r\nafter _his_ declaration _that_ would _affect him_. I asked who were the\r\nothers who wanted to vote for it. “Why, Sir Hussey Vivian is the one of\r\nthe greatest consequence, and Parnell,”[385] he replied. “The fact is,\r\nVivian should not have pledged himself; he carried his election in a\r\nway he should not have done.”\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 7th February._—Lord Melbourne said he had just been to see\r\nLord Durham “who wants more force.” He (Ld. D.) said that the Duke of\r\nWellington had told him he ought to have 75,000 men in Canada, to put\r\nit down. Lord Melbourne further told me that the Duke of Wellington\r\nhad been to see Lord Durham on Friday, he thinks; stayed with him for\r\nan hour and a half; had gone with him through the whole thing, had\r\ntold him how to manage the troops by sending them from one place to\r\nanother, and told him all his ideas of doing the thing. Lord Melbourne\r\nseemed quite pleased about it.[386] I showed Lord Melbourne a letter I\r\nhad got from Stockmar, about which Lord Melbourne said he would write\r\nto Stockmar. Spoke about my asking Sir Robert Peel &c. to dinner,\r\nwhich led us to speak about Lady Ashley, who, Lord Melbourne says,\r\nis decided in her politics, though not violent; she is a Tory; Lord\r\nMelbourne says she does not talk about it much; but he thinks she has\r\nat one time discussed it with her mother, who of course is a Whig; I\r\nsaid I supposed Lady Fanny had no ideas of her own about Politics; he\r\nreplied, “Why I think she is a Tory.” I was surprised; said laughing I\r\nthought it very wrong, and very odd, as all her brothers were Whigs.\r\nSpoke to him at dinner about various things; he told me Mr. Roebuck\r\nis a small man with “small finely cut features,” and that he speaks\r\nwell—“plainly, without ornament.”\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 8th February._—He said he thought there would be some debate\r\nin the H. of Lords about the third reading of the Canada bill tonight;\r\nhe thinks Lord Ellenborough[387] will speak. I asked him if he (Ld. E.)\r\nwas a clever man; he replied, “He is a disagreeable, conceited man,\r\nbut a clever man....” Lord Melbourne told me today that when he was as\r\nyoung as Lord Canning is now, he “was very shy”; “I think I was about\r\nas shy as anybody could be,” he said.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 9th February._—Got the following communication from Lord\r\nMelbourne. “The Canada Bill was read a third time yesterday evening\r\nwithout division, but after a Debate which lasted until ten o’clock.\r\nLord Ashburton[388] made a speech generally upon the subject of\r\nColonies, Lord Mansfield[389] made an elaborate attack upon the\r\nGovernment and in some measure complained of the Duke of Wellington\r\nand Sir Robert Peel for not having taken more active measures in\r\nopposition, and Lord Brougham repeated the observations which he had\r\nbefore made, with no diminution of vehemence. The speakers were Lord\r\nEllenborough, Lord Glenelg, Lord Ashburton, Lord Mansfield, Lord\r\nLansdowne, Lord Brougham, Lord Melbourne, Lord Fitzwilliam,[390]\r\nwho spoke with great kindness of the Government, but declared his\r\ndisapprobation of the Bill.” I asked Lord Melbourne the other day how\r\nmany Peers could constitute a House of Lords and be considered able\r\nto sit; he said _three_; and in the House of Commons 40 Members must\r\nbe present to make a House of Commons. I likewise asked him if there\r\nwas any particular form when a Peer takes his seat; he said _on his\r\ncreation_ there was a great deal of form; but on taking it in a new\r\nParliament or upon succeeding to the Title there was hardly any. “You\r\ngo up to the table,” he added, “take the oaths, pay the fees, and shake\r\nhands with the Chancellor.” Lord Melbourne also told me that any Peer\r\nmay bring in any bill and lay it upon the table, and it is generally\r\nread a first time; whereas “in the H. of Commons, they must always move\r\nfor leave to bring in a bill.” He said that Lord Ashburton had got that\r\n“fashionable theory” that it was better to give up the Colonies at\r\nonce when they became at all unquiet; which Lord Melbourne observed\r\nwith great justice, would be just the way to encourage them to revolt;\r\nfor they would then say, “Why, we have nothing to do but to revolt to\r\nget rid of our masters.” And “a very dangerous thing to declare,” Lord\r\nMelbourne observed. Spoke a long time about all this; then about George\r\nIV., who he said was not at all unhappy at Princess Charlotte’s death,\r\non the contrary, he was rather glad; spoke of her—of Uncle Leopold—her\r\nhappiness with him—her death—that she might have been saved if she had\r\nnot been so much weakened. I was delighted to see Lord Melbourne in\r\nvery good spirits, and very talkative, and _so_ agreeable! Spoke of\r\nmany things; of M. de Barante, the French Ambassador at St. Petersburg\r\nwho Lady Durham said she knew, as also his daughter who was separated\r\nfrom her husband and excited pity as he was known or supposed to have\r\nbeat her. Upon this Lord Melbourne said: “Why, it is almost worth while\r\nfor a woman to be beat, considering the exceeding pity she excites,”\r\nwhich made us laugh. Spoke of the dinner next day at the Lord Mayor’s,\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne said was called a private dinner of about 50 or\r\n60 persons, and which was generally very dull. He spoke of the Duke\r\nof Wellington, and, with tears in his eyes at the Duke’s friendliness\r\nto Lord Durham, about Canada. I asked him if it would do well if I\r\nasked Lord and Lady Francis Egerton[391] the same day as the Duke of\r\nWellington dined here; he replied extremely well, and that it would\r\n“be very agreeable to both.” I told him that I was very thankful to\r\nhim when he told me _who_ I should invite; he said, “I am afraid I\r\ndon’t attend enough to that; I am rather neglectful about it,” which\r\nI would not allow. Spoke about the Emperor of Austria—the Duchess of\r\nSutherland—her family; Lord Melbourne said she was naturally very\r\nproud; spoke about her house[392]; the lease of which she wishes to\r\nbuy, but which as it is Crown property Lord Melbourne said she could\r\nnot do; he dreaded the time when the Duchess should learn she could\r\nnot do so; that he was afraid of writing to her before she received\r\nthe formal answer from the Treasury; I told him, however, it would\r\nbe better if he did so, upon which he said: “Then it shall be done.”\r\nSpoke of Lady Ashley—Lady Hardwicke[393]—Lady Fanny; I asked him how\r\nshe came to be a Tory—and who could have made her so. He said, “Why, I\r\nthink her Nurse; people generally get their ideas in that way.” He told\r\nme he went to Eton when he was nine years old; he went there at Xmas\r\nin the year 1788, and stayed there till Midsummer 1796. Lord Holland\r\nleft Eton about 3 months after Lord Melbourne went there. He spoke\r\nmost cleverly and sensibly about Public Schools; said “I am not at all\r\nbigotted about a Public School”; said he was very happy at Eton; spoke\r\nof the many disadvantages and dangers of a Public School; amongst which\r\nhe mentioned the great habit of telling falsehoods which boys get to\r\ndo with impunity in order to save themselves from punishment; and the\r\ndisagreeable, bad, blackguard boys you were obliged to meet at such\r\nschools; and if a boy is weak, the liability of being led and governed\r\nby such boys; Lady Durham likewise entered into the conversation, and\r\nshe and Lord Melbourne and I went on discussing the subject for some\r\ntime; Lady Durham observed that it was a constant _War_ between boy and\r\nmaster at school, which however Lord Melbourne thought the same with\r\na Tutor; we all agreed that it was very bad that no French was taught\r\nat the Public Schools, for that boys never learnt it afterwards. Lady\r\nDurham said that Lord Durham had had a great mind that their boy should\r\nlearn no Latin at all, which however Lord Melbourne said he thought was\r\na bad thing, for that he thought a man could not get on well in the\r\nworld without Latin in the present state of society.[394] I told Lord\r\nMelbourne that though Lehzen had often said that she had _never_ seen\r\nsuch a passionate and naughty child as I was, still that I had never\r\ntold a falsehood, though I knew I would be punished; Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid: “That is a fine character”; and I added that Lehzen entrusted\r\nme with things which I knew she would not like me to tell again, and\r\nthat when I was ever so naughty, I never threatened to tell, or ever\r\ndid tell them. Lord Melbourne observed: “That is a fine trait.” I felt\r\nquite ashamed, on hearing this praise, that I had said so much about\r\nmyself. I asked him if his sister’s children had not been passionate\r\nwhen little. “Minny and Fanny were dreadfully passionate,” he said,\r\n“and now they have both very sweet tempers and are very calm.” I\r\nobserved to him that I was sure _he_ had never been so; he answered,\r\n“dreadfully passionate, and so I am now,” which I _would not_ and\r\n_cannot_ believe....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 13th February._—Lord M. spoke of the apparent cruelty,\r\nwhen a person is dying and is suffering dreadfully, and anything\r\nto hasten the end would be mercy and relief, that _that_ is not\r\nallowed, and is considered unjustifiable by law. I mentioned to Lord\r\nMelbourne a case in which it had been done; he told me an anecdote of\r\nNapoleon respecting this; when his great favourite and friend Duroc\r\nwas so frightfully wounded, the lower part of his body being carried\r\naway—Napoleon came to him, and Duroc implored him to give him laudanum\r\nto alleviate his sufferings and hasten his end, but Napoleon would not\r\ndo it, and said he could not sanction such a thing. Lord Melbourne\r\nobserved, “If they get the habit of doing such a thing” (hastening the\r\nend) “when a person is in a hopeless state, why, they _may_ do it when\r\na person is _not_ in a hopeless state.” Spoke of Lord Leveson[395]\r\nwho is such a very odd-looking young man; Lord Melbourne said that\r\nLady Granville “was always very ugly,” and that “she is _now_ better\r\nlooking than she used to be.” Spoke of large dogs, which Lord Melbourne\r\nthinks dangerous pets, as you are always so completely at their mercy\r\nif they choose to do you harm. Spoke of Lady Lilford,[396] Lord and\r\nLady Holland; the latter, Lord Melbourne says, always thinks _first_\r\nof herself and then of Lord Holland, who quite obeys her. I asked Lord\r\nMelbourne if Lord Glenelg was at all obstinate; he said not now, but\r\nthat he had been, and had given great trouble in ’30 or ’31, when he\r\nalone opposed in the Cabinet £25,000 being proposed as an outfit for\r\nthe Queen Dowager; and that Lord Grey had been obliged to go and tell\r\nthe King that he could not propose it, as Lord Glenelg was so much\r\nagainst it; Lord Melbourne said that neither the King or Queen ever\r\nforgave this and that the King could not _bear_ Lord Glenelg; he could\r\nneither bear Lord John Russell, who, Lord Melbourne said, he always\r\ncalled “that young man”; he also disliked Sir John Hobhouse, and Mr.\r\nPoulett Thomson, and latterly Lord Palmerston, though in the beginning\r\nhe liked him very much; Mr. S. Rice he liked pretty well; the Lord\r\nChancellor[397] very much, and always told Lord Melbourne that the\r\nLord Chancellor was “a kind good man”; Lord Dunraven[398] thought\r\nthe King liked him (Ld. D.), but Lord Melbourne said he thought the\r\nKing disliked him “at bottom,” though he was confidential with him. I\r\nasked Lord Melbourne if he did not see the King often? Lord Melbourne\r\nreplied not often, and never at Windsor latterly; that he was always\r\nvery civil to him, though not very open, and always very short. He\r\nsaid (that by the paper which Taylor wrote and gave me, and which Lord\r\nMelbourne has read) that the King had intended, in case the Ministry\r\nhad resigned (which Lord Melbourne said they had declared they would,\r\nabout the Irish Corporation Bill) to send a paper round to the Duke of\r\nWellington, Sir Robert Peel and Lord Melbourne calling upon them to\r\nform a Ministry. Lord Melbourne added: “He” (the late King) “was not at\r\nall a clever man; he was a very timid man; very easily frightened; in\r\nfact he was quite in Taylor’s hands; Taylor could turn him any way.”\r\nThis I observed was a wrong thing; Lord Melbourne said certainly it\r\nwas, “but considering the King’s character, and how difficult it was\r\nfor him to take a resolution, one cannot say it was an unfortunate\r\nthing.” I observed that Taylor turned the King to the Tory side; Lord\r\nMelbourne said: “The Tories don’t at all consider Taylor a friend.”\r\nI spoke of the unfortunate day in August ’36, when the King came to\r\nWindsor (after having prorogued Parliament) in a great passion. Lord\r\nMelbourne said this was caused by the King having set his mind upon\r\nhaving a Marine executed who was recommended to mercy; Lord Minto (whom\r\nthe King neither liked) came to Lord Melbourne in great distress and\r\nsaid: “The King will have this man hanged.” The King hated the Speaker,\r\nand told Lord Melbourne that all the time the Speaker was addressing\r\nhim in the House of Lords: “Shocking voice he has.”\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 14th February._—Lord M. told me that Lord John had written\r\nto him that he would be unable to attend the House of Commons next\r\nday, when this _anxious_ Ballot Question comes on. Lord Melbourne said\r\nhe did not think it quite a bad thing that Lord John would be away\r\nwhen this Ballot Question came on, as he thinks there will be less\r\nirritation if he is absent, and as Lord John is unwell and “worried\r\nabout the child,” Lord Melbourne observed he “might say something\r\nimprudent.” I think this all very true. Lord Melbourne was very funny\r\nabout caps and bonnets; he looked round the table and said, “There\r\nis an amazing cargo of bonnets and things come from Paris, I fancy,”\r\nwhich made us laugh; and he observed Lady Caroline’s hat and said he\r\nimagined that was something quite new. He spoke of Mdlle. Laure; we\r\n(Lady Durham and I) laughed very much and asked him how he knew about\r\nher; “They tell me of her,” he added, “and I fancy she has beautiful\r\nthings.” The Duke of Wellington was in very good spirits, but it\r\nstrikes me he is a good deal aged, particularly in appearance. Lady\r\nFrancis Egerton[399] is a clever, agreeable little person; and, though\r\nmuch altered, is still very pretty. I sat on the sofa with Lady Francis\r\nand Lady Durham[400]; Lord Melbourne sitting near me the whole evening;\r\nand Lord Francis not far from him; the other ladies were seated round\r\nthe table. We (Lord Melbourne, Lord Francis and I) spoke about German\r\nliterature—the weather—fires, the fire at Paris, &c., &c. Lord Francis\r\nis rather a silent person and it is not easy _de le mettre en train de\r\nparler_. I asked Lord Melbourne what the Duke of Wellington had told\r\nhim that made him (Ld. M.) laugh so much; Lord Melbourne then told me\r\nthe following anecdote of George IV., which caused the laughter. When\r\nGeorge IV. returned from Ireland, he was very sick and suffered a good\r\ndeal; and he stopped and rested at Badminton; upon this the Judge, who\r\nwas sitting at the Assizes at Gloucester, imagined that he could not\r\nhave a man executed when the King was in the County without asking\r\nhim about it, came over to Badminton and wished the King to hear the\r\ncase, which put the King into the greatest passion and he exclaimed,\r\n“What! am I to be followed all over the country with the Recorder’s\r\nreport?...” Spoke to Lord Melbourne about Lord John’s child, and the\r\nanxiety of having one child only. I observed to him however that I did\r\nnot think having more than one child lessened the anxiety about them;\r\nfor if persons loved their children, they would be just as anxious if\r\n_one_ of the many was ill, and would feel the loss of _one_ as much as\r\nif he or she had but that one. Lord Melbourne said he thought quite so\r\ntoo; but that somehow or other “if there are many, they have seldom\r\nanything the matter with them.” He added “it is not the right affection\r\nfor a child, if they love them only as being their heir, or for keeping\r\nup their name.” He said he was going home after he had left the Palace,\r\nas he had a great deal to do. He thinks his sister had better go out of\r\ntown, as she is not well, and out of spirits since she is in London. I\r\nspoke of sons-in-law and daughters-in-law and observed that I thought\r\ndaughters-in-law seldom got on well with their mothers-in-law, in which\r\nLord Melbourne quite agreed; whereas the sons-in-law they generally\r\nwere fond of. I asked him how his sister agreed with the young Lady\r\nCowper. “Pretty well,” he replied, “but I don’t think she forms any\r\nexception to the rule.” Lady Ashley and Lady Fanny, he said, liked\r\ntheir sister-in-law, but had also a certain feeling about it; “they\r\ndon’t like to see her in the same place where they used to see their\r\nmother.” Spoke of the very strange custom in Russia that on Easter\r\nSunday _everybody_ who chooses is allowed to _kiss_ the Empress,\r\nsaying at the same time “Christ is risen.” Lord Melbourne told me an\r\nanecdote of the Emperor of Russia. “He said to a sentinel, ‘Christ is\r\nrisen,’ and the man answered, ‘No, he is not’; the Emperor started and\r\nrepeated, ‘Christ is risen’; the man again said, ‘No, he is not, for\r\nI am a Jew.’ The Emperor said, ‘You are quite right.’” I was quite\r\nhappy to see the very amicable and friendly terms on which the Duke and\r\nmy excellent friend were; it is impossible for Lord Melbourne to be\r\notherwise almost with anybody, and the Duke having behaved very well\r\nlately, and being likewise an open, frank man, it renders it easy for\r\nthem to be so....\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 15th February._—I sat on the sofa with the Duchess of\r\nSutherland, the Duke of Sutherland and Lord Durham sitting near us.\r\nLord Durham spoke of the King of Greece[401]; says he is _remarkably_\r\nplain and mean-looking, very shy and awkward in society, and _en\r\nfin_ unable to do _anything_. The Sultan,[402] whom he also saw, he\r\ndescribes as a fine-looking but not “thorough-bred” looking man; short\r\nand dark, with an expression of treachery in his eyes....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 21st February._—At about a ¼ p. 2 I went into the Throne\r\nroom for the Levee with my Ladies &c., and all the Household and the\r\nMinisters being in the room. The only person who I was very anxious\r\nto see and whom I was much interested to have seen, was _O’Connell_,\r\nwho was presented, and of course, as everybody does when they are\r\npresented, kissed hands. He was in a full wig as one of the Queen’s\r\nCouncillors in Ireland, and not in the brown Brutus wig he generally\r\nwears. He is very tall, rather large, has a remarkably good-humoured\r\ncountenance, small features, small clever blue eyes, and very like\r\nhis caricatures; there were likewise two of his sons, Morgan and John\r\nO’Connell; his son-in-law, Mr. Fitzsimon, and his nephew John Morgan\r\nO’Connell. Lord Melbourne told me that one of my pensioners, a Sir John\r\nLade,[403] one of George IV.’s associates, was dead; spoke of him, of\r\nanother called George Lee; of old Mrs. Fox, who Lord Melbourne knew\r\nformerly; he said of Mr. Fox, “he took great notice of me.” Mr. Fox\r\ndied on the 13th of September 1806. Spoke of Nelson, &c., &c. He spoke\r\nof the Committee on the Pensions which was going on; that it was a\r\nvery fair Committee, and that there had only been a difficulty about\r\none case, which was a curious one, and which is a pension given to two\r\nFrench ladies, Madame de Rohan and Madame de Longueville, daughters\r\nof the Duc de Biron. Lord Melbourne told me how they came to get it,\r\nwhich is as follows, and in telling which he became quite affected\r\nand his eyes filled with tears. When Lord Rodney went to Paris just\r\nbefore he obtained his great victory, he was arrested for debt, as\r\n(Lord Melbourne said) he was always without a shilling in the world;\r\nand the Duc de Biron said, “Though we are enemies, still it is too bad\r\nthat a great English officer should be arrested for debt here,” and he\r\npaid his debts for him. Afterwards when the Duc de Biron’s daughters,\r\nMmes. de Rohan and Longueville, who are the first nobility in France,\r\ngot into distress, they sent a statement to George III. of what their\r\nfather had done for Lord Rodney, and George III. gave them a pension.\r\nSpoke of O’Connell, and George IV., to whose Levee in Dublin he\r\n(O’Connell) went; Lord Melbourne said that O’Connell declared he heard\r\nGeorge IV. distinctly say (when he passed) to some one, “God damn him.”\r\nLord Melbourne said that George IV. was in a very awkward position\r\nwhen he was in Ireland, for that the whole country was in a ferment\r\nof enthusiasm believing the King to be for the Catholic Emancipation,\r\nwhereas in his heart he was against it. I said to Lord Melbourne that\r\nthere was rather a disagreeable business about Lord Durham’s wishing\r\nme to receive Lady —— at Court, which, if she had been refused at\r\nthe late Court, it would, I feared, be impossible for me to do. Lord\r\nMelbourne said, “It will not do for you to reverse a sentence passed\r\nby the late Court in the beginning of your reign; I quite agree with\r\nyou that you cannot do this.” He said that in general with respect\r\nto receiving people it was better to go according to what had been\r\ndetermined by a Court of Justice and if there was nothing against them\r\nthere, to receive them and not to inquire into what their early lives\r\nhad been[404]....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 23rd February._—I lamented my being _so_ short, which Lord M.\r\nsmiled at and thought no misfortune. Spoke to him of the Levée, the\r\nplace where I stood which some people objected to, which led him to\r\nspeak of the old Court in the time of George III., when a Levee and\r\nalso a Drawing-room was like an Assembly; the King and Queen used to\r\ncome into the room where the people were already assembled, and to walk\r\nround and speak to the people; they did not speak to everybody, and\r\nit was considered no offence, he said, if they did not. He said Queen\r\nCharlotte spoke English with a little accent, but that it was rather\r\npretty. I asked him when he first went to Court; he said in the year\r\n1803, he thought; it was at the time when everybody volunteered their\r\nservices and when he was in a Volunteer Corps. Spoke of Lord Howe, his\r\nremaining about the Queen[405]; and when he was made to resign. Lord\r\nMelbourne said he (Ld. H.) seldom voted but that when he voted against\r\nthe Reform Bill, Lord Grey was urged by an outcry from “his people”\r\nto press his (Ld. Howe’s) removal, which Lord Melbourne said was very\r\nunwise; Lord Grey went down to Windsor, and told the King of it, which\r\nalarmed the King a good deal; they (the King and Lord Grey) discussed\r\nwith Taylor how it should be done; Lord Grey proposed his seeing the\r\nQueen upon it, which Taylor said never would do, and that the only way\r\nwas to send for Lord Howe and make him resign, which he (Ld. H.) said\r\nhe would do. Lord Melbourne said that the Queen had just come home from\r\nriding and was half undressed when Lord Howe sent to say he must see\r\nthe Queen; she said she would see him when she was dressed; whereupon\r\nLord Howe sent again to her saying the affair was so urgent that he\r\nmust see her immediately; she buttoned up her habit again and saw him;\r\nhe gave her the key and said he must resign, which Lord Melbourne said\r\nmade the Queen very angry and rendered her still more hostile to Lord\r\nGrey’s Government than she already was....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 27th February._—I said to Lord Melbourne that Uncle Leopold\r\nwas amazingly frightened when the Prince of Orange came over with his\r\nsons, as he always imagined that the late King had _some intentions_\r\nabout that; (meaning a marriage between me and one of the young\r\nPrinces.) “And so he had,” said Lord Melbourne decidedly. “He sounded\r\nme about it,” and Lord Melbourne wrote to him (the late King) to say\r\nthat in a political point of view, he did not think it a desirable\r\nthing; that the country would not like a connection with Holland; the\r\nKing was much disappointed at this, Lord Melbourne said; he (the King)\r\nhad always a fear about a marriage; he was afraid Mamma had intentions,\r\nwhich I observed she certainly had; and that the King therefore thought\r\n“he must _dévancer_ her”; that Lord Melbourne told him, if he wished\r\nsuch a thing he had better be sure first if the _Parties_ themselves\r\nliked it; for that he never could force such a thing; of which Lord\r\nMelbourne said the King never seemed sensible; at which I laughed.\r\nHe said that the Prince of Orange also came to him (Ld. M.) from the\r\nKing, and asked him if he or the Government had any objection to such\r\na connection. “Personally,” Lord Melbourne said to him, “there could\r\nbe no objection; no more than to any other Prince in Europe”; but at\r\nthe same time he must tell him that his (the Prince’s) country was so\r\nsituated that it would be constantly involved in war if any war was\r\nto break out; “I told him as much as that,” Lord Melbourne said, “and\r\nthat I could not say anything until we saw it in some sort of shape or\r\nother.” This was all very curious and interesting for me to hear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.R.H. The Duchess of Kent_\r\n\r\n  _from a portrait by Stone_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n  The early months of the year 1838 found Lord Melbourne’s Government\r\n  in considerable difficulties. For legislative purposes the\r\n  Parliamentary majority was impotent. It was just able to keep the\r\n  Ministry afloat. “The Queen,” wrote Lord Palmerston, “is as steady\r\n  to us as ever, and was in the depth of despair when she thought we\r\n  were in danger of being turned out.”\r\n\r\n  This was a year of grave trouble in Canada, but, as it turned out,\r\n  a year full of promise for the subsequent welfare of that great\r\n  Dominion, and for her connection with the Mother-country. The Queen\r\n  was undoubtedly attracted by Lord Durham, the Governor-General,\r\n  who, although impulsive and impatient of restraint, possessed\r\n  charms of manner and appearance, together with intellectual gifts,\r\n  which rendered his personality agreeable to those with whom he was\r\n  brought in contact. The Queen showed great kindness to him and Lady\r\n  Durham before their departure for Canada. She regretted his return,\r\n  and was grieved by the quarrel between him and her Ministers.\r\n\r\n  Although during this year the Queen was in the habit of taking long\r\n  rides into the country, which were found to be very beneficial to\r\n  her health, she worked hard, and she laboriously read, under Lord\r\n  Melbourne’s guidance, masses of despatches and correspondence. At\r\n  no time during her reign was she more persistent in following the\r\n  course of public business.\r\n\r\n  She was now brought a good deal into contact with Lord Palmerston,\r\n  and was undoubtedly attracted by his great gifts, although at\r\n  a later period of her reign his administrative methods and\r\n  high-handed independence occasioned her much anxiety and led to\r\n  strong remonstrance.\r\n\r\n  In the month of April, King Leopold was engaged in suggesting to\r\n  the Queen the possibility of a union between her and Prince Albert\r\n  of Saxe-Coburg. He wrote constantly to her upon this topic, laying\r\n  stress upon the young Prince’s goodness and distinction, and upon\r\n  his great anxiety to see his intellectual and moral training\r\n  perfected under the auspices of Baron Stockmar.\r\n\r\n  In the course of the spring the preparations for the Queen’s\r\n  Coronation were commenced, and she took keen interest in the detail\r\n  of that ceremonial. It was a somewhat delicate matter to avoid\r\n  having to invite her Uncle King Leopold and Queen Louise, but a\r\n  hint having been dropped to the King of the Belgians, he speedily\r\n  realised that the custom of not including crowned heads in the\r\n  invitations to a Coronation was sound and worth preserving. “On\r\n  mature reflection,” he wrote, “I think that a King and Queen at\r\n  your dear Coronation might perhaps be a _hors d’œuvre_.” To this\r\n  view the Queen graciously assented.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                                 1838\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 6th March._—It was Mr. Bulwer’s play of _The Lady of Lyons_;\r\nand we came in very soon after the beginning. I think the play\r\nacts well, and I like it. Macready acted well as Claude Melnotte,\r\nBartley[406] was very good as Damas; and Meadows[407] as Glavis. Mr.\r\nElton[408] acted fairly enough as the wicked Beauséant.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 7th March._—Dressed for riding. At a few m. p. 12 I _rode_\r\nout with Lord Conyngham, Lord Uxbridge, dear Lehzen, Miss Cavendish,\r\nCol. Cavendish, and Sir G. Quentin and Mr. Fozard. I mounted in the\r\ngarden just under the terrace in order that nobody should know I was\r\ngoing to ride out. I rode my dear favourite Tartar who went perfectly\r\nand _most delightfully_, never shying, never starting through all the\r\n_very_ noisy streets, rattling omnibuses—carts—carriages, &c., &c. I\r\nquite _love_ him. We rode out through the garden, through the gate on\r\nConstitution Hill; round the park by the water, out at the new gate, by\r\nLord Hill’s former villa, a good way on the Harrow Road, I should say\r\nwithin 4 or 5 miles of Harrow—then down a pretty narrow lane where one\r\ncould fancy oneself 2 or 300 miles from London, out by Willesden Field\r\n(where I had never been), and Kilburn, down the Edgware Road—Connaught\r\nPlace, through omnibuses, carts, &c., &c., in at Cumberland Gate,\r\ngalloped up to Hyde Park Corner—and in at the same garden gate at\r\nConstitution Hill, and safely to the Palace at 10 m. to 3. It was a\r\nlovely day, a beautiful and delicious ride, and I have come home quite\r\ncharmed and delighted. I rode between Lord Conyngham and Col. Cavendish\r\nthe whole way. Dearest Lehzen rode Rosa and felt all the better for\r\nthe ride. Wrote my journal. Signed. Walked about. At ½ p. 4 came my\r\nkind and excellent Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 20 m. p. 5.\r\nHe spoke to me about my ride; said he had just come from the Cabinet,\r\nwhich was about these Canadian prisoners[409]; viz. what is to be done\r\nwith them; the revolt being put down they cannot be tried by Martial\r\nLaw, and there is great difficulty as to what is to be done with them.\r\nI said to Lord Melbourne I hoped he was not tired from last night; he\r\nsaid not at all. He said: “I am not quite so sure of to-night; I think\r\nwe shall carry it, but you must not be surprised if it should be the\r\nother way.” I coloured very much at this honest, frank avowal of our\r\nfears, from this best and kindest of friends; and tears were nearer\r\nthan words to me at that moment....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 13th March._—I asked Lord Melbourne what was to take place\r\nconcerning Slavery to-night.[410] Lord Melbourne then pulled out of his\r\npocket the Bill or Act which is to be read to-night; he read to me the\r\nprincipal Heads of it explaining to me each part in the _most clear and\r\nagreeable_ manner possible. I shall not have time or space to explain\r\nor name _each_ head here, but before I do any, I must just observe that\r\nthe necessity of this Act shows how shockingly cruel and cheating the\r\nMasters of the Slaves are, attempting to evade in every possible way\r\nwhat they are told to do, and what, as the Laws cannot be enforced on\r\nthe spot, must be done by an Act of Parliament here.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 14th March._— ... I asked Lord Melbourne how he liked my\r\ndress. He said he thought it “very pretty” and that “it did very well.”\r\nHe is so natural and funny and nice about _toilette_ and has a very\r\ngood taste I think....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 17th March._—Spoke of the Cabinet, which was just over; he\r\nsaid that they had been speaking about the Coronation in the Cabinet;\r\nand they all thought that it would be best to have it about the 25th\r\nor 26th of June, as it would end the Parliament well and make a good\r\nbreak; that it would be best to have it like William IV.’s, which would\r\nbe less long. I of course agreed to this....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 21st March._—Heard from Lord Melbourne that “the House sat\r\ntill ½ past eleven last night. Lord Stanhope made a long declamatory\r\nspeech, very violent, but having in it nothing defined or specific, and\r\nwas answered by Lord Brougham in a most able and triumphant defence and\r\nmaintenance of the late Act for amending the laws for the relief of\r\nthe Poor. Lord Melbourne was very sorry to be prevented from waiting\r\nupon Your Majesty. He is very grateful for Your Majesty’s enquiries and\r\nfeels very well this morning....” Spoke of Portugal; Lord Melbourne\r\nwas very much pleased with the good news, and with the Queen’s\r\nconduct.[411] I then saw Lord Palmerston, who was in high spirits at\r\nthe good news from Portugal. The Levée was over at 3. I then went for a\r\nmoment to the dressing-room to ease my head, as my diadem (which Lord\r\nMelbourne thought “very handsome”) hurt me so dreadfully. After this\r\nI invested (in the Closet) the Marquis of Breadalbane[412] with the\r\nOrder of the Thistle; Sir Thomas Bradford[413] with the Grand Cross\r\nof the Bath; and Lord Burghersh[414] and General Donald McLeod were\r\nmade Knights Commanders of the Order of the Bath. My Ladies, my whole\r\nHousehold and all the Ministers were present at this ceremony.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 22nd March._—Lord Melbourne said he had been to see the\r\nDuke of Wellington this morning about asking him to be at the head of\r\na Commission to be appointed to inquire into the promotions in the\r\nArmy and in the Marines, which were so very slow in the time of peace\r\nand about which they were being attacked in the House of Commons. Lord\r\nMelbourne said the Duke had consented to it; and that his being at the\r\nhead of it “will give it authority”; the Duke wished to know who was\r\nto be in the Commission; Lord Melbourne named them to him and he was\r\nvery well satisfied with them. Lord Melbourne told me some of them,\r\nwhich are: Lord Hill, Sir Hussey Vivian, Sir Alexander Dickson,[415]\r\nSir Thomas Hardy,[416] the First Lord of the Admiralty,[417] and the\r\nSecretary at War.[418] Lord Melbourne said, with the tears in his eyes\r\n(kind, excellent man), that the Duke was in very good humour, and “a\r\nvery pleasant man to do business with, I think; he is so plain and\r\nspeaks to the point.” The Duke had been reviewing the Battalions which\r\nare going to Canada, and praised them very much, and said “particularly\r\nmy regiment.” The Duke said that Lord Brougham’s speech on the Poor\r\nLaws was the best he ever heard him make. I told Lord Melbourne that\r\n_Diet_ was the best physician for him; he said laughing, he drank\r\ntoo much _champagne_, and I added, mixed too many wines; at which he\r\nlaughed a good deal. Spoke of the Queen Dowager who he is going to\r\nsee at ½ p. 1 on Saturday; spoke of my calling her Queen Adelaide and\r\nnot Queen Dowager, as it was painful to people to receive that name.\r\nSpoke of all changes of that kind; of the Queen Dowager’s having signed\r\n“_Subject_” to me the day after the King died.[419]\r\n\r\n_Friday, 23rd March._—Lord Cowper is very shy and reserved and speaks\r\nbut little. He really is the image of his mother,[420] and has exactly\r\nthe same voice and manner of speaking. The cut of the features is so\r\nexactly his mother’s—he looks delicate and is very thin; he has a\r\nmild and pleasing countenance. Lord Melbourne spoke to me of these\r\nPortuguese despatches which he had not yet seen. He said: “I am very\r\nglad the Queen has shown courage; it gives confidence....”\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 25th March._—I said I had heard from Uncle Leopold, who seems\r\na good deal vexed at this recommencement of this Belgian Question; we\r\nspoke of this and Lord Melbourne said: “I don’t like it at all; I think\r\nwe shall get into a quarrel somehow or other, which is a bad thing.”\r\nHe said Uncle Leopold had written to Lord Palmerston about this and\r\nabout this Portuguese Affair; Lord Melbourne said that Uncle wrote that\r\npeople complained and with truth that Ferdinand did not show himself;\r\nupon which Dietz[421] wrote that a King should not show himself when\r\nhis subjects are spilling their blood. Whereupon Uncle observed:\r\nthat was a very fine German sentiment, but that if Louis Philippe\r\nhad followed that principle, he would have lost his head like Louis\r\nxvi.... Of the late hurricane in Ireland; Lord Melbourne said trees\r\nnever grew so well in Ireland and were all a little bent from the wind\r\nblowing across the Atlantic. He dislikes trees near a house, and he is\r\nvery fond of thinning trees. Spoke of Claremont and the trees there.\r\nWe then spoke of _names_ (Xtian names) for a long while, about which\r\nLord Melbourne was very amusing and very funny. He said Lady Ashley\r\nwas always called _Minny_. He said: “I think Mary beautiful.” We spoke\r\nof Molly; “Molly is beautiful; it’s such a soft word, there are more\r\nliquids in it than in almost any word.” Then _Bess_ he thinks “quite\r\nbeautiful,” as also _Jane_, and _Kate_, and _Alice_; “Jane and Joan,”\r\nhe said, “are John.” “Louisa,” he says, “is a fastidious name....”\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 27th March._—At ½ p. 12 I rode out with Lord Conyngham, Lord\r\nUxbridge, Lord Byron,[422] Lady Mary, dearest Lehzen, Miss Cavendish,\r\nMiss Quentin, Sir F. Stovin and Col. Cavendish, and came home at ½ p.\r\n3, having ridden 22 MILES!!! We rode very hard and Tartar went MOST\r\ndelightfully, NEVER was there SUCH a dear horse. We rode to Richmond,\r\nthrough part of the Richmond Park, out at Robin Hood Gate, and home\r\nover Wimbledon Common and Vauxhall Bridge. It was as hot as summer, and\r\n_going_ I thought I should have melted; coming over Wimbledon Common\r\nthere was some delicious air. It was a heavenly day. At 6 m. p. 4 came\r\nLord Melbourne and stayed with me till 20 m. to 5. He seemed well.\r\nSpoke a good deal of my ride. The Debate lasted till 11 last night,\r\nand he dined and stayed at home. Spoke of the Archbishop’s having made\r\na long speech last night about the Indian Worship; spoke of that.\r\nSpoke of the Duke of Sussex and what he told me about the rank a Prime\r\nMinister should have, viz. that of Lord High Treasurer; Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid: “I think it had better remain as it is.”[423]\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 28th March._—Spoke of my ride; of Mr. Bulwer’s novels,\r\n_none_ of which Lord Melbourne has read. Lady Durham said it was very\r\nodd that so clever a man should be vain about his personal appearance.\r\nLord Melbourne replied: “I think clever people generally have more of\r\nthose weaknesses than others.” Lord Melbourne said: “I always predicted\r\nhe would be a genius when he was a boy; and I was sure he would make\r\na figure; he used to come over to Brocket when he was 17, and show me\r\nhis poetry.” I asked Lord Melbourne if he was fond of novels; he said\r\n“very fond,” but that he had no time to read them now. Spoke of Lady\r\nWilhelmina, who Lord Melbourne says is certainly much grown since last\r\nyear. I said “Everybody grows but me.” He laughed and said, “I think\r\nyou are grown....”\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 29th March._—I showed Lord Melbourne a bracelet with my\r\nportrait by Ross in it, which I’m going to give Lady Durham, which he\r\nthought very like.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 30th March._—Got up at 10 m. to 10, and breakfasted at a\r\n¼ to 11. Heard from Lord John before breakfast, that Sir George\r\nStrickland[424] brought on this Motion for emancipating the Apprentices\r\nthis year, last night, and was seconded by Mr. Pease[425] (the Quaker).\r\nSir George Grey[426] made a speech of 2 hours and fifty minutes, and\r\ncompletely exhausted the subject. The speech was a very able one and\r\nLord John thinks will change many Votes.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 1st April._—I told him of the Duke of Cambridge and what\r\nhe had said about his wish of going to the Emperor of Austria’s\r\nCoronation; and also that he said he could not dine with me on\r\nTuesday, but _invited himself_ to dine with me another day _without_\r\nthe Duchess; Lord Melbourne laughed and said, “That’s very odd; Your\r\nMajesty should have said ‘That’s not right.’” Spoke of Little Holland\r\nHouse, which Lord Melbourne says is quite near Holland House and a\r\nvery nice place, with a very pretty garden; spoke of Miss Fox, Lord\r\nHolland’s sister, who is such an amiable person; we were not sure of\r\nher age; Lord Melbourne said she was grown up when he was a boy at\r\nschool; spoke of Lady Holland, who has been very handsome though he\r\nalways remembers her very large; and she has a vulgar mouth and used\r\nalways to say, “A vulgar ordinary mouth I have.” Spoke of her and Lady\r\nLilford, who, Lord Melbourne said laughing, “never had the use of her\r\nlegs.” Lady Holland is about 68, he thinks; she was married in 1786 to\r\nher 1st husband, Sir Godfrey Webster, when she was only 16. Spoke of\r\nPortugal &c....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 2nd April._—I said to Lord Melbourne I was so stupid that I\r\nmust beg him to explain to me about Sir William Follett[427] again;\r\nhe answered very kindly, “It is not stupid, but I daresay you can’t\r\nunderstand it,” and he explained it to me like a _kind_ father would\r\ndo to his child; he has something so fatherly, and so affectionate\r\nand kind in him, that one must love him.... I rode Lord Uxbridge’s\r\nlittle horse, which I have Christened _Uxbridge_, and which is the most\r\ncharming, delightful, quiet horse possible. It has a most beautiful\r\nlittle head, is of a dark chestnut colour, if possible quieter than\r\nTartar, for it never takes notice of anything; full of spirit, and\r\nvery easy and pleasant in its canter which is faster than Tartar’s. It\r\nis delightful to have two such horses as Tartar and Uxbridge. It was\r\na very warm, bright, clear, pleasant day. We rode to Hanwell through\r\nActon; home by Castle Hill, Acton again, and in at the Victoria Gate,\r\nand home by the garden gate; we rode about 19 or 20 miles. When we were\r\nnear Notting Hill, or rather more at Brookgreen, I sent on a groom to\r\ninform Lord Melbourne (who told me last night he would come to me at\r\n_four_ today), that I should be at home in a few minutes; but when I\r\ncame home, they said Lord Melbourne had been at the gate a few minutes\r\nbefore, and on hearing I was still out, said “Very well,” and walked\r\nhis horse away. I waited in my habit till 5, the hour for the House of\r\nLords, when I felt that my good Lord Melbourne could not come, and I\r\nwrote to him. It is my own fault....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 4th April._—Spoke of the Coronation, and the fuss the\r\nPrincesses were in about their robes; I told Lord Melbourne that the\r\nDuchess of Gloucester had offered to hold the tip of my train when\r\nI was being crowned, as the Duchess of Brunswick had done for Queen\r\nCharlotte, and that I thought this very kind of the Duchess; which\r\nquite touched my good friend. Spoke of Hanwell, and rail-roads; I said\r\nI feared there were so many rail-roads that they could not all answer;\r\nLord Melbourne said he feared they would not, but that he was sorry for\r\nit, as he was engaged in one. “I was fool enough to engage in one and\r\nto take 50 shares; I have already paid £1,000, and have lately had a\r\ncall for £500 more,” he added. This rail-road is in Nottingham and he\r\nengaged in it about 4 years ago. I asked him if he liked rail-roads in\r\ngeneral; he replied, “I don’t care about them,” which made me laugh;\r\nand he added that they were bad for the country as they brought such a\r\nshocking set of people “who commit every horror.” “They are picked men,\r\nwho mind neither Lord nor laws, and commit every species of violence;\r\nnothing is safe,” he added; and “it’s more like a country in time of\r\nwar” than peace. He spoke of Dorsetshire to Lady Portman, and she said\r\nit was so poor; he replied, “That’s because you don’t give enough\r\nwages.”\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 5th April._—Spoke of Lady Burghersh[428]; Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid, “She is of a great deal of use to us, in a quiet way”; for if he\r\nwished to communicate with the Duke of Wellington, he did it through\r\nher; he, of course, does not wish me to mention this; but I hope I _am_\r\ndiscreet and tell but little of what he tells to me. Lady Burghersh is\r\na sensible, clever woman, and has great influence over the Duke.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 6th April._—Spoke of my ride; rail-roads; that the\r\nSteam-Carriage could not be stopped under 150 yards’ distance of an\r\nobject; I observed that these Steam-Carriages are very dangerous; Lord\r\nMelbourne said, “Oh! none of these modern inventions consider human\r\nlife.” Spoke of Col. Cavendish and Sir George Quentin; of horses;\r\nLord Melbourne said his mare would not be well enough to come down\r\nto Windsor, but that he could get a horse from me there, to ride. I\r\nobserved that Mr. Cowper complained he (Ld. M.) never rode the horses\r\nhe should ride; “I don’t know, he never got me a horse I liked; I don’t\r\nthink he is a very good hand at horses.” Lord Melbourne said Mr. Fred\r\nByng[429] got him his present black mare; he hears a horse-dealer has\r\ngot a horse which he thinks will do for him; the price is 160 guineas,\r\nwhich he says is nothing if the horse is a good one; but a good deal\r\nif it is a bad one.... Spoke of Byron, who Lord Melbourne said would\r\nnot be 50 if he were alive[430]; he said he was extremely handsome;\r\nhad dark hair, was very lame and limped very much; I asked if the\r\nexpression of his countenance was agreeable; he said not; “he had a\r\nsarcastic, sardonic expression; a contemptuous expression.” I asked if\r\nhe was not agreeable; he said “He could be excessively so”; “he had a\r\npretty smile”; “treacherous beyond conception; I believe he was fond of\r\ntreachery.” Lord Melbourne added, “he dazzled everybody,” and deceived\r\nthem; “for he could tell his story very well....” Lord Melbourne said,\r\n“The old King (George III.) had that hurried manner; but he was a\r\nshrewd, acute man, and most scrupulously civil.” He added that the\r\nKing was rather tall, red in the face, large though not a corpulent\r\nman; prejudiced and obstinate beyond conception; spoke of the old Duke\r\nof Gloucester who, he said, was not a clever man but a good-natured\r\nman, though very proud; of the Duchess of Gloucester his wife; Lord\r\nMelbourne said that Horace Walpole tells that one day _he_ (I think)\r\ngave the Duke of Gloucester a fête at Strawberry Hill; and the Duchess\r\ncame over before to see that all was right; and when she came there\r\nshe saw that the host had put up her arms with the Duke’s; she said,\r\n“God bless me! this will never do; you must take this down directly,\r\nthis will never do; the Duke would be extremely angry were he to see\r\nthis.” The Duchess was a Walpole by birth[431]; she was first married\r\nto Lord Waldegrave; her children by that marriage were beautiful; they\r\nwere Elizabeth, Lady Waldegrave,[432] Lady Euston,[433] and Lady Hugh\r\nSeymour, who was mother to Sir Horace Seymour.[434] “People were very\r\nfond of her,” Lord Melbourne said....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 8th April._—Lord Melbourne looked over one of the Volumes\r\n(the sixth) of a Work called “Lodge’s Portraits”; there are portraits\r\nof all sorts of famous people in it, with short Memoirs of them\r\nannexed to them. Lord Melbourne looked carefully over each, reading\r\nthe accounts of the people and admiring the prints. I wish I had\r\ntime to write down all the clever observations he made about _all_.\r\nIt is quite _a delight_ for me to hear him speak about all these\r\nthings; he has such _stores_ of knowledge; such a wonderful memory;\r\nhe knows about everybody and everything; _who_ they were, and _what_\r\nthey did; and he imparts all his knowledge in such a _kind_ and\r\nagreeable manner; it does me a _world_ of good; and his conversations\r\nalways _improve_ one greatly. I shall just name a few of the people\r\nhe observed upon:—_Raleigh_, which he thought a very handsome head;\r\n_Hobbes_, who was “an infidel philosopher”; he had been tutor to one of\r\nthe Earls of Devonshire,[435] he said; _Knox_—Lord Melbourne observed\r\nthat those Scotch Reformers were very violent people; but that Knox\r\ndenied having been so harsh to Mary of Scots as she said he had been;\r\n_Lord Mansfield_, who, he said, “was great-uncle” to the present Lord;\r\n_Melanchthon_, whose name means Black Earth in Greek, and whose head\r\nhe admired; _Pitt_, whose print Lord Melbourne said was very like;\r\n“he died in 1806 when I came into Parliament.” He (Ld. M.) came in\r\nfor Leominster. _Wesley_; Lord Melbourne said the greatest number of\r\nDissenters were Wesleyans; he read from the book that there were (at\r\nhis death) 135,000 of his followers; _Porson_,—Lord Melbourne said,\r\n“I knew him; he was a great Greek scholar,” and looking at the print,\r\n“it’s very like him.” _Leibnitz_, a great German philosopher, and a\r\ncorrespondent of Queen Caroline, wife to George II.; spoke of her being\r\nso learned and her whole court too; “the Tories laughed at it very\r\nmuch”; and Swift ridiculing the Maids of Honour wrote, “Since they talk\r\nto Dr. Clark, They now venture in the Dark.” _Addison_; Lord Melbourne\r\nadmires his “Spectator,” his “Cato” he also admires, but says it’s\r\nnot like a Roman tragedy; “there is so much love in it.” Addison died\r\nat Holland House; he disagreed very much with his wife, Lady Warwick.\r\nHolland House was built, he said, by Rich, Lord Holland, in the reign\r\nof Charles 1st.[436] _Madame de Staël_, whose print he thought very\r\nlike; “she had good eyes, she was very vain of her arms.” She was over\r\nhere in ’15, and died in ’17, aged 51; she disliked dying very much;\r\nLord Melbourne also knew her daughter the Duchesse de Broglie; he said,\r\n“Louis Philippe dislikes _her_ as much as Napoleon did _her Mother_.”\r\nLord Melbourne saw Madame de Broglie for a moment when he was at Paris\r\nfor the last time in 1825. He read from the book, with great emphasis,\r\nthe following passage, what Napoleon said of Madame de Staël: “They\r\npretend that she neither talks politics nor mentions me; but I know\r\nnot how it happens that people seem to like me less after visiting\r\nher.” _Queen Elizabeth_; spoke of her, and that her Mother must have\r\nbeen very handsome. Lady Holland, he told me, has the greatest fear of\r\ndying; spoke of pictures; Lord Melbourne does not admire Murillo much,\r\nnor Rubens; he so greatly prefers the Italian Masters to any others;\r\nspoke of subjects for painting; of the Holy Family being constantly\r\npainted; “After all,” he said, “a woman and child is the most beautiful\r\nsubject one can have.” He is going down alone to Brocket; I told him\r\nhis sister thought Brocket so cold, and that she wanted him to put\r\nup stoves, which he said would “burn down the house.” “I reduced the\r\ngrates,” he continued, “because I thought they gave heat enough; and\r\nso they do, if they make large fires; but they don’t know how to make\r\nfires.” He can’t bear Brocket in winter. He was going home and did not\r\nfeel tired any more. He spoke of my riding very kindly. Stayed up till\r\na ¼ p. 11. It was a most delightful evening.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 9th April._—I showed him letters of thanks from Lords\r\nFitzwilliam and Dundas and Captain Sykes, relative to my having repaid\r\nto the two first-named the debt incurred by my poor father and owing\r\nto their late fathers; and to the latter the debt owing to himself,\r\naccompanied by gifts. Lord Melbourne observed my sleeves (which were\r\nvery long) with astonishment, and said “Amazing sleeves!...”\r\n\r\n_Monday, 16th April._—Lord Melbourne told me that there were very\r\nstrange accounts of Lord Brougham and all he was _saying_ and _doing_\r\nat Paris; his having gone to see Louis Philippe at 11 o’clock at night,\r\nwhen the Swiss Guard were (as they always are) asleep on the staircase;\r\nthey stopped him (Brougham), saying the King was gone to bed; upon\r\nwhich Brougham observed that their King had “very rustic habits.” Spoke\r\nof him, his visiting Lady Fitzharris[437]; Lord Melbourne spoke of\r\nBrougham and his oddities; of this Review which he (B.) has written and\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne thinks “well done.” He thinks Queen Charlotte and\r\nGeorge III. very harshly handled in it, and Queen Caroline amazingly\r\npuffed up; the Duke of York’s character he thinks the best done; he\r\nsays there is a great deal which Brougham seems not to know; spoke of\r\nGeorge IV.’s character, not being understood; of Sir William Knighton’s\r\nMemoirs which are just published, and which Lord Melbourne thinks it\r\nvery wrong in Lady Knighton[438] to have published; of George IV. being\r\nso completely in the hands of Knighton, &c., &c. I felt very unhappy at\r\ndinner, in spite of my being gay when I spoke, and I could have cried\r\nalmost at every moment; so much so, that when I got into bed, my nerves\r\n(which had been more shaken by the loss of _dearest_ Louis,[439] than\r\nI can express, and by the struggle when in company to overcome _grief_\r\nwhich I felt so acutely) could resist no longer, and more than half an\r\nhour elapsed, in tears, before I fell asleep. And before I was asleep\r\nI saw her, in my imagination, before me, dressed in her neat white\r\nmorning gown, sitting at her breakfast in her room at Claremont; again,\r\nstanding in my room of an evening, dressed in her best, holding herself\r\nso erect, as she always did, and making the low dignified curtsey so\r\npeculiar to herself; and lastly on her death-bed, pale and emaciated,\r\nbut the expression the same, and the mind vigorous and firm as ever!\r\nThese were the images I beheld as I lay in bed! Yet, mingled with my\r\ngrief were feelings of thankfulness that her end was so peaceful—so\r\nhappy!...\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 21st April._—I showed Lord Melbourne the plans for changing\r\nthe Slopes and making a new walk, and we looked over them for some time\r\ntogether. We then spoke of what _might_ have happened when the Duke of\r\nYork married; for who could foretell, Lord Melbourne observed, that the\r\nDuchess of York would have no children?—and that the late King should\r\nlose the two he had? This led us to speak of the whole Royal Family,\r\ntheir characters, of the Princesses marrying so late; of George III.’s\r\ndislike to their marrying, which Lord Melbourne did not know; of their\r\nbeauty; he always thought Princess Sophia (when young) very pretty,\r\nthough very like a Gipsy; spoke of the singular instance of both George\r\nIII.’s and Queen Charlotte’s being very plain and all their children\r\nvery handsome; spoke of all the Princes and Princesses, of the two\r\nlittle Princes, Octavius and Alfred, who died; Lord Melbourne said,\r\nGeorge III. said when he felt he was to be unwell (which he always\r\nforefelt) he dreamt and thought of Octavius. Lord Melbourne said Queen\r\nCharlotte had fine hands and feet, a good bust, and a pretty figure.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 22nd April._—I spoke to him of what I was to write to Uncle\r\nrelative to Soult’s nomination[440]; Soult, he told me, is a large,\r\ntall man; looks more “like the Purser of a ship” than an officer; a\r\nvery distinguished officer risen from the ranks, and a man of great\r\nabilities besides. Lord Melbourne knew him when he was in Paris. I\r\nasked Lord Melbourne when he was first at Paris; in 1815 he said, which\r\nwas the first time he was ever on the Continent. “We went,” he said\r\n(which “we” implies himself and Lady Caroline, his wife) “to Brussels\r\nimmediately after the Battle of Waterloo, to see Fred. Ponsonby[441]\r\nwho was desperately wounded.” This was in June 1815, and he went to\r\nParis in August, and stayed there September and October and came back\r\nin November. He saw Uncle Leopold there then, and said he was extremely\r\nhandsome.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 23rd April._—Lord Melbourne looked into the newspapers and\r\nsaid there was nothing in them; he read (in the papers) a denial from\r\nLady Charlotte Bury[442] of her having written the book called _Diary\r\nof the Reign_ (I think) _of George IV._; Lord Melbourne spoke of Lady\r\nHertford, though he of course could not remember her in her great\r\nbeauty; he said, “My nurse nursed Lord Hertford,[443] so that I used\r\nto hear a great deal about her.” The present Lord Hertford’s wife, he\r\nsaid, was a natural daughter of the Duke of Queensberry, called Mmé.\r\nFagniani[444]; she is still alive at Paris, but Lord Hertford has long\r\nbeen separated from her; Lord Yarmouth, he said, is very clever, but\r\nalways lives abroad....[445]\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 25th April._—In speaking before of Mrs. Baring,[446] who, I\r\nsaid, from having been the most affectionate of mothers, latterly never\r\nasked after her children,—Lord Melbourne said with the tears in his\r\neyes, “That’s a sure sign that all is over; when people intermit what\r\nthey have been in the habit of doing.” He mentioned that when William\r\nIII. was dying they brought him some good news from abroad, but he took\r\nno notice of it whatever, and said, “Je tire à ma fin....”\r\n\r\n_Friday, 27th April._—I showed Lord Melbourne two pictures of Lord\r\nDurham’s children; spoke of the beautiful boy Lord Durham lost, who\r\nwould now be 20. Lord Melbourne said, that boy’s death was the cause of\r\na dreadful scene between Durham and Lord Grey in one of the Cabinets.\r\nSpoke of this Flahaut[447] business, and of the wish at Paris to throw\r\nthe blame of the whole on Uncle Leopold; spoke of Flahaut; Lord\r\nMelbourne said he (Flahaut) was first noticed by Napoleon, in the\r\nRussian Retreat, when in all that cold and misery he heard a young\r\nofficer singing, and appearing quite gay; that was Flahaut; Napoleon\r\nsaid, “That is a fine young fellow,” and placed him on his Staff....\r\nSpoke of Lady Campbell[448] (Pamela Fitzgerald) who Lord Melbourne has\r\nnot seen again, but from whom he has had a long letter....\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 28th April._—Lord Melbourne continued, that those who were\r\nabout the Prince of Wales[449] were not liked at Court “and vice\r\nversa.” And he said _his_ family quite belonged to Carlton House;\r\nstill, he added, the King and Queen were very civil to him. Speaking\r\nof George IV. he said, “He expected those he was fond of to go quite\r\nwith him; to dislike those he disliked, and to like those he liked, and\r\nto turn with him.” He then mentioned what he told me before, that his\r\n(Ld. M.’s) father and mother got into disgrace, for I think 3 years,\r\nwhen Mrs. Fitzherbert was banished, and they continued seeing her; and\r\nwhen George IV. came back to Mrs. Fitzherbert he came to dine with them\r\n(Lord Melbourne was there the first day he came) as if nothing had\r\nhappened, and as if he had been there the day before. Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid, before all this, that “the only thing one learns at a public\r\nschool” is _punctuality_, and the value of time; that he never had a\r\nclock in his room, and always called to somebody to tell him what\r\no’clock it was, which he owned was bad, as it put you in the power of\r\nthe man to make you late. He “never carried a watch about him” in his\r\nlife, and yet he thinks he generally knows what o’clock it is....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 30th April._—I then showed him a little book relating to the\r\nCoronations of various of my Ancestors, and amongst others Queen Anne;\r\nhe looked over parts of it, and glanced at one part which states that\r\nQueen Anne said in her first speech to Parliament that “_her heart\r\nwas entirely_ English.” Upon which Lord Melbourne told me that when\r\nshe concluded the Peace of Utrecht, which was supposed to be rather\r\nfavourable to the French, a Sir Samuel Garth[450] wrote a poem in\r\nwhich he said of Queen Anne: “The Queen this year has lost a part,\r\nOf her entirely English heart,”—which is very funny; Lord Melbourne\r\ndid not remember what followed. Speaking of Prince George of Denmark,\r\nwho Lord Melbourne said “was a very stupid fellow,” he added that he\r\n(G. of Denmark) was always saying, “Est-il possible?” to everything,\r\nand was always saying so whenever he was told of another Lord having\r\nleft James II. So when James heard that George of Denmark had left\r\nhim, he said, “So _Est-il possible_ is gone at last!” I spoke of\r\nthe Duchess of Ancaster[451] having been Queen Charlotte’s first\r\nMistress of the Robes; the title of Duke of Ancaster became extinct,\r\nLord Melbourne told me, and the Dowager Lady Cholmondeley[452] and\r\nLord Willoughby’s mother[453] were her co-heiresses. I asked him\r\nwho was now Lord Fauconberg; he said the title was extinct[454]; he\r\nwas a descendant of Oliver Cromwell’s by Cromwell’s daughter Lady\r\nFauconberg; Lady Charlotte Bellasyse married a person called Thomas\r\nWynne, a Welshman.[455] Sir Ed. Desborow, Lord Melbourne told me, is\r\nalso a descendant of Cromwell’s by one of his daughters. I told Lord\r\nMelbourne what the Duke of Sussex had told me, viz. that none of his\r\nfamily “could hold their tongue,” which is very true; which made Lord\r\nMelbourne laugh, and still more so when I told him that the Duke, in\r\nspeaking of the King of Hanover, called him “that other man.” After\r\ndinner I sat on the sofa with Lady Isabella and Lady Augusta, Lord\r\nMelbourne sitting near me the whole evening, and some of the other\r\nladies being seated round the table. Spoke of Lady Isabella; Henry\r\nFox,[456] of the Apartments at Hampton Court &c.; of this Review of\r\nBrougham’s of Lady C. Bury’s book. Lord Melbourne said again, what he\r\ntold me the other day, that there was much which Brougham seemed to\r\nknow nothing about; he (B.) states that Mrs. Fitzherbert did not know\r\nwhen she married the King that a marriage with a Catholic could not\r\nbe valid; Lord Melbourne says she must have known that, and that, by\r\nwhat he has heard, she was against the marriage; he said Lord Holland\r\nknows a good deal about it, and that it is known _where_ the marriage\r\ntook place and by whom it was celebrated. Lord Melbourne thinks it\r\ntook place in 1784 or 5[457]; the King left her in 1795, when Lady\r\nJersey got into favour, whom he put about the Princess of Wales; he\r\ncame back to Mrs. Fitzherbert in 1802, then left her for Lady Hertford,\r\nquarrelled with her, and then Lady Conyngham followed; the last-named,\r\nI observed, was very good-natured; Lord Melbourne said, “She was the\r\nmost good-natured, but the most rapacious; she got the most money from\r\nhim.” Spoke of Lady Augusta Fox; Lord Melbourne said her mother, Lady\r\nCoventry, was Lady Mary Beauclerc, daughter of a Duke of St. Albans\r\n(uncle to the present Duke). Her (Lady Coventry’s) mother was a Miss\r\nMoses, a Jewess. Lady Holland, Lord Melbourne says, does not like\r\nLady Augusta Fox. Lord Melbourne told me that the Irish Poor Law Bill\r\nwould come up to the House of Lords next day, and that there would be\r\nprobably a good deal next week, in the Committee about it; a great deal\r\nof difference of opinion; but he thinks they’ll pass it....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 4th May._—Lord Melbourne told me on Wednesday evening that\r\nLandseer said of McLise[458]: “He is beating us all; his imagination,\r\ngrouping, and drawing is wonderful; he must soften his colouring\r\nperhaps a little.” Two very clever ones of Grant; a portrait of Lord\r\nCowper by Lucas which is excessively like; Lord Melbourne, by Hayter,\r\nand my dogs by Landseer looked very well. The latter is too beautiful.\r\nThere were also two very clever pictures by Landseer’s brother; there\r\nwas also a very good picture by Sir Martin Shee of the late King; it is\r\nthe likest I’ve seen; it’s so like his figure.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 5th May._—We then spoke of my sitting one day to Sir Martin\r\nShee; of Lord Melbourne’s having seen an Academician this morning who\r\nsaid the reason why Hayter was not elected one of their Members was\r\nbecause his character was not good; Lord Melbourne asked me about\r\nit; I said I did not know much about it, but that I believed he had\r\nquarrelled with his wife and had separated from her. “And did he get\r\nanother?” said Lord M. I laughed and said I was not sure of that....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 7th May._—We (that is Lord Melbourne, Lord Holland and I)\r\nspoke about the Exhibition, Landseer’s picture of my dogs, the origin\r\nof the dog in the Arms of the Seal of the Duchy of Lancaster, which\r\nLord Holland said came originally from John of Gaunt, was adopted by\r\nHenry VII., abolished by James I., and restored by William IV.; spoke\r\nof _Macaws_, and he offered me one which belongs to Lady Holland.\r\nSpoke of Nightingales; Lord Melbourne said he could not distinguish\r\nits song from that of another bird’s; that it could be mistaken for a\r\nwood-lark’s, which Lord Holland denied, and they went on discussing\r\nthe different songs of birds; we then spoke of various birds; of\r\nnightingales migrating; of how wonderful the migration of birds was;\r\nLord Melbourne did not think it so incredible; they first went to\r\nFrance, he said, and “then they slide along the country....”\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 9th May._—Lord Melbourne said he was kept in the House of\r\nLords till 8, the night before; that Lord Shrewsbury[459] made rather\r\na good speech, but that his (Ld. M.’s) fear was that some of the Roman\r\nCatholic Peers might refuse to take the Oath on account of all this;\r\nand then “we should have all this question” (the Roman Catholic) “over\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 10th May._—At ½ p. 10 the doors were opened and I went\r\nthrough the Saloon into the other Ball-room next the Dining-room in\r\nwhich was Strauss’s band. I felt a little shy in going in, but soon got\r\nover it and went and talked to the people. The rooms I must say looked\r\nbeautiful, were so well lit up, and everything so well done; and all\r\ndone in one day. There was no crowd at all; indeed, there might have\r\nbeen more people. The dining-room looked also very handsome as the\r\nsupper-room. The Throne-room was arranged for the tea-room. I danced (a\r\nQuadrille of course, as I only dance quadrilles) first (in the large\r\nball-room) with George[460]; and 2ndly with Prince Nicholas Esterhazy;\r\nthere was a valse between each quadrille; I never heard anything so\r\n_beautiful_ in my life as Strauss’s band. We then went into the other\r\nball-room where I danced two other quadrilles with Lord Jocelyn[461]\r\nand Lord Fitzalan[462]; the first named is very merry and funny. When\r\nI did not dance (which was only the case when valzing went on) I sat\r\nwith Mamma and my Aunts, on a seat raised one step above the floor.\r\nLady Fanny Cowper was my vis-à-vis when I danced with Lord Jocelyn. At\r\n1 (after my quadrille with Lord Fitzalan) we went into the Supper-room.\r\nAfter supper we went into the large Ball-room where we remained till\r\nthe last quadrille which I danced in Weippert’s room. I danced with\r\nLord Cowper (who was much less shy and very agreeable); Lord Uxbridge\r\n(who dances remarkably well); Lord Douro; Lord Folkestone[463] (a great\r\nally of mine); Lord Suffield[464]; and lastly with Lord Morpeth. There\r\nwas a great deal of beauty there, amongst which were Lady Ashley,\r\nLady Fanny Cowper, Lady Wilhelmina Stanhope, Lady Seymour,[465] Lady\r\nClanricarde,[466] Lady Mary Vyner,[467] Lady Norreys,[468] Lady Emma\r\nHerbert,[469] Lady Clanwilliam,[470] Lady Mary Grimston,[471] Lady\r\nPowerscourt,[472] Miss Maude,[473] Miss Elphinstone.[474] Lady Fanny\r\nwas twice my vis-à-vis, as was also Lady Adelaide Paget.[475] I did\r\nnot leave the ball-room till 10 m. to _four_!! and was in bed by ½\r\np. 4,—the sun shining. It was a lovely ball, so gay, so nice,—and I\r\nfelt so happy and so merry; I had not danced for _so_ long and was so\r\nglad to do so again! One _only_ regret I had,—and that was, that my\r\nexcellent, kind, good friend, Lord Melbourne was not there. I missed\r\nhim much at this my first ball; he would have been pleased I think!\r\n\r\n_Friday, 11th May._—Got up at 20 m. p. 10 and breakfasted at ½ p. 11.\r\nHeard from my good Lord Melbourne that he was “extremely concerned”\r\nat not having been able to come to the Ball, but that “he felt so\r\nunwell and so disturbed” that he was afraid to venture; which was\r\nright of him, though I regret it _so_ much. Heard from Lord John that\r\n“Sir Thomas Acland[476] gave notice yesterday that he should move on\r\nMonday to rescind the resolution of 1835 respecting the Church of\r\nIreland. The Debate on this Question must lead to one of the most\r\nsevere struggles of the session both in discussion and in the Division.\r\nBoth parties have nearly all their strength in London. But a majority\r\nfor Ministers, though a small one, is tolerably certain.” This gave\r\nme a pang which somewhat damped my very light and high spirits. We\r\nspoke for a long time about my Ball—who I danced with, the beauties,\r\nand the different persons there; I said to Lord Melbourne the moment\r\nI saw him, how very sorry I was that he had not come last night. We\r\nspoke of all this for some time, and he was so kind about it all, and\r\nseemed to take quite an interest in it all. He then said, “They are\r\ngoing to make another attack upon us on Monday; Sir Thomas Acland has\r\ngiven notice that he means to make a motion to rescind the Resolutions\r\nabout the Irish Church passed in 1835, upon which we came in.” I then\r\nadded that Lord John seemed certain about a majority, though a small\r\none; Lord Melbourne said Sir Thomas Acland was a conscientious and\r\nnot very violent man, and consequently well chosen in that respect\r\nto make a good effect. There is to be a Cabinet upon it tomorrow at\r\n1; and Lord John is going to have a Meeting of the Members at 4. All\r\nthis distresses me much; would to God! none of these Motions, which\r\nare so _useless_, were brought on. I fervently trust however that all\r\nwill do well. Spoke of my ball, and the different people, the rooms;\r\nhe asked if I was not tired; I said not the least, for though I had\r\ndanced a great deal I did not valze, as I did not think it would do\r\nfor me to valze. Lord Melbourne said eagerly, “I think you are quite\r\nright; that’s quite right.” Lord Melbourne dines with me tonight, I’m\r\nhappy to say. I showed him the letter I meant to write to the King\r\nof Hanover, which he quite approved of. Spoke of several people at\r\nthe Ball and several other things concerning it; of Lord Duncannon\r\nwho is rather better but still very poorly; Lord Melbourne does not\r\nlike his being so long ill, and suffering with so many different\r\nthings; there is a disease in the sockets of his teeth which become\r\nquite loose, the teeth themselves being quite sound. Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid the Ponsonbys were generally strong, and lived to a great age;\r\nthat the present Lord Bessborough’s father lived to a very great age;\r\nLord Melbourne said he was the man of whom the following anecdote is\r\ntold:—he (_that_ Lord Bessborough) was playing at cards, at Picquet,\r\nLord Melbourne thinks, when his partner dropped down dead; and he said\r\nto the Waiter, “Remember, if the gentleman recovers, that I’ve got\r\nsuch and such a thing in my hand....” Spoke to him of the Coronation,\r\nand of the different people who were to bear the Swords (which he had\r\nalready spoken to me of, in the morning; for he showed me then a letter\r\nfrom the Duke of Grafton declining to take any part in it, as he only\r\nmeant to attend as a Peer). He (Ld. Melbourne) will carry the Sword of\r\nState; the Duke of Hamilton[477] he _thinks_ of proposing to carry the\r\nCrown; the Duke of Somerset[478] the Orb; the Dukes of Devonshire and\r\nSutherland the other swords; and the Duke of Roxburgh,[479] something\r\nelse. But nothing is as yet settled with respect to all this. Spoke of\r\nmy reading the Despatches, of which there were so many.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 12th May._—At a ¼ p. 1 came Lord Melbourne and stayed with\r\nme till 10 m. to 2. He said he was, and seemed, much better. He first\r\nread me a Petition from the Society of British Artists, wishing me to\r\ngo to their Exhibition, which however he said was quite unnecessary.\r\nHe then said they were going to have a Cabinet upon this motion,[480]\r\nwhich is to take place on Monday, and to see what can be done upon it.\r\nLord Melbourne then explained to me in the clearest manner possible\r\nall about it. He told me that:—In 1835, Sir Robert Peel found himself\r\nseveral times in minorities about various things which I forget; but\r\nhe said he would not resign until he was beat upon a Question relative\r\nto the Irish Church; when he brought in his Bill for Irish Tithes,\r\nthe resolution, to appropriate the surplus for the benefit of Moral\r\nEducation, was carried against him by 37,—and he resigned; well,\r\nthe present Government came in, and Lord Melbourne said, found this\r\nresolution an awkward one, and that there was less surplus than they\r\nhad imagined; they however brought forward several Acts, and also\r\nawkward ones, Lord Melbourne said, which were each year rejected by\r\nthe House of Lords. Well, this year the following Bill was brought in\r\n(which Lord Melbourne thinks a very good one, as do I, but which he\r\nhears will meet with a great deal of opposition), which is, leaving\r\nout the Appropriation Clause, and doing away with the surplus, but\r\nproposing to pay the Irish Church out of the funds of the Empire,\r\nwhich is separating the Irish Church from the Land, and keeping it\r\nup, _not_ for the people, as they are almost all Catholics, but for\r\nthe Protestant feeling in the country. Now, Lord Melbourne says,\r\nthe _Church_ don’t like it, as they think it’s making the Church\r\nStipendiary and is separating it too much from the Land, and the\r\n_violent democrats_ dislike it as they think it is giving the Church\r\ntoo much support. Lord Melbourne observes that the opposition will be\r\nso considerable from these two Parties that he thinks it will hardly be\r\npossible for _us_ to carry this measure. _Now_, it is upon this measure\r\nbeing proposed on Monday that this Motion or amendment is to be made:\r\n“to rescind the resolution of ’35”; “that is,” as Lord Melbourne said,\r\n“to do away with it, to scratch it out of the Journals.” Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid that if this _should_ be carried against us, it will be almost\r\nfatal to the Government; he added that it is one of those awkward sort\r\nof questions in Politics, which it is very difficult to get over, and\r\nat the same time hardly possible to resign upon; “it is not good ground\r\nto resign upon,” he said, “it would not be understood by the people,\r\nthey would not sympathise with you.” He continued—but that _Lord John_\r\nmight consider his honour at stake, and might resign upon it, which\r\nLord Melbourne said he almost thought he would, but that he would\r\nhear that at the Cabinet today. He added, “If we have a Majority, why\r\nthen it’s all well.” I observed that Lord John seemed to think that\r\nlikely. Lord Melbourne said he certainly thought we should; but from\r\nthe nature of the House it made it “ticklish” and “nervous”; which, God\r\nknows! it does. He says the Irish Poor Law Bill will not meet with much\r\nopposition in the House of Lords, except from the Irish Peers; Lord\r\nLondonderry[481] means to oppose it very violently. Sir Robert Peel has\r\na great dinner today, given to him by his followers. Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid he would let me know what took place at the Cabinet; and if\r\nthere was anything very particular he would come himself. He dines at\r\nthe Speaker’s tonight. I cannot say (though I feel _confident_ of OUR\r\n_success_) HOW _low_, HOW _sad_ I feel, when I think of the POSSIBILITY\r\nof this excellent and truly kind man (Lord Melbourne) not _remaining_\r\nmy Minister! Yet I trust fervently that _He_ who has so wonderfully\r\nprotected me through such manifold difficulties will not _now_ desert\r\nme! I should have liked to have expressed to Lord Melbourne my anxiety,\r\nbut the tears were nearer than words throughout the time I saw him, and\r\nI felt I should have choked, had I attempted to say anything.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 13th May._—In speaking of the singing of birds, which Lord\r\nMelbourne said he never could make out one from another, he said, “I\r\nnever can admire the singing of birds; there’s no melody in it; it’s so\r\nshrill; that’s all humbug; it’s mere Poetry; it is not pretty.” This\r\nmade us laugh; he likes the Blackbird’s singing best. He said that\r\npeople say there is no difference between the song of a ground-lark and\r\nthe nightingale. I observed that Lord Holland said there was. “Oh!”\r\nhe said, “I don’t think Lord Holland knows anything about it.” “It’s\r\nvery odd,” he continued, “Mr. Fox, and Lord Holland the same, like the\r\nsinging of birds, and can’t bear music, nor the Human Voice....”\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 15th May._— ... Heard from Lord John “that he yesterday\r\nbrought forward the question of Irish Tithes in a speech of two hours,\r\nin which he endeavoured to review the whole subject. Sir Thomas Acland\r\nthen moved to rescind the resolution of 1835. He spoke temperately and\r\nwell. Lord Stanley made a short speech professing a desire to settle\r\nthe Question; Lord Morpeth finished the debate for the night with a\r\nvery vigorous and very effective speech. The division will probably\r\ntake place tonight, and may be rather early.” Lord Melbourne told me\r\nyesterday that he thought Sir Robert Peel’s speech at the dinner on\r\nSaturday very moderate; but that the whole thing seemed to have been\r\n“rather flat....” Lord Melbourne said he did not know what the Council\r\n(today) was to be about; I said neither did I know, but that it was\r\nLord Glenelg who wished for it. “They always run everything so very\r\nlate in that Colonial Office,” he said; that they never thought _when_\r\nthey would want a Council, and when they did, they said they wanted it\r\nimmediately, and always upon the most inconvenient days; that to-day\r\nwas a most inconvenient day for the Members of the House of Commons....\r\nLord Melbourne said that Lord Munster had been to see him this morning,\r\nabout their (the Fitzclarences’) Pensions, on the Civil List, which\r\nthere was some fear the Committee might make some difficulty about,\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne said would be very hard; Lord Munster came to show\r\nLord Melbourne the letter he meant to write (to Mr. Rice, I think)\r\nabout it. This pension was granted them by George IV. Lord Munster\r\ntold Lord Melbourne that the late King always imagined that Lord\r\nEgremont[482] would leave Lord Munster a great deal; and whenever he\r\ngave Lord Munster anything, he used to write to Lord Egremont to tell\r\nhim he had done so, which Lord Egremont did not at all like and said,\r\n“This is a scheme from the beginning,” meaning that the King promoted\r\nthe match on account of the money. Lord Melbourne said, “Lord Egremont\r\nwas a very good man but rather suspicious”; from always having had a\r\nvery large fortune he fancied people wanted to get it from him. He gave\r\nLord Munster £5,000 about a fortnight before he died. Spoke of this\r\nnew Election Committee Bill which Sir Robert Peel asked for leave to\r\nbring in. He proposes that at the beginning of each session the Speaker\r\nshould name 6 or 4 Members who should then choose the Committees to try\r\nthe Elections. Formerly, as Lord Melbourne told me once before, the\r\nElections used to be tried by the whole House, and it was considered\r\nsuch a mark of want of confidence in the Ministers if their Member\r\nwas unseated, that Sir Robert Walpole resigned when the Member for\r\nChippenham was unseated. When this became “too flagrant” Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid, George Grenville, great-grandfather to the present Duke of\r\nBuckingham, made what is called “the Grenville Act,” which is as they\r\nare tried now; viz. the Speaker draws 40 names from glasses, with which\r\nLists the different parties retire and strike off names from each list\r\nuntil they get it down to 15; and that’s the Committee. Now this, Lord\r\nMelbourne said, is found to be partial,[483] and a new mode must be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Don Fernando Prince of Portugal\r\n  from recollection  \r\n  P.V. del. Ken. Palace. April, 1836._\r\n\r\n  H.S.H. PRINCE FERDINAND OF SAXE-COBURG,\r\n  AFTERWARDS KING CONSORT OF PORTUGAL.\r\n  From a sketch by Princess Victoria.]\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne said Lord Redesdale[484] brought him the Duke of\r\nWellington’s letter yesterday. Lord Melbourne had seen Lord John this\r\nmorning, who thinks we shall only have a majority of 11 to-night, and\r\nthat Mr. Hobhouse said we should have more in order to delude us into\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 16th May._—Got up at 10 and heard from Lord John that on\r\na Division _we_ had a majority of 19, which he said was more than he\r\nexpected. How thankful I am and feel! Lord Melbourne said he heard\r\nthat Ferdinand was annoyed at our pressing the Portuguese Government\r\nabout the Slave Trade; and that it would be well, if I were to state to\r\nFerdinand that the feeling was so strong in this country about Slavery,\r\nand we were so pressed about it, that it was impossible for us to do\r\notherwise. I spoke to Lord Melbourne of these Resolutions relative to\r\nthe Irish Tithe Bill, which I thought excellent, but which he said a\r\nvery great number of people were against. I observed that Lord John\r\nhad told me at Windsor that he thought we should not carry it, but\r\nthat it might be compromised. Lord Melbourne then again repeated that\r\nthe Established Church was _generally_ kept up for the Poor, as the\r\nrich could afford that themselves; whereas in Ireland, 700,000 are\r\nRoman Catholics, and the Established Church is _only_ kept up for the\r\nProtestant feeling in the United Kingdom, and not for the Poor who\r\nare almost all Roman Catholics. I then asked about who should stand\r\nSponsor in my place at the Christening of Col. and Lady Catharine\r\nBuckley’s[485] little boy, who is to be christened down in the New\r\nForest where they lived. I said the child was to be called _Victor_,\r\nwhich I thought an ugly name; he did not, and said laughing that “Sir\r\nVictor Buckley” would sound very well....\r\n\r\n_Friday, 18th May._—We spoke of various things; I asked him if he liked\r\nmy headdress which was done in plaits round my ears,[486] for I know\r\n_in general_ he only likes the hair in front crêpé in 2 puffs. He said,\r\nlooking at me and making one of his funny faces, “It’s pretty; isn’t it\r\nrather curious—something new?”\r\n\r\n_Saturday, 19th May._—At a little after 2 I rode out with Mamma, Lord\r\nUxbridge, Lord Torrington, Lady Forbes, dearest Lehzen, Lord Alfred,\r\nMiss Dillon, Mr. Murray, Lord Headfort, Lady Flora, Miss Quentin,\r\nand Col. Cavendish, and came home at 6 m. to 5. I rode dear little\r\nUxbridge who went _perfectly_. We met Lord Melbourne in going out, who\r\nwas riding his pony. We rode out by the Harrow Road and home by the\r\nUxbridge Road and Park. Heard from Lord John that “he yesterday stated\r\nto the House of Commons the course respecting the Irish Bills, which\r\nhe had the honour to explain to Your Majesty yesterday. Sir Robert\r\nPeel asked for a delay till Friday, and appeared much agitated; but\r\nwhat afterwards fell from him gives every reason to suppose that the\r\nMunicipal Corporations Bill will not be opposed. Nor is it probable\r\nthat the Irish Tithe Bill will meet with resistance from the Radical\r\nparty in the House of Commons. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a\r\nvery clear financial statement, and the deficiency of the Revenue being\r\nbefore known, no disappointment was caused by the announcement. Should\r\nmatters proceed smoothly another fortnight will end the chief party\r\nquestions in the House of Commons.” This was _delightful_ news....\r\n“Very nice party” (my Concert), Lord M. said, “and everybody very much\r\npleased.” I smiled and said I feared I had done it very ill; that I was\r\nquite angry with myself and thought I had done it so ill; and was not\r\ncivil enough. He said most kindly, “Oh! no, quite the contrary, for I\r\nshould have told you if it had been otherwise.” I then said I had felt\r\nso nervous and shy. “That wasn’t at all observed,” he said. I said\r\nthat I often stood before a person not knowing what to say; and Lord\r\nMelbourne said that the longer one stood thinking the worse it was; and\r\nhe really thought the best thing to do was to say anything commonplace\r\nand foolish, better than to say nothing.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 20th May._—Lord Melbourne was in delightful spirits and _so_\r\ntalkative and _so_ kind and so VERY AGREEABLE throughout the evening.\r\nI almost fear therefore (in consequence of our having talked so much)\r\nthat I may have forgotten some of the things we talked about. I asked\r\nhim if he had dined at Lord Shrewsbury’s the night before; he said no,\r\nthat it was all a mistake; he went there, was shown upstairs, where he\r\nfound Lord Shrewsbury alone with his books and papers, who said that\r\nall his family were gone to the Opera; Lord Melbourne said, “I came to\r\ndine here”; upon which Lord S. told him that it was _next_ Saturday;\r\nLord Melbourne said it was very stupid of himself to forget it, as Lord\r\nShrewsbury had put off the dinner on account of him. He walked home,\r\nfound his people at home, got his dinner in ½ an hour, and went to\r\nhis sister’s. Spoke of the Preachers being so badly appointed at the\r\nChapel Royal, which Lord Melbourne said was a great pity, as it would\r\nhave been such “an instrument of good” if it had been the contrary. We\r\nlooked at some prints, and amongst others there was a very clever one\r\nof Capt. Macheath with Polly and Lucy in _The Beggar’s Opera_; Lord\r\nMelbourne said that _The Beggar’s Opera_ was written by Gay, and was\r\nused by the Tory Party in order to show up Lord Townshend[487] and Sir\r\nRobert Walpole; was very clever, and had an immense run; but is coarse\r\nbeyond conception; it was likewise performed with great success when\r\nLord Sandwich brought forward an indictment against Mr. Wilkes for\r\nimmorality. Of Lord Teynham[488] wanting to have a Private Audience of\r\nme, which Lord Melbourne stopped; he said Peers are only allowed to\r\nhave these Private Audiences to speak on Public Affairs, and not on\r\nPrivate concerns; that when the Regent wanted to prevent Lady Jersey\r\ngoing so often to see Princess Charlotte, Lord Jersey asked for a\r\nPrivate audience; and the Regent said to him, “Of course you come to\r\nspeak of Public matters, for if you come to speak about your wife, I\r\ncannot speak to you,” and he spoke to him upon ordinary matters and\r\ndismissed him. Talleyrand is dead—at last!\r\n\r\n_Monday, 21st May._—Spoke of Talleyrand’s death, which Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid he heard was quite like that of the former French Ministers—like\r\nMazarin—the house full of people to see him die. He (Ld. Melbourne)\r\nsaid he had heard that Louis Philippe and Mme. Adelaide had been to\r\nsee Talleyrand. Spoke of his fear of dying, which Lord Melbourne said\r\npeople always said of persons whose feelings on religion were rather\r\nloose. Lord Melbourne said he heard that Talleyrand had signed a sort\r\nof recantation to the Pope, for something he had done, at the time\r\nof the Revolution—for having performed Mass upon some occasion or\r\nother....[489]\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 24th May._—I this day enter my 20th year, which I think\r\n_very_ old! In looking back on the past year, I feel more grateful\r\nthan I can express for ALL the VERY GREAT BLESSINGS I have received\r\nsince my last birthday. I have only ONE VERY dear affectionate friend\r\nless—dearest Louis! Oh! if she could but be still with us!! Though I\r\nhave _lost_ a _dear_ friend, I can never be _thankful_ enough for the\r\n_true, faithful, honest, kind_ one I’ve GAINED since last year, which\r\nis my _excellent_ Lord Melbourne, who is so kind and good to me!!... At\r\n25 m. p. 10 I went with the whole Royal Family into the other Ball-room\r\nthrough the Saloon which was full of people; after speaking to a good\r\nmany I went to my seat (without sitting down) and then opened the Ball\r\nin a Quadrille with George.[490] There were about the same number of\r\npeople there as at the 1st Ball, and a great number of Foreigners\r\nthere. My good Lord Melbourne came up to me after my 1st Quadrille,\r\nbut only stopped one minute, and though I saw him looking on at 3 of\r\nthe Quadrilles I danced afterwards, he never came near me again, which\r\nI was very sorry for; and when I sent for him after supper, he was\r\ngone.... After supper I danced 4 Quadrilles in Strauss’s room; he\r\nwas playing most beautifully. I danced with Lord George Paget,[491]\r\nLord Cantelupe,[492] Lord Milton,[493] and Lord Leveson. Count Eugene\r\nZichy (cousin to Countess Zichy’s husband) wore a most beautiful\r\nuniform all covered with splendid turquoises; he is a handsome man,\r\nwith a very good-natured expression, as he is too, very unaffected and\r\ngood-humoured, and a beautiful valzer. We then went into the other\r\nroom, and danced a regular old English Country Dance of 72 couple,\r\nwhich lasted 1 hour, from 3 till 4! I danced with Lord Uxbridge, Lord\r\nCantelupe and Lady Cowper being next, and the Duke of Devonshire\r\nand Lady Lothian[494] on the other side. It was the merriest, most\r\ndelightful thing possible. I left the Ball room at 10 m. p. 4, and\r\nwas in bed at 5—broad daylight. It was a _delightful_ Ball, and the\r\npleasantest birthday I’ve spent for _many_ years!...\r\n\r\n_Monday, 28th May._—Spoke of writing to George of Hanover,[495] which\r\nhe said I should do; and also to the King of Hanover for his birthday;\r\nspoke of the report of poor George’s marrying a Russian Princess. He\r\nthen continued saying it would raise a curious question, “his marrying\r\na Greek” (of the Greek religion it is); for he believed that _only_\r\nmarrying _Roman Catholics_ was forbidden by _law_ here (George being\r\nin the succession here). I said I thought it was said, _all_ who were\r\nnot of the _Reformed Religion_, without naming specifically (Greek, he\r\nsays, he supposes is included under Roman Catholics) _Roman Catholic_.\r\nLord Melbourne said I might be right, for that he had not looked at the\r\nAct for some time. He said he believed also that George could not marry\r\nwithout my leave.[496]\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 29th May._—I told him that Lord Glenelg had made me a present\r\nof a Black Swan; Lord Melbourne said that a _Black Swan_ was _not_ a\r\nSwan; “It’s a Goose.” Lady Mulgrave said the Ancients had Black Swans,\r\nand to prove it began quoting the lines from the Latin Grammar, which\r\nLord Melbourne then repeated, and which I used to learn: “Rara avis in\r\nterris, nigroque simillima cygno.” Lord Melbourne said, _that_ meant\r\nto describe something very rare, and which _did not exist_. I said\r\nto Lord Melbourne I was very glad to hear that he would come down to\r\nWindsor for the Eton Montem. He said, “It’s quite right to go, but I\r\ndon’t think it’s a very pleasant thing, the Montem; rather foolish”;\r\nand we spoke of the Regatta on the 4th of June, to which I’m not going.\r\n“The Regatta as you call it,” he said to Lady Mulgrave; “The Boats” it\r\nused always to be called. _That_ is in fact done _without_ the consent\r\nof the Masters, and all the boys were generally flogged next day. Lord\r\nMelbourne has not been to a Montem since 1809. In speaking of the head\r\nColleger who generally is made the Captain, he said he was usually\r\na big boy about 19; “More foolish than a boy,” Lord Melbourne said\r\nlaughing; and that the expenses were generally so great, and the boy so\r\nextravagant for some time before, that he seldom _cleared_ anything.\r\nI said the Montem generally ended in the boys’ being sick and drunk;\r\nLord Melbourne said in his funny manner, he thought in these days of\r\neducation, no boys ever got drunk or sick—which I fear is _not_ the\r\ncase. He said all this eating and drinking, “all the chocolate and tea\r\nand coffee” for breakfast, had got up since his time; that when he was\r\nat Eton, they used to cut a roll in half and put a pat of butter inside\r\nit and give it to you, and that you then might drink a glass of milk\r\nand water (for breakfast); “I never could take milk, and therefore I\r\nalways took water,” he said, “and we did very well”; much better he\r\nthinks than they do now. He said that he remembered people always gave\r\nchildren what they disliked most; he used (before he went to school)\r\nto have _every_ day boiled mutton and rice pudding, which he hated;\r\n“Children’s stomachs are rather squeamish,” he said; and boiled mutton\r\nis particularly nauseous to a child, he observed; and he hated rice\r\npudding. “Somehow or other,” he said, “they found out you disliked\r\nit, and there it was every day”; this, he thinks (and everybody else\r\nalmost, I think, ought to do so), a bad system. He added, “Children’s\r\nstomachs are rather delicate and _queasy_”; which made us all laugh.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 31st May._—He said that Lord Mulgrave was very anxious about\r\nbeing made a Marquis at the Coronation, and that he supposed it must\r\nbe done, but that it would offend other Earls; he added that there was\r\ngreat difficulty about making these Peers,—but that he must soon lay\r\nthe list before me. “I shall advise Your Majesty to make as few as\r\npossible,” he added. It would not do, he said, to make any Members of\r\nthe House of Commons Peers, on account of vacating their seats. Lord\r\nDundas wishes to be made an Earl, he says, which he supposes should be\r\ngranted; and Lord Barham wishes to be made Earl of Gainsborough.[497]\r\nWilliam IV. made 16 Peers and 24 Baronets at his Coronation; and George\r\nIV. 15 Peers; “he was so clogged with promises,” Lord Melbourne said,\r\n“he had made such heaps of promises.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  The three summer months of 1838 were eventful in the life of the\r\n  young Queen. It is not only that she attended an Eton Montem (that\r\n  quaint ceremony so graphically described in _Coningsby_ by one who\r\n  was in future years to be her Prime Minister), and not only that\r\n  she held her first Review in Hyde Park (which was somewhat of a\r\n  disappointment to her owing to Lord Melbourne having dissuaded\r\n  her from riding on horseback), but on the 28th June she was\r\n  crowned in Westminster Abbey. There have been many accounts from\r\n  eye-witnesses of the Coronation of British Sovereigns. Volumes\r\n  have been written on the subject from the earliest times. Even the\r\n  immortal pen of Shakespeare has touched upon this great ceremonial.\r\n  Queen Victoria’s description, however, is unique in this, that the\r\n  writer is the Sovereign herself, and that the Coronation is painted\r\n  from the point of view of the central figure in the picture. Owing\r\n  to the extreme youth of the Queen, her childlike appearance, her\r\n  fairness and fragility, and the romance attaching to her sex, owing\r\n  also to her dignity, simplicity, and composure amid that vast\r\n  concourse in the setting of the great Abbey, surrounded as she was\r\n  by every circumstance of pomp and splendour, and overweighted, as\r\n  it seemed, by the tremendous and glittering responsibility of St.\r\n  Edward’s Crown, the ceremony appeared to onlookers extraordinarily\r\n  moving. The Queen noticed that Lord Melbourne was deeply stirred.\r\n  He was one of the many who were in tears.\r\n\r\n  To the thousands who saw her on this occasion for the first time\r\n  and to the millions who read the story of the Coronation, the 28th\r\n  June, 1838, appeared to be the opening day of Queen Victoria’s\r\n  reign. Who, among those present in the Abbey or in the streets of\r\n  the metropolis, could foresee what her reign was to bring forth,\r\n  and who could measure with any degree of accuracy the progress of\r\n  the country she was about to rule, or the growth of the Empire over\r\n  which she was destined to preside, between the day when the Crown\r\n  was placed upon her head, and the day when it was borne away by her\r\n  sorrowing servants from the Mausoleum at Frogmore sixty-three years\r\n  afterwards?\r\n\r\n  “The guns are just announcing,” wrote Queen Adelaide to her niece,\r\n  “your approach to the Abbey, and as I am not near you, and cannot\r\n  take part in the sacred ceremony of your Coronation, I must address\r\n  you in writing to assure you that my thoughts and my whole heart\r\n  are with you, and my prayers are offered up to heaven for your\r\n  happiness and the prosperity and glory of your reign.” The answer\r\n  to this prayer for the young Queen is to be found in the story of\r\n  her reign, and it is written large in golden letters across the\r\n  face of her Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                          1838 (_continued_)\r\n\r\n_Friday, 1st June._—I also told Lord Melbourne that I quite approved\r\nof what he had written to me (also in the afternoon) about the Homage\r\nat the Coronation; namely, that the Peers should _kiss my hand_; Lord\r\nMelbourne smiled when I said this. Lord Melbourne had left Lady Holland\r\nin a great fright, fearing there would be a thunderstorm, of which she\r\nis dreadfully afraid. We spoke of thunderstorms, of people being afraid\r\nof them, of there being always a certain degree of danger; of the\r\ndanger of standing under a tree. I told Lord Melbourne I never could\r\nforgive him for having stood under a tree in that violent thunderstorm\r\nat Windsor last year; he said, “It’s a hundred to one that you’re not\r\nstruck,” and then added smiling: “It’s a sublime death.” Spoke ...\r\nof Lord Durham for some time, of whose arrival we think we must soon\r\nhear. Lord Melbourne said, “I’ll bet you he’ll go by Bermuda,” which\r\nwould be a good deal out of his way; I asked Lord Melbourne what could\r\nmake Lord Durham wish to go there. He replied, “I’m sure I don’t know\r\nwhy he’s got it into his head, but I’ll bet you he’ll go there.” Spoke\r\nof my fear that Lord Melbourne was right in what he said about Lady\r\nMary Lambton’s[498] great regret at leaving England, the other day;\r\nnamely, her being attached to John Ponsonby,[499] which we think seems\r\nlikely, as he (J. Ponsonby) is the ONLY person to whom Lady Mary has\r\nwritten since she left England. Spoke of Epsom, and Lord Melbourne said\r\nthere was scarcely ever “a Derby without somebody killing himself;\r\ngenerally somebody kills himself; it is not perfect without that,” he\r\nsaid laughing. Spoke of _Don Giovanni_, and the Statue having laughed\r\nso much the other night (about which Lablache told him he was so\r\ndistressed), and Lord Melbourne said the _original_ Piece and Music was\r\nvery old; and on my observing that I thought _this_ music by Mozart\r\nold-fashioned, he clasped his hands and looked up in astonishment....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 3rd June._—We spoke of Music; of Lord Melbourne’s going to\r\nsleep when Thomas Moore was singing, which he would hardly allow.\r\nLord Melbourne quoted some lines to prove that Lydian music used to\r\nput people to sleep; and of Phrygian music, which made people fight.\r\nI showed Lord Melbourne the 1st number of a work called, _Portraits\r\nof the Female Aristocracy_. Then he, and also I, looked at a new Work\r\ncalled _Sketches of the People and Country of the Island of Zealand_,\r\nwhich are very well done. Lord Melbourne said, in opening it, “These\r\nare a fine race, but they eat men, and they say it’s almost impossible\r\nto break them of it.” He farther added, “There are no _animals_\r\nwhatever there, and therefore they are obliged to eat men.” Lady\r\nMulgrave observed that she thought they only eat their enemies; Lord\r\nMelbourne said, “I fancy they eat them pretty promiscuously.” Lord\r\nMelbourne was in excellent spirits, and very funny in his remarks\r\nabout the different drawings; it’s always my delight to make him look\r\nat these sorts of things, as his remarks are always so clever and\r\nfunny. He again said that it was so difficult to break them (the New\r\nZealanders) of eating men; “for they say it’s the very best thing,”\r\nwhich made us laugh. He added, “There was an old woman who was sick,\r\nand they asked her what she would like to have; and she said, ‘I think\r\nI could eat a little piece of the small bone of a boy’s head,’” and he\r\npointed laughing to his own head, explaining _what_ part of the head\r\nthat small bone was.... Lord Melbourne went on speaking of New Zealand,\r\n&c., and said, “The English eat up everything wherever they go; they\r\nexterminate everything”; and Lady Mulgrave and Mr. Murray[500] also\r\nsaid that wherever the English went, they always would have everything\r\ntheir own way, and never would accommodate themselves to other\r\ncountries. “A person in a public situation should write as few private\r\nletters as possible”....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 4th June._—Spoke of the Eton Montem, and I told Lord Melbourne\r\nI was going to the Provost’s house, which he said he was very glad\r\nof. There were two Montems while he was at Eton; he said no one knows\r\nthe origin of the Eton Montem. Formerly there used to be, he said, a\r\nMock Sermon at Salt Hill; a boy dressed like a clergyman and another\r\nlike a clerk delivered a sort of sermon, and in the middle of it the\r\nother boys kicked them down the hill; George III. put a stop to it,\r\nas he thought it very improper. We spoke of the Montem, and of giving\r\nmoney, and Lord Melbourne said he thought he should give £20. I asked\r\nLord Melbourne what he did when Lady Holland goes down to Brocket.\r\n“Oh! I give up the whole house to her,” he replied. And he says she\r\ntwists everything about; not only in her own room but in other rooms\r\ndownstairs. Then she swears she has too much light, and puts out all\r\nthe candles; then too little, and sends for more candles; then she\r\nshuts up first one window, then another. I showed him in the Genealogy\r\nof _Lodge’s Peerage_ how Lord Barham came to his title and how he was\r\nrelated to the Earl of Gainsborough. In looking over it, Lord Melbourne\r\nbegan to speak of Sir Charles Midleton, First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\nmade 1st Lord Barham, and maternal grandfather to Lord Barham. He said\r\nhe was a most distinguished and clever man. He told me, with the tears\r\nin his eyes, an anecdote of what he (Sir C. Midleton) did at the time\r\nof the Mutiny.[501] He was very much for those people and said, “I used\r\nalways to think those poor fellows very hardly treated”; but when he\r\nheard of the Mutiny, he ordered two 74-gun ships to be put broadside of\r\nthe ship in which the Mutineers were, and desire her to surrender, and\r\nif she did not, to send her to the bottom. So they said to him, “But if\r\nthe men should disobey?” “Why, then we shall be in a scrape; but give\r\nyour orders steadily and they won’t disobey.” “That was very fine,”\r\nsaid Lord Melbourne. Spoke of clothes, about which Lord Melbourne was\r\nvery funny; said the fewer you had the better, and that he was certain\r\nit was very bad to keep things in _store_, at which we laughed much,\r\nand said it would be impossible for ladies to keep dresses in store,\r\nas the fashions always changed; and he was against keeping furs, as he\r\nsaid “The moth doth corrupt.” Spoke of Miss Chaworth, Byron’s first\r\nadmiration, about whom Lord Melbourne told a story on Sunday, which I\r\ndid not quite understand, and I begged him to repeat it which he did.\r\nIt was as follows:—Miss Chaworth was told that she would like Lord\r\nByron very much (she _did_ admire him) and would in fact marry him.\r\nShe said, No, she never would; for that if ever she married, it should\r\nbe a man with two straight legs (Byron having one leg and foot quite\r\ndeformed[502] from his birth, which made him limp very much); this was\r\ntold to Byron, whom it shocked most exceedingly, as he was extremely\r\nunhappy and conscious of his lameness, and made him quite indignant.\r\nHe went to her, made her copy a piece of music for him (they had been\r\nin the habit of singing together) in order to have a remembrance of\r\nher, took it, left the house, and never saw her again. Lord Melbourne\r\ntold me there was an awkwardness between the two families; as in George\r\nII.’s reign Miss Chaworth’s ancestor was killed in a duel by a Lord\r\nByron; they quarrelled at a Club, went upstairs, fought and Chaworth\r\nwas killed[503]; Lord Melbourne said it was always suspected that he\r\nhad been killed unfairly, as Chaworth was known to be the best fencer\r\nthere was, and it was thought that Byron passed his sword through him\r\nbefore they fought. Miss Chaworth married afterwards a Mr. Musters and\r\nwas very unhappy; lived on bad terms with her husband, and at last died\r\nderanged. Lord Melbourne said he saw her once, he went over to her\r\nplace, Annesley, when he was staying in Nottinghamshire in 1813, and\r\nstayed there two days. She was then living on very bad terms with her\r\nhusband, and everything was in a very uncomfortable state; but she was\r\nvery kind to Lord Melbourne. I asked Lord Melbourne where Lord Byron\r\nmade the acquaintance of his cousin, Miss Milbanke, now the Dowager\r\nLady Byron; he said at his house, at Whitehall, where Byron used to\r\ncome. Spoke of Irish and Italian servants, who Lord Melbourne says are\r\nvery uncertain and not to be trusted. I asked Lord Melbourne if he had\r\ngood servants; he said, “Not very”; he added, “I’m told that great\r\ndrunkenness prevails in my house,” but that _he_ never saw it, and as\r\nlong as that was the case, he could not much complain; he, _of course_,\r\ncan’t look after them. The man he always takes about with him, when\r\nhe comes here, he says is a very steady, exact man, and always ready;\r\nhe has risen from being a steward’s boy in his house. He told me that\r\nhe has but few servants; a butler, this man, an under butler, and one\r\nfootman; that’s all. He’s likewise told that his expenses in comparison\r\nto other people’s are very great; that the profuseness in his country\r\nhouse was beyond everything, people told him; _he_ does _not_ think the\r\nexpense very great, in fact he says it _cannot_ be, as he is so little\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 5th June._—At a ¼ to 11 we got into our carriages for Montem.\r\nMamma and Lady Mulgrave were with me; Lord Melbourne, Miss Paget, Lord\r\nAlbemarle and Lady Flora were in the next carriage to mine; then Lady\r\nTheresa, Miss Dillon, Lord Conyngham, and Miss Davys; and lastly Lord\r\nLilford, Mr. Murray; Colonel Wemyss and Col. Cavendish. These carriages\r\n_preceded_ us in going to Eton. We were stopped on the Bridge for\r\n“Salt.” When we reached Eton College we were received there by the\r\nProvost,[504] Dr. Hawtrey,[505] and the other Fellows; we went under\r\nthe Cloisters and saw all the boys march by, 3 times, which is a pretty\r\nsight; some of the boys were beautifully dressed. We then all went up\r\nto one of the rooms in the Provost’s house, where we looked out of the\r\nwindow and saw the flag flourished; we then took some luncheon at the\r\nProvost’s, I sitting between the Provost and Lord Melbourne. The only\r\npeople besides our own party there, were, Mrs. Goodall (the Provost’s\r\nwife), Lady Braybrooke,[506] Edward of Saxe-Weimar,[507] Mr. Wood,[508]\r\nand two nieces of the Provost’s. The room in which we lunched is hung\r\nround with many portraits of the young men (now mostly, if indeed not\r\nall, old) who had been at Eton; amongst which were Lord Grey’s, Lord\r\nHolland’s, Lord Wellesley’s, Mr. Canning’s.[509] Lord Melbourne’s was\r\nnot there, which it _ought_ to have been. Lord Melbourne, said he\r\nhad been painted by Hoppner, for Dr. Langford (his Master, but not\r\nthe _Head_ Master, who was then Dr. Heath), and had been sold at the\r\nsale of his things when he died.[510] Lord Melbourne said that Lord\r\nHolland had a fine countenance when young, but always _lame_, there\r\nbeing some ossification in one of his legs; he was “very slim” when\r\nyoung!! After luncheon we got into our carriages again (the other\r\ncarriages _following_ mine), and drove to Salt Hill, where we saw the\r\nboy again flourish the flag. The heat was _quite intense_, and the\r\ncrowd _enormous_! We got back to the Castle at 20 m. to 2. I saw Lord\r\nMelbourne from 7 m. to 2 till 7 m. p. 2, in my room on my return. He\r\nsaid he was not tired, and was very anxious I should not be so. Spoke\r\nof the Montem, the fine boys; he thought they looked “very sheepish”\r\nand shy as they marched by; and the boy (a great big boy) who held up\r\nthe bag for “Salt,” very shy, on the bridge. Lord Melbourne gave £10;\r\nand I £100. Lord Melbourne thought that the Provost and Mrs. Goodall,\r\nknew nobody, for she took Lord Melbourne for Lord Ebrington. It is 69\r\nyears, Lord Melbourne told me (the Provost had said) since he (the\r\nProvost) walked in a Montem! Lord Melbourne was going to dine at Lord\r\nAnglesey’s. He said he was going away directly. He had neither slept\r\nwell. At ½ p. 2 I left Windsor (as I came the day before), and reached\r\nBuckingham Palace at ½ p. 4 or 20 m. to 5....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 6th June._—I showed him the letter from Uncle Leopold\r\nwhich I got yesterday, and in which he touches upon these unhappy\r\nAffairs, wishing _me_ to prevent my Government from taking the lead\r\nin these Affairs, &c., &c.; and saying his position is _des plus\r\nembarassantes_. Lord Melbourne read it over with great attention, and\r\nthen spoke of it all most _kindly_ and sensibly; said he did not see\r\nhow we could get out of this Territorial Arrangement; said he felt\r\nthat Uncle’s position was not an agreeable one, for that he was made\r\nto do what his people disliked and what was extremely unpopular; “and\r\npeople and countries never make allowances for the difficulties Kings\r\nare placed in; the King is made the Instrument of an Act which is\r\nextremely unpopular; and all the blame will fall upon him.” All this\r\nis most true; we spoke of this, and of its being rather hard of Uncle\r\nappealing to my feelings of affection for him. I told him what Uncle\r\nhad said of Stockmar to Van de Weyer, and that Stockmar said he did not\r\nfear all this, and was sure that Uncle would give way in a little time.\r\nLord Melbourne said, “He always says that the pressure of circumstances\r\nwill make him give way, but I think he trusts everything to that\r\npower”; which Lord Melbourne does not think always is the case. He\r\nwas going to show the letter to Lord Palmerston. I showed him another\r\nletter from Ferdinand in answer to mine to him about the Slave Trade;\r\nhe seems very anxious to do what we wish, but stated the difficulties\r\nare so great; which Lord Melbourne said was true.... Before this, Lord\r\nMelbourne said, “Immense crowd at the Montem; my servant told me he\r\nnever saw such a number of people.” Lord Melbourne was in sight of us,\r\nin coming to London, already before Datchet. His servant also told him\r\nthat there were _72_ pair of Post-horses sent down the road yesterday,\r\nand he (Ld. M.) paid 8 guineas for going; whereas in general he only\r\npays 4. Spoke of the Montem; and of the boys there; the Collegers\r\ngenerally stay longer than the others; they must stay till there is\r\na vacancy at King’s, unless they are past 19; he says there are much\r\nfewer little boys than there used to be; the Provost told him “they had\r\nonly 20 in the lower form.” “People don’t send their children as early\r\nas they used to do.” We spoke of the Montem; the deal of money said to\r\nhave been collected, more than ever was known. Lord Melbourne spoke\r\nof the boy who held the bag and looked so sheepish; of the Provost,\r\nwho Lord Melbourne said was an excellent Master; that nobody could\r\nmake a lesson so pleasant to the boys; and that he was “a beautiful\r\nscholar” and “a good-natured man.” Lord Melbourne said that “A Master\r\nshould have great spirits; better spirits than all the boys.” He went\r\non saying, “It’s now 42 years ago since I left Eton, and I should like\r\nvery much to be put back to that time.” He would not like, he said, to\r\ngo through all he _had_ gone through; but to go back to that time, with\r\nhis _present_ experience; “I should manage them all so much better,” he\r\nsaid laughing. He spoke of the extreme love of contradiction children\r\nhave; of the great deal of disputing there used to be formerly in\r\nprivate Society. Lord Egremont used to say, that Society was not near\r\nso amusing as it used to be; people were all so well educated, that\r\nthere were no more any originals to be seen. Lord Melbourne said the\r\nlove of arguing was at an amazing height when he was born; “People used\r\nto argue till they got into a passion and swore at each other.” That\r\npeople always would find the other in the wrong....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 10th June._—I told Lord Melbourne that the Queen Dowager had\r\ncome to me the day before, and had told me that Chambers[511] had told\r\nher that she must not pass another winter in England, and wished her\r\nto go to Madeira, which she declared was too far off; he then named\r\nMalta, to which she assented, and asked my leave to go, and to have\r\na frigate to go in; about which Lord Melbourne said there could not\r\nbe the slightest difficulty. I said she told me she preferred Malta,\r\nas being still in _my_ dominions.... Lady Mulgrave began saying how\r\nmuch mischief the Eton boys committed after the Montem, hacking and\r\ncutting things all to pieces. Of the Montem, its origin; the wish\r\nof some to abolish it; the Provost’s declaring he never would. The\r\nProvost, he told us, is the son of the butler of Lord Lichfield’s\r\ngrandfather. Spoke of Dr. Hawtrey’s introducing much new learning,\r\nwhich the Provost disliked. Spoke of what the boys learn, and many\r\ncoming away amazingly ignorant. What makes the school one, Lord\r\nMelbourne said, is that the most gentlemanly boys are sent there. Lord\r\nMelbourne told us that Talleyrand said, “La _meilleure_ éducation,\r\nc’est l’éducation Publique Anglaise; et c’est _détestable_!” There is\r\none Head Master and an Under Master, and eight other Masters at Eton,\r\nLord Melbourne said. The Masters, he says, who are quite young men,\r\noften require more keeping in order and are more irregular than the\r\nboys. “_My opinion is_,” said Lord Melbourne, “that it does not much\r\nsignify _what_ is taught, if what’s taught is _well_ taught.” Then he\r\nadded, “People too often confound learning and knowledge with talent\r\nand abilities”; for that the two former could not make the two latter.\r\nLord Melbourne was sent to Eton at 9 years old, but had been with a\r\nclergyman before, who taught him on quite a different principle, but\r\nvery well; made him work very hard, with a dictionary, by himself, and\r\nat Eton they construe it to you first; “so that when I came to Eton\r\nI was infinitely superior to most of the other boys, and I could do\r\nmy lessons and theirs too.” That’s because he _always_ was cleverer\r\nthan most other people. He said, “I never was so surprised as when I\r\ncame there; I did not know what to do. It was perhaps 12 o’clock, and\r\nthey said that I might stay out till two. I said, ‘What can I do? Who\r\nis to stay with me now?’ I thought it then very odd, for I had been\r\naccustomed to have 2 or 3 nursery-maids after me, not allowing me to\r\nwet my heels near the water; and here you are let into a field alone,\r\nwith a river running through it, which is 10 feet deep at the bank;\r\nand if you make a false step you’re drowned to a certainty.” Then he\r\nsaid his father gave him a great deal of money, and he ate such a\r\nquantity of tarts, made himself so sick, though he was only there three\r\nweeks when he first went—that he was very ill when he went home, with\r\neruptions and spots over his face. This made us laugh much. Spoke of\r\nthe fighting there, and that the Masters should never allow it to go\r\non long. “I always yielded directly,” he said, “if I found the boy too\r\nmuch for me; after the first round if I found I could not lick the\r\nfellow, I gave it up, and said, ‘Come, this won’t do, I’ll go away,\r\nit’s no use standing to be knocked to pieces.’” All this and a great\r\ndeal more Lord Melbourne told us in the funniest, most delightful way\r\npossible; he is _so_ amusing about himself, and so clever and sensible\r\nabout education.\r\n\r\n_Monday, 11th June._—At 20 m. to 2 Lord Palmerston introduced the\r\nPrince de Ligne to me, Uncle Leopold’s Ambassador to me for the\r\nCoronation; I then went into the Drawing-room where the Prince de Ligne\r\n(who is a gentlemanlike and rather young man) introduced five other\r\nBelgian gentlemen, who have accompanied him. I hear he came in the\r\nmost splendid equipage, with four grey horses. At 7 m. to 2 came my\r\ngood Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 5 m. to 3. He said he was\r\nwell, and we spoke of the weather. He then told me of the difficulty\r\nof replacing the Chief Baron of Ireland (Joy, of whose death he had\r\ntold me last Friday), and he said it was wished, and he thought it was\r\nbest, to make O’Loghlen, now Master of the Rolls, Chief Baron, and to\r\noffer the Mastership of the Rolls to O’Connell; he said O’Connell might\r\npossibly refuse it, but that it might likewise satisfy him and his\r\nparty; on the other hand, the difficulties are, that O’Connell might\r\nnot give up his _agitation_, and that “we,” as Lord Melbourne says, may\r\nbe attacked for it by the other party. He then asked me twice over,\r\n“Have you any particular feeling about it?” I said none whatever, and\r\ntherefore it is left to Ministers to offer it, or not, as they may\r\nthink fit.[512]\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 13th June._—I made Lady Mary Paget[513] sing after\r\ndinner which she did beautifully, two songs before the gentlemen\r\ncame in, the pretty one from _The Ambassadrice_, and one by Alari;\r\nLady Adelaide[514] accompanying her in the last. The gentlemen then\r\ncame in; after this Lady Mary sang the other song by Alari which she\r\nsang at Buckingham Palace; and then “Ah! non giunge” (Lady Adelaide\r\naccompanying her), _most beautifully_, with all Persiani’s ornaments.\r\nThey, particularly Lord Anglesey, then insisted on _my_ singing; which\r\nI did, but literally shaking with fear and fright. I sang “Il superbo\r\nvinctor” from _Il Giuramento_. Lord Melbourne stood opposite me,\r\n_listening_, which really is marvellous, considering he does not care\r\nthe least about music. Lady Mary sang a very pretty little thing from\r\n_Beatrice_; and I then sang “Sogno talor.” We then sat down (at a ¼ p.\r\n10), I sitting on the sofa with Lady Surrey, Lord Melbourne sitting\r\nnear me the whole evening, and several of the other ladies sitting\r\nround the table. I observed to Lord Melbourne how dreadfully frightened\r\nI had been; and he smiled and said “I can quite understand it.” Talked\r\nof Ascot Races; Lord Melbourne said he had not been to Ascot Races\r\nsince he left Eton, _42_ years ago!! The Eton boys are now not allowed\r\nto go to Ascot, but in Lord Melbourne’s days they were much less severe\r\nthan they are now. “My brother” (Pen Lamb) “was a great man on the\r\nTurf. I used always to go to him; I always got leave all the week,\r\nand used to go all the week, and very good fun it used to be,” Lord\r\nMelbourne said.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 14th June._—Spoke of Miss Pitt, and of our fearing she was\r\nattached to her brother-in-law; Lord Melbourne said such a marriage\r\ncould not take place now[515]; that the _Law_ preventing it was only\r\nmade last year. Till then such a marriage could take place; but was\r\nvoid, if any of the parties made objections to such marriage. This Bill\r\nmade good all such marriages which had taken place (like the Duke of\r\nBeaufort’s[516]) but prevented any others being made. Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid he did not know if it was right or wrong; we spoke of it for a\r\nlittle while.[517] I then asked him if he thought it would be well, if,\r\non occasions like the Races, I should wear my Star and Ribbon; he said\r\nyes.[518] I said to him also, that, if he did not dislike it, I should\r\nbe so very happy if he would wear the Windsor Uniform when he came down\r\nto Windsor; he replied kindly, “I shall be very happy,” and I added I\r\nhoped he would often be at Windsor.[519]\r\n\r\n_Friday, 15th June._—I told him that I had been reading in the morning\r\nin Coxe’s _Life of Walpole_; which I found very interesting, but that\r\nI had got a good deal puzzled with the South Sea Company, and the\r\n_Redeemable_ and _Irredeemable_ debt; and that it was very difficult\r\nand puzzling, which he said it was, and that I should not trouble or\r\npuzzle myself with that part of the book, which is not clearly written;\r\nand he explained to me in a few words and in his clear delightful\r\nway, like a father to his child, this difficult South Sea Scheme. We\r\nspoke of that strange proposition, the Peerage Bill,[520] which is\r\ncuriously told in Coxe’s _Life_. “That was all a party scheme,” said\r\nLord Melbourne; “and done with a view to cripple George II.” “If that\r\nhad been done,” he continued, “there would be hardly any peerages left\r\nnow.” Lord Melbourne was speaking of how many peerages, _of that time_,\r\nwere extinct; and that there were now 20 peers in the House of Lords\r\nwithout heirs. I likewise told him that the Duke of Wellington had let\r\nme know that George IV. and William IV. always wore the _Order of the\r\nBath_ on that day—Waterloo Day—as also on the anniversary of the battle\r\nof Trafalgar; and I asked Lord Melbourne if he thought I should do so,\r\nor not. He said he thought I should. I observed I did not like giving\r\nup my _Blue Ribbon_, _even_ for one night; but if he wished it I would\r\ndo so. He said, “If you don’t dislike it, I think you should do it; it\r\nwill be considered a compliment to the Army....”[521]\r\n\r\n_Monday, 18th June._—Lord Melbourne then gave me a list of the\r\nCreations and Advancements which are to take place, which are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  The Earl of Mulgrave    Marquis of Normanby\r\n  Lord Dundas             Earl of Zetland\r\n  The Earl of Kintore     Baron Kintore\r\n    (Scotch)\r\n  The Viscount Lismore    Baron Lismore of Shanbally\r\n    (Irish)                 Castle in the\r\n                            County of Tipperary\r\n  The Lord Rossmore       Baron Rossmore of the\r\n    (Irish)                 County of Monaghan\r\n  The Lord Carew          Baron Carew of Castle\r\n    (Irish)                 Boro in the County of\r\n                            Wexford\r\n  The Hon. Wm. S. C.      Baron de Mauley\r\n    Ponsonby\r\n  Sir John Wrottesley,    Baron Wrottesley of\r\n    Bart.                   Wrottesley in the\r\n                            County of Stafford\r\n  Charles Hanbury         Baron Sudeley\r\n    Tracy, Esq.\r\n  Paul Methuen, Esq., of  Baron Methuen of Corsham.\r\n    Corsham in the\r\n    County of Wilts\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne said he wished to add two more,[522] with my consent,\r\nnamely, Lord King,[523] an Earl; and to call up Lord Carmarthen[524] to\r\nthe House of Lords. I of course consented to both. Before I say another\r\nword, I must not omit to mention that I wrote a letter to Stockmar\r\nbegging him to mention to Lord Melbourne my anxious wish to give him\r\nthe _Blue Ribbon_ (which I offered to him through Stockmar already last\r\nyear, immediately upon my accession, and which he refused in the most\r\nnoble manner), as I said I felt I owed him so much; and he had been\r\nand was so very kind to me that it would grieve me to be giving other\r\npeople honours whom I cared not about, and him nothing. Stockmar told\r\nme this morning he had shown Lord Melbourne my letter and that Lord\r\nMelbourne would speak to me on the subject. Accordingly Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid to me, “The Baron showed me your letter, and I feel very grateful,\r\nI am very sensible of Your Majesty’s kindness”; upon which I assured\r\nhim he was quite right (having previously heard from Stockmar that\r\nhe would decline it); “I hope,” he continued, “you don’t think I’ve\r\nany contempt for these things, but it gives me such a command”; which\r\nis most true; “and therefore you’ll allow me to decline it.”[525] I\r\nadded I thought him quite right but that _I_ could not do less. This\r\nis a fine noble disinterested act, and worthy of Lord Melbourne, and\r\nI honour, esteem and admire him the more for it; it only increases my\r\nfondness of him....[526] [**F1: no anchor apparent in text]\r\n\r\n_Friday, 22nd June._—At a ¼ p. 2 came Marshal Soult, Due de Dalmatie,\r\nwho was introduced by Lord Glenelg. I was very curious to see him; he\r\nis not tall, but very broad, and one leg quite crooked from having been\r\nseverely wounded; his complexion is dark, and he has the appearance\r\nof great age; his features are hard, and he speaks slowly and\r\nindistinctly. His eyes are piercing; he seemed much embarrassed. I then\r\nwent into the outer room, where he presented his 12 (I think) Attachés\r\nto me, amongst whom were the Marquis de Dalmatie (his son), and his\r\nson-in-law. Wrote to Aunt Louise. At 3 came Lord Melbourne, and stayed\r\nwith me till 4. He asked how I was, and was sorry to hear I had so much\r\nto do. I told him I had just seen Soult, who was so much embarrassed;\r\nwhich Lord Melbourne said he was also when he came to him; and that he\r\nnever would understand anything, and that he made Lord Melbourne repeat\r\nthe things over 20 times. He gave me a list of the names to be made\r\nBaronets on the occasion of the Coronation; there are 30; amongst whom\r\nare Mr. E. Lytton Bulwer and Mr. Micklethwait,[527] which last I must\r\nsay Lord Melbourne has been most exceedingly kind about. I then begged\r\nhim to add (to write down) the two following names to the list of Peers\r\nwhich he gave me the other day, and which he did; Lord King to be Earl\r\nof Lovelace, and Viscount Ockham in the County of Surrey; and the\r\nMarquis of Carmarthen to be called up by the title of Baron Osborne....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 27th June._—At 20 m. p. 4 I went with Lady Lansdowne and\r\nLady Barham (the Duchess of Sutherland going in her own carriage,\r\nas she feared an open one), and Lord Conyngham and Col. Wemyss to\r\nWestminster Abbey to see all the Preparations for to-morrow. The\r\nstreets were full of people, and preparations of all kinds. I was\r\nreceived at the Abbey by Lord Melbourne, the Duke of Norfolk, Sir\r\nWilliam Woods,[528] and Sir Benjamin Stevenson. The whole thing is\r\nbeautifully and splendidly and very conveniently done; Lord Melbourne\r\nmade me try the various thrones (that is, two) which was very\r\nfortunate, as they were both too low. I came home again as I went\r\n(crowds in the streets and all _so_ friendly) at 5. The preparations\r\nfor Fairs, Balloons, &c. in the Parks, quite changes all, and the\r\nencampments of the Artillery, with all their white tents, has a very\r\npretty effect. I did not think Lord Melbourne looking well, though he\r\nsaid he was better. I’m very glad I went to the Abbey, as I shall now\r\nknow exactly where I’m to go, and be. The Duchess of Sutherland came\r\nto ask for further Orders a few minutes after I had got home, and said\r\nshe had taken Lord Melbourne in her carriage to Downing Street which\r\nis only one step from the Abbey. He walked _to_ the Abbey. Wrote my\r\njournal. At ½ p. 7 we dined.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 28th June!_—I was awoke at four o’clock by the guns in\r\nthe Park, and could not get much sleep afterwards on account of the\r\nnoise of the people, bands, &c., &c. Got up at 7 feeling strong and\r\nwell; the Park presented a curious spectacle; crowds of people up to\r\nConstitution Hill, soldiers, bands, &c. I dressed, having taken a\r\nlittle breakfast before I dressed, and a little after. At ½ p. 9 I\r\nwent into the next room dressed exactly in my House of Lords costume;\r\nand met Uncle Ernest, Charles and Feodore (who had come a few minutes\r\nbefore into my dressing-room), Lady Lansdowne, Lady Normanby, the\r\nDuchess of Sutherland, and Lady Barham, all in their robes. At 10 I\r\ngot into the State Coach with the Duchess of Sutherland and Lord\r\nAlbemarle, and we began our Progress. It was a fine day, and the crowds\r\nof people exceeded what I have ever seen; many as there were the day\r\nI went to the City, it was nothing—nothing to the multitudes, the\r\nmillions of my loyal subjects who were assembled in _every spot_ to\r\nwitness the Procession. Their good-humour and excessive loyalty was\r\nbeyond everything, and I really cannot say _how_ proud I feel to be\r\nthe Queen of _such_ a _Nation_. I was alarmed at times for fear that\r\nthe people would be crushed and squeezed on account of the tremendous\r\nrush and pressure. I reached the Abbey amid deafening cheers at a\r\nlittle after ½ p. 11; I first went into a robing-room quite close to\r\nthe entrance, where I found my eight Train-bearers: Lady Caroline\r\nLennox, Lady Adelaide Paget, Lady Mary Talbot, Lady Fanny Cowper, Lady\r\nWilhelmina Stanhope, Lady Anne Fitzwilliam, Lady Mary Grimston, and\r\nLady Louisa Jenkinson,—all dressed alike and beautifully, in white\r\nsatin and silver tissue, with wreaths of silver corn-ears in front,\r\nand a small one of pink roses round the plait behind, and pink roses\r\nin the trimming of the dresses. After putting on my Mantle, and the\r\nyoung ladies having properly got hold of it, and Lord Conyngham holding\r\nthe end of it, I left the robing-room and the Procession began. The\r\nsight was splendid; the bank of Peeresses quite beautiful, all in\r\ntheir robes, and the Peers on the other side. My young Train-bearers\r\nwere always near me, and helped me whenever I wanted anything. The\r\nBishop of Durham[529] stood on one side near me. At the beginning of\r\nthe Anthem where I’ve made a mark, I retired to St. Edward’s Chapel,\r\na small dark place immediately behind the Altar, with my Ladies and\r\nTrain-bearers; took off my crimson robe and kirtle and put on the\r\nSupertunica of Cloth of Gold, also in the shape of a kirtle, which was\r\nput over a singular sort of little gown of linen trimmed with lace; I\r\nalso took off my circlet of diamonds, and then proceeded bare-headed\r\ninto the Abbey; I was then seated upon St. Edward’s chair where the\r\nDalmatic robe was clasped round me by the Lord Great Chamberlain.\r\nThen followed all the various things; and last (of those things) the\r\nCrown being placed on my head;—which was, I must own, a most beautiful\r\nimpressive moment; _all_ the Peers and Peeresses put on their Coronets\r\nat the same instant. My excellent Lord Melbourne, who stood very close\r\nto me throughout the whole ceremony, was _completely_ overcome at this\r\nmoment, and very much affected; he gave me _such_ a kind, and I may\r\nsay _fatherly_ look. The shouts, which were very great, the drums, the\r\ntrumpets, the firing of the guns, all at the same instant, rendered\r\nthe spectacle most imposing. The Enthronization and the Homage of, 1st\r\nall the Bishops, then my Uncles, and lastly of all the Peers, in their\r\nrespective order, was very fine. The Duke of Norfolk (holding for me\r\nthe Sceptre with a Cross) with Lord Melbourne, stood close to me on my\r\nright, and the Duke of Richmond with the other Sceptre on my left. All\r\nmy Train-bearers standing behind the Throne. Poor old Lord Rolle, who\r\nis 82 and dreadfully infirm, in attempting to ascend the steps, fell\r\nand rolled quite down, but was not the least hurt; when he attempted\r\nto reascend them I got up and advanced to the end of the steps, in\r\norder to prevent another fall. When Lord Melbourne’s turn to do Homage\r\ncame, there was loud cheering; they also cheered Lord Grey and the\r\nDuke of Wellington; it’s a pretty ceremony; they first all touch the\r\nCrown; and then kiss my hand. When my good Lord Melbourne knelt down\r\nand kissed my hand, he pressed my hand and I grasped his with all my\r\nheart, at which he looked up with his eyes filled with tears and seemed\r\nmuch touched, as he was, I observed, throughout the whole ceremony.\r\nAfter the Homage was concluded I left the Throne, took off my Crown and\r\nreceived the Sacrament; I then put on my Crown again, and re-ascended\r\nthe Throne, leaning on Lord Melbourne’s arm; at the commencement of the\r\nAnthem I descended from the Throne, and went into St. Edward’s Chapel\r\nwith my Ladies, Train-bearers, and Lord Willoughby, where I took off\r\nthe Dalmatic robe, Supertunica, and put on the Purple Velvet Kirtle and\r\nMantle, and proceeded again to the Throne, which I ascended leaning\r\non Lord Melbourne’s hand. There was another present at this ceremony,\r\nin the box immediately above the Royal Box, and who witnessed all; it\r\nwas Lehzen, whose eyes I caught when on the Throne, and we exchanged\r\nsmiles. She and Späth, Lady John Russell and Mr. Murray saw me leave\r\nthe Palace, arrive at the Abbey, leave the Abbey and again return to\r\nthe Palace!! I then again descended from the Throne, and repaired\r\nwith all the Peers bearing the Regalia, my Ladies and Train-bearers,\r\nto St. Edward’s Chapel, as it is called; but which, as Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid, was more _unlike_ a Chapel than anything he had ever seen; for,\r\nwhat was _called_ an _Altar_ was covered with sandwiches, bottles\r\nof wine, &c. The Archbishop came in and _ought_ to have delivered\r\nthe Orb to me, but I had already got it. There we waited for some\r\nminutes; Lord Melbourne took a glass of wine, for he seemed completely\r\ntired; the Procession being formed, I replaced my Crown (which I had\r\ntaken off for a few minutes), took the Orb in my left hand and the\r\nSceptre in my right, and thus _loaded_ proceeded through the Abbey,\r\nwhich resounded with cheers, to the first Robing-room, where I found\r\nthe Duchess of Gloucester, Mamma, and the Duchess of Cambridge with\r\ntheir ladies. And here we waited for at least an hour, with _all_ my\r\nladies and Train-bearers; the Princesses went away about half an hour\r\nbefore I did; the Archbishop had put the ring on the wrong finger,\r\nand the consequence was that I had the greatest difficulty to take\r\nit off again,—which I at last did with great pain. Lady Fanny, Lady\r\nWilhelmina, and Lady Mary Grimston looked quite beautiful. At about ½\r\np. 4 I re-entered my carriage, the Crown on my head and Sceptre and\r\nOrb in my hand, and we proceeded the same way as we came—the crowds if\r\npossible having increased. The enthusiasm, affection and loyalty was\r\nreally touching, and I shall ever remember this day as the _proudest_\r\nof my life. I came home at a little after 6,—really _not_ feeling\r\ntired.[530]\r\n\r\nAt 8 we dined. Besides we 13, Lord Melbourne and Lord Surrey[531] dined\r\nhere. Lord Melbourne came up to me and said, “I must congratulate you\r\non this most brilliant day,” and that all had gone off _so_ well. He\r\nsaid he was not tired, and was in high spirits. I sat between Uncle\r\nErnest and Lord Melbourne, and Lord Melbourne between me and Feodore,\r\nwhom he had led in. My kind Lord Melbourne was much affected in\r\nspeaking of the whole ceremony. He asked kindly if I was tired; said\r\nthe Sword he carried (the 1st, the Sword of State) was excessively\r\nheavy. I said that the Crown hurt me a good deal. He was much amused at\r\nUncle Ernest’s being astonished at our still having the Litany[532];\r\nwe agreed that the whole thing was a very fine sight. He thought the\r\nrobes,[533] and particularly the Dalmatic, “looked remarkably well.”\r\n“And you did it all so well; excellent!” said he with the tears in his\r\neyes. He said he thought I looked rather pale, and “moved by all the\r\npeople” when I arrived; “and that’s natural.” The Archbishop’s and\r\nDean’s Copes (which were remarkably handsome) were from James the 1st’s\r\ntime; the very same that were worn at his Coronation, Lord Melbourne\r\ntold me. Spoke of the Duc de Nemours[534] being like his father in\r\nface; of the young ladies’ (Train-bearers’) dresses which he thought\r\nbeautiful; and he said he thought the Duchess of Richmond (who had\r\nordered the make of the dresses, and had been much condemned by some\r\nof the young ladies for it) quite right. She said to him, “One thing I\r\nwas determined about; that I would have no discussion with their Mammas\r\nabout it.” Spoke of Talleyrand and Soult having been much struck by\r\nthe ceremony of the Coronation; of the English being far too generous\r\n_not_ to be kind to Soult. Lord Melbourne went home the night before,\r\nand slept very deeply till he was woke at 6 in the morning. I said I\r\ndid not sleep well. Spoke of the Illuminations and Uncle Ernest’s wish\r\nto see them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.S.H. Feodora_\r\n\r\n  _Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg_\r\n\r\n  _from a portrait by Gutekunst 1830_]\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, before we sat down, we—that is, Charles, Lord Melbourne\r\nand I—spoke of the numbers of Peers at the Coronation, which Lord\r\nMelbourne said was unprecedented. I observed that there were very few\r\nViscounts; he said, “There are very few Viscounts”[535]; that they\r\nwere an odd sort of title, and not really English; that they came\r\nfrom Vice-Comités; that Dukes and Barons were the only _real_ English\r\ntitles; that Marquises were likewise not English; and that they made\r\npeople Marquises when they did not wish to make them Dukes. Spoke of\r\nLord Audley who came as the 1st Baron, and who Lord Melbourne said was\r\nof a very old family; his ancestor was a Sir Something Audley[536]\r\nin the time of the Black Prince, who with Chandos gained the Battle\r\nof Poitiers. I then sat on the sofa for a little while with Lady\r\nBarham and then with Charles; Lord Melbourne sitting near me the whole\r\nevening. Mamma and Feodore remained to see the Illuminations, and only\r\ncame in later, and Mamma went away before I did. Uncle Ernest drove\r\nout to see the Illuminations. I said to Lord Melbourne when I\r\nfirst sat down, I felt a little tired on my feet; “You must be very\r\ntired,” he said. Spoke of the weight of the robes, &c.; the Coronets;\r\nand he turned round to me, and said _so_ kindly, “And you did it\r\nbeautifully,—every part of it, with so much taste; it’s a thing that\r\nyou can’t give a person advice upon; it must be left to a person.” To\r\nhear this, from this kind impartial friend, gave me great and real\r\npleasure. Mamma and Feodore came back just after he said this. Spoke\r\nof these Bishops’ Copes, about which he was very funny; of the Pages,\r\nwho were such a nice set of boys and who were so handy, Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid, that they kept them near them the whole time. Little Lord\r\nStafford[537] and Slane (Lord Mountcharles)[538] were Pages to their\r\nfathers and looked lovely; Lord Paget[539] was Lord Melbourne’s Page\r\nand remarkably handy, he said. Spoke again of the young ladies’ dress\r\nabout which he was very amusing; he waited for his carriage with Lady\r\nMary Talbot and Lady Wilhelmina; he thinks Lady Fanny does not make as\r\nmuch show as other girls, which I would not allow. He set off for the\r\nAbbey from his house at ½ p. 8, and was there long before anybody else;\r\nhe only got home at ½ p. 6, and had to go round by Kensington. He said\r\nthere was a large breakfast in the Jerusalem Chamber, where they met\r\n_before_ all began; he said laughing that whenever the clergy or a Dean\r\nand Chapter had anything to do with anything, there’s sure to be plenty\r\nto eat. Spoke of my intending to go to bed; he said, “You may depend\r\nupon it, you are more tired than you think you are.” I said I had slept\r\nbadly the night before; he said that was my mind, and that nothing kept\r\npeople more awake than any consciousness of a great event going to take\r\nplace and being agitated. He was not sure if he was not going to the\r\nDuke of Wellington’s.\r\n\r\nStayed in the drawing-room till 20 m. p. 11, but remained till 12\r\no’clock on Mamma’s balcony looking at the fireworks in Green Park,\r\nwhich were quite beautiful.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 29th June._—I told Lord M. that I had been quarrelling with\r\nFeodore about Louis Philippe, whom she called a Usurper, and that I\r\ntold her he was not, and that we disagreed amazingly about it; he\r\nsmiled. That she called our William III. and Mary Usurpers; Lord\r\nMelbourne said it was that strong feeling of the divine right of Kings\r\nwhich some people have; that many people would not be convinced that\r\nLouis Philippe had _not_ organised that Revolution; but that it did\r\nnot do, he said, to wish well to the Family and not to Louis Philippe\r\nas Feodore did; for that the happiness of the _one_ depended on the\r\n_other_....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 8th July._—Got up at 20 m. to 10 and breakfasted at 11.\r\nSigned. Heard from Lord Melbourne that, “He finds himself much better\r\nthis morning and will wait upon Your Majesty about three or a little\r\nafter.” At ½ p. 3 came my excellent Lord Melbourne and stayed with me\r\ntill a ¼ p. 4. He looks very thin and pulled as I think, but was in\r\nexcellent spirits and as kind as ever. He said he felt much better\r\ntoday, but that his knee was still stiff and had been very painful\r\nyesterday. It’s the same leg (the left) which was first bad, but the\r\n_foot_ was nearly well; he wore large loose shoes and no straps to\r\nhis trousers. I showed Lord Melbourne a letter from Lord Glenelg I\r\nhad got about Lord Durham and a letter from Lady Durham. And Lord\r\nMelbourne showed me one from Lord Palmerston about Van de Weyer’s being\r\nasked, and about the Ladies of the Ambassadors having some seat at the\r\nBalls....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 9th July._—At a ¼ p. 11 I went with Mamma and the Duchess\r\nof Sutherland, Feodore, Lady Barham, Lord Conyngham, Lord Albemarle,\r\nMiss Pitt, Lady Flora, Späth, Lord Fingall, Miss Spring Rice, and Miss\r\nDavys, Lady Harriet Clive and Mr. Murray to a Review in Hyde Park,\r\nof which I subjoin an account. I could have cried almost not to have\r\n_ridden_ and been in _my right_ place as I ought; but Lord Melbourne\r\nand Lord Hill thought it more prudent on account of the great crowd\r\nthat I should not _this_ time do so,[540] which however now they all\r\nsee I might have done, and Lord Anglesey (who had the command of\r\nthe day, looked so handsome, and did it beautifully and gracefully)\r\nregretted much I did not ride. I drove down the lines. All the Foreign\r\nPrinces and Ambassadors were there, and the various uniforms looked\r\nvery pretty. The troops never looked handsomer or did better; and I\r\nheard their praises from all the Foreigners and particularly from\r\nSoult. There was an immense crowd and all so friendly and kind to me....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 11th July._—Spoke of Soult, and that Uncle Ernest said\r\nthat the Duc de Nemours told him that Soult was in excellent humour\r\nhere, in better humour than he had ever seen him. Lord Melbourne\r\nseemed pleased. He said he was not at all surprised at the manner in\r\nwhich the English received Soult; as they were always curious to see\r\ndistinguished foreigners. During the War, at the Peace of Amiens when\r\nMarshal Orison[541] came over, they took the horses out of his carriage\r\nand dragged him through the streets; “and that was in the midst of\r\nwar,” he continued. “Many people were rather annoyed at that; but\r\nthat was from mere curiosity.” I spoke of Feodore, and asked him if\r\nhe saw any likeness between us; he said, “I see the likeness, though\r\nnot perhaps very strong.” I spoke of her children and of Charles (her\r\neldest) being her favourite, as he was so much the fondest of her. Lord\r\nMelbourne said smiling that one must not judge according to that, and\r\nto the _manner_ in which children _showed_ their love; “Children are\r\ngreat dissemblers; remember how Lear was deceived by that. They learn\r\nto be the greatest hypocrites,” he said.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 12th July._—Lord Melbourne said that they were going to\r\nhave a Cabinet upon what O’Connell and Sir Robert Peel declared in the\r\nHouse of Commons, the day before yesterday, upon the Irish Tithes. They\r\nproposed that the sum left from the sum which was voted in 1833 for the\r\ndistressed Clergy, should be employed to pay the arrears of Tithes\r\ndue. I asked Lord Melbourne if he thought this a good plan; he said it\r\nwould have the effect of quieting the people, but that it was “rather a\r\nlavish way of bestowing the Public Money.” In general, Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid, when any sum of the kind is voted for a certain class of people,\r\nmany miss it who ought to get it, and many get it who ought not to get\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n_Friday, 13th July._—Lord Melbourne said Ellice had told him that they\r\ncheered Soult amazingly when he went to Eton (that day), and Ellice\r\ntold him he must ask for a Holiday, which he did, upon which the Boys\r\ncheered him much more; he shook hands with some of the Boys, and then\r\nthey all wished to shake hands with him, so he shook hands with the\r\nwhole school....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 17th July._—He (Ld. M.) said that the Sutherlands had a large\r\nfamily; and asked if the last was a boy or girl, at which I laughed\r\nvery much, as I said he _ought_ to know; he said boys were much more\r\nexpensive than girls; there was only the girl’s dress that could be\r\nexpensive and perhaps Masters; but nothing to what boys’ going to\r\nschool cost. I said that younger sons were always so poor, and that\r\ngirls married; he said certainly that was so, and even if girls did not\r\nmarry they wanted less money. I said Feodore at one time liked having\r\nboys much better than girls, but she did not now, as she thought that\r\nboys got into more difficulties and scrapes than girls. “Men certainly\r\nget into more scrapes than girls,” said Lord Melbourne; “but there is\r\nrisk in both.” We spoke of other things; and he said Lord Ebrington\r\nhad come to him and spoken to him about its being reported that I had\r\nso many French things, and that the lace of the Servants’ coats came\r\nfrom France; which I said I knew nothing about, and I assured him I had\r\nquantities of English things, but must sometimes have French things.\r\nHe said he knew quite well it was so, and that it was impossible not\r\nto have French things, if one wished to be well dressed. That it was\r\nnot so much the material, but the make which we English could not do;\r\nhe said they never could make a cap or a bonnet; and that the English\r\nwomen dressed so ill....\r\n\r\n_Monday, 24th July._—We spoke of Sir Edmund Lyons,[542] who writes such\r\nlong despatches; and who Lord Melbourne has never seen before; he was\r\na Naval Officer and never employed before in the Diplomatic Service.\r\nHe was the Captain who took out Otho. I then went over to the Closet,\r\nwhere the Prince Royal of Bavaria was introduced by Lord Palmerston and\r\nBaron Cetto. Having neither attendants nor uniform, he came in morning\r\nattire. He is not quite good-looking, but nearly so,—slim, not very\r\ntall, but very gentlemanlike and agreeable and lively. I made him sit\r\ndown, and he was completely _à son aise_ and consequently put _me_ at\r\nease. I showed Lord Melbourne Hayter’s sketch for his great picture\r\nof the Coronation; which Lord Melbourne liked very much, and which\r\nwas very generally admired; Lord Melbourne looked at it for some time\r\nobserving upon each part; he said that Hayter would never get it as\r\ngood in the large picture as he had got it here. I then said to Lord\r\nMelbourne that I thought the Coronation made him ill, and all the worry\r\nof it; he said he thought he would have been ill without it; “It wasn’t\r\nthe _Coronation_,” he said, “it was all these Peerages; but I think\r\nthat’s subsiding a little now.” I asked if Lord Derby expected being\r\nmade a Duke; Lord Melbourne replied, “No, I don’t think he did; I told\r\nhim at once that could not be, and that generally satisfies people.”\r\nLord Derby has a very good claim for it, Lord Melbourne said, for the\r\nfollowing reasons:—George III. declared he never would make any Dukes,\r\nand wished to reserve that Title _only_ for the Royal Family; and he\r\nonly made 2, Lord Melbourne thinks—the Duke of Northumberland and the\r\nDuke of Montagu[543]; Mr. Fox told the late Lord Derby that if he could\r\never make the King waive his objections, _he_ should be made a Duke;\r\nand _this_, Lord Melbourne said, certainly was a strong pledge for a\r\nWhig Government; but Lord Grey passed him over (Ld. M. doesn’t know\r\nwhy) and made the Duke of Sutherland and the Duke of Cleveland; and\r\nLord Derby said in his letter to Lord Melbourne, “he did not see why\r\nthe names of Vane (D. of Cleveland), Grenville (Duke of Buckingham),\r\nand Grosvenor (Ld. Westminster), should be preferred before him.”[544]\r\nHe did not mention _Gower_, Lord Melbourne thinks from civility,\r\nbut that he _feels_ the same respecting him. I asked _what Duke_ he\r\nwished to be; Lord Melbourne said he supposed Duke of Derby, which\r\nwas formerly a Royal title, having belonged to the Dukes of Lancaster;\r\nhe takes his title from Derby, a Hundred of Lancashire—_not_ from the\r\nC^o. of Derby. He thinks, Lord Melbourne continued, that he has a right\r\nto be Duke of Hamilton, through his mother, Lady Elizabeth Hamilton,\r\nwho was daughter to James, 6th Duke of Hamilton, and a very handsome\r\nperson; I asked who she married afterwards; Lord Melbourne replied,\r\n“It was a very awkward business; she _married_ nobody; she had a great\r\nattachment for the Duke of Dorset” (father to the late), “Lord Derby\r\nparted from her, but would not divorce her, in order that she might\r\nnot marry the Duke of Dorset.” “The Duke of Dorset,” Lord Melbourne\r\ncontinued, “was a very handsome and agreeable man; with a great deal\r\nof gallantry....” I asked Lord Melbourne what sort of person Charles\r\nSheridan was; he said an agreeable lively young man; but rather wild.\r\nWe then spoke for a long time about all the Sheridans. C. Sheridan was\r\nin the Admiralty and rose to get £300 a year; but they fancied, he\r\nsaid, that he was in bad health, and made him give it up. There are\r\nthree sons, Brinsley, Frank (who is with Lord Normanby), and Charles;\r\n“They are, like all the Sheridans, clever but careless, and have no\r\napplication,” he said. They plagued Lord Melbourne constantly to give\r\nCharles a place; and Lord Melbourne offered him a Clerkship in the\r\nAudit Office; but he would not have that, and said it was less than\r\nhe had had. George Anson[545] told Lord Melbourne it would be quite\r\nnonsense to give it to him, as he would never come, and there would be\r\na complaint of him the first month. Lord Melbourne said that a person\r\nwho leaves the situation he has, must not expect to be put in again in\r\nthe same place he had. This is a £100 a year, “which is better than\r\nnothing.” I observed that a person who does not wish to submit to that\r\ncannot be very anxious to do much, in which Lord Melbourne agreed.\r\nThis Charles Sheridan lives a good deal with the Chesterfields, and\r\npositively has nothing.[546] Lord Melbourne said, “I know they’ll get\r\nruined, and we shall have to provide for them.” “They all have £60 a\r\nyear.” There is one Charles Sheridan, an excessively ugly man, who\r\nis Uncle to all these people; he is Brinsley Sheridan’s son by his\r\n2nd wife; his 1st wife was a professional singer, a Miss Linley, whom\r\nLord Melbourne remembers when he was a boy; she died in 1794; she was\r\nexcessively handsome[547]; “The women” (Lady Seymour) “are very like\r\nher; some of them,” he said. Spoke of young Brinsley Sheridan running\r\naway with his wife; of Lady Seymour, who, Lord Melbourne said, “is the\r\nmost _posée_ of them all.” “She says those odd things,” Lord Melbourne\r\ncontinued, “as if they were quite natural.” They (the Seymours) are\r\nalways teazing Lord Melbourne about _Titles_, and are so vexed at their\r\nboy’s having no title; and they never will call him anything else but\r\nthe _Baby_[548]; I said that was foolish; “Very foolish; and I’ve told\r\nthem so,” replied Lord Melbourne, “but I can’t convince them.” The\r\nSheridan[549] who wrote the Dictionary was Great-Grandfather to all\r\nthese; his Wife was a very clever woman, Lord Melbourne said, and wrote\r\nsome very good books; “they have been a very distinguished family for a\r\nlong time,” he added.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 25th July._—At a ¼ to 4 I _rode_ out with Lady Portman, Lord\r\nUxbridge, Lord Lilford, Lord Portman, Col. Buckley, Col. Cavendish,\r\nand Miss Quentin, &c., and came home at 6. I rode _dear Tartar_ who\r\nwent most beautifully; it was a delightful ride; we rode to Acton, and\r\nround by East Acton home. We never rode _harder_. We cantered almost\r\nthe whole way going out, but coming home we _galloped_ at least for _3\r\nmiles_ without _once_ pulling up. We came home through the Park and in\r\nat the front entrance of the Palace. It was a charming ride. At 7 we\r\ndined. Besides we 13 (Lady Charlemont, Lord Headfort, Lady Caroline\r\nBarrington, and Wm. Cowper replacing Lord Byron, Lady Tavistock, Mrs.\r\nCampbell, and Sir H. Seton), Lord Conyngham dined here. I sat between\r\nLord Conyngham and Lord Headfort. At a ¼ p. 8 I went to the Opera with\r\nMamma, dear Feo, Lady Charlemont, Lady Caroline, Miss Cavendish, Lord\r\nConyngham, Lord Headfort, Mr. Cowper, Col. Buckley, Col. Cavendish, and\r\nLady Flora. It was _I Puritani_, and Lablache and Grisi were singing\r\ntheir Duo when we came in. Unfortunately poor Grisi was taken ill,\r\nquite at the end of the 1st act, and was unable consequently to sing\r\nher fine Scene in the 2nd act. Fanny Elsler danced the Chachucha (at\r\nmy desire) between the 2nd and 3rd acts.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 26th July._—Lord Melbourne said, “Lord Duncannon tells\r\nme he thinks that marriage of Lord Shelburne’s[550] is quite off.”\r\nLord Melbourne said that somebody said to him (Ld. Shelburne) how\r\nhandsome Miss Elphinstone was; upon which he replied, “I don’t think\r\nso; but beauty is not the thing to look to in a Wife.” Now this may\r\nhave been repeated to her, Lord Melbourne says, and of course could\r\nnot please her; and the young lady may have said, Lord Melbourne\r\ncontinued, “Why, you don’t seem to show that fondness for me you ought\r\nto have, and therefore I think we’d better break it off altogether.”\r\nLady Kerry,[551] he said, had told Lord Duncannon that she believed\r\nit was all off; I observed, _Why_ then had Lord Lansdowne announced\r\nit to me, if it was not quite settled?—Lord Melbourne said, “The same\r\nthing happened to Lord Duncannon that happened to you”; Lord Lansdowne\r\nannounced it to him—said it gave him great pleasure—that it was very\r\nnearly settled but they did not wish to speak of it for the present;\r\n“and two hours afterwards he got a letter from Lansdowne, saying it\r\nwas not at all settled,” and that he should not mention it.[552] Lord\r\nMelbourne then asked if I had got the letter he sent me, from the\r\nDuchess of Sutherland to him, saying her sister Lady Burlington[553]\r\ngladly accepted the situation of Lady of the Bedchamber; and Lord\r\nMelbourne said, “That may now be considered as settled”; and that Lady\r\nLansdowne had best be spoken to about it all; which I begged him to\r\nbe kind enough to do, which he said he would. I told Lord Melbourne\r\nthat Conyngham had told me that he heard from Frederic Byng, that Lord\r\nEssex[554] was so _excessively_ pleased at my having called up Lady\r\nEssex (Miss Stephens, the Singer that was, and married about 2 or 3\r\nmonths ago to Lord Essex) at the Ball, and having spoken to her; this\r\ntouched Lord Melbourne; we both agreed she was a very nice person.[555]\r\nWrote my journal. At a ¼ to 8 I went into the Throne room with my\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, Feo and Mamma, where I found the Duchess of\r\nGloucester, the Duke of Sussex, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and\r\nAugusta and George. After waiting a little while we went into the green\r\ndrawing-room, which looked very handsome lit up, and was full of people\r\n_all_ in uniform. I subjoin an account of all the arrangements and\r\nall the people. After remaining for about five minutes in that room,\r\ntalking to several people, amongst others to good Lord Melbourne, we\r\nwent in to dinner, which was served in the Gallery, and looked, I must\r\nsay, most brilliant and beautiful. We sat down _103_, and _might_ have\r\nbeen more. The display of plate at one end of the room was really very\r\nhandsome. I sat between Uncle Sussex and Prince Esterhazy. The music\r\nwas in a small Orchestra in the Saloon, and sounded extremely well.\r\nUncle Sussex seemed in very good spirits, and Esterhazy in high force,\r\nand full of fun, and talking so loud. I drank a glass of _stein-wein_\r\nwith Lord Melbourne who sat a good way down on my left between the Duke\r\nof Devonshire and Lord Holland. After dinner we went into the Yellow\r\ndrawing-room. Princesse Schwartzenberg looked very pretty but tired;\r\nand Mme. Zavadowsky beautiful, and so sweet and placid. About 20 m.\r\nafter we ladies came in, the gentlemen joined us. I spoke to almost\r\neverybody; Lord Grey looked well[556]; the Duke of Wellington ill but\r\ncheerful and in good spirits. I spoke for some time also with Lord\r\nMelbourne, who thought the Gallery looked very handsome, and that the\r\nwhole “did very well”; “I don’t see how it could do better,” he said.\r\nHe admired the large diadem I had on. At about 11 came some people who\r\n(as the Gallery was full of dinner &c.) were obliged to come through\r\nthe Closet, and of whom I annex a List. Lady Clanricarde I did not\r\nthink looked very well; Lady Ashley, Lady Fanny, Lady Wilhelmina, and\r\nLady Mary Grimston looked extremely pretty. Strauss played delightfully\r\nthe whole evening in the Saloon. After staying a little while in the\r\nSaloon, we went and sat down in the further drawing-room, next to the\r\ndining-room. I sat on a sofa between Princesse Schwartzenberg and\r\nMme. Stroganoff[557]; Lord Melbourne sitting next Mme. Stroganoff,\r\nand in a little while Esterhazy near him, and Furstenberg (who talked\r\namazingly to Lord Melbourne, and made us laugh a good deal) behind\r\nhim. The Duchess of Sutherland and the Duchess of Northumberland sat\r\nnear Princess Schwartzenberg, and a good many of the other Ambassadors\r\nand Ambassadresses were seated near them. The Duchess of Cambridge and\r\nMamma were opposite to us; and all the others in different parts of the\r\nroom. Several gentlemen, foreigners, came up behind the sofa to speak\r\nto me. We talked and laughed a good deal together. I stayed up till a ¼\r\nto 1. It was a successful evening....\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 1st August._—I asked Lord Melbourne if he saw any likeness\r\nin me to the Duke of Gloucester; he said none whatever; for that when\r\nformerly they wished to make me angry, they always said I was like him.\r\nI asked if Lord Melbourne remembered the Duke’s father; he said he did;\r\nthat he was a very good man, but also very dull and tiresome. His two\r\nbrothers were Edward, Duke of York, who died long before Lord Melbourne\r\nwas born, and Henry, the Duke of Cumberland. “The Duke of Gloucester\r\nand the Duke of Cumberland always remained Whigs,” Lord Melbourne said,\r\n“and never could understand the King’s (George III.) change; they\r\nsaid the Whigs brought their Family to this country; they went with\r\nthe King but could not understand it.” Lord Melbourne said, “Whenever\r\nGeorge IV. took offence at the church, he used to say, ‘By God, my\r\nUncle the Duke of Cumberland was right when he told me, The people you\r\nmust be apprehensive of, are those black-legged gentlemen.’” I said to\r\nLord Melbourne that Princess Sophia Matilda told me that George III.\r\nhad four illnesses. Lord Melbourne said they were not all declared\r\nillnesses. The 1st, he said, was in 1788; the 2nd in 1800, then in\r\n1804, which was not exactly allowed to be so; and the last in ’10, when\r\nhe never got well again; it is said, Lord Melbourne told me, that he\r\nhad been ill in the early part of his reign; as early as 63 or 4, but\r\nno one knows exactly; he had a very bad fever then. I observed that\r\nthe Cheltenham Waters, it was said, brought it on the first time. Lord\r\nMelbourne said, so it was said, but that he did very odd things when\r\nhe first went down there.... He used to give, Lord Melbourne said, all\r\nthe orders before his being ill with perfect composure. Whenever he was\r\ngoing to be ill, the King heard—Lord Melbourne continued—perpetually\r\nringing in his ears, one of Handel’s oratorios; and was constantly\r\nthinking of Octavius[558] who died, “of whom he (the King) said,\r\n‘Heaven will be no Heaven to me if my Octavius isn’t there.’” But his\r\n“master delusion,” as Lord Melbourne expressed it, was thinking that\r\nhe was married to Lady Pembroke (Lady Elizabeth Spencer that was, and\r\nMother to the late Lord Pembroke, and who only died 7 or 8 years ago),\r\nwith whom he had been very much in love in his young days, and very\r\nnear marrying. I told Lord Melbourne I remembered going to see her when\r\nshe was ninety, and she was very handsome even then. Lord Melbourne\r\nthen told me how very near George III. was marrying Lady Sarah\r\nLennox,[559] sister to the late Duke of Richmond, who was excessively\r\nhandsome. Lord Melbourne said he was only prevented from marrying\r\nher “by her levity.” This was quite early in his reign. He told Lady\r\nSusan Strangways, Lord Ilchester’s Aunt, “Don’t you think I ought\r\nto marry a Subject? I think I ought; and that must be your friend”\r\n(meaning Lady Sarah Lennox); “and you may tell her so from me.” “Then,”\r\nLord Melbourne continued, “she” (Lady Sarah) “committed every sort of\r\nfolly; she entered into a flirtation with the Marquis of Lothian, rode\r\nout with him after a masquerade quite early in the morning; this was\r\nrepresented to the King, and _détournée_’d His Majesty a little,” said\r\nLord Melbourne laughing. Nothing could equal the beauty of the Women\r\nat that time, said Lord Melbourne, from all the accounts he heard, the\r\nDuchess of Argyll and Lady Coventry, sisters,[560] &c....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 5th August._—Spoke of Lord Alfred’s[561] having gone to see\r\nhis father’s leg, which is buried at Waterloo, and of _100 old women_\r\nhaving come to see him get into his carriage when they heard whose\r\nson he was. We spoke of all this; of Sir H. Vivian’s suffering much\r\nnow, Lord Melbourne said, in consequence of a severe blow he got at\r\nWaterloo “by a spent grape shot.” Lord Melbourne went over to Brussels\r\nalmost immediately _after_ the battle of Waterloo, to see Sir Frederic\r\nPonsonby[562] who was dreadfully wounded, stabbed through and through;\r\nLord Melbourne said, though he lived for 20 years afterwards, he\r\ncertainly died in consequence of these wounds. I asked Lord Melbourne\r\nif he didn’t think Johnson’s Poetry very hard; he said he did, and that\r\nGarrick said, “Hang it, it’s as hard as Greek.” His Prose he admires,\r\nthough he said pedantry was to be observed throughout it; and Lord\r\nMelbourne thinks what he _said_ superior to what he _wrote_. In spite\r\nof all that pedantry, Lord Melbourne said, “a deep feeling and a great\r\nknowledge of human nature” pervaded all he said and wrote....\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 7th August._—I asked him if he had seen Pozzo, which he told\r\nme in the evening he was going to do; he said he had, and it was about\r\nthe Pasha of Egypt[563]; and he said Russia would go quite with England\r\nin the whole affair and quite approved of England’s intention of\r\nsending a Fleet there; at the same time, Lord Melbourne said, he stated\r\ndistinctly, that if we didn’t send a Fleet, they would be obliged to\r\nmarch an Army into Turkey for its protection; but, Lord Melbourne said\r\nhe hoped, from what he saw by the last despatches, that the Pasha had\r\ngiven up the idea of declaring his Independence. “I think he only tried\r\nit,” Lord Melbourne said, “to see what effect it would make!” Lord\r\nMelbourne said he had also seen Lord Palmerston, and had spoken to him\r\nabout these Belgian Affairs, which they still hope, in spite of many\r\ndifficulties, to settle; and they have now satisfied Sebastiani,[564]\r\nwho, Lord Melbourne said, was of a jealous disposition and thought they\r\nwere going on without him with Bülow[565]; Lord Palmerston had only\r\ngot from Van de Weyer a statement of this Debt,[566] Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid; but that it would be impossible to alter; I expressed a fear of\r\nthe Belgians resisting. Lord Melbourne said (which is quite true) that\r\nit would be very awkward if Uncle Leopold came over just in the midst\r\nof these Conferences, which would have the effect, as if he came for\r\nthat purpose, and which Lord Melbourne said would prevent their acting\r\nas much for his interests as they otherwise might do. I said I quite\r\nfelt it; but that Lord Melbourne had best send for Stockmar and get him\r\nto settle it with the King....\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 12th August._—Saw Stockmar for a little while, and then took\r\nleave of this good and kind friend, which I was really sorry to do. He\r\ntold me he had been to see Lord Melbourne, and he said I should have\r\n(what _I_ have _always_ had) the greatest confidence in Lord Melbourne,\r\nand ask his advice, not only in Political Matters, but in domestic\r\naffairs,—and ask his advice just like a _Father_, which are quite my\r\nfeelings. Lord Melbourne was very funny about the Statue of the Duke of\r\nWellington which is put up (in wood) only as a Trial, on the Archway\r\non Constitution Hill,[567] and which we think looks dreadful and much\r\ntoo large; but Lord Melbourne said he thought a statue would look well\r\nthere, and that it should be as large. We then observed what a pity\r\nWyatt should do the statue, as we thought he did them so ill; and we\r\nmentioned George III.’s; but Lord Melbourne does not dislike that, and\r\nsays it’s exactly like George III., and like his way of bowing.[568] He\r\ncontinued, “I never will have anything to do with Artists; I wished to\r\nkeep out of it all; for they’re a waspish set of people....”\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 14th August._—I went and fetched the Speech, and he read it\r\nto me, in his beautiful, clear manner, and with that fine voice of his,\r\nand full of fine expression. I always feel that _I_ can read it better\r\nwhen I have heard him read it. The Speech is, as Lord Melbourne said,\r\n“not long and safe.”\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 15th August._—Lady Normanby then practised putting on my\r\ncrown, for to-morrow. After this I read my Speech twice over, in my\r\ncrown. Played and sang. Wrote. Wrote my journal. I forgot to say that\r\nI got in the morning, 2 notes from Lord Melbourne in which it seemed\r\nalmost certain that the Prorogation could only take place on Friday;\r\nbut at a little before 2 I got another note from him, in which he\r\nsaid that he heard from Lord John, it could take place next day, and\r\ntherefore, that there would be a Council. I asked Lord Melbourne if it\r\never had been usual for the Sovereign to _read_ the Speech _after_ the\r\nPrime Minister had done so at the Council, as Lord Lansdowne had twice\r\nasked that question. Lord Melbourne said, never; but that the late King\r\nhad done it once, when he was in a great state of irritation, and had\r\nsaid, “I will read it myself, paragraph by paragraph.” This was the\r\nlast time the late King ever prorogued Parliament in person. I asked if\r\nBrougham was in the House; he said no, he was gone. I told him I heard\r\nBrougham had asked Lady Cowper down to Brougham Hall; but that she\r\nwouldn’t go; I asked if she knew him (Brougham) well; Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid very well, and “I’ve known him all my life; he can’t bear me now;\r\nhe won’t speak to me; I’ve tried to speak to him on ordinary subjects\r\nin the House of Lords, but he won’t answer, and looks very stern”; Lord\r\nMelbourne said, laughing, “Why, we’ve had several severe set-to’s,\r\nand I’ve hit him very hard.” I asked if he (B.) didn’t still sit on\r\nthe same bench with Lord Melbourne. “Quite on the gangway; only one\r\nbetween,” replied Lord Melbourne. Lord Melbourne and I both agreed that\r\nit was _since_ the King’s death that Brougham was so enraged with Lord\r\nMelbourne; for, till then, he would have it that it was the _King’s_\r\ndislike to him (and the King made no objection whatever to him, Lord\r\nMelbourne told me) and _not Lord Melbourne_; “he wouldn’t believe me,”\r\nLord M. said; and _now_ he’s undeceived. Brougham always, he said,\r\nused to make a great many speeches. I observed that I thought if his\r\ndaughter was to die, he would go mad; but Lord Melbourne doesn’t think\r\nso; and said, “A man who is always very odd never goes really mad.”\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 16th August._—“You were rather nervous,”[569] said Lord\r\nMelbourne; to which I replied, dreadfully so; “More so than any\r\ntime,” he continued. I asked if it was observed; he said, “I don’t\r\nthink anyone else would have observed it, but I could see you were.”\r\nSpoke of my fear of reading it too low, or too loud, or too quick; “I\r\nthought you read it very well,” he said kindly. I spoke of my great\r\nnervousness, which I said I feared I never would get over. “I won’t\r\nflatter Your Majesty that you ever will; for I think people scarcely\r\never get over it; it belongs to a peculiar temperament, sensitive\r\nand susceptible; that shyness generally accompanies high and right\r\nfeelings,” said Lord Melbourne most kindly; he was so kind and paternal\r\nto me. He spoke of my riding, which he thought a very good thing. “It\r\ngives a feeling of ease the day one has done with Parliament,” said\r\nLord Melbourne. He spoke of the people in the Park when I went to the\r\nHouse; and I said how very civil the people were—_always_—to me; which\r\ntouched him; he said it was a very good thing; it didn’t do to rely too\r\nmuch on those things, but that it was well it was there. I observed to\r\nLord Melbourne how ill and out of spirits the Duke of Sussex was; “I\r\nhave ended the Session in great charity,” said Lord Melbourne, “with\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, but I don’t end it in charity with those who\r\ndidn’t vote with the Duke when he voted with us”; we spoke of all\r\nthat; “The Duke is a very great and able man,” said Lord Melbourne,\r\n“but he is more often wrong than right.” Lord Holland wouldn’t allow\r\nthis; “Well, let’s throw the balance the other way,” continued Lord\r\nMelbourne, “but when he is wrong he is _very_ wrong.”\r\n\r\n_Friday, 17th August._—I then told Lord Melbourne that I had so much\r\nto do, I didn’t think I possibly could go to Windsor on Monday; he\r\nsaid if I put off going once for that reason, I should have to put it\r\noff again, which I wouldn’t allow; I said there were so many things\r\nto go, and to pack,—and so many useless things; “I wouldn’t take those\r\nuseless things,” said Lord Melbourne laughing. I then added that he\r\ncouldn’t have an idea of the number of things women had to pack and\r\ntake; he said many men had quite as much,—which I said couldn’t be,\r\nand he continued that Lord Anglesey had _36_ trunks; and that many men\r\nhad 30 or 40 different waistcoats, and neck-cloths, to choose from;\r\nwhich made me laugh; I said a man _couldn’t_ really want more than\r\n3 or 4 coats for some months. He said in fact 6 were enough for a\r\nyear,—but that people had often fancies for more. I said our dresses\r\nrequired such smooth packing; “Coats ought to be packed smooth,”\r\nreplied Lord Melbourne. I asked Lord Melbourne if Pozzo had spoken at\r\nall about the Belgian affairs. He said he told him he wouldn’t meddle\r\nwith them at all. Spoke of Pozzo’s disliking Lord Palmerston, who\r\ndidn’t, he fancied, treat him with enough _égard_; and Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid Palmerston keeps them waiting sometimes for a long while,—which,\r\nthough they say they don’t mind it, they do mind; and we both agreed\r\nthat he was a little apt to sneer sometimes, and to make it appear\r\nabsurd what people said. I said, independent of Uncle’s coming—hurting\r\nhis interests in the Conferences—his own country was in too disturbed\r\na state to do so[570]; Lord Melbourne said whatever would be done\r\nwould be attributed to Uncle’s presence; that justice must be done to\r\nBelgium; but that there was such a desire in the Cabinet to settle the\r\naffair, that they wouldn’t be disposed to listen to any unreasonable\r\ndemands of Belgium; I said one felt less anxious reading the Speech\r\nat the close than at the beginning of the Session. Lord Melbourne said\r\nhe didn’t know; “The responsibility is so much greater during the\r\nVacations; when Parliament is sitting one comes at once to Parliament;\r\none has that to go to, and hears the worst at once....”\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 19th August._—Spoke of the Phœnix Park being considered\r\nunwholesome; of its being drained by what they call the\r\nSub-soil-plough. He repeated the anecdote about Lord Talbot; the\r\npresent Lord Talbot—(I believe I have already noted down the anecdote\r\nas he told it me twice before, but am not quite sure)—asked someone why\r\nthey had never thought of draining the Phœnix Park, and they replied,\r\n“Why, your Ancestors were so much employed in draining the _Country_,\r\nthat they had no time to think of draining the Park.” He said\r\nTalleyrand told an anecdote of a lady in the time of the Revolution\r\nwho was speaking of what she would be, and she said, “Paysanne, oui;\r\nmais Bourgeoise, jamais.” I said to Lord Melbourne I was afraid he\r\ndisliked the Germans, as he was always laughing at them, which he\r\nwouldn’t allow at all and laughed much. He said, “I’ve a great opinion\r\nof their talents, but not of their beauty.” He asked if I had seen\r\nMr. MacNeill’s[571] despatches giving an account of his going into\r\n_Herat_ at night; I replied, I had not; Lord Melbourne said it was a\r\nvery curious and even fearful account, his going through these Barbaric\r\nArmies at night, 9 o’clock, all the Persians without, prepared for the\r\nAttack, and all those within, for Defence; and he gave an interesting\r\naccount of one of the principal persons in Herat; Mr. MacNeill said\r\nhe found them quite disposed to negotiate, but when he returned to the\r\nShah’s camp, he found the Russian Ambassador there, and the Shah would\r\nlisten to nothing; so Mr. MacNeill came away. Spoke of not liking the\r\nCathedral Service and all that singing, and Lord Melbourne said, “It\r\nis inconsistent with a calm and right devotion; it’s papistical, and\r\ntheatrical.”[572]\r\n\r\n_Monday, 20th August._—Spoke of Pozzo’s being very civil to Lord\r\nMelbourne; Lord Melbourne said, “He’s very fond of me,” upon which I\r\nsaid, “I don’t wonder at that,” which made Lord Melbourne smile. He\r\ncontinued, that Lord Palmerston gave Pozzo rather unnecessary offence\r\nby not treating him with respect and _égard_, which those sensitive\r\nCorsicans and Italians expect. I said to Lord Melbourne, I felt often\r\nashamed at being so ignorant about many things, and at being obliged\r\nto ask him about so many things. He replied MOST KINDLY, “Oh! no,\r\nyou know everything very well; it’s impossible for anybody to know\r\neverything that it is right for them to know.” We spoke of the Archduke\r\nCharles, who, as Mr. Macgregor told Lord Melbourne, “and as we know,”\r\nhe said, was a most able man, but wouldn’t take the slightest part in\r\npublic affairs. We spoke of how many brothers there are still alive:\r\nArchduke Charles, Archduke Palatine, Archduke John, Archduke Rainer,\r\nand Archduke Louis. Spoke of Hayter’s Picture, and of his having\r\nmade the Duchess of Sutherland so like already. Spoke of the Duchess\r\nof Sutherland’s features being large, which he agreed in; but that\r\nhe liked large features, for that people with small features and\r\n“_Squeeny_ noses” never did anything. Spoke of the business of the\r\nArmy, which Lord Melbourne said he was afraid Lord Howick would bring\r\non, and that there would be a good deal of difficulty about it. Lord\r\nHowick, he says, has pledged himself about it, and is displeased with\r\nthe Horse-Guards. He (Lord Howick) is very indiscreet in the House of\r\nCommons, Lord Melbourne said. He has written Lord Melbourne a letter\r\nabout this Army business, which Lord Melbourne told him he would\r\nanswer; but he begged Lord Melbourne not to write to him, as long as he\r\nwas at Spa,—as the letter would be read. I said I hoped Lord Melbourne\r\nhad never found me indiscreet, or that I had ever repeated things which\r\nI ought not to have done. He said, “Not at all; no one is so discreet,”\r\nand that it was impossible sometimes to help letting out things. I\r\nthen also begged him always to tell me, when he heard anything, might\r\nit be agreeable or disagreeable, and that he should never be afraid of\r\ntelling me so; which he promised to do.[573]\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 21st August._—Lord Melbourne said he had seen Lord\r\nPalmerston, who told him he hoped to be able soon to bring this Belgian\r\nbusiness[574] to a sort of conclusion; that he had had several\r\nconversations with Bülow, and Senfft,[575] “who seems a very fair\r\nman”; and that they think they may settle this Debt, and satisfy the\r\nBelgians by this slight change. “Then I talked to him,” continued Lord\r\nMelbourne, “about the King’s coming, and that it would be more for the\r\ndisadvantage of his Interests.” I then spoke of my having received such\r\nan odd present of a Kitten in the morning, which made him laugh. (I\r\ngot a basket, which they said came from Sir Henry Wheatley, and which\r\nI thought was full of flowers, and when my Maid opened it, we found\r\na pretty little _Kitten_ in it—which some poor people sent me as a\r\npresent.)\r\n\r\n_Monday, 27th August._—Of Uncle Leopold; when he married Princess\r\nCharlotte; Lord Melbourne hadn’t the slightest acquaintance with her,\r\nand never had spoken to her. She never came to her father at that time.\r\nLord M. said he never went near the Princess of Wales, for he said\r\nconsidering that he opposed the Regent so much in Parliament, he didn’t\r\nwish to oppose him in his quarrels with his Wife; for, he said, he had\r\nbeen so much with the Prince of Wales, and was so much attached to him,\r\nthat he thought that would have been wrong.\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, 28th August._—Lord Melbourne then read me a letter from Lord\r\nJohn about all this Belgian business; he says that he won’t support\r\nBelgium in its new claims. Lord Melbourne said, “It’s very well of\r\nJohn saying he won’t support,” and so forth, but that it would be\r\nimpossible for us not to take one side; our interests would compel\r\nus to do so; they lay so much with the Low Countries; England, he\r\nsaid, could never permit France to have possession of Antwerp, which\r\nwas such a great Maritime place. He then read me a letter from Lord\r\nMinto relative to an alarm which prevails, and which was caused,\r\nLord Melbourne says, by a speech the Duke of Wellington made in the\r\nHouse, about the weakness of our Naval force; which Lord Minto quite\r\ndisclaims. Lord Melbourne sent him a paper of Sir Robert Inglis’s[576]\r\nabout the Russian, French, and American Fleets; which Lord Minto says\r\nis quite erroneous; Lord Minto states that in a very few weeks, he\r\ncould be quite ready for war; Lord M. says, what countries generally\r\nruin themselves with, is, keeping up their Naval and Military\r\nEstablishments during the time of peace; and he said, “Better be at\r\nWar then.”[577] He owned that the Russians sending their fleet to\r\nthe Black Sea “certainly is far from pleasant.” Then I spoke of Lord\r\nPonsonby’s great alarm about Russian Influence, which Lord Melbourne\r\nsaid always was the case. Spoke of Queen Charlotte’s having been\r\nsupposed to have had a great many presents which she was fond of, from\r\nMrs. Hastings[578]; and Lord Melbourne said the King was thought rather\r\nto go with Hastings, who was accused and tried for misdemeanours in\r\nIndia. There was an ivory bed-stead Queen Charlotte got, which Lord\r\nM. believed was at Frogmore now. Spoke of Queen Adelaide’s having got\r\nall those Shawls which the King of Oude sent. This led us to speak\r\nof the Crown Jewels; of there not being many, yet more than I ever\r\nwished to wear, of my not liking those sort of things. Lord M. said\r\nhe didn’t like a profusion of them, but thought a few fine ones the\r\nbest. Spoke of the Jewels which Queen Charlotte left to her daughters.\r\nLord Melbourne said the Queen Consort can do with her _own_ things\r\nwhat she pleases; can make her own Will, and “is a _femme seule_,” for\r\nno other woman can—all is her husband’s. Lord Melbourne (in reply to\r\nmy question when he first knew George IV.) said, as soon as he could\r\nremember any one; he was 4 when the King was 21, in ’83, when Lord\r\nMelbourne’s father was first put about the Prince of Wales. “He used to\r\nbe at Whitehall, or Piccadilly[579] where we then lived, morning, noon\r\nand night,” Lord Melbourne said; and he used to come down to Brocket;\r\nhe always was fond of children and took notice of them; I said he\r\ntook notice of me; I observed how much more submissive we were to him\r\nthan to the late King; Lord Melbourne said George IV. had more power.\r\nLord Melbourne said _none_ of the Royal Family could marry without\r\nthe Sovereign’s leave since the Marriage Act, passed early in George\r\nIII.’s reign, in consequence, Lord Melbourne believes, of the Duke\r\nof Cumberland’s marrying a Mrs. Luttrell[580] which was very much\r\ndisliked; else the Duke of Sussex might have married Lady Augusta, and\r\nthe late King Mrs. Jordan, Lord Melbourne said. The member of the Royal\r\nFamily, Lord Melbourne continued, gives notice to the Privy Council of\r\nhis intention to marry, and if they don’t disapprove, it’s supposed\r\nthe King will consent. Lord Melbourne said it was a difficult subject\r\nthe marriage of the Royal Family; marrying a subject was inconvenient,\r\nand there was inconvenience in foreigners; “It was very often done”\r\n(marrying subjects); “Kings did it; and I don’t know there was any\r\nharm in it,” said Lord Melbourne. Anne Hyde was the last who married\r\na Prince who became _King_, and that was considered a dreadful thing.\r\nLord M. said he had been looking at some of those letters [George\r\nIII.’s] to Lord North which seemed to him very ill written,[581] both\r\nas to hand and style, and in bad English. Lord North was a great\r\nfavourite of George IV.’s, Lord Melbourne said; “Lord North was a very\r\neasy, good-natured man,” and the King knew him “when he first came in\r\nto life.” Lord Thurlow, whom Mr. Pitt beat and turned out in ’93,[582]\r\nturned to George IV. and became also a great favourite of his. He was\r\nclever but ill-tempered, Lord Melbourne said.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, 29th August._—Lord Melbourne said he had been looking at\r\nthose letters to Lord North, and found on closer examination that\r\nthey were written with much more practical knowledge and knowledge of\r\nmen than he had at first thought. The letters he has been reading\r\nare relative to a Negotiation which the King entered into, with the\r\nOpposition, in order to strengthen the Government; and Lord Melbourne\r\nrelated several parts of it, which made him smile and which he said\r\nwere true enough. Lord Melbourne said he (George III.) couldn’t bear\r\nMr. Fox, for that he says in one of these letters that he (Lord North)\r\nmight offer him any situation which did not bring him in immediate\r\ncontact with the King, or into the Closet; and as he (Mr. Fox) never\r\nhad any principles, he wouldn’t have any difficulty in changing. These\r\nletters prove, Lord Melbourne said, what strong personal dislikes the\r\nKing had. These letters to Lord North, Lord M. thinks, were returned\r\nto George IV. by Mrs. Douglas on the death of her husband, who was\r\nthe son of Lady Glenbervie, Lord North’s daughter; Lord North had\r\nthree daughters, Lady Glenbervie, Lady Sheffield, and Lady Charlotte\r\nLindsay (whom I know); all very clever, Lord M. says. He had 3 sons,\r\nGeorge (who was a very pleasant, lively man and a great bon-vivant,\r\nLord M. says), Frederic, and Frank; who were all in succession Earls\r\nof Guilford. The present Lord is son to Lord North’s brother[583] who\r\nwas a Bishop, Lord M. told me. Lord North died in ’93, and Lord M.\r\nremembers seeing him (when Lord M. was a boy) led into the House of\r\nLords, quite blind, at Hastings’ trial; he was Lord Guilford for a very\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nLord M. does not think that George III. was very fond of Mr. Pitt.\r\nSpoke of the violent dislikes George III. and George IV. had; William\r\nIV. had them also, but Lord M. said they were easily got over.\r\nSpoke of George III.’s hand-writing; of mine, which Lord M. thinks\r\nvery legible and generally very good; of my inclination to imitate\r\nhand-writings, and people,—which Lord M. said, showed quickness, and\r\nwas in the Family; of George IV.’s mimickry. I said I kept a journal,\r\nwhich, as Lord Melbourne said, is very laborious, but a very good\r\nthing; for that it was astonishing in transacting business, how much\r\none forgot, and how one forgot _why_ one did the things.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, 30th August._— ... I gave Lord M. this Pamphlet of Sir H.\r\nTaylor’s which Mamma lent me. We talked about many things, and in going\r\nhome I asked Lord M. how long Lord North had been Prime Minister to\r\nGeorge III.; “From ’70 till ’82,” he told me. “The Duke of Grafton”\r\n(who preceded him, and was the present Duke of Grafton’s father) “went\r\naway,” Lord M. continued, “without telling any body and without telling\r\nthe King; they were difficult times, and he went away; I know why he\r\nwent away, people are always doing those foolish things; and the King\r\ndidn’t know what to do; he sent for Lord Gower”[584] (I forget what\r\nhe was), who, I think Lord M. said, refused it; “and then he sent for\r\nhis Chancellor of the Exchequer” (Lord North) “and made him his Prime\r\nMinister.” Lord M. spoke of Dr. Keate, and told me an anecdote of him\r\nand George III.; and then he said that Dr. Keate couldn’t bear to be\r\nreminded of his boyish days at Eton; somebody, who Lord M. knows,\r\nreminded Keate when he was walking across the School-Yard with him,\r\nof the window, pointing at it, out of which they had often jumped,\r\nupon which Dr. Keate said, “Don’t mention it; it’s a very foolish\r\nremark.”\r\n\r\n_Friday, 31st August._—Lord M. then said, that the French were going\r\nto send out a fleet to Mexico, with which State they have been in\r\na quarrel for some time,—and that they meant to send the Prince de\r\nJoinville with it, to ask for reparation, and if not, to attack the\r\nfort of Aloa which commands the river, and which it would not be\r\nagreeable for us if the French were to possess; and Lord Palmerston\r\nproposes we should send a swift sailing Vessel to Mexico to apprize\r\nthe Mexicans of what was to take place and to advise them to make\r\nreparation. And also, Lord P. proposes sending a Vessel to Guiana,\r\nwhere the French are making great encroachments, and to see what they\r\nare about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _H.R.H. The Duc de Nemours_\r\n\r\n  _from a portrait by Eugene Lami_]\r\n\r\nLady Cork[585] is 92, a very strange old woman; Lord M. knows her; she\r\nwas clever, a great favourite of George III. and Queen Charlotte. She\r\nwas a Miss Monckton, sister to Lord Galway, he said. Lord M. said in\r\nreturning Dr. Hook’s sermon (which I sent him to read) when he came in,\r\nthat it was eager, but nothing very particular, and able. Lady Holland\r\nseems “very fond of Senfft,” Lord M. observed; “she would settle that\r\nEmbassy too, as she does every thing else,” he said laughing. Lord M.\r\nsaid, in speaking of Taylor’s pamphlet,[586] “There is no force in it;\r\nit isn’t pointed.” Taylor is very fond of writing, he says, and fancies\r\nhe writes well. Spoke of Lady C. Bury’s book.[587] Lord M. says these\r\nthings make less impression than people fancy; they “make a day’s\r\nnoise; but nobody minds them much.” Spoke of Lady Anne Hamilton,[588]\r\nwho attended Queen Caroline at her Trial; Lady Charlotte Lindsay\r\ngave evidence. “Lord Egremont said,” continued Lord M., “‘As for\r\nGuilford,[589] he twaddled like a waiting maid when he gave evidence;\r\nbut his Sister lied like a man,’” which made us both laugh very much.\r\nSpoke of Kenney,[590] who is Author (Lord M. told me) of _Love, Law,\r\nand Physic_, and _Raising the Wind_, and is at Holland House. Spoke of\r\nmy knowing Rogers and Moore; having seen Scott and Southey. Lord M.\r\nrather admires Southey’s works, and thinks his _Life of Nelson_ very\r\npretty. Spoke of his _Life of Cowper_. Spoke of a new book lying on the\r\ntable, sent to me by Granville Penn,[591] which Lord M. looked at and\r\nsaid he thought might be curious; it is the _Life of Sir William Penn_,\r\nAdmiral in Cromwell’s time, and who, with Venables, took Jamaica. Spoke\r\nof Mrs. Hutchinson’s _Memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson_, which Lord M.\r\nthinks very curious; spoke of her violence; spoke of Clarendon’s book\r\nwhich Lord M. said “is a fine book.” I observed there were few books\r\non the Parliamentary side; he replied few at the time, but a good\r\nmany since. He mentioned one by Brodie, a Scotchman; Bishop Burnet’s\r\nMemoirs of his own time, during Charles II.’s reign; and he said,\r\n“There is a book which I think would amuse Your Majesty, and would be\r\nof use to you, and which isn’t long, which is Guizot’s account of the\r\nRevolution.” It’s only in 2 vols., and is a summary of whole thing, he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nLord M. said Lady Holland was a great friend of Pozzo’s, and that his\r\nfirst acquaintance with Pozzo was at Holland House. I asked if she\r\nknew Sebastiani; he said she did, but didn’t like him much, except\r\nfrom his connection with Napoleon “whom she adored.” She never knew\r\nNapoleon, Lord Melbourne added, but saw him at Paris at the Peace of\r\nAmiens. She used to send him things she knew he liked, said Lord M.;\r\nwhen he was at St. Helena she sent him _gâteaux_ and chocolate, &c.\r\n“She was half on his side,” Lord M. continued, “if not more.” Spoke of\r\nLady E. Wortley’s[592] admiration for Napoleon. Soult was no friend of\r\nNapoleon, Lord M. said; none of them, he continued, were to be compared\r\nto Napoleon himself; the two best after Napoleon, Lord M. said, were\r\nDessaix who was killed at Marengo, and Kleber who was murdered in Egypt.\r\n\r\nI asked Lord M. what Lord Gower, whom he mentioned to me before, was;\r\nthat Lord Gower, he said, was the Duke of Sutherland’s grandfather; he\r\nwas “Lord Privy Seal” when the King sent for him.[593] “He did not\r\nthink himself equal to it” (being Prime Minister); “he was a man who\r\ntook great part in politics.” Lord M. also told me that he believes\r\nthe present Lord Bute to be the great-grandson of the Minister of\r\nGeorge III. “George III. found the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Pitt, and\r\neverything was going on very well, when he was advised to change; he\r\ncouldn’t bear Mr. Pitt; who was afterwards Lord Chatham; and he took\r\nLord Bute in his place; and then followed all that unpopularity.” I\r\nasked if these letters of George III. showed great confidence in Lord\r\nNorth; Lord M. said “they show a great liking for him, more than a\r\ngreat confidence.” That the King never seemed to think him strong\r\nenough; Lord North, all along, Lord M. continued, was pursuing a\r\nPolicy contrary to what he himself approved, but which he was urged\r\nto by the King: and Lord North remonstrated very much with the King.\r\nThe difference, Lord M. observed before, between George IV. and his\r\nfather, was, that the former (which Knighton’s Memoirs show, Lord M.\r\nsaid) always required somebody to lean upon, whereas the latter always\r\nwished to act for himself, and only yielded, but said at the same time\r\nhe disliked doing it. He never would have yielded on the Catholic\r\nQuestion, Lord M. continued, nor would the Duke of York; the late King\r\nwas for it; but George IV. did it very unwillingly. George III. was\r\ndeeply hurt at the loss of the American provinces, which I observed\r\nwas no wonder; I said I thought it was _his_ fault. Lord M. said most\r\nlikely it was; but that it was impossible any longer to keep up the\r\ngreat Colonial Policy, namely that they should exclusively trade with\r\nEngland and make nothing for themselves; even Lord Chatham, Lord M.\r\nsaid, who all along advocated their cause, “said they shouldn’t drive\r\none hob-nail for themselves.” The Separation was easily done, they\r\nhad nothing to do but to declare it. Lord M. continued that the first\r\nsettlers were composed of people who left England in discontent,—of\r\ndissenters &c., and consequently no loyal people could spring from\r\nthem. Spoke of the people whom William III. ennobled, which I’ve no\r\ntime to enumerate. He told a most absurd anecdote of a very fat little\r\nporter at Lansdowne House. “He is a leading man in all the Parish\r\nDebates,” said Lord M.; “and somebody told Albemarle, ‘He speaks very\r\nwell; to tell you the truth he speaks very like my lord.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             END OF VOL.

She died 1880.\r\n\r\n[265] Colonel Sibthorp, the eccentric member for Lincoln, whose\r\npersonal appearance was much satirised in _Punch_.\r\n\r\n[266] Afterwards Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton and Lord Lytton of Knebworth.\r\nHe was distinguished as a writer of novels that enjoyed a great vogue,\r\nand as a genuine man of letters. His abilities were of a far higher\r\norder than his writing. His ability was his own, but he wrote for the\r\npublic. He earned a considerable fortune by his pen. For a time he\r\nchose to be a politician, and was Secretary for the Colonies in Lord\r\nDerby’s Government. His marriage was famous for its failure. His son\r\nRobert was Viceroy of India, Ambassador in Paris, and a poet of more\r\nthan average merit.\r\n\r\n[267] Grandson of the twelfth Duke of Norfolk who died in 1842. He\r\nsucceeded as fourteenth Duke and died in 1860.\r\n\r\n[268] Son of Prince Paul Esterhazy, Austrian Ambassador. See p. 77.\r\n\r\n[269] Charles (1815–88), afterwards sixth Duke of Rutland, K.G.; he\r\ndied unmarried. A man of grim manners but not unkindly heart.\r\n\r\n[270] Arthur Richard (1807–84), afterwards second Duke of Wellington,\r\nK.G. Almost better known by his courtesy title of Lord Douro. Had he\r\nnot been the son of the Great Duke, his uncommon talents might have\r\nearned for him a career of distinction. In appearance he singularly\r\nresembled his august father, and late in life he was addicted to a\r\nstyle of costume which led people to say that he wore his father’s old\r\nclothes. He, however, possessed a pretty wit.\r\n\r\n[271] John William (1811–84), seventh Earl of Sandwich, afterwards\r\nMaster of the Buckhounds.\r\n\r\n[272] Thomas Henry, fourth Lord Foley (1808–69).\r\n\r\n[273] Louisa, a daughter of the sixth Duke of Bedford, married James,\r\nsecond Marquess and first Duke of Abercorn. This Duke and his Duchess\r\nare generally thought to have been meant by the “Duke” and “Duchess” in\r\nLord Beaconsfield’s novel _Lothair_.\r\n\r\n[274] The three remarkable Sheridan sisters (granddaughters of R. B.\r\nSheridan, the dramatist) were Lady Seymour (afterwards Duchess of\r\nSomerset and Queen of Beauty at the Eglinton Tournament), Lady Dufferin\r\n(the Mrs. Blackwood mentioned above), and Mrs. Norton. They possessed\r\nin an uncommon degree the gift of beauty inherited from Miss Linley,\r\ntheir grandmother, and gifts of mind inherited from Sheridan. Not\r\nonly Mrs. Norton, but also Lady Dufferin, wrote verse and prose with\r\ndistinction. _Stuart of Dunleath_, a novel by Mrs. Norton, was much and\r\njustly admired. She inspired George Meredith with the conception of\r\n_Diana of the Crossways_.\r\n\r\n[275] Baron Stockmar. See p. 196.\r\n\r\n[276] Dr. Howley. See _ante_, p. 68.\r\n\r\n[277] Second Marquess. See _ante_, p. 98.\r\n\r\n[278] Baron Christian Stockmar (1787–1863), physician to Prince\r\nLeopold, and subsequently his confidential agent. He abandoned medicine\r\nfor statecraft, in which he became an expert. He was entrusted by King\r\nLeopold to superintend the education of Prince Albert and guide Queen\r\nVictoria, both of which services he performed with consummate tact and\r\nintegrity. He was their devoted friend and counsellor to the end of his\r\nlife. See _ante_, p. 154.\r\n\r\n[279] William Lamb, Viscount Melbourne (1779–1848), was at this time\r\nPrime Minister and fifty-eight years old.\r\n\r\n[280] Ernest Augustus (1771–1851), fifth son of George III. He was\r\nconsidered unscrupulous, and was certainly most unpopular in this\r\ncountry. He now succeeded William IV. as King of Hanover. Although\r\nof autocratic temperament, he granted his subjects a democratic\r\nconstitution, much to their surprise.\r\n\r\n[281] Augustus Frederick (1773–1843), sixth son of George III. His\r\nmarriage to Lady Augusta Murray was declared void under the Royal\r\nMarriages Act. He had by her two children, Sir Augustus d’Este and\r\nMlle. d’Este (afterwards wife of Lord Chancellor Truro). He married,\r\nsecondly, Lady Cecilia Buggin (_née_ Gore, daughter of the Earl of\r\nArran), and to her was granted the title of Duchess of Inverness.\r\n\r\n[282] Henry William Paget, first Marquess of Anglesey (1768–1854).\r\nCommanded the Cavalry at Waterloo. When a round shot tore between\r\nhim and the Duke of Wellington, he turned to the Duke and said, “By\r\nGod! I have lost my leg,” and the Duke replied, “By God! I believe\r\nyou have.” This conversation sums up the two men. Lord Anglesey was a\r\nField-Marshal and Viceroy of Ireland, where he displayed a tendency\r\nto liberal ideas that were not considered in accordance with his\r\nprofession or station. There was never a more gallant soldier, and he\r\n“had not a fold in his character.”\r\n\r\n[283] Chancellor of the Exchequer. An intelligent politician and\r\nresponsible for the adoption of the penny post. He was anxious for the\r\nSpeakership, but failed to win the fancy of the House of Commons. He\r\npassed to the House of Lords as Lord Monteagle in 1839 and died in 1866.\r\n\r\n[284] James, first Lord Wharncliffe. A Yorkshire magnate and Member of\r\nParliament. Created a Peer 1826. See _ante_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n[285] Alexander Baring, first Lord Ashburton (1774–1848). President of\r\nthe Board of Trade in Lord Grey’s Administration.\r\n\r\n[286] Sir William Draper Best (1767–1845), first Lord Wynford, formerly\r\nChief Justice of the Common Pleas.\r\n\r\n[287] A distinguished soldier, at this time Lieut.-General and Master\r\nof the Ordnance. M.P. for Windsor. Afterwards created Lord Vivian\r\n(1841).\r\n\r\n[288] Charles Grant, first and only Lord Glenelg (1778–1866), at\r\nthis time Secretary for the Colonies. Three years before he had been\r\nproposed as Governor-General of India, but his nomination was rejected\r\nby the Board of Directors.\r\n\r\n[289] Afterwards Lord Sydenham (1799–1841). At this time President\r\nof the Board of Trade. In 1839 he was appointed Governor-General of\r\nCanada. He died there, aged forty-one, from a fall from his horse.\r\n\r\n[290] Henry George, afterwards third Earl Grey (1802–94), at this\r\ntime Secretary-at-War and Colonial Secretary. An honest and fearless\r\nstatesman, but a difficult colleague.\r\n\r\n[291] Gilbert, second Earl of Minto (1782–1859), First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty. In 1832 he had been sent on a special mission to Berlin “to\r\nmollify the King of Prussia.” This type of mission has always been\r\npopular with the Whigs.\r\n\r\n[292] Daughter of George III. She lived at Frogmore and at Clarence\r\nHouse. See _ante_, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[293] Robert Cutlar Ferguson had been counsel for one of the defendants\r\nin the trial of Arthur O’Connor and others for treason at Maidstone\r\nin 1798. O’Connor was acquitted, but the presence in Court of Bow\r\nStreet runners to arrest him on a second charge caused a scene of\r\nmuch confusion, one consequence being the prosecution of Cutlar\r\nFerguson, Lord Thanet, and others for an attempted rescue. Ferguson was\r\nimprisoned for a year and fined £100. Upon his liberation he went to\r\nCalcutta, where he established himself in large and lucrative practice.\r\nHe died in 1838.\r\n\r\n[294] Lord John Russell (1792–1878) was at this time forty-five years\r\nold. Home Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons. He was at the\r\nheight of his combative powers as a Parliamentarian, and his zeal for\r\nWhig doctrine at home and Liberal statesmanship abroad was undiminished.\r\n\r\n[295] Private Secretary to William IV.\r\n\r\n[296] Lady C. Jenkinson, daughter of the Earl of Liverpool. See p. 46.\r\n\r\n[297] Anna Maria, daughter of the third Earl of Harrington.\r\n\r\n[298] Louisa Fox-Strangways, daughter of the second Earl of Ilchester.\r\n\r\n[299] He had been executor to the Queen’s father. One of her first acts\r\nwas to discharge the debts contracted by the Duke of Kent, which the\r\nDuchess had never been able to pay off. See _ante_, p. 69.\r\n\r\n[300] Colonel the Hon. H. F. C. Cavendish (1789–1873), son of Lord\r\nBurlington. Clerk-Marshal to the Queen. Married as his second wife\r\nFrances Susan, sister of Lord Durham.\r\n\r\n[301] Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager, a Princess of the House of\r\nSaxe-Meiningen. Her attitude towards the young Queen was absolutely\r\nperfect, in its simple dignity and freedom from every taint of envy.\r\n\r\n[302] Georgina Howard, daughter of the sixth Earl of Carlisle.\r\n\r\n[303] Anne, wife of Francis William, second Earl of Charlemont.\r\n\r\n[304] Second son of the fourth Duke of Grafton.\r\n\r\n[305] George Byng, afterwards second Earl of Strafford.\r\n\r\n[306] Lord Durham, by his charming manners, had overcome certain\r\nprejudice which had been felt in St. Petersburg on his appointment. He\r\nwas exceedingly popular with the Emperor. He returned to England, it\r\nwas said, “a greater aristocrat than ever.” See _ante_, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[307] Lord Mulgrave was created Marquess of Normanby in 1838. A member\r\nof Lord Melbourne’s Administration in 1834, he was sent to Ireland\r\nas Viceroy, and then returned to the Cabinet as Secretary of State.\r\nWhile the Whigs were in office he was never without a place. He was\r\nsubsequently Ambassador in Paris, and under Lord Palmerston supported\r\nNapoleon III. through the stormy days of the _coup d’état_.\r\n\r\n[308] Lady Mulgrave was Maria Liddell, eldest daughter of the first\r\nLord Ravensworth. She had married, in 1818, the second Earl of\r\nMulgrave, who was created Marquess of Normanby in 1838. See p. 205.\r\n\r\n[309] Sarah, daughter of the second Earl Spencer and widow of the third\r\nLord Lyttelton. Afterwards Lady Superintendent to the Princess Royal\r\nand the Prince of Wales and the other Princes and Princesses. A shrewd\r\nobserver and a woman of fine judgment and high ideals.\r\n\r\n[310] There is no record of any previous Sovereign wearing the robes\r\nof the Bath on such an occasion. Certainly they have never been worn\r\nsince. A little later in her reign the Queen was always reluctant to\r\nexchange the red ribbon of the Bath for the blue ribbon of the Garter.\r\nBy the advice of Lord Melbourne, however, she was in the habit of\r\nwearing the red ribbon when holding an investiture of the Order.\r\n\r\n[311] He had just been created Earl of Yarborough. Lady Charlotte was\r\nthe wife of Sir Joseph Copley. He died in 1846.\r\n\r\n[312] The Queen always retained a strong sentiment for Kensington\r\nPalace. Part of the old building had been condemned by the Office of\r\nWorks to be pulled down, but the Queen refused her sanction. During\r\nthe last year of her reign the Queen made an arrangement with Lord\r\nSalisbury and Sir M. Hicks-Beach that, in consideration of Her Majesty\r\ngiving up the use of Bushey House and the Ranger’s House at Greenwich,\r\nthe Government should purchase and place at her disposal Schomberg\r\nHouse, and should restore Kensington Palace. Parliament voted £36,000\r\nfor this purpose, on the understanding that the State Rooms should be\r\nopened to the public.\r\n\r\n[313] Louisa, daughter of the thirteenth Viscount Dillon, afterwards\r\nwife of Sir Spencer Ponsonby Fane.\r\n\r\n[314] These are the rooms now occupied by Queen Mary. The “audience”\r\nroom opened out of the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n[315] Hon. Harriet Elizabeth Pitt, younger daughter of the third Lord\r\nRivers. She married in 1841 Charles Dashwood Bruce, nephew of the Earl\r\nof Elgin.\r\n\r\n[316] Mary Alicia Spring Rice, eldest daughter of the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. She afterwards married James Garth Marshall of Headingley\r\nand Monk Coniston.\r\n\r\n[317] President of the Board of Control. He had enjoyed the friendship\r\nof Byron, travelled with him, and was one of his executors. He was\r\ncreated Lord Broughton in 1851. His _Recollections of a Long Life_,\r\nedited by his daughter, Lady Dorchester, throw much light on the\r\npolitical events of his time. He was so strong a partisan that his\r\njudgments of statesmen and political events have to be treated\r\nwith reservations; but he was a type of politician, cultivated,\r\nindependent, conscientious, and high-minded, that is becoming rarer as\r\nconstituencies become less fastidious.\r\n\r\n[318] The Queen invariably saw her Ministers in an “audience” room and\r\nnever in her private sitting-room. An exception was made in the case of\r\nLord Melbourne, the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n[319] See _ante_, p. 53.\r\n\r\n[320] George William, sixth Duke of Argyll, son of John fifth Duke, and\r\nhis wife, one of the beautiful Gunning sisters, Elizabeth, widow of the\r\nsixth Duke of Hamilton. This lady was created Baroness Hamilton in her\r\nown right, and her husband was also accorded a barony of Great Britain,\r\nthus entitling him to a seat in Parliament.\r\n\r\n[321] Fourth son of the fourth Duke of Marlborough; a Captain, R.N.\r\nDied at Macao in 1840.\r\n\r\n[322] Sigismund Thalberg (1812–71) was now in the full flood of\r\nsuccess. He wrote many fantasias on operatic themes, _e.g._ on _Robert\r\nle Diable_, _Zampa_, etc. In 1845 he married a widow, the daughter of\r\nLablache. As a composer he never succeeded in emulating his success as\r\na pianist. Later in life he abandoned music, and became a professional\r\nvine-grower.\r\n\r\n[323] Edward Pery Buckley, afterwards General and M.P. See p. 327.\r\n\r\n[324] Alexis, Count Orloff, famous both as general and diplomatist. He\r\nhad fought in the war of 1829 against Turkey, and signed the Treaty\r\nof Adrianople in 1829. He had been sent to enlist English sympathies\r\nfor Holland as against Belgium in 1832. He also was a signatory of the\r\nimportant treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, and represented Russia in the\r\nCongress of Paris in 1856.\r\n\r\n[325] Lady Salisbury was Frances Mary, daughter and heir of Bamber\r\nGascoyne, grandson of Sir Crisp Gascoyne, Lord Mayor of London 1752. He\r\nwas the first Lord Mayor who occupied the Mansion House.\r\n\r\n[326] Afterwards an intimate counsellor of the Emperor of Austria,\r\nHereditary Great Chamberlain, and President of the Council.\r\n\r\n[327] See _ante_, p. 192: note on the Sheridan sisters.\r\n\r\n[328] Wife of Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, younger brother of\r\nGrand Duke Charles Frederick. See p. 125.\r\n\r\n[329] At Marlborough House.\r\n\r\n[330] Caroline Fanny, daughter of Colonel Cavendish. Maid-of-honour,\r\nand Extra Woman of the Bedchamber.\r\n\r\n[331] Caroline Margaret, Maid-of-honour, eldest daughter of John,\r\nafterwards second Earl Somers. She subsequently married Canon\r\nCourtenay, one of the Queen’s chaplains.\r\n\r\n[332] Princess Cecile of Sweden, third wife of Grand Duke Augustus of\r\nOldenbourg.\r\n\r\n[333] See _ante_, p. 69.\r\n\r\n[334] See _ante_, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[335] King William I., who succeeded his father, Frederic, in 1816.\r\n\r\n[336] George, seventh Viscount, a Lord-in-waiting.\r\n\r\n[337] Wife of M. de Mérode, who was First Minister in Belgium and a\r\nfaithful friend to King Leopold.\r\n\r\n[338] Lord Broughton (Sir John Hobhouse), in his Reminiscences, refers\r\nto this game of chess, and to the slight confusion there was between\r\n“the two Queens on the board and the two Queens at the table.”\r\n\r\n[339] Sir Jeffrey Wyatt (1766–1840), the architect, whose most\r\nimportant work was the transformation of Windsor Castle, including the\r\naddition of thirty feet to the height of the Round Tower. The principal\r\nfeature of this work is the solid and “fortress-like” appearance, which\r\nis conspicuous in the Castle. His name had been originally Wyatt,\r\nbut George IV., after laying the foundation-stone of the new work,\r\nsanctioned the curious addition of “ville” to the surname. Although\r\nhe was an architect of considerable technical skill, his powers of\r\ndestructiveness were quite remarkable. He hardly left a stone of\r\nWindsor Castle unturned.\r\n\r\n[340] Equerry to the Queen, son of the first Marquess of Anglesey by\r\nhis second marriage with Lady Charlotte Cadogan. Sometime M.P. for\r\nLichfield and Clerk-Marshal of the Royal Household. Lord Broughton\r\ndescribed him as “a handsome Calmuck-looking young fellow.”\r\n\r\n[341] Prince Aloysius Joseph de Lichtenstein succeeded his father, Jean\r\nJoseph, in 1836.\r\n\r\n[342] George Villiers (1800–70), British Plenipotentiary at Madrid. In\r\n1838 he became fourth Earl of Clarendon, was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\r\nin critical times, 1847–52, and afterwards, with great distinction,\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1853, again in 1865 and\r\nin 1868. He was not a statesman of very original mind, or of great\r\ninitiative, but he was honest and prudent and highly regardful of his\r\ncountry’s interests. His manners were delightful and his conversation\r\nvaried with anecdotes and punctuated by wit. He was one of the\r\nprincipal attractions in London society during the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[343] This picture hangs in the Corridor at Windsor Castle. The\r\nlikenesses are excellent, but the artist has painted the Queen in a\r\nwhite dress, whereas she wore black. The actual dress worn by the Queen\r\nis now exhibited in the London Museum at Kensington.\r\n\r\n[344] Matilda Susannah, daughter of Hon. Berkeley Paget, fifth son of\r\nthe first Earl of Uxbridge. She was a Maid of Honour to the Queen, and\r\ndied in 1871.\r\n\r\n[345] Princess Marie of Orleans, daughter of King Louis Philippe. See\r\n_ante_, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[346] These rooms, partly remodelled and redecorated, are now occupied\r\nby Queen Mary. Up to the death of Queen Victoria no material change\r\nwas made in them. In 1901 they were much altered, although the main\r\nfeatures remain as before.\r\n\r\n[347] Sir Moses Montefiore (1784–1885), created a baronet in 1846.\r\nHis life, prolonged for over a hundred years, was one of flawless\r\ngenerosity and personal kindness to the poor and afflicted of his own\r\nrace, especially in the eastern provinces of Russia and in Turkey.\r\nHe obtained consideration for poor Jews from the Russian and Turkish\r\nGovernments, and his seven pilgrimages to Jerusalem were all undertaken\r\nwith a view to improving the questionable lot of the Chosen People.\r\n\r\n[348] Princess Augusta of Cambridge. See Vol. II., p. 150.\r\n\r\n[349] Princess Mary, afterwards Duchess of Teck.\r\n\r\n[350] Henry, fourth Duke. He had been so strenuous an opponent of the\r\nReform Bill, that, after its rejection, a mob set fire to Nottingham\r\nCastle, his property. Mr. Gladstone was M.P. for Newark owing to the\r\nDuke’s influence, which was withdrawn in 1845 when Mr. Gladstone\r\nsupported Peel on the Corn Laws.\r\n\r\n[351] Robert Edward, second son of the second Earl of Kingston, born\r\n1773. He was a Lieut.-General and was created Viscount Lorton in the\r\nIrish peerage in 1806. He was a Representative Peer.\r\n\r\n[352] See _ante_, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[353] Second daughter of Lord Ilchester, afterwards wife of Sir Edward\r\nClarence Kerrison.\r\n\r\n[354] Lady Emily Cowper. She married Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of\r\nShaftesbury. She, her sister Lady Fanny, and her brothers Spencer\r\nCowper and William Cowper (afterwards Cowper-Temple), were children of\r\nthe fifth Earl Cowper, whose wife, a sister of Lord Melbourne, married,\r\nsecondly, Lord Palmerston in 1839. Spencer Cowper married the widow of\r\nCount d’Orsay, the step-daughter of Lady Blessington.\r\n\r\n[355] Edward Sugden (1781–1875). Afterwards Lord St. Leonards, and Lord\r\nChancellor in the Derby Administration of 1852. A dry but efficient\r\nlawyer, an excellent interpreter of any man’s Will but his own, which\r\nwas disputed.\r\n\r\n[356] Henry Hunt had been a great agitator, notably in the years\r\n1816–20. He was elected for Preston in 1830.\r\n\r\n[357] Lord Brougham, not having been included in the second\r\nAdministration of Lord Melbourne, was unsparing in his criticisms of\r\nhis old colleagues. As Lord Melbourne once pointed out in reply to\r\none of Brougham’s brilliant attacks, the reasons for excluding Lord\r\nBrougham from any Ministry must have been very grave, if measured by\r\nthe obvious reasons for including him.\r\n\r\n[358] George, third Lord Boston (1777–1869).\r\n\r\n[359] Frederick, second Lord Boston (1749–1825).\r\n\r\n[360] Daughter of the second Earl of Chichester; married in October\r\n1837 to the Rev. and Hon. L. J. Barrington.\r\n\r\n[361] Lady Melbourne was a daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, and William\r\nLamb was her favourite son. When Peniston, her eldest son, died, she\r\nencouraged William to devote himself to politics and to abandon the Bar.\r\n\r\n[362] The Canadian question was one of the most difficult of the\r\nearly years of the Queen’s reign. Upper and Lower Canada were totally\r\ndissimilar in race, tradition, and natural position. Lower Canada was\r\npeopled mainly by French Roman Catholics, Upper Canada by Scottish\r\nProtestants, and the mode of Government in both was as cumbrous and\r\ninappropriate as it could well be, and afforded unquestionable ground\r\nfor grievance on the part of the inhabitants. In 1836 a rebellion broke\r\nout in the Lower Province headed by Papineau, who had been Speaker\r\nof the Assembly. This was followed by an insurrection in the Upper\r\nProvince, which was quelled in a striking and almost quixotic manner\r\nby Sir Francis Head, the Governor, who, dismissing all his regular\r\ntroops to the Lower Province, trusted to the people to put down the\r\nmalcontents, and succeeded. Lord Durham was sent out in 1838 as High\r\nCommissioner and Governor-General. His report on the proper method\r\nof administering the Colony is historical, and ultimately formed the\r\nbasis of settlement. His acts were not approved by the Whig Government\r\nand were annulled by them. He anticipated his recall by resigning and\r\ncoming home before the end of 1838.\r\n\r\n[363] Charles, second son of Lord Grey, the ex-Premier. He was Equerry\r\nto the Queen, and had a year or two earlier defeated Disraeli at the\r\nHigh Wycombe election. He became Private Secretary to Prince Albert and\r\nlater to the Queen. He spent all the years of his life in the Queen’s\r\nservice, and was always helpful, wise, and unbiassed in the advice he\r\ntendered her. The present Earl Grey, Lady Victoria Dawnay, Lady Antrim,\r\nand Lady Minto are his surviving children. Many good judges considered\r\nhis abilities of a higher order than those of his father.\r\n\r\n[364] Lady Caroline Ponsonby, daughter of the third Earl of\r\nBessborough, a lady of eccentric mind and habits. She was thrown off\r\nher mental and moral balance by her acquaintance with Lord Byron, not\r\nperhaps so surprising as the fact that she never recovered either even\r\nafter Byron’s death.\r\n\r\n[365] Lord Melbourne’s brother, afterwards Lord Beauvale, Ambassador\r\nExtraordinary at Vienna. As a diplomatist he was irreproachable,\r\nhandsome, agreeable, and adroit. In private life he was not altogether\r\n_sans reproche_. Without his brother William’s literary acquirements,\r\nand with less sarcasm and pungent wit, he yet had a vigorous\r\nunderstanding, much information, and no little capacity for affairs. At\r\nsixty years of age, and in broken health, he married a very young lady,\r\nthe daughter of Count Maltzahn, the Prussian Minister at Vienna.\r\n\r\n[366] Henry Richard, third Lord Holland of the 1762 creation, was\r\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Under the auspices of his wife,\r\nHolland House, Kensington, was for many years the Zoar of weary Whig\r\npoliticians. See _ante_, p. 101, note.\r\n\r\n[367] Amelia, daughter of the Grand Duke of Oldenbourg, married to Otho\r\nI., King of Greece.\r\n\r\n[368] Uncle of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[369] Nicholas I., reigned 1826–55.\r\n\r\n[370] Ferdinand I., born in 1793, succeeded his father, Francis I., in\r\n1835. He was brother to Napoleon’s second wife, Marie Louise.\r\n\r\n[371] Charles, fourth Earl of Harrington, married Maria, daughter of\r\nSamuel Foote the actor.\r\n\r\n[372] William, first Earl of Craven, married Louisa, an undistinguished\r\nactress, daughter of John Brunton of Norwich.\r\n\r\n[373] Edward, twelfth Earl of Derby, married Elizabeth Farren, a\r\nHaymarket actress of considerable beauty and charm.\r\n\r\n[374] Afterwards Field-Marshal and first Lord Seaton. He was one\r\nof Wellington’s generals in the Peninsula and at Waterloo. He was\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, and on Lord Durham’s recall was\r\nnominated to succeed him.\r\n\r\n[375] Lord Francis Egerton was the second son of George Granville,\r\nfirst Duke of Sutherland. The immense fortune of Francis, third and\r\nlast Duke of Bridgewater (the father of English inland navigation and,\r\nin conjunction with Brindley, constructor of the canal which bears\r\nhis name) was devised to the first Duke of Sutherland for life, and\r\nthereafter to Lord Francis, who on attaining possession assumed the\r\nsurname of Egerton, in lieu of Leveson-Gower. A “condition subsequent”\r\ntending to divest the property in a certain event was decided to be\r\nopposed to “public policy.” Lord Francis was created Earl of Ellesmere\r\nin 1846.\r\n\r\n[376] Lady Falkland. Amelia Fitzclarence, daughter of William IV. See\r\n_ante_, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[377] Edward Berkeley Portman, representative of an old Dorsetshire and\r\nSomersetshire family, was created Baron Portman in 1837. In 1827 he\r\nmarried Emma, third daughter of the Earl of Harewood, who was at this\r\ntime one of the Ladies of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n[378] This high Constitutional doctrine was certain to meet with the\r\napproval of a Whig like Lord Melbourne. It has been the secret of\r\nministerial responsibility and of executive power in the Constitution\r\nof this country, and its working has been admired by many foreign\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\n[379] Baron Alexander von Munchausen, a Hanoverian diplomatist, was\r\nthen about twenty-five. He was _not_ the hero of a celebrated romance.\r\n\r\n[380] That the Queen always retained a sentiment for her dolls may\r\nbe realised from the care with which they were preserved. They are\r\nexhibited in the London Museum at Kensington, arranged and ticketed\r\nwith the names given to them by Princess Victoria.\r\n\r\n[381] Letitia, wife of Sir Hussey (afterwards Lord) Vivian. The child\r\nLalage married, in 1857, Henry Hyde Nugent Bankes, son of the Right\r\nHon. George Bankes.\r\n\r\n[382] See _ante_, p. 73.\r\n\r\n[383] Mr. (afterwards Rt. Hon.) John Arthur Roebuck. A Liberal “free\r\nlance,” who earned the _sobriquet_ of “Tear-’em.” Lord John Russell had\r\nbrought in a Bill for suspending the Constitution of Canada, and Mr.\r\nRoebuck, who was not at the time in Parliament, claimed to be heard at\r\nthe bar of both Houses as agent for the Lower Province. He made a very\r\nable but bitter speech.\r\n\r\n[384] Catherine, widow of the twelfth Earl of Desmond, died in 1604,\r\nhaving survived her husband seventy years. There seems much doubt\r\nabout the principal dates of her life, _e.g._ those of her birth and\r\nmarriage, but she is _said_ to have attained the remarkable age of\r\n140 years, and to have died by a fall from a cherry-tree. Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh records that he knew her and that she “was married in Edward\r\nIV.’s time.”\r\n\r\n[385] Henry Brooke Parnell had been member for Maryborough in the\r\nIrish House of Commons, and was now member for Dundee. He was made\r\nPaymaster-General on that office being constituted in 1838. Afterwards\r\ncreated Lord Congleton.\r\n\r\n[386] The Duke never allowed political feeling to interfere with what\r\nhe considered public duty. As a politician he was a Tory; but as a\r\nsoldier he had no politics.\r\n\r\n[387] Lord Ellenborough (1790–1871) was a son of the Chief Justice,\r\nand sat in several Conservative Cabinets. He was Governor-General of\r\nIndia in 1844, and recalled from his post by the directors of the East\r\nIndia Company in opposition to the wish of the Cabinet, who at once\r\nrecommended him for an earldom. He was too imaginative and daring for\r\nthe post of Governor-General at this period of Indian administrative\r\nhistory; but his memory was often revived in the person of a more\r\ndaring and more brilliant successor in that high office.\r\n\r\n[388] Alexander, first Lord Ashburton, had been President of the Board\r\nof Trade in the brief Peel Administration of 1834–5. He married Miss\r\nBingham of Philadelphia.

Lady Francis was Harriet, eldest daughter of\r\nCharles Greville, the father of the diarist.\r\n\r\n[392] Stafford House was built by the Duke of York. It is Crown\r\nproperty vested in the Commission of Woods and Forests. The present\r\n(1912) Duke of Sutherland obtained an extension of the Crown lease a\r\nfew years ago.\r\n\r\n[393] Charles Philip, fourth Earl of Hardwicke, had married Susan,\r\ndaughter of the first Lord Ravensworth. See _ante_, p. 84, n.\r\n\r\n[394] _Tempora mutantur._\r\n\r\n[395] At the opening of the Queen’s first Parliament in 1837 Lord\r\nLeveson [afterwards Lord Granville and Foreign Secretary] had moved in\r\nthe House of Commons the address in reply to her speech, looking, wrote\r\nDisraeli, himself also a new member, “like a child.” Lord Leveson was\r\ntwenty-two years old, and the Queen had met him a few years earlier\r\nat Christ Church. See _ante_, p. 60. His mother, Lady Granville, was\r\nHenrietta, daughter of the fifth Duke of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[396] Lady Lilford was a daughter of Lord and Lady Holland.\r\n\r\n[397] Charles Christopher, first Lord Cottenham. On Lord Melbourne\r\nforming his second Ministry, the Great Seal was not offered to\r\nBrougham, but at first put into Commission. Pepys, Master of the Rolls,\r\nwas one of the Commissioners, and became a little later Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[398] William Henry, second Earl of Dunraven (1782–1850).\r\n\r\n[399] See _ante_, p. 278.\r\n\r\n[400] She was Louisa Elizabeth, daughter of Lord Grey the ex-Premier,\r\nmother of the “Master Lambton” of Lawrence’s portrait, who died, aged\r\nfourteen, and grandmother of the present Earl of Durham, K.G.\r\n\r\n[401] King Otho had accepted the throne of Greece in October 1832, and\r\nascended it three months later. This was done in virtue of a request\r\nfrom Greece to Great Britain, France, and Russia.\r\n\r\n[402] Mahmud II., Sultan (1808–39), succeeded in the latter year by\r\nAbdul-Medjid.\r\n\r\n[403] Of some fame, but little merit. He managed the stables of George\r\nIV., when Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n[404] This rule was followed with invariable and prudent strictness\r\nby the Queen throughout her reign. She was never swayed in action by\r\ngossip, however subtle or ill-natured—she required proof; and this rule\r\ngoverned her decision in regard to disputes as to the eligibility of\r\nall persons to be invited to Court.\r\n\r\n[405] Lord Howe’s attitude was one of hostility to the Government. See\r\n_ante_, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[406] George Bartley (died in 1858), a Shakespearean actor who could\r\nplay Orlando as well as Falstaff.

Sir John Colborne postponed a decision\r\nof the matter, and ultimately the prisoners were dealt with according\r\nto the gravity of the case, some being merely bound over, others\r\ndeported to Bermuda.\r\n\r\n[410] Great complaints were being made of the cruelty of the Jamaica\r\nplanters to their negro apprentices, and Brougham had put himself\r\nat the head of an agitation in favour of immediate emancipation.\r\nAccordingly the Government introduced a Bill regulating the hours\r\nof labour, erecting arbitration tribunals for appraising the value\r\nof apprentices desiring a discharge, and forbidding the whipping or\r\ncutting the hair of female apprentices, or their being placed on a\r\ntreadmill, or in the chair of a penal gang.\r\n\r\n[411] Street riots had broken out at Lisbon, but the Queen behaved\r\nwith great courage, and, after Costa Cabral had been installed as\r\nCivil Governor of the city, the insurgent forces were dispersed. The\r\noccurrence of Donna Maria’s nineteenth birthday on 4th April was marked\r\nby an amnesty, purporting to blot out the revolutionary actions of the\r\nlast eighteen months.\r\n\r\n[412] John, second Marquess and fifth Earl of Breadalbane, F.R.S.\r\n(1796–1862).\r\n\r\n[413] A distinguished Peninsular officer, who had commanded the\r\nPortuguese division at Vittoria; Commander-in-chief at Bombay 1825–9.\r\n\r\n[414] John, afterwards eleventh Earl of Westmorland, son of John, tenth\r\nEarl and Sarah Anne his wife, only daughter and heir of Robert Child of\r\nOsterley Park.

Appointed Judge\r\nAdvocate-General in 1839, and in 1846 Home Secretary under Lord John\r\nRussell, an office which he held for nearly twenty years. He was a\r\nman of fine presence and great social charm. His high moral qualities\r\nand freedom from personal ambition gained for him the esteem of both\r\npolitical parties and the confidence of his countrymen. He has been\r\nworthily succeeded in his title and all else by his grandson, Sir\r\nEdward Grey, K.G.\r\n\r\n[427] This brilliant advocate, who died at the age of forty-seven, had\r\nbeen Peel’s Solicitor-General, and became Attorney-General in 1841. He\r\nappeared for Norton in his action for _crim. con._ against Melbourne,\r\nwithout any success, for the charge was triumphantly refuted.\r\n\r\n[428] See _ante_, p. 149.\r\n\r\n[429] The Hon. F.

The King employed him in various confidential matters.\r\n\r\n[439] Queen Victoria in 1872 wrote of Louis as “the former faithful and\r\ndevoted friend of Princess Charlotte—beloved and respected by all who\r\nknew her—and who doted on the little Princess who was too much an idol\r\nin the House. This dear old lady was visited by every one, and was the\r\nonly really devoted attendant of the poor Princess, whose governesses\r\npaid little real attention to her, and who never left her, and was with\r\nher when she died.” See p. 62.\r\n\r\n[440] Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, was appointed Ambassador of\r\nthe King of the French at Queen Victoria’s Coronation.

This\r\nquestion of the oath to be taken by Roman Catholic peers and members\r\nhad been repeatedly brought forward by the Bishop of Exeter. It pledged\r\nthe jurant to do nothing to “disturb or weaken the Protestant Religion\r\nor Protestant Government, or to subvert the Church establishment.” A\r\ngentleman wrote to the Bishop to say that he could not take the oath,\r\nas his wish was to upset the Church establishment, and he was therefore\r\nexcluded from Parliament.

Townshend was President of the Council 1720,\r\nand afterwards Secretary of State.

This collection was recently\r\noverhauled by Mr. Lionel Cust. It is now in fine order, carefully\r\narranged in the Provost’s Lodge at Eton. The portraits have been\r\nengraved and collected in the form of a sumptuous volume.\r\n\r\n[510] This may be the portrait now in the Corridor at Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\n[511] W. F. Chambers, Physician-in-Ordinary to King William and Queen\r\nAdelaide, and afterwards to Queen Victoria and the Duchess of Kent.\r\n\r\n[512] Sir Michael O’Loghlen did not, however, leave the Rolls. The new\r\nChief Baron was Mr. Stephen Woulfe, the Irish Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n[513] She married Lord Sandwich (see p. 191) in the following September.\r\n\r\n[514] Lady Adelaide Paget (afterwards Lady Adelaide Cadogan). See\r\n_ante_, p. 319.\r\n\r\n[515] The Marriage Act of 1835 made null and void all marriages within\r\nthe prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity. Before they had\r\nonly been voidable.\r\n\r\n[516] In this case the two wives were _half_ sisters, daughters of the\r\nDuke of Wellington’s sister by different husbands.\r\n\r\n[517] The Prince Consort was strongly in favour of legalising these\r\nmarriages, and King Edward (then Prince of Wales) always voted in\r\nfavour of the Bills introduced for the purpose of amending the law.\r\n\r\n[518] This custom has now unfortunately fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\n[519] No one has a prescriptive or _ex officio_ right to wear the\r\n“Windsor uniform.” It is an honour conferred personally by the\r\nSovereign. Of recent Prime Ministers, this privilege has been enjoyed\r\nby Lord Salisbury, Lord Rosebery, and Mr. Balfour.\r\n\r\n[520] Sunderland’s Ministry in 1718 introduced a measure to limit the\r\ncreation of peers, the object being to prevent the Prince of Wales\r\n(when King) from swamping the Lords with his partisans. Walpole spoke\r\nand wrote vigorously against the Bill, and organised the opposition\r\nto it in anticipation of the time when it should reach the Commons.\r\nHe succeeded in altering the public attitude to the Bill, and it was\r\nrejected by a large majority.\r\n\r\n[521] After this date, that is to say, the early part of the Queen’s\r\nreign, the Order of the Bath began to be somewhat neglected. It was\r\npartly owing to the creation of new Orders, such as the Star of India\r\nand the St. Michael and George. It has, however, recently been ordained\r\nby King George V. that the annual service for the Order of the Bath in\r\nWestminster Abbey shall be revived, and the banners and shields of the\r\nKnights Grand Cross be affixed to their stalls in Henry VIIth.’s chapel.\r\n\r\n[522] See _ante_, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[523] Sir Peter King, who became Lord Chancellor, was created Lord\r\nKing of Ockham in 1725. The present baron (eighth holder of the title)\r\nhad married in 1835, Ada, the only child of Lord Byron. Lord King now\r\nbecame Earl of Lovelace.\r\n\r\n[524] Eldest son of the Duke of Leeds, who died in the following month.\r\n\r\n[525] In 1847, when the offer was repeated, Lord Melbourne wrote to the\r\nQueen that “for a long time he had found himself much straitened in his\r\ncircumstances” and that “he knows that the expense of accepting the\r\nribbon amounts to £1,000, and there has been of late years no period at\r\nwhich it would not have been seriously inconvenient to him to pay down\r\nsuch a sum.”\r\n\r\n[526] With the exception of Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Palmerston, no\r\nPrime Minister, as such, has accepted the Garter in recent times.\r\n\r\n[527] Sir Sotherton Peckham-Micklethwait, of Iridge Place, Sussex.\r\nCreated a baronet “for a personal service rendered to Her Majesty and\r\nthe Duchess of Kent at St. Leonards in Nov. 1834.” See _ante_, p. 104.\r\n\r\n[528] Clarenceux King-of-Arms, afterwards Garter.\r\n\r\n[529] Edward Maltby (1770–1859), Bishop of Durham, to which he had been\r\nrecently translated from Chichester.\r\n\r\n[530] The ceremonial as described by the Queen does not compare\r\nfavourably with those of King Edward or King George, when hardly\r\na mistake was made by any of those officiating. The ritual at the\r\nCoronation of King Edward was especially difficult, owing to the age\r\nand infirmities of Archbishop Temple.\r\n\r\n[531] Lord Surrey was son and heir of the Earl Marshal, the twelfth\r\nDuke of Norfolk, whom he succeeded in 1842. He married Charlotte\r\nSophia, daughter of the first Duke of Sutherland.\r\n\r\n[532] The Litany was omitted at the Coronation of King Edward VII., and\r\nreintroduced at the Coronation of King George V.\r\n\r\n[533] The robe is exhibited in the London Museum at Kensington Palace.\r\n\r\n[534] Second son of Louis Philippe. He was offered two thrones, Belgium\r\nin 1831 and Greece in 1832, but declined both. See _ante_, p. 130.\r\n\r\n[535] This has been remedied by the recent custom of giving a\r\nViscountcy to any Secretary of State who is raised to the Peerage.\r\n\r\n[536] Nicholas, third Baron Audley by writ and tenth by tenure, fought\r\nin the wars with France 1359 and 1372. His sister Joan married Sir John\r\nTuchet, killed at Rochelle, 1371, and her grandson succeeded to the\r\ntitle. On the death, in 1872, of the twenty-first Baron (son of George\r\nEdward Thicknesse Touchet, twentieth Baron, whom the Queen and Lord\r\nMelbourne were discussing), the barony fell into abeyance between his\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\n[537] Eldest son of the Duke of Sutherland, and nine years old. He\r\nsucceeded his father as third Duke in 1861.\r\n\r\n[538] Eldest son of Lord Conyngham, and thirteen years old. Succeeded\r\nas third Marquess in 1876, and died in 1882.\r\n\r\n[539] Eldest son of Lord Uxbridge, seventeen years old. Died in 1880.\r\n\r\n[540] This was certainly an error of judgment on the part of Lord\r\nMelbourne. The Queen’s appearance on horseback, in the uniform still to\r\nbe seen in the London Museum at Kensington Palace, was extraordinarily\r\nfascinating, and added greatly to the interest of any Review at which\r\nshe appeared.\r\n\r\n[541] The Queen evidently did not grasp a name unfamiliar to her.\r\nThe ratification of the Treaty of Amiens was sent over by Napoleon\r\nin charge of Colonel Lauriston, his A.D.C. When this officer left\r\nthe house of M. Otto in London to deliver his credentials to Lord\r\nHawkesbury, the scene occurred which the Queen here describes. The\r\ncarriage was accompanied to Downing Street by a guard of honour of the\r\nHousehold Cavalry.\r\n\r\n[542] Afterwards first Baron Lyons of Christchurch (1790–1858). At\r\nthis time Minister Plenipotentiary at Athens. In 1853, war with Russia\r\nbeing imminent, he was appointed second in command of the fleet in the\r\nMediterranean, and displayed boldness and initiative in the attack on\r\nthe sea defences of Sebastopol. He became Commander-in-Chief in 1855,\r\nand, on the termination of the war, a Peer.\r\n\r\n[543] The dukedom of Montagu, created in 1766, become extinct at the\r\ndeath of the first Duke in 1790.\r\n\r\n[544] In later years Edward Geoffrey, fourteenth Earl of Derby, three\r\ntimes Prime Minister, was reported to have refused a dukedom, on the\r\nground that he would not exchange his Earl’s coronet, which dated from\r\nthe fifteenth century, for a set of new strawberry leaves.\r\n\r\n[545] Lord Melbourne’s private secretary. He afterwards served Prince\r\nAlbert in a similar capacity. See Vol. II. p. 37.\r\n\r\n[546] He was for a time _Attaché_ to the British Embassy in Paris, and\r\ndied in 1847.\r\n\r\n[547] A lovely portrait of her by Gainsborough is the property of Lord\r\nRothschild at Tring Park.\r\n\r\n[548] Lord Seymour bore, by courtesy, the only other title of his\r\nfather, the Duke of Somerset. So there was not a third title available\r\nfor the grandson, as is the case in other families of ducal rank.\r\n\r\n[549] Thomas Sheridan, actor and lecturer on elocution. Published in\r\n1780 a General Dictionary of the English Language with a special view\r\nto teaching pronunciation. A work of phonetic rather than philological\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n[550] Eldest surviving son of the third Marquess of Lansdowne, and\r\nafterwards fourth Marquess. The elder brother (Lord Kerry) had died\r\nwithout male issue.\r\n\r\n[551] Aunt of Lord Shelburne. She was a daughter of the fourth Earl of\r\nBessborough.\r\n\r\n[552] Lord Shelburne married in 1840 Lady Georgina Herbert, daughter\r\nof the eleventh Earl of Pembroke. She died in the following year. In\r\n1843 he married the Hon. Emily Elphinstone-de-Flahaut, in her own right\r\nBaroness Nairne.\r\n\r\n[553] Formerly Lady Cavendish. Her husband had succeeded as second Earl\r\nof Burlington in 1834. See _ante_, p. 53. She died in 1840.\r\n\r\n[554] George, fifth Earl of Essex (1757–1839).\r\n\r\n[555] Ladies of unblemished character, retired from the stage, were\r\npermitted to appear at Court.\r\n\r\n[556] Charles, Earl Grey, the ex-Prime Minister, who rarely came to\r\ntown at this period of his life, and must have been a novelty for the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n[557] Count Stroganoff was the special representative of the Czar at\r\nthe Coronation.\r\n\r\n[558] His son who died, aged four years, in 1783.\r\n\r\n[559] Lady Sarah Lennox, who was a daughter of the second Duke of\r\nRichmond, married first, Sir Thomas Charles Bunbury, secondly the Hon.\r\nGeorge Napier. George III. was undoubtedly much attracted by this\r\nlady. By her second marriage she became the “Mother of the Napiers,” a\r\ndesignation almost as famous in the British history of the Napoleonic\r\nWars as the “Mother of the Gracchi” in Republican Rome.\r\n\r\n[560] Daughters of John Gunning, of Castle Coote. See _ante_, p. 215.\r\n\r\n[561] Lord Alfred Paget. See _ante_, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[562] See _ante_, p. 310.\r\n\r\n[563] Mehemet Ali, the Pasha, having announced his intention to pay no\r\nmore tribute to the Porte (an action equivalent to a declaration of\r\nindependence), great efforts were made by the representatives of the\r\nPowers to induce him to reconsider his decision.\r\n\r\n[564] The French Ambassador in London.\r\n\r\n[565] Baron Heinrich von Bülow, many years Prussian representative in\r\nLondon, afterwards Prussian Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n[566] The adjustment of the debt between Holland and Belgium.\r\n\r\n[567] The equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington stood on the arch\r\nat Hyde Park Corner from 1846 to 1883. It excited much ridicule at the\r\ntime of its erection. There was a question of its removal, but the Duke\r\nof Wellington strongly opposed the suggestion. He said that he never\r\nwished his statue to be put upon the Arch, but once there, there it\r\nshould remain. It was removed nearly forty years later to Aldershot.\r\nRecently some prancing horses and a chariot have taken the place of old\r\nCopenhagen and the Duke.\r\n\r\n[568] As an illustration of the vagaries of “taste” in Art, it may be\r\nmentioned that this statue is now considered one of the most successful\r\nin London.\r\n\r\n[569] This refers to the reading by the Queen of her “Speech.”\r\n\r\n[570] All this paragraph refers to the disputes between Belgium and\r\nHolland over their respective financial responsibilities.\r\n\r\n[571] Afterwards Sir John MacNeill. He had been sent as Envoy to\r\nTeheran to try to prevent the Shah attacking the Afghans.\r\n\r\n[572] Lord Melbourne was a “low Churchman and an Erastian,” like so\r\nmany of the Whigs of that day.\r\n\r\n[573] This love of straight dealing and dislike of flattery were\r\nlifelong characteristics of the Queen.\r\n\r\n[574] In 1815 Belgium and Holland were, by the action of the European\r\nPowers at the Congress of Vienna, united into one Kingdom. This led to\r\nconstant friction and even to open hostilities between the two nations,\r\nand in 1831 a Conference of the Powers decreed a dissolution of the\r\nUnion, and drew up a Treaty, but the division of territory again led\r\nto a war which is chiefly notable for the siege of Antwerp in 1832. In\r\n1838 Holland announced for the first time her readiness to accede to\r\nthe provisions of the Treaty of 1832. The Belgians claimed that this\r\nacquiescence came too late, but under pressure of the Powers she had\r\nin the end to give her assent. During this excitement the failure of\r\nthe Bank of Brussels produced a financial crisis which caused great\r\ndistress among the people.\r\n\r\n[575] Count von Senfft Pilsach was Austrian Minister at The Hague, and\r\ncame to England in 1838 as Austrian Plenipotentiary at the Conference\r\nwhich took place in London to settle the Separation of Holland and\r\nBelgium. He signed the Treaty of 1839 on behalf of Austria.\r\n\r\n[576] Member for Oxford University. He had displaced Sir Robert Peel at\r\nthe time of the Tory split on Catholic Emancipation.\r\n\r\n[577] This was common Whig doctrine up to the Crimean War, when the\r\nunreadiness of the Military Authorities caused a reaction, which\r\nindirectly led to the fall of the Aberdeen Government.\r\n\r\n[578] Wife of Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\n[579] Melbourne House stood on the site of the Albany. See Vol. II., p.\r\n96.\r\n\r\n[580] In 1771 the Duke of Cumberland secretly married Anne, daughter\r\nof Lord Irnham (afterwards Earl of Carhampton) and widow of Andrew\r\nHorton. Her brother was Colonel Luttrell, the opponent of Wilkes. Not\r\nlong afterwards, the Duke of Gloucester made public the fact of his\r\nmarriage to the Dowager Countess Waldegrave. These two marriages led\r\nto the passing of the Royal Marriage Act, which governs (with certain\r\nexceptions) the marriages of all descendants of George II. See _ante_,\r\np. 333, and Vol. II., p. 43.\r\n\r\n[581] Lord Melbourne modified this opinion next day.\r\n\r\n[582] Partly in consequence of his intrigues with the Prince of Wales\r\nagainst Pitt in the matter of the Regency Bill.\r\n\r\n[583] Brownlow North, Bishop successively of Lichfield, Worcester, and\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\n[584] See note, _post_, p. 397.\r\n\r\n[585] Mary, daughter of the first Viscount Galway, married, as his\r\nsecond wife, Edmund, seventh Earl of Cork. She died in 1840.\r\n\r\n[586] _Remarks on an Article for the “Edinburgh Review” on the Times\r\nof George III. and George IV._, by General Sir Herbert Taylor, who had\r\nbeen Secretary successively to the Duke of York, George III., Queen\r\nCharlotte, and William IV.\r\n\r\n[587] _A Diary illustrative of the Times of George IV._, published in\r\n1838. See _ante_, p. 310.\r\n\r\n[588] Lady Anne Hamilton was a lady-in-waiting of Caroline, wife of\r\nGeorge IV., whom she accompanied to England in 1820. _The Secret\r\nHistory of the Court_ was published without her name, but the\r\nauthorship was never disputed.\r\n\r\n[589] Lord Guilford was the son of Lord North, George III.’s Minister,\r\nand his sister, here mentioned, was Lady Charlotte Lindsay, wife of\r\nLieut.-Col. Hon. John Lindsay. See _ante_, p. 392.\r\n\r\n[590] James Kenney (1780–1849), a successful dramatist. He was the\r\noriginal Jeremy Diddler in his own _Raising the Wind_, when it was\r\nacted by amateurs. The play was subsequently performed at Covent Garden.\r\n\r\n[591] Granville Penn (1761–1844), grandson of William Penn, the founder\r\nof Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[592] Lady Emmeline Wortley, daughter of the fifth Duke of Rutland,\r\nwife of Charles Stuart Wortley. Her daughter, Victoria, goddaughter\r\nof the Duchess of Kent, afterwards Lady Welby-Gregory, was sometime a\r\nmaid-of-honour to the Queen.\r\n\r\n[593] Granville, Earl Gower (1721–1803), had sat for Westminster before\r\nhis accession to the Peerage. Thereafter he was Lord Privy Seal, Lord\r\nChamberlain and President of the Council. He was created Marquess\r\nof Stafford, and K.G. He married Lady Louisa Egerton, daughter and\r\nco-heiress of Scrope, first Duke of Bridgwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n  • Text enclosed by underscores is in italics (_italics_).\r\n  • Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected.",
