M.: “I wish you merry\r\nChristmas, Ma,—I wish you happy New Year, Pa,—now gim me cent;” with my\r\nfather’s: “Go to sleep, you young rascal, or I’ll come and spank you;”\r\nthe two cents I always got on the 4th of July, if I had been a good boy,\r\nand the solitary penny if I hadn’t; the death of my mother of twins; the\r\ncopious tears of my father and Aunt Lucy; my grief at her sudden demise;\r\nthe country boarding school, and the blast of lightning that felled me\r\nto the earth, while whittling on the summer green; my eyes soon open on\r\nthe glories of the lurid universe, and I scamper into the pretty\r\ncottage, and bound into the arms of my aunt, who nearly smothers me with\r\naffectionate embraces; the storm passes; a bow appears, with crimson\r\narrows, and lingers on the concave’s rosy verge, till Venus gleams\r\nthrough the twilight leaves, when its gorgeous hues are vailed by the\r\nrevolving spheres, and it descends the dazzling west.\r\n\r\n               Whose Archer follows the resplendent sun,\r\n               Before whose darts the stormy Furies run;\r\n\r\nthe moon ascends the east in matchless splendor, and roams in tranquil\r\nbeauty through infinitude, spreading its snowy light on vale and mead,\r\nthat vie with lakes of liquid silver; my aunt lingers at my bed, while I\r\nsay my evening prayer, and invests my heart with sacred feelings; myself\r\nand brother William, on our way to school, through a dreary wood, espy a\r\nboy in a wagon, when I exclaim: “Why, Bill, there’s our brother Albert;”\r\nBill stares and says: “Steve, your perceptions are very foggy, and I\r\nbegin to think you aint got good sense;” I closely scan the boy, and\r\nsmile, but elicit no response, the little rogue riveting his bright blue\r\neyes on the vacant air; Bill passes on to school, with: “Steve, you are\r\nraving mad, and I’m going to tell Aunt Freeman so;” when I address the\r\nstranger thus: “Little boy, you look like my brother Albert, and this\r\nhorse and wagon resemble ours, and won’t you please to tell me if you\r\naint my brother Al, who lives far away from here, in a place called\r\nProvidence? I always dearly loved him, and I havn’t seen him for a long\r\ntime now, and I would like to see him very much; come, now, little boy,\r\naint you Ally Branch, and if you are, won’t you please to tell me so?”\r\nTears roll down his pale cheeks, followed by the sweetest smiles, (like\r\nsimultaneous rain and sunshine,) extending his arms, with: “How do you\r\ndo, dear brother Stevy;” I scream; dart into the wagon, and, placing my\r\narms around his neck, fondly kiss him. And then I made the woods ring\r\nwith my cries for Bill to return, and behold our dear brother, found so\r\nmysteriously alone in the forest wild. Bill slowly returns; and I hear\r\nthe echo of a laugh, and see a man emerge from the monarch oaks, whom I\r\ndiscern as father, whose playful stratagem blares brightly before my\r\nenraptured vision. And with the velocity of light, I spring from the\r\nwagon, and at a bound, am in the embraces of my adored father. The vail\r\nslowly passes from the eyes of Bill, who stands like a statue in the dim\r\nperspective, crying lustily over my triumphant conquest. We all shout\r\nand wave our hands, and Willie bounds into Albert’s and father’s arms,\r\nwhose fervent kisses soon dispel his tears; when his crescent and\r\nrevolving eyes gently threaten to eclipse the sun and moon with\r\nhilarious splendor; three happy brothers then rock the forest solitude\r\nwith merry vociferations, and run like deer, and sing like infant\r\nJubals, with sweet responses from congenial birds, prancing on the oaks’\r\nmajestic branches. And with hearts of gladness, we spring like hounds\r\ninto the wagon, and return to Aunt Freeman’s, and that I regard as one\r\nof the happiest days of my early boyhood. On the following morn, we\r\nleave for Providence, which I scarcely reach, ere our yard is a camp of\r\nboys, eager to embrace their favorite commander, after his long\r\ncaptivity in the desert wilds of Woodstock; myself and Albert soon go to\r\nanother country school; we board with a minister who has a large family,\r\nand a small salary, which was tardily and scantily paid with very poor\r\nprovisions; myself and Al don’t like the fare; has fried pork too often\r\nfor breakfast, and pork and beans for dinner, with a cold cut of pork\r\nand beans at nightfall; and we enter our solemn protest against so much\r\nfried hog, and so many baked beans; we protest, too, against his not\r\nfastening the doors and windows nights, as father does at home; we hear\r\nstrange noises nights, while abed; and respectfully implore him to put\r\nlocks on the doors, and nails in the windows, who refuses, and says,\r\nthat good boys are never afraid of robbers or assassins; we still hear\r\ndreadful sounds at midnight; and bury ourselves, head and all, in the\r\nbed clothes; sweat terribly, and nearly smother; grow pale; lose flesh;\r\nget very weak; have cold night sweats; finally despair, and threaten to\r\nleave for home; write long letters to father, full of bad writing and\r\nspelling, who doesn’t answer them, because he can’t read them; we start\r\nfor Providence; our sacred host pursues us on a cadaverous horse, whose\r\nribs rattle, and captures us in the haunted woods, where, in old times,\r\na man was murdered, and two lovers hung themselves, because their\r\nparents wouldn’t let them marry; I and Al were hurrying through this\r\ndreadful wood, when old cadaverous and the parson pounce upon us, who\r\nthreatens to whip us if we don’t return, and cuts a switch for the\r\npurpose; his eyes roll terribly, and, as I once heard he was slightly\r\ninsane at times, and, fearing he might murder me, I gave the wink to Al,\r\nand we concluded to return, very gently shaking our heads and fists,\r\nwith threats of telling our father all about it some day, who was a\r\nJustice of the Peace, and could lock up any body, and have them hung\r\nbeside; to silence our unceasing clamors, the parson gets some cheap\r\nsecond-hand locks, and rusty nails, fastens the doors and windows\r\nnights, and gives us fried liver twice a week for breakfast, and lets\r\npork and beans slide awhile, with very tender veal instead; don’t hear\r\nstrange sounds at night any more; sleep very soundly; don’t hear the\r\ncheerless midnight winds as of yore; get fat as butter; are very\r\ncontented; Fourth of July close at hand; father comes after us; shed\r\ntears of joy, and run and jump like wild cats, and get home alive once\r\nmore from a country boarding school; go to a party on the night of our\r\narrival; Oscar Rivulet and Clara Violet are there; at the party’s close,\r\nI can’t find my hat, and while in its vigorous pursuit, Oscar takes the\r\narm of Clara, when I step up and whisper in his ear, that I will\r\nchastise him the very next day for cutting me out; Oscar and Clara\r\ndepart; I find my hat in the oven, where Oscar doubtless put it, and\r\nbegin to cry with rage; to console me, my aunt places the arm of Flora\r\nRosebud in mine, who was a dashing little belle, with whom I slowly\r\nramble towards her home beneath a brilliant sky; soon after I bid Flora\r\ngood night, at her father’s door, a dark cloud rapidly arose and\r\nobscured the moon, and I became afraid, and ran fleetly home, expecting\r\nto meet an assassin at every corner’s turn, but when I heard the\r\ncheerful watchman’s cry of “half-past eight o’clock, and all’s well,”\r\nand beheld his noble form in the distance, my fears are tranquilized,\r\nand I walk as erect and firm as the hero of many battles, and loudly\r\nboast of my courage, after I get snugly in the trundle bed with Albert,\r\nthe shield of my father’s voice above me, to fortify my pretended valor.\r\nOn the following day, my step-mother struck me on the head with a jacket\r\nwith brass buttons, for my impudence at dinner in my father’s absence,\r\nbecause she wouldn’t give me more boiled onions, of which I was very\r\nfond; the blood flowed freely, and she was terrified lest I would bleed\r\nto death, and she be hung; she dressed the wounds most tenderly, and\r\ngave me plenty of onions and sugar, and warmly coaxed me not to tell\r\nfather when he came to tea, lest he would gently chide her for her\r\nlaceration of the skull of the prolific brain of the darling son who\r\nbore his own father’s promising name of Stephen; and for many days she\r\ngave me candy and peanuts, and gave me so many onions that I have\r\nloathed them since; she even poulticed my lacerated head with boiled\r\nonions, which I smell to this day; I had the ear-ache, and she even put\r\na small roast onion in my ear to check the pain; I once passed through\r\nWeathersfield, (where onions are as thick as leaves in the Vale of\r\nVallambrosa,) whose atmosphere caused me to fertilize its streets with\r\nbile; my step-mother finally stops my supplies of sweetmeats, and I\r\nthreaten to tell my father of her violent blow, and show him my scars,\r\nwhen she surrendered, and gave me sweet things for a long period; and\r\nshe saved me many a whipping from my father, when I was mischievous,\r\nlest I would tell and show the relics of her trouncing, which gave me a\r\nboundless latitude for pranks until the scars all passed away; at this\r\ntime, my dog Watch was drowned, but he rose the ninth day, and I buried\r\nhim at the foot of my father’s garden, with funeral honors, a\r\nneighboring dog, in traces, bearing his precious body to the grave, over\r\nwhich I placed turf and stones in memory of a dog I dearly loved; after\r\nthe funeral, Cornelius Snow, nicknamed Flop, called me names, and I told\r\nmy father that “Flop Snow had called me names, and I meant to lick him\r\nfor it,” when my father effected a reconciliation, by allowing Cornelius\r\nto call me Steve as long as I called him Flop. He had long been at the\r\nhead of my class, at school, and I had never been at the head, which\r\nmortified my father, who told me if I would get above Flop through good\r\nspelling, he would give me a sixpence; I tried long and hard, but I\r\ncouldn’t do it; so, on a very stormy day, while myself and Flop were the\r\nonly boys of our spelling class at school, I told him that if he would\r\nmake a mistake in spelling, and let me keep at the head until school was\r\nover, I would give him three cents; Flop consented, and broke down on\r\nbeef, which he spelled _b-e-a-p-h-f-e_, for which the teacher boxed his\r\nears, and made him see ten thousand sparkling stars; I got sixpence from\r\nmy father, and gave Flop half of it; there was a full class the next\r\nday, and down I went to the foot, my usual place; my father learned of\r\nmy collusion with Flop, and gave me a tremendous whipping; the next day\r\nI went several miles down Providence river, in a canoe with Elias Smith\r\nand Joseph Fuller, and was gone four days, and all the town was terribly\r\nexcited lest we were lost; but Mr. Proud, a neighbor, of whose peaches\r\nand melons I was very fond, stuck to it like beeswax, that I would never\r\nbe drowned, while hemp grew in Kentucky; the day after my return, my\r\nstep-mother whips Albert for stealing a small lump of sugar, at about\r\n11, A. M.; father usually came to dinner at 12, M.; Ally cried for a\r\nlong time; but he began to lull, and I was afraid he wouldn’t hold out\r\nuntil father got home; so, I got Ally down cellar, and pinched him, and\r\npulled his hair, to make him keep it up, until father got home; it being\r\nnear twelve o’clock, and my step-mother knowing my influence over Ally,\r\ntold me if I would pacify him before father came to dinner, she would\r\ngive me as much sugar as I wanted for a whole week; I accepted the\r\nbribe,—but Al overheard us, and declared that he would cry like thunder,\r\nuntil father came, if I didn’t give him half the sugar; we finally\r\ncompromised, by allowing Ally a quarter of all the lumps I got; a few\r\ndays after, while returning from a Saturday excursion down the river, my\r\nbrother Bill cut up so, that the boat capsized, in very deep water, a\r\nshort distance from the shore; Jim Baker and myself got on the bottom of\r\nthe boat, while Bill’s feet and head were entangled in the ropes and\r\nsail; Sam Thurber and others swam to the shore; Jim Baker and myself\r\ncouldn’t swim, and we expected to be lost; and we bellowed murder like\r\nfury; amid this awful scene, the owner of the boat came down the shore,\r\nand cried: “Pay for that boat, you rascals, pay for that boat;” he had\r\nscarcely breathed these brutal words, when down went Jim Baker and\r\nmyself to the river’s bed; I rose to the surface first, and went down\r\nagain, when Jim grabbed my leg, and we came up together, and a noble\r\nsailor seized and bore us to the shore, where we were put in barrels,\r\nand pints of water squeezed out of us; Jim and myself open our dewy\r\neyes, shake hands, and walk home arm in arm, with the sailor behind,\r\nthrashing the boat proprietor for demanding pay, instead of coming to\r\nour rescue, whose unparalleled inhumanity the gallant tar couldn’t\r\ntolerate. I went to bed, and had a horrid night-mare, and dreamed of\r\nsharks and whales. On the day after the boat calamity of Jim Baker and\r\nmyself on Providence river, I arose with the glorious sun, ate a spare\r\nrepast, and went to school. My stomach yet complained of salt water, and\r\nmy head and books were at rapiers’ points. The teacher, SHAW, vainly\r\nchides me for my indolence, and summons me before him, and demands my\r\nspelling-book, and gives me _genuine_, which I spell “_gen-ner-wine_.”\r\nThe school is convulsed in the wildest screams. Shaw seizes his\r\nlignumvitae ruler, darts through the aisles, rolls his big gray eyes,\r\nand bangs the desks until the dust rises into clouds, when the mirthful\r\ntumult is hushed into the silence of a tomb, and he bids me take my\r\nseat, with furious cuffs of both ears. My brother Bill had been\r\nsnickering in his hat, and sleeve, and handkerchief, until he had\r\nsaturated them all with his hilarious tears, and, as I passed him on my\r\nway to my seat, he burst into a _genuine_ Branch laugh, and all again\r\nwas chaos. The scholars were more uproarious than before, and Shaw rages\r\nfuriously, and calls up Bill, when all is silent terror, and every eye\r\nis riveted on its book. Shaw demands Bill to extend his right hand,\r\nwhich he declines to do, because he has a felon, and tender warts all\r\nover his knuckles. Shaw then commands him to hold up his left hand, and\r\nBill obeys, when Shaw’s eyes flash sparks of fire, his cheeks are\r\ndeathly pale, and his ferule descends with tremendous violence\r\n\r\n                      On the vacant air,\r\n                      As Bill’s hand wan’t there!\r\n\r\nThe scholars roar again, and clap their little hands, and stamp their\r\nfeet in the wildest ecstacy, when Shaw bellows like a rabid bull, and\r\ngesticulates fatality to the rebellious scholars, whose eyes fall\r\nquickly on their books, and all violently move their pallid lips, with\r\npretense of study, while a terrible revenge rankles in their hearts, for\r\nShaw’s cruel treatment of Bill, who has so many warts and a felon, with\r\nsalt water still gurgling in his ocean belly. At Shaw’s wrathful behest,\r\nBill again raises his trembling hand, and keeps his eye fastened on\r\nShaw’s; and as the ruler nears his palm, he dodges, when Shaw flies to\r\nhis scholastic throne for his cow-skin, and descends his ramparts with\r\nthe pomposity of a king, calmly surveying his juvenile and affrighted\r\nsubjects, and directs Bill to remove his jacket, who firmly declines.\r\nShaw seizes him, and Bill cries murder; the girls weep and faint, and\r\nwater is sprinkled on their cheeks and foreheads; the boys shake their\r\nfists, and dare each other to rush to Bill’s rescue, but Shaw threatens\r\nthem with utter annihilation if they interfere, and the belligerent and\r\naffrighted boys leave poor Bill to his unhappy fate.—Fortunately for\r\nBill, Shaw is short, and of very slender mould. Bill is stout, knows\r\nwell the physical weakness of his adversary, and proves himself fully\r\nequal to the awful crisis before him. For, while Shaw strives to get\r\nBill across his knees to switch and spank him, Bill, by a sudden and\r\nvery elastic movement, gets between, and coils himself, like a snake,\r\naround Shaw’s legs, and pinches, and bites, and tears his pants, and\r\nfinally trips him, and down they go, with Bill on Shaw, and with both\r\nhands so firmly and desperately clenched in Shaw’s white cravat, as to\r\nmake his tongue protrude. The girls faintly titter, while the stoutest\r\nand bravest boys bang their desks, and wildly shout with joy. The\r\npanting combatants spring to the floor, and, like two roosters, have a\r\nmoment’s respite; Shaw is pale, and trembles with shame, and relents,\r\nand in feeble and broken accents, directs Bill to take his seat; the\r\nsilence of a Capulet pervades the school, when my tremendous horse laugh\r\nbreaks the calm; the scholars scream again with frantic contortions;\r\nShaw’s eyes roll like a demon’s, and his voice rises high above the\r\nuniversal clamor, which slowly subsides, and all is still again; Shaw\r\nthen comes on tiptoe to my desk, and grabs and drags me to the aisle,\r\nwith one hand clutched in my throat, and the other in my long hair, when\r\nI grab him in a tender spot, and make him squeal; and so severe and\r\nunrelenting is my grasp, that he gladly gives freedom to my throat and\r\nhair, and implores, in tones of excruciating agony, to release my hands.\r\nI slowly do so, when he re-seizes me, and, dragging me several feet by\r\nmy hair, kicks away the scuttle, and casts me headlong beneath the\r\nschoolhouse, closing the scuttle over me; I can hardly sit upright in my\r\nnew abode; all is darkness; I smell the awful perfume of a dead skunk;\r\nlittle mice squeal, and run over me, and nibble at my mouth and nose,\r\nand big and hungry rats approach, and violently attack me, which I keep\r\nat bay with my feet and hands, and hideous yells, and they finally\r\nscamper to their holes, while a myriad of mice remain to torment me; I\r\nchew tobacco, to drown my abject sorrow; it is the first cud that ever\r\ngraced my mouth; I cover it with the fragment of a newspaper, to prevent\r\nmy giddy exhiliration through a too strong taste of tobacco; I soon got\r\ndeathly sick, and thump and scream for Shaw to let me out, who heeds not\r\nmy piteous cries; I am desperate, and resting my hands and feet on the\r\nground, I get an irresistible purchase, and with a mighty movement of my\r\nback, I burst the scuttle with a tremendous crash, and dart from my\r\nnarrow and dreary cavern into the schoolroom, and run down the aisle,\r\nvomiting at every step; the scholars are nearly gone; as I approach the\r\ndoor, Shaw grabs me, when I belch the purest bile plump in his face,\r\nwhich, of course, was purely accidental; Shaw is blinded with tobacco\r\nbile, and wipes his cheeks, and nose, and mouth, and eyes, and commands\r\nme to go to his desk; I refuse; he then expostulates, and breathes kind\r\nwords, which allay my anger, and check the flow of tobacco and salt\r\nwater bile; I go to his desk; he dismisses the few scholars that remain,\r\nsave my weeping brother Bill, curled in the corner; Shaw laments the sad\r\noccurrence; hopes we will be better boys, and permits us to go home; on\r\nour arrival, father is at tea, listening to brother Albert’s version of\r\nthe story; Bill and myself seat ourselves at table, when father directs\r\neach to give his melancholy narrative; Bill is hungry, and slowly\r\nbegins, and lacks vivacity, and the impatient father turns to me for the\r\nrapid and vivid analysis of the horrid scholastic anarchy and rencontre\r\nthen flying on exaggeration’s wide-spread wings, and distracting the\r\npeaceful firesides of Providence; I swallow the delicious food already\r\nin my mouth; cleanse my throat with a prolonged swallow of commingled\r\ntea and sugar, and tell my story in a nervous strain; my father’s eyes\r\nare large, and fixed on mine, throughout my exciting narrative, at whose\r\nclose, he gets his hat and cane and autumnal mantle, and bids myself and\r\nBill to follow him; we penetrate the pitchy darkness, and after varied\r\nstreet meanderings in the turbulent and piercing evening winds, we\r\nascend the steps, and tap at the door of Shaw; we enter his pale\r\npresence, who is extremely courteous to father, who is a member of the\r\nVisiting School Committee, and invested with power of a teacher’s\r\ndismissal, which Shaw now fears; father opens his deadly batteries, and\r\nShaw, perceiving no possible escape, pleads extenuation for the violent\r\ntemper that nature gave him; spoke of William as a very good and\r\nstudious boy, (a truth,) and of Stephen as a meritorious and\r\nenthusiastic youth, who dearly loved his books, (a lie,) and deeply\r\nregretted that his heated passion led him to the chastisement of\r\nWilliam, and the incarceration of Stephen; and declared in tones of warm\r\nsincerity, that if father would forgive him, he would never whip nor\r\nimprison us again, but lead us up the hill of science through gentle and\r\npersuasive means; father pities and admires his humility, and, rising to\r\ndepart, directs Shaw to inform him every Friday by letter, how many days\r\nWilliam and Stephen have played the truant during the week, and with\r\nwhat facility we recite our lessons, and what our general conduct is;\r\nShaw’s eyes flash joy at these delightful and magnanimous behests, while\r\nthe eyes of Bill and myself flash guilt and fury at Shaw’s apparent\r\nconquest, because all our future sport is spoiled, and mine, especially,\r\nas I played truant about twice a week, and Bill once a month; and\r\nbecause I seldom got my lessons well; Shaw and father extend their\r\nhands, and shake a warm good night: and while they linger at the outer\r\ndoor in friendly conversation, I slyly crawl through father’s legs, to\r\nget into the street as soon as possible, and away from Shaw’s victorious\r\npresence; the last shake of hands transpire between father and Shaw, who\r\nslowly closes the door with a beatific smile; father, myself, and Bill\r\nmuffle ourselves in our fervent garments; it snows and blows very hard;\r\nand, as we walk slowly homeward against the snow and wind, father\r\ndelivers an affectionate and mournful lecture, gently chiding us for the\r\ntrouble we had caused him, and the rapid increase of his snowy locks;\r\nkindly warning us that we were constantly exposed to the sad fate of\r\norphans, our tender mother being already gone forever; and with a\r\ntrembling voice implored us to be good boys, to study hard, to be kind\r\nand obedient to Mr. Shaw, to cultivate manly virtues, and strive to\r\nbecome intellectual giants, and the pillars of our country, in peace or\r\nwar, after the fathers of his generation had passed from the field of\r\naction. We both wept bitterly, and besought our dear and indulgent\r\nfather to forgive the past, with assurances of our efforts to please him\r\nand our teacher in the future. We reach home, and father kindles a\r\ncrackling, hickory fire, and gives us cider and walnuts, and tells us\r\npretty stories, and puts on extra bed clothes, because the night is so\r\npiercing cold, and tucks our bed at the sides, to keep out the biting\r\nair, and then directs us to clasp and raise our little hands to God, and\r\nsay after him our evening prayer of\r\n\r\n                   “Now I lay me down to sleep,\r\n                   I pray the Lord my soul to keep,\r\n                   If I should die before I wake,\r\n                   I pray the Lord my soul to take;”\r\n\r\nand then gives us a parting kiss, and pats our little foreheads, and\r\nbreathes sweet tones of affection until he passes from our view. Bill\r\nand myself make good resolves for the future, and breathe a fond “good\r\nnight!” and then embrace the tranquil slumber and innocent dreams of\r\nearly boyhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                        Office—114 Nassau Street\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                             THE ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                New York, Saturday, September 25, 1858.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 The Alligator Lives for Another Week.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ladies have saved the ALLIGATOR for six days more, in which God made\r\nthe gorgeous realms of infinitude! Last week, I proclaimed that unless\r\nadvance subscribers or patriots came to the rescue of the wounded and\r\nbleeding ALLIGATOR, he must soon expire amid the tumultuous exultations\r\nof his proscriptive adversaries. The gentlemen responded in companies,\r\nbut the ladies in battalions, and soothed and rescued the poor ALLIGATOR\r\nfrom the jaws of immediate death.[1] Without the sympathy of woman, man\r\nsoon droops, and totters, and expires. Woman is the prolific source of\r\nall that glorifies the cottages, and mansions, and palaces of the globe.\r\nAnd her benevolence ameliorates the poor, and oppressed, and\r\ndisconsolate in every region of the earth. From Eve to Mary, the mother\r\nof Washington, the history of woman is a brilliant constellation.\r\nWithout the pure and patriotic Mary, there would have been no\r\nWashington,—and without Washington, the Americans would have had no\r\ncountry, and the oppressed of all lands no asylum of liberty and\r\nprosperity. In the sacred bosom of her family, woman is like the queen\r\nof night amid the pretty stars. In our infant years, she nourishes, and\r\nshields, and cheers us in our precarious journey to maturer years. She\r\nimparts the first kiss, and moulds the first prayer, and is prouder of\r\nher offspring than a queen of her throne. As the child buds, and blooms,\r\nand blossoms, and ascends the hill of moral and scholastic science, she\r\nwatches every pace with breathless solicitude. And in penury or\r\naffluence, in bondage or freedom, in power or on the scaffold, she\r\nclings with intense affection to the adored objects of her creation.\r\nEvery family is a dominion. The father is a king, and the mother a\r\nqueen, and the children their subjects. The same laws govern a family as\r\na kingdom. Judicious penalties follow disobedience, and a good mother\r\nimbues the heart and mind of her offspring with humanity and wisdom that\r\ngovern the world. And over all presides a Being of beneficence and\r\nubiquity, who wields the destinies of a Universe. Woman, under God, is\r\nthe source of all that cheers and ennobles man in his weary pilgrimage\r\nfrom the cradle to the grave, and to her sympathies am I greatly\r\nindebted for my recent liberation from captivity and the partial\r\nresurrection of my declining fortunes. God bless her, then, and in my\r\nsacred orisons and soliloquies, on land or ocean, I will ever cherish\r\nher with those grateful emotions that I inherited from the genial heart\r\nof my departed mother.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  If the ALLIGATOR dies, advance subscriptions will immediately be\r\n  returned to my generous patrons, with my fervent wishes for their\r\n  prosperity.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MACRAE is the only person authorised to collect subscriptions\r\nfor the “_Alligator_.” And here is his likeness, that when he calls to\r\nsolicit subscribers, all may know him by a comparison of this accurate\r\nengraving with his living face.

The remains of\r\nthe lightning philosopher are deposited there in the old burial ground\r\nbelonging to Christ Church. An appropriate monument has been\r\naccidentally reared above them, in the shape of a telegraphic post, and\r\nthe lightning is at constant play over, if not under the eye of the man\r\nwho first chained it to the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Stephen and his Adult Pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FIRST LESSON.\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—What do you first wish to learn?\r\n\r\n_Pupil._—I desire first to review my figures.\r\n\r\n_S._—How far have you cyphered?\r\n\r\n_P._—I went through the book several times, when I was a boy.\r\n\r\n_S._—Whose Arithmetic did you study?\r\n\r\n_P._—Mr. Dollbay’s.\r\n\r\n_S._—Daboll’s, I suppose, you mean.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes, it was Daboll’s; and I remember him very well. He was a\r\nfine man, and understood figures very well.\r\n\r\n_S._—Then you went through his book several times?\r\n\r\n_P._—O yes, I can take my oath of that.\r\n\r\n_S._—How much is twice nothing?\r\n\r\n_P._—That is two, of course.\r\n\r\n_S._—How much is nothing times two?\r\n\r\n_P._—That is two.\r\n\r\n_S._—How much is one-half times one?\r\n\r\n_P._—One.\r\n\r\n_S._—How much is four and a-half times four and a-half?\r\n\r\n_P._ (scratching his head)—That must be about thirteen.\r\n\r\n_S._—How much is three-quarters times five-eights?\r\n\r\n_P._—I never saw that in Daboll, and to be candid, Mr. Branch, I have\r\nlong been accustomed to rush of blood to the head, and I had a slight\r\nrush just now, and I guess I won’t go any farther in figures to-day; but\r\nI would like to renew my Grammar studies.\r\n\r\n_S._—Very well: whose Grammar did you study in boyhood?\r\n\r\n_P._—Mr. Murphy’s.\r\n\r\n_S._—I presume you mean Lindley Murray’s?\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes, it was Murray’s, and he once dined at my father’s.\r\n\r\n_S._—As it is absolutely essential to understand spelling, before\r\nGrammar, I will first examine you in a few words, before we embark in\r\nGrammar. Can you spell well, sir?\r\n\r\n_P._—Yes; and I hope you don’t mean to insult me with such a question.\r\n\r\n_S._—Certainly not. Spell Grammar?\r\n\r\n_P._—Gramer.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—Gramar.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—How do yau spell it, then?\r\n\r\n_S._—Grammar.\r\n\r\n_P._—That’s the way I spelt it.\r\n\r\n_S._—No, sir.\r\n\r\n_P._—If I didd’t, I intended to.\r\n\r\n_S._—That may be. Spell sloop?\r\n\r\n_P._—Slupe.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—That’s the way old Captain Tallman spelt it, when I was a boy.\r\n\r\n_S._—It is spelt sloop in these days.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes, that’s correct, I remember.\r\n\r\n_S._—Spell dough?\r\n\r\n_P._—Doe.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—My grandmother used to spell it so.\r\n\r\n_S._—It is spelt dough.\r\n\r\n_S._—Spell God?\r\n\r\n_P._—Gorde.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._ (is silent for some seconds, and grows pale, and sweats\r\nprofusely)—Merciful Heaven! And do you say Gorde is incorrect?\r\n\r\n_S._—I do. It is spelt God.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes, I was mistaken. That’s the way I have always spelt it.\r\n\r\n_S._—Spell scholar?\r\n\r\n_P._—Skoller.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—Skollar.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—That’s the way I always spelt it, and I’ll bet a dollar that’s the\r\nway to spell it.\r\n\r\n_S._—That’s a bet.\r\n\r\n_P._—How shall we decide it?\r\n\r\n_S._—Have you got a dictionary?\r\n\r\n_P._—Yes. (Examines it.) Well, I declare, you have won the dollar. What\r\na curious way to spell scholar, to put _ch_ for _k_. Mr. Branch: who\r\ninvented language?\r\n\r\n_S._—The Egyptians.\r\n\r\n_P._—What old fools they must have been?\r\n\r\n_S._—Those Egyptians who discovered the alphabet, were the wisest\r\nlinguists of the human race. And those Arabians who discovered the\r\ndigits, were the profoundest mathematicians. And, as you can neither\r\nspell nor cypher well, I advise you to defer your arithmetic and grammar\r\nlessons until you learn orthography.\r\n\r\n_P._—I don’t know what you mean by linguist, nor by digits. And what on\r\nearth do you mean by orthography?\r\n\r\n_S._—Orthography means spelling.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes, I thought that was it. Now, Mr. Branch, I am in public\r\nlife, as you know, and I am very anxious to make a good speech and write\r\na good letter; and, in order to do that, I must understand Grammar. And\r\nI think I can spell well enough to study Grammar, Mr. Branch. You have\r\nonly examined me in a few words, and because I slightly broke down on\r\nthem, you must not suppose that I can’t spell well enough to study\r\nGrammar. Just try me in a few more words.\r\n\r\n_S._—Spell alderman?\r\n\r\n_P._—Oldermon.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—Olldermone.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—How, then?\r\n\r\n_S._—Alderman.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes. That’s the way I was just agoing to spell it.\r\n\r\n_S._—Spell Common Council?\r\n\r\n_P._—Komon Kounsil.\r\n\r\n_S._—No, sir. It is spelt Common Council.\r\n\r\n_P._—Is it possible?\r\n\r\n_S._—Yes. And now spell municipal?\r\n\r\n_P._—Dam if I don’t give that up; for, although I have been a member of\r\nthe municiple government, I nover could spell that awful word without\r\nlooking at the dictionary two or three times; and it always took me a\r\nmighty long time to find municiple, even in the dictionary. Now, do try\r\nme on some easier word than that,—won’t you, Mr. Branch?\r\n\r\n_S._—Spell Mayor?\r\n\r\n_P._—Mare.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—How, then?\r\n\r\n_S._—Mayor.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes,—I forgot. That’s it exactly.\r\n\r\n_S._—Spell contracts?\r\n\r\n_P._—I can spell that fast enough. Kontrax.\r\n\r\n_S._—No.\r\n\r\n_P._—Kontracks.\r\n\r\n_S._—No. It is spelt contracts.\r\n\r\n_P._—I begin to think my memory is getting bad, for I once could spell\r\nall these words. And I have had so many contracts from the Corporation,\r\nand have written that word so often, that I am sure I used to spell it\r\ncorrectly. Now give me one more easy word, and if I break down, dam if I\r\ndon’t surrender.\r\n\r\n_S._—Spell Cable?\r\n\r\n_P._—I have got a few shares in that precious stock, and I’ll bet $5 I\r\ncan spell it correctly.\r\n\r\n_S._—Done.\r\n\r\n_P._—Kabell.\r\n\r\n_S._—No. It is spelt cable.\r\n\r\n_P._—There’s a V. And now, although I have spelt several words\r\nincorrectly, yet, as I am growing old, I desire to learn as fast as\r\npossible; and I want you to give me grammar lessons and teach me\r\nspelling at the same time. And if you will learn me very fast, I will\r\nlet you have one share in the Atlantic Cable, for your instructions.\r\n\r\n_S._—I would rather have the cash, as I cannot believe that a cord about\r\nthe circumference of my thumb can permanently connect the hemispheres.\r\n\r\n_P._—Very well, sir. I have perfect confidence in the Cable enterprise,\r\nand I don’t care about parting with my stock. So I will pay you in cash\r\nfor your tuition. Now please give me a lesson in grammar.\r\n\r\n_S._—Well, I will strive to gratify you,—although I again assure you,\r\nthat orthography is the basis of grammar, and we shall encounter ruinous\r\nobstacles in the construction of the grammatical pyramid, in the absence\r\nof orthography and orthœpy.\r\n\r\n_P._—For the land’s sake, what is the meaning of the last word?\r\n\r\n_S._—Orthœpy means pronunciation.\r\n\r\n_P._—How queer your jaw opens and closes, when you pronounce that\r\nstrange word.\r\n\r\n_S._—I suppose so. I will now give you the first lesson in grammar.\r\n\r\n_P._—Let me first take a good stiff horn of brandy to brace my nerves.\r\n(Drinks.) Now, sir, I am ready for Grammar, which, I repeat, I studied\r\nwhen a boy; and I only desire to review what I know already.\r\n\r\n_S._—How many parts of speech are there?\r\n\r\n_P._—What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\n_S._—I mean, into how many parts of speech is language divided?\r\n\r\n_P._—Well, by golly, I don’t know exactly,—but, from the immense number\r\nof words in the Bible, and in all the books at the Harpers, and in the\r\nHistorical Society, and in all the newspapers, I should think there must\r\nbe, at the lowest calculation, about five hundred million parts of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n_S._—There are only nine parts of speech.\r\n\r\n_P._—I begin to think you are crazy; for, do you think you can humbug me\r\nby saying that there are only nine different words, or parts of speech,\r\nin the English language? I shall consider it to be my duty to have you\r\nput in the Lunatic Asylum, if you talk in that way.\r\n\r\n_S._—I still assert that there are only nine parts of speech, which are:\r\na noun, article, adjective, pronoun, verb, adverb, preposition,\r\nconjunction, and interjection.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes, I recollect.\r\n\r\n_S._—Well, what part of speech is iron?\r\n\r\n_P._—As near as I can recollect, iron is the seventh, and it may\r\npossibly be the ninth part of speech.\r\n\r\n_S._—No, sir,—it is one of the nine parts of speech I just mentioned.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes, excuse me,—I understand. Well, iron must be a conjunction,\r\nbecause it can be heated and spliced.\r\n\r\n_S._—Iron is a noun.\r\n\r\n_P._—Ah, yes, I recollect perfectly well that iron is a noun, and I am\r\nsurprised that I did not remember it, as I have long dealt in fron, and\r\nknow all about it.\r\n\r\n_S._—That will do for to-day, and I will resume your grammar lessons\r\nto-morrow. Good day, sir.\r\n\r\n_P._—Good day. I am much pleased wite my progress in grammar, and I will\r\nsee you again to-morrow with much pleasure. Good day, sir.\r\n\r\n                                                            [_Exeunt_,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Stephen H.

Tiemann, Simeon Draper, and Isaac Bell,\r\nJr.\r\n\r\n_Father._—What is the period of your imprisonment?\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—One year. I think I have seen you before. What is your name,\r\nsir?\r\n\r\n_Father._—H——d.\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Where do you reside?\r\n\r\n_Father._—In Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Ah! The dearest associations of my life are connected with\r\ntwo students bearing your name, who were from Charleston.\r\n\r\n_Father._—My wife and children: I think the keeper has directed us to\r\nthe Lunatic Asylum, instead of the abode of convicts. Let us go and ask\r\nthe keeper to show us to the prison.\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Stop, sir. I now most positively discern the relics of your\r\nearly features. Were you a student at Cambridge in 1835?\r\n\r\n_Father._—I was.\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—And your brother also, who was rescued from a watery grave in\r\nBoston Harbor?\r\n\r\n_Father_ (_leans against the iron door, and his frame trembles, and his\r\nface assumes a deathly palor_).—God of Heaven! And are you the son of\r\nJudge Stephen Branch, of Providence, Rhode Island?\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—I am, sir.\r\n\r\n_Father_ (_wiping sweat from his forehead and tears from his\r\ncheeks_).—Dear Stephen: Give me your hand, after our long separation.\r\nAlas! my poor brother is dead, whose life you saved in that dreadful\r\nsquall, in Boston Harbor, twenty-three years ago. (_All weep, and his\r\neldest daughter sobs aloud._)\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Where and when did your noble brother die?\r\n\r\n_Father._—In Switzerland, ten years since; and in his last days he spoke\r\nmost kindly of you.\r\n\r\n_His Wife_ (_in profuse tears_).—Have you a wife, Mr. Branch?\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Neither wife, nor child, nor parents, nor hardly a relative\r\non earth. And I am glad they have gone down to their happy graves. And I\r\nalmost wish that I was reposing by their side. The earth is no place for\r\nme, nor for those who expose the licentious officials and plundering\r\nmonsters of this age, who allure spotless females into the horrors of\r\nprostitution, and drive the friendless masses into cellars and attics\r\nand crowded and pestilential habitations, and into the inclement\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Wife._—But why rejoice over the eternal departure of nearly all your\r\nkindred?\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Because it would have blighted their health and fondest hopes\r\nto have beheld me in a felon’s dungeon.\r\n\r\n_Wife._—But you have committed no crime?\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—I could not do that. And I am in prison, because I have\r\nexposed the crimes, and resisted the gilded bribes of official\r\nplunderers for a dozen years, and utterly refused to join them in their\r\nvarious deeds of infamy. I could have been affluent, and had my liberty,\r\nif I had joined the public thieves, and shared their plunder. And if my\r\nparents were alive, although they would rejoice at my exposure of\r\nvicious public men, yet they would weep over the cruelty of those who\r\nconsigned me to this dungeon, without an honorable trial, and rudely\r\nthrust me into the chain-gang of the quarries, and even yearn for my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n_Wife._—Yours seems a hard fate?\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Yes; mine is indeed a mournful destiny.\r\n\r\n_Her Eldest Daughter_ (_whose lovely eyes gleam with tears_).—I weep\r\nover your misfortunes. I have often heard my dear uncle, whose life you\r\nsaved at the peril of your own, speak of you in tones of deep affection,\r\nand here is a diamond breastpin he gave me in Switzerland, on the Lake\r\nof Geneva, on a tranquil moonlight evening, only ten days before his\r\nsoul’s departure for the spirit realms. Take it, dear Mr. Branch, and\r\nkeep it in remembrance of his affectionate niece. To no other being\r\nwould I present a sacred gift of my departed uncle.\r\n\r\n_Stephen_ (_with overwhelming emotion_).—Please accept my profoundest\r\ngratitude for your precious donation, which I will wear near a heart\r\nthat dearly loved your departed uncle, with whom I passed some of the\r\nhappiest hours of my life.\r\n\r\n_The Youngest Daughter_ (_who is about ten years old_).—Dear Mr. Branch:\r\nWill you take this sweet rose from me, and let me kiss you through the\r\ngrate?\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—O God! This is too much for my poor nerves. (_I shed copious\r\ntears, and all weep._) Yes, my pretty little girl, you can kiss me\r\nthrough the grate. (_And her father holds her up, and I place my pale,\r\nand cold, and haggard cheek to a perforation of my cell door, and this\r\naffectionate little girl imprints a fervent kiss, which I cordially\r\nreciprocate._)\r\n\r\n_Father._—God has blessed me with great prosperity, and I will devote my\r\nfortune to your restoration to liberty.\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Mr. Ashmead, my able and faithful Counsel, assures me that I\r\nwill soon emerge from prison, through the Supreme Judiciary. I most\r\nsincerely thank you for your extraordinary generosity, and for the visit\r\nof yourself and wife, and daughters, whom I will cherish all my days.\r\n\r\n_Father._—When you obtain your liberty, you must come to Charleston,\r\nwhere you will be received with our warmest hospitality.\r\n\r\n_Wife._—If you come, you shall never leave us.\r\n\r\n_Eldest Daughter._—You shall have the vacant seat of my uncle at our\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n_Youngest Daughter._—Yes; and I will kiss you again—won’t I mother?—when\r\nyou come to Charleston.\r\n\r\n_Mother._—Yes, my dear child; and you shall give him the sweetest rose\r\nin our garden.\r\n\r\n_Youngest Daughter._—That I will, and pretty flowers, too.\r\n\r\n_Father._—Good by, Mr. Branch. (_Strives to get his hand through the\r\nperforated door, but can clasp my fingers with but two of his._) Good\r\nby, sir—good by.\r\n\r\n_Wife._—Good by, Mr. Branch. I hope you will be restored to freedom.\r\n\r\n_Eldest Daughter._—Good by, Mr. Branch. I shall think of you with\r\nkindness, after I am gone, and I shall yearn to see you at our home in\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n_Youngest Daughter._—Good by, dear Mr. Branch, and I want you to give me\r\nanother kiss before I go. (_I kiss her, and receive many in return._)\r\nGood by, and you must not forget to come to Charleston, when these bad\r\nmen let you out of prison. Good by, dear Mr. Branch, and I hope you will\r\nnot be lonely and cry much after we have gone far away from you. Good\r\nby, Mr. Branch.\r\n\r\n_Stephen._—Farewell, kind friends, and may God ever bless you for your\r\nnoble sympathy.

I think they bore\r\nthe Christian name of a lady. I am no poet, and do not know their merit.\r\nPerhaps Bryant or Prentrice can discern their beauties. Let pure and\r\npensive and wild enthusiasts scan them for congenial spirits, and I\r\nthink they will preserve these curious meditations which have been in my\r\nscrap-book since I was a pale youth, with my classic satchel, in the\r\nschools of Rhode Island. Those editors who copy these lines must not\r\ncredit them to STEPHEN H.

Tell us—why are we chained to earth?\r\n       ’Tis far too gross for the immortal mind,\r\n       Which yearns for higher realms, and pants in vain\r\n       For the full measure of perfection. Oh!\r\n       I have gazed upon night’s starry volume,\r\n       Till I have read long lessons of delight,\r\n       And drank the raptures of another world.\r\n       Thought, living thought, burns to embrace the whole\r\n       Of those deep mysteries eternity\r\n       Conceals from mortal understanding; and\r\n       The mind speaks out, and questions every beam\r\n       Which falls from the bright reservoir of heaven—\r\n       Interrogates each plant and breathing thing—\r\n       Retires within itself, and calls up every\r\n       Faculty—sends powerful fancy forth to\r\n       Search through untrod regions, but spends its pow’rs\r\n       Unsatisfied, till it sinks down at last\r\n       Exhausted by its own intensity.\r\n\r\n         O for a walk among those stars of light,\r\n       Where grandeur fills immensity! I long\r\n       To fling my soul upon the pinions of\r\n       Eternity, and revel in the blaze\r\n       Of glory unrevealed—to gaze upon\r\n       The light that emanates from God’s vast throne,\r\n       And hear the music of the rolling spheres\r\n       As they revolve in mystic circles round\r\n       The deep centre of unknown attraction.\r\n       Spirits of heaven are hov’ring round me,\r\n       And breathe sweet songs of rapture in my ear.\r\n       The rustle of their wings is like the sigh\r\n       Of leaves, when the soft zephyr moves among\r\n       Their quiv’ring branches. Their hallowed voices\r\n       Wake the eternity within me, and warm\r\n       Aspirations rise from my heart’s altar\r\n       To the great throne of Uncreated Power,\r\n       The wings of seraphim seem wafting me\r\n       In thought far through the bright and boundless ether.\r\n       O for the freedom of unbodied life!\r\n       To rove where thought ne’er ventured—where fancy\r\n       Halts, her swift wing wearied in its lofty flight.\r\n\r\n         I gaze upon the stars, and drink the full\r\n       Glory of the midnight heavens—and breathe\r\n       The breath of spiritual existence\r\n       Till my soul beats, like a captive bird,\r\n       Against its prison grates, and longs to soar away, and mix\r\n       With immortality.\r\n\r\n                         Are not the stars\r\n       Immortal? Do they not live forever\r\n       In a joy of light? Have they not looked down\r\n       From age to age upon this distant world\r\n       And watched its evolutions? Viewed its face\r\n       Change beneath the whelming flood—its cities\r\n       Sink beneath the earthquake’s shock—its mountains\r\n       Belch destruction—its boasted empires fall—\r\n       Its armies crushed in battle—its proud kings\r\n       Fade from earth—its ancient monumental\r\n       Grandeur crumble into dust? Yet they roll on,\r\n       Creatures of life, a beaming essence,\r\n       A mysterious throng of heavenly\r\n       Pageantry. But is there not a region\r\n       Far above that envious height; above\r\n       The stars; where beings live forever, and\r\n       No darkness comes; where light exists for ages,\r\n       Unborrowed from the sun; where storms dim not\r\n       Its brightness? and where rapture never dies?\r\n       Yes, far above the sky-bound ceiling, there\r\n       Is light—eternal light—joy unsubdued,\r\n       And everlasting life!\r\n\r\n                             Is there such a\r\n       Thing as sin? I feel it not. This is a\r\n       Holy hour. Nothing exists to me but\r\n       Heaven, and heaven’s pure habitants; all worldly\r\n       Thoughts are drowned in high communing. Is there\r\n       Such a thing as pain? I know it not, who\r\n       Oft have known it. Heaven’s high-wrought happiness\r\n       Is mine. This is a peaceful hour, and I\r\n       Could deem myself already entered on\r\n       Immortal ground, did not this clog of clay\r\n       Assure me I am yet of earth, and have,\r\n       Perchance, long years of pain, and wo, and sin\r\n       To witness, and the dark vale of death is\r\n       Yet unpassed by me, though ever near. Well,\r\n       If it must be so, welcome the hour that\r\n       Breaks these mortal shackles, and lets loose my\r\n       Spirit on the wings of life, to find its\r\n       Native element and long sought home, if\r\n       Heaven at last be mine. Congenial spirits\r\n       Of unknown existence! would that your forms\r\n       Could be perceived by mortal eyes, that I\r\n       Might hold sweet converse with you, and forget\r\n       That I am mortal.\r\n\r\n                         Oh! there is that\r\n       Within, which tells me I was destined for\r\n       A higher sphere; that heaven was made for me;\r\n       For _all_—if we accept the gift, and mount\r\n       Faith’s ladder, as the word of life directs\r\n       This life is not our destiny; ’tis but\r\n       A prelude to a state eternal, a\r\n       Mere beginning of existence, when once\r\n       Begun, that ne’er shall cease to be. Life! Life!\r\n       What art thou _now_—what art thou doomed to be?\r\n       A shade; a substance; dream; reality;\r\n       A blessing or a curse; a moment here;\r\n       Hereafter an eternity! Dread thought,\r\n       Eternity! Eternity! My soul\r\n       Is lost in that vast subject, and I shrink\r\n       Appalled from the unmeasured time to come.\r\n       No more I ask to know its hidden space;\r\n       ’Twill soon unfold to me, and I shall dwell\r\n       Forever in its changeless realm; no more\r\n       To feel emotions known on earth, or think\r\n       As now I think, or live as now I live;\r\n       ’Till then, “the mysteries of fate are hid,”\r\n       And all lie buried in a world to come.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nA LADY M.
