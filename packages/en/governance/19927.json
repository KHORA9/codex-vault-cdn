When the\r\nColonel, who had been closeted for a few minutes with Madam P--, came\r\nout of the house, we mounted and rode off with the 'corn-cracker.'\r\n\r\nThe native's farm was located on the stream which watered my friend's\r\nplantation, and was about ten miles distant. Taking a by-road which led\r\nto it through the woods, we rode rapidly on in advance of the wagon.\r\n\r\n'Sort o' likely gal, thet, warn't she?' remarked the turpentine-maker,\r\nafter a while.\r\n\r\n'Yes, she was,' replied the Colonel, in a half-abstracted manner,\r\n'_very_ likely.'\r\n\r\n'Kill harself 'case har man war shot by thet han'som overseer uv yourn?'\r\n\r\n'Not altogether for that, I reckon,' replied my host,' I fear the main\r\nreason was her being put at field-work, and abused by the driver.'\r\n\r\n'Thet comes uv not lookin' arter things yerself, Cunnel. I 'tend ter my\r\nniggers parsonally, and they keer a durned sight more fur this world\r\nthen fur kingdom-cum. Ye cudn't hire 'em ter kill 'emselves fur no\r\nprice.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' replied the Colonel, in a low tone, 'I _did_ look after her. I\r\nput her at full field-work myself.'\r\n\r\n'By--!' cried the native, reining his horse to a dead stop, and speaking\r\nin an excited manner; 'I doan't b'lieve it, 'taint 't all like ye; yer a\r\nd--d seceshener--thet comes uv yer bringin'-up; but ye've a soul\r\nbigger'n a meetin'-house, and ye cudn't hev put thet slim, weakly gal\r\ninter th' woods, no how!'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel and I instinctively halted our horses, as the 'corn-cracker'\r\nstopped his.\r\n\r\n'It is true, Barnes,' said my host, in a low voice, 'I _did_ do it!'\r\n\r\n'May God Almighty furgive ye, Cunnel,' said the native, starting his\r\nhorse forward, '_I_ wudn't hev dun it fur all yer niggers, by----.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel made no reply, and we rode on the rest of the way in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe corn-cracker's house--a low, unpainted, wooden building--stood near\r\nthe little stream, and in the centre of a cleared plot of some ten\r\nacres. This plot was surrounded by a post and rail fence, and in its\r\nfront portion was a garden, which grew a sufficient supply of vegetables\r\nto serve a family of twenty persons. In the rear, and at the sides of\r\nthe dwelling, were about seven acres, devoted mainly to corn and\r\npotatoes. In one corner of the lot were three tidy-looking negro-houses,\r\nand close beside them I noticed a low shed, near which a large quantity\r\nof the stalks of the tall, white corn, common to that section, was\r\nstacked in the New-England fashion. Browsing on the corn-stalks were\r\nthree sleek, well-kept milch-cows and a goat.\r\n\r\nAbout four hundred yards from the farmer's house, and on the bank of the\r\nlittle run, which there was quite wide and deep, stood a\r\nturpentine-distillery, and around it were scattered a large number of\r\nrosin and turpentine barrels, some filled and some empty. A short\r\ndistance higher up, and far enough from the 'still' to be safe in the\r\nevent of a fire, was a long, low, wooden shed, covered with rough,\r\nunjointed boards, placed upright, and unbattened. This was the\r\n'spirit-house,' used for the storage of the spirits of turpentine when\r\nbarreled for market, and awaiting shipment. In the creek, and filling\r\nnearly one-half of the channel in front of the spirit-shed, was a raft\r\nof pine-timber, on which were laden some two hundred barrels of rosin.\r\nOn such rude conveyances the turpentine-maker sent his produce to\r\nConwayboro. There the timber-raft was sold to my wayside friend, Captain\r\nB--, and its freight shipped on board vessel for New-York.\r\n\r\nTwo 'prime' negro men, dressed in the usual costume, were 'tending the\r\nstill,' and a negro-woman, as stout and strong as the men, and clad in a\r\nshort, loose, linsey gown, from beneath which peeped out a pair of\r\ncoarse leggins, was adjusting a long wooden trough, which conveyed the\r\nliquid rosin from the 'still' to a deep excavation in the earth, at a\r\nshort distance. In the pit was a quantity of rosin sufficient to fill a\r\nthousand barrels.\r\n\r\n'Here, Bill,' said Barnes to one of the negro men, as we pulled up at\r\nthe distillery, 'put these critters up, and give 'em some oats, and when\r\nthey've cooled off a bit, water 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, yas, massa,' replied the negro, springing nimbly forward, and\r\ntaking the horses by the bridles, 'an' rub 'em down, massa?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, rub 'em down right smart,' replied the corn-cracker; then turning\r\nto me, as we dismounted, he said: 'Stranger, thet's th' sort o' niggers\r\nfur ye; all uv mine ar' jess like him, smart and lively as kittens.'\r\n\r\n'He does seem to go about his work cheerfully,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Cheerfully! d--d ef he doan't--all on 'em du! They like me better'n\r\nthar own young 'uns, an' it's 'case I use 'em like human bein's;' and he\r\nlooked slyly toward the Colonel, who just then was walking silently\r\naway, in the direction of the run, as if in search of the drowned\r\n'chattels.'\r\n\r\n'Not thar, Cunnel,' cried the native, 'they're inter th' shed,' and he\r\nstarted to lead the way to the 'spirit-house.'\r\n\r\n'Not now, Barnes,' I said, putting my hand on his arm, 'leave him alone\r\nfor a little while. He is feeling badly, and we'd better not disturb\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\nThe native motioned me to a seat on a rosin-barrel, as he replied:\r\n\r\n'Wal, he 'pears ter, thet's a fact, and he orter. D--d ef it arn't\r\nwicked to use niggers like cattle, as he do.'\r\n\r\n'I don't think he means to ill-treat them; he's a kind-hearted man.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, he ar' sort o' so; but he's left ev'ry thing ter thet d--d\r\noverseer uv his'n. I wudn't ha' trusted him to feed my hogs.'\r\n\r\n'Hogs!' I exclaimed, laughing; 'I supposed you didn't _feed_ hogs in\r\nthese diggings. I supposed you 'let 'em run.''\r\n\r\n'_I_ doan't; an' I've got th' tallest porkys 'round har.'\r\n\r\n'I've been told that they get a good living in the woods.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, p'raps the' du jest make eout ter live thar; but my ole 'oman\r\nlikes 'em ter hum. They clean up a place like, eat up all th' leavin's,\r\nan' give th' young nigs suthin' ter du.'\r\n\r\n'It seems to me,' I said, resuming the previous thread of the\r\nconversation, 'that overseers are a necessity on a large plantation.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, the' ar', an' thet's why thar ortent ter be no big plantations;\r\nGod Almighty didn't make human bein's ter be herded togethar in th'\r\nwoods. No man orter ter hev more'n twenty on 'em--he can't look arter no\r\nmore himself, an' it's agin natur' ter set a feller over 'em what han't\r\nno int'rest in 'cm, an' no feelin' fur 'em, an' who'll drive 'em round\r\nlike brutes. I never struck one on 'em in my life, an' my ten du more'n\r\nony fifteen th' Cunnel's got.'\r\n\r\n'I thought they needed occasional correction. How do you manage them\r\nwithout whipping?'\r\n\r\n'Manage them! why, 'cordin' ter scriptur'--do ter 'em as I'd like ter be\r\ndun ter, ef I war a nigger. Every one on 'em knows I'd part with my last\r\nshirt, an' live on taters an' cow-fodder, 'fore I'd sell 'em; an' then I\r\ngive 'em Saturdays for 'emselfs; but thet's cute dealin' in me, (tho'\r\nth' pore, simple souls doan't see it,) fur ye knows the' work thet day\r\nfur 'emselfs, an' raise nigh all thar own feed, 'cept th' beef and\r\nwhisky, an' it sort o' makes 'em feel like folks, too, more like as ef\r\nthe' war _free_--the' work th' better fur it all th' week.'\r\n\r\n'Then you think the blacks would work better if free?'\r\n\r\n'In _course_ I does--it's agin man's natur' to be a slave. Thet lousy\r\nparson ye herd ter meetin' a Sunday, makes slavery eout a divine\r\ninstitooshun, but my wife's a Bible 'oman, and she says 'tan't so; an'\r\nI'm d--d ef she arn't right.'\r\n\r\n'Is your wife a South-Carolina woman?'\r\n\r\n'No, she an' me's from th' old North--old Car'tret, nigh on ter\r\nNewbern--an' we doan't take nat'rally to these fire-eaters.'\r\n\r\n'Have you been here long?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, nigh on ter six yar. I cum har with nuthin' but a thousan' ter my\r\nback, slapped thet inter fifteen hun'red acres, paid it down, and then\r\nhired ten likely North-Car'lina niggers, hired 'em with th' chance uv\r\nbuyin' ef the' liked eout har. Wal, th' nigs all know'd me, and the'\r\nsprung ter it like blazes; so every yar I've managed ter buy two on 'em,\r\nand now I've ten grow'd up, and thar young uns, th' still and all th'\r\ntraps paid fur, an' ef this d--d secesh bisness hadn't a come 'long, I'd\r\nhev hed a right smart chance o' doin' well.'\r\n\r\n'I'm satisfied secession will ruin the turpentine business; you'll be\r\nshut up here, unable to sell your produce, and it will go to waste.'\r\n\r\n'Thet's my 'pinion; but I reckon I kin manage now witheout turpentine.\r\nI've talked it over 'long with my nigs, and we kalkerlate ef these ar\r\ndoin's go eny furder, ter tap no more trees, but cl'ar land an' go ter\r\nraisin' craps.'\r\n\r\n'What! do you talk politics with your negroes?'\r\n\r\n'Nary a politic; but I'm d--d ef th' critters doan't larn 'em sumhow.\r\nThe' knows 'bout as much uv what's goin' on as I du; but plantin' arn't\r\npolitics, it's bisness, an' they've more int'rest in it nor I hev,\r\n'cause they've sixteen mouths ter feed agin my four.'\r\n\r\n'I'm glad, my friend, that you treat them like men; but I have supposed\r\nthey were not well enough informed to have intelligent opinions on such\r\nsubjects.'\r\n\r\n'Informed! wal, I reckon the' is; all uv mine kin read, an' sum on 'em\r\nkin write, too. D'ye see that little nig thar?' pointing to a juvenile,\r\ncoal-black darky of about six years, who was standing before the 'still'\r\nfire; 'thet ar little devil kin read an' speak like a parson. He's got\r\nhold, sumhow, uv my little gal's book o' pieces, an' larned a dozen on\r\n'em. I make him cum inter th' house, once in a while uv an evenin', an'\r\nspeechify, an' 'twould do yer soul good ter har him, in his shirt-tail,\r\nwith a old sheet wound round him fur a toger (I've told him th'\r\nplay-actors du it so down ter Charles'on,) an' spoutin' out: 'My name am\r\nNorval; on de Gruntin' hills my fader feed him hogs!' The little coon\r\nnever seed a sheep, an' my wife's told him a flock's a herd, an' he\r\nthinks 'hog' _sounds_ better'n 'flock,' so, contra'y ter th' book, he\r\nputs in 'hogs,' and hogs, you knows, hev ter grunt, so he gits 'em on\r\nth' Gruntin' hills;' and here the kind-hearted native burst into a fit\r\nof uproarious laughter, in which, in spite of myself, I had to join.\r\n\r\nWhen the merriment had somewhat subsided, the turpentine-maker called\r\nout to the little darky:\r\n\r\n'Come here, Jim.'\r\n\r\nThe young chattel ran to him with alacrity, and wedging in between his\r\nlegs, placed his little black hands in a free-and-easy way on his\r\nmaster's knees, and looking up trustfully in his face, said:\r\n\r\n'Wal, massa?'\r\n\r\n'What's yer name?'\r\n\r\n'Dandy Jim, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Thet arn't all; what's th'rest?'\r\n\r\n'Dandy Jim of ole Car'lina.'\r\n\r\n'Who made ye?'\r\n\r\n'De good God, massa.'\r\n\r\n'No, he didn't; God doan't make little nigs. He makes none but white\r\nfolks,' said the master, laughing.\r\n\r\n'Yas, he'm do; missus say he'm do; dat he make dis nig jess like he done\r\nlittle Totty.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, he did, Jim. I'm d--d ef _He_ didn't, fur nobody else cud make\r\n_ye!_' replied the man, patting the little wooly head with undisguised\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n'Now, Jim, say th' creed fur 'de gem-man.''\r\n\r\nThe young darky then repeated the Apostles' Creed and the Ten\r\nCommandments.\r\n\r\n'Is thet all ye knows?'\r\n\r\n'No, massa, I knows a heap 'sides dat.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, say suthin' more; sum on 'em pieces thet jingle.'\r\n\r\nThe little fellow then repeated with entire correctness, and with\r\nappropriate gestures and emphasis, though in the genuine darky\r\ndialect--which seems to be inborn with the pure, Southern black--Mrs.\r\nHemans' poem:\r\n\r\n  'The boy stood on the burning deck.'\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Hemans draped in black!' I exclaimed, laughing heartily; 'How\r\nwould the good lady feel, could she look down from where she is, and\r\nhear a little darky doing up her poetry in that style?'\r\n\r\n'D--d ef I doan't b'lieve'twud make her love th' little nig like I do,'\r\nreplied the corn-cracker, taking him up on his knee as tenderly as he\r\nwould have taken up his own child.\r\n\r\n'Tell me, my little man,' I said, 'who taught you all these things?'\r\n\r\n'I lamed 'em myseff, sar,' was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n'You learned them yourself! but who taught you to read?'\r\n\r\n'I larned 'em myseff, sar!'\r\n\r\n'You couldn't have learned _that_ yourself; didn't your 'massa' teach\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'No, sar.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! your 'missus' did?'\r\n\r\n'No, sar.'\r\n\r\n'No, sar!' I repeated; then suspecting the real state of the case, I\r\nlooked him sternly in the eye, and said: 'My little man, it's wrong to\r\ntell lies, you must _always_ speak the truth; now, tell me truly, did\r\nnot your 'missus' teach you these things?'\r\n\r\n'No, sar, I larned 'em myseff.'\r\n\r\n'Ye can't cum it, stranger; ye moight roast him over a slow fire, an'\r\nnot git nary a thing eout on him but thet,' said the corn-cracker,\r\nleaning forward, and breaking into a boisterous fit of laughter. 'It's\r\nagin th' law, an' I'm d--d ef _I_ teached him. Reckon he _did_ larn\r\nhimself!'\r\n\r\n'I must know your wife, my friend. She's a good woman.'\r\n\r\n'Good! ye kin bet high on thet; she's uv th' stuff th' Lord makes angels\r\neout on.'\r\n\r\nI had no doubt of it, and was about to say so, when the Colonel's\r\nturpentine-wagon drove up, and I remembered I had left him too long\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe coachman was driving, and Jim sat on the wagon beside him.\r\n\r\n'Massa K--,' said the latter, getting down and coming to me, 'Whar am\r\ndey?'\r\n\r\n'In the spirit-shed.'\r\n\r\nHe was turning to go there, when I called him back, saying: 'Jim, you\r\nmust not see your master now; you'd better keep out of sight for the\r\npresent.'\r\n\r\n'No, massa; de ma'am say de Cunnel take dis bery hard, and dat I orter\r\ntell him I'se sorry for what I'se done.'\r\n\r\n'Well, wait awhile. Let me go in first.'\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the corn-cracker, I entered the turpentine-shed. A row of\r\nspirit-barrels were ranged along each of its sides, and two tiers\r\noccupied the centre of the building. On these a number of loose planks\r\nwere placed, and on the planks lay the bodies of the metif woman and her\r\nchild. The Colonel was seated on a barrel near them, with his head\r\nresting on his hands, and his eyes fixed on the ground. He did not seem\r\nto notice our entrance, and passing him without speaking, I stepped to\r\nthe side of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe woman's dress, the common linsey gown worn by her class, was still\r\nwet, and her short, kinky, brown hair fell in matted folds around her\r\nhead. One arm hung loosely by her side; the other was clasped tightly\r\naround her child, which lay as if asleep on her bosom. One of its small\r\nhands clung to its mother's breast, and around its little lips played a\r\nsmile. But how shall I describe the pale, sweet beauty of the face of\r\nthe drowned girl, as she lay there, her eyes closed, and her lips\r\nparted, as in prayer? Never but once have I seen on human features the\r\nstrange radiance that shone upon it, or the mingled expression of hope\r\nand peace and resignation that rested there, and that was in the\r\nlong-gone time when, standing by her bedside, I watched the passing away\r\nof one who is now an angel in heaven!\r\n\r\n'Come, my dear friend, let us go,' I said, turning and gently taking the\r\nColonel by the arm, 'the negroes are here, and will take charge of the\r\ndead.'\r\n\r\n'No, no!' he replied, rising and looking around as if aroused from a\r\ntroubled dream; 'that is for _me_ to do!' Then he added, after a\r\nmoment's pause, 'Will you help me to get them into the wagon?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I will, certainly.'\r\n\r\nHe made one step toward the body of the dead girl, then sinking down\r\nagain on the barrel, covered his face with his hands, and cried out: 'My\r\nGod! this is terrible! Did you ever see such a look as that? It will\r\nhaunt me forever!'\r\n\r\n'Come, my friend, rouse yourself--this is weakness; you are tired with\r\nthe long ride and excitement of the past few days. Come, go home; I will\r\nlook after them.'\r\n\r\n'No, no! I must do it. I will be a man again;' and he rose and walked\r\nsteadily to the dead bodies. 'Is there any one here to help?' he asked.\r\n\r\nJim was standing in the doorway, and I motioned to him to come forward.\r\nThe great tears were streaming down his face, as he stepped timidly\r\ntoward his master, and said: 'I'll do dis, massa, don't you trubble\r\nyerself no more.'\r\n\r\n'It's good of you, Jim. You'll forgive me for being so cruel to you,\r\nwon't you?' said the Colonel, taking the black by the hand.\r\n\r\n'Forgib ye, massa! _I_ war all ter blame; but ye'll forgib me,\r\nmassa--ye'll forgib me!' cried the black, with strong emotion.\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes; but say no more about it. Come, let us get Julie home.'\r\n\r\nBut the poor girl was already _home_--home where her sufferings and her\r\nsorrows were over, and all her tears were wiped away forever!\r\n\r\nWe four bore away the mother and the child. A number of blankets were in\r\nthe bottom of the wagon, and we laid the bodies carefully upon them.\r\nWhen all seemed ready, the Colonel, who was still standing by the side\r\nof the dead, turned to my new friend, and said: 'Barnes, will you loan\r\nme a pillow? I will send it back to-night.'\r\n\r\n'Sartin, Cunnel,' and the farmer soon brought one from the house.\r\nLifting tenderly the head of the drowned girl, the Colonel placed it\r\nbeneath her, and smoothing back her tangled hair, he gently covered her\r\nface with his handkerchief, as if she could still feel his kindness, or\r\nlonger cared for the pity or the love of mortal. Yet, who knows but that\r\nher parted soul, from the high realm to which it had soared, may not\r\nthen have looked down, have seen that act, and have forgiven him?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the first moments of grief the sympathy of friends and the words of\r\nconsolation bring no relief. How much more harshly do such words grate\r\non the ear when the soul is bowed down by remorse and unavailing regret!\r\nThen the wounded spirit finds peace nowhere but with God.\r\n\r\nI saw that the Colonel would be alone, and turning to him, as he\r\nprepared to follow the strange vehicle which, with its load of death,\r\nwas already jolting its way over the rough forest road, I said:\r\n\r\n'Will you pardon me, if I remain with your friend here for a while? I\r\nwill be at the mansion before dark.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! certainly, my friend; come when you feel disposed,' he replied, and\r\nmounting his horse, he was soon out of sight among the trees.\r\n\r\n'Now, Barnes,' I said, shaking off the gloomy feelings that had\r\noppressed me; 'come, I must see that wife of yours, and get a glimpse of\r\nhow you live.'\r\n\r\n'Sartin, stranger; come in. I'll give ye th' tallest dinner my 'oman can\r\nscare up, an' she's sum pumkins in th' cookin' line;' and he led the way\r\nto the farm-house.\r\n\r\nAs I turned to follow, I slipped a half-dollar into the hand of the\r\ndarky who was holding my horse, and asked him to put her again into the\r\nstable.\r\n\r\n'I'll do dat, sar; but I karn't take dis; massa doan't 'low it nohow,'\r\nhe replied, tendering me back the money.\r\n\r\n'Barnes, your negroes have strange ways; I never met one before who'd\r\nrefuse money.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, stranger,'tan't hosspetality to take money on yer friends, and\r\nBill gets all he wants from me.'\r\n\r\nI took the silver and gave it to the first darky I met, who happened to\r\nbe an old centenarian belonging to the Colonel. As I tossed it to him,\r\nhe grinned out: 'Ah! massa, I'll git sum 'backer wid dis; 'pears like I\r\nhadn't nary a chaw in furty yar.' With more than one leg in the grave,\r\nthe old negro had not lost his appetite for the weed: in fact, that and\r\nwhisky are the only 'luxuries' ever known to the plantation black.\r\n\r\nAs we went nearer, I took a closer survey of the farm-house. It was, as\r\nI have said, a low, unpainted, wooden building, located in the middle of\r\na ten-acre lot. It was approached by a straight walk, paved with a\r\nmixture of sand and tar, similar to that which the reader may have seen\r\nin the Champs Elysées. I do not know whether my backwoods friend or the\r\nParisian pavior was the first inventor of this composition; but I am\r\nsatisfied the corn-cracker had not stolen it from the stone-cracker. The\r\nwalk was lined with fruit-bearing shrubs, and directly in front of the\r\nhouse were two small flower-beds.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling itself, though of a dingy-brown wood-color, was neat and\r\ninviting. It may have been forty feet square on the ground, and was only\r\na story and a half high; but a projecting roof and a front dormer-window\r\nrelieved it from the appearance of disproportion. Its gable ends were\r\nsurmounted by two enormous brick chimneys, carried up on the outside, in\r\nthe fashion of the South, and its high, broad windows were ornamented\r\nwith Venetian blinds. Its front door opened directly into the\r\n'living-room,' and at the threshold we met its mistress. As the image of\r\nthat lady has still a warm place in a pleasant corner of my memory, I\r\nwill describe her. She was about thirty years of age, and had a fresh,\r\ncheerful face. To say that she was handsome, would not be strictly true;\r\nthough she had that pleasant, gentle, kindly expression that sometimes\r\nmakes even a homely person seem beautiful. But she was not homely. Her\r\nfeatures were regular, her hair glossy and brown, and her eyes black and\r\nbrilliant, and for their color, the mildest and softest I had ever seen.\r\nHer figure was tall, and in its outline somewhat sharp and angular; but\r\nshe had an ease and grace about her that made one forget she was not\r\nmolded as softly and roundly as others. She seemed just the woman on\r\nwhose bosom a tired, worn, over-burdened man might lay his weary head,\r\nand find rest and forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nShe wore a neat calico dress, fitting closely to the neck, and an apron\r\nof spotless white muslin. A little lace cap perched cosily on the back\r\nof her head, hiding a portion of her wavy, dark hair, and on her feet--a\r\nmiracle, reader, in one of her class--were stockings and shoes! Giving\r\nme her hand--which, at the risk of making her husband jealous, I held\r\nfor a moment--she said, making a gentle courtesy:\r\n\r\n'Ye ar welcome, stranger.'\r\n\r\n'I sincerely thank you, madam; I _am_ a stranger in these parts.'\r\n\r\nShe tendered me a chair; while her husband opened a sideboard, and\r\nbrought forth a box of Havanas and a decanter of Scuppernong. As I took\r\nthe proffered seat, he offered me the refreshments. I drank the lady's\r\nhealth in the wine, but declined the cigars. Seeing this, she remarked:\r\n\r\n'Yer from th' North, sir, arn't ye?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, madam, I live in New-York; but I was born in New-England.'\r\n\r\n'I reckoned so; I knew ye didn't belong in Car'lina.'\r\n\r\n'How did you know that, madam?' I asked, laughing.\r\n\r\n'I seed ye doan't smoke 'fore wimmin. But ye mustn't mind me; I sort o'\r\nlikes it; it's a great comfut to John, and may be it ar to ye.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I do relish a good cigar; but I never smoke before any lady\r\nexcept my wife, and though she's only 'a little lower than the angels,'\r\nshe _does_, once in a while, say it's a shame to make the _house_ smell\r\nlike a tobacco-factory.'\r\n\r\nBarnes handed me the box again, and I took one. As I was lighting it, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Ye've got a good 'oman, hev ye?'\r\n\r\n'There's none better; at least, I think so.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I'm 'zactly uv thet 'pinion 'bout mine; I wouldn't trade her fur\r\nall this worle an' th' best half uv t'other.'\r\n\r\n'Don't ye talk so, John,' said the lady. Then addressing me, she added:\r\n'It's a good husband thet makes a good wife, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Sometimes, madam, but not always, I've known some of the best of wives\r\nwho had miserable husbands.'\r\n\r\n'An' I'm d--d ef _I_ made my wife th' 'oman she ar',' said the\r\ncorn-cracker.\r\n\r\n'Hush, John, ye mustn't swar so; ye knows how often ye've said ye\r\nwouldn't.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I du, an' I won't agin, by--.' But Sukey, whar's th' young uns?'\r\n\r\n'Out in the lot, I reckon; but ye mustn't holler'm in--they'r all dirt.'\r\n\r\n'No matter for that, madam,' I said, 'dirt is healthy for little ones;\r\nrolling in the mud makes them grow.'\r\n\r\n'Then ourn orter grow right smart, fur they'r in it allers.'\r\n\r\n'How many have you, madam?'\r\n\r\n'Two; a little boy, four, and a little gal, six.'\r\n\r\n'They're of interesting ages.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, the' is int'restin'; ev'ry uns own chil'ren is smart; but the'\r\ndoes know a heap. John was off ter Charl'ston no great while back, an'\r\nthe little boy used ter pray ev'ry mornin' an' ev'nin' fur his fader ter\r\ncum hum. I larned 'em thet jest so soon as the' talked, 'cause thar's no\r\ntellin' how quick the' moight be tooken 'way. Wal, the little feller\r\nprayed ev'ry mornin' an' ev'nin' fur his fader ter cum back, and John\r\ndidn't cum; so finarly he got sort o' provoked with th' Lord, an' he\r\nsaid God war aither deaf an' couldn't har or he war naughty an' wouldn't\r\ntell fader thet little Johnny wanted to seed 'im 'werry mooch,'' and\r\nhere the good lady laughed pleasantly, and I joined in most heartily.\r\n\r\nBlessed are the children that have such a mother!\r\n\r\nSoon the husband returned with the little girl and boy and four young\r\nebonies, all bare-headed and all dressed alike, in thick trowsers and a\r\nloose linsey shirt. Among them was my new acquaintance, 'Dandy Jim, of\r\nole Car'lina.'\r\n\r\nThe little girl came to me, and soon I had two white children on one\r\nknee and two black on the other, with Dandy Jim between my legs, playing\r\nwith my watchchain. The family made no distinction between the colors,\r\nand as the children were all equally clean, I did not see why _I_ should\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nThe lady renewed the conversation by remarking: 'P'raps ye reckon it's\r\nquar, sir, that we 'low ourn to 'sociate 'long with th' black chil'ren;\r\nbut we karn't help it. On big plantations, it works sorry bad, fur th'\r\nwhite young uns larn all manner of evil from the black uns; but I've\r\nlaboored ter teach ourn so one won't do no harm ter t'other.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose, madam, that is one of the greatest evils of slavery. The low\r\nblack poisons the mind of the white child, and the bad influence lasts\r\nthrough life.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, it's so, stranger; an' it's the biggest keer I hev. It often\r\n'pears strange ter me thet our grow'd up men arn't no wuss than the'\r\nis.'\r\n\r\nIn those few words, that unlettered woman had said what would--if men\r\nwere but wise enough to hear and heed the great truth which she\r\nspoke--banish slavery from this continent forever!\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the farmer told the juvenile delineator of Mrs. Hemans\r\nand the other poets to give us a song; and planting himself in the\r\nmiddle of the floor, the little darky sang 'Dixie' and several other\r\nnegro songs, which his master had taught him, but into which he had\r\nintroduced some amusing variations of his own. The other children joined\r\nin the choruses; and then Jim danced breakdowns, 'walk-along-Joes,' and\r\nother darky dances, his master accompanying him on a cracked fiddle,\r\ntill my sides were sore with laughter, and the hostess begged them to\r\nstop. Finally the clock struck twelve, and the farmer, going to the\r\ndoor, gave a long, loud blast on a cow's horn. In about five minutes,\r\none after another of the field hands came in, till the whole ten had\r\nseated themselves on the verandah. Each carried a bowl, a tin-cup, or a\r\ngourd, into which my host--who soon emerged from a back room[1] with a\r\npail of whisky in his hand--poured a gill of the beverage. This was the\r\nday's allowance, and the farmer, in answer to a question of mine, told\r\nme he thought negroes were healthier and worked better for a small\r\nquantity of alcohol daily. 'The' work hard, and salt feed doan't set 'em\r\nup 'nough,' was his remark.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hostess busied herself with preparations for dinner, and\r\nit was soon spread on a bright cherry table, covered by a spotless white\r\ncloth. The little darkies had scattered to the several cabins, and we\r\nsoon sat down to as good a meal as I ever ate at the South.\r\n\r\nWe were waited on by a tidy negro woman, neatly clad in a calico gown,\r\nwith shoes on her feet, and a flaming red and yellow kerchief on her\r\nhead. This last was worn in the form of a turban, and one end escaping\r\nfrom behind and hanging down her back, it looked for all the world like\r\na flag hung out from a top turret. Observing it, my host said:\r\n\r\n'Aggy--showin' yer colors? Ye'r Union gal--hey?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, I is dat, massa; Union ter de back-bone,' responded the negress,\r\ngrinning widely.\r\n\r\n'All th' Union _ye_ knows on,' replied the master, winking slyly at me,\r\n'is th' union yer goin' ter hitch up 'long with black Cale over ter\r\nSquire Taylor's.'\r\n\r\n'No, 'tan't, massa; takes more'n tu ter make de Union.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, I knows; it gin'rally takes ten or a dozen: reckon it'll take a\r\ndozen with ye.'\r\n\r\n'John, ye mustn't talk so ter th' sarvents; it spiles 'em,' said his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n'No it doan't; do it, Aggy?'\r\n\r\n'Lor', missus, I doan't keer what massa say; but I doan't leff no oder\r\nman run on so ter me!'\r\n\r\n'No more'n ye doan't, gal! only Cale.'\r\n\r\n'Nor him, massa; I makes him stan' 'roun', _I_ reckon.'\r\n\r\n'I reckon ye du; ye wudn't be yer massa's gal ef ye didn't.'\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, I visited with my host the negro houses. The\r\nhour allowed for dinner[2] was about expiring, and the darkies were\r\npreparing to return to the field. Entering one of the cabins, where were\r\ntwo stout negro men and a woman, my host said to them, with a perfectly\r\nserious face:\r\n\r\n'Har, boys, I've fetched ye a live Yankee ab'lishener; now, luk at 'im\r\nall roun'. Did ye ever see sech a critter?'\r\n\r\n'Doan't see nuffin' quar in dat gemman, massa,' replied one of the\r\nblacks. 'Him 'pears like bery nice gemman; doan't 'pear like\r\nab'lishener;' and he laughed and scraped his head in the manner peculiar\r\nto the negro, as he added: 'Kinder reckon he wudn't be har ef he war one\r\nof _dem_.'\r\n\r\n'What der _ye_ knows 'bout th' ab'lisheners? Ye never seed one; what\r\nd'ye 'spose the' luk like?'\r\n\r\n'Dey say dey luk likes de bery ole debil, massa; but reckon 'tan't so.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, the' doan't; the' luk wuss then thet; they'm bottled up thunder\r\nan' lightnin', an' ef the' cum down har, they'll chaw ye all ter hash.'\r\n\r\n'I reckon!' replied the darky, manipulating his wool and distending his\r\nface into a decidedly incredulous grin.\r\n\r\n'What do you tell them such things for?' I asked good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n'Lor' bless ye, stranger, the' knows th' ab'lisheners ar thar friends,\r\njest so well as ye du; and so fur as thet goes, d--d ef the' doan't know\r\nI'm one on 'em myseff, fur I tells 'em ef the' want to put the' kin put,\r\nan' I'll throw thar trav'lin 'spenses inter th' bargin. Doan't I tell ye\r\nthet, Lazarus?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa; but none ob massa's nigs am gwine ter put--lesswise, not so\r\nlong as you an' de good missus am 'bove groun'.'\r\n\r\nThe darky's name struck me as peculiar, and I asked him where he got it.\r\n\r\n'_'Tan't_ my name, sar; but you see, sar, w'en massa fuss hire me ob ole\r\nCapt'in ----, up dar ter Newbern-way, I war sort o' sorry like--hadn't\r\nno bery good cloes--an' massa he den call me Lazarus, 'case he say I war\r\nall ober rags and holes, an' it hab sort o' stuck ter me eber sense. I\r\nwar a'mighty bad off 'fore dat, but w'en I cum down har I gets inter\r\nAbr'am's buzzum, I does,' and here the darky actually reeled on his seat\r\nwith laughter.\r\n\r\n'Is this woman your wife?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'No, sar; my wife 'longs to Cunnel J----; dat am my new wife--my ole\r\nwife am up dar whar I cum from.'\r\n\r\n'What! have you two wives?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, I'se two.'\r\n\r\n'But that's contrary to Scripture?'\r\n\r\n'No, sar; de Cunnel say 'tan't. He say in Scriptur' dey hab a heap ob\r\n'em, and dat niggers kin hab jess so many as dey likes--a hun'red ef dey\r\nwant ter.'\r\n\r\n'Does the Colonel teach that to his negroes?' I asked, turning to the\r\nnative.\r\n\r\n'Yas, I reckon he do, an' sits 'em th' 'zample, too,' he replied,\r\nlaughing; 'but th' old sinner knows better'n thet; he kin read.'\r\n\r\n'Do you find that in the Bible, Lazarus?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, whar I reads it. Dat's whar it tell 'bout David and Sol'mon\r\nand all em--dey hab a heap ob wives. A pore ole darky karn't hab nuffin'\r\n'sides dem, an' he _orter_ be 'low'd jess so many as he likes.'\r\n\r\nLaughing at the reasoning of the negro, I asked:\r\n\r\n'How would _you_ like it, if your wife over at Colonel J----'s had as\r\nmany husbands as _she_ liked?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I couldn't fine no fault, massa; an' I s'pose she do, dough I\r\ndoan't knows it, 'case I'se dar only Sundays.'\r\n\r\n'Have you any children?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar, Ise free 'longin' ter de Cunnel, an' four or five--I doan't\r\n'zactly know--up ter hum; but _dey'se_ grow'd up.'\r\n\r\n'Is your wife up there married again?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, she got anoder man jess w'en I cum 'way; har ole massa make\r\nhar do it.'\r\n\r\nWe then left the cabin, and when out of hearing of the blacks, I said to\r\nthe corn-cracker: 'That _may be_ Scripture doctrine, but _I_ have not\r\nbeen taught so.'\r\n\r\n'Scriptur' or no Scriptur', stranger, it's d----d heathenism,' replied\r\nthe farmer, who, take him all in all, is a superior specimen of the\r\nclass of small planters at the South; and yet, seeing polygamy practiced\r\nby his own slaves, he made no effort to prevent it. He told me that if\r\nhe should object to his darky cohabiting with the Colonel's negress, it\r\nwould be regarded as unneighborly, and secure him the enmity of the\r\nwhole district! And still we are told that slavery is a _divine_\r\ninstitution!\r\n\r\nAfter this, we strolled off into the woods, where the hands were at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThey were all stout, healthy, and happy-looking, and in answer to my\r\ncomments on their appearance, the native said that the negroes on the\r\nturpentine-farms are always stronger and longer-lived than those on the\r\nrice and cotton-fields. Unless carried off by the fevers incident to the\r\nclimate, they generally reach a good old age, while the rice-negro\r\nseldom lives to be over forty, and the cotton-slave very rarely attains\r\nsixty. Cotton-growing, however, my host thought, is not, in itself, much\r\nmore unhealthy than turpentine-gathering, though cotton-hands work in\r\nthe sun, while the turpentine-slaves labor altogether in the shade.\r\n\r\n'But,' he said, 'the' work 'em harder nor we does, an' doan't feed 'em\r\nso well. We give ourn meat and whisky ev'ry day, but them articles is\r\nskarse 'mong th' cotton blacks, an' th' rice niggers never get 'em\r\nexcep' ter Christmas-time, an' thet cums but onst a yar.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think the white could labor as well as the black, on the rice\r\nand cotton-fields?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Yas, an' better--better any whar; but, in coorse, 'tain't natur' fur\r\nblack nor white ter stand long a workin' in th' mud and water up ter\r\nthar knees; sech work would kill off th' very devil arter a while. But\r\nth' white kin stand it longer nor the black, and it's 'cordin' ter\r\nreason that he shud; for, I reckon, stranger, that the spirit and pluck\r\nuv a man hev a durned sight ter du with work. They'll hole a man up when\r\nhe's clean down, an' how kin we expec' thet th' pore nig, who's nary a\r\nthing ter work fur, an who's been kept under an' 'bused ever sense Adam\r\nwas a young un'--how kin we expec' he'll work like men thet own\r\n'emselfs, an' whose faders hev been free ever sense creation? I reckon\r\nthat the parient has a heap ter du with makin' th' chile. He puts the\r\nsperit inter 'im: doan't we see it in hosses an' critters an' sech like?\r\nIt mayn't crap eout ter onst, but it's shore ter in th' long run, and\r\nthet's th' way th' black han't no smarter nor he is. He's been a-ground\r\ndown an' kept under fur so long thet it'll take more'n 'un gin'ration\r\nter bring him up. 'Tan't his fault thet he's no more sperit, an' p'raps\r\n'tan't ourn--thet is, them on us as uses 'em right--but it war the fault\r\nuv yer fader an' mine--yer fader stole 'em, and mine bought 'em, an'\r\nthe' both made cattle uv 'em.'\r\n\r\n'But I had supposed the black was better fitted by nature for hard\r\nlabor, in a hot climate, than the white.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, he arn't, an' I knows it. Th' d----d parsons an' pol'tishuns say\r\nthet, but 'tan't so. I kin do half agin more work in a day then th' best\r\nnig I've got, an' I've dun it, tu, time an' agin, an' it didn't hurt me\r\nnuther. Ye knows ef a man hev a wife and young 'uns 'pendin' on him, an'\r\narn't much 'forehanded, he'll work like th' devil. I've dun it, an' ye\r\nhev ef ye war ever put ter it; but th' nigs, why, the' han't got no\r\nwives and young 'uns ter work fur--the law doan't 'low 'em ter have\r\nany--the' han't nary a thing but thar carcasses, an' them's thar\r\nmasters'.'\r\n\r\n'You say a man works better for being free; then you must think 'twould\r\nbe well to free the negroes.'\r\n\r\n'In coorse, I does. Jest luk at them nigs o' mine; they're ter all\r\n'tents an' purposes free, 'case I use 'em like men, an' the' knows the'\r\nkin go whenever the' d----d please. See how the' work--why, one on 'em\r\ndoes half as much agin as ony hard-driv' nigger in creation.'\r\n\r\n'What would you do with them, if they were _really_ free?'\r\n\r\n'Du with 'em? why, hire 'em, an' make twice as much eout on 'em as I\r\ndoes now.'\r\n\r\n'But I don't think the two races were meant to live together.'\r\n\r\n'No more'n the' warn't. But 'tan't thar fault thet they's har. We han't\r\nno right to send 'em off. We orter stand by our'n an' our faders'\r\ndoin's. The nig keers more fur his hum, so durned pore as it ar', then\r\nye or I does fur our'n. I'd pack sech off ter Libraria or th' devil, as\r\nwanted ter go, but I'd hev no 'pulsion 'bout it.'\r\n\r\n'Why, my good friend, you're half-brother to Garrison. You don't talk to\r\nyour neighbors in this way?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I doan't;' he replied, laughing. 'Ef I dun it, they'd treat me to\r\na coat uv tar, and ride me out uv th' deestrict raather sudden, I\r\nreckon; but yer a Nuthener, an' the' all take nat'rally ter freedum,\r\nexcep' th' d----d doughfaces, an' ye aren't one on 'em, I'll swar.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm not. Do many of your neighbors think as you do?'\r\n\r\n'Reckon not many round har; but up in Cart'ret, whar I cum from, heaps\r\non 'em do, though the' darn't say so.'\r\n\r\nBy this time we had reached the still, and directing his attention to\r\nthe enormous quantity of rosin that had been run into the pit which I\r\nhave spoken of, I asked him why he threw so much valuable material away.\r\n\r\n'Wal, 'tan't wuth nothin' har. Thet's th' common, an' it won't bring in\r\nYork, now, more'n a dollar forty-five. It costs a dollar an' two bits\r\nter get it thar an' pay fur sellin on it, an' th' barr'l's wuth the\r\ndifference. I doan't ship nuthin wuss no No. 2.'\r\n\r\n'What is No. 2?'\r\n\r\nHe took the head from one of the barrels, and with an adze cut out a\r\nsmall piece, then handing me the specimen, replied:\r\n\r\n'Now hole thet up ter th' sun. Ye'll see though it's yaller, its clean\r\nand clar. Thet's good No. 2, what brings now two dollars an' two bits in\r\nNew-York, an' pays me 'bout a dollar a barr'l; it's got eout o' second\r\nyar dip, an' as it comes eout uv th' still, is run through thet ar\r\nstrainer,' pointing to a coarse wire-sieve that lay near. 'Th' common\r\nrosum, thet th' still's runnin' on now, is made eout on th' yaller\r\ndip--thet's th' kine o' turpentine thet runs from th' tree arter two\r\nyar's tappin'--we call it yallar dip 'case it's allers dark. We doan't\r\nstrain common 'tall, an' it's full uv chips and dirt. It's low now, but\r\nef it shud ever git up, I'd tap thet ar' heap, barr'l it up, run a\r\nlittle fresh-stilled inter it, an' 'twould be a'most so good as new.'\r\n\r\n'Then it is injured by being in the ground.'\r\n\r\n'Not much; it's jest as good fur ev'ry thing but makin' ile, puttin' it\r\nin the 'arth sort o' takes th' sap eout on it, an' th' sap's th' ile.\r\nNatur' sucks thet eout, I s'pose, ter make th' trees grow--I expec' my\r\nbones 'ill fodder 'em one on these days.'\r\n\r\n'Rosin is put to very many uses.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but common's used mainly for ile and soap; th' Yankees put it\r\ninter hard yaller soap, 'case it makes it weigh, an' yer folks is up ter\r\nthem doin's, and he looked at me and gave a sly laugh. I could not deny\r\nthe 'hard' impeachment, and said nothing. Taking a specimen of very\r\nclear light-colored rosin from a shelf in the still-house, I asked him\r\nwhat that quality was worth.\r\n\r\n'Thet ar brought seven dollars for two hundred an' eighty pounds in\r\nYork, airly this yar. It's th' very best No. 1; an' it's hard ter make,\r\n'case ef th' still gets overhet it turns it a tinge. Thet sort is run\r\nthrough two sieves, the coarse 'un, an' thet ar,' pointing to another\r\nwire strainer, the meshes of which were as fine as those of the\r\nflour-sieve used by housewives.\r\n\r\n'Do your seven field-hands produce enough 'dip' to keep your still a\r\nrunning?'\r\n\r\n'No, I buys th' rest uv my naboors who han't no stills; an' th' Cunnel's\r\ndown on me 'case I pay 'em more'n he will; but I go on Franklin's\r\nprincerpel: 'A nimble sixpence's better'n a slow shillin'. A great ole\r\nfeller thet, warn't he? I've got his life.'\r\n\r\n'And you practice on his precepts; that's the reason you've got on so\r\nwell.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, thet an' hard knocks. The best o' doctrins arn't wuth a d----n ef\r\nye doan't work on 'em.'\r\n\r\n'That is true.'\r\n\r\nWe shortly afterward went to the house, and there I passed several hours\r\nin conversation with my new friend and his excellent wife. The lady,\r\nafter a while, showed me over the building. It was well-built,\r\nwell-arranged, and had many conveniences I did not expect to find in a\r\nbackwoods dwelling. She told me its timbers and covering were of\r\nwell-seasoned yellow pine--which will last for centuries--and that it\r\nwas built by a Yankee carpenter, whom they had ''ported' from\r\nCharleston, paying his fare, and giving him his living and two dollars\r\nand a half a day. It had cost as near as she 'cud reckon, 'bout two\r\nthousan' dollars.'\r\n\r\nIt was five o'clock, when, shaking them warmly by the hand, I bade my\r\npleasant friends 'good-by,' and mounting my horse rode off to the\r\nColonel's.\r\n\r\nThe family were at supper when I returned to the mansion, and, entering\r\nthe room, I took my accustomed place at the table. None present seemed\r\ndisposed to conversation. The little that was said was spoken in a low,\r\nsubdued tone, and no allusion was made to the startling event of the\r\nday. At last the octoroon woman asked me if I had met Mrs. Barnes at the\r\nfarmer's.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I replied, 'and I was greatly pleased with her. She seems one of\r\nthose rare women who would lend grace to even the lowest station.'\r\n\r\n'She _is_ a rare woman; a true, sincere Christian. Every one loves her;\r\nbut few know all her worth; only those do who have gone to her in sorrow\r\nand trial, as----' and her voice trembled, and her eyes moistened----\r\n'as I have.'\r\n\r\nAnd so that poor, outcast, despised, dishonored woman, scorned and cast\r\noff by all the world, had found one sympathizing, pitying friend. Truly,\r\n'He tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.'\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, all but Madam P---- retired to the library.\r\nTommy and I fell to reading, but the Colonel shortly rose and continued\r\npacing up and down the apartment till the clock sounded eight. The lady\r\nthen entered, and said to him:\r\n\r\n'The negroes are ready, David; will _you_ go, Mr. K----?'\r\n\r\n'I think not, madam,' I replied; 'at least not now.'\r\n\r\nI continued reading, for a time, when, tiring of the book, I laid it\r\ndown, and followed them to the little burial-ground.\r\n\r\nThe grave of Sam was open, and the plantation blacks were gathered\r\naround it. In the centre of the group, and at the head of the rude\r\ncoffin, the Colonel was seated, and near him the octoroon woman and her\r\nson. The old preacher was speaking.\r\n\r\n'My chil'ren,' he said, 'she hab gone ter Him, wid har chile--gone up\r\ndar, whar dey doan't sorrer no more, whar dey doan't weep no more, whar\r\nall tears am wiped from dar eyes foreber. I knows she lay han's on\r\nharseff, and dat, my chil'ren, am whot none ob us shud do, 'case we'm de\r\nLord's; he put us har, an' he'll take us 'way when we's fru wid our\r\nwork, not afore. We hab no right ter gwo afore. Pore Juley did--but\r\np'raps she cudn't help it. P'raps de great sorrer war so big in har\r\nheart, dat she cudn't fine rest nowhar but in de cole, dark riber.\r\nP'raps she warn't ter blame--p'raps,' and here his eyes filled--'p'raps\r\nole Pomp war all ter blame, fur I tole har, my chil'ren'--he could say\r\nno more, and sinking down on a rude seat, he covered his face, and\r\nsobbed audibly. Even the Colonel's strong frame heaved with emotion, and\r\nnot a dry eye was near. After a time the old man rose again, and with\r\nstreaming eyes, and upturned face, continued:\r\n\r\n'Dar's One up dar, my chil'ren, dat say: 'Come unter me, all ye dat am\r\nweary an' a heaby laden, an' I will gib you ress.' He, de good Lord, he\r\nsay dat; an' p'raps Juley hard him say it, an' dat make har gwo.' Again\r\nhis voice failed, and he sank down, weeping and moaning as if his heart\r\nwould break.\r\n\r\nA pause followed, when the Colonel rose, and aided by Jim and two other\r\nblacks, with his own hands nailed down the lid, and lowered the rude\r\ncoffin into the ground. Then the earth was thrown upon it, and then the\r\nlong, low chant which the negroes raise over the dead, mingling now with\r\nsobs and moans, and breaking into a strange wild wail, went up among the\r\npines, and floating off on the still night air, echoed through the dark\r\nwoods, till it sounded like music from the grave. I have been in the\r\nchamber of the dying; I have seen the young and the beautiful laid away\r\nin the earth; but I never felt the solemn awfulness of death as I did\r\nwhen, in the stillness and darkness of night, I listened to the wild\r\ngrief of that negro group, and saw the bodies of that slave mother and\r\nher child, lowered to their everlasting rest by the side of Sam.\r\n\r\nThe morning broke bright and mellow with the rays of the winter sun,\r\nwhich in Carolina lends the warmth of October to the chills of January,\r\nwhen, with my portmanteau strapped, and my thin overcoat on my arm, I\r\ngave my last 'God bless you' to the octoroon woman, and turned my face\r\ntoward home.\r\n\r\nJim shouted, 'All ready,' the driver cracked his whip, and we were on\r\nour way to Georgetown.\r\n\r\nThe recent rains had hardened the roads, the bridges were repaired, and\r\nwe were whirled rapidly forward, and at one o'clock reached Bucksville.\r\nThere we met a cordial welcome, and remained to dinner. Our host pressed\r\nus to pass the night at his house, but the Colonel had business with one\r\nof his secession friends residing down the road--my wayside\r\nacquaintance, Colonel A----, and desired to stay over night with him. At\r\nthree o'clock, bidding a kindly farewell to Captain B---- and his\r\nexcellent family, we were again on our way.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just sinking among the western pines, when we turned into a\r\nbroad avenue, lined with stately old trees, and rode up to the doorway\r\nof the rice-planter. It was a large, square, dingy old house, seated on\r\na gentle knoll, a short half-mile from the river, along whose banks\r\nstretched the rice-fields. We entered, and were soon welcomed by its\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nHe received my friend warmly, and gave me a courteous greeting,\r\nremarking, when I mentioned that I was homeward bound, that it was wise\r\nto go. 'Things are very unsettled; there's no telling what a day may\r\nbring forth; feeling is running very high, and a Northern man, whatever\r\nhis principles, is not safe here. By the way,' he added, 'did you not\r\nmeet with some little obstruction at Conwayboro, on your way up?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I did; a person there ordered me back, but when things began to\r\nlook serious, Scipio, the negro whom you saw with me, got me out of the\r\nhobble.'\r\n\r\n'Didn't he tell the gentleman that you were a particular friend of mine,\r\nand had met me by appointment at Captain B----'s?' he asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n'I believe he did, sir; but I assure you, _I_ said nothing of the kind,\r\nand I think the black should not be blamed, under the circumstances.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no; I don't blame him. I think he did a smart thing. He might have\r\nsaid you were my grandmother, if it would have served you, for that low\r\nfellow is as fractious as the devil, and dead sure on the trigger.'\r\n\r\n'You are very good, sir,' I replied; 'how did you hear of it?'\r\n\r\n'A day or two afterward, B---- passed here on his way to Georgetown. I\r\nhad been riding out, and happened to be at the head of my avenue when\r\nhe was going by. He stopped, and asked if I knew you. Not knowing then\r\nthe circumstances, I said that I had met you casually at Bucksville, but\r\nhad no particular acquaintance with you. He rode on, saying nothing\r\nfurther. The next morning I had occasion to go to Georgetown, and at Mr.\r\nFraser's office accidentally heard that Scip--who is well known and\r\nuniversally liked there--was to have a public whipping that evening.\r\nSomething prompted me to inquire into it, and I was told that he had\r\nbeen charged by B---- with shielding a well-known abolitionist at\r\nConwayboro--a man who was going through the up-country distributing such\r\ndamnable publications as the New-York _Independent_ and _Tribune_. I\r\nknew, of course, it referred to you, and that it wasn't true. I went to\r\nScip and got the facts, and by stretching the truth a little, finally\r\ngot him off. There was a slight discrepancy between my two accounts of\r\nyou,' (and here he laughed heartily,) 'and B----, when we were before\r\nthe Justice, remarked on it, and came d----d near calling me a liar. It\r\nwas lucky he didn't, for if he had he'd gone to h----l before the place\r\nwas hot enough for him.'\r\n\r\n'I can not tell you, my dear sir, how grateful I am to you for this. It\r\nwould have pained me more than I can express, if Scip had suffered for\r\ndoing a disinterested kindness to me.'\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we were again on our way, and twelve o'clock found\r\nus seated at a dinner of bacon, corn-bread, and waffles, in the 'first\r\nhotel' of Georgetown. The Charleston boat was to leave at three o'clock;\r\nand, as soon as dinner was over, I sallied out to find Scip. After a\r\nhalf-hour's search I found him on 'Shackelford's wharf,' engaged in\r\nloading a schooner bound for New-York with a cargo of cotton and\r\nturpentine.\r\n\r\nHe was delighted to see me, and after I told him I was going home, and\r\nmight never see him again, I took his hand warmly in mine, and said:\r\n\r\n'Scip, I have heard of the disgrace that was near being put upon you on\r\nmy account, and I feel deeply the disinterested service you did to me;\r\nnow, I _can not_ go away without doing _something_ for you--showing you\r\nin _some_ way that I appreciate and _like_ you.'\r\n\r\n'I likes _you_, massa,' he replied, the tears coming to his eyes; 'I tuk\r\nter you de bery fuss day I seed you, 'case, I s'pose'--and he wrung my\r\nhand till it ached--'you pitied de pore brack man. But you karnt do\r\nnuffin fur _me_, massa; I doan't want nuffin; I doan't want ter leab\r\nhar, 'case de Lord dat put me har arn't willin' I shud gwo. But you kin\r\ndo suffin, massa, fur de pore brack man, an' dat'll be doin' it fur\r\n_me_, 'case my heart am all in dat. You kin tell dem folks up dar, whar\r\nyou lib, massa, dat we'm not like de brutes, as dey tink we is. Dat we's\r\ngot souls, an' 'telligence, an' feelin's, an' am men like demselfs. You\r\nkin tell 'em, too, massa--'case you's edication, and kin talk--how de\r\npore wite man am kep' down har; how he'm ragged, an' starvin', an' ob no\r\naccount, 'case de brack man am a slave. How der chil'ren can't get no\r\nschulein', how eben de grow'd-up ones doan't know nuffin--not eben so\r\nmuch as de pore brack slave, 'case de 'stockracy want dar votes, an\r\ncudn't get 'em ef dey 'low'd 'em larnin'. Ef your folks know'd all de\r\ntruf--ef dey know'd how boff de brack an' de pore w'ite man, am on de\r\ngroun', an' can't git up, ob demselfs--dey'd do suffin--dey'd break de\r\nConstertution--dey'd do _suffin_ ter help us. I doan't want no one\r\nhurted, I doan't want no one wronged; but jess tink ob it, massa, four\r\nmillion ob bracks, an' nigh so many pore w'ites, wid de bressed Gospil\r\nshinin' down on 'em, an' dey not knowin' on it. All dem--ebry one ob\r\n'em--made in de image ob de great God, an' dey driven roun' an' 'bused\r\nwuss dan de brutes. You's seed dis, massa, wid your own eyes, an' you\r\nkin tell 'em on it; an' you _will_ tell 'em on it, massa;' and again he\r\ntook my hand while the tears rolled down his cheeks; 'an' Scip will\r\nbress you fur it, massa--wid his bery lass breaf he'll bress you; an' de\r\ngood Lord will bress you, too, massa; he will foreber bress you, for\r\nhe'm on de side ob de pore an' de 'flicted; his own book say dat, an' it\r\nam true, I knows it, fur I feels it _har_;' and he laid his hand on his\r\nheart, and was silent.\r\n\r\nI could not speak for a moment. When I mastered my feelings, I said: 'I\r\n_will_ do it Scip; as God gives me strength, I _will_.'\r\n\r\nReader, I am keeping my word.\r\n\r\nThis is not a work of fiction. It is a record of facts, and therefore\r\nthe reader will not expect me to dispose of its various characters on\r\nartistic principles--that is, lay them away in one of those final\r\nreceptacles for the creations of the romancer--the grave and matrimony.\r\nDeath has been among them, but nearly all are yet doing their work in\r\nthis breathing, busy world.\r\n\r\nThe characters I have introduced are real. They are not drawn with the\r\npencil of fancy, nor, I trust, colored with the tints of prejudice. The\r\nscenes I have described are true. I have taken some liberties with the\r\nnames of persons and places, and, in a few instances, altered dates; but\r\nthe events themselves occurred under my own observation. No one\r\nacquainted with the section of country I have described, or familiar\r\nwith the characters I have delineated, will question this statement.\r\nLest some one who has not seen the slave and the poor white man of the\r\nSouth, as he actually is, should deem my picture overdrawn, I will say\r\nthat 'the half has not been told!' If the whole were related--if the\r\nSouthern system, in all its naked ugliness, were fully exposed--the\r\ntruth would read like fiction, and the baldest relation of fact like the\r\nwildest dream of romance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe overseer was never taken. A letter which I received from Colonel\r\nJ----, shortly prior to the stoppage of the mails, informed me that Moye\r\nhad succeeded in crossing the mountains into Tennessee, where, in an\r\ninterior town, he disposed of the horse, and then made his way by an\r\ninland route to the free States. The horse the Colonel had recovered,\r\nbut the overseer he never expected to see. Moye is now, no doubt,\r\nsomewhere in the North, and is probably at this present writing a\r\nzealous Union man, of somewhat the same 'stripe' as the conductors of\r\nthe New-York _Herald_ and the Boston _Courier_.\r\n\r\nI have not heard directly from Scipio, but one day last July, after a\r\nlong search, I found on one of the wharves of South street a coasting\r\ncaptain who knew him well, and who had seen him the month previous at\r\nGeorgetown. He was at that time pursuing his usual avocations, and was\r\nas much respected and trusted as when I met him.\r\n\r\nA few days after the tidings of the fall of Sumter were received in\r\nNew-York, and when I had witnessed the spontaneous and universal\r\nuprising of the North which followed that event, I dispatched letters to\r\nseveral of my Southern friends, giving them as near as I could an\r\naccount of the true state of feeling here, and representing the utter\r\nmadness of the course the South was pursuing. One of these letters went\r\nto my Union acquaintance whom I have called, in the preceding pages,\r\n'Andy Jones.'\r\n\r\nHe promptly replied, and a pretty regular correspondence ensued between\r\nus, which has continued, at intervals, even since the suspension of\r\nintercourse between the North and the South.\r\n\r\nAndy has stood firmly and nobly by the old flag. At the risk of every\r\nthing, he has boldly expressed his sentiments every where. With his life\r\nin his hand and--a revolver in each of his breeches-pockets, he walked\r\nthe streets of Wilmington when the secession fever was at its hight,\r\nopenly proclaiming his undying loyalty to the Union, and 'no man dared\r\ngainsay him.'\r\n\r\nBut with all his patriotism, Andy keeps a bright eye on the 'main\r\nchance.' Like his brother, the Northern Yankee, whom he somewhat\r\nresembles and greatly admires, he never omits an opportunity of 'turning\r\nan honest penny.' In defiance of custom-house regulations and of our\r\nstrict blockade, he has carried on a more or less regular traffic with\r\nNew-York and Boston (_via_ Halifax and other neutral ports) ever since\r\nNorth-Carolina seceded. His turpentine, while it was still his property,\r\nhas been sold in the New-York market, under the very eyes of the\r\ngovernment officials, and, honest reader, _I_ have known of it.\r\n\r\nBy various roundabout means, I have recently received letters from him.\r\nHis last, dated in April, and brought to a neutral port by a shipmaster\r\nwhom he implicitly trusts, has reached me since the previous chapters\r\nwere written. It covers six pages of foolscap, and is written in\r\ndefiance of all grammatical and orthographical principles; but as it\r\nconveys important intelligence in regard to some of the persons\r\nmentioned in this narrative, I will transcribe a portion of it.\r\n\r\nIt gave me the melancholy tidings of the death of Colonel J----. He had\r\njoined the Confederate army, and fell, bravely meeting a charge of the\r\nMassachusetts troops, at Roanoke.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the news of his friend's death, Andy rode over to the\r\nplantation, and found Madam P---- plunged in the deepest grief. While he\r\nwas there, a letter arrived from Charleston, with intelligence of the\r\ndangerous illness of her son. This second blow crushed her. For several\r\ndays she was delirious and her life despaired of; but throughout the\r\nwhole, the noble corn-cracker, neglecting every thing, remained beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to herself, and had in a measure recovered her\r\nstrength, she learned that the Colonel had left no will; that she was\r\nstill a slave, and soon to be sold, with the rest of the Colonel's\r\n_personal property_, according to law.\r\n\r\nThis is what Andy writes about the affair. I give the letter as he wrote\r\nit, merely correcting the punctuation and enough of the spelling to make\r\nit intelligible:\r\n\r\n'W'en I hard thet th' Cunnel hadent leff no wil, I was hard put what ter\r\ndew; but arter thinkin' on it over a spell, I knowed shede har on it\r\nsumhow; so I 'cluded to tell har miseff. She tuk on d----d hard at fust,\r\nbut arter a bit, grew more calm like, and then she sed it war God's wil,\r\nan' she wudent komplane. Ye knows I've got a wife, but w'en the ma'am\r\nsed thet, she luk'd so like an angel, thet d----d eff I cud help puttin'\r\nmy arms round har, an' huggin' on har, till she a'moste screeched. Wal,\r\nI toled har I'd stan' by har, eff evrithing went ter h----l, an' I wil,\r\nby----.\r\n\r\n'I made up mi minde to onst what ter dew. It war darned harde work tur\r\nbee 'way from hum jess then, but I war in fur it; soe I put ter\r\nCharleston, ter see th' Cunnel's 'oman. Wal, I seed har, an' I toled har\r\nhow th' ma'am felte, an' how mutch shede dun at makein' th' Cunnel's\r\nmoney, (she made nigh th' hul on it, 'case he war alers keerles, an' tuk\r\nno 'count uv things; eff 't'aden't been fur thet, hede made a wil,) an'\r\nI axed har ter see thet the ma'am had free papers ter onst. An' whot der\r\nye s'poze she sed? Nuthin', by ----, 'cept she dident no nuthin' 'bout\r\nbisniss, an' leff all uv sech things ter har loryer. Wal, then I went\r\nter him--he ar one on them slick, ily, seceshun houn's who'd sell thar\r\nsoles fur a kountterfit dollar--an' he toled me th' 'ministratur hadent\r\nsot yit, an' he cudent dew nuthin' till he hed. Ses I: 'Ye mean th'\r\n'oman's got ter gwo ter th' hi'est bider?' 'Yas,' he sed, 'the Cunnel's\r\ngot dets, an' the've got ter bee pade, an' th' persoonal prop'ty muste\r\nbee sold ter dew it.' Then I sed, 'twud bee sum time 'fore thet war dun,\r\nan' the 'oman's 'most ded an uv no use now; 'what'll ye _hire_ har tur\r\nme fur.' He said a hun'red fur sicks months. I planked down the money\r\nter onst, an' put off.\r\n\r\n'I war bilin' over, but it sumhow cum inter my hed thet the Cunnel's\r\n'oman cudn't bee _all_ stun; so I gose thar agin, an' I toled har what\r\nthe loryer sed, an' made a reg'lar stump-'peal tew har bettur natur. I\r\naxed har ef she'd leff the 'oman who'd made har husban's fortun', who\r\nwar the muther uv his chil'ren, who fur twenty yar hed nussed him in\r\nsickness an' cheered him in healtf, ef shede let _thet 'oman_ bee\r\nauckyund off ter th' hi'est bider. I axed al thet, an' what der ye think\r\nshe sed? Why, jest this. '_I_ doan't no nuthin' 'bout it, Mister Jones.\r\nYe raily must talke ter mi loryer; them matters I leaves 'tirely ter\r\nhim.' Then I sed I s'posed the niggers war ter bee advertist. 'O yas!'\r\nshe sed, (an' ye see she know'd a d----d site 'bout _thet_,) 'all on\r\n'em muss bee solde, 'case ye knows I never did luv the kuntry; 'sides\r\n_I_ cuden't karry on the plantashun, no how.' Then sed I: 'The Orleans\r\ntraders 'ill be thar, an' she wun't sell fur but one use, fur she's\r\nhansum yit; an' ma'am, ye wun't leff a 'oman as white as you is, who fur\r\ntwenty yar hes ben a tru an' fatheful _wife_ tar yer own ded husban', (I\r\nshudn't hev put thet in, but d----d ef I cud help it,) ye wun't put\r\n_har_ up on the block, an' hev har struck down ter the hi'est bider, ter\r\nbee made a d----d ---- on?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I s'pose she haden't forgot thet fur more'n twelve yar the Cunnel\r\nhed _luv'd_ t'other 'oman an' onely _liked_ har; fur w'en I sed thet,\r\nhar ize snapped like h----l, an' she screetched eout thet she dident\r\n'low no sech wurds in har hous', an' ordurd me ter leave. Mitey sqeemish\r\nthet, warn't it? bein' as shede been fur so mony yar the Cunnel's ----,\r\nan' th' tuther one his raal wife.\r\n\r\n'Wal, I _did_ leav'; but I leff a piece of mi mind ahind.

Thet an' deth ar th' onely things\r\nthet I knows on, in this world, jess now, that ar SARTIN.'\r\n\r\nSuch is Andy's letter. Misspelled and profane though it be, I would not\r\nalter a word or a syllable of it. It deserves to be written in\r\ncharacters of gold and hung up in the sky, where it might be read by all\r\nthe world. And it _is_ written in the sky--in the great record book--and\r\nit will be read when you and I, reader, meet the assembled universe, to\r\ngive account of what _we_ have done and written. God grant that our\r\nrecord may show some such deed as that!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The whisky was kept in a back room, above ground, because\r\nthe dwelling had no cellar.

Whirling around its walks in carriages, or\r\ngently promenading under trees, among rose-bushes, and by fountains,\r\nwhile a large band of musicians play with spirit fine selections from\r\nthe last operas, or favorite airs from old ones; the eye gratified by\r\nthe sight of pleasant faces, or dwelling enraptured on the beautiful\r\nlandscape spread before it--how can the brain disengage itself to think\r\nof Liberty, won through toil and battle, only to be preserved by\r\nself-denial and moral strength?\r\n\r\nBut the traveler who travels only to travel, and has the means and\r\nspirit to find pleasure wherever he goes, thinking only of what he sees,\r\nenjoys to its fullest extent the luxurious seat of the hired,\r\nwhite-damask-lined carriage, drawn by stalwart, heavy-limbed, coal-black\r\nhorses, with sweeping tails, the white foam flying from the champed\r\nsilver bits, the whole turn-out driven by a handsome, white-gloved,\r\nblack-coated Roman. In solemn state and swiftly, he winds up the zig-zag\r\nroad leading from the piazza Popolo, (so-called from _popolo_, a\r\npoplar-tree, and not as the English will have it, from _popolo_, the\r\npeople,) and at last reaches the summit of Roman ambition--the top of\r\nthe Pincian hill. He passes other carriages filled with other strangers\r\nlike himself, or with titled and fashionable Romans, and finally, his\r\ncarriage drawn up to one side of the broad drive in front of the\r\nsemi-circle where the band plays, he descends, to walk around and chat\r\nwith the friends he may find there.\r\n\r\nToward sunset the scene is full of animation. The sabres of the cavalry\r\nsoldiers, on guard to prevent infraction of rules, gleam brightly; the\r\nold infantry soldiers are darting here and there, chasing away sundry\r\nownerless dogs, who always make it a point to promenade the Pincio; the\r\nItalian nurses from Albano, or at least dressed in Albanese costume,\r\nshine conspicuous in their crimson-bodiced dresses; Englishmen going\r\nthrough their constitutional; Frenchmen mourning for the Champs Elysées;\r\nartists in broad-brim hats smoking cigars; Americans observing Italy, so\r\nas to be like Italians; ladies of all nations commanding the attention\r\nof mankind as they sweep along the hard-rolled gravel-walks; smiles,\r\nbows, looks of love, indignation, affection, coquetry; faces reflective\r\nof great deeds and greater dinners ... every face bright in the lambent\r\namber light that streams from the sun dipping his head preparatory to\r\nputting on his night-cap, and bidding Rome _felicissima notte!_ a most\r\nhappy night.\r\n\r\nOver the irregular walls of the subdued white and mellow gray houses and\r\npalaces, beyond the Tiber running red in the dying sunlight, over the\r\nround-walled castle of San Angelo, the dome of Saint Peter's rises full\r\nin the midst of the twinkling, hazy, red and golden light. Passing the\r\nstone-pines crowning Monte Mario, there gleam away to the left the far\r\nwaters of the sea, over which the purple mist of young night tenderly,\r\nsoftly falls. Once thoughtfully noted, you will remember this glowing\r\nscene years after sublimer and wilder views are lost to memory or grown\r\nso faint that they are to you but as dull colors seen in dreams of old\r\nage compared to the flashing brightness of those presented to the closed\r\neyes of youth.\r\n\r\nAs the sun sets and those in carriages and on foot slowly leave the\r\nhights of the Pincio, and descend once more to the old city, you will\r\nhear, as the evening star shines brighter and brighter, the first\r\nliquid, thrilling notes of the nightingales; then as you lean over the\r\nstone parapet, dreamily looking into the dense foliage of trees and\r\nshrubs beneath you, you will feel the beauty of those lines:\r\n\r\n  Seek the nightingale's sequestered tower,\r\n  Who with her love-lorn melody\r\n  So bewitched thee in the vernal hour:\r\n  When she ceased to love, she ceased to be.\r\n\r\nIt is from the months of May to November, when travelers have left Rome,\r\nand the city is in the hands of the Romans, that your walks on the\r\nPincio will prove something more than a mere repetition of a stroll in\r\nBaden-Baden, or a revival of ideas common to the Prado or Prater. No\r\nlonger the little prettinesses of the Medicean Venus flirt by you in the\r\nnervous silks that flutter along these walks, but something nobly\r\nwomanly, of a solid past, slow and stately, moves solemnly, by. We know\r\nthe lives of these copies of the Venus of Milos, we know its most\r\ncommonplace and vulgar attributes, but we know, too, its strength! The\r\ncity of Rome holds in its women the mothers of heroes, when Providence\r\nshall withdraw the black veil now hung over their rude minds, and let in\r\nthe light of knowledge. We who laugh at their sad ignorance, think what\r\nwe would be without liberty--our minds enslaved, geography tabooed!\r\nEgypt is a paradise compared to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of foreign travel to an intelligent American are to teach\r\nhim ... the disadvantages of living any where save in America. And\r\nthough the artistic eye dwells with such loving repose on the soothing\r\ncolors of Italy, and particularly on the subdued white and gray tones of\r\nRoman ruins and palaces, walls and houses, yet the owner of that\r\nartistic eye should restrain his wrath at the fiery red bricks of our\r\nown cities, for let him reflect that this color goads him on, as it doth\r\na bull, to make valorous efforts--to do something!\r\n\r\nLooking down from the stone balustrade of the Pincio on the piazza\r\nPopolo, we note two churches, one on either side of the Corso; their\r\narchitecture is neither more nor less hideous than nine tenths of the\r\nother three hundred and odd churches of Rome; the same heavy,\r\nhalf-cooked look about doors and windows, suggesting cocked-hats of the\r\nlargest size on the heads of dwarfs of no size at all; the same heavy\r\nscroll-work, reminding one of the work of a playful giant of a\r\ngreen-grocer who has made a bouquet of sausages and cabbages, egg-plants\r\nand legs of mutton, and exhibits it to a thick-headed public as a--work\r\nof art. O Roman _Plebs!_ lay this nattering unction to your soul--we did\r\nnot do that!\r\n\r\nThe history of all nations seem to indicate successive ages of grub and\r\nbutterfly-life; certainly Rome has been a grub long enough. Let us hope\r\nthe sun of Victor Emmanuel, the King of Gallant Men, will hasten the\r\ntime when the Romans shall wing their way to the light of Liberty. These\r\nmockeries of architecture shall then stand as warning fingers to the\r\nRomans of the sad days that were; the days when mind and body were\r\nenslaved, and the grinning monkey held the dove tight-clutched in his\r\nbrutal grasp. Through sword and fire public taste must pass before it is\r\npurified: the mountain-stream, dashing along with bounding steps, is\r\nclear and sparkling, but in the long stretch of level pastureland or\r\nprairie it is still and--dirty.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to descend and wander through those close and narrow\r\nstreets where the waste-water of old Roman aqueducts makes green and\r\ndamp the foundation stories of gloomy houses, and where the\r\ncarefully-nurtured traveler sees sights of smoked interiors, dirt and\r\nrubbish in the streets, that terrify him; but let him remember that in\r\nthe worst of these kennels the inhabitants have never forgotten that\r\nthey had a Past, and the 'I am a Roman Citizen!' still rings in their\r\nears, eats into their hearts, and is at their tongue's end. Monsieur\r\nAbout was in Rome when Caper was there; he saw these Romans through\r\nNapoleonic spectacles: while one foot was trying to stamp on Antonelli\r\ngently, the other was daintily ascending the shining steps leading to\r\nthe temple of Gallic fame. He is impressed with the idea that the Romans\r\nare hangers-on of hangers-on to patricians, from which we are to infer,\r\nif the patricians are ever hung, there will be a heavy weight to their\r\nfeet!\r\n\r\nRocjean, one afternoon, after a walk on the Pincio, was returning to his\r\nstudio, when, as he descended to the Via Babuino, he met a Roman artist\r\nnamed Attonito, who cultivated the English.\r\n\r\n'Ow arr you toe-day, my dear?' he asked Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Quite well, except a slight attack of bad English, from which I hope to\r\nrecover in a few minutes.'\r\n\r\n'Pray tell unto me th-hat weech is bad Englis.'\r\n\r\n'Haven't you been on the Pincio?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, I tak' consteetutionails up there avery afternoons; it is a\r\ncostume Englis' th-hat I vary moche cotton to.'...\r\n\r\n'W-hat! Cotton to? Why, that is a clear Americanism; where did you pick\r\nit up?'\r\n\r\n'Meester Caper of Noo-York, he told unto me it am more elegant as to\r\nsay, I love, or I affection. Bote, 'ave you saw that bu-tee-fool\r\ncreechure with 'air of flags?'...\r\n\r\n'What!'\r\n\r\n''Air of flags; 'ow you name eet? _Capellatura di lino?_'\r\n\r\n'Oh! you mean tow-head?'\r\n\r\n'Toe! no, no! I mean _lino_.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! yes, flaxen hair.'\r\n\r\n'_Benissimo!_ Vary well, flagson 'air and blue eyze. Shhe was in\r\ncarri-adge with Lady Blumpudy. I go avery afternoons to inspect her as\r\nshe takes the airs on the Pincio, Eet would gife me great pleasures to\r\nally myself to her in marriage compact, bote I do not know eef she has a\r\nfortune. Do you know any theengs?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, a great many; one of which is that it is my dinner-time, and as I\r\nturn down the Condotti--good afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'Goo-ood by, my dear,' answered Attonito, as he slowly wandered up the\r\nPiazza di Spagna.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the beneficial effects of the Pincio on the\r\n_bourgeoise_, thought Rocjean. When will the alarm-bell in the clock of\r\nRoman time ring out its awaking peal?\r\n\r\n\r\nROME BY NIGHT.\r\n\r\nIf one would realize the romantic side of Rome in all its stately\r\ngrandeur, and receive a solemn and ineffaceable impression of its\r\nbeauty, by all means let him, like Quevedo's hero, sleep 'a-daytime' and\r\ndo his sight-seeing by moonlight or star-light; for, save in some few\r\nfavored quarters, its inspection by gaslight would be difficult.\r\nRemember, too, that all that is grandly beautiful of Rome, the traveler\r\nhas seen before he reaches the Imperial City--with the eyes of\r\nunderstanding, with the eyes of others--in books.\r\n\r\nNothing but a heap of old stones, bricks, and mortar is there here for\r\nthe illiterate tourist--he can have six times as jolly a time in Paris\r\nfor half the money that he pays 'in that old hole where a fellow named\r\nCulius Jæsar used to live.'\r\n\r\nAs if the night were not sufficiently dark in this city, there are\r\nalways those who stand ready with the paint-brush of fancy to make it\r\neven of a darker hue; whisperings among the travelers in hotels of\r\ncertain Jim Joneses or Bill Smiths who have been robbed. Yes, sir, early\r\nin the evening, right there in the Corso: grabbed his watch and chain,\r\nstruck him on the head. You know he was a powerfully built man; but they\r\ncame behind him, and if he hadn't have done so and so, the rascally\r\nItalians would have killed him, and so forth.\r\n\r\n'Re-al-ly; well, you won't catch me out at nights!'\r\n\r\nThere rises up, as I write, the figure of a slim young man, of the\r\nday-time negro-minstrel style of beauty, who once dwelt three weeks in\r\nRome. I know that he was profound in knowledge of trick and vice, and\r\nthat he had an impediment in his speech--he could never speak the\r\ntruth. He told a fearful tale of a midnight robbery in the Piazza di\r\nSpagna--himself the victim. It was well told, and I ought to know, for I\r\nread it years before in a romance, only the scene was, in type, laid in\r\nVenice. According to this negro-minstrel style of youth, he had been\r\nseized from behind, held, robbed of watch and elegant gold chain, red\r\ncoral shirt-studs, onyx sleeve-buttons, and a porte-monnaie containing\r\nfifty scudi, etc., etc. He was the theatrical hero of the hotel for two\r\ndays, and the recipient of many drinks. Time, the cater of things, never\r\ndigested this falsehood, and months after the youth had left, I learned\r\nthat he had lost all his jewelry and money at--twenty-deck poker.\r\n\r\nA few nights after Caper was domiciled in the Via Babuino, Rocjean\r\ncalled on him, and as he entered his room, carefully extinguished a\r\ntaper, and was putting it in his pocket, when Caper asked him what that\r\nwas for?\r\n\r\n'That! it's a _cerina_. Have you been two weeks in Rome, and not found\r\nout that? Why, how did you get up-stairs at night?'\r\n\r\n'There was a lamp in the entry.'\r\n\r\n'None there to-night, so I had to light this. It's only a long piece of\r\nwick, dipped in wax; you see you can roll it up in a ball, and carry it\r\nin your pocket, so! Without this and a box of matches, you can never\r\nhope to be a good Roman. You must have seen that where the houses have\r\nany front-doors, three quarters of them are open all night long; for, as\r\non every floor of a house, there live different families, they find it\r\nsaves trouble--trouble is money in Rome--to leave the door unclosed.\r\nThese dark entries, for they are seldom lighted, offer a grand chance\r\nfor intrigues, and when you have lived here as long as I have, you will\r\nfind out that they--improve the chances. A _cerina_, in addition to\r\nkeeping you from breaking your neck, by tumbling down stone stairs,\r\ngives light to avoid the stray dogs that sleep around loose, and to see\r\nif there is any enemy around who wants to give you a few inches of cold\r\nsteel. You may laugh at robbers here; but you may cry for mercy in vain\r\nto a Roman who seeks _vendetta_--revenge, you know. Bad way to use\r\nforeign words; but we all do it here. Speak an Italianized English after\r\na time, the effect of had examples. But come, if you want to see Rome by\r\nmoonlight, it's time we were off.'\r\n\r\nAs they reached the street, Caper asked Rocjean where he could buy the\r\n_cerina_.\r\n\r\n'At any _dragheria_' said the latter.\r\n\r\n'Good, there is a druggist's store up the street--Borioni's.'\r\n\r\n'A _dragheria_ means a grocery-store in Rome. If you want molasses,\r\nhowever, you must go to the _farmacia_ for it, [that is the Roman for\r\ndruggist's shop,] and you will buy it by the ounce.'\r\n\r\n'Live and learn,' said Caper, as they entered the grocery and bought the\r\n_cerina_-price, one baioccho a yard.\r\n\r\n'And now let us walk out to Saint Peter's, and see the church by\r\nmoonlight.'\r\n\r\n'The want of sidewalks in this city,' remarked Rocjean, 'compelling the\r\nRomans to walk over cobble-stones, undoubtedly is the cause of the large\r\nfeet of the women, added to their dislike of being in pain from tight\r\nshoes or boots. For genuine martyrdom from tight shoes, French, Spanish,\r\nand Americans--but chiefly Cubans--next to Chinese women, are ahead of\r\nthe world.'\r\n\r\n'But apart from the fact that they do walk on the narrow sidewalks in\r\nthe Corso, I have noticed that in the side-streets, even where there is\r\na foot-walk, nobody takes advantage of it at night.'\r\n\r\n'For a good reason, as we shall probably see,' said Rocjean,' before we\r\nreach the bridge of San Angelo. But keep close to me in the middle of\r\nthe street.'\r\n\r\nThe moonlight shone brightly down the narrow street they were then\r\nwalking through, which, but for this, the occasional dim light of an\r\noil-lamp hung in front of a shrine, the light from a wine or grocery\r\nshop, and the ruddy blaze of a charcoal-fire, where chestnuts were\r\nroasting for sale, would have been dark indeed. The ground-floor of\r\nvery few Roman houses is ever occupied as a dwelling-place; it is given\r\nup to shops, stables, etc., the families residing, according to their\r\nwealth, on the lowest up to the highest stories; the light purses going\r\nup and the heavy ones sinking. They had walked nearly to the end of this\r\nstreet, when, happening to look up at the fourth story of a house, he\r\nsaw something white being reversed in the moonlight, and the next\r\ninstant a long stream of water, reminding him of the horse-tail fall in\r\nSwitzerland, came splashing down where a sidewalk should have been.\r\n\r\n'What do you think of the middle of the street now?' asked Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'Let's stick to it, even if we stick in it. I'm going to buy an\r\numbrella, _and spread it too_, when I go out of nights, after this.'\r\n\r\nThey reached the bridge of San Angelo, and studied for a short time the\r\nfine effect of the moonlight shining on the turbid, slow-flowing Tiber,\r\nand lighting up the heavy pile of the castle of San Angelo. Then they\r\nreached the Piazza of Saint Peter's, and here the scene was imperial.\r\nOut and in through the semi-circular arcade of massive pillars the\r\nmoonlight stole to sleep upon the soft-toned, gray old pavement, or was\r\nthrown in dancing, sparkling light from the two noble jets of water\r\ntossed in the clear night-air by the splashing fountains. In all its\r\ngigantic proportions rose up, up into the clear blue of the spangled\r\nsky, the grand thought of Michael Angelo--the dome of Saint Peter's.\r\n\r\nReturning from Saint Peter's, Rocjean proposed to walk through the\r\nTrastevere, the other side of the Tiber, and to cross over the river by\r\nthe ponte Rótto or broken bridge. They found the street along the river\r\nvery quiet; here and there a light showed, as on the other side, a\r\nwine-shop or coffee-room; but the houses had few lights in them, and\r\nspite of the moonlight, the streets looked gloomy and desolate.\r\n\r\n'They seem to keep dark this side of the river,' said Caper.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' answered Rocjean, 'and live light. They go to bed for the most\r\npart early, and rise early; they economize fifty-one weeks in a year, in\r\norder to live like lords for the fifty-second--that is Carnival-week.\r\nThen you shall see these queenly Trasteverine in all their bravery,\r\nthronging the Corso. But here is a clean-looking wine-shop, let us go in\r\nand have a foglietta.'\r\n\r\nThey found the shop full of thirsty Romans--it is safe to say\r\nthat--although the number of small flasks showed they could not indulge\r\ntheir taste so deeply as they wished to. The centre of the listening\r\ngroup of Romans, was a bright-eyed, black, curly-haired man, who was\r\nreciting, with loud emphasis:\r\n\r\n  THE LIFE AND DEATH\r\n\r\n  OF THE PERFIDIOUS ASSASSIN,\r\n\r\n  ARRIGO GARBETINGO OF TRENTO,\r\n\r\n  Who slew nine hundred and sixty-four grown\r\n  persons and six children.\r\n\r\nHe had already got through his birth and wicked childhood, and had\r\narrived at that impressive part where he commences his career of brigand\r\nat large, accompanied by a 'bool-dog':\r\n\r\n  'He had a bull-dog of the English breed, oh!\r\n  More savage than all others that we've seen, oh!\r\n  Close at his side it always walked, indeed, oh!\r\n  And never barked! but then his bite was keen, oh!\r\n  When on some poor man straight he sprung, take heed, oh!\r\n  His soul from body quickly fled, I ween, oh!\r\n  Because with cruel, gnashing teeth he tore, oh!\r\n  Him all to pieces, in a manner sore, oh!'\r\n\r\nThe reciter here stopped to drink another tumbler of wine, upon which\r\nCaper and Rocjean, having finished their pint, paid their scot and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n'Was that an improvisatore?' asked Caper.\r\n\r\n'He might pass for such with a stranger of inflammable imagination, who\r\ndidn't know the language,' answered Rocjean. 'He is, in fact, a\r\nreciter, and you can buy the poh, poh-em he was reciting at any of the\r\ncountry fairs, of the man who sells rosaries and crucifixes. It is one\r\nof the cent-songs of the Papal States, published _con licenza_, with\r\nlicense; and a more cruel, disgusting, filthy, and demoralizing tendency\r\nthan it must have on the people can not well be imagined; and there are\r\nhundreds of worse.'\r\n\r\nWhile Rocjean was talking they had crossed the ponte Rótto, and as he\r\nfinished his sentence they stood in front of the ruined house of--Cola\r\ndi Rienzil, 'Redeemer of dark centuries of shame--the hope of Italy,\r\nRienzi, last of Romans!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Rocjean, as he halted in front of the ruined house, and\r\nlooked carefully at the ornamented stones still left, 'when Saint\r\nPeter's church shall be a circus, this house shall be a shrine.'\r\n\r\n'That being the state of the case,' spoke Caper, 'let us walk up to the\r\nTrevi fountain and see the effect by moonlight of its flashing waters,\r\nand inhale the flavor of fried fish from the adjacent stands.'\r\n\r\nThey stood in front of the wild waters dashing, sparkling over the grand\r\nmass of tumbled rocks reared behind the wall of a large palace. Neptune,\r\ncar, horses, tritons, all, stone as they were, seemed leaping into life\r\nin the glittering rays of the moonlight, and the rush and splash of the\r\nwaters in the great basin below the street, contrasted with the silence\r\nof the city, left a deep impression of largeness and force on the minds\r\nof the two artists.\r\n\r\n'Let us go down and drink the water, for he who drinks of it shall\r\nreturn again to Rome!'\r\n\r\n'With all my heart,' said Caper; 'for if the legend has one word of\r\ntruth in it, Garibaldi will be back again some _bello giorno_----'\r\n\r\n'_Bello giorno_ means fine day; _giorno di bello_ means a day for war: I\r\ndrink to both!' spoke Rocjean, dipping water up in his hand.\r\n\r\nThey returned to the street, and were walking toward the Piazza di\r\nSpagna, when they overtook two well-dressed men evidently none the\r\nbetter for too much wine. As they passed them, one of the men said to\r\nthe other:\r\n\r\n'J-im! I don't see but what we-we-'ll have to r-r-roost out-tall night.\r\nI don't know 'ny 'talian, _you_ don't know 'ny 'talian, we-we-'re\r\nnonpl'sh'd, I'm th-think'ng.'\r\n\r\n'Ary borry boutére spikinglish?' said the other one to the two artists,\r\nas they were walking on.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Caper, 'four of 'em. If you've lost your way we'll set you\r\nright. Where's your hotel?'\r\n\r\n''Tel? Why, 'Tel Europe p'aza Spanya. Are you English?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir! I'm an American born, bred and--buttered,' said Caper.\r\n\r\n'B-bullyf'ryou! We'resame spishies--allrite--d-driv'on!'\r\n\r\n'Look here,' said the one of the two men who was least tipsy, 'if this\r\ntother g-gen'leman and I could stick our heads into c-cold water we'd\r\ncome out tall right.'\r\n\r\n'It's only a block or two back to the Trevi fountain,' answered Caper,\r\n'and if your friend will go with you, you'll find water enough there.'\r\n\r\nThey went back to the fountain, and descending the steps with some\r\ndifficulty, the two men soon had their heads pretty well cooled off, and\r\ncame up with cleared intellects and improved pronunciation. In the\r\ncourse of conversation it appeared that the two travelers, for such they\r\nwere, after rather too much wine at dinner in their hotel, had been\r\ninvited to the German Club, where Rhine wine, etc., had finished them\r\noff: attempting to return to their hotel alone, they had lost their way.\r\nAs the four walked along, it came out that one of them owned a painting\r\nby Rocjean, and when he discovered that one of his guides was no other\r\nthan that Americanized Frenchman, the whole party at once fraternized,\r\nand disregarding any more moonlight effects, walked at once to Caper's\r\nrooms, where over cigars and a bottle of Copalti's wine they signed,\r\nsealed, and delivered a compact to have a good time generally for the\r\nweek the two travelers intended devoting to Rome. The moral of which is\r\n... that you make more friends than meet enemies--walking round Rome by\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS IN ART.\r\n\r\nThey were in the presence of a man with flowing hair, flowing beard, and\r\nflowing language, in a studio, all light from which was excluded by\r\nheavy curtains, except enough to display an easel on which was placed a\r\npainting, a background of dark blue where were many apparently spider\r\nand crow-tracks.\r\n\r\n'Those who in the profundity of their darkness incline to the belief\r\nthat the vitality of art, butterfly-like, has fled from this sunny\r\nworld, have made the biggest kind of a mistake,' said Mr. Artaxerxes\r\nPhlamm, the Mystic Artist, to Caper. The hit was evidently intended for\r\nRocjean, but that descendant of the Gauls, for some reason, did not\r\nsmite back again; he contented himself with the remark:\r\n\r\n'Art is long.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' continued Mr. Phlamm, 'not only it has length, but breadth,\r\nbreadth, broadness--it extends from--yes--from--pole to pole.'\r\n\r\n'Like a clothes-line,' said Caper.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' continued Phlamm, with a pickled smile, 'Fancy, ever Fancy, but it\r\nis Imagination that, as it were, brings man to a level with his destiny\r\nand elevates him to the Olympium hights of the True, and all that rises\r\nmuch above the meedyochre. But I must not forget that this is your first\r\nvisit to me studeeyoh. The painting on the easel is a view of Venice on\r\nthe Grand Canal.'\r\n\r\n'But,' said Rocjean, 'I do not see the canal.'\r\n\r\n'When you are gazing at the stars do you see your boots?' asked Phlamm.\r\n\r\n'I always do,' spoke Caper quickly, 'always gaze at 'em at night--smoke\r\na cigar--put my feet higher than my head--sit in a chair--stars\r\nreflected in boots--big thing!'\r\n\r\n'You are full of life and spirits, Caper,' continued Phlamm, 'full of\r\n'em; but Rocjean is more serious, more imbued with his nobil calling. My\r\nillustration, as he understands, would convey the idea that such a thing\r\nas foreground in a painting is false; it's a sham, it's a delusion, and\r\nall that. It may do for pre-Raffleites, but for a man who looks Naychure\r\nin the face, he sees her operating diversely, and he works according. I\r\nrepeat it again, when I was on the Grand Canal in Venice, I didn't see\r\nthe Grand Canal.'\r\n\r\n'Neither did I,' spoke Caper, 'we're just alike; I kept my head all the\r\ntime out of the gondola-window looking for pretty girls--and I saw\r\nthem!'\r\n\r\n'May I ask why you dead-color your canvas blue, and then make your\r\ndrawing in black outline?' asked Rocjean.\r\n\r\n'What is the color of the sky? Is it not blue? Is not blue a cold color;\r\nis it not the negative to the warmth, the balance to the scales, the one\r\nthing needed on which to rear the glorious fabric that Naychure reveals\r\nto the undimmed vision of man? I know your answer, and I refute it. I\r\nhave studied Art from its roots, and now I'm in the branches, and I\r\ngrasp the fruit. My manner is peculiar--I have no patent for it--I ask\r\nfor none. The illimitable passes the legitimate, and the sw-word is\r\ncarried by the hero--for me the bruzh, the paint-bruzh. You see that\r\npainting before you--it is my child--I lavish on it my intentions--I am\r\ngoing to work three years on that picture!'\r\n\r\n'I bet you a new hat you sell it, and a dozen more, and send 'em off\r\nbefore six months. You're all the rage now since you sold old Goldburg a\r\npicture,' quoth Caper.\r\n\r\n'I don't bet, I am opposed to betting. But look that picture of mine in\r\nthe face, in the face! Here is a finished painting, The Lake of Zurich;\r\nsee those clouds floating mistily away into the far distance--there's\r\natmosphere for you--there's air! You can't cut those clouds into slices\r\nof cheese as you can them of that humbug of a Cloud Lowrain. Cloud\r\nLowrain! he's a purty painter! Naychure is my teacher. I go out\r\nmornings and hear the jackdaws chatter, and see trees and all that;\r\nsometimes I walk around in a garden for ten minutes and commune with\r\nNaychure--that's the way to do it. Look at clouds before you paint\r\n'em--I know it's hard when the sun's in your eyes, but do it--I've spent\r\na week at a time out-doors, like Wordsworth and the great, the grand,\r\nthe colossial Ruzking.'\r\n\r\n'I like that water,' said Rocjean, alluding to that of the painting.\r\n\r\n'Water is my peculiar study; I am now engaged experimenting on it--see\r\nthere!' Here Phlamm pointed to a basin.\r\n\r\n'Been washing your hands?' asked Caper.\r\n\r\n'Scientifically experimenting, not manually. Water is\r\nsoup-or-fish-all--earth is not soup-or-fish-all.'\r\n\r\n'Our dinners are, during Lent,' quoth Caper, 'unless we're heretics.'\r\n\r\n'I don't understand your frivolity--what do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Didn't you say, 'Soup or all fish?''\r\n\r\n'Pshaw! You will never make an artist--never, never--_you_ are too, too\r\nsuperficiall, too much of the earth, dirty.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! now I understand,' answered Caper; 'give it to me, I deserve it.'\r\n\r\n'I was studying water, its shadows and its superficiality, in that\r\nbasin,' continued Phlamm, 'and I study the ocean there, and have\r\ndevolved great principles from it. What makes my pictures sought for by\r\nthe high and the low, wealthy? What? It's the Truth in 'em, the Mystery,\r\nthe Naychure. The old masters were humbugs, they weren't mysterious,\r\nthey had no inner sight into the workings of Naychure. Who'd buy one of\r\ntheir pictures when he might have a Turner for the same price? Nobody.'\r\n\r\n'Wouldn't he?' asked Caper. 'Try him with a Raphael, just a small one.'\r\n\r\n'Raphael? You mean Raffaele. Ah! he _was_ a painter, he wasn't one of\r\nthe old masters, however, he was a middle-age master. What sweetness,\r\nwhat a kind of--sweetness generally; what a blending of the prayerful\r\ninfant with the enthusiastic beauty; the--the polished chastity of his\r\nMad-donas; the folds of his drapery, and--the drapery of his folds.\r\nTruly enchanting, and so very uncommonly gentlemanly in his colors.'\r\n\r\n'The Chesterfield of oil-colors?' suggested Rocjean. 'But _à propos_ of\r\nNature, you never paint a picture directly from her, do you?'\r\n\r\n'Never! Does a great historical painter use the model? No, sir; he draws\r\non his imagination for his figures. He scorns to copy from a model. I\r\nconvey the impression of mystery that Naychure gives me; I am no servile\r\ncopyist. And I claim to leave an impression on the minds of the\r\nbeholders of my works. Why, even Caper, I believe, can see what I wish\r\nto tell, and read my poems on canvas. Tell me, Caper, what idea does\r\neven that rough sketch of Venice awake in your imaginative faculties,\r\nand all that?'\r\n\r\nCaper's face wore a deeply thoughtful look, as he answered: 'I do see\r\nit; I do claim to read the lesson you would teach----'\r\n\r\n'Speak it out,' interrupted Phlamm, 'I knew you would feel the deep,\r\nmysterious sentiment as is in it.'\r\n\r\n'Spider-tracks and crows' feet on the blue mud of a big marsh,' spoke\r\nCaper resolutely.\r\n\r\n'Pshaw!' exclaimed Phlamm impetuously; 'you have no Faith, and without\r\nthat, all Art is a sealed thing. Goldburg, to whom I lately sold a\r\npainting, had faith; he saw the grand idea which I explained to him in\r\nthat picture; he knew that the Earl of Bigbarns had purchased a work of\r\nmine, and he said to me: 'The opinion of such a man is an opinion as\r\nshould be a valuable opinion to a business man, and govern the\r\nsentiments of those who worship Art.' Other artists see Naychure, but\r\n_how_ do they see her? I answer, blindly! They don't feel her here!'\r\n(Phlamm struck his waistcoat in fearful proximity to a pocket in it, and\r\naltogether too low for his heart.)\r\n\r\n'Nay-chure,' said Caper to Rocjean, as they left this studio of the\r\nmysterious one, 'ruined a good Barnum to make a poor Phlamm, when she\r\nmade him.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA BATH-HUNT.\r\n\r\nIt is a mournful sight to see a city of one hundred and eighty thousand\r\nfive hundred and thirty-nine inhabitants, including one thousand three\r\nhundred and thirty-one priests, two thousand four hundred and four\r\nmonks, and eight hundred and fifty-four Jews, Turks, and heretics, as\r\nthe census had it, attacked with hydrophobia. But it is so. A\r\npreternatural dread of water rages among all the inhabitants of Rome,\r\nfrom the untitled down to the titled.\r\n\r\n'Madame,' said Rocjean to a distinguished female model, 'I assure you\r\nthat, in the sixth century, [or as Sir Gardiner Wilkinson has it, in the\r\nfive hundred,] there were nine thousand and twenty-five baths in this\r\ncity.'\r\n\r\n'Those must have been good times,' replied she, 'for the washerwomen,\r\n_seguro!_ There are a good many clothes of the _forestieri_ [strangers]\r\nwashed here now; but not so many different places to wash them in.'\r\n\r\n'I mean places to bathe one's self all over in.'\r\n\r\n'_Mai!_ Never, never!' exclaimed the woman with horror; 'never! 'twould\r\ngive them the fever, kill them dead!'\r\n\r\nMr. Van Brick, of New-York, arriving in Rome early in the morning,\r\ndemanded of the porter at the hotel where he could find a _bagno_, or\r\nplace where he could get a bath. He was directed to go down the Babuino,\r\nand at such a number he would find the establishment. Forgetting the\r\nnumber before he was three steps from the hotel, he inquired of a man\r\nwho was driving a she-jackass to be milked, where the bath was. As he\r\nspoke very little Italian, he had to make up by signs what he wanted in\r\nwords. The man, probably believing he wanted a church, and that his\r\nmotions signified being sprinkled with water, pointed to the Greek\r\nchurch, and Van Brick, thinking it was a solemn-looking old _bagno_,\r\nstrode in, to his astonishment finding out as soon as he entered that he\r\nwas by no means in the right place. As he turned to go out, he saw an\r\namiable-looking young man, with a black cocked hat in his hand, and a\r\nblack serge shirt on that came down to his heels, and had a waist-band\r\ndrawing it in over his hips. He asked the young man, as well as he could\r\nin Italian, where there was a _bagno_.\r\n\r\n'The signore is English?' asked the youth in the black shirt.\r\n\r\n'I want a bath,' said Van Brick, 'which way?'\r\n\r\n'Have patience, signore. There are a great many English in Rome.'\r\n\r\n'Farewell!' quoth Van Brick, turning on his heel, reflecting: 'That\r\nyouth talks too much; he does it to conceal his ignorance; he don't know\r\nwhat a bath is.' Coming out of the church, he met a good-natured looking\r\nRoman girl, without any bonnet, as usual, going along with a bottle of\r\nwine and a loaf of bread.\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me where the bath is?'\r\n\r\n'_Chi lo sa_, signore.'\r\n\r\nThis CHI LO SA, or, 'who knows?' of the Romans, is a shaft that would\r\nkill Paul Pry. It nearly throws an inquisitive man into convulsions. He\r\nmeets it at every turn. The simplest question is knocked to pieces by\r\nit. So common is it for a Roman of the true _plebs_ breed to give you\r\nthis for an answer to almost every question, that Rocjean once won a hat\r\nfrom Caper in this wise: they stood one evening in front of a grocer's\r\nstore, down by the Pantheon; it was brilliantly illuminated with\r\nhundreds of candles, displaying piles of hams, cheese, butter, eggs,\r\netc., etc. Chandeliers constructed of egg-shells, where candles shone\r\nbrightly, particularly struck Caper.\r\n\r\n'You see,' said Rocjean, 'as anyone else can see, that those chandeliers\r\nare made of egg-shells. Now, I will bet you a hat that I will ask four\r\nmen, one after another, who may come to look in this window, what those\r\nchandeliers are made of, and three at least, if not all four of them,\r\nwill answer, 'Who knows?' (_Chi lo sa._)\r\n\r\n'Done!' said Caper.\r\n\r\nRocjean asked four men, one after another. All four answered; 'Who\r\nknows?'\r\n\r\nBut to continue the bath-hunt: Van Brick was thrown over by the girl's\r\nanswer, and next asked an old woman, who was standing at the door of a\r\nhouse, buying broccoli from a man with a hand-cart.\r\n\r\n'Can _you_ tell me where the bath is?'\r\n\r\n'The bath?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the bath.'\r\n\r\n'Is it where they boil water for the English?'\r\n\r\n'That must be the shop,' quoth Brick.\r\n\r\n'That's the place,' pointing with her finger to a house on the opposite\r\nside of the way.\r\n\r\nVan Brick crossed over, and after five minutes' hunt over the whole\r\nhouse, was coming down disheartened, when he saw a pretty girl, about\r\neighteen years old, standing by the doorway.\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me where the bath is?'\r\n\r\n'_Seguro!_ I attend to them. You can't have a warm bath for two or three\r\nhours yet, for there is no fire; but you can have a cold one.'\r\n\r\n'Well, let me have it as quickly as possible.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. We have no soap for sale, but you can get it two doors off.'\r\n\r\nVan Brick went out, and after a time returned with a cake of soap.\r\n\r\n'Signore,' said the girl, when he went back, 'the water is all running\r\nout of the hole in the bottom of the tub, and I can't stop it.'\r\n\r\n'H'm! Show me the tub; I am a splendid mechanic.'\r\n\r\nThe hole being stopped, the tub was rapidly filling with water. Van\r\nBrick, in anticipation, was enjoying his bath; when in rushed the\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\n'Signore, you will have to wait a few minutes--until I wash some\r\ntowels.'\r\n\r\nVan Brick was in extremis. Taking a gold scudo, one of those dear little\r\none-dollar pieces the Romans call _far-fálle_ (butterflies) from his\r\npocket, he thus addressed her:\r\n\r\n'Maiden, rush round the corner and buy me a yard of any thing that will\r\ndry me; I don't care what it is, except salt fish.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! but these English are bursting with money,' thought the girl, and\r\nthus thinking, she made great haste, only stopping to tell three or four\r\nfriends about the crazy man that was round at her place, who didn't want\r\nsalt fish to make him dry.\r\n\r\n'Behold me back again!' said the girl, 'I flew.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Van Brick, 'and so did time; and he got ahead of you about\r\nhalf an hour. Give me the towels.'\r\n\r\n'Si, signore, behold them! See how fine they are! What an elegant fringe\r\non them; and only twenty-five baiocchi a piece, fringe and all\r\nincluded.'\r\n\r\nVan Brick, at last left in peace, plunged into the bath.\r\n\r\nWhen he came out, he found he had half a scudo to pay for the water,\r\nhalf a scudo for towels, quarter of a scudo for soap, and another\r\nquarter scudo for a _buono mano_ to the bath-girl. Total, one dollar and\r\na half.\r\n\r\n'Now,' soliloquized Van Brick, as he dressed himself, 'I have an\r\narithmetical question to solve. If a Roman, by hard scratching, can earn\r\ntwenty cents a day, and it costs him twenty-five cents for board and\r\nlodging, how long will it be before he saves up a dollar and a half to\r\ntake a bath? But that intelligent maiden will tell me, I know.' He asked\r\nher.\r\n\r\n'Signore, the Romans never bathe.'\r\n\r\n'You mean the Catholic Romans, for the Pagan Romans didn't do any thing\r\nelse.'\r\n\r\n'They're all burning up in the _inferno, Seguro_!' said the maiden.\r\n\r\n'But they had fifteen aqueducts to keep them cool when they were alive,'\r\nspoke Van Brick.\r\n\r\n'_Chi lo sa_. We have three aqueducts, we Romans, and we have more\r\nwater, yes, more water than we can--drink.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, while there's wine about. _Adio, bella ninfa!_'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLANCES FROM THE SENATE-GALLERY.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe considered, in the last number of THE CONTINENTAL, some of\r\nthe leading orators and statesmen who, in the last Congress, represented\r\nthe States now in rebellion against the Constitution. It can not be\r\ndenied that, by their secession from the floor of the Senate, that body,\r\nwhich undoubtedly exhibits the best specimens of American eloquence, was\r\ndeprived of several of its fairest ornaments; but we believe that a\r\nconsideration of those Senators who remained faithful to the interests\r\nof their country, will discover the fact that in them was displayed at\r\nleast equally conspicuous merit in oratory and legislation. A distinct\r\ncontrast was discernible between Northern and Southern eloquence; the\r\nlatter being of an impulsive and passionate character, unadorned\r\ngenerally by the graces which mental culture lends to that art, (which\r\nmight be inferred from their well-known temperament,) while the former\r\nappears to be more deliberate and thoughtful, indicating by its elegance\r\nand harmony the refining and systematizing influence of education, and\r\npartaking of the natural phlegm peculiar to inhabitants in colder\r\nregions. While Southern eloquence seemed to endeavor to elicit feeling\r\nand passion, Northern orators looked for their success rather to the\r\nconviction of the understanding than to the indulgence of the weaker\r\nelements of human nature. By pleasing and subtle sophistries, by\r\nenthusiastic ebullitions of resentment and indignation, or by the more\r\namiable contrivances of patriotic and virtuous sentiment, Benjamin and\r\nDavis sought, if they could not convince legislators, at least to\r\nattract to their peculiar doctrines the impulsive and credulous masses\r\namong their own people. On the contrary, it was apparent that Northern\r\nstatesmen, confident in the exercise of intellectual resources, relied\r\non the intelligence and reason of their auditors and constituents, and\r\nseldom resorted to that species of oratory which was employed by their\r\nadversaries, and which may be called in a manner strategetic, when\r\nlogical accuracy was likely to meet with more satisfactory and more\r\npermanent success. Before we proceed to notice the eminent Senators from\r\nthe North, we propose to dwell briefly upon several who, though\r\nrepresenting slave States, were, in the last Congress at least, loyal to\r\nthe Government; several of whom, however, are now engaged in treason,\r\nwhile others remain true to their allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe person who, both from the position he held in the Senate and from\r\nhis imposing personal appearance, first attracted the attention of the\r\nvisitor, was the Vice-President, Breckinridge, of Kentucky. His later\r\ntreachery has made him justly the object of bitter popular odium,\r\ninasmuch as his delinquency was aggravated by his former professions of\r\nloyalty. It was hoped by many who had witnessed his early elevation to\r\nthe highest dignities, his undoubted ability both as an orator and as an\r\nadministrative officer, and his apparently manly and ingenuous bearing,\r\nthat talents which promised to be of so great service to his country\r\nwould, in the approaching struggle, be exerted in behalf of its entirety\r\nand honor. Southern 'chivalry' in him was exhibited in a nobler and more\r\namiable light than in his more petulant and less generous colleagues. A\r\ncertain graceful dignity was united with the most attractive felicity of\r\nmanner, and one could not help regarding him, when viewed in private\r\nsociety, as a perfect model of a gentleman. His courtesy and delicacy\r\nwere exhibited to all alike, and strangers could not help admiring one\r\nwho had at so early an age been raised to so giddy a hight, and yet who\r\nhad retained such condescension of manner and such continual good-nature\r\nto every body who approached him. His personal appearance, as we have\r\nalready said, was highly imposing; in which was combined a manliness of\r\ndemeanor and a strikingly handsome countenance and figure. His peculiar\r\nfitness as a presiding officer made him popular in that capacity.\r\nSeldom, indeed, has a Vice-President occupied the chair with such\r\nperfect ease and such stately dignity. His oratory was worthy of a\r\nSenator, elevated, earnest, and partaking less of passion and rancor\r\nthan other Southern speakers; but it rather lacked the substance and\r\nsolidity which a maturer stage of life would undoubtedly have given to\r\nit. He seemed to be a fair representative of the Kentucky aristocracy,\r\npossessing a delicate sense of honor, a bold spirit, though hardly\r\nenthusiasm of soul. Evidently absorbed in a selfish ambition for power,\r\nthis fault is in some degree palliated by the circumstance of the early\r\nage at which he was promoted to the public counsels. That this passion,\r\nunduly encouraged, has led him into a deplorable and fatal mistake, is\r\nnow evident; and from what we have recently heard of him, we doubt not\r\nthat a similar conviction has made him wretched and desperate.\r\n\r\nThe father of the Senate, Mr. Crittenden, so well known during the last\r\nweeks of his term as the would-be pacificator, by compromise, of the\r\nimpending rupture, was the last of the generation of statesmen of whom\r\nWebster and Clay were the leading cotemporaries. His long service in the\r\nnational legislature procured him on all occasions a respectful and\r\nattentive hearing, and were it not for this circumstance, the earnest\r\nimpressiveness of his declamation, at times relieved by sparks of\r\nold-fashioned wit, would have attracted the notice of his auditors. He\r\nwas singular in his personal appearance, and a peculiarly fierce\r\nexpression of face frequently gave an erroneous idea of his character,\r\nwhich was, making allowance for age and a life of turmoil, affable and\r\ngood-natured. He always reminded us of the portraits of Lord Chancellor\r\nThurlow, whose bushy eyebrows and stern countenance used to terrify\r\nyoung barristers in Westminster eighty years ago. Rather negligent in\r\nhis dress, and far from elegant in manner, he would hardly be noticed at\r\nfirst as one of the leading members of the body. As a lawyer, he has\r\nbeen acute and learned; as a statesman, generally able, though hardly\r\nprofound; as an orator, not graceful, but forcible and earnest. His\r\npatriotism was, no doubt, zealous and entirely disinterested; but\r\ncertainly ill-directed, and not adapted in the application it made of\r\nprinciples to the exigencies of the times. Representing the most\r\nrespected and most prosperous of slave States, and being considered in a\r\nmanner as the statesman upon whose shoulders had fallen the mantle of\r\nthe illustrious Clay, his influence was considerable, both with\r\nadherents and antagonists.\r\n\r\nWith sincere satisfaction, we turn to contemplate the character of a\r\ntrue-hearted and undaunted Southern patriot, Andrew Johnson, of\r\nTennessee. Coming as he did from a section in which secessionism\r\npredominates, and representing a mercurial and sensitive people, he\r\nstood out fearlessly and zealously in behalf of the maintenance of the\r\nUnion at all hazards. He is an admirable example of the self-made man,\r\nhaving received no education in his youth, and owing to the application\r\nof maturer years the historical and political information he now\r\npossesses. Born and bred among the lower classes of society, and\r\nengaging in an occupation suited to his humble sphere, by perseverance\r\nand patience and a very superior natural ability, he has won a deserved\r\nplace in the United States Senate. He is universally considered as one\r\nof the leading intellects in that body, and by his speeches during the\r\nlast Congress, in which his enthusiasm as a patriot lent brilliancy and\r\nenergy to his naturally forcible declamation, he attracted to himself\r\nthe confidence and affection both of his auditors and of the country.\r\nHis personal appearance is rather ordinary, not at all imposing, and yet\r\nhis countenance indicates a sound judgment and a pure heart. His whole\r\nmanner is open and frank, his bearing that of a gentleman by nature, and\r\nsocially he is universally liked. His oratory is also of an ingenuous\r\ncharacter, calculated to impress one at once with his thorough honesty\r\nand humanity. Sometimes he rose to admirable passages of virtuous\r\nindignation and scathing rebuke, as he warmed with the subject of\r\nSouthern delusion, actuated by unprincipled leaders, and few of the\r\nSenators who sat on the Democratic side escaped from his truly\r\nformidable denunciation. Lane, of Oregon, a compound of conceit,\r\nridiculous ignorance, and servility to Southern masters, was totally\r\nannihilated by the sturdy Tennesseean, for his imbecile attempts to\r\nexcuse his pusillanimous submission to his chivalrous dictators. So\r\nsuccessful was he in conjecturing and exposing the designs of the\r\nmalcontent Senators, that the boldest of them feared to meet him in\r\nforensic discussion, and recoiled from the honesty and acuteness of one\r\nwho knew them and did not hesitate to hold them up to ignominy. Through\r\nall the dangers which have beset the neighborhood from which he came, he\r\nhas stood firm in the assertion of patriotic principles; nor to save his\r\nown household from disaster, has he yielded a jot to the demands of\r\ntraitor tyrants. At present, he is provisional Governor of Tennessee,\r\nand is doing good service in bringing that once-honored State back to\r\nthe folds of the Union. Of few public men can we say, what may be\r\nconfidently said of him, that he has shown himself ready to sacrifice\r\nevery private interest to subserve the interests of his country, and has\r\ngiven us a certain and practical example of a heroism unknown before the\r\npresent crisis to Americans, except in the colored narratives of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nSenator Green, of Missouri, was justly regarded as one of the clearest\r\nthinkers and speakers in the Upper House. Irregularity of life had\r\nsomewhat blunted what must once have been a very superior mind. His\r\nstatesmanship was of a high order; his oratory ingenuous, generally\r\ncourteous and conciliatory, and always entertaining, from its lucidness\r\nand keenness. He was decidedly popular in social circles, genial and\r\ngood-natured, and full of animal spirits. His excesses, indeed, rather\r\ntended to make him the more companionable, though they undoubtedly\r\nundermined an uncommonly fine intellect; and certainly nothing can be\r\nmore sickening than to see one so highly endowed, and who might command\r\nthe applause of listening senates, gradually sinking below the level of\r\nmanhood by habitual indulgences. In personal appearance, he was rather\r\nawkward, of an ungainly figure, his countenance not highly intelligent,\r\nbut cheerful and rather pleasing. After the ostracism of the great\r\nbulwark of Democracy, Douglas, from the councils of his party, Senator\r\nGreen became the leader of that side of the house, assuming the place on\r\nthe Committee on Territories made vacant by the Illinois statesman. As a\r\nmanager of party tactics, and as a bold, shrewd, and energetic leader,\r\nfew could equal and none surpass him. His rise to so high a\r\nconsideration among his political friends was rapid, but proved, in the\r\nevent, well deserved.\r\n\r\nWe have occupied more space than we had intended, in considering the\r\nSenators from the slave States, and will now attempt to speak of some of\r\nthe more prominent Northern statesmen, in this paper, and perhaps\r\ncontinue their consideration more at length in a future number.\r\n\r\nThe present Secretary of State was long regarded as the leading\r\nFree-Soil Senator, and after the present Republican party came into\r\nexistence, he naturally assumed a prominent position among its\r\nadvocates. In caution, in profound foresight, in coolness and affability\r\nof temper, and in perspicuity and logical shrewdness of oratory, he has\r\nbeen without a superior since the death of Webster. He somewhat\r\nresembles Earl Russell in the prudence and care with which he treats\r\npolitical questions, and the vigilance with which he notices every\r\nsymptom of popular tendencies and popular desires. His circumspection is\r\nconstant, and the imperturbability of his character enables him to be\r\never on his guard, and protects him from the enunciation of an unpopular\r\nidea. Never permitting himself to be annoyed at ever so bitter a taunt,\r\nperfectly self-possessed, and always mindful of the courtesy due to his\r\ncolleagues, and the respect due to the most dignified body in the\r\nnation, he has generally succeeded in completely disarming his less\r\nprudent antagonists. In general debate, his coolness and mental balance\r\nenabled him to cope with the most formidable opponents, and although at\r\ntimes the overwhelming eloquence of Douglas got the better of the more\r\nphilosophic orator, such an occurrence was rare, and a triumph was\r\ngained over him only by the greatest exertions of the greatest orators.\r\nHis labored speeches, as will be testified to by all who have perused\r\nthem, are rich in profound thought, a clear discernment and\r\ncomprehension of events, causes, and results, and occasionally in\r\npassages of stately and brilliant eloquence. Graceful rhetoric and\r\nshrewd logic appear to be ever at his command, as he has occasion, in\r\nthe course of argument, to resort to one or the other, to illustrate or\r\nto enforce his reasoning. In person, Mr. Seward is of about medium\r\nhight, rather stooping, with reddish-gray hair, an aquiline nose, and\r\ndull, sleepy, blue eyes. His countenance is hardly intellectual, and no\r\none would suppose, on seeing him for the first time, that he was a man\r\nof conspicuous ability. He is affable to every one, and enters freely\r\ninto conversation with all who call upon him; nevertheless, he is\r\nextremely guarded at all times in expressing his opinions, and will\r\nnever betray himself into an unguarded sentiment. His manner of speaking\r\nis extremely easy, and occasionally dull; and when in the Senate, he\r\nused to take his position by leaning against the pillar behind his seat,\r\ntwirling in one hand his spectacles, while with the other he enforced,\r\nby slight gestures, the more striking passages of his speech. His\r\ndelivery was far from animated, and his intonation was rather\r\nconversational than declamatory. He has a quiet dignity at all times,\r\nwhich is yet consistent with a polite and amiable demeanor; and while\r\nthe former inspires the respect, the latter elicits the esteem of all\r\nwho approach him.\r\n\r\nThe present Vice-President was, during the last Congress, Senator from\r\nMaine. He was long known as an able Democratic politician, and in 1856\r\nwas elected Governor of Maine by the Republicans, in a hotly-contested\r\nelection. He is remarkable rather for a sound judgment and practical\r\ngood sense than as an orator or in the higher arts of statesmanship. He\r\nwas always listened to with attention, because all looked upon him as\r\nwell informed in the everyday duties of the Senate, and as one whose\r\nopinion was formed from accurate observation and a clear head. He is in\r\nno sense an orator, his delivery not being pleasant or his sentiments\r\ncouched in graceful or forcible language. He is of a dark complexion,\r\nrather tall, with jet-black hair, a little bald, and would not be\r\nselected as one of the leading men in the Senate from his personal\r\nappearance. As a presiding officer, he ranks well, being apparently\r\nposted on parliamentary law and impartial in his decisions, although he\r\nhas not the dignity and grace which lent _éclat_ to Mr. Breckinridge's\r\nperformance of the office.\r\n\r\nSenator Fessenden, of Maine, is considered one of the first statesmen\r\nnow prominent before the country; and the ability he has exhibited, not\r\nonly in the practical details of his position but in the wider range of\r\ncomprehensive statesmanship, entitles him to a place superior to most\r\nand equal to any of his contemporaries. Since the retirement of Senator\r\nHunter from the Finance Committee, (which may be considered as the most\r\nimportant in the Senate,) Mr. Fessenden has executed the duties of its\r\nchairmanship with an accuracy and vigilance which has elicited the\r\npraise of all sides of the house. His superiority as a financier is\r\nmarked; but not more marked than his high capacity for comprehending and\r\nelucidating the great national issues, which swallow up all minor ones\r\nin the magnitude of their importance and the intensity of their\r\ninterest. For maturity of judgment, deliberateness of thought and\r\nmanner, fearlessness of speech, a presence of mind never lost, and\r\nbitterness of invective, no one ranks above him in the Chamber. His\r\noratory is of that substantial and yet spirited character which at once\r\nconvinces and interests and engages the attention of the mind, without\r\nwearying it by unrelieved exertion. Always the master of every topic on\r\nwhich he attempts to enlighten, he is neither foiled by the sophistries\r\nnor embarrassed by the bravadoes of his opponents. His eloquence is not\r\ndemonstrative, but calm, dignified, and earnest, apparently confident in\r\nthe correctness of his views, and yet cautious to avoid giving offense\r\nto others. He is always listened to with the utmost respect, and his\r\nopinions are of much weight among his political friends. His appearance\r\nis dignified and highly intellectual; his forehead being broad and\r\nindicative of great ability, and his general manner being in harmony\r\nwith the prominence and responsibility of his office. Never resorting,\r\nin default of argument, to the petty malice of personal abuse, his\r\ncourse has been liberal, consistent, and uniformly courteous. In private\r\nlife, he retains the dignity which appears to be natural to him; but is\r\nyet affable and sociable, attracting one alike by the rich products of\r\nthought and the courtesy of his manner.\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. Wade, Senator from Ohio, is a noble specimen of a self-made\r\nstatesman. He migrated, at a very early age, from New-England to his\r\npresent residence, being entirely without means and devoid of every\r\nthing except his own invincible spirit, with which to secure a\r\nlivelihood. The qualities which made him successful sooner than his most\r\nsanguine expectations taught him to hope for, appear in all their\r\nmaturity in the character of the Senator. A perseverance the most\r\nconstant, a firmness approaching to stubbornness, a courage which never\r\nfeared man, and a power of application wonderful in a mind disciplined\r\nonly by rude nature, are the component elements which have promoted him\r\nto and maintain him with conspicuous honor in the Senate of the United\r\nStates. His honest and intrepid advocacy of principle has won him an\r\nenviable position in his party, and no one possesses the entire\r\nconfidence of the country to a greater degree than he. He was\r\nparticularly prominent in the last Congress for the bluntness and\r\nseverity with which he handled the Southern Senators, and the little\r\nhesitation with which he exposed their delinquencies in the strongest\r\nlight. His harangues were full of impulsive, strong, and fearless\r\ninvective, and he never stopped to consider the delicacy of chivalrous\r\nsensitiveness, when treason and conspiracy were to be exposed. Probably\r\nno man was more feared by the other side of the Chamber, for he could\r\nneither be cowed by threats nor restrained within the limits of\r\npunctilious courtesy. He dealt with them in the plainest language, and\r\ncombined with powerful effect argument, sarcasm, and eloquent\r\ndenunciation. Strong sense is a leading feature of his character, and a\r\npractical wisdom which renders him eminently capable in the discharge of\r\ndetails. In private life, he is genial and always good-natured, ready\r\nfor a joke at all times, and enjoys his leisure hours with a zest which\r\nis quickened by previous earnest toil. Although as bitter and\r\nunconciliatory as any of his colleagues in his treatment of the Southern\r\nstatesmen on the floor of the Senate, he always manifested the utmost\r\ngood temper toward them in social intercourse, and was frequently seen,\r\nafter a sharp and irritating episode in debate, laughing and talking\r\nwith Green or Benjamin in the most cheerful manner imaginable.\r\n\r\nWe hope to present more sketches of Northern Senators in a future\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DITCH.\r\n\r\n  Where in the Southron's Fatherland\r\n  Is that last ditch--his final stand?\r\n  Is't where the James goes rolling by\r\n  Used-up plantations worn and dry,\r\n  Where planters lash and negroes breed,\r\n  And folks on oyster memories feed?\r\n  Oh! no, oh! no, oh! no, no, no!\r\n  To find it you must further go.\r\n\r\n  Where in the Southron's Fatherland\r\n  Is that 'last ditch,' his final stand?\r\n  Is't where the Mississippi runs\r\n  His mighty course for many suns,\r\n  To where New-Orleans fills the flat?\r\n  [Ben Butler's taken charge of _that_]\r\n  'Tis ours--to the Gulf of Mexico,\r\n  So that can't be the ditch, you know.\r\n\r\n  Where in the Southron's Fatherland\r\n  _Is_ that last ditch--his final stand?\r\n  Is it about Fort Donelson,\r\n  Where Floyd 'skedaddled,' _minus_ gun,\r\n  Packed up his traps and stole away\r\n  By night--as he had done by day?\r\n  Oh! no, oh! no, oh! no, no, no!\r\n  To find it you must further go.\r\n\r\n  Where in the Southron's Fatherland\r\n  Is that last ditch--his final stand?\r\n  Is it at Nashville, Tennessee,\r\n  Once more a city of the free,\r\n  Where Isham Harris and his tools\r\n  Thieved just two millions from the schools?\r\n  Oh! no, oh! no, oh! no, no, no!\r\n  To find it you must further go.\r\n\r\n  Where in the Southron's Fatherland\r\n  Is that last ditch--his final stand?\r\n  Is't at Montgomery, where in May\r\n  Hell's blackest tricks were put in play,\r\n  Where right and might were overruled,\r\n  And people into treason fooled?\r\n  Oh! no, oh! no, oh! no, no, no!\r\n  To find it you must further go.\r\n\r\n  Where in the Southron's fatherland\r\n  Is that last ditch--his final stand?\r\n  Is it at Charleston? Time shall prove\r\n  How much that precious nest we love,\r\n  When, crushed to dust and damned to shame,\r\n  We give the place another name.\r\n  Yet 'tis not there, I tell you, no!\r\n  Much further off its waters flow.\r\n\r\n  Where in the Southron's Fatherland\r\n  Is that last ditch--his final stand?\r\n  Is it at Natchez, high or low,\r\n  Or Newbern, where the pine-trees grow?\r\n  Is it where ladies 'dip' and snuff,\r\n  And white men feed on dirt enough?\r\n  Not there, not there; far down below\r\n  And further off its waters flow.\r\n\r\n  Where in the Southron's Fatherland\r\n  Is that last ditch--his final stand?\r\n  Knowest thou a stream folks call the Styx,\r\n  Round a plantation of Old Nick's,\r\n  In which, as Beauregard once swore,\r\n  His horse should drink when all is o'er?\r\n  There, there, my Southern friend, you'll find\r\n  A ditch exactly to your mind.\r\n\r\n  Ay, there in truth. God! can it be\r\n  That falsehood, sin and tyranny,\r\n  Though eighteen hundred years be past,\r\n  Still roar and revel wild and fast?\r\n  Well, let them rave; thou knowest the way--\r\n  'Tis darkest ere the dawn of day,\r\n  And well we know, whate'er befall,\r\n  Where runs the ditch to hide them all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATIENCE.\r\n\r\n  Patience! why,'tis the soul of peace;\r\n  Of all the virtues, the nearest kin to heaven.\r\n  It makes men act like gods. The Best of Men\r\n  That e'er wore earth about him was a Sufferer,\r\n  A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit,\r\n  The first true Gentleman that ever breathed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREWARDING THE ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a brave thing that we can truly say, after more than a year of\r\nfierce hostilities, the war in which this country is engaged goes on\r\nwith undiminished--nay, with increasing Northern spirit. The enemy has\r\nbeen obliged to resort to forced conscription, and to declare every man\r\nwithin its limits a soldier, while we have not as yet had recourse to\r\ndrafting; nor, as the late sudden call showed, nearly exhausted our\r\nvolunteers. A thousand, and even fifteen hundred dollars have been\r\noffered in Virginia newspapers for a substitute, and yet behind this\r\nthere has followed an Executive order for enrolling every man in the\r\narmy whether he have purchased a substitute or not. 'Our flag floats\r\nover Nashville and Natchez, over Memphis and New-Orleans, over Norfolk\r\nand Pensacola, over Yorktown and Newbern.' We have girded them in on the\r\nMississippi, on the Atlantic, and on the Gulf. We know that they are\r\ndestitute of almost every thing save mere food and arms, and that every\r\nmonth sinks them deeper and deeper in destitution and misery. The war is\r\non their own soil, and their own armies are a scourge and a curse to\r\ntheir own estates. Every where the plantation and the farm are made\r\ndesolate--every where the direst distress is taking the place of\r\ncomfort. And all this they brought on themselves by the most determined\r\nwill. They believed that Northern men were all cowards and\r\nhalf-traitors--their allies and friends among us promised them easy\r\nvictories and certain independence--they thought that the greed of money\r\nwas stronger among us than the sense of dignity and honor--and now they\r\nare reaping their reward.\r\n\r\nYet despite the bitter need into which they have brought themselves, it\r\ndoes not seem that those of the South who are in earnest have lost any\r\nof their desperation, or gained a better opinion of their foes. Their\r\njournals still trumpet the loudest lies and the mass still believe that\r\nsooner or later their shattered bark will outride the battle and the\r\nstorm, and float safely into the broad sea of independence. Would that\r\nthey could see the North as it is, in all its comparative prosperity,\r\nwith millions still left to volunteer, and with thousands of foreigners\r\neagerly seeking for places in the fray. We have found it necessary to\r\ninstruct our ministers and consuls abroad that we can not accept for the\r\npresent any more of the many military officers of different nations who\r\ndesire to fight for the stars and stripes. We have money in abundance,\r\nand there is no flinching at taxation--indeed, the great source of\r\napprehension at present is an excess of 'flush times' such as is too apt\r\nto bring on a reaction. When the war broke out we had, indeed, divided\r\ncounsels. The old Southern Democrats whined and yelped, and attempted\r\n'peace-parties' and the like; but they have vanished, and traitors now\r\nconfine themselves to less offensive measures, while their ranks have\r\nbeen woefully thinned. We may have disasters; nay, we can hardly hope to\r\nescape them. But in the present state of the war we may fairly boast of\r\nhaving the upper-hand. And the Northern tenacity which did not yield\r\nwhen misfortune lowered around, will not be likely to loose its hold now\r\nthat it has learned to measure its might, man for man, with the arrogant\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nUnder the wise and judicious policy inaugurated by President Lincoln, we\r\nsee Slavery, the great cause of this trouble, in a fair way to disappear\r\nin a manner which can give offence to no one. His 'remuneration\r\nmessage'--the shrewdest document which ever emanated from an American\r\nExecutive--shows itself, as events proceed, to be a master-stroke of\r\ngenius. The longer the cotton States prolong their resistance, the more\r\nprecarious does slave property become, and the more inclined are the\r\nmen of the tobacco States to sell their human chattels. Already in\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Maryland, and Delaware, people are longing to\r\n'realize' something on what bids fair to become altogether intangible\r\namid the turns and tides of skirmishes and battles. Meanwhile with every\r\nday's delay Emancipation, as a predetermined necessity, gains ground\r\namong the people, and very rapidly indeed in the army. It was the lowest\r\nand most tyrannical form of an aristocracy--that of slaveholding\r\nplanterdom--which caused and is still causing all this trouble, and it\r\nis beginning to work its way into the minds of the multitude that it is\r\nhardly worth while to risk every thing, and see the real criminals\r\nreïnstated after all in their privileges and possessions, when the one\r\ncan only serve to continue the old sore, while the other might be better\r\nemployed in free labor. And better employed, we may add, in rewarding\r\nthose noble men whose lives were risked in defense of our liberties.\r\n\r\nThis consideration brings us to the very important question: How shall\r\nwe reward our army, and what should be its future mission in the\r\nreconstruction which every freeman will be called to aid?\r\n\r\nThere is no use in disguising facts, shirking inevitable issues, or\r\ntrying to cheat either destiny or honest labor. We have got this\r\nquestion of rewarding our soldiers with the property of rebels, before\r\nus, and must meet it squarely. The pro-slavery Democratic press may\r\noppose it, as they have been doing, with all the malignity which their\r\ntreasonable friendship for the South may inspire; but we have an\r\ninevitable road before us over which we _must_ travel, and it would be\r\nwell to consider it betimes, that we may tread it fairly and smoothly,\r\nand not be dragged along shrieking, by a pitiless destiny.\r\n\r\nThere are two good reasons why we should begin to consider betimes, the\r\nexpediency of rewarding our army with Southern lands. The one is the\r\nnecessity of a future Northern policy; the other the claim of the army\r\nto such reward.\r\n\r\nIf when this war is concluded, our Government is to have a policy or a\r\nprinciple, it should manifestly be that of reïnstating itself in power,\r\nin consolidating that power, and in acting as a powerful unity,\r\naccording to the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. The\r\nCONSTITUTION--bear that word well in mind--the Constitution\r\nwhich suffers no State to usurp a single power belonging to the General\r\nGovernment, and which was expressly framed for the purpose of making all\r\nits freemen the citizens of one great nation. Let the reader consult the\r\nConstitution, study its unmistakable plan of national integrity and of\r\nstate subordination, and then reflect whether, according to its spirit,\r\nany and every mere state privilege which may be claimed should not yield\r\nto the paramount claim of _the Union_?\r\n\r\nIf this war has demonstrated any thing, it has been, firstly, the fact\r\nthat the South SHALL stay in the Union, and secondly, the folly\r\nof permitting the old Southern system to control us in politics, in\r\nsocial life, and in every thing. We have had enough of it. Manufactures,\r\nfree labor, science, schools, the press, learning, new ideas, social\r\nreforms, the whole _progress_ of the age, inspiring twenty millions, can\r\nno longer be cuffed and scouted in the Senate and snubbed in the _salon_\r\nor public meeting by the private interests of half a million of the most\r\nilliberal and ignorant conservatives in existence. Henceforth the North\r\nmust _rule_. 'Must' is a hard nut, but Southern teeth must crack it,\r\nwhether they will or no. We may shuffle and quibble, but to this it must\r\ncome. Every day of the war renders it more certain. The farm must\r\nencroach on the plantation, the rural nobility give place to the higher\r\nnobility of intelligence; social culture based on mudsills must make way\r\nfor the mudsills themselves--for lo! the sills which they buried are not\r\ndead timber, neither do they sleep or rot--they were fresh saplings,\r\nand with the reviving breath of spring and at the gleam of the sun of\r\nfreedom, they will shoot up into brave, strong life.\r\n\r\nLet them talk, dispute, hem and haw, that will--we can not set aside the\r\ngreat fact that in future our Government will be united in its policy,\r\ngreat in its strength, and no longer impeded by the selfish arrogance of\r\na petty planterdom. Labor and capital are bursting their bonds--the\r\nMiddle Class of North-America which Southerners and Englishmen equally\r\nrevile, is becoming all-powerful and seeks to substitute business\r\ncommon-sense for the aristocratic policy which has hitherto guided us.\r\nIt is no longer a question of radicalism, of poor against rich, of\r\nlazzaroni and royalists, but of a new element--that of labor and of\r\nintellect combined--the guiding-spirit of the North. And the question\r\nis, how to best aid this element in its progress?\r\n\r\nThe army of the United States at the present day contains within itself\r\nthe best part of such free labor and intellect as is needed to reform\r\nthe South. That dashing and daring energy which gladly enters on new\r\nfields, and loves bold enterprises, has streamed by scores of thousands\r\nfrom the farm and factory toward the camp and the battle-field. There it\r\nis doing brave service for God and for freedom. Every day sees martyrs\r\nfor the holy cause drawn from the ranks of these good and noble\r\nvolunteers. They die noble--ay, holy deaths, and as they die new\r\naspirants for honor step forward to fill their places. When the war\r\nshall be over, it is to the army that we should look to revive the\r\nwasted South, to farm its exhausted plantations and employ its blacks.\r\nIs there no significance in the numerous anecdotes which reach us of\r\nNorthern intellect already displaying itself in a thousand forms of\r\nrestless activity? The newspaper before us states that General Shepley,\r\nin New-Orleans, has threatened that if the bakers of his conquered city\r\ndo not supply bread more cheaply he will remodel their whole business\r\nand employ bakers from the army. 'Bakers from the army!' Ay, smiths,\r\nengineers, editors, and every thing else are there, amply capable of\r\nreörganizing the whole South--of tilling its fields to greater\r\nadvantage, of developing its neglected resources, of making the old,\r\ndesolate, lazy, dissolute Southland hum with enterprise. Let them do it.\r\n\r\n_We_ may as well do it betimes with a good grace, for it is very\r\ndoubtful if those who venture to oppose the settlement of our soldiers\r\nin the South, will not stir up such a storm of trouble as this country\r\nnever saw. An army of half a million after a year or two years of\r\nbattle-life, will not calmly return to its wonted avocations,\r\nnotwithstanding all that has been said to that effect. A warrant for\r\nWestern lands, which will possibly bring a hundred dollars, will seem\r\nbut a small matter to men who have seen unlimited paths to competence in\r\nthe rich fields of the South. They will not comprehend why the enemy\r\nshould be allowed to retain his possessions while they themselves have\r\nbeen thrown out of employment. There is to be some end to this\r\nprotecting the rights and property of rebels. And it is very certain\r\nthat a vast number of those who were non-combatants will perfectly agree\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to see the process of reconstruction going on so well in\r\nNew-Orleans under the bayonets of our troops. But neither in New-Orleans\r\nnor elsewhere has it any vitality save under Northern direction, aided\r\nby Northern industry. The hatred of the South for the old Union is\r\ninsane, terrible, and ineradicable. The real secessionists will never\r\ncome back, they will never be conciliated. They will oppose Union,\r\noppose free labor, hinder our every effort to benefit them, and be our\r\ndeadly foes to the last. We might as well abandon now and forever any\r\nhope of reconstruction to be founded on reformed secessionists. A large\r\nparty there is--and it will, if properly protected, become much\r\nlarger--who will join the Union for the sake of preserving their\r\nproperty. _But this party will not be increased a single man by our\r\nneglecting to punish those who have been active rebels_, while on the\r\nother hand it will dwindle to nothing if left exposed to temptation and\r\nenmity. We must proceed with the utmost energy, and our only hope is in\r\na complete reörganization of the South, by infusing into it Northern\r\nblood, life, ideas, education, and industry. And the only effective\r\nmeans of doing this will be to settle our army in the South. The task\r\nbefore us is a tremendous one, but so is the war, and we must not flinch\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nWe have come to an era of great ideas and great deeds, such as rarely\r\novertake nations in history, and which when they do, either crush them\r\nto the dust or elevate them to the topmost pinnacle of glory. Petty\r\nexpediency, timid measures, small politics, will no longer help this\r\ncountry. There is a great cause of evil in America--slavery--which is\r\ndestined to disappear, and which _will_ disappear whether we legislate\r\nfor or against it. It _is_ disappearing now under the influences of the\r\nwar. Beyond it lies the equally great evil of Southern hatred, inertia,\r\nlaziness, ignorance, and depravity. We must learn to live in the great\r\nideas of making all this disappear before superior intelligence,\r\nindustry, and humanity. The great principles of free labor, scientific\r\nreforms and culture, the enlargement of capital, the feeding and\r\nteaching the poor, should become as a deep-seated religion in our\r\nhearts, and we should live and labor to promote this great and holy\r\nfaith which is in reality the practical side of Christianity--that great\r\nshield of the poor. To extend these doctrines over the whole continent\r\nis a noble mission, and one not to be balked or hindered by foolish\r\nscruples or weak pity for a pitiless foe.\r\n\r\nHe who can raise his mind to the contemplation of the government of\r\nNorth-America, ruling over a perfectly _free_ continent, may see in the\r\nfuture such a picture of national greatness as the world never before\r\nrealized. _Every_ State attracting the eager labor of millions of\r\nemigrants--for there will be no cause in future for the foreigner to\r\ncarefully shun the slave hive--the native American directing as ever the\r\nenterprises--one grand government spreading from ocean to ocean--the\r\nwhole growing every year more and more united through the constant\r\nincrease of industrial interests and mutual needs--this is indeed a\r\nfuture to look forward to. And it is no idle dream. It will be something\r\nto be an American when we count one hundred millions of _united_\r\nfreemen.\r\n\r\nThe first step in this advance lies right before us. It will be in\r\n'Northing' the South and in completely sweeping away, by means of free\r\nlabor and free schools every trace of the foul old negro-owning\r\narrogance. And to do this we must begin by finding or making a way to\r\ninduce a large portion of the army to remain in the South and reform it.\r\nIt is a grand scheme, but we live in the day of great deeds, and should\r\nnot flinch from them.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, tolerably clear to him who looks to the future, that\r\nwhether we boldly embrace this scheme or not, it will force itself upon\r\nus or else entail some great disaster. It is more to our interest to\r\nreward the army with Southern land-grants than it is even for theirs to\r\naccept them. The longer we bolster up in its possessions an insolent\r\nenemy, so much the longer shall we have to support an army and pay\r\ntaxes. The sooner we weaken the enemy by introducing industrial rivals\r\ninto his country, the better it will be for us.\r\n\r\nIf it be difficult to settle our army all over the South, let there be\r\nat least a vigorous beginning made in Texas, and other States. With\r\nTexas thoroughly colonized from the North and from Europe, sedition\r\nwould be under constant check, and its boasted cotton supremacy\r\ncompletely held in by an unlimited rival supply of free-labor cotton.\r\nEvery Southern port should be held and governed as New-Orleans is now\r\nbeing treated. In due time there would spring up a new generation of\r\nSouthrons who would think of us as something else than cowardly,\r\nvulgar, stingy serfs, and learn that social merit is conferred not by\r\nbeing born on this or that piece of 'sacred' dirt, but by full\r\ndevelopment and exercise of the talents with which God has gifted us.\r\n\r\nBut to do all this there must be _no flinching_. This is not the time to\r\nprate of the 'unrepresented rights' of traitors, or wince at the\r\nprospect of reducing to poverty the men who have labored for years to\r\nreduce us to utter ruin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN McDONOGH THE MILLIONAIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1850, and for nearly forty years previous, there could be\r\nseen almost every day in the streets of New-Orleans, a very peculiar and\r\nremarkable looking old gentleman. Tall and straight as a pillar, with\r\nstern, determined features, lit up by eyes of uncommon, almost unnatural\r\nbrilliancy, with his hair combed back and gathered in a sort of queue,\r\nand dressed in the fashion of half a century ago, to wit, an old blue\r\ncoat, with high collar, well-brushed and patched but somewhat 'seedy'\r\npantaloons, of like date and texture, hat somewhat more modern, but\r\nbearing unmistakable proof of long service and exposure to sun and rain;\r\nold round-toed shoes, the top-leathers of which had survived more soles\r\nthan the wearer had outlived _souls_ of his early friends and\r\ncompanions; a scant white vest, ruffled shirt, and voluminous white\r\ncravat, completed the costume of this singular gentleman, who, with his\r\nancient blue silk umbrella under his arm, and his fierce eye fixed on\r\nsome imaginary goal ahead, made his way through the struggling crowds\r\nwhich poured along the streets of New-Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe last time this strange and spectral figure was seen making its\r\naccustomed rounds was on the twenty-sixth of October, 1850. On that day,\r\na very remarkable event occurred, which attracted the notice of\r\npassers-by and was even snatched up as an item by the ever-vigilant\r\nreporters of the daily press; this consisted simply in a notable\r\nvariation from the routine and habits of the old gentleman in the\r\nlong-tailed blue. He was seen to stop on Canal street, to hesitate for a\r\nfew moments, and then deliberately enter an omnibus bound for the lower\r\npart of the city. Such an occurrence created quite a sensation among\r\nstreet-corner gossippers. There must really be some new and pressing\r\nemergency, which could produce this departure from the custom and\r\ninvariable habits of forty years; so said every one who knew the old\r\ngentleman. The omnibus stopped at the court-house; the subject of these\r\nobservations and his blue umbrella emerged from it, and both soon\r\ndisappeared in the corridor leading to the so-called halls of justice.\r\n\r\nThat was the last that was ever seen of the strange old gentleman on the\r\nstreets of New-Orleans. The evening journals of the next day contained\r\nthe following obituary:\r\n\r\n     'Died this morning, the twenty-seventh of October, 1850, at\r\n     McDonoghville, opposite the city of New-Orleans, after a short\r\n     illness, John McDonogh, a native of Baltimore, but for forty years\r\n     a resident of Louisiana.'\r\n\r\nAnd the strange old man, who could not ride a few squares in the omnibus\r\nwithout attracting the attention of every body and exciting public\r\ncuriosity to such a degree, was the millionaire, the Croesus of the\r\nSouth, the largest land-owner in the United States. He had reached the\r\nadvanced age of seventy, and his remarkable vigor and health had never\r\ngiven way under the pressure of the severest and most incessant labor.\r\nGeneration upon generation had lapsed into the grave under his eye. A\r\nfew, a very few shriveled old men were known to him as cotemporaries.\r\nSuddenly, while pursuing so eagerly his imaginary goal, he was seized\r\nwith faintness on the street. Other men would have taken a cab, and\r\nridden home, or at least to a physician's; but when did John McDonogh\r\nturn aside from business to relieve any weakness or want? He had an\r\nimportant document to file in court. It must be done that day. He is too\r\nweak to walk. There is the omnibus; the fare is only a dime; but that\r\ndime is so much taken from the poor, for John McDonogh is only an agent\r\nfor the poor, so appointed and called of God. Such were the reflections\r\nthat passed through his mind before he could be induced to perpetrate\r\nthis serious violation of the settled rules of a life, this single blot\r\nand stain on a career of unbroken self-abnegation. With a sigh, he took\r\nhis seat in the omnibus.\r\n\r\nIt was his last ride.\r\n\r\nIn a cold, desolate, dreary, brick building, constituting almost the\r\nonly visible sign of the existence of the town of McDonoghville, situate\r\non the right bank of the Mississippi, opposite to the centre of\r\nNew-Orleans, and in a large room, the furniture of which was\r\nold-fashioned, worn, and time-stained, there lay on a small hard\r\nmattress the gaunt figure of the millionaire, tortured with pain and\r\nfast sinking under the ravages of that terrible disease, the Asiatic\r\ncholera. The only beings near were negroes; no white persons were ever\r\nallowed to spend the night under that roof. Those negroes were the rich\r\nman's slaves in law, but companions and friends in fact. His immense\r\nbusiness, his vast estates were administered through them. Even his\r\ndocuments were copied by them. They were true to him in his moment of\r\ndistress and sickness. All that their limited knowledge of medicine\r\ncould suggest was done for his relief. At last, in disregard of his\r\ncommand, a physician was brought from the city, who pronounced his\r\ncondition a very critical one. The doctor's first demand was for brandy.\r\n\r\n'Massa, there an't bin no brandy in this house for twenty years,' was\r\nthe reply of an old, gray-headed domestic.\r\n\r\nA servant was dispatched to the nearest grocery; but it proved to be too\r\nlate. The dying man perceived his condition, and requested that his\r\nlawyer should be sent for. In an hour that gentleman arrived. He was\r\njust in time.\r\n\r\n'Roselins,' he said, addressing one of the most eminent of the lawyers\r\nof the New-Orleans bar, as he held his hand, 'You see I am going; you\r\nsee I am not afraid to die. Take care of the estate; 'tis not mine,'tis\r\nGod's and the poor's.' And thus, without a struggle, the soul of John\r\nMcDonogh passed to its Maker.\r\n\r\nHis death was truly a desolate one. No devoted relatives or friends\r\ngathered around his couch to cheer his last moments with those tender\r\ntokens of love and sorrow which so sweeten the otherwise bitter cup of\r\ndeath. No soft hand of woman smoothed his pillow or relieved the agony\r\nof pain and suffering by the timely opiate or emollient. No weeping\r\nlittle ones were there to cheer his heart with the assurance that on\r\ntheir dear pledges of affection his name and virtues will live after\r\nhim. His lawyer, physician, and his servants were the only witnesses to\r\nthe mortal agony of one who could have commanded troops of devoted\r\nfriends, and who possessed the qualities which might have adorned the\r\ndomestic and social circle.\r\n\r\nSo departed this life the rich and eccentric possessor of acres\r\nsufficient to have made a duchy or a kingdom, and of money adequate to\r\nthe maintenance of the dignity and power of such a position.\r\n\r\nBut if his death and funeral were attended by so few witnesses, an\r\noccasion quickly followed which was honored by the presence of a large,\r\neager, curious crowd. It was when his will was probated and read in\r\ncourt. Intense was the curiosity of the public to know what disposition\r\nthe eccentric old man had made of his enormous property. This feeling\r\nwas soon gratified. The will was produced. It was a curious document,\r\nwritten on stout foolscap by the testator himself, in a remarkably neat,\r\nclear hand, with the lines as close as type, and his autograph signed to\r\nevery page. Being an holographic will, under the law of Louisiana it\r\nrequired no witness. Ever since 1838, this will had lain among certain\r\nold papers of the deceased; and yet, during all this time, it had been\r\n'the thought by day and dream by night' of the devoted old millionaire.\r\nIn its preparation, he had consulted the most eminent lawyers and\r\nstudied the most approved law-books bearing on his grand scheme. Truly,\r\na curious, bold, and gigantic scheme it was. But let us to the will. In\r\na slow, solemn and impressive tone, the judge proceeded to read to an\r\neager and interested multitude this remarkable testament.\r\n\r\nAfter setting forth, in the usual form, his nativity, his present\r\nresidence, his belief in God and in the uncertainty of life, and that he\r\nhas no heirs living in the ascending or descending line, and directing\r\nan inventory of his property to be taken immediately after his death, he\r\nproceeds to bequeath to the children of his sister, a widow lady in\r\nBaltimore, a ten-acre lot in Baltimore, the usufruct to remain in the\r\nwidow, with six thousand dollars in cash. He then emancipates his old\r\nservants, ten in number, whom he designates. The rest of his slaves he\r\nprovides shall be sent to Liberia. Certain of them are to be sent after\r\nserving those who shall succeed to his estate for fifteen years. The\r\nslaves to be sent to Liberia are to be supplied with plows, hoes,\r\nspades, axes, clothing, garden-seeds, etc.; also with letters of\r\nrecommendation to the colonists, and with a copy for each of the volume\r\nof the Holy Gospel of the Old and New Testament, as the most precious of\r\nall the gifts we have it in our power to give or they to receive. The\r\nwill then proceeds to provide:\r\n\r\n     'And for the more general diffusion of knowledge and consequent\r\n     well-being of mankind, convinced as I am that I can make no\r\n     disposition of those worldly goods which the Most High has been\r\n     pleased so bountifully to place under my stewardship, that will be\r\n     so pleasing to him as that by means of which the poor will be\r\n     instructed in wisdom and led into the path of virtue and holiness.'\r\n\r\nHe gives all the residue of his estate to the corporations of\r\nNew-Orleans and Baltimore, in equal proportions of one half to each, for\r\nthe several intents and purposes set forth, and especially for the\r\nestablishment of Free Schools for all classes and castes of color,\r\nwherein they shall all be instructed in the knowledge of the Lord and in\r\nreading, writing, arithmetic, history, geography, etc., provided that\r\nthe Bible shall be used as one of the class-books, and singing taught as\r\nan art.\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the ingenious scheme which had engaged the constant\r\nthought and study of the testator for forty years, by which the grand\r\npassion of his soul for accumulation might survive the dissolution of\r\nhis mortal frame and still direct and control the acquisitions of his\r\nlife. Of his real estate, no part is ever to be sold; but it is all to\r\nbe let out on leases, never to exceed twenty-five years, to be improved\r\nby the tenants or lessees. At the expiration of those leases, the\r\nproperty is to revert, free of cost, to his estate, to be thereafter\r\nrented out by the month or year. All his personal property is to be sold\r\nand converted into real estate, the aggregate of which is styled his\r\ngeneral estate, which is 'to constitute' a permanent fund on interest,\r\nas it were, namely, a real estate, affording rents, no part of which\r\nfund (of the principal) shall ever be touched, divided, sold, or\r\nalienated, but shall forever remain together as one 'estate.'\r\n\r\nThe net amount of rents to be divided equally between the two cities, to\r\nbe applied as follows:\r\n\r\n1. An annuity for forty years of one eighth part, or twelve and a half\r\nper cent of the net yearly revenue of rents of the whole of the estate,\r\nto the American Colonization Society, provided the sum does not exceed\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars a year.\r\n\r\n2. For an asylum for the poor of both sexes, of all ages and castes of\r\ncolor, where they may be sheltered, clothed, fed, and taken care of,\r\nmade useful according to their respective degrees of health, strength,\r\nand capacity, and mendicity thereby be banished from the streets of the\r\ncities, he gives one eighth, or twelve and a half per cent of the net\r\nrevenue of rents, until the sum shall reach six hundred thousand\r\ndollars, when it shall cease. This legacy is to be received by\r\ncommissioners appointed by the corporations, who, as they receive, shall\r\ninvest the amount in bank stocks or other good securities, on landed\r\nestate on interest, so as to augment the amount thereof by the\r\naccumulation of interest to the largest possible amount up to the time\r\nwhen the last of the annuity shall be received, when the commissioners\r\nshall proceed to take such part of said sum, not to exceed one third of\r\nthe whole of principal and interest, and invest in the purchase of real\r\nestate and buildings, furniture, etc., essential for the asylum; the\r\nresidue to be invested in real estate, which is never to be sold, but\r\nalways rented out for the support of the asylum. The locality and\r\ncharacter of the buildings are particularly described. It is recommended\r\nthat the persons who shall reside in this asylum be employed in the\r\ncultivation of the mulberry-trees, (this was during the _morus\r\nmulticaulis_ mania.)\r\n\r\n3. For the Orphan Boys' Asylum in New-Orleans--an existing\r\ninstitution--one eighth, or twelve and a half per cent of the net yearly\r\nrevenue of rents. This annuity is to be set aside and deposited in some\r\nbank-paying interest, until it reaches four hundred thousand dollars,\r\nwhen it shall cease. This fund as it accumulates is to be invested in\r\nreal estate, which is never to be sold, but rented out, and the rents\r\ndevoted to the charity.\r\n\r\n4. For a School-Farm in the city of Baltimore, on an extensive scale,\r\nfor the destitute and the poorest of the poor of the city of Baltimore,\r\nMaryland; secondly, of every town and village of said State; and\r\nthirdly, of all the great maritime cities of the United States, of all\r\nclasses and castes of color, from four years to sixteen, where they\r\nshall be sheltered, lodged, clothed, fed, instructed in the Christian\r\nreligion, and a plain education given them, and taught husbandry\r\npractically, as well as the science of agriculture, providing that the\r\nBible shall be read and singing taught, especially 'divine psalmody,'\r\none eighth part, or twelve and a half per cent of the whole revenue of\r\nthe general estate, to be paid until it shall amount to three millions\r\nof dollars, when it shall cease. This sum, too, as it accrues, is to be\r\ninvested in real estate, until the whole amount of three millions is\r\nreceived. One sixth of the rents from this investment is to be applied\r\nto the purchase of the School-Farm, the other five sixths to be invested\r\nin lots in Baltimore, which shall be leased out and the rents applied to\r\nthe support of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe modes in which these various institutions are to be governed and\r\ndirected are then set forth in tedious detail, interlarded with many\r\nrather trite and moralizing reflections on the importance of having the\r\nyoung reared up in habits of virtue and industry. A complex system of\r\ngovernment is arranged, and great care taken that the funds thus\r\nbequeathed to charitable institutions shall never be controlled by the\r\ncorporations of the two cities. It is also provided, that\r\n\r\n     'No compromise shall ever take place between the Mayor, Aldermen,\r\n     and inhabitants of the city of Baltimore, in Maryland, and the\r\n     Mayor, Aldermen, and inhabitants of the city of New-Orleans, nor\r\n     shall any agreements be made between these two cities contrary to\r\n     the directions of the will. If such compromise or agreement be\r\n     made, these legacies shall be void, and the States of Maryland and\r\n     Louisiana shall receive the general estate half and half, for the\r\n     purpose of educating the poor of said States, and in case of any\r\n     lapse of the legacies to the cities, the States shall inherit the\r\n     general estate.'\r\n\r\nAfter these dispositions and directions, the testator proceeds:\r\n\r\n     'Now, with the view of setting forth and explaining more fully and\r\n     particularly (if it is possible) my desires and intentions as\r\n     expressed in the foregoing dispositions of this my last will and\r\n     testament, in relation to my general estate, I will add, that the\r\n     first, principal, and chief object I have at heart, (the object\r\n     which has actuated and filled my soul from early boyhood with a\r\n     desire to acquire fortune,) is the education of the poor (without\r\n     the cost of a cent to them) in the cities of New-Orleans and\r\n     Baltimore, and their respective suburbs, in such a manner that\r\n     every poor child and youth of every color in those places may\r\n     receive a common English education, (_based, however, be it\r\n     particularly understood, on a moral and religious one_, that is,\r\n     the pupils shall on particular days he instructed in morality and\r\n     religion, and school shall be opened and closed daily with prayer.)\r\n     And in time, when the general estate will yield the necessary\r\n     funds, (for in time its revenue will be very large,) over and above\r\n     what will be necessary to the education of the poor of those two\r\n     cities and their respective suburbs, it is my desire and request\r\n     that the blessings of education may be extended to the poor\r\n     throughout every town, village, and hamlet in the respective States\r\n     of Louisiana and Maryland, and was it possible, through the whole\r\n     of the United States of America.'\r\n\r\nAfter paying off all the annuities, which the testator thinks will be\r\ncompleted in forty years, the net annual revenue of rents of the general\r\nestate is to be equally divided, one half to each, between the said two\r\ncities of Baltimore and New-Orleans, for the purpose of educating the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nThe testator then proceeds to inculcate a better feeling between the\r\npoor, and rich, declaring that the latter are 'reservoirs in which the\r\nMost High makes to flow the rich streams of his beneficence, to be laid\r\nup and husbanded for his all-wise and all-seeing purposes, and for\r\nseasons of distress and affliction to the poor. Instead, then, of\r\nlooking on them as their greatest enemies, they should, on the contrary,\r\nconsider them as they really are, their best friends. This is the\r\nposition of all rich men, whose hearts occupy the right place in their\r\nbosoms, stand toward the poor.'\r\n\r\nThen follows a remarkable and consoling confession of the superior\r\nhappiness of the poor man:\r\n\r\n     'Besides, let the poorer classes of the world be consoled, assured\r\n     that the labor-loving, frugal, industrious, and virtuous among them\r\n     possess joys and happiness in this life which the rich know not and\r\n     can not appreciate; so well convinced am I (after a long life and\r\n     intercourse with my fellow-men of all classes) of the truth 'that\r\n     the happiness of this life is altogether on the side of the\r\n     virtuous and industrious poor,' that had I children, (which I have\r\n     not,)' [how lively and sagacious the apprehension of the old\r\n     millionaire lest some putative offspring might come forward to\r\n     disturb his darling bequests!] 'and a fortune to leave behind me at\r\n     death, I would bequeath, after a virtuous education, (to effect\r\n     which nothing should be spared,) a very small amount to each,\r\n     merely sufficient to excite them to habits of industry and\r\n     frugality, and no more. As the poor man's friend, then, I recommend\r\n     to him to honor and respect the virtuous rich, and to lay these\r\n     observations to their heart and to store them up in their mind. And\r\n     to the rich, I would say, (if they own feelings, and worthy of\r\n     their regard,) 'Give them an occasional reflection.' Hoping\r\n     thereby, that the world may advance in happiness, in virtue, and\r\n     holiness.'\r\n\r\nLastly, the old man grows tender, sentimental, and poetic, He who for\r\nforty years had never been seen or known to manifest a single emotion of\r\ngentleness, of tender feeling or sentiment, of love of children, of\r\nnature, or any domestic affection, in his last will desires to be held\r\nin loving remembrance by the fresh young souls for whose benefit he\r\ndeclares he has led his long career of toil, of self-sacrifice, and\r\ndevotion, to gain. The association of sweet flowers, sprinkled over a\r\ngreen grave by the hands of innocent children, with the life and\r\ncharacter of one of the most intense, hard and severe devotees to Mammon\r\nthat ever lived, is a strange and incongruous one, but it was a picture\r\nwhich appears to have been very distinctly sketched on the imagination\r\nof John McBonogh, as will appear from the following clauses in his will:\r\n\r\n     'I request my executors (hereinafter named) to see that my funeral\r\n     is plain, made without parade, and with the least possible\r\n     expenses. And (I was near forgetting that) I have still one small\r\n     request to make, one little favor still to ask, and it shall be\r\n     the last: It is, that it may be permitted annually to the children\r\n     of the free schools (situate the nearest to the place of my\r\n     interment) to plant and water a few flowers around my grave. This\r\n     little act will have a double tendency: it will open their young\r\n     and susceptible hearts to gratitude and love to their divine\r\n     Creator for having raised up (as the humble instrument of his\r\n     bounty to them) a poor, frail worm of earth like me, and teach them\r\n     at the same time, what they are, whither they came, and whence they\r\n     must return.'\r\n\r\nSuch was John McDonogh's grand theory of philanthropy, which he had\r\ndevoted so many years of sacrifice, study, and labor, to mature and\r\nprepare.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the will, and inclosed in the same box, were certain\r\nmemoranda of instructions to his executors, who were distinguished\r\ncitizens of Baltimore and New-Orleans, including Henry Clay, of\r\nKentucky, and K. R. Gurley, of Washington City, These directions to his\r\nexecutors are very minute and specific. Certain observations in this\r\ndocument are worthy of being copied, as characteristic. His reasons for\r\npreferring to invest in land are thus stated:\r\n\r\n     'For the base of a permanent revenue, (to stand through all time,\r\n     with, the blessing of the Most High,) I have preferred the earth,\r\n     'a part of the solid globe.' One thing is certain, it will not take\r\n     wings and fly away, as silver and gold, government and bank-stocks\r\n     often do. It is the only thing in this world of ours which\r\n     approaches to any thing like permanency; or in which at least there\r\n     is less mutation than in things of man's invention. The little\r\n     riches of this world, therefore, which the Most High has placed in\r\n     my hands, and over which he has been pleased to place and make me\r\n     his steward, I have invested therein, that it may yield (its\r\n     fruits) an annual revenue to the purpose I have destined it\r\n     forever.'\r\n\r\nHe also states his motives, as follows:\r\n\r\n     'My soul has all my life burned with an ardent desire to do\r\n     good--much good, great good--to my fellow-man, as it was chiefly by\r\n     that means, and through that channel, that I could bend, greatly\r\n     bend to the honor and glory of my Lord and Master,--which was my\r\n     soul's first, great, chief object and interest.'\r\n\r\nHe says, however, he has much to complain of the world, and gives\r\ninstances of its injustice, especially in suits, where his just claims\r\nwere ignored because he was rich:\r\n\r\n     'They said of me: 'He is rich, old, without wife or child; let us\r\n     take from him, then, what he has.' Infatuated men! they knew not\r\n     that it was an attempt to take from themselves, for I was laboring,\r\n     and had labored all my life, not for myself, but for them and their\r\n     children. Their attempts, however, made me not to swerve either to\r\n     the right hand or to the left, although to see and feel so sorely\r\n     their injustice and ingratitude made me often lament the frailty,\r\n     the perversity, and sinfulness of our fallen nature. I persevered\r\n     in an onward course, determined, as the steward and servant of my\r\n     Master, to do them good whether they would have it or not. And I\r\n     have so strove, so labored, to the last. The result is in the hands\r\n     of Him who fixes and determines all results; he will do therewith\r\n     as seemeth good unto himself.'\r\n\r\nWho was John McDonogh, the maker of the foregoing will, and contriver of\r\nsuch a grand scheme of charity? The answer to this inquiry will be the\r\nmost interesting part of this narrative. John McDonogh was born in\r\nBaltimore, Maryland, in 1779. The only incidents of his youth that are\r\nknown are, that he was a clerk in a mercantile store in an inland town\r\nof Maryland; that he was noted then for eccentricities, and for an\r\nexcess of imagination, which led to the apprehension that he was not\r\nentirely of sound mind. Still his energy and intelligence secured him\r\nemployment and the confidence of his employers. About the year 1800 he\r\nwas sent out to New-Orleans by a house in Baltimore, with a letter of\r\ncredit and considerable resources. He engaged largely in business, but\r\nsoon renounced his agency, and starting on his own account, became a\r\nleading and prosperous merchant. In a few years he accumulated a large\r\nfortune--say at least three hundred thousand dollars--then a vast amount\r\nin the colony. He was one of the nabobs of the city. His style of living\r\nand habits conformed to his position and resources. His mansion was one\r\nof the most showy and luxurious in the city. He kept his carriages and\r\nhorses, his cellar of costly wines, and entertained on a scale of great\r\nextravagance and sumptuousness. He was, in fact, the centre of fashion,\r\nfrivolity, sociability, and even of the fashionable dissipations of the\r\nday. His person, which even in extreme old age was remarkable for\r\ndignity, erectness, and courtliness, at the period we write of, was\r\nconspicuous for all the graces of manhood. Indeed, he was styled the\r\nhandsomest man in the colony. That such a young man should attract the\r\nfavorable notice of ambitious Creole beauties who then composed the only\r\nfemale society in New-Orleans, of managing mothers, desirous of\r\nproviding for their daughters, or of fathers, who, in addition to the\r\nlatter motive, might also desire to secure a connection which might\r\npromote their own business prospects, was quite natural. The handsome\r\nAmerican merchant, with his still handsomer fortune, was, therefore,\r\nmuch courted. Though always gay, gallant, and polite, Mr. McDonogh\r\nproved for some time invulnerable to even the charms of Creole beauty.\r\nAt last there were indications that a young Orleanoise of fortune equal\r\nto his own, and of personal charms that were the theme of general praise\r\nand admiration, had captured the obdurate Croesus. This young damsel\r\nwas then emerging into sweet sixteen. She was the toast and heiress of\r\nthe city. Her name and family were among the oldest in the French and\r\nSpanish colonies. Her father was the venerable Senor Don Pedro\r\nAlmonastre, an old official under the Spanish government, who, by\r\nprudent investments, accumulated a large property in the very centre of\r\nNew-Orleans. He it was who donated the ground on which the Cathedral of\r\nSt. Louis now stands. It is for the rest of his soul that mass is\r\noffered up and the bells are tolled every Sunday afternoon in this\r\nvenerable temple.\r\n\r\nThe daughter and only child of Almonastre--her maiden name we\r\nforget--was born in the Colony, of a French Creole mother. She had\r\nattained the age of sixteen about the year 1811. It was then that Mr.\r\nMcDonogh's propositions for an alliance were favorably considered, and\r\nall the arrangements were made for the betrothal of the parties.\r\nSuddenly, however, a new actor appeared on the stage, who overturned\r\nthis well-arranged scheme. There resided in the city a grim, austere,\r\nand wealthy man, who had served in the French and Spanish armies, who\r\nwas noted no less for his ferocity and pride--which had been displayed\r\nin several sanguinary duels--than for his wealth. He had an only son, a\r\nhandsome, graceful, and fascinating young man, who, at the suggestion of\r\nhis father, and perhaps at the prompting of his own heart, stepped\r\nforward to lay his claims at the feet of the lovely heiress of\r\nAlmonastre. Fortunately for the cause of humanity, as will appear\r\nhereafter, though unfortunately for the American merchant, the young\r\nFrenchman supplanted him in the regard of the fair Creole.\r\n\r\nThe alliance of two such wealthy families as the Pontalbas and\r\nAlmonastres, was a great event in the city, and it was duly celebrated\r\nby many brilliant festivities, at the close of which the happy couple\r\ndeparted for Paris, accompanied by the father of the young man.\r\nPurchasing a splendid hotel in the Faubourg St. Germain, the Pontalbas\r\ngave themselves up to all the fashionable dissipations of that gay city.\r\nThe younger Pontalba was appointed by Napoleon one of his pages, with\r\nthe title of Count. Leaving them to continue their gay life, we return\r\nto New-Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe day after the marriage of Miss Almonastre to young Pontalba, there\r\nstepped into the office of an old auctioneer on St. Louis street, no\r\nless an individual than the rich and elegant American merchant, John\r\nMcDonogh, Esq.\r\n\r\n'Sir,' remarked the merchant to the auctioneer, at the same time handing\r\nhim a voluminous roll of paper, 'there is the inventory of my furniture,\r\ncarriages, horses, liquors, stores, plate, and all that pertains to my\r\nestablishment in Chartres street I desire you to sell them all for cash,\r\nimmediately. Accordingly in three days the extensive establishment of\r\nMr. McDonogh was all converted into money, to the great surprise and\r\ndeep regret of his many friends and guests. With the proceeds he\r\npurchased a small, lonely house, on the opposite bank of the river,\r\nwhere, with scarcely furniture enough to satisfy the most ordinary use\r\nand demands of humble life, he immured himself in perfect seclusion.\r\nFrom that period until his death--forty long years--he ceased to have\r\nany connection or association with the world except in the course of\r\nbusiness. He would neither dispense hospitality himself nor share that\r\nof others. Purchasing all the land around him, he placed himself beyond\r\nthe curiosity and annoyance of near neighbors. His negro servants alone\r\nwere permitted to reside in his house, and they were the depositories of\r\nthe secrets of his household, and acted as his clerks and agents in all\r\nhis transactions with the outside world.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus socially secluded and morose, Mr. McDonogh continued to\r\nprosecute his acquisition of property with augmented vigor and ardor. It\r\nwas about this time his passion for accumulating vast acres of waste and\r\nsuburban land began to manifest itself. All his views regarded the\r\ndistant future. The present value and productiveness of land were but\r\nlittle regarded by him. His only recreation and pleasure were in\r\nestimating the value of his swamp and waste land fifty, a hundred, and\r\neven a thousand years to come. This passion at last gained such an\r\nascendency over him that he seemed to court and luxuriate in waste and\r\ndesolation. He would buy cultivated places and allow them to go to ruin.\r\nHe would build on his lots in the city miserable shanties and rookeries,\r\nwhich would taint the neighborhood and enable him to buy out his\r\nneighbors at low rates. One of his favorite plans of operation was to\r\npurchase the back-lands of plantations on the river, the value of which\r\nwould be increased enormously by the improvements in front of them. So\r\nhe eagerly pounced upon all the lands in the neighborhood of the towns\r\nand villages in the State. One of the most brilliant of his feats in\r\nthis sphere was the completion of his lines of circumvallation around\r\nthe city of New-Orleans. For many years he pursued this object with the\r\ngreatest ardor and intensity. Commencing at the upper end of the city,\r\nhe stole gradually around through the swamps, purchasing large belts of\r\nland, until at last, a few years before his death, meeting one of his\r\nold friends in the street, he slapped him on the shoulder, and with his\r\nface full of enthusiasm and joy,--exclaimed: 'Congratulate me, my\r\nfriend; I have achieved the greatest victory of my life. I have drawn my\r\nlines around the city, and now entirely embrace it in my arms--all for\r\nthe glory of God and the good of my race.'\r\n\r\nDuring all this eager pursuit of acres there was never any manifestation\r\nof selfishness or of the ordinary repulsive characteristics of grasping\r\navarice. It is true, he was exacting, punctual, and opinionated. He\r\npursued his own course in all matters, but there was no misanthropy or\r\nharshness in his manner or deportment. He rarely gave for charitable or\r\nother purposes, for the reason that he would never sell any property he\r\nacquired, because he said it was not his; that he was only the steward\r\nor agent of God for certain great designs. His agency, however, did not\r\ninclude a power to sell. Hence he could not be induced by any offer or\r\nconsideration to alienate any property he had once acquired. Abstemious\r\nto a fault, withholding himself from all the enjoyments and associations\r\nof the world, he devoted his time to the care of his large estate, to\r\nthe suits in which such acquisitions constantly involved him, working\r\nfor seventeen hours out of the twenty-four, the greater part of which\r\nlabor consisted in writing the necessary documents relating to his\r\ntitles, in corresponding with his lawyers and overseers. For the fifty\r\nyears of his residence in New-Orleans, he never left the State, and\r\nrarely, if ever, passed beyond the limits of the corporation. It was\r\nwell known that he was entirely wrapped up in some grand scheme of\r\ncharity, the nature of which, however, was only known to a few lawyers,\r\nwith whom he consulted in regard to the legality of his proposed\r\ndispositions, though none of them knew the mode and form in which those\r\ndispositions were to be made.\r\n\r\nMcDonogh's scheme was certainly a grand one. In the execution of it, a\r\nman of his character and mind might well feel and display the\r\nextraordinary zeal and enthusiasm that gave to his appearance, habits,\r\nand conduct the characteristics of a monomaniac. Without ever once\r\nturning aside for pleasure, ambition, curiosity, affection, or enmity,\r\nhe steadily pursued his great design, until death released him from the\r\nsevere servitude to which he had bound himself. But, save in this entire\r\nself-abnegation and social exclusion, Mr. McDonogh had none of the\r\nhabits of the miser. He was not a usurer, a money-lender, or a\r\nspeculator. He did not extort his riches from the distresses and\r\nweaknesses of his fellow-men. He acquired by legitimate purchase, by\r\nentries on public lands. He dealt altogether in land. Stocks,\r\nmerchandise, and other personal securities were eschewed by him. The\r\nwonder is, how, with a comparatively small revenue, his property not\r\nbeing productive, and his favorite policy being to render his lands wild\r\nand unsuited for cultivation, he was able to go on every year expanding\r\nthe area of his vast possessions. Such enormous accumulations are not\r\nsurprising under the operation of compound interest on sums of money\r\nloaned; but when effected by purchases of unproductive lands, they\r\nconstitute a puzzle which the most intimate of Mr. McDonogh's friends\r\nhave found it difficult to unravel.\r\n\r\nSo much for the labor and practice of realities of the life of the\r\nmillionaire. We must not conclude our sketch without rounding off the\r\nromance of that life which is the starting-point in the strange career\r\npursued by him for forty years, with such ascetic severity and\r\nundeviating fidelity. What became of the betrothed of the gay and\r\nwealthy young American, from whom he had experienced the shock and\r\ndisappointment that threw so much gloom over and produced such a\r\nthorough change in his future life? She had left with her gallant young\r\nhusband, in bright hopes of a brilliant future. For some years their\r\nlife in Paris was one of gayety, pleasure, and joyfulness. In the course\r\nof a few years, the dissipations of Paris began to pall upon the taste\r\nof the young couple. With unbounded wealth and means of enjoyment, they\r\ngrew _ennuyéed_, discontented, and finally contentious. Jealousy, like a\r\nserpent, stole into their household, and involved the mind of the\r\nhusband in her snaky embrace. Rumors reached his ear which nourished\r\nthis passion, until it exploded in a violent and irreconcilable quarrel.\r\nOne of the chief instigators of the young Count, in this quarrel with\r\nhis high-spirited wife, was his own father, who, in the retirement of a\r\nchateau near Paris, grew daily more morose and misanthropic. He had\r\nheard that his son had been dishonored, and his rage and bitterness were\r\nunbounded. The son abandoned his wife's hotel, and repaired to his\r\nfather's chateau, where the two lived in seclusion and gloom. After they\r\nhad been separated for some time, the Countess was either enticed by\r\nlures thrown out by the elder Pontalba, or of her own accord resorted to\r\nthe chateau, for the purpose of consulting the Count relative to certain\r\ndispositions of their joint property, or certain arrangements for the\r\neducation of their children, of whom there were three. The son was not\r\nat home; but the father, receiving her in the hall, invited her into his\r\nstudy. In a few moments afterward, the servants in the chateau were\r\naroused by the report of a pistol, followed by the scream of a woman,\r\nand by another report; then all was silent. Rushing toward the study of\r\nMr. Pontalba, they forced the door open--it had been locked on the\r\ninside--and there a terrible spectacle was presented. The Countess lay\r\non the floor, bathed in blood, which gushed in torrents from a large\r\nwound in her breast, whilst her dress was burning from the nearness of\r\nthe shot by which the wound had evidently been inflicted. But a still\r\nghastlier object lay near. It was the body of the elder Pontalba, her\r\nhusband's father, who had blown off the top of his skull with a large\r\ndragoon's pistol, which he still grasped in his hand. Though insensible,\r\nit was discovered that the Countess was not quite dead. A surgeon was\r\nsoon obtained, and on examination it was discovered that though her\r\nwound was a terrible one--three buck-shot and one large bullet having\r\nentered her breast--yet there was some hope for her. After incredible\r\nsuffering and long confinement, she recovered; though to the day of her\r\ndeath she will feel the effects of the terrible wound, to which was\r\nadded the mutilation of her hand, which caught the bullet.\r\n\r\nThe causes and circumstances of that tragedy were never unveiled to the\r\nworld. Nor is there any great desire to penetrate the mystery. The\r\nCountess got well, and continued her fashionable life, appropriating a\r\nlarge portion of her great rental in New-Orleans to the purchase of\r\nproperty and the improvement of her elegant hotel in Paris. The\r\nRevolution of 1830 found the Countess a fierce Bourboniste, and produced\r\nsuch apprehension of confiscation, and danger to her life and liberty,\r\nthat she concluded to return to New-Orleans. Here she found that her\r\nproperty had greatly augmented in value, and after a short sojourn in\r\nher native city, discovering that Louis Philippe's dynasty was an\r\nunproscriptive one, she returned to Paris, where she resided until the\r\nRevolution of 1848 again filled her with alarm for her large\r\npossessions. Beside, she was well known to be a conspicuous Legitimiste\r\nof the party of Henry V. Again she returned to New-Orleans, full of\r\nhorror of Red Republicanism and Socialism, and with disgust for the\r\nfickleness of the French.\r\n\r\nDirecting her attention, with characteristic energy and ardor, to the\r\nimprovement of her property which incloses Jackson Square, the principal\r\npublic place in New-Orleans, she built some forty elegant houses, and\r\nthen assuming the government of the municipality, she succeeded in\r\ninducing the authorities to cut down the old trees on the square, and to\r\nhave it laid off in the parterre style. The 'Woodman spare that tree'\r\nsentiment strongly opposed this reform; but it was vain to resist the\r\nCountess. The trees obstructed the view of her fine rows of houses, and\r\ndown they must come, and down they did come, very much to the\r\nimprovement of the city, and to the full justification of the taste and\r\ngood sense of the Countess.\r\n\r\nAfter thus improving her property, and augmenting her resources, the\r\nCountess thought she might trust herself again in Paris, though a\r\nparvenu filled the throne which, in her view, was justly the property of\r\nthe elder branch of the Bourbons.\r\n\r\nBut before she left, an incident occurred which must close this\r\ndesultory sketch. It happened one day, while the Countess was in a\r\nnotary's office, for the purpose of signing some deeds, that a tall,\r\ngrave, and eccentric-looking old gentleman entered, and seeing the\r\nnotary engaged, took his seat to wait his turn. After completing her\r\nsignature of the deeds, the Countess, raising her eyes from the\r\nparchment, perceived that she was the object of close and keen\r\nobservation of the eccentric old gentleman with the very brilliant and\r\npiercing eyes. A single glance served to bring that face and form\r\ndistinctly back to her memory. Rushing up to the old gentleman, she\r\nthrew her arms around his neck, in an affectionate embrace, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n'Oh! Mr. McDonogh, is it you? I have not forgotten you during our long\r\nseparation.' And after a pause, her emotions checking her utterance, she\r\ncontinued: 'We were once betrothed; it would have been better for both\r\nif we had married. Is it too late to repair that fatal error?'\r\n\r\nFor the first time for forty years, the old man was deeply affected by a\r\ntender and human feeling. The ancient love was aroused from the deep\r\nrecess of his heart, where it had kin dormant and forgotten, and for a\r\nmoment triumphed over the passion which had been growing and expanding\r\nfor the half of his lifetime, until it had gained the entire mastery of\r\nhis soul. Greatly moved by this penitence of his once-loved betrothed,\r\nMr. McDonogh begged to be permitted to consult his better judgment, and\r\ntearing himself from the bewitchments of the Countess, he repaired\r\ninstantly to the office of his lawyer. Walking in with the appearance of\r\ngreat excitement, he paced the office of the lawyer in an anxious and\r\nexcited manner for some time, to the profound astonishment of his\r\nancient counselor. At last the cause of this emotion was explained,\r\nwhen, turning to his lawyer, Mr. McDonogh confessed that he was under a\r\ngreat excitement, produced by meeting his old love, the Countess. 'And\r\nwhat would you think now, R----, if I were to marry her?'\r\n\r\n'I should think,' replied the unsentimental counselor, 'that you had\r\nbecome crazy.'\r\n\r\n'Ah?' replied the millionaire interrogatively, and then pausing\r\nthoughtfully, he continued: 'And you would think right--you would think\r\nright; so let us to business.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELTER-SKELTER PAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn choosing a caption for the heterogeneous collection of reflections\r\nthat are likely to be the result of the 'present writing,' the\r\nsuperscriber makes no apology for his title not being also a topic to\r\nany further extent than its consideration in this paragraph. The object\r\nheld in view in giving _any_ name to the succeeding lucubrations was\r\nmerely to obtain a starting-point; it being conceded that the\r\ncommencement of a _tas_ of papers need have no greater influence on\r\ntheir course than the point of departure of a railroad-train exercises\r\non its terminus and intermediate stopping-places. To resort then to my\r\nheading or its derivations for any indication of my purpose in what may\r\nfollow, would be futile, and I am free to disclaim any premeditate\r\npurpose of governing my pen by either _hilariter_ or _celeriter_, save\r\nas accident may determine. This, at least, gives hope of variety in the\r\nconsequences of my present step; but whether spiciness will also ensue,\r\nwill depend entirely on the humor of the writer and the complaisance of\r\nthe reader hereof. So with no further introduction, the following\r\nchildren of my moods are presented for the kind consideration of those\r\nunder whose eyes they may fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n--HAS A MAN A RIGHT TO USE AN OLD PUN IN MAKING A NEW JOKE?\r\nThis was a question which arose in the Quidnuncs coterie the other\r\nevening, after Muggins had sent in the following, for the comic column\r\nof a weekly paper, the editor of which had returned it gratefully but\r\nfirmly, on the score of superannuation: 'If Truth lie at the bottom of a\r\nwell, why should we be surprised that so many kick the bucket before\r\nthey are able to reach it?'\r\n\r\nSlight sympathy was expressed for Muggins, but in my opinion that was\r\nowing rather to the depravity evinced in the particular attempt than to\r\nany condemnation of his conduct in making an old joke answer the purpose\r\nof a new one. I confess that I don't see why a good pun should be\r\nthrown aside after it has served as the soul of a single sentence. I am\r\na supporter of the doctrine of Transmigration of Puns. For a true pun\r\nalways has a humorous idea behind the verbal quip that is its prominent\r\ncharacteristic. And though the verbal quip may be 'old as the hills,'\r\nthe joke may present a face fresh as that of a young maiden and bear a\r\nmeaning merry as her eyes. Thus an adept in this art once renovated two\r\nveritable antiques:\r\n\r\n'I tell thee, Binks, that the proposition is incontrovertible; any thing\r\nthat is worth doing is worth being _well done_.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, brother Noggs, what hast thou to say to a beef-steak? Does\r\nnot thy rule fail thee there?'\r\n\r\n'Truly it doth, Binks; but thou wilt grant me that thine is a _rare_\r\nexception?'\r\n\r\n'That will I, right readily.' And both laughed heartily, and went their\r\nways.\r\n\r\n\r\n--'SIR, YOU ARE TREADING ON MY FAVORITE CORN,' was the mild\r\nprotest of one in a crowd against the act of a neighbor who had\r\nencroached on his pedal extremities, by attempting to violate the\r\nphilosophical axiom that two bodies can not occupy the same space\r\nsimultaneously. The remark raised a laugh; yet it involved a great\r\ntruth. Each of us has at least one pet infirmity, which we nurse as\r\nearnestly, with a view to its becoming chronic, (perhaps unwittingly,)\r\nas we strive earnestly to eradicate other morbid troubles. And the\r\nposition is true regarding moral as well as physical invalids. Who has\r\nnot often been doubly irritated by the removal of his source of\r\nirritation? Thus Paterfamilias Bloggs, having been 'riled' by the\r\novercrowding of the omnibus in which he proceeds homeward, makes up his\r\nmind that if Materfamilias B. has not provided fish-balls for supper, he\r\nwill 'raise a row.' And he so gloats in expectancy over the imaginary\r\ndenunciation that he will inflict on that long-suffering female, that he\r\nis quite disappointed, on entering his basement, to discover at a glance\r\nthat a dish of beautifully-browned fish-balls decks the evening table.\r\nSo Bloggs' wrath is smothered, and smoulders for the rest of the\r\nevening, finding insufficient vent in boxed ears for the children, and\r\nshort, crisp replies to civil questions from the older members of the\r\nfamily. Thus you see that removing a cause does not always do away with\r\na consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--WHO EVER GAVE A SATISFACTORY EXCUSE FOR AN INOPPORTUNE LAUGH?\r\nCertainly, no child transgressing in this particular ever failed to\r\nreceive less than ten-fold its due of punishment therefor, as many grown\r\npersons will join me in testifying. Especially is this true in instances\r\nof church cachinnation. I solemnly aver that I have felt a stronger\r\ntendency to hearty laughter in a church than I ever experienced in a\r\ntheatre, and yet I could not and can not give any satisfactory reason\r\nfor the inclination. I wanted to laugh for the child's reason,\r\n'Because.'\r\n\r\nNot many months since, in a land thousands of miles hence, I was\r\nstretched upon a bed of sickness. In pursuance of the humane duties of\r\nhis calling, the minister of the Episcopal Church called upon me, and\r\nafter a short conversation, proposed addressing the throne of grace.\r\nThis he did in a few eloquent extemporaneous phrases, closing with the\r\nLord's prayer. Now, from the outset, I felt an uncontrollable\r\ninclination to laugh; but for a time succeeded in restraining it. But\r\nwhen, in close succession upon the minister's words, there arose from\r\nthe next room (separated from us by a thin board partition) a sepulchral\r\necho in the voice of my room-mate, a grim and swarthy miner, who\r\nprobably had not heard the prayer since he repeated it after his mother\r\nat her knee, and from the still potent though long dormant force of\r\nhabit, now joined in its utterance, the incongruity of my surroundings\r\novercame me, and I electrified the worthy priest by bursting into a\r\nguffaw. Looking back on the scene, I can see far more pathos than humor\r\nin it; but at the time, the scene was to me irresistibly ludicrous. And\r\noh! the paltry excuse that I raked up. 'Nervousness,' I think. No\r\nmatter, I had 'spoiled the whole party and broke up the ball!' 'Tis\r\nalways the way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n--SOMEBODY HAS SAID THAT TO BE A SUCCESSFUL AUTHOR, IT IS ONLY\r\nNECESSARY TO FEEL WHAT YOU WRITE. This I deny, for many reasons\r\nwhich I might but will not cite, contenting myself with saying that to\r\nwrite what one feels, though much more gratifying and in a moral sense\r\nfar more commendable than to conceal or falsify sentiments, is\r\ndangerous, and has been known to cause a writer to feel not only more\r\nthan he wrote or could write, but more than he had any expectation or\r\ndesire of feeling in such connection. Thus, whenever under an assumed\r\nbut transparent title, I introduce my friend Scroggs into a little\r\nsketch of my production, I never express in that performance my actual\r\nestimate of Scroggs, physically or mentally. Nor in my glowing\r\ndescription of the incidents of a trip to Catskill Mountain House, do I\r\nconfine myself to the expression of what I felt in viewing the many and\r\nvaried scenes of rural beauty that presented themselves during the\r\nprogress of that undertaking. Do you suppose that I would run the risk\r\nof conveying to Claribella, who was my only companion in that\r\nexpedition, that I never was more bored in my life, and that my\r\nconversation was the result of operating with a constantly working\r\nthough invisible pump at the well of common-places and platitudes, which\r\na gentleman accumulates for such emergencies in the course of his social\r\nexperience? Heaven preserve my hair, should I venture on such a step.\r\n\r\n'But you digress,' some impatient reader suggests.\r\n\r\nDigress! That is an impossibility in an article without a topic. But\r\neven if I plead guilty, my impatient critic; did you ever take a walk in\r\nthe country, and if so, did you choose those broad roads that lead to\r\nchurches and the village stores and the 'Academy,' or did you plunge, by\r\nsome little modest path, into the recesses of a grove, careless whither\r\nyour steps carried you, so content you were to yield to the enchanting\r\nguidance of accident? And what though, in following your bent, you were\r\ncompelled to climb an occasional fence or cross a chance puddle, the\r\nsatisfaction of coming suddenly upon some pleasant view, or unexpectedly\r\nentering an apparently previously unexplored nook, more than atoned for\r\nsuch trifling annoyances. Without digression in some degree, neither\r\nspoken nor written language can be made entertaining to the person\r\naddressed. Who is more discursive than the Autocrat, the Czar of\r\ntable-talkers; and whose productions are more charming or wiser? We do\r\nnot do our everyday thinking in strictly logical or consistent forms. It\r\nis sufficient to introduce hypotheses, premises, or syllogisms, when\r\nthere are ends to be attained by such a course. Impulse is far more\r\nattractive than prim consistency in the character of those we love; and\r\nif this be true as to pet persons, why not in our favorite writings? So\r\nthe most charming women I have met would be styled in Spanish _las\r\ninconsecuentes_. Therefore, when amusement is the aim of writing, let\r\ndigression have full swing.\r\n\r\n\r\n--I ENVY A GOOD TALKER. There is no class of persons so\r\ngenerally underrated and vilified, yet this would be a dull world\r\nwithout them. And the faculty is not to be acquired. Really good talkers\r\nare born, not made. (And some, I hear a skeptic say, are not to be borne\r\nin certain contingencies.) Talk is like a river; it rushes onward, by\r\nexpression of ideas, _making room for thoughts_ to follow, and the dull\r\nelf, whose mouth is a mill-dam, finds his fancies and thoughts\r\naccumulate on his brain, till that organ is dull and sodden as is his\r\nfacial aspect. Why is it that some can only be fluent from the point of\r\na pen, while others can only address their fellows effectively by word\r\nof mouth? Of course there are conversational monsters as well as other\r\nviolations of nature's creative processes. And the more thought that\r\ntalk holds in solution, the more grateful the offering. But I have\r\noften listened attentively and pleasurably to an hour's flow from the\r\nlips of a pretty, graceful woman, or an interesting child, just saying\r\nenough myself to prove that sleep had not seized me. And at the\r\nsubsidence of the tide, I could not for the life of me recall a single\r\nidea to which verbal embodiment had been given. Perhaps I had been\r\ncarried away by the music of tone, or the charming, ever-changing curves\r\nof the opening and closing lips, or the dimples in the cheeks, as they\r\nbudded, blossomed, and faded in the light of the now laughing, now\r\nlanguishing eyes, that never lost their hold of mine, yet never bore\r\nmine down by that most intolerable of all social manifestations--a\r\nstare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n--I have a friend, who declares that he has LOST A SMILE. Not\r\none from his sweetheart, for that would be either recoverable or\r\nreplaceable with another. The smile he mourns is--his own. To speak\r\nplainly, he has lost, through neuralgia, the control over the risible\r\nmuscles of his face, and they not only refuse to obey him in his desire\r\nand design to beam upon all peaceful comers, but occasionally put in\r\nmotion another set of facial strings, which give him a depressed and\r\nlachrymose air when he would fain appear most jubilant. He says he never\r\ntill now knew how much of his facial aspect was artificial. His present\r\ncondition is only relieved when he is under the control of some powerful\r\nemotion. _Then_ he can laugh as heartily and present the appearance of\r\nso doing as fully as ever. It is only the conventional smile, the bland,\r\nself-possessed smile of society, that is utterly gone from him. I\r\nelicited the confession by entering his room noiselessly one day, and\r\ndetecting him in the act of making the gloomiest grimaces at a small\r\nboarding-house mirror on the wall. He was much confused, and at first\r\ndenied any such employment; but ultimately admitted that he had been\r\npracticing facial gymnastics for the purpose of simulating the smile he\r\nhad lost. Perhaps some of our fashionable dentists may be able to aid\r\nhim by a suggestion. They certainly have more smiles at their command\r\nthan any class of men that have come under my observation. How singular\r\nthat the most ferocious quadrupeds and the blandest of men should evince\r\ntheir most contrasted characteristics--fierceness and amenity--by\r\nshowing their teeth.\r\n\r\nI sometimes think those are blessed who are endowed with a coarse\r\norganization. Sensitive people are chronic martyrs. Their nerves are so\r\nmany toes, that their neighbors and friends are perpetually treading on.\r\nNot only are the pangs of such more acute, but the occasions of injury\r\nare infinitely multiplied by super-susceptibility. Talk of the happy\r\nhours of childhood! Ask nine persons out of ten, who are of susceptible\r\norganization, at what period in life their sufferings were most intense\r\nand unremitting, and if they be gifted with good memories, their reply\r\nwill be, 'before adolescence.'[3] For susceptibility of nerve implies\r\nalso high mental capability, acute intelligence, vivid imagination, all\r\nof which go to intensify sensation, and thus to aggravate the mischief.\r\nAnd our sympathy is due to one who by one of those strange\r\ncontradictions in human nature finds herself, a highly nervous creature,\r\nthe victim of an affection for one of the coarser organizations to which\r\nI have alluded. I say victim, for such attachments seldom result\r\nhappily. The effect produced, in the first instance, by the magnetism of\r\na strong over a weak nature gradually dies away. With it die the\r\nbrilliant colors in which the beloved has been invested by the belover,\r\nand life is thenceforward only lit up by the lamps that heaven sets in\r\nthe eyes of the little children that sometimes cheer the darkness of\r\nthese ill-assorted unions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n--'SIR WE ARE TOO POOR TO BE ECONOMICAL.' These were the words\r\nwhich I once heard a woman use to a rich relative of her husband, who\r\nhad followed up his refusal of assistance by allusions to many little\r\nshort-comings which he had noted in the domestic details of the family.\r\nThe phrase seems to involve a contradiction; but a little consideration\r\nwill show even the most superficial thinker that it expresses a truth.\r\nGreat is the power of ready money. Ready money can save by wholesale\r\npurchases. Ready money can save by choice of place of purchase. Ready\r\nmoney can save by choice of proper time for purchase. Ready money can\r\nsave by discount obtained under threat of discontinuance of trade; a\r\nthreat futile in the mouths of the poor. Ready money can save in\r\nfurniture and wearing apparel, by being able to provide the best in\r\nfabric and construction, and therefore the most lasting. But it is\r\nneedless to extend the catalogue of ready money's powers. None know them\r\nbetter than those who seldom are able to obtain their aid.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Quevedo has broadly satirized his faith in 'Childhood's\r\nhappy hour'. In his _Visions of Hell_, where Satan, wearied by the\r\ncontinual grumbling of the condemned, requests them to leave, go back to\r\nlife, be born again, and live it all over. On due reflection, they\r\nconclude that rather than suffer the whippings, schoolings, and\r\nscoldings incident to boy and girlhood, they--would prefer to stay where\r\nthey were.--NOTE BY EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF THE ORIENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world is undergoing a wonderful change. Even within the memory of\r\nsome twenty-five years, what events have occurred to verify the remark.\r\nCivilization changes all the preconceived perfections of the past, and\r\nintroduces new scenes of life; it reforms without injuring, and leaves\r\nus undecided as to the value of the progress made. New customs and new\r\nhabits leave man where he was; his nature is still the same, and perhaps\r\nhe has only engrafted on a faulty structure what neither embellishes nor\r\nimproves, and shows how slow is the progress of the human mind toward\r\nthis goal for which it has, since the commencement of time, been bent.\r\n\r\nThis is peculiarly verified in the 'Orient,' the most ancient of climes\r\nand lands. Through the mist of so many centuries, so many thousands of\r\nyears, the 'far East' has followed the 'even tenor of its way' through\r\nrevolutions and systems; its usages have been consecrated by time, and\r\nthe parent has handed down to his son the usages which were more nearly\r\nallied to the natural state of man than those of the more famed and\r\nprogressing 'West.' The animal has had more sway than the intellectual\r\npart of his nature, and what the curious traveler most admires is the\r\nstill primitive condition of the latter. Violence there reigns superior\r\nto reason, and if changes be made, the former consults but little the\r\nlatter in the measures which it adopts for the prosecution of its plans.\r\nThere is seldom any appeal made by the reformer to the understandings of\r\nthe people to be reformed; they must blindly adopt the innovations\r\noffered, and this without the means of contrasting what they are thus\r\ncompelled to receive at the hand of the bestower with what they forsake.\r\nTossed in the billows of doubt, they are exposed to the rocks of\r\nmisconception, and are too often wrecked through the total absence of\r\nany chart to guide them in their new voyage of life. The transitory step\r\nis always a dangerous one to a people who have not entire confidence in\r\ntheir leader, for his plans may inspire neither conviction nor approval,\r\nand if they fail, leave his followers exposed to all the fury of storms\r\nwithout any haven in which to seek a refuge.\r\n\r\nSultan Mahmoud, believing that European civilization was superior to\r\nthat of the East, imagined that he adopted it, when he only assumed its\r\nexterior, the costume of Frankistan. How little did he know of the\r\ndefects to which this simplest part of it led. Luckily, he adopted only\r\nthe habiliments of the male sex, leaving those of the female unchanged.\r\nThe flowing robes, full of ease and comfort; the turban, soft to the\r\nhead, and giving it protection from the colds of winter and the heats of\r\nsummer; the commodious shoe, which leaves the feet uncrumpled and free\r\nfrom the results of the tighter and closer ones of the West, were laid\r\naside for the dress of Europe. The only part of the garb which we use,\r\nthat he did not assume and compel his people to accept, was the unseemly\r\nand uncomfortable hat, and this he would also have taken, had religion\r\nnot interposed to prevent it. Of all parts of the Christian's costume,\r\nthe hat is the most calculated to inspire disgust in the sight of the\r\nnative of the Orient, and if ever he adopts it, it is because it is\r\nsupposed to cover him with protection against the injustice of his own\r\nrulers, and not from any preference or even choice. It is always an\r\nobject of ridicule, and serves to point many a remark of derision and\r\ncontempt against the wearer. On the other hand, what is more noble and\r\ndignified than the turban, with its snowy white folds, or its varied\r\nhues of green or red? Just as the external appearance of the colored\r\nman, and the knowledge of his total deprivation of civil abilities\r\nperpetuates the existing prejudice against him, so does the dress of the\r\nFrank clothe him with all that is distasteful and revolting in the eyes\r\nof the native of the East, with his prejudices dating back to the\r\nearlier days of the prophets. To pass over the external appearances of\r\nthe reformed Eastern, let us examine the results of the civilization of\r\nEurope with which his costume has clothed him. Tight clothes have\r\nunfitted him for the broad and soft luxury of the sofa, and many persons\r\nresume the flowing robe and full trowsers within doors, so as to be able\r\nto enjoy the comforts which they lost with them. For the same reason,\r\nthey must sit at a high table, on a high chair. The sleeve of the tight\r\ncoat scarcely permits of being rolled up, so that the man of the East\r\ncan return to his primitive use of his fingers in place of the fork, and\r\nfor this he rejects the coat for the flowing pelisse, or he goes to his\r\nmeal in his shirt-sleeves. It is amusing to see the _homme de bureau_,\r\nor the humble clerk, endeavoring to sit on his sofa cross-legged, with\r\nhis writing paraphernalia before him as formerly, or to examine the\r\nbroad chair which he has had to invent, so as to suit himself to his new\r\ntransitory state. It may even be doubted whether he has gained any thing\r\nby the change, as a _cavalier_, for the full trowsers were far more\r\ncomfortable than the present tight pantaloons, and any one who has seen\r\nthe Bedouin horsemen, with their commodious saddles and flowing robes,\r\nmust have given them his entire approbation in point of contrasted\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nAs yet the Oriental has made no innovation in his domestic life and\r\nhabits, or if any, it is that his ladies wear the slender _botine_ of\r\nthe Christian lady in place of the loose slipper of former years. As yet\r\nthere is no commingling of the sexes, no excursions by land and sea in\r\nboats or carriages together, in undisturbed and unrestricted familiar\r\nintercourse. The lady of the house has not yet met her husband's friends\r\nat the dinner-table, at the social _soirée_, or in the ball-room. He is\r\nquite willing to go to these, at the house of his Frank friend, but he\r\nhas not been convinced of the propriety of the change, and his sovereign\r\nhas not carried his reforms into harem life. It will require some years\r\nyet to fit the Oriental for witnessing the displays of female beauty at\r\nsuch places with the calm indifference of the more accustomed native of\r\nFrankistan. He is willing, however, to commingle with the females of his\r\nEuropean neighbors' household, even to embrace them in the mysteries of\r\nthe mazy polka or waltz; but he hesitates admitting that such are the\r\nadvantages or benefits of civilization. Indeed, it may be doubted\r\nwhether his own wife and daughters would suffer such, were they told\r\nthat they might do so without fear of reproach; for it is mostly to the\r\nmothers and wives that the Eastern world owes its tardy progress in the\r\ncivilization of the West. Some time since, during the late Carnival,\r\nthere was a Persian ambassador present at a ball given by the Italian\r\nminister, attended by the ambassador extraordinary of the Shah of\r\nPersia, who had never been to Europe or in a 'civilized European'\r\nsociety. Being asked by a foreign gentleman how he was, and how he liked\r\nthe ball, he frankly replied, that such an exhibition as that of the\r\nbeautiful ladies assembled there _decollé_, etc., had taken him quite by\r\nsurprise; that it was more than his nerves could stand, and he felt so\r\nbad that he thought of leaving the ball and retiring to his own\r\nquarters. The same gentleman, to induce him to remain, jocosely told him\r\nthat it was the paradise of the Christian, whilst his (that of\r\nMussulmans) was in the life to come. At this he smiled, and turning\r\ntoward a bevy of very handsome young ladies, dressed in the hight of the\r\nfashion, his eyes gloating on the fair scene, answered, that he admired\r\nthe Christian paradise very much, and as the other was somewhat\r\nuncertain, he thought he could be satisfied with the persons now around\r\nhim. It is quite possible that, except for the loss of dignity which\r\nwould have attended the act, the Shah's ambassador might easily have\r\nbeen induced to join in a polka with one of the infidel houris then\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMany of the Mussulmans (Turks) of Stamboul come over the Golden Horn to\r\nPera, to witness the merry scenes of the Christian Carnival. They do not\r\nselect the most fashionable places of resort, and consequently fall into\r\nrather doubtful company. They come sometimes with a companion or two,\r\nbut prefer to have only their own people with them, or at most a _toady_\r\nor two to keep them in countenance. Such a person finds a conspicuous\r\nplace, where he can see what is going on, throws off his more than half\r\nEuropean coat, puts on his loose pelisse, calls for his _Tchibook_, or\r\npipe, and, it must be added, something very much like hot punch, and\r\ngoes in for the full enjoyment of the evening. In an hour or two, he is\r\nrather 'pulverized,' and very disregardful of what he says and does. The\r\ntrue semi-barbarian then comes to view; he becomes very ostentatious,\r\nand is disposed to act the fast man; a friend will always find him a\r\nlady, whom he invites to accompany him over to his _konak_, (private\r\ndwelling in Stamboul,) which she refuses; he urges her to play _faro_ or\r\n_rouge et noir_ with _his_ money, which she does, until his purse is\r\nrather light, and by this time our Turk is so far insensible as to\r\nrequire to be conveyed to his carriage by the toadies or private\r\nattendants above mentioned. This he thinks is all right, and calls it _à\r\nla Franka_, or conformably with European civilization and fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Armenian and Greek ladies, too, are adopting the same ideas of\r\nreform and improvement in social life. One of the former, a fair,\r\nmarried lady, of good family, having lately fallen in with a young and\r\nhandsome foreigner attached to one of the legations, allowed his visits\r\nto become more and more frequent, so that one day her husband, returning\r\nhome rather sooner than expected, caught the couple in _flagrante\r\ndelicto_. This was carrying European civilization somewhat to a delicate\r\npoint; but she shielded herself against the husband's reproaches by the\r\nassertion that it was _à la Franka_, and the matter was compromised\r\nwithout any 'secession movement.'\r\n\r\nThe late Sultan built a theatre, and had a corps of ballet-girls for\r\nprivate amusement. He frequently gave entertainments at the former to\r\nthe foreign legations, and one season even attended a _bal paré_ at the\r\nBritish Embassy, and a _bal en ordinaire_ at the French. This rather\r\nstartled some of his subjects; but as such things were considered _à la\r\nFranka_, it passed over without any serious results. At the former, it\r\nis said, an amusing incident occurred, which, if not altogether true,\r\nis _bon troveto_. The late Sultan was extremely sensitive about coming\r\nin close contact with non-believers in the principles of the blessed\r\nProphet. He never could touch the letter accrediting a foreign\r\nambassador without hastening to perform ablutions, and as to conforming\r\nto the custom of shaking hands with an infidel, it was too horrible to\r\nbe thought of for a moment. All animals, except horses, he held in\r\nabhorrence, and changed his entire costume several times a day, if he\r\nhappened to have occasion to expose himself even to the winds blowing\r\nfrom the direction of the infidel hill on which Pera, the residences of\r\nthe Christians, are built. On his arrival at the ball in question, he\r\nwas, as is customary, shown into a private apartment, for a moment's\r\nrepose previous to entering the salon in which hundreds of gay visitors\r\nwere collected. The apartment happened to be that of the lady of the\r\nAmbassador, in fact, her _boudoir_, in which her poodle-dog, _Bijou_,\r\nhad been accustomed to stay. Scarcely had the Sultan taken a seat,\r\nbefore poor Bijou made his appearance, and was at once driven away by\r\nsome of the frightened attendants; but soon after returning unnoticed,\r\nthe spiteful brute approached the Sultan, and offered the greatest\r\nindignity in his power to the pantaloons of the sensitive monarch.\r\nImagine the indignation which occurred, and the designs of the wily\r\nBritish Ambassador to civilize the Turkish Sultan would have been wholly\r\nfrustrated had not the chief gardien of the Sultan's wardrobe\r\nfortunately brought with him a full fresh suit for his master, in case\r\nof eventualities.\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion, the British Ambassador, for the same laudable\r\npurpose of civilizing the various clergy of the Ottoman capital, had\r\ninsisted upon the Armenian, Greek, and Catholic Armenian Bishops and the\r\nGreek Rabbi of the Jews appearing at his _bal paré_ in their canonicals!\r\nAgainst this they strongly remonstrated, but the influence of the\r\nAmbassador was greater than their own, and they had to make their\r\n_débût_ at his ball in full dress. But this was, however, soon\r\nforgotten, as it was all _à la Franka_.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the late Sultan, on the occasion of the circumcision of\r\none or two of his sons, gave a series of entertainments to his own\r\nfunctionaries, and one to the foreign diplomatic corps, in one of the\r\nvalleys on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, called Hyder Pacha. With\r\nthe view of properly amusing the foreign legations, _à la Franka_, the\r\nSultan got up an extemporary theatre, adjoining the splendid pavilion,\r\nin which his guests were assembled. The play selected as best calculated\r\nfor the purpose, was the _Milliner's Shop_, the like of which the Sultan\r\nhad noticed while passing through the great street of Pera--the windows\r\nfilled with bonnets, dress-caps, crinolines, etc., and very handsome\r\ndolls, some quite as 'large as life,' _decollé_, and thanks to the\r\nminiature crinolines, often showing very well-made chaussures and\r\nankles. The little stage was not much raised above the green sward of\r\nthe valley--a ditch had been dug out for the use of the orchestra, and\r\nthe counter of the milliner separated this from the audience. As the\r\nwhole affair had been got up rather hurriedly, the _entrepreneur_ had\r\nnot been able to procure a sufficient number of blocks on which to\r\nexhibit the bonnets and caps, and as men were readily obtained for the\r\npurpose, holes were cut in the counter, through which these thrust their\r\nheads, and on them rested the articles in question. A man also figured\r\nagainst the wall, on whom to hang up a ready-made dress or two, while\r\nhis head also served as a block for a first-rate bonnet with flowers and\r\nfeathers to suit the occasion. Now the weather had threatened a change,\r\nand much to the regret of the Sultan and his Court, who had it at heart\r\nto give such an entertainment to the diplomatic corps of Europe as would\r\ntell largely in the papers, and prove the great progress made by him in\r\ncivilization, just as the play commenced, the rain began to fall in\r\ntorrents. In their pavilion, the foreign ambassadors, etc., were\r\nsomewhat secure, but not so the _dramatis personæ_. The ditch soon\r\nfilled with water, and the orchestra had to hold their instruments above\r\ntheir heads, while the water rose to their waists, and finally drove\r\nthem to open 'secession.' But the man-blocks which supported the\r\nmillinery were still more to be pitied. Their heads were fast in the\r\nholes made, and partially closed again in the centre, so that they were\r\nunable to escape from the rain which deluged the whole affair. The water\r\nfell in torrents over the gay bonnets, caps, crinolines, etc., until\r\nthey became a mass of tawdry, and the bare pates of those under them\r\ncame ludicrously into view. It required the assistance of a carpenter\r\nand his aids to get the poor fellows free from their bondage, and enable\r\nthem to seek safety in flight. As to the man fastened against the wall,\r\nhe bore his torture, and the merriment which he occasioned among the\r\naudience, for some time, but finally was compelled to put an end to his\r\npart of the entertainment by a timely retreat.\r\n\r\nSultan Mahmoud was the first reformer of the Ottoman Empire, and his\r\nsecond son, Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz, the last. The reforms of the late\r\nSultan, Abd-ul-Mejid, nearly ruined him, and the consequence is, that\r\nthe present sovereign has wisely concluded to fall back upon some of the\r\nolder fashions of his people. Mahmoud thought to drive away the\r\nremembrance of the Dervish-Janissaries whose violences seldom allowed a\r\nSultan to die of disease, and never of old age. To effect this, he\r\ndisbanded their several corps, and created new ones, in another dress.\r\nPerhaps this was wise at the time, but the object once reached, he\r\nmight--or his successor, at most--have restored the broken spirit of his\r\npeople, by a return to their national costume. It was only by force and\r\nfear that he induced his new troops to adopt the dress of the deeply\r\ndetested Ghiaours, and the measure greatly alienated the respect and\r\naffections of his subjects, especially those of the interior of the\r\nempire. The higher classes of the capital assumed it with less reserve,\r\non account of the economy which it admitted, and because it was _à la\r\nmode_, but the lower were less disposed to lay that one aside which had\r\nbeen worn by their ancestors, and served to designate the true\r\nMussulman. The picturesque costume of the natives of Arabia, of Egypt,\r\nSyria, and Albania, had to be thrown aside for the tight pantaloons and\r\ncoat of the Infidel, and Mahmoud went so far even as to require the\r\n_Bombardiers_ of his army to wear a head-dress, black, and tall as a\r\nhat, differing from it by the absence of a rim, and open on the top,\r\ncovered only with a bag of dark silk, drawn together with a cord. This,\r\nhow-ever, disappeared in the reign of his successor.\r\n\r\nThe present Sultan has adopted a middle course. Without either restoring\r\nthe costumes of the Janissaries, or even assimilating the habiliments of\r\nhis troops to that which they wear in their own country, which would\r\nhave inspired a strong and useful _esprit de corps_, he has accepted the\r\nuniform of the Zouave and Turcos of the French army. It is sufficiently\r\nOriental to meet the object desired, and is very popular in the Sultan's\r\narmy. It leaves to the wearer the free use of his limbs, but as a\r\nparade-dress will not show so favorably, to European eyes, as the more\r\ndignified dress of the Guards. The most difficult part of a military\r\ncostume is the head-dress; and the common red cap of the Turks, called\r\nthe _Fez_, is even more objectionable than the unseemly slouched hat\r\nworn in the regular army of the United States. Around this cap the\r\nSultan has had a small turban bound, in one or two folds, which is a\r\nrelief to the eye, and easily kept in order. It is readily taken off, in\r\ncase of need, and may be bound around the waist as a sash, or girdle.\r\n\r\nThis change in the dress of his army has given to his people the idea\r\nthat their new Sultan is anti-Christian, and will restore the Ottoman\r\nEmpire to its former state and condition. How far this will be verified,\r\nstill rests to be seen. Reforms not entirely needed, and but half\r\ncarried out, leave the recipients in that transitory state which weakens\r\nand demoralizes without effecting any permanent and real benefit. An\r\nexternal change is certainly less efficient than a moral one, but it\r\ngoes far toward influencing the feelings of patriotism and loyalty which\r\nare so essential to man in his political condition, and it is more than\r\nprobable that the anti-reforms of Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz will effect more\r\nreal good in his capital, and elsewhere, than the boasted reforms of his\r\nillustrious father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITCHES, ELVES, AND GOBLINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creative power of man, though so much boasted, is after all but a\r\nmere phantom--a vapor which rises from the ground and floats with little\r\nchange of form from place to place. The diapason which we thought so\r\nextensive, appears, on inquiry, to consist of only a few notes, and the\r\nchanges that may be rung upon them, may almost be counted upon the\r\nfingers. Homer's fables are near of kin to those of Shakspeare; the\r\nlegends of ancient Greece find their details mirrored exactly in the\r\ntraditions of Spain, Scotland, and Scandinavia. Whether in the remoter\r\nfogs of the past some glimmering traces of light may lead us to discover\r\na common origin, a universal fountain, whence proceed pure and limpid\r\nall the streams that are contaminated by baser contact in their later\r\ncourse, is a question which might mightily task the most powerful minds.\r\nThe gods of Greece and Rome are reproduced in Odin and Thor, Freia, and\r\nGerda and Tduna. Aphrodite at Athens, Venus on the Seven Hills, Freia in\r\nthe North, differ but in name. Dark hair and coal-black eyes, and a\r\nwarm, sunny beauty may please the ardent inhabitants of Greece and Rome;\r\nthe Swedes and Germans may bow before golden hair and blue eyes, fair\r\nand blooming cheeks. But transport the Grecian Aphrodite to the\r\nDofrefield glaciers, and she will soon grow white as their snow, her\r\neyes will fade to the pale cold blue of their skies, and with the winter\r\nfrosts her hair will turn like fall leaves, golden yellow; and under the\r\nsun of Italy, Freia will tan to the burning, dark-hued, voluptuous Venus\r\nof the South. The two soils naturally breed the one cold statues, the\r\nother passionate life, but these two different phases are in themselves\r\nidentical, Thor's hammer, and the various wonderful exploits of the\r\nNorthern gods and goddesses, their dim, ill-defined notions of creation,\r\nof time and space, and of future worlds, are but natural growths from\r\nthe nature of the North. Their gods, like their men, are all action, and\r\nto raise their actions above those of the human race, they naturally\r\ninvest them with peculiar supernatural physical endowments, and a\r\nstrange, mysterious mode of action. The powers of magic come to their\r\naid; they are not absolutely omnipotent. Dwarfs forge them invincible\r\narms in subterranean caverns; earth, air, fire, and water, conspire to\r\nassist them. The elements rage or are appeased at their command.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the gods of Greece and Rome are all repose. Their\r\nactions acquire a superiority over those of man not by supernatural\r\nagencies or extraordinary developments of physical power; their\r\npreëminence lies in the quiet assumption of power, in the immediate\r\nsequence of action on volition. Their divinity is esoteric, consisting\r\nin attributes innate and not assumed. Action with them is power; but in\r\nthe North power must be superadded.\r\n\r\nThus we find all the various attributes embodied in the gods of the\r\nSouth, likewise deified and modified in the North, Thus Loke is the\r\nMercury of the ancients. He is the same sly rogue as Hermes, though he\r\nhas not some of the better qualities of that god. He is essentially the\r\ngod of deceit. His deceptions are more subtle and deep-laid than those\r\nof the Grecian adept. He combines with the Pagan element something of\r\nthe old Christian Satanic element. Without the horn and hoof of the\r\nChristian devil, he has all his peculiar mental qualities, and uses them\r\nto the great prejudice and harm of the other gods. So, likewise, with\r\nmany of the more human [Greek: muthoi]. We find the same ideas to spring\r\nup in the agora of Athens, the wilds and snows of Norway, and the\r\nheathers and hills of Scotland. The fable of the Sirens finds an exact\r\ncounterpart in the North. Like Ulysses, Duke Magnus and innumerable\r\nothers escape with difficulty from the charms and enticements of\r\nsea-nymphs. Sometimes it is their wonderful song which the earth and\r\nthe elements obey as they did Orpheus, that attracts them. Sometimes it\r\nis by more sensual blandishments, and sometimes by sweet and tender\r\npersuasion, _suadæ medullâ_. Mountain elves start from the ground, and\r\nfrom unseen caverns, and attempt to entice brave knights to their ruin;\r\nthey dance round them beneath the trees, and endeavor to make them join\r\nin their dances. The natural fortitude of the stalwart champions is\r\nrarely able to resist the temptation, and they are always on the point\r\nof falling, when some unoffending barn-yard fowl sounds the signal for\r\nretreat, or some Christian word is uttered, or sign made, and the fair\r\nvisions vanish, either naturally or in divers shapes with odors of\r\nbrimstone and sulphur. The differences between the Grecian and the\r\nNorthern conceptions are striking. In the Greek the forms are clear and\r\nvivid. The sirens are beautiful women, with angelic voices and vulture's\r\ntalons. There are nothing but conceivable realities in their story.\r\nThere is nothing strange or supernatural in their accessories. But in\r\nthe Scandinavian elves the case is different. They vanish and reäppear\r\nat different times; they have no actual, permanent existence. The crow\r\nof a cock or the sign of the cross is enough to drive them back to their\r\nhiding-places. They shun daylight and fixed, customary spots. They\r\ngenerally surprise casual travelers, and upon them in lone, romantic\r\nspots, practice all their arts of enticement and seduction. There is\r\nalways something of magic, of the supernatural, connected with them. The\r\nGreek sirens are not like common women; but once conceive of their\r\nphysical existence, and you understand them thoroughly. Their laws of\r\naction are purely human, and we do not find them one half so unnatural\r\nas our neighbor that has a splay foot or a hunchback. The Northern\r\nwitches, however, are formed like human females, but obey unknown and\r\nmysterious powers. The commonest words and associations of men are bans\r\nto them. Only so long do they have power as nothing human disturbs and\r\noverthrows their supernatural spells.\r\n\r\nAgain let us look for a moment at another division of Grecian fiction.\r\nThe grim Cyclops who toils for Vulcan, working like mortal men, and\r\nforging divine things, it is true, like any Grecian blacksmith, has a\r\ncounterpart of a somewhat different character in the North. The reality\r\nand vividness of the Greek changes as we approach the Pole. In deep\r\ncaverns distorted, strange little dwarfs work by the aid of supernatural\r\npowers wondrous weapons, swords of incredible qualities, armor that\r\ndefies mortal blades, bracelets of wondrous and cunning finish and\r\nsingular properties--all here is miraculous, the workman, the process,\r\nand the work. The vividness with which Homer presents to us the one-eyed\r\nPolyphemus, with his tree-staff and his ponderous body, is exchanged by\r\nthe Scandinavian for smallness, indistinctness of form and of power. The\r\ngrand in the South is obtained by giving enlarged pictures of man as he\r\nis; in the North, by investing him with strange, magic, mysterious\r\nqualities. In mental as well as material nature, a general haziness of\r\noutline conveys the idea of greatness as strongly, though in another\r\nmanner, as the sharp and perceptible outline of any thing really great.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity we shall find running through the literature, the\r\ncharacter, and the mind of the two nations. The North is misty,\r\nundefined, illimited; the Greek is clear as crystal, sharp and angular,\r\non every side. Its conceptions are never vague, but are tangible, real,\r\nand human. Thus with the Greek, a vast ocean, like that they know,\r\nencircles the whole earth, and fixes its bounds and the limits which man\r\nshall not pass; the Northerns compassed it about with a vast serpent of\r\nimmense size, which bounded infinity and space, time and eternity,\r\nthereby mirroring, in some degree, as it were, the ancient symbol for\r\ntime and space without end, the snake biting his own tail, the circle\r\nwith no one beginning nor end. The heaven of the Greeks is the summit of\r\none of their own mountains, known to every peasant and inhabitant.\r\nAccessible only to the gods, there they live, as unconcernedly as though\r\nthe earth were not. Thor, and Odin, and Freia live in the 'Shining\r\nWalhalla,' whither go the souls of brave and good warriors. Their way\r\nthither is over the heavenly bridge, the many-colored rainbow, thrown\r\nover between heaven and earth for the passage of the happy souls. And\r\nthere in this dim, ghostly Walhalla they sit like the Grecian gods, and\r\ndrink mead instead of ambrosia and nectar. They do not share in the\r\nearthly vices of the Southern gods. Thor never begat such a progeny as\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nRepose is also, as hinted at, a characteristic of Southern mythology,\r\nwhile action, assisted by supernatural agencies, is the feature of the\r\nNorthern deities. Thus Jupiter sits majestic and silent upon Olympus and\r\nnods his head, and the whole earth shakes. He is human in his character,\r\nbut of an ideal and superior human nature--man immensely magnified. The\r\ngods of Norway are also human, but they are, in themselves, _mere_ men.\r\nWhat makes them gods is the magic power which is joined with them, a\r\nmere adjunct not forming a part of them. They toil and act like\r\nmen--they are never still. Thor bears the hammer, the emblem of physical\r\nstrength, energy, and activity. He can at a draught half drain the sea,\r\nand cause the tides to rise and ebb; he can lift the serpent that\r\nsurrounds the world; he can wrestle with Death himself, and almost come\r\noff victorious. The giants are his mortal enemies, and against them he\r\nwages war and bears deadly hatred, as Jupiter against the Titans. None\r\nbut the warrior, who has fought long and well, enjoys the long dreamt-of\r\nmead of Walhalla. A death on one's own bed is almost as ignominious as\r\nthat of the coward. The straw-death (_strödod_) they will endeavor to\r\navoid by opening their own veins and bleeding to death, and as the warm\r\nlife-blood pours forth, they sing triumphant death-songs, and see the\r\nportals gradually open to receive them, and Braga the Scald, seated at\r\nthe gate with his magic-sounding harp, his fingers running through the\r\ngolden strings, and in such ecstasies they give up the ghost. The Greek\r\ndies in a more quiet, philosophical, and practical manner. He does not\r\nfear the shame of a warm and soft bed. Achilles, and Ajax, and Diomed,\r\nare not the only inmates of Elysium. Socrates, and Plato, and Homer,\r\nApelles and Zeuxis, are all there too. The poet and the philosopher, the\r\npainter and the sculptor, rank as high through pen, pencil, and chisel,\r\nas the warrior by his blade and his bloody exploits. Art, in the North,\r\nfinds no existence, and strikes no sympathizing chord in the bosoms of\r\nthe sturdy Northmen. Art, to be perfect, requires a distinctness of\r\nconception, and an assimilation to human nature in its subjects,\r\nentirely at variance with the dim, mysterious character of the\r\nScandinavian imagination. Painting is a thing utterly unknown, and\r\nsculpture, where found, deals in shapeless blocks and huge, massive,\r\nill-proportioned forms, analogous to the primitive Egyptian art. In the\r\nNorthern mythology and legendary history, minstrels play an important\r\npart. They are as indispensable as the Welsh bards, though not invested\r\nwith the same authority as they. At the table of the gods, Braga strikes\r\nhis wonderful harp and chants the triumphal hymns of dead warriors as\r\nthey enter the Walhalla. Round the boards of the rougher Vikings, among\r\nthe muscular, sun-browned champions, hardened to blood and strife, the\r\nminstrel is ever present, and as the huge cups pass around the long\r\nline, they sing the triumphs and praises of their hosts. They are like\r\nthe old Grecian minstrels; like Phemius and Demodocus, they chant old\r\nmemories of great sea-kings and champions, legends of magic elves and\r\ndwarfs, and wondrous and often touchingly beautiful stories of love and\r\npassion. The vague impressions of music seem to harmonize marvelously\r\nwith the Northern nature. It is wild and weird in its character, for\r\nmuch of it, with the innumerable ballads of those days, have reached us\r\nfrom father to son, and vividly recall the times whence they date, and\r\nthe men whose characters they mirror. There is often a magic element\r\nconnected with their music. The music of the elves is like that of the\r\nsirens and of Orpheus, often irresistible. Through many of their ballads\r\nruns the same legendary undertone. A maiden's song moves the king's\r\nheart, and one by one he offers in vain every gift in his power, to the\r\nvery half of his kingdom, and ends by placing a crown of gold upon her\r\nhead, and seating her beside him on his throne as his lawful queen. The\r\nstory of the two sisters, one ugly and one beautiful, reappears in the\r\nNorth in various forms. The younger and more lovely of the two is\r\nmurdered, and the elder is to wed her bride-groom. Pilgrims who meet\r\nwith the body, make a lyre from the bones, and string it with the golden\r\nhair of the maiden, and as they play at the bridal, each string tells\r\nits tale of horror in turn, while the unhappy sister sinks under these\r\ninanimate accusations.\r\n\r\nIn the Greek myths we find none of these mysterious elements. The\r\nsupernatural creations we meet with are innumerable, and no less strange\r\nin themselves. But there is nothing in Polyphemus, in Circe, in the\r\nSirens, beyond their physical natures, which can make us look beyond\r\nourselves to understand and fully sympathize with them. Once fully grasp\r\ntheir superhuman endowments, and you feel they act like men on a large\r\nscale. Not so with the Northern supernatural beings. In themselves they\r\napproach nearer to men, and are but little above them in endowments and\r\ncharacter, but it is their mode of action which makes them superior to\r\nus; their divinity and power lie not in themselves, but in the agents,\r\nvisible and mysterious, that they employ. They are not like Jupiter,\r\nomnipotent. They are brought to a stand quite as often as more humble\r\nmortals. Thor, without his hammer, is no longer Thor himself. His trusty\r\nMjölner is more to him than the thunderbolt of Zeus to the Grecian\r\nfather of the gods. The eagle and thunderbolt of Jove, the ægis of\r\nMinerva, the girdle of Venus and Mercury's wands, are mere emblems of\r\nwhat powers their own natures give them. With the Northern deities their\r\nwhole strength lies in the possession of these. Without them they are\r\npowerless, and in spite of all their might, they are often obliged to\r\ncall on one another for assistance, and sometimes even stand in need of\r\nmortal aid. We may, perhaps, consider the Grecian gods as mere\r\npersonifications and idealities, but those of the North are essentially\r\nreal. They are the creations of a powerful but vague imagination, forms\r\nwhich resemble a Norwegian mountain, distinct in itself by its\r\nglittering snows and icy rocks, but which shrouds its head in a\r\nperpetual mist, except when some adverse wind with its indiscreet\r\nblowing, displays it in all its nakedness, and plain though grand\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to the story of Circe and Ulysses is a myth which forms the\r\nfoundation of some of the most beautiful and pathetic ballads of Sweden,\r\nDenmark and Norway. The mountain king bears to his cavern in the\r\nhill-side a fair maiden, and with him\r\n\r\n  'For eight long years, I ween, she lived in the mountain there,\r\n  And sons full seven she bore him, and eke a daughter fair.'\r\n\r\nAnd here the resemblance ceases, and the Northern legend assumes a more\r\nbeautiful tone. The maiden longs for her mother and her old home, and\r\ngoes from the mountain king with the promise not to mention her seven\r\nsons. She tells her tale, however, and the elf-king straightway appears,\r\nand strikes her till the life-blood flows. She then says:\r\n\r\n  'Farewell, dear father, and farewell, dear mother, too,\r\n  Farewell, my sister dear, and dear brother, farewell to you.\r\n  Farewell, thou lofty heaven, and the fresh, green earth, farewell!\r\n  Now wend I to the mountain where the mountain king doth dwell.'\r\n\r\nAnd so they ride to the mountain, through the long, wild, black wood,\r\nthe mother weeping bitter tears, while the elf-king smiles. Her little\r\ndaughter reaches her a golden chair:\r\n\r\n  'Oh! rest thee, my poor mother, so sad and woe-begone.'\r\n\r\nShe takes the foaming mead in her hand,\r\n\r\n  'And scarce from out the mead-glass bright the first draught\r\n  does she take,\r\n    (The hour goes heavy by,)\r\n  Her eyes were sudden closed, and her weary heart it brake,\r\n    (Ah! well sorrow's burden know I.)'\r\n\r\nThat the Greeks had similar ballads and legends can not be doubted, but\r\nto revive them from their present destruction is a task beyond the power\r\nof science and antiquarianism. Hardly more than a quarter of a century\r\nhas elapsed since the first important steps were taken in the North of\r\nEurope to preserve these ballads which had thus been orally handed down\r\nfrom ages that vanish in the darkness of the past, and which in a few\r\nyears more, with the gradual disappearance of primitive simplicity in\r\nSweden and Norway, might have been, for the greater part, lost to us\r\nforever. Who knows but that in some remote corner of Greece, in spite of\r\nthe revolutions and shocks which have convulsed it, there may still lurk\r\nan occasional shadow at least of some good old popular song?\r\n\r\nThe refrains which accompany the Northern ballads, and which are, in\r\nfact, found among all nations whose ballad poetry has been preserved,\r\nmerit some attention. Sometimes melancholy and sad, sometimes gay and\r\njoyous, they impart character wonderfully to the piece. There is\r\nsomething peculiarly mournful in the recurring of these sad, touching\r\nthoughts and words, and as the interest of the ballad deepens, their\r\ntouching simplicity grasps more deeply into the soul, and affects us in\r\na manner which nothing else could. When they are joyous--a rarer form,\r\nhowever--they impart to us also their own buoyancy and gayety. Sometimes\r\nthey convey the moral of the piece, some simple yet profound reflection,\r\nwhich marks by itself the feeling that pervades the whole ballad; at\r\nother times they are merely descriptive of nature, and borrow their\r\nenlivening or heart-rending character from the assimilation or contrast\r\nthey present with the groundwork of the poetry. The origin of this kind\r\nof refrain is evidently due to the manner in which the ballads were\r\ncomposed. Mainly extemporized, both words and music, by wandering scalds\r\nor minstrels, the refrain was a pause to enable the singer to compose\r\nthe next line. The utter disregard of rhyme, alliterations the most\r\nslight and imperceptible, and words of no similarity of sound almost\r\nalways taking their place, rendered this a very easy task. A thorough\r\nknowledge and mastery of legendary lore, and a little power and\r\nconcentration of thought and imagery, were the only qualities requisite\r\nfor a ballad-monger. Some of them bear the marks of superior minds, both\r\nby their wonderful vividness of description and by the tone of deep,\r\ngenuine feeling which pervades them throughout.\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful affinity between the Scotch and the Norwegians and\r\nSwedes, especially in their traditionary literature, which marks a\r\ncommon origin and common customs at some remote period. We find among\r\nthe genuine Scotch ballads many that are almost literal versions of the\r\nsame Scandinavian legends no less indigenous in their own land. A large\r\nnumber of the most beautiful Scotch ballads plainly point to an\r\nextraneous Northern origin, and their exact counterparts in form, ideas,\r\nand words, we find circulating as popular songs among the Swedish,\r\nDanish, and Norwegian peasantry. These may often be traced back\r\ncenturies, at the end of which they seem still to be as old and as\r\nthoroughly implanted in their native soil as they now seem. They have\r\nbeen sung from mouth to mouth, with the same wild old melodies and the\r\nsame quaint language, as they were sung centuries ago among the scenes\r\nthey so faithfully depict.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics we have so briefly alluded to as marking the two\r\nclasses of nations, namely, mysterious grandeur among the Northmen, and\r\namong the Greeks ideality, grandness, and vividness of conception, might\r\nby skillful hands be traced in more modern times under the influence of\r\nan ever-changing and growing civilization. I will only allude, in\r\npassing, to a few prominent points.\r\n\r\nThe literature of Greece, as we know it, had already reached its hight,\r\ntwo thousand years before our time. It was already gray with years\r\nbefore the North had begun its infancy. Homer is the boundary which is\r\ninsurmountably opposed to our further retrospection, and Homer is\r\nalready the beginning of perfection in Greek letters. Of earlier periods\r\nwe can but conjecture that there must have been such, bearing a\r\ncharacter analogous to the relics of those nations whose fabulous\r\nhistory is better known to us. Northern literature can hardly be said to\r\nhave had an existence till within the last hundred years. Before that\r\ntime we must look for all phases of progress and germs of progress in\r\nthe physical and animal character of the nation, their social and\r\npolitical features and relations. The vividness and ideality of the\r\nancients find their natural change in the more purely impassioned style\r\nof more modern Southern poetry. Their creations have naturally lost with\r\nthe fall of paganism, the supernatural endowments they had, and\r\nretaining in some their ideality, they have hightened and fired the\r\nhuman nature they depict by the addition of wilder and more flaming\r\npassions, of love that consumes, and ambition, revenge, and hatred that\r\ndestroy. Thus we again obtain consistent characters governed by human\r\nlaws, but raised above the ordinary mass of men by different qualities\r\nfrom those which ennobled ideal creations among the ancients. Repose\r\nstill constitutes greatness in some instances; but the inner man is made\r\nall fire, and seething metal, ever-burning and quenchless. Elevation and\r\nsubtlety of ideas naturally follow these causes, they are another\r\nnatural growth of the simple ideality of conception.\r\n\r\nThe Northern character at the present day has very different qualities.\r\nThough renowned for philosophical and metaphysical prose, yet their\r\npoetry they require to deal with realities and not with ideas; it must\r\nbe clear as a fountain, and any opaqueness is an inexcusable flaw. They\r\nare yet in the infancy of literature, and the imagination is still more\r\nsensuous than acute and subtle. However much they court abstractions in\r\nprose, in verse they love only the actual, the real, the tangible.\r\nNature, and not metaphysics, are the subjects of their poetry, and they\r\nstill preserve a freshness and simplicity reminding of more ancient and\r\nruder days, delightful amidst the hair-splitting of most modern poetry.\r\nTheir infancy is like the infancy of all national literatures,\r\npeculiarly modified by the advanced state of civilization in which their\r\nbirth was thrown. At first sight there seems something unnatural and\r\nunaccountable in this apparent contradiction in the character of the\r\nnation, manifested respectively in their prose and their poetry. But on\r\nfarther examination all becomes clear as a spring day. Their prose was,\r\nas their whole literature might and should have been, contemporary with\r\ntheir civilization through its various phases. Metaphysics is the last\r\nrefinement, or rather, corruption, which national literature undergoes.\r\nTheir prose had naturally arrived at this stage when the true poetic\r\nfeeling woke for the first time. And in spite of the rational tendencies\r\nof the age, it assumed that character of warm, bodily imagination which\r\nmarks all early literatures. The tendency to the mysterious and the\r\nsuperhuman has mostly vanished, and more vivid conceptions of every\r\nthing have, under their Christian development, taken the place of dim\r\nmagic and weird creations. Northern poets still delight in dealing with\r\nthose wonderful poetical inventions of their own ancient mythology, and\r\nrevel among the elves and dwarfs that surround the bosoms of mountains\r\nand woods. Lif, with her golden hair, Gerda, with cheeks like auroras,\r\nthe cunning Loke, with his mixture of guile, wickedness and deceit,\r\nThor's mighty Mjölner, and the mead-horns of Walhalla--from among these\r\nwonderful beings, they have culled with a careless hand, and every sprig\r\nand flower is radiant with poetic beauty. The taste for old legends and\r\ntraditions has revived within a few years, and scholars and antiquarians\r\nare now laying open unknown mines of treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRUE ROMANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong my friends at Rome, during a few weeks that I spent there, was one\r\nold resident of the 'Eternal City' whom I had often begged to give me\r\nsome authentic narrative of Catholic experience. He was naturally\r\nreserved, jealously truthful, a 'know-nothing' upon religious\r\ncontroversy, not at all the man to invent an exciting story, not fond of\r\nlegends, Romish or Genevan, not a violent partisan of republicanism in\r\nchurch or state, and not familiar enough with American thought to\r\nsuspect the use that might be made in the United States of such an\r\nincident as I am now to repeat. In fact, as I compare him with other\r\nsources of intelligence open to travelers, sure as I am that no one\r\ncould question his belief of whatever he told, every weight that\r\ncharacter, intelligence, years, experience, could confer, rests upon\r\nthe only monkish secret which he professed to know. One night he\r\ninvited me to a subterranean restaurant, famous for its excellent\r\ncreature-comforts, and there over some royal English beer, without any\r\ngraces of style or attempts to exaggerate the incidents, he unfolded\r\nwhat I believe to be a true record of unblessed love.\r\n\r\nGeneral readers are familiar with the fact that many a nun immures\r\nherself for life under a sort of moral compulsion, because her high-born\r\nfamily has become too indigent to maintain its stately style of living,\r\nbecause the lady herself is in danger of contracting some degrading\r\nalliance, declines peremptorily such connection as her relations\r\napprove, or has committed some imprudence that clouds over her future\r\nprospects. The secret influences which entangle men in the Catholic\r\norders correspond to this. It would be arrant bigotry to doubt that some\r\noffer up an unstained heart, in aspirations for usefulness or sighs for\r\nholiness; but many times a youth is led blindfold to the altar by\r\nambitious relatives, like Talleyrand, and discovers too late his perfect\r\nunfitness for the vow he has assumed. And these last are they whose\r\nlives become a scandal to their profession, whose levity shocks so many\r\nProtestant observers, whose consciences have no true peace, who die\r\nsometimes in open unbelief and, living, are the worst enemies of the\r\ncause they advocate.\r\n\r\nAs my story goes, at nearly the same time that a gallant young man of\r\nhigh family disappeared from the gay circles of Rome, a lovely girl of\r\ndistinguished parentage had suffered her blonde tresses to be shorn, her\r\ngraceful limbs draped in forlorn russet, her merry meetings with girlish\r\nspirits like herself exchanged for the tears of the confessional, the\r\nlengthened prayers of the cloister, the frequent fastings and sometimes\r\nscourgings of monastic life. The cause of this contemporaneous\r\ndisappearance was known only to the most intimate friends of two\r\ncelebrated but no longer wealthy families, who deemed the sacrifice\r\nnecessary, and so recked not of the wounds it might make, the perjuries\r\nit might tempt, the life-struggle of duty with feeling it might cause.\r\n\r\nTime passed on. Forgotten by society, it was supposed these victims of\r\nartificial life had forgotten the circles they were wont to charm,\r\nforgotten almost themselves in a system most ingeniously arranged to\r\nblot out one's individuality and to make its subject a perfectly ordered\r\npart of a grand machine. But, unsuspected by their friends, unknown to\r\ntheir superiors, these two pledged hearts had met. Love will break\r\nthrough even convent-walls, will speak amidst monastic silence, will\r\nrise unbidden under ascetic discipline. No one can tell, very few can\r\nimagine how they agreed upon their trysting hour. Through a neglected\r\ndrain, from some underground apartment, where she had been imprisoned\r\nfor negligence, the slender form of the delicate maiden worked its way\r\ninto the free air where her lover awaited her in the eagerness of a\r\nstolen pleasure; and the hours supposed to be given to prayer or repose\r\nflew fast in the worship of the 'winged god.' If I recollect rightly,\r\nthere were deeply-shaded groves not far from their place of meeting, in\r\nwhich they felt secure from observation during the night season.\r\n\r\nBut Love has always been blind to its own peril: a prudent lover would\r\nbe indeed a black swan; if such there have been, these were not. And one\r\nnight, when the beautiful nun would return through the friendly passage\r\nin season, that her absence might not be detected when the sisters were\r\nsummoned to their matin service, the rain, whose torrents she had not\r\nnoticed while her lover's arm sheltered her, had filled up the only\r\npathway to her cell, and not even by the hazard of life could she\r\nrecover her room once more. A few hours more, and her absence would\r\ninevitably come to light, would be fearfully punished, if not by a death\r\nsuch as Scott portrays in one of his poetical legends, by a disgrace far\r\nworse than physical suffering, from which nothing but the grave could\r\ngive her relief. The alternative, flight, where no provision had been\r\nmade, with no possible help from any friend, with the likelihood of\r\ntreachery where they might least expect it, seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nIn despair rather than hope, the forlorn lady recollected that her\r\nuncle, who had some spiritual supervision over the Roman convents,\r\nthough he was sure to be more outraged by her misstep than any one else,\r\nhad (besides the motive of shielding a family name from disgrace)\r\nperhaps some remaining affection for his favorite niece. At any rate, if\r\nshe were to die, she thought it would be a satisfaction to die humanely,\r\nby the speedy stroke of offended honor than by such cruel penances as\r\nwould slowly wear life away. And, what might she not hope, if there were\r\nstill one humane drop in that aged bosom, one indulgent memory of\r\nyouthful passion beneath that austere cowl, one fond thought of a\r\nchildhood which seemed to herself a dream of paradise, when his hand\r\nblessed her curling head, and his lips gave a parting kiss, returned so\r\nheartily by herself.\r\n\r\nThere was not a moment to lose--they hardly knew how time had sped, but\r\nthey had never found his wings slow when they were together. So, hand in\r\nhand they hastened to the presence which was to be either deliverance or\r\ncondemnation to them both; and when at last they reached the palace, and\r\nafter some delay were admitted to kneel before his eminence, no words\r\ncan paint the horror with which he exchanged his dreams of the papal\r\nchair for a sight of the apostate priest and self-doomed nun confessing\r\nin one breath that they had 'loved not wisely, but too well'--that God\r\nonce brought together those whom cruel relatives tore asunder--that _he_\r\nwas their only escape from double ruin, and infamy worse than death.\r\n\r\nThe moments seemed hours while he who had approved the punishment of\r\nother celibates for no greater sins, sought how he might ward off a blow\r\nthat struck so near his own bosom--that was to crush one the grace of\r\nwhose childhood had not been more marked than her affection for\r\nhimself--than the earnestness of the tone with which she was wont to\r\ndeclare herself 'his little daughter.' He had not the courage to hazard\r\nhis position by espousing her cause or undertaking her escape. He felt\r\nthat she had been more sinned against than sinning, in having been\r\nforced into a vow of perpetual virginity when she had already made\r\nanother vow which her loving nature had rejoiced to keep.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the preservation of his dignity was of infinite moment to his\r\npeace--nor could he help seeing that a flood of disgrace would sweep\r\nover the Church were such breaches widened by the public protection of\r\nthe offenders, and, of course, the enemies of monastic institutions\r\nwould seize upon the opening for fiercer assaults.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he dismissed the erring brother in too much trouble to bestow\r\nthe admonition which the other was in too great anxiety to heed--threw\r\nover the trembling girl the cloak and hat of a common citizen--summoned\r\nhis household servants together as quickly as possible, and hastened in\r\nthe twilight of early dawn to the sleeping convent with as large an\r\nattendance as such hot haste would permit.\r\n\r\nFor some time no admittance could be obtained; and the rain seemed to\r\npour down in sheets, as if all the windows of heaven were open. But his\r\norders were peremptory, his authority was ample, his excuse ingenuity\r\nitself: 'He had just heard that a man was secreted within those\r\nconsecrated walls; he was determined to see for himself, if he had to\r\ntear one stone from another; under his supervision no such infamy should\r\nbe so much as suspected.' And so, making a virtue of necessity, the\r\npanic-struck lady abbess yielded her dignity, and the _posse_ of\r\npretended inspectors stood within the drowsy walls before one rose-tint\r\nin the East threatened their secret with exposure.\r\n\r\nSo responsible an official could not be satisfied with seeing the nuns\r\ntogether, or witnessing their earliest chapel-service; he must enter\r\nevery room, survey every cranny, and leave no possibility of deception,\r\nno corner for concealment. And posting some of his servants--whose\r\nexcessive watchfulness might prove a little inconvenient--at the two\r\nprincipal entrances, with his remaining attendants he proceeded orderly\r\nfrom room to room, the superior refusing, as was expected, to sanction\r\nby her presence such an invasion of the sacred privacy of her\r\ninstitution. When they reached the cell adjoining that where our tale\r\nproperly ends, the disguised nun was far enough in the rear of the\r\nfeebly-lighted party, and they too busy in the pretended search, for her\r\ndisappearance to be noticed--her uncle had made her see that this was\r\nthe only chance--so, flinging the coat and hat through an open window\r\ninto the yard, she glided with ghost-like tread into her own apartment,\r\nand when the drowsy servitors opened her door, she was seen upon her\r\nknees before the crucifix, praying more fervently than ever the jubilant\r\nprayer of a newly-rescued soul.\r\n\r\nThe trouble threatened to lead to some farther difficulties. For these\r\nladies were of the Roman aristocracy, and their honor had been\r\nimpeached, their sanctuary invaded, their solemn asseverations had been\r\ndisregarded, their protector had become their accuser. It might have\r\ngone hard with the father who had planned this ingenious device to save\r\nhis name from disgrace and shield his niece from suffering. But, just\r\nbefore the party turned from the convent-gate, a keen eye detected the\r\nfallen mantle; and the trophy was exhibited to the agitated superior, in\r\nproof that some of the forbidden sex had been lurking around, and had\r\nstolen away in terror from so formidable a search; she was warned to new\r\nvigilance, and offered every assistance for the future which the papal\r\nguards could bestow.\r\n\r\nAnd so ends all that my informant knew of the love-lost girl. Her\r\naccomplice in guilt, who did not desert her till he saw there was hope\r\nin her uncle's face, was hurried away as a missionary to South-America;\r\nand, as the waves of the sea rolled between him and his only object of\r\naffection, he must have 'rejoiced with trembling' that the crimson waves\r\nof death had not mingled her and him in a common doom. He wanted the\r\nindependence to detect the injustice of a system which made a pure\r\nattachment guilt, and its discovery condemnation; so he raised no\r\nprotesting voice against it. Truly, the day of strange stories in Italy\r\nis not yet over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGUENOTS OF NEW-YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Stuyvesant was among the earliest to encourage the emigration\r\nof the Huguenots to New-York, and whose descendants for generations have\r\nranked with our best and most honorable citizens. On the twenty-fourth\r\nof January, 1664, N. Van Beck, a merchant in New-Amsterdam, received\r\nletters from Rochelle, stating the wish of some French Protestants to\r\nsettle in New-Netherland, as their religious rights had been invaded and\r\ntheir churches burned. The Governor and Council resolved to receive them\r\nkindly, and grant them lands gratuitously. In a letter of M. de\r\nDenonville to the French government, dated sixteenth November, 1686, he\r\nreports that fifty or sixty 'men, Huguenots,' arrived at New-Amsterdam,\r\n'who are establishing themselves at Manat, (New-Amsterdam,) and its\r\nenvirons. I know that some have arrived at Boston, from France.'\r\nAlthough the waves of the Atlantic divided the two countries, the French\r\nKing does not seem to have forgiven his banished subjects in America. In\r\nhis instructions to Count De Frontenac, respecting the expedition from\r\nCanada against New-York, and dated seventh June, 1689, he directs him to\r\n'send to France the French refugees, whom he will find there,\r\n_particularly those of the pretended Reformed Religion_,' or Huguenots.\r\nHis royal but remorseless spirit was not gratified, however, as the\r\nFrench did not venture to attack New-York, and instead of their\r\nProtestant brethren being sent back to France, a few years afterward\r\nthey erected a church for their own religious services. This was _Du\r\nSaint-Esprit_, and built on Pine street, directly opposite to the\r\npresent Custom-House, by the Huguenots and Walloon settlers, the last of\r\nwhom were a part of the French Protestants, although they emigrated to\r\nAmerica from the river 'Wael.' An earlier French chapel had been erected\r\non Marketfield street, then called Petticoat Lane, near the Battery. It\r\nwas an humble edifice, but hither, every Lord's day, the Huguenots from\r\nthe city, Staten Island, the Wallabagh, and New-Rochelle, by wagons, in\r\nwhich they lodged, were wont to assemble to worship God, without the\r\nfear of royal, persecuting edicts, or armed bands. _L'Eglise\r\nSaint-Esprit_ was founded in the year 1704, with a cemetery adjoining.\r\nIt was a plain, neat, stone building, and nearly square--its bell the\r\ngift of Sir Henry Ashurst, of London. On its tablet in front was\r\ninscribed: ÆDES SACRA GALLOR PROT. REFORM. FONDA. 1704. PENITUS REPAR.\r\n1741. In our day its sacred walls have been taken down, the dead\r\nremoved, and the venerable spot, like many others in our busy city, is\r\nnow devoted to Mammon. The successors of _Saint-Esprit_ long since\r\nunited with the Episcopalians, and erected the beautiful marble church\r\nin Leonard street, where the doctrines of the ever-blessed Reformation\r\ncontinue to be declared in the same language in which they were so\r\neloquently preached two centuries ago, by Claude, Laurin, and other\r\nReformed French Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Laboire was the first pastor of the _Saint-Esprit_, which\r\nsoon numbered a flourishing congregation. Some of its members would walk\r\nfrom New-Rochelle, on Saturday night, to worship God in this place, and\r\nthus spending the holy day, would return home again in the evening,\r\njoyfully singing Marot's old French hymns to cheer them by the way. The\r\nStaten-Island Huguenots would make the same pious journey in their light\r\nskiffs and boats. For some years Mr. Laboire, the pastor, toward his\r\nsupport was 'allowed a yearly sallary of twenty pounds per ann. out of\r\nye Revenue of this Province.' The religious services were here\r\nperformed in the primitive manner of the French Calvinistic churches;\r\nbut after the sovereignty of the English was established over the Dutch,\r\nthe forms of their church worship were gradually introduced, until at\r\nlength the Huguenot congregation united with the Protestant Episcopal,\r\nin this diocese.\r\n\r\nIn the _Documentary History of New-York_, vol iii. p. 427, may be found\r\nan old curious article, entitled, 'A Full and Just Discovery of the weak\r\nand slender foundation of a most Pernicious SLANDER, raised\r\nagainst the FRENCH PROTESTANT REFUGEES, inhabiting the Province\r\nof New-York, generally, but more particularly affecting Captain\r\nBENJAMIN FANUEL, a person of considerable note amongst them.\r\nPrinted and published by license of his Excellency Edward Viscount\r\nCornbury, Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the said Province, in\r\nfavor of Justice.'\r\n\r\nIt appears that one Morris Newinhuysen, a mate of a vessel, in 1706, was\r\ntaken by the French, and a prisoner of war, at New-York, reported that\r\nthe 'French Protestants' here corresponded with 'the inhabitants of\r\nFrance, tending to the taking and destruction of this city, by Her\r\nMajesty's declared enemies.' The New-York Huguenots considered this\r\naccusation a 'crime of so high a nature in itself,' and so 'altogether\r\nfalse and untrue,' as to petition Governor Burnet to cause 'the said\r\nMorris Newinhuysen, and all others who may appear concerned, to be\r\nstrictly examined upon the same report, and if found out, be punished\r\naccording to the nature of the crime.' This petition is dated 'February\r\n10, 1707/8,' and signed by 'Stephen D'Lancey, Elias Nezereau, Abraham\r\nJouneau, Thomas Bayeux, Elias Neau, Paul Deoilet, Augustus Jay, Jean\r\nCazale, Benjamin Fanuel.' These must have been leading Huguenots at the\r\ntime. To another petition of a similar character, we find the names of\r\nDaniel Cromelin, John Auboyneau, Francis Vincent, Alexander Allaire. His\r\nExcellency the Governor, ordered the report to be considered, which was\r\ndone, when his Council reported that there was not 'any ground to\r\nsuspect Captain Faneuil of holding a correspondence with France.' This\r\nwas cheering news to the 'French Refugees' in the Province of New-York,\r\nas such a slanderous report, to use their own language on the occasion,\r\nwas 'of pernicious consequence to all the French refugees in general,\r\nand disturbs their peace and quiet, and obstructs that affection and\r\nfamiliarity which they had formerly enjoyed with the other inhabitants\r\nof this Province, to their just grief and resentment.'\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Louis Rou was also a pastor of the 'Reformed Protestant French\r\nChurch in New-York.' As early as the year 1713, among other names in its\r\nofficial records, are found John Barberie, elder, Louis Carré, ancien,\r\nJean Lafont, ancien, André Fuyneau, ancien.' During the year 1724, there\r\nwas great excitement in the French congregation, caused by a party\r\nquestion. Stephen De Lancey, a wealthy merchant, and patron of the\r\nchurch, with others became dissatisfied with the pastor. He was\r\ndismissed for want of zeal, and for innovations which they contended he\r\nhad introduced into their church discipline; but the minister, with his\r\nfriends, appealed from this decision to Governor Burnet and his Council,\r\nwhen they sustained him. Indignant memorials were published by both\r\nparties, and things went so far, that when De Lancey was elected to the\r\nColonial Assembly, the Governor refused to administer his oath of\r\noffice, alleging that he was not a subject of the British crown. De\r\nLancey, the Huguenot, contended that he had left France before the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes, and had received denization in\r\nEngland, under the great seal of James II. He was right, and the\r\nAssembly sustained his argument and claims against his Excellency the\r\n'Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the Provinces of New-York,\r\nNew-Jersies, and Territories thereon depending in America.'\r\n\r\nFor the curious in old families, among the official friends of the\r\nFrench minister, we find James Gou, John Hastier, Elias Pelletreau, Jr.,\r\nJean Va Chan, Andrew Foucault, Jacques Bobin, N. Cazalet, Samuel\r\nBourdet, David Le Febrer, Francois Bourdet, Peter Morgat. They testify\r\nto Mr. Rou's 'exemplary piety and instruction for upwards of fourteen\r\nyears,' which 'have rendered him exceedingly estimable to all who knows\r\nhim, which can't but be acknowledged even by those who are now the\r\noccasion of this trouble.' We find a more general list of French\r\nfamilies, his friends also, and dated thirty-first December, 1724, and\r\nthey speak well of him, 'with edification, always leading an exemplary\r\nlife:' James Bergerron, Francis Bosset, Daniel Girand, Daniel Gailliard,\r\nElias Chardavoine, Paul Pelletreau, James Many, Gamaliel Guyele, Anthony\r\nPintard, Jeremie La Touche, Samuel Bourdet, Jean Bachan, Elie Mainburt,\r\nAndrew Richard, James Belleveau, Peter Quintard, John Bosset, James\r\nBobin, Daniel Bossuet, Charles Jardin, Amand Perot, William Huertin,\r\nJohn Vezier, Peter Dennys Doctr, John Many, Peter Tillou, Peter Ebrard,\r\nHenry Collier, John David, Noe Cazalet, Gabriel Le Boyteix, Jr., Elias\r\nGroséllier, Andrew Girand, Francis Baumier, James Des Brosses, James\r\nRenaudet, Lawrence Cornisleau, Daniel Mesnard, John Ganeau, Peter\r\nMonget, John Hastier, David Le Telier, Jean Le Chevalier, Philip\r\nGilliot, Abraham Bertrand, Abraham Butler, Daniel Cromelin, John\r\nPintard, Abraham Pontereau, Peter Burton, Stephen Bourdet, Paul Pinaud,\r\nPeter Fauconnier. As the same old chronicle says: 'Here followeth the\r\nnames of the widow women, and others, members of the same church:'\r\nRachel Ebrard, Elizabeth Heurtin, Marie Anne Ablin, Magdalene\r\nFauconnier, Anne Bachan, Mary Perot, Susanne Magle Bosset, Mary\r\nSergeran, Esther Bouniot, Marquise Boyteul, Martha Brown, Renée Mary\r\nRou, Judith Morget, Martha Pentereau, Mary Bargeau, Susanne Boutecon,\r\nSusanne Ford, Mary Oaks, Mary Ellison, Martha Perot, Esther Masse,\r\nElizabeth Tillou.\r\n\r\nAt this period, a Rey. Mr. Moulinars was the assistant minister of Mr.\r\nRou, and united with the party who opposed him, and they also have left\r\nrecords of their views, in which they claim to have paid Mr. Rou in\r\nfull, and that then the Consistory could dismiss him when they saw fit.\r\n'We are not indebted unto Mr. Rou one farthing for all the time he hath\r\nserved us,' is their language, and to their official act are the\r\nsignatures of 'I. I. Moulinars, ministre, John Barheweeld, Louis\r\nCarréansien, Abraham Gouneau, ans., Fran. Cazalz, ans., René Het, ans.,\r\nJanuary twenty-eighth, 1724.' Still the Council decided in favor of Mr.\r\nRou, and were 'of opinion that the said congregation be admonished that\r\nevery person in it do all in his power to preserve peace and unanimity\r\nin their congregation.' That body also advised 'that the ministers of\r\nthe French congregation who shall officiate next Sunday be ordered to\r\nread publicly the said opinion and admonition, immediately after divine\r\nservice in the forenoon.'\r\n\r\nAll these efforts did not produce harmony in the French congregation.\r\nMoulinars evidently had a restless spirit, and was much opposed to the\r\nChurch of England, at that time the established religion of the New-York\r\nColony, and respected by many of the Huguenots. Through his efforts, a\r\n'meeting-house' was erected for the French refugees at New-Rochelle, and\r\nits members numbered one hundred persons. One old document (May twelfth,\r\n1725) records 'that the said Mr. Moulinars has declared (as can be\r\nproved) that he finds our Church (Episcopal) and that of Rome as like\r\none another as two fishes can be ... and one of the chiefest reasons of\r\nthis violence against Mr. Rou has no other ground than his constant\r\naffection to the Church, and the public approbation he has at all times\r\ngiven to its ceremonies and doctrines.' The churchmen also complained\r\nthat Moulinars caused 'great prejudice in general to the Church of\r\nEngland, and in particular to that of New-Rochelle, where he would come\r\nquarterly from New-York, and plead among the people.' New-Rochelle was\r\nthen a parish, and its rector, of course, considered the French preacher\r\na dissenter. From the parochial account of the former, the town embraced\r\ntwo Quaker families, three Dutch ones, four Lutherans, and several of\r\nthe French; and the Huguenots settling among them in the year 1726,\r\ngathered a congregation of 'about one hundred persons.'\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Messrs. Daille and Labord appear early to have served the\r\nFrench Protestant Church in New-York; but of the latter we have learned\r\nnothing. The former had been pastor awhile to the French Protestants in\r\nBoston. About the year 1690, the Dutch Church Consistory employed Mr.\r\nDaille to preach to the French in their own language, at New-York, and\r\nalso to conduct the religious services of the pulpit during a part of\r\nthe Lord's day.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, Jean Carll was the pastor of Du Saint-Esprit, for we discover\r\nhis name, together with Peter Vallade and James Desbrosses, the present\r\nelders, Daniel Bounet and Charles Jardine, the present deacons of the\r\nFrench Protestant Church in the city of New-York, to a petition for a\r\ncharter. Their church property, they state, was purchased agreeable to\r\nan act of the Legislature in 1703; 'a decent edifice for the public\r\nworship of Almighty God, according to the usage of the French Protestant\r\nChurches,' erected; 'and the residue they devoted to the use of the\r\ncemetery or church-yard for the interment of their dead.' 'Ever since,\r\nthey have maintained a succession of ministers there, who have dispensed\r\nthe ordinances of divine worship in the French tongue.' Besides this\r\nproperty, they received the rents of a house and parcel of ground in the\r\ntownship of Breucklin, on Nassau Island, near the ferry, and the French\r\nChurch now asked from the legislative authorities a proper charter. With\r\nhonest pride they boast, in their petition, of the most inviolable\r\nfidelity 'to all those indulgent states and powers who protected them\r\nfrom the merciless rage of their Popish persecutors. As your petitioners\r\nin particular are the descendants of a people who suffered the greatest\r\nhardships and flew from their native country to preserve the purity of\r\nthe Christian faith and worship.' Eloquent and truthful words. The\r\nHuguenots were a great blessing to every land where they settled. The\r\nname of their body politic was 'the Ministers, Elders, and Deacons of\r\nthe Protestant French Church of the City of New-York.'\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War, New-York became literally a city of\r\nprisons. The pews of the North Dutch Church in William street were used\r\nfor fuel, and eight hundred American prisoners were incarcerated within\r\nits old walls, without fuel or bedding, and here many died from cold and\r\nstarvation. The 'Brick Meeting,' in Beekman street, was also used at\r\nfirst for a prison, and afterward changed into an hospital. The\r\nRose-street Friends' Meeting-house and the Wall-street Presbyterian\r\nchurch became hospitals also, and Du Saint-Esprit was made a dépôt for\r\nmilitary stores. The Middle Dutch, the present Post-Office, stripped of\r\nits sacred furniture, was the abode of three thousand American\r\nprisoners. 'Here,' says John Pintard, himself a most respectable member\r\nof the Protestant French Church near by, and an eye-witness of the\r\ndisgusting sight, 'the prisoners taken on Long Island and at Fort\r\nWashington--sick, wounded, and well--were all indiscriminately huddled\r\ntogether by hundreds and thousands, large numbers of whom died by\r\ndisease, and many were undoubtedly poisoned by their inhuman attendants,\r\nfor the sake of their watches or silver buckles.' The suffering inmates\r\nwere afterward transferred to other places of confinement, and the\r\nvenerable building turned into a riding-school for the British dragoons.\r\nIts floor was taken up, the ground covered with tan-bark, and the\r\nwindow-sashes removed for this sacrilegious purpose. The French Huguenot\r\nchurch remained in its original form one hundred and thirty years, until\r\n1834, when it was taken down, the grounds sold, and its dead disinterred\r\nand removed to other resting-places. In their native lands, the ashes of\r\nthe Huguenots would sometimes be dug up, burned, and scattered by\r\npersecuting hands to the winds of the heavens; but in ours--Protestant\r\nand more favored--their sainted dust, wherever buried, is watched and\r\npreserved with pious care and affectionate fidelity. It would be a\r\npleasant but an impossible duty to trace the histories of thousands of\r\nour most excellent New-Yorkers, whose pious ancestors worshiped God in\r\nthe old sanctuary of Du Saint-Esprit, and whose ashes reposed, in\r\nChristian hope, alongside of its humble and venerable walls. But records\r\nare scarcely to be found. Still we may love their characters and strive\r\nto imitate their noble and generous virtues. Hallowed be those precious\r\nmemories!\r\n\r\nThe remains of many Huguenots repose among the innumerable dead of old\r\nTrinity church-yard, that vast home of the departed; and where can be\r\nfound their memorials of honor, patriotism, and exalted piety. Here lie\r\nthe ashes of the Rev. Elias Neau, near its northern porch. He was a man\r\nof more than ordinary eminence; his life useful, beneficial, and\r\nreligious. Mr. Neau was the paternal ancestor of Mrs. Commodore Oliver\r\nH. Perry, of Rhode-Island.\r\n\r\nPrevious to his escape from France, he suffered confinement for several\r\nyears in the prisons and galleys, and while in his dungeons, learned by\r\nheart the liturgy, and became attached to the English Church service.\r\nWhen the Rev. Mr. Vesey was rector of Trinity, Mr. Neau was appointed\r\ncatechist of that church. For a number of years, he faithfully\r\ndischarged the duties of this important appointment among the Indians\r\nand the slaves, of whom some fifteen hundred were catechumens in the\r\ncity of New-York. He could only collect them together on Sunday nights,\r\nafter the last public services; and when properly prepared, would\r\npresent them to Mr. Vesey, for baptism. Mr. Neau may be said to have\r\nfounded the Free School of Trinity, an institution so useful and well\r\nknown among the noble charities of New-York. Its former tablet is still\r\npreserved among the mementoes of the olden time. This excellent Huguenot\r\nclosed his useful life in 1722, resting from his earthly labors\r\nalongside of God's holy temple, where he had so long worshiped and'\r\nserved him.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Elias Neau, his wife Susannah, and daughter Judith, left\r\nFrance, for America, with the Huguenots, about 1685. Judith married a\r\nRabineau in New-York, and their only child, Marie, married Daniel\r\nAyrault; their issue was six sons and five daughters; and the second\r\nson, Daniel, married Susannah Eargrass, whose children were Daniel and\r\nMary Ayrault. Mary married Benjamin Mason, and their children were two\r\nsons and two daughters. The eldest son, Benjamin Mason, M.D., was\r\neducated in England, marrying Margaret Champlin, of Newport, R. I., and\r\ntheir issue was three sons and one daughter. This daughter, Elizabeth\r\nChamplin Mason, became the wife of the patriotic and brave Captain\r\nOliver Hazard Perry, of the United States Navy. From this last union\r\nwere four sons and one daughter, Elizabeth Mason Perry. This daughter\r\nmarried the Rev. Francis Vinton; and their children, seven sons and\r\nthree daughters, make the _eighth_ generation from their venerable,\r\npious Huguenot ancestor; Mr. Vinton himself serving in holy things at\r\nthe same sacred altar of old Trinity, where the Rev. Elias Neau\r\nworshiped, and after a lapse of one hundred and fifty years. How\r\nenduring is sacred truth! It will abide forever.\r\n\r\nJohannes Delamontagnie was another Huguenot refugee, who reached\r\nNew-Amsterdam in 1773. Governor Kieft appointed him a member of his\r\ncouncil, then the second office in the colonial government. He purchased\r\na farm of two hundred acres at Harlaem, for seven hundred and twenty\r\ndollars, naming it' Vriedendel', (Valley of Peace.) The land was\r\nsituated East of the Eighth Avenue, between Ninety-third street and the\r\nHarlem river. His grandson, named Vincent, died in May, 1773, at the\r\nvery advanced age of one hundred and sixteen years. Numerous descendants\r\nare still among us from this early French Protestant emigrant, although\r\nsome abbreviations have been made in the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANE OF OUR COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile sharing the Provost-Marshal's office, in Portsmouth, Virginia, I\r\nwas struck with the almost utter absence of cultivation of the\r\nunderstanding of the people living there or in the surrounding country,\r\nwho entered to obtain passes, or for other purposes. Scarce one of them\r\nat first appreciated the nature of an oath, which they all shrank from\r\ntaking, or objected to, when proposed as a condition of obtaining either\r\nthe passes or the protection they wished. They were not merely\r\nilliterate and untaught, but showed also an extremely low grade of\r\nreasoning power. There was, indeed, in most cases, but little\r\ndevelopment even of those lower grades of intellectual ability which are\r\nso frequently seen in simply 'illiterate' persons. They hung back from\r\ncommitting themselves, in any way, as friendly to us, though they\r\nevidently did not feel that hatred or ill-feeling characteristic of the\r\nbolder secessionist. I afterward saw many more of these people, in\r\nNorfolk, at our office. With our continued occupancy of the city, and in\r\nthe absence of any aggressive action by our Government, they presented\r\nthemselves more frequently. Among them there was occasionally one who\r\navowed himself, without reservation, for the Union. These people are, I\r\nam confident, the only ones in the rebellious States who are other than\r\nsecessionists. Love of the Union--that which the reader identifies with\r\npatriotism and nationality--they had not, because this can nowhere be\r\nfound in the rebellious States, except in isolated instances. That they\r\nremained silent and subdued under the progress of the acts of the\r\nsecessionists, and never raised hand or voice in contradiction to them,\r\nproves in this class an absence of that force of character, or of that\r\nmoral courage or 'energy' which is the distinguishing attribute of our\r\nNorthern people, even the poorest, and this was also evinced when we\r\nfirst occupied the town. It was not peacefulness of disposition which I\r\nremarked, but the lack first, of _decision of character_, and next, of\r\n_decision of understanding_ respecting the questions at issue. In\r\nconversation they could express only very simple notions, nor could I\r\npromptly elicit more from them. Even their feelings lacked the qualities\r\nof force and intensity. Yet this class is next to the ruling and leading\r\npart of the population, which is composed of planters, cotton, tobacco,\r\nand produce factors' families, professional men, and others, who court\r\npatronage, including shopkeepers, small manufacturers, and\r\nmoney-lenders, and who support in political affairs _their_ own\r\n_clientéle_ of supporters. The latter people constitute the determinedly\r\nrebellious. It is the first class only, that we can regard as the sole\r\nsupport to Unionism which there is in the rebellious States; but in them\r\nwe shall find no moral force or power even when the reign of the leading\r\nclass shall have ceased. These facts, I am aware, are in striking\r\ncontrast to the usual estimation of the courage and daring of the people\r\nof the South. But the usual estimation is true only of the people who\r\nhave a concert of interest in slavery, and who, whatever their petty\r\ndisagreements may be, concur in their politics. Nowhere, therefore, is\r\ndemocracy less actual than in the rebellious States; a ruling and a\r\nsubservient class exists precisely as in England or Austria. To increase\r\nthe latter, comprising the people I first described, is by no means to\r\nincrease the power and extend the domination of the other, but the\r\ncontrary; and undoubtedly the diminution of their number by the\r\nsacrifice of their lives in the rebellion, is considered by the chief\r\nmanagers as desirable, in view of the success of their scheme of polity\r\nand government.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in enforcing their plan of formally identifying the various\r\nStates with secession--the form being the ordinance of secession--the\r\nsuffrages and sense of this ruled class were ruthlessly unheeded, and\r\ndenied validity.\r\n\r\nHence we say that several of the rebel States did not 'secede,' it being\r\ntrue that a majority of the people expressed their aversion to\r\nrebellion--this majority being, for the occasion, the ruling one, in\r\nvirtue of the principle to which _all_ equally deferred. But it is the\r\n_will_ of the ruling or aristocratic class in all similar cases, and not\r\nthe forms of law or principle, which accomplishes such changes, whether\r\naccording to the forms of law or in disregard of them. _This class are\r\nnever respecters of principle_, but rule in virtue not of what\r\nprinciples empower them to do, as a majority, but of the power of might\r\nand dominant strength. It is obvious that were they to do the former,\r\nthey would be destitute of any other power than pertained to the whole\r\ncommunity, they in part, and others equally. Accordingly, they having,\r\nonce for all, in their adhesion to the Constitution, and again on its\r\neve, consented to an election, and therefore its issue, when a majority\r\nof the entire nation elected a representative of the Chicago\r\ndeclaration, they reverted to their power of might, and rebelled.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, the subversion of an _un_principled (the term is of\r\nthe strictest accuracy) ruling class, or aristocracy, and the\r\nobliteration of their peculiar power, that we have to accomplish. This\r\npower consists wholly of certain peculiar interests as masters. To\r\ndeprive them of these, is the only possible terminus of the question at\r\nissue. So plain and palpable is the whole question, that we need hardly\r\nsay that their whole scheme of government turns upon and clusters about\r\nthis interest. For the preservation of this interest, which they thought\r\ntouched by the advances of freedom, they rushed into war, and for the\r\nconservation of their power, they base all upon it.\r\n\r\nThat the general question of property is at all affected by the\r\nobliteration of this interest, is an egregious error. The property, the\r\npossession of which is valid and inviolable, is the product of human\r\nskill, industry, labor, invention, or what not. Nor does it confer\r\npolitical dominance on its possessor. The slaveholders are the only\r\nclass in the nation whose property interest does so; and reciprocally,\r\nthe sole object of the maintenance of this interest is the maintenance\r\nof this dominant power. Whether it be or be not criminal to possess it,\r\nis not the point upon which the demand for the abrogation of this\r\ninterest turns--at least, there is no legal precedent to so think of\r\nit--but it turns upon the fact that it is ruinous to a republican\r\nsystem. Not the whole force of republicanism can at once maintain itself\r\nand conserve and cherish _that_; and _if_ it, to a certain extent\r\ncherish it, it will do no more than continue the basis of the power of a\r\nclass, who will use it in the only way it can be used, namely, in\r\ncontesting whatever interests, principles, or practices are averse to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHence, for more than thirty years not a single widely beneficent measure\r\nof legislation has been allowed to pass and become operative by the\r\nrepresentatives of this interest. So the South, the seat of this\r\ninterest, has always been, in its own estimation, 'the South,' despite\r\nwhat we have said of a national Union; rendering it impossible that the\r\nrepublican patriot could _unite_ in one sentiment that which this\r\nparticular interest _divided_ itself from.\r\n\r\nThat humanity should dictate the freedom of the slave in the interests\r\nof morality, is but natural. With this we have nothing to do; but that\r\nthe being of an 'aristocracy based on property' should be excluded from\r\nthe bounds of a republic, is of an importance to it and mankind, not\r\nsecond to religion itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOLLY O'MOLLY PAPERS.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese thief, they say, greases himself and sticks knives in his\r\nqueue, so that it is nest to impossible to catch him. Old Time is about\r\nas slippery a fellow as a Chinese thief. I don't know that he has a\r\nqueue, and have fancied that when queues were worn, and Time was in the\r\nfashion, some old fogy, too slow to keep up with him, caught him by his\r\nqueue. Time, who never yet was detained by mortal grasp, pressed on and\r\nleft it behind. Since then he has cultivated only that _ungraspable_\r\nforelock. Fleet of foot as he is, it is thought that Young America, with\r\nhis telegraphs, will, in the long run--that is, in the race round the\r\nworld--come out 'a leetle ahead' of him. Indeed, Young America talks of\r\nannihilating Time. But, though he may have 'one foot on land and one on\r\nsea,' he has no commission to 'swear that time shall be no more.'\r\n\r\nWe are a fast people--no mistake. Perhaps a little too fast. Did we only\r\n_anticipate_ Time, and pull down only what, with those sure sappers and\r\nminers of his, the years, he is certain to overthrow, it would be well\r\nenough. But we wish to destroy what he has left untouched, or would\r\nremodel it, would modernize it.\r\n\r\nThe dear old creed of our fathers; _old_ creed, did I say? Ever _new_\r\ncreed; for what Time passes by, never grows old. This we would change to\r\nsuit ourselves, fancying we have outgrown it; or thinking it, like the\r\nSpartan iron coin, too cumbersome for general circulation, we would\r\nchange it for lighter, and as we think, more precious metal. We deem\r\nthis the age of gold.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal said about our progress toward mental and moral\r\nperfection. Some seem to think that education is all we need to make us\r\nperfect moral beings. 'Ignorance is the cause of all evil;' all things\r\nare as they should be; our minds are as the _camera obscura_, a darkened\r\nchamber which a few rays enter, and every thing only _appears_ upside\r\ndown. All we need is more light, to see to set every thing straight. It\r\nis true that we see things in an inverted position; but in this\r\nprison-house, we shall never have light enough to see them as they are.\r\nThere is a lens that corrects these false impressions, and the light\r\nthat enters through it shows us many things upside down that we before\r\nsaw right side up, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nIntoxicated with conceit, we fancy that we have but to eat of the tree\r\nof knowledge to become gods. Some go so far as to say that we are even\r\nnow a part of divinity. 'The universe--it is God;' therefore we, as a\r\npart of the universe, are a part of God. The universe God? If it is a\r\npart of God, (which it is not,) it is so small a fraction that in all\r\nmathematical calculations, it would be called nothing. Were all the\r\nminds in the universe mingled into one, that one would be but as a drop\r\nto the ocean that girdles Infinity--God.\r\n\r\nYou will think me too earnest. The O'Mollys were ever an earnest race\r\nand an orthodox race. With what earnestness did they, in the good old\r\ntimes, from those peculiarly Irish goblets, that wouldn't stand, drink\r\nIrish whisky, till they partook of the nature of the goblets and came to\r\nthe floor with them--the goblets with a crash, but the O'Mollys got up\r\nas sound as a bell, and next morning were ready to attend mass, into\r\nwhich they entered with as much earnestness as into their revelry. No\r\npeople equal the Irish in earnestness in _spiritual_ matters. It is\r\nperhaps not for a female O'Molly to record these roysterings; but I am\r\nthe last of my race, I only am left to chronicle the glorious doings of\r\nmy ancestors. Then, too, on our escutcheon is one of these same goblets.\r\nThe origin of this escutcheon it has been a family task to trace, with\r\nbut little success, however, till the present generation, I had a cousin\r\nwho inherited all the family pride. He became a martyr to his devotion\r\nto the 'time-honored custom;' for alas! good old Irish whisky is as\r\ncertainly among the 'things that were,' as are the Irish kings. Some\r\nhave shrewdly thought that it was the only real Irish king. Well, then,\r\nit is owing to this cousin's loyalty to the usurper, or rather\r\npretender, that I am the family chronicler. He was wonderfully\r\ningenious; could from the slightest hint guess at the whole story; he\r\nwas equal to those naturalists who from one bone can make out the\r\nanimal. With the remains of an old family tradition for his clue, he\r\ntraced the origin of the escutcheon. It was on this wise. One of the\r\nIrish kings, traveling incog., stopped at the castle of an O'Molly, who,\r\nthough he knew not the rank of his guest, entertained him with the\r\nutmost hospitality. Freely the goblet circulated, and as they two only\r\ndrank from it, it was soon broken. The king, next morning, revealed his\r\nrank to his host, and dubbed him _Knight of the Goblet_; hence the\r\ngoblet on the shield, an emblem of hospitality. And never has there been\r\na stain on the escutcheon of the O'Mollys.\r\n\r\nI said they were an orthodox race. Perhaps they were too bigoted in\r\ntheir adherence to the old customs and the old faith. But there is too\r\nmuch latitudinarianism in this nineteenth century. Too many think it\r\nmatters but little what a man's belief is, if he is only sincere in it;\r\nas if the consequences of any thing could be averted by not believing in\r\nit. The hands of your clock may be so turned around that they will point\r\nto the wrong figures; does that change the time? Or, what amounts to the\r\nsame thing, it may be so ill-regulated, the machinery may be so out of\r\ngear, that you are deceived. But morning, noon, and night do not\r\nregulate their face by your clock. There is a dial that unerringly marks\r\n'the stately stoppings' of the sun of suns--let us regulate our belief\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nTruth is not like the clouds that, it is said, take the form of the\r\ncountry over which they pass. It does not change to suit your condition\r\nor mind, and we can not change it, neither can we dilute it. What is\r\nnot truth is falsehood, and this, as the acid dissolved the pearl which\r\nCleopatra dropped into it, will dissolve truth and convert it into its\r\nown nature.\r\n\r\nHow little we prize truth, even if we do not thus attempt to dissolve\r\nit. It lies in our heart unheeded. We are almost as unconscious of it as\r\nthe oyster is of the pearl within his shell.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, having a daughter 'to finish,' looked over\r\nadvertisement after advertisement, till finally her eye lighted on the\r\ncircular of Mrs. Smith's Female Seminary, situated in the quiet and\r\nsalubrious village of----, within a few minutes' walk of three or four\r\nplaces of worship.... Great care taken of the health, manners, and\r\nmorals of the pupils.... Exercise insisted on.... Those whose parents\r\nmay wish it, allowed the use of a quiet saddle-horse.... The pupils\r\nunder the immediate supervision of the principal.... They have all the\r\ncomforts of Home, etc., etc. All this, in addition to a thorough course\r\nof instruction in every thing ever heard of, not forgetting the Use of\r\nthe Globes....

Embroidery, ten different\r\nkinds.... Terms, $--per annum. Then follows an imposing list of\r\nreferences, Reverends, Esquires, and Honorables.\r\n\r\nMy friend, taken with this, decided that her daughter, Bessie, should go\r\nto Mrs. Smith's seminary. Accordingly, a short time before the\r\ncommencement of the next term, she accompanied her there; was so pleased\r\nwith Mrs. Smith's bland politeness toward herself, and her affectionate,\r\nalmost matronly manner toward her daughter, that she came away relieved\r\nof all anxiety on Bessie's account.\r\n\r\nI hope I am not 'violating the sanctity of private correspondence,' in\r\ngiving the following letter from Bessie:\r\n\r\n     'MY DEAR MOLLY: I received yours last evening, and hasten\r\n     to reply, though, to answer your numerous questions will take me\r\n     till after prayers. I shall consequently, as I am not the _model_\r\n     pupil, get an absence-mark. You inquire as to the advancement I am\r\n     making in my studies. One thing is certain, I shall not come home\r\n     the _encyclopedia_ mother expects. I'll not say that this\r\n     'flourishing institution' is a humbug; but will say that facts and\r\n     the circular do not exactly tally. A few of the facts I will give,\r\n     and you can judge for yourself.\r\n\r\n     'To begin with the supervision of the bland, portly principal. She\r\n     enters the school-room makes a few criticisms, asks a blessing at\r\n     the table; occasionally a misdemeanor is reported to her, when the\r\n     offender is cited to the august presence, and duly reprimanded, not\r\n     according to the quality of the offense, but, in an inverse\r\n     proportion, to the _quality_ of the offender. Her teachers do the\r\n     mental drudgery of the institution. Their life is about as varied\r\n     and pleasant as that of a churn-dog; that is, if the dog were kept\r\n     churning all day. The balancing of accounts with them, and the\r\n     making out of the bills for the patrons, are certainly 'under the\r\n     immediate supervision of the principal.' These bills, which fond\r\n     parents suppose amount to $--, have a rat-like appendage (excuse\r\n     the expression) of 'incidentals,' that wasn't drawn into the\r\n     _modest_ 'terms' of the circular. I nearly forgot her Friday\r\n     afternoon lectures, for which she sometimes substitutes _Hannah\r\n     More_, and the _Young Ladies' Own Book_. These lectures are as\r\n     commonplace as expatiations on the importance of cultivating the\r\n     mind and heart, interspersed with 'hence the necessity,' and\r\n     'highly essential,' can mate them. Last Friday, as she was\r\n     enlarging on the advantage of having had our birth in an\r\n     enlightened, Christian land, Jenny Dean wrote on a slip of paper,\r\n     and poked it over to me,'not _have_ our _berth_ in a Christian\r\n     land.' Mrs. Smith saw her, confiscated the paper, and gave her a\r\n     severe reprimand, for evincing such a disposition to trifle with\r\n     serious things. Jenny was right; if ours is a Christian berth,\r\n     commend me to heathendom. Mrs. Smith neglected to mention in her\r\n     circular the instruction in _entomology_ her pupils receive;\r\n     probably because they are, as 'the Autocrat' says every traveler\r\n     is, _self-taught_. I wish she would omit a few lessons in the 'Use\r\n     of the Globes,' and teach the servants the use of hot water,\r\n     corrosive sublimate, and roach-poison.\r\n\r\n     'I begin to understand why it is called a _finishing_ school. Don't\r\n     tell mother, or she will have me put in quarantine when I return.\r\n     But, really, I'm getting quite thin; the demand made on my system\r\n     being greater than the supply of 'plain wholesome food.' Now, I'm\r\n     not going to complain of this 'plain wholesome,' though the butter\r\n     is sometimes strong, the lamb (?) ditto, (see circular in regard to\r\n     home comforts.) But I wish you would suggest to mother the\r\n     propriety of sending me another box; the last we finished in short\r\n     metre. You know this is a _finishing_ school. Only one of the girls\r\n     of our hall is too mean to _treat_, and she gets _lots of things_\r\n     from home. Yesterday, she brought a beautiful basket of apples to\r\n     my room, just to show me how nice they _looked_. I suggested that\r\n     'the proof of the pudding was in the _eating_.' She was too obtuse\r\n     to take the hint. It is almost sacrilege to talk so about her; she\r\n     is Mrs. Smith's _model_ pupil, which, as I before informed you,\r\n     your humble servant is not. Jenny Dean and I are always getting\r\n     into trouble. Somehow, we've got a bad name, and our _slightest_\r\n     misdemeanor is noticed, so we think that we 'might as well be\r\n     killed for a sheep as a lamb:' in other words, if the camel's back\r\n     must be broken, it may as well be by a hundred-pound weight as a\r\n     feather.\r\n\r\n     'We have an Italian music-teacher, chiefly noticeable for his\r\n     length of limb, an exiled nobleman, of course. I hinted to Jenny a\r\n     doubt as to his nobility. She said, if he didn't belong to 'the\r\n     Brahmin caste,' he did to the _Bramah cast_, and that was the next\r\n     thing to it. He has become violently attached to the assistant\r\n     music-teacher, who is very thin. Now, he has been teaching us to\r\n     screech 'For Bonnie Annie Laurie.' Jenny persists in calling it,\r\n     For bony Annie Laurie. The gravity with which he each time corrects\r\n     her is amusing. Signor _executes_ to the admiration of patrons,\r\n     etc.; though music on those horrid pianos is rather like music on\r\n     the rack. Of the six inventoried, (see circular,) two are in the\r\n     garret, superannuated; two more ought to be; as for the remaining\r\n     two, on one of them your friend Bessie practices, and it is too\r\n     great a trial to her nerves to speak of them. You say that you have\r\n     music in your souls that I must learn to express for you; that you\r\n     can't turn a tune to save your life; that the attempt is like the\r\n     attempt to make a curve of straight lines, (you see how I remember\r\n     all you write or say.) If you were here, you would wish all the\r\n     melody of the institution _voiceless_, and that it wouldn't ooze\r\n     out at the finger-ends.\r\n\r\n     'As for drawing, (see circular,) this department, to save expense,\r\n     Mrs. Smith's _accomplished_ daughter has. She teaches crayoning and\r\n     pencilling--a few learn to daub in water-colors--but this she\r\n     rather discourages, as colored crayoning is much easier and quite\r\n     as _showy_--this is the word for everything here. Miss Smith also\r\n     teaches French--_Anglicized_. It is hardly worth while to mention\r\n     'the solids,' as these are shoved into a corner to give place to\r\n     the accomplishments.... As for the exercise--we do, two or three\r\n     times a week, file down the street, then file back again--are thus\r\n     exhibited to the admiring gaze of the Esquires, Reverends, and\r\n     Honorables, (see circular.) The 'quiet saddle-horse' (see circular)\r\n     is a 'poetic fiction,' a 'pious fraud'--as much a myth as Pegasus\r\n     himself. Though there is a tradition in the school that, a short\r\n     time after the founding of the establishment, the late lamented\r\n     husband of Mrs. Smith, who was fond of equestrian exercise, kept a\r\n     horse--which a parlor-boarder, niece of Mrs. Smith, was allowed to\r\n     ride--hence the provision in the circular. One part of it is\r\n     correct--he doubtless is now a _very_ quiet saddle-horse--that is,\r\n     if he had not the tenacity of life of the _lamb_ that, judging from\r\n     the savory odor, we are to have for dinner, ('what's in a name?')\r\n     Perhaps the 'late lamented' was as fond of his nag as was the man\r\n     who entertained his guests with his horse in the form of soup.\r\n     Jenny Dean says that is what she calls true _horse-pitality_.\r\n\r\n     'There goes the bell. Don't forget the box. Mrs. Smith--unlike many\r\n     principals--approves of them--the reason you can guess--the _fact_\r\n     please mention to mother. In haste,\r\n\r\n     BESSIE.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly consistent with my regard for the 'dear reader,' to add\r\nany thing by way of remark on this true school-girl letter. But it is so\r\nsuggestive. How many circulars do tally with facts? Even in those of the\r\nbest schools, that need none of this clap-trap, there is a little\r\nhumbug. But this is rather the fault of the patrons; like Bessie's\r\nmother, they will hardly look at a plain advertisement. The truth is, we\r\nlove to be humbugged. Among the 'wants of the age' may be classed\r\n_humbug_.\r\n\r\nI have read of a painter with disproportionately short legs, who, in all\r\nhis pictures of human figures--from Moses down to the Mayor, done in\r\nheroic style--substituted his own legs. Your thorough utilitarian,\r\ndeficient in imagination, his idea of mental symmetry being his own\r\nmental proportions, thinks no mind well balanced that has not a similar\r\ndeficiency. He is a believer in nothing but the real and the useful--all\r\nelse is stuff and nonsense; to him a mountain is a high elevation of\r\nland; a plain, a level tract; a forest, so much timber in a green\r\nstate; a cloud, a collection of vapor. He sees in every thing just what\r\nthere is in it and nothing more. Why does any one see more? It has been\r\na puzzle to me, the undefinable longing I have sometimes felt in looking\r\nat a beautiful scene; a feeling akin to this, though lower, is that\r\nawakened by the fragrance of some flowers--it is so unsatisfactory, you\r\nwish to _taste_ them. These somethings bring up a shadow of 'shadowy\r\nrecollections,' an echo of an echo of a past so indistinct, so dimly\r\ndistant, that it seems to have been a part of another life.\r\n\r\nIt may be that all earthly things are but types of spiritual things in a\r\nfuture spiritual existence--hence the yearning; or they may be\r\nexpressions of spiritual things in a past spiritual existence--hence the\r\n'shadowy recollections.' One thing is certain: all beauty and grandeur\r\nare faint expressions of the ideas of the All-Father; therefore, O\r\nutilitarian! you do wrong to ask of them: 'What use?' Better cultivate a\r\ntaste for them, and with this taste an earnest desire to look into that\r\nMind and read there thoughts of which Mont Blanc and the exquisite\r\nflowers are but feeble utterances.\r\n\r\nHow the Great Teacher has lavished on us illustrations of his goodness,\r\nas if he would in some way make it plain to all, '_what use_.' There\r\n_must_ be a use in every thing he creates. Every dew-drop that the\r\nmeanest weed has wooed and won from the atmosphere, is as tenderly cared\r\nfor by him, as the stream is that supplies your mill-pond; every briny\r\ntear on the infant's cheek, as the ocean that bears on its bosom your\r\nmerchant-vessels. What use? Have not some things been made useless--in\r\nyour sense of the term--that they might be preserved from destruction?\r\nThe gorgeous-plumed birds, and brightly-enameled fish of the tropics,\r\nare unfit for food--so, to your mind, of no use. I wonder if this holds\r\ngood in cannibal countries; if so, it would be no protection to poor\r\nMolly O'Molly if she were there.\r\n\r\nI, too, am a believer in the real and the useful; but to me, the sphere\r\nof both is almost infinite. Are not the feelings awakened on viewing a\r\nbeautiful sunset, as real as your satisfaction after eating roast-beef?\r\nThough I acknowledge that no one can thoroughly enjoy the one, who feels\r\nthe need of the other; if then weighed in the scale, the sunset would\r\n'kick the beam.' All things 'by season seasoned are to their right\r\npraise and true perfection.' It would, for instance, be rather out of\r\nplace to talk of the beauty of the stars to the houseless wanderer, for\r\nwhom there were no 'cheerful lights of home;' to expatiate on the\r\nloveliness of the moon to him who must spend the chill night with no\r\nother covering than her 'silver mantle.'... Moonlight and memory are\r\nassociated together in my mind--reflections of a set sun, wrapping in\r\ntheir calm, beautiful light, all things, even the graves of those we\r\nlove.... I have thought that the murmur of the brook was the _voice of\r\nSilence_. Moonlight expresses to the eye--_silence_.... 'All this\r\nunreal?' I beg your pardon; I claim for my feelings the same reality\r\nthat you claim for yours. Is only what is gross real? Is not the sky as\r\nreal as the mountain that pierces it? Is there more reality in the chink\r\nof the dollar than in 'the music of the spheres'? This first is, I\r\nacknowledge, to me a pleasant sound, though only 'heard at rarest\r\nintervals.'... Yet I am rather inclined to believe in the reality of\r\nthe music of the spheres; it is too ethereal, too spiritual a music for\r\nthe ear to _sense_ it; the food and drink of the gods, ambrosia and\r\nnectar, even were we to swallow them, could our mortal palates taste\r\nthem? Even thus may we drink in the music of the spheres, and, strange\r\nas it may seem, the more _ear_ we have, the less likely we will be to\r\nhear it.\r\n\r\nBut--_not_ 'in this connection,' in no connection--the utilitarian also\r\nthoroughly despises cobweb theories, as he terms them. The world owes\r\nits greatest achievements to theories--cobwebs they may be. In caves\r\nhave been found books of stone, whose nucleus was but cobweb; along\r\nthese webs the calcareous solution ran, and hardened into stone. A\r\ncobweb theory has been the thread, on which, drop by drop, as it were,\r\nexperiments have run and hardened into a possibility on which might be\r\nhung a _steam-boat_.\r\n\r\nThere goes the night-train. Every morning as the engine with its train\r\npasses, the dark smoke rushing out of the chimney is touched by the rays\r\nof the rising sun and made glorious. I doubt not my enjoyment in looking\r\nat it is as real as that of the heaviest stockholder. Here I 'pitch my\r\nfoot against'--as Paley says in his famous watch-argument--_a\r\nquotation_.\r\n\r\n  'Life is transfigured in the soft and tender\r\n  Light of love, as a volume dense\r\n  Of rolling smoke becomes a wreathed splendor\r\n  In the setting sun.'\r\n\r\nBut this warm subject of love I avoid as the whale avoids the warm water\r\nof the Gulf Stream. So I will wheel about--first, one more digression:\r\nThis love, like the Gulf Stream, softens many a climate naturally as\r\ncold as that of Labrador. I just throw out this hint for the sentimental\r\nreader to enlarge upon.\r\n\r\nThat quotation from Alexander Smith reminds me of one other thing, for\r\nwhich your utilitarian has a sovereign contempt--that is _poetry_. What\r\nis poetry? Every thing that stirs the soul to its depths, or but crisps\r\nthe surface, is poetry--every truth does this, therefore every truth is\r\npoetry. Mind, I don't say _conversely_, etc. There--that word\r\n'conversely,' suggests to you that now you have me; there is\r\nmathematical truth, you say; you might as well attempt to raise a tree\r\nfrom cube-root as to attempt to make poetry sprout from mathematics....\r\nIs there no poetry in the marked path of the vessel on the trackless\r\nocean--no poetry in the magnificent sweep of suns and worlds through\r\nspace--in the eccentric orbit of the faithful comet--faithful, for from\r\nthe most distant errands he passes right by earth, and even Venus,\r\nlingers not a moment, but hastens back to his lord--is there no poetry\r\nin the icing over of the brook, (if you think not, read Lowell's _Sir\r\nLaunfel_,) each icy crystal being an exact geometrical figure? When 'God\r\ngeometrizes,' he also poetizes.\r\n\r\nThen if we can't say conversely all poetry is truth, yet poetry gives to\r\nevery thing she touches with her magic wand, the charm of reality. Are\r\nnot Ariel, Puck, Oberon, real characters, though but 'beings of the\r\nmind'? Shylock and Lady Macbeth are to me as real as John Wesley and\r\nHannah More, and far more real than the dimly defined heroes of\r\nPlutarch, except those that Shakspeare has thrilled with his own\r\nlife-blood--his very ghosts have an awful individuality--they are enough\r\nto make you believe in ghosts. But hark! what was that--pshaw! it is\r\nonly a screech-owl on the maple near my window--Keats' 'owl, for all his\r\nfeathers, was a-cold,' I should think this was, from his shivering\r\nnotes. Listen again! how old is the dead Time, whose age the distant\r\ntown-clock is tolling? I don't care to count--to tell the truth, that\r\nowl makes me nervous--and if it is 'the witching time of night,' I don't\r\ncare to know it--so good-night.\r\n\r\nIn haste, MOLLY O'MOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDED\r\n\r\n  Up the quiet street in the early Sunday morning, came with slow\r\n    steps and silently, two wounded soldiers:\r\n  One with shattered arm and a cruel sabre-cut on his forehead;\r\n  One with amputated leg, hobbled slowly along on crutches.\r\n\r\n  In the thunder-storm and sharp crash of terrible battle, 'mid blood,\r\n    carnage, and death,\r\n  Comrades in arms, they fell side by side; one of them senseless, the\r\n    other feeling his life-blood flowing away...\r\n  Faintness came over him, breathing the sulphurous smoke, with the\r\n    tornado of battle stunning his brain--\r\n  Faintness--forgetfulness. A vision of childhood, of the sweet\r\n    Heaven-time of life, came to him...\r\n  He hoped it was death, coming as no king of terrors, but as a\r\n    beautiful flower-crowned child,\r\n  Bidding a hero welcome to the great halls of the laurel-wreathed\r\n    dead--those who died for their country.\r\n\r\n  From this dream of the Future came sharp awaking to life; rattling\r\n    away in the ambulance...\r\n  Crashing pains shooting wildly from leg to brains--the heart now and\r\n    then grasped with steel fingers and squeezed...\r\n  The knife and the tourniquet, the rapid surgical operation: the\r\n    poor, pale fellow maimed for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At home in a hospital kindly nursed and tended, hearing for the\r\n    first time in life the name of God--not taken in vain: seeing the\r\n    good DEEDS of true woman...\r\n  Knowing that should he die he would ask no gentler sounds to cheer\r\n    him on his road to the Hereafter, than the prayer he once heard\r\n    read by The Lady in Gray to a dying soldier in the same\r\n    hospital:... thus passed he back again to life.\r\n  Now convalescent he walks in the fresh morning up the quiet street,\r\n    under the leafy shadow of lindens... he and his comrade in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the faces of both you may see that they know how earnest is\r\n    life...\r\n  The Angel of Death on the battle-field raised the veil of the\r\n    Future: transient the glimpse, but they will never forget it...\r\n  The Angel of Mercy here in the hospital bound up their wounds,\r\n    cheering their hearts with kind looks and well-spoken words of\r\n    true sympathy...\r\n  Solemnly earnest and beautiful is Life to these two wounded soldiers.\r\n\r\n  The lame one is weary, and halts by the steps of a handsome house;\r\n    his comrade with one arm helps him sit down there, on the lowest\r\n    step, leaning against the white marble balustrade.\r\n  Through lace and silk curtains, from drawing-room window, looks down the\r\n    street a beautiful woman, waiting impatiently carriage, coachman, and\r\n    footman, to carry her grandly to church.\r\n  Up comes the carriage; wide open the doors of the house: Madame\r\n    descends...\r\n  How is this?... She stops by the two wounded soldiers.\r\n\r\n  I have two sons in the army, she thought; what if they were weary and\r\n   wounded like these?\r\n  Then she speaks to the comrades in battle, and learning where they were\r\n    going, insisted on their taking her carriage. She will have no refusal:\r\n    and now John the footman, inwardly groaning, assists the lame man to\r\n    enter, then the other one takes a seat...\r\n  Off they whirl to their hospital-home, with a blessing upon the fair lady\r\n    who dared follow the teachings of ONE whom that morning she worshiped\r\n    with words ... and with deeds.\r\n\r\n  Open your hands--and your hearts--ye who stand afar off from the battle!\r\n    Lo! the wounded and dying are here at your doors.\r\n  Slumber no more; but awake, AWAKE TO THEIR CRIES!\r\n\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|Because of the length of the lines, the above piece has|\r\n|been formatted as in the original.                     |\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTOR AND THE CAPITALISTS OF NEW-YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of wealth has always been a chief proclivity of our\r\nrace. The earliest of all books (Job) mentions it with sharp reproof, as\r\nthough even then it had become a theme with the moralist. In olden time,\r\nwealth was even more unreliable than at the present day, especially as\r\nthe mere possession of gold was enough to endanger one's life. The\r\nmodern capitalist avoids this by devolving the custody of his cash on\r\nsome bank and holding its stock instead of a hoard of ingots. The\r\nscience of wealth now takes a more philosophic turn, and may be summed\r\nup in one word, _debt_. To be rich is simply to have brought the\r\ncommunity in debt to yourself; and the greater it is, the greater, of\r\ncourse, your riches. To be poor is simply to reverse this condition, and\r\nto be in debt to others. The richest of all mankind may not have on\r\nhand, in specie, at any one time, more than the amount of a single day's\r\nincome, and may be only able to show for his entire capital sundry\r\npieces of paper, representing value. This is a vast improvement upon\r\nantiquity, since then wealth was identified with the holding of bullion,\r\nfor whose protection an especial deity was invented. By a strange\r\ncoïcidence, while Pluto was god of the lower regions, a slight change of\r\nthe name represented his moneyed colleague, and Plutus presided over\r\nmoney. This connection is with sober wit hit off by Milton, who sets the\r\nfallen angels at once to work digging gold.\r\n\r\n                 'Soon had his crew\r\n  Opened into the hills a spacious wound\r\n  And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire\r\n  That riches grow in hell: that soil may best\r\n  Deserve the precious bane.'\r\n\r\nThe term 'almighty dollar' is stereotyped in modern slang, and yet the\r\nidea could not but have existed under other words in the days of those\r\nflush individuals, Midas and Croesus. The first of these moneyed\r\ngentlemen found gold too plenty for comfort, while the latter, by his\r\nunfortunate end, proved that even at that early time riches had learned\r\nto fly away. Gold entered very largely into the politics of antiquity,\r\nand by this means Crassus got a partnership in the grand triumvirate of\r\nwhich Mark Antony and Octavius formed the more active parties. Poor\r\nCrassus found, however, that to be a sleeping partner in a concern was\r\nquite a dangerous position.\r\n\r\nThe danger in which money involves its possessor, is shown with dramatic\r\npower by Scott, in his splendid medieval dream, _Ivanhoe_--in the\r\ntorture-scene, where the Jew is racked to obtain his gold. In connection\r\nwith this, it may be noted as a surprising fact that while poverty has\r\nalways been dreaded, it has ever been exempt from one term of peculiar\r\nwretchedness. With all his privation, who ever heard a poor man\r\ndesignated as a _miser_?\r\n\r\nWealth is a matter of comparison. The original term applied by the\r\nNew-England savages to the white was, _knifeman_; the possession of one\r\nimplement making the latter rich in the view of the Indian. What a vast\r\ninvestment in wampum would such a weapon be? Carrying out the same\r\ncomparative idea, it is reported as one of John Jacob Astor's sayings:\r\n'That a man worth fifty thousand dollars is as well off as though he was\r\nrich.' So strong is this comparative aspect, that the money-hunter finds\r\nhis mark continually receding, and when he has attained his hundred\r\nthousand, he is appalled by finding himself but a mere beginner compared\r\nwith others. He is but at the foot of the mountain which others have\r\nclimbed, and which towers above him in\r\n\r\n  'Many a fiery, many a frozen Alp.'\r\n\r\nHence, there is nothing more clearly proven in the psychology of man\r\nthan that accumulation utterly fails to fulfil the idea attached to\r\nriches; that is, satiety or even satisfaction, and there is often a\r\nbitter poverty of soul gnawing the owner of millions. The organic\r\nthought crops out of great and small alike. It is said that the chief of\r\nBoston merchants of the olden time, William Gray, when asked what would\r\nsatisfy him, replied, 'A little more;' while the Indian to whom the same\r\ninquiry was made, replied with aboriginal simplicity: 'All the whisky\r\nand all the tobacco in the world.' 'Nothing else?' added the inquirer.\r\n'Yes,' replied the Indian in an anxious tone, 'a little more whisky.'\r\nThe same insatiable craving is shown in poor Isaac K----, the\r\nhalf-witted boy, whose droll sayings of a half-century ago are still\r\nremembered about Boston. 'Father,' he one day exclaimed, 'I wish every\r\nbody was dead but you and me.' 'Why so, my son?' 'Why, then, father, you\r\nand I would go out and buy all the world.'\r\n\r\nThe power of gold to inflict pain on its possessor suggests deep\r\nphilosophical inquiry. Even at a superficial view, one can not but be\r\nstruck by the fatal facility which it affords to vice on the one hand,\r\nwhile on the other, how many suffer untold distress from the miser's\r\nself-inflicted poverty? There are multitudes of ruined youth, who, had\r\nthey been bound to labor instead of being reared to a life of affluent\r\nease, would have become useful men. Indeed, by merely changing the\r\ncostume of Hogarth's _Rake's Progress_, we may see it enacted by scores\r\nof young men in any of our leading cities. The writer once knew a\r\nworn-out debauchee of thirty, who, even at that early age, had got rid\r\nof an inheritance of a half-million.\r\n\r\nThe miseries of poverty are severe, and such men as Johnson and De\r\nQuincey have painted them in colors drawn from their own experience; but\r\nwhat scenes vastly more terrible might they not have sketched had they\r\nheld that master-key which unlocks the abodes of pleasure and summons\r\nthe dreadful crew of temptation?\r\n\r\nOne can not but pity the former of these, as he thinks of his wandering\r\nthe live-long night through the streets of London, unable to buy a\r\nlodging, and eating each occasional meal, not knowing when he would get\r\nanother. Yet, had as this might have been, how vastly more pitiable\r\nwould his case have been, had he fulfilled the infernal career of some\r\nof his rich cotemporaries, such as Lord Lyttelton or Lord Euston, whose\r\ndying horrors Young has so thrillingly described in his _Altamont_.\r\nHorace, who had so thoroughly studied the philosophy of life, could\r\nrefer to his lowly condition:\r\n\r\n  'Sæva paupertas et avitus apto\r\n  Cum lare fundus:'\r\n\r\nand then cite the race reared in poverty as those who saved the\r\ncommonwealth, by defeating Hannibal. His deep-toned objurgations at the\r\ndegeneracy of Rome are brought to mind by the increased dissipation and\r\nlicentiousness of American youth.\r\n\r\nWho can read lines like these without thinking of our concert-saloons\r\nand other facilities of vice? (the former happily suppressed.)\r\n\r\n  Damnasa quid non immmuit dies.\r\n\r\nThe history of capitalists would be interesting, if only as showing this\r\nsingle feature, namely, that the secret of great success lies in one's\r\nplacing himself in some channel where the stream must soon flow, and\r\nthus anticipating the future.\r\n\r\nJohnson, in the midst of his cheerless poverty, had some golden dreams,\r\nwas sensible of this fact, and illustrates it in one of those Oriental\r\napologues which occur in the _Rambler_, where he shows the tiny rivulet\r\ngradually filling a lake. With the same idea permeating his mind, he\r\nexclaims, when Thrale's brewery was to be sold: 'Here are the means of\r\nwealth beyond the dreams of avarice.'\r\n\r\nThe history of rich men also proves that it is not so much the art of\r\ngetting as that of keeping which insures success. New-York and other of\r\nour great cities contain thousands of poor men who, but a few years ago,\r\nwere heavy operators, and whose future seemed brilliant with promise.\r\nYet here they are, now struggling for mere bread.\r\n\r\nRiches are winged creatures, which break cage with strange facility and\r\nare not to be whistled back again. The array of agents, brokers,\r\nbook-keepers, and decayed gentlemen who but lately were numbered among\r\nmerchants, bankers, and ship-owners, is quite a moving spectacle. Thus\r\nA. B----, for thirty years connected with trade, during most of which\r\nperiod he was a leading member of the great cloth house of----, has been\r\nworth two hundred thousand dollars, but is now a book-keeper for a\r\nconcern in John street. I. S---- has been forty years in trade, and was\r\nconsidered successful beyond all liability to future risk; and for many\r\nyears ranked among the rich men of the street, but has since failed, and\r\nis now poor. B---- and M----, princes in the dry-goods line, built two\r\npalatial stores in Broadway, have been immensely rich, but after\r\nbattling honorably with adverse fortune, have failed. J. R----, a\r\nretired merchant, estimated at five hundred thousand dollars, holding at\r\none time fifty thousand dollars in Delaware and Hudson Canal stock,\r\nsubsequently got involved and lost all. Instances like these might be\r\nmultiplied to volumes, but they are sufficient to illustrate the\r\ntransitory nature of earthly possessions.\r\n\r\nThe great capitalists of New-York are chiefly identified with its real\r\nestate, and their wealth has generally arisen from its advance in value.\r\nFew great fortunes have lasted long, when left to 'the caprices of\r\ntrade, and the sons of our merchant-princes generally turn out poor men.\r\nThe great estates of the city are of a very limited number, and are\r\nmainly included in the names of Whitney, Goellet, Lorrillard,\r\nRhinelander, Stuyvesant, Lenox, and Astor. The first of these was so\r\nlong an _habitué_ of Wall street, Front street, and Coenties Slip, that\r\neven now, when wandering along those thoroughfares, we almost momently\r\nexpect to meet him. We can not but think that at the next turn we shall\r\nsee that shrunken and diminutive form, that meagre, hungry-looking\r\ncountenance, and that timid, nervous eye, which indicated the fear of\r\nloss or the dread approach of charity. His office was held for years in\r\nthe second story of a warehouse in Front street, a spot in whose\r\nvicinity he had passed nearly three-score years. Thither he had come in\r\nhis boyhood, a poor, friendless, New-Jersey lad, had found friends and\r\nemployment, had at last got to be a grocer, and had gradually\r\naccumulated a large capital, by the closest economy. At this time the\r\nwar of 1812 broke out, and cotton became very low, in consequence of the\r\ndifficulty of shipping it to England. Mr. Whitney had at that time a\r\nvast amount of outstanding accounts in the Southern States, and his\r\ndebtors were glad to pay him in this depreciated article. We have been\r\ninformed that Jackson's cotton defences of New-Orleans were of his\r\nproperty. As neutral ships were permitted to sail between the\r\nbelligerent ports, Mr. Whitney exported large quantities of cotton to\r\nEngland, and held the balance of his stock until the close of the war,\r\nwhen it advanced enormously. This advance, together with the proceeds of\r\nhis exports, at once made him a millionaire, and the capital thus\r\nacquired never lost a chance of increase. Giving up the details of\r\ntrade, Mr. Whitney bought large quantities of real estate, on which he\r\nerected warehouses and obtained a princely rental. In addition to this,\r\nhe dealt more largely in commercial paper than any other man in the city\r\nand perhaps in the Union. His habits of industry continued, and were a\r\ntheme of remark, as we observed him in his daily walk from his office to\r\nthe great moneyed centre of America, where the price of paper and money\r\nrates regaled his ears. He was a good judge of paper, and needed no one\r\nto advise him. He touched nothing but what in commercial parlance is\r\ntermed 'gilt-edged,' and of this he purchased almost daily for thirty\r\nyears. These notes being made payable to the order of the drawers,\r\nneeded no other indorsement, and hence might pass through an hundred\r\nhands without this fact becoming known. Mr. Whitney's bills receivable\r\nfalling due in Wall street must have been at the rate of thirty thousand\r\ndollars per day, and his purchases of paper, of course, were at about\r\nthe same rate. Much of this paper brought rates but little better than\r\ninterest, but on others from one to two per cent per month was obtained.\r\nThe secrets of this trade are deep and little understood, and few even\r\nof the best dealers knew that when their notes had been given for\r\ninvoices of merchandise, they passed almost directly into the hands of a\r\nfew bill-buyers, and that perhaps in Stephen Whitney's portfolio might\r\nbe found almost the whole amount of good paper made in Front or South\r\nstreets. Mr. Kimball's recent work, _Undercurrents_, throws much light\r\non this traffic, and exhibits the result of deep study of our mercantile\r\nsystem.[4] Mr. Whitney's management of his estate soon brought him up to\r\nan estimate of ten millions. I used not only to meet him daily at the\r\nmart, but also attended the same church, (Dr. Alexander's.) He was a\r\nregular attendant, and a close listener, and I used to marvel how he\r\ncould bear the plain truths that fell upon my ears. Here in the pulpit,\r\nat least, was one who was no money-worshiper. How well we remember the\r\nexclamation from that earnest preacher: 'Wealth! in comparison with this\r\nthing, (religion,) let it not be mentioned!' Whitney was a great admirer\r\nof plain preaching, though, we believe, he never got into the communion\r\nof the Church. Both the preacher and his millionaire listener are now\r\ndead, and the church has been pulled down, and the site is now covered\r\nby a block of splendid stores. Mr. Whitney's charities were on a very\r\nlimited scale. When the congregation above referred to were building a\r\nmission-house, he was applied to, to head the subscription, which he\r\ndid with a trifling sum. The gift was refused, and a larger one was\r\ndemanded, as in better keeping with his position. 'Sir,' was his reply,\r\n'if you go on this way, there will not be a rich man left in the city of\r\nNew-York.' It is also said that on a certain occasion, he was called on\r\nto aid a political movement with his subscription. 'Sir,' was his reply,\r\n'I have no money to spare, but I'll come and sit up all night to fold\r\nballots for you.'\r\n\r\nThe Lorrillard estate was chiefly acquired through an immense tobacco\r\nbusiness which the patriarch of that house started nearly a century ago,\r\nand which led to the purchase of large landed property. The original\r\nidentity of the name continues, and 'short cut' and 'ladies' twist' are\r\nstill sold under the sign and brand of the Lorrillards. We presume that\r\nit is the oldest house in America.\r\n\r\nThe Stuyvesant farm was a vast but unprofitable tract of marshes in the\r\neastern part of New-York, but now covered by serried blocks, and among\r\nthe most densely populated portions of the city. Forty years ago, these\r\nmarshes were favorite skating-fields in winter, and here a lad was at\r\nthat time actually drowned by the breaking of the ice. Being out of\r\ntown, the drier portions were converted into an American Tyburn, and\r\nhere the murderer Johnson was hanged. Such were the Stuyvesant meadows,\r\nwhose worthless wastes have been raised to immense value by the growth\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nAmong those of our city capitalists who are more identified with general\r\nbenevolence, the names of Stuart and Lenox are chief. Messrs. Stuart are\r\ntwo brothers, who are largely engaged in refining sugars, and who have\r\nin this business made large sums. The concern originated in a small\r\nshop, where, some fifty years ago, a Scotchwomen sold candy, with her\r\ntwo boys as clerks. Instead of that little candy-shop, there stands on\r\nthe same spot an enormous refinery, whose operations employ hundreds of\r\nhands, and whose purchases are by cargoes. What would the worthy mother\r\nsay to this transformation of her shop, as by some act of magic? But it\r\nis the magic of industry and enterprise. The Stuarts use their wealth\r\nwith judicious liberality, and evidently mean that the world shall be\r\nbetter for their living in it. Their contributions are large, and their\r\nopportunities are great, for be it remembered, such men are under\r\nincessant solicitation. Indeed, there are few things more fatal to one's\r\npeace than a reputation for liberality, which lays one open to a siege\r\nof begging faces and an inundation of begging letters, whose demands\r\nwould exhaust all resources. It is our opinion that, avoiding\r\nostentation on the one hand and importunity on the other, the Stuarts\r\ncontribute conscientiously to every worthy enterprise, in a proportion\r\ncorresponding to their profits.[5]\r\n\r\nThe name of Lenox appears among some of the early Scotch emigrants, such\r\nas the Irvings, Masons, Douglases, Grahams, etc. Robert Lenox became a\r\ndistinguished New-York merchant. His profits were wisely invested in\r\nland, and this became very valuable. His only son, James, inherited the\r\nlarger portion of this estate, whose increasing value made him a\r\nmillionaire, and in its use, he has exhibited a remarkable benevolence.\r\n\r\nWe say _exhibited_, for though acting with studied secresy and silence,\r\nhis life has been so full of good works, that they can not be hid. In\r\nthese benefactions, Mr. Lenox exercises close discrimination, and for\r\nthis purpose has for years refused personal applications. This measure,\r\nindeed, was necessary, in order to escape a perpetual siege, which would\r\nsoon have driven any man distracted. He has been in the habit of\r\nconsidering written applications, and of selecting such as seemed worthy\r\nof his patronage. Mr. Lenox annually disburses an enormous sum in a most\r\nuseful as well as most quiet manner. Indeed, his mansion is one of the\r\nbenevolent institutions of the day, and to all intents and purposes, its\r\noccupant is but an actuary driven by perpetual duties and working with\r\nassiduity to fulfil an important trust. He is a thoroughly practical\r\nman, posted on all the details of business, and, inheriting the peculiar\r\nabilities and energy of his father, puts them to the best of use.\r\n\r\nWe may say that the whole purpose of his life is benevolence to all\r\nclasses. Mr. Lenox will pardon us if we allude to his munificent gifts\r\ntoward educational enterprise, and especially to those which enrich the\r\ninstitutions of Princeton. He has long been a trustee of Nassau Hall, in\r\nwhose behalf he has expended large sums, and whose gallery is enriched\r\nwith his portrait. The Theological Seminary is also an object of his\r\naffectionate care. A few years ago, he observed that it needed increased\r\naccommodation for its growing library. Carrying out a scheme which had\r\nits inception in this circumstance, he quietly employed an architect to\r\ndraft plans, while at the same time a suitable range grounds was\r\nobtained, the materials hauled from New-York, and the present noble\r\nedifice, known as the Lenox Library, erected. That library has been of\r\nvast assistance to the institution, and not a student visits its\r\nalcoves, who does not gratefully remember its founder with a sentiment\r\nlike that uttered by Gray in reference to Eton:\r\n\r\n  'Where grateful science still adores\r\n  Her Henry's sacred shade.'\r\n\r\nWe understand that it has been recently decided to change this structure\r\ninto an oratory, and to build another library, and we presume that in\r\nthis also Mr. Lenox takes the initiative. We have referred to the fact\r\nthat Mr. Lenox only considers written applications, but lest this\r\nstatement should lead to their increase, we would add a word of\r\nexplanation. Their number has already become so large as to create a\r\ngreat burden, and the daily task of reading these his begging letters is\r\nvery annoying. Mr. Lenox is greatly overladen, and we advise any one who\r\nmay think of his name as a _dernier resort_, to refrain from adding to\r\nthe labors of an overworked philanthropist. Rest assured, dear reader,\r\nthat Mr. Lenox will do all possible good with his money, and if it fails\r\nto reach you, it may flow to a more deserving object.\r\n\r\nMr. Lenox is deeply interested in the Free Church of Scotland, and was\r\none of its most efficient helpers at the time of its exodus. A\r\ncorrespondence between him and De. Chalmers conveyed his benefactions\r\nthrough the noblest of instrumentalities, and a portrait of the great\r\nScottish theologian graces the mansion of his American friend. It was\r\npainted by Henry Inman, during his sojourn abroad, and is the finest\r\npicture of Chalmers we have ever seen. Mr. Lenox is a man of fine taste,\r\nand finds recreation in gathering rare books, of which he has a valuable\r\ncollection, and he possesses, in addition, a splendid gallery of\r\npictures. Among them are two of Turner's landscapes, and we know of no\r\nothers in America.[6] We might say more of this estimable man, but will\r\nnot too soon anticipate the voice of fame. Our statements are made\r\nmainly to correct some false impressions about one who, with all his\r\nreticence, is one of the public men of his day, and who fulfills the\r\nidea of the poet:\r\n\r\n  'Do good by stealth and blush to find it fame.'\r\n\r\nSuch a man was George Douglas, one of the same circle of wealthy\r\ncitizens of Scotch descent, who, though in a pecuniary view, hardly in\r\nthe same rank with Mr. Lenox, was still very rich. Mr. Douglas preserved\r\na studied retirement, and passed much of his time on his noble farm, but\r\nwas still active in philanthropy. His estate can not be far from a\r\nhalf-million, yet it was used humbly in the service of his race.\r\n\r\n  'Though nursed in greatness, and to riches born,\r\n  Yet in earth's fairest flower he saw the thorn.\r\n  Beneath the finest linen sackcloth felt,\r\n  And bound his purple with an iron belt;\r\n  Lived Heaven's trustee, and lent, and gave away,\r\n  To God's own heirs who never could repay;\r\n  And died a rare example to the great,\r\n  Of lowly virtue in a high estate.'\r\n\r\nBut among all American capitalists the name of Astor looms up in\r\nunapproachable solitude, and stands as it has stood for nearly forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWe may get the better idea of the Astor estate by a comparative view.\r\nThus, a man worth one hundred thousand dollars is a rich man; a man\r\nworth five hundred thousand dollars is a very rich man; a millionaire is\r\nstill more the ideal of wealth. Mr. Astor, then, is, if rightly\r\nestimated, equal to twenty-five millionaires, or two hundred and fifty\r\nrich men of the class first mentioned. In the seven hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants of New-York, there are not more than two hundred men worth\r\none hundred thousand dollars; not more than twenty-five of the second;\r\nnot more than ten of the last. Approaching the assessment-roll, we may\r\nestimate the Astor estate at one thirtieth of the entire city. Thus he\r\nstands one seven hundred thousandth in the proportion of population, and\r\none thirtieth in that of wealth; or in other words, he owns what would\r\nbe a fair proportion for twenty-five thousand of his fellow-citizens.\r\nThe commencement of this estate was, as is well known, by small\r\nbeginnings.\r\n\r\nAmong the emigrants who landed in New-York about the close of the French\r\nRevolution, was a rude German, from Baden Baden, whose life in the New\r\nWorld was commenced as a laborer. He afterward became a peddler of fancy\r\ngoods, and eventually a dealer in peltries. In 1791 there appeared at\r\nNumber 40 Little Dock street, the unpretending name of John Jacob Astor,\r\nand here the foundation of his estate was laid. Astor soon took fair\r\nrank among business men. He was prompt and snug in his dealing, honest\r\nand straightforward, and beside this, carried great weight of character\r\nin his countenance. No man could be much with him without being struck\r\nwith his depth of character, and the solidity of his views. At that time\r\nthe fur-trade was brisk along the Mohawk, and the peltries, after\r\npassing through the hands of frontier dealers, generally found their way\r\ninto Astor's warehouse, in Liberty street. Here they were sorted with\r\ngreat care by his own hands, and prepared for foreign markets. An\r\noctogenarian merchant informed me that, calling once at Mr. Astor's\r\nstore, he found him in an upper loft clad in a long, coarse wrapper, and\r\nengaged among his furs. 'I shall get for that,' said he, holding up the\r\nskin of a splendid silver fox, 'forty dollars, in St. Petersburg.' It\r\nprobably cost him less than five dollars. Astor had no sooner gained a\r\nposition as a thrifty trader, than he took a higher step by induction\r\ninto Free-Masonry. We say a higher step, not with a view of glorifying\r\nthis institution, but because at that time it was exceedingly popular\r\nand aristocratic, and gave tone to citizenship. Among the leading\r\nFree-Masons of New-York were Peter Irving and his brother William,\r\nMartin Hoffman, the founder of the great auction business, and father of\r\nthe late L. M. Hoffman. Moving among these magnates, John Jacob Astor\r\nbecame Grand Treasurer. Mr. Astor had a brother of the same thrifty\r\nturn, though not so successful in acquiring wealth. He was a butcher by\r\ntrade, and slaughtered himself into a pittance of one hundred thousand\r\ndollars, which, as he died early, he bequeathed to William B., his\r\nnephew. 'To him that hath shall be given.' Mr. Astor's oldest son is\r\nsaid to have been a very promising lad, but his brain became injured by\r\na fall, and he soon fell into a state of derangement. A private asylum\r\nwas arranged for his use years ago, and this, with its grounds, covers\r\nan entire block in the western part of the city.\r\n\r\nMr. Astor's profits rolled in upon him at a rate which no one could have\r\ndreamed of, and he kept their amount a secret until he had so penetrated\r\nthe frontier by his agencies that he controlled the whole trade, when he\r\noccasionally acknowledged a degree of wealth which astonished those who\r\nheard. For instance, we may state this fact in illustration: He had\r\noccasion at a certain time to use a large amount of cash, and what was\r\nvery rare with him, applied to his bank for a heavy discount. The\r\nunusual circumstance and the sum demanded startled the cashier, who in a\r\nplain, business way, put the question: 'Mr. Astor, how much do you\r\nconsider yourself worth?' '_Not less than a million_,' was the reply. _A\r\nmillion_! the cashier was overwhelmed. He supposed that he knew all his\r\ncustomers, and had rated Astor at hardly more than one tenth of that\r\nsum.\r\n\r\nMr. Astor commenced at an early day to buy real estate, and the habit\r\ngrew upon him until it became a passion. He was for years a leading\r\ncharacter at sheriff and other land sales, and it was the commonest\r\nthing at such places to hear the closing words of the auctioneer: 'Last\r\ncall--going, going--gone--to John Jacob Astor.' At that time many large\r\nestates were broken up, and among others, that of Aaron Burr was put\r\ninto the market, and speedily became the property of Mr. Astor. It\r\nembraced a small suburban principality, whose mansion, 'Richmond Hill,'\r\nwas Burr's country-seat. The whole property is now in the heart of the\r\ncity and is worth millions, where once it brought thousands. Mr. Astor\r\nboldly bought those wild lands, including swamps, rocky knolls, and\r\nbarren commons, which lay at waste from Canal street onward to\r\nBloomingdale, and while others affected to laugh at his judgment, the\r\ncorrectness of that judgment is now quite apparent. A case similar in\r\ncharacter is that of the late eccentric Jonathan Hunt. This man, who had\r\naccumulated a vast fortune South, was quite noted, a few years ago, for\r\nhis dashing land purchases in New-York, and his relatives actually\r\nserved on him a warrant _de lunatico inquirendo_, with a view of\r\npreventing him from wasting his estate. Subsequently, however, it turned\r\nout that these incessant purchases which had made him a leading man at\r\nthe Merchants' Exchange, and an object of distrust to his family, were\r\nsplendid operations. Poor Hunt's bid was subsequently refused by the\r\nauctioneers, on the score of insanity, while the lots he bought on\r\nMadison avenue and elsewhere, were, in fact, as speculations, superior\r\nto the operations of the most sagacious speculators.\r\n\r\nAstor's boldness increased with years. He bought government loans at a\r\ntime when other capitalists shrunk, and the price had run down to the\r\nlowest mark. He bought claims against old estates--one of which paid an\r\nenormous profit, and would have been accounted a splendid fortune of\r\nitself--while the gradual increase of the city brought his waste lands\r\ninto demand; and the opening of the Erie Canal may be said to have at\r\none stroke added a million of dollars to the value of his estate.\r\nWhatever was bought was held with determined grasp, however small the\r\nprospect of advance. For instance, a friend of ours (now dead)\r\npurchased, in company with Mr. Astor, two lots on Broadway, of which\r\nthey took separate deeds, and held for an advance. Year after year\r\npassed by, but no advance appeared, while assessments were continually\r\nmade for city improvement. At the end of this period our friend called\r\non Mr. Astor and stated that he was weary of such long delay in getting\r\nreturn for his investment, and asked him if he would not take the lot\r\nand give him its simple cost. Mr. Astor calmly acceded to the proposal.\r\nHad our friend held the same views as the great land operator, he would\r\nhave realized a fortune from this single lot, since what then cost one\r\nthousand dollars is now worth fifty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Napoleonic character of Mr. Astor's mind is shown by the great\r\ncommercial schemes which shared the claims of real estate. He was\r\nextending the ramifications of his trade through the North-west\r\nwilderness and competing with the Hudson Bay Company for the peltry\r\ntaken by the numerous tribes of savages, while at the same time a vast\r\nexport trade was carried on with Europe, and also with China, whence he\r\nbrought teas in exchange for furs. It was this broad ambition which\r\nprompted the grand scheme of a new station at the mouth of the Columbia.\r\nAnd this scheme, though it failed, was not without great national\r\nresults. Its misfortunes were chronicled by the pen of Irving, and in\r\nhis pages the story of the crew murdered, and the ship plundered and\r\nburned, was recorded among the tragedies of commerce.\r\n\r\nMr. Astor lived to old age, and his life was one of few changes. From\r\nhis humble shop in Little Dock street (now Water street near Coenties\r\nSlip) he removed his place of business to Liberty street, (Number 71,)\r\nand subsequently to Broadway. His longest place of abode was Number 223\r\nBroadway, now a part of the site of the Astor House, whence, after a\r\nresidence in Hoboken, he removed up-town to a block in Broadway near\r\nPrince street. Here he remained until death, but he lived long enough to\r\nsee the progress of the city covering his lands with dwellings, and\r\nbequeathed to his son the largest estate in America. Mr. Astor had a\r\nliterary taste, and was fond of book-men. He gave Fitz-Green Halleck a\r\nsnug and profitable clerkship, and on the death of the capitalist,\r\nWilliam B. Astor presented to the poet the sum of ten thousand dollars.\r\nMr. Astor also sought the acquaintance of Washington Irving on the\r\nreturn of that distinguished gentleman from Europe, and it was at his\r\nespecial request that the _Astoria_ was written. The friendship between\r\nthese two distinguished men continued until death, when it was found\r\nthat Mr. Irving had been appointed one of the executors of the will. The\r\nfees connected with this office could not have been less than one\r\nhundred thousand dollars, and the executors (six in number) at one time\r\nreceived ten thousand dollars apiece.\r\n\r\nMr. Astor's project of the library was conceived long before his death,\r\nand he had Dr. Cogswell for several years engaged in the collection of\r\nbooks for this purpose. The full provisions, however, were not known\r\nuntil the reading of the will developed the plan and funds. The plan was\r\nnot carried out in detail, but was left to the judgment of the trustees,\r\nwho modified it considerably, making an institution for reference\r\ninstead of a mere circulating library.\r\n\r\nTo the original bequest Mr. William B. Astor has since added a large\r\nconveyance of real estate, and the institution is nearly double its\r\noriginal size. Speaking of Mr. William B. Astor, we may be led to a few\r\nreferences of a personal nature. As the ordinary street-passenger is\r\ntraversing Prince street, he is not likely to be struck by any of its\r\nsurroundings. The street itself is but of third-rate character, and the\r\nhouses are but of a common stamp. Near Broadway, however, one may notice\r\na small brick office, neatly built, of one story, with gable to the\r\nstreet, but with doors and windows closed, and the whole appearance one\r\nof security. Near the door may be seen a little sign which reads thus:\r\n'Entrance next door: office hours from nine to three.' The next door, to\r\nwhich we are referred, is a plain three-story brick dwelling, with no\r\nname on the door, and might be taken for the residence of some\r\nwell-to-do old-fashioned family. Hence one is quite startled to find\r\nthat this is the headquarters of the chief capitalist of America.\r\nEntering the street-door, one will find himself in a small vestibule,\r\nneatly floored with checkered oil-cloth, and opening a door on his left,\r\nhe will enter a well-lighted front-room, destitute of any furniture but\r\na counting-house desk and a few chairs. At this desk stands an\r\naccountant (or perhaps two) working at a set of books, and evidently\r\nenjoying an easy berth. He will answer all ordinary inquiries, will do\r\nthe duty of refusing charitable demands, and will attend to any thing in\r\nthe ordinary run of business; but if one has any thing special on hand,\r\nhe will point to a door opening into a rear office. This apartment is of\r\nmoderate size and of simple furniture. On the table are a few books, and\r\non opening one of them, which appears well thumbed, it will be found to\r\ncontain maps of plots of city property, carefully and elegantly\r\nexecuted, and embracing the boundaries of an enormous estate. Seated by\r\nthe table may generally be seen a stout-built man with large and\r\nunattractive features, and upon the whole an ordinary face. He is\r\nplainly dressed, and has a somewhat care-worn look, and appears to be\r\nfifty or sixty years of age. One naturally feels (that is, if he be a\r\npoor man) that it is quite a rare thing to address a capitalist, and\r\nespecially when that capitalist is the representative, say of\r\ntwenty-five millions of dollars. Such, at least, was our experience at\r\nour first interview with William B. Astor.\r\n\r\nMr. Astor occupies an imposing mansion in Lafayette Place, and\r\nimmediately adjoining is the magnificent library to which we have\r\nreferred, and which should commemorate the name of the son as well as\r\nthat of the father. At this house he spends that small portion of his\r\ntime which is not occupied by his duties in Prince street, where he does\r\na full day's work (Sundays excepted) every day in the week. Thus the\r\ndaily routine of the richest man in America is a walk to and from home,\r\nof a half-mile or so, and close attention to business.\r\n\r\nThe care of Mr. Astor's estate is a vast burden. His tenements of all\r\ngrades number several hundreds, ranging from the dwelling at three\r\nhundred dollars per annum to the magnificent warehouse or hotel at\r\nthirty thousand dollars. To relieve himself from the more vexatious\r\nfeatures of his business, he has committed his real estate collections\r\nto an agent who does the work well, and who is, no doubt, largely paid.\r\nHe, with his clerks, collects rents, and makes returns of a rent-roll,\r\nwhose very recital would be wearisome. As a matter of course, such a man\r\nmust employ a small army of painters, carpenters, and other mechanics,\r\nin order to keep up suitable repairs. As Mr. Astor pays no insurance,\r\nthe work of rebuilding after fires is in itself a large item.\r\n\r\nA large part of Mr. Astor's property consists of vacant lots, which are\r\nin continual demand, and which he generally prefers to hold rather than\r\nsell; hence he is much employed with architects and master-builders, and\r\nalways has several blocks in course of erection. This is a very heavy\r\nburden, and were it not for the help derived from his family, would, we\r\nbelieve, crush him. However, his son, John Jacob, is quite a business\r\nman, and bears his share of the load. This young gentleman has shown his\r\npatriotism by serving in the army for the Union, in which he bears an\r\nimportant commission. In addition to this, Mr. Astor has the aid of a\r\ngentleman of business character and habits, once a member of one of the\r\nlargest shipping houses in the city, who has become connected with the\r\nfamily by marriage. The labors of all these parties would not be more\r\nthan adequate to the task of collecting interest on bonds, looking after\r\ndividends, etc., since that little fire-proof office in Prince street\r\ncontains several millions of Government and State securities.\r\n\r\nIn order to give something like an estimate of the immense income\r\nrolling in upon this family, we must commence with the fact that two\r\ndollars per day is considered fair wages for working men; that the man\r\nwho makes five dollars per day all the year round may be considered very\r\nfortunate; that ten dollars per day is attained by that few who are more\r\nfavored and gifted, and whose proportion to the mass is about one to a\r\nthousand. Starting from this estimate, we may be better prepared to rate\r\nMr. Astor's position by comparing any of the above sums with six\r\nthousand dollars, which is said to be his daily income. Bless me! one\r\ncan not but exclaim; here Croesus himself might die with envy. Yet we\r\nreply, after a moment's pause, let no one envy the man of gold. It is\r\nsaid that when John Jacob Astor was once congratulated by a certain\r\nperson for his wealth, he replied by pointing to his pile of bonds, and\r\nmaps of property, at the same time inquiring: 'Would you like to manage\r\nthese matters for your board and clothes?' The man demurred to the idea.\r\n'Sir,' continued the rich man, '_it is all that I get_!' Hence, thinking\r\non these things, we have never envied Mr. Astor, and would not bear the\r\nburden of his wealth for all its glory. It is not the possession but the\r\nuse of money, which affords enjoyment, and this is a secret which the\r\nrich seldom learn. Alas! among the annals of moneyed men, how seldom do\r\nwe meet a Stuart or a Lenox--men who have learned what Goldsmith calls\r\n'the luxury of doing good.'\r\n\r\nIt is one of the peculiar misfortunes of the rich, to be subject to the\r\nattentions of parasites and flatterers, and hence they can not possess\r\nthat same certainty of the value of friendship enjoyed by the poor. The\r\nlatter of these classes know that when a kind act is done to them, it\r\ncomes from a pure motive; the other seldom can be sure that it is not\r\nfrom selfish ends. To illustrate the idea which wealth suggests, as to\r\nthe motive of friendly visitors, we may state that among Mr. Astor's\r\nclass-mates in Columbia College was a young man who became a preacher.\r\nThe students separated--the one to handle millions, and to touch the\r\nsprings of the money-market, and become the colossus of wealth; the\r\nother to his flock, as a poor domestic missionary, whose history was\r\nindeed a 'shady side.' The latter struggled on through thick and thin,\r\nand never in all his privations thought of sending a begging-letter to\r\nhis old class-mate. But being once upon a time in New-York, he yielded\r\nto the inclination to make him a visit. Mr. Astor received him\r\ncourteously, and the two conversed on the scenes of their early days. As\r\nthe pastor arose to depart, an idea struck the capitalist's heart, which\r\nwe mention to his credit. '_Can I do any thing for you_?' he inquired.\r\nHe had, in fact, misconceived the object of the visit, and supposed that\r\nunder the guise of a friendly call, lurked an inclination to beg, which\r\nfear of refusal had suppressed. The poor clergyman at once perceived the\r\ndrift of the question. Nothing could have been farther from his mind,\r\nand blushing at the thought, he acknowledged the suggestion with an\r\nexpression of gratitude, and retired.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a view of the unrest of the human heart appears most terrible\r\nwhen contrasted with the almost fabulous heaps of surrounding wealth,\r\nand one is thus led to the conclusion arrived at by Goldsmith:\r\n\r\n  'Vain, very vain, my weary search to find\r\n  That bliss which only centres in the mind;\r\n  With secret course which no loud streams annoy,\r\n  Glides the smooth current of domestic joy;\r\n  Still to ourselves in every place consigned,\r\n  Our own felicity we make or find.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Undercurrents_ is not a romance, and although its author\r\ncalls it a 'Romance of business,' it is a life-like presentation of the\r\ndeep things of trade, a series of dramatic scenes, holding the mirror up\r\nto a terrible reality.

Rarely are the 'selectmen' called to act either\r\non applications for admission as one of the 'town's poor,' or to 'bind\r\nout' a boy or girl till one-and-twenty.\r\n\r\nOne evening--it was the close of a cold, raw day in the latter part of\r\nNovember--the stage deposited a woman, and a lad perhaps twelve years\r\nold, at the village tavern in Sudbury. She was intending to ride all\r\nnight; indeed, she had paid her 'fare' through to New-Haven, but, seized\r\nwith sudden illness, she was compelled to stop. Her malady proved to be\r\ntyphus fever. The doctor was summoned, who subjected his patient to the\r\nterrific treatment then in vogue for that disorder, and in due course\r\nshe died. It turned out on inquiry, that the woman, whose name was\r\nBurns, was on her way to a married sister's in Pennsylvania; further,\r\nthat she was a widow, the lad her only child, and the sister in\r\nPennsylvania the only near relation she had in the world. This sister\r\nwas by no means in affluent circumstances, but she could offer a home to\r\n'Sarah,' which the latter was glad to accept. After disposing of the\r\ntrifling articles unsuitable to carry with her, she had barely money\r\nenough to defray the expenses of herself and 'Joel' to their new abode.\r\nThe poor woman's journey was interrupted, as we have explained, at\r\nSudbury, and a new direction given to it. She departed for 'the\r\nundiscovered country,' leaving little Joel to cry himself asleep; for\r\nthe time quite heart-broken, and desolate enough.\r\n\r\nThere was not time to write to the married sister; so the selectmen,\r\nafter ascertaining what money still remained in the purse of the\r\ndeceased, undertook the burial. They ordered a cheap pine coffin,\r\nscantily 'stained.' It cost but a quarter of a dollar to dig the grave,\r\nand old Sally agreed to 'lay the woman out' for the comfortable dress\r\nshe wore on arriving at the inn. Of the three selectmen of Sudbury, two\r\nwere from the east part of the town--thrifty, hard-working farmers; the\r\nthird was a Mr. Bellows, a popular store-keeper of the village. The\r\nlatter had not interfered with the action of his colleagues, because he\r\nhimself was very busy, and they, having very little to do at that\r\nseason, were pleased with the excitement the affair afforded them. But\r\npassing the inn the morning Mrs. Burns was to be buried, Mr. Bellows\r\nstepped in a moment at the request of the landlord, who was a\r\nkind-hearted fellow, and did not feel quite satisfied with the\r\narrangements. Ascending to the chamber, he saw a sad but\r\nhandsome-looking boy standing over a rudely constructed coffin, a\r\npicture of sorrow and despair. The little fellow had witnessed the\r\naction of the coarse-hearted men who took the direction of the funeral.\r\nHe heard their private discussion as to the 'cost of burying the woman.'\r\nHe was a witness to their haggling with Aunt Sally about laying her out.\r\nHe could hear various propositions as to what was to be done with _him_.\r\nHe saw his mother hurriedly draped for the coffin and placed inside of\r\nit. He did not sob nor cry; a dreadful reality had so overcome him, that\r\nhe lost the power of doing either. Once or twice, when every body had\r\nleft the room, he had stolen softly up and kissed the face of the\r\ncorpse, and some tears would then roll down his cheeks. It was at such a\r\ntime that Mr. Bellows entered, and his heart smote him that he had not\r\nsooner looked in. He spoke kindly to Joel, which seemed to loose the\r\nflood-gates of his grief, and for a time he continued to cry in the most\r\npiteous manner. Mr. Bellows soon decided what to do. His own family was\r\nsmall; he had a wife and one child--a little girl nine years old. He\r\ntook Joel in his lap, told him not to cry--that he should go home with\r\nhim, and be _his_ boy. The tone in which this was uttered had more\r\neffect to soothe the lad than what was said to him. After a few minutes,\r\nJoel was persuaded to leave the room and to accompany his new friend to\r\nthe house. Mr. Bellows then called on his minister, and requested him to\r\nperform the funeral rites at the grave; for so little interest had been\r\nshown in the fate of the strange woman, that her illness had not even\r\nbeen communicated to the clergyman, and the selectmen did not think it\r\n'worth while to have any funeral'! Mr. Bellows hurried hack to the inn.\r\nThe coffin was placed in a wagon. It was followed by the clergyman and\r\nMr. Bellows, the two other selectmen, the landlord of the inn, and his\r\nwife. The burying-ground was soon reached, a short prayer made, and the\r\ncompany dispersed, leaving the man to fill up the grave according to\r\ncontract. Mr. Bellows and his two associates returned to the tavern\r\ntogether, in order, as the latter expressed it, to settle up the\r\nbusiness. Going into the sitting-room, and taking seats around a small\r\ntable, one of them opened the subject in a serious and important tone,\r\nindicative of the weight of responsibility he felt was resting on his\r\nshoulders, by asking what was to be done with the boy.\r\n\r\n'What do you think best to do with him?' said Mr. Bellows.\r\n\r\n'Well, I suppose there is room in the town-house. There is nobody there\r\nnow but Aunt Lois and foolish Tom, and we can probably bind him out next\r\nspring.'\r\n\r\n'I don't think we have a right to charge the town with the expense,'\r\nsaid selectman number two. 'We know where the boy came from; the best\r\nway is to send him back to Granby.'\r\n\r\n'He has got an aunt,' said the other; 'hadn't we better write to her?'\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen,' said Mr. Bellows, 'I will cut this matter short. I will\r\ntake the lad myself. You shall bind him out to me in the regular way. I\r\ndo not think you need fear any interference from the town of Granby. As\r\nto his aunt, I propose first to write and get her consent. If she\r\nprefers to take the boy, why, she will send for him.'\r\n\r\nThis question disposed of, the spokesman next proposed to go into the\r\naccounts; which meant his own and his neighbor's charge for time and\r\npersonal expenses twice from East-Sudbury with horse and wagon. They\r\nthought six dollars about right.\r\n\r\n'How do you propose to be paid?' quoth Mr. Bellows.\r\n\r\n'Twenty dollars and seventy-two cents was in their possession, taken\r\nfrom the pocket of the woman after she died.'\r\n\r\n'And how did you dare interfere with property of any kind,' exclaimed\r\nMr. Bellows, his smothered indignation bursting forth, 'without\r\nconsulting with me? Don't you know the landlord has the first claim on\r\nevery thing till his bill is paid? Don't you know, too, you are simply\r\ndoing the town business, and if you have any claim, the town must pay\r\nyou for it?'\r\n\r\nWell, that is so, I guess,' said the third. 'It _is_ agin the town. I'll\r\ntake my chances, for one--had rather settle it that way, any how.'\r\n\r\nThe result of the conference was, that the whole business, including the\r\ntwenty dollars and seventy-two cents, was handed over to Mr. Bellows,\r\nleaving his colleagues to make out and collect their bill at leisure.\r\nJoel's aunt was written to, and freely gave her consent that the boy\r\nshould go with his new friend. The latter promptly paid the bill at the\r\ninn, and the doctor for his services, and soon after paid his colleagues\r\nwhat they claimed, lest it might in the future be a subject of comment\r\nwhen Joel grew up.\r\n\r\nHe was a good man, this Mr. Bellows; not specially refined in manner,\r\nbut possessing a delicacy of character and a lively sensibility which\r\nplaced him among the ranks of nature's noblemen. He had been fortunate\r\nin business, and owned the principal store in the place, where he\r\nexercised a decided influence.\r\n\r\nLittle Joel gave promise of not disappointing his patron's expectations.\r\nIn fact, he was a child of most engaging manners. His features were not\r\nregular, nor indeed handsome; but he had bright black eyes, a fine\r\ncomplexion, and an open, ingenuous countenance. He was treated by Mr.\r\nBellows as considerately as if he were his own son. To be sure, Joel had\r\nsome unpleasant scenes to pass through. As nothing is ever lost sight of\r\nin a small country village, the story of how he came to be living with\r\nMr. Bellows was not forgotten. At school, occasionally, one of the boys\r\nwould, on some slight provocation, point at him and call him 'Bellows's\r\nnigger,' or make faces and cry 'charity boy,' 'town's poor.' Now,\r\nfortunately, Joel had a happy, joyous nature--somewhat fiery and\r\nirascible, but still joyous--else he might have become morbidly\r\nmiserable. As it was, these manifestations only provoked his anger, and\r\nled him forthwith into a rough-and-tumble fight, in which, whether\r\nvictor or not, he always showed unquestionable pluck. If he came off\r\nsecond-best a dozen times, he went confidently into the thirteenth\r\ntrial, brave as Bruce, and equally successful. At length the voice of\r\ngossip was hushed. Joel became the most popular lad in the village.\r\nEvery body liked him, and what is better, he deserved it.\r\n\r\nBut the evil days came at last to good Mr. Bellows--came after years of\r\nhappy, moderate, unclouded prosperity. First his wife died. This was\r\nwhen Joel was twenty years old, and Ellen Bellows seventeen. The illness\r\nwas short, and the daughter was summoned from boarding-school in time\r\nonly to attend her mother's funeral. Mr. Bellows, after that, as every\r\nbody said, was an altered man. He could not bring his mind to business.\r\nSome people thought at times he acted strangely, by which they meant he\r\nwas a little out of his head. Still, his affairs could not suffer while\r\nsuch a young man as Joel Burns was about. The fact is, in some things\r\nmatters were even better managed than before. But great mistakes were\r\nmade in the purchase of goods, which Mr. Bellows continued to attend to,\r\nand which Joel had too much respect for his benefactor to criticise. The\r\nsucceeding year, speculation in wool ran high. Mr. Bellows was anxious\r\nto go into it. Joel took the freedom of begging him not to do so. The\r\nlatter appeared to be persuaded; but he did what was worse than engaging\r\nactively in purchases, for then he would have had Joel's tact and energy\r\nto aid him. He lent his name to an acquaintance, for a very large\r\namount, who was to go extensively into the scheme with him and divide\r\nthe profits. The result was disastrous. Wool fell rapidly. An attempt\r\nwas made to borrow money on it and hold it over to the next\r\nseason--worse and worse; Mr. Bellows was ruined.\r\n\r\nOne morning, very early, several attachments were levied on his goods,\r\nand the store was shut up. One of the officers next proceeded to the\r\nhouse and took possession there, so that Mr. Bellows was now tied hand\r\nand foot.\r\n\r\nI suppose few of my readers can appreciate what it is for a man to 'fail\r\nup' in the country. In our large cities, it is regarded, to be sure, as\r\na misfortune, but one to which every merchant is exposed; and the usual\r\ncourse is to propose a compromise, obtain a release, and set cheerfully\r\nto work again, with loss of property, doubtless, but _not_ with any\r\ndamage to reputation. But in the country, failure is regarded as a\r\ndisgrace, and a 'failed man' is looked and pointed at something as a\r\nfelon would be.\r\n\r\nWhen Joel Burns awoke in the morning and found every thing in the hands\r\nof the sheriff, he was astounded, for Mr. Bellows had not told him a\r\nword about his last year's operations. He perceived the amounts were\r\nlarger than could ever be realized. He took in the whole situation at a\r\nglance. He hastened to consult with Mr. Bellows, but he was listened to\r\nwith entire apathy. The merchant would say but little, and that was so\r\nincoherent and unintelligible, it was evident he was laboring under\r\nmental aberration. He continued moody through the day, and the next\r\nmorning was found dead in his bed. He had severed an artery.\r\n\r\nAt this time Joel was in his twenty-second year. Already displaying\r\nextraordinary capacity in affairs, this event served to call out all his\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nI ought to have mentioned, before this, what every body will guess, that\r\nJoel was desperately in love with Ellen Bellows, without, however,\r\ngiving her the least reason to believe so, beyond that silent,\r\nunobtrusive devotion which girls, after all, are not very apt to\r\nmistake. Joel felt that in his situation he had no right to attempt to\r\nwin Ellen's affection; but he unconsciously took the very best way to\r\nwin it. In his intercourse with her he was reserved, almost formal, and,\r\nI may say, apparently indifferent. Ellen, when she came home from school\r\nto spend her vacations, used to feel a good deal piqued that Joel was\r\nnot more demonstrative in his welcome. I can not believe she did not\r\ncomprehend pretty well how Joel really felt; but his manner annoyed her,\r\nnevertheless. For example, he would frequently step aside and permit\r\nanother to wait on Miss Bellows, when Miss Bellows would much prefer\r\nJoel had not been so accommodating. In fact, she was vexed with him half\r\nthe time for what she called his stupidity, and half the time tantalized\r\nby his 'studious reserve.' Meanwhile, Joel pursued his career of\r\nself-martyrdom, honest and true-hearted.\r\n\r\nNow the scene had changed, and Joel was no longer the diffident youth,\r\nbut a man, competent and energetic. He took the direction of every\r\nthing; nothing was overlooked. Of course the relatives were sent for. It\r\nwas the old story: they had paid great respect to their rich cousin, but\r\nthey did not seem to care much for the memory of the broken-down\r\ninsolvent.\r\n\r\nThe day of the funeral arrived--a dreary November day. It was just\r\neleven years from the day Joel's mother was buried and he himself taken\r\nto the house of Mr. Bellows. Joel did not forget it, and it gave\r\nadditional strength to carry out what devolved on him. There was a very\r\nlarge attendance at the house. The circumstances of the failure and\r\nsubsequent suicide, the situation of the only daughter, and the many\r\npetty incidents which were now the town talk, excited the curiosity of\r\nthe good people, and there was an opportunity to gratify it by attending\r\nthe funeral. They wanted to see how the corpse would look. They were\r\ncrazy to know how Ellen Bellows would appear, and what Joel Burns would\r\ndo. So the house was thronged. After all, there was not much to satisfy\r\ntheir curiosity. The corpse was not exposed; Ellen Bellows, contrary to\r\nall custom in New-England, remained in her chamber, for which, as you\r\nmay believe, she was pretty thoroughly picked to pieces; and Joel Burns\r\nsat quietly, with sad but tranquil countenance, among the mourners.\r\n\r\nThe next day Joel called Ellen aside and asked her whether she was not\r\ngoing home with her aunt.\r\n\r\n'Am I not to stay here?' she said.\r\n\r\nJoel could not explain to her just then the absolute ruin which stared\r\nher in the face. He simply answered: 'No, Ellen, you must go away for a\r\nfew weeks. There is much to do, and for a time you had better be\r\nabsent.'\r\n\r\n'Very well, Joel, if you advise it. I have nobody else to advise me,'\r\nand she burst into tears.\r\n\r\nJoel remained calm. He had previously made up his mind just what to do,\r\nand he brought all the energy of his nature to sustain him. His composed\r\nair helped to restore Ellen--she tried to be as calm as he.\r\n\r\n'But aunt, since she came, has not invited me return with her,' she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n'Oh! but she will, I am sure,' replied Joel, and he went out rather\r\nabruptly; for here was an obstacle to his plan which did not occur to\r\nhim before. He proceeded at once to the aunt, and found her preparing to\r\nleave that afternoon.\r\n\r\n'You will take Ellen with you, I suppose?' he said.\r\n\r\n'I am sure I had not thought of doing it. You know all the children are\r\nhome, and really we have no room at present.'\r\n\r\nTwo weeks previous she had written a pressing invitation to Ellen to\r\ncome at this particular time. Joel bluntly reminded her of it.\r\n\r\n'Yes, but circumstances alter cases. The fact is, I can't afford to\r\nmaintain the girl, and I don't think I had better begin; and that's the\r\nEnglish of it, Joel, if you force me to say so. You know very well there\r\nwon't be a cent left.'\r\n\r\n'I think I know more about that than you do,' replied Joel, with an air\r\nwhich would have done credit to a _diplomat_, 'and, I assure you, Ellen\r\nwill _not_ be left penniless; and if you will insist on her going with\r\nyou for a short time--mind, I say _insist_--I promise before long to\r\nmake certain disclosures which will satisfy you as to my assertion. But\r\nshe must not be here while they are settling up. You understand.'\r\n\r\nThe old lady did not understand, but Joel carried his point by the aid\r\nof the mystery with which he surrounded it. It put her on her good\r\nbehavior at once, lest she should lose the promised revelation. She\r\nspoke even affectionately to Ellen, and declared she should not let her\r\nremain in the house alone, but she must go home with her.\r\n\r\nBefore the two left Sudbury, Joel had a very long interview with Ellen.\r\nWhat passed at that interview never transpired, but the young girl's\r\ncountenance, though very sad, did not wear the desolate and despairing\r\nexpression which it exhibited before.\r\n\r\nThe stage now drew up, the ladies got in, and it rolled away, leaving\r\nJoel and the deputy-sheriffs the sole possessors of the premises.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nA few miles to the north-east of Sudbury the country, at the time I\r\nspeak of it, had a wild and forbidding appearance. This was partly owing\r\nto the immense forest which stretched along a continuous ridge of land\r\ncovering both sides of it and the plain below. On one side of this ridge\r\nthe face of the country was very rough; on the other side, through a\r\nfine intervale, flowed a stream of respectable size called Pine Creek,\r\nwhich took its rise in the mountains at some distance, and was fed by\r\ninnumerable springs and rivulets from the surrounding hills. Nearly a\r\nthousand acres of these lands were owned by an old merchant in New-York,\r\nwho had taken them for debt many years before, and had become, as he\r\nsaid, tired of paying taxes on them.\r\n\r\nJoel had had his eye on the property for two or three years. What his\r\nviews were, we shall presently see, for no sooner did Miss Bellows quit\r\nSudbury with her aunt, than Joel, after remarking to the sheriff that he\r\ndid not propose to interfere with him in any way, proceeded to pack his\r\ntrunks, which he removed to the inn. Then he hired a horse and wagon for\r\na week, and set off no one knew whither. He came back within the time\r\nlimited, and found a committee of creditors awaiting his return. They\r\nwanted to engage him to sell out the stock of goods and to close up Mr.\r\nBellows' affairs. Joel declined the service, although the offers were\r\nliberal and coupled with the intimation that it would be the means of\r\nstarting him in business as the successor of Mr. Bellows. Joel\r\nresolutely declined. He knew the estate was hopelessly insolvent, and\r\nthat he could not be of the least service to Ellen by any labors he\r\nshould undertake; and besides, he did not care to even appear to thrive\r\nout of the broken fortunes of his patron. When still pressed by the now\r\nperplexed creditors, he turned sharply on them and said: 'Gentlemen,\r\ndon't you think it would have been more judicious, not to say more\r\nhumane, had you waited on Mr. Bellows in his lifetime, and requested\r\n_him_ to undertake this service instead of pouncing on his property,\r\nclosing his store, and hurrying him into his grave? He was an honest\r\nman, and would have worked honestly for your benefit, and I would have\r\naided him. As it is, I do not feel disposed to lift a finger for you.\r\nGood morning.'\r\n\r\nJoel left the same day for New-York, and did not again return to\r\nSudbury. Some weeks afterward, in mid-winter, the report was circulated\r\nthat he was living in the woods on Pine Creek. Then the story went\r\nabroad that the poor fellow was crazy and had turned hermit. This was\r\nfollowed by other rumors still more ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to alarm the reader on Joel's account. It is time,\r\ntherefore, I should say that he had formed extensive plans for the\r\nfuture, which he was proceeding to carry out. During his week's absence\r\nhe went carefully over the entire tract owned by the old merchant in\r\nNew-York. This lay on both sides of the creek, and extended to the\r\neastward quite over the 'ridge.' It was well timbered and beautifully\r\nsituated. After making these observations, Joel proceeded to New-York\r\nand called on the proprietor. He stated his object to be to purchase a\r\nhundred acres of the tract, for which he would pay five dollars an acre\r\ncash. He wanted, besides, the refusal of the rest of the property, for a\r\ncertain time, at the same rate. The old merchant was pleased with Joel's\r\ningenuous manner as well as with his intelligence. He questioned him\r\nminutely about the lands, for he had never seen them, and asked him what\r\nhe proposed to do with his purchase. Joel answered promptly and\r\ntruthfully. He put the owner in possession of every material fact.\r\n\r\n'And all you will give is five dollars per acre?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think that is all the lands are really worth?'\r\n\r\n'I hope to make them worth much more to me, else I would not seek to\r\nbuy,' responded Joel. 'What they are worth to you, is for you to judge\r\nafter what I have said about them.'\r\n\r\nThereupon the old gentleman told Joel he would do better by him than he\r\nasked. He would sell him the whole, receive the five hundred dollars,\r\nand take back a mortgage for the balance. Joel would not accept this\r\nproposition. He wanted one hundred acres, and he wanted to pay for them,\r\nand the money was ready at five dollars the acre, and he desired the\r\nrefusal of the balance at the same rate. The bargain was closed in this\r\nway, and Joel went on to his own property rejoicing. The plot selected\r\nby him was from that portion nearest to the road, which here was about a\r\nmile distant, and at a point of the stream most favorable for the\r\nerection of a _saw-mill_. This hundred acres Joel had had carefully\r\nsurveyed before he went to New-York. It embraced a portion of the\r\n'ridge,' with a front on the stream. The old village was miserably\r\nsituated, on the ancient principle of putting it in the centre of the\r\ntownship, and a new road had been talked of for some time, which would\r\nshorten the communication between two important points, and leave it to\r\none side. This was also known to Joel, and it led him to greater energy\r\nin trying to secure the property. But he did not omit to mention this\r\ncircumstance in his interview with the proprietor, though, if the truth\r\nbe told, he was tempted to keep silent. Joel Burns had a fine moral\r\nsense, to violate which, gave him pain. Without going through any\r\nargument on the subject, he _felt_ that it would amount to a deception\r\nif he withheld the information.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Mr. Bellows' death Joel was worth about twelve hundred\r\ndollars. His benefactor had not only paid him a full salary, but,\r\nbesides this, perceiving that Joel displayed an aptitude for business,\r\nMr. Bellows allowed him privileges by which he was able to make some\r\nmoney on his own account. The result was, he had accumulated the sum I\r\nhave mentioned, from which had now been disbursed five hundred dollars\r\nfor the land purchase.\r\n\r\nThrough the winter Joel was very busy. He hired four stout, active\r\nlumber-men, built a rude log-hut, which was comfortable enough inside,\r\nand all set to work first to cut a road to the highway. Then they\r\ncommenced clearing. The timber was magnificent first-growth pine. It cut\r\nup splendidly. The lumber-men now saw what Hiram was driving at. They\r\nbegan to respect the young fellow who looked so much like a boy, yet who\r\nshowed such pluck, nerve, and sagacity. After a while, in a pleasant\r\nposition on the ridge could be seen a very neat log-house in progress of\r\nerection. It contained four rooms--a spacious edifice for the woods--all\r\nof course on the ground floor, for there was no second story. Great\r\nattention was paid in a rude way to the interior, and by spring it was\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter Joel was twice absent from the 'settlement' for two or\r\nthree days. He was making a visit to--- Ellen's aunt. That worthy woman\r\nhad only been half-persuaded when she invited her niece home. Very soon,\r\nshe began to think she had made a mistake in 'harboring' her, especially\r\nas the news spread abroad that Bellows' estate was a very great deal\r\nworse than nothing. To be sure Joel's presence reässured her, he looked\r\nso competent, and spoke so confidently yet still so mysteriously. On his\r\nsecond visit, however, the lady pretty flatly intimated she was losing\r\nconfidence in his assertions. She did not believe her brother had left\r\nEllen a cent in any shape.\r\n\r\n'And I tell you what it is, Joel Burns, you need not think we are going\r\nto support her. She must earn her living like other folks.'\r\n\r\n'_I_ will be responsible for Ellen's board,' said Joel indignantly. 'I\r\nwould have said that before, but I should feel mortified to have her\r\nknow I had made the offer, or you had accepted it.'\r\n\r\n'You need not mount your high horse with me, Joel,' retorted the other,\r\nbut in a mollified tone. 'You know I am just as kind to Ellen as any\r\nbody would be under the circumstances.'\r\n\r\n'As kind as Mr. Bellows would have been to Tilly and Eliza, had they\r\nbeen left orphans, I suppose,' interrupted the still indignant Joel.\r\n\r\n'Yes, to be sure. You don't imagine I should have expected him to take\r\ncare of my children!'\r\n\r\n'But he would have done it though.'\r\n\r\n'Well that may or may not be--he is dead and gone, poor man, and I have\r\ndone my best to make it pleasant for Ellen, and she will tell you so. We\r\nhave got along very well; I like her and her cousins like her, and I am\r\nsatisfied after what you have said.'\r\n\r\nBy the middle of April, the people of Sudbury had made up their minds\r\nthat Joel Burns was neither crazy nor exactly a hermit, nor yet a fool,\r\nthough some candidly admitted they had been fools when they so judged of\r\nhim. For by the middle of April a saw-mill with a double set of saws had\r\nbeen put in operation, and was turning out the lumber rapidly. Quickly\r\nthe knowing ones saw into it, (but they did not see into it till Joel\r\nhad made his demonstration,) and now wondered why they had overlooked\r\nthe speculation. One very keen fellow determined to make the most out of\r\nJoel's beginning. He examined the records at the office of the register\r\nof deeds and discovered that Joel had title to but a hundred acres.\r\nThereupon he went to New-York with the object of purchasing the adjacent\r\nlands. Imagine his chagrin, when he was told Joel had the refusal of the\r\nwhole tract. With a low cunning he endeavored to make the old merchant\r\ndissatisfied with the sale, by telling him that he had parted with his\r\nproperty for a quarter of its value--in fact, had given it away. He\r\nwould have offered twice the money himself.\r\n\r\n'I am glad to hear you say so,' was the only reply the fellow received,\r\n'for I take a great interest in that young man. So he has got his mill\r\na-going, has he? Good.'\r\n\r\n'But if I should offer you ten dollars an acre for the next\r\nhundred-acre-lot, don't you think you could manage to let me have it?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\nWhat an excitement there was when our smart man returned and gave an\r\naccount of his trip. Then followed all sorts of rumors. Joel was in\r\npartnership with a rich old fellow in 'York,' who was going to let him\r\nhave all the money he wanted. There was to be a new village right away,\r\nsituated somewhere--on the ridge--on the stream--across the creek--on\r\nthe plain--under the hill. What wouldn't the speculators give to know\r\n_just_ where! With the erection of the saw-mill, several little huts\r\nwent up near it for the use of those employed there. These huts were not\r\nmade of logs--there was plenty of lumber now--but cheaply constructed\r\nand clap-boarded with slabs. Some of the Sudbury wits derisively called\r\nthe place 'Slab City.' The lumber-men seemed to like this name, for they\r\nat once adopted it, and it has never been known by any other.\r\n\r\nBut before this, a remarkable event occurred, affording still greater\r\nfood for town-talk and gossip generally. The neat log-house on the ridge\r\nhad been comfortably furnished, and Ellen Bellows--now Ellen\r\nBurns--installed as its mistress.\r\n\r\nOn his third visit the mystery was solved in a manner quite satisfactory\r\nto the aunt. To do that lady justice, we must say she was not half so\r\nselfish nor so calculating as she might have been. It is true she had\r\nnot generosity enough to run the risk of offering Ellen a home as long\r\nas she might require one, whatever should happen. But she was tolerably\r\nkind to her, and when she heard that a wedding was to be speedily\r\nimprovised, she entered into it heart and soul, and made every thing\r\npass pleasantly, yes, happily. Furthermore, I am bound to record that\r\nshe refused to take one penny for Ellen's 'board,' although Joel pressed\r\nher to do so.\r\n\r\n'Do you think I am an old hunks, Joel, because I did not feel able to\r\nundertake Ellen's support? Prudent I try to be, it is my duty. Haven't I\r\nmy own children to look after? but because I _am_ prudent and do my\r\nduty, can't I show some kindness to my poor brother's only child? Don't\r\ntalk to me about 'board,' and, Joel, don't say any thing to Ellen about\r\nour previous conversation. You know I have always been perfectly\r\nsatisfied with every thing you told me.'\r\n\r\nJoel felt too happy then to question the fact, if indeed, it could be\r\nquestioned. He reässured the good woman on that head, and added he\r\nshould in due time expect visits from Tilly and Eliza.\r\n\r\n'They will be delighted to go, and what is more Mr. Barron (her husband)\r\nhas been thinking a good deal of leaving here, and I should not be\r\nsurprised if he paid you a visit one of these days to see what chances\r\noffer, for we have all heard how smart _you_ have been.'\r\n\r\nIt is essential I should explain to the reader why Joel Burns, who was\r\ningenuous and truthful, and by no means fond of mystery or concealment,\r\nshould make use of both in his intercourse with Ellen's aunt. We have\r\npreviously stated how desperately he was in love with Ellen, and further\r\nhow hard he tried to make himself believe his affection could never be\r\nreciprocated. When, however, the day of trial came suddenly on _her_,\r\nall the nonsense was scattered from Joel's brain like mist before the\r\nwind. But the romance in his heart was not dissipated, because romance\r\nis _not_ nonsense. Genuine romance is a real element in our natures, and\r\nso long as we preserve it, we are young. When Joel found himself placed\r\nin the position of Ellen's sole protector, he took prompt and decisive\r\nsteps _for_ her protection. But while he hoped to win her for his wife,\r\nhe could not endure the thought that possibly a part of his success\r\nmight be due to the change in Ellen's fortunes, or that her choice\r\nshould not be free and unrestrained. It was for this reason he mystified\r\nthe aunt and procured for Ellen a cordial invitation to stay with her\r\n'till the business matters were settled,' thus mystifying Ellen also.\r\nShe, poor girl, continued in happy ignorance of her absolutely\r\ndestitute condition. She loved Joel dearly, and it was one of her\r\nhappiest day-dreams to plan how she could aid him in his projects by\r\nputting him in possession of all she should have--yes, all.\r\n\r\nThe evening before the wedding, after Joel had given a full history of\r\nthe progress of the 'settlement' and what he hoped to do in the future,\r\nEllen, overcoming the timidity which had before prevented her speaking,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n'O Joel! how much you have done--all alone, too! When you get what is\r\ncoming to me, won't _that_ help you? and you shall have the whole of it,\r\ndear Joel, every dollar!'\r\n\r\nShe stopped and blushed, half-frightened at her boldness. Tears came\r\ninto Joel's eyes, he was so happy. He threw his arms around his beloved\r\nand pressed her to his heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeople could now understand where the village was to be. The new road\r\nhad been laid out and was in course of construction. It passed along the\r\nridge near the centre. On computing the distances, it was found this\r\npoint would be a convenient one for a stage-house, where passengers\r\ncould pass the night. Joel sold to the stage company what lots they\r\nrequired, at a very low price, on condition that they would erect a\r\nfirst-rate public house. The water-power at 'Slab City,' three fourths\r\nof a mile distant, attracted attention. The 'fell' was large, and the\r\nsupply of water abundant. One man started with a turning-machine, which\r\nwas attached to the mill. Another, with more capital, established a\r\nfulling-mill, and so on. Joel avoided the ordinary errors of\r\nlandholders. He did not attempt to carry on all sorts of business\r\nhimself, neither did he hold his lots at too high prices. To actual\r\nsettlers he sold very cheap; to speculators he would not sell at all.\r\nThe old merchant continued his friend. By his recommendation a man with\r\nconsiderable capital visited the place, and being well pleased,\r\npurchased some of the water-power and built a large button-factory,\r\nJoel's views proved most judicious. By laying out the village on the\r\nridge, he secured a beautiful site, which was relieved from a close\r\nproximity to shops and mills and factories, while it had really the\r\nsupport of all these. Several fine houses were now erected. Two stores\r\nwere started, and a meeting-house built, for which Joel gave nearly all\r\nthe lumber. Next a post-office was established, and the place called\r\nBurnsville. It was a beautiful spot, and how it grew and flourished! But\r\nBurnsville would have amounted to little had it not been for Slab City.\r\nJoel took care not to lose an opportunity for strengthening _it_.\r\nWater-power could always be had of him cheap. I forgot to say he erected\r\na 'grist-mill,' which was much needed. Two other saw-mills beside his\r\nown were built a little way further up, but on his tract. Mr. Barron and\r\nfamily did move to Burnsville, as Mrs. B. intimated they might. He\r\nbrought a good deal of money with him, and turned his enterprise to\r\naccount. The families continued intimate. In ten years Burnsville became\r\none of the most prosperous villages in the State. Joel Burns was a rich\r\nman, as well as _the_ man of the place. These ten years had wrought no\r\ngreat changes in Joel's character or habits. To be sure he had become\r\nmore engrossed in plans for future operations. By degrees he had\r\nnarrowed his mind into the channel of _successful effort_. The\r\ncircumference of his existence was probably more limited than when he\r\nbrought his little wife into the pretty log-house on the ridge. (He now\r\nlived in the handsomest one in the village.) Still, he was more active,\r\nmore perseveringly energetic, more effective than ever before. But the\r\nromance of which I spoke had faded, or was overshadowed, by the forms of\r\nactive, busy, bustling life. Still Joel Burns was in the main the same\r\ningenuous, honest-hearted fellow as ever. A happy man--happy in his\r\nhome--happy because prosperous in his business--but by no means as happy\r\nas he might have been. Regarding him in this view, it was melancholy to\r\nsee him so utterly engrossed in his pursuits and plans. He did not take\r\ntime to look about him and enjoy. The Sabbath to him was a dull,\r\nwearisome, restless day. He had too much respect for it to desecrate it\r\nby even a private attention to his affairs, and he had very little idea\r\nof any spiritual wants. He was active in erecting a church and securing\r\na good preacher, on whose ministrations he attended regularly with his\r\nfamily. Yet it was a great relief to him when Sunday was over, and he\r\nwelcomed the succeeding morning with a renewed zest.\r\n\r\nJoel Burns became a very popular man; he was universally beloved; he was\r\ngenerous and public-spirited. He was unselfish in his ordinary dealings,\r\nand always ready to lend a helping hand to those about him. His success\r\nwas not owing to a close, hard, grasping nature, but was the result of\r\nfine business abilities, coupled with extraordinary energy and\r\nperseverance.\r\n\r\nJoel Burns was unjust to no one but himself. He neglected to cultivate\r\nhis moral nature, and left it in danger of being choked by the cares he\r\nvoluntarily assumed. He had one safeguard, however. I have observed that\r\nhe was happy in his family. This consisted of his wife, and one child--a\r\ndaughter named Sarah, after Joel's mother. When with them, Joel _did_\r\nforget his business life. His love for his wife and child was like a\r\ngushing fountain of pure water. It preserved his heart from becoming\r\narid, and his nature from ossification.\r\n\r\nTwelve years passed, and found Burnsville more nourishing than ever, and\r\nJoel Burns yet without any interruption to his fortunes or his\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nLate in summer, typhus fever--a dreadful visitor in this part of\r\nNew-England--made its appearance, and became more prevalent than usual,\r\nand assumed a severer type. Mrs. Burns was among the first attacked, and\r\nwith great severity.\r\n\r\nJoel felt the foundations of his soul giving way when the possibility\r\npresented itself that his wife _might_ die. He called to mind with a\r\nshudder the scene at the village tavern in Sudbury, when, a child, he\r\nstood by his mother's bedside and heard, awe-struck, her incoherent\r\nravings while the delirium of fever was on her. 'O my God! she will die,\r\nshe will die!' he exclaimed, as he rushed out of the room, unable to\r\ncontrol his feelings.\r\n\r\nThe country was scoured for doctors. An eminent medical man from\r\nNew-Haven was sent for. He was unable to come; but the house was filled\r\nwith consulting physicians. Alas I they knew little in those days how to\r\ntreat this terrible malady, or rather how to skillfully let it alone.\r\nDay after day, Joel paced up and down, now in this room, now in that,\r\nall over the house. At night he watched by his wife. He insisted on\r\ndoing so; no argument or entreaty could prevail on him to leave her a\r\nmoment. She was delirious nearly all the time. Then her voice would be\r\nstrong, her eyes glassy bright, her cheeks flushed and burning. She\r\nrecognized neither husband nor child.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was in the middle of the night. The 'watcher' who sat up in company\r\nwith Joel, slumbered in his chair. He did not slumber, but sat with eyes\r\nfixed on his wife, who for some time seemed to be resting easier than\r\nbefore. Presently her lips moved. Her husband bent over her.\r\n\r\n'Joel.'\r\n\r\n'I am here, my darling.'\r\n\r\n'Joel.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dearest.'\r\n\r\n'We have not lived right'\r\n\r\n'No, dear.'\r\n\r\n'You do not think we have lived right, do you?'\r\n\r\n'No, oh! no.'\r\n\r\n'I am going to die, Joel.'\r\n\r\n'Do not speak in that way!' and the poor fellow groaned, in spite of\r\nevery effort to control himself.\r\n\r\n'I must, Joel, I must. We have not lived right _You_ will live right\r\nwhen I am gone. You will teach Sarah to live right, won't you?'\r\n\r\n'I don't want to live at all if you do not live!' was the passionate\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n'For our child's sake, Joel.'\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n'What a kind, loving husband you have been to me--been to me always! I\r\nloved you--loved you before you knew it, Joel.' Here she opened her eyes\r\nlanguidly, and essayed to turn them on him. 'But we have not lived\r\nright.'\r\n\r\nThere was still no response, save by audible sobs.\r\n\r\n'I think I have made my peace with God. Are you glad, Joel?'\r\n\r\n'Now I don't care what happens, if you only feel happy!' he cried. 'But\r\nto have you die in distress of mind! It would drive me crazy.'\r\n\r\n'Give God the praise, Joel. I _am_ happy. It is so sweet to trust in\r\nHim! You won't neglect--neglect--you won't----' She fell into a stupor,\r\nfrom which she never fully awoke. Although she lived another day, she\r\nexhibited no signs of consciousness. Joel fancied that she was aware of\r\nhis presence; but she never spoke again.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was attended by a large concourse of people--very different\r\nfrom that of Joel's mother, whom three selectmen followed to the grave.\r\nWhen it was over, Joel and his daughter went back to their desolate\r\nhouse, while the village set to work to speculate as to whom the widower\r\nwould marry. '_Such_ a match! _So_ rich, and only one child! Emily Parks\r\nwould make him a good wife; only Emily was rather old--at least\r\ntwenty-seven or eight--and Mr. Burns would marry a young girl, of\r\ncourse. Why shouldn't he, with the amount of money he had? He might take\r\na fancy to Julia Davis--she had just left school.' 'Why shouldn't he\r\nmarry Lizzie?' said Mrs. Barron to herself. And Lizzie was sent over\r\nthat very day to 'see to things' for Mr. Burns.\r\n\r\nHis trials were not ended. Sarah, who was now in her twelfth year, was\r\ntaken ill the following week. The fever was no doubt going through the\r\nfamily, said the doctors. Joel's faith in medical men was a good deal\r\nshaken, but he had to call them in, and Sarah grew worse. Three weeks\r\nshe lay, submitting to the old treatment, waiting for the 'crisis.' Joel\r\ncould endure it no longer. He started for New-Haven, changing horses\r\nevery ten miles. He found the doctor he went in quest of at home; but he\r\nsaid it was impossible for him to go.\r\n\r\n'I have lost my wife, and shall lose my child,' said Joel Burns\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n'My friend,' said the doctor in a mild tone, 'people are dying every\r\nwhere. I have my own patients, whom I ought not to neglect.'\r\n\r\n'Go with me, I, implore you,' urged the despairing man; 'I have relays\r\nof horses, and I will drive ten miles an hour.' Joel's importunity\r\nprevailed. The distance was accomplished in a marvelously brief time.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot, sultry day, the second week of September, about noon, when\r\nJoel, accompanied by the doctor, entered the sick-room.\r\n\r\n'How is Sarah?'\r\n\r\n'No better,' whispered Miss Barron, who had remained in the house. 'The\r\ndoctor left half an hour ago. He says he thinks she will go as her\r\nmother went.'\r\n\r\n'I am awake, father!' (He had approached the bed very carefully, so as\r\nnot to disturb her.) 'It seems a great while since you went away.'\r\n\r\n'I have brought a doctor to cure you, my child,' said Joel. He knew the\r\nvalue of hope and confidence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the physician was glancing around the room. As I have said, it\r\nwas a close, sultry day; but the windows were all closed, so that not a\r\nbreath of air could circulate through the apartment. The doctor quietly\r\nthrew up every one of them. Perceiving a cot standing near, he ordered\r\nit made up with fresh sheets. Going to the bedside of his little\r\npatient: 'How do you feel, my child?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'I don't know.'\r\n\r\n'Bring me a bowl of water and a soft napkin.'\r\n\r\n'Warm water, I suppose?' said the nurse.\r\n\r\n'Cold.' He threw off the heavy blanket from the bed, and unbuttoning the\r\nnight-dress, which came close around her, he bathed the child's face and\r\nneck with the grateful fluid.\r\n\r\n'You feel better now?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she whispered.\r\n\r\n'Don't you want any thing, my dear?'\r\n\r\n'I want some water.'\r\n\r\n'Give her water, nurse,' said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe woman stared in utter amazement. If she had been ordered to cut the\r\nchild's throat, she could not have been more astounded.\r\n\r\n'I say, bring a tumbler of water.'\r\n\r\nThis was done, and the nurse offered the patient a few drops in a\r\ntea-spoon.\r\n\r\n'Give me the glass,' and he took it out of her hand. Tenderly he raised\r\nthe sick child to a comfortable position, and placed it to her lips.\r\n'Take as much as you like, my dear. Water was made to drink.'\r\n\r\nHe now directed a complete and speedy change of garments, and then he\r\nhimself took Sarah in his arms and laid her on the other bed. In fifteen\r\nminutes, she was sleeping, while a gentle perspiration showed the crisis\r\nhad passed. Joel Burns stood still, regarding the doctor as he would a\r\nbeing from another world. When he saw him doing just what was invariably\r\nprohibited, doing it with such an air of decision and self-confidence\r\nyet with no peculiar ostentation, he felt it would all be right. The\r\nnurse, at first, was in very bad humor; but nobody noticed her, so she\r\nconcluded it was best to be good-natured and obey orders. The next day,\r\nthe doctor pronounced little Sarah out of danger, provided she was\r\nproperly nursed, and after leaving special directions, which he charged\r\nJoel to see to personally till he could hear from him, he returned home\r\nas rapidly as he came. When the man who accompanied him came back, he\r\nbrought the doctor's favorite student, who had directions to devote\r\nhimself to the 'case,' in which the doctor took so strong an interest.\r\nThe good man had another motive. He believed the fever was about to\r\nattack Joel, and he determined to exert his skill to save him, if\r\npossible. To have advised him of his fears, would have been injudicious.\r\nHe therefore dispatched a young man in whom he had great confidence,\r\nafter giving him minute instructions. Little Sarah, watched and tended\r\nwith great care, grew rapidly better. But when the excitement produced\r\nby the scenes through which Joel had passed was at an end, a great\r\nreaction took place, which left him in a very weak state. In that\r\ncondition, he was seized by the terrible malady, which found a fit\r\nsubject in his weakened frame and broken spirits. For weeks Joel Burns\r\nlay balancing between life and death. It seemed as if a feather's weight\r\non either side would turn the scale. Morning after morning, the question\r\nwas put by the whole village: 'Is Mr. Burns alive?' Twice, on occasions\r\nwhich seemed specially urgent, did our worthy doctor come from\r\nNew-Haven, spend a few hours, and return. The medical student kept his\r\npost manfully. It was something to go counter to the opinions and\r\njudgments of all the physicians about, far and near. Especially when, if\r\nthe patient should die, the voice of authority would proclaim that a\r\nmurder had been committed. [Now, it would be considered murder to follow\r\nthe old method.] But the doctor was firm, his pupil an enthusiastic\r\nbeliever in his master's genius, and the course was persisted in. At\r\nlength, the daily reports were modified. First, Mr. Burns was 'no\r\nworse.' After that, he was 'a little more comfortable.' Then came the\r\nannouncement that he was 'better.' The medical men round about were\r\nexcessively chagrined; but every body else rejoiced at the good news.\r\n\r\nAll this time, what of Joel Burns? How did he do? Not what was the\r\nhistory of his physical malady. But what was his state morally,\r\nmentally, religiously before God! Recollect, the man had never had a\r\ncheck in his whole career before. The circumstances of his childhood\r\nserved rather to give strength and firmness to his nature. The sudden\r\nfailure and death of his benefactor only threw him the more on his own\r\nresources, with which he was amply provided. His plans had been\r\nsuccessful. His friends were many. His hopes for the future were large,\r\nyet not unreasonable; while on all sides, as we have said, he was\r\nregarded as _the_ man of the community in which he lived.\r\n\r\nJoel had scarcely time for reflection, after the death of his wife,\r\nbefore his child was taken ill, and ere she was really out of danger, he\r\nhimself was stricken down. All that long, weary time, during days and\r\nnights of fever and delirium, of exhaustion and weakness, of\r\nconvalescence and recovery, the whisper of his dying wife was constantly\r\nheard:\r\n\r\n'Joel, we have not lived right! Do you think we have lived right, Joel?'\r\n\r\n'_Lived right_!' What did that mean? Was Joel Burns a dishonest man? Was\r\nhe not kind-hearted, generous, loving toward his wife, affectionate to\r\nhis child, charitable and public-spirited?\r\n\r\n'_Lived right_.' Joel had answered his wife instantly, not daring then\r\nand there to soothe her by equivocation, but replying truthfully out of\r\nhis soul: 'No, oh! no.' What did he mean by that? Of what did he stand\r\nconvicted, and wherefore? These were the thoughts which occupied his\r\nmind, especially after the fever had left him, during the long weeks of\r\nhis recovery. Joel was a man of extraordinary perceptive faculties. The\r\nsituation in which he had been placed, the remarkable health which he\r\nhad enjoyed, (for he had never been ill in his life,) and the success\r\nwhich had attended every plan and effort, served to still more develop\r\nall his practical talents, and were at the same time unfavorable to\r\nreflection or serious thought. Now he could do nothing else but reflect\r\nand think. He looked about him. His wife was gone, and his happiness\r\nwrecked. What was he to do? Should he make haste to push on the schemes\r\nwhich his sickness had brought to a stand? The idea was loathsome to\r\nhim. He had seen how completely they were liable to interruption and\r\nblight. The thought of his daughter was the only comfort left, but she\r\nmight be taken--then _what_?\r\n\r\nAh! Joel Burns! how long and wide you searched to answer that question\r\nwhen the answer was so near at hand and so easy to discover. He did\r\ndiscover it at last. His wife, with her latest breath, had given him the\r\nclue. He examined himself more carefully. What are the relations between\r\nme and my Maker? Do I recognize any?... When Joel Burns rose from his\r\nsick-bed and could walk abroad, all things wore to him a new and pleased\r\naspect. The current of his hopes were changed. He no longer revolved\r\naround himself as a centre. He was conscious of his error before God,\r\nand sought and found 'peace in believing.' He now regarded all things in\r\nthe light of His providence and felt submissive to His will.\r\n\r\nJoel was no longer indifferent to his affairs. There was so much he\r\ncould do to benefit every body. What a happy feeling to try to be\r\nworking out good for some body all the time! When, however, he was able\r\nactively to engage in business, there was very little difference between\r\nhis course of action and in what he did and his old course and what he\r\nused to do. The fact is, Joel _did_ about what was right before. We have\r\nalready related that he was kind, charitable, generous, and\r\npublic-spirited. The difference, however, was, that Joel _himself_ was\r\nchanged. The _springs_ of life and conduct were new: this is why he\r\nseemed to himself to be living so differently. And he _was_ living\r\ndifferently. There was no similitude between the Joel Burns who,\r\nimpelled by an active brain and an energetic purpose, was successfully\r\nprosecuting certain plans with reference solely _to_ those plans, and\r\nthe Joel Burns who had learned to feel that the chief _object_ of\r\nexistence lay above and beyond, and was centred in the Omnipotent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSarah recovered rapidly from the fever, and before her father was\r\nhimself convalescent the bloom of health had returned to her cheeks.\r\nJoel's love for his child was increased ten-fold. She became, as she\r\ngrew up, an inseparable companion. It was evident he had no thoughts of\r\nmarrying. The people of the village decided _that_ at the end of a year.\r\nThe widower gave none of the ordinary tokens that he was seeking a new\r\nwife, that is, he did not 'brush up' any, and took no special pains with\r\nhis personal appearance, but went about much as usual. It was a great\r\npity, every body said, for a man as young as he--hardly\r\nthree-and-thirty--to live without a wife. Sarah required a motherly care\r\nover her, her father was spoiling her. Yes, it was a great pity Mr.\r\nBurns did not marry. The fact was, strange as it will seem, Joel could\r\nnot forget his wife, though she was dead. A sweet and solemn link bound\r\nhim to her since the night he stood over her to catch her last words,\r\nand it would appear his affections were not to be diverted from her\r\nmemory. He did not send Sarah away to school. He could not reconcile\r\nhimself to her absence, but he supplied her abundantly with teachers,\r\nand personally took great pains with her education.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the death of Mrs. Burns, Joel and his daughter stood up\r\ntogether before the assembled church and congregation, and made a public\r\nprofession of religion. It was a touching sight. And when after the\r\nservices father and child took their way homeward, every eye followed\r\nthem with looks of deepest interest and with feelings of almost\r\nuniversal kindness and regard. Joel had delayed presenting himself from\r\na desire to test his feelings, having great fear of bringing reproach on\r\nthe church by entering it unworthily. And now he had an increased joy\r\nthat he could bring his darling into the fold with him.\r\n\r\nIt was very natural, as she was situated, that Sarah should acquire an\r\naccurate knowledge of her father's affairs. She enjoyed listening to the\r\nstory of his early life, the rise and progress of Burnsville, with\r\nexplanations of his many undertakings. As she grew older, this interest\r\ntook a more practical turn. She would copy letters and arrange\r\nconfidential papers, and perform various services of a like nature.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years more passed. Things went on as usual, at Burnsville.\r\nIt is true that Joel Burns did not display that sharp faculty of\r\nacquisition which he formerly did, though he was never more active or\r\nenergetic; but it was noticeable that those in his employ got on better\r\nthan before, while the general prosperity of the village exceeded that\r\nof any former period.\r\n\r\nSarah was almost a young lady. She was growing up a beautiful girl. She\r\nhad her father's brilliant complexion and her mother's fine form and\r\nregular features. Of course, with so much youth and beauty, and such\r\n'brilliant prospects,' (by which, I suppose, was meant her father's\r\ndeath and a large fortune to the child,) Sarah already became an object\r\nof much attention. I will not say that her peculiar position did not\r\nproduce something of an independent manner which some called hauteur,\r\nand others exclusiveness. Part of this was owing to her education, part\r\nto the necessity of repelling sometimes the advances of conceited\r\ncoxcombs. But she was really a most interesting girl, with much of her\r\nfather's spirit, resolution, and ability. Her affection for him was only\r\nexceeded by his for her. True, their lives were centred in each other\r\ntoo much. But it was very beautiful to behold.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Burnsville, and such the situation of Joel\r\nBurns, when Hiram Meeker sought to remove to that place and enter his\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY.\r\n\r\n  'All of which I saw, and part of which I was.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIt is a dingy old sign. It has hung there in sun and rain till its\r\nletters are faint and its face is furrowed. It has looked down on a\r\ngeneration that has passed away, and seen those who placed it there go\r\nout of that doorway never to return; still it clings to that dingy old\r\nwarehouse, and still Russell, Rollins & Co. is signed in that dingy old\r\ncounting-room at the head of the stairway. It is known the world over.\r\nIt is heard of on the cotton-fields of Texas, in the cane-brakes of\r\nCuba, and amid the rice-swamps of Carolina. The Chinaman speaks of it as\r\nhe sips his tea and handles his chop-sticks in the streets of Canton,\r\nand the half-naked negro rattles its gold as he gathers palm-oil and the\r\ncopal-gum on the western coast of Africa. Its plain initials, painted in\r\nblack on a white ground, float from tall masts over many seas, and its\r\nsimple 'promise to pay,' scrawled in a bad hand on a narrow strip of\r\npaper, unlocks the vaults of the best bankers in Europe. And yet, it is\r\na dingy old sign! Men look up to it as they pass by, and wonder that a\r\ncracked, weather-beaten board that would not sell for a dollar, should\r\nbe counted 'good for a million.'\r\n\r\nIt is a dingy old warehouse, with narrow, dark, cobwebbed windows, and\r\nwide, rusty iron shutters, which, as the bleak November wind sweeps up\r\nold Long Wharf, swing slowly on their hinges with a sharp, grating\r\ncreak. I heard them in my boyhood. Perched on a tall stool at that old\r\ndesk, I used to listen, in the long winter-nights, to those strange,\r\nwild cries, till I fancied they were voices of the uneasy dead, come\r\nback to take the vacant seats beside me, and to pace again, with ghostly\r\ntread, the floor of that dark old counting-room. They were ever a\r\nmystery and a terror to me; but they never creaked so harshly, or cried\r\nso wildly, as on a bleak November night, not many years ago, when I\r\nturned my steps, for the last time, up the trembling old stairway.\r\n\r\nIt was just after nightfall. A single gas-burner threw a dim, uncertain\r\nlight over the old desk, and lit up the figure of a tall, gray-headed\r\nman, who was bending over it. He had round, stooping shoulders, and\r\nlong, spindling limbs. One of his large feet, encased in a thick,\r\nsquare-toed shoe, rested on the round of the desk, the other, which was\r\nplanted squarely on the floor, upheld his spare, gaunt frame. His face\r\nwas thin and long, and two deep, black lines under his eyes contrasted\r\nstrangely with the pallid whiteness of his features. His clothes were of\r\nthe fashion of some years ago, and had, no doubt, served long as his\r\n'Sunday best,' before being degraded to daily duty. They were of plain\r\nblack, and though not shabby, were worn and threadbare, and of decidedly\r\neconomical appearance. Every thing about him, indeed, wore an economical\r\nlook. His scant coat-tails, narrow pants, and short waistcoat, showed\r\nthat the cost of each inch of material had been counted, while his thin\r\nhair, brushed carefully over his bald head, had not a lock to spare; and\r\neven his large, sharp bones were covered with only just enough flesh to\r\nhold them comfortably together. He had stood there till his eye was dim\r\nand his step feeble, and though he had, for twenty years--when handing\r\nin his semi-annual trial-balances to the head of the house--declared\r\nthat each one was his last, every body said he would continue to stand\r\nthere till his own trial-balance was struck, and his earthly accounts\r\nwere closed forever.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, he turned his mild blue eye upon me, and taking my hand\r\nwarmly in his, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'My dear boy'--I was nearly forty--'I am glad to see you.'\r\n\r\n'I am glad to see _you_, David.'\r\n\r\n'Why, bless me, Mr. Kirke, is that you?' exclaimed a much younger man,\r\nspringing from his seat near the other, and grasping me by both hands.\r\n'What has brought you to Boston?'\r\n\r\n'Business, Frank. I've just arrived, and go back to-morrow. Come! my\r\nwife is in the carriage at the door, and wants you to spend the evening\r\nwith us.'\r\n\r\n'I can't--I'm very sorry,' and he added, in a lower tone, '_she_ has\r\njust heard of her father's death, and goes home to-morrow. I have\r\nengaged to pass the evening with her.'\r\n\r\n'Her father dead! how was it?'\r\n\r\n'He was thrown from his horse, and died the same day. She knew nothing\r\nof it till yesterday. I can not neglect her now. I will spend to-morrow\r\nwith mother.'\r\n\r\nHe always called her _mother_, though he was not her son. He had done it\r\nwhen a child, and now that he was a man, hers was the dearest name he\r\nknew. He loved her as his mother, and she loved him as her son. But any\r\nwoman might have loved him. His straight, closely-knit, sinewy frame,\r\ndark, deep-set eyes, and broad, open forehead, overhung with thick,\r\nbrown hair, were only the outshadowing of a beautiful mind, of an open,\r\nupright, manly nature, whose firm and steady integrity nothing could\r\nshake.\r\n\r\n'I'm sorry to hear it,' I replied; 'but go down and see her, while I\r\nspeak to Mr. Hallet.'\r\n\r\nRapping at the door of an inner office, separated from the outer one by\r\na ground-glass partition, I was admitted by a tall, dark man, who, with\r\na stiff and slightly embarrassed manner, said to me:\r\n\r\n'I am glad to see you, Mr. Kirke. Pray, be seated.'\r\n\r\nAs he pointed to a chair, a shorter and younger gentleman, who was\r\nwriting at another desk, rose, and slapping me familiarly on the back,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow, how are you?'\r\n\r\n'Very well, Cragin, how are you?'\r\n\r\n'Good as new--never better in my life--how goes the world with you?'\r\n\r\nThe last speaker was not more than thirty-three, but a bald spot on the\r\ntop of his head, and a slight falling-in of his mouth, caused by\r\npremature decay of the teeth, made him seem several years older. He had\r\nmarked but not regular features, and a restless, dark eye, which opened\r\nand shut with a peculiar wink that kept time with the motion of his lips\r\nin speaking. His clothes were cut in a loose, jaunty style, and his\r\nmanner, though brusque and abrupt, betokened, like his face, a free,\r\nfrank, manly character. He was ten or twelve years the junior of the\r\nother, and as unlike him as one man can be unlike another.\r\n\r\nThe older gentleman, as I have said, was tall and dark. He had a high,\r\nbold forehead, and wore heavy gray whiskers, trimmed with the utmost\r\nnicety, and meeting under a sharp, narrow chin. His face was large and\r\nfull, and his nose pointed and prominent, but his mouth was small, and\r\ngathered in at the corners like a rat's; and, as if to add to the\r\nrat-resemblance, its small, white teeth seemed borrowed from the jaws of\r\nthat animal. There was a stately precision in his manner, and a stealthy\r\nsoftness in his tread, that would have impressed a stranger unfavorably;\r\nbut _I_ knew him. We had been boys together, and he loved me as he loved\r\nhis own son. How well he loved _him_, the reader will learn, if he\r\nfollows the course of my story.\r\n\r\nThese two gentlemen--Mr. Hallet and Mr. Cragin--were the senior partners\r\nin the great house of Russell, Rollins & Co.\r\n\r\nReplying satisfactorily to the inquiry of Mr. Cragin, I turned to the\r\nolder partner, and said:\r\n\r\n'Well, Mr. Hallet, how does Frank get on?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! very well--knows a little too much, like most young men of his age,\r\nbut he does very well.'\r\n\r\n''Very well,' Mr. Ballet! d--d if he don't--he's the smartest boy\r\nliving--made a clean forty thousand for us not two months ago--forced it\r\non Hallet against his better judgment!' And Mr. Cragin laughed till he\r\nshowed all that was left of two rows of tobacco-stained teeth.\r\n\r\n'How was it Cragin?' I asked, greatly pleased.\r\n\r\nA short rap came at the office-door, and Frank entered, his hat in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n'Mother insists on my taking supper with her--will you go now, sir?' he\r\nsaid, addressing me.\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply, Mr. Hallet, rather sharply, asked:\r\n\r\n'Have you finished your letters for the steamer?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What have you said to Maclean, Maris & Co., about the gum-copal?'\r\n\r\n'I will show you, sir.'\r\n\r\nAnd going into the other room, Frank returned in a moment with an open\r\nletter, still wet from the copying-press. Mr. Hallet took it and read it\r\nover slowly and carefully, then handing it back, he said, in the\r\nslightly pompous tone which was natural to him:\r\n\r\n'That will do--you can go.'\r\n\r\nI was rising to bid them 'good-evening,' when the senior said to me:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Kirke, I dislike to trespass on your time, but I would like to\r\nconfer with you for a moment, on a private matter.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly, sir.' And I added: 'Frank, tell your mother I will meet you\r\nat the hotel in half an hour.'\r\n\r\n'But I must be in Cambridge by eight o'clock,' replied the young man,\r\nlooking a little chop-fallen.\r\n\r\n'Well, don't wait for me--I will see you to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nBidding me 'good-night,' he left; and Mr. Cragin, seeing that his\r\npartner would be alone with me, left shortly afterward. As soon as\r\nCragin was gone, Mr. Hallet, opening the door, called:\r\n\r\n'David!'\r\n\r\nThe book-keeper entered, and took a seat beside me.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Kirke,' said Mr. Hallet, when the other was seated, 'I want to talk\r\nwith you and David about Frank. He has entangled himself with that\r\nSouthern girl, and, I hear, means to marry her. I strongly object to it.\r\nI've not a particle of influence with him, and _you_ must prevent it.'\r\n\r\n'Why should we prevent it?' I asked, rather sharply. 'What is there\r\nagainst the young woman?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing against her character, but she'd not be a fit wife for Frank.\r\nThese Southern women are educated with wrong ideas--they make poor wives\r\nfor poor men. He must marry a rich girl, or one brought up with\r\nNew-England habits. This one would bring him nothing, and spend all he\r\nmade.'\r\n\r\n'But she is an only child, and her father is rich.'\r\n\r\n'Pshaw! that is bosh! Preston always lived high, and I'll guarantee his\r\nestate is bankrupt. I'm sorry for it, for he owes us.'\r\n\r\n'Is that so! Largely?' 'No, not largely; how much is he overdrawn,\r\nDavid?'\r\n\r\n'Eighty-two hundred and odd.'\r\n\r\n'I'm surprised at that,' I said. 'The old house did not allow such\r\nthings.'\r\n\r\n'Neither do we; 'twas Cragin's work. He thought 'twould annoy Frank if\r\nthe drafts went back, and'--he hesitated a moment--'he insisted upon\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'I am opposed to interfering in such matters. I always taught Frank to\r\nthink for himself,' I remarked.\r\n\r\n'You taught him to think too much for himself. He is self-willed and\r\nheadstrong to a fault.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps his father might have trained him better, if--he had tried,' I\r\nreplied, with a slight sneer.\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, Mr. Kirke, I meant no reflection on your management of him.\r\nI only feel that this is a most important step, and he ought to be\r\nadvised. He should marry rich, for he has nothing, and can not rely upon\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n'He does not rely upon you; but he is a partner now, and his income\r\nought to enable him to support a wife.'\r\n\r\n'His income is uncertain; he may not remain long in the concern,'\r\nreplied Mr. Hallet coolly.\r\n\r\nDavid started; his face reddened to the roots of his hair, and he asked\r\nin a sententious way, showing even in his expenditure of breath the\r\nclose economy that was the rule of his life: 'Who told you that, Mr.\r\nHallet?'\r\n\r\n'No one,' replied that gentleman, seemingly surprised at the abrupt\r\nquestion; 'I am deliberating on it myself. He is sowing dissension\r\nbetween Cragin and me. The lowest boy in the office; even you, David,\r\npay more heed to him than to _me_.'\r\n\r\n'That may be your own fault,' I said, a little sarcastically; 'if you\r\nshould treat him as Cragin and David do, you might have nothing to\r\ncomplain of.'\r\n\r\n'I treat him well, sir; but I make him _know his place_.' The last words\r\nwere emphasized in a hard, wicked tone.\r\n\r\nCertain old recollections had been rushing across my memory during the\r\nlatter part of this conversation, and this last remark brought me to my\r\nfeet, as I said: 'You treat him like a dog, sir! I have seen it. If he\r\nwere not your son, he should not stay with you another day! But I warn\r\nyou, John Hallet--do not go too far. Cast that boy off--harm him to the\r\nextent of a hair--and, so help me God, I will strip you of the lying\r\ncloak in which you hide your false, hypocritical soul, and show men\r\n_what you are!_'\r\n\r\nIn my excitement, I had crossed the room, and stood then directly before\r\nhim. His face flushed and his eye quailed before my steady gaze, but he\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\nDavid remarked, in a mild tone: 'Edmund, that an't the right spirit; it\r\nan't.'\r\n\r\n'You don't know the whole, David; if you did, even _you_ would say he is\r\nthe basest man living.'\r\n\r\nHallet pressed his teeth together; his eyes flashed fire, and he seemed\r\nabout to spring upon me; but mastering his passion, he rose after a\r\nmoment and extended his hand, saying: 'Come, Mr. Kirke, this is not the\r\ntalk of old friends! Let us shake hands and forget it.'\r\n\r\n'Never, sir! I took your hand for the last time when I left this\r\ncounting-room, twenty years ago. I never touch it again! I shall tell\r\nthat boy _to-night_ that you are his father.'\r\n\r\n'You will not do so imprudent a thing. I will do any thing for him--any\r\nthing you require. I promise you--on my honor,' and the stately head of\r\nthe great house of Russell, Rollins & Co., sank into a chair and bent\r\ndown his face like a criminal in the dock.\r\n\r\n'I can not trust you,' I said, as I paced the room,\r\n\r\n'You can, Edmund; he means it. He is sorry for the wrong he's done,'\r\nsaid the old book-keeper, in that mild, winning tone which had made me\r\nso love him in my boyhood.\r\n\r\n'Well, let him _prove_ that he means it; let him tell you all; let him\r\ntell you how much he has had to repent of!'\r\n\r\n'I _have_ told him all. I told him years ago.'\r\n\r\n'Did you tell him how you cast off that poor girl? how for years on her\r\nknees she vainly plead for a paltry pittance to keep her child from\r\nstarving and herself from sin? Did you tell him how you forced her on\r\nthe street? how you drove her from you with curses, when she prayed you\r\nto save her from the pit of infamy into which you had plunged her? Did\r\nyou tell him,' and I hissed the words in his ear, while he writhed on\r\nhis seat in such agony as only the guilty can feel; 'how, at last, after\r\nall those wretched years, she died of starvation and disease, with all\r\nthat mountain of sin on her soul, and all of it heaped on her by YOU!'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no! I did not--could not tell him that! I did not know I had done\r\n_that!_' groaned the stately gentleman.\r\n\r\n'You lie, John Hallet! You know you lie! and may God deal with you as\r\nyou dealt with her,' and I took up my hat and laid my hand on the door.\r\n\r\n'Stop, stop, Edmund; don't go with those words. You would not have God\r\ndo to _you_ as you have done to others!' said David, in the same mild\r\ntone as before.\r\n\r\n'True, David. I ought not to wish him harm; but I loathe and detest the\r\nhypocritical villain. Frank shall leave him to-night, and forever!' and\r\nagain I laid my hand on the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallet looked up; his face was pale as marble, and his hands\r\nclenched tightly the arms of his chair, 'Don't go, Mr. Kirke,' he cried;\r\n'stay one moment. Can't this be arranged?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. Sign a dissolution article at once--_here_--NOW, and give\r\nFrank your check for twenty thousand dollars.'\r\n\r\n'No, no! You don't mean that! It is too much--you can not ask _that_!'\r\ngasped the great merchant.\r\n\r\n'Too much for the son of a man worth a million? Too much to pay for\r\nstarving his mother, and turning him adrift at six years old? It is not\r\nenough! He must have _thirty_ thousand!'\r\n\r\n'You are mad, Mr. Kirke!' And he rose, and looked at me with a pleading\r\nface. 'I can not pay that amount down. It is impossible.'\r\n\r\n'David, how much has he in bank on private account?'\r\n\r\nMr. Hallet cast a beseeching glance at his book-keeper; but without\r\nmoving a muscle, the old man quietly replied: 'Fifty-three thousand.'\r\n\r\n'I knew you lied, Hallet. It is natural to you.'\r\n\r\n'But I can't let Frank go without Mr. Cragin's consent.'\r\n\r\n'I will arrange with Cragin. Sign the check and draw the paper at once,\r\nor I go.'\r\n\r\n'But give me time to think--see me to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'I shall never exchange a word with you after to-night. You can have ten\r\nminutes--not a second more,' and I took out my watch to count the time.\r\n\r\nHe seated himself at his desk, and rested his head on his hand for a\r\nmoment; then turning to me, he said: 'You promise that this interview,\r\nand all that has passed, shall never be mentioned by you?'\r\n\r\n'I do--never to your injury.'\r\n\r\n'David, please write the check,' said the senior partner, as he\r\nproceeded himself to draw up the agreement. In a few minutes he handed\r\nit to me. It was short, and merely recited that the co-partnership which\r\nhad theretofore existed between John Hallet, Augustus Cragin, and Henry\r\nF. Mandell, under the name and style of Russell, Rollins & Co., was on\r\nthat day dissolved by mutual consent; said Mandell withdrawing, and\r\nassigning the control of all the assets of said firm to said Hallet and\r\nCragin, and releasing to said Hallet any portion of its capital and\r\nprofits to which he might be entitled.\r\n\r\nI read the document, and quietly handed it back. 'That will not do, Mr.\r\nHallet. Thirty thousand dollars settles with _you_, his father. I have\r\nnot, and _shall_ not make any settlement with the firm. David must pay\r\nFrank what is his due--no more, no less.'\r\n\r\n'But,' began Mr. Hallet.\r\n\r\n'I have nothing more to say on the subject, sir.'\r\n\r\nHe drew a deep sigh. The parting with an only son, and with thirty\r\nthousand dollars, at one and the same time, affected him deeply. He\r\nmight have borne the loss of the son; but the loss of so much money rent\r\nhis small, black soul into fragments. However, he rewrote the paper, and\r\npassed it to me. It was all right; and when he had signed and David had\r\nwitnessed it, I placed it in my pocket-book. Then, with a trembling\r\nhand, he handed me the check. It was drawn to my order; and I remarked,\r\nas I took it: 'This is not what I require, sir. I want your check,\r\nindorsed by David.'\r\n\r\n'This is most unaccountable, Mr. Kirke. Do you question my check for\r\nthirty thousand dollars?' he asked, his face flushing with anger.\r\n\r\n'Oh! no, sir, not at all; but you might stop its payment. With David's\r\nindorsement, you would not _dare_ to do it.'\r\n\r\n'I will indorse it,' said David; and he quietly proceeded to write\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThat cold, hard, soulless man had a wife and children; but that old\r\nbook-keeper was the only being in all this wide world that he loved!\r\n\r\nPlacing the check with the other paper, I shook David by the hand, and\r\nbidding him 'good-night', passed down the old stairway.\r\n\r\nAs Frank is the hero of my history, I will, in another chapter, go back\r\nsome seventeen years, and tell the reader how he came to be under my\r\ncontrol, and how he rose to be a partner in the great house of Russell,\r\nRollins & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN IS KING.\r\n\r\n         Up among the Granite mountains,\r\n           By the Bay State strand,\r\n         Hark! the paean cry is sounding\r\n           Through all Yankee land.\r\n         'Wave the stars and stripes high o'er us,\r\n           Let every freeman sing,\r\n         In a loud and joyful chorus:\r\n           Brave young Corn is King!\r\n  Join, join, for God and freedom!

Gilmore,\r\n     532 Broadway. 1862.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is not altogether in rule to say much of a work which has\r\nappeared in our pages. But we may at least call attention to what others\r\nhave said. And good authority--plenty of it, such authority as should\r\nmake a reputation for any book--has declared _The Pines_ to be in truth\r\na work of the highest merit and of a new order. It is a perfectly\r\ntruthful record of scenes and characters drawn from personal experience\r\nin the South; combining the accuracy of Olmstead's works with the\r\nthrilling interest of _Uncle Tom_. It should be fairly stated--as the\r\nauthor desires it should be--that every thing did not occur precisely in\r\nthe order in which it is here narrated. But all is _true_--every page\r\nspeaks for itself in this particular. No stronger piece of local\r\ncoloring ever issued from the American press. We seem, in reading it, to\r\nlive in the South--to know the people who come before us. All of them\r\nare, indeed, life-portraits. In one or two instances, the very names of\r\nthe originals remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn it the author deals fairly and honorably with the South. The renegade\r\nYankee, and not the native planter, is made to bear the heaviest blow.\r\nThe principal character, Colonel J----, is one of nature's noblemen,\r\nstruggling through aristocratic education and circumstance with an evil\r\nwhose evil he cannot comprehend. Very valuable indeed are the sketches\r\nof life among the 'mean whites.' No descriptions of them to be compared\r\nwith these in _The Pines_ have ever yet appeared. They rise clear as\r\ncameo-reliefs on a dark ground, and we feel that they too are like the\r\nslave-holder, victims like the slave, of a system, and not with him,\r\ndeliberate wretches. Their squalor, ignorance, pride, and\r\ndependence--their whole social _status_, inferior to that of the blacks\r\nwhom they despise, appear as set forth, we do not say by a master-hand,\r\nbut _by themselves_.\r\n\r\nThis work, tolerant and just, yet striking, has appeared at the right\r\ntime. While interesting as a novel, it is full of solid, simple\r\nfacts--it is based on them and built up with them. Without attempting to\r\nset forth a principle, it shows beyond dispute that slavery does not pay\r\nin the South as well as free labor would, and that the blacks would\r\nproduce more as free laborers than as slaves. It shows that Emancipation\r\nfor the sake of the White Man is a great truth, and that the white man\r\nwould be benefited by raising the sense of independence in the black,\r\nand by elevating him in every way in which he is capable of improvement.\r\n\r\nIt may be said with great truth of _The Pines_, that it would be\r\ndifficult to find a book in which such striking facts and vivid pictures\r\nare set forth with such perfect simplicity of language. There is no\r\neffort at fine writing in it, and no consciousness of its absence. The\r\nauthor never seems to have realized that a story could be told for\r\neffect, and the natural result has been the most unintentional yet the\r\nstrongest effect. The practical eye of one familiar with planks and\r\nturpentine, building and farming, business and furniture, economy and\r\ncomfort, betrays itself continually. He sees how things could be\r\nbettered not as a mere philanthropist would try to see them, but as one\r\nwho knows how capital ought to be employed, and he appreciates the fact\r\nthat the sufferings of the people of every class in the South are really\r\nbased on the _wastefulness_ of the present system. That this spirit\r\nshould be combined with a keen observation of local humor, and in\r\nseveral instances with narratives imbued with deep pathos, is not,\r\nhowever, remarkable. The man who can most vividly set forth facts and\r\ntransfer nature to paper, seldom misses variety.\r\n\r\nWe rejoice that this work has met with such favorable reception from the\r\npublic, and are happy to state that the author will continue his\r\ncontributions to these columns. He has already, by a single effort,\r\nestablished a wide-spread reputation, and we know that he has that in\r\nhim which will induce efforts of equal merit and a future which will be\r\nhonorably recorded in histories of the literature of the present day.\r\n\r\n     THOMAS HOOD'S WORKS. Volume IV. Aldine Edition. Edited by\r\n     EPES SARGENT. New-York: G. P. Putnam. Boston: A. K.\r\n     Loring. 1862.\r\n\r\nNo better paper, no better type, can be desired than what is lavished\r\nupon these beautiful editions of Putnam's works. It is a pleasure to\r\ntouch their silky, Baskerville-feeling leaves, and think that one\r\npossesses in the series one more work _de luxe_, which 'any one' might\r\nbe glad to own. The present consists of The Whims and Oddities, with\r\nthe--originally--two volumes of National Tales: the former piquant and\r\nvariously eccentric; the latter written in a quaint, old-fashioned\r\nstyle, which the editor compares justly to that of BOCCACCIO,\r\nyet which was really, till within some fifty years, so very common a\r\nform of narration, having so much in common with Spanish and French\r\n_nouvelettes_, that it is hardly worth while to suppose that\r\nHOOD followed the great. Italian at all. The whole work is one\r\nmass of entertainment, none the worse for having acquired somewhat of a\r\ngame-y flavor of age, and for gradually falling a little behind the\r\nlatest styles of humor. 'Mass! 'tis a merry book, and will make them\r\nmerry who read it!'\r\n\r\n     THE WORKS OF THOMAS HOOD. Edited by EPES SARGENT.\r\n     Vol. V. New-York: G. P. Putnam. 1862.\r\n\r\nThe present volume of Hood's writings is composed of dramatic sketches,\r\nodes, political satires, and miscellaneous pieces not generally\r\ncontained in former collections of his works. Among these is the long\r\nand beautiful 'Lamia' in dramatic form; the 'Epping Hunt;' the poems of\r\nsentiment; the inimitable Odes and Addresses to Great People, and some\r\nscores of minor poems, mostly humorous, including, however, all of those\r\non which his reputation as a true poet of the highest rank is based.\r\nAmong these is the 'Lay of the Laborer,' a standing and bitter reproach\r\nto England--the England of millions of pounds of capital--the England of\r\npiety--the England of morality--the England of 'all the rights of man,'\r\nwhere there are more paupers and more miseries than in any other land on\r\nearth, and where there is accordingly the most social tyranny of any\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n  'Ay, only give me work,\r\n    And then you need not fear\r\n  That I shall snare his worship's hare,\r\n    Or kill his grace's deer.'\r\n\r\n  'Where savage laws begrudge\r\n    The pauper babe its breath,\r\n  And doom a wife to a widow's life\r\n    Before her partner's death.'\r\n\r\nWhen England shall have turned aside the reproach of this poem, it will\r\nbe time for her to abuse America as 'uncivilized.'\r\n\r\n     AGNES OF SORRENTO, By Mrs. HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\r\n     Boston: Ticknor and Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\nIf there be, at the present day, an ungrateful task for an intelligent\r\nreader or a conscientious reviewer, it is to be obliged to deal with a\r\nwork whose whole compass is merely that of a second-rate romance\r\ninspired by rococo sentimentalism. We regret to speak thus of a book by\r\nso eminent a writer as Mrs. Stowe; but when any one at this time\r\nundertakes to build up a novel out of such material as cloisters, monks,\r\nand nuns, Beato Angelico and frankincense, cavaliers and Savonarola,\r\nwith the occasional 'purple patch' of a rhyming Latin hymn--in short,\r\nwhen we see the long-exhausted melo-dramatic style, which was years ago\r\nthoroughly quizzed in 'Firmilian,' revived in the year 1862 in a work of\r\nfiction, we can not refrain from expressing sorrow that a public can\r\nstill be found to welcome such a bouquet of faded and tattered\r\nartificial flowers. There is something, indeed, almost painfully amusing\r\nin the liberal use of perfectly exhausted and thoroughly hackneyed\r\nelements of popular romance which appear in every page of _Agnes of\r\nSorrento_. A writer has said of the heroine, that 'she is one of those\r\nethereal females, only encountered in romance, who dwell on the brink of\r\nexaltation, and never eat bread and butter without seeming to fly in the\r\nface of Divine Providence.' But this feebly expresses the worn-out\r\nornamental piety of the work. It would require but very little\r\nalteration to become one of the most intensely amusing books of the age.\r\n\r\n     SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS OF THE\r\n     COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nAn interesting collection of documents, which will be read or examined\r\nwith great pleasure by all who devote their attention to the rapidly\r\nmaturing science of insurance, a science which perhaps combines in its\r\nrange of material as much of the curious and useful as any other known;\r\nthe whole tending to one great lesson: that every thing should be\r\ninsured and that _no insurance should be taxed by Government_.\r\n\r\n     TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION.\r\n     Boston: William White. 1862.\r\n\r\nApart from the vastly important testimony which these works bear to the\r\nefforts annually made in our good State in the cause of education--the\r\ngreat source, let us trust, of the politics to be--we seldom fail to\r\nfind in them many useful hints as to the practical business of teaching,\r\nof which any writer on the subject would be glad to avail himself. Many\r\nsuch, at least, we detect in the volume before us, and sincerely trust\r\nthat all will in due time bear their good fruit.\r\n\r\n     CONCORD FIGHT. By S. R. BARTLETT. Second edition.\r\n     Concord: Albert Tracy. Boston: Crosby, Nichols & Co. 1862.\r\n\r\nA poem of thirty-two pages, devoted to setting forth the incidents of\r\nConcord and Lexington fights, in the Revolutionary days, and therefore\r\nvery appropriate to our own time. The 'plan' is excellent; the incidents\r\nwell devised, while many little lyrical touches here and there are truly\r\nadmirable. For instance, 'The White Cockade.'\r\n\r\n  'Firm hearts and true, strong bands to do,\r\n      For liberty;\r\n  The fierce old strain rings once again:\r\n      'Come death or victory!'\r\n\r\n  'The lips that woke the dawning note\r\n      Are passed away;\r\n  But the _echoes_ of the 'White Cockade'\r\n      Ring round our hills to-day.'\r\n\r\nLong may they ring, and long may the descendants of the men of '76 prove\r\nthat they still hear in spirit 'the dawning notes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English journals and statesmen, in their excessive anxiety to\r\nregulate every thing for the world in general and for America in\r\nparticular, quite lose sight of the fact, that before interfering in a\r\nneighbor's affairs, it is best to know what the state of affairs may\r\nreally be. Of late, we have seen these makers of public opinion making\r\nmischief through gross ignorance, to a degree well-nigh unparalleled in\r\nhistory. On the strength of flying rumors, unfinished events imperfectly\r\nreported, and through Secession slanders, their great leaders, both\r\nrepresentative and editorial, have ventured to spread before the masses\r\nstatements which must unavoidably tend to greatly exasperate and\r\nalienate the people of our respective nations. They are blindly running\r\nup scores of hatred, which at some day may call for fearful settlement.\r\nTheir influence is very great on the rank-loving multitude in their own\r\ncountry--a multitude which, after all, is, in the majority, more\r\nmiserable and nearly as ignorant as that of any realm in Europe, or even\r\nthe East, for there are fewer paupers in Turkey or Syria than in wealthy\r\nEngland. Yet, quite unheeding this, they continue to express sympathy\r\nfor the South, declare with Brougham that the bubble of Democracy has at\r\nlength burst, and chuckle over every Northern defeat. All of which shall\r\nbe duly remembered.\r\n\r\nThe grossest error into which these men have fallen, is that of\r\ncontinually regarding our war not as a struggle between two great\r\nprinciples, or as an unavoidable necessity, but simply as a strife\r\nbetween two factions. Nearly every London editorial which we have seen\r\nfor weeks proves this. 'What will the North gain if it conquers the\r\nSouth? What will the South make? What are WE to benefit by a\r\nvictory of either?' It is perfectly natural, however, for a monarchy,\r\nvirtually without 'politics,' devoid of great progressive ideas, and\r\nsmothered by 'loyalty' and faith in an aristocracy, to see, as men did\r\nin the middle ages, nothing but a dispute of rival forces in every\r\nbattle. It is 'Brown _vs_. Brown' to them, and nothing more. With the\r\nexception of Bright and his friends, no one in England seems to\r\ncomprehend that our North has in itself the vital, progressive energy\r\nwhich _must_ give it victory--the same spirit which enables English\r\ncivilization to gain on the Hindoo or the New-Zealander--the spirit of\r\nscience and intelligence, which conquers ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe fact that English statesmen can talk so calmly of the possibilities\r\nof Southern victory, and weigh with such equanimity the claims of the\r\ncombatants, simply proves their ignorance of the real condition of the\r\nUnited States. And they _are_ indeed very ignorant of us. Perhaps\r\nignorance and thoughtlessness were never more decidedly manifested than\r\nin Brougham's late rhodomontade on the failure of Democracy in this\r\ncountry. For, in fact, there is not difference enough between the\r\nrepresentative _power_ of England and that of America to make a\r\nquestion. Between Commons and our House of Representatives--the most\r\ninfluential legislative bodies--there is no such great difference.\r\nEnglish writers have asserted that our government is actually the\r\nstrongest monarchy of the two, because our President possesses far\r\ngreater power of patronage and personal influence than the Queen. The\r\nreal difference is not between the forms of government, but between the\r\ninnate flunkeyism of the Briton and the independence of the American.\r\nIf we had the British government in every detail, and if John Bull were\r\nto adopt our system, the countries would stand where they were, and each\r\ngradually 'reform' itself, according to its ideas of reform, back into\r\nthe old routine. The Englishman, needing 'my Lord' and 'Her Gracious\r\nMajesty,' and as unable to live without his golden calves of 'superiors'\r\nas bees are to exist without a queen, would soon create them; while the\r\nAmerican blood, sprung from the republican Puritan, and developed into\r\nstrength on a continent, would very soon, after a nine days' féte to his\r\nnew fétish, kick it over, and instituting caucuses and primary\r\nward-meetings, or 'town-meetings,' (a ceremony which no European in\r\nexistence, save the Russian, is capable of properly managing,) would\r\nsoon have all back again in the old road.\r\n\r\nDemocracy among the 'Yankees' as well as all North-Americans who are\r\nfree from a servile respect for simple rank and money, is something very\r\ndifferent from that mere form which Brougham, and with him nearly all\r\nEurope, believe it to be. We are not Frenchmen, or Englishmen, or\r\nOrientals, to quietly sit down under any kind of government which chance\r\nmay impose, and exclaim: 'It is fate.' Democracy with us is not the mere\r\nform which they imagine. It is, like the English government, like the\r\nGerman, like the Pachalik of the Oriental, something as much a part of\r\nus as our national physiognomy. A very great proportion of the\r\nEnglishmen who come here, remain flunkeys to the end--an American, other\r\nthan a soul-diseased disciple of Richmond sociology, or some weak\r\nbrother or sister dazed by court ball-tickets--quite as generally remain\r\na despiser of men who acknowledge other men as their betters by mere\r\nbirth. A love of freedom is in our blood, in our life, in our habits. We\r\nare fond, it is true, of temporarily lionizing great people, but we soon\r\nreduce them to our own level. America has shaken down more eminencies\r\ninto notorieties than any other country in the world--it is a severe and\r\nterrible ordeal for great foreigners. Our eagerness to behold them is\r\nsimply a keen curiosity and a natural love of amusement which is soon\r\nappeased. An American would crowd foremost to see Queen Victoria for the\r\nfirst time in his life--the second opportunity would be neglected. But\r\nthe London shop-keeper who has seen that lady perhaps hundreds of times,\r\nstill rushes out in wild haste, with eyes wide open, to behold her when\r\nshe drives past. 'They can never get enough of it.' As one of their own\r\nwriters has observed, a London tradesman may have been swindled a\r\nhundred times by real or sham noblemen, and yet no sooner does some\r\nflaunting cheat with the _air noble_ enter his shop, than the cockney\r\nbows low and implores patronage with a cringing zeal only equaled by his\r\n'uppishness' to humbler customers.\r\n\r\nThe truth simply is, that English thinkers wrongly judge our people to\r\nbe like their own, and as capable of promptly submitting to acknowledged\r\nsuperiors. In the same blindness and ignorance, they see only two\r\nparties, equal in all respects in this war, and realize nothing of the\r\ninnate vitality and irresistibly accretive power of free-labor, science,\r\nand progress, when brought into opposition with a conservatism which\r\nscorns every thing pertaining to the rights of the majority. Misled by\r\ntheir associations, they believe that the 'Aristocratic' party must\r\ntriumph in the end, forgetting that even in their own country capital is\r\ngradually destroying the old land-marks which divided the privileged\r\nclasses from the masses. We who virtually occupy a higher stand-point in\r\nhistory, though, perhaps, we are newer dwellers in our domain and not as\r\nyet as comfortable in it as they in theirs, can, however, afford to\r\nlaugh at their opinions and threats. A nation, whose utmost effort could\r\nnot raise above thirty thousand men for a war in which the point of\r\nhonor between themselves and the French was at stake, is not the one to\r\nlay down laws to the American North, which could--probably without\r\ndrafting--bring its million into the field. It is worth remembering\r\nthat, had they sent us their Warrior, as they threatened after the Mason\r\nand Slidell difficulty, she would have met with the Monitor!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree hundred thousand men are wanted--and that right early!\r\n\r\nLet there be meetings, speeches, subscriptions--let every thing that is\r\nvigorous and impulsive and patriotic thrill the people forthwith: Let\r\nthere be no lagging in the good cause. Never since the war begun was\r\nthere a time when a fierce rally was more needed. We have it in our\r\npower to crush this rebellion to atoms, if the people will but once\r\narouse in their might. Even this draft for three hundred thousand, when\r\nwe come to portion it off among those remaining in our counties, becomes\r\nquite trifling.\r\n\r\n'More than shooting goes to making war.' All who are in the North can\r\nfight to good purpose, if they will, every man and woman of them, _do\r\ntheir best_ to raise soldiers, equip them and take care of their\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nMen! rise up and go forth. You will acquire a patent of nobility by\r\nserving in this war, which will be worth more to you and yours in coming\r\ndays than any title on earth. You go to great risks--but not to any\r\nthing which can outweigh the good you can do for this truly holy cause.\r\nHave you lived lives 'of no great account'--_now_ is the time to rise to\r\na position--to be some body, and make your mark. Have you been a mere\r\ncipher in the great sum of life--a neglected trifle--now is the time to\r\nraise yourself to a real value. It can never be said of a man who served\r\nin this war that he was of no great account.\r\n\r\nHas your life been stained--by misfortune or your own faults? Now is the\r\ntime to wipe out the old score and begin afresh. What cautious, timid\r\nPeace rejects as bad, bold, hearty War grasps at with eagerness and\r\nmakes good and great.\r\n\r\nAre you poor, and dragging out a dull, base life, more sluggishly than\r\nyour abilities deserve? Go to the war--in God's name, go to the war! Who\r\nknows what changes in life you may live through--what new opportunities\r\nmay open before you! In that wide Southland lie a million homes, and\r\nthere will be those left behind who--if you fight bravely--will give the\r\nmatter no rest till you are richly rewarded. There is not a soldier in\r\nthis war at this instant who is not acquiring what may be a fortune.\r\n_Somebody_ must occupy the lands left vacant in the South!\r\n\r\nAre you a lover? Make her proud of you.\r\n\r\nDo not fear the risks. That is a poor, wretched life which has never run\r\nthe chances of death.\r\n\r\n  'Fast in battle the bullets fly,\r\n  But many a soldier the bullets pass by.'\r\n\r\nArise all! Up, Guards, and at 'em! Let there be a general up-stirring\r\nand a hearty good-will in this matter. The enemy have brought every\r\nwhite man among them into the field--they are kept alive solely by the\r\nblacks. One tremendous effort, such as we are capable of making, would\r\nsweep them from the face of the earth. Another struggle and we reach the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany years ago, the South began to alienate itself from the Union, by\r\nblindly abusing every thing pertaining to the North as 'Abolition.' They\r\nwanted a grievance; they would have one, and so yelled 'Wolf! wolf!'\r\ntill the wolf came in roaring earnest. In like manner, the Democratic\r\ndabblers in mischief are now yelling 'Radical,' abusing emancipation,\r\nand doing all in their power to hoist themselves into notoriety. They\r\nare determined to force separate parties into existence, and they will\r\nend by accomplishing their purpose, by being in a losing reactionary\r\nminority, which will bear the brand in later days of having been the\r\nmost unprincipled, narrow-minded, and desperately selfish faction which\r\nthis country has ever known.\r\n\r\nGentle reader, accept the following from a friend in the quaint spirit\r\nin which it is written, and understand not by bad company aught that is\r\nevil--for if we read the word of the enigma, the 'bad' among her\r\n'friends of the future' is indeed goodness-that saving salt which is\r\noften found among many who are too hastily banned as lost in the world.\r\nSo, we pray you, judge it kindly:\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDS OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n'There is no real amusement except in bad company.'--_Italian Proverb_.\r\n\r\n\r\nReprehensible but real sentiment of your humble servant, O dearly\r\nbeloved reader! Your lips reprove me, but your heart forgives and\r\nsympathizes! And that heart rebels with mine against that adverse Past\r\nwhich has given to us so little of 'real amusement' from 'bad company,'\r\nand demands, like mine, reparation from the Future for the sufferings we\r\nhave endured from unexceptionable and perfectly good company!\r\n\r\nThe representative men and women of that small and select bad company,\r\n(who have made the desert of our lives to blossom with roses, violets,\r\nstrawberries and cream,) how distinctly they stand out on the horizon of\r\nmemory! I see them--I count them, as easily as those few stately pines\r\non yonder hill-top--one, two, three, four, five, six, _seven_. No more?\r\nWhat! not a delightful eight? Who has translated the murmur of the\r\nsummer wind among the pines as 'No more?' '_No more?_' Alas! to-day they\r\ngive that answer to me, as I seek for one other in that bad and beloved\r\ncompany! 'But he cometh'--_adveniat_--he cometh in the future. O eighth!\r\nyour morning will yet dawn.\r\n\r\nWelcome, O Friend of the Future I whatever thy sex. Welcome! whether in\r\ncashmere and graceful crinolineaments, or in gray-suit and\r\n_grecio_!--only be 'more of the same sort.' Heaven is _not_ so cruel! to\r\ngive us five hundred dear twin-friends, on whom one has to tie five\r\nhundred different colored bows (I assure you, Monsieur, the\r\nribbon-florists have this season produced _five hundred colors_) in\r\norder to distinguish one from another! Heaven would not do this cruel\r\nwrong without offering some apology--some mitigation.\r\n\r\nAh! you sigh. Your heart, then, _does_ forgive me--I knew it would. Give\r\nme your hand, (such a soft, white hand!) I confess the proverb did\r\n_sound_ a little naughty, but it's not _really_ so. At all events, it is\r\nthe _truth_--and, you know, we\r\n\r\n  'Can not tell a lie!' G. W.\r\n\r\nAh! this hand, though soft and white, is no longer plump and\r\nunconscious; it has _suffered_! You, too, have been bored--ah! I _must_\r\nkiss it.\r\n\r\n  'I, too, am human.'\r\n\r\nI also have been bored! Come, now, you mistrust me no longer-and I--I\r\nlove you! I _love_ you, and, therefore, I want to amuse you; perhaps, by\r\nHeaven's blessing, I may prove 'bad company' myself!\r\n\r\nFor I can not but believe that somewhere in the purple Future, or latent\r\namid the green leaves of the possible Fairy-dom, (in which some rich\r\nenchanter of an uncle is to lea-re us all an heritage,) there bide,\r\nwaitingly, certain dear friends--delightful, daring, witty, and wicked\r\ncreatures--like yourself, O reader I--with whom I am destined to be,\r\nspiritually, 'very much married indeed;' or if the expression sound too\r\npolygamatical, let me simply say _lié._ [For Heaven's sake, accept that\r\nas French, warm with an accent, and not as English, cold without one.]\r\n_Lié_ means 'bound'--anchored, so to speak, to an intimate in an\r\namicable manner. And it is in their friendship--in their kind and tender\r\nwords and courteous deeds, and winsome ways, that I most truly _live_.\r\n\r\nWhere these dearmost ones may bide, I know not. Seven--yes--seven I have\r\nmet, whom I cherish like diamonds of delight in the cotton of memory. It\r\nis worth noting, my dear, in this connection, that _sev-en_ is one of\r\nthe conjugations in Turkish of the root _sev_, or 'loving,' and 'them\r\nold Turks,' you know--but I am digressing. Are there not still to come\r\nseven--yea, seventy times seven, (I have mislaid my Koran, in which the\r\nnumber is more accurately stated,) of my Friends of the Future!\r\n\r\nBut I know what they are like. Oh! the charming, delightful wretches,\r\nhow I enjoy looking at them--in fact, 'I admire to see' them--as they\r\nsweep along through the golden halls of my Schloss Dream-berg. Such nice\r\nclothes as they wear--the ducks! Such good things as they\r\nsay--such--such--\r\n\r\nIt is too warm to-day to attempt superlatives. It were better to\r\ndrink--say, iced lemonade, in which--for you, dear reader--by some\r\nmistake a _little_ sherry has been cobblered. _Sherrare est humanum_.\r\nThe Rabbis, we are told, forbade the children of Israel to puff the fire\r\non the Sabbath with bellows, though they might keep it going by blowing\r\nthrough a straw. Wherefore, to this day, certain of the devout 'keep it\r\na-going' by means of a straw--only by some strange mistake in\r\ninterpretation, or by some vowel-points getting mislaid, they, instead\r\nof blowing _from_ them in the straw, suck _toward_ them. And their\r\n'society' is a large one.\r\n\r\nBut we were talking of 'good company,' as they say in 'good\r\nsociety'--not of 'good society,' as they say in 'good company.' And,\r\ntherefore, although _not_ 'a retired clergyman,' and devoutly hoping\r\nthat my 'sands of life' are not by a very long while 'run out,' (for I\r\nwant to see my future friends,) I would yet (without these advantages)\r\noffer you 'some slight relief,' and would seek to assuage your\r\nsufferings resulting from too much good company; and since we have so\r\nfew friends in the past who have amused us, turn we our 'regards' to the\r\npossible\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDS OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\nFirst among whom is\r\n\r\nBAGNOLE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Face such as would-be Byron youths all crave,\r\n  Impenetrable, gloomy as the grave;\r\n  Voice, a 'French-gray,' the promise of the face,\r\n  You'd swear he thought to _laugh_, a deep disgrace.\r\n  Behold the mask of a bacchantine soul,\r\n  Drinking deep draughts from life's enchanting bowl.\r\n  Whether the bowl be from Cellini's hand.\r\n  If rude, still crowning it with Fancy's flowers,\r\n  Laughing at Time, and flirting with her Hours.\r\n  He is not pious, and to church won't go;\r\n  He says he _can't_--'tis so extremely slow.'\r\n  Bagnolè! with the 'goats' you're set apart'\r\n  And yet, how _can_ we wish a 'change of heart'\r\n  In one like thee--great-minded, brave, and true!\r\n  Ah! _what_ a world, if all were such as you!\r\n  But I forget--he's tender to the weak:\r\n  To the sad Magdalene he'll kindly speak\r\n  Words of _pure gold_--not that base metal thing\r\n  Which falls like lead and gives no friendly ring;\r\n  Opening the wound, to see if it is deep,\r\n  Arousing thought, to see if' tis asleep!\r\n  'Tendir and treue,' us Douglas was of old,\r\n  How far _they_ see, who call thee 'tame and cold'!\r\n  Tame! as a tiger: cold! as hot as flame!\r\n  _Where_ does he board, and what, oh! _what's_ his name?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL'INCONNUE.\r\n\r\n  Dark Passion-flower, with keen mimosa-leaves,\r\n  Into my life your fate her shuttle weaves.\r\n  How long those wistful eyes have haunted mine--\r\n  Brown eyes of earth--they have no light divine.\r\n  Brown eyes! ye fill my soul with burning love--\r\n  No Pantheon soul--lighted from above!\r\n  O sister mine! you'll come to me at last--\r\n  _That_ shall atone for all our weary past.\r\n  So pure thou art, with soul so joyous, _free_.\r\n  The world could not forgive--and hated thee!\r\n  To be 'unlike the world,' is thy dark sin.\r\n  You or 'the world'? the 'you' my heart shall win.\r\n  Within that shrine, so delicately fair,\r\n  Burns a bright spirit which 'a world' can dare;\r\n  She mocks 'the world,' but she would _die_ for _me_.\r\n  Her heart is fathomed by eternity;\r\n  And yet she's always 'in the fashion' dressed,\r\n  And 'wants a cashmere,' (she to me confessed.)\r\n  Oh! you can see her, almost any day,\r\n  Hat of pale violet, dress of silver-gray.\r\n  She goes to parties and the 'Music-Hall;'\r\n  She eats her dinner, and she gives a ball.\r\n  You nod and smile: '_We know her now--we see_!'\r\n  Perhaps! Alas! she's _quite_ _un_known to me!\r\n\r\nMARIE.\r\n\r\n  How can I tell you if her face be fair,\r\n  While the gay sunshine of her smile is there?\r\n  How can I tell you of a brilliant mind,\r\n  When every word she speaks is angel-kind?\r\n  Need I describe her voice, so melting sweet?\r\n  Or the small mouth, which is its passage meet!\r\n  I only know, while for her voice I wait,\r\n  I see fair pearls behind that rosy gate.\r\n  But when she speaks, her diamond-wit's so bright,\r\n  All other beauties vanish from our sight.\r\n  No need for _her_ to fear 'the world's rebuff!\r\n  Too much of Marie's always just enough I\r\n  She is 'bad company,' yet e'en 'the good'\r\n  Can find no flaw in her fair maidenhood.\r\n  The saints don't doubt that she is in _their_ fold--\r\n  It makes me laugh to think how they are 'sold.'\r\n  _Nice_, _naughty_ folks are _sure_, she's of _their_ creed,\r\n  Yet she's no hypocrite, in word or deed.\r\n  What _is_ she, then--this gem without a flaw?\r\n  She is--she is--a maid-en made of 'straw'!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReader, have you in your house a _vivarium_ or _aquarium_, or any other\r\nvariety of animal curiosity-shop, under care of the younger members? If\r\nso, the subjoined sketch may awaken in your mind more than one vivid\r\nsouvenir, We know, at all events, that some of its 'features' were\r\nfounded on facts; that is, if a 'feature' can be 'founded.' However, we\r\ntake the phrase from--but no, we are sufficiently abused by the\r\nDemocratic editors, as it is.\r\n\r\nEDITOR OF THE CONTINENTAL: Among the lesser joys of maternity,\r\nthat of having your children interested in a vivarium is one of the\r\nleast--in fact, it is an elephantine sorrow.\r\n\r\nJames, my eldest son, is a genius; before he was twelve years old, he\r\ninvented a rat-trap, which not only caught rats, but cut off their tails\r\nand--let them go. At thirteen, he spoke Italian so fluently that he\r\ncaused a hand-organ grinder to throw a brick at him. At fourteen, he\r\ncame home one day with six large panes of glass, some tin and putty, and\r\nmade a vivarium, a thing full of mud, water, leeches, dirty weeds, and\r\nother improvements.\r\n\r\nWhen James had finished his glass case, he placed it in the front\r\ndrawing-room window, so that the public might behold that exquisite\r\nprocess of nature, tadpoles turning into spring water-chickens, as they\r\ncall frogs on hotel bill of fares. Unfortunately, the gold fish he put\r\nin with them killed the tadpoles while they still wiggled, and a\r\npickerel that he had bought of a fellow-school-boy for half-price, its\r\ntail being ragged, ate up the gold-fish.\r\n\r\nIf at any time vegetables bought for the table were missing, we all knew\r\nwhere they went to; in fact, that vivarium, from the time green peas\r\ncame until cabbages were ripe, resembled a _soupe à la Jardinière_, and\r\nin summer-time a second course of boiled fish might easily have been\r\nfound there.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when I had a little company, and while Fanny Schell was\r\nsinging an aria, he caused her to conclude with an unusually high\r\nscream, by announcing at the top of his voice, while he pointed to the\r\nvivarium:\r\n\r\n  'Ma, the leeches have all crawled out!'\r\n\r\nImagine the feelings my little company had the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the fright James gave me one hot night in July; it\r\nwas Saturday, I remember well, for that was one of my son's holidays,\r\nand he returned home toward night unusually covered with mud, from a\r\nlong walk in the country, evidently having been taking practical lessons\r\nin ditching. He was so very quiet after he returned, that I might have\r\nknown he was in mischief. However, when his bed-time came, he kissed me\r\ngood-night, and said:\r\n\r\n'O ma! I have such a surprise for you in the morning.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I had the surprise that night. Business called my husband\r\naway from the city that morning, and I was alone. Waking up from a sound\r\nsleep about midnight, I distinctly heard somebody working on an anvil,\r\nlike a blacksmith, 'ching-a-ling! ching-a-ling!' It evidently came from\r\nthe drawing-room, and my fears at once told me it was a thief trying to\r\nbreak into the house. Next I heard some one whistle, like a man calling\r\na dog, 'wheh! wheh! wheh!' Finally a dog barking, 'woo, woo, wooh!'\r\nThoroughly alarmed, I sprang to the front-window, and called: 'Police!\r\nthieves!' until I managed to arouse the neighbors. I had the key of the\r\nfront-door in my chamber; this I threw down to a police-officer, and in\r\ncompany with two others he boldly entered the house, lit the gas, and\r\nfound--that vivarium full of bull-frogs!\r\n\r\nMy son banished the frogs and introduced cat-fish, (or, as they call\r\nthem in Boston, 'horn-pouts.') One night, my great Angora cat, a cat\r\nborn in the Rue de Seine, educated in the best French _École des\r\nchattes_, and brought to this country by my husband, fell a victim to\r\n_la gourmandise_, by falling into the vivarium while fishing for\r\ncat--horn-pout--fish. James found her there in the morning, drowned,\r\nand partially eaten up by those she had hoped to eat. She went into the\r\n_boudoir_ to Pout, and 'had done it.'\r\n\r\nThat finished the vivarium. I sincerely hope these trials to mothers\r\nwill never again become the rage, and that something dry will next tempt\r\nour children's mania for home amusements.

At Washington, all the timid, time-serving, and place-hoping\r\nmembers of Congress have been holding 'Conservative' meetings, at which\r\nthe most insolent or timid propositions have been put forth; some of the\r\ntraitors manifesting clear as day their undisguised sympathy for the\r\nrebels, others speaking only to preserve their tattered characters as\r\nUnionists. The upshot of all was given in a resolution that Congress has\r\nno power to deprive a person of his property, unless that person has\r\nbeen duly convicted by a trial by jury.\r\n\r\nWe are not through the war as yet. Possibly, ere the end come, the\r\ncountry may have something to say as to the propriety of our\r\nrepresentatives holding meetings to protect and favor rebels in their\r\n'rights.'\r\n\r\nWHAT'S in a name? There was a great puzzle once in _one_ name,\r\nas appeareth from the following:\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR: In a certain village not unknown to you,\r\n     dwelleth one Alwright.\r\n\r\n     It is a good thing to have a good name. His, you observe, is\r\n     'petter as goot.'\r\n\r\n     Not long ago, A. went to an auction and bought things.\r\n\r\n     'What name, sir?' inquired the man with the hammer.\r\n\r\n     'Alwright.'\r\n\r\n     'What NAME, I say?' was the irritated reply.\r\n\r\n     'ALWRIGHT, I say.'\r\n\r\n     'All wrong, you mean. 'Spect you'll make it all right in the\r\n     morning, hey?'\r\n\r\n     'AL-WRIGHT!' cried the purchaser.\r\n\r\n     'Yes, all right!' cried the crowd, taking the joke. 'All right-go\r\n     ahead, old knock 'em down.'\r\n\r\n     The auctioneer began to be profane.\r\n\r\n     'A-L, Al,' began Alwright.\r\n\r\n     'Hold your tongue! Go----' continued the auctioneer.\r\n\r\n     'A-L Al, W-R-I-G-H-T wright,' continued the\r\n     buyer.\r\n\r\n     'O--h, thunder!' exclaimed Hammer, on whom the laughter of the mob\r\n     began to operate. 'That's it, is it! Beg pardon. James, put this\r\n     gentleman's name down. All right, sir. Go ahead. Gentlemen, allow\r\n     me to call your attention to this fine lot of leather.

One of the queerest ever reported\r\nto us was held in a French-Spanish be-Germanized village on the\r\nfrontier, where business was transacted in something of a polyglott\r\nmanner, as follows:\r\n\r\n     'Gentlemen-Messieurs-Senores y meine Herrne, I've got here for\r\n     sale--a vender--a vendre zum verkaufen eine Schöne Büchse a\r\n     first-rate rifle un fusil sans pareil, muy hermosa!

We find in it a brave ring of true poetry:\r\n\r\n\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n  'Oh! dark and true and tender is the North.'\r\n\r\n  Loud leaps the strong wind forth,\r\n  Fierce from the caves of the mighty North,\r\n          Ages untold,\r\n          O'er town and wold,\r\n  That rest 'neath a softer sky,\r\n  Swept that blast in anger by,\r\n  And in his wrathful eddies bore\r\n  The fiery song of Odin and Thor.\r\n      Then little avail,\r\n        'Gainst the Vi-king's arm,\r\n      The maiden's tear, the warrior's mail,\r\n        Or the priestman's charm.\r\n  And o'er the bright South-land\r\n    A shadow of dread was the North wind's course,\r\n  Whene'er his surging currents fanned\r\n    The raven banner of the Norse.\r\n\r\n  Years pass, and time new rays has brought,\r\n    Yet still the Northman's heart is warm;\r\n  But light on his soul a change has wrought,\r\n    And he loves the calm as he loved the storm.\r\n\r\n  Another god than the fearful Thor\r\n  In heaven's blue he saw,\r\n  And he gave to Peace his might in war--\r\n  His anger to the law.\r\n\r\n  And the strong hand holds the sickle now,\r\n    The anvil rings at morn;\r\n  And waving sunbeams tinge with gold\r\n    The hues of the ripening corn.\r\n\r\n  And the land he loves in peace has grown\r\n    To be mighty in wealth and name;\r\n  But o'er its brightness a cloud has flown,\r\n    And evil men to its councils came.\r\n\r\n  And all seemed locked in a deadly sleep,\r\n    While treason walked in her halls of state,\r\n  And good men grieve, but hopeless weep,\r\n    And the song of the scoffer is loud at the gate.\r\n\r\n  'The nation must pass away.\r\n    For the Northman's blood is cold,\r\n  And little he recks of honor or name,\r\n    If his hand may clutch the gold.\r\n\r\n  'Work treason--work your will--\r\n    Divide our Fatherland;\r\n  Hearts are craven, souls are base--\r\n    'Tis fit for the traitor's hand.\r\n\r\n  'Fear no more the Northman's rage,\r\n    The blood of the Vi-kings is old and worn;\r\n  No ancient mem'ry can stir him now,\r\n    To stand by the flag his fathers have borne.'\r\n\r\n      The words half-sung in silence fall,\r\n      Hushed in dread by a mightier call,\r\n\r\n  That stays the hand--that throbs the heart;\r\n    Cleaving the gloom, that wild war-note--\r\n  The traitor's foot is on your flag,\r\n    His bayonet at our throat.\r\n\r\n  And hark! the North-wind's sullen moan\r\n  Rises high to a sterner tone,\r\n  That sinks away, then bursts anew\r\n  In joy, as 'mid its surges grew\r\n  The shout, the stroke, the cannon's peal,\r\n    The tread of countless number.\r\n  For the flash of a traitor's steel\r\n    Has broken the nation's slumber;\r\n  And sighing breeze and southern gale,\r\n    Seized by the fierce wind's grasp, are torn\r\n  From gentle haunt by hill or dale,\r\n  And in the whirling vortex borne.\r\n  There murm'ring on his hollow breast,\r\n  And wond'ring at his wild unrest,\r\n  Their shrieking echoes sounding far,\r\n  Loud swelled the Northman's shout to war;\r\n  For with death's dark shadows flitting by,\r\n    And the day as dark as night,\r\n  A nation's hands are raised on high\r\n    To hold their ancient right.\r\n  And the ages are rolled from the record of time;\r\n    For the years of peace with its soft'ning beam,\r\n  That soothed in love the Northman's heart,\r\n    Are now but the mists of a warrior's dream.\r\n  And the tinsel of life is burned in the glow\r\n  That flames in his heart as in years long ago,\r\n  When Norman sea-kings swept the wave,\r\n  Who loved the night, the storm, and bloody grave.\r\n\r\n  And through all the blue of heaven's vault,\r\n    Rolls the Vala's mystic charm,\r\n  Swelled with strains of the mighty past--\r\n    Victory strikes with the Northman's arm.\r\n\r\n                                            F.\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly the old Northman is not dead among us. He lived in the iron\r\nMonitor, of the descendant of Eric, and he lives in scores of thousands\r\nof brave hearts and strong arms who came and are still coming to the\r\nbattle-call:\r\n\r\n      'Northmen, come out!\r\n  Forth into battle with storm and shout,\r\n  He who lives with victory's blest;\r\n  He who dies gains peaceful rest.\r\n  Living or dying, let us be\r\n  Still vowed to God and liberty!\r\n      Northmen, come out!'\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following poem is certainly _not_ behind the times:\r\n\r\n\r\nPAYING THE SHOT.\r\n\r\nBY J. IVES PEASE.\r\n\r\n  Yes, pay them! pay them in their chosen coin,\r\n    Bomb-shell and cannon-balls, well served and hot;\r\n  Ay, 'shell out' all the treasures of 'the mine,'\r\n    Since that's the way we've got to 'pay the shot.'\r\n\r\n  We 'owe them _one_!' and now's the time to settle,\r\n    And finish up the business to a dot;\r\n  A half a million _men_, upon their _metal_,\r\n    Accounts will soon square off, and 'pay the shot.'\r\n\r\n  We owe them one; but 'tisn't one for niggers;\r\n    Master or slave no more shall treason plot.\r\n  We've settled _that_ account with steel and triggers,\r\n    And the two millions, daily, 'pay the shot.'\r\n\r\n  We owe them one for hemp, that, coil on coil,\r\n    Judge Lynch has tendered us, in noose and knot;\r\n  We've now a sort that's grown upon free soil,\r\n    That, properly paid out, soon 'pays the shot.'\r\n\r\n  There's a snug sum due on the Sumner books;\r\n    _That_ must be paid, each tittle and each jot;\r\n  A good accountant no mistake e'er brooks,\r\n    But _strikes his balance_ fair, and 'pays the shot.'\r\n\r\n  There's some old 'scores,' on tar-and-feather martyrs,\r\n    We've now the 'devil to pay,' the 'pitch all hot;'\r\n  In every Jack-tar, Jeff now finds a Tar-tar,\r\n    Bound to 'pitch in,' and bound to 'pay the shot.'\r\n\r\n  So, onward, mudsills! fanatics! vandals! vipers!\r\n    Wipe out this treason _now_, nor leave one blot;\r\n  When Dixie dances, Dixie must 'pay the piper;'\r\n    Enough for 'U.

In\r\nthe mean time, she has done all in her power to induce her lover to go\r\nand fight the battles of his country; so far unsuccessfully, since Mr.\r\nJohn G---- deems it his duty to stay at home and keep things steady,\r\nespecially billiards, which, as we all know, is an erratic game,\r\nrequiring great watching.\r\n\r\nThe other evening, Miss H----, while assisting at a sociable at Madame\r\nV----'s, was asked to sing. Seated at the piano, to the horror of\r\nexpectant hearers of classic music, she began, with loudest voice, to\r\nsing:\r\n\r\n  'I'll trace these gardins o'er and o'er,\r\n  A med-i-tating on atche swate flowir,\r\n  A thinking on each bewcheous hour;\r\n  Oh! Johnny is gone for a sol-di-er.'\r\n\r\nShe then put her handkerchief to her eyes, pretended to sob bitterly,\r\narose from the piano-stool, and sought an arm-chair.\r\n\r\nSolicited by her confidential friend, Miss Belrose, to confide her\r\naffliction, she only answered:\r\n\r\n'Oh! my Johnny G----'s gone for a soldier--to play billiards with him!\r\nAnd--and I know that that fast Lieutenant Gamble will keep him there for\r\nhours and hours.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYoung gentlemen, this is the time for bullets and not for balls; for\r\ncannons and not caroms; for rifle-pits to hole yourselves in, and not\r\nfor 'pockets' wherein to hole your adversary. _Apropos_ of which, listen\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRONG KIND OF A BAND.\r\n\r\nColonel X---- raised a regiment in the Ri-too-lal Rural districts of\r\nNew-Jersey, including a by no means bad brass band.\r\n\r\nArrived in Washington with his force, he was unfortunate enough to meet\r\nwith a wag, who at once told him he was afraid that he, the Colonel,\r\nwould meet or rather come to grief shortly.\r\n\r\n'How so?' asked Colonel X---- excitedly.\r\n\r\n'H'm!' answered the wag, 'don't you see that those rural musicians of\r\nyours will be regarded as country-band of war?'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel saw it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDo our readers remember a beautiful poem on Gottschalk's playing--_Los\r\nojos Criollos_--which appeared some time since in the _Home Journal_?\r\nThey will not regret to see a lyric in our pages by the writer of the\r\nfirst referred to:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD SURGEON'S STORY.\r\n\r\nBY ELEANOR C. DONELLY.\r\n\r\n  'Twas in a Southern hospital, a week ago or more,\r\n  (God save us! how the days drag on, these weary times of war!)\r\n  They brought me, in the sultry noon, a youth whom they had found\r\n  Deserted by his regiment upon the battle-ground,\r\n  And bleeding his young life away through many a gaping wound.\r\n\r\n  'Dark-haired and slender as a girl, a handsome lad was he,\r\n  Despite the pallor of his wounds, each one an agony.\r\n  A ball had carried off his arm, and zig-zag passage frayed\r\n  Into his chest--so wild a rent that, when it was displayed,\r\n  I, veteran surgeon that I was, turned white as any maid.\r\n\r\n  ''There is no hope?' he slowly said, noting my changing cheek;\r\n  I only shook my head: I dare not trust myself to speak;\r\n  But in that wordless negative, the boy had read his doom,\r\n  And turned about, as best he could, and lay in silent gloom,\r\n  Watching the summer sunlight make a glory of the room.\r\n\r\n  ''My little hero!' said a voice, and then a woman's hand\r\n  Lay like a lily on his curls: 'God give you self-command!'\r\n  'Mother!'--how full that thrilling word of pity and alarm--\r\n  'You here? my sweetest mother here?' and with his one poor arm\r\n  He got about her neck and drew her down with kisses warm.\r\n\r\n  ''All the long, sultry night, when out--'(He shuddered as he said)--\r\n  'On yonder field I lay among the festering heaps of dead;\r\n  With awful faces close to mine, and clots of bloody hair,\r\n  And dead eyes gleaming through the dusk with such a rigid stare;\r\n  Through all my pain, O mother mine! I only prayed one prayer.\r\n\r\n  ''Through all my pain--(and ne'er I knew what suffering was before!)--\r\n  I only prayed to see your face, to hear your voice once more;\r\n  The cold moon shone into my eyes--my prayer seemed all in vain.'\r\n  'My poor deluded boy!' she sobbed; her mother-fount of pain\r\n  O'erflowing down her gentle cheeks in drops like thunder-rain.\r\n\r\n  ''Accursed be he whose cruel hand has wrought my son such ill!'\r\n  The boy sprang upright at the word, and shrieked aloud, 'Be still!\r\n  You know not what you say. O God! how shall I tell the tale!\r\n  How shall I smite her as she stands!' and with a moaning wail\r\n  He prone among the pillows dropped, his visage ashen pale.\r\n\r\n  ''It was a bloody field,' he said, at last, like one who dozed;\r\n  'I know not how the day began--I know not how it closed;\r\n  I only know we fought like fiends, begrimed with blood and dust,\r\n  And did our duty to a man, as every soldier must,\r\n  And gave the rebels ball for ball, and paid them thrust for thrust.\r\n\r\n  'But when our gallant General rode up and down the line,\r\n  The sunlight striking on his sword until it flashed like wine,\r\n  And cried aloud (God bless his lips!) with such a cheery laugh,\r\n  'Charge bayonets, boys! Pitch into them, and scatter them like chaff!'\r\n  One half our men were drunk with blood, and mad the other half.\r\n\r\n  ''My veins ran fire. O Heaven! hide the horrors of that plain!\r\n  We charged upon the rebel ranks and cut them down like grain.\r\n  One bright-haired man ran on my steel--I pierced him through and through;\r\n  The blood upspirted from his wound and sprinkled me like dew.\r\n  'Twas strange, but as I looked I thought of Cain and him he slew.\r\n\r\n  ''Some impulse moved me to kneel down and touch him where he fell,\r\n  I turned him o'er--I saw his face--the sight was worse than hell!\r\n  _There lay my brother_--Curse me not!--pierced by _my_ bayonet!'\r\n  O Christ! the pathos of that cry I never shall forget--\r\n  Men turned away to hide their tears, for every eye was wet.\r\n\r\n  'And the hard-featured woman-nurse, a sturdy wench was she,\r\n  Dropped down among us, in a swoon, from very sympathy.\r\n  'I saw his face, the same dear face which once (would we had died\r\n  In those old days of innocence!) was ever by my side,\r\n  At bed or board, at school or play, so fresh and merry-eyed!\r\n\r\n  ''And now to see it white and set--to know the deed was mine!\r\n  A madness seized me as I knelt, accursed in God's sunshine.\r\n  I did not heed the balls which fell around us thick as rain,\r\n  I did not know my arm was gone;\r\n  I felt nor wound nor pain,\r\n  I only stooped and kissed those lips which ne'er would speak again.\r\n\r\n  ''O Louis!' (and the lad looked up and brushed a tear aside,)\r\n  'O Louis! brother of my soul! my boyhood's fearless guide!\r\n  By the bright heaven where thou stand'st--by thy big-hearted faith--\r\n  By these the tears our mother sheds--by this my failing breath--\r\n  Forgive me for that murd'rous thrust which wounded thee to death.\r\n\r\n  ''Forgive me! I would yield my life to give thee thine, my brother!\r\n  What's this? Don't shut the sunlight out; I can not see my mother.\r\n  The air blows sweet from yonder field!\r\n  Dear Lou, put up your sword.\r\n  Let's weave a little daisy-chain\r\n  upon this pleasant sward--'\r\n  And with a smile upon his mouth, the boy slept in the Lord.'\r\n\r\nSuch are the tragedies of civil war, the fearful probability of such\r\nevents. But who has not heard of families with sons in either army,\r\nespecially on the border, in Philadelphia, and Baltimore? We have heard\r\n_seven_ such instances enumerated by one lady of the former city.

Many a poor fellow has\r\nblessed them for their contributions to alleviate his pain and make the\r\nold hospital comfortable for him. In the congregation, one elderly\r\nmaiden lady, who had so far given nothing, was called on by one of her\r\nenergetic sisters in the church, and implored to do something for the\r\npoor soldiers. She was told that any thing that would render their\r\nsufferings less would be gratefully received.\r\n\r\nShe promised to send a donation. Nothing more was heard from her for a\r\ncouple of weeks, when one morning the ladies assembled in the\r\nvestry-room of the church received a large basket from the elderly\r\nmaiden lady. On opening it, they found three dozen starched muslin,\r\nnight-cape, with frills all round them, bows and long strings.\r\n\r\n'Did you ever?' asked Miss G----. 'I declare Miss---- has set her Caps\r\nfor the soldiers in earnest this time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe select the following as the best proposed completion of the\r\nunfinished poem by Fitz-James O'Brien, published in our July number:\r\n\r\n     _Detroit, Mich., June 22d, 1862._\r\n\r\n     EDITORS OF CONTINENTAL: As you do not give the conclusion\r\n     of that 'Watching the Stag,' I propose to finish it in this wise:\r\n\r\n  'Watching my face with half-closed eyes,'\r\n  As I lean my head on the dappled stag\r\n  That stiffens beneath a windward crag.\r\n\r\n  His flanks are black with the hardened sweat,\r\n  And a film has clouded his eye of jet;\r\n  While a round, red wound that oozes still,'\r\n  Tells of his fate and my marksman's skill.\r\n\r\n  Oh! the granite crags shall no longer feel\r\n  His fleet hoofs ringing like steel on steel,\r\n  And shepherd shall never again espy\r\n  His antlers painted against the sky!\r\n\r\n  The mountain tarn, so lone and cold,\r\n  The delicate shadow no more shall hold;\r\n  The fleetness has died in each rigid limb,\r\n  And never shall dun hound follow him!\r\n\r\n  Stanch Hela blinks as she half recalls\r\n  That savage chase through the mountain-walls,\r\n  And growls as she dreams how her white teeth sank\r\n  With a thirsty grip in his shuddering flank.\r\n\r\n  Dream on, good dog! through the night so chill,\r\n  Till sunrise surges over the hill,\r\n  Till the heather glows and the peaks are gay,\r\n  And then for our mountain-home hurra!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to L.

It was started at a period when\r\nany new literary enterprise was deemed almost foolhardy, but the\r\npublisher believed that the time had arrived for just such a Magazine.\r\nFearlessly advocating the doctrine of ultimate and gradual Emancipation,\r\nfor the sake of the UNION and the WHITE MAN, it has found favor in\r\nquarters where censure was expected, and patronage where opposition only\r\nwas looked for. While holding firmly to its _own opinions_, it has\r\nopened its pages to POLITICAL WRITERS _of widely different views_, and\r\nhas made a feature of employing the literary labors of the _younger_\r\nrace of American writers. How much has been gained by thus giving,\r\npractically, the fullest freedom to the expression of opinion, and by\r\nthe infusion of fresh blood into literature, has been felt from month to\r\nmonth in its constantly increasing circulation.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of our Statesmen have furnished THE CONTINENTAL many of\r\nits political articles, and the result is, it has not given labored\r\nessays fit only for a place in ponderous encyclopedias, but fresh,\r\nvigorous, and practical contributions on men and things as they exist.\r\n\r\nIt will be our effort to go on in the path we have entered, and as a\r\nguarantee of the future, we may point to the array of live and brilliant\r\ntalent which has brought so many encomiums on our Magazine. The able\r\npolitical articles which have given it so much reputation will be\r\ncontinued in each issue, together with the new Novel by Richard B.\r\nKimball, the eminent author of the 'Under-Currents of Wall-Street,' 'St,\r\nLeger,' etc., entitled,\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\nAn account of the Life and Conduct of Hiram Meeker, one of the leading\r\nmen in the mercantile community, and 'a bright and shining light' in the\r\nChurch, recounting what he did, and how he made his money. This work\r\nexcels the previous brilliant productions of this author. In the present\r\nnumber is also commenced a new Serial by the author of 'Among the\r\nPines,' entitled,\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY,\r\n\r\nwhich will depict Southern _white_ society, and be a truthful history of\r\nsome eminent Northern merchants who are largely in 'the cotton trade and\r\nsugar line.'\r\n\r\nThe UNION--The Union of ALL THE STATES--that indicates our politics. To\r\nbe content with no ground lower than the highest--that is the standard\r\nof our literary character.\r\n\r\nWe hope all who are friendly to the spread of our political views, and\r\nall who are favorable to the diffusion of a live, fresh, and energetic\r\nliterature, will lend us their aid to increase our circulation. There is\r\nnot one of our readers who may not influence one or two more, and there\r\nis in every town in the loyal States some active person whose time might\r\nbe profitably employed in procuring subscribers to our work. To\r\nencourage such to act for us we offer the following very liberal\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,      Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,    Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,      Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,   Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,   Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\nPAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six Cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree Dollars a year, IN ADVANCE.--_Postage paid by the Publisher_.\r\n\r\nJ.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on those deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 50 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c. which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\n_The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant._\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS,\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually on the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment             $48 00\r\n  Payment in one year       48 00\r\n     \"    in two years      48 00\r\n     \"    in three years    48 00\r\n     \"    in four years    236 00\r\n     \"    in five years    224 00\r\n     \"    in six years     212 00\r\n     \"    in seven years   200 00\r\n\r\n40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment             $24 00\r\n  Payment in one year       24 00\r\n     \"    in two years      24 00\r\n     \"    in three years    24 00\r\n     \"    in four years    118 00\r\n     \"    in five years    112 00\r\n     \"    in six years     106 00\r\n     \"    in seven years   100 00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\nContinental\r\n\r\nMonthly\r\n\r\n\r\nDevoted to Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER, 1862.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEW-YORK AND BOSTON:\r\n\r\nJ.
