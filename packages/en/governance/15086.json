That task necessarily involves an\r\nhistorical as well as a constructive argument. It would be truer,\r\nperhaps, to say that the greater part of the constructive case for Home\r\nRule must necessarily be historical. To postulate a vague acceptance of\r\nthe principle of Home Rule, and to proceed at once to the details of the\r\nIrish Constitution, would be a waste of time and labour. It is\r\nimpossible even to attempt to plan the framework of a Home Rule Bill\r\nwithout a tolerably close knowledge not only of Anglo-Irish relations,\r\nbut of the Imperial history of which they form a part. The Act will\r\nsucceed exactly in so far as it gives effect to the lessons of\r\nexperience. It will fail at every point where those lessons are\r\nneglected. Constitutions which do not faithfully reflect the experience\r\nof the sovereign power which accords them, and of the peoples which have\r\nto live under them, are at the best perilous experiments liable to\r\ndefeat the end of their framers.\r\n\r\nI shall enter into history only so far as it is relevant to the\r\nconstitutional problem, using the comparative method, and confining\r\nmyself almost exclusively to the British Empire past and present. For\r\nthe purposes of the Irish controversy it is unnecessary to travel\r\nfarther. In one degree or another every one of the vexed questions which\r\nmake up the Irish problem has arisen again and again within the circle\r\nof the English-speaking races. As a nation we have a body of experience\r\napplicable to the case of Ireland incomparably greater than that\r\npossessed by any other race in the world. If, from timidity, prejudice,\r\nor sheer neglect, we fail to use it, we shall earn the heavy censure\r\nreserved for those who sin against the light.\r\n\r\nFor the comparative sketch I shall attempt, materials in the shape of\r\nfacts established beyond all controversy are abundant. Colonial history,\r\nthanks to colonial freedom, is almost wholly free from the distorting\r\ninfluence of political passion. South African history alone will need\r\nrevision in the light of recent events. When, under the alchemy of free\r\nnational institutions, Ireland has undergone the same transformation as\r\nSouth Africa, her unhappy history will be chronicled afresh with a\r\njuster sense of perspective and a juster apportionment of responsibility\r\nfor the calamities which have befallen her. And yet, if we consider the\r\nfield for partisan bias which Irish history presents, the amount of\r\nground common to writers of all shades of political opinion is now\r\nastonishingly large. The result, I think, is due mainly to the good\r\ninfluence of that eminent historian and Unionist politician, the late\r\nProfessor Lecky. Indeed, an advocate of Home Rule, nervously suspicious\r\nof tainted material, could afford to rely solely on his \"History of\r\nIreland in the Eighteenth Century,\" \"Leaders of Public Opinion in\r\nIreland,\" and \"Clerical Influences,\"[1] which are Nationalist textbooks,\r\nand, for quite recent events, on \"A Consideration of Ireland in the\r\nNineteenth Century,\" by Mr. G. Locker-Lampson, the present Unionist\r\nMember for Salisbury. A strange circumstance; but Ireland, like all\r\ncountries where political development has been forcibly arrested from\r\nwithout, is a land of unending paradox. It is only one of innumerable\r\nanomalies that Irish Nationalists should use Unionist histories as\r\npropaganda for Nationalism; that the majority of Irish Unionists should\r\ninsist on ignoring all historical traditions save those which in any\r\nnormal country would long ago have been consigned by general consent to\r\noblivion and the institutions they embody overthrown; and that Unionist\r\nwriters such as those I have mentioned should be able to reconcile their\r\nhistory and their politics only by a pessimism with regard to the\r\ntendencies of human nature in general, or of Irish nature in particular,\r\nwith which their own historical teaching, founded on a true perception\r\nof cause and effect, appears to be in direct contradiction.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the question is one of the construction, not of the\r\nverification, of facts; of prophecy for the future, rather than of bare\r\naffirmation or negation. No one can presume to determine such a question\r\nwithout a knowledge of how human beings have been accustomed to act\r\nunder similar circumstances. Illumination of that sort Irish history and\r\nthe contemporary Irish problem incontestably need. The modern case for\r\nthe Union rests mainly on the abnormality of Ireland, and that is\r\nprecisely why it is such a formidable case to meet. For Ireland in many\r\nways is painfully abnormal. The most cursory study of her institutions\r\nand social, economic, and political life demonstrate that fact. The\r\nUnionist, fixing his eyes on some of the secondary peculiarities, and\r\nignoring their fundamental cause, demonstrates it with ease, and by a\r\nhabit of mind which yields only with infinite slowness to the growth of\r\npolitical enlightenment, passes instinctively to the deduction that\r\nIrish abnormalities render Ireland unfit for self-government. In other\r\nwords, he prescribes for the disease a persistent application of the\r\nvery treatment which has engendered it. Whatever the result, there is a\r\nplausible answer. If Ireland is disorderly and retrograde, how can she\r\ndeserve freedom? If she is peaceful, and shows symptoms of economic\r\nrecuperation, clearly she does not need or even want it. In other words,\r\nif all that is healthy in the patient battles desperately and not in\r\nvain, first against irritant poison, and then against soporific drugs,\r\nthis healthy struggle for self-preservation is attributed not to native\r\nvitality, but to the bracing regimen of coercive government.\r\n\r\nThis train of argument, so far from being confined to Ireland, is as old\r\nas the human race itself. Of all human passions, that for political\r\ndomination is the last to yield to reason. Men are naturally inclined to\r\nattribute admitted social evils to every cause--religion, climate, race,\r\ncongenital defects of character, the inscrutable decrees of Divine\r\nProvidence--rather than to the form of political institutions; in other\r\nwords, to the organic structure of the community, and to rest the\r\nsecurity of an Empire on any other foundation than that of the liberty\r\nof its component parts. If, in one case, their own experience proves\r\nthem wrong, they will go to the strangest lengths of perversity in\r\nmisreading their own experience, and they will seek every imaginable\r\npretext for distinguishing the case from its predecessor. Underlying all\r\nis a nervous terror of the abuse of freedom founded on the assumption\r\nthat men will continue to act when free exactly as they acted under the\r\ndemoralizing influence of coercion. The British Empire has grown, and\r\ncontinues to grow, in spite of this deeply rooted political doctrine.\r\nIreland is peculiar only in that her proximity to the seat of power has\r\nexposed her for centuries to an application of the doctrine in its most\r\nextreme form and without any hope of escape through the merciful\r\naccidents to which more fortunate communities owe their emancipation.\r\nCanada owes her position in the Empire, and the Empire itself exists in\r\nits present form to-day, owing to the accident that the transcendantly\r\nimportant principle of responsible government advocated by Lord Durham\r\nas a remedy for the anarchy and stagnation in which he found both the\r\nBritish and the French Provinces of Canada in 1838, did not require\r\nImperial legislation, and was established without the Parliamentary or\r\nelectoral sanction of Great Britain. Lord Durham was derided as a\r\nvisionary, and abused as unpatriotic for the assertion of this simple\r\nprinciple. Far in advance of his time as he was, he himself shrank from\r\nthe full application of his own lofty ideal, and consequently made one\r\ngreat, though under the circumstances not a capital, mistake in his\r\ndiagnosis, and it was to that mistake only that Parliament gave\r\nlegislative effect in 1840. By one of the most melancholy ironies in all\r\nhistory Ireland was the source of his error, so that the Union of the\r\nCanadas, dissolved as a failure by the Canadians themselves in 1867, was\r\nactually based on the success of the Anglo-Irish Union in repressing a\r\ndangerous nationality. Did the proof of the error in Canada induce\r\nEnglishmen to question the soundness of the precedent on which the error\r\nwas based? On the contrary, the lesson passed unnoticed, and the Irish\r\nprecedent has survived to darken thought, to retard democratic progress,\r\nand to pervert domestic and Imperial policy to this very day. It even\r\nhad the truly extraordinary retrospective effect of obliterating from\r\nthe minds of many eminent statesmen the significance of the Canadian\r\nparallel; for it is only six years ago that a Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies penned a despatch recommending for the Transvaal a form of\r\ngovernment similar to that which actually produced the Canadian\r\ndisorders of 1837, and supporting it by an argument whose effect was not\r\nmerely to resuscitate what time had proved to be false in Durham's\r\ndoctrine, but to discard what time had proved to be true. As for\r\nIreland herself, I know no more curious illustration of the strong\r\ntendency, even on the part of the most fair-minded men, to place that\r\ncountry outside the pale of social or political science, and of the\r\nextreme reluctance to judge its inhabitants by the elementary standards\r\nof human conduct, than the book to which I referred above--Mr.\r\nLocker-Lampson's \"A Consideration of Ireland in the Nineteenth Century.\"\r\nFor what he admits to be the ruinous results of British Government in\r\nthe past, the author in the last few pages of a lengthy volume has no\r\nbetter cure to suggest than a continuance of British government, and he\r\ndefends this course by a terse enumeration of the very phenomena which\r\nin Durham's opinion rendered the grant of Home Rule to Canada\r\nimperative, concluding with a paragraph which, with the substitution of\r\n\"Canada\" for \"Ireland,\" constitutes an admirably condensed epitome of\r\nthe arguments used both by politicians at home, and the minorities in\r\nCanada, in favour of Durham's error and against the truth he\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky represents a somewhat different school of thought, and reached\r\nhis Unionism by reasoning more profound and consistent, but, on the\r\nother hand, wholly destructive of the Imperial theory as held by the\r\nmodern school of Imperialists. His fear and distrust of democracy in all\r\nits forms and in all lands[2] was such that he naturally dreaded Irish\r\nNationalism, which is a form of democratic revolt suppressed so long and\r\nby such harsh methods as to exhibit features easily open to criticism.\r\nBut the gist of his argument would have applied just as well to the\r\npolitical evolution of the self-governing Colonies. Indeed, if he had\r\nlived to see the last Imperial Conference, the pessimism of so clear a\r\nthinker would assuredly have given way before the astounding contrast\r\nbetween those countries in which his political philosophy had been\r\nabjured, and the only white country in the Empire where by sheer force\r\nit had been maintained intact.\r\n\r\nIf my only object in writing were to contribute something toward the\r\ndissipation of the fears and doubts which render it so hard to carry any\r\nmeasure, however small, of Home Rule for Ireland, I should hope for\r\nlittle success. Practical men, with a practical decision to make, rarely\r\nlook outside the immediate facts before them. Extremists, in a case like\r\nthat of Ireland, are reluctant to take account of what Lord Morley\r\ncalls \"the fundamental probabilities of civil society.\" Sir Edward\r\nCarson would be more than human if he were to be influenced by a\r\ndemonstration that the case he makes against Home Rule is the same as\r\nthat made by the minority leaders, not only in the French, but in the\r\nBritish Province of Canada. Most of the minority to which he appeals\r\nwould now regard as an ill-timed paradox the view that the very vigour\r\nof their opposition to Home Rule is a better omen for the success of\r\nHome Rule than that kind of sapless Nationalism, astonishingly rare in\r\nIreland under the circumstances, which is inclined to yield to the\r\ninsidious temptation of setting the \"eleemosynary benefits\"--to use Mr.\r\nWalter Long's phrase[3]--derived from the British connection above the\r\nneed for self-help and self-reliance. The real paradox is that any\r\nIrishmen, Unionist or Nationalist, should tolerate advisers who, however\r\nsincere and patriotic, avowedly regard Ireland as the parasite of Great\r\nBritain; who appeal to the lower nature of her people; to the fears of\r\none section and the cupidity of both; advising Unionists to rely on\r\nBritish power and all Irishmen on British alms. A day will come when the\r\nhumiliation will be seen in its true light. Even now, I do venture to\r\nappeal to that small but powerful group of moderate Irish Unionists who,\r\nso far from fearing revenge or soliciting charity, spend their whole\r\nlives in the noble aim of uniting Irishmen of all creeds on a basis of\r\ncommon endeavour for their own economic and spiritual salvation; who\r\nfind their work checked in a thousand ways by the perpetual maintenance\r\nof a seemingly barren and sentimental agitation; who distrust both the\r\nparties to this agitation; but who are reluctant to accept the view\r\nthat, without the satisfaction of the national claim, and without the\r\nnational responsibility thereby conferred, their own aims can never be\r\nfully attained. I should be happy indeed if I could do even a little\r\ntowards persuading some of these men that they mistake cause and effect;\r\nmisinterpret what they resent; misjudge where they distrust, and in\r\nstanding aloof from the battle for legislative autonomy, unconsciously\r\nconcede a point--disinterested, constructive optimists as they are--to\r\nthe interested and destructive pessimism which, from Clare's savage\r\ninsults to Mr. Walter Long's contemptuous patronage, has always lain at\r\nthe root of British policy towards Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, for those who like or dislike it, Home Rule is\r\nimminent. We are face to face no longer with a highly speculative, but\r\nwith a vividly practical problem, raising legislative and administrative\r\nquestions of enormous practical importance, and next year we shall be\r\ndealing with this problem in an atmosphere of genuine reality totally\r\nunlike that of 1886, when Home Rule was a startling novelty to the\r\nBritish electorate, or of 1893, when the shadow of impending defeat\r\nclouded debate and weakened counsel. It would be pleasant to think that\r\nthe time which has elapsed, besides greatly mitigating anti-Irish\r\nprejudice, had been used for scientific study and dispassionate\r\ndiscussion of the problem of Home Rule. Unfortunately, after eighteen\r\nyears the problem remains almost exactly where it was. There are no\r\ndetailed proposals of an authoritative character in existence. No\r\nconcrete scheme was submitted to the country in the recent elections.\r\nNone is before the country now. The reason, of course, is that the Irish\r\nquestion is still an acute party question, not merely in Ireland, but in\r\nGreat Britain. Party passion invariably discourages patient constructive\r\nthought, and all legislation associated with it suffers in consequence.\r\nTactical considerations, sometimes altogether irrelevant to the special\r\nissue, have to be considered. In the case of Home Rule, when the balance\r\nof parties is positively determined by the Irish vote, the difficulty\r\nreaches its climax. It is idle to blame individuals. We should blame the\r\nUnion. So long as one island democracy claims to determine the destinies\r\nof another island democracy, of whose special needs and circumstances it\r\nis admittedly ignorant, so long will both islands suffer.\r\n\r\nThis ignorance is not disputed. No Irish Unionist claims that Great\r\nBritain should govern Ireland on the ground that the British electorate,\r\nor even British statesmen, understand Irish questions. On the contrary,\r\nin Ireland, at any rate, their ignorance is a matter for satirical\r\ncomment with all parties. What he complains of is, that the British\r\nelectorate is beginning to carry its ignorance to the point of believing\r\nthat the Irish electorate is competent to decide Irish questions, and\r\nin educating the British electorate he has hitherto devoted himself\r\nexclusively to the eradication of this error. The financial results of\r\nthe Union are such that he is now being cajoled into adding, \"It is your\r\nmoney, not your wisdom, that we want.\" Once more, an odd state of\r\naffairs, and some day we shall all marvel in retrospect that the Union\r\nwas so long sustained by a separatist argument, reinforced in latter\r\ndays by such an inconsistent and unconscionable claim.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, if only the present situation can be turned to\r\nadvantage, this crowning paradox is the most hopeful element in the\r\nwhole of a tangled question. It is not only that the British elector is\r\nlikely to revolt at once against the slur upon his intelligence and the\r\ndrain upon his purse, but that Irish Unionism, once convinced of the\r\ntenacity and sincerity of that revolt, is likely to undergo a dramatic\r\nand beneficent transformation. If they are to have Home Rule, Irish\r\nUnionists--even those who now most heartily detest it--will want the\r\nbest possible scheme of Home Rule, and the best possible scheme is not\r\nlikely to be the half measure which, from no fault of the statesman\r\nresponsible for it, tactical difficulties may make inevitable. If the\r\nvital energy now poured into sheer uncompromising opposition to the\r\nprinciples of Home Rule could be transmuted into intellectual and moral\r\neffort after the best form of Home Rule, I believe that the result would\r\nbe a drastic scheme.\r\n\r\nCompromise enters more or less into the settlement of all burning\r\npolitical questions. That is inevitable under the party system; but of\r\nall questions under the sun, Home Rule questions are the least\r\nsusceptible of compromise so engendered. The subject, in reality, is not\r\nsuitable for settlement at Westminster. This is a matter of experience,\r\nnot of assertion. Within the present bounds of the Empire no lasting\r\nConstitution has ever been framed for a subordinate State to the\r\nmoulding of which Parliament, in the character of a party assembly,\r\ncontributed an active share. Constitutions which promote prosperity and\r\nloyalty have actually or virtually been framed by those who were to live\r\nunder them. If circumstances make it impossible to adopt this course for\r\nIreland, let us nevertheless remember that all the friction and enmity\r\nbetween the Mother Country and subordinate States have arisen, not from\r\nthe absence, but from the inadequacy of self-governing powers. Checks\r\nand restrictions, so far from benefiting Great Britain or the Colonies,\r\nhave damaged both in different degrees, the Colonies suffering most\r\nbecause these checks and restrictions produce in the country submitted\r\nto them peculiar mischiefs which exist neither under a despotic régime\r\nnor an unnatural Legislative Union, fruitful of evil as both those\r\nsystems are. The damage is not evanescent, but is apt to bite deep into\r\nnational character and to survive the abolition of the institutions\r\nwhich caused it. The Anglo-Irish Union was created and has ever since\r\nbeen justified by a systematic defamation of Irish character. If it is\r\nat length resolved to bury the slander and trust Ireland, in the name of\r\njustice and reason let the trust be complete and the institutions given\r\nher such as to permit full play to her best instincts and tendencies,\r\nnot such as to deflect them into wrong paths. Let us be scrupulously\r\ncareful to avoid mistakes which might lead to a fresh campaign of\r\ndefamation like that waged against Canada, as well as Ireland, between\r\n1830 and 1840.\r\n\r\nThe position, I take it, is that most Irish Unionists still count,\r\nrightly or wrongly, on defeating Home Rule, not only in the first\r\nParliamentary battle, but by exciting public opinion during the long\r\nperiod of subsequent delay which the Parliament Bill permits. Not until\r\nHome Rule is a moral certainty, and perhaps not even then, do the\r\nextremists intend to consider the Irish Constitution in a practical\r\nspirit. Surely this is a perilous policy. Surely it must be so regarded\r\nby the moderate men--and there are many--who, if Home Rule comes, intend\r\nto throw their abilities into making it a success, and who will be\r\nindispensable to Ireland at a moment of supreme national importance.\r\nIrretrievable mistakes may be made by too long a gamble with the chances\r\nof political warfare. Whatever the scheme produced, the extremists will\r\nhave to oppose it tooth and nail. If the measure is big, sound, and\r\ngenerous, it will be necessary to attack its best features with the\r\ngreatest vigour; to rely on beating up vague, anti-separatist sentiment\r\nin Great Britain; to represent Irish Protestants as a timid race forced\r\nto shelter behind British bayonets; in short, to use all the arguments\r\nwhich, if Irish Unionists were compelled to frame a Constitution\r\nthemselves, they would scorn to employ, and which, if grafted on the Act\r\nin the form of amendments, they themselves in after-years might\r\nbitterly regret. Conversely, if the measure is a limited one, it will be\r\nnecessary to commend its worst features; to extol its eleemosynary side\r\nand all the infractions of liberty which in actual practice they would\r\nfind intolerably irksome. Whatever happens, things will be said which\r\nare not meant, and passions aroused which will be difficult to allay on\r\nthe eve of a crisis when Ireland will need the harmonious co-operation\r\nof all her ablest sons.\r\n\r\nIf, behind the calculation of a victory within the next two years, there\r\nlies the presentiment of an eventual defeat, let not the thought be\r\nencouraged that a better form of Home Rule is likely to come from a Tory\r\nthan from a Liberal Government. Many Irish Unionists regard the prospect\r\nof continued submission to a Liberal, or what they consider a\r\nsemi-Socialist, Government as the one consideration which would\r\nreconcile them to Home Rule. No one can complain of that. But they make\r\na fatal mistake in denying Liberals credit for understanding questions\r\nof Home Rule better than Tories. That, again, is a matter of proved\r\nexperience. Compare the abortive Transvaal Constitution of 1905 with the\r\nreality of 1906, and measure the probable consequences of the former by\r\nthe actual results of the latter. Let them remember, too, that every\r\nyear which passes aggravates the financial difficulties which imperil\r\nthe future of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe best hope of securing a final settlement of the Irish question in\r\nthe immediate future lies in promoting open discussion on the details of\r\nthe Home Rule scheme, and of drawing into that discussion all Irishmen\r\nand Englishmen who realize the profound importance of the issue. This\r\nbook is offered as a small contribution to the controversy.\r\n\r\nFor help in writing it I am deeply indebted to many friends on both\r\nsides of the Irish Channel, in Ireland to officials and private persons,\r\nwho have generously placed their experience at my disposal; while in\r\nEngland I owe particular thanks to the Committee of which I had the\r\nhonour to be a member, which sat during the summer of this year under\r\nthe chairmanship of Mr. Basil Williams, and which published the series\r\nof essays called \"Home Rule Problems.\"\r\n\r\nE.C.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The two latter works were written by Mr. Lecky in his Nationalist\r\nyouth the first and greater work after he had become a Unionist. They\r\nform a connected whole, however, and are not inconsistent with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[2] See \"Democracy and Liberty.\"\r\n\r\n[3] \"Did the people of Ireland understand that the destruction of the\r\nUnion, so lightly advocated by Lord Haldane, must result in the\r\ncessation of those largely eleemosynary benefits to which the progress\r\nof Ireland is due, her 'dissatisfaction' would be unmistakably directed\r\ntowards her false advisers?\"--Letter to the _Belfast Telegraph_, October\r\n7, 1911, criticizing Lord Haldane's preface to \"Home Rule Problems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this book went to press the Treasury has issued a revised version\r\nof Return No. 220, 1911 [Revenue and Expenditure (England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland)], cancelling the Return issued in July, and correcting an error\r\nmade in it. It now appears that the \"true\" Excise revenue attributable\r\nto Ireland from _spirits_ in 1910-11 (with deductions made by the\r\nTreasury from the sum actually collected in Ireland) should be\r\n£3,575,000, instead of £3,734,000, and that the total \"true\" Irish\r\nrevenue in that year was, therefore, £11,506,500, instead of\r\n£11,665,500. In other words, Irish revenue for 1910-11 was\r\nover-estimated in the Return now cancelled by £159,000.\r\n\r\nThe error does not affect the Author's argument as expounded in Chapters\r\nXII. and XIII.; but it necessitates the correction of a number of\r\nfigures given by him, especially in Chapter XII., the principal change\r\nbeing that the deficit in Irish revenue, as calculated on the mean of\r\nthe two years 1909-10 and 1910-11, should actually be £1,392,000,\r\ninstead of £1,312,500.\r\n\r\nThe full list of corrections is as follows:\r\n\r\nPage 259, line 9, _for_ \"£1,312,500,\" _read_ \"£1,392,000.\"\r\n\r\nPage 260, table, third column, line 6, _for_ \"£10,032,000,\" _read_\r\n\"£9,952 500\"; last line, _for_ \"£1,312,500,\" _read_ \"£1,392,000.\"\r\n\r\nPage 261, table, last column, last line but one, _for_ \"£321,000,\"\r\n_read_ \"£162,000\"; last line (total), _for_ \"£329,780,970,\" _read_\r\n\"£329,621,970.\"\r\n\r\nPage 262, line 7, _for_ \"£10,032,000,\" _read_ \"£9,952,500\"; line 10,\r\n_for_ \"£1,312,500,\" _read_ \"£1,392,000.\"\r\n\r\nPage 275. table, last column, line 2, _for_ \"£3,734,000,\" _read_\r\n\"£3,575,000\"; line 7, _for_ \"£10,371,000,\" _read_ \"£10,212,000\"; line\r\n14, _for_ \"£11,665,500,\" _read_, \"£11,506,500\"; in text, last line but\r\none of page, _for_ \"£10,032,000,\" _read_ \"£9,952,500.\"\r\n\r\nPage 276, line 5, _for_ \"£500,000,\" _read_, \"£340,000\"; table, last\r\ncolumn, line 2, _for_ \"£3,316,000,\" _read_ \"£3,236,500\"; line 3, _for_\r\n\"£6,182,000,\" _read_ \"£6,102,500\"; line 9, _for_ \"£8,737,500,\" _read_\r\n\"£8,658,000\"; last line, _for_ \"£10,032,000,\" _read_ \"£9,952,500.\"\r\n\r\nPage 277, line 2, _for_ \"£1,672,500,\" _read_ \"£1,752,000\"; line 7, _for_\r\n\"£1,312,500,\" _read_ \"£1,392,000\"; line 8, _for_ \"£10,032,000,\" _read_\r\n\"£9,952,500\"; line 12, _for_ \"£1,672,500,\" _read_ \"£1,752,000\";\r\nfootnote, line 1, _for_ \"£1,793,000,\" _read_ \"£1,952,000.\"\r\n\r\nPage 279, line 8, _for_ \"70.75,\" _read_ \"70.48.\"\r\n\r\nPage 282, sixth line from bottom, _for_ \"£1,312,500,\" _read_\r\n\"£1,392,000.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPage 246, line 8 and footnote, and page 295, lines 21-31: A temporary\r\nmeasure has been passed (Surplus Revenue Act, 1910), under which the\r\nSurplus Commonwealth Revenue is returned to the States on a basis of £1\r\n5s. per head of the population of each State.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPage 288, line 2, _omit_ \"like the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.\"\r\nThese islands have distinct local tariffs, but they cannot be said to be\r\nwholly under local control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRAMEWORK OF HOME RULE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE COLONIZATION OF IRELAND AND AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland was the oldest and the nearest of the Colonies. We are apt to\r\nforget that she was ever colonized, and that for a long period, although\r\nstyled a Kingdom, she was kept in a position of commercial and political\r\ndependence inferior to that of any Colony. Constitutional theory still\r\nblinds a number of people to the fact that in actual practice Ireland is\r\nstill governed in many respects as a Colony, but on principles which in\r\nall other white communities of the British Empire are extinct. Like all\r\nColonies, she has a Governor or Lord-Lieutenant of her own, an Executive\r\nof her own, and a complete system of separate Government Departments,\r\nbut her people, unlike the inhabitants of a self-governing Colony,\r\nexercise no control over the administration. She possesses no\r\nLegislature of her own, although in theory she is supposed to possess\r\nsufficient legislative control over Irish affairs through representation\r\nin the Imperial Parliament. In practice, however, this control has\r\nalways been, and still remains, illusory, just as it would certainly\r\nhave proved illusory if conferred upon any Colony. It can be exercised\r\nonly by cumbrous, circuitous, and often profoundly unhealthy methods;\r\nand over a wide range of matters it cannot by any method whatsoever be\r\nexercised at all.\r\n\r\nTo look behind mere technicalities to the spirit of government, Ireland\r\nresembles one of that class of Crown Colonies of which Jamaica and Malta\r\nare examples, where the inhabitants exercise no control over\r\nadministration, and only partial control over legislation.[4]\r\n\r\nWhy is this?\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Chamberlain, always frank and fearless in his political\r\njudgments, gave the best answer in 1893, when opposing the first reading\r\nof the second of Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule Bills. \"Does anybody doubt,\"\r\nhe said, \"that if Ireland were a thousand miles away from England she\r\nwould not have been long before this a self-governing Colony?\" Now this\r\nwas not a barren geographical truism, which might by way of hypothesis\r\nbe applied in identical terms to any fraction of the United\r\nKingdom--say, for example, to that part of England lying south of the\r\nThames. Mr. Chamberlain never made any attempt to deny--no one with the\r\nsmallest knowledge of history could have denied--that Ireland, though\r\nonly sixty miles away from England, was less like England than any of\r\nthe self-governing Colonies then attached to the Crown, possessing\r\ndistinct national characteristics which entitled her, in theory at any\r\nrate, to demand, not merely colonial, but national autonomy. On the\r\ncontrary, Mr. Chamberlain went out of his way to argue, with all the\r\nforce and fire of an accomplished debater, that the Bill was a highly\r\ndangerous measure precisely because, while granting Ireland a measure of\r\nautonomy, it denied her some of the elementary powers, not only of\r\ncolonial, but of national States; for instance, the full control over\r\ntaxation, which all self-governing Colonies possessed, and the control\r\nover foreign policy, which is a national attribute. The complementary\r\nstep in his argument was that, although nominally withheld by statute,\r\nthese fuller powers would be forcibly usurped by the future Irish\r\nGovernment through the leverage offered by a subordinate Legislature and\r\nExecutive, and that, once grasped, they would be used to the injury of\r\nGreat Britain and the minority in Ireland. Ireland (\"a fearful danger\")\r\nmight arm, ally herself with France, and, while submitting the\r\nProtestant minority to cruel persecution, would retain enough national\r\nunity to smite Britain hip and thigh, and so avenge the wrong of ages.\r\n\r\nEven to the most ardent Unionist the case thus presented must, in the\r\nyear 1911, present a doubtful aspect. The British _entente_ with France,\r\nand the absence of the smallest ascertainable sympathy between Ireland\r\nand Germany, he will dismiss, perhaps, as points of minor importance,\r\nbut he will detect at once in the argument an antagonism, natural enough\r\nin 1893, between national and colonial attributes, and he will remember,\r\nwith inner misgivings, that his own party has taken an especially active\r\npart during the last ten years in furthering the claim of the\r\nself-governing Colonies to the status of nationhood as an essential step\r\nin the furtherance of Imperial unity. The word \"nation,\" therefore, as\r\napplied to Ireland, has lost some of its virtue as a deterrent to Home\r\nRule. Even the word \"Colony\" is becoming harmless; for every year that\r\nhas passed since 1893 has made it more abundantly clear that colonial\r\nfreedom means colonial friendship; and, after all, friendship is more\r\nimportant than legal ties. In one remarkable case, that of the conquered\r\nDutch Republic in South Africa, a flood of searching light has been\r\nthrown on the significance of those phrases \"nation\" and \"Colony.\"\r\nThere, as in Ireland, and originally in Canada, \"national\" included\r\nracial characteristics, and colonial autonomy signified national\r\nautonomy in a more accurate sense than in Australia or Newfoundland. But\r\nwe know now that it does not signify either a racial tyranny within\r\nthose nations, or a racial antipathy to the Mother Country; but, on the\r\ncontrary, a reconciliation of races within and friendship without.\r\n\r\nWould Mr. Chamberlain recast his argument now? Unhappily, we shall not\r\nknow. But it does seem to me that recent history and his own temperament\r\nwould force him to do so. As in his abandonment of Free Trade, it was a\r\nstrong and sincere Imperialist instinct that eventually transformed him\r\nfrom the advocate of provincial Home Rule into the relentless enemy of\r\nHome Rule in any shape. Take the Imperial argument, shaken to its\r\nfoundations by subsequent events, from the case he stated in 1893, and\r\nwhat remains? Two pleas only--first, the abnormality of Irishmen;\r\nsecond, Ireland's proximity to England. The first expresses the old\r\ntraditional view that Ireland is outside the pale of all human analogy;\r\nthe exception to all rules; her innate depravity and perversity such\r\nthat she would abuse power where others respect it, derive enmity where\r\nothers derive friendship, and willingly ruin herself by internal\r\ndissension and extravagant ambitions in order, if possible, at the same\r\ntime to ruin England. Unconnected, however loosely, with the high\r\nImperial argument, I do not believe that this plea could have been used\r\nwith sincerity by Mr. Chamberlain even in 1893. He was a democrat,\r\ndevoted to the cause of enfranchising and trusting the people; and this\r\nplea was, after all, only the same anti-democratic argument applied to\r\nIreland, and tipped with racial venom, which had been used for\r\ngenerations by most Tories and many Whigs against any extension of\r\npopular power. Lord Randolph Churchill, the Tory democrat, in his\r\ndispassionate moments, always scouted it, resting his case against Home\r\nRule on different grounds. It was strange enough to see the argument\r\nused by the Radical author of all the classic denunciations of class\r\nascendancy and the classic eulogies of the sense, forbearance and\r\ngenerosity of free electorates. It was all the stranger in that Mr.\r\nChamberlain himself a few years before had committed himself to a scheme\r\nof restricted self-government for Ireland, and in the debates on Mr.\r\nGladstone's first Home Rule Bill of 1886, when the condition of Ireland\r\nwas far worse than in 1893, had declared himself ready to give that\r\ncountry a Constitution similar to that enjoyed by Quebec or Ontario\r\nwithin the Dominion of Canada. But politics are politics. Under the\r\ninexorable laws of the party game, politicians are advocates and swell\r\ntheir indictments with every count which will bear the light. The system\r\nworks well enough in every case but one--the indictment of a\r\nfellow-nation for incapacity to rule itself. There, both in Ireland and\r\neverywhere else, as I shall show, it works incalculable mischief. Once\r\ncommitted irrevocably to the opposition of Mr. Gladstone's Bills, Mr.\r\nChamberlain, standing on Imperial ground, which seemed to him and his\r\nfollowers firm enough then, used his unrivalled debating powers to\r\ntraduce and exasperate the Irish people and their leaders by every\r\ndevice in his power.\r\n\r\nOne other point survives in its integrity from the case made by Mr.\r\nChamberlain in 1893, and that is the argument about distance. Clearly\r\nthis is a quite distinct contention from the last; for distance from any\r\ngiven point does not by itself radically alter human nature. Australians\r\nare not twice as good or twice as bad as South Africans because they\r\nare twice as far from the Mother Country. \"Does anybody doubt\"--let me\r\nrepeat his words--\"that if Ireland were a thousand miles from England\r\nshe would not have been long before this a self-governing Colony?\" The\r\nwhole tragedy of Ireland lies in that \"if\"; but the condition is,\r\nwithout doubt, still unsatisfied. Ireland is still only sixty miles away\r\nfrom the English shores, and the argument from proximity, for what it is\r\nworth, is still plausible. To a vast number of minds it still seems\r\nconclusive. Put the South African parallel to the average moderate\r\nUnionist, half disposed to admit the force of this analogy, he would\r\nnevertheless answer: \"Ah, but Ireland is so near.\" Well, let us join\r\nissue on the two grounds I have indicated--the ground of Irish\r\nabnormality, and the ground of Ireland's proximity. It will be found, I\r\nthink, that neither contention is tenable by itself; that a supporter of\r\none unconsciously or consciously reinforces it by reference to the\r\nother, and that to refute one is to refute both. It will be found, too,\r\nthat, apart from mechanical and unessential difficulties, the whole case\r\nagainst Home Rule is included and summed up in these two contentions,\r\nand that the mechanical problem itself will be greatly eased and\r\nilluminated by their refutation.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThose sixty miles of salt water which we know as the Irish Channel--if\r\nonly every Englishman could realize their tremendous significance in\r\nAnglo-Irish history--what an ineffectual barrier \"in the long result of\r\ntime\" to colonization and conquest; what an impassable barrier--through\r\nthe ignorance and perversity of British statesmanship--to sympathy and\r\nracial fusion!\r\n\r\nFor eight hundred years after the Christian era her distance from Europe\r\ngave Ireland immunity from external shocks, and freedom to work out her\r\nown destiny. She never, for good or ill, underwent Roman occupation or\r\nTeutonic invasion. She was secure enough to construct and maintain\r\nunimpaired a civilization of her own, warlike, prosperous, and\r\nmarvellously rich, for that age, in scholarship and culture. She\r\nproduced heroic warriors, peaceful merchants, and gentle scholars and\r\ndivines; poets, musicians, craftsmen, architects, theologians. She had a\r\npassion for diffusing knowledge, and for more than a thousand years sent\r\nher missionaries of piety, learning, art, and commerce, far and wide\r\nover Europe. For two hundred years she resisted her first foreign\r\ninvaders, the Danes, with desperate tenacity, and seems to have absorbed\r\ninto her own civilization and polity those who ultimately retained a\r\nfooting on her eastern shores.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the Anglo-Normans at the end of the twelfth century\r\nthe dark shadow begins to fall, and for the first time the Irish Channel\r\nassumes its tragic significance. England, compounded of Britons,\r\nTeutons, Danes, Scandinavians, Normans, with the indelible impress of\r\nRome upon the whole, had emerged, under Nature's mysterious alchemy, a\r\nstrong State. Ireland had preserved her Gaelic purity, her tribal\r\norganization, her national culture, but at the cost of falling behind in\r\nthe march of political and military organization. Sixty miles divided\r\nher from the nearest part of the outlying dominions of feudal England,\r\n150 miles from the dynamic centre of English power. The degree of\r\ndistance seems to have been calculated with fatal exactitude, in\r\ncorrespondence with the degrees of national vitality in the two\r\ncountries respectively, to produce for ages to come the worst possible\r\neffects on both. The process was slow. Ireland was near enough to\r\nattract the Anglo-Norman adventurers and colonists, but strong enough\r\nand fair enough for three hundred years to transform them into patriots\r\n\"more Irish than the Irish\"; always, however, too near and too weak,\r\neven with their aid, to expel the direct representatives of English rule\r\nfrom the foothold they had obtained on her shores, while at the same\r\ntime too far and too formidable to enable that rule to expand into the\r\ncomplete conquest and subjugation of the realm.\r\n\r\n\"The English rule,\" says Mr. Lecky, \"as a living reality, was confined\r\nand concentrated within the limits of the Pale. The hostile power\r\nplanted in the heart of the nation destroyed all possibility of central\r\ngovernment, while it was itself incapable of fulfilling that function.\r\nLike a spear-point embedded in a living body, it inflamed all around it\r\nand deranged every vital function. It prevented the gradual reduction\r\nof the island by some native Clovis, which would necessarily have taken\r\nplace if the Anglo-Normans had not arrived, and instead of that peaceful\r\nand almost silent amalgamation of races, customs, laws, and languages,\r\nwhich took place in England, and which is the source of many of the best\r\nelements in English life and character, the two nations remained in\r\nIreland for centuries in hostility.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this period dates that intense national antipathy felt by the\r\nEnglish for the Irish race which has darkened all subsequent history. It\r\nwas not originally a temperamental antipathy, or it would be impossible\r\nto explain the powerful attraction of Irish character, manners, and laws\r\nfor the great bulk of the Anglo-Norman colonists. Nor within Ireland,\r\neven after the Reformation, was it a religious antipathy between a\r\nProtestant race and a race exclusively and immovably Catholic. It was in\r\norigin a political antipathy between a small official minority, backed\r\nby the support of a powerful Mother Country struggling for ascendancy\r\nover a large native and naturalized majority, divided itself by tribal\r\nfeuds, but on the whole united in loathing and combating that\r\nascendancy. Universal experience, as I shall afterwards show, proves\r\nthat an enmity so engendered takes a more monstrous and degrading shape\r\nthan any other. Religion becomes its pretext. Ignorance makes it easy,\r\nand interest makes it necessary, to represent the native race as savages\r\noutside the pale of law and morals, against whom any violence and\r\ntreachery is justifiable. The legend grows and becomes a permanent\r\npolitical axiom, distorting and abasing the character of those who act\r\non it and those who, suffering from it, and retaliating against its\r\nconsequences, construct their counter-legend of the inherent wickedness\r\nof the dominant race. If left to themselves, white races, of diverse\r\nnationalities, thrown together in one country, eventually coalesce, or\r\nat least learn to live together peaceably. But if an external power too\r\nremote to feel genuine responsibility for the welfare of the\r\ninhabitants, while near enough to exert its military power on them,\r\ntakes sides in favour of the minority, and employs them as its permanent\r\nand privileged garrison, the results are fatal to the peace and\r\nprosperity of the country it seeks to dominate, and exceedingly\r\nharmful, though in a degree less easy to gauge, to itself. So it was\r\nwith Ireland; and yet it cannot fail to strike any student of history\r\nwhat an extraordinary resilience she showed again and again under any\r\ntransient phase of wise and tolerant government.\r\n\r\nSuch a phase occurred in the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII.,\r\nwhen, after the defeat of the Geraldines, for the first time some\r\nsemblance of royal authority was established over the whole realm; and\r\nwhen an effort was also made, not through theft or violence, but by\r\nconciliatory statecraft, to replace the native Brehon system of law and\r\nland tenure by English institutions, and to anglicize the Irish chiefs.\r\nThe process stopped abruptly and for ever with the accession of Mary, to\r\nbe replaced by the forcible confiscation of Irish land, and the\r\n\"planting\" of English and Scotch settlers.\r\n\r\nIreland, for four hundred years the only British Colony, is now drawn\r\ninto the mighty stream of British colonial expansion. Adventurous and\r\nambitious Englishmen began to regard her fertile acres as Raleigh\r\nregarded America, and, in point of time, the systematic and State-aided\r\ncolonization of Ireland is approximately contemporaneous with that of\r\nAmerica. It is true that until the first years of the sixteenth century\r\nno permanent British settlement had been made in America, while in\r\nIreland the plantation of King's and Queen's Counties was begun as early\r\nas 1556, and under Elizabeth further vast confiscations were carried out\r\nin Munster within the same century. But from the reign of James I.\r\nonward, the two processes advance _pari passu_. Virginia, first founded\r\nby Raleigh in 1585, is firmly settled in 1607, just before the\r\nconfiscation of Ulster and its plantation by 30,000 Scots; and in 1620,\r\njust after that huge measure of expropriation, the Pilgrim Fathers\r\nlanded in New Plymouth. Puritan Massachusetts--with its offshoots,\r\nConnecticut, New Haven and Rhode Island--as well as Catholic Maryland,\r\nwere formally established between 1629 and 1638, and Maine in 1639, at a\r\nperiod when the politically inspired proscription of the Catholic\r\nreligion, succeeding the robbery of the soil, was goading the unhappy\r\nIrish to the rebellion of 1641. While that rebellion, with its fierce\r\nexcesses and pitiless reprisals, was convulsing Ireland, the united\r\nColonies of New England banded themselves together for mutual defence.\r\n\r\nA few years later Cromwell, aiming, through massacre and rapine, at the\r\nextermination of the Irish race, with the savage watchword \"To Hell or\r\nConnaught,\" planted Ulster, Munster, and Leinster with men of the same\r\nstock, stamp, and ideas as the colonists of New England, and in the\r\nfirst years of the Restoration Charles II. confirmed these\r\nconfiscations, at the same time that he granted Carolina to Lord\r\nClarendon, New Netherlands to the Duke of York, and New Jersey to Lord\r\nBerkeley, and issued fresh Charters for Connecticut and Maryland.\r\nFinally, Quaker Penn founded Pennsylvania in 1682, and in 1691 William\r\nIII., after the hopeless Jacobite insurrections in favour of the last of\r\nthe Stuarts, wrung the last million acres of good Irish land from the\r\nold Catholic proprietors, planted them with Protestant Englishmen, and\r\ncompleted the colonization of Ireland. Forty years passed (1733) before\r\nGeorgia, the last of the \"Old Thirteen Colonies,\" was planted, as Ulster\r\nhad been planted, mainly by Scotch Presbyterians.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of this period we must remember that conquered\r\nIreland herself was contributing to the colonization of America. Every\r\nsuccessive act of spoliation drove Catholic Irishmen across the Atlantic\r\nas well as into Europe, and gave every Colony an infusion of Irish\r\nblood. Until the beginning of the eighteenth century this class of\r\nemigration was for the most part involuntary. Cromwell, for example,\r\nshipped off thousands of families indiscriminately to the West Indies\r\nand America for sale, as \"servants\" to the colonists. The only organized\r\nand voluntary expedition in which Irish Catholics took part was that to\r\nMaryland under Lord Baltimore. The distinction in course of time became\r\nimmaterial. In the free American air English, Scotch, and Irish became\r\none people, with a common political and social tradition.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, and for a proper understanding of the Irish question,\r\nindispensable, briefly to contrast the characteristics and progress of\r\nthe American and Irish settlements, and in doing so to observe the\r\nprofound effects of geographical position and political institutions on\r\nhuman character. I shall afterwards ask the reader to include in the\r\ncomparison the later British Colonies formed in Canada and South Africa\r\nby conquest, and in Australia by peaceful settlement.\r\n\r\nLet us note, first, that both in America and Ireland the Colonies were\r\nbi-racial, with this all-important distinction, that in America the\r\nnative race was coloured, savage, heathen, nomadic, incapable of fusion\r\nwith the whites, and, in relation to the almost illimitable territory\r\ncolonized, not numerous; while in Ireland the native race was white,\r\ncivilized, Christian, numerous, and confined within the limits of a\r\nsmall island to which it was passionately attached by treasured national\r\ntraditions, and whose soil it cultivated under an ancient and revered\r\nsystem of tribal tenure. The parallel, then, in this respect, is slight,\r\nand becomes insignificant, except in regard to the similarity of the\r\nmental attitude of the colonists towards Indians and Irish respectively.\r\nIn natural humanity the colonists of Ireland and the colonists of\r\nAmerica differed in no appreciable degree. They were the same men, with\r\nthe same inherent virtues and defects, acting according to the pressure\r\nof environment. Danger, in proportionate degree, made both classes\r\nbrutal and perfidious; but in America, though there were moments of\r\nsharp crisis, as in 1675 on the borders of Massachusetts, the degree was\r\ncomparatively small, and through the defeat and extrusion of the Indians\r\ndiminished steadily. In Ireland, because complete expulsion and\r\nextermination were impossible, the degree was originally great, and,\r\nlong after it had actually disappeared, haunted the imagination and\r\ndistorted the policy of the invading nation.\r\n\r\nIn America there was no land question. Freeholds were plentiful for the\r\nmeanest settlers and the title was sound and indisputable. In the\r\n\"proprietary\" Colonies, it is true, vast tracts of country were\r\noriginally vested by royal grants in a single nobleman or a group of\r\ncapitalists, just as vast estates were granted in Ireland to peers,\r\nLondon companies, and syndicates of \"undertakers\"; but by the nature of\r\nthings, the extent of territory, its distance, and the absence of a\r\nwhite subject race, no agrarian harm resulted in America, and a healthy\r\nsystem of tenure, almost exclusively freehold, was naturally evolved.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the land question was the whole question from the first. If\r\nthe natives had been exterminated, or their remnants wholly confined,\r\nas Cromwell planned, to the barren lands of Connaught, all might have\r\nbeen well for the conquerors. Or if Ireland had been, in Mr.\r\nChamberlain's phrase, a thousand miles away, all might have come right\r\nunder the compulsion of circumstances and the healing influence of time.\r\nThat the Celtic race still possessed its strong powers of assimilation\r\nwas shown by the almost complete denationalization and absorption of a\r\nlarge number of Cromwell's soldier-colonists in the south and south-east\r\nunder what Mr. Lecky calls the \"invincible Catholicism\" of the Irish\r\nwomen. But the Irish were not only numerous, but fatally near the seat\r\nof Empire. The natives--Irish or Anglo-Irish--were still more than twice\r\nas numerous as the colonists; they were scattered over the whole\r\ncountry, barren or fertile, and that country was within a day's sail of\r\nEngland. The titles of the colonists to the land rested on sheer\r\nviolence, sometimes aggravated by the grossest meanness and treachery,\r\nand these titles were not recognized by the plundered race. Even with\r\ntheir gradual recognition it would have been difficult to introduce the\r\nEnglish system of tenure, which was radically different and repellent to\r\nthe Irish mind. The bare idea of one man absolutely owning land and\r\ntransmitting it entire to his heirs was incomprehensible to them.\r\n\r\nThe solution for all these difficulties was unfortunately only too easy\r\nand obvious. England was near, strong, and thoroughly imbued with the\r\npolicy of governing Ireland on the principle of antagonizing the races\r\nwithin her. It was possible, therefore, by English help, under laws made\r\nin England, to constitute the Irish outlaws from the land, labourers on\r\nit, no doubt, that was an economic necessity, precarious occupiers of\r\nplots just sufficient to support life; but, in the eyes of the law,\r\nserfs. The planters of the southern American Colonies imported African\r\nnegroes for the same purpose, with irretrievably mischievous results to\r\ntheir own descendants. Nor is it an exaggeration to compare the use made\r\nof the Irish for a certain period to the use made of these negroes, for\r\ngreat numbers of the Irish were actually exported as slaves to\r\nBarbadoes, Jamaica, and even to Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe outlawed multitude in Ireland were deprived, not only of all rights\r\nto the land, but, as a corollary, of all social privileges whatsoever.\r\n\"The law,\" said an Irish Lord Chancellor, \"does not suppose any such\r\nperson to exist as an Irish Roman Catholic.\" The instrument of ostracism\r\nwas the famous Penal Code, begun in William's reign in direct and\r\nimmediate defiance of a solemn pledge given in the Treaty of Limerick,\r\nguaranteeing liberty of conscience to the Catholics, and perfected in\r\nthe reign of Anne. This Code, ostensibly framed to extirpate\r\nCatholicism, was primarily designed to confirm and perpetuate the\r\ngigantic dislocation of property caused by the transference of Irish and\r\nAnglo-Irish land into English and Scotch ownership. Since the rightful\r\nowners were Catholic, and the wrongful owners Protestants, the laws\r\nagainst the Catholic religion--a religion feared everywhere by\r\nEnglishmen at this period--were the simplest means of legalizing and\r\nbuttressing the new régime. I shall not linger over the details of the\r\nCode. Burke's description of it remains classic and unquestioned: \"A\r\ncomplete system full of coherence and consistency, well digested and\r\ncomposed in all its parts ... a machine of wise and elaborate\r\ncontrivance; and as well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment and\r\ndegradation of a people, and the debasement in them of human nature\r\nitself, as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man.\"\r\n\r\nThe aim was to reduce the Catholics to poverty, ignorance, and\r\nimpotence, and the aim was successful. Of the laws against priests,\r\nworship, education, and of the bars to commerce and the professions, I\r\nneed not speak. In the matter of property, the fundamental enactments\r\nconcerned the land, namely, that no Catholic could own land, or lease it\r\nfor more than thirty years, and even then on conditions which made\r\nprofitable tenure practically impossible. This law created and sustained\r\nthe serfdom I have described, and is the direct cause of the modern land\r\nproblem. It remained unaltered in the smallest respect for seventy\r\nyears, that is, until 1761, when a Catholic was permitted to lease for\r\nsixty-one years as much as fifty acres of bog not less than four feet\r\ndeep. Long before this the distribution of landed property and the\r\nsystem of land tenure had become stereotyped.\r\n\r\nThis system of tenure was one of the worst that ever existed on the face\r\nof the globe. It has been matched in portions of India, but nowhere\r\nelse in this Empire save in little Prince Edward Island, where we shall\r\nmeet with it again. In Ireland, where it assumed its worst form, violent\r\nconquest by a neighbouring power not only made it politic to outlaw the\r\nold owners, but precluded the introduction of the traditional English\r\ntenures, even into the relations between the British superior landlord\r\nand the British occupying colonist. The bulk of the confiscated Irish\r\nland, as I have mentioned, had been granted in fee to English noblemen,\r\ngentlemen, or speculators, who planted it with middle or lower-class\r\ntenants. A number of Cromwell's private soldiers settled in Leinster and\r\nMunster, and, holding small farms in fee, formed an exception to this\r\nrule. But the greater part of Ireland, in ownership, as distinguished\r\nfrom occupation, consisted of big estates, and a large number of the\r\nEnglish owners, being only a day's sail from England, became, by natural\r\ninstinct, habitual absentees. Others lived in Dublin and neglected their\r\nestates. Absenteeism, non-existent in America, assumed in Ireland the\r\nproportions of an enormous economic evil. In England the landlord was,\r\nand remains, a capitalist, providing a house and a fully equipped farm\r\nto the tenant. In Ireland he was a rent receiver pure and simple,\r\nunconnected with the occupier by any healthy bond, moral or economic.\r\nThe rent-receiving absentee involved a resident middleman, who\r\ncontracted to pay a stipulated rent to the absentee, and had to extract\r\nthat rent, plus a profit for himself, out of the occupiers, whether\r\nCatholic serfs, Protestant tenants, or both, and usually did so by\r\nsubdivision of holdings and disproportionate elevation of rents. Over\r\nthree of the four Provinces of Ireland--for a small part of Ulster was\r\ndifferently situated--the middleman himself frequently became an\r\nabsentee and farmed his agency to another middleman, who by further\r\nsubdivisions and extortions made an additional private profit, and who,\r\nin his turn, would create a subsidiary agency, until the land in many\r\ncases was \"subset six deep.\"[5] The ultimate occupier and sole creator\r\nof agricultural wealth lived perpetually on the verge of starvation,\r\nbeggared not only by extortionate rents, partly worked out in virtually\r\nforced labour, but by extortionate tithes paid to the alien Anglican\r\nChurch, in addition to the scanty dues willingly contributed to the\r\nhunted priests of his own prescribed religion. His resident upper\r\nclass--though we must allow for many honourable exceptions--was the\r\nSquirearchy, satirized by Arthur Young as petty despots with the vices\r\nof despots; idle, tyrannical, profligate, boorish, fit founders of the\r\nworst social system the modern civilized world has ever known. The\r\nslave-owning planters of Carolina were by no means devoid of similar\r\nfaults, which are the invariable products of arbitrary control over\r\nhuman beings, but there the physiological gulf between the dominant and\r\nsubject race was too broad and deep to permit of substantial\r\ndeterioration in the former. In Ireland the ethnological difference was\r\nsmall; the artificial cleavage and deterioration great in inverse\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nFor the greater part of a century, in every part of Ireland, tenancies\r\nof land, whether held by Catholic or Protestant, by lease or at will,\r\nwere alike in certain fundamental characteristics. The tenant had\r\nneither security of tenure nor right to the value of the improvements\r\nwhich were invariably made by his own capital and labour. Even a\r\nleaseholder, when his lease expired, had no prescriptive claim to\r\nrenewal, but must take his chance at a rent-auction with strangers, the\r\nfarm going to the highest bidder. If he lost, he was homeless and\r\npenniless, while the fruits of his labour and capital passed into other\r\nhands. The miserable Catholic cottier was, of course, in a similar case,\r\nthough relatively his hardship was less, since his condition, being the\r\nlowest possible in all circumstances, could scarcely be worse.\r\nObviously, in a case where the landlord was neither the capitalist nor\r\nthe protector and friend of the tenant, the possession of those\r\nelementary rights, security of tenure and compensation for improvements,\r\nwas the condition precedent to the growth of a sound agrarian system.\r\nTheir denial was incompatible with social order. Yet they were denied,\r\nand for one hundred and eighty years an intermittent struggle to obtain\r\nthem by violence and criminal conspiracy degraded and retarded Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut a marked distinction grew up between a small portion of Ireland and\r\nthe rest. James I.'s plantation of Ulster had been far more drastic and\r\nthorough than any operation of the kind before or since. Later\r\nimmigrants had flowed in, and at the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury in the north-eastern portion--the predominantly Protestant\r\nUlster of to-day--Scotch Protestant tenants, mainly Presbyterian, were\r\nthickly settled, and formed an industrious community of strong and\r\ntenacious temper. In the original leases granted by the concessionaires\r\nin the seventeenth century, fixity of tenure was implied, and a nominal\r\nrent levied, somewhat after the American model; but under the example of\r\nother Provinces, and the economic pressure exerted by the growth in the\r\nCatholic population, these privileges seem to have been almost wholly\r\nobliterated. The absentee landlords, reckless of social welfare, exacted\r\nthe rack or competitive rent. As in the south and west, tithes to the\r\nEstablished Church and oppressive and corrupt local taxation for roads\r\nand other purposes, aggravated the discontent. For agrarian reasons\r\nonly--and there were others which I shall mention--many thousands of\r\nProtestants left Ireland for ever. It required a long period of outrage\r\nand conspiracy, attaining in 1770 the proportions of a small civil war,\r\nand at the end of the century, by the anti-Catholic passions it\r\ninspired, wrecking new hopes of racial unity, to establish what came to\r\nbe known as the Ulster Custom of Tenant Right. If Protestant freemen had\r\nto resort to these demoralizing methods to obtain, and then only after\r\nirreparable damage to Ireland, the first condition of social stability,\r\na tolerable land system, the effect of the agrarian system on Catholic\r\nIreland, prostrate under the Penal Code, may be easily imagined.\r\n\r\nIn addition to excessive subdivision of holdings and excessive tithes,\r\nrents, and local burdens, another agrarian evil, unknown in the vast and\r\nthinly populated tracts of America intensified the misery of the Irish\r\npeasantry of the eighteenth century. This was the conversion of the best\r\nland from tillage into pasture, with the resulting clearances and\r\nmigrations, and the ultimate congestion on the worst land. Lecky quotes\r\na contemporary pamphlet, which speaks of the \"best arable land in the\r\nkingdom in immense tracts wantonly enjoyed by the cattle of a few\r\nindividuals, and at the same time the junctions of our highways and\r\nstreets crowded with shoals of mendicant fellow-creatures.\" This change\r\nfrom arable to pasture has been a common and often in the long run a\r\nhealthy, economic tendency in many countries, England and Scotland\r\nincluded, though temporarily a fruitful source of misery. Under normal\r\nconditions the immediate evils right themselves in course of time.\r\nNothing was normal in Ireland, and any breath of economic change in the\r\noutside world reacted cruelly on the wretched subject class, which\r\nproduced, though it did not enjoy, the greater part of the wealth of the\r\nkingdom. Under an accumulation of hardships famine was periodic, and\r\nfrom 1760, when the first Whiteboys appeared, disorder in one degree or\r\nanother was chronic. The motive, it is universally agreed now, was\r\nmaterial, not religious. The Whiteboys of the south and west were the\r\ncounterparts of the Protestant Steelboys and Oakboys of the north, and\r\neven in the south and west there were Protestant as well as Catholic\r\nWhiteboys. Lord Charlemont, the Protestant Irish statesman, denying this\r\nnow well-ascertained fact, was nevertheless explicit enough about the\r\ncause of the disorders. \"The real causes,\" he said, \"were ... exorbitant\r\nrents, low wages, want of employment, farms of enormous extent let by\r\ntheir rapacious and indolent proprietors to monopolizing land-jobbers,\r\nby whom small portions of them were again let and relet to intermediate\r\noppressors, and by them subdivided for five times their value among the\r\nwretched starvers upon potatoes and water; taxes yearly increasing, and\r\nstill more tithes, which the Catholic, without any possible benefit,\r\nunwillingly pays in addition to his priest's money ... misery,\r\noppression, and famine.\"[6]\r\n\r\nAgrarian crime, operating through an endless succession of secret\r\nsocieties, Whiteboys and Rightboys in the eighteenth century; Terry\r\nAlts, Rockites, Caravats, Ribbonmen, Moonlighters, in the nineteenth,\r\nwas rampant for nearly two centuries, long surviving the repeal of the\r\nPenal Code; and its last echoes may be heard at this moment. In the\r\nabsence of all wholesome law, violence and terror were the only means of\r\nself-defence. The remedy applied was retaliatory violence under forms of\r\nlaw. Nothing whatsoever was done to remove the essential vices of\r\nagrarian tenure during the eighteenth century; nothing tentative even\r\nduring the nineteenth century until the year 1870; nothing effective and\r\npermanent until 1881, when, as far as humanly possible, it was sought\r\nto give direct statutory expression to the Ulster Custom, with the\r\naddition of the principle of a fair judicial rent. Englishmen should\r\nrealize this when they discuss Irish character. It is a very old story,\r\nbut nine out of ten Englishmen, when talking vaguely of Irish\r\ndiscontent, disloyalty, and turbulence, forget, or have never learnt,\r\nthis and other fundamental facts. As for the Irish landlords, we must\r\nremember that the founders of that class differed in no respect from\r\nother English landlords, or from the aristocratic American\r\nconcessionaires, just as their compatriot tenants and lessees were\r\nidentical in stock with the American colonists. Their descendants and\r\nsuccessors have been the victims of circumstance. Each generation has\r\ninherited the vested interests of the last, and it is not in human\r\nnature to look far behind vested interests into the wrongful acts which\r\ncreated them and the bad laws that perpetuate them. Doubly victimized\r\nhave been those resident landlords who at all periods, from the earliest\r\nera of colonization, in spite of temptation and bad examples around\r\nthem, have acted towards their tenantry as humane and patriotic\r\ncitizens. A bad agrarian system infects the whole body politic. Good\r\nlandlords and contented tenants inevitably suffered with the rest.\r\n\r\nIn commerce and industry, as in land, the Irish Colony stood at a heavy\r\ndisadvantage by comparison with America. From the Restoration onward,\r\nEnglish statesmen took the same view of both dependencies, namely, that\r\ntheir commercial interests should be wholly subordinate to those of the\r\nMother Country, and the same Department, the Board of Trade and\r\nPlantations, made the fiscal regulations for Ireland and America. The\r\nold idea that for trade purposes Ireland counted as an integral part of\r\nthe United Kingdom did not last longer than 1663. But it was not wholly\r\nabrogated by the great Navigation Act of that year, which, though it\r\nplaced harsh restrictions on the Irish cattle trade with England, did\r\nnot expressly exclude Irish ships from the monopoly of the colonial\r\ntrade conferred upon English vessels, so that for seven years longer a\r\ntolerably prosperous business was carried on direct between Ireland and\r\nthe American Colonies.[7] An Act of 1670, prohibiting, with a few\r\nnegligible exceptions, all direct imports from the Colonies into\r\nIreland, gave a heavy check to this business, arrested the growth of\r\nIrish shipping, and, in conjunction with subsequent measures of\r\nnavigational, fiscal, and industrial repression, converted Ireland for a\r\ncentury into a kind of trade helot. She was treated either as a foreign\r\ncountry, as a Colony, or as something inferior to either, according to\r\nthe dictation of English interests, while possessing neither the\r\ncommercial independence of a foreign country nor the natural and\r\nindefeasible immunity which distance, climate, variety of soil, and\r\nunlimited room for expansion continued to confer, in spite of all\r\ncoercive restraints, upon the American Colonies. Though the British\r\ntrade monopoly was certainly a contributory cause in promoting the\r\nAmerican revolution, it was never, any more than the British claim to\r\ntax, a severe practical grievance. The prohibition of the export of\r\nmanufactures, and the compulsory reciprocal exchange of colonial natural\r\nproducts for British manufactured goods and the chartered merchandise of\r\nthe Orient, were not very onerous restrictions for young communities\r\nsettled in virgin soil; nor, with a few exceptions like raw wool, whose\r\nexport was forbidden, were the American natural products of a kind which\r\ncould compete with those of the Mother Country. The real damage\r\ninflicted upon the Colonies by the mercantile system--one which its\r\nmodern defenders are apt to forget--was moral. To practise and condone\r\nsmuggling was habitual in America, and some of the English Governors set\r\nthe worst example of all by making a profit out of connivance at the\r\nillicit traffic. \"Graft\" was their creation. The moral mischief done was\r\npermanent, and it resembled in a lesser degree the mischief done in\r\nIreland both by bad agrarian and bad commercial laws. Ireland, owing to\r\nher proximity, was in the unhappy position of being a competitor in the\r\ngreat staples of trade, both raw and manufactured, and she was near\r\nenough and weak enough to render it easy to stamp out this competition\r\nso far as it was thought to be inimical to English interests. The cattle\r\nand provision trade with England had been damaged as far back as 1663,\r\nand was killed in 1666, though the export of provisions to foreign\r\ncountries survived, and became almost the sole source of Irish trade\r\nduring the eighteenth century. The policy with raw wool was to admit\r\njust as much as would satisfy the English weavers without arousing the\r\ndetermined opposition of the competitive English graziers. The Irish\r\nmanufactured wool trade, a flourishing business, for which Irishmen\r\nshowed exceptionally high aptitude, and which in the normal course of\r\nthings would probably have become her staple industry, was destroyed\r\naltogether, avowedly in the interests of the English staple industry, by\r\nprohibitory export duties imposed in 1698. Subsidiary\r\nindustries--cotton, glass, brewing, sugar-refining, sail-cloth, hempen\r\nrope, and salt--were successively strangled. One manufacture alone, that\r\nof linen, centred in the Protestant North, was spared, and for a short\r\nperiod was even encouraged, not because it was a Protestant industry,\r\nbut because at first it aroused no trade jealousy in England, and was in\r\nsome respects serviceable to her. In 1708, when it was proposed to\r\nextend the industry to Leinster, considerations of foreign trade\r\nprovoked an outburst of hostility, and harassing restrictions were\r\nimposed on this industry also. On the whole, however, it suffered less\r\nthan the rest, and lived to become one of the two important\r\nmanufacturing industries of present-day Ireland.\r\n\r\nEnglish policy was as fatuous as it was cruel. Numbers of the Irish\r\nmanufacturers and artisans, both Catholic and Protestant, emigrated to\r\nEurope, and devoted their skill and energy to strengthening industries\r\nwhich competed with those of England. Within Ireland, since industry and\r\ncommerce formed the one outlet left by the Penal Code for Catholic\r\nbrains and capital--though even here the Code imposed harassing\r\ndisabilities--the commercial restrictions completed the ruin of the\r\nproscribed sect. But at this period the main source of weakness to\r\nIreland, of strength to America, and of danger to the Empire as a whole,\r\nwas the Protestant emigration. Lecky estimates that 12,000 Protestant\r\nfamilies in Dublin and 30,000 in the rest of the country were ruined by\r\nthe suppression of the wool trade. The great majority of these\r\nProtestants were Presbyterians belonging to North-East Ulster, and\r\ndescendants of the men who had defended that Province with such\r\ndesperate gallantry against the Irish insurgents under the deposed James\r\nII. Political power in Ireland was wielded in the interests of a small\r\nterritorial and Episcopalian aristocracy, largely absentee. The\r\nDissenters belonged to the middle and lower classes, and were for the\r\nmost part tenants or artisans. Creed and caste antipathies were combined\r\nagainst them. Their value as citizens was ignored. Though their right to\r\nworship was legally recognized by an Act of 1719, they remained from\r\n1704 to 1778 subject to the Test, were incapacitated for all public\r\nemployment, and were forbidden to open schools. Under an accumulation of\r\nagrarian, economic, and religious disabilities, they naturally left\r\nIreland to find freedom in America. And it is beyond question that they\r\nturned the scale against the British arms in the great War of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Class C. in Sir William Anson's classification, \"Law and Custom of\r\nthe Constitution,\" p. 253.\r\n\r\n[5] J. Fisher, \"End of the Irish Parliament\" cited.\r\n\r\n[6] MS. Autobiography cited by Lecky, vol. ii., p. 35.\r\n\r\n[7] The best modern account of the commercial relations of Great Britain\r\nMid Ireland is Miss Murray's \"Commercial Relations between England and\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nREVOLUTION IN AMERICA AND IN IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Old World and in the New, therefore, two societies, composed of\r\nhuman beings similar in all essential respects, were growing up under\r\nthe protection of the British Crown; the one servile, the other free;\r\nthe one stagnant where it was not retrograde, the other prosperous,\r\nprogressive, and, by the magnetism of its own freedom, progress, and\r\nprosperity, steadily draining its Irish fellow of talent, energy, and\r\nindustrial skill.\r\n\r\nWhat was the ultimate cause of this glaring divergency? Religion, as a\r\nspiritual force, was not the root cause. The American Colonies, with\r\nthree exceptions--the earliest Virginia, the latest Georgia, and the\r\nCatholic community of Maryland--were formed by Dissenters,[8] exiles\r\nthemselves from persecution, but not necessarily forbearing to others,\r\nand, in the case of the New England Puritans, bitterly intolerant. It is\r\ninteresting to observe that the Quakers and the Catholics, men standing\r\nat the opposite poles of theology, set the highest example of tolerance.\r\nQuaker Pennsylvania enforced absolute liberty of conscience, and Quakers\r\nin all the Provinces worked for religious harmony and freedom. Catholic\r\nMaryland, as long as its government remained in Catholic hands, and\r\nunder the guidance of the wise and liberal Proprietary, Lord Baltimore,\r\npursued the same policy, and attracted members of sects persecuted in\r\nNew England.[9] The parallel with Ireland is significant. At the end of\r\nthe seventeenth century, when a quarrel was raging between the Crown and\r\nMassachusetts over the persecution of Quakers in that Colony, and for a\r\nfurther period in the eighteenth century, Quaker missionaries and\r\nsettlers were conducting a campaign of revivalism in Ireland with no\r\nmolestation from the Catholics, though with intermittent obstruction\r\nfrom magistrates and Protestant clergy. Wesleyans received the same\r\nsympathetic treatment.[10] The tolerance shown by Irish Catholics, in\r\nspite of terrible provocation, is acknowledged by all reputable\r\nhistorians. Nor was Protestant intolerance, whether Anglican or\r\nNonconformist, of a deeper dogmatic shade than anywhere else in the\r\nKing's dominions. But in Ireland it was political, economic, and social,\r\nwhile in America it was purely theological, and, moreover, purely\r\nAmerican. The Episcopalian ascendancy in Ireland represented foreign\r\ninterests, and therefore struck against Dissent as well as against\r\nPopery, and estranged both. The root of the American trouble, leading to\r\nthe separation of the Colonies, was political and wholly unconnected\r\nwith religion. The root of the Irish trouble, adventitiously connected\r\nwith religion, lay, and lies still, in the Irish political system. Other\r\nevils were transient and curable; this was permanent. The Penal Code was\r\neventually relaxed; the disabilities of the Dissenters were eventually\r\nremoved; the commercial servitude was abolished, but the political\r\nsystem _in essentials_ has never been changed. Let us see what it was\r\nand how it worked at the period we are considering, again by comparison\r\nwith America.\r\n\r\nThough the word \"plantation\" was applied alike to the colonization of\r\nIreland and America, Ireland was never called a Colony, but a Kingdom.\r\nThe distinction was not scientific, and operated, like all other\r\ndistinctions, to the injury of Ireland. Neither country was represented\r\nin the British Parliament. In both countries the representatives of the\r\nCrown were appointed by England, and controlled, in America almost\r\ncompletely, in Ireland absolutely, the Executive and Judges. In Ireland\r\nthe Viceroy was always an Englishman; in America, the Governors of a few\r\nof the non-proprietary Colonies were colonials, but most Governors were\r\nEnglish, and some of the proprietary class were absentees.[11] In the\r\ncase both of Ireland and America the English Government claimed a\r\nsuperior right of control over legislation and taxation, and in both\r\ncases it was found necessary to remove all doubts as to this right by\r\npassing Declaratory Acts, for Ireland in 1719, for America in 1766. The\r\ngreat difference lay in the Legislature, and was the result of different\r\ndegrees of remoteness from the seat of power. America was profoundly\r\ndemocratic from the beginning, outpacing the Mother Country by fully two\r\ncenturies. There was no aristocracy, and in most Colonies little\r\ndistinction between upper and middle classes. The popular Assemblies,\r\nelected on the broadest possible franchise, were truly representative.\r\nSome of the Legislative Councils, or Upper Chambers, were elective also.\r\nMost of them, although nominated, and therefore inclined to be hostile\r\nto the popular body, were nevertheless of identical social composition;\r\nso that there was often an official, but never a caste, ascendancy. From\r\nvery early times there was occasional friction between the Home\r\nGovernment, represented by the Governors, and the colonial democracies,\r\nover such matters as taxation, official salaries, quartering of troops,\r\nand navigation laws. Writs of _quo warranto_ were issued against\r\nConnecticut, Carolina, New York, and Maryland, in the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century, and the Charter of Massachusetts, after long\r\nwrangles with the Crown, was forfeited in 1684, and not restored until\r\n1692, after a period of despotic government under Sir Edmund Andros. But\r\nfor a century or more the system worked well enough upon the whole.\r\nUnder the powerful lever of the representative Assembly, neutralized by\r\nthe ever-present need for military protection from the Mother Country,\r\nand with the wholesome check to undue coercion set by the broad\r\nAtlantic, civic freedom grew and flourished to a degree unknown in any\r\nother part of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland civic freedom was unknown. There was no popular Assembly. A\r\nwealthy aristocracy of English extraction and of Anglican faith, partly\r\nresident, partly absentee, and wholly subservient to the English\r\nGovernment, constituted the Upper House of that strange institution\r\nknown as Parliament, and to a great extent nominated and controlled the\r\nLower House through means frankly corrupt. Representation was almost\r\nnominal; close pocket-boroughs predominated, and seats were bought and\r\nsold in the open market. In the year 1790 more than a third of the\r\nMembers of the House of Commons were placemen, 216 Members out of 300\r\nwere elected by boroughs and manors, and, of these, 176 were elected by\r\nindividual patrons. Fifty-three of these patrons, nominating 123\r\nMembers, sat as Peers in the Upper House. Cash, places, and peerages,\r\nwere the usual considerations paid for maintaining a Government\r\nmajority. The Catholics, from three-quarters to five-sixths of the\r\npopulation, had neither votes nor members; the Dissenters scarcely any\r\nmembers and an almost powerless vote. The Irish Legislature, by an Act\r\nas old as 1495, the famous Poynings' Law, could neither initiate nor\r\npass a measure without the consent of the English Privy Council, and the\r\nDeclaratory Act of 1719 confirmed the power of making English Acts\r\napplicable to Ireland. Government in England itself was, no doubt,\r\nunrepresentative and corrupt at that period, and the people paid the\r\npenalty in full; but it was a national government, under the aegis of\r\nthe national faith, and resting, however remotely, on the ultimate\r\nsanction of the people, just as American opinion, more democratically\r\nascertained, continued to control the major part of American affairs. In\r\nIreland the Government was systematically anti-Irish. There was no\r\ncareer for Irishmen in Ireland. Both Catholics and Dissenters were\r\nexcluded from all civil and military offices; the highest posts were\r\ngenerally given to Englishmen born and bred, and the country,\r\nEpiscopalian only to a fractional extent, was ruled by a narrow\r\nEpiscopalian oligarchy of wealthy landowners and prelates, who bartered\r\nIrish freedom for the place and power of their own families and\r\ndependents. The conditions of this sordid exchange were the ground of\r\nthe first important Anglo-Irish political struggle in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when the English Viceroy, Townshend, succeeded in 1770-71, at\r\nthe cost of half a million, in transferring the bribing power, and\r\ntherefore the controlling power, from the \"Undertakers,\" as they were\r\nknown, direct to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no continuous English policy beyond that of\r\nmaking Ireland completely subservient to English interests and purposes,\r\nand often to purposes of the most humiliating and degrading kind. The\r\nIrish Pension List has earned immortal infamy. Jobs too scandalous to\r\npass muster in England were systematically foisted upon the Irish\r\nestablishment. Royal mistresses, a host of needy Germans, a Danish Queen\r\nbanished for adultery, lived in England or abroad upon incomes drawn\r\nfrom the impoverished Irish Exchequer. Nor was it only a question of\r\npensions. Quantities of valuable sinecure offices were habitually given\r\nto Englishmen who never came near the shores of Ireland. In short, the\r\nEnglish policy towards Ireland was similar to Spain's policy towards her\r\nSouth American Colonies, minus the grosser forms of physical cruelty and\r\noppression. Yet Ireland, like the American Colonies until the verge of\r\nthe revolutionary struggle, was consistently loyal to the Crown both in\r\npeace and war. The loyalty of Catholic Ireland, poverty-stricken,\r\ninarticulate, almost leaderless, and shamefully misgoverned, does not,\r\nfrom the human standpoint, appear worthy of admiration, but it was a\r\nfact. The few Catholic noblemen outdid the Protestants in expressions of\r\ndevotion; the Whiteboy risings were as little disloyal as religious. Not\r\na hand stirred for James or his heirs when Jacobite plots and risings\r\nwere causing grave public danger in England and Scotland. Catholic Lord\r\nTrimleston offered exclusively Catholic regiments with Catholic officers\r\nto George III. for foreign service in 1762, though they were vetoed by\r\nwhat his Viceroy Halifax called the \"ill-bred bigotry\" of the Irish\r\nParliament. Nor was it till thirty years after that date that Protestant\r\ndiscontent, under intolerable provocation, assumed an anti-dynastic and\r\nRepublican form. To compare the Imperial spirit displayed by America and\r\nIreland in their views and action is difficult, partly because the\r\nvarious American Colonies differed widely, partly because there existed\r\nin Ireland no organ of government which could express popular feeling.\r\nNeither country, of course, paid any cash contribution to Imperial\r\nexpenses, though both could fairly claim that the English monopoly of\r\ntrade imposed an indirect tribute of indefinite size, while Ireland, in\r\npensions, rents to absentees, and sinecure appointments, was drained of\r\nmany millions more. American patronage was an element of substantial\r\nvalue to England, but it was not on the Irish scale. America on the\r\nwhole, perhaps, showed less patriotic feeling than Ireland. With full\r\nallowance for the lack of sympathy and understanding shown by the\r\nBritish regulars to the American volunteers in their co-operation in the\r\nFrench wars, it can scarcely be denied that the colonists, together with\r\nmuch heroism and public spirit, showed occasional slackness and\r\nparsimony in resisting the penetration of a foreign Power which\r\nthreatened to hem in their settlements from the St. Lawrence to the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi. Ireland during the Seven Years' War, and until\r\nthe Peace of Paris in 1763, maintained a war establishment of 24,000\r\ntroops. She maintained a peace establishment of 12,000 troops, and from\r\n1767 onwards of 15,000 troops. There never seems to have been a whisper\r\nof protest from the Catholic population against these measures, nor,\r\nexcept in the matter of the American War, to which we shall come\r\npresently, from the Protestants. It may be added that, after 1767,\r\nCatholics in considerable numbers were surreptitiously enlisted in the\r\nranks, in spite of the Penal Code, and from then until the present day\r\nhave fought for the Flag as staunchly as any other class of the King's\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to responsible English statesmen that here was ground,\r\nfirm as a rock in America, and firm enough in Ireland, on which, if only\r\nthey obeyed the instincts and maxims upon which England herself had\r\nrisen to greatness, they might build a mighty and durable Imperial\r\nstructure. That loyalty, to be genuine and lasting, must spring from\r\nliberty was a truth they did not appreciate, and to this truth,\r\nstrangely enough, in spite of the lessons of nearly a century and a\r\nhalf, a numerous school of English statesmen is still blind. It was no\r\ndoubt a fatality that the smouldering discontent both of America and\r\nIreland burst into flame in the reign of a monarch who endeavoured, even\r\nwithin the limits of Britain, to regain the arbitrary power which had\r\ncost their throne to the Stuarts; it was an additional fatality that the\r\nstandard of public morals among the class through which he ruled during\r\nthe period of crisis had fallen to lower depths than ever before or\r\nsince. Even incorruptible men were either weak and selfish or subject to\r\nsome cardinal defect of temper or intellect which, at times of crisis,\r\nneutralized their genius. Chatham and Burke were the noblest figures of\r\nthe time, yet Chatham, in his highest mood a nobler and truer champion\r\nof American liberty than Burke, was Minister--nominally, at any\r\nrate--when the Revenue Duties imposed upon the American Colonies in 1867\r\ndestroyed in a moment the reconciliation brought about by the repeal of\r\nthe Stamp Act. Burke was surely false to his political philosophy in\r\nfounding his American argument on expedience rather than on principle.\r\nChatham was a thorough democrat, trusting the people, poor or rich, rude\r\nor cultured, common or noble, American or British. Burke, at a time when\r\nthe reflection of the genuine opinion of the nation in a pure and free\r\nParliament might have saved us, as his splendid orations could not save\r\nus, from a disastrous war, scouted Parliamentary reform, and took his\r\nunconscious share in playing the game of the most narrow coercionist\r\nTories like Charles Townshend and George III.\r\n\r\nOf the interminable chain of fatalities which sicken the mind in\r\nfollowing every phase of Ireland's history, Burke's rigid temperamental\r\nconservatism always seems to me the most fatal and the most melancholy.\r\nIt is not that he, the greatest intellect Ireland has ever produced,\r\nmade his career in England. By the time one reaches the period in which\r\nhe lived one gets used to the expatriation of Irish brains and vigour,\r\nnot only to England and America, but to Spain, France, Russia, and\r\nGermany. It is that his intellect was so constituted as in the long run\r\nto be useless, and on some occasions absolutely harmful, to Ireland,\r\nsincerely as he loved her, and often as he supported measures for her\r\ntemporary benefit, and rejoiced in their temporary success. An incident\r\noccurred in 1773 which tested his worth to Ireland, and incidentally\r\nthrew into strong light English views of Ireland and America at the\r\nperiod immediately preceding the revolutionary epoch. The Irish\r\nGovernment, not with any high social aim, but in desperation at the\r\ngrowing Treasury deficit, proposed a tax upon the rents of absentee\r\nlandlords, and the fate of the measure, like all Irish measures, had to\r\nbe decided in the first instance in England. North's Tory Ministry\r\nactually consented to it. Chatham, far from the active world, and too\r\nbroken in health to influence policy either way, wrote a powerful plea\r\nfor it; but a strong group of Whig magnates, themselves wealthy absentee\r\nproprietors of Irish land, signed a vehement remonstrance which carried\r\nthe day against it, and the author of this remonstrance, of all men in\r\nthe world, was the Irishman Burke, who, owning not an acre of Irish land\r\nhimself, devoted all his transcendent talents, all the subtlety and\r\nvariety of his reasoning, to clothing the selfish greed of others with\r\nthe garb of an enlightened patriotism.\r\n\r\nHe was wrong fundamentally about Ireland, and only superficially right\r\nabout America. In the terms of this celebrated remonstrance, as\r\nilluminated by his own private correspondence, his consistency is\r\nrevealed. By the very nature of things, he maintained, the central\r\nParliament of a great heterogeneous Empire must exercise a supreme\r\nsuperintending power and regulate the polity and economy of the several\r\nparts as they relate to one another, a principle which, of course, would\r\nhave justified the taxation of America, and which, save on the ground of\r\nexpediency alone, he would certainly have applied to America. The\r\nproximity of Ireland helped his logic, and surely logic was never\r\ndistorted to stranger ends. The \"ordinary residence\" of the threatened\r\nIrish landowners was in England, \"to which country they were attached,\r\nnot only by the ties of birth and early habit, but also by those of\r\nindisputable public duties,\" as though these facts did not constitute in\r\nthemselves a damning satire on the system of Irish Government. They were\r\nto be \"fined\" for living in England, as though that fine were not the\r\nmost just and politic which could be conceived, if it went even an inch\r\ntowards establishing the principle that Ireland's affairs were the\r\nbusiness of responsible resident Irishmen, or towards the further\r\nprinciple, enshrined in Drummond's celebrated phrase of seventy years\r\nlater in regard to the agrarian system which these Whig noblemen shared\r\nin founding, that \"property has its duties as well as its rights.\"\r\nFinally, argued Burke, heaping irony upon irony, the tax would lead\r\ndirectly to the \"separation\" of the two Kingdoms both in interest and\r\naffection. The Colonies would follow the Irish example, and thus a\r\nprinciple of disunion and separation would pervade the whole Empire; the\r\nbonds of common interest, knowledge, and sympathy which now knit it\r\ntogether would everywhere be loosened, and a narrow, insulated, local\r\nfeeling and policy would be proportionately increased.[12] Such was\r\nBurke's Imperialism, as evoked by an Irish measure which struck at the\r\nroot of a frightful social evil and of a vicious political system. But\r\nthe idea expressed by Burke--the spirit of his whole argument--went far\r\nbeyond this particular absentee tax or any similar tax proposed, as\r\nhappened in one instance, by a Colony. It was the superbly grandiose\r\nexpression, and all the more insidiously seductive in that it was so\r\ngrandiose, of a principle which all thinking men now know, or ought to\r\nknow, is the negation of Empire, which lost us America, which came\r\nwithin an ace of losing us Canada, which might well have lost us South\r\nAfrica, and which has in very fact lost us, though not yet irrevocably,\r\nthe \"affection,\" to use Burke's word, of Ireland. We may call local\r\npatriotism \"narrow and insulated,\" if we please, but we recognize now,\r\nin every case save that of Ireland, that it is the only foundation for,\r\nand the only stimulant to, Imperial patriotism.\r\n\r\nChatham, an Englishman of the English, was nevertheless a better\r\nIrishman than Burke, and therefore a better Imperialist. \"The tax,\" he\r\nwrote, \"was founded on strong Irish policy. England, it is evident,\r\nprofits by draining Ireland of the vast incomes spent here from that\r\ncountry. But I could not, as a Peer of England, advise the King, on\r\nprinciples of indirect, accidental English policy, to reject a tax on\r\nabsentees sent over here as the genuine desire of the Commons of Ireland\r\nacting in their proper and peculiar sphere, and exercising their\r\ninherent exclusive right by raising supplies in the manner they judge\r\nbest.\" Chatham, in short, applied precisely the same argument to Ireland\r\nas, in his memorable speeches of the next year (1774), he applied to\r\nAmerica, and in both cases he was right. The only mistake he made was in\r\nhis estimate of that travesty of a representative assembly, the Irish\r\nHouse of Commons, which, at the secret instigation of the Viceroy,\r\nthough without actual coercion, eventually threw out a tax so\r\ndistasteful to its English patrons. But the argument for financial\r\nindependence remained unassailable, and eventually the Irish Parliament\r\nitself summoned up the courage to adopt and act upon it.\r\n\r\nIt may seem almost impossible that in a body so corrupt and exclusive a\r\nnational sentiment should have arisen. But every elective assembly,\r\nhowever badly constituted, contains the seeds of its own regeneration,\r\nand, under even moderately favourable circumstances, moves irresistibly\r\ntowards freedom. The pity was that circumstances, save for one brief and\r\ninvigorating interlude, were persistently unfavourable to Ireland. The\r\ntask was enormous, demanding infinitely more self-sacrifice than even\r\nthe ablest and most prescient of her Parliamentarians realized. Until it\r\nwas too late, in fact, they never awoke to the true nature of the task,\r\ndazzled by illusory victories. Rotten to the core as the Irish\r\nParliament was, they sought, strengthened by popular influences, to make\r\nit the instrument for freeing Ireland from a paralyzing servitude; and\r\nup to a point they succeeded, but they did not see that the only\r\nsecurity for real and permanent success was to reform the Parliament\r\nitself. There the inveterate spirit of creed and class ascendancy,\r\nresting in the last resort on English military power, survived long\r\nenough to nullify their efforts.\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution and the Irish revolutionary renaissance--the one\r\nachieved by a long and bitter war, the other without\r\nbloodshed--originated and culminated together, were derived from the\r\nsame sources, and ran their course in close connection. In Ireland the\r\nmovement was exclusively Protestant, in America unsectarian; but in both\r\ncases finance was the lever of emancipation. America, resenting the\r\ncommercial restrictions imposed by the Mother Country, but not, until\r\npassion had obscured all landmarks, contesting their abstract justice,\r\nand suffering no great material harm from their incidence, fought for\r\nthe principle of self-taxation--a principle which did, of course,\r\nlogically include, as the Americans instinctively felt, that of\r\ncommercial freedom. Ireland, harassed by commercial restrictions far\r\nmore onerous, naturally regarded their abolition as vital, and the\r\ncontrol of internal taxation as subsidiary. Apart from concrete\r\ngrievances, both countries had to fear an unlimited extension of British\r\nclaims founded on the all-embracing Declaratory Acts of 1719 and 1766.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for herself, Ireland for seventy years or more had been\r\nsteadily supplying America with the human elements of resistance in\r\ntheir most energetic and independent form, and robbing herself\r\nproportionately Approximately, how many Protestants belonging mainly to\r\nUlster, whether through eviction from the land, industrial unemployment,\r\nor disgust at social and political ostracism, left Ireland for America\r\nin the course of the eighteenth century, it is impossible to say; but\r\nthe number, both relatively to population and relatively to the total\r\nemigration, Catholic and Protestant, to all parts of the world, was\r\nundoubtedly very large. Mr. Egerton, in his \"Origin and Growth of the\r\nEnglish Colonies,\" reckons that in 1775 a sixth part of the thirteen\r\ninsurrectionary Colonies was composed of Scots-Irish exiles from Ulster,\r\nand that half the Protestant population of that Province emigrated to\r\nthose Colonies between 1730 and 1770. As the crisis approached,\r\nemigration became an exodus. Thirty thousand of the farming class are\r\nsaid to have been driven west by the wholesale evictions of the early\r\nseventies, and ten thousand weavers followed them during the disastrous\r\ndepression in the linen trade caused by interruption of commerce with\r\nAmerica. The majority went to the northern Colonies, especially\r\nPennsylvania, took from the first a vehement stand against the Royal\r\nclaims, and supplied some of Washington's best soldiers. A minority went\r\nto the backwoods of Virginia, Maryland, and Carolina, and were little\r\nheard of until as late in the war as 1780, when Tarleton began his\r\nanti-guerilla campaign in the South. Then they woke up, and became, like\r\ntheir compatriots of the North, formidable and implacable foes.\r\n\r\nIreland and America, therefore, embarked on their struggle with the\r\nEnglish Parliament in close sympathy. The treatise of Molyneux on Irish\r\nliberty was read with wide approval in America. Franklin visited and\r\nencouraged the Irish patriots, and the Americans in 1775 issued a\r\nspecial address to them, asserting an identity of interest. Chatham, on\r\nthe eve of war, dwelt strongly in the House of Lords upon the same\r\nidentity of interest, and in doing so expressly coupled together Irish\r\nCatholics and Protestants.\r\n\r\nAlthough united by interest and sentiment, Ireland and America entered\r\non the struggle under widely varying conditions. The American Colonies\r\nwere thirteen separate units, with only a rude organization for common\r\naction, and in each of these units there existed a cleavage of opinion,\r\nbased neither on class nor creed, between rebels and loyalists. In spite\r\nof this weakness, the revolt was thoroughly national in the sense that\r\nit was organized and maintained through the State Assemblies, resting on\r\na broad popular franchise. In Ireland, unbought and unofficial opinion\r\nwas united against England. On the other hand, there was no national\r\nLegislature; only an enslaved and unrepresentative Legislature, tempered\r\nby a band of exceptionally brilliant and upright men, and continually\r\nthrust forward in spite of itself into bold and independent action by\r\nunconstitutional pressure from the unrepresented elements outside.\r\nSuccess so won, as we shall see, was delusive.\r\n\r\nWe may note two important additional circumstances: first, the dense\r\nmist of ignorance in which, and largely in consequence of which, England\r\nbegan her quarrel both with America and Ireland. The average Englishman\r\nwas probably even more ignorant of Ireland, which was sixty miles away,\r\nthan of America, which was three thousand miles away. I am not at all\r\nsure that that fact is not true still. At any rate, it was true then.\r\nYet knowledge of Ireland was more necessary, because her condition was\r\nbad in ways unknown in America. In all the essentials of material\r\nwell-being, America was supremely fortunate, while Ireland was in the\r\ndepths of misery. It is not that this misery went undescribed or\r\nunlamented, or that it was not realized by a small number of Englishmen.\r\nSome of the most famous writings of the time, from the mordant satire of\r\nSwift to the learned and elaborate diagnosis of Arthur Young, laid bare\r\nthe hideous ravages wrought by misrule in Ireland; but they had little\r\nor no effect upon English statesmen, and were unread by the only classes\r\nfrom which, if they had had knowledge, proper practical sympathy might\r\nhave come. Until Townshend's Viceroyalty (1767-1772) most of the Irish\r\nViceroys were absentees for the greater part of their term of office,\r\nleaving the conduct of Irish affairs to English Bishops and Judges, the\r\nwisest and most humane of whom could make little or no impression on\r\nEnglish official indifference. American Governors were at any rate\r\nresident, or mainly resident, and a few were good and popular\r\nadministrators, though the information which most of them supplied to\r\nthe Home Government showed a blindness to what was going on under their\r\nvery eyes which would be incomprehensible if we did not know by\r\nexperience that it is the invariable result of irresponsible rule over\r\nwhite men, whether at home or abroad. If, without the presence of race\r\ndistinctions, it needed Parliamentary reform in England itself to force\r\nthe ruling class to study with real sympathy the needs, character, and\r\ndesires of their own people, naturally the same ruling class, sending\r\nout its own members or dependents to America, obtained the most\r\ngrotesquely distorted notions of what Americans were and what they\r\nwanted or resented. \"Their office,\" wrote Franklin of the Governors,[13]\r\n\"makes them indolent, their indolence makes them odious, and, being\r\nconscious that they are hated, they become malicious. Their malice urges\r\nthem to continual abuse of the inhabitants in their letters to\r\nAdministration, representing them as disaffected and rebellious, and (to\r\nencourage the use of severity) as weak, divided, timid, and cowardly.\r\nGovernment believes all, thinks it necessary to support and countenance\r\nits officers,\" etc. The same spirit pervades the official correspondence\r\nof even the best Irish Viceroys of the eighteenth century, and\r\nultimately had a far more disastrous effect in that there were at all\r\ntimes in Ireland ancient elements of social dissension which needed only\r\nskilful fomentation by her English rulers to ruin all hopes of\r\nreconciliation and unity. That phase was to come after the first Irish\r\nvictories. For the present the system--for it can scarcely be called a\r\npolicy--was to irritate all Irishmen and all Americans alike,\r\nirrespective of creed, class, or sentiment, and thus to create on each\r\nside of the Atlantic that dangerous phenomenon, an united people.\r\n\r\nThe other noticeable point, admirably described by Mr. Holland in his\r\n\"Imperium et Libertas,\" is the confusion of political ideas in regard to\r\nthe status of white dependencies--a confusion greatly augmented by\r\nloose and misleading analogies with India and the tropical Colonies.\r\nEven a genius like Burke, as I have already pointed out, was misled.\r\nChatham came nearest to the truth, but, naturally, the actual outbreak\r\nof war with America checked his political thinking, and threw him back\r\non the bare doctrine of supremacy, right or wrong. It was not fully\r\nunderstood that there must be a radical difference between the\r\ngovernment of places settled and populated by white colonists and of\r\nplaces merely exploited by white traders. All the prerogatives of the\r\nCrown and Parliament were theoretically valid over both classes of\r\ndependency, and to abandon any of them seemed to most men of that day to\r\nbe inconsistent with Imperial supremacy. Honest and fair-minded\r\npoliticians and thinkers tried in vain to reconcile local freedom with\r\nImperial unity. We have the key now, though we have made no use of it in\r\nIreland; but most of our forefathers not only had no glimmering of the\r\ntruth when the fratricidal war began, but learnt nothing from the war\r\nitself, and remained unenlightened for sixty years more. If the\r\nrenunciation in 1778 of the right to tax the Colonies, and the\r\nnegotiations founded thereon, had led to a peace, it is quite certain\r\nthat friction would have subsequently arisen on other points. The idea\r\nof what we now know as \"responsible government\" was unknown. Short of\r\ncoercive war, there seemed to be only two altogether logical\r\nalternatives--complete separation and legislative Union. America\r\nobtained the one, Ireland was eventually to undergo the other; but it is\r\ninteresting to remember that suggestions, rejected by Franklin as\r\nuseless, were made for the representation of the American Colonies in\r\nthe English Parliament, just as suggestions for a legislative Union\r\nbetween Ireland and England appeared intermittently all through the\r\neighteenth century, long before such a Union was a question of practical\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nI need only briefly summarize the incidents which ended in the year 1782\r\nwith the final loss of the American Colonies, and the simultaneous\r\nachievement by Ireland of an apparent legislative independence. To take\r\nAmerica first, the Stamp Act was passed in 1765, and, thanks to the\r\ntumult it created, repealed by the Whigs in 1766, though the Declaratory\r\nAct which accompanied the repeal neutralized its good results. The new\r\nRevenue Duties on glass, paper, painters' colours, and tea were imposed\r\nin 1767, reviving the old irritation, and all but that on tea were\r\nremoved, after a period of growing friction, in 1770. Another\r\ncomparative lull was succeeded by fresh disorder when in 1773 the East\r\nIndia Company was permitted to send tea direct to America, and Boston\r\ncelebrated its historic \"tea-party.\" The coercion of Massachusetts\r\nfollowed, with Gage as despotic Military Governor, and, as a result, all\r\nthe Colonies were galvanized into unity. In September, 1774, the\r\nContinental Congress met, framed a Declaration of Rights, and obtained a\r\ngeneral agreement to cease from all commerce with Britain until\r\ngrievances were redressed. Fresh coercion having been applied, war broke\r\nout in 1775. The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776,\r\nby John Hancock, President of Congress and the descendant of an Ulster\r\nexile, and was first read aloud in Philadelphia by Captain John Nixon,\r\nthe son of an evicted Wexford farmer. Another Irishman, General\r\nMontgomery, led the invasion of Canada.[14] The war, with manifold\r\nvicissitudes, dragged on for eight years; but the surrender of\r\nCornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, virtually ended the physical\r\nstruggle, while the resolution of the House of Commons on February 27,\r\n1782, against the further prosecution of hostilities, ended the contest\r\nof principle.\r\n\r\nThe turning-point had been the intervention of the French in 1778, and\r\nthe same event was to turn the scale in Ireland. There, for many years\r\npast, the public finances had been sinking into a more and more\r\nscandalous condition. Taxation was by no means heavy, but pensions and\r\nsinecures multiplied, and the debt swelled. Inevitably there grew up\r\nwithin Parliament a small independent opposition which would not be\r\nbribed into conniving at the ruin of Ireland, while even bought placemen\r\nwere stung into throwing their votes into the Irish rather than the\r\nEnglish scale. Frequent efforts were made to use the insufficiency of\r\nthe hereditary revenue as a lever for gaining control of finance and for\r\nobtaining domestic reform. An Octennial Act, passed in 1768, went a\r\nlittle way towards transforming Parliament from a permanent privileged\r\nCommittee, under the control of the Executive, into the semblance at\r\nleast of a free Assembly, and the first dissolution under this Act, in\r\n1776, produced the famous Parliament which, though elected on the same\r\nnarrow and corrupt basis as before, in the space of six years first\r\nadmitted the principle of toleration for all creeds, and wrested from\r\nEnglish hands commercial and legislative autonomy. It came too late to\r\navert--if, indeed, it could ever have averted--the implication of\r\nIreland in the American War, its predecessor of 1775 having, in defiance\r\nof Irish opinion, subscribed an Address to the Crown, expressing\r\n\"abhorrence\" of the American revolt and \"inviolable attachment to the\r\njust rights\" of the King's Government, and having obediently voted four\r\nthousand Irish troops for the war.\r\n\r\nNor, for all the impassioned eloquence of Grattan and Hussey Burgh, did\r\nthe real driving-power of the new Parliament come from within its own\r\nranks, but from the unrepresented multitude outside. A clause removing\r\nthe test from Dissenters was struck out of the Catholic Relief Act of\r\n1778, mainly owing to dictation from England, but partly from resentment\r\nagainst Presbyterian sympathy with the American cause. It was only in\r\n1780, when the Presbyterians were enrolled in that formidable\r\nrevolutionary organization known as the Volunteers, that a test which\r\nhad excluded them from all share in the government of their adopted\r\ncountry for seventy-four years was repealed. As for the Catholics, the\r\nsmall measure of legal relief granted to them excited no opposition\r\nanywhere. Parts of the Penal Code, especially the laws against worship\r\nand the clergy, had become inoperative with time and the sheer\r\nimpossibility of enforcement. The religion, naturally, had thriven under\r\npersecution, so that in spite of the Code's manifold temptations to\r\nrecant, only four thousand converts had been registered in the last\r\nfifty years. The laws designed to safeguard the wholesale confiscations\r\nof the previous century had long ago achieved their purpose, and men\r\nwere beginning to perceive the fatal economic effects of keeping the\r\ngreat mass of the people poor and ignorant. The real spirit of\r\ntoleration shown in the enactments of 1778, the most important of which\r\nenabled Catholics to obtain land on a lease of 999 years, was small\r\nenough if we consider the quiescence of the Catholics for generations\r\npast, the absence of all tendency in them towards counter-persecution,\r\nor even towards intolerance of Protestantism in any of its forms,\r\nQuaker, Huguenot, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or Methodist, in spite of\r\ntheir own overwhelming numbers and of the burning grievance of the\r\ntithes. Politically they were a source of great strength to the\r\nGovernment. When the Presbyterians condemned the American War, the\r\nCatholic leaders memorialized the Government in favour of it as warmly\r\nas the tame majority in Parliament.\r\n\r\nConservatives by religion, their devotion to authority annulled all\r\ninstincts of revenge for the hideous wrongs of the past. The Government,\r\nnow on the verge of a war with the two great Catholic Powers of Europe,\r\nbegan to realize this, and to feel the wisdom of some degree of\r\nconciliation. After all, only four years before they had not merely\r\ntolerated, but established, the Catholic Church in the conquered\r\nprovince of Quebec, with the result that the French Canadians remained\r\nloyal during the American War. But neither the Government nor the finest\r\nindependent men in Parliament--not even Grattan--entertained the\r\nremotest idea of admitting Irish Catholics to any really effective share\r\nin the Government which their loyalty made stable. That noble but\r\nhopeless conception originated later, as the dynamic impulse for\r\ncommercial freedom and legislative independence was originating now,\r\noutside the walls of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe rupture with France in 1778 denuded Ireland of troops, and called\r\ninto being the Protestant Volunteers; a disciplined, armed body, headed\r\nby leaders as weighty and respectable as Lord Charlemont. This body,\r\nformed originally for home defence, by a natural and legitimate\r\ntransition assumed a political aspect, and demanded from a dismayed and\r\nterrorized Government commercial freedom for Ireland. For once in her\r\nlife Ireland was too strong to be coerced. Punishment like that applied\r\nto Massachusetts was physically impossible. The bitter protests of\r\nEnglish merchants passed unheeded, and the fiscal claims of the\r\nVolunteers, with their cannon labelled \"Free Trade or this,\" were\r\ngranted in full early in 1780. The moral was to persist. From 40,000 the\r\nnumbers of the Volunteers rose in the two succeeding years to 80,000,\r\nand they stood firm for further concessions. The national movement grew\r\nlike a river in spate; it swept forward the lethargic Catholics and\r\nengulfed Parliament. In a tempest of enthusiasm Grattan's Declaration of\r\nIndependence was carried unanimously in the Irish House of Commons on\r\nApril 16, 1782, and a month later received legal confirmation in England\r\nat the hands of the same Whig Government and Parliament which broke off\r\nhostilities with America, and in the same session.\r\n\r\nAmerica took her own road and worked out her own magnificent destiny.\r\nMost of us now honour Washington and the citizen troops he led. We say\r\nthey fought, as Hampden and their English forefathers fought, for a\r\nsublime ideal, freedom, and that they were chips of the old block. But\r\nlet not distance delude us into supposing that they were without the\r\nfull measure of human weakness, or that they did not suffer\r\nconsiderable, perhaps permanent, harm from the ten years of smothered\r\nrevolt and lawless agitation, followed by the seven years of open war\r\nwhich preceded their victory. Washington's genius carried them safely\r\nthrough the ordeal of the war, and the still more exacting ordeal of\r\npolitical reconstruction after the war, but it is well known how nearly\r\nhe and his staunchest supporters failed. The Revolution, like all\r\nrevolutions, brought out all the bad as well as all the good in human\r\nnature. Bad laws always deteriorate a people; they breed a contempt for\r\nlaw which coercion only aggravates, and which survives the establishment\r\nof good laws. As I have already indicated, the dislike and the\r\nsystematic evasion by smuggling of the trade laws during the long period\r\nwhen the revolt was incubating harmed American character, and probably\r\nsowed the seed of future corruption and dissension. However true that\r\nmay be, it is certainly true that the American rebels showed no more\r\nheroism or self-sacrifice than the average Englishman or Irishman in any\r\nother part of the world might have been expected to show under similar\r\nconditions. Historians and politicians, to whom legal authority always\r\nseems sacrosanct and agitation against it a popular vice, who mistake\r\ncause and effect so far as to derive freedom from character, instead of\r\ncharacter from freedom, can make, and have made, the conventional case\r\nagainst Home Rule for the Americans as plausibly as the same case has,\r\nat various times, been made against Home Rule for Canada, South Africa,\r\nand Ireland. Since all white men are fundamentally alike in their\r\nfaults as well as in their virtues, there is always abundant material\r\nfor an indictment on the ground of bad character. The Americans of the\r\nrevolutionary war, together with much fortitude, integrity, and public\r\nspirit, showed without doubt a good deal of levity, self-seeking,\r\nvindictiveness, and incompetence; and whoever chooses to amass, magnify,\r\nand isolate evidences of their guilt can demonstrate their unfitness for\r\nself-government just as well as he can demonstrate the same proposition\r\nin the case of Ireland. Mr. J.W. Fortescue, the learned and entertaining\r\nhistorian of the British Army, has done the former task as well as it\r\ncan be done. He denounces the whole Colony of Massachusetts--men of his\r\nown national stock--as the pestilent offspring of an \"irreconcilable\r\nfaction,\" which had originally left England deeply imbued with the\r\ndoctrines of Republicanism. Having gained, and by lying and subterfuge\r\nretained, some measure of independence, they sank from depth to depth of\r\nmeanness and turpitude. They struggled for no high principle, and\r\nrefused to be taxed from England, simply because they were too\r\ncontemptibly stingy and unpatriotic to pay a shilling a head towards the\r\nmaintenance of the Imperial Army. It is always the \"mob,\" the\r\n\"ruffians,\" the \"rabble,\" of Boston who carry out the reprisals against\r\nthe royal coercion, and, like the Irish peasants of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, they are always the half-blind, half-criminal tools of\r\nunscrupulous \"agitators.\" It has been, and remains, an obsession with\r\nthe partisans of law over liberty all the world over that the fettered\r\ncommunity, wherever it may be and however composed, does not really want\r\nliberty, but that the majority of its sober citizens are dragged into an\r\nartificial agitation by mercenary scribes and sham patriots--a view\r\nwhich is always somewhat difficult to reconcile, as students of American\r\nand Irish history are aware, not only with the facts of prolonged and\r\ntenacious resistance, but with the other view, equally necessary to the\r\nargument for law, that the whole community is sinfully unfit for\r\nliberty; and Mr. Fortescue falls into the usual maze of\r\nself-contradiction and obscurity when he tries to give an intelligible\r\naccount of a war which lasted seven long and weary years, and yet was\r\n\"factitious,\" initiated by an hysterical rabble, stimulated and\r\nsustained by the basest and pettiest motives, and which, he contends,\r\nwas \"the work of a small but energetic and well-organized minority\r\ntowards which the mass of the people, when not directly hostile, was\r\nmainly indifferent.\" Happily, Mr. Fortescue's candour as an historian of\r\nfacts gives us the clue to this strange tangle. We find no evidence that\r\nthe sober loyalist majority who sustain one side of his argument, and\r\nwhom we should expect to find crushing the revolt with ease in\r\nco-operation with the British regular troops, were, in fact, a majority,\r\nnor that they were either better or worse men, or more or less ardent\r\npatriots, than the mutinous minority, or the British regular soldiers\r\nthemselves. Their loyalty, like the disloyalty of the other side, is\r\nsometimes interested and evanescent, more often sincere and tenacious;\r\nthey are given to desertion, like Washington's troops, like Lee's and\r\nGrant's troops nearly a century later, like the Boer troops and like all\r\nVolunteer levies, which have somehow to combine war with the duty of\r\nkeeping their homes and business afloat. We find, too, that a\r\ncounter-current of desertion flows from the British, and still more from\r\nthe German, regulars, also a natural enough phenomenon in what was\r\nvirtually a civil war for liberty; so that \"General Greene was often\r\nheard to say that at the close of the war he fought the enemy with\r\nBritish soldiers, and that the British fought him with those of\r\nAmerica.\" And then Mr. Fortescue, ignoring the British side of the case,\r\nexultingly quotes against the Americans \"the cynical Benedict Arnold,\r\nwho knew his countrymen,\" and who said: \"Money will go farther than arms\r\nin America.\" Yet Arnold, whose opinion of his countrymen Mr. Fortescue\r\naccepts as correct and conclusive, was himself, not a plain deserter,\r\nbut a perjured military traitor of the most despicable kind. We may\r\nconclude, perhaps, after taking a broad view of the whole Revolution,\r\nthat Washington not only knew his countrymen, who were Mr. Fortescue's\r\ncountrymen, better than Arnold, but was a better representative of their\r\ndominant characteristics.[15]\r\n\r\nMr. Fortescue is peculiar in the violence of his prepossession, and we\r\nknow the source of that prepossession, a passionate love of the British\r\nArmy, which does him great honour, while it distorts his political\r\nvision. I should not refer at such length to his view of the American\r\nWar were it not that, whenever a concrete case of Home Rule comes up for\r\ndiscussion, his philosophy is apt to become the typical and predominant\r\nphilosophy. Historical sense seems to vanish, and the same savage racial\r\nbias supervenes, whether the unruly people concerned are absolutely\r\nconsanguineous, closely related, or of foreign nationality. Instead of a\r\ngeneral acceptance of the ascertained truth that men thrive and coalesce\r\nunder self-government and sink into deterioration and division under\r\ncoercion, we get the same pharisaical assumption of superiority in the\r\ndominant people, the same attribution of sordid and ugly motives to the\r\nleaders of an unruly people, the same vague idealization of the loyalist\r\nminority, the same fixed hallucination that the majority does not want\r\nwhat by all the constitutional means in its power it says it wants, and\r\nthe correspondingly fatal tendency to gauge the intensity of a\r\nconviction solely by the amount of physical violence it evokes, while\r\nmaking that very violence an argument for the depravity of those who use\r\nit, and a pretext for denying them self-government.\r\n\r\nAll this is terribly true in the case of Ireland, and when I next revert\r\nto the American continent, the reader will observe that the same ideas\r\nwere entertained towards Canada, the only white Colony left to the\r\nBritish Empire after the loss of the thirteen States.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The origin of North Carolina is, perhaps, debatable. Nearly all\r\nhistorians have represented it as settled by Dissenting refugees; but\r\nMr. S.B. Weeks, a Carolina historian, has written an essay to prove that\r\nthis was not the case (\"Religious Development in the Province of North\r\nCarolina,\" Baltimore, 1892). The Charter contained a clause for liberty\r\nof conscience on the instructive ground that, \"by reason of the remote\r\ndistance of those places, toleration would be no breach of the unity and\r\nconformity established in this realm.\"\r\n\r\n[9] \"Church and State in Maryland,\" George Petrie. Lord Baltimore, the\r\nCatholic founder and Proprietary, enforced complete tolerance from the\r\nfirst (1634), and secured the passage of an Act in 1649 giving legal\r\nforce to the policy, with heavy penalties against interference with any\r\nsect. In 1654 Puritans gained control of the Assembly, and passed an Act\r\nagainst Popery. A counter-revolution repealed this Act, but finally in\r\n1689 the Church of England was established by law.\r\n\r\n[10] Lecky, \"History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century,\" vol. i., pp.\r\n408-410.\r\n\r\n[11] Until 1692 Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, elected\r\ntheir own Governors.

In the light of political\r\nideas developed at a much later period, we know that the American\r\nColonies might have remained within the Empire, even if their utmost\r\nclaims had been granted. Had the idea of responsible government been\r\nunderstood, it would have been realized that their exclusive control of\r\ntaxation and legislation was not inconsistent with Imperial Union, but\r\nessential to it. Grattan and his Irish friends, ignorant of the true\r\nsolution, honestly thought, in the intoxication of the moment, that they\r\nhad solved the problem so disastrously bungled for America. The facts of\r\nethnology and geography seemed to have been recognized. Ireland and\r\nEngland, united by a Crown which both reverenced, stood together, like\r\nBritain and the Dominions of to-day, as sister nations, with the old\r\nirritating servitude swept away, and the bonds of natural affection and\r\nnatural interest substituted. That the close proximity of the two\r\nnations, however marked the contrast between their natural\r\ncharacteristics, made these bonds far more necessary and valuable than\r\nin the case of America, stood to reason, and, again, the fact was\r\nrecognized in Anglo-Irish relations. America had fought rather than\r\nsubmit to a forced contribution to Imperial funds. Nobody in Ireland, in\r\nor out of Parliament, had ever objected in principle to an indirect\r\nvoluntary contribution in troops, and now that the American War was\r\nended, non-Parliamentary objections to one particular application of the\r\nprinciple had no further substance. Nor, as was shortly to be shown in\r\nthe reception given in Ireland to Pitt's abortive Commercial\r\nPropositions of 1785, was there any objection to a direct contribution\r\nin money on a fixed annual scale in return for a mutual free trade.[16]\r\nThe sun had surely risen over a free yet loyal Ireland.\r\n\r\nNever was there a more complete delusion. It would have been far better\r\nfor Ireland if she had never had a Parliament at all, but had had to\r\nseek her own salvation in the healthy rough-and-tumble of domestic\r\nrevolution. The mere name of \"Parliament\" seems perpetually to have\r\nhypnotized even its best members, and the illusion was at its highest\r\nnow. Nothing essential had been changed. Commercial freedom was the most\r\nreal gain, because it involved the definite repeal of certain trade-laws\r\nand the permission to Ireland to make what she liked and send it where\r\nshe liked; but it was a small gain without some means of finding out\r\nwhat Ireland really liked, and translating that will, without external\r\npressure, into law. The Parliament was neither an organ of public\r\nopinion nor a free agent. It was even more corrupt and less\r\nrepresentative than before. It was as completely under the control of\r\nthe English Government as before. The modern conception of a Colonial\r\nMinistry serving under a constitutional Governor selected by the Crown,\r\nbut acting with the advice of his Ministry, was unknown. The English\r\nGovernment, through its Lord-Lieutenant, still appointed English\r\nMinisters in Ireland, and in the hands of these Ministers lay not only\r\nthat large portion of the national income known as the hereditary\r\nrevenue, but the whole machinery of patronage and corruption. Even the\r\nlegislative independence was unreal; for majorities still had to be\r\nbought, Irish Bills had still to receive the Royal Assent, that is,\r\nEnglish ministerial assent; so that powerful English pressure could be,\r\nand was, brought to bear upon their policy and construction. And the\r\nworst of it was that English pressure here and elsewhere meant then what\r\nit meant in the next century, and what it too often means now, English\r\nparty pressure exercised spasmodically and ignorantly, in order to serve\r\nsectional English ends. In short, Ireland, so far from being a nation,\r\nwas still virtually a Colony, subjected to the worst conceivable form of\r\ncolonial Government, groaning under economic evils unknown in the least\r\nfortunate of the Colonies, and without the numerous mitigating\r\ncircumstances and the hope of ultimate cure due to remoteness from the\r\nseat of Empire. On the contrary, nearness to England, and, above all,\r\nnearness to France, where the misrule and miseries of ages were about to\r\nculminate in a fearful upheaval of social order, complicated immensely\r\nthe problem of regeneration in Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhat was the remedy? Parliamentary reform. The Volunteers saw this\r\ninstantly. Parliament itself scouted the idea of reform, because it\r\nthreatened the Protestant ascendancy. Any weakening of the Protestant\r\nascendancy was unthinkable to Irish statesmen, even to Grattan, who in\r\n1778 had coined the grandiose phrase that \"the Irish Protestant could\r\nnever be free until the Irish Catholic had ceased to be a slave,\" and\r\nwho afterwards explained what he meant by saying that the liberty of the\r\nCatholic was to be only such as was \"entirely consistent with the\r\nProtestant ascendancy,\" and that \"the Protestant interest was his first\r\nobject.\" Ascendancy, then, in the mind of the ruling class in Ireland\r\nwas fundamental. What was its corollary? Dependence on England.\r\nAscendancies, whether based on creed or property, or, as in Ireland, on\r\nboth, cannot last in any white community without external support, and\r\nthe external support for ascendancy in Ireland was English force without\r\nand English bribes within. There was the chain of causation, the vicious\r\ncircle rather; and yet Grattan, who never touched a bribe, thought he\r\nhad freed his beloved Ireland from the English influences which were\r\nthrottling her. He could not see that the more he wrestled for the\r\nindependence of a sham Parliament, while resisting its transformation\r\ninto a real Parliament, the more he strengthened those influences,\r\nbecause he inevitably widened the gulf between Parliament and the Irish\r\npeople. The glamour his brilliant gifts had thrown over the Irish\r\nParliament only served to divert his own mind and the minds of other\r\ntalented and high-minded men from the seat of disease in Ireland. Time\r\nand talent were wasted from the first over points of pride, trivialities\r\nwhich seemed portentous to over-sensitive minds; metaphysical puzzles as\r\nto the exact nature of the relations now existing between Ireland and\r\nEngland; whether the repeal of the Poynings' Act and the Declaratory Act\r\nwere sufficient guarantees of freedom; whether Ireland herself should\r\nnominate a Regent or accept the nomination from England. Meanwhile, the\r\nsands were running out, and Ireland was a slave to a minute but powerful\r\nminority of her sons and, only through them, to England.\r\n\r\nYet the heart of Ireland was sound. All the materials for regeneration\r\nwere there. The Catholics, whom by an old inherited instinct Grattan\r\nprofessed to dread, were the most Conservative part of the population,\r\nso Conservative as to be unaware of the source of their miseries,\r\nwithout the smallest leaning towards a counter-ascendancy, and without a\r\nnotion of sedition or rebellion. Paradox as it seems, if they leaned in\r\nany political direction, it was dimly towards the constituted authority\r\nof the day, the Irish Parliament. But the truth is that they were\r\nwithout political consciousness, behind the times, unappreciative of the\r\nnew forces operating round them. In sore need of courageous and\r\nenlightened guidance from men of their own faith, they were almost\r\nleaderless. The leeway to be made up after the destructive action of the\r\npenal laws was so enormous that Catholic philanthropists had no time or\r\nwill for high politics, and devoted their whole energy to the further\r\nrelaxation of those laws, to the education of their backward\r\nco-religionists, and to the mitigation of poverty. For relief they\r\ninstinctively looked towards the only legal source of relief, though the\r\nsource of secular oppression, Parliament. But this was habit. The\r\nCatholics at this time were like clay in the hands of the potter, open\r\nto any curative and ennobling impulse. That impulse came, as was right\r\nand natural, from the Protestant side. The only healthy political\r\norganization in Ireland in 1782 was that of the Volunteers of the North,\r\nwith their headquarters at Belfast. They represented all that was best\r\nin the Protestant population. They had won the practical victory, such\r\nas it was, Parliament, with all its flaming rhetoric, only the titular\r\nvictory. They grasped the essential truth that Parliament was rotten,\r\nand that Ireland's future depended on its reform. Numbering some 80,000\r\nor 100,000, they at once began to press for reform, and, since they had\r\nno constitutional resources, to overawe Parliament. Parliament at once\r\nstood on its dignity and on its civil rights against the \"Pretorian\r\nbands.\" \"And now,\" said Grattan in his magnificent way, \"having given a\r\nParliament to the people, the Volunteers will, I doubt not, leave the\r\npeople to Parliament, and thus close specifically and majestically a\r\ngreat work.\"\r\n\r\nBut the work was not begun. Parliament was the enemy of the people, and\r\nthe Volunteers knew it. Now, what was the \"people\" in the minds of the\r\nVolunteers? Undoubtedly they did not, after a century of racial\r\nascendancy, perform the miracle of accepting at once in its entirety the\r\nprinciple of absolute political equality for all Irishmen, Catholic and\r\nProtestant alike. Such mental revulsions rarely occur among men, and\r\nwhen they do occur are apt to produce reactionary cataclysms. But they\r\ndid from the first give a real meaning to Grattan's vague rhetoric about\r\nCatholic slaves; from the first they made overtures towards the\r\nCatholics, and ventilated proposals for the Catholic franchise as a part\r\nof their scheme of reform ten years before that enfranchisement, without\r\nParliamentary reform and therefore valueless, became a practical issue.\r\nFor the present these proposals were outvoted, and the effective demand\r\nof the Volunteers, as framed in the great Convention held at Dublin in\r\nNovember, 1783, was for a purification and reconstruction of Parliament\r\non a democratic Protestant basis. The Catholic franchise had been\r\nstrongly supported, but by the influence of Charlemont and Flood\r\nrejected. It is, of course, easy to maintain in theory that a democratic\r\nProtestant ascendancy so designed was as incompatible with Irish freedom\r\nas an aristocratic and corrupt ascendancy; but nobody with faith in\r\nhuman nature or any knowledge of history, will care to affirm that the\r\nprocess of reform would have ended with the enactment of the Volunteer\r\nBill. No present-day Protestant Ulsterman should entertain such a\r\ndishonouring doubt. Mercifully, men are so made that, if left to\r\nthemselves, they go forward, not backward. A pure Assembly, formed on\r\nthe Volunteer plan, stimulated by the enlightened conscience which such\r\nan Assembly invariably develops, by the discovery of the fundamental\r\nidentity of interests between the great bulk of Catholics and\r\nProtestants, and by the manly instinct of self-preservation against\r\nundue English encroachment, would have moved rapidly towards tolerance\r\nand equality.\r\n\r\nBut the Assembly which might have saved Ireland never came into being.\r\nThe Volunteers were in weak and incompetent hands. The metamorphosis\r\nthey had undergone from a body formed for home defence into a militant\r\npolitical organization found them at the critical moment unprovided with\r\nthe right stamp of leader. Flood, who helped to draft their Bill, was a\r\nbrilliant but unscrupulous and discredited Parliamentarian, and a\r\nfanatical advocate of an unimpaired Protestant ascendancy. Lord\r\nCharlemont, one of the most influential founders of the movement, and a\r\nman of the highest integrity, was lukewarm for reform, an aristocrat and\r\nan ascendancy man to the finger-tips, dreading the mysterious forces he\r\nhad helped to call into being, and desirous to keep them, as he said,\r\n\"respectable.\" Was it respectable for armed men to dictate to a\r\nParliament, however just their cause? As often happens in the ferment of\r\npopular movements, the one leader who spoke undiluted truth and sense\r\nspoke it in florid and unmeasured language and was himself of a figure\r\nand behaviour little likely to inspire permanent confidence. This was\r\nthe famous Bishop of Derry, called by Charlemont a blasphemous Deist, by\r\nWesley an exemplary Divine, by Fox a dishonest madman, and by Jeremy\r\nBentham \"a most excellent companion, pleasant, intelligent, well-bred,\r\nand liberal-minded to the last degree.\" He was certainly vain and\r\nostentatious, certainly a democratic free-thinker, but a full knowledge\r\nof his character is not of much concern to us. The point is that he was\r\nright about Ireland's needs, though the wrong man at the moment to drive\r\nhome her claims. Many finer agitators than he have failed in causes just\r\nas good. Many without half his merits have succeeded. We shall find his\r\nCanadian counterparts later in the figures of Mackenzie and Papineau.\r\n\r\nThe crisis came on November 29, 1783, when the Reform Bill reached\r\nParliament, and was introduced by Flood, wearing the Volunteer dress. It\r\nwas rejected on the first vote. No doubt the circumstances were\r\nhumiliating, and if there had been any serious inclination in Parliament\r\ntowards self-reform and the relinquishment of an odious and mischievous\r\nmonopoly, we should freely forgive rejection. But there was little or\r\nnone, as after-events proved, and the real humiliation lay, not in the\r\ndictation of the Irish Volunteers, but in the fact that the Volunteers\r\nthemselves were overawed by a strong body of British regular troops,\r\nmustered for the occasion under General Burgoyne. The vicious circle was\r\ncomplete. Forced to choose between reform and dependence on England,\r\nParliament chose the latter. And only a year and a half before Grattan\r\nhad dazzled his hears with the words: \"Ireland is now a nation ... _esto\r\nperpetua_.\"\r\n\r\nThere are very few critical dates in Irish history, and of those few the\r\nnight of November 29, 1783, was the most critical of all. It marked the\r\nclimax of a brief and bright renaissance from the long stagnation of the\r\neighteenth, and heralded a decline into the long agony of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, a decline concealed by the fictitious lustre which still hangs\r\nover the first decade of Grattan's unreformed Parliament, but none the\r\nless already present. The Volunteers, their grand opportunity lost,\r\nslowly broke up. Should they have used force, even under the threat of\r\nBurgoyne's guns? It would have been infinitely better both for England\r\nand Ireland if they had. Nothing but force could avail. Never would\r\nforce have been better justified, for the very soul of a people \"rang\r\nzwischen Tod und Leben.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hard, nevertheless, to blame the Volunteers for not appreciating\r\nthe full magnitude of the crisis and acting accordingly. They were ahead\r\nof their time as it was in the political instinct which taught them the\r\nvital importance of a reformed Parliament. They were far ahead of\r\nEngland, where the younger Pitt had failed to carry Reform a few months\r\nbefore, and was to fail again two years later when he urged reform for\r\nIreland. They were even ahead of their time in religious\r\ntolerance--witness the Gordon riots in London two years before. Their\r\nParliament wore the crown and spoke the regal language of a patriot\r\nAssembly. For five years they themselves had glorified justifiably in\r\nthe perfect discipline and sobriety with which they had used their\r\nirregular power. Their most trusted leaders suggested that they would\r\nyet achieve their ends without violence, while the large majority of the\r\nVolunteers themselves were still as loyal to the Crown as the\r\nCatholics, and were inclined, therefore, to shrink from action which,\r\nalthough in itself not in the remotest degree connected with dynastic\r\nquestions, involved a theoretical conflict with the Crown, and perhaps\r\nan actual collision with Royal troops. One of the last acts of the\r\nVolunteer Convention, before its dissolution, was to pass an address to\r\nthe King expressing fervent zeal for the Crown, reminding him of their\r\nquiet and dignified behaviour in the past, and praying that \"their\r\nhumble wish to have certain manifest perversions of the Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation of this kingdom remedied by the Legislature in some\r\nreasonable degree, might not be imputed to any spirit of innovation in\r\nthem, but to a sober and laudable desire to uphold the Constitution, to\r\nconfirm the satisfaction of their fellow-subjects, and to perpetuate the\r\ncordial union of the two kingdoms.\" This document might have been copied\r\n_mutatis mutandis_ from the American petitions prior to the war, and was\r\nto be reproduced almost word for word in Canadian petitions dealing with\r\nless serious grievances whose neglect at the hands of the Government did\r\nactually lead to armed rebellion. It must be taken, as Mr. Lecky truly\r\nsays, as the \"defence of the Convention before the bar of history.\"\r\nDrawn up by the most moderate and least prescient leaders, it was a\r\nvindication of the past, not a pledge for the future; for \"from that\r\ntime,\" as Mr. Lecky writes, \"the conviction sank deep into the minds of\r\nmany that reform in Ireland could only be effected by revolution, and\r\nthe rebellion of 1798 might be already foreseen.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of that transition, with all its disastrous consequences in\r\nthe denationalization of Ireland, in the arrest of healing forces, in\r\nthe reawakening of slumbering bigotries and hatreds, in the artificial\r\ntransformation of Catholics into anti-English rebels, and Protestants\r\ninto anti-Irish Loyalists, in the long agony of the land war, the tithe\r\nwar, the Church war, and the loathsome savageries of the rebellion\r\nitself, is one of the most repulsive in history. It is repulsive because\r\nyou can watch, as it were, upon a dissecting-table the moral fibre of a\r\npeople, from no inherent germ of decay, against reason, against nature,\r\nvisibly wasting under a corrosive acid. Typical figures stand out: the\r\nstrong figure of Fitzgibbon, voicing ascendancy in its crudest and\r\nugliest form; at the other extreme the ardent but inadequate figure of\r\nWolfe Tone, affirming in words which expressed the literal truth of the\r\ncase that \"to subvert the tyranny of our execrable Government, to break\r\nthe connection with England, the never-failing source of all our\r\npolitical evils, and to assert the independence of my country--these\r\nwere my objects.\" Midway stands Grattan, the defeated and disillusioned\r\n\"Girondin,\" as Mr. Fisher aptly calls him,[17] blind until it was too\r\nlate to the errors which plunged his country into anarchy, and retiring\r\nin despair when he saw that anarchy coming. And on the other side of the\r\nwater, Pitt, dispassionately prescribing for Ireland in 1784, while\r\nthere was yet time, the radical remedy, Reform, patiently turning, when\r\nthat was refused, to palliatives like mutual free trade in 1785 and the\r\nCatholic franchise in 1793; and meanwhile, with an undercurrent of cool\r\nscepticism, preparing the ground for the only alternative to Reform,\r\nshort of a revolutionary separation of the two countries, legislative\r\nUnion, and remorselessly pushing that Union through by the only\r\navailable means, bribery.\r\n\r\nIn this wretched story we seek in vain for individual scapegoats.\r\nTracing events to their source, we strike against two obstructions,\r\nproximity and ignorance, and we may as well make them our scapegoats. If\r\nproximity had implied knowledge and forbearance, all would have been\r\nwell, but it implied just the reverse, and prohibited the kind of\r\nsolution which, after very much the same sort of crisis, and in the\r\nteeth of ignorance and error, was afterwards reached in the case of\r\nCanada and South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause is clear. The failure of Reform is the key to the\r\nRebellion and the Union. In a patriotic anxiety to idealize Grattan's\r\nParliament, with a view to justifying later claims for autonomy,\r\nIrishmen have generally shut their eyes to this cardinal fact, and have\r\npreferred to dwell with exaggerated emphasis on the little good that\r\nParliament did rather than on the enormous evils which it not only left\r\nuntouched, but scarcely observed. We must remember that it was not only\r\na Protestant body, but a close body of landlords, with an infusion of\r\nlawyers and others devoted to the interest of landlords. In that\r\ncapacity it was incapable of diagnosing, much less of remedying, the\r\ngravest material ills of Ireland. In the very narrow domain where the\r\nlandlord interest was not concerned, as in industrial and commercial\r\nmatters, Parliament seems to have acted on the whole with wisdom. It\r\nendeavoured to encourage industries, while refusing to squander its\r\nnewly won commercial powers in waging tariff wars with Great Britain,\r\nwhere prohibitive duties against Irish goods still continued to be\r\nimposed. But Ireland was no longer an industrial country. All the\r\nencouragement in the world could not replace lost aptitudes or bring\r\nback the exiled craftsmen who, during a century past, had left Ireland\r\nto enrich European countries with their skill. The favoured linen\r\nindustry alone survived to reach its present flourishing condition. The\r\nrevival in other manufactures, even in that of wool, which was\r\nremarkably rapid and strong, seems to have been artificial and\r\ntransient. No wonder; for, while Ireland had been stagnant for a\r\ncentury, her great competitor, England, had been steadily building up\r\nthat capacity for organized industry which, under the inventive genius\r\nof Arkwright, Hargreaves, and Watt, and the economic genius of Adam\r\nSmith, made the last twenty years of the eighteenth century such a\r\nmarvellous period of industrial expansion, and eventually converted\r\nEngland from an agricultural into a manufacturing nation. Ireland was\r\nhopelessly late in the race. On the other hand, the fertile land of\r\nIreland remained as the indestructible source of wealth and the prime\r\nmeans of subsistence for the great bulk of the four and a half million\r\nsouls who inhabited the country. Parliament seems to have been almost\r\nindifferent to the miseries of the agricultural population, wholly\r\nindifferent, certainly, to their source, the vicious agrarian system\r\nwhich it was the interest of its own members to sustain. Foster's famous\r\nCorn Law without doubt increased tillage, and, in conjunction with the\r\ninflated prices for produce caused by the French War, gave a powerful\r\nthough a somewhat unhealthy impulse to the trade in corn. But it\r\nenriched only the landlords, and left untouched the real abuses,\r\nabsenteeism, middlemanism, insecurity of tenure, rack-rents, and tithes.\r\nThe Whiteboy risings of the sixties and seventies recurred, and were met\r\nwith Coercion Acts as stupid and cruel as those of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The tithe grievance, which festered and grew into civil war in\r\nthe nineteenth century, was never touched. While tenants in North-East\r\nUlster were painfully and forcibly establishing their custom of tenant\r\nright in the teeth of the law, the inhuman system of cottier tenancy,\r\nwhich was to last until 1881, became more and more firmly rooted in\r\nother parts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nNone but a democratic Assembly could possibly have grappled with these\r\nevils; nor is there any reason to suppose that in the existing condition\r\nof Ireland a Protestant democratic Assembly, even if temporarily it\r\nretained its sectarian character, would have grappled with them less\r\nboldly and drastically than an Assembly composed of Catholics and\r\nProtestants. The material interests of nineteen-twentieths of the people\r\nwere the same, while the education and intelligence belonged mainly to\r\nthe Protestants. Ulster tenants had as much need of good land laws as\r\nother tenants. Tithes were as much disliked in the north as in the\r\nsouth. The Established Church was the Church of a very small minority,\r\nand its clergy, numbers of whom were absentees, were as unpopular as the\r\nabsentee landlords and the absentee office-holders and pensioners.\r\n\r\nBut with no redress, and, what is more important, no prospect of redress\r\nfor the primary ills of Ireland, the centrifugal forces of religion and\r\nrace had full scope for their baneful influence. And it was at the very\r\nmoment when tolerance was steadily gaining ground among all classes that\r\nthese spectres of ancient wrong were summoned up to destroy the good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nHow did this come about? Let us remember once more that everything\r\nhinged on Reform. Reform gained a little, but suffered far more, by its\r\nassociation with the question of Catholic franchise, which was useless\r\nwithout Reform, while it was the corollary of Reform. Nothing is more\r\nremarkable than the growth of academic tolerance during this period,\r\ndoubtful and suspect as the motives sometimes were. It is true that the\r\ngreat Relief Act of 1793, giving Catholics the vote and removing a\r\nquantity of other disqualifications, would scarcely have been sanctioned\r\nby the Parliamentary managers without the stern dictation of Pitt, whose\r\nmind was strongly influenced by the violent anti-Catholic turn just\r\ntaken by the French Revolution; but, once sanctioned, it passed\r\nrapidly, and was received with universal satisfaction in the country at\r\nlarge. Without \"Emancipation,\" that is, the permission to elect\r\nCatholics to sit in Parliament and hold office, the franchise was\r\nillusory and even harmful. In the counties the forty-shilling \"freehold\"\r\nvote (\"freehold\" was an ironical misnomer) encouraged Protestant\r\nlandlords for another generation, before and after the Union, still\r\nfurther to subdivide already excessively small holdings, while the\r\nbenefits to be derived from the admission to power of propertied\r\nCatholics, with all their intensely Conservative instincts, were thrown\r\naway. Emancipation apart, the franchise without Reform was a complete\r\nfarce, for the boroughs, which controlled the Parliamentary balance,\r\nwere the personal property of Protestant landlords, and the 110\r\nParliamentary placemen were indirectly their tools. As usual, the men of\r\nlight and leading contributed unconsciously to the strength of a system\r\nwhich, in their hearts, as honest men, they condemned. Each of them had\r\nsome fatal defect of understanding. Grattan became a strong Emancipator,\r\nbut remained an academic and ineffectual reformer striving in vain to\r\nreconcile Reform with a passionate abhorrence of democracy and a\r\ndetermination to keep power in the hands of landed property. In England,\r\nwhich was Protestant in the Established sense, he would have done no\r\nmore harm than Burke, who for the same reason fought Reform as strongly\r\nas Pitt and his father Chatham had advocated it. But in Ireland, which\r\nwas Catholic and Nonconformist, landed property signified Episcopalian\r\nlanded property, that is, the narrowest form of ascendancy. Charlemont\r\nwas an even stranger paradox. He was an academic Reformer before\r\nGrattan, but not an Emancipator, arriving at the same sterility as\r\nGrattan through a religious bias which Grattan ceased to feel, a bias\r\ninspired, not by a fanatical fear of democracy in itself, but by a fear\r\nof Catholic revenge for past wrongs. These men and their like, admirable\r\nand lovable as in many respects they were, were useless to Ireland in\r\nthose terrible times. Whether Emancipation, unaccompanied by Reform, had\r\nany real chance of passing Parliament in 1795, when the Whig Viceroy\r\nFitzwilliam, the one Viceroy in the eighteenth century who ever\r\nconceived the idea of governing Ireland according to Irish ideas, came\r\nover from England with the avowed intention of proposing it, is a matter\r\nof conjecture. Fitzwilliam was snuffed out by Pitt, and recalled under\r\ncircumstances which still remain a matter of controversy. All we can say\r\nwith certainty is that the opinion of Ireland at large was absolutely\r\nignored, and that English party intrigues and English claims on Irish\r\npatronage had much to do with the result. On the whole, however, I agree\r\nwith Mr. Fisher that too much importance has been given to this episode,\r\nespecially by Mr. Lecky, who devotes nearly a volume to it.\r\n\r\nThe anti-national Irish Parliament was past praying for. Long before\r\n1795 the Irish aristocracy had lost whatever power for good it ever\r\npossessed, and most of the resolute reformers of Wolfe Tone's\r\nmiddle-class Protestant school had turned, under the enthralling\r\nfascination of the French Revolution, into revolutionaries. Reform had\r\nbeen refused in 1782; again, and without coercion from the Volunteers,\r\nin 1783. It was refused again in 1784, against the advice of Pitt and at\r\nthe instigation of Pitt's own Viceroy, Rutland, whom Pitt had\r\nurged--what a grim irony it seems!--to give \"unanswerable proofs that\r\nthe cases of Ireland and England are different,\" and who answered with\r\ntruth that the ascendancy of a minority could only be maintained \"by\r\nforce or corruption.\" Every succeeding year showed the same results.\r\nWolfe Tone was more than justified, he was compelled, to convert his\r\nSociety of United Irishmen, founded in 1791, into a revolutionary\r\norganization and to seek by forcible means to overthrow the Executive\r\nwhich controlled Parliament and, through it, Ireland. Since the symbol\r\nof the Irish Executive was the British Crown, he, of course, abjured the\r\nCrown, though he had no more quarrel with the Crown as such than had the\r\nAmerican or Canadian patriots. He simply loved his country, and from the\r\nfirst saw with clear eyes the only way to save her. Tolerance to him was\r\nnot an isolated virtue, but an integral part of democracy. He took\r\nlittle interest in the Parliamentary side of Catholic relief, realizing\r\nits hollow unreality, and, in the case of the Bill of 1793, actually\r\nridiculing the absurd spectacle of the Catholic cottiers being herded to\r\nthe poll by their Protestant landlords. Nor was he even an extreme\r\nDemocrat, for he advocated a ten-pound, instead of a forty shilling\r\nfranchise. His original pamphlet of 1791 contains nothing but the most\r\nsober political common sense.\r\n\r\nHis aim was to unite Irishmen of all creeds to overthrow a Government\r\nwhich did not emanate from or represent them, and which was ruinous to\r\nthem. It is not surprising that he failed. Ireland was very near\r\nEngland. French intervention had been decisive in distant America, and\r\nthe French Revolution in its turn had been hastened by the American\r\nexample. But the intervention in Ireland of Republican France, for\r\npurely selfish and strategic reasons, without effective command of the\r\nsea, and with the stain of the Terror upon her, was of little material\r\nvalue and a grave moral handicap to the Irish Revolutionists. It is the\r\nmanner of Tone's failure and the consequences of his failure that have\r\nsuch a tragic interest. A united Ireland could have dispensed with the\r\naid of France. What prevented unity? Tone laboured to bring both creeds\r\ntogether, and to a certain degree was successful. Until the very last it\r\nwas the Catholics, not the Protestants, who shrank most from revolution.\r\nYet, in the Rebellion of 1798, the North never moved, while Catholic\r\nWexford and Wicklow rose.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is to be found in those agrarian abuses whose long\r\nneglect by the Irish Parliament constituted the strongest justification\r\nfor Reform. The Orange Society, founded under that name in 1795,\r\noriginated in the \"Peep o' Day Boys,\" a local association formed in\r\nArmagh in 1784 for the purpose of bullying Catholics. There is no doubt\r\nthat the underlying incentive was economic. Even when the Penal Code had\r\nlost in efficacy, its results survived in the low standard of living of\r\nthe persecuted Catholics. As I pointed out in a former chapter, the\r\nreckless cupidity of the landlords in terminating leases and fixing new\r\nrents by auction, with the alternative of eviction, threw those\r\nProtestant tenants who did not emigrate into direct competition with\r\nCatholic peasants of a lower economic stamp, who because they lived on\r\nlittle could afford to offer fancy rents. Hence much bitter friction,\r\nleading to sordid village rows and eventually to the organized\r\nruffianism of the Peep o' Day Boys. The Catholic Franchise Act of 1793,\r\nunaccompanied by Emancipation, actually intensified the trouble by\r\nremoving the landlord's motive to prefer a Protestant tenant on account\r\nof his vote. Under ill-treatment, the Catholics naturally retaliated\r\nwith a society known as the \"Defenders,\" and in some districts were\r\nthemselves the aggressors. Defenderism, in its purely agrarian aspect,\r\nspread to other parts of Ireland, where Protestants were few, and became\r\nmerged in Whiteboyism. This had always been an agrarian movement,\r\ndirected against abuses which the law refused to touch, and without\r\nreligious animus, although the overwhelming numbers of the Catholics in\r\nthe regions where it flourished would have placed the Protestants at\r\ntheir mercy. In Ulster both the contending organizations necessarily\r\nacquired a religious form and necessarily retained it. But at bottom bad\r\nlaws, not bigotry, were the cause. There was nothing incurable, or even\r\nunique, about the disorders. Analogous phenomena have appeared\r\nelsewhere, for example, in Australia, between the original squatters on\r\nlarge ranches and new and more energetic colonists in search of land for\r\ncloser settlement. Under a rational system of tenure and distribution\r\nthere was plenty of good land in Ireland for an even larger population.\r\nTone, who was a middle-class lawyer, seems never to have appreciated\r\nwhat was going on. So far from healing the schism, he appears to have\r\nwidened it by throwing the United Irish Committee of Ulster into the\r\nscale of the Catholics against the Orangemen. But, in truth, he was\r\nhelpless. Good administration only could unite these distracted\r\nelements, and without the Reform for which he battled, good\r\nadministration was impossible. The dissension, widening and acquiring an\r\nincreasingly religious and racial character, paralyzed Ulster, which\r\noriginally was the seat of the Revolution. The forces normally at work\r\nto favour law and order--loyalty to the Crown, dislike of the French\r\nRevolution, and resentment at Franco-Irish conspiracies--gathered\r\nproportionately greater strength.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Rebellion of 1798--a mad, pitiful thing at the best, the\r\nwork of half-starved peasants into whose stunted minds the splendid\r\nideal of Tone had scarcely begun to penetrate--was a totally different\r\nsort of rebellion from any he had contemplated. It was neither national\r\nnor Republican. The French invasions had met with little support; the\r\nfirst with positive reprobation. Nor was it in origin sectarian,\r\nalthough, once aflame, it inevitably took a sectarian turn. Several of\r\nthe prominent leaders were Protestants. Priests naturally joined in it\r\nbecause they were the only friends the people had had in the dark ages\r\nof oppression. In so far as it can be regarded as spontaneous, it was of\r\nWhiteboy origin, anti-tithe and anti-rack-rent. But it was not even\r\nspontaneous; that is another dreadful and indisputable fact which\r\nemerges. The barbarous measures taken to repress and disarm, prior to\r\nthe outbreak, together with the skilfully propagated reports of a coming\r\nmassacre by Orangemen, would have goaded any peasantry in the world to\r\nrevolt, and the only astonishing thing is that the revolt was so local\r\nand sporadic. General Sir Ralph Abercromby retired, sickened with the\r\nhorrors he was forbidden to avert. \"Within these twelve months,\" he\r\nwrote of the conduct of the soldiery at the time of his resignation,\r\n\"every crime, every cruelty that could be committed by Cossacks or\r\nCalmucks has been transacted here.... The struggle has been, in the\r\nfirst place, whether I was to have the command of the Army really or\r\nnominally, and then whether the character and discipline of it were to\r\nbe degraded and ruined in the mode of using it, either from the facility\r\nof one man or from the violence and oppression of a set of men who have\r\nfor more than twelve months employed it in measures which they durst not\r\navow or sanction.\"\r\n\r\nAbercromby's resignation, in Mr. Lecky's opinion, \"took away the last\r\nfaint chance of averting a rebellion.\" Fitzgibbon, Lord Clare, was now\r\nsupreme in the Government, and henceforth represents incarnate the\r\nforces which provoked the Rebellion and founded upon it the Union. He\r\nhad bided his time for a decade, watching the trend of events,\r\nforeseeing their outcome, and smiling sardonically at the ineffectual\r\nwrithings of the men of compromise. He stands out like a block of black\r\ngranite over against the slender figure of Wolfe Tone, who was his\r\nanti-type in ideas and aims, his inferior in intellect, his superior in\r\nmorals, but no more than his rival in sincerity, clarity, and\r\nconsistency of ideas. Clare was a product of the Penal Code, the son of\r\na Catholic Irishman who, to obtain a legal career, had become a\r\nProtestant. He himself was not a bigot, but a very able cynic, with a\r\ndefinite theory of government. Tolerance, Emancipation, Reform, were so\r\nmuch noxious, sentimental rubbish to him, and he had never scrupled to\r\nsay so. Ireland was a Colony, English colonists were robbers in Ireland,\r\nand robbers must be tyrants, or the robbed will come by their own again;\r\nthat was his whole philosophy,[18] his frigid and final estimate of the\r\ntendencies of human nature, and his considered cure for them. Racial\r\nfusion was a crazy conception not worth argument. Wrong on one side,\r\nrevenge on the other; policy, coercion. As he put it in his famous\r\nspeech on the Union, the settlers to the third and fourth generation\r\n\"were at the mercy of the old inhabitants of the island.\" \"Laws must be\r\nframed to meet the vicious propensities of human nature,\" and laws of\r\nthis sort for the case of Ireland should, he held with unanswerable\r\nlogic, properly be made in England, not by the travesty of a Parliament\r\nin Ireland, which, in so far as it was in any degree Irish, had shown\r\nfaint but ominous tendencies towards tolerance and the reunion of\r\nIrishmen. He never took the trouble to demonstrate the truth of his\r\ntheory of revenge by a reasoned analysis of Irish symptoms. He took it\r\nfor granted as part of a universal axiomatic truth, and, like all\r\nphilosophers of his school, pointed to the results of misgovernment and\r\ncoercion as proofs of the innate depravity of the governed and of their\r\nneed for more coercion. Anticipating a certain limited class of Irishmen\r\nof to-day, often brilliant lawyers like himself, he used to bewail\r\nEnglish ignorance of Ireland, meaning ignorance of the incurable\r\ncriminality of his own kith and kin. He was just as immovably cynical\r\nabout the vast majority of his own co-religionists as about the\r\nconquered race. If, as was obvious, so far from fearing the revenge of\r\nthe Catholics, their unimpeded instinct was to take sides with them to\r\nsecure good government, they were not only traitors, but imbeciles who\r\ncould not see the doom awaiting them. Yet Fitzgibbon's admirers must\r\nadmit that his consistency was not complete. He was perfectly cognizant\r\nof the real causes of Irish discontent. He was aware of the grievances\r\nof Ulster, and his description of the conditions of the Munster\r\npeasantry in the Whiteboy debates of 1787 is classical. If pressed, he\r\nwould have answered, we may suppose, that it was impolitic to cure\r\nevils which were at once the consequence of ascendancy and the\r\ncondition of its maintenance. That other strange lapse in 1798, when he\r\ndescribed the unparalleled prosperity of Ireland since 1782 under a\r\nConstitution which, in the Union debates of 1800, he afterwards covered\r\nwith deserved ridicule as having led to anarchy, destitution, and\r\nbankruptcy, must be attributed to the exigencies of debate; for he was\r\nan advocate as well as a statesman, and occasionally gave way to the\r\ntemptation of making showy but unsubstantial points.\r\n\r\nThese slips were rare, and do not detract from the massive coherence of\r\nhis doctrine. He remains the frankest, the most vivid, and the most\r\npowerful exponent of a theory of government which has waged eternal\r\nconflict with its polar rival, the Liberal theory, in the evolution of\r\nthe Empire. The theory, of course, extends much farther than the\r\nbi-racial Irish case, to which Fitzgibbon applied it. It was used, as we\r\nshall see, to meet the bi-racial circumstances of Canada and South\r\nAfrica, and it was also used in a modified form to meet the uni-racial\r\ncircumstances of Australia and of Great Britain itself. Anyone who reads\r\nthe debates on the Reform Bill of 1831 will notice that the opposition\r\nrested at bottom on a profoundly pessimistic distrust of the people, and\r\non the alleged necessity of an oligarchy vested with the power and duty\r\nof \"framing laws to meet the vicious propensities of human nature.\" In a\r\nword, the theory is in essence not so much anti-racial as\r\nanti-democratic, while finding its easiest application where those\r\ndistinctions of race and creed exist which it is its effect, though not\r\nits purpose, to intensify and envenom. Fitzgibbon is a repulsive figure.\r\nYet it would be unjust to single him out for criticism. Like him, the\r\nphilosophers Hume and Paley believed in oligarchy, and accepted force or\r\ncorruption as its two alternative props. Burke thought the same, though\r\nthe Pitts thought otherwise. Fitzgibbon's brutal pessimism was only the\r\npolitical philosophy of Paley, Hume, and Burke pushed relentlessly in an\r\nexceptional case to its extreme logical conclusion. But we can justly\r\ncriticize statesmen of the present day who, after a century's experience\r\nof the refutation of the doctrine in every part of the world, still\r\nadhere to it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Pitt's original scheme was accepted in Ireland, but defeated in\r\nEngland, owing to the angry opposition of British commercial interests.\r\nThe scheme, as amended to conciliate these interests, was deservedly\r\nrejected in Ireland.\r\n\r\n[17] J. Fisher, \"The End of the Irish Parliament.\" The author is much\r\nindebted to this brilliant study, which appeared only this year (1911).\r\n\r\n[18] See Fitzgibbon's Speeches in the Irish House of Lords, on the\r\nCatholic Franchise Bill, March 13, 1793, and on the Union, February 10,\r\n1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE UNION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst feature of Fitzgibbonism is that it has the power artificially\r\nto produce in the human beings subject to it some of the very phenomena\r\nwhich originally existed only in the perverted imagination of its\r\nprofessors. Some only of the phenomena; not all; for human nature\r\ntriumphs even over Fitzgibbonism. There has never been a moment since\r\nthe Union when a representative Irish Parliament, if statesmen had been\r\nwise and generous enough, to set such a body up, would have acted on the\r\nprinciple of revenge or persecution. Nor, in spite of all evidences to\r\nthe contrary, has there ever been a moment when Protestant Ulstermen,\r\nheirs of the noble Volunteer spirit, once represented in such a\r\nParliament, would have acted on the assumption that they had to meet a\r\npolicy of revenge. Nevertheless, Fitzgibbonism did succeed, as it was to\r\nsucceed in Canada, in making pessimism at least plausible and in\r\nachieving an immense amount of direct ascertainable mischief.\r\n\r\nThe rift between the creeds and races, just beginning to heal three\r\ngenerations after the era of confiscation, but reopened under the\r\noperations of economic forces connected with race and religion, yet\r\nperfectly capable of adjustment by a wise and instructed Government,\r\nyawned wide from 1798 onwards, when Government had become a soulless\r\npoliceman, and scenes of frenzy and slaughter had occurred which could\r\nnot be forgotten. Swept asunder by a power outside their control,\r\nProtestants and Catholics stood henceforth in opposite political camps,\r\nand it became a fixed article of British policy to govern Ireland by\r\nplaying upon this antagonism. The flame of the Volunteer spirit never\r\nperished, but it dwindled to a spark under the irresistible weight of a\r\nmanufactured reaction. Dissenters and Anglicans united, not to lead the\r\nway in securing better conditions for their Catholic fellow-countrymen,\r\nnot for the interests of Ireland as a whole, but under the ignoble\r\ncolours of religious fanaticism. Hence that strangely artificial\r\nalliance between the landlords of the South and West and the democratic\r\ntenantry, artisans, and merchants of the North; an alliance formed to\r\nmeet an imaginary danger, and kept in being with the most mischievous\r\nresults to the social and economic development of Ireland. Since the\r\nProtestant minority had made up its mind to depend once more on the\r\nEnglish power it had defied in 1782, the old machine of Ascendancy,\r\nwhich had showed certain manifest signs of decrepitude under Grattan's\r\nParliament, was reconstructed on a firmer, less corrupt, and more\r\nlasting basis.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Union is not a landmark or a turning-point in Irish\r\nhistory. It reproduced \"under less assailable forms\" the Government\r\nwhich existed prior to 1782. The real crisis, as I have said, came at\r\nthe end of 1783, when the Volunteers tried, by reforming Parliament, to\r\ngive Irish Government an Irish character. It is essential to\r\nremember--now as much as ever before--that Ireland has never had a\r\nnational Parliament. She has never been given a chance of\r\nself-expression and self-development. It is useless, though Home Rulers\r\nfrequently give way to the temptation, to advocate Home Rule by arguing\r\nfrom Grattan's Parliament. O'Connell, in the Repeal debate of 1834,\r\ndevoted hours to praising that Parliament, and had his own argument\r\nturned against him with crushing force by the Secretary to the Treasury,\r\nwho easily proved that it was the most corrupt and absurd body that ever\r\nexisted. The same game of cross-purposes went on in the Home Rule\r\ndebates of 1886 and 1893, and reappeared but this year in a debate of\r\nthe House of Lords (July 4, 1911), when the Roman Catholic Home Ruler,\r\nLord MacDonnell, eulogized Grattan's Parliament in answer to Lord\r\nLondonderry, the Protestant Unionist landlord, who painted it in its\r\ntrue colours. Yet Lord Londonderry springs from the class and school of\r\nCharlemont, who, by refusing to act as an Irishman, hastened the ruin of\r\nthe Parliament which Lord Londonderry satirizes, and Lord MacDonnell\r\nfrom the race which was betrayed by that Parliament. The anomaly need\r\nnot surprise us. It is not stranger than the fact that the Union would\r\nnever have been carried without Catholic support in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe point we have to grasp is that Ireland was a victim to the crudity\r\nand falsity of the political ideas current at the time of the Union,\r\npersistent all over the Empire for long afterwards, and not extinct yet.\r\nBetween Separation, personified by Tone, and Union, personified by\r\nFitzgibbon, and carried by those milder statesmen, Castlereagh and Pitt,\r\nthere seemed to be no alternative. Actually there was and is an\r\nalternative: a responsible Irish Parliament and Government united to\r\nEngland by sympathy and interest.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary history of the Union does not much concern us.\r\nBribery, whether by titles, offices, or cash, had always been the normal\r\nmeans of securing a Government majority in the Irish House of Commons.\r\nCorruption was the only means of carrying the vote for the Union, and\r\nthe time and labour needed for securing that vote are a measure of the\r\nrewards gained by those who formed the majority. Disgusting business as\r\nit was, we have to admit that a Parliament which refused to reform\r\nitself at the bidding of all that was best and healthiest in Ireland\r\ndid, on its own account, deserve extinction. The sad thing is that the\r\ntrue Ireland was sacrificed.\r\n\r\nPitt and Castlereagh, though they plunged their hands deep in the mire\r\nto obtain the Union, quite honestly believed in the policy of the Union.\r\nThey were wrong. They merely reestablished the old ascendancy in a form,\r\nmorally perhaps more defensible, but just as damaging to the interests\r\nof Ireland. In addition to absentee landlords, an alien and a largely\r\nabsentee Church, there was now an absentee Parliament, remote from all\r\npossibility of pressure from Irish public opinion, utterly ignorant of\r\nIreland, containing within it, for twenty-nine years, at any rate,\r\nrepresentatives of only one creed, and that the creed of the small\r\nminority. Pitt had virtually pledged himself to make Catholic\r\nEmancipation an immediate consequence of the Union, and his Viceroy,\r\nCornwallis, had thereby obtained the invaluable support of the Catholic\r\nhierarchy and of many of the Catholic gentry. The King, half mad at the\r\ntime, refused to sanction the redemption of the pledge, and Pitt, to his\r\ndeep dishonour, accepted the insult and dropped the scheme.\r\nFitzgibbonism in its extreme form had triumphed. It was a repetition of\r\nthe perfidy over the Treaty of Limerick a century before. Indeed, at\r\nevery turn of Irish history, until quite recent times, there seems to\r\nhave been perpetrated some superfluity of folly or turpitude which shut\r\nthe last outlet for natural improvement. It cannot be held, however,\r\nthat the refusal of Emancipation for another generation seriously\r\ndamaged the prospects of the Union as a system of government. After it\r\nwas granted, the system worked just as badly as before, and in all\r\nessentials continues to work just as badly now. Inequalities in the\r\nIrish franchise were only an aggravation. In order to cripple Catholic\r\npower, Emancipation itself was accompanied in 1829 by an Act which\r\ndisfranchised at a stroke between seven and eight tenths of the Irish\r\ncounty electorate, nor was it until the latest extension of the United\r\nKingdom franchise, that is, eighty-five years after the Union, that the\r\nIrish representation was a true numerical reflection of the Irish\r\ndemocracy. But these were not vital matters. In the Home Rule campaigns\r\nof 1886 and 1893, Irish opinion, constitutionally expressed, was\r\nimpotent. The vital matter was that the Union killed all wholesome\r\npolitical life in Ireland, destroyed the last chance of promoting\r\nharmony among Irishmen, and transferred the settlement of Irish\r\nquestions to an ignorant and prejudiced tribunal, incapable of\r\ncomprehending these questions, much less of adjudicating upon them with\r\nany semblance of impartiality.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Union was unnatural. The two islands, near as they were\r\nto each other, were on different planes of civilization, wealth, and\r\neconomic development, without a common tradition, a common literature,\r\nor a common religion. Each had a temperament and genius of its own, and\r\neach needed a different channel of expression. Laws applicable to one\r\nisland were meaningless or noxious in the other; taxation applicable to\r\na rich industrial island was inappropriate and oppressive for a poor\r\nagricultural island. And upon a system comprising all these\r\nincompatibilities there was grafted the ruinous principle of ascendancy.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing inherently strange about the difference between England\r\nand Ireland. Artificial land-frontiers often denote much sharper\r\ncleavages of sentiment, character, physique, language, history. A\r\nsea-frontier sometimes makes a less, sometimes a more, effective line of\r\ndelimitation. Denmark and Sweden, France and England, are examples.\r\nNor, on the other hand, did the profound differences between Ireland and\r\nEngland preclude the possibility of their incorporation in a political\r\nsystem under one Crown. We know, by a mass of experience from Federal\r\nand other systems, that elements the most diverse in language, religion,\r\nwealth, and tradition may be welded together for common action, provided\r\nthat the union be voluntary and the freedom of the separate parts be\r\npreserved. The first conditions of a true union were lacking in the case\r\nof Ireland. The arrangement was not voluntary. It was accompanied by\r\ngross breach of faith, and it signified enslavement, not liberty.\r\n\r\nA true Union was not even attempted. The Government of Ireland, in\r\neffect, and for the most part in form, was still that of a conquered\r\nColonial Dependency. It was no more representative in any practical\r\nsense after the Union than before the Union. The popular vote was\r\nsubmerged in a hostile assembly far away. The Irish peerage was regarded\r\nrightly by the Irish people as the very symbol of their own degradation,\r\nthe Union having been purchased with titles, and titles having been for\r\na century past the price paid for the servility of Anglo-Irish\r\nstatesmen. But the peerage, in the persons of the twenty-eight\r\nrepresentatives sent to Westminster, still remained a powerful nucleus\r\nof anti-Irish opinion, infecting the House of Lords with anti-Irish\r\nprejudice, and often opposing a last barrier to reform when the\r\nopposition of the British House of Commons had been painfully overcome.\r\nIn truth the cardinal reforms of the nineteenth century were obtained,\r\nnot by persuasion, but by unconstitutional violence in Ireland itself.\r\nThere was still a separate Executive in Ireland, a separate system of\r\nlocal administration, and until 1817 a separate financial system, all of\r\nthem wholly outside Irish control. The only change of constitutional\r\nimportance was that the Viceroy gradually became a figure-head, and his\r\nautocratic powers, similar to those of the Governor of a Crown Colony,\r\nwere transferred to the Chief Secretary, who was a member of the British\r\nMinistry. Gradually, as the activity of Government increased, there grew\r\nup that grotesque system of nominated and irresponsible Boards which at\r\nthe present day is the laughing-stock of the civilized world. The whole\r\npatronage remained as before, either directly or indirectly, in English\r\nhands. If it was no longer manipulated in ways frankly corrupt, it was\r\nmanipulated in a fashion just as deleterious to Ireland. Before, as\r\nafter, the Union there was no public career in Ireland for an Irishman\r\nwho was in sympathy with the great majority of his countrymen. To win\r\nthe prizes of public life, judgeships, official posts, and the rest, it\r\nwas not absolutely necessary to be a Protestant, though for a long time\r\nall important offices were held exclusively, and are still held mainly,\r\nby Protestants; but it was absolutely necessary to be a thoroughgoing\r\nsupporter of the Ascendancy, and in thoroughgoing hostility to Irish\r\npublic opinion as a whole. In other words, the unwritten Penal Code was\r\npreserved after the abolition of the written enactments, and was used\r\nfor precisely the same pernicious purpose. It was a subtle and sustained\r\nattempt \"to debauch the intellect of Ireland,\" as Mr. Locker-Lampson\r\nputs it, to denationalize her, and to make her own hands the instrument\r\nof her humiliation. The Bar was the principal sufferer, because now, as\r\nbefore, it was the principal road to humiliation. Fitzgibbons\r\nmultiplied, so that for generations after the Union some of the ablest\r\nIrish lawyers were engaged in the hateful business of holding up their\r\nown people to execration in the eyes of the world, of combating\r\nlegislation imperatively needed for Ireland, and of framing and carrying\r\ninto execution laws which increased the maladies they were intended to\r\nallay.\r\n\r\nLet nobody think these phenomena are peculiar to Ireland. In many parts\r\nof the world where Ascendancies have existed, or exist, the same methods\r\nare employed, and always with a certain measure of success. Irish moral\r\nfibre was at least as tough as that of any other nationality in\r\nresisting the poison.\r\n\r\nBut the results were as calamitous in Ireland as in other countries. No\r\ncountry can progress under such circumstances. The test of government is\r\nthe condition of the people governed. Judged by this criterion, it is no\r\nexaggeration to say that Ireland as a whole went backward for at least\r\nseventy years after the Union. Even Protestant North-East Ulster, with\r\nits saving custom of tenant-right, its linen industry, and all the\r\nspecial advantages derived from a century of privilege, though it\r\nescaped the worst effects of the depression, suffered by emigration\r\nalmost as heavily as the rest of Ireland, and built up its industries\r\nwith proportionate difficulty. Over the rest of Ireland the main\r\nfeatures of the story are continuous from a period long antecedent to\r\nthe Union. A student of the condition of the Irish peasantry in the\r\neighteenth and in the first three-quarters of the nineteenth centuries\r\ncan ignore changes in the form or personnel of government. He would\r\nscarcely be aware, unless he travelled outside his subject, that\r\nGrattan's Parliament ever existed, or that subsequently a long\r\nsuccession of Whig and Tory Ministers, differing profoundly in their\r\npolitical principles, had alternately sent over to Ireland Chief\r\nSecretaries with theoretically despotic powers for good or evil. These\r\n\"transient and embarrassed phantoms\" came and went, leaving their\r\nreputations behind them, and the country they were responsible for in\r\nmuch the same condition.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to enter in detail into the history of Ireland in\r\nthe nineteenth century, but only to note a few salient points which will\r\nhelp us to a comparison with the progress of other parts of the Empire.\r\nIt is necessary to repeat that the basis upon which the whole economic\r\nstructure of Ireland rested, the Irish agrarian system, was inconsistent\r\nwith social peace and an absolute bar to progress. I described in\r\nChapter I. how it came into being and the collateral mischiefs attending\r\nit. During the nineteenth century, by accident or design, these\r\nmischiefs were greatly aggravated. Until 1815 high war prices and the\r\nlow Catholic franchise stimulated subdivision of holdings, already\r\nexcessively small, and the growth of population. With the peace came\r\nevictions, conversions into pasture, and consolidation of farms. The\r\ndisfranchisement of the mass of the peasantry which accompanied\r\nEmancipation in 1829 inspired fresh clearances on a large scale and\r\ncaused unspeakable misery, with further congestion on the worst\r\nagricultural land. \"Cottier\" tenancy, at a competitive rent, and\r\nterminable without compensation for the improvements which were made\r\nexclusively by the tenant, was general over the greater part of Ireland.\r\nGenerally it was tenancy-at-will, with perpetual liability to eviction.\r\nLeaseholders, however, were under conditions almost as onerous. The\r\nlabourer, who was allowed a small plot, which he paid for in labour,\r\nwas in the worst plight of all. In addition, burdensome tithes were\r\ncollected by an alien Church and rents were largely spent abroad. If\r\nIrish manufactures had not been destroyed, and there had been an outlet\r\nfrom agriculture into industry, the evil effects of the agrarian system\r\nwould have been mitigated. As it was, in one of the richest and most\r\nfertile countries in the world the congestion and poverty were\r\nappalling. Competition for land meant the struggle for bare life. Rent\r\nhad no relation to value, but was the price fixed by the frantic bidding\r\nof hungry peasants for the bare right to live. The tenant had no\r\ninterest in improving the land, because the penalty for improvement was\r\na higher rent, fixed after another bout of frantic competition.\r\n\r\n\"Almost alone amongst mankind,\" wrote John Stuart Mill,[19] \"the cottier\r\nis in this condition, that he can scarcely be either better or worse off\r\nby any act of his own. If he were industrious or prudent, nobody but his\r\nlandlord would gain; if he is lazy or intemperate, it is at his\r\nlandlord's expense. A situation more devoid of motives to either labour\r\nor self-command, imagination itself cannot conceive. The inducements of\r\nfree human beings are taken away, _and those of a slave not\r\nsubstituted_. He has nothing to hope, and nothing to fear, except being\r\ndispossessed of his holding, and against this he protects himself by the\r\n_ultima ratio_ of a defensive civil war. Rockism and Whiteboyism were\r\nthe determination of a people, who had nothing that could be called\r\ntheirs but a daily meal of the lowest description of food, not to submit\r\nto being deprived of that for other people's convenience.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not, then, a bitter satire on the mode in which opinions are\r\nformed on the most important problems of human nature and life, to find\r\npublic instructors of the greatest pretension imputing the backwardness\r\nof Irish industry, and the want of energy of the Irish people in\r\nimproving their condition, to a peculiar indolence and insouciance in\r\nthe Celtic race? Of all vulgar modes of escaping from the consideration\r\nof the effect of social and moral influences on the human mind, the most\r\nvulgar is that of attributing the diversities of conduct and character\r\nto inherent natural differences.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"civil war\" referred to by Mill as the _ultima ratio_ of the\r\ncottier tenant went on intermittently for ninety years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, as it had gone on during the eighteenth century, and was met by\r\ncoercive laws of the same general stamp. Until Mr. Gladstone took the\r\nquestion in hand in 1870, no reformer could get a hearing in Parliament.\r\nBill after Bill, privately introduced, met with contemptuous rejection\r\nin favour of some senseless measure of semi-military coercion. There\r\ncan, I believe, be no doubt that responsible Irish opinion, made\r\neffective, would have grappled with the evil firmly and conscientiously.\r\nUntil the peasant class was driven to the last pitch of desperation,\r\ntheir leaders did not conceive, and, indeed, never wholly succeeded in\r\nimplanting, the idea of a complete overthrowal of landlordism. The\r\npeasant was not unwilling to pay rent. He had, and still has, a deep,\r\ninstinctive respect for a landed aristocracy, and was ready, and is\r\nstill ready, to repay good treatment with an intensity of devotion\r\ndifficult to parallel in other parts of the United Kingdom. In that\r\nveritably cataclysmic dispersion of the Irish race which ensued upon the\r\ngreat famine, rent continued to be paid at home out of sums remitted\r\nfrom relatives in America. No less than nineteen millions of money were\r\nthus remitted, according to the Emigration Commissioners of 1863,\r\nbetween 1847 and that date. The Roman Catholic Church, as in every part\r\nof the world, was strongly on the side of law and order, and, indeed, on\r\nmany occasions stepped in to condemn disorder legitimately provoked by\r\nintolerable suffering. The wealthy and educated landlord class, face to\r\nface in a free Parliament with the tenant class, including, be it\r\nremembered, the Ulster Protestant tenants, with grievances less acute in\r\ndegree, but similar in kind, would have consented to meet reform halfway\r\nunder the stimulus of patriotism and an enlightened self-interest.\r\nAgainst the great majority of Irish landlords there was no personal\r\ncharge. They came into incomes derived from a certain source under\r\nancient laws for which they were not responsible. But, acting through\r\nthe ascendancy Parliament far away in London, they remained, as an\r\norganized class--for we must always make allowance for an enlightened\r\nand public-spirited minority--blind to their own genuine interests and\r\nto the demands of humane policy. Their responsibility was transferred to\r\nEnglish statesmen, who were not fitted, by temperament or training, to\r\nundertake it, and who always looked at the Irish land question, which\r\nhad no counterpart in England, through English spectacles. We cannot\r\nattribute their failure to lack of information. At every stage there was\r\nplenty of unbiassed and instructed testimony, Whig and Tory, Protestant\r\nand Catholic, independent and official, as to the nature and origin of\r\nthe trouble. Mill and Bright, in 1862, only emphasized what Arthur Young\r\nhad said in 1772, and what Edward Wakefield, Sharman Crawford, Michael\r\nSadler, Poulett Scrope, and many other writers, thinkers, and\r\npoliticians had confirmed in the intervening period, and what every\r\nfair-minded man admits now to be the truth. Commission after Commission\r\nreported the main facts correctly, if the remedies they proposed were\r\ninadequate. The Devon Commission, reporting in 1845, on the eve of the\r\ngreat famine, condemned the prevalent agrarian tenure, and recommended\r\nthe statutory establishment of the Ulster custom of tenant right. A very\r\nmild and cautious Bill was introduced and dropped.\r\n\r\nNext year came the famine, revealing in an instant the rottenness of the\r\neconomic foundations upon which the welfare of Ireland depended. The\r\npopulation had swollen from four millions in 1788 to nearly eight and a\r\nhalf millions in 1846, an unhealthy expansion, due to the well-known law\r\nof propagation in inverse ratio to the adequacy of subsistence. What\r\nhappened was merely the failure of the potato-crop, not a serious matter\r\nin most countries, but in Ireland the cause of starvation to\r\nthree-quarters of a million persons, and the starting-point of that vast\r\nexodus which in the last half of the nineteenth century drained Ireland\r\nof nearly four million souls. The famine passed, and with it all\r\nrecollection of the report of the Devon Commission. Hitherto most of the\r\nland legislation had been designed to facilitate evictions. Now came the\r\nEncumbered Estates Act of 1849, whose purpose was to facilitate the\r\nbuying out of bankrupt Irish landlords, and whose effect was to\r\nperpetuate the old agrarian system under a new set of more mercenary\r\nlandlords, pursuing the old policy of rack-rents and evictions. In the\r\nthree years 1849-1852, 58,423 families were evicted, or 306,120 souls.\r\nAroused from the stupor of the famine, the peasants had to retaliate\r\nwith the same old defensive policy of outrage. Peaceful agitation was\r\nof no use. The Tenant League of North and South, formed in 1852, claimed\r\nin vain the simplest of the rights granted under pressure of violence in\r\n1870 and 1881.\r\n\r\nViolence, indeed, was the only efficient lever in Ireland for any but\r\nsecondary reforms until the last fifteen years of the century, when a\r\nremedial policy was spontaneously adopted, with the general consent of\r\nBritish statesmen and parties. Fear inspired the Emancipation Act of\r\n1829, which was recommended to Parliament by the Duke of Wellington as a\r\nmeasure wrong in itself, but necessary to avert an organized rebellion\r\nin Ireland. Tithes, the unjust burden of a century and a half, were only\r\ncommuted in 1838, after a Seven Years' War revolting in its incidents.\r\nMr. Gladstone admitted, and no one who studies the course of events can\r\ndeny, that without the Fenianism of the sixties, and the light thrown\r\nthereby on the condition of Ireland, it would have been impossible to\r\ncarry the Act--again overdue by a century--for the disestablishment of\r\nthe Irish Church in 1869, or the Land Act, timid and ineffectual as it\r\nwas, of 1870. Without the organized lawlessness of the Land League it\r\nwould have been equally impossible to bring about those more drastic\r\nchanges in Irish land tenure which, amidst storms of protest from vested\r\ninterests affected, were initiated under the great Land Act of 1881,\r\nand, after another miserable decade of crime and secret conspiracy,\r\nextended by the Acts of 1887, 1891, and 1896.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the effect of these Acts was to establish three principles: a\r\nfair rent, fixed by a judicial tribunal, the Land Commission, and\r\nrevisable every fifteen years; fixity of tenure as long as the rent is\r\npaid; and free sale of the tenant-right.\r\n\r\nThe remedy eventually brought widespread relief, but, from a social and\r\neconomic standpoint, it was not the right remedy. There is no security\r\nfor good legislation unless it be framed by those who are to live under\r\nit. Constructive thought in Ireland for the solution of her own\r\ndifficulties and the harmonizing of her own discordant elements had been\r\nsystematically dammed, or diverted into revolutionary excesses, which,\r\nin the traditional spirit of Fitzgibbonism, were made the pretext for\r\nmore stupid torture. Thus, O'Connell, whose attachment to law was so\r\nstrong that in 1843, when the Repeal agitation had reached seemingly\r\nirresistible proportions, he deliberately restrained it, was tried for\r\nsedition. So, too, were dissipated the brilliant talents of the Young\r\nIreland group and the grave statesmanship of Isaac Butt. Fits intervened\r\nof a penitent and bungling philanthropy which has left its traces on\r\nnearly all Irish institutions. For example, it was decided in 1830 that\r\nthe Irish must be educated, and a system was set up which was\r\ndeliberately designed to anglicize Ireland and extirpate Roman\r\nCatholicism. Four years later, in defiance of Irish opinion, a Poor Law\r\npedantically copied from the English model was applied to Ireland. The\r\nrailway system also was grossly mismanaged. And so with the land. When\r\nreform eventually came, the evil had gone too far, and it was beyond the\r\nart of the ablest and noblest Englishmen, inheriting English conceptions\r\nof the rights of landed property, to devise any means of placing the\r\nrelations between landlord and tenant in Ireland, inhuman and absurd as\r\nthey were, on a sound and durable basis. The dual ownership set up by\r\nthe Land Acts was more humane, but in some respects no less absurd and\r\nmischievous. It exasperated the landlord, while, by placing before the\r\ntenant the continual temptation of further reductions in rent, it tended\r\nto check good cultivation.\r\n\r\nMen came to realize at last that the complete expropriation of the\r\nlandlords through the State-aided purchase of the land was the only\r\nlogical resource, and this process, begun tentatively and on a very\r\nsmall scale as far back as 1870, under the inspiration of John Bright,\r\nand extended under a series of other Acts, was eventually set in motion\r\non a vast scale by the Wyndham Act of 1903.\r\n\r\nI leave a final review of Purchase and of other quite recent remedial\r\nlegislation, as well as the far more important movements for\r\nregeneration from within, to later chapters. Meanwhile, let us pause for\r\na moment and pronounce upon the political system which made such havoc\r\nin Ireland. All this havoc, all this incalculable waste of life, energy,\r\nbrains, and loyalty, was preventable and unnecessary. Ethics and honour\r\napart, where was the common sense of the legislative Union? Would it\r\nhave been possible to design a system better calculated to embitter,\r\nimpoverish, and demoralize a valuable portion of the Empire?\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our eyes across the Atlantic, and observe the effects of\r\nan Imperial policy founded on the same root idea.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] \"Principles of Political Economy,\" vol. ii., p. 392.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCANADA AND IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn comparing the history of Canada with the closely allied history of\r\nIreland, we must bear in mind that in the last half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the present British North America consisted of three distinct\r\nportions: Acadia, or the Maritime Provinces, which we now know as\r\nNewfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island,\r\ncolonized originally by a few Frenchmen and later by Scotch and Irish;\r\nLower Canada, extensively colonized by the French, which we now know as\r\nthe Province of Quebec; and Upper Canada, which we now know as Ontario,\r\ncolonized last of all by Americans under circumstances to be described.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, before the repeal of any part of the Penal Code against Irish\r\nRoman Catholics, the French Catholic Colony of Lower Canada, with a\r\npopulation of about seventy thousand souls and the two small towns of\r\nQuebec and Montreal, passed definitely into British possession under the\r\nTreaty of Paris, which brought to a conclusion the Seven Years' War.\r\nFortunately, there was no question, as in Ireland, of expropriating the\r\nowners of the soil in favour of State-aided British planters, and hence\r\nno question of a Penal Code, even on the moderate scale current in Great\r\nBritain at the same period. On the contrary, it became a matter of\r\nurgent practical expediency to conciliate the conquered Province in view\r\nof the growing disaffection of the American Colonies bordering it on the\r\nSouth. This disaffection, assuming ominous proportions on the enactment\r\nof the Stamp Act in 1765, was itself an indirect result of the conquest\r\nof Canada a few years before; for the claim to tax the Americans for\r\nImperial purposes arose from the enormous expense of the war of conquest\r\nand of the subsequent charges for defence and upkeep. It was forgotten\r\nthat American volunteers had captured Louisburg in 1745, and had borne\r\na distinguished part in later operations, and that to lay a compulsory\r\ntax upon them would banish glorious memories common to America and\r\nBritain. Henceforward, conquered French Canada was made a political\r\nbulwark against rebellious America. The French colonists, a peaceable,\r\nprimitive folk, as attached to their religion as the Irish, and devoted\r\nmainly to agriculture, retained, as long as they desired it, the old\r\nFrench system of law known as the Custom of Paris and the free exercise\r\nof their religion. Like the Irish, they were strongly monarchical and\r\nstrongly conservative in feeling, and as impervious to the Republican\r\npropaganda emanating from their American neighbours as the Catholic\r\nIrish always at heart remained to the revolutionary principles of Wolfe\r\nTone's school. Unmolested in their habits and possessions, they\r\nphilosophically accepted the transference from the Bourbon to the\r\nHanoverian dynasty, and became an indispensable source of strength to\r\nGeorge III. when that monarch was using his German troops to coerce his\r\nAmerican subjects and his British troops to overawe the Ulster\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, immediately before the outbreak of a war against which Ireland\r\nwas protesting, and in which, with the soundest justification, the\r\nIrish-Americans, Catholic and Protestant, took such a prominent part\r\nagainst the British arms, the Quebec Act was passed giving formal\r\nstatutory sanction to the Catholic religion, and setting up a nominated\r\nlegislative Council, whose members were subject to no religious test. In\r\nIreland it was not till six years later, and, as we have seen, by means\r\nof precisely the same pressure--British fear of America--that the Irish\r\nProtestant Volunteers obtained the abolition of the test for Dissenters,\r\nwhile Catholics in Ireland were still little more than outlaws, and had\r\nto wait for nearly sixty years for complete emancipation. The result of\r\nthe Quebec Act, together with the sympathetic administration of that\r\ngreat Irishman, Sir Guy Carleton, was the firm allegiance of the French\r\nProvince in spite of an exceedingly formidable invasion, during the\r\nwhole of the American War, and even after the intervention of European\r\nFrance. It is part of the dramatic irony of these occurrences that some\r\nof the invading army was composed of Morgan's Irish-American riflemen,\r\nand that one of the two joint leaders of the invasion was the\r\nIrish-American, General Richard Montgomery, who fell at the unsuccessful\r\nassault of Quebec on December 31, 1775.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Burke's noble appeal in the House of Commons, toleration in\r\nthe abstract had nothing to do with the treatment of the French\r\nCatholics. British Catholics in the neighbouring Prince Edward Island\r\nwere denied all civil rights in 1770, and only gained them in 1830. In\r\nEngland, the Quebec Act with difficulty survived a storm of indignation,\r\nin which even Chatham joined. The small minority of British settled in\r\nQuebec and Montreal made vehement protests, while the American Congress\r\nitself in 1774 committed the irreparable blunder of making the\r\nestablishment of the Roman Catholic religion in Canada one of its\r\nformally published grievances against Great Britain. When war broke out,\r\nand the magnitude of the mistake was seen, efforts were made to seduce\r\nthe Canadians by hints of a coming British tyranny, but the Canadians\r\nvery naturally abode by their first impressions.\r\n\r\nThe peace of 1783 and the final recognition of American Independence led\r\nto results of far-reaching importance for the further development of the\r\nBritish Empire. Out of the loss of the American Colonies came the\r\nfoundation of Australia and of British Canada. Before the war it had\r\nbeen the custom to send convicts from the United Kingdom to penal\r\nsettlements in the American Colonies. The United States stopped this\r\ntraffic. Pitt's Government decided, after several years of doubt and\r\ndelay, to divert the stream of convicts to the newly acquired and still\r\nunpopulated territory of New South Wales, made known by the voyages of\r\nCaptain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks. At the same period a very different\r\nclass of men, seeking a new home, were thrown upon the charity of the\r\nBritish Government. These were the \"United Empire Loyalists,\" as they\r\nstyled themselves, some 40,000 Americans, with a sprinkling of Irishmen\r\namong them, such as Luke Carscallion, Peter Daly, Willet Casey, and John\r\nCanniff,[20] who had fought on the Royalist side throughout the war, and\r\nat the end of it found their fortunes ruined and themselves the objects\r\nof keen resentment. Pitt, with a \"total lack of Imperial imagination,\"\r\nas Mr. Holland Rose puts it,[21] does not seem to have considered the\r\nplan of colonizing Australia with a part of these men, 433 of whom were\r\nreported to be living in destitution in London three years after the\r\nwar. No more alacrity was shown in relieving the distress of those still\r\nin America. In 1788, however, a million and a quarter pounds were voted\r\nby Parliament for relief, and large grants of land were made in Canada,\r\nwhither most of the Loyalists had already begun to emigrate. Some went\r\nto the Maritime Provinces, notably to the region now known as New\r\nBrunswick; a few went to the towns of the Quebec Province, for the\r\ncountry lands on the lower reaches of the St. Lawrence were already\r\nmonopolized by the French \"habitants\"; the rest, estimated at 10,000, to\r\nthe upper reaches of the St. Lawrence and along the shores of the Lakes\r\nOntario and Erie, in short, to what we now know as the Province of\r\nOntario, and to what then became known as Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment the three Canadas gain sharp definition. To the west\r\nUpper Canada, exclusively American or, as we must now say, British in\r\ncharacter; next to the east, and cutting off its neighbour from the sea,\r\nthe ancient Province of Lower Canada, predominantly French, with a\r\nminority of British traders in the two towns Quebec and Montreal; last\r\nof all the Maritime Provinces, small communities with an almost\r\nindependent history of their own, although, like Upper and Lower Canada,\r\nthey eventually presented a problem similar fundamentally to the Irish\r\nproblem on the other side of the Atlantic. Prince Edward Island is the\r\nclosest parallel, for, besides the Catholic disabilities of 1770, in\r\n1767 the whole of its land had been granted away by ballot in a single\r\nday to a handful of absentee English proprietors, who sublet to\r\noccupiers without security of tenure, with the result that a land\r\nquestion similar to that of Ireland arose, which inflamed society and\r\nretarded the development of the island for a whole century. Ultimately,\r\nmoreover, statesmen were driven to an even more drastic\r\nsolution--compulsory and universal State-aided land purchase.[22] Before\r\nthe period we have now reached, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island,\r\nwhich was carved out of it, had been given rude systems of\r\nrepresentative Government, and New Brunswick, also at one time a part of\r\nNova Scotia, received a Constitution in 1784.\r\n\r\nThe great question after the American War was how to govern the two\r\ncontiguous Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, the one newly settled by\r\nmen of British race and Protestant faith, the other also under the\r\nBritish flag, but overwhelmingly French and Catholic, both, in the\r\ncritical half-century to come, to be reinforced by immigrants from the\r\nOld World, and to a large extent from misgoverned Ireland. But let the\r\nreader once and for all grasp this point, that, once out of Ireland,\r\nthere ceases, not immediately, but in course of time, to be any racial\r\nor political distinction between the different classes of Irishmen,\r\nwhose antagonism at home, artificially provoked and fomented by the bad\r\nform of government under which they lived, so often made Ireland itself\r\na very hell on earth. I want to dwell on this point in order to avoid\r\nconfusion when I speak of the bi-racial conditions of Lower Canada and\r\nIreland respectively.\r\n\r\nTo return to the question of Government. The American Colonies were\r\nlost. Here in Canada was an opportunity for a new Imperial policy,\r\nbetter calculated to retain the affections of the colonists. Three\r\ndistinct problems were involved:\r\n\r\n1. Was French or Lower Canada, with its small minority of British, to be\r\ngiven representative Government at all?\r\n\r\n2. If so, was it to be left as a separate unit, or was it to be\r\namalgamated in a Union with its neighbour, Upper Canada?\r\n\r\n3. Whichever course was taken, what was to be the relation between the\r\nHome Government and Canada?\r\n\r\nAll these questions arise in the case of Ireland itself, and the\r\nparallel in each case is interesting. In Canada they were determined for\r\nthe space of half a century by the Constitutional Act of 1791, passed at\r\nthe period when Grattan's unreformed Parliament was hastening to its\r\nfall, and Wolfe Tone was founding his Society of United Irishmen. Let us\r\ntake in turn the three questions posed above.\r\n\r\n1. The British minority in Lower Canada, supported by a corresponding\r\nschool in England, were strong for an undisguised British ascendancy,\r\nwithout any recognition of the French. They urged, what was true, that\r\nthe French were unaccustomed to representative government, and implied,\r\nwhat was neither true nor politic, that they could not, and ought not\r\nto, be educated to it. If there was to be an Assembly at all, it should,\r\nthey claimed, be wholly British and Protestant, or, in the alternative,\r\nthe Protestant minority only should be represented at Westminster. In\r\nother words, they wished either for the pre-Union Irish system or for\r\nthe post-Union Irish system, both of them, as time was just beginning to\r\nprove, equally disastrous to the interests of Ireland. We are not\r\nsurprised to find these ideas supported by the Irishman Burke, in whom\r\nhorror of the French Revolution had destroyed the last particle of\r\nLiberalism. If Pitt lacked \"Imperial imagination,\" he knew more than\r\nmost of his contemporaries about the elementary principles of governing\r\nwhite men. It was only a few years before that he had urged upon his\r\nIrish Viceroy, Rutland, a reform of the Irish Parliament which might\r\nhave united the races and averted all the disasters to come, and in this\r\nvery year (1791) he was pressing forward the Catholic franchise in\r\nIreland. The French in Canada must, he said, be represented in a popular\r\nAssembly equally with the British, and on the broadest possible\r\nfranchise, and they were.\r\n\r\n2. The next question was that of the union or separation of Upper and\r\nLower Canada. Here, and from the same underlying motive, the British\r\nminority in Lower Canada were for the Union, partly on commercial\r\ngrounds, but mainly as a step in the direction of overcoming French\r\ninfluence. Upper Canada, wholly British, was, on the whole, neutral.\r\nPitt, on high principle, again took correct ground. He did not, indeed,\r\nforesee that separation, for geographical reasons, would cause certain\r\ninconveniences; but he did understand--and experience in both Provinces\r\nultimately proved him right--that it was absolutely hopeless to try and\r\navert social and racial discord by artificially swamping the French\r\nelement. He declared, then, for the separation of the two Canadas into\r\ntwo distinct Provinces. Note the beginnings of another, though a\r\ndistant, analogy with the relations of Ireland and Great Britain,\r\ndistant because the French at this time largely outnumbered the British\r\nof both Provinces, and in after-years maintained something very near a\r\nnumerical equality. But the same underlying principle was involved.\r\nPitt, in the Legislative Union of Ireland and Great Britain nine years\r\nlater, constructed without geographical necessity, indeed, in defiance\r\nof geography and humanity, the very system which, in a form by\r\ncomparison almost innocuous, he had condemned for Canada; but not, we\r\nmust in fairness remember, before doing his part at an earlier date to\r\narrive at a solution which, given a fair chance, would have rendered the\r\nUnion of Ireland and England unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. So far, good. But there still remained a further question far\r\ntranscending the other in importance--What was to be the relation\r\nbetween the Home Government and the new Colonies? Here all British\r\nintellects, that of Fox alone excepted, were as much at a loss as ever.\r\nOne simple deduction was made from what had happened in America, namely,\r\nthat the new Colonies must not be forced to contribute to Imperial funds\r\nby taxes levied from London. That claim had already been abandoned in\r\n1778 by the Colonial Tax Repeal Act, which nevertheless expressly\r\nreserved the King's right to levy \"such duties as it may be expedient to\r\nimpose for the regulation of commerce,\" the sum so raised to be retained\r\nfor the use of the Colony. No one made the more comprehensive deduction,\r\neven in the case of wholly British Upper Canada, that Colonial affairs\r\nshould be controlled by Colonial opinion, constitutionally ascertained,\r\nand that the British Governor should act primarily through advisers\r\nchosen by the majority of the people under his rule. We must bear in\r\nmind that, had Grattan's Parliament been reformed, and the warring races\r\nin Ireland been brought into harmony, it would still have had to pass\r\nthrough the crucial phase of establishing its right to choose Ministers\r\nby whose advice the Lord-Lieutenant should be guided, that is, if it\r\nwere to become a true Home Rule Parliament of the kind we aim at to-day.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the Constitutional Act passed for Canada in 1791, it\r\ntook fifty-six troubled years and an armed rebellion in each Province to\r\nestablish the principle of what we call \"responsible Government\" for\r\nCanada, and, through Canada, for the rest of the white Colonies of the\r\nEmpire. During these fifty-six years, which correspond in Irish history\r\nto a period dating from the middle of Grattan's Parliament down to the\r\ngreat Famine, ascendancies, with the symptoms of disease which always\r\nattended ascendancies, grew up in Canada, as they had in Ireland, in\r\nspite of conditions which were far more favourable in Canada to healthy\r\npolitical growth. Canada started with this great advantage over Ireland,\r\nthat instead of a corrupt parody of a Parliament, each of her Provinces,\r\nunder the Constitutional Act of 1791, had a real popular Assembly,\r\nelected without regard to race or religion. It was the Upper House or\r\nLegislative Council, as it was called, that interposed the first\r\nobstacle to the free working of popular institutions. In both Provinces\r\nthis Council was nominated by the Governor, and could be used, and was\r\nnaturally used, to represent minority interests and obstruct the popular\r\nassembly. Fox had correctly prophesied that it would soon come \"to\r\ninspire hatred and contempt.\" But he did not mean that such a chamber\r\nwas in itself an insuperable bar to harmony. Nominated or hereditary\r\nsecond chambers are not necessarily inconsistent with popular\r\ngovernment, provided that the Executive Government itself possesses the\r\nconfidence of the representative Assembly. Under that lever, obstruction\r\neventually gives way. But this idea of a tie of confidence between the\r\nGovernors and the governed was exactly what was lacking.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Council in each Province was also chosen by the British\r\nGovernor or Lieutenant-Governor, generally a military man, from persons\r\nrepresenting either his own purely British policy or the ideas of a\r\nprivileged colonial minority, and without regard to the wishes or\r\nopinions of the Colonial Assembly, just as the Executive officers in\r\nIreland, both before and after the Union, were chosen out of\r\ncorresponding elements by the Lord-Lieutenant or Chief Secretary, acting\r\nunder the orders of the British Government, and without any regard to\r\nthe wishes or opinions of the majority of Irishmen. Behind all, in\r\nremote Downing Street stood the British Government, in the shape of the\r\nColonial Office for Canada and the Irish Office for Ireland, both\r\nworking in dense ignorance of the real needs of the countries for which\r\nthey were responsible, and permeated with prejudice and pedantry. To\r\ncomplete the parallel, there was now a foreign Power in the close\r\nneighbourhood of each dependency, the United States in the case of\r\nCanada, France in the case of Ireland, both of them Republican Powers,\r\nand both able and willing to take advantage of disaffection in the\r\ndependencies in order to further a quarrel with the Mother Country. We\r\nhave seen the results in Ireland. Let us now observe the results in\r\nCanada, taking especial care to notice that an ascendancy Government\r\ngives rise to the same type of evil in a uni-racial as in a bi-racial\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nLet us glance first at what happened in Upper Canada, which was\r\nuni-racial, that is, composed of settlers from the United Kingdom\r\n(including Ireland) and America. Here the original settlers, the \"United\r\nEmpire Loyalists\" from America, formed from the first, and maintained\r\nfor half a century, an ascendancy of wealth and religion over the\r\nincoming settlers, who soon constituted the majority of the population.\r\nAs in Ireland, though in a degree small by comparison, there was a land\r\nquestion and a religious question, closely related to one another.\r\nHappily, it was not a case of robbery, but of simple monopoly.\r\nExcessively large grants of land, nine-tenths of which remained\r\nuncultivated, were obtained by the original settlers, most of whom were\r\nEpiscopalian in faith, and, under the Act of 1791, further tracts of\r\nenormous extent, which for the most part lay waste and idle, were set\r\napart in each township, under the name of \"Clergy Reserves\" for the\r\nEpiscopalian Church. Since the majority of the incoming settlers were\r\nPresbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, or Roman Catholics, many of them\r\nfrom the Protestant and Catholic parts of Ireland, some from America,\r\nsome even from Germany, these conditions caused intense irritation,\r\nchecking both the development of the country and the growth of solid\r\ncharacter among the colonists. Absentee ownership was a grave economic\r\nevil, though happily it was not complicated and embittered by a vicious\r\nsystem of tenure. Education suffered severely through the diversion of\r\nthe income from public lands to private purposes.\r\n\r\nThe ascendancy was maintained on lines familiar in Ireland--through the\r\nmutual dependence of the colonial minority and the Home Government\r\nacting through its Governor. A few leading Episcopalian families from\r\namong the United Empire Loyalists, installed at Toronto, with the\r\nsupport of a succession of High Tory Lieutenant-Governors, monopolized\r\nthe Executive Council, the Legislative Council, the Bench, the Bar, and\r\nall offices of profit, denying a Canadian career to the vast majority of\r\nUpper Canadians, just as Irishmen were excluded from an Irish career.\r\nFor a long time the Assembly itself, which retained its original\r\nConstitution long after the influx of immigrants had rendered necessary\r\nits enlargement on a new electoral basis, was a subject of monopoly\r\nalso. Even when enlarged in 1821 it was helpless against the nominated\r\nCouncil and Executive, backed by Downing Street. The oligarchy came to\r\nbe known by the name of the \"family compact,\" and, as the reader will\r\nobserve, it bore a close resemblance in form to the \"undertaker\" system\r\nin Ireland before the Union, and to the monopoly of patronage obtained\r\nby certain families, notably the Beresfords.\r\n\r\nWhile the Colony was still small, the system worked tolerably well; but\r\nfrom the second decade of the nineteenth century onwards, when the\r\npopulation grew from 150,000 to 250,000 in 1832, and to 500,000 a few\r\nyears later, and the Episcopalians sank into a numerical minority as low\r\nas a quarter, troubles of the Irish type became proportionately acute.\r\nThe Colony was in reality perfectly content with its position under the\r\nCrown, and in the war with America in 1812 all classes and creeds united\r\nto repel invasion with enthusiasm. One of the prominent leaders was an\r\nIrishman, James Fitzgibbon, and a poor Irish private, James O'Hara, won\r\nfame by refusing to surrender at the capture of Toronto Fort. As usual,\r\nhowever, a fictitious standard of \"loyalty,\" which, in fact, meant\r\nprivilege, was set up, obscuring those questions of good government\r\nwhich were the only real matters at issue in Canada, as in Ireland.\r\nThere were Republican immigrants of many denominations from America,\r\nRadicals of Cobbett's school from England and Scotland, tenants of a\r\ndemocratic turn from Ulster, and a growing stream of Catholic cottiers\r\nflying from the \"clearances\" and tithe war in other Irish Provinces. All\r\nthese classes of men made excellent settlers, and only wanted fair and\r\nequal treatment to make them perfectly peaceable citizens. To the\r\nofficial oligarchy, however, even their moderate leaders came to be\r\nviewed as rebels, and were often subjected to imprisonment or to\r\nbanishment.\r\n\r\nAmong others William Gourlay, a Scotsman, Stephen Willcocks and Francis\r\nCollins, Irishmen, all three perfectly respectable reformers, suffered\r\nin this way. Bidwell, the great Robert Baldwin, and other good men were\r\nrendered powerless for good. As invariably happens in any part of the\r\nworld where a course is pursued which estranges moderate men and\r\nembitters extreme men, agitators came to the front lacking that\r\nself-control and sense of responsibility which the sobering education of\r\noffice alone can give, and generally ruining themselves while they\r\nbenefit humanity at large. Chief of these was W.L. Mackenzie, a\r\nPresbyterian Scot from Dundee. All this man really wanted was what\r\nexists to-day as a matter of course in all self-governing\r\ncountries--responsible government. He even conceived that great idea of\r\nthe Confederation of British North America, which came to birth in 1867.\r\nThwarted in his attacks on the oligarchy, he degenerated into violent\r\ncourses, and ultimately organized, or rather was provoked into\r\norganizing, the rebellion of 1837. The grievances which led to this\r\noutbreak were genuine and severe, and were all in course of time\r\nadmitted and redressed. One, the powerlessness of the Assembly, owing to\r\nthe control by the Executive of annual sums sufficient to pay the\r\nofficial expenses of Government, corresponded to a pre-Union Irish\r\ngrievance, and was remedied by an Act of 1831. Most of the other\r\ngrievances were incurable by constitutional effort. They may be found\r\nsummarized in the \"Seventh Report of Grievances,\" a temperate and\r\ntruthful document drawn up by a Committee of the Assembly in 1835. The\r\nhuge unsettled Clergy Reserves and Crown Lands were the worst concrete\r\nabuse, and matters had just then been aggravated by the sudden\r\nestablishment of scores of sinecure rectories. Jobbery,\r\nmaladministration, and the dependence of the judges on the Executive\r\nwere other complaints; but the main assault was made quite rightly on\r\nthe form of the Colonial Government, which rendered peaceful reform of\r\nany abuse as impossible as in Ireland, and the cardinal claim was that\r\nthe Executive should act, not under the dictation of Downing Street, of\r\nan irresponsible Governor, or of a narrow colonial oligarchy, but in\r\naccordance with popular opinion. Mackenzie's rebellion of 1837 was a no\r\nmore formidable affair than the similar efforts in Ireland made under\r\nincomparably greater provocation by Emmett in 1803 and Smith O'Brien in\r\n1848, and was as easily suppressed; but, unlike the Irish outbreaks, and\r\nin conjunction with a revolt arising in the same year and from similar\r\ncauses in the adjoining Province of Lower Canada, it led to a complete\r\nchange of system.\r\n\r\nIn Lower Canada the same preposterous system of government was\r\naggravated by the presence of the two races, French and English. Yet\r\nthere was nothing inherently dangerous or unwholesome about this\r\nsituation. The French, like the Catholics in Ireland, never showed the\r\nsmallest tendency towards religious intolerance, nor were they less\r\nloyal at heart than the Radicals of Upper Canada or the Tories of either\r\nProvince. They took the same energetic part in repelling the American\r\ninvasion of 1812, and produced at least one remarkable leader in the\r\nperson of Colonel Salaberry, who commanded the French-Canadian\r\nVoltigeurs. Like their co-religionists in Ireland, they were\r\ntemperamentally averse to Republicanism in any shape, whether on the\r\nAmerican model over the border or on the model of revolutionary France,\r\nwhere Republicanism since 1793 was anti-Catholic and the result of\r\nmiseries and oppressions as bad as those in Ireland; whence, moreover,\r\nmany priests and nobles fled from persecution to Lower Canada. As in\r\neighteenth-century Ireland, we find that the Roman Catholic clergy, the\r\n_seigneurs_ or aristocrats, and the _habitants_ or peasants, were of a\r\nConservative cast, throwing their weight, often even against their own\r\ninterests, into the scale of the established Government, while the\r\nlawyers and journalists alone produced determined agitators. The racial\r\ncleavage, moreover, as in Ireland, was artificially accentuated by the\r\npolitical system. There was in reality a strong community of interest\r\nbetween the British lower class and the French lower class against the\r\ntyranny of an official clique, and to the end a substantial number of\r\nEnglishmen worked with the French for reform; but with the failure of\r\ntheir efforts came that inevitable tightening of the bonds of race, even\r\nagainst interest, which we have seen operating with such lamentable\r\neffect in Ireland. And, as in Ireland, we find the best instincts of\r\nthe people withered and perverted into rebellion by \"Fitzgibbonism,\" the\r\npolicy of distrust and coercion.\r\n\r\nThe British official ascendancy, supreme from the first, became\r\nextraordinarily rigid. The Executive Council and Legislative Council\r\nwere almost entirely British, the Assembly overwhelmingly French. There\r\nwere no regular heads of departments, so that the Governor had no\r\nskilled advice, much less responsible advice. The Councils blocked all\r\nlegislation they disliked, and for more than forty years, by means of\r\nunrestricted control over a large part of the provincial revenues, were\r\nable to defy the Assembly. It will be observed that, although Ireland\r\nnever had anything worth calling an Assembly, her structure both before\r\nand after the Union was essentially the same, in that Irish public\r\nopinion, whether voiced by the Volunteers against the unreformed\r\nParliament or after the Union by the Nationalist party at Westminster,\r\nwas powerless. The existence of a popular Assembly in Canada only made\r\nthe anomalies more obvious.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, marked divergencies of character and less marked\r\ndivergencies of interest between the French majority and the British\r\nminority in Canada. The French, by comparison, were a backward and\r\nconservative race, less well educated and less progressive and energetic\r\nboth in agriculture and commerce than the British. On the other hand,\r\nsubsequent experience showed that, under free constitutional government,\r\nBritish intelligence, wealth, and energy would, here as elsewhere, have\r\npreserved their full legitimate influence. Under a system which\r\nthrottled French ideas and aspirations, and treated the most harmless\r\npopular movements as treasonable machinations, deadlock and anarchy were\r\nin the long run inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe popular demands were much the same as those in Upper Canada: control\r\nof the purse, the independence of the judges, an elective Legislative\r\nCouncil, and a curtailment of the arbitrary powers and privileges of the\r\nExecutive, which led to gross jobbery, favouritism, and extravagance. As\r\nin Upper Canada, the greatest practical grievance, though it assumed a\r\nsomewhat different form, was the disposal of the public lands. Here,\r\ntoo, there were extensive and undeveloped Clergy Reserves for the\r\nEpiscopalian Church, as well as free grants on a large scale to\r\nspeculators. The estates of the Jesuit Order had been confiscated, so\r\nthat disputes about their disposal were tinged with religious\r\nbitterness. But most of the friction over the land question came from\r\nthe operations of a chartered land company, which, under the protection\r\nof the Government, and with financial and political support from\r\nEngland, dealt with the unsettled land in a manner very unfair and often\r\ncorrupt, and promoted here, as in Upper Canada and Ireland, absentee\r\nownership.\r\n\r\nThe popular agitation ran the same course as in Upper Canada, reached\r\nits crisis at the same moment, threw into prominence the same types of\r\nmen, moderate and extreme, and produced the same waste of good human\r\nmaterial and distortion of human character, both in the ascendant and\r\nthe subject classes. As Sir John Cockburn tells us in his \"Political\r\nAnnals of Canada\" (p. 177), some of the most incendiary speakers and\r\nwriters (in 1836) were \"most able and worthy men, who in the subsequent\r\ndays of tranquillity occupied most prominent and distinguished positions\r\nin the public service, revered as loyal, true, and able statesmen by all\r\nclasses.\" The popular movement was by no means wholly French. A Scot,\r\nJohn Neilson; an Englishman, Wilfred Nelson; and an Irish journalist,\r\nDr. O'Callaghan, were prominent members of a kind of Radical party; but\r\nthe ablest and most influential among the agitators, and in every\r\nrespect more admirable than Mackenzie, was the Frenchman, Louis\r\nPapineau, who first became Speaker of the Assembly in 1817, and retained\r\nthat high position until the verge of the rebellion of 1837. By no means\r\ndevoid of superficial faults, but eloquent, honest, accomplished and\r\nadored by his compatriots, here was a man who, if he had been given\r\nreasonable scope for his talents, and steadied by official\r\nresponsibility, would have been a tower of strength to the Colony and\r\nthe British connection. He corresponds in position and aims, and to a\r\ncertain extent in character and gifts, to his great Irish contemporary,\r\nO'Connell. But O'Connell was too conservative to produce great results.\r\nPapineau, dashing himself in vain for twenty years against the\r\nentrenched camp of the ascendancy, finally degenerated, like Mackenzie,\r\ninto a commonplace rebel.\r\n\r\nThe phases through which the agitation passed before it reached this\r\ndisastrous point need only a brief review. Naturally enough, owing to\r\nthe bi-racial conditions, friction had arisen earlier in Lower than in\r\nUpper Canada, yet the first recognition of the flagrant defects of the\r\nConstitution was not made till 1828, when a Committee of the British\r\nHouse of Commons published a Report which, though its recommendations\r\nwere mild and inadequate, was in effect a censure of the whole political\r\nsystem of the Province and an admission of the justice of the agitation.\r\nThere was no result for four years, while matters went from bad to worse\r\nin the Colony. At last, in 1832, under an Act similar to that passed for\r\nUpper Canada, all the provincial revenues were placed under the control\r\nof the Assembly in return for the voting of a fixed Civil List. This\r\nwell-meant half-measure made matters worse, because it left the Assembly\r\njust as powerless as before over the details of legislation and\r\nadministration, while giving it the power to paralyze the Government by\r\nrefusing all, instead of only part, of the supplies. This it proceeded\r\nto do, and in the next five years large deficits were piled up, and the\r\nColony became insolvent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in February, 1834, a year before the publication of the\r\n\"Seventh Report of Grievances\" in Upper Canada, and three months before\r\nO'Connell's celebrated motion in the House of Commons for the Repeal of\r\nthe Union between England and Ireland, the Assembly of Lower Canada, at\r\nPapineau's instance, passed the equally celebrated \"Ninety-two\r\nResolutions.\" Bombastic and diffuse, like parts of O'Connell's speech,\r\nthis historic document nevertheless was as true in all really essential\r\nrespects as Mackenzie's manifesto and as O'Connell's tremendous\r\nindictment of the system of Government in Ireland. All three men,\r\nO'Connell with far the most justification, demanded the same thing, good\r\ngovernment for their respective countries under a responsible Parliament\r\nand Ministry. They all occasionally used wild language, O'Connell the\r\nleast wild. O'Connell, who nine years later deliberately quenched a\r\npopular revolt he could have headed, failed in his aim as completely as\r\nTone, Emmett, and Smith O'Brien, who pressed their efforts to the point\r\nof violence. Mackenzie and Papineau, who took to arms, succeeded in\r\ntheir aim.\r\n\r\nThe crisis in Lower Canada was precipitated, and, indeed, provoked, by a\r\nchallenge thrown out in March, 1837, from the British House of Commons,\r\nwhere, at Lord John Russell's instance, the Ten Resolutions were agreed\r\nto, which amounted in effect to a denial of all the colonial claims and\r\na declaration of war upon those who made them. Papineau had to eat his\r\nwords or make them good, and he chose the latter course. His\r\ninsurrection was arranged in concert with that of the Upper Province,\r\nbroke out simultaneously in the winter of 1837, and was extinguished\r\nwith little difficulty. The men who made it suffered. Canada and the\r\nEmpire profited. Both Papineau and Mackenzie, following the precedent of\r\nWolfe Tone with France, endeavoured with little success to engage\r\nAmerican sympathy and the aid of her army, though Canada had as little\r\ndesire for American rule as Ireland had for French rule.\r\n\r\nLet us remark, as an interesting fact for those who imagine that\r\nIrishmen are always instinctively on the side of turbulence and\r\ndisorder, that the Irish immigrants who poured into Canada at the\r\naverage annual rate of 20,000 in the years--terrible years in\r\nIreland--preceding the rebellions,[23] acted much as we might expect. In\r\nthe Lower Province, following the lead of the French Catholic hierarchy,\r\nthey declared in November, 1837, against Papineau's party, and thus\r\nstrengthened the hands of the Government when the crisis approached.[24]\r\nIn the Upper Province Catholics were strongly on the side of reform, but\r\ntook no part in the rebellion. Orangemen in both Provinces, as we might\r\nguess, sided as strongly with the ascendancy parties, but colonial air\r\nseems to have taken some of the theological venom out of Orangeism. If\r\nCharles Buller is to be trusted, some Catholics joined the societies in\r\nUpper Canada, which were more Tory than religious, and the healths of\r\nWilliam of Orange and the Catholic Bishop Macdonnell were drunk in\r\nimpartial amity.[25]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, three of the four outlying Provinces of North\r\nAmerica--Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island--where the\r\nsame form of Constitution prevailed as in Upper and Lower Canada, had\r\nbeen passing through a similar phase of misgovernment and agitation\r\nduring the previous thirty years. Each suffered under a little\r\nmonopolist ascendancy, called by the same name, \"the family compact,\"\r\nand sustained, against the prevailing sentiment and interest, by the\r\nBritish Governor, and in each had arisen, or was arising, the same loud\r\ndemand for responsible government. Samuel Wilmot in New Brunswick,\r\nJoseph Howe in Nova Scotia, were the best-known spokesmen. There was no\r\nviolence, but a growing dislocation. In five Provinces of North America,\r\ntherefore, the Colonial Government had broken down or was tottering, and\r\nfrom exactly the same cause as in Ireland, though under provocation\r\ninfinitely less grave. For the moment, however, attention was\r\nconcentrated upon the Canadas, where, as a result of the rebellion, the\r\nConstitution of Lower Canada was suspended early in 1838. In the summer\r\nof 1838 Lord Durham, the Radical peer, was sent out by Melbourne's\r\nMinistry as Governor-General, with provisionally despotic powers, and\r\nwith instructions to advise upon a new form of government.\r\n\r\nBefore we come to Durham's proposals, let us pause and examine the state\r\nof home opinion on the Irish and Colonial questions. The people of Great\r\nBritain at large had no opinion at all. They were ignorant both of\r\nCanada and Ireland, and had been engaged, and, indeed, were still\r\nengaged, in a political struggle of their own which absorbed all their\r\nenergies. The Chartist movement in 1838 was assuming grave proportions.\r\nThe Reform, won in 1832 under the menace of revolution and in the midst\r\nof shocking disorders, was in reality a first step toward the domestic\r\nHome Rule that Ireland and the five Provinces of North America were\r\nclamouring for. Tory statesmen were quite alive to this political fact,\r\nand condemned all the political movements, British, Irish, and Colonial,\r\nindiscriminately and on the same broad anti-democratic grounds. The Duke\r\nof Wellington, who was not a friend of the Reform Act, and had only\r\nadopted Catholic Emancipation in order to avoid civil war in Ireland,\r\nspeaking about Canada in the House of Lords on January 18, 1838, coupled\r\ntogether the United States, British North America, and Ireland as\r\ndismal examples of the folly of concession to popular demands. Pointing\r\nto the results of the Canada Act of 1831, to which I have already\r\nalluded, and which gave the Assemblies control of the provincial\r\nrevenue, and with an eye, no doubt, on the tithe war barely at an end in\r\nIreland, he said: \"Let noble lords learn from Canada and our other\r\ndominions in North America what it is to hold forth what are called\r\npopular rights, but which are not popular rights here or elsewhere, and\r\nwhat occasion is given thereby to perpetuate a system of agitation which\r\nends in insurrection and rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whig statesmen who, if we except Peel's short Administration of\r\n1834-35, were in power from 1830 to 1841, though by no means democratic\r\nmen, were clear enough about Reform for Great Britain, but nearly as\r\nignorant and quite as wrong about Ireland and Canada as the Tories. The\r\nonly prominent Parliamentarian who, as after events proved, correctly\r\ndiagnosed and prescribed for the disease in both countries was\r\nO'Connell. Not fully alive to the Irish analogy, but correct from first\r\nto last about Canada, was a small group of independent Radicals, of whom\r\nRoebuck, Hume, Grote, Molesworth, and Leader were the principal\r\nrepresentatives. After the insurrections in Canada came John Stuart\r\nMill, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Charles Buller, and with them Lord Durham\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNo one can understand either Irish or Colonial history without reading\r\nthe debates of this period in the Lords and Commons on Canada and\r\nIreland. Alternating with one another with monotonous regularity, they\r\nnevertheless leave an impression of an extraordinary lack of\r\nearnestness, sympathy, and knowledge, and an extraordinary degree of\r\nprejudice and of bigotry in the Parliament to whose care for better or\r\nworse the welfare of nearly ten millions of British citizens outside\r\nGreat Britain was entrusted. Save for an occasional full-dress debate at\r\nsome peculiarly critical juncture, the debates were ill-attended. The\r\nprevailing sentiment seems to have been that Ireland and Canada,\r\nleavened by a few respectable \"loyalists\" and officials, on the whole,\r\nwere two exceedingly mutinous and embarrassing possessions, which,\r\nnevertheless, it was the duty of every self-respecting Briton to dragoon\r\ninto obedience. Both dependencies were assumed to be equally expensive,\r\nthough, in fact, Ireland, as we know now, was showing a handsome profit\r\nat the time, whereas Canada was costing a quarter of a million a year.\r\nFor the rest, the pride of power tempered a sort of fatalistic apathy.\r\nIn the case of Ireland the element of pure selfishness was stronger,\r\nbecause the immense vested interests, lay and clerical, in Irish land\r\nwere strongly represented. The proximity of Ireland, too, rendered\r\ncoercion more obvious and easy. Otherwise, her case was the same as that\r\nof Canada. \"The Canadas are endeavouring to escape from us, America has\r\nescaped us, but Ireland shall not escape us,\" said an English member to\r\nO'Connell just before the Repeal debate of 1834. Such was the current\r\nview.\r\n\r\nYet, as in the case of Ireland and of the lost American Colonies, the\r\nmaterials for knowledge of Canada were considerable. Petitions poured\r\nin; Committees and Commissions were appointed, and made reports which\r\nwere consigned to oblivion. Roebuck, one of the small Radical group, was\r\nhimself a Lower Canadian by birth, and acted as agent at Westminster for\r\nthe popular party in that Province. He was as impotent as O'Connell, the\r\nspokesman of the Irish popular party. If the Colonial Office was not\r\nquite the \"den of peculation and plunder\" which Hume called it in\r\n1838,[26] it was an obscure and irresponsible department, where jobbery\r\nwas as rife as in Dublin Castle. In the ten years of colonial crisis\r\n(1828-1838), there were eight different Colonial Secretaries and six\r\nIrish Chief Secretaries.\r\n\r\nOver and above all this apathy and arrogance was the perfectly genuine\r\nincapacity to comprehend that idea of responsible government which even\r\nthe most hot-headed and erratic of the colonial agitators did\r\ninstinctively comprehend. Until Durham had at last opened Lord John\r\nRussell's eyes, the great Whig statesman was as positive and explicit as\r\nthe Tories, Wellington and Stanley, in declaring that it was utterly\r\nimpossible for the Monarch's Representative overseas to govern otherwise\r\nthan by instructions from home and through Ministers appointed by\r\nhimself in the name of the King. One constitutional King ruled over\r\nGreat Britain, Canada, and Ireland. He could not be advised by two sets\r\nof Ministers. The thing was not only an unthinkably absurd nullification\r\nof the whole Imperial theory, but, in practice, would destroy and\r\ndissolve the Empire. William IV. himself told Lord Melbourne that it was\r\nhis \"fixed resolution never to permit any despatch to be sent ... that\r\ncan for a moment hold out the most distant idea of the King ever\r\npermitting the question even to be entertained by His Majesty's\r\nconfidential servants of a most remote bearing relative to any change of\r\nthe appointment of the King's Councils in the numerous Colonies.\" Lord\r\nStanley said, in 1837, that the \"double responsibility\" was impossible,\r\nthat there must either be separation or no responsible government, and\r\nthat it was \"no longer a question of expediency but of Empire.\" Lord\r\nJohn Russell, polished, sober, scorning to descend to the mere vulgar\r\nabuse of the colonials which disfigured the utterances of many of his\r\nopponents, struggling visibly to reconcile Liberalism with Empire,\r\nnevertheless arrived at the same conclusion. In a debate of March 6, for\r\nexample, in the same year, in proposing the defiant Resolutions which\r\nprovoked the rebellion in Canada, he argued at length that a responsible\r\nColonial Ministry was \"incompatible with the relations of a Mother\r\nCountry and a Colony,\" and would be \"subversive of the power of the\r\nBritish Crown,\" and again, on December 22, that it meant \"independence.\"\r\nO'Connell rightly replied to the former speech that Russell and his\r\nfollowers were supporting \"principles that had been the fruitful source\r\nof civil war, dissension, and distractions in Ireland for centuries.\"\r\nThe Radical group pushed home the Irish parallel. Hume quoted, as\r\napplicable to Canada, Fox's saying: \"I would have the whole Irish\r\nGovernment regulated by Irish notions and Irish prejudices, and I firmly\r\nbelieve ... that the more she is under Irish Government the more she\r\nwill be bound to English interests.\" Molesworth declared, what was\r\nperfectly true at that moment of passion and folly, that his extreme\r\npolitical opponents wanted to make the reconquest of Ireland a precedent\r\nfor the reconquest of Canada.\r\n\r\nIt would repay the reader to turn back from this debate to the Irish\r\nRepeal Debate of three years earlier, and listen to Sir Robert Peel\r\nstating as one of the \"truths which be too deep for argument,\" that the\r\nRepeal of the Union \"must lead to the dismemberment of this great\r\nEmpire, must make Great Britain a fourth-rate Power, and Ireland a\r\nsavage wilderness,\" which, as a matter of fact, it was at the very time\r\nhe was speaking, after thirty years of the Legislative Union, and seven\r\nhundred years of irresponsible government. We must listen to him\r\nclaiming that the beneficent and impartial British Government was\r\n\"saving Ireland from civil war\" between its own \"warring sects,\"\r\nwhereas, in fact, it was that Government which had brought those warring\r\nsects into being, which had fomented and exploited their dissensions,\r\nwhich had provoked the rebellion of 1798, and by its shameful neglect\r\nand partiality in the succeeding generation had flung Ireland into a\r\nsocial condition hardly distinguishable from \"civil war.\" And we must\r\nrealize that closely similar arguments, with special stress on the right\r\nof taxation, had been used for the coercion of the American Colonies,\r\nand that exactly the same arguments, founded on the same inversion of\r\ncause and effect, were used to defend the coercion of Canada. There,\r\nalso, the Fitzgibbonist doctrine of revenge and oppression by a majority\r\nvested with power was freely used, even by Lord John Russell, in his\r\nspeech of March 6, 1837, and of December 22 in the same year, when he\r\nspoke of the \"deadly animosity\" of the French and \"of the wickedness of\r\nabandoning the British to proscription, loss of property, and probably\r\nof lives.\" He ignored the fact that the same state of anarchy had been\r\nreached in uni-racial Upper Canada as in bi-racial Canada, and that the\r\n\"loyalists\" in both cases were not only in the same state of unreasoning\r\nalarm for their vested rights, but, in the spirit of the Ulstermen of\r\nthat day and ever since, were threatening to \"cut the painter,\" and\r\ndeclare for annexation to the United States if their ascendancy were not\r\nsustained by the Home Government. Then, as to-day, the ascendant\r\nminority were supported in their threats by a section of British\r\npoliticians. Lord Stanley's speech of March 8, 1837, where he boasted\r\nthat the \"loyal minority of wealth, education, and enterprise\" would\r\nprotect themselves, and, if necessary, call in the United States, is\r\nbeing matched in speeches of to-day. In all the debates of the period it\r\nis interesting to see the ignorance which prevailed about the troubles\r\nin Upper Canada. The racial question in Lower Canada, owing to the\r\nanalogy with Ireland, was seized on to the exclusion of the underlying\r\nand far more important political question in both Provinces.\r\n\r\nAgainst the policy of the two great political parties in England the\r\nlittle group of Radicals struggled manfully, and in the long run not in\r\nvain, although for years they had to submit to insult and contumely in\r\ntheir patriotic efforts to expose the vices of the colonial\r\nadministration and to avert the rebellion they foresaw in the Canadas.\r\nWhat they feared, with only too good cause, was that the American and\r\nIrish precedents would be followed, and war made for the coercion of the\r\nCanadas, to be followed, if successful, by a still more despotic form of\r\ngovernment, which would in its turn provoke a new revolt. Rather than\r\nthat such a catastrophe should take place, they went, rightly, to the\r\nextreme point of saying that an \"amicable separation\" should be\r\narranged, maintaining, what is indisputable, that the claims of humanity\r\nshould supersede the claims of possession. With Russell himself\r\ndeclaring till the eleventh hour that responsible government was out of\r\nthe question because it meant \"separation,\" they were quite justified in\r\ndemanding that separation, if indeed inevitable, should come about by\r\nagreement, not as the possible result of a fratricidal war. For such a\r\nwar, though Russell could not see it until Durham made him see it, was\r\nthe only alternative to the grant of responsible government. But the\r\nRadicals never used this argument unless circumstances forced them to.\r\nMolesworth, in a debate of March 6, 1838, denounced the prevailing view\r\nof the Colonies, insisted that we should be proud of them and study\r\ntheir interests, that reform, not separation, should be our aim. The\r\nRadicals were fully aware of the alternatives, and were unwearied in\r\npointing out the justice and policy, in the Imperial interests, of\r\nacceding to the colonial popular demands. Grote had expressed the truth\r\nin the December debate of 1837, when he implored the House \"not to use a\r\ntone of triumph at the superior power of England,\" but to remember that\r\nthe colonists, \"though freemen, like ourselves,\" desired to remain, \"if\r\nthey could do so with honour, in connection with England as the Mother\r\nCountry.\" He was followed by a gentleman named Inglis, who said that \"it\r\nwas in Canada as in Ireland,\" a faction called itself Canada, and that\r\nwe must bring \"back the colonists,\" like the Irish, \"to subordination.\"\r\n\r\nRoebuck, who led the Radicals in Canadian matters, had some of the\r\nfaults of Papineau and Mackenzie; yet posterity should give him and his\r\ncomrades credit for a constructive Imperialism which the great men of\r\nhis day lacked. It is now known that he and Sir William Molesworth\r\npowerfully influenced Durham's policy. In a paper he drew up at Durham's\r\nrequest on the eve of that nobleman's departure for Canada he sketched a\r\nplan, imperfect in some details, but wise in broad conception, for\r\npacifying the Canadas, and went further in elaborating a scheme, also\r\ndefective, for the Confederation of British North America under the\r\nCrown on the lines conceived by the despised demagogue, Mackenzie.[27]\r\nBut the two men who, by influencing Durham, probably did most to save\r\nCanada for the Empire and to lay the foundations of the present Imperial\r\nstructure, were Charles Buller, the Radical M.P., and Edward Gibbon\r\nWakefield, both of whom accompanied the new Governor-General to Canada,\r\nand who are generally believed to have inspired, if they did not\r\nactually write, the greater part of the celebrated Report which became\r\nthe Magna Charta of the self-governing Colonies of the Empire.\r\n\r\nA word about the events which ended in the publication of this Report.\r\nDurham reached Canada at the end of May, 1838, and in November was\r\nrecalled in disgrace for exceeding--strange as it seems!--the almost\r\nabsolute powers temporarily entrusted to him. He was an extraordinary\r\nmixture of a despot and a democrat, an extreme Radical in politics, an\r\nautocrat in manners, as vain and tactless as he was generous and\r\nsincere, making bitter enemies and warm friends in turn. He began by\r\nwinning and ended by estranging almost every class in both Provinces of\r\nCanada, and returned to England to all appearances a spent and\r\nextinguished meteor. There is some truth, perhaps, in Greville's\r\nobservation that, had he been \"plain John Lambton,\" he would never have\r\nbeen chosen for Canada. It is certain that those who sent him there\r\nlittle dreamed of the consequences of their action. Lord Melbourne, the\r\nPrime Minister, in a letter to the Queen, charged him with magnifying\r\nthe Canadian troubles \"in order to give greater _éclat_ to his own\r\ndeparture.\"[28] Still, he did his work of investigation faithfully, and\r\nformed his conclusions sanely, and there were plain men of greater\r\nability at his elbow in the persons of Wakefield and Buller, by whose\r\nadvice he was wise enough to be guided. All opinion was against him when\r\nnews came of his recall, and even Roebuck was denouncing him in the\r\n_Spectator_ for his autocratic excesses; but a brilliant article by John\r\nStuart Mill in the _Westminster Review_, pleading for time and\r\nconfidence, arrested the tide of obloquy.\r\n\r\nDurham's long Report, and the events which followed it, ought to be\r\nstudied carefully by every voter, however lowly, who has a voice in\r\ndeciding the fate of Irish Home Rule. After an exhaustive discussion of\r\nthe causes of disorder in Canada, Durham made two recommendations, the\r\nfirst of incalculable importance, and proved by subsequent experience to\r\nbe right; the second of minor consequence, and proved by subsequent\r\nexperience to be wrong.\r\n\r\nThe first was that responsible government should be inaugurated both in\r\nCanada and in the Maritime Provinces of North America, whose\r\nconstitutional troubles Durham also discussed. His proposal was that the\r\nGovernor should govern in accordance with advice given by Colonial\r\nMinisters in whom the popular Assembly reposed confidence, and who,\r\nthrough that Assembly, were in touch with popular opinion; for it was to\r\nthe strangulation of popular opinion that Durham attributed all the\r\ndisorders and disasters of the past. This recommendation was eventually\r\nadopted, not in the Act subsequently passed, but by instructions to the\r\nGovernors concerned; instructions which were first interpreted in the\r\nfull liberal spirit by Lord Elgin in 1847. The Maritime Provinces at\r\nvarious dates and under various Governors received full responsible\r\ngovernment by 1854. Responsible government proved the salvation of\r\nCanada and the Empire, as it would have proved, if given the chance, the\r\nsalvation of Ireland and a source of immensely enhanced strength to the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe second and less important recommendation, afterwards embodied in the\r\nAct of 1840, was the Union of the two Provinces of Upper and Lower\r\nCanada. Here Lord Durham, misled unhappily by the Irish precedent, fell\r\ninto an error. During his visit to Canada he came near to accepting\r\nthat higher conception of a Federal Union with local Home Rule for each\r\nProvince, outlined by Roebuck and Mackenzie, and eventually consummated\r\nthirty years later. When he came home to London he made a _volte face_,\r\nrejecting the Federal idea and accepting its antitype, that Legislative\r\nand Administrative Union of the two Provinces which had been rejected by\r\nPitt in 1791. There were, of course, economic arguments for Union apart\r\nfrom the racial factor; but they do not seem to have been decisive with\r\nDurham. At the last moment he gave way to a dread of predominant French\r\ninfluence in Lower Canada, similar at bottom to his dread of the\r\nunchecked influence of the British minority. While he feared that the\r\nlatter, if let alone, would inaugurate a reign of terror, he added also:\r\n\"Never again will the present generation of French-Canadians yield a\r\nloyal submission to a British Government.\" The argument is inconsistent\r\nwith the whole spirit of the Report, which attributes the friction in\r\nboth Provinces to bad political institutions. It is probable that Durham\r\nwas really more influenced by the quite reasonable recognition that the\r\nFrench were relatively backward in civilization and ideas. He sought,\r\ntherefore, both to disarm them politically and to anglicize them\r\nsocially, by amalgamating their political system with that of wholly\r\nBritish Upper Canada. His calculation was that in a joint assembly the\r\nBritish would have a small but sufficient majority. The estimated\r\npopulation of Lower Canada was 550,000, of whom 450,000 were French, and\r\n100,000 British and Irish; that of Upper Canada 400,000, all British and\r\nIrish. That is to say, that in both Provinces together there was a\r\nBritish and Irish majority of 100,000. The calculation over-estimated\r\nthe British element, but in the event this mistake proved to be\r\nimmaterial. Though Durham himself appears to have intended\r\nrepresentation to be in strict accordance with population, the Union\r\nAct, passed in 1840, allotted an equal number of representatives in the\r\nJoint Assembly to each of the old Provinces. The assumption here was\r\nthat the British Members from Upper Canada would unite with those of old\r\nLower Canada to vote down the French, just as the Ulster Protestants\r\nvoted with English members to vote down the Irish majority.\r\n\r\nIn practice the Union, after lasting twenty-six years, eventually broke\r\ndown. Durham's fear of French disloyalty proved to be as groundless as\r\nhis ideal of complete anglicization was futile. It was neither\r\nnecessary, sensible, nor possible to extinguish French sentiment, and\r\nhuman nature triumphed over this half-hearted effort to apply in\r\ndilution the medicine of Fitzgibbonism to the Colonies. Little harm was\r\ndone, because the introduction of responsible government, far\r\ntranscending the Union in importance, worked irresistibly for good.\r\nParties did not run wholly on racial lines, but racialism was encouraged\r\nby the equal representation of the two Provinces in the Assembly, in\r\nspite of the greater growth of population in the Upper Province. The\r\nsystem was unhealthy, and at last produced a state of deadlock, in which\r\ntwo exactly equal parties were balanced, and a stable Government\r\nimpossible. When that point was reached, men began to observe the strong\r\nand supple Constitution of the adjacent United States, and to recognize\r\nthat a politically feeble Canada was courting an absorption from that\r\nquarter which all Canadians disliked. The Legislative Union was\r\ndissolved by the mutual consent of the Provinces with the approval of\r\nthe Mother Country, and in 1867, under the British North America Act,\r\nthe Federal Union was formed which exists in such strength and stability\r\nto-day. Fear of French disloyalty or tyranny was a night-mare of the\r\npast, even with the British minority in Lower Canada. It was realized\r\nthat French national sentiment was perfectly consistent with racial\r\nharmony under the British flag. Upper Canada became Ontario, Lower\r\nCanada Quebec. Each Province reserved a local autonomy for itself, and\r\neach at the same moment voluntarily surrendered certain high powers to a\r\nsupreme centralized Government, in which both had confidence. Such a\r\npolitical system is capable of indefinite expansion. Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick joined the Federation at the outset, Prince Edward Island and\r\nBritish Columbia a little later, and were followed in turn by the\r\nsuccessively developed Provinces which now form the united and powerful\r\nDominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nTurn back to Ireland and weigh well the analogy. _Mutatis mutandis_,\r\nalmost every paragraph of the Durham Report applied with greater force\r\nto the Ireland of his day. The ascendancy of a caste and creed minority\r\nin Upper Canada; of a race minority in Lower Canada; \"the conflict of\r\nraces, not of principles\"; the consequent obliteration of natural\r\npolitical divisions, and the substitution of unnatural and vindictive\r\nantagonisms demoralizing both sides to every quarrel; the universal\r\ndisgust with and distrust of the British Government, though for reasons\r\ndiametrically opposite; the hopelessness of true reforms; the\r\nperpetuation of abuses; the stagnation of trade and agriculture; the\r\nre-emigration to America, and the abuses of a Church Establishment with\r\nendowments from sources by right public--all these phenomena and many\r\nothers had their counterpart in Ireland. Some have disappeared. The\r\nChurch is disestablished. The land question is on the way to settlement.\r\nThe old ascendancy is mitigated. But many of the political, and all the\r\npsychological, features of the situation which Durham described do,\r\nalas! exist to-day in Ireland. Ireland, like the Canada of 1838, is a\r\nland of bewildering paradox. There is a similarly unwholesome arrest of\r\nfree political life, the same unnatural division of parties, the same\r\nsuppression of moderate opinion, and the same inevitable maintenance of\r\na Home Rule agitation, harmful in itself, because it retards the country\r\nand accentuates for the time being the very divisions it seeks to cure,\r\nbut absolutely necessary for the final salvation of Ireland. Durham, in\r\nthe case of Canada, saw the truth, and swept into the limbo of\r\ndiscredited bogies the old figments of the coercionists. In a singularly\r\nnoble and profound passage (p. 229), revealing the ethical basis on\r\nwhich his philosophy rested, he declared that even if the political\r\nfreedom of the Colony were to lead in the distant future to her\r\nseparation from the Empire, she nevertheless had an indefeasible moral\r\nright to the blessings of freedom; but he prophesied correctly that the\r\nconnection with the Empire \"would only become more durable and\r\nadvantageous by having more of equality, of freedom, and of local\r\nadministration.\"\r\n\r\nIf only Irish and British Unionists would realize that these words came\r\nfrom a profound knowledge of human nature in the mass, and are\r\napplicable to Irishmen in Ireland just as much as to Irish, British,\r\nFrench, and Dutch in the Colonies!\r\n\r\nThe tenacity of the old superstition is extraordinary, and we can see it\r\nin the case of Canada. It remains a wonder to this day how responsible\r\ngovernment was ever introduced. There can be no question that the Act of\r\n1840 only secured a smooth passage because, in providing for the Union\r\nof the French and British Provinces, it represented a superficial\r\nanalogy to that Union of Britain and Ireland which had paralyzed Irish\r\naspirations. Durham himself had actually quoted both the Irish and\r\nScotch Unions as successful expedients for \"compelling the obedience of\r\na refractory population,\" and thus arrived at the outstanding and\r\nsolitary defect of his otherwise noble scheme. And O'Connell, in a\r\ndebate upon the Report on June 3, 1839, opposed the Canadian Union for\r\nIrish reasons, and in language which after-experience proved to be\r\nperfectly correct. Happily, as we have seen, the defect was small and\r\ncurable, because the analogy with Ireland, where there was no\r\nresponsible, but, on the contrary, a separate and wholly irresponsible\r\nExecutive Government, and whose interests were upheld by only 100\r\nMembers in a House of 670, was exceedingly remote. On responsible\r\ngovernment itself the Canadian Act of 1840 was entirely silent. We may\r\nthank Providence for the fact. Durham's cardinal proposals had received\r\nunbridled vituperation as sentimental rubbish where they were not\r\ntreasonable poison, the whole controversy taking precisely the same form\r\nas in 1886 and 1893 over Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule Bills for Ireland.\r\nThe _Quarterly Review_ spoke of \"this rank and infectious Report,\"\r\nthough it is fair to say that Peel and Wellington did not join in such\r\nwild language. Five months after the issue of Lord Durham's Report, Lord\r\nJohn Russell, in the debate of June 3, was denying, with the approval of\r\nall but the Radicals, the possibility of responsible government as\r\nemphatically as ever. Durham seems to have partially converted him in\r\nthe summer, for in introducing the Act itself in 1840 he cautiously\r\ncommitted himself to the plan of instructing the Canadian Governor to\r\ninclude in his Executive Council, or Cabinet, men expressly chosen\r\nbecause they possessed the confidence of the Assembly. But the Act as it\r\nstood, ignoring this vital change, was impeccably Conservative, and on\r\nthat account went through. In some points it seemed, without good\r\nreason, to be even reactionary, and was regarded in that light with\r\ndispleasure by the Radicals, with satisfaction by Whigs and Tories.\r\nWhile confirming the control of revenue by the Assembly, in return for a\r\nfixed civil list, it took away from the Assembly, and vested in the\r\nExecutive, the power of recommending money votes, and it also retained\r\nthe Legislative Council or Upper Chamber as a nominated, not as an\r\nelective, body. Provided that the Executive had the confidence of the\r\nrepresentative Assembly or Lower House, the first point was perfectly\r\nsound, and the second was not vital; but there was no security for the\r\ncondition precedent other than Russell's vague outline of subsequent\r\npolicy. While the supreme power of the King, acting with or without the\r\nGovernor, was reaffirmed in the most vigorous terms, there was not a\r\nword in the Act about the composition of the Executive Council or its\r\nrelation to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn Canada much the same misconceptions prevailed, and promoted the\r\nacceptance of the Act by the supporters of the old ascendancies. The\r\nquestion of the Union and the question of responsible government, both\r\nraised by Lord Durham's Report, became inextricably confused, and the\r\nvarious petitions and resolutions of the time reflect this confusion.\r\nThe French opposed the Union and supported responsible government on the\r\nsame grounds, and in almost identical terms, as the Irish opposed, and\r\nstill oppose, their Union with Great Britain, and ask for responsible\r\ngovernment in Ireland. Moderate Britishers supported both proposals, but\r\nthe extremists of the old ascendancy bitterly denounced the whole theory\r\nof responsible government, Union or no Union. Their views are ably and\r\nincisively set forth by a Committee of the old Legislative Council of\r\nUpper Canada, that is, by the members of the \"family compact,\" in a\r\nprotest signed and transmitted to London, where it was quoted with\r\napproval by Lord John Russell. It may be found, together with other\r\npetitions of the time, in the \"Canadian Constitutional Development\" of\r\nMessrs. Grant and Egerton. With a few unessential changes and\r\nmodifications, the whole document might be signed to-day by a Committee\r\nof Ulster Unionists, and I heartily wish that every Ulsterman would read\r\nit in a spirit of reason and generosity, and observe how every line of\r\nit was falsified by history, before he declares that the situation of\r\nUlster is peculiar, and sets his hand or gives his adhesion to a\r\nsimilar document. The signatories, who, it must be remembered, were a\r\nsmall ruling minority of the colonists, whose power was artificially\r\nsustained by the British Governor, claim that they alone, in glorifying\r\nand in battling for \"colonial dependence,\" are the true Imperialists.\r\nThey hold dear the \"unity of the Empire.\" Responsible government within\r\ntheir own Colony would lead to the \"overthrowal\" of that Empire, and the\r\nreduction of Britain to a \"second-rate Power.\" A colonial Cabinet is\r\nabsurd; the local and sectional interests are too strong; the British\r\nGovernment must remain as \"umpire\" to keep the parties from flying at\r\none another's throats. The majority, who are themselves a prey to\r\ndivisions (and one thinks of Nationalist splits), are seeking only for\r\nillegitimate power; the minority are for \"justice and protection, and\r\nimpartial government.\" Yet in the same breath we are told that all is\r\nhappy and peaceable as it is. Why subject the Colony to the dissensions\r\nof party? Why foster a spirit of undying enmity among a people disposed\r\nto dwell together in harmony? The signatories argue from the history of\r\nIreland and Scotland, \"which never had responsible government, yet\r\ngovernment became impracticable the moment it approached to equal\r\nrights.\" Hence a Union, because \"government must be conducted with a\r\nview to some supreme ruling power, which is not practicable with several\r\nindependent Legislatures.\" Finally, Loyalists and Imperialists as they\r\nare, they are not going to stand an attempt to \"force independence\" on\r\nthem. They will take the matter into their own hands, and, if necessary,\r\ncall in the United States to \"replace the British influence needlessly\r\noverthrown.\"\r\n\r\nI do not quote this sort of thing in order to add any tinge of\r\nbitterness to present controversies. The signatories lived to see their\r\nerrors and to be ashamed of what they wrote. They, like the Irish\r\nUnionist leaders of to-day, were able and sincere men, unconscious, we\r\nmay assume, that their pessimism about the tendencies of their\r\nfellow-citizens was really due to the defective institutions which they\r\nthemselves were upholding, and to the forcible suppression of the finer\r\nattributes of human nature; unconscious, we may also assume, of\r\nidentifying loyalty with privilege, and \"the supreme ruling power\" with\r\ntheir own ruling power; unconscious that what they called \"Imperial\r\nUnity\" was in reality on the verge of producing Imperial disruption; and\r\nwholly unconscious, certainly, of the ghastly irony of their analogy\r\ndrawn from the brutally misgoverned, job-ridden, tithe-ridden,\r\nrack-rented Ireland of their day, living, for no fault of its own, under\r\na condition of intermittent martial law, and hurrying at that moment\r\ntowards the agony of the famine years. Less severe in degree, analogous\r\nabuses perpetuated in their own interest existed in their own Colony,\r\nand were only abolished under the new régime which they attacked with\r\nsuch vehemence before it came, and which, because it transformed and\r\nelevated their own character and that of their fellow-citizens, while\r\ndrawing them closer to the old country, they afterwards learned to\r\nregard with pride and thankfulness.\r\n\r\nAs an effective contrast to the mistaken views of the Upper Canadian\r\nstatesmen, the reader cannot do better than study the letters of Joseph\r\nHowe, the brilliant Nova Scotia \"agitator,\" to Lord John Russell, in\r\nanswer to that statesman's speech of June 3, 1839, when he argued\r\nagainst responsible government, and quoted the Upper Canadian manifesto\r\nas his text. These letters make a wonderful piece of sustained and\r\nhumorous satire, of which every word was true and every word applicable\r\nto Ireland. Howe's portrait, for example, of the average Colonial\r\nGovernor applies line for line to the average Chief Secretary, coming at\r\nan hour's notice to a country he has never seen, and knows nothing of,\r\nvested with absolute powers of patronage, and often pledged to carry out\r\na policy in direct conflict with the wishes of the vast majority of the\r\npeople whose interests he is supposed to guard.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1840 went through, but it had little to do with the\r\nregeneration and reconciliation of Canada. Poulett Thompson, the first\r\nGovernor, peremptorily declined to admit the principle of Ministerial\r\nresponsibility. Some good reforms were, indeed, made in the early years,\r\nbut the Act was on the verge of breaking down when Lord Elgin, Durham's\r\nson-in-law, came to Canada as Governor-General in 1847. After many party\r\nchanges and combinations, French influence was temporarily in the\r\nascendant, and in 1849 a Bill was on the stocks for compensating French\r\nas well as British subjects for losses in the rebellion of 1837. Elgin,\r\nfollowing the advice of his Ministers, of whom Baldwin was one,\r\nLafontaine another, gave the Royal Assent to the Bill. The British, with\r\nthe old cry of \"loyalism,\" and with Orangemen in the van, rioted, mobbed\r\nthe Governor, and burnt down the Parliament House at Montreal. Elgin,\r\nexpostulating with Lord John Russell, who was as pessimistic as ever,\r\nand threatened with recall, stuck to his guns under fierce obloquy, and\r\nthe principle of responsible government was definitely established. It\r\nwas applied at about the same period to the other British Provinces of\r\nNorth America, with the ulterior results I have described, and in a few\r\nyears to Australia.\r\n\r\nThe great year, then, was 1847, the year of the Irish famine, and the\r\nyear before the pitiful rebellion of Smith O'Brien, surrendering in the\r\nhistoric cabbage-garden. Our thoughts go back sixty-four years to 1783,\r\nwhen the American War of Independence ended; when, as a result of that\r\nwar, British Canada and Australia were founded, and when, at the\r\ncrisis--premature, alas!--of Ireland's fortunes, the Volunteers in vain\r\ndemanded the Reform which might have saved their country. Look into\r\nhistorical details, read contemporary debates, and watch the contrast.\r\nWithin five years of responsible government Canada solved all the great\r\nquestions which had been convulsing society for so long, and turned her\r\nliberated energies towards economic development. In Ireland the abuses\r\nof ages lingered to a point which seems incredible. The Church was not\r\ndisestablished, amid outcries of imminent ruin and threats of a\r\nProtestant rebellion, till 1869, when Canada had already become a\r\nFederated Dominion. The Irish land question, dating from the seventeenth\r\ncentury, was not seriously tackled until 1881, not drastically and on\r\nthe right lines till 1903. Education languishes at the present day.\r\nCanada started an excellent system of municipal and local government in\r\nthe forties. In Ireland, while the minority, in Greville's words, were\r\n\"bellowing spoliation and revolution,\" an Act was passed in 1840 with\r\nthe utmost difficulty, removing an infinitesimal part of the gross\r\nabuses of municipal government under the ascendancy system, and it was\r\nnot till 1898 that the people at large are admitted to a full share in\r\ncounty and town government. Even this step inverted the natural order of\r\nthings, for the new authorities are hampered in their work by the\r\nincessant political agitation for the Home Rule which should have\r\npreceded their establishment, as it preceded it in Great Britain and\r\nCanada. Home Rule, the tried specific, was resisted, as those who read\r\nthe debates of 1886 and 1893 will recognize, on the same grounds as\r\nCanadian Home Rule, in the same spirit, and often in terms absolutely\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nWas it because Ireland, unlike Canada, was \"so near\"? Let us reflect.\r\nDid Durham advocate Canadian Home Rule because Canada was \"so far\"? On\r\nthe contrary, it was a superficial inference, drawn not merely from\r\nIreland, but from Scotland, and since proved to be false both in Canada\r\nand South Africa, that made him shrink from the full application of a\r\nphilosophy which was already far in advance of the political thought and\r\nmorality of his day. Is it to be conceived that if he had lived to see\r\nthe Canadian Federation, the domestic and Imperial results of South\r\nAfrican Home Rule, and the consequences of seventy more years of\r\ncoercive government in Ireland, he would still have regarded the United\r\nKingdom in the light of a successful expedient for \"compelling the\r\nobedience of refractory populations\"? In truth, Durham, like ninety-nine\r\nout of a hundred Englishmen of his day, knew nothing of Ireland, not\r\neven that her political system differed, as it still differs, _toto\r\ncoelo_ from that of Scotland, and came into being under circumstances\r\nwhich had not the smallest analogy in Scotland. So far as his knowledge\r\nwent, he was a student of human nature as affected by political\r\ninstitutions. Wakefield, who advised him, was a doctrinaire theorist who\r\nput his preconceived principles into highly successful practice both in\r\nAustralia and Canada. They said: \"Your coercive system degrades and\r\nestranges your own fellow-citizens. Change it, and you will make them\r\nfriendly, manly, and prosperous.\" They were right, and one reflects once\r\nmore on the terrible significance of Mr. Chamberlain's admission in\r\n1893, that \"if Ireland had been a thousand miles away, she would have\r\nwhat Canada had had for fifty years.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] \"The Irishman in Canada\" (N.F.

Yet policy is scarcely the\r\nright word. The Colonists themselves wrenched the right to\r\nself-government from a reluctant Mother Country, and the Mother Country\r\nherself was hardly conscious of the loss of her prerogatives until it\r\nwas too late to regret or recall them. The men who on principle believed\r\nin and laboured for Home Rule for Canada were a mere unconsidered\r\nhandful in the country, while most of those who voted for the Act of\r\n1840 thought that it killed Home Rule. No general election was held to\r\nobtain the \"verdict of the predominant partner\" on the real question at\r\nissue, with the cry of \"American dollars\" (which had, in fact, been\r\npaid); with lurid portraits of Papineau and Mackenzie levying black-mail\r\non the Prime Minister, and quotations from their old speeches to show\r\nthat they were traitors to the Empire; with jeremiads about the terrors\r\nof Rome, the abandonment of the loyal minority, and the dismemberment of\r\nthe Empire, to shake the nerves and stimulate the slothful conscience of\r\nan ignorant electorate. Had there been any such opportunity we know it\r\nwould have been used, and we can guess what the result would have been;\r\nfor nothing is easier, alas! than to spur on a democracy with such cries\r\nas these to the exercise of the one function it should refrain\r\nfrom--interference with another democracy, be it in Ireland or anywhere\r\nelse. As it was, a merciful veil fell over Canada; Lord Elgin's action\r\nin 1849 passed with little notice, and a mood of weary indifference to\r\ncolonial affairs, for which, in default of any Imperial idealism, we\r\ncannot be too thankful, took possession of Parliament and the nation.\r\n\r\nIt was in this mood that the measures conferring self-government on the\r\nAustralasian Colonies, 12,000 miles away from the Mother Country, and\r\nexciting proportionately less concern than Canada, were passed a few\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nFrom the landing of the first batch of convicts at Botany Bay in 1788,\r\nNew South Wales, the Mother Colony, was a penal settlement pure and\r\nsimple, under military Government, for some thirty years. The island\r\nColony, Tasmania, founded under the name of Van Diemen's Land in 1803,\r\nwas used for the same purpose. Victoria, originally Port Phillip, just\r\nescaped a like fate in 1803, and remained uncolonized till 1835, when\r\nthe free settlers set their faces against the penal system, and in 1845,\r\nacting like the Bostonians of 1774 with the famous cargo of tea, refused\r\nto allow a cargo of convicts to land. South Australia, first settled in\r\n1829, also escaped; so did New Zealand, which was annexed to the Crown\r\nin 1839. Western Australia, dating from 1826, proceeded on the opposite\r\nprinciple to that of Victoria. Free from convicts until 1849, when\r\ntransportation to other Colonies was checked at their own repeated\r\nrequest, and came to an end in 1852, this Colony, owing to a chronic\r\nshortage of labour, actually petitioned the Home Government to divert\r\nthe stream of criminals to its shores, with the result that in ten\r\nyears' time nearly half the male adults in the Colony, and more than\r\nhalf in the towns, were, or had been, convicts. It was not until 1865,\r\nunder strong pressure from the other Colonies, that the system was\r\nfinally abolished which threw Western Australia forty years behind its\r\nsister Colonies in the attainment of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nThe transportation policy has been unmercifully criticized, and with all\r\nthe more justice in that Pitt, when the American war closed the\r\ntraditional dumping-ground for criminals, had the chance of employing\r\nthe exiled loyalists of America, many of whom were starving in London,\r\nas pioneers of the new lands in the Antipodes. \"The outcasts of an old\r\nsociety cannot form the foundations of a new one,\" said a Parliamentary\r\nReport of July 28, 1785. But they could do so, and did do so. Ruskin's\r\nsaying, _à propos_ of Australia, that \"under fit conditions the human\r\nrace does not degenerate, but wins its way to higher levels,\" comes\r\nnearer the truth. In an amazingly short time after the transportation\r\npolicy was reversed the taint disappeared. We must remember, however,\r\nthat, sheer refuse as some of the convicts were, especially in the later\r\nperiod, a large number of the earlier convicts were the product of that\r\n\"stupid severity of our laws\" which the Vicar of Wakefield deplored, and\r\nto this category belonged many an unhappy Irish peasant, sound in\r\ncharacter, but driven into Whiteboyism, or into the rebellions of 1798\r\nand 1803 by some of the worst laws the human brain ever conceived.\r\nHundreds of these men survived the barbarous and brutalizing ordeal of a\r\npenal imprisonment to become prosperous and industrious citizens.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1825, or thereabouts, that free white settlers, many\r\nIrishmen among them, came in any substantial number to the Mother Colony\r\nof New South Wales, and not until 1832 that these men began to press\r\nclaims for the management of their own affairs, under the inspiration of\r\nan Irish surgeon's son, William Wentworth, the Hampden of Australia. The\r\nlater Colonies rapidly came into line, Western Australia, for the reason\r\ngiven above, remaining stationary. The first representative institutions\r\nwere granted in 1842 to New South Wales, and in 1850 to Victoria, South\r\nAustralia, and Tasmania. At that date, therefore, these settlements\r\nstood in much the same constitutional position as the Canadas had stood\r\nin 1791 (although technically their Constitutions were of a different\r\nkind), but with this important difference, that the Act of 1850, \"for\r\nthe better Government of Her Majesty's Australian Colonies,\" gave power\r\nto those Colonies to frame new Constitutions for themselves. This they\r\nsoon proceeded to do, each constructing its own, but all keeping in view\r\nthe same model, the British Constitution itself, and aiming at the same\r\nideal, responsible Government by a Colonial Cabinet under a Government\r\nrepresenting the Crown. Since responsible Government in Great Britain\r\nitself was not a matter of legal enactment, but the product of slowly\r\nevolved conventions and precedents, to which political scientists had\r\nnot yet given a scientific form, it is no wonder that the colonial\r\nConstitution-makers found great difficulty in expressing exactly what\r\nthey wanted in legal terms, and, indeed, none of them came near\r\nsucceeding; but time, their own political instinct, a succession of\r\nsensible Governors, and the forbearance of the Home Government solved\r\nthe problem, and evolved home-ruled States legally subordinate to the\r\nCrown, but with a Constitution closely resembling our own. The\r\nConstitutions became law by Acts of the Imperial Parliament passed by a\r\nLiberal Ministry in 1855. They are of unusual interest because they\r\nrepresent the first rude attempt to put into legal language a small part\r\nof the theory of the British Constitution as applied to dependencies of\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\nIn the most vital point of all, the relation of the dependency to the\r\nHome Government (as distinguished from questions of internal political\r\nstructure), they are almost as reserved as the Canadian Act of 1840,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, did not recognize by a word the duty of the\r\nGovernor to govern through a Colonial Cabinet. In certain clauses they\r\nhint, by distant implication, at the existence of such a Cabinet,\r\nresponsible to the colonial popular Legislature--the Canadian Act did\r\nnot assume even that--but they do not anywhere imply that the Governor\r\nis bound normally to place himself in the hands of that Cabinet, while\r\nthey expressly and rightly reaffirm the supreme power of the Crown,\r\nwhether acting through the Governor or not, over colonial legislation.\r\n\r\nHow far this reticence about responsible Government facilitated the\r\npassage of the Australian Acts in the British Parliament, as it\r\ncertainly facilitated the Canadian Act of 1840, it is difficult to\r\ndecide. It was probably a factor of some importance. At any rate, it is\r\ntrue to say that Home Rule, as in Canada, was mainly a result of\r\npractice rather than of statutory enactment. The case of New Zealand is\r\na striking example of this. In 1852 New Zealand obtained from a Tory\r\nGovernment a Constitutional Act, which resembles the Canadian Act of\r\n1840 in abstaining from any expression, direct or indirect which implies\r\nthe existence of a Colonial Cabinet, and it is probable that the framers\r\nof the Act intended no such development, but on the contrary\r\ncontemplated a permanent, irremovable Executive. But the Act was no\r\nsooner passed than an agitation began for responsible government, under\r\nthe leadership of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, part-author of the Durham\r\nReport, and at that time a member of the New Zealand Assembly. By 1855,\r\nwhen the Australian Acts were passed, New Zealand, without further\r\nlegislation, had obtained what she wanted.\r\n\r\nTo complete the story, Queensland, carved out of New South Wales in\r\n1859, entered upon full responsible government at once, and Western\r\nAustralia, retarded for so long by the servile system of convict-labour,\r\ngained the same rights in 1890.\r\n\r\nReading the debates of the middle of the nineteenth century, one is left\r\nwith the impression that the Australasian Colonies obtained Home Rule by\r\nvirtue of their distance, and because most politicians at home could not\r\nbe bothered to fight hard against a principle which at bottom they\r\ndisliked as heartily for the Colonies as for Ireland. The views of the\r\nvarious parties were not much changed since the days of the crisis in\r\nCanada. There were some able Colonial Secretaries who thoroughly\r\nunderstood and believed in the principle of responsible government. On\r\nthe other hand, some Liberals were not yet converted, though Liberal\r\nGovernments fathered the Constitutional Acts of 1850 and 1855.\r\nDisraeli's well-known saying in 1852 that \"these wretched Colonies will\r\nall be independent, too, in a few years, and are a mill-stone round our\r\nnecks,\" was typical of the Tory attitude.[29] Lord John Russell, in the\r\nsame year, 1852, was complaining, as Lord Morley tells us,[30] that we\r\nwere \"throwing the shields of our authority away,\" and leaving \"the\r\nmonarchy exposed in the Colonies to the assaults of democracy.\" A group\r\nof Radicals, headed by Sir William Molesworth and Hume in Parliament,\r\nand by Wakefield from outside, still pushed the policy of emancipation\r\nenergetically and persistently on the principle which they had urged in\r\nthe case of Canada, that freedom was better both for the Colonies and\r\nthe Mother Country.\r\n\r\nBut Molesworth and Wakefield gained one illustrious convert and\r\ncoadjutor in the person of Mr. Gladstone, whose speeches on the Colonies\r\nat this period, 1849 to 1855, placed him, in regard to that topic, in\r\nthe Radical ranks, and in veiled opposition to the Whig leaders. Lord\r\nMorley quotes a minute from his hand, written in 1852 in answer to the\r\nview of Lord John Russell, referred to above, where he says \"that the\r\nnominated Council and independent Executive were not 'shields of\r\nauthority,' but sources of weakness, disorder, disunion, and\r\ndisloyalty.\" His Parliamentary and platform speeches, passing with\r\nlittle notice at the time, nevertheless remain the most eloquent and\r\nexalted expression of wise colonial policy that is to be found in our\r\nlanguage. If it was not till a generation later that he applied the same\r\narguments to the case of Ireland, the arguments nevertheless did apply\r\nto Ireland almost word for word. Proximity to the Mother Country does\r\nnot affect them. Mr. Gladstone attacks the problem on its human side,\r\nshowing that coercive government is always and everywhere bad for those\r\nwho administer it, and bad for those who live under it, expensive,\r\ninefficient, demoralizing, and that the longer it is maintained the more\r\ndifficult it is to remove. He condemns the fallacy of preparing men by\r\nslow degrees for freedom, and the \"miserable jargon about fitting them\r\nfor the privileges thus conferred, while in point of fact every year and\r\nevery month during which they are retained under the administration of a\r\ndespotic Government renders them less fit for free institutions.\" As to\r\ncost, \"no consideration of money ought to induce Parliament to sever the\r\nconnection between any one of the Colonies and the Mother Country,\" but\r\nthe greater part of the cost, he urged, was due to the despotic system\r\nitself. His words are more applicable to the Ireland of to-day than the\r\nIreland of the middle of the nineteenth century, for it is one of the\r\nmany painful anomalies of Irish history that that country, at the lowest\r\npoint of its economic misery, was paying a relatively enormous\r\ncontribution to Imperial funds, and, incidentally, to the colonial vote,\r\nwhile the Colonies were maintained at a loss correspondingly large, and\r\nat times even larger.[31] But cost is, after all, a very small matter.\r\nThe first consideration is the character and happiness of human beings,\r\nand here Gladstone's words, like Durham's, have a universal application.\r\nIf the reader cannot study them at length in Hansard, he should read\r\nthe great speech on the New Zealand Bill in 1852, and Lord Morley's\r\nmasterly summary of others. I conclude with a passage quoted by him from\r\na platform speech at Chester in 1855, the year when the Australian\r\nConstitutions were sanctioned. \"Experience has proved that if you want\r\nto strengthen the connection between the Colonies and this country, if\r\nyou want to see British law held in respect, and British institutions\r\nadopted and beloved in the Colonies, never associate with them the hated\r\nname of force and coercion exercised by us at a distance over their\r\nrising fortunes. Govern them upon a principle of freedom.\" At that\r\nmoment, after half a century of coercion and neglect under what was\r\ncalled the \"Union,\" Ireland was bleeding, as it seemed, to death.\r\nScarcely recovered from the stunning blow of the famine, she was\r\nundergoing in a fresh dose of clearances and evictions the result of\r\nthat masterpiece of legislative unwisdom, the Encumbered Estates Act.\r\nHer people were leaving her by hundreds of thousands, cursing the name\r\nof England as bitterly as the evicted Ulster farmers and the ruined\r\nweavers of the eighteenth century had cursed it, and bearing their\r\nwrongs and hatred to the same friendly shore, America. For the main\r\nstream of emigration, which before the Union had set towards the\r\nAmerican States, and from the Union until the famine towards Canada,\r\nreverted after the famine towards the United States, impregnating that\r\nnation with an hostility to Great Britain which in subsequent years\r\nbecame a grave international danger, and which, though greatly\r\ndiminished, still remains an obstacle to the closer union of the\r\nEnglish-speaking races. On the other hand, it is interesting to observe\r\nthat among the Irish emigrants to countries within the Empire, and a\r\nvery important part of this emigration was to Australasia, the\r\nanti-British sentiment was far less tenacious, though the affection for\r\ntheir own native country was no less passionate.\r\n\r\nWhatever we may conclude about the motives behind the concession of Home\r\nRule to Australia and New Zealand, we may regard it as fortunate that\r\nthey lay too far away for any close criticism from statesmen at home,\r\nwhether before or after the attainment of self-government. Most of these\r\nstatesmen would have been scandalized by the manner in which these\r\nvigorous young democracies, destitute of the patrician element, shaped\r\ntheir own political destiny by the light of nature and in the teeth of\r\ngreat difficulties. Almost to a man their leaders in this great work\r\nwould have been regarded as \"turbulent demagogues and dangerous\r\nagitators,\" and often were so regarded, when the rumour of their\r\nactivities penetrated to far-off London. The old catchwords of\r\nrevolution, spoliation and treason, consecrated to the case of Ireland,\r\nwould have been applied here with equal vehemence, and were in fact\r\napplied by the official classes in the Colonies themselves, round whom\r\nsmall anti-democratic groups, calling themselves \"loyal,\" crystallized,\r\nas in the Provinces of Upper Canada and in Ireland, and with whom the\r\nruling classes at home were in instinctive sympathy. There were stormy,\r\nagitated times, there were illegal movements against the reception of\r\nconvicts, struggles over land questions, religious questions, financial\r\nquestions, the emancipation of ex-convicts, and the many difficult\r\nproblems raised by the discovery of gold and the mushroom growth of\r\ndigger communities in remote places. There was in the air more genuine\r\nlawlessness--irrespective, I mean, of revolt against bad laws--than ever\r\nexisted in Ireland, though there was never at any time any practical\r\ngrievance approaching in magnitude to the practical grievances of\r\nIreland at the same period. But, could the spirit of English\r\nstatesmanship towards analogous problems in Ireland have been maintained\r\nin Australasia, systematically translated into law and enforced with the\r\nhelp of coercion acts by soldiers and police, communities would have\r\nbeen artificially produced presenting all the lawless and retrograde\r\nfeatures of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe famous affair of the Eureka Stockade in 1854 is an interesting\r\nillustration. A great mass of diggers collected in the newly discovered\r\nBallarat goldfields had petitioned repeatedly against the Government\r\nregulations about mining licences, for which extortionate fees were\r\nlevied. This was before responsible government. The goldfields were not\r\nrepresented in the Legislature, and there was no constitutional method\r\nof redress. The authorities held obstinately to their obsolete and\r\nirritating regulations, and eventually the miners revolted under the\r\nleadership of an Irishman, Peter Lalor, and with the watchword \"Vinegar\r\nHill.\" There was a pitched battle with the military forces of the\r\nCrown, ending after much bloodshed in the victory of the soldiers. Lalor\r\nwas wounded, and carried into hiding by his friends. Other captured\r\nrioters were tried for \"high treason\" before juries of townsmen picked\r\nby the Crown on the lines long familiar in Ireland; but even these\r\njuries refused to convict, as they so often refused to convict in cases\r\nof agrarian crime in Ireland. The State trials were then abandoned, a\r\nRoyal Commission reported against the licence system, and Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation was given to the goldfields. It came to be universally\r\nacknowledged that the talk of \"treason\" was nonsense, that the outbreak\r\nhad been provoked by laws which could not be constitutionally changed,\r\nand that the moral was to change them, not to expatriate and persecute\r\nthose who had suffered under them. Lalor reappeared, entered political\r\nlife, became Speaker of the reformed Assembly of 1856, and lived and\r\ndied respected by everyone. He now appears as a prominent figure in a\r\nlittle book entitled \"Australian Heroes,\" and it is admitted that the\r\nwhole episode powerfully assisted the movement for responsible\r\ngovernment in the Colony. Smith O'Brien, Meagher, Mitchell, and others\r\nconcerned in the Irish rebellion of 1848 were at that moment languishing\r\nin the penal settlement of Tasmania for sedition provoked by laws fifty\r\ntimes worse; laws, too, that a Royal Commission three years earlier had\r\nshown to be inconsistent with social peace, and which others\r\nsubsequently condemned in still stronger terms. From their first\r\nestablishment far back in the seventeenth century it took two centuries\r\nto abolish these laws. In the Australian case it took one year.\r\n\r\nAs for the Irishmen of all creeds and classes who took such an important\r\npart in the splendid work of building up these new communities, and who\r\nare still estimated to constitute a quarter of the population, one can\r\nonly marvel at the intensity of the prejudice which declared these men\r\n\"unfit\" for self-government at home, and which is not yet dissipated by\r\nthe discovery that they were welcomed under the Southern Cross, not only\r\nas good workaday citizens in town, bush, or diggings, but as barristers,\r\njudges, bankers, stock-owners, mine-owners, as honoured leaders in\r\nmunicipal and political life, as Speakers of the Representative\r\nAssemblies, and as Ministers and Prime Ministers of the Crown.[32] is\r\ntrue, and the fact cannot surprise us, that the intestinal divisions of\r\nrace and creed in Ireland itself, stereotyped there by ages of bad\r\ngovernment, were at first to a certain extent reproduced in Australia,\r\nas in Canada. Aggressive Orangeism was to be found sowing discord where\r\nno cause for discord existed. But the common sense of the community and\r\nthe pure air of freedom tended to sterilize, though they have not to\r\nthis day wholly killed, these germs of disease. A career was opened to\r\nevery deserving Irishman, whether Catholic or Protestant. Hungry,\r\nhopeless, listless cottiers from Munster and Connaught built up\r\nnourishing towns like Geelong and Kilmore. Two Irishmen, Dunne and\r\nConnor, were the first discoverers of the Ballarat goldfields. An\r\nIrishman, Robert O'Hara Burke, led the first transcontinental\r\nexpedition, and another Irishman, Ambrose Kyte, financed it; Wentworth\r\nwas the father of Australian liberties. An Irish Roman Catholic, Sir\r\nRedmond Barry, founded the Public Library, Museum, and University of\r\nMelbourne. In the political annals of Victoria and New South Wales the\r\nnames of Irish Catholics, men to whom no worthy political career was\r\nopen in their own country, were prominent. Sir John O'Shanassy, for\r\nexample, was three times Prime Minister of Victoria, Sir Brian\r\nO'Loughlen once. Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, a member of O'Shanassy's\r\nCabinets, and at last Prime Minister himself, is the colonial statesman\r\nwhose career and personality are the best proof of what Ireland has lost\r\nin high-minded, tolerant, constructive statesmanship, through a system\r\nwhich silenced or drove from her shores the men who loved her most, who\r\nsaw her faults and needs with the clearest eyes, and who sought to unite\r\nher people on a footing of self-reliance and mutual confidence. One of\r\nthe ablest of O'Connell's young adjutants, editor and founder of the\r\n_Nation_, part-organizer of the Young Ireland Movement which united men\r\nof opposite creeds in one of the finest national movements ever\r\norganized in any country, Duffy's central aim had been to give Ireland a\r\nnative Parliament, where Irishmen could solve their own problems for\r\nthemselves. He saw the rebellion of 1848 fail, and Mitchell, Smith\r\nO'Brien, Meagher, McManus, and O'Donoghue transported to Tasmania; he\r\nlaboured on himself in Ireland for seven years at land reform and other\r\nobjects, and in 1855 gave up the struggle against such hopeless odds,\r\nand reached Melbourne early in 1856 in time to sit in the first\r\nVictorian Parliament returned under the constitutional Act of 1855. From\r\nthe beginning to the end of an honourable political career which lasted\r\nthirty years, he made it his dominant purpose to ensure that Australia\r\nshould be saved from the evils which cursed Ireland; from government by\r\na favoured class, from land monopoly, and from religious inequality and\r\nthe venomous bigotries it engenders, and he took a large share in\r\nbringing about their exclusion. His Land Act of 1862, for example, where\r\nhe had another Roman Catholic Irishman, Judge Casey, as an auxiliary,\r\nput an end in those districts where it was fairly worked to the grave\r\nabuses caused by the speculative acquisition of immense tracts of land\r\nby absentee owners, and promoted the closer settlement of the country by\r\nyeoman farmers.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, as in Canada, we see the vital importance of good land\r\nlaws, and can measure the misery which resulted in Ireland from an\r\nagrarian system incalculably more absurd and unjust than anything known\r\nin any other part of the Empire. The stagnation of Western Australia was\r\noriginally due to the cession of huge unworkable estates to a handful of\r\nmen. South Australia was retarded for some little time from the same\r\ncause, and Victoria and New South Wales were all hampered in the same\r\nway. It was not a question, as in Ireland, and to a less degree in\r\nPrince Edward Island, of the legal relations between the landlord and\r\ntenant of lands originally confiscated, but of the grant and sale of\r\nCrown lands. Yet the after-results, especially in the check to tillage\r\nand the creation of vast pasture ranches, were often very similar.[33]\r\n\r\nDuffy was not the only colonial statesman to apply Irish experience to\r\nthe problems of newly settled countries. An Englishman who became one of\r\nthe greatest of colonial statesmen and administrators, the Radical\r\nImperialist, Sir George Grey, began life as a Lieutenant on military\r\nservice in Ireland in the year 1829, and came away sick with the scenes\r\nhe had witnessed at the evictions and forced collections of tithes\r\nwhere his troops were employed to strengthen the arm of the law.\r\n\"Ireland,\" his biographer, Professor Henderson, tells us,[34] \"was to\r\nhim a tragedy of unrealized possibilities.\" The people had \"good\r\ncapacities for self-government,\" but Englishmen \"showed a vicious\r\ntendency to confuse cause and effect,\" and attributed to inherent\r\nlawlessness what was a revolt against bad economic conditions. \"All that\r\nthey or their children could hope for was to obtain, after the keenest\r\ncompetition, the temporary use of a spot of land on which to exercise\r\ntheir industry\"; \"for the tenant's very improvements went to swell the\r\naccumulations of the heirs of an absentee, not of his own.\" \"Haunted by\r\nthe Irish problem,\" Grey made it his effort first in South Australia,\r\nand afterwards in New Zealand, where he was both Governor and Premier at\r\nvarious times, to secure the utmost possible measure of Home Rule for\r\nthe colonists, and, in pursuance of a policy already inaugurated by\r\nEdward Gibbon Wakefield, to establish a land system based, not on\r\nextravagant free grants, or on private tenure, but on sales by the State\r\nto occupiers at fair prices. The aim was to counteract that excessive\r\naccumulation of people in the large cities which, thanks to imperfect\r\nlegislation, still exists in most of the Australian States. Subsequent\r\nNew Zealand land policy has been generally in the right direction, and\r\nis acknowledged to be highly successful. In the Australian mainland\r\nStates the absentee and the squatter caused constant difficulties and\r\noccasional disorder. The Commonwealth at the present day is suffering\r\nfor past neglect, and has found itself within the last year compelled to\r\nimitate New Zealand in placing taxes on undeveloped land, with a higher\r\npercentage against absentees.\r\n\r\nLet us add that Grey, like Duffy and most of the strongest advocates of\r\nHome Rule for the Colonies, was a Federalist long before Federation\r\nbecame practical politics, seeing in that policy the best means of\r\nachieving the threefold aim of giving each Colony in a group ample local\r\nfreedom, of binding the whole group together into a compact, coherent\r\nState, and of strengthening the connection between that State and the\r\nMother Country. As Governor at the Cape from 1854 to 1861 he vainly\r\nurged the Home Government to promote a Federal Union of the various\r\nSouth African States, Dutch and British, in order, as he said, to create\r\n\"an United South Africa under the British flag,\" a scheme which, it is\r\ngenerally agreed, could then have been carried out, and which would have\r\nsaved South Africa from terrible disasters. And he wished to apply the\r\nsame Federal principle to the Australian Colonies, and to the case of\r\nIreland and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nHe realized earlier than most men that the talk of \"separation\" and\r\n\"disloyalty\" was, in his own words already quoted, the result of a\r\n\"vicious tendency to confuse cause and effect,\" and that to govern men\r\nby their own consent, to let them work out their own ideals in their own\r\nway, to encourage, not to repress, their sense of nationality, is the\r\nbest way to gain their affection, or, if we choose to use that very\r\nmisleading word, their loyalty.\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand present remarkable examples of this beneficent\r\nprocess, Australia in particular, because there, for a long time even\r\nafter the introduction of responsible government and, indeed, until a\r\ndozen years ago, there was a large party of so-called \"disloyalists\" who\r\nwere never weary of decrying British influences and upholding Australian\r\nnationality. Mr. Jebb, in his \"Colonial Nationalism,\" gives an\r\ninteresting account of this movement and of its organ, the widely\r\ncirculated _Sydney Bulletin_, with its furiously anti-British views, its\r\nRadicalism, its Republicanism, and what not. He shows amusingly how\r\nentirely harmless the propaganda really was, and what a healthy effect\r\nit actually had in promoting an independence of feeling and national\r\nself-respect among Australians, to such a degree that when the South\r\nAfrican War broke out, there was a universal outburst of patriotism and\r\na universal desire, which was realized, to share to the full as a nation\r\nin the expense, danger, and hardships of the war. Mr. Jebb adds the\r\ninteresting suggestion that the reluctance of New Zealand to enter the\r\nAustralian Federation may be partly due to the strong individual\r\nsentiment of nationality evoked within her by the war and the\r\nexceptional exertions she made to aid the Imperial troops.\r\n\r\nHis book is a psychological study of men in the mass. What he sets out\r\nto prove, and what he does successfully prove, is that the encouragement\r\nof minor nationalities is not merely consistent with, but essential to,\r\nthe unity of the Empire. Yet he never mentions Ireland, not even for the\r\npurpose of proving her an exception to the rule, and I do not think I\r\never gauged the full extent of the prejudice against that country until\r\nI realized that in such a book such a topic did not receive even a line\r\nof notice; yet one would naturally suppose that it was as important to\r\nthe Empire, morally and strategically, to possess the affection and\r\nrespect of four and a half million citizens within 60 miles of the\r\nBritish coast as of the same number of citizens at the Antipodes.\r\n\r\nMr. Jebb is a Unionist. How he reaches his conclusion I do not know. It\r\nwould seem to be beyond human power to construct a case against Home\r\nRule for Ireland, with its strongly marked individuality of character\r\nand sentiment, which did not textually stultify his case for the more\r\ndistant dependencies. His party generally is in sympathy with the views\r\nexpressed in his book, and has done much to further them. How do they\r\nreconcile them with opposition to Home Rule for Ireland? How do they\r\nexplain away the support for that policy in the Dominions? It seems to\r\nme that their only resource would be to say: \"We are bound to maintain,\r\nand we have the necessary physical force to maintain, the present\r\npolitical system in Ireland, because to alter it would impair the formal\r\nlegislative 'unity' of the United Kingdom; but let us frankly admit that\r\nas long as we take this view there can be no 'Union' in the highest\r\nsense of the word. Ireland must be retarded and estranged. We cannot\r\nraise Territorial Volunteers within her borders; on the contrary, we\r\nmust keep and pay for a standing army of police to preserve our\r\nauthority there. Her population must diminish, her vital energy ebb away\r\nto other lands; as a market for our goods and as a source of revenue for\r\nImperial purposes she must remain undeveloped and unprogressive. She\r\nwill continue rightly to agitate for Home Rule, and this agitation will\r\nalways be baneful both to her and to us. It will distract her energies\r\nfrom her own economic and social problems. It will embitter and degrade\r\nour politics, and dislocate our Parliamentary institutions. She must\r\nsuffer, we must suffer, the Empire must suffer. It is sad, but\r\ninevitable.\"\r\n\r\nMorality aside, is that common sense? Is it strange that the Colonies\r\nthemselves regard such logic, when applied to Ireland, as perverted and\r\nabsurd?\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Australia we have only to recall the fact that at the\r\nclose of the last century, after a generation of controversy and\r\nnegotiation, the Canadian example of 1867 was at length imitated, and\r\nthe Federal Union formed which amalgamated all the mainland States,\r\ntogether with Tasmania, in the Commonwealth of Australia, and that the\r\nUnion was sanctioned and legalized by the Imperial Act of 1900. New\r\nZealand preferred to remain a distinct State. The Australians departed\r\nin some important respects from the Canadian model, the main difference\r\nbeing that a greater measure of independence was retained by the\r\nindividual States, and smaller powers delegated to the central\r\nGovernment. This was a matter of voluntary arrangement as between the\r\nStates themselves, the Home Government standing wholly aside on the\r\nsound principle that Australia knew its own interests best, and that\r\nwhat was best for Australia was best for the Empire.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Letter to Lord Malmesbury, August 13, 1852 (\"Memoirs of an\r\nEx-Minister,\" by the Earl of Malmesbury, vol. i., p. 344).\r\n\r\n[30] \"Life of Gladstone,\" vol. i., p. 363.\r\n\r\n[31] Annual Treasury Returns [\"Imperial Revenue (Collection and\r\nExpenditure)\"].

Henderson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSOUTH AFRICA AND IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the years 1836-37, when Wentworth was agitating for self-government\r\nin New South Wales, and when Canada was in rebellion for the lack of it,\r\nthousands of waggons, driven by men smarting under the same sort of\r\ngrievance, were jolting northward across the South African veld bearing\r\nDutch families from the British Colony of the Cape of Good Hope to the\r\nnew realms we now know as the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal. The\r\n\"Great Trek\" was a form of protest against bad government to which we\r\nhave no parallel in the Empire save in the wholesale emigrations from\r\nIreland at various periods of her history--after the Treaty of Limerick,\r\nagain after the destruction of the wool trade, again in 1770-1777, after\r\nthe Ulster evictions, and lastly after the great famine. The trekkers,\r\nlike the Irish emigrants, nursed a resentment against the British\r\nGovernment which was a source of untold expense and suffering in the\r\nfuture. Indeed, the whole history of South Africa bears a close\r\nresemblance to the history of Ireland. In no other part of the Empire,\r\nsave in Ireland, was the policy of the Home Government so persistently\r\nmisguided, in spite of constantly recurring opportunities for the repair\r\nof past errors. Fatality seems from first to last to have dogged the\r\nfootsteps of those who tried to govern there. Before the British\r\nconquest the Dutch East India Company and the Netherlands Government\r\nwere as unsuccessful as their British successors, whose legal claim to\r\nthe Cape, established for the second time by conquest in 1806, was\r\ndefinitely confirmed by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Dutch\r\ncolonists were a fine race of men, whose ancestors, like the Puritan\r\nfounders of New England, had fled in 1652 from religious persecution,\r\nand who retained the virile qualities of their race. Though in many\r\nrespects they resembled the backward and intensely conservative\r\nFrench-Canadian inhabitants, they differed from them, and resembled\r\ntheir closer relatives in race, the New Englanders, in an innate passion\r\nfor free representative government. They had rebelled repeatedly against\r\ntheir Dutch oppressors, and had gone through a brief Republican phase.\r\nIt is an example, therefore, of the thoughtless inconsequence of our old\r\ncolonial policy that we gave the French-Canadians, who were the least\r\ndesirous of it, the form, without the spirit, of representative\r\ninstitutions, while we denied, until it was too late to avert racial\r\ndiscord, even the form to the Cape Dutch. In truth, the Colony seems to\r\nhave been regarded purely in the light of a naval station, while the\r\nBritish and Irish inflow of settlers, dating from about the year 1820,\r\ncontemporaneously with the advent of free settlers in Australia,\r\nsuggested the possibility of racial oppression by the Dutch majority.\r\nYet if there was little real reason to fear oppression by the French in\r\nCanada, there was still less reason to fear such oppression in the Cape,\r\nwhere Dutch ideals and civilization were far more similar to those of\r\nthe British. In America the absorption of the Dutch Colonies in the\r\nseventeenth century had led to the peaceful fusion of both races, nor\r\nwas there any reason why, under wise rule, the same fusion should not\r\nhave occurred in South Africa. Until 1834 authority was purely military\r\nand despotic. In that year was established a small Legislative Council\r\nof officials and nominated members, with no representative element. In\r\n1837 came the Great Trek.\r\n\r\nNo one disputes that the Dutch colonists had grievances, without the\r\nmeans of redress. As usual, we find a land question in the shape of\r\nenhanced rents charged by Government after the British occupation; the\r\nDutch language was excluded from official use, and English local\r\ninstitutions were introduced with unnecessary abruptness; but the\r\nprincipal grievance concerned the native tribes. Slavery existed in the\r\nColony, and its borders were continually threatened by these tribes. The\r\nDutch colonists were often terribly brutal to the natives; nevertheless\r\nthere is little doubt that a tactful and sympathetic policy could easily\r\nhave secured for them a more humane treatment, and the abolition of\r\nslavery without economic dislocation. But a strong humanitarian\r\nsentiment was sweeping over England at the time, including in its range\r\nthe negro slaves of Jamaica and the unconquered Kaffirs of South Africa,\r\nbut absolutely ignoring, let us note in passing, the economic serfdom of\r\nthe half-starved Irish peasantry at our very doors. Members of this\r\nschool took too little account of the tremendous difficulties faced in\r\nSouth Africa by small handfuls of white colonists in contact with hordes\r\nof savages. The Colonial Government, with a knowledge of the conditions\r\ngained only from well-meaning but somewhat prejudiced missionaries,\r\nendeavoured from 1815 onwards to enforce an impracticable equality\r\nbetween white and coloured men, and abolished slavery at one sudden\r\nstroke in 1833 without reasonable compensation. A large number of the\r\nDutch, unable to tolerate this treatment, deserted the British flag.\r\nThose that remained were under suspicion for more than thirty years, so\r\nthat political progress was very slow. It was not till 1854 that the\r\nColony received a Representative Assembly, and not until 1872, eighteen\r\nyears later than in Australia, and twenty-five years later than in\r\nCanada, that full responsible government was established.\r\n\r\nPiet Retief, one of the leaders of the voluntary exiles, had published a\r\nproclamation in the following terms before he joined the trek: \"We quit\r\nthis Colony under the full assurance that the English Government has\r\nnothing more to require of us, and will allow us to govern ourselves\r\nwithout its interference in the future. We are now leaving the fruitful\r\nland of our birth, in which we have suffered enormous losses and\r\ncontinual vexation, and are about to enter a strange and dangerous\r\nterritory; but we go with a firm reliance on an all-seeing, just, and\r\nmerciful God, whom we shall always fear and humbly endeavour to obey.\"\r\nThis was high language, yet after-events proved that a steady,\r\nconsistently fair treatment on our part would even then have reconciled\r\nthese men to a permanent continuance of British sovereignty.\r\nUnfortunately, our policy oscillated painfully between irritating\r\ninterference and excessive timidity. First of all attempts were made to\r\nstop the trek by force, then to compel the trekkers to return by cutting\r\noff their supplies and ammunition, then to throttle their development of\r\nthe new lands north of the Orange and Vaal Rivers by calling into being\r\nfictitious native States on a huge scale in the midst of and around\r\nthem, then tardily to repair the disastrous effects of this policy; but\r\nnot before it had led to open hostilities (1845). Hostilities, however,\r\nhad this temporarily good result, in that it brought to the front one of\r\nthe ablest and wisest of the Cape Governors, Sir Harry Smith, who\r\ndefeated the Boers at Boomplatz in 1848, established what went by the\r\nname of the Orange River Sovereignty, and in a year or two secured such\r\ngood and peaceful government within its borders as to attract\r\nconsiderable numbers of English and Scotch colonists. The malcontents\r\nretired across the Vaal. Then came an abrupt change of policy in the\r\nHome Government, a sudden desire actuated mainly by fear of more native\r\nwars, to cancel all that was possible of our commitments in South\r\nAfrica. The Transvaal, by the Sand River Convention, was declared\r\nindependent in 1852, the Orange Free State, by the Convention of\r\nBloemfontein, in 1854. This was to rush from one extreme to the other.\r\nIt was as though in 1847 we had erected Quebec into a sovereign State\r\ninstead of giving it responsible government under the Crown, or as if in\r\n1843 we had been so deeply convinced by O'Connell's second agitation for\r\nrepeal that we had leapt straight from coercive government to the\r\nfoundation of an independent Republic in Ireland, instead of giving her\r\nthe kind of Home Rule which she was asking for.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet too late to mend. In 1854, when the cession of the Free\r\nState had just been carried out, Sir George Grey, whom we have met with\r\nin Australia and New Zealand, came as High Commissioner to the Cape. In\r\n1859 he made the proposal I alluded to in the last chapter for\r\nfederating all the South African States, including the two new\r\nRepublics. There is little doubt that the scheme was feasible then. The\r\nOrange Free State was willing to join, and, indeed, had initiated\r\nproposals for Federation. Its adhesion would have compelled the\r\nTransvaal, always more hostile to British rule, to come in eventually,\r\nif not at once; for the relations of the two Republics were friendly\r\nenough at the time to permit one man, Pretorius, to be President of both\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was rejected by Lord Derby's Tory Cabinet, and Grey, a\r\n\"dangerous man,\" as Lord Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary, dubbed him,\r\nwas recalled.\r\n\r\nSixteen years later, in 1875, Lord Carnarvon himself, as a member of the\r\nDisraeli Ministry, revived the project. Converted in his views of the\r\nColonies, like many of his Tory colleagues at this period, he had\r\ncarried through Parliament the Federation of Canada in 1867, and hoped\r\nto do the same with South Africa. But it was too late. The Cape\r\nParliament, now in possession of a responsible Ministry, was hostile,\r\nwhile twenty years of self-government, for the most part under the great\r\nPresident Brand, had changed the sentiments of the Free State.\r\nFederation, then, was impossible. On the other hand, the Transvaal was\r\nin a state of political unrest and of danger from native aggression,\r\nwhich gave a pretext for reversion to the long-abandoned policy of\r\nannexation, and to that extreme Carnarvon promptly went in April, 1877.\r\nHe took this dangerous course without ascertaining the considered wishes\r\nof the majority of the Boers, acting through his emissary, Sir T.\r\nShepstone, on the informal application of a minority of townsmen who\r\nhonestly wished to come under British rule.\r\n\r\nRash as the measure was, lasting good might have come of it had the\r\nessential step been taken of preserving representative government. The\r\npromise was given and broken. For three years the Assembly, or\r\nVolksraad, was not summoned. Once more home statesmanship was blind, and\r\nlocal administration blunderingly oppressive. Shepstone was the wrong\r\nman for the post of Administrator. Sir Owen Lanyon, his successor, was\r\nan arrogant martinet of the stamp familiar in Canada before 1840, and\r\npainfully familiar in Ireland. The refusal of an Assembly naturally\r\nstrengthened the popular demand for a reversal of the annexation, and\r\nthis demand, twice pressed in London through a deputation headed by Paul\r\nKruger, obscured the whole issue, and raised a question of British\r\nnational pride, with all its inevitable consequences, where none need\r\nhave been raised. There was a moment of hope when Sir Bartle Frere, who\r\nstands, perhaps, next to Sir George Grey on the roll of eminent High\r\nCommissioners, endeavoured to pacify the Boer malcontents, and drafted\r\nthe scheme of a liberal Constitution for the Transvaal. But one of the\r\nlast acts of the Tory Government, at the end of 1879, was to recall\r\nFrere for an alleged transgression of his powers in regard to the Zulu\r\nWar, and to pigeon-hole his scheme. Mr. Gladstone, who in opposition\r\nhad denounced the annexation with good enough justification, though in\r\nterms which under the circumstances were immoderate, found himself\r\ncompelled to confirm it when he took office in April, 1880. But he, too,\r\nallowed the liberal Constitution to sleep in its pigeon-hole. He was\r\nassured by the officials on the spot that there was no danger, that the\r\nmajority were loyal, and only a minority of turbulent demagogues\r\ndisloyal; and in December, 1880, the rebellion duly broke out, and the\r\nTransvaal Republic was proclaimed. What followed we know, war, Laing's\r\nNek, Majuba, and one more violent oscillation of policy in the\r\nconcession of a virtual independence to the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nWhatever we may think of the policy of this concession, and Lord Morley\r\nhas made the best case that can be made for Mr. Gladstone's action, it\r\nis certain that it was only a link in a long chain of blunders for which\r\nboth great political parties had been equally responsible, and of which\r\nthe end had not yet come. The nation at large, scarcely alive until now\r\nto the existence of the Colonies, was stung into Imperial consciousness\r\nby a national humiliation, for so it was not unnaturally regarded,\r\ncoming from an obscure pastoral community confusedly identified as\r\nsomething between a Colony, a foreign power, and a troublesome native\r\ntribe. The history of the previous seventy years in South Africa was\r\neither unknown or forgotten, and Mr. Gladstone, who in past years had\r\npreached to indifferent hearers the soundest and sanest doctrine of\r\nenlightened Imperialism, suddenly appeared, and for ever after remained\r\nin the eyes of a great body of his countrymen, as a betrayer of the\r\nnation's honour. Resentment was all the greater in that it was\r\nuniversally believed that Laing's Nek and Majuba were unlucky little\r\naccidents, and that another month or two of hostilities would have\r\nhumbled the Boers to the dust.\r\n\r\nThis illusion, which is not yet eradicated, and which has coloured all\r\nsubsequent discussion of the subject, lasted unmodified until the first\r\nmonths of the war in 1899, when events took place exactly similar to\r\nLaing's Nek and Majuba, and were followed by a campaign lasting nearly\r\nthree years, requiring nearly 500,000 men for its completion, and the\r\nco-operation of the whole Empire. It is impossible to estimate the\r\ncourse events would have taken in 1881 had the war been prolonged. If\r\nthe Free State had joined the Transvaal, it may be reasonably\r\nconjectured that we should have been weaker, relatively, than in 1899.\r\nThough the Boers were less numerous, less well organized, and less\r\nunited as a nation in 1881, they were even better shots and stalkers\r\nthan in 1899, because they had had more recent practice against game and\r\nnatives; nor was there a large British population in the Transvaal to\r\ncounteract their efforts and supply magnificent corps like the Imperial\r\nLight Horse for service in arms against them. Our army, just as brave,\r\nwas in every other respect, especially in the matter of mounted men and\r\nmarksmanship, less fitted for such a peculiar campaign, and could have\r\ncounted with far less certainty upon that assistance from mounted\r\ncolonial troops without which the war of 1899-1902 could never have been\r\nfinished at all. Our command of the sea was less secure; the Egyptian\r\nWar of 1882 was brewing, and Ireland, where the Great Land Act of 1881\r\nwas not yet law, was seething with crime and disorder little\r\ndistinguishable from war itself, and demanding large bodies of troops.\r\n\r\nIf the further course of a war in 1881 is a matter of speculation, what\r\nwe all know for certain is, first, that the conditions which led to war\r\nwere produced by seventy years of vacillating policy, and, second, that\r\nwar itself would have been a useless waste of life and treasure, unless\r\nsuccess in it had been followed, as in 1906, by the grant of that\r\nresponsible Government which all along had been the key to the whole\r\ndifficulty, the condition precedent to a Federal Union of the South\r\nAfrican States, and to their closer incorporation in the Empire.\r\n\r\nFew persons realized this at the time. The whole situation changed\r\ndisastrously for the worse. Arrogance and mutual contempt embittered the\r\nrelations of the races. Then came a crucial test for the Boer capacity\r\nfor enlightened and generous statesmanship. Gold was discovered in the\r\nTransvaal, and a large British population flocked in. The same problem,\r\nwith local modifications, faced the Boers as had been faced in Upper and\r\nLower Canada, and for centuries past in Ireland. Were they to trust or\r\nsuspect, to admit or to exclude from full political rights, the\r\nnew-comers? Was it to be the policy of the Duke of Wellington or of the\r\nEarl of Durham, of Fitzgibbon or the Volunteers? They chose the wrong\r\ncourse, and set up an oligarchical ascendancy like the \"family compact\"\r\nof Upper Canada and Nova Scotia. Can we be surprised that they, a rude,\r\nbackward race, failed under the test where we ourselves, with far less\r\njustification, had failed so often? Their experience of our methods had\r\nbeen bad from first to last. Their latest taste of our rule had been the\r\ncoercive system of Lanyon, and they feared, with only too good reason,\r\nas events after the second war proved, that any concession would lead to\r\na counter-ascendancy of British interests in a country which was legally\r\ntheir own, not a portion of the British dominions. We had suffered\r\nnothing, and had no reason to fear anything, from the Irish and\r\nFrench-Canadian Catholics, nor from the Nonconformist Radicals of Upper\r\nCanada. It would have been well if a small fraction of the abuse\r\nlavished on the tyrannical Boer oligarchy six thousand miles away had\r\nbeen diverted into criticism of the government of a country within sixty\r\nmiles of our shores, where a large majority of the inhabitants had been\r\nfor generations asking for the same thing as the Uitlander minority in\r\nthe Transvaal--Home Rule--and were stimulated to make that demand by\r\ngrievances of a kind unknown in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nBut the British blood was up; the Boer blood was up. Such an atmosphere\r\nis not favourable to far-seeing statesmanship, and it would have taken\r\nstatesmanship on both sides little short of superhuman to avert another\r\nwar. The silly raid of 1895 and its condonation by public opinion in\r\nEngland hastened the explosion. Can anyone wonder that public opinion in\r\nIreland was instinctively against that war? Only a pedant will seize on\r\nthe supposed paradox that a war for equal rights for white men should\r\nhave met with reprobation from an Ireland clamouring for Home Rule.\r\nIrish experience amply justified Irishmen in suspecting precisely what\r\nthe Boers suspected, a counter-ascendancy in the gold interest, and in\r\nseeing in a war for the conquest of a small independent country by a\r\nmighty foreign power an analogy to the original conquest of Ireland by\r\nthe same power. It is hard to speak with restraint of the educated\r\nmen--men with books and time to read them, with brains and the wealth\r\nand leisure to develop them--who to this very day abuse their talents in\r\nencouraging among the ignorant multitude the belief that the Irish\r\nleaders of that day were, to use the old hackneyed phrase, \"traitors to\r\nthe Empire.\" If we look at the whole of these events in just\r\nperspective, if we search coolly and patiently for abiding principles\r\nbeneath the sordid din and confusion of racial strife, we shall agree\r\nthat in some respects Irishmen were better friends to the Empire than\r\nthe politicians who denounced them, and sounder judges of its needs. Yet\r\nthere can be no doubt that the Transvaal complications, followed\r\nunhappily by the Gordon episode in the Soudan, reacted fatally on\r\nIreland, and that the Irish problem in its turn reacted with bad effect\r\non the Transvaal. When the statesman who refused to avenge Majuba in\r\n1881 proposed his Irish Home Rule Bills in 1886 and 1893, it was easy\r\nfor prejudiced minds to associate the two policies as harmonious parts\r\nof one great scheme of national dismemberment and betrayal. Boers,\r\nIrish, and Soudanese savages, all were confusedly lumped together as\r\ndangerous people whom it was England's duty to conquer and coerce.\r\n\r\nThe South African War of 1899-1902 came and passed. People will discuss\r\nto the end of time whether or not it could have been avoided. Parties\r\nwill differ to the end of time about its moral justification. For my own\r\npart, I think it is pleasanter to dwell on the splendid qualities it\r\nevoked in both races, and above all on the mutual respect which replaced\r\nthe mutual contempt of earlier days. I myself am disposed to think that\r\nat the pass matters had reached in 1896 nothing but open war could have\r\nset the relations of the two races on a healthy footing.\r\n\r\nBut bold and generous statesmanship was needed if the fruits of this\r\nmutual respect were to be reaped. The defeated Republics were now\r\nBritish Colonies, their inhabitants British subjects. After many\r\nvicissitudes we were back once more in the old political situation of\r\n1836 before the Great Trek, and the policy which was right then was\r\nright now. Bitter awakening as it was to our proud people after a war\r\ninvolving such colossal sacrifices, it was still just as true as of old\r\nthat in Ireland, Canada, Australia, South Africa, or anywhere else, it\r\nis utterly impossible for one white democracy to rule another properly\r\non the principle of ascendancy. It was physically possible, thanks to\r\nIreland's proximity, to deny that country Home Rule, but it would not\r\nhave been even physically possible in the Transvaal and Orange River\r\nColony. Yet the idea was conceived and the policy strongly backed which\r\ncould only have had the disastrous effect of bringing into being two\r\nIrelands in the midst of our South African dominions. It is not yet\r\ngenerally recognized that we owe the defeat of this policy in the first\r\ninstance to Lord Kitchener. From the moment he took the supreme military\r\ncommand in South Africa at the end of 1900, while prosecuting the war\r\nwith iron severity and sleepless energy, he insisted on and worked for a\r\nsettlement by consent, with a formal promise of future self-government\r\nto the Boers. In this he was in sharp opposition to Lord Milner, who\r\ndesired to extort an unconditional surrender. Of these two strong, able,\r\nhigh-minded men, the soldier, curiously enough, was the better\r\nstatesman. In temperament he recalls the General Abercromby of 1797 on\r\nthe eve of the Irish rebellion, still more perhaps General Carleton, who\r\nadministered French Canada in the critical period after its conquest and\r\nduring the American War. Lord Milner, in political theory, not in\r\npersonality, corresponds to Fitzgibbon. His view was that British\r\nprestige and authority could only be maintained in the future by thus\r\nhumbling the national pride of our adversaries, who, moreover, by the\r\nformal annexations of 1900, carried into effect when the war was still\r\nyoung, were by a legal fiction rebels, not belligerents. Lord Kitchener,\r\nbesides seeing, as the responsible soldier in the field, the sheer\r\nphysical impossibility of lowering the Boer national pride by any\r\nmilitary operations he had the power to undertake, from the beginning of\r\nthe guerilla war onwards, was a truer judge of human nature and a better\r\nImperialist at heart in realizing that the self-respect of the Boers was\r\na precious asset, not a dangerous menace to the Empire, and that the\r\nwhole fate of South Africa depended on a racial reconciliation on the\r\nbasis of equal political rights, which would be for ever precluded by\r\ncompelling the Boers to pass under the Caudine Forks.\r\n\r\nFortunately Lord Kitchener was supported by the Home Government, and the\r\nPeace of Vereeniging took the form of a surrender on terms, or,\r\nvirtually, of a treaty, formally guaranteeing, among other things, the\r\nconcession \"when circumstances should permit\" of \"representative\r\ninstitutions leading up to self-government.\" The next ordeal of British\r\nstatesmanship came when the time arrived in 1905 to redeem this promise.\r\nThere were two distinctly defined alternatives: one, to profit by\r\nexperience and to give responsible government at once; the other, for\r\nthe time being, to copy one of the constitutional models which had long\r\nbeen obsolete curiosities in the history of all the white Colonies,\r\nwhich had never failed to produce mischievous results, whether in a\r\nbi-racial or a uni-racial community, and which were in reality suited\r\nonly to groups of officials and traders living in the midst of\r\nuneducated coloured races in tropical lands. The Government, and we\r\ncannot doubt that their traditional policy toward Ireland warped their\r\nviews, declared for the latter alternative, and issued under Letters\r\nPatent a Constitution which happily never came into force. Like the Act\r\nof Union with Ireland, it gave the shadow of freedom without the\r\nsubstance. It set up a single Legislative Chamber, four-fifths elective,\r\nbut containing, as _ex-officio_ members, the whole of the Executive\r\nCouncil as nominated by the Crown. Executive power, therefore, together\r\nwith the last word in all legislation, was to remain wholly in the hands\r\nof the Crown, acting through a Ministry not responsible to the people's\r\nrepresentatives. It would have been difficult to design a plan more\r\ncertain to promote friction, racialism, and an eventual deadlock,\r\nnecessitating either a humiliating surrender by the Government under\r\npressure of the refusal of supplies, or a reversion to despotic\r\ngovernment which would have produced another war. With wide differences\r\nof detail and with the added risk of financial deadlock, it was sought\r\nto establish the kind of political situation prevalent in Ireland after\r\nthe Act of Union. The executive power in that country, and, with the\r\nexception of the Department of Agriculture, the policy and personnel of\r\nthe host of nominated Boards through which its affairs are administered,\r\nstill stand wholly outside popular control, while legislation in\r\naccordance with Irish views is only possible when, in the fluctuation of\r\nthe British party balance, a British Ministry happens to be in sympathy\r\nwith these views, and only too often not even then.\r\n\r\nStatesmen who looked with complacency on the history of a century in\r\nIreland under such a system naturally took a similar view of the\r\nTransvaal, deriving it from the same low estimate of human tendencies.\r\nThe literature, despatches, and speeches of the period carry us straight\r\nback to the Canadian controversies of 1837-1840, and beyond them to the\r\nUnion controversy of 1800. In one respect the parallel with the Irish\r\nUnion is closer, because, while British opinion in Lower Canada was\r\npredominantly against responsible government, there was in Ireland a\r\nstrong current of unbribed Protestant opinion against the Union.\r\nSimilarly, in the Transvaal, there was a strong feeling among a section\r\nof the British population, coinciding with the general wishes of the\r\nDutch population, in favour of full responsible government. In other\r\nwords, the mere prospect of self-government lessened racial cleavage,\r\nbrought men of the two races together, and began the evolution of a new\r\nparty cleavage on the normal lines natural to modern communities. The\r\nwhole question was keenly canvassed at public meetings and in the Press\r\nfrom November, 1904, to February 5, 1905, and in Johannesburg a British\r\nparty of considerable strength took the lead in demanding the fuller\r\npolitical rights, and formed the Responsible Government Association. The\r\ncontroversy was embodied in a Blue-Book laid before Parliament,[35] and\r\nat every stage of its progress the facts were cabled home by Lord Milner\r\nto the Government, who thus had the whole situation before them when\r\nthey came to their decision.\r\n\r\nIt would be worth the reader's while to study with some care the terms\r\nof the despatch announcing that decision.[36] He will feel himself in\r\ncontact with fundamental principles, undisturbed by individual bias; for\r\nno one could suspect Mr. Lyttelton, the genial and popular Secretary of\r\nState who penned the despatch, of any violent prejudices. Yet the spirit\r\nof the whole despatch, though gentle and persuasive in its terms, is the\r\nspirit of Fitzgibbon's brutally outspoken argument for the extinction of\r\nthe Irish Parliament, and the complete exclusion of Irish Roman\r\nCatholics from influence over their country's affairs. The despatch\r\nbegins, it is true, by explaining that the proposed Constitution is only\r\nintended to be temporary; that it had been the invariable custom to\r\ngrant freedom to the Colonies by degrees, and that the custom must be\r\nfollowed; but the reasons adduced for following it, if we consider that\r\nthey were adduced in the year 1905, instead of a century and a half\r\nback, constitute one of the strangest of all the strange inversions of\r\nhistorical cause and effect which a Home Rule controversy has ever\r\nsuggested to the human brain. Instead of inferring from our bitter\r\nexperiences in Upper and Lower Canada, which are mentioned in the\r\ndespatch, and in Ireland, which is not, that race distinctions increase\r\ninstead of lessening the necessity for responsible government, Mr.\r\nLyttelton complacently quotes bi-racial Lower Canada as a precedent for\r\nhis Transvaal Constitution. Quite frankly, though in curiously\r\nmisleading terms,[37] he records the fact that a similar Constitution\r\nthere led to deadlock and rebellion. Without intention to deceive, he\r\nignores the fact that wholly British Upper Canada reached the same pass\r\nfor the same reasons; and he appears to look forward with equanimity to\r\nthe passage of the unfortunate Transvaal through an identically painful\r\nphase of history toward the same sanguinary climax. The radical error\r\nin the official version of events in Canada appears in the comparison\r\nbetween the rebellions of 1837 and the South African War of 1899-1902.\r\nTo contrast the \"brief armed rising\" in Canada with the three years' war\r\nin South Africa, and to argue that a degree of freedom could safely be\r\ngiven after the former, which would involve great danger after the\r\nlatter, was to show ignorance of the chain of historical events and\r\nblindness to their true moral. The underlying idea is the one applied to\r\nthe old American Colonies and for centuries to Ireland, namely, that the\r\nmore mutinous a dependency is, the less reason for giving it Home Rule,\r\nwith the paradoxical corollary applied even to this day in Ireland, that\r\nif it is not disorderly it does not need Home Rule. So from age to age\r\nstatesmen run their heads against facts, perpetuate the errors of their\r\nforefathers, and do their unconscious best to intensify the evils they\r\ndeplore. It was erroneous to regard either the Canadian Rebellions or\r\nthe Boer War as events which rendered responsible government more or\r\nless dangerous. Each of these events was itself the climax of a long\r\nperiod of irresponsible misgovernment dating from about the same period,\r\nthe second decade of the nineteenth century, and demanding the same\r\nremedy. In the Boer case, continuity was twice broken by grants of\r\nindependence, and the climax proportionally delayed, but the origin of\r\nthe trouble was the same. If the Boers had not trekked _en masse_ from\r\nCape Colony in order to escape from misgovernment, both movements--in\r\nthe Cape and Canada--might have come to a head in exactly the same year,\r\n1837.\r\n\r\nIn sober, weighty, tactful phrases, carefully chosen to avoid giving\r\nneedless offence to the Dutch, the despatch laboriously overthrows the\r\nLiberal theory of government, and works out the negation of all Imperial\r\nexperience. It deplores the \"bitter memories\" of war, which free\r\ninstitutions, by tending to \"emphasize and stereotype the racial line,\"\r\nwill make more, not less bitter, and which can be effaced only by the\r\n\"healing effect of time.\" We think of the Durham Report, of Ireland, and\r\nmarvel. We recollect the bulky Blue-Book at Mr. Lyttelton's elbow as he\r\nwrote, full of speeches and articles by Englishmen, showing quite\r\ncorrectly, as has since been proved, that the \"racial line\" in\r\nJohannesburg was growing fainter daily with the mere prospect of\r\nresponsible government. These men were not afraid of the Dutch, and said\r\nso. The answer was that they ought to be, or, in the persuasive language\r\nof diplomacy, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty's Government trust that those of British origin in the\r\nTransvaal who, with honest conviction, have advocated the immediate\r\nconcession of full responsible government, will recognize the soundness\r\nand cogency of the reasons, both in their own interests and in those of\r\nthe Empire, for proceeding more cautiously and slowly, and that under a\r\npolitical system which admittedly has its difficulties they will,\r\nnotwithstanding a temporary disappointment, do their best to promote the\r\nwelfare of the country and the smooth working of its institutions.\"\r\n\r\nThen came a chivalrous compliment to the Dutch for their \"gallant\r\nstruggle\" in the war, coupled with a reminder that they are not to be\r\ntrusted with political power, a reminder so courteously worded that it,\r\ntoo, becomes a compliment:\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of Dutch origin have recently witnessed, after their\r\ngallant struggle against superior power, the fall of the Republic\r\nfounded by the valour and sufferings of their ancestors, and cannot be\r\nexpected, until time has done more to heal the wound, to entertain the\r\nmost cordial feelings towards the Government of the Transvaal. But from\r\nthem also, as from a people of practical genius, who have learned by\r\nlong experience to make the best of circumstances, His Majesty's\r\nGovernment expect co-operation in the task of making their race, no\r\nlonger in isolated independence, a strong pillar in the fabric of a\r\nworld-wide Empire. That this should be the result, and that a complete\r\nreconciliation between men of two great and kindred races should, under\r\nthe leading of Divine Providence, speedily come to pass, is the ardent\r\ndesire of His Majesty the King and of His Majesty's Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone recalls the tone of Pitt and Castlereagh in proposing the\r\nUnion. But Fitzgibbon went more directly to the point in saying outright\r\nthat, Ireland having been conquered and confiscated, the colonists \"were\r\nat the mercy of the old inhabitants of the island,\" and that laws must\r\nbe framed by an external power to \"meet the vicious propensities of\r\nhuman nature.\" Let us recognize unreservedly that the words of the\r\nTransvaal despatch were the outcome of deep and sincere conviction. That\r\nis the worst of it. From age to age Ireland has to suffer for the depth\r\nand sincerity of these convictions. There, too, the cleavage of race and\r\nreligion, never complete, always defying the official efforts to\r\n\"stereotype and emphasize it,\" to quote the despatch of 1905, grows\r\nfainter with time, and will grow fainter as long as the national\r\nmovement lives to draw men together in the common interest of Ireland.\r\nThe Volunteers, Wolfe Tone, Emmet, many of the Young Irelanders, Isaac\r\nButt, Parnell, were Protestants. And there is a strong band of\r\nProtestant Home Rulers to-day in Ulster and out of it, landlords,\r\ntenants, capitalists, labourers, Members of Parliament, and clergymen,\r\nwho declare that they are not afraid of Catholic oppression, and who are\r\ntold by Unionists that they ought to be. And in Ireland, too, the Roman\r\nCatholic majority are told, rarely, it is true, in the courteous phrases\r\nof Mr. Lyttelton's despatch, that they \"cannot be expected to entertain\r\nthe most cordial feelings towards the Government.\" In Ireland, also, is\r\na \"political system which admittedly has its difficulties,\" ironical\r\neuphemism for a system whose analogue in the Transvaal could have been\r\nused by the subject race, had they so willed, to bring civil government\r\nto a standstill, without the means of furnishing anything better, and\r\nwhich under the Act of Union can be, and has been, used to dislocate the\r\nParliamentary life of the United Kingdom. The Boers were asked \"as a\r\npeople of practical genius\" to assist the \"smooth working\" of an\r\nunworkable Constitution, so as to promote the \"reconciliation of two\r\ngreat and kindred races.\" The Irish are pursued with invective for\r\nlegitimately using the constitutional power given them in order, while\r\nfreeing Parliament from an intolerable incubus, to gain the right to\r\nelicit character and responsibility in themselves by shouldering their\r\nown burdens and saving their own souls.\r\n\r\nIf the official view of the Transvaal was mistaken, the summit of error\r\nwas reached in the view taken of the Orange River Colony. In that\r\nColony, which was almost wholly pastoral and Dutch, and which until the\r\nwar had enjoyed free institutions uninterruptedly for half a century,\r\nand had made remarkably good vise of them, representative government,\r\neven of the illusory kind designed for the Transvaal, was to be\r\nindefinitely postponed, postponed at any rate until the results of the\r\n\"experiment\" in the Transvaal had been observed.\r\n\r\nThe Government \"recognize that there are industrial and economic\r\nconditions peculiar to the Transvaal, which make it very desirable in\r\nthat Colony to have at the earliest possible date some better means of\r\nascertaining the views of the different sections of the population than\r\nthe present system affords. The question as regards the Orange River\r\nColony being a less urgent one, it appears to them that there will be\r\nadvantage in allowing a short period to intervene before elective\r\nrepresentative institutions are granted to the last-named Colony,\r\nbecause this will permit His Majesty's Government to observe the\r\nexperiment, and, if need be, to profit by the experience so gained.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the train of reasoning in this strange specimen of political\r\nargument? It was important to \"ascertain the views\" of the bi-racial\r\nTransvaal, but needless to ascertain the views of the practically\r\nhomogeneous Orange River Colony. The \"question\" there is a \"less urgent\r\none.\" What question? Why less urgent? Is it that the British minority,\r\nbeing so very small, is more liable to oppression by the Dutch? That is\r\na tenable point, though by parity of reasoning it would seem to make the\r\nquestion more, not less, urgent, and the importance of \"ascertaining the\r\nviews\" of the different sections of the population, greater, not less.\r\nOr is it the diametrically opposite train of thought, namely, that an\r\nassumed improbability of disorder owing to the homogeneity of the\r\npopulation is a reason, not for giving Home Rule, but for withholding\r\nit? These contradictions and confusions are painfully familiar in\r\nanti-Home Rule dialectics all over the world. A quiet Ireland does not\r\nwant Home Rule; a turbulent Ireland is not fit for it. If the Unionist\r\nelement in Ireland is strong, that is clearly an argument for\r\nwithholding Home Rule in deference to the wishes of a strong minority.\r\nIf the minority, on the other hand, is proved to be small, all the\r\ngreater reason for withholding it, because oppression by the majority\r\nwill be easier. So the sterile argument swings back and forth, and men\r\nstill talk of \"experiments\" and \"profiting by experience,\" while the\r\ndemonstration of their errors is written in the blood and tears of\r\ncenturies, and while masses of facts accumulate, demonstrating the great\r\ntruth that free democratic government, whatever its disadvantages and\r\ndangers--and it has both--is the best resource for uniting,\r\nstrengthening, and enriching a community of white men.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal Constitution of 1905 was cancelled on the incoming of the\r\nLiberal Ministry at the end of that year, and in the following year full\r\nresponsible government was granted both to the Transvaal and Orange\r\nRiver Colony, with the results that we know. Instantaneously there\r\npermeated the bi-racial urban society in the Transvaal a new sense of\r\nbrotherhood. Men of different race, as far apart in spirit as the\r\nmembers of the Kildare Street Club, the Orange Societies, and the\r\nAncient Order of Hibernians, met and made friends because it was not\r\nonly natural but necessary to make friends, since on all alike lay the\r\nburden of doing their best for their country on a basis of equal\r\ncitizenship. Nobody out there called the new system an \"experiment.\" The\r\nwrench once over, the thing once done, there was general unanimity that\r\nwhatever the difficulties--and there were great difficulties--it was the\r\nright thing to be done under the circumstances, and if this unanimity\r\nwas combined, rightly or wrongly, with a good deal of resentment against\r\nthe Liberal attitude at home towards Chinese labour, nobody is any the\r\nworse for that. The day will come when even that burning question will\r\nbe seen in its true perspective as an infinitesimally small point beside\r\nthe great principle of responsible government, which includes the\r\ndecision of labour questions, together with all other branches of\r\ndomestic policy.\r\n\r\nConservative opinion at home has been slower to change than British\r\nopinion in the Transvaal. But, again, this was natural. Parties had long\r\nbeen divided on the South African question. The abrupt reversal of\r\npolicy was felt as a humiliation, and the ingrained mental habits\r\nengendered by the traditional policy towards Ireland yielded slowly,\r\ngrudgingly, and fearfully to the proof of error in South Africa. It is\r\nnot for the sake of opening an old wound, but solely because it is\r\nabsolutely necessary for the completion of my argument, that I have to\r\nrecall the angry and violent speeches which followed the announcement of\r\nthe new policy; the dogmatic prognostications of Imperial disruption, of\r\nfinancial collapse, and of a cruel Boer tyranny in the emancipated\r\nColonies; the charges of wanton betrayal of loyalists, of disgraceful\r\nsurrender to \"the enemy.\" Some of the leading actors in these scenes,\r\nnotably Mr. Balfour and Mr. Lyttelton, have since acknowledged that they\r\nwere wrong, while apparently feeling it their duty as honourable and\r\nloyal men to give a somewhat misleading turn to an old controversy in\r\ntheir praise of Lord Milner's services to South Africa. That Lord\r\nMilner, in his administration during and after the war, did, indeed, do\r\na vast amount of sound and lasting work for South Africa is perfectly\r\ntrue, and he deserves all honour for it. Probably no public servant of\r\nthe Empire ever laboured in its service with more unstinted devotion and\r\na higher sense of duty. But good administration is not an adequate\r\nsubstitute for knowledge of men, and that knowledge Lord Milner lacked.\r\nHe did no service to the British colonists of South Africa in telling\r\nthem that they had been shamefully betrayed by the Home Government in\r\n1906. It would have been wiser to advise them to rely on themselves and\r\non the justice and wisdom of their Dutch fellow-citizens. His violent\r\nspeeches in 1906-1908 about the calamitous results of permitting Dutch\r\ninfluences free play in South Africa--speeches breathing the essential\r\nspirit of Fitzgibbonism--would have wrought incalculable mischief had\r\nthey coincided with effective British policy; while his view, as\r\nexpressed in the House of Lords,[38] that a preparatory régime of\r\nbenevolent despotism, showing \"the obvious solicitude of the Government\r\nfor the welfare of the people,\" and taking shape \"in a hundred and one\r\nworks of material advancement,\" would \"win us friends and diminish our\r\nenemies,\" evinces an ignorance of the ordinary motives influencing the\r\nconduct of white men, which would be incredible if we had not Irish\r\nexperience before us. \"Twenty years of resolute government,\" said Lord\r\nSalisbury. \"Home Rule will be killed by kindness,\" said many of his\r\nsuccessors. In later chapters I shall have to show what well-meant\r\nkindness and resolute government have done for Ireland. If even at this\r\nlate hour Lord Milner would frankly acknowledge his error, I believe he\r\nwould enormously enhance his reputation in the eyes of the whole Empire.\r\n\r\nAs practical men, let us remember that the Constitutions of 1906 would\r\nnot have become law if, instead of being issued under Letters Patent,\r\nthey had had to pass through Parliament in the form of a Bill. The whole\r\nConservative party, following Lord Milner, was vehemently against the\r\nLetters Patent. Those who witnessed the debate upon them in the House of\r\nCommons will not forget the scene. I recall this fact without any desire\r\nto entangle myself in the current controversy about the Upper House, but\r\nwith the strictly practical object of showing that because a Home Rule\r\nBill is defeated in Parliament, as the Irish Bills of 1886 and 1893 were\r\ndefeated, it does not necessarily follow that its policy is wrong. Nor\r\ndoes it follow that its policy is wrong if that defeat in Parliament is\r\nconfirmed by a General Election. Home Rule for Canada never had to pass,\r\nand would not have passed even the Parliamentary test. Skilful and\r\ndetermined organization could have wrecked even the Australian\r\nConstitutions. No one, certainly, could have guaranteed a favourable\r\nresult of a General Election taken expressly upon the Transvaal and\r\nOrange River Constitutions of 1906, with the whole machinery of one of\r\nthe great parties thrown into the scale against them. We know the case\r\nmade against Ireland on such occasions, and the case against the\r\nconquered Republics was made in Parliament with ten times greater force.\r\nIf anyone doubts this, let him compare the speeches on Ireland in 1886\r\nand 1893 with the speeches on South Africa in 1905-06. With the\r\nalteration of a name or two, with the substitution, for example, of\r\nJohannesburg for Ulster, the speeches against South African and Irish\r\nHome Rule might be almost interchangeable. For electioneering purposes,\r\nevidences, in word and act, of Boer treason, rapacity, and\r\nvindictiveness, could have been made by skilful orators to seem damning\r\nand unanswerable. All the arts for inflaming popular passion under the\r\npretext of \"patriotism\" would have been used, and we know that\r\npatriotism sometimes assumes strange disguises. The material would have\r\nbeen rich and easily accessible. Instead of having to ransack ancient\r\nnumbers of Irish or American newspapers for incautious phrases dropped\r\nby Mr. Redmond or Mr. O'Brien in moments of unusual provocation, the\r\nspeeches of Botha, Steyn, and De Wet, during the war, and even at the\r\nPeace Conference, would have been ready for the hoardings and the\r\nfly-sheets, and they would have had an appreciable effect.\r\n\r\nAm I weakening the case for democracy itself in pressing this view?\r\nSurely not. One democracy is incapable of understanding the domestic\r\nneeds and problems of another. Whenever, therefore, a democracy finds\r\nitself responsible for the adjudication of a claim for Home Rule from\r\nwhite men, it should limit itself to ascertaining whether the claim is\r\ngenuine and sincere. If it is, the claim should be granted, and a\r\nConstitution constructed in friendly concert with the men who are to\r\nlive under it. That way lies safety and honour, and, happily, the\r\ndemocracy is being educated to that truth. If this be a counsel of\r\nperfection; if the difficult and delicate task of settling the details\r\nof Irish Home Rule is to be hampered and complicated by the\r\nresuscitation of those time-honoured discussions over abstract\r\nprinciples which ought long ago to have been buried and forgotten, let\r\nevery patriotic and enlightened man at any rate do his best to sweeten\r\nand mollify the controversy, to extirpate its grosser manifestations,\r\nand to substitute reason for passion.\r\n\r\nThe grant of responsible government to the Transvaal and Orange River\r\nColony reacted with amazing rapidity on South African politics as a\r\nwhole. It took the Canadian Provinces twenty-seven years (if we reckon\r\nfrom 1840), and the Australian States forty-five years (if we reckon\r\nfrom 1855), to reach a Federal Union. Hardly a minute was wasted in\r\nSouth Africa. Under very able guidance, the scheme was canvassed almost\r\nfrom the first, and in two years trusted leaders of both races,\r\nrepresenting Natal, Cape Colony, and two newly emancipated\r\nColonies--men, some of whom had been shooting at one another only five\r\nyears before--were sitting at a table together hammering out the details\r\nof a South African Union. Here, indeed, was shown the \"practical genius\"\r\nwhich the Government of 1905 had piously invoked for their abortive\r\nConstitution. In the spirit of forbearance, of sympathy, of wise\r\ncompromise, which governed the proceedings of this famous Conference,\r\nwas to be found the measure of the longing of all parties to extinguish\r\nracialism and make South Africa truly a nation. The Imperial Act\r\nlegalizing the arrangements ultimately arrived at by the agreement of\r\nthe colonists was passed in 1909. The political system constructed\r\ncannot be called Federal. The framers rejected the Australian model, and\r\nwent much beyond the Canadian model in centralizing authority and\r\ndiminishing local autonomy; nor can there be any doubt that the\r\nstrongest motive behind that policy was that of securing the harmony of\r\nthe two white races.\r\n\r\nAll this was the result of trusting the Dutch in 1906. \"We cannot expect\r\nyou to trust us, and we shall not trust you,\" said the despatch of 1905.\r\nWe know what the consequences of that policy would have been. It is not\r\na question of imagination or hypothesis. It is a question of the\r\noperation of certain unchanging laws in the conduct of all white men.\r\nGood or bad, our government would have been detested. We should have\r\nmanufactured sedition, lawlessness, and discord. Then the tendency would\r\nhave been strong to follow the old Irish precedent, and make the evil\r\nsymptoms we had ourselves educed the pretext for tightening the screw of\r\nanti-popular government. It would have been said that we must sustain\r\nour prestige to the end and at all costs, a phrase which often cloaks\r\nthe obstinacy of moral cowardice. Or, too late to escape the contempt of\r\nthe Boers, we might have abruptly surrendered to clamour. It would have\r\ntaken a long time to reach union then. Contempt is a bad foundation.\r\n\r\nIt brings one near despair to see the Union of South Africa used by men\r\nwho should know better as an argument against Irish Home Rule. The chain\r\nof causation is so clear, one would think, as to be incapable of\r\nmisconstruction. But there seems to be no limit in certain minds to the\r\nprejudice against the principle of Home Rule. If it is seen to work\r\nwell, the phenomenon is hurriedly swept into oblivion, and its results\r\nattributed with feverish ingenuity to any cause but the true one. The\r\nvery speed with which the antidote pervades the body politic and expels\r\nthe old poison helps these untiring propagators of error to suppress the\r\nhistory of recuperation, and to ascribe the cure of the patient to a\r\ntreatment which, if applied long enough, would have killed him. The\r\nConservative party appear to have now reached this amazing conclusion:\r\nthat they and Lord Milner were the authors of the South African Union,\r\nand that that Union is a weapon sent them by Providence for combating\r\nthe Irish claims. This is what Ireland has to pay for being the sport of\r\nBritish parties. Individual statesmen may point at past mistakes; but a\r\nparty, as a party, can never admit error: it is against the rules. To\r\nmake things easier, there is that question-begging phrase, the \"Union.\"\r\nIf South Africa, like Australia, had been federalized, this windfall\r\nwould have been lost, because the word \"Federal\" might have suggested\r\nsome form of Federal Home Rule for Ireland. Labels mean an enormous\r\namount in politics.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt that Mr. Walter Long, and even Lord\r\nSelborne, who, as High Commissioner, actually witnessed the whole\r\nevolution from responsible government in the two conquered States to the\r\nUnion of South Africa, are perfectly sincere in their opposition to\r\nIrish Home Rule. But, I would respectfully suggest, it is their duty to\r\nuse their knowledge and convictions in the right and fair way. Let them\r\nsay, if they will, ignoring the intermediate and indispensable phase of\r\nHome Rule in South Africa: \"Here are two Unions; never mind how they\r\narose. Both are good: all Unions are good. The modern tendency to unify\r\nis sound; do not let us react to devolution.\" Let them, in other words,\r\nconfine their argument to the domain of political science. What, I\r\nsubmit, they should refrain from, is the imputation of sordid motives to\r\nNationalist leaders, the prognostications of religious and racial\r\ntyranny in Ireland, and all those inflammatory arguments against the\r\nprinciple of Home Rule which have been used all the world over, from\r\ntime immemorial, for the maintenance of Unions based on legal, not on\r\nmoral, ties, which were used against responsible government for the\r\nTransvaal, and which, I venture to affirm, degrade our public life.\r\n\r\nI am assuming for the moment that most Conservatives will elect to use\r\nthe South African parallel in the way that Mr. Long and Lord Selborne\r\nhave used it, that is, while tacitly approving in retrospect of the Home\r\nRule of 1906, to argue from Union to Union. But it is of no use to blink\r\nthe fact that there are pessimists who will put forward an antithetical\r\ncase, boldly declaring that we were wrong ever to trust the Boers, that\r\nracialism is as bad as ever, that General Botha's loyalty is cant, the\r\nCullinan diamond an insult, and that South Africa will go from bad to\r\nworse under a Dutch tyranny. Party propaganda is quite elastic enough to\r\npermit the two opposite views to be used to convince the same electorate\r\nat the same election. Pessimists are always active in these affairs, and\r\nthey can always produce something in the nature of a plausible case,\r\nbecause it stands to reason that the evils of generations cannot be\r\nswept away in a moment, either in South Africa or Ireland. Miracles do\r\nnot happen, and the pessimists, who are the curse of Ireland to-day,\r\nwill be able to demonstrate with ease that the free Ireland of to-morrow\r\nwill not enter instantaneously upon a millennium. It is useless to\r\nattempt to convert these extremists. For a century back, Hansard and the\r\ncolumns of daily papers have been full of their unfulfilled jeremiads\r\nabout Canada, about Australia, and about the very smallest and most\r\ntardy attempts to give a little responsibility to the majority of\r\ncitizens in Ireland. The vocabulary of impending ruin has been exhausted\r\nlong ago; there is nothing new to be said. But those who care to study\r\nin a cool temper the course of recent South African politics in the\r\ncolumns of the _Times_, or, better still, in those of that excellent\r\nmagazine for the discussion of Imperial affairs, the _Round Table_, will\r\nconclude that extraordinary progress has been made towards racial\r\nreunion, and that in this respect no serious peril threatens South\r\nAfrica. The settlement, by friendly compromise at the end of the last\r\nsession, of the very thorny question of language in the education of\r\nchildren, is a good example of what good-will can accomplish under free\r\ninstitutions. By a laboured construction of fragments of speeches culled\r\nfrom the utterances of exceptionally vehement partisans, it would be\r\nstill possible to make up a theory of the \"disloyalty\" of the South\r\nAfrican Dutch. It would have been equally possible for a painstaking\r\nBritish student of the _Sydney Bulletin_ within recent memory to start a\r\npanic over the imminent \"loss\" of Australia. Some people think that\r\nCanada is as good as \"lost\" now. Yet the Empire has never been so strong\r\nor so united as to-day.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Cd. 2479, 1905.\r\n\r\n[36] Cd. 2400, 1905.\r\n\r\n[37] \"It is true that in the case of Canada full responsible government\r\nwas conceded, a few years after a troublous period culminating in a\r\nbrief armed rising, to a population composed of races then not very\r\nfriendly to each other, though now long since happily reconciled. But\r\nthe Canadas had by that time enjoyed representative institutions for\r\nover fifty years, the French-Canadians had since the year 1763 been\r\ncontinuously British subjects, and the disorders which preceded Lord\r\nDurham's Mission and the subsequent grant of self-government could not\r\ncompare in any way with a war like that of 1899-1902. It is also the\r\nfact that in the United Colony of Upper and Lower Canada, during the\r\nperiod of 1840-1867, parties were formed mainly upon the lines of races,\r\nand that, as the representatives of the races were in number nearly\r\nbalanced, stability of Government was not attained, a difficulty which\r\nwas not overcome until the Federation of 1867, accompanied by the\r\nrelegation of provincial affairs to provincial Legislatures, placed the\r\nwhole political Constitution of Canada upon a wider basis.\"\r\n\r\nFew would gather from the first sentence that the races were \"not very\r\nfriendly to each other\" precisely because they lived under a coercive\r\npolitical system; and that, in the long-run, they were \"happily\r\nreconciled\" because they received responsible government. Nor could it\r\nbe deduced from the obscure reference lower down to the union of the two\r\nProvinces that the Union was the one blot upon Durham's scheme, the one\r\npoint in which, fearing the predominance of a French majority in Lower\r\nCanada, he shrank from his own principles and recommended an unworkable\r\nUnion which tended to encourage the formation \"of parties on the lines\r\nof races.\" From the further allusion to the Federal Union of 1867, no\r\none would imagine that that great scheme was founded on a cessation of\r\nracial antipathy inside the Quebec Province, and on a voluntary\r\nrecognition among all races and parties that it was best for that\r\nProvince to have a local autonomy of its own, parallel with that of the\r\nOntario Province and under the supreme central authority of the\r\nDominion.\r\n\r\n[38] February 26, March 27, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ANALOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the reader endeavour to see the closely related stories of Ireland\r\nand of these more distant communities as a whole, undistracted by the\r\nvarying degrees of their proximity to the Mother Country, making his\r\nstudy one of men and laws, and remembering that Ireland was the first\r\nand nearest of the British Colonies. Does not she become a convex\r\nmirror, in which, swollen to unnatural proportions, the mistakes of two\r\ncenturies are reflected? Principles of government universal in their\r\nnature, transcending geography, and painfully evolved in more distant\r\nparts of the Empire, we have thrown to the winds in Ireland. Economic\r\nevils, resembling, in however distant a degree, those of Ireland, have\r\nirritated and retarded every community in which they have been allowed\r\nto take root. A sound agrarian system has been the primary need of every\r\ncountry. To take the closest parallel, if absentee proprietorship and\r\ninsecurity of tenure kept little Prince Edward Island, peacefully and\r\nlegally settled, backward and disturbed for a century, it is not\r\nsurprising that Ireland, submitted to confiscation, the Penal Code, and\r\ncommercial rum, did not flourish under a land system beside which that\r\nof Prince Edward Island was a paradise. Tardy redress of the worst Irish\r\nabuses is no defence of the system which created them and sustained them\r\nwith such ruinous results. No white community of pride and spirit would\r\nwillingly tolerate the grotesque form of Crown Colony administration,\r\nfounded on force, and now tempered by a kind of paternal State\r\nSocialism, under which Ireland lives to-day. Unionism for Ireland is\r\nanti-Imperialist. Its upholders strenuously opposed colonial autonomy,\r\nand but yesterday were passionately opposing South African autonomy.\r\nTo-day colonial autonomy is an axiom. But Ireland is a measure of the\r\ndepth of these convictions. There would be no Empire to idealize if\r\ntheir Irish principles had been applied just a little longer to any of\r\nthe oversea States which constitute the self-governing Colonies of\r\nto-day. As it is, these principles have wrought great and perhaps\r\nlasting mischief which, in the righteous glow of self-congratulation\r\nupon what we are accustomed to call our constructive political genius,\r\nwe are too apt to overlook. It was bad for America to pass through that\r\nphase of agitation and discord which preceded the revolutionary war. It\r\nwas demoralizing for the Canadas to be driven into rebellion by the\r\nvices of ascendancy government. Mr. Gladstone, speaking of Australian\r\nautonomy, was right in satirizing the \"miserable jargon\" about fitting\r\nmen for political privileges, and in demonstrating the harm done by\r\nwithholding those privileges. And the Irish race all over the world,\r\nfine race as it is, would be finer still if Ireland had been free.\r\n\r\nThe political habits formed in dealing with Ireland have disastrously\r\ninfluenced Imperial policy in the past. Cannot we, by a supreme national\r\neffort, reverse the mental process, and, if we have always failed in the\r\npast to learn from Irish lessons how not to treat the Colonies, at any\r\nrate learn, even at the eleventh hour, from our colonial lessons how to\r\ntreat Ireland? Must we for ever sound the old alarms about \"disloyalty\"\r\nand \"dismemberment\" and \"abandonment of the loyal minority to the tender\r\nmercies of their foes\"; phrases as old as the Stamp Act of 1765? Must we\r\ncarry the \"gentle art of making enemies,\" practised to the last point of\r\ndanger in the Colonies, to the preposterous pitch of estranging men at\r\nour very doors, while pluming ourselves on the friendship of peoples\r\n12,000 miles away? These are anxious times. We have a mighty rival in\r\nEurope, and we need the co-operation of all our hands and brains. On a\r\nbasis of mere profit and loss, is it sensible to maintain a system in\r\nIreland which weakens both Ireland and the whole United Kingdom, clogs\r\nthe delicate machinery of Parliamentary government, and, worked out in\r\nhard figures of pounds, shillings, and pence, has ceased even to show a\r\npecuniary advantage?\r\n\r\nHave Unionists really no better prescription for the constitutional\r\ndifficulties caused by the Union than to reduce the representation of\r\nIreland in Parliament so as to give Ireland still less control than at\r\npresent over her own affairs? Is that seriously their last word in\r\nstatesmanship, to exasperate Nationalist Ireland without even providing\r\nin any appreciable degree a mechanical remedy for disordered political\r\nfunctions? The idea has only to be stated to be dismissed. It is not\r\neven practical politics. Some things are sheer impossibilities; and to\r\nleave the Union system as it is, while reducing representation, is one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nWe revert, then, to a contemplation of the well-tried expedient, \"Trust,\r\nand you will be trusted.\" But then we have to meet pessimists of two\r\ndescriptions, the honest and the merely cynical. The honest pessimist\r\n(often, unhappily, an educated Irishman) says: \"The Irish in Ireland are\r\nan incurably criminal race. They differ from Irishmen elsewhere and from\r\nAnglo-Saxons everywhere. Air and soil are unaccountable. The Union\r\npolicy has been, and remains, a painful but a quite inevitable\r\nnecessity. It is sound, now and for all time.\" The cynical pessimist, on\r\nthe other hand, admits the errors of past policy, but says frankly that\r\nit is too late to change. \"We have gone too far, raised passions we\r\ncannot allay.\" I shall not try further to confute the honest pessimist.\r\nThe preceding chapters have been written in vain if they do not shatter\r\nthe theory of original sin. And to the cynical pessimist, who is a\r\nreincarnation of our old friend Fitzgibbon (for that clear-headed\r\nstatesman frankly imputed original sin to the conquerors of Ireland, as\r\nwell as to the conquered), I would only say: \"Use your common sense.\"\r\nThese panics over the vagaries and excesses of an Irish Parliament,\r\nalways groundless, are beginning to look highly ridiculous. In 1893,\r\nwhen the last Home Rule Bill was being discussed, a Franco-Irish\r\nalliance was the fear. Now it is the other way, and the _Spectator_ has\r\nbeen writing solemn articles to warn its readers that Mr. Dillon, in a\r\nspeech on foreign policy, has shown ominous signs of hostility to\r\nFrance. In the election of January, 1910, an ex-Cabinet Minister\r\ninformed the public that Home Rule meant the presence of a German fleet\r\nin Belfast Lough--at whose invitation he did not explain, though he\r\nprobably did not intend to insult Ulster. This wild talk has not even\r\nthe merit of a strategical foundation. It belongs to another age.\r\nIreland has neither a fleet nor the will or money to build one. Our\r\nfleet, in which large numbers of Irishmen serve, guarantees the security\r\nof New Zealand, and if it cannot maintain the command of home waters,\r\nincluding St. George's Channel, our situation is desperate, whether\r\nIreland is friendly or hostile. We guarantee the independent existence\r\nof the kingdom of Belgium, which is as near as Ireland, with military\r\nliabilities vastly more serious than any which Ireland could conceivably\r\nentail; but we do not claim, as a consequence, to control the Executive\r\nof Belgium and remove her Parliament to Westminster, in order to be\r\nquite sure that the Belgians are not intriguing against us with Germany.\r\nGermany, our alarmists fear, is to invade Ireland, and Ireland is to\r\ngreet the invaders with open arms. The same prophecy was being made not\r\nmore than three years ago of the South African Dutch. After asking for a\r\ncentury and a half to manage her own affairs, the Irish are not likely\r\nto ask to be ruled by Germans. The German strategists are men of common\r\nsense. If they were fortunate enough to gain the command of the sea,\r\nthey could make no worse mistake than to dissipate their energies on\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is a waste of time to attempt to destroy these foolish myths.\r\nLet those that are sceptical about the effect of Home Rule in producing\r\nfriendlier feelings between Ireland and Great Britain consider in a\r\nreasonable spirit the commonplace question of mutual interests. What is\r\nthe really practical significance of Ireland's proximity to England?\r\nThis, that their material interests are indissociably intertwined. If it\r\nis \"safe,\" as the phrase goes, to entrust Australia with Home Rule,\r\nsurely it is safer still to entrust Ireland with it. Has Ireland\r\nanything to gain by separation? Clearly nothing. Has she anything to\r\nlose? Much. Most of her trade is with Great Britain. British credit is\r\nof enormous value to her. The Imperial forces are of less proportionate\r\nvalue to her because her external trade is small; but she willingly\r\nsupplies a large and important part of their personnel; she shares in\r\ntheir glorious traditions; and if it is a case of protection for her\r\ntrade, she will get no protection elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHow idle are these calculations of profit and loss! The truth is that\r\nIreland has taken her full share in winning and populating the Empire.\r\nThe result is hers as much as Britain's. Mr. Redmond spoke for his\r\ncountrymen last May[39] in saying: \"We, as Irishmen, are not prepared to\r\nsurrender our share in the heritage [that is, the British Empire] which\r\nour fathers created.\" That is sound sentiment and sound sense. It is the\r\nview taken by the Colonies, where Irishmen are known, respected, and\r\nunderstood, and where the support for Home Rule, based on personal\r\nexperience of its blessings, has been, and remains, consistent and\r\nstrong. Indeed, we miss the significance of that support if we do not\r\nrealize that Irish Home Rule is an indispensable preliminary to the\r\ncloser union of the various parts of the Empire. Let us add the wider\r\ngeneralization that it is an indispensable preliminary to the closer\r\nunion of all the English-speaking races. It may be fairly computed that\r\na fifth of the present white population of the United States is of Irish\r\nblood.[40] American opinion, as a whole, so far as it is directed\r\ntowards Ireland and away from a host of absorbing domestic problems, is\r\nfavourable to Home Rule. Irish-American opinion has never swerved,\r\nalthough it has become more sober, as the material condition of Ireland\r\nhas improved, and the interests of Irish-Americans themselves have\r\nbecome more closely identified with those of their adopted country.\r\nFenianism is altogether extinct. The extreme claim for the total\r\nseparation of Ireland from Great Britain is now no more than a\r\nsentimental survival among a handful of the older men, of the fierce\r\nhatreds provoked by the miseries and horrors of an era which has passed\r\naway.[41] Even Mr. Patrick Ford and the _Irish World_ have moderated\r\ntheir tone, and where that tone is still inflammatory it is not\r\nrepresentative of Irish-American opinion. I have studied with a good\r\ndeal of care the columns of that journal for some months back, smiling\r\nover the imaginary terrors of the nervous people on this side of the\r\nAtlantic who are taught by their party Press to believe that Mr. Patrick\r\nFord is going to dynamite them in their beds. Any liberal-minded student\r\nof history and human nature would pronounce the whole propaganda\r\nperfectly harmless. But the sane instinct that Ireland should have a\r\nlocal autonomy of her own, an instinct common to the whole brotherhood\r\nof nations which have sprung from these shores, lasts undiminished and\r\ntakes shape, quite rightly and naturally, as it takes shape in the\r\nColonies, in financial support of the Nationalist party in Ireland.\r\nAnti-British sentiment in the United States, once a grave international\r\ndanger, is that no longer; but it does still represent an obstacle to\r\nthe complete realization of an ideal which all patriotic men should aim\r\nat: the formation of indestructible bonds of friendship between Great\r\nBritain and the United States. Nor must it be forgotten that the calm\r\nand reasonable character of Irish-American opinion is due in a large\r\ndegree to confidence in the ultimate success of the constitutional\r\nmovement here for Home Rule. Every successive defeat of that policy\r\ntends to embitter feeling in America.\r\n\r\nOh, for an hour of intelligent politics! The old choice is before us--to\r\nmake the best or the worst of the state of opinion in America; to\r\ndisinter from ancient files of the _Irish World_ sentences calculated to\r\ninflame an ignorant British audience; or to say in sensible and manly\r\nterms: \"The situation is more favourable than it has been for a century\r\npast for the settlement of just Irish claims.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] At Woodford, May 27, 1911.\r\n\r\n[40] This is a very general statement. No figures exist for an accurate\r\ncomputation. The Census of 1910 gives the total population of the United\r\nStates, white and coloured, as 91,272,266, of whom nearly 9,000,000 are\r\nnegroes. The figures about countries of origin are not yet available.\r\nThe statistical abstract of the United States (1908) gives the total\r\nnumber of immigrants from Ireland from 1821 to 1908 as 4,168,747 (the\r\nlarge majority of whom must have been of marriageable age), but does not\r\nestimate the subsequent increase by marriage, and takes no account of\r\nthe immigration prior to 1821, which was very large, especially in the\r\nperiod preceding the Revolutionary War of 1775-1782. At the Census of\r\n1900 Irishmen actually _born in Ireland_ and then resident in the United\r\nStates are stated to have been 1,618,567, as compared with 93,682 from\r\nWales, 233,977 from Scotland, and 842,078 from England.\r\n\r\n[41] I am especially indebted for information to Mr. Hugh Sutherland, of\r\nthe _North American_ (Philadelphia), to Mr. Rodman Wanamaker, of the\r\nsame city, to Mr. Frank Sanborn, of Concord, and to Mr. John\r\nO'Callaghan, of Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIRELAND TO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy does present-day Ireland need Home Rule? I put the question in that\r\nway because I am not going to question the fact that she wants Home\r\nRule. She has always said she wanted it: she says so still, and that is\r\nenough. There is a powerful minority in Ireland against Home Rule. There\r\nalways have been minorities more or less powerful against Home Rule in\r\nall ages and places. That does not alter the national character of the\r\nclaim. If once we go behind the voice of a people, constitutionally\r\nexpressed, we court endless risks. National leaders have always been\r\ncalled \"agitators,\" which, of course, they are, and non-representative\r\nagitators, which they are not. To deny the genuineness of a claim which\r\nis feared is an invariable feature of oppositions to measures of Home\r\nRule. The denial is generally irreconcilable with the case made for the\r\ndangers of Home Rule, and that contradiction in its most glaring shape\r\ncharacterizes the present opposition to the Irish claims. But Unionists\r\nshould elect to stand on one ground or the other, and for my part I\r\nshall assume that the large majority of Irishmen, as shown by successive\r\nelectoral votes, want Home Rule. Precisely what form of Home Rule they\r\nwant is another and by no means so clear a matter, on which I shall\r\npresently have a word to say. But they want, in the general sense, to\r\nmanage their own local affairs. Her best friends would despair of\r\nIreland if that was not her desire.\r\n\r\nWhat, in the Colonies, Ireland, and everywhere else, is the deep\r\nspiritual impulse behind the desire for Home Rule? A craving for\r\nself-expression, self-reliance. Home Rule is synonymous with the growth\r\nof independent character. That is why Ireland instinctively and\r\npassionately wants it, that is why she needs it, and that is why Great\r\nBritain, for her own sake, and Ireland's, should give it. If that is not\r\nthe reason, it is idle to talk about Home Rule; but it is the reason.\r\n\r\nCharacter is the very foundation of national prosperity and happiness,\r\nand we are blind to the facts of history if we cannot discern the\r\nprofound effect of political institutions upon human character.\r\nSelf-government in the community corresponds to free will in the\r\nindividual. I am far from saying that self-government is everything. But\r\nI do say that it is the master-key. It is fundamental. Give\r\nresponsibility and you will create responsibility. Through political\r\nresponsibility only can a society brace itself to organized effort, find\r\nout its own opinions on its own needs, test its own capabilities, and\r\nelicit the will, the brains, and the hands to solve its own problems.\r\n\r\nThese are such commonplaces in every other part of the Empire, which has\r\nan individual life of its own, that men smile if you suggest the\r\ncontrary. But ordinary reasoning is rarely applied to Ireland. There\r\n\"good government\" has been held to be \"a substitute for self-government\"\r\nand a régime of benevolent paternalism to be a full and sufficient\r\ncompensation for cruel coercion and crueller neglect. In this paternal\r\nrégime it is impossible to include those great measures of land reform\r\npassed in 1870, 1881, and 1887, which revolutionized the agrarian\r\nsystem, and converted the cottier tenant into a judicial tenant.[42]\r\nAlthough these measures, which fall into an altogether different\r\ncategory from the subsequent policy of State-aided Land Purchase,[43]\r\nwere inspired by an earnest desire to mitigate frightful social evils,\r\nthey cannot be regarded as voluntary. They were extorted, shocking as\r\nthe reflection is, by crime and violence, by the spectacle of a whole\r\nsocial order visibly collapsing, and by the desperate efforts of a\r\nhandful of Irishmen, determined at any cost, by whatever means, to save\r\nthe bodies and souls of their countrymen. The methods of these men were\r\ndestructive. They were constructive only in this, the highest sense of\r\nall, that while battling against concrete economic evils, they sought to\r\nobtain for Ireland the right to control her own affairs and cure her own\r\neconomic evils. It is often said that Parnell gave a tremendous impetus\r\nto the Home Rule movement by harnessing it to the land question. True;\r\nbut what a strange way of expressing a truth! Anywhere outside Ireland\r\nmen would say that self-government was the best road to the reform of a\r\nbad land system.\r\n\r\nWith the tranquillity which was slowly restored by the alterations in\r\nagrarian tenure and the immense economic relief derived from the\r\nlowering of rents, a change came over the spirit of British\r\nstatesmanship. With the exception of the short Liberal Government of\r\n1892-1895, which failed for the second time to carry Home Rule,\r\nConservatives were responsible for Ireland from 1886 to 1905. They felt\r\nthat opposition to Home Rule could be justified only by a strenuous\r\npolicy of amelioration in Ireland, and the efforts of three Chief\r\nSecretaries, Mr. Arthur Balfour, Mr. Gerald Balfour, and Mr. George\r\nWyndham--efforts often made in the teeth of bitter opposition from Irish\r\nUnionists--to carry out this policy, were sincere and earnest. The Act\r\nof 1891, with its grants for light railways, its additional facilities\r\nfor Land Purchase, and its establishment of the Congested Districts\r\nBoard to deal with the terrible poverty of certain districts in the\r\nwest, may be said to mark the beginning of the new era. The Land Act of\r\n1896 was another step, and the establishment of a complete system of\r\nIrish Local Government in 1898 another. In the following year came the\r\nAct setting up the Department of Agriculture, and in 1903 Mr. Wyndham's\r\ngreat Land Purchase Act. Then came the strange \"devolutionist\" episode,\r\narising from the appointment of Sir Antony (now Lord) MacDonnell to the\r\npost of Under-Secretary at Dublin Castle, the Government who selected\r\nhim being fully aware that he was in favour of some change in the\r\ngovernment of Ireland. He entered into relations with a group of\r\nprominent Irishmen, headed by Lord Dunraven, who were thinking out a\r\nscheme for a mild measure of devolution. When the fact became known,\r\nthere was an explosion of anger among Irish Unionists. Mr. Wyndham, who\r\nhad been a popular Chief Secretary, resigned office, and was succeeded\r\nby Mr. Walter Long; perhaps the most dramatic and significant example in\r\nmodern times of the policy of governing Ireland in deliberate and direct\r\ndefiance of the wishes and sentiments of the vast majority of Irishmen.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Government of 1906, coming into office under a pledge to\r\nrefrain from a full Home Rule measure, confined itself to the\r\nintroduction of the Irish Council Bill of 1907, which, rightly, in my\r\nopinion, was repudiated by the Irish people, and accordingly dropped.\r\nBut the Government was in general sympathy with Nationalist Ireland, so\r\nthat a number of useful measures were added to the statute books; for\r\nexample, the Labourers (Ireland) Act of 1906, empowering Rural Councils,\r\nwith the aid of State credit, to acquire land for labourers' plots and\r\ncottages; the Town Tenants Act, extending the principle of compensation\r\nfor improvements at the termination of a lease to the urban tenant; the\r\nvery important Irish Universities Act of 1908, which gave to Roman\r\nCatholics facilities for higher education which they had lacked for\r\ncenturies, and, lastly, Mr. Birrell's Land Act of 1909, which was\r\ndesigned partly to meet the imminent collapse of Land Purchase, owing to\r\nthe failure of the financial arrangements made under the Wyndham Act of\r\n1903, and partly to extend the powers of the Congested Districts Board.\r\n\r\nTo these measures must be added another which was not confined to\r\nIreland, but which has exercised a most potent influence, and by no\r\nmeans a wholly beneficial influence, on Irish life and Irish finance,\r\nthe Old Age Pensions Act of 1908, under which the enormous sum of two\r\nand three-quarter millions is now allocated to Ireland.[44]\r\n\r\nThe best that can be said of the legislation since 1881 is that it has\r\nlaid the foundations of a new social order. Agrarian crime has\r\ndisappeared and material prosperity has greatly increased. Government in\r\nthe interests of a small favoured class has almost vanished. It survives\r\nto this extent, that civil administration and patronage, which are\r\nstill, be it remembered, removed from popular control, remain, in fact,\r\nin Protestant and Unionist hands to an extent altogether\r\ndisproportionate to the distribution of creeds, classes, and opinions.\r\nAnd, of course, in the major matter of Home Rule, the power of the\r\nUnionist minority, as represented in the Commons by seventeen out of the\r\nthirty-three Ulster representatives, and in the House of Lords by an\r\noverwhelming preponderance of Unionist peers, is still enormous. But\r\nwithin Ireland itself, central administration apart, the exceptional\r\nprivileges and exceptional political power of Protestants and landlords,\r\nwhich lasted almost intact until forty years ago, is now non-existent.\r\nThe Disestablishment Act of 1869, while immensely enhancing the moral\r\npower and religious zeal of the Church of Ireland, and even\r\nstrengthening its financial position, took away its political monopoly,\r\nand through the final abolition of tithes, its baneful and irritating\r\ninterference with economic life. The successive measures of land\r\nlegislation, culminating in the transfer of half the land of Ireland\r\nfrom landlord to peasant proprietorship, and the Local Government Act of\r\n1898, surrendering at a stroke the whole local administration of the\r\ncountry into popular control, destroyed the exceptional political\r\nprivileges of the landlord class.\r\n\r\nAscendancy, then, in the old sense, is a thing of the past. What has\r\ntaken its place? What is the ruling power within Ireland? Is it a public\r\nopinion derived from the vital contact of ideas and interests, and\r\ntaking shape in a healthy and normal distribution of parties? Is thought\r\nfree? Has merit its reward? Is there any unity of national purpose,\r\ntranscending party divisions? If it were necessary to give a categorical\r\n\"Yes\" or \"No\" to these questions, the answer would be \"No.\" Sane\r\nenergizing politics, and the sovereign ascendancy of a sane public\r\nopinion, are absolutely unattainable in Ireland or anywhere else without\r\nHome Rule. It is all the more to the credit of Irishmen that, in the\r\nface of stupendous difficulties, and in a marvellously short space of\r\ntime since the attainment, barely twenty years ago, of the elementary\r\nconditions of social peace, they have gone so far as they have gone\r\ntowards the creation of a self-reliant, independently thinking, united\r\nIreland. The whole weight of Imperial authority has been thrown into the\r\nscale against them. Whatever the mood and policy of British upholders of\r\nthe Union, whether sympathetic or hostile, wise or foolish, their\r\nconstant message to both parties in Ireland has been, \"Look to us. Trust\r\nin us. You are divided. We are umpires,\" and the reader will no doubt\r\nremember that the theory of \"umpirage\" was used in exactly the same way\r\nin the Colonies, notably in Upper Canada,[45] to thwart the tendency\r\ntowards a reconciliation of creeds, races, and classes. Fortunately,\r\nthere have been Irishmen who have laboured to counteract the effects of\r\nthis enervating policy, and to reconstruct, by native effort from\r\nwithin, a new Ireland on the ruins of the old. Whether or not they have\r\nconsciously aimed at Home Rule matters not a particle. Some have, some\r\nhave not; but the result of these efforts has been the same, to pull\r\nIrishmen together and to begin the creation of a genuinely national\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt is not part of my scheme to describe in detail the various movements,\r\nagricultural, industrial, economic, literary, political, which in the\r\nlast twenty years have contributed to this national revival. Some have a\r\nworld-wide fame, all have been excellently described at one time or\r\nanother by writers of talent and insight.[46] My purpose is to note\r\ntheir characteristics and progress, and to estimate their political\r\nsignificance. In the first place it must be remembered that some of the\r\nmost important of the modern legislative measures have been initiated\r\nand promoted by Home Rulers and Unionists, Roman Catholics and\r\nProtestants, acting in friendly co-operation and throwing aside their\r\npolitical and religious antagonisms. Such was the origin of the great\r\nLand Purchase Act of 1903, which Mr. Wyndham drafted on the basis of an\r\nagreement reached at a friendly conference of landlords and\r\nrepresentatives of tenants. But a far more interesting and hopeful\r\ninstance of co-operation had taken place seven years earlier. One of the\r\nvery few really constructive measures of the last twenty years, the Act\r\nof 1899 for setting up the Department of Agriculture and Technical\r\nInstruction, was the direct outcome of the recommendations of the Recess\r\nCommittee brought together in 1895 and 1896 by Sir Horace Plunkett; a\r\nCommittee containing Nationalist and Unionist Members of the House of\r\nCommons, Tory and Liberal Unionist peers, Ulster captains of industry,\r\nthe Grand Master of the Belfast Orangemen, and an eminent Jesuit.[47] In\r\nits reunion of men divided by bitter feuds, it was just the kind of\r\nConference that assembled in Durban in 1908, six years after a\r\ndevastating war, to discuss and to create the framework of South African\r\nUnion. That Conference was the natural outcome of the grant of Home Rule\r\nto the defeated Boer States. The Irish Conference, succeeding a land-war\r\nfar more destructive and demoralizing, was brought together in spite of\r\nthe absence of Home Rule, and the prejudice it had to overcome,[48] is a\r\nmeasure of the fantastically abnormal conditions produced by the denial\r\nof self-government. There lay Ireland, an island with a rich soil and a\r\nclever population, yet terribly backward, far behind England, far behind\r\nall the progressive nations of Europe in agriculture and industry, her\r\npopulation declining, her land passing out of cultivation,[49] her\r\nstrongest sons and daughters hurrying away to enrich with their wits and\r\nsinews distant lands. There, in short, lay a country groaning for\r\nintelligent development by the concentrated energies of her own people.\r\n\r\n\"We have in Ireland,\" runs the first paragraph of the Report of the\r\nCommittee, \"a poor country practically without manufactures--except for\r\nthe linen and shipbuilding of the north, and the brewing and distilling\r\nof Dublin--dependent upon agriculture, with its soil imperfectly tilled,\r\nits area under cultivation decreasing, and a diminishing population\r\nwithout industrial habits or technical skill.\"\r\n\r\nThe leeway to make up was enormous. To go no farther back than the\r\ninstitution of the Penal Code and the deliberate destruction of the\r\nwoollen industry, two centuries of callous repression at the hands of an\r\nexternal authority had maimed and exhausted the country whose condition\r\nthe Committee had met to consider. These facts the members of the\r\nCommittee frankly recognized in that part of the Report which is\r\nentitled with gentle irony \"Past Action of the State.\" Here, then, was a\r\npurely Irish problem, intimately concerning every Irishman, poor or\r\nrich, Roman Catholic or Protestant, a problem of which Great Britain,\r\nthough responsible both for its existence and its solution, knew and\r\ncared little. The really strange thing is, not that representative\r\nIrishmen should have met together to consider and prescribe for the\r\ndeplorable economic condition of their country, but that they should not\r\nalso, like the South African Conference, have drafted a Constitution for\r\nIreland, on the sound ground that a system of government which had\r\npromoted and sustained the evils they described could never, with the\r\nbest will in the world, become a good government for Ireland. Yet for a\r\nbrief space of time these men actually had Home Rule, and by virtue of\r\nthat privilege they did better work for Ireland in six months than had\r\nbeen done in two centuries.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, they used the Home Rule principle in their recommendations\r\nfor the establishment of a Department of Agriculture and Technical\r\nInstruction. \"We think it essential,\" they reported on p. 101, \"that the\r\nnew Department should be in touch with the public opinion of the classes\r\nwhom its work concerns, and should rely largely for its success upon\r\ntheir active assistance and co-operation.\" Its chief, they added, should\r\nbe a Minister directly responsible to Parliament, and on p. 103 they\r\nadvocated a Consultative Council, whose functions should be--(1) To keep\r\nthe Department in direct touch with the public opinion of those classes\r\nwhom the work of the Ministry concerns; and (2) to distribute some of\r\nthe responsibility for administration amongst those classes. Now these,\r\nin Ireland, were revolutionary proposals. The idea of any part of the\r\nGovernment \"being in touch with public opinion\" was wholly new. The idea\r\nof \"distributing responsibility for administration\" amongst the subjects\r\nof administration was startlingly novel. Ireland, both before and after\r\nthe Union, had always been governed on a diametrically opposite\r\nprinciple. Since the Union, when Irish departmental Ministers, never\r\nresponsible to the people, disappeared, not one of the host of nominated\r\nIrish Boards was legally amenable to Irish public opinion. Not one had\r\na separate Minister responsible even to the Parliament at Westminster,\r\nwhich was not an Irish Parliament. _A fortiori_, not one relied on the\r\nco-operation and advice of the classes for whose benefit it was supposed\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nProposed, nevertheless, by a group of representative Irishmen, the\r\nscheme for a democratically constituted Department of Agriculture passed\r\nsmoothly into law as soon as the machinery for ascertaining public\r\nopinion on the matters at issue had been brought into existence. Mr.\r\nGerald Balfour, the Chief Secretary, was engaged at the time upon his\r\nmeasure for the extension of Local Government to Ireland. This measure\r\nbecame law in 1898, and the Department Act in 1899. Under that Act, the\r\nduty was laid upon each of the new County Councils of electing two\r\nmembers to serve upon a Consultative Council of Agriculture, to which a\r\nminority of nominated members was added, and this Council in its turn\r\nelects two-thirds of the members of an Agricultural Board, and supplies\r\nfour representatives to a Board of Technical Instruction, which, like\r\nthe Council and the Agricultural Board, has a predominantly popular\r\ncharacter.[50]\r\n\r\nAt the summit stands the Minister, or Vice-President, as he is called\r\n(for in accordance with ancient custom, the Chief Secretary is nominally\r\nin supreme control of this as of all other Irish Departments), and a\r\nlarge and efficient staff of permanent officials. He and his staff have\r\na large centralized authority, but this authority is subject to a\r\nconstitutional check in the shape of a veto wielded by the Boards over\r\nthe expenditure of the Endowment Fund. What is more important, policy\r\ntends to be shaped in accordance with popular views by the existence of\r\nthe Council and the Boards.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the germ of responsible government. At first sight a\r\ncritic might exclaim: \"Why, here is democracy pushed to a point unknown\r\neven in Great Britain, where Government Departments are wholly\r\nindependent of Local Councils.\" That is in a limited sense true, and it\r\nis quite arguable that British Departments would be the better for an\r\ninfusion of local control. But we must not be misled by a false analogy.\r\nGreat Britain reaches the Irish ideal by other means. Her departmental\r\nMinisters are directly responsible to a predominantly British House of\r\nCommons where a hostile vote can at any moment eject them from\r\noffice.[51] There is no Irish Parliament, nor any kind of predominantly\r\nIrish body which is vested with the same power. The Vice-President of\r\nthe Irish Department of Agriculture, an institution concerned\r\nexclusively with Irish affairs, whether he sits in the House of Commons\r\nor not (and for two years Mr. T.W. Russell had not a seat at\r\nWestminster), could not be ejected from office even by a unanimous vote\r\nof Irish Members of the House, with the moral backing of a unanimous\r\nIrish people.[52] That is one of the anomalous results of the Union, and\r\nit was a recognition, though rather a confused one, of this anomaly,\r\nthat inspired the ingenious compromise invented by the Recess Committee\r\nfor introducing an element of popular control. But what a light the\r\ncompromise throws on the anomaly which evoked it! Is it common sense to\r\nmake these elaborate arrangements for promoting an Irish Department on\r\nan Irish popular basis while recoiling in terror from the prospect of\r\ncrowning them with a Minister responsible to ah Irish Parliament? The\r\nconsequence is that even in this solitary example of an Irish\r\nDepartment under semi-popular control we see the subtle taint of Crown\r\nColony Government. Popular opinion, acting indirectly, first through the\r\nCouncil and then through the Boards, can legally paralyze the Department\r\nby declining to appropriate money in the way it prescribes, while\r\npossessing no legal power to enforce a different policy or change the\r\npersonnel of administration. This is only an object-lesson. I hasten to\r\nadd that such a paralysis has never taken place, though some acrimonious\r\ncontroversy, natural enough under the anomalous state of things, has\r\narisen over the office of Vice-President. There is now only one means by\r\nwhich Irish opinion can, if it be so disposed, displace the holder of\r\nthe office, and that is a thoroughly unreliable and unhealthy means,\r\nnamely, through pressure brought to bear by one or other of the Irish\r\nParliamentary parties upon a newly elected British Ministry.[53] But why\r\nin the world should the British party pendulum determine an important\r\nIrish matter like this? Why, _a fortiori_, should it determine the\r\nappointment to the office of Chief Secretary, the irresponsible Prime\r\nMinister, or, rather the autocrat of Ireland? It is the _reductio ad\r\nabsurdum_ of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Department commands a large measure of confidence. It would command\r\nfar greater confidence if it were responsible to an Irish Parliament;\r\nbut Irishmen are sensible enough to perceive that as long as the Union\r\nlasts, everyone is interested in making the existing system work\r\nsmoothly and well. The general policy as laid down in the first\r\ninstance, by the first Vice-President, Sir Horace Plunkett, has been\r\nsound and wise;[54] to proceed slowly, while building up a staff of\r\ntrained instructors, inspectors, organizers; to devote money and labour\r\nmainly to education, both industrial and agricultural, and to evoke\r\nself-reliance and initiative in the people by, so far as possible,\r\nspending money locally only where a local contribution is raised and a\r\nlocal scheme prepared. The last aim met with a fine response. Every\r\nCounty Council in Ireland raises a rate, and has a scheme for\r\nagricultural and technical instruction. I can only enumerate some of the\r\nmultifarious functions which the Department evolved for itself or took\r\nover from various other unrelated Boards and concentrated under single\r\ncontrol. It gives instruction in agriculture and rural domestic economy\r\n(horticulture, butter-making, bee-keeping, poultry-keeping, etc.)\r\nthrough schools, colleges, or agricultural stations under its own\r\ndirection, through private schools for both sexes, and through an\r\nextensive system of itinerant courses conducted (in 1909) by 128 trained\r\ninstructors. It gives premiums for the breeding of horses, cattle,\r\nasses, poultry, swine. It conducts original research, it experiments in\r\ncrops, and, among other things, is slowly resuscitating the depressed\r\nindustry of flax-growing, and starting a wholly new industry in the\r\nsouthern counties, that of early potatoes. It sprays potatoes,\r\nprescribes for the diseases of trees, crops, and stock, advises on\r\nmanures and feeding-stuffs, teaches forestry, and gives scholarships at\r\nvarious colleges for proficiency in agricultural science. On the side of\r\nTechnical Instruction it teaches and encourages all manner of small\r\nindustries, such as lace-making. It superintends all technical\r\ninstruction in secondary schools, and organizes and subsidizes similar\r\ninstruction in a multitude of different subjects under schemes prepared\r\nby local authorities, while at the same time carrying on an important\r\nand extensive system of training teachers. It also superintends\r\nsea-fisheries and improves harbours.\r\n\r\nThe material results have been great; the moral results perhaps even\r\ngreater. Just as we should expect, wherever education goes, and wherever\r\nmen work together for economic improvement, unnatural antagonisms of\r\nrace and religion tend to disappear. This is not the result of any\r\ndirect influence wielded by the Department, which never finds it\r\nnecessary to lecture people on the duty of mutual tolerance; it is the\r\nresult of common sense and a small experience in Home Rule. High\r\nofficials of the Department have informed me that their work, for all\r\nintents and purposes, is unhampered by local religious prejudices. A\r\nspirit of keen and wholesome rivalry permeates the people. County and\r\nBorough Committees in districts almost wholly Roman Catholic, with large\r\npowers of patronage, almost invariably appoint the best men, regardless\r\nof creed and local influence. Anyone who wishes to gain a glimpse of the\r\nreal Belfast of the present and the future, as distinguished from the\r\nugly, bigoted caricature of a great city which some even of its own\r\ncitizens perversely insist on displaying to their English friends, a\r\nBelfast as tolerant and generous as it is energetic and progressive,\r\nshould visit the magnificent Municipal Technical Institute, where 6,000\r\nboys and girls, Roman Catholic and Protestant, mix together on equal\r\nterms, and derive the same benefit from an extraordinary variety of\r\neducational courses in a building furnished with lecture-rooms,\r\nlaboratories, experimental plant, and gymnasia, of a perfection hardly\r\nto be surpassed in any city of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nHere is something grand and fruitful accomplished in eleven years, and\r\nit is the outcome, be it remembered, of original, constructive thought\r\ndevoted by Irishmen to the needs of their own country.\r\n\r\nLet us also remember that it represents the application of State-aid to\r\neconomic development. But with the utmost caution, and the utmost\r\nefforts to elicit self-help, one may go too far in the direction of\r\nState-aid, and even in this sphere it is by no means certain that\r\nIreland is free from danger. Let us pass to another movement whose\r\nessence is self-help: I mean the movement for Agricultural Co-operation.\r\nHere again Sir Horace Plunkett was the originator. Indeed, with him and\r\nhis able associates and advisers, of whom Lord Monteagle and Mr. R.A.\r\nAnderson, the Secretary of the I.A.O.S., were the first, the twin aims\r\nof self-help and State-aid were combined as they should be, in one big,\r\nharmonious policy. Self-help must, indeed, they held, be antecedent to,\r\nand preparatory for, State-aid. The position confronting them was that\r\nhalf a million unorganized tenant farmers, for the most part cultivating\r\nexcessively small holdings, and just beginning to emerge after\r\ngenerations of agrarian war from an economic serfdom, were face to face\r\nwith the competition of highly organized European countries, and of vast\r\nand rapidly developing territories of North and South America. It was as\r\nfar back as 1889 that the first propaganda was begun, and in 1894, a\r\nyear before the Recess Committee met, the Irish Agricultural\r\nOrganization Society was formed. By unwearied pains and patience,\r\nseemingly hopeless obstacles had been overcome, apathy, ignorance, and\r\noften contemptuous opposition from men of both political parties. For,\r\nwith that ruinous pessimism always endemic in countries not politically\r\nfree, and exactly paralleled in the Canada described by the Durham\r\nReport of 1839, extremists were inclined to suspect any movement which\r\ndrew recruits from both political camps. Nevertheless, the island is now\r\ncovered with a network of 886 co-operative societies, creameries,\r\nagricultural societies (for selling implements, foodstuffs, etc.),\r\ncredit banks, poultry societies, and other miscellaneous organizations.\r\nThe total membership is nearly 100,000, the total turnover nearly two\r\nand a half millions.[55] Nearly half the butter exported from Ireland is\r\nmade in the 392 co-operative creameries, and at the other end of the\r\nscale extraordinarily valuable work is done by the 237 agricultural\r\ncredit banks, which supply small loans, averaging only £4 apiece, for\r\nstrictly productive purposes on a system of mutual credit.\r\n\r\nMoral and material regeneration go together. The aim is to build up a\r\nnew rural civilization, to put life, heart, and hope into the monotony\r\nof country life and unite all classes in the strong bonds of sympathy\r\nand interest: a splendid ideal, applicable not to Ireland alone, but to\r\nall countries, and Ireland may truly be said to be pointing the way to\r\nmany another country, Great Britain included.\r\n\r\nThe Co-operative movement attracts the most intelligent and progressive\r\nelements of the rural population. Strictly non-political itself, it\r\nunites creeds and parties. It is as strong in predominantly Roman\r\nCatholic districts as in predominantly Protestant districts, strongest\r\nof all in Catholic Wexford. Probably two-thirds or more of the\r\nco-operators are Home Rulers, but that only accidentally reflects the\r\ndistribution of Irish parties. On the local committees political animus\r\nis unknown. The governing body contains members, lay and clerical, of\r\nall shades of opinion. Step into Plunkett House, that hospitable\r\nheadquarters of the Organization Society, and if you have been nurtured\r\nin legends about inextinguishable class and creed antipathies, which are\r\nsupposed to render Home Rule impossible and the eternal \"umpirage\" of\r\nGreat Britain inevitable, you will soon learn to marvel that anyone can\r\nbe found to propagate them. Here, just because men are working together\r\nin a practical, self-contained, home-ruled organization for the good of\r\nthe whole country, you will find liberality, open-mindedness,\r\nbrotherhood, and keen, intelligent patriotism from Ulsterman and\r\nSoutherners alike. The atmosphere is not political. But you will come\r\naway with a sense of the absurdity, of the insolence, of saying that a\r\ncountry which can produce and conduct fine movements like this is\r\n_unfit_ for self-government. I should add a word about a new\r\norganization which only came into being this year, and which also has\r\nits home at Plunkett House, the United Irishwomen, whose aim, in their\r\nown words, is to \"unite Irishwomen for the social and economic advantage\r\nof Ireland.\" \"They intend to organize the women of all classes in every\r\nrural district in Ireland for social service. These bodies will discuss,\r\nand, if need be, take action upon any and every matter which concerns\r\nthe welfare of society in their several localities. So far as women's\r\nknowledge and influence will avail, they will strive for a higher\r\nstandard of material comfort and physical well-being in the country\r\nhome, a more advanced agricultural economy, and a social existence a\r\nlittle more in harmony with the intellect and temperament of our\r\npeople.\" Anyone who wants to understand something of the spirit of the\r\nnew self-reliant Ireland which is springing up to-day should read the\r\nthrilling little pamphlet (I cannot describe it otherwise) from which I\r\nquote these words, and which introduced the United Irish-women to the\r\nworld, with its preface by Father T.A. Finlay, and its essays by Mrs.\r\nEllice Pilkington, Sir Horace Plunkett, and Mr. George W. Russell,\r\nbetter known as \"Æ,\" poet, painter, and Editor of the Co-operative\r\nweekly, the _Irish Homestead_. Nor can I leave this part of my subject\r\nwithout referring to that amazing little journal. No other newspaper in\r\nthe world that I know of bears upon it so deep an impress of genius.\r\nThere are no \"politics,\" in the Irish sense, in it. It would be\r\nimpossible to infer from its pages how the Editor voted. What fascinates\r\nthe reader is the shrewd and witty analysis of Irish problems, the high\r\nrange of vision which exposes the shortcomings and reveals the\r\nillimitable possibilities of a regenerated Ireland and the ceaseless and\r\nimplacable war waged by the Editor upon all pettiness, melancholy, and\r\npessimism.\r\n\r\nWhat the Agricultural Organization Society is doing for agriculture the\r\nIndustrial Development Associations, formed only in quite recent years,\r\nare doing, in a different way, for the encouragement of Irish\r\nindustries. The Associations of Belfast, Cork, and other cities work in\r\nharmony, and meet in an annual All-Ireland Industrial Conference. Their\r\neffort is to secure the concentration of Irish brains and capital on\r\nIrish industrial questions, to promote the sale of Irish goods, both in\r\nIreland, Great Britain, and foreign countries, and to protect these\r\ngoods against piracy and illicit competition.[56] Here again\r\nco-operation for Irish welfare brings together the creeds and races, and\r\ntends to extinguish old bigotries and antipathies. Here again the truth\r\nis recognized that Ireland is a distinct economic entity whose\r\nconditions and needs demand special study from her citizens. In a\r\ncountry of which that basal truth is recognized it would seem\r\ninexplicable that Protestants and Catholics who meet in committee-rooms\r\nand on platforms to promote, outside Parliament, the common interests of\r\nIreland, should not unite as one man to demand an Irish Legislature in\r\nwhich to focus those interests and make them the subjects of direct\r\nlegislative enactment, free both from the paternal and the coercive\r\ninterference of a country differently situated, and absorbed in its own\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nI pass from the agricultural and industrial movements to another\r\npowerful factor in the reconstruction of Ireland, namely, the Gaelic\r\nLeague, founded in 1893, whose success under the Presidency of Dr.\r\nDouglas Hyde in reviving the old national language, culture, and\r\namusements, is attracting the attention of the world. Fortunately the\r\nLeague encountered some ridicule at the outset and prospered\r\nproportionately. Some of its work is not above criticism, but few\r\npersons--and none who have the least knowledge of such intellectual\r\nrevivals elsewhere--now care to laugh at it. The League is non-political\r\nand non-sectarian. Strange, is it not, that such a movement should have\r\nto emphasize the fact? Strange paradox that in a country which is being\r\nre-born into a consciousness of its own individuality, which is\r\nregaining its own pride and self-respect, recovering its lost literature\r\nand culture, and vibrating to that \"iron string, Trust thyself,\" the\r\nconflict for self-government, that elementary symbol of self-trust,\r\nshould still retain enough intestinal bitterness to compel men to label\r\nnational movements as non-political and non-sectarian! It would be idle,\r\nof course, to pretend that this national movement, like all others in\r\nIreland, does not strengthen, especially among the younger generation,\r\nwhich grows increasingly Nationalist, the sentiment for Home Rule. If it\r\ndid not, we should indeed be in the presence of something miraculously\r\nabnormal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Celtic revival does visible good. The language is no\r\nlonger a fad; it is an envied accomplishment, a mark of distinction and\r\neducation. Wherever it goes, North and South, it obliterates race and\r\ncreed distinctions, and all the terrible memories associated with them.\r\nThere are Ulstermen of Saxon or Scottish stock in whom the fascination\r\nof Irish art and literature has extirpated every trace of Orangeism and\r\nall implied in it. The language revivifies traditions, as beautiful as\r\nthey are glorious, of an Ireland full of high passions and stormy\r\ndomestic feuds, but united in sentiment, breeding warriors, poets,\r\nlawgivers, saints, and fertilizing Europe with her missionary genius.\r\nHowever far those times are, however grim and pitiful the havoc wrought\r\nby the race war, it is nevertheless a fact for thinkers and statesmen\r\nto ponder over, not a phantasy to sneer at, that Celtic Ireland lives.\r\nAnglicization has failed, not because Celts cannot appreciate the\r\nnoblest manifestations of English genius in art, letters, science, war,\r\ncolonization, but because to repress their own culture and nationality\r\nis at the same time to repress their power of appreciation and\r\nassimilation. Until comparatively recent times, it was only the worst of\r\nEnglish literature and music, the cheapest newspaper twaddle, the\r\ninanest music-hall songs, which penetrated beyond a limited circle of\r\nculture into the life of the country. The revolt against this\r\nsterilizing and belittling side of anglicization is strong and healthy.\r\nIt affects all classes. Farmers, labourers, small tradesmen, who had\r\nnever conceived the idea of learning for learning's sake, and who had\r\ngrown up, thanks to the national system of education, in all but\r\ncomplete ignorance of their own country's history and literature, spend\r\ntime on reading and study and in the practice of the old indigenous\r\ndances and music, which was formerly wasted in idleness or dissipation.\r\nTemperance and social harmony are irresistibly forwarded. Nor is it a\r\nquestion of a few able men imposing their will on the many, or of an\r\nartificial, State-aided process. Though the language has obtained a\r\nfooting in more than a third of the State schools and in the National\r\nUniversity,[57] the motive force behind it comes from the people\r\nthemselves. In the country district, with which I am best acquainted,\r\nboys and girls from very poor families are clubbing together to pay\r\ninstructors in the Irish language and dances, and the same thing is\r\ngoing on all over Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant modern school of poets and playwrights who, steeped in the\r\nold Celtic thought and culture, have found for it such an exquisite\r\nvehicle in the English tongue, speak for themselves and are winning\r\ntheir own way to renown. The only criticism I venture to make is that\r\nsome of them are too much inclined to look backward instead of forward,\r\nto idealize the far past rather than to illuminate the future, and to\r\ndelineate the deformities of national character produced by ages of\r\nrepression, rather than to aid in conjuring into being a virile, normal\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe name of the last movement to be referred to sums up all the others,\r\nSinn Fein. Unlike the others, it had a purely political origin, and for\r\nthat reason, probably, never made the same progress. Yet the explanation\r\nis simple. In pursuance of the general purpose of inspiring Irishmen to\r\nrely on themselves for their own salvation, economic and spiritual, Sinn\r\nFeiners, like John Mitchel and others in the past, and like the\r\nHungarian patriots, attacked, with much point and satire, the whole\r\npolicy of constitutional and Parliamentary agitation for Home Rule. The\r\npolicy, they said, had failed for half a century; it was not only\r\nnegative and barren, but positively harmful. Nationalists should refuse\r\nto send Members to Westminster and abide by the consequences. Sensibly\r\nenough, most Irishmen, while recognizing that there was an element of\r\nindisputable and valuable truth in this bold diagnosis, decided that it\r\nwas premature to adopt the prescription. Public opinion in Britain was\r\nslowly changing, and confidence existed that this opinion would be\r\nfinally converted. If the Sinn Fein alternative meant anything at all,\r\nit meant complete separation, which Ireland does not want, and a final\r\nabandonment of constitutional methods. If another Home Rule Bill were to\r\nfail, Sinn Fein would undoubtedly redouble its strength. Its ideas are\r\nsane and sound. They are at bottom exactly the ideas which actuate every\r\nprogressive and spirited community, and which in Ireland animate the\r\nIndustrial Development Associations, the Co-operative movement, the\r\nthirst for technical instruction, the Gaelic League, the literary\r\nrevival, and the work of the only truly Irish organ of government, the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture and Technical Instruction.\r\n\r\nNow, where do we stand? Are the phenomena I have reviewed arguments for\r\nHome Rule or against Home Rule? Do they tend to show that Ireland is\r\n\"fitter\" now for Home Rule, or that she manages very well without Home\r\nRule? These are superfluous questions. They are never asked save of\r\ncountries obviously designed to govern themselves and obstinately denied\r\nthe right. Who would say now of Canada or Australia that they ought to\r\nhave solved their economic, agrarian, and religious problems and have\r\nevolved an indigenous literature before they were declared fit for Home\r\nRule, or--still more unreasonable proposition--that their strenuous\r\nefforts after self-help and internal harmony in the teeth of political\r\ndisabilities proved, in so far as they were successful, that external\r\ngovernment was a success?\r\n\r\nYet these questions were, as a fact, asked of the Colonies, as they are\r\nasked of Ireland. And misgovernment increased, and passions rose, and\r\nblood flowed, while, in the guise of dispassionate psychologists, a\r\ngreat many narrow, egotistical, and bullying people at home propounded\r\nthese arid conundrums. Where is our common sense? The Irish phenomena I\r\nhave described arise in spite of the absence of Home Rule, and the\r\ndenial of Home Rule sets an absolute and final bar to progress beyond a\r\ncertain point.\r\n\r\nThat is certain; one cannot live in Ireland with one's eyes and ears\r\nopen without realizing it. All social and economic effort, successful as\r\nit is up to a certain point, and strong as its tendency is to promote\r\nnationalist feeling of the noblest kind, has to struggle desperately\r\nagainst the benumbing influence of abstract \"politics.\" Suspicion comes\r\nfrom both sides. Both Unionists and Nationalists, for example, at one\r\ntime or another have looked askance on the Co-operative movement and on\r\nthe Department of Agriculture as being too Nationalist or too Unionist\r\nin tendency. Unionists caused Sir Horace Plunkett to lose his seat in\r\nParliament in 1905; and Nationalists, though with some constitutional\r\njustification, secured his removal from office in 1907. At this moment\r\nthere is friction and suspicion in this particular matter which seems to\r\nthe impartial observer to be artificial, and which would not exist, or\r\nwould be transmuted into something perfectly harmless, and probably\r\nhighly beneficial, were there any normal political life in Ireland and a\r\ncentral organ of public opinion. As long as Great Britain insists, to\r\nher own infinite inconvenience, upon deciding Irish questions by party\r\nmajorities fluctuating from Toryism to Radicalism, and thereby compels\r\nIreland to send parties to Westminster whose _raison d'être_ is, not to\r\nrepresent crystallized Irish opinion on Irish domestic questions--that\r\nis at present wholly impossible--but to assert or deny the fundamental\r\nright for Ireland to settle her own domestic questions, so long will\r\nthese dislocations continue, to the grave prejudice of Ireland and the\r\ndeep discredit of Great Britain. Ireland, like Canada in 1838, has no\r\norganic national life. Apart from the abstract but paramount question of\r\nHome Rule, there are no formed political principles or parties. Such\r\nparties as there are have no relation to the economic life of the\r\ncountry, and all interests suffer daily in consequence. In a normal\r\ncountry you would find urban and agricultural interests distinctly\r\nrepresented, but not in Ireland. We should expect to rind clear-cut\r\nopinions on Tariff Reform and Free Trade. No such opinions exist. On the\r\nother hand, agreement on important industrial and agricultural questions\r\nfinds not the smallest reflection in Parliamentary representation.\r\nEducation, and other latent issues of burning importance, are not\r\npolitical issues. A Budget may cause almost universal dissatisfaction,\r\nbut it goes through, and the amazing thing is that Unionists complain of\r\nits going through! Most of the Parliamentary elections are uncontested,\r\nthough everybody knows that a dozen questions would set up a salutary\r\nferment of opinion if they were not stifled by the refusal of Home Rule.\r\nThe Protestant tenant-farmers of Ulster have identical interests with\r\nthose of other Provinces, and have profited largely by the legislation\r\nextorted by Nationalists; but for the most part, though by no means\r\nwholly, they vote Unionist. The two great towns, Dublin and Belfast, are\r\ndivided by the most irrational antagonism. Labourers, both rural and\r\nurban, have distinct and important interests; the rural labourers have\r\nno spokesman, the town-labourers only one. It was admitted to me by a\r\nUnionist organizer in Belfast that that city, but for the Home Rule\r\nissue, would probably return four labour members. Nor have parties any\r\nclose relation to the distribution of wealth. In the matter of incomes\r\nthe prosperous traders of Cork, Limerick, and Waterford are in the same\r\ncase as regards taxation with those of Londonderry and Belfast.\r\nPublicans are Unionists in England, Nationalists in Ireland, both in\r\nUlster and elsewhere. Before the Home Rule issue was raised, Ulster was\r\nlargely Liberal. Ulster Liberalism is almost dead. Extreme Socialism may\r\nalmost be said to be non-existent in Ireland, yet Ireland is not only\r\nadministered on semi-collectivist principles, but continually runs the\r\nrisk of being involved in legislation of a Socialistic kind, which,\r\nrightly or wrongly, she heartily dislikes.\r\n\r\nAs for the landed aristocracy all over Ireland, their historic alliance\r\nwith the intensely democratic tenant-farmers of one small corner of\r\nIreland, North-East Ulster, against those of all the rest, presented\r\nstrange enough features in the past, and is now becoming artificial in\r\nthe highest degree. Thanks to Land Purchase, no landed aristocracy in\r\nthe world now has a better chance of throwing its wealth and\r\nintelligence into public life for the good of the whole country, of\r\nthinking out problems, of conciliating factions, and of ennobling public\r\nlife. The landlord who has sold his land is a free man, far freer than\r\nthe English landlord from misgivings caused by divergency of interest.\r\nThe opportunity is still there. Will they profit by it? One thing is\r\nessential: they must become Nationalists, and in breathing that phrase,\r\none is conscious of all the misleading implications and the bitter\r\nhistorical feuds it suggests. Yet a small but powerful group of\r\nlandlords is already leading the way. And the way, even before Home\r\nRule, in reality is so simple. I speak from close observation. If a man\r\nis a good man, and worthy to represent a constituency, he has only to\r\ndeclare his belief that he thinks that he and his own fellow-citizens\r\nare fit to govern themselves. Irishmen, especially in Roman Catholic\r\ndistricts, and, indeed, as an indirect result of Catholicism, have never\r\nlost their belief in aristocracy. When a landlord, or any other\r\nProtestant, comes forward as a Nationalist, he is welcomed. His\r\nreligion, whatever it may be, does not count. Parnell and Smith O'Brien\r\nwere Protestant landlords. Many of the most trusted popular leaders,\r\nTone, Robert Emmet, John Mitchel, Isaac Butt, and others in the past\r\nhave been Protestants. Ten Members of the present Nationalist party are\r\nProtestants. The Home Rule issue would have lost some of its bitterness\r\nif a Unionist electorate had ever elected a Catholic to Parliament.\r\n\r\nStill, it is unfortunately true that the great bulk of the landlords and\r\nex-landlords stand aloof from the Home Rule movement. The collateral\r\nresult is that far too many of them instinctively stand aloof even from\r\nthose purely economic and intellectual movements which tend to make a\r\nliving united Ireland out of chaos. The national loss is heavy; the\r\nwaste of talent and of driving-power, for Ireland needs driving-power\r\nfrom her leisured and cultured classes, is melancholy to contemplate.\r\n\r\nEverywhere one sees waste of talent in Ireland. The land abounds in men\r\nwith ideas and potentialities waiting for those normal chances of\r\ndevelopment which self-governed countries provide. Much of this good\r\nmaterial is crushed under unnatural political tyrannies caused by\r\nceaseless agitation for and against an abstract aim which should have\r\nbeen satisfied long ago, so that the energies it absorbed might have\r\nbeen diverted into practical channels. There is too much moral\r\ncowardice, too little bold, independent thought and action. Nobody knows\r\nwhat Ireland really is, and of what she is capable. Nobody can know\r\nuntil she has responsibility for her own fate.\r\n\r\nLocal government, where popular opinion is nominally free, suffers from\r\nthe absence of free central government. Is it not on the face of it\r\npreposterous to give complete powers of local taxation and\r\nadministration to a country while withholding from it, as unsafe and\r\nimproper, central co-ordinating control? For any country but Ireland--at\r\nany rate, in the British self-governing Colonies and the United\r\nStates--such a policy would be regarded as crazy. Still more\r\nunreasonable is it to complain that local authorities under such a\r\nsystem spend part of the energy which should be devoted wholly to local\r\naffairs in abstract politics. I forbear from engaging in the statistical\r\nwar over the numbers of Catholics and Protestants employed and elected\r\nby local bodies. One must remember, what Unionists sometimes forget,\r\nthat Ireland is, broadly speaking, a Roman Catholic country, and that\r\nuntil thirteen years ago local administration and patronage were almost\r\nexclusively in Protestant hands. We should naturally expect a marked\r\nchange; but, with that reminder, I prefer to appeal to the reader's\r\ncommon sense. Deny national Home Rule, and give local Home Rule. What\r\nwould one expect to happen? What would have happened in any Colony? What\r\nwould Mr. Arthur Balfour himself have prophesied with certainty in the\r\ncase of any other country but Ireland? Why, this, that each little local\r\nbody would become an outlet for suppressed agitation, and that national\r\nor anti-national politics, not urgent local necessities, would enter\r\ninto local elections and influence the composition of local bodies. And\r\nwhat would be the further consequence? That numbers of the best local\r\nmen would stand aloof or be rejected, and that favouritism would find a\r\ncongenial soil.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, Irish local authorities, under the circumstances, are\r\nwonderfully free from these evils, only another proof of the resilience\r\nand vitality of the country under persistent mismanagement. On the whole\r\nthey bear comparison with British local authorities in thrift, purity,\r\nand efficiency. None of them has ever yet had a scandal like that of\r\nPoplar. All of them have shown sense and spirit in forwarding sanitation\r\nand technical education. They vary widely, of course, the lowest units\r\nin the scale being the least efficient, as in England. County Councils,\r\nfor example, are better than Rural District Councils. On the other hand,\r\nDublin Corporation, though not so bad as it is sometimes painted,\r\noccasionally sets a very bad example. The standard of efficiency is\r\nhigher in the Protestant north than in the Catholic south, the standard\r\nof religious toleration lower. But at bottom it is not a question of\r\ntheology, as every well-informed person knows, but a question of\r\npolitics. The same causes that keep the landed gentry out of Parliament\r\nkeep them, although not to the same degree, out of local politics.\r\nSometimes this is their own fault, for declining to take part in them;\r\nfor many of the Protestant upper class in Nationalist districts obtain\r\nelection in spite of being Unionists. Tolerance is slowly growing in\r\nNationalist, though not, it is to be feared, in Unionist, districts;\r\nagain a quite intelligible fact.[58] But when all is said and done, it\r\nis an undeniable fact that Irish local authorities, especially those in\r\nthe poverty-stricken west, where all social activities are more\r\nretrograde than elsewhere, are capable of great improvement, and that\r\nimprovement can come only by allowing them to concentrate on local\r\naffairs, and obtain the co-operation of all classes and religions. The\r\nvery existence of a central Government of which Irishmen were proud\r\nwould influence the tone and standard of all minor authorities to the\r\nbottom of the scale.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, obvious and urgent problems, which no Parliament but an Irish\r\nParliament can deal with, cry aloud for settlement. The Poor Law,\r\nrailways, arterial drainage, afforestation, are questions which I need\r\nonly refer to by name, confining myself to the greater issues.\r\nEducation, primary and intermediate, is perhaps the greatest. The\r\npresent system is almost universally condemned, and its bad results are\r\nrecognized. It has got to be reformed. By no possibility can it be\r\nreformed so long as the Union lasts, not only because the Boards,\r\nNational and Intermediate, which control education, are composed of\r\nunelected amateurs, but because there is no means of finding out what\r\nthe national opinion is as to the course reform is to take. Meanwhile\r\nthe children and the country suffer. The Intermediate Board is a purely\r\nexamining and prize-giving body, and its system by general agreement is\r\nimperfect. In the National or Primary schools the percentage of average\r\ndaily attendance (71.1 per cent.), though slowly improving, is still\r\nvery bad.[59] Many of the school-houses are, in the words of the\r\nCommissioners, \"mere hovels,\" unsanitary, leaky, ill-ventilated. The\r\ndistribution of schools and funds is chaotic and wasteful. Out of 8,401\r\nschools (in 1909-10)[60] nearly two hundred have an average daily\r\nattendance of less than fifteen pupils. In 1730 the number is less than\r\nthirty, and it is not only in sparsely inhabited country districts, but\r\nin big towns, that the distribution is bad. The power of the\r\nCommissioners to stop the creation of unduly small schools, and even\r\nsemi-bogus establishments which come into being in the great cities, is\r\nimperfect. Another example of the curious mixture of anarchy and\r\ndespotism that the system of Irish government presents may be seen in\r\nthe Annual Report of the Commissioners. With a mutinous audacity which\r\nwould be laughable, if the case were one for laughing, the Commissioners\r\nopenly rail at the Treasury for the parsimony of its grants, and, in\r\norder to stir its compassion, paint the condition of Irish education in\r\nblack colours. Imagine the various Departmental Ministers in Great\r\nBritain publicly attacking in their Annual Reports the Cabinet of which\r\nthey were members! The Treasury, needless to say, is not to blame. It\r\npays out of the common Imperial purse all but a negligible fraction of\r\nthe cost of primary education in Ireland. Nothing is raised by rates,\r\nand only £141,096 (in 1909-10) from voluntary and local sources, as\r\ncompared with £1,688,547 from State grants. The Treasury has no\r\nguarantee that this money is well spent; on the contrary, it knows from\r\nthe Reports of the Commissioners themselves that a great deal of it is\r\nvery badly spent. The business is a comic opera, but it has a tragic\r\nsignificance for Ireland. Primary education is so bad that a great\r\nnumber of the pupils are absolutely unfit to receive the expensive and\r\nexcellent technical instruction organized by the Department of\r\nAgriculture and Technical Instruction, and contributed to by the\r\nratepayers. The Belfast Technical Institute, for example, has to go\r\noutside its proper functions, and spend from its too small stock in\r\nproviding introductory courses in elementary subjects, so as to equip\r\nchildren for the reception of higher knowledge.[61] All over the country\r\nthe complaint is the same. No machinery whatever exists for\r\nco-ordinating primary, secondary, technical, and University education,\r\nand opportioning funds in an economical and profitable manner.\r\n\r\nReligion is the immediate cause of the trouble; absence of popular\r\ncontrol the fundamental cause. The national system of primary education,\r\ndesigned originally in 1831 to be undenominational, has become rigidly\r\ndenominational. Out of 8,401 primary schools, 2,461 only are attended by\r\nboth Protestants and Roman Catholics. The rest are of an exclusively\r\nsectarian character. Even the Protestants do not combine. The Church of\r\nIreland, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, and other smaller\r\ndenominations, frequently have small separate schools in the same\r\nparish. The management (save in the model schools, which are attended\r\nonly by Protestants) is exclusively sectarian, the local clergyman,\r\nRoman Catholic, Church of Ireland, or Nonconformist having almost\r\nautocratic control over the school.\r\n\r\nThis education question has got to be thrashed out by a Home Ruled\r\nIreland, and the sooner the better. After Home Rule the Treasury grant\r\nwill stop, and Ireland will have to raise and apportion the funds\r\nherself, and set her house in order. At whatever sacrifice of religious\r\nscruples, and, it is needless to add that to the Roman Catholic\r\nhierarchy the sacrifice will be the greatest, the Irish people must\r\ncontrol and finance its schools, whether through a central department\r\nalone, or through local authorities as well. There is no reason in the\r\nworld why a compromise should not be arrived at which would secure\r\nvastly increased efficiency and leave the teaching of denominational\r\nreligion uninjured. Other countries, where the same religions exist side\r\nby side, have attained that compromise. Ireland will be judged by her\r\nsuccess in attaining it.\r\n\r\nAnother important question is the treatment of the Congested Districts.\r\nMore than a third of Ireland is now under the benevolent jurisdiction of\r\na despotic Board.[62] So long as its funds are raised from general\r\nImperial taxation, the inevitable tendency is to shirk the thorough\r\ndiscussion of this grave subject, to lay the responsibility on Great\r\nBritain, to acquiesce in a policy of extreme paternalism, and to appeal\r\nfor higher and higher doles from the Treasury. This cannot go on.\r\nWhoever, in the eyes of Divine Justice, was originally responsible for\r\nthe condition of the submerged west, and for the ruin of the evicted\r\ntenants, Ireland, if she wants Home Rule, must shoulder the\r\nresponsibility herself, and think out the whole question independently.\r\nThe Congested Districts Board has done, and continues to do, good work\r\nin the purchase and resettlement of estates; but even in this sphere\r\nthere are wide differences of opinion as to the proper methods and\r\npolicy to be employed, especially with regard to the division of\r\ngrasslands and the migration of landless men. Its other remedial work\r\n(part of which is now taken over by the Department of Agriculture under\r\nthe Land Act of 1909), in encouraging fisheries, industries, and farm\r\nimprovements out of State money, is open to criticism on the ground of\r\nits tendency to pauperize and weaken character. I do not care to\r\npronounce on the controversy, though I think that there is much to be\r\nsaid for the view that money is best spent by encouraging agricultural\r\nco-operation. Many able and distinguished men have devoted their minds\r\nto the subject, but it is plain that Ireland as a whole has not thought,\r\nand cannot think, the matter out in a responsible spirit, and that the\r\nonly way of reaching a truly Irish decision is through an Irish\r\nParliament, which both raises and votes money for the purpose.[63] The\r\nreinstatement of evicted tenants teems with practical difficulties which\r\ncan only be solved in the same way. As long as Great Britain remains\r\nresponsible, errors are liable to be made which one day may be deeply\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\nThe same observation applies to all future land legislation, not\r\nexcepting Land Purchase, which I deal with fully in a later chapter.[64]\r\nThat great department of administration must, for financial reasons, be\r\nworked in harmonious consultation with the British Government; but it\r\nought to be controlled by Ireland, and a free and normal outlet given to\r\ncriticisms like those emanating from Mr. William O'Brien, whatever the\r\nintrinsic value of these criticisms. Purchase itself settles nothing\r\nbeyond the bare ownership of the land. It leaves the distribution and\r\nuse of the land, except in the \"resettled\" districts, where it was, with\r\na third or a quarter of the holdings so small as to be classed as\r\n\"uneconomic.\" Ireland is not as yet awake to the possibilities of the\r\nsilent revolution proceeding from the erection of a small peasant\r\nproprietorship. The sense of responsibility in these new proprietors\r\nwill be quickened and the interests of the whole country forwarded by a\r\nNational Parliament.\r\n\r\nTemperance will never be tackled thoroughly but by an Irish Parliament.\r\nAll Irishmen are ashamed in their hearts of the encouragement given to\r\ndrunkenness by the still grossly excessive number of licensed houses,\r\nwhich in 1909 was 22,591, and of the National Drink Bill, which in the\r\nsame year was £13,310,469,[65] or £3 11d. per head of a population not\r\nrich in this world's goods. Temperance is not really a party or a\r\nsectarian question. All the Churches make noble efforts to forward\r\nreform, and in a rationally governed Ireland reform would be considered\r\non its merits. At present it is inextricably mixed up with Nationalist\r\nand anti-Nationalist politics, and with irrelevant questions of Imperial\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nThe latest examples of the embarrassment into which Ireland without Home\r\nRule is liable to drift from the absence of a formed public opinion and\r\nthe means to give it effect, are the labour troubles and the National\r\nInsurance scheme. There are signs that English labour is thrusting\r\nforward Irish labour in advance of its own will and in advance of\r\ngeneral Irish opinion. In all labour questions Ireland's position as an\r\nagricultural country is totally different from that of Great Britain.\r\nThe same legislation cannot be applicable to both. Ireland should frame\r\nher own. Under present conditions it is impossible to know the\r\nconsidered judgment of Ireland. There is certainly much opposition to\r\nInsurance, and if all Irishmen thoroughly realized that the scheme might\r\ncomplicate the finance of Home Rule and involve a greater financial\r\ndependence on Great Britain than exists even at present, they would\r\nstudy it with still more critical eyes,[66] as they would certainly have\r\nstudied the Old Age Pensions scheme with more critical eyes.\r\n\r\nHere I am led naturally to the great and all-embracing questions of\r\nIrish finance and expenditure, which lie behind all the topics already\r\ndiscussed and many others. The subject is far too important and\r\ninterwoven with history to be dealt with otherwise than as an historical\r\nwhole, and that course I propose to take in a later part of the book. It\r\nis enough to say that all the arguments for Home Rule are summed up in\r\nthe fiscal argument. Every Irishman worth his salt ought to be ashamed\r\nand indignant at the present position.\r\n\r\nThe whole machinery of Irish Government, and the whole fiscal system\r\nunder which Ireland lives, need to be thoroughly overhauled by Irishmen\r\nin their own interests, and in the interests of Great Britain. Among\r\nmany other writers, Mr. Barry O'Brien, in his \"Dublin Castle and the\r\nIrish People,\" Lord Dunraven in \"The Outlook in Ireland,\" and Mr. G.F.H.\r\nBerkeley in a paper contributed to \"Home Rule Problems,\" have lucidly\r\nand wittily described the wonderful collection of sixty-seven\r\nirresponsible and unrelated Boards nominated by the Chief Secretary, or\r\nLord-Lieutenant, which, with the official services beneath them,\r\nconstitute the colonial bureaucracy of Ireland; the extravagance of the\r\njudicial and other salaries, and the total lack of any central control\r\nworthy of the name. By omitting a number of insignificant little\r\nbureaux, the figure 67, according to Mr. Berkeley's classification, may\r\nbe reduced to 42, of which 26 are directly under Castle influence, and\r\nthe rest either branches of British Departments or directly under the\r\nTreasury. In 1906, out of 1,611 principal official posts, 626 were\r\nobtained purely by nomination, and 766 by a qualifying examination only.\r\nIn an able-bodied male population, which we may estimate at a million,\r\nthere are reckoned to be about 60,000 persons employed by the State, or\r\n1 in 18. If we add 180,000 Old Age Pensioners, we reach the figure of\r\nnearly a quarter of a million persons, out of a total population of\r\nunder four and a half millions, dependent wholly or partially for their\r\nliving on the State, exclusive of Army and Navy pensioners; again about\r\n1 in 18. Four millions of money are paid in salaries or pensions to\r\nState employees, and two and three-quarter millions to Old Age\r\nPensioners.\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to make fun about Irish administration that one has to be\r\ncautious not to mistake the nature or exaggerate the dimensions of the\r\nevil. The great defect is that the expenditure is not controlled by\r\nIreland and has no relation to the revenue derived from Ireland. The\r\nCastle is not the odious institution that it was in the dark days of the\r\nland war; but it is still a foreign, not an Irish institution, working,\r\nlike the Government of the most dependent of Crown Colonies, in a world\r\nof its own, with autocratic powers, and immunity from all popular\r\ninfluence. Beyond the criticism that one religious denomination, the\r\nChurch of Ireland, is rather unduly favoured in patronage, there is no\r\npersonal complaint against the officials. They are as able, kindly,\r\nhard-working, and courteous as any other officials. Some of the\r\nprincipal posts are held by men of the highest distinction, who will be\r\nas necessary to the new Government as to the old. It is absolutely\r\nessential, but it will not be easy, to make substantial administrative\r\neconomies at the outset, not only from the additional stress of novel\r\nwork which will be thrown upon a Home Rule Government, but from the\r\nwidespread claims of vested interests. It will require courageous\r\nstatesmanship, backed by courageous public opinion, to overhaul a\r\nbureaucracy so old and extensive. Take the police, for example, the\r\nfirst and most urgent subject for reduction. Adding the Royal Irish\r\nConstabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police together, we have a\r\nforce of no less than 12,000 officers and men, a force twice as numerous\r\nin proportion to population as those of England and Wales, and costing\r\nthe huge sum of a million and a half; and this in a country which now is\r\nunusually free from crime, and which at all times has been naturally\r\nless disposed to crime than any part of Great Britain. It is the\r\nforcible maintenance of bad economic conditions that has produced Irish\r\ncrime in the past. Irishmen hotly resent that symbol of coercion, the\r\nswollen police force, which is as far removed from their own control as\r\na foreign army of occupation. On the other hand, the force itself is\r\ncomposed of Irishmen, and is a considerable, though an unhealthy,\r\neconomic factor in the life of the country. It performs some minor\r\nofficial duties outside the domain of justice; it is efficient, and its\r\nindividual members are not unpopular. Reduction will be difficult. But\r\ndrastic reduction, at least by a half, must eventually be brought about\r\nif Ireland is to hold up her head in the face of the world.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty will extend through all the ramifications of public\r\nexpenditure. Ireland, through no fault of her own, against her\r\npersistent protests, has been retained in a position which is\r\ndestructive to thrifty instincts. A rain of officials has produced an\r\nunhealthy thirst for the profits of officialdom. No one feels\r\nresponsibility for the money spent for national purposes, because no one\r\nin Ireland _is_, in any real sense, responsible. There is no Irish\r\nBudget or Irish Exchequer to make a separate Irish Government logically\r\ndefensible. The people are heavily taxed, but, rightly, they do not\r\nconnect their taxes with the expenditure going on around them. On the\r\ncontrary, their mental habit is to look to Great Britain as the source\r\nof grants, salaries, pensions.\r\n\r\nAnd the worst of it is that they are now at the point of being\r\nfinancially dependent on Great Britain. After more than a century of\r\nUnion finance, after contributing, all told, over three hundred and\r\ntwenty millions of money to the Imperial purse over and above\r\nexpenditure in Ireland, they have now ceased to contribute a penny, and\r\nare a little in debt. As we shall see, when I come to a closer\r\nexamination of finance, the main factor in producing this result has\r\nbeen the Old Age Pensions. The application of the British scale,\r\nunmodified, to Ireland is the kind of blunder which the Union\r\nencourages. Ireland, where wages and the standard of living are far\r\nlower than in England, does not need pensions on so high a scale, and\r\nalready suffers too much from benevolent paternalism. It was an\r\nunavoidable blunder, given a joint financial system, but it has gravely\r\ncompromised Home Rule finance.\r\n\r\nFor acquiescing in this and similar grants, beyond the ascertained\r\ntaxable resources of the country; for the general deficiency of public\r\nspirit and matured public opinion in Ireland; for the backwardness of\r\neducation, temperance legislation, and other important reforms, the\r\nIrish Parliamentary parties cannot be held responsible. They are\r\nabnormal in their composition and aims, and, beyond a certain limited\r\npoint, they are powerless, even if they had the will, to promote Irish\r\npolicies. That is the pernicious result of an unsatisfied claim for\r\nself-government. It is the same everywhere else. While an agitation for\r\nself-government lasts, a country is stagnant, retrograde, or, like\r\nIreland, progressive only by dint of extraordinary native exertions.\r\nRead the Durham report on the condition of the Canadas during the long\r\nagitation for Home Rule, and you will recognize the same state of\r\nthings. The leaders of the agitation have to concentrate on the abstract\r\nand primary claim for Home Rule, and are reluctant to dissipate their\r\nenergies on minor ends. Yet they, too, are liable to irrational and\r\npainful divisions, like that which divides Mr. O'Brien from Mr. Redmond;\r\nsymptoms of irritation in the body politic, not of political sanity.\r\nThey cannot prove their powers of constructive statesmanship, because\r\nthey are not given the power to construct or the responsibility which\r\nevokes statesmanship. The anti-Home Rule partisans degenerate into\r\nviolent but equally sincere upholders of a pure negation.\r\n\r\nMany of the able men who belong to both the Irish parties will, it is\r\nto be hoped, soon be finding a far more fruitful and practical field for\r\ntheir abilities in a free Ireland. But the parties, as such, will\r\ndisappear, on condition that the measure of Home Rule given to Ireland\r\nis adequate. On that point I shall have more to say later. If it is\r\nadequate, and Irish politicians are absorbed in vital Irish politics,\r\nthe structure of the existing parties falls to pieces, to the immense\r\nadvantage both of Ireland--including the Protestant sections of\r\nUlster--and of Great Britain. At present both parties, divided normally\r\nby a gulf of sentiment, do combine for certain limited purposes of Irish\r\nlegislation, but both are, in different degrees and ways, sterile. The\r\npolicy of the Nationalist party has been positive in the past, because\r\nit wrung from Parliament the land legislation which saved a perishing\r\nsociety. It is essentially positive still in that it seeks Home Rule,\r\nwhich is the condition precedent to practical politics in Ireland. More,\r\nthe party is independent, in a sense which can be applied to no other\r\nparty in the United Kingdom. Its Members accept no offices or titles,\r\nthe ordinary prizes of political life. But they themselves could not\r\ncontend that they are truly representative of three-quarters of Ireland\r\nin any other sense than that they are Home Rulers. Half of the wit,\r\nbrains, and eloquence of their best men runs to waste. Some of them are\r\nmerely nominated by the party machine, to represent, not local needs,\r\nbut a paramount principle which the electors insist rightly on setting\r\nabove immediate local needs.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Irish Unionist party in the Commons is purely\r\nnegative, to defeat Home Rule. It does not represent North-East Ulster,\r\nor any other fragment of Ireland, in any sense but that. It is\r\npassionately sentimental and absolutely unrepresentative of the\r\npractical, virile genius of Ulster industry. The Irish Unionist peers,\r\nin addition to voicing the same negative, are for the most part the\r\nspokesmen of a small minority of Irishmen in whom the long habit of\r\nupholding landlord interests has begun to outlive the need.\r\n\r\nI have said little directly about the problem of modern Ulster, not\r\nbecause I underrate its importance, which is very great, but because I\r\nhave some hope that my arguments up to this point may be perceived to\r\nhave a strong, though indirect, bearing upon it.[67] The religious\r\nquestion I leave to others, with only these few observations. It is\r\nimpossible to make out a historical case for the religious intolerance\r\nof Roman Catholics in Ireland, or a practical case for the likelihood of\r\na Roman Catholic tyranny in the future. No attempt which can be\r\ndescribed as even plausible has ever been made in either direction. The\r\nlate Mr. Lecky, a Unionist historian, and one of the most eminent\r\nthinkers and writers of our time, has nobly vindicated Catholic Ireland,\r\nbanishing both the theory and the fear into the domain of myth.[68]\r\n\r\nHe has shown, what, indeed, nobody denies, that, from the measures which\r\nprovoked the Rebellion of 1641, through the Penal Code, to the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century, intolerance, inspired by supposed political\r\nnecessities, and of a ferocity almost unequalled in history, came from\r\nthe Protestant colonists. In that brilliant little essay of his\r\nNationalist youth, \"Clerical Influences\" (1861), he described the\r\nsectarian animosity which was raging at that period as \"the direct and\r\ninevitable consequence of the Union,\" and wrote as follows: \"Much has\r\nbeen said of the terrific force with which it would rage were the Irish\r\nParliament restored. We maintain, on the other hand, that no truth is\r\nmore clearly stamped upon the page of history, and more distinctly\r\ndeducible from the constitution of the human mind, than that a national\r\nfeeling is the only check to sectarian passions.\" He was himself an\r\nanti-Catholic extremist in the sense of holding (with many others) that\r\n\"the logical consequences of the doctrines of the Church of Rome would\r\nbe fatal to an independent and patriotic policy in any land.\" But he\r\ninsists in the same passage \"that nothing is more clear than that in\r\nevery land where a healthy national feeling exists, Roman Catholic\r\npoliticians are both independent and patriotic.\"\r\n\r\nHe never recanted these opinions (which are confirmed by the subsequent\r\ncourse of events) even after his conversion to Unionism, but derived his\r\nopposition to Home Rule from a dread of all democratic tendencies,[69]\r\nthe only ground on which, if men would be willing to confess the naked\r\ntruth, it can be opposed. There the matter ought to rest. If the\r\ndoctrines of the Church of Rome are, in fact, inconsistent with\r\npolitical freedom--I myself pronounce no opinion on that point--it is\r\nplain to the most superficial observer that the Church, as a factor in\r\npolitics, stands to lose rather than to gain by Home Rule. British\r\nstatesmen have often accepted that view, and have endeavoured to use the\r\nRoman Catholic hierarchy against popular movements, just as they\r\nenlisted its influence to secure the Union. The Roman Catholic laity\r\nhave often subsequently rejected what they have considered to be undue\r\npolitical dictation from the seat of authority in Rome.\r\n\r\nIf I may venture an opinion, I believe that both of these mutually\r\nirreconcilable propositions--that Home Rule means Rome Rule, and that\r\nRome is the enemy to Home Rule--are wrong.[70] Such ludicrous\r\ncontradictions only help to destroy the case against trusting a free\r\nIreland to give religion its legitimate, and no more than legitimate,\r\nposition in the State. Ireland is intensely religious, and it would be a\r\ndisaster of the first magnitude if the Roman Catholic masses were to\r\nlose faith in their Church. The preservation of that faith depends on\r\nthe political Liberalism of the Church.\r\n\r\nCorresponding tolerance will be demanded of Ulster Protestants. At\r\npresent passion, not reason, governs the religious side of their\r\nopposition to Home Rule. It is futile to criticize Ulster Unionists for\r\nmaking the religious argument the spear-head of their attack on Home\r\nRule. The argument is one which especially appeals to portions of the\r\nBritish electorate, and the rules of political warfare permit free use\r\nof it. It was pushed beyond the legitimate point, to actual violence, in\r\nthe Orange opposition to responsible government in Canada in 1849. And\r\nit has more than once inflamed and embittered Australian politics, as it\r\ninflames the politics of certain English constituencies. But it is\r\nhardly to be conceived that Ulster Unionists really fear Roman Catholic\r\ntyranny. The fear is unmanly and unworthy of them. To anyone who has\r\nlived in an overwhelmingly Catholic district, and seen the complete\r\ntranquillity and safety in which Protestants exercise their religion, it\r\nseems painfully abnormal that a great city like Belfast, with a\r\npopulation more than two-thirds Protestant, should become hysterical\r\nover Catholic tyranny. It would be physically impossible to enforce any\r\ntyrannical law in Ulster or anywhere else, even if such a law were\r\nproposed, and many leading Protestants from all parts of Ireland have\r\nstated publicly that they have no fear of any such result from Home\r\nRule.[71]\r\n\r\n\"Loyalty\" to the Crown is a false issue. Disloyalty to the Crown is a\r\nnegligible factor in all parts of Ireland. Loyalty or disloyalty to a\r\ncertain political system is the real matter at issue. At the present day\r\nthe really serious objections to Home Rule on the part of the leading\r\nUlster Unionists seem to be economic. They have built up thriving trades\r\nunder the Union. They have the closest business connections with Great\r\nBritain, and a mutual fabric of credit. They cherish sincere and\r\nprofound apprehensions that their business prosperity will suffer by any\r\nchange in the form of government. To scoff at these apprehensions is\r\nabsurd and impolitic in the last degree. But to reason against them is\r\nalso an almost fruitless labour. Those who feel them vaguely picture an\r\nIrish Parliament composed of Home Rulers and Unionists, in the same\r\nproportion to population as at present, and divided by the same bitter\r\nand demoralizing feuds. But there will be no Home Rulers after Home\r\nRule, that is to say, if the Home Rule conceded is sufficient. I believe\r\nthat Ulster Unionists do not realize either the beneficent\r\ntransformation which will follow a change from sentimental to practical\r\npolitics in Ireland, as it has followed a similar change in every other\r\ncountry in the Empire, or the enormous weight which their own fine\r\nqualities and strong economic position will give them in the settlement\r\nof Irish questions.\r\n\r\nNor do they realize, I venture to think, that any Irish Government,\r\nhowever composed, will be a patriotic Government pledged and compelled\r\nfor its own credit and safety to do its best for the interests of\r\nIreland. I have never met an Irishman who was not proud of the northern\r\nindustries, and it is obvious that the industrial prosperity of the\r\nnorth is vital to the fiscal and general interests of Ireland, just as\r\nthe far more wealthy mining interests of the Rand are vital to the\r\nstability and prosperity of the Transvaal, and were regarded as such and\r\ntreated as such by the farmer majority of the Transvaal after the grant\r\nof Home Rule. Those interests have prospered amazingly since, and in\r\nthat country, be it remembered, volunteer British corps raised on the\r\nRand had been the toughest of all the British foes which the peasant\r\ncommandos had to meet in a war ended only four years before.\r\n\r\nIf the fears of Ulster took any concrete form, it would be easier to\r\ncombat them; but they are unformulated, nebulous. Meanwhile, it is hard\r\nto imagine what measure of oppression could possibly be invented by the\r\nmost malignant Irish Government which would not recoil like a boomerang\r\nupon those in whose supposed interests it was framed. I shall have to\r\ndeal with this point again in discussing taxation, and need here only\r\nremind the reader that Ulster is not a Province, any part of which could\r\npossibly be injured by any form of taxation which did not hit other\r\nProvinces equally.\r\n\r\nIt is the belief of Ulster Unionists that their prosperity depends on\r\nthe maintenance of the Union, but the belief rests on no sound\r\nfoundation. Rural emigration from Ulster, even from the Protestant\r\nparts, has been as great as from the rest of Ireland.[72] It is easy to\r\npoint to a fall in stocks when the Home Rule issue is uppermost, but\r\nsuch phenomena occur in the case of big changes of government in any\r\ncountry. They merely reflect the fact that certain moneyed interests do,\r\nin fact, fear a change of government, and whether those fears are\r\nirrational or not, the effect is the same. It is an historical fact, on\r\nthe other hand, that political freedom in a white country, in the long\r\nrun invariably promotes industrial expansion and financial confidence.\r\nCanada is one remarkable example, Australia is another. The Balkan\r\nStates are others. Not that I wish to push the colonial example to\r\nextremes. Vast undeveloped territories impair the analogy to Ireland;\r\nbut it is none the less true that when a country with a separate\r\neconomic life of its own obtains rulers of its own choice, and gains a\r\nnational pride and responsibility, it goes ahead, not backward.\r\n\r\nIntense, indeed, must be the racial prejudice which can cause Ulstermen\r\nto forget the only really glorious memories of their past. Orange\r\nmemories are stirring, but they are not glorious beside the traditions\r\nof the Volunteers. The Orange flag is the symbol of conquest,\r\nconfiscation, racial and religious ascendancy. It is not noble for\r\nIrishmen to celebrate annually a battle in which Ireland was defeated,\r\nor to taunt their Catholic compatriots with agrarian lawlessness to\r\nwhich their own forefathers were forced to resort, in order to obtain a\r\nprivileged immunity from the same scandalous land laws. Ulstermen\r\nreached spiritual greatness when, like true patriots, they stood for\r\ntolerance, Parliamentary reform, and the unity of Ireland. They fell,\r\nsurely, when they consented to style themselves a \"garrison\" under the\r\nshelter of an absentee Parliament, which, through the enslavement and\r\ndegradation of the old Irish Parliament, had driven tens of thousands of\r\ntheir own race into exile and rebellion.\r\n\r\nThey cherish the Imperial tradition, but let them love its sublime and\r\nreject its ignoble side. It is sublime where it stands for liberty;\r\nignoble--and none knew this better than the Ulster-American\r\nrebels--where it stands for government based on the dissensions of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nThe verdict of history is that for men in the position of the Ulster\r\nUnionists, the path of honour and patriotism, and the path of true\r\nself-interest, lies in co-operation with their fellow-citizens for the\r\nattainment of political freedom under the Crown. It is not as if they\r\nhad to create a tradition. The tradition lives.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] See pp. 13-17 and 66-71.\r\n\r\n[43] Dealt with fully in Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\n[44] In 1910-11, £2,408,000 (Treasury Return No. 220, 1911); plus\r\n£225,000 estimated increase owing to removal of Poor Law\r\ndisqualification (Answer to Question in House of Commons, February 15,\r\n1911).\r\n\r\n[45] See p. 101.\r\n\r\n[46] See particularly \"Ireland in the New Century,\" Sir Horace Plunkett;\r\n\"Contemporary Ireland,\" E.

To make\r\nhim responsible to the House of Commons was absurd; and a Departmental\r\nCommittee of 1907 has, in fact, recommended that the Vice-President\r\nshould not have a seat in Parliament, but should remain in his proper\r\nplace, Ireland. Meanwhile, the original mistake has caused friction and\r\ncontroversy. Soon after the Liberal Ministry took office in 1906, Sir\r\nHorace Plunkett, the first Vice-President, as a Unionist, was replaced\r\nby Mr. T.W. Russell, a Home Ruler. On the assumption that such an Office\r\nwas Parliamentary, its holder standing or falling with the British\r\nMinistry of the day, the step was quite justifiable, and even necessary.\r\nOn the opposite assumption, confirmed by the Departmental Committee, the\r\nstep was unjustifiable, that is, on the theory of the Union. An Irish\r\nParliament alone should have the power of displacing Irish Ministers.\r\n\r\n[53] See footnote, p. 159.\r\n\r\n[54] \"Organization and Policy of the Department,\" Official Pamphlet.\r\n\r\n[55]\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF THE IRISH AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION MOVEMENT TO DECEMBER\r\n31, 1909, WITH NUMBER OF SOCIETIES IN EXISTENCE ON DECEMBER 31, 1910\r\n(SUPPLIED BY THE I.A.O.S.):\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDescription. |Number of  |Membership.|Paid-up  |Loan     |Turnover.\r\n             |Societies. |           |Shares.  |Capital. |\r\n             |-----------|           |         |         |\r\n             |1910.|1909.|           |         |         |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCreameries   | 392 | 380 |   44,213  | 138,354 | 111,365 | 1,841,400\r\nAgricultural | 169 | 155 |   16,050  |   6,253 |  40,326 |   112,222\r\nCredit       | 237 | 234 |   18,422  |   --    |  56,469 |    57,641\r\nPoultry      |  18 |  18 |    6,152  |   2,292 |   4,026 |    64,342\r\nIndustries   |  21 |  21 |    1,375  |   1,267 |   1,450 |     7,666\r\nMiscellaneous|  37 |  15 |    4,633  |  15,015 |   2,864 |    48,987\r\nFlax         |   9 |   9 |      589  |     482 |   5,796 |     2,286\r\nFederations  |   3 |   3 |      227  |   6,753 |   6,360 |   259,925\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n             | 886 | 835 |   91,661  | 170,416 | 228,656 | 2,394,469\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[56] An Irish Trademark has been secured, and has proved of great value\r\n\"Irish Weeks,\" for the furtherance of the sale of Irish products, are\r\nheld.

The\r\nhistorical circumstances which moulded the form of each individual\r\nColonial Constitution, the Constitutions themselves, and the\r\nmodifications they have subsequently undergone, supply a mass of\r\nmaterial rich in interest and instruction for the makers of an Irish\r\nConstitution. Nor is the analogy academical. Ireland is at this moment\r\nunder a form of government unique, so far as I know, in the whole world,\r\nbut resembling more closely than anything else that of a British Crown\r\nColony where the Executive is outside popular control, and the\r\nLegislature is only partially within it; with this additional and\r\ncrowning inconvenience, that the Irish Crown Colony can obstruct the\r\nbusiness of the Mother Country. What we have to do is to liberate Great\r\nBritain and to give Ireland a rational Constitution--not pedantically\r\nadhering to any colonial model, but recognizing that, however closely\r\nher past history resembles that of a Colony, Ireland, by her\r\ngeographical position, has a closer community of interest with Great\r\nBritain than that of any Colony.\r\n\r\nThree main difficulties have to be contended with: first, that the\r\nsystem to be overthrown is so ancient, and the prejudice against Home\r\nRule so inveterate; second, the Irish are not agreed upon any\r\nconstructive scheme; third, the confusion in the popular mind between\r\n\"Federal\" and other systems of Home Rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first of these obstacles, we have got to make a big\r\nnational effort to take a sensible and dispassionate view of the whole\r\nproblem. We must cease to regard Ireland as an insubordinate captive, as\r\na \"possession\" to be exploited for profit, or as a child to be humoured\r\nand spoiled. All this is _vieux jeu_. It belongs to an utterly\r\ndiscredited form of so-called Imperialism, which might more fitly be\r\ncalled Little Englandism, masquerading in the showy trappings of\r\nBismarckian philosophy. We have gone too far in the \"dismemberment\" of\r\nour historic Empire, and near enough to the dismemberment of what\r\nremains, to apply this worn-out metaphor to the process of making\r\nIreland politically free.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland we must build on trust, or we build on sand.\r\n\r\nWhat is best for Ireland will be best for the Empire.\r\n\r\nLet us firmly grasp these principles, or we shall fail. They may be\r\ncarried to the extreme point. If it were for Ireland's moral and\r\nmaterial good to become an independent nation, it would be Great\r\nBritain's interest to encourage her to secede and assume the position of\r\na small State like Belgium, whose independence in our own interests we\r\nguarantee. Since nobody of sense, in or out of Ireland supposes that her\r\ninterest lies in that direction, we need not consider the point; but it\r\nis just as well to bear in mind that a prosperous and friendly neighbour\r\non a footing of independence is better than a discontented and backward\r\nneighbour on a footing of dependence. The corollary is this--that any\r\nrestrictions or limitations upon the subordinate Irish Government and\r\nParliament which are not scientifically designed to secure the easy\r\nworking of the whole Imperial machinery, but are the outcome of\r\nsuspicion and distrust, will serve only to aggravate existing evils.\r\nWhen the supreme object of a Home Rule measure is to create a sense of\r\nresponsibility in the people to whom it is extended, what could be more\r\nperversely unwise than to accompany the gift with a declaration of the\r\nincompetence of the people to exercise responsibility, and with\r\nrestraints designed to prevent them from proving the contrary?\r\n\r\nCenturies of experience have not yet secured general acceptation for\r\nthis simple principle. In this domain of thought the tenacity of error\r\nis marvellous, even if we make full allowance for the disturbing effect\r\non men's minds of India and other coloured dependencies where despotic,\r\nor semi-despotic, systems are in vogue. Since the expansion of England\r\nbegan in the seventeenth century, it cannot be said that the principle\r\nof trusting white races to manage their own affairs has ever received\r\nthe express and conscious sanction of a united British people. It has\r\nbeen repeatedly repudiated by Governments in the most categorical terms,\r\nand repudiated sometimes to the point of bloodshed. In other cases it\r\nhas met with lazy retrospective acquiescence on the discovery that\r\npowers surreptitiously obtained or granted without formal legislation\r\nhad not been abused. The Australian Acts of 1850 and 1855 were the first\r\napproach to a spontaneous application of the full principle; but even\r\nthen many statesmen were not fully alive to the consequences of their\r\naction, while there was no public interest, and very little\r\nParliamentary interest, in the fate of these remote dependencies. The\r\nfully developed modern doctrine of comradeship with the great\r\nself-governing Dominions, a doctrine which we may date from the\r\naccession of Mr. Chamberlain to Colonial Secretaryship in 1895, was not\r\nthe natural outcome of a belief in self-government, but a sudden and\r\neffusive acceptation of its matured results in certain definite cases.\r\nIrish Home Rule itself had, in the preceding decade, twice been rejected\r\nby the nation. With the first opportunity, after 1895, of testing belief\r\nin the principle, namely, in the Transvaal Constitution of 1905, the\r\nGovernment failed. Finally, in 1906, when, to redeem that failure, for\r\nthe first time in the whole history of the Empire a Cabinet\r\nspontaneously and unreservedly declared its full belief in the\r\nprinciple, and translated that belief into law, the whole of the\r\nOpposition, representing nearly half the electorate, washed their hands\r\nof the policy, and, if the constitutional means had existed, would,\r\nadmittedly, have defeated it, as they had defeated the Home Rule Bills\r\nof 1886 and 1893. The change of national opinion has, I believe, been\r\nconsiderable; but the circumstances remain ominous for the dispassionate\r\ndiscussion of the Irish Constitution. Patriotic people can only do their\r\nbest to ensure that the grant of Home Rule shall not be nullified by\r\nrestrictions and limitations which, if they are designed merely to\r\nappease opposition, are destined to create friction and discontent.\r\n\r\nI am far from implying that restrictions are bad things in themselves.\r\nAll Constitutions, whether the sole work of the men who are to live\r\nunder them, like that of the United States, or the gift of a Sovereign\r\nState to a dependency, or the joint work of a Sovereign and a dependent\r\nState, contain restrictions designed for the common good. The criterion\r\nof their value is the measure of consent they meet with from those who\r\nhave to live under and work the Constitution, and it is that\r\ncircumstance which makes it urgent that Irish opinion should be evoked\r\nupon their future Constitution, and that the Irish Nationalist party\r\nshould think out its own scheme of Home Rule. The Constitution of the\r\nUnited States contains many self-imposed restrictions upon the powers\r\nboth of the Central and the State Governments, in the interest of\r\nminorities; and nobody accuses the Americans of having insulted\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt will be no slur on Ireland, for example, if the most elaborate\r\nsafeguards against the oppression of the Protestant minority are\r\ninserted in the Bill, provided that Nationalist Ireland, recognizing the\r\nfears of the minority, spontaneously recommends, or, at any rate, freely\r\nconsents to their insertion--a consent which could not, of course, be\r\nexpected if their tendency was to derange the functions of Government or\r\ncripple the Legislature.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it would be a slur on Ireland which she would justly\r\nresent, besides being a highly impolitic step, to deny to the Irish\r\nExecutive an important power, such, for example, as the control of its\r\nown police.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nIt is a grave difficulty that there is no public opinion in Ireland as\r\nto the form of the Irish Constitution. That is an almost inevitable\r\nresult of political conditions past and present. Violent intestinal\r\nantagonisms are not favourable to constructive thought. The best men of\r\na country, working in harmony, are needed to devise a good Constitution,\r\nand if any Irishman could succeed in convening a Conference like that\r\nwhich created the South African Union, he would be famous and honoured\r\nfor ever in the annals of the future Ireland. That Conference, we must\r\nremember, was itself the result of the grants of Home Rule two years\r\npreviously, and these grants in their turn were greatly facilitated by\r\nthe co-operation of Britons and Dutchmen.[73] Canada, in 1840, is a\r\nwarning of the errors made in constructing a Constitution without such\r\nco-operation. Eventually it had to be torn up and refashioned. The best\r\nway of avoiding any such error in Ireland's case is to expel the spirit\r\nof distrust which animated the framers of the Canadian Union Act of\r\n1840.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nSo much for the spirit in which we should approach the problem, and I\r\npass to the consideration of the problem itself. What is to be the\r\nframework of Home Rule? I take it for granted that there must, in the\r\nbroad sense, be responsible government, that is to say, an Irish\r\nLegislature, with an Irish Cabinet responsible to that Legislature, and,\r\nthrough the Lord-Lieutenant, to the Crown. So much is common ground with\r\nnearly all advocates of Home Rule, for I take it that there is no\r\nquestion of reverting to anything in the nature of the abortive Irish\r\nCouncil Bill of 1907.[74] But agreement upon responsible government does\r\nnot carry us far enough. What are to be the relations between the\r\nsubordinate Irish Parliament and Government, and the Imperial Parliament\r\nand Government?\r\n\r\nWe immediately feel the need of a scientific nomenclature. In popular\r\nparlance, two possible types of Home Rule are recognized--\"Federal\" and\r\n\"Colonial.\" Both, of course, may be \"Colonial,\" because there are\r\nColonial Federations as well as Colonial Unitary States. But,\r\nnomenclature apart, the two possible types of Irish Home Rule correspond\r\nto two distinct types of subordinate Constitution. The \"Colonial\" type\r\nis peculiar to the British Empire, the other is to be found in many\r\nparts of the world--the United States, for example, and Germany, and\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nLet us examine these types a little more closely, confining ourselves as\r\nfar as possible to the British Empire, past and present, because within\r\nit we can find nearly all the instruction we need. As I showed in my\r\nsketch of the growth of Colonial Home Rule, all the Colonies now classed\r\nas self-governing, together with the American Colonies before their\r\nindependence, were originally unitary States, subordinate to the Crown,\r\neach looking directly to Great Britain, possessing no constitutional\r\nrelation with one another, and gradually obtaining their individual\r\nlocal autonomies under the name of \"Responsible Government.\" New Zealand\r\nand Newfoundland alone have maintained their original individualities,\r\nand their Constitutions, from an historical standpoint, are the best\r\nexamples of the first of the two types we are considering. Now for the\r\nFederal type. Very early in the history of the American Colonies (in\r\n1643) the New England group formed amongst themselves a loose\r\nconfederation, which was not formally recognized by the British\r\nGovernment, and which perished in 1684. In the next century the War of\r\nIndependence produced the confederation of all the thirteen Colonies,\r\nbut this was little more in effect than a very badly contrived alliance\r\nfor military purposes, and it was a keen sense of the inadequacy of the\r\nbond that stimulated the construction of the Great Constitution of 1787,\r\nthe first Federal Union ever devised by the English-speaking race. All\r\nthe States combined to confer certain defined powers upon a Federal\r\nParliament, to which each sent representatives, and upon a Federal\r\nExecutive whose head, the President, all shared in electing. At the same\r\ntime, each State preserved its own Constitution and the power to amend\r\nit, with the one broad condition that it must be Republican, and subject\r\nto any limitation upon its powers which the Federal Constitution\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nEighty years elapsed before any similar Federal Union was formed by\r\nColonies within the British Empire. As we have seen, all the various\r\nNorth American Colonies which received Constitutions in the last quarter\r\nof the eighteenth century, and all the Australasian Colonies similarly\r\nhonoured in the nineteenth century, were placed in direct relation to\r\nthe British Crown and in isolation from one another. Upper Canada had no\r\npolitical ties with Lower Canada, Nova Scotia none with New Brunswick,\r\nVictoria none with Tasmania. Several abortive schemes were proposed at\r\none time or another for the Federation of the North American Colonies,\r\nbut the first measure of amalgamation, namely, the union of the two\r\nCanadas in 1840, was a step in the wrong direction, and bore, as I have\r\nshown, a marked resemblance, particularly in the motives which dictated\r\nit, to the Union of Great Britain and Ireland. It was a compulsory\r\nUnion, imposed by the Mother Country, and founded on suspicion of the\r\nFrench. So far from being Federal, it was a clumsy and unworkable\r\nLegislative Union of the two Provinces, which lasted as long as it did\r\nonly because the principle of responsible government, established in\r\n1847, covered a multitude of sins. The somewhat similar attempt in\r\nAustralia in 1843 to amalgamate the two settlements of Port Phillip,\r\nafterwards Victoria, and New South Wales, at a time when each had\r\nevolved a distinct individuality of its own, was defeated by the\r\nstrenuous opposition of the Port Phillip colonists, and revoked in 1850.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, all aspirations after Federation in the outlying parts of the\r\nEmpire were discouraged by the home authorities. The most practical plan\r\nof all, Sir George Grey's great scheme of South African Federation in\r\n1859, was nipped in the bud. Canada eventually led the way. The failure\r\nof the Canadian Union brought about its dissolution in 1867 by the\r\nProvinces concerned, under the sanction of Great Britain (an example of\r\nreally sensible \"dismemberment\"), and their voluntary Federation as\r\nOntario and Quebec, together with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, under\r\nthe collective title of the Dominion of Canada, and the subsequent\r\ninclusion in this Federation of all the North American Provinces with\r\nthe exception of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nNote, at the outset, that this Federation differed from that of the\r\nUnited States in being founded on the recognition of an organic relation\r\nwith an external suzerain authority--an authority which the Americans\r\nhad abjured in framing their independent Republic. In the matter of\r\nconstitutional relations with Great Britain, the Dominion of Canada now\r\nassumed, in its collective capacity, the position formerly held by each\r\nindividual Province, and still held by Newfoundland. Direct relations\r\nbetween the individual Provinces of the Federation and the Mother\r\nCountry practically ceased, and were replaced by a Federal relation with\r\nthe Dominion. Provincial Lieutenant-Governors are appointed by the\r\nDominion Government acting in the name of the Governor-General, not\r\ndirectly by the British Government,[75] and, although in constitutional\r\ntheory the Crown, as in every least fraction of the Empire, is the sole\r\nand immediate source of executive authority, and an indispensable agent\r\nin all legislation, not only in the Dominion, but in the Provinces,[76]\r\nin actual practice the only organic connection left between a Province\r\nand Great Britain is the right of appeal directly to the King in\r\nCouncil, that is, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,\r\nwithout the intervention of the Supreme Court of Canada.\r\n\r\nSo much for the external relations of the Dominion. In respect to the\r\ndomestic relations between the Provinces and the Dominion, the Federal\r\nprinciple used in Canada is fundamentally the same as that which obtains\r\nin the United States and in every true Federation in the world, whether\r\nMonarchical or Republican, whether self-contained, like the United\r\nStates, Germany, and Switzerland, or linked, as in the British Empire,\r\nto a supreme and sovereign Government centred in London. Each Province,\r\nas in every genuine Federation, is an _imperium in imperio_, possessing\r\na Constitution of its own, and delegating central powers to a Federal\r\nGovernment. The nature and extent of the powers thus delegated or\r\nreserved, and the character of the Federal Constitution itself, vary\r\nwidely in different Federations, but we need not consider these\r\ndifferences in any detail. Let us remark generally, however, that the\r\npowers of the Canadian Province are much smaller than those of the\r\nAmerican State, and that what lawyers call \"the residuary powers\"--that\r\nis, all powers not specifically allotted--belong to the Dominion,\r\nwhereas in the United States and Switzerland they belong to the State or\r\nCanton.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Commonwealth of 1900 came into being in the same way as\r\nthe Dominion of Canada, by the voluntary act of the several Colonies\r\nconcerned--Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia, Western\r\nAustralia, Queensland--under the sanction of the British Crown and\r\nParliament. New Zealand stood out, and remained, like Newfoundland, a\r\nunitary State directly subordinate to Great Britain. Nor, in the matter\r\nof relations with the Mother Country, were the federating Colonies\r\nmerged so completely in the Commonwealth as the Provinces of Canada in\r\nthe Dominion. The Canadians had not only to construct the Dominion\r\nConstitution, but new Constitutions for two of the federating\r\nProvinces--Ontario and Quebec--and it was natural, therefore, that they\r\nshould identify the Provinces more closely with the Dominion. The\r\nAustralians, having to deal with six ready-made State Constitutions,\r\nleft them as they were, subject only to the limitations imposed by the\r\nCommonwealth Constitution. One of the results is that the State\r\nGovernors are still appointed directly by the British Government, not by\r\nthe Commonwealth. This constitutional arrangement, however, has no very\r\npractical significance. The right of appeal direct from a State Court to\r\nthe King in Council, without the intervention of the High Court of\r\nAustralia, remains, as in Canada, the only direct link between the\r\nindividual States and the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe Federal tie between the States and the Commonwealth, as defined in\r\nthe Act of 1900, is looser than that between the Provinces of Canada and\r\nthe Dominion, and bears more resemblance to the relation between a State\r\nand the Federal Government of the United States. As in that country and\r\nin Switzerland, residuary powers rest with the State or Canton\r\nGovernments, not with the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nThe South African Union of 1909, comprising the Colonies of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony, had a\r\nFederal origin, so to speak, in that the old Colonies agreed to abandon\r\na great part of their autonomies to a central Government and\r\nLegislature; but the spirit of unity carried them so far as almost to\r\nannul State rights. The powers now retained by the provincial\r\nLegislatures are so small, and the control of the Union Government is so\r\nfar-reaching, that the whole system is rightly described as a Union, not\r\nas a Federation. The Provinces, which are really little more than\r\nmunicipalities, have no longer any relation except in remotest\r\nconstitutional theory with the Mother Country, their Administrators are\r\nappointed by the Union, and, unlike the Provinces of Canada and the\r\nStates of Australia, they have not even an internal system of\r\nresponsible government.[77] No direct appeal lies to the King in Council\r\nfrom the provincial Courts, which are now, in fact, only \"divisions\" of\r\nthe Supreme Court of South Africa. The Provinces, in short, do not\r\npossess \"Constitutions\" at all. Their powers can be extinguished without\r\ntheir individual assent by an Act of the Union Parliament, whereas the\r\nCanadian Dominion has no power to amend either the Dominion or the\r\nProvincial Constitutions, and in Australia constitutional amendments\r\nmust be agreed to by the States separately as well as by the\r\nCommonwealth Parliament. But these revolutionary changes in the status\r\nof the old South African Colonies were brought about, let us remember,\r\nby the free consent of the inhabitants of South Africa, after prolonged\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\nThe United States, the Australian Commonwealth, and the Canadian\r\nDominion are, then, the three genuine Federations which the\r\nEnglish-speaking races have constructed. The two last are included in\r\nthe present British Empire, and they stand side by side with the three\r\nunitary Colonies--South Africa, New Zealand, and Newfoundland. The\r\nconstitutional relation of each of these five bodies to the Mother\r\nCountry is precisely the same, although they differ widely in internal\r\nstructure, as in wealth and population. Within each of the two\r\nFederations, as we have seen, there exists a nexus of minor\r\nConstitutions, State or Provincial, which have virtually no relations\r\nwith the Mother Country, but are integral parts of the major Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL OR COLONIAL HOME RULE?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to pose our main question, and the simplest\r\ncourse is to pose it in an illustrative form. Broadly speaking, is the\r\nrelation between Ireland and Great Britain to resemble that between the\r\nProvince of Quebec and the Dominion of Canada, or that between the\r\nDominion of Canada and the United Kingdom? One might equally well\r\ncontrast the relation of Victoria to the Australian Commonwealth with\r\nthe relation of New Zealand or Newfoundland to the United Kingdom. I\r\nchoose the Canadian illustration because it is more compact and\r\nstriking, and because it corresponds more closely to the history and to\r\nthe realities of the case. Moreover, Quebec, although she had a no more\r\nstormy domestic history, owing to lack of Home Rule, than Ontario, is\r\nbi-racial, and on that account underwent in 1840 compulsory amalgamation\r\nwith her wholly British neighbour, just as Ireland, originally\r\nbi-racial, was forcibly amalgamated with Great Britain in 1800. The\r\nCanadian partners agreed to break this bond, to fashion a better one on\r\nthe Federal principle, in the manner vaguely adumbrated by advocates of\r\nthe \"Federal\" principle for Irish Home Rule, and, as regards their\r\nrelations with the Mother Country, to pool their interests and accept\r\nrepresentation by the Dominion alone.\r\n\r\nQuebec Home Rule or Dominion Home Rule? Needless to say, these are only\r\nbroad types chosen expressly to illustrate two possible types of\r\nrelation between Ireland and Great Britain, which I shall henceforth\r\nrefer to as \"Federal\" and \"Colonial.\" There is no reason why we should\r\nnot profit in other respects by both examples, nor is there any\r\npossibility of copying either faithfully.\r\n\r\nBoth types fulfil the fundamental condition laid down at the beginning\r\nof our discussion--both, that is to say, are consistent with responsible\r\ngovernment in Ireland. Quebec, in its inner working, is a microcosm of\r\nthe Dominion, and the Dominion system of responsible government is\r\nalmost an exact copy of the unwritten British Constitution. In Quebec\r\n(as in all the Provinces and States of Canada and Australia) there is a\r\nCabinet, headed by a Prime Minister, composed of Members of the\r\nLegislature, and responsible at once to that Legislature and to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor as representing the Crown. Ireland, under a similar\r\nsystem (and, _a fortiori_, if she were put in the position of the\r\nDominion), would have a Cabinet responsible at once to the Irish\r\nLegislature and to the Lord-Lieutenant representing the Crown. The\r\nparallel is more apposite in the case of the Province of Quebec than in\r\nthe case of an Australian State, because, as I noted above, the\r\nprovincial Lieutenant-Governor is actually appointed by the Dominion\r\nGovernment, and is in his turn responsible in the first instance to that\r\nGovernment, just as the Irish Governor, or Lord-Lieutenant, who, under\r\nHome Rule, will for the first time justify his existence, is, and will\r\nstill be, appointed by the British Government.\r\n\r\nBut with the possibility of responsible government granted, it must be\r\nconfessed that the arguments against \"Quebec Home Rule\" as a measure of\r\npractical politics at the present moment, are insuperable. In the first\r\nplace there is no question in the coming Bill of federalizing the United\r\nKingdom on the lines of the Dominion of Canada--that is, of constructing\r\na new Federal Parliament elected by the whole realm, together with new\r\nlocal Legislatures elected by the various fractions of the realm.\r\nScottish and Welsh Home Rule are in the air, but they are not practical\r\nissues. English Home Rule is not even in the air. I mean that\r\nEnglishmen, whatever their views on the congestion of Parliamentary\r\nbusiness owing to the pressure of Irish, Welsh, and Scottish affairs,\r\nhave not seriously considered the idea of a subordinate Legislature\r\nexclusively English, which would be just as essential a feature of a\r\ncompletely federalized kingdom as subordinate Legislatures exclusively\r\nIrish, Scottish, and Welsh.\r\n\r\nNot that it is essential to the federalization of the United Kingdom\r\nthat Ireland, Scotland, England, and Wales, should all have separate\r\nLegislature. Any one of these fractions could coalesce with another or\r\nothers in a joint Legislature. It would be technically possible, though\r\nhighly unreasonable, to go to the extreme of giving Great Britain,\r\nregarded as one Province, a separate Legislature; Ireland, regarded as\r\nanother Province, a separate Legislature; and, above these two\r\nsubordinate bodies, a new Imperial Parliament representing the whole\r\nrealm. Such a dual Federation was nearly coming about in Canada, when\r\nOntario and Quebec dissolved their Union and resolved to federate. It\r\nbecame a quadruple Federation, owing to the adhesion of Nova Scotia and\r\nNew Brunswick; but in a dual form it would have worked just as well. It\r\nis scarcely necessary to say that the disparity in population,\r\nresources, and power between Ireland and Great Britain render a dual\r\nFederation, which, of course, involves three Legislatures, chimerical.\r\nWhat I want to insist on is that, whatever subdivisions are adopted, it\r\nis absolutely essential to every Federation that there should be a\r\ndivision of powers between a central and at least two local\r\nLegislatures--three altogether. That is the minimum. Other things are\r\nalso essential, but for the moment we can confine ourselves to the\r\noutstanding requirement. Now, there is no question in the coming Bill of\r\nany such Federation. Later years may see such a development, whether\r\nfrom pressure of work on the Imperial Parliament or from irresistible\r\ndemand for Home Rule from Scotland or Wales, or both, but not next year.\r\nThe Bill will contemplate two Parliaments, not three, namely, the\r\nexisting Imperial Parliament and the Irish Legislature. There is,\r\ntherefore, no question of Federal Home Rule, and the term \"Federal,\" as\r\napplied to Irish Home Rule at the present time, is meaningless.\r\n\r\nNor can the coming Bill for Ireland make any preparation, technically,\r\nfor a general Federation. Morally, as I shall show, it might have an\r\nimportant effect in stimulating local sentiment, not only in England,\r\nScotland, and Wales, but in Ireland, towards a general Federation in the\r\nfuture, but in its mechanical structure it must be not merely\r\nnon-Federal, but anti-Federal. One often hears it carelessly propounded\r\nthat Irish Home Rule, so devised as to be applicable in later years, if\r\nthey so desire, to Scotland, Wales, and England, will give us by smooth\r\nmechanical means a General Federation. This is a fallacy. At one stage\r\nor another, the earliest or the latest, we should have to create a\r\ntotally new central Parliament, still elected by the whole people, but\r\nexclusively devoted to Imperial affairs, and wholly exempt from local\r\nbusiness, before we possessed anything in the nature of a Federation.\r\nBut, whatever the future has in store, it would be a scandal if Irish\r\nHome Rule were to be hampered or delayed by the existence of Scotch or\r\nWelsh claims, and it is earnestly to be hoped that no action of that\r\nkind will be taken. The case of Ireland is centuries old, and more\r\nurgent than ever. It differs radically from any case that can possibly\r\nbe made for Scotland and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Bill, I repeat, must be anti-Federal, centrifugal. In the case of\r\nIreland we have first to dissolve an unnatural union, and then to revive\r\nan old right to autonomy, before we can reach a healthy Federal Union.\r\nSuch, exactly, was the history of Canada. If, in that case, the\r\ndissolution of the Legislative Union and the construction of the Federal\r\nUnion were consummated simultaneously in the British North America Act\r\nof 1867, they were nevertheless two distinct phases, and of these two\r\nphases the first, implying the revival of the old separate autonomies,\r\nwas the indispensable precursor of Federal Union. This antecedent\r\nrecognition of autonomy was not peculiar to Canada. Every Federation in\r\nthe world arose in the same way, by the voluntary act of States under\r\none Crown or suzerainty, but independent of one another, and it is of\r\nthe essence of Federalism that this psychological condition should\r\nexist. Compulsory Federation would not last a year. It would indeed be\r\npracticable to federalize the United Kingdom by one Legislative Act, but\r\nthe prior right to and fitness for complete Home Rule on the part of\r\neach of the component parts would have to be implicitly recognized.\r\n\r\nIt needs only a moment's consideration of Anglo-Irish history to see the\r\nspecial applicability of the psychological rule to Ireland. The evils of\r\nthe Canadian Union, during the twenty-seven years of its duration, are\r\ninfinitesimal beside the mischief, moral and material, which have been\r\ncaused to both partners by the forcible amalgamation of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland; the waste of indigenous talent, industrial and political;\r\nthe dispersion all over the globe of Irishmen; the conversion of friends\r\ninto enemies, of peaceable citizens into plotters of treason, of farmers\r\ninto criminals, of poets and statesmen into gaolbirds; the check to the\r\nproduction of wealth and Anglo-Irish commerce; the dislocation and\r\ndemoralization of Parliamentary life; and, saddest results of all, the\r\nreactionary effect upon British statesmanship, domestic and Imperial,\r\nand the deterioration of Irish character within Ireland. The voluntary\r\nprinciple--at any rate, among the English-speaking races--is as\r\nessential to a true Union, like that of the South African Colonies or\r\nthat of Scotland and England, as to a Federation. It is a sheer\r\nimpossibility to create a perfect, mechanical Union on a basis of hatred\r\nand coercion; witness the strangely anomalous colonial features\r\nsurviving in Irish Government--the Lord-Lieutenancy, the separate\r\nadministration, and the standing army of police.\r\n\r\nPersons inclined to reckon the advantages, whether of Federation or of\r\nUnion, in pounds, shillings, and pence, may regard the psychological\r\nrequirement as fanciful. It is not fanciful; on the contrary, it is\r\nrelated in the clearest way to the concrete facts of the situation.\r\nBefore there is any question of Federation Ireland needs to find\r\nherself, to test her own potentialities, to prove independence of\r\ncharacter, thought, and action, and to discover what she can do by her\r\nown unaided will with her own resources. As I endeavoured to show in the\r\nlast chapter, these are the true reasons for Home Rule.\r\n\r\nHome Rule is neither a luxury nor a plaything, but a tremendously\r\nexacting duty which must be undertaken by every country conscious of\r\nrepression and valuing its self-respect, and which Ireland is praying to\r\nbe allowed to undertake. When a people has learnt to understand the\r\nextent of its own powers and limitations, then it can safely and\r\nhonourably co-operate on a Federal basis with other peoples, and, in the\r\ninterests of efficiency and economy, can delegate to a central\r\nGovernment, partly of its own choice, functions hitherto locally\r\nexercised. Once more, that is the origin of all true Federations,\r\nBritish and foreign, in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the Home Rule Bill cannot in legal form be a federating or\r\nunifying measure, it must be one of a precisely opposite character, and\r\na measure of devolution. It is a proof of the need for a scientific\r\nnomenclature that the word \"devolution\" has to Irish ears come to mean\r\nsomething similar in kind to \"Federal\" Home Rule, but less in degree,\r\nand something different in kind from \"Colonial\" Home Rule, and\r\ninfinitely less in degree. What a tangle of truth and fallacy from the\r\nmisuse of a single word! It is associated rightly with the ill-starred\r\nIrish Council Bill of 1907, and it has been universally but wrongly used\r\nto indicate a small measure of local government in contradistinction to\r\nthe Home Rule Bills of Mr. Gladstone and, _a fortiori_, to any more\r\nliberal schemes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the problem before us is one of devolution pure and\r\nsimple, and the question is, how far is devolution to go? It may go to\r\nthe full length of Colonial Home Rule, that is, Ireland may be vested\r\nwith the full freedom now enjoyed by a self-governing Colony (for the\r\ngrants of Colonial Home Rule were measures of devolution), or it might\r\nat the other extreme take the form of a petty municipal government. By\r\nhypothesis, however, we are precluded from considering any scheme which\r\ndoes not admit of responsible government in Ireland. That condition\r\ncommits us to something in the nature of \"Colonial\" Home Rule, now\r\nenjoyed by States widely varying in size, wealth, and population, from\r\nthe Dominion of Canada, with over seven million inhabitants, to\r\nNewfoundland, with under a quarter of a million inhabitants and very\r\nslender resources. It is worth notice also (to shift our analogy for the\r\nmoment) that little Newfoundland, which, owing to divergency of\r\ninterest, has declined both federation with the Dominion and union with\r\nany of the constituent parts of the Dominion, subsists happily and\r\npeacefully by the side of her powerful neighbour; and that New Zealand,\r\nfor the same reason, prefers to occupy the same independent position by\r\nthe side of Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE EXCLUSION OR RETENTION OF IRISH MEMBERS AT WESTMINSTER.[78]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have discarded the \"Federal\" solution as wholly impracticable, and\r\nhave arrived at the \"Colonial\" solution. And at this point I feel it\r\nnecessary to plead for the reader's patient, if reluctant, attention to\r\nwhat follows. The solution I suggest is unpopular, mainly, I believe,\r\nbecause prejudice has so beclouded the issue in the past, and because\r\nfor the eighteen years since the last Home Rule Bill, while prejudice\r\nhas diminished, the subject of Irish Home Rule has ceased to be studied\r\nwith scientific care.\r\n\r\nWhere is the crux of the problem? In what provision of the coming Bill\r\nwill the difference between Federal Home Rule and Colonial Home Rule\r\narise? The answer is clear: in the retention or exclusion of Irish\r\nMembers at Westminster. No Colony has representatives at Westminster.\r\nThe Federal solution, on the other hand, whether it be applied to the\r\nwhole Empire or to the United Kingdom alone, involves an exclusively\r\nFederal Parliament unconcerned with State or provincial affairs. That we\r\nhave not got. What we have got is an absolutely supreme and sovereign\r\nParliament which has legal authority, not only over all Imperial affairs\r\nwithin and without the United Kingdom, but over the minutest local\r\naffairs. Unrepresented though the Colonies are, they can legally be\r\ntaxed, coerced, enslaved at any moment by an Act passed by a party\r\nmajority in this Parliament. Such measures, though legal, would be\r\nunconstitutional; but, both by law and custom, and in actual daily\r\npractice, Parliament passes and enforces certain Acts affecting the\r\nself-governing Colonies, and wields potential and actual authority of\r\nall-embracing extent over the Empire and over the local affairs of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhen we set up an Irish Legislature, then, we have to contemplate four\r\ndifferent classes of affairs in a descending scale: (1) Affairs of\r\ncommon interest to the whole Empire; (2) affairs of exclusive interest\r\nto the United Kingdom; (3) affairs exclusively British; (4) affairs\r\nexclusively Irish.\r\n\r\nWith regard to (1), the prospects of Imperial Federation do not affect\r\nthe Irish issue. It is no doubt illogical and sometimes highly\r\ninconvenient that the British Cabinet and Parliament, representing\r\nBritish and Irish electors only, should decide matters which deeply\r\nconcern the whole Empire, including the self-governing Colonies, but it\r\nis the fact. In the meantime we are securing very effective consultation\r\nwith the self-governing Colonies by the method of Imperial Conference. A\r\nFederal Parliament for the whole Empire is a possible though a remote\r\nalternative to that system. Colonial representation in the present\r\nImperial Parliament is an altogether impracticable alternative. The\r\nsuggestion had often been made for the American Colonies at the height\r\nof their discontent, later for Canada as an alternative to the Act of\r\n1791, and in recent times also. The same fallacious idea underlay the\r\nUnion of Ireland with Great Britain and her representation in\r\nParliament, while retaining colonial institutions. At present the\r\nprospects of Imperial Federation seem to be indifferent. On the other\r\nhand, the affection between all branches of our race which is the\r\nindispensable groundwork of Federation becomes visibly stronger, and\r\nwill become stronger, provided that we do not revert to the ancient and\r\ndiscredited policy either of dictating to the Colonies or taking sides\r\nwith one or another of the parties within them, provided also that the\r\nColonies in their growing strength do not dictate to us or take sides\r\nwith one or other of our parties.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever the prospects of Imperial Federation, so long as the\r\npresent situation lasts, there is no reason for giving a self-governing\r\nIreland more control over Imperial matters affecting the self-governing\r\nColonies than the self-governing Colonies themselves possess. The\r\npresent position is illogical enough; that would be to render it doubly\r\nillogical. Representation of Ireland, therefore, at Westminster, on the\r\nground that she should take part in settling matters of the widest\r\nImperial purport, is indefensible. The alternative and much more\r\neffectual method, as with the Colonies, is Conference.\r\n\r\n(2-4) But it is when we come to regard the United Kingdom as a\r\nself-contained entity that the difficulty of retaining Irish Members at\r\nWestminster appears most formidable. If we discard the Federal solution\r\nwe must discard it wholeheartedly, not from a pedantic love of logic,\r\nbut to avoid real, practical anomalies which might cause the whole\r\npolitical machine to work even worse than it does at present. From what\r\nI have written, it will be seen at once that to retain the Irish Members\r\nin the House of Commons, while giving Ireland responsible government,\r\nwould be to set up a kind of hybrid system, retaining the disadvantages\r\nof the Union without gaining the advantages of Federalism. A Federal\r\nsystem needs a Federal Parliament, which we have not got, and shall not\r\nget for a long time yet. To introduce into it a quasi-Federal element is\r\nto mix oil with water.\r\n\r\nI state the proposition in this broad way at first in order to push home\r\nthe truth that Irish representation at Westminster will involve\r\nanomalies and dangers which, beyond a certain very limited point, cannot\r\nbe mitigated. Methods of mitigation I will deal with in a moment. Let me\r\nremark first upon the strange history of this question of Irish\r\nrepresentation at Westminster. Obviously it is the most fundamental\r\nquestion of all in the matter of Home Rule. The whole structure of the\r\nBill hangs on it. It affects every provision, and particularly the\r\nfinancial provisions. Yet Mr. Gladstone went no farther than to call it\r\nan \"organic detail,\" and in popular controversy it is still generally\r\nregarded in that light, or even in a less serious light. As a matter of\r\nhistory, however, it has proved to be a factor of importance in deciding\r\nthe fate of the Home Rule Bills. In 1886 Mr. Gladstone, in proposing to\r\nexclude Irish Members altogether, roused a storm of purely sentimental\r\nopposition. In 1893, in proposing to retain them--first with limited\r\nfunctions, then on the old terms of complete equality with British\r\nMembers--he met with opposition even more formidable, because it was not\r\nmerely sentimental, but unanswerably practical. On both occasions Mr.\r\nChamberlain took a prominent part in the opposition: in 1886 because he\r\nwas then a Federalist, advocating \"Quebec\" Home Rule for Ireland, and\r\nregarding the exclusion of Irish Members from Westminster as\r\ncontravening the Federal principle; in 1893 because, having ceased to be\r\na Home Ruler, he had no difficulty in showing that the retention of\r\nIrish Members, either with full or limited functions, was neither\r\nFederation nor Union, but an unworkable mixture of the two.\r\n\r\nThese facts should be a warning to those who trifle thoughtlessly with\r\nwhat they call \"Federal\" Home Rule. It was through a desperate desire to\r\nconciliate that Mr. Gladstone caught at the Federal chimera in 1893, and\r\nproduced a scheme which he himself could not defend. And it was one of\r\nthe very statesmen that he sought to conciliate--a statesman, moreover,\r\npossessing one of the keenest and strongest intellects of the time--who\r\nsnatched at the chimera in 1886, and argued it out of existence in 1893.\r\nWe Home Rulers do not want a repetition of those events. We want Home\r\nRule, and if we are to be defeated, let us be defeated on a simple\r\nstraightforward issue, not on an indefensible complication of our own\r\ndevising.\r\n\r\nNow to details. There are five ways of dealing with the question, and of\r\nthese I will take first the four different ways of including Irish\r\nMembers in the House of Commons, leaving their total _exclusion_ to the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n1. Inclusion of Irish Members in their full numbers for all\r\npurposes--that is, with a right to vote upon all questions--British,\r\nIrish, and Imperial. [By \"full numbers\" I mean, not the existing figure\r\nof 103, but numbers fully, and no more than fully, warrantable according\r\nto the latest figures of population--say 70.]\r\n\r\n2. Inclusion in full numbers for limited purposes.\r\n\r\n3. Inclusion in reduced numbers for all purposes. [By \"reduced numbers\"\r\nI mean in numbers less than population would warrant.]\r\n\r\n4. Inclusion in reduced numbers for limited purposes.\r\n\r\nNow (4) I only set out for symmetry. It has never been proposed by\r\nanybody, and hardly needs notice.\r\n\r\nThe three others are alike in two respects--that they leave untouched\r\nthe question of representation in the House of Lords, and that they\r\ndirectly infringe both the Federal principle and the Union principle by\r\ngiving representation, both in a unitary and a subordinate Legislature,\r\nto one portion of the realm.\r\n\r\nLet us look at No. 1--inclusion in full numbers for all purposes. This\r\nwas Mr. Gladstone's revised proposal of 1893, and it formed part of the\r\nBill thrown out by the Lords. The number of Irish Members was to have\r\nbeen 80. But reduction, as Mr. Gladstone admitted, would scarcely affect\r\nthe inherent difficulties of inclusion. Nor must it be forgotten that\r\nreduction from 103 to 70 can be justified only by the concession of a\r\nlarge measure of Home Rule. It is one of the paradoxes of an unnatural\r\nUnion that, over-represented as Ireland is, she has not now power enough\r\nto secure her own will. To reduce her numbers, while retaining large\r\npowers over Irish affairs at Westminster, would be unjust. For the time\r\nbeing I shall defer the consideration of those powers, and argue the\r\nmatter on broad principle, assuming that the powers retained in Imperial\r\nhands are small enough to warrant a reduction from 103 to 70.\r\n\r\nNow let us apply our touchstone to this question of inclusion in \"full\"\r\nnumbers. Will it be good for Ireland? Surely not.\r\n\r\n(_a_) It will be bad for Ireland, in the first place, to have her\r\nenergies weakened at the outset by having to find two complete sets of\r\nrepresentatives, when she will be in urgent need of all her best men to\r\ndo her own work. There is no analogy with Quebec, Victoria,\r\nMassachusetts, or Würtemburg, which had all been accustomed to\r\nself-government before they entered their respective Federations.\r\nIreland has to find her best men, create her domestic policies,\r\nreconstruct her administration, and the larger the reservoir of talent\r\nshe has to draw from the better. When true Federation becomes practical\r\npolitics it will be another matter. By that time she will have men to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\n(_b_) More serious objection still, retention in full numbers will, it\r\nis to be feared, tend to counteract the benefits of Home Rule in Ireland\r\nby keeping alive old dissensions and bad political habits. If, after\r\nlong and hot controversy, a system is set up under which Great Britain\r\ncan still be regarded as a pacificator--half umpire and half\r\npoliceman--of what Peel called the \"warring sects\" of Ireland, it is to\r\nbe feared that the Members sent to London may fall into the old\r\nunnatural party divisions; a Protestant minority seeking to revoke or\r\ncurtail Home Rule, and a Nationalist majority--paradoxical survival of a\r\npre-national period--seeking to maintain or enlarge Home Rule. These\r\nunhappy results would react in their turn upon the Irish Legislature,\r\nimpairing the value of Home Rule, and making Ireland, as of old, the\r\ncockpit of sectarian and sentimental politics. The same results would\r\nhave happened if, simultaneously with the concession of Home Rule to\r\nCanada, Australia and South Africa, these Colonies had been given\r\nrepresentation in the British Parliament.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Whatever the extent of the danger I have indicated, inclusion in\r\nfull numbers will tend to keep alive the habit of dependence on Great\r\nBritain for financial aid, a habit so ingrained, through no fault of\r\nIreland's, that it will be difficult to break if the Parliamentary\r\nleverage is left intact. If ever there was a country which needed, as\r\nfar as humanly possible, to be thrown for a time--not necessarily for a\r\nlong time--upon its own resources, it is Ireland. Every other\r\nself-governing Colony in the Empire has gone through that bracing and\r\npurifying ordeal, accepting from the Mother Country, without repayment,\r\nonly the loan of military and naval defence, and Ireland can imitate\r\nthem without dishonour.\r\n\r\nWhat is bad for Ireland is sure to be bad for Great Britain, too, and\r\nthe bad effect in this case is sufficiently apparent. Imagine the result\r\nif Quebec, besides having her own Legislature and her own\r\nrepresentatives in the Dominion Parliament, were to be represented also\r\nin the Ontario Legislature. Ireland, besides controlling her own\r\naffairs, free from British interference, would have a voice in British\r\naffairs, and sometimes a deciding voice. \"If you keep the Irish in,\"\r\nsaid Mr. John Morley in 1886--and he meant in their full numbers--\"they\r\nwill be what they have ever been in the past--the arbitrators and\r\nmasters of English policy, of English legislative business, and of the\r\nrise and fall of British administrations.\" That is a rather exaggerated\r\naccount of the past, for had it been literally true Ireland would have\r\nhad Home Rule long ago; and it was unduly pessimistic about the future,\r\nfor it hardly made sufficient allowance for a change in Irish spirit as\r\na result of Home Rule; but there is a truth in the words which everybody\r\nrecognizes and whose recognition is one of the great motive forces\r\nbehind Home Rule. Even a total change in Irish sentiments and parties\r\nwould not remove the danger, and might intensify it by producing at\r\nWestminster a solid instead of, as at present, a divided, Irish vote. It\r\nwould be truer, perhaps, to say what I said above, that retention of\r\nMembers would tend to stereotype Irish parties and the mutual antipathy\r\nof Ireland and Great Britain.\r\n\r\n2. Inclusion in full numbers (say 70) for limited purposes. This (with\r\nthe figure of 80) was Mr. Gladstone's original proposal of 1893, and it\r\ntook the form of a clause known as the \"In and Out Clause,\" which\r\npurported to divide all Parliamentary business into Imperial, Irish, and\r\nnon-Irish business, and to give Irish Members the right to vote only on\r\nImperial and Irish subjects. Mr. Gladstone never disguised his view that\r\na sound classification was impracticable, and put forward the clause,\r\nfrankly, as a tentative scheme for the discussion of the House. Like its\r\nsuccessor, the \"Omnes omnia\" Clause, it was riddled with criticism, and\r\nit was eventually withdrawn. Without investigating details, the reader\r\nwill perceive at once the hopeless confusion arising from an attempt to\r\ninject a tincture of Federalism into a unitary Parliament, forming part\r\nof an unwritten Constitution of great age and infinite delicacy. It is\r\nnot merely that it is absolutely impossible to distinguish rigidly\r\nbetween Imperial, Irish, and British business. The great objection is\r\nthat there would be two alternating majorities in an Assembly which is,\r\nand must be, absolutely governed by a party majority, and which, through\r\nthat majority, controls the Executive. It \"passed the wit of man,\" said\r\nMr. Gladstone, to separate in practice the Legislative and Executive\r\nfunctions in the British Constitution. At present a hostile vote in the\r\nHouse of Commons overturns the Ministry of the day and changes the whole\r\nBritish and Imperial administration. A hostile vote, therefore,\r\ndetermined by the Irish Members, on a question affecting Ireland, such\r\nas the application to Ireland of a British Bill, would seriously\r\nembarrass the Ministry, if it did not overturn it. The log-rolling and\r\nillicit pressure which this state of things would encourage may be\r\neasily imagined. A Ministry might find itself after a General Election\r\nin the position of having a majority for some purposes and not for\r\nothers. That was actually the case in 1893, when Mr. Gladstone, with a\r\nmajority, including the Irish Nationalists, of only 40, was carrying his\r\nBill through Parliament. It is actually the case now, in the sense that\r\nif the Irish Nationalists voted with the Opposition, the Ministry would\r\nbe defeated. Any change for the better in Irish sentiment towards Great\r\nBritain would _pro tanto_ mitigate the difficulty, but would not remove\r\nit, and might, as I suggested above, increase it, by the creation of a\r\nsolid Irish vote. If Great Britain resents the present system, she alone\r\nis to blame. As long as she insists on keeping the Irish Members out of\r\nIreland, where they ought to be, she thoroughly deserves their tyranny,\r\nand would be wise to get rid of it by the means they suggest. Until they\r\nare given Home Rule, they are not only justified in using their power,\r\nbut are bound, in duty and honour, to use it. To reproduce in the Home\r\nRule Bill, albeit in a modified form, conditions which might lead to the\r\nsame results as before would surely be a gratuitous act of unwisdom.\r\n\r\n3. Inclusion in reduced numbers for all purposes. By \"reduced numbers\"\r\nis meant numbers less than the population of Ireland warrants. For the\r\nsake of argument we may assume the number to be 35, that is,\r\napproximately half the proper proportion; but directly we desert a\r\nscientific principle of allocation, the exact figure we adopt is a\r\nmatter of arbitrary choice.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone appears to have contemplated this plan for a brief period\r\nin 1889; but he dropped it. Clearly it cannot be defended on any logical\r\ngrounds, but only as a compromise designed, as it avowedly was, to\r\nconciliate British opinion. It would minimize but not remove the\r\ndifficulties inherent in No. 1; and so far as it did lessen these\r\ndifficulties, the representation given would be impotent and\r\nsuperfluous. That is why I have taken it last in order of the three\r\npossible methods of inclusion. It raises in the sharpest and clearest\r\nform the important question underlying the whole of the discussion we\r\nhave just been through--namely, what are to be the powers delegated to\r\nthe Irish Parliament and Executive, and what are to be the powers\r\nreserved to the Imperial Parliament and Executive?\r\n\r\nIf the powers reserved are small, it will be possible to justify not\r\nmerely a small Irish representation in the House of Commons, but even\r\nunder certain conditions the total exclusion of Irish members. Indeed,\r\nif the figure 35 corresponded to the facts of the case, one might as\r\nwell abandon these painful efforts to \"conciliate British opinion,\"\r\naccept total exclusion, and substitute Conference for representation. If\r\nthe powers reserved are large, full representation in spite of all the\r\ncrushing objections to it, will be absolutely necessary, in order to\r\nsafeguard Irish interests. Here is the grand dilemma, and it says little\r\nfor our common sense as a nation that we should submit to be puzzled and\r\nworried by it any longer. Half the worry arises from the old and\r\ninfinitely pernicious habit of regarding Ireland as outside the pale of\r\npolitical science, of ignoring in her case what Lord Morley has called\r\nthe \"fundamental probabilities of civil society.\" Let us break this\r\nhabit once and for all and take the logical and politic course of total\r\nexclusion, with its logical and politic accompaniment, a measure of Home\r\nRule wide enough to justify the absence of Irish representation at\r\nWestminster. That will be found to be the path both of duty and of\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nLet it be clearly understood that lapse of time has not diminished\r\nappreciably the power of the arguments against the inclusion of Irish\r\nMembers in the House of Commons. On their merits, these arguments are\r\nstill unanswerable, and we had better recognize the fact. Mr. Balfour\r\nsaid, in 1893, \"Those questions\" (of representation at Westminster) \"are\r\nnot capable of solution, and the very fact that they are incapable of\r\nsolution affords, in our opinion, a conclusive argument against the\r\nwhole scheme, of which one or other of the plans in question must form a\r\npart.\" Speaking as a Unionist, Mr. Balfour was right, and, as Home\r\nRulers, we should be wise to remember it.\r\n\r\nLastly, even if the question of inclusion in the House of Commons were\r\n\"capable of solution,\" as it is not, there would remain the problem\r\nraised by the House of Lords. It is idle to ignore the fact that the\r\nbulk of the Irish peerage, and the Assembly of which it forms part, has\r\nbeen for a century in consistent and resolute opposition to the views of\r\nthe vast majority of Irishmen. The recent curtailment of its powers,\r\nwhether a right or a wrong measure in itself, does not make it any the\r\nmore suitable as an Upper Chamber, under a Home Rule scheme, for the\r\ndecision of important Irish questions reserved for settlement at\r\nWestminster; indeed, the bare proposal is the best imaginable example of\r\nthe extraordinary complications which would ensue from the introduction\r\nof a quasi-Federal element into a unitary Constitution.\r\n\r\nFederal Upper Chambers, so far from being hostile to State rights, are\r\nalmost invariably framed on the principle of giving disproportionately\r\nlarge representation to the smaller States. In the United States and\r\nAustralia, for example, every State, however small, has an equal number\r\nof Senators.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear now that there are two distinct ways of approaching the\r\nquestion of the framework of Home Rule. One may begin with the nature\r\nand extent of the powers reserved or delegated, and proceed from them to\r\nthe inclusion and exclusion of Irish representation at Westminster, or\r\none may begin with the topic of inclusion or exclusion and proceed from\r\nit to the nature and extent of powers. While premising that we must\r\ntrust Ireland and evoke her sense of responsibility, I chose the latter\r\nof the two courses, because I believe it to be on the whole the most\r\nilluminating and trustworthy course. It is also the more logical course,\r\nthough I should not have adopted it for that reason alone; and I have\r\nalready given, I hope, some good reasons to show that in this matter\r\nlogic and policy coincide. Englishmen pride themselves on the lack of\r\nlogic which characterizes their slowly evolved institutions, but they\r\nmay easily carry that pride to preposterous extremes. Faced now with the\r\nnecessity of making a written Constitution which will stand the test of\r\ndaily use they would commit the last of innumerable errors in Irish\r\npolicy if, with full warning from experience elsewhere, they were to\r\nframe a measure whose unprecedented and unworkable provisions were the\r\noutcome of a distrust of Ireland which it was the ostensible object of\r\nthe measure itself to remove.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIRISH POWERS AND THEIR BEARING ON EXCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI pass to what I suggest to be the right solution: Total exclusion, as\r\nproposed by Mr. Gladstone in 1886, though he shrank from recommending\r\nwhat he knew to be its financial corollary. Mr. Bright regarded\r\nexclusion as the \"best clause\" of a dangerous scheme, and Mr.\r\nChamberlain has admitted that he attacked it, as he attacked the\r\nproposals for Land Purchase, which he knew to be right, in order to\r\n\"kill the Bill.\"[79] I propose only to recapitulate the merits of\r\nexclusion before dealing with the alleged difficulties of that form of\r\nHome Rule, and in particular with the point on which the controversy\r\nmainly turns--Finance.\r\n\r\nTo give Ireland Colonial Home Rule, without representation in London, is\r\nto follow the natural channel of historical development. Ireland was\r\nvirtually a Colony, and is treated still in many respects as an inferior\r\ntype of Colony, in other respects as a partner in a vicious type of\r\nUnion. We cannot improve the Union, and it is, admittedly, a failure.\r\nLet us, then, in broad outline, model her political system on that of a\r\nself-governing Colony.\r\n\r\nHistory apart, circumstances demand this solution. It is the best\r\nsolution for Ireland, because she needs, precisely what the Colonies\r\nneeded--full play for her native faculties, full responsibility for the\r\nadjustment of her internal dissensions, for the exploitation, unaided,\r\nof her own resources, and for the settlement of neglected problems\r\npeculiar to herself. As a member of the Imperial family she will gain,\r\nnot lose. And the Empire, here as everywhere else, will gain, not lose.\r\n\r\nThese ends will be jeopardized if we continue to bind her to the British\r\nParliament, and restrict her own autonomy accordingly. Reciprocally, we\r\ndamage the British Parliament and gratuitously invite friction and\r\ndeadlock in the administration either of British or of Imperial affairs,\r\nor both. Of the difficulties raised we can mitigate one only by bringing\r\nanother into existence. Endeavouring to minimize them all by reducing\r\nthe Irish representation to the lowest point, we either do a gross\r\ninjustice to Ireland, by diminishing her control over interests vital to\r\nher, or, by conceding that control, remove the necessity for any\r\nrepresentation at all. Most Irish Unionists would, I believe, prefer\r\nexclusion to retention. One gathers that from the debates of 1893, and\r\nthe view is in accordance with the traditional Ulster spirit, and the\r\nspirit generally displayed by powerful minorities threatened with a Home\r\nRule to which they object on principle. It was the spirit displayed by\r\nthe Upper Canadian minority, in 1838-39 (_vide_ p. 101), in threatening\r\nto leave the Empire rather than submit to Home Rule, and by the\r\nTransvaal minority in the lukewarm and divided support given to the\r\nhalf-baked Constitution of 1905, and in the hearty welcome given to the\r\nfull autonomy of 1906. How the Colonists expressed themselves matters\r\nnothing. We must make generous allowance for hot party feeling and old\r\nprejudices. The Canadian minorities did not really mean to call in the\r\nUnited States, nor does it signify a particle that some of the\r\nJohannesburgers vowed that anything could be borne which freed them from\r\nthe interference of a Liberal Government. These opinions are transient\r\nand negligible. The spirit is essentially healthy. Paradox as it may\r\nseem, the uncompromising attitude of Ulster Unionists, as voiced by the\r\nablest representative they ever had, Colonel Saunderson,[80] is hopeful\r\nfor the prospects of Home Rule. They fight doggedly for the Union, but I\r\nbelieve they would prefer a real Home Rule to a half-measure, and in\r\nmaking that choice they would show their virility and courage at its\r\ntrue worth.\r\n\r\nWhere are the dangers and difficulties of exclusion? The dangers first.\r\nI believe, from a study of events in the last twenty-five years, that\r\nthe strongest opposition to it was founded, not so much upon a\r\nreluctance to give Ireland powers full enough to render needless her\r\nrepresentation at Westminster, but on a jealous desire to keep Irish\r\nMembers under surveillance, as a dangerous and intractable body of men\r\nwho would hatch mischief against the Empire if they were allowed to\r\ndisappear from sight; the same kind of instinct which urged\r\nrevolutionary Paris to stop the flight of Louis and to keep him under\r\nlock and key. In the case of Ireland it is possible to understand the\r\nprevalence of this instinct in 1886, though even then it was irrational\r\nenough. But in 1911 we should be ashamed to entertain it. Irish plots\r\nagainst the Empire have passed into electoral scares, and if they had\r\nnot, representation in London would be no safeguard. We should also\r\ndismiss the more rational but groundless view that Imperial co-operation\r\nnecessitates representation in a joint Assembly. Conference is a better\r\nmethod. Anyone who studies the proceedings of the last Imperial\r\nConference and observes the number and variety of the subjects discussed\r\nand the numerous and valuable decisions arrived at, will realize how\r\nmuch can be done by mutual good-will and the pressure of mutual\r\ninterest.[81]\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that, with one or two exceptions of quite recent\r\ndate, the Colonies have contributed nothing to the upkeep of the Empire,\r\nexcept in the very indirect form of maintaining local military forces,\r\nthat their present tendency --unquestionably a sound tendency--is to\r\nco-operate, not by way of direct money contribution to Imperial funds,\r\nbut by the construction of local Navies out of their own money, and, in\r\ntime of peace, under their own immediate control, and that Ireland\r\ncannot be allowed to follow their example. The objection has no point.\r\nIreland, through no fault of her own, has reached a stage (if we are to\r\ntrust the Treasury figures) where she no longer pays any cash\r\ncontribution to Imperial expenses, nor is it possible to look back with\r\nany satisfaction upon the enormous total of her cash contributions in\r\nthe past. They were not the voluntary offerings of a willing partner,\r\nbut the product of a joint financial system which, like all consequences\r\nof a forced Union, was bad for Ireland. If we consider that a similar\r\nattempt to extort an Imperial contribution from the American States led\r\nto their secession; that the principle was definitely abandoned in the\r\ncase of the later Colonies; that, on the contrary, large annual sums\r\nraised in these islands were, until quite recent times, spent for\r\npurposes of defence within these Colonies; that in the South African War\r\ntwo hundred and fifty million pounds were spent in order to assist\r\nBritish subjects in the Transvaal to obtain the rights of freemen in a\r\nself-governing Colony; and that to this day indirect colonial\r\ncontributions in the shape of local expenditure are small in proportion\r\nto the immense benefit derived from the protection of the Imperial Navy,\r\nArmy, and Diplomacy, and from the assistance of British credit; if we\r\nthen reflect that before the Union Ireland was, in the matter of\r\ncontribution, somewhat in the same position as Canada or Australia\r\nto-day--that is, paying no fixed cash tribute, but voluntarily assuming\r\nthe burden, very heavy in time of war, of certain Army establishments;\r\nthat for seventeen years after the Union contributions fixed on a scale\r\ngrossly inequitable drove her into bankruptcy; that from 1819 until two\r\nyears ago, she paid, by dint of excessive taxation and in spite of\r\nterrible economic depression, a considerable share, and sometimes more\r\nthan her proportionate share, of Imperial expenditure;[82] if, finally,\r\nwe remember that, cash payments apart, Irishmen for centuries past have\r\ntaken an important part in manning the Army and Navy, have fought and\r\ndied on innumerable battle-fields in the service of the Empire, and have\r\ncontributed some of its ablest military leaders; if we consider all\r\nthese facts soberly and reasonably, we shall, I believe, agree that it\r\nwould be fair and right to place a Home Ruled Ireland in the position of\r\na self-governing Colony, with a moral obligation to contribute, when her\r\nmeans permit, and in proportion to her means, but without a statutory\r\nand compulsory tribute.\r\n\r\nWhat form should that contribution eventually take? Does it necessarily\r\nfollow that Ireland should be given power to construct her own Navy, and\r\nraise and control her own troops? Let us use our common sense, and use\r\nit, let me add, fearlessly. If Ireland really _wanted_ full colonial\r\npowers, if, like Australia and Canada, she would be discontented and\r\nresentful at their denial, we should be wise to grant them, and rely on\r\ncommon interests and affections to secure friendly co-operation. Does it\r\nnot stand to reason that a friendly alliance even with a foreign power,\r\nsuch as France, to say nothing of the far more intimate relations with a\r\nconsanguineous Colony, is better business than any arrangement for\r\ncommon forces unwillingly or resentfully acceded to? But, as I pointed\r\nout in Chapter VIII., all these uneasy speculations about independent\r\nIrish armaments are superfluous. Ireland does not want separate\r\narmaments. The sporadic attempts to discourage enlistment in the\r\nImperial forces are, as every sensible person should recognize, the\r\nresults of refusing Home Rule. They would have occurred in every Colony\r\nunder similar circumstances, and they do occur in one degree or another\r\nwherever countries agitate vainly for Home Rule. If Russia misinterprets\r\nsuch phenomena, we have, let us hope, more political enlightenment than\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nIreland's strategical situation bears no analogy to that of Australia\r\nand Canada, which, for geographical reasons, are compelled, as South\r\nAfrica will be compelled, to make a certain amount of independent\r\nprovision, not only for military, but for naval defence, and would be\r\nwanting in patriotic feeling if they did otherwise. New Zealand, on the\r\nother hand, is too small to be capable of creating a Navy, and rightly\r\ncontributes to ours. We have arrived at an interesting psychological\r\npoint when Australia and Canada both seem to be inclined to reserve, in\r\ntheory, a right to abstain from engaging their Navies in a war\r\nundertaken by Great Britain, but nobody will be alarmed by this\r\ntheoretical reservation. It is an insignificant matter beside the Naval\r\nAgreement reached at the last Conference (1911)--an agreement worth more\r\nthan volumes of unwritten statutes--to the effect that the personnel of\r\nthe colonial fleets is to be interchangeable with that of the Imperial\r\nfleet and that in a joint war colonial ships are to form an integral\r\npart of the British fleet under the control of the Admiralty. With such\r\nan agreement in existence, it becomes superfluous to lay stress upon the\r\nfact that without formal and complete separation from the Mother Country\r\nin time of peace, the neutrality of a Colony would not be recognized by\r\na belligerent enemy of Great Britain in time of war. In any case these\r\ndevelopments have no concern for Ireland, which does not want, and need\r\nnot be given, power to raise a local Navy. Nor, with regard to the\r\nregular land forces, will anything be changed. Troops quartered in\r\nIreland will be, as before, and as in the Colonies now, under complete\r\nImperial control. So will Imperial camps, magazines, arsenals,\r\ndock-yards. On the other hand, arrangements should certainly be made to\r\npermit the raising of Volunteer forces in Ireland. There are large\r\nnumbers of Irishmen in the British Territorial Army, and Ireland sent\r\nfive companies to the South African War. Though the poverty of the\r\ncountry will for a long time check the growth of Volunteer forces, it is\r\nthe Union which presents the only serious obstacle to their\r\nestablishment. No surer proof of the need for Home Rule could be adduced\r\nthan the fact that it was held to be impossible to extend the\r\nTerritorial system to Ireland. One of the objects of Home Rule is to\r\nremove this suspicious atmosphere. Whether local power to organize and\r\narm Volunteers in Ireland should be given to the Irish authority, or, as\r\nin the Home Rule Bills of 1886 and 1893, reserved to the Imperial\r\nGovernment, is, if we trust Ireland, as we must, a secondary and not a\r\nvital matter, which would not affect the question of representation at\r\nWestminster.[83] Probably it would be most convenient to leave the\r\nmatters in the hands of the Irish Legislature. In any case, the\r\nCommand-in-Chief of all forces in Ireland, regular or volunteer, would,\r\nas in the Colonies,[84] be vested in the King.\r\n\r\nThe control of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin Metropolitan\r\nPolice does not affect the question of representation at Westminster.\r\nWith or without representation, Ireland should be given the control of\r\nall her own police forces from the first, without the restrictions\r\nimposed by the Bills of 1886 and 1893 with regard to Imperial control of\r\nthe existing forces.[85]\r\n\r\nWith the important exception of taxation, with which I shall deal last,\r\nno other power which should properly be reserved to the Imperial\r\nParliament, or delegated to the Irish Parliament, has any appreciable\r\nbearing upon the exclusion of Irish Members from the House of Commons.\r\nNor do any of them raise issues which are likely to be troublesome.\r\nCommon sense and mutual convenience should decide them. The Army, Navy,\r\nand other military forces I have already dealt with. The Crown, the\r\nLord-Lieutenant, War and Peace, Prize and Booty of War, Foreign\r\nRelations and Treaties (with the exception of commercial Treaties),\r\nTitles, Extradition, Neutrality,[86] and Treason, are subjects upon\r\nwhich the Colonies have no power to legislate or act, and of which it\r\nwould be needless, strictly, to make any formal statutory exception in\r\nthe case of Ireland, though the exception no doubt will be made in the\r\nBill. Naturalization, Coinage, Copyright, Patents, Trademarks, are all\r\nmatters in which the Colonies have local powers, whose existence, and\r\nthe limitations attaching to them, are determined either solely by\r\nconstitutional custom or with the addition of an implied or express\r\nstatutory authority.[87] The two former would, I should think, be wholly\r\nreserved to the Imperial Parliament. In the case of the latter three,\r\nwhich were wholly reserved in the Bill of 1886 and 1893, Ireland might\r\nbe placed in the position of a self-governing Colony.[88]\r\n\r\nIn Trade and Navigation it would be wise to take the same course. The\r\nHome Rule Bill of 1886, without giving Ireland representation at\r\nWestminster, denied her all powers over Trade and Navigation. The Bill\r\nof 1893 gave her powers over Trade within Ireland and Inland Navigation,\r\nand these powers at any rate should be given in the coming Bill,\r\ntogether with the larger functions also; though Ireland would naturally\r\nleave in operation the great bulk of the statutes concerned, since they\r\nintimately affect the commercial and industrial relations of the two\r\ncountries. For the rest, Ireland no more than the Colonies can be freed\r\nfrom a measure of Imperial control maintained by Acts like the Merchant\r\nShipping Act of 1894.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service in Ireland should, as in the Bill of 1886, come under\r\nIrish control.\r\n\r\nIn the Home Rule Bill of 1893 (Section 34) it was laid down that for\r\nthree years the Irish Legislature should not \"pass an Act respecting the\r\nrelations of landlord or tenant, or the sale, purchase, or letting of\r\nland generally.\" Such a provision repeated in the coming Bill would be\r\ninconsistent with the absence of Irish Members from Westminster. But I\r\ntake it for granted that there is no question of its repetition. At\r\nfirst it might appear that Land Purchase should be distinguished from\r\nother branches of land legislation and reserved to the Imperial\r\nGovernment on the ground that it needs Imperial credit. I shall deal\r\nwith this point fully in Chapter XIV., and only need here to express the\r\nview that Land Purchase cannot be separated from other branches of land\r\nlegislation, or from the Congested Districts Board, or even from the\r\ncontrol of the police, and that we are bound to give, and shall be\r\nacting wisely in giving, all these powers to the Irish Legislature from\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary perhaps to add that non-representation at Westminster\r\ndoes not in the smallest degree affect the complete legal supremacy of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament over the subordinate Irish Legislature. This\r\nLegislature will in legal language be a \"local and territorial\" body,\r\nlike those of the Colonies. It will be the creature of Parliament, and\r\ncould be amended or even extinguished by it in a subsequent Act. The\r\nBill of 1886 (perhaps because it never reached the Committee stage) said\r\nnothing explicit about the supremacy, though the Bill of 1893, while\r\nproviding for representation at Westminster, repeatedly (and sometimes\r\nquite superfluously) affirmed it--in the Preamble, for example, and in a\r\nrider to Clause 2. The King's authority, through the Lord-Lieutenant,\r\nwill be supreme in Ireland, as, through the Governors, it is supreme in\r\nthe Colonies. Every Irish Bill, like every Colonial Bill, will require\r\nthe Royal Assent, given through the Lord-Lieutenant, who will correspond\r\nto the Colonial Governors. The Lord-Lieutenant, like his colonial\r\ncounterpart, will have to exercise both his Executive and Legislative\r\nfunctions in a double capacity: in the first instance by the advice of\r\nhis Irish Cabinet, but subject to a veto by the British Cabinet. This\r\ndual capacity has belonged to all Colonial Governors ever since the\r\nprinciple of responsible government was established. As I showed in\r\nearlier chapters, it was regarded even by Lord John Russell as\r\nimpossible and absurd as late as 1840; but it ought by now to be\r\nunderstood by every educated man, and we may hope to be spared the\r\nphilosophical disquisitions and hair-splitting criticisms which it\r\nevoked from men who should have known better in the Home Rule debates of\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nLaws framed at Westminster will be applicable to Ireland, as they are\r\nfrequently made applicable to the Colonies.[89] Conversely, only through\r\nthe express legislative authority of Westminster will an Irish, like a\r\nColonial Act,[90] be held to operate outside the borders of Ireland.\r\n\r\nApart from the strict legal omnipotence of Imperial sovereignty, it is,\r\nof course, impossible to say now what the exact constitutional position\r\nof Ireland will be under any form of Home Rule. No Bill can state it\r\nfully in set terms. Time, custom, and judicial decisions will build up a\r\nbody of doctrine. It is so with the Colonies, whose exact constitutional\r\nrelations with the Mother Country are still a matter of juristic debate,\r\nand are only to be deduced from the study of an immense number of\r\njudicial decisions and of Imperial Acts passed subsequently to the grant\r\nof the original Constitutions. Some of these Acts I have already\r\nillustrated. The one Act of general application, namely, the Colonial\r\nLaws Validity Act, cannot be read without the rest, though in form it\r\nappears to contain a complete set of rules. While giving general power\r\nto a self-governing Colony \"to make laws for the peace, welfare, and\r\ngood government of the Colony\" (words which will also necessarily appear\r\nin the Home Rule Bill), the Act makes void all colonial laws or parts of\r\nlaws which are \"repugnant to the provisions of any Act of Parliament\r\nextending to the Colony to which such law shall relate,\" and this\r\nprovision will no doubt, be applied, _mutatis mutandis,_ to Ireland, as\r\nit was in Section 32 of the Home Rule Bill of 1893. The Irish\r\nLegislature, that is, will be able \"to repeal or alter any enactments in\r\nforce in Ireland except such as either relate to matters beyond the\r\npower of the Irish Legislature, or, being enacted by Parliament after\r\nthe passing of this Act, may be expressly extended to Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the words \"beyond the power of the Irish\r\nLegislature\" referred to the subjects expressly excepted in the Bill\r\nitself. This is one of the points in which the Irish Constitution will\r\nbear at any rate a superficial resemblance to that of a Province or\r\nState within a Federation rather than to that of a self-governing\r\nColony. The practice of expressly, and in the text of a Constitution,\r\nforbidding a self-governing Colony to legislate upon certain subjects,\r\nor of expressly reserving concurrent or exclusive powers of legislation\r\nto the Mother Country, has fallen into disuse since the establishment of\r\nthe principle of responsible government. Such restrictions were inserted\r\nin the Canadian Union Act of 1840, where the old right of the Mother\r\nCountry to impose customs duties in the Colonies for the regulation of\r\ncommerce was reaffirmed, and even in the Acts of 1855 for giving full\r\npowers of self-government to the Australian Colonies, which were\r\nforbidden to impose intercolonial customs, though they were expressly\r\ngranted the power of imposing any other customs duties they pleased,[91]\r\nbut they do not appear in modern Constitutions, for example in the\r\nTransvaal Constitution of 1906. As I have indicated, this implies no\r\nchange in the strict legal theory of Colonial subordination to the\r\nMother Country; for, although the tendency of modern juristic thought is\r\nto ascribe \"plenary\" power to a Colony, restrictions nevertheless do\r\nexist in practice, and are contained, express or implicit, in a number\r\nof disjointed Acts.\r\n\r\nA Federating Colony, on the other hand, like a foreign Federation, has\r\nin its own self-made, domestic Constitution to apportion powers with\r\nsome approach to precision between the federal and the provincial\r\nauthorities, and in this respect the Irish Bill, in reserving certain\r\npowers to the Imperial Parliament, will resemble a federating Bill, and\r\nit should follow the American and Australian precedents in leaving\r\nresiduary powers to the subordinate or Irish Legislature, not, in\r\naccordance with the Canadian precedent, to the Parliament at\r\nWestminster. That is an indispensable corollary of excluding Irish\r\nMembers from Westminster.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of powers reserved or delegated, and of residuary or\r\nunallocated powers, I have thus far referred only to powers which must\r\nbe exercised, or at any rate may need to be exercised, if not by the\r\nsubordinate legislature, then by the superior Parliament. Those\r\nrestrictions on the Irish Legislature which are imposed in order to\r\nprotect the religious or economic interests of a minority within the\r\nState, or as a recognition that there are certain kinds of laws which it\r\nis morally wrong to pass, fall into an altogether different category. By\r\nimplication they morally bind the superior Parliament too, and are\r\nirrelevant, therefore, to the question of representation. They will be\r\nnecessary, no doubt, in the coming Irish Bill, though they need not be\r\nso extensive as those which are to be found in Clause 4 of the Bill of\r\n1893, some of which are borrowed from the famous anti-slavery amendments\r\nof 1865-1869 to the Constitution of the United States.[92] In inserting\r\nthem we shall again be following the \"Federal\" rather than the\r\n\"Colonial\" model. No such restrictions have been imposed by the Mother\r\nCountry upon any self-governing Colony. The nearest approach, perhaps,\r\nto such a tendency was the provision in the Transvaal Constitution of\r\n1906 (Section 39), that \"any law whereby persons not of European birth\r\nor descent may be subjected or made liable to any disabilities or\r\nrestrictions to which persons of European birth or descent are not also\r\nsubjected or made liable\" should be specially \"reserved\"--that is, sent\r\nhome by the Governor--for the signification of the Royal pleasure; but\r\nno similar provision appeared in the Act of 1909 for constituting the\r\nSouth African Union. In Federal systems, on the other hand, such\r\nrestrictions, taking the form of self-denying ordinances, are common,\r\nwhether appearing in the Federal Constitution itself or in the\r\nsubordinate State Constitutions. The Constitution of the United States,\r\nfor example, in addition to the anti-slavery provisions noted above,\r\nenacts that the National Government cannot (by Amendment I.) establish\r\nany religion or prohibit its free exercise, or (by Amendment V.) take\r\nprivate property for public use without just compensation, or (by\r\nArticle 1, § 9) grant a title of nobility. Neither (by Amendment XIV.\r\nand Article 1, § 10 respectively) can a State do these things. By\r\nArticle 1, § 10, a State cannot pass a law impairing the obligation of a\r\ncontract. Exactly similar restrictions appear in many of the individual\r\nState Constitutions. Others forbid the establishment of any church or\r\nsect; the introduction of armed men \"for the suppression of domestic\r\nviolence\"; \"perpetuities or monopolies,\" and a variety of other things.\r\nAnalogous provisions are to be found in the British North America Act,\r\n1867 (constituting the Dominion of Canada), where the provincial\r\nLegislatures are forbidden to interfere with certain rights and\r\nprivileges of religious bodies in the matter of education. There are no\r\nlimitations of the kind in the Australian Commonwealth Act of 1900.\r\nAustralia, no doubt, correctly represents the tendency of modern thought\r\non this matter. Some of the American safeguards have produced great\r\ninconvenience. Nor can it be denied that the most elaborately contrived\r\nlegal safeguards are of less value than the moral safeguard afforded by\r\nthe sense of honour, justice, and prudence in the community. The\r\nexistence of these qualities in Ireland, as in other white countries, is\r\nthe true foundation of Home Rule. Some day Irishmen will ask, as a\r\nunited country, for the repeal of these statutory safeguards.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to the penultimate point of importance, which may be held\r\nto affect the inclusion or exclusion of Irish Members at Westminster--I\r\nmean the question of future constitutional amendment. Here the colonial\r\nanalogies are a little complicated. Since the Australian Colonies Act of\r\n1850, in the new grant of a Constitution to a self-governing Colony,\r\npower has invariably been given to amend its own Constitution, without,\r\nof course, detracting from any powers specified in it for preserving the\r\nsovereignty of the Mother Country. Canada, when federating in 1867, took\r\nthe somewhat singular course of making no provision in her Federal\r\nConstitution for its subsequent amendment, though, by Section 92 of the\r\nBritish North America Act, she gave her Provinces the exclusive right to\r\namend their own Constitutions, a right which three of them have used to\r\nabolish their Upper Chambers. The Dominion Constitution, then, cannot be\r\namended otherwise than by an Imperial Act. Such amending Acts are\r\npromoted by the Dominion Government without any specially devised\r\nmachinery for ascertaining the public opinion of Canadians. Australia,\r\non the other hand, when federating in 1900, made elaborate arrangements,\r\nwhich have been put several times into operation, for the amendment of\r\nthe Federal Constitution by the Australian people itself, without an\r\nImperial Act. Now, it will follow as a matter of course that Ireland\r\nwill be given powers, as in both the previous Bills,[93] to amend her\r\nown Constitution within certain defined limits, after a certain lapse of\r\ntime, and without encroaching upon Imperial authority. For my part I\r\nwould strongly urge that the powers now to be conferred should be much\r\nwider; for I believe that Ireland alone can make a really perfect\r\nConstitution for herself. But, that point apart, the question arises of\r\nthe further amendment, outside such permissive powers, of the Home Rule\r\nAct itself, which will, of course, contain within its four corners the\r\nwhole of the Irish Constitution, so far as it can be written down. No\r\nspecial arrangements were made for such a contingency in the Bill of\r\n1893, presumably because Ireland was to be represented at Westminster\r\nand would have a share in the making of any amending act. In the Bill of\r\n1886, which excluded the Irish Members, Mr. Gladstone proposed (in\r\nClause 39) that no alteration of the Act should be made (apart, of\r\ncourse, from points left for Irish alteration) except (1) by an Imperial\r\nAct formally assented to by the Irish Legislature, or (2) by an Imperial\r\nAct for the passing of which a stated number of Members of both branches\r\nof the Irish Legislature should be summoned to sit at Westminster.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear, I think, now, in 1911, that this latter proposal is\r\nnot worth revival. No substantial amendment of the Act should properly\r\nbe made without the formal consent of the Irish Legislature,\r\nrepresenting Irish public opinion, and the prior consultation with the\r\nIrish Cabinet which such consent would imply. If the lamentable\r\nnecessity ever arose of amending the Act against the wishes of Ireland,\r\nthe sudden invasion of Westminster by a body of angry Irish Members, too\r\nsmall to affect the result (for otherwise the attempt to amend would not\r\nbe made) and large enough to revive the old political dislocation and\r\npassion, would not simplify the process of amendment or be of value to\r\nanybody concerned. The proposal was probably only suggested by a vague\r\nleaning towards the Federal principle, which, in the present case, we\r\nshould certainly reject. It serves indeed as one more illustration of\r\nthe anomalies which might result from the inclusion of Irish Members at\r\nWestminster. No more unhealthy position could be imagined than one which\r\nwould render it possible for an amendment of the Home Rule Act, whether\r\nin the direction of greater latitude or of stricter limitation, to\r\ndepend solely upon the Irish vote in an Assembly predominately\r\nnon-Irish. That is not to the discredit of Ireland. The system would be\r\njust as indefensible, whatever the subordinate State concerned. It would\r\nbe Federalism run mad, and would make Alexander Hamilton turn in his\r\ngrave. It is worth while to note that, even under a sane and normal\r\nFederal system, the Irish Constitution would be less easily alterable in\r\neither direction than under the plan of treating her as a self-governing\r\nColony. In the latter case action is direct and simple, while most\r\nFederal Constitutions are extraordinarily difficult to amend. The\r\nDominion of Canada is only an apparent exception.\r\n\r\nI turn lastly to Finance, the point which most closely affects\r\nrepresentation at Westminster, and which distinguishes any form of\r\nquasi-Federal Home Rule most sharply from its alternative, \"Colonial\"\r\nHome Rule.\r\n\r\nAll Federal systems necessarily involve a certain amount of joint\r\nfinance between the superior and the inferior Government. The\r\ndistribution of financial powers varies widely in different Federations,\r\nbut all have this feature in common--that the central or superior\r\nGovernment controls Customs and Excise, and is to a large degree\r\nfinanced by means of the revenue derived from those sources. The United\r\nStates Government, as distinguished from that of the individual States,\r\npays in this way for almost its entire expenditure.[94] So does the\r\nDominion of Canada;[95] while in the Australian Commonwealth the\r\nreceipts from Customs and Excise alone more than cover the whole\r\nCommonwealth expenditure.[96]\r\n\r\nFinance makes or mars Federations. Some Federations or organic Unions of\r\nindependent States have come into being through a strong desire in the\r\nseparate States to have, among other things, a common system of Customs,\r\nand in the case of the German Empire and the South African Union a\r\nCustoms Union or _Zollverein_ has preceded Federation. These phenomena\r\nare the most marked illustration of the general truth that a common\r\ndesire to federate, or unite, on the part of individual States is a\r\ncondition precedent to a sound Federation or Union. On the other hand,\r\nfinance, especially the question of joint Customs, has sometimes\r\npresented obstacles to a Federation which, on other grounds, was\r\nearnestly desired. The long delay in achieving the Australian Federation\r\nwas largely due to the desire of New South Wales to maintain her Free\r\nTrade system, while the financial arrangements generally caused most of\r\nthe practical difficulties met with in arranging the Federation both of\r\nCanada and Australia, and in their subsequent domestic relations. Nova\r\nScotia in the former case, and Western Australia in the latter, held out\r\nto the last instant, and the former subsequently had to receive\r\nexceptionally favourable treatment. In both Federations some measure of\r\nfriction is chronic, and in neither has a perfectly satisfactory system\r\nbeen evolved. The Union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1800 was in this\r\nrespect, as in all others, a flagrant departure from sound principle.\r\nThe Customs Union which followed it was a forced Customs Union, and,\r\ntogether with the other financial arrangements between the two\r\ncountries, has produced results incredibly absurd and mischievous. Some\r\nof these results I briefly indicated in Chapter V. In the following\r\nchapters I shall tell the whole story fully, and I hope to convince the\r\nreader that we should follow, not only historically, but morally and\r\npractically, the correct line of action if, in dissolving the\r\nLegislative Union, we dissolve the Customs Union also. That would\r\ninvolve a virtually independent system of finance for Ireland, and place\r\nher fiscally in the position of a self-governing Colony. If and when a\r\nreal Federation of the United Kingdom becomes practical politics, she\r\nwould then have the choice of entering it in the spirit and on the terms\r\ninvariably associated with all true Federations or Unions. That is, she\r\nwould voluntarily relinquish, in her own interest, financial and other\r\nrights to a central Government solely concerned with central affairs.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely point out in this connection the vital importance of the\r\nquestion of representation at Westminster. Ireland resembles the\r\nself-governing Colonies, and differs from Great Britain, in that the\r\ngreater part of the revenue raised from her inhabitants is derived from\r\nCustoms and Excise--that is, from the indirect taxation of commodities\r\nof common use. If she is denied control of these sources of revenue\r\nunder the coming Bill, it will be absolutely necessary, in spite of all\r\nthe concomitant difficulties, to give her a representation at\r\nWestminster which is as effective as it can be made. But let it be\r\nrealized that we could not make her control over her own finance as\r\neffective as that exercised by a small State within a Federation,\r\nbecause such a State, however small, has equal, or at any rate\r\ndisproportionately large, representation in the Federal Upper Chamber,\r\nand Federal Upper Chambers can reject Money Bills. The Upper Chamber in\r\nIreland's case would be the House of Lords, where she could scarcely be\r\ngiven effective representation, and which, in any case, cannot reject\r\nMoney Bills.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine Ireland's claim for fiscal autonomy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] See p. 140.\r\n\r\n[74] The Bill set up a Council of eighty-two elected and twenty-four\r\nnominated members, with the Under-Secretary as an _ex-officio_ member.\r\nSo far it resembled the abortive Transvaal Constitution of 1905 (see p.\r\n130), but the Irish Council was only to be given control of certain\r\nspecified Departments, and was financed by a fixed Imperial grant. It\r\nwas to have no power of legislation or taxation, and was under the\r\ncomplete control of the Lord-Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n[75] This arrangement, which is peculiar to the Canadian Federation, is\r\nregarded by some authorities as a somewhat serious infraction of the\r\nFederal principle, since it seems to imply executive control of the\r\nProvince by the central Government. The Governors of the States in the\r\nAustralian Federation are appointed by the Home Government.\r\n\r\n[76] The Judicial Committee has ruled \"that the relation between the\r\nCrown and the Provinces is the same as that between the Crown and\r\nDominion in respect of such powers, executive and legislative, as are\r\nvested in them respectively.\" (Maritime Bank of Canada _v._\r\nReceiver-General of New Brunswick, 1892).\r\n\r\n[77] They are governed by Executive Committees, the members of which\r\nneed not be members of the Councils.\r\n\r\n[78] In writing upon this subject, I am indebted to an able paper by Mr.\r\nBasil Williams, which is to be found in \"Home Rule Problems.\"\r\n\r\n[79] \"Life of Parnell,\" R. Barry O'Brien, pp. 149 and 139-141.\r\n\r\n[80] _E.g._, in 1893, on Clause I. of the Home Rule Bill (Hansard, p.\r\n490): \"The Irish minority were willing to be treated on the footing of a\r\nColony, but they protested against a supremacy which would enable the\r\nhonourable gentleman who formed the Irish Government to appeal to the\r\nImperial Parliament for the assistance of the Army and Navy to compel\r\nthe Irish minority to obey their behests.\"\r\n\r\n[81] Cd. 5741, 1911. Some of the subjects discussed were Commercial\r\nRelations and Shipping, Navigation Law, Labour Exchanges, Uniformity in\r\nCopyright, etc., Emigration, Naturalization, Compensation for Accidents,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[82] I am summarizing facts fully narrated in Chapters XI. and XII.\r\n\r\n[83] In the Federal Constitutions of Australia and Canada the central\r\nFederal Parliament is responsible for the colonial defences, but the\r\nProvinces or States are, of course, represented in the Federal\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n[84] Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, 1900, Sec. 58, and\r\nBritish North America Act, 1867, Sec. 15. Until quite recently it was\r\nthe custom always to give the command of the Canadian Militia to a\r\nBritish officer lent to Canada. The present Commander, however, is a\r\nCanadian.\r\n\r\n[85] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[86] A Colony may make local regulations to carry out an Imperial Law\r\nabout extradition and neutrality, but may not touch the law.\r\n\r\n[87] For the constitutional position of self-governing Colonies, the\r\nauthor owes much to Mr. Moore's \"Commonwealth of Australia.\"\r\n\r\n[88] The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, 1900, and the\r\nBritish North America Act, 1867, in order to delimit the respective\r\npowers of the Federal and Provincial Legislatures, set out a list of\r\nsubjects on which the Federal Parliament has exclusive or collateral\r\npower to legislate. There is implied, of course, a pre-existing right on\r\nthe part of the Colony, as a whole, _qua_ Colony, to legislate on the\r\nmatters referred to in the list. But the pre-existing right is subject\r\nto any pre-existing constitutional or statutory limitations. _E.g.,_\r\n\"Naturalization and Aliens\" is in the list of Commonwealth powers (Sec.\r\n51, xix.), and of the Canadian powers (Sec. 91, xxv.), but the power of\r\nany Colony is limited by Acts of 1847 and 1879 to giving naturalization\r\nwithin its own borders. (At the Imperial Conference of 1911 a scheme was\r\nforeshadowed for standardizing naturalization throughout the Empire.)\r\n\r\n\"Copyright\" is also in both lists, but the colonial power is limited by\r\nthe International Copyright Act of 1886, which, by Sec. 8, implies that\r\na \"British possession\" may only make laws \"respecting the Copyright\r\nwithin the limits of such possession of works produced in that\r\npossession.\" This Copyright Act is an example of implied limitation and\r\nsanction together. The Coinage Act of 1853 is an example of implied\r\nsanction only, in empowering a Colony to legislate as if the Act had not\r\nbeen passed. Another class of Imperial Acts confers _direct_ powers to\r\nlegislate on certain subjects--_e.g.,_ the Australian Colonies Custom\r\nDuties Act of 1873 (removing the restrictions imposed upon intercolonial\r\nduties in 1850). The Naturalization Acts are partly of this character,\r\nand other examples are the Colonial Naval Defence Act of 1865, and\r\ncertain provisions of the Army Act of 1881, and the Colonial Courts of\r\nAdmiralty Act of 1890.\r\n\r\n[89] _E.g.,_ Colonial Attorneys Belief Act, 1857; Colonial Probates Act,\r\n1892; parts of the Finance Act, 1894; and Wills Act, 1861.\r\n\r\n[90] _E.g.,_ Colonial Laws made under sanction of the following Imperial\r\nActs: Colonial Prisoners Removal, 1869; Merchant Shipping, 1894;\r\nSections 478 and 736, Colonial Marriages, 1866.\r\n\r\n[91] _E.g.,_ 18 Vict. Ch. 55, Sections 42 and 43.\r\n\r\n[92] See Appendix, under the head of restrictions on \"Irish Matters.\"\r\nFor convenience, land legislation is included in the list, though it\r\nclearly belongs to a different category, and I have so dealt with it\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[93] In the Bill of 1886 (Clause 11, Subsec. 7) and in the Bill of 1893\r\n(Clause 8, Subsec. 3) power was given to alter the qualifications of the\r\nfranchise, etc., for the Lower House--in the former Bill after the first\r\ndissolution, in the latter after six years.\r\n\r\n[94] In 1910, of the total Federal revenue of 675,511,715 dollars,\r\n623,616,963 dollars were raised in this way, or twelve-thirteenths.\r\n(Postal revenue, which balances Postal receipts, is excluded.)\r\n\r\n[95] In 1909-10 Dominion revenue from Customs and Excise was 75,409,487\r\ndollars.

None of it is irrelevant, I venture to\r\nsay. It is not possible to construct a financial scheme, or to criticize\r\nit when framed, without a fairly accurate knowledge of the historical\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE UNION.[97]\r\n\r\nBefore the Union Ireland had a fiscal system distinct from that of Great\r\nBritain, a separate Exchequer, a separate Debt, a separate system of\r\ntaxation, a separate Budget. Yet she can never truly be said to have had\r\nfinancial independence, because she was never a truly self-governing\r\ncountry. Until 1779, when the Protestant Volunteers protested with arms\r\nin their hands against the annihilation of Irish industries in the\r\ninterest of British merchants and growers, her external trade and,\r\nconsequently, her internal production, were absolutely at the mercy of\r\nGreat Britain. As I showed in Chapter I., Ireland was treated\r\nconsiderably worse than the most oppressed Colony, with permanently\r\nruinous results. On the other hand, her internal taxation, never above a\r\nmillion a year, and her Debt, never above two millions in amount, were\r\nnot heavy. But from 1779, through Grattan's Parliament to the Union, a\r\nshort period of twenty-one years, Ireland, though still governed on the\r\nascendancy system by an unrepresentative and corrupt Parliament of\r\nexactly the same composition as before, nevertheless had financial\r\nindependence in the sense that her Parliament had complete control of\r\nIrish taxation, revenue, and trade. It was, moreover, in these financial\r\nmatters that the Parliament showed most genuine national patriotism,\r\ntogether with a greatly enhanced measure of the Imperial patriotism\r\ntraditional with it. Internal taxation, except in time of war, was still\r\ncomparatively light; depressed home industries were judiciously\r\nencouraged by bounties; no attempt was made at vindictive retaliation\r\nupon British imports, though Irish exports to Great Britain were still\r\nunmercifully penalized; and sums, growing to a relatively enormous size\r\nduring the French War, which began in 1793, were annually voted for the\r\nImperial forces. This voluntary contribution, which had averaged\r\n£585,000 in the eleven years of peace, from 1783 to 1793, rose to\r\n£3,401,760 in 1797,[98] and in 1799, when Ireland was paying the bill\r\nfor British troops called in to suppress her own Rebellion, to\r\n£4,596,762, out of a total Irish expenditure for the year on all\r\npurposes, military and civil, of £6,854,804. Not more than half, on the\r\naverage, of these war expenses were met out of the annual taxes. Debt\r\nwas created to meet the balance; but neither the debt, heavy as it was,\r\nnor the taxes, were intolerably burdensome--that is, if we regard\r\nIreland as financially responsible for Imperial wars and for the\r\nsuppression of a Rebellion which was provoked by scandalous\r\nmisgovernment. Tax revenue rose from £1,106,504 in 1783, when the free\r\nParliament first prepared a Budget, to £3,017,758 in 1800, and averaged\r\na million and a half. In the same period the total amount of the funded\r\nand unfunded Irish Debt rose from £1,917,784 to £28,541,157, almost the\r\nwhole of this increase having taken place in the seven years of war\r\nimmediately preceding the Union. In Great Britain both Debt and taxation\r\nhad risen in a larger ratio, and were relatively far greater. For\r\nexample, in the six years, 1793-1798 inclusive, £186,000,000 had been\r\nadded to the British Debt, only £14,000,000 to the Irish Debt. In 1801\r\nthe British Debt stood at £489,127,057; the Irish Debt at £32,215,223.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE UNION TO THE FINANCIAL RELATIONS COMMISSION OF 1894-1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Union of 1800, therefore, could not be justified on the ground that\r\na poor country would profit by fiscal amalgamation with a rich country,\r\nand Pitt and Castlereagh, when framing the Union Act, recognized that\r\ntruth by leaving Ireland with a separate fiscal system, as before;\r\nthough the administration of this system was, of course, now to be\r\nwholly in British hands. There were to be separate Exchequers,\r\nDebts,[99] taxes, and balance-sheets, with the following restrictions:\r\nThat prohibitions against imports and bounties on exports (corn\r\nexcepted), should cease reciprocally in both countries; that, with the\r\nexception of 10 per cent. ad valorem duties on a variety of articles\r\nnamed, there should be mutual free trade; and that no tax on any article\r\nof consumption should be higher in Ireland than in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBut although Pitt and Castlereagh ostensibly carried out the principle\r\nof separate fiscal systems, they laid the foundations for a fiscal\r\namalgamation which was disastrous to Ireland. Since his Commercial\r\nPropositions of 1785, Pitt had never abandoned the idea of obtaining\r\nfrom Ireland an obligatory annual contribution to Imperial services\r\nbased on some fixed principle. By Clause 7 of the Act of Union he\r\nachieved his aim. It was settled that for twenty years Ireland should\r\ncontribute in the proportion of 1 to 71/2 (or 2 to 15)--that is, that\r\nGreat Britain should pay 15/17, or 88.24 per cent., of common Imperial\r\nexpenses, including the charge for debt contracted for Imperial\r\nservices, and Ireland 2/17, or 11.76 per cent. Nobody now denies that\r\nthis ratio was grossly unjust to Ireland. It took no account of the\r\nrelative pre-Union Debts; it took no account of the tribute of nearly\r\nfour millions paid in rents to absentee English proprietors; it was\r\nbased on superficial deductions from inadequate and misleading data, and\r\nthe Act was hardly passed before its absurdity became manifest. Fifteen\r\nyears of almost incessant war followed the Union. Ireland, even by\r\nraising taxation to the highest possible point, was unable to pay her\r\ncontribution without contracting a Debt colossal in proportion to her\r\nresources. While Great Britain only doubled her Debt, and paid 71 per\r\ncent. of her expenses out of current taxation, the Irish Debt\r\nquadrupled, and in 1817 reached the portentous total of £112,634,773;\r\nwhile only 49 per cent. of Irish expenditure was paid for out of\r\nrevenue. Here is a little table which shows the effect upon Ireland of\r\nClause 7 of the Act of Union:\r\n\r\n                Five Years.              Average            Average\r\n                                         Revenue.

It was impossible to raise\r\nthe Irish taxes. Their yield was already showing signs of diminishing.\r\nBut the Act of Union had provided for the situation which had arisen.\r\nOne of the sections of the famous Clause 7 enacted that if and when the\r\nseparate Debts of the two countries should reach the proportion of their\r\nrespective Imperial contributions, Parliament might, if it thought fit,\r\ndeclare that all future expenses of the United Kingdom should be\r\ndefrayed indiscriminately by equal taxes imposed on the same articles in\r\nboth countries, \"_subject only to such exemptions and abatements in\r\nfavour of Ireland as circumstances may appear from time to time to\r\ndemand_.\" The framers of this section had anticipated that the English\r\nDebt would sink to the level of the Irish Debt. Anglo-Irish finance\r\nteems with grim jokes of this sort; but the section was useful in either\r\nevent. With its terms before them, a Committee sat to consider the state\r\nof Ireland, with the result that, by an Act which came into operation on\r\nJanuary 5, 1817, the Exchequers, Debts, revenues, and expenditures, but\r\nnot as yet the taxes, of the two countries were amalgamated. In\r\nProfessor Oldham's words,[100] \"the corpse of Ireland's insolvency was\r\nhuddled into the grave, and no questions were to be asked.\" The whole\r\nexpenditure, Imperial and local, of the United Kingdom, Ireland\r\nincluded, was to be defrayed out of a Consolidated Fund, and the\r\narrangements, therefore, for a separate Irish contribution on a fixed\r\nbasis to Imperial services were cancelled. Henceforth her Imperial\r\ncontribution, for anyone who troubled to calculate it, was represented\r\nby the excess of revenue raised within Ireland over the expenditure in\r\nIreland. A mutual free trade was also established, not instantaneously,\r\nbut in the course of a few years. By 1824 all duties, as between Ireland\r\nand England, had ceased, and in 1826 the custom-houses ceased to record\r\nthe transit of goods between England and Ireland, except in articles\r\nsuch as spirits, on which a different excise duty was charged. No\r\nstatistics were compiled, therefore, of Anglo-Irish trade until ninety\r\nyears later, when the Irish Department of Agriculture began to prepare\r\nreturns. Such was the origin of our Customs Union against the world\r\n(for, needless to say, those were still the days of high Protection),\r\nand it is instructive to compare it with the voluntary pacts of the\r\nGerman States and South African Colonies, and with their political\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn one important point unification was left incomplete. It was\r\nimpossible in 1817 to equalize internal taxation in the two countries,\r\nthough it was held desirable to do so, because Ireland could not have\r\nborne the higher British scale, and suffered enough under her own.\r\nRegard, too, was had at first to those important words in the Act of\r\nUnion which guaranteed to Ireland such \"exemptions and abatements\" as\r\nmight appear fair. But they were soon forgotten. Without any inquiry\r\ninto the taxable capacity of Ireland, the stamp, tea, and tobacco duties\r\nwere equalized early in the period, the enhancement in Ireland of the\r\nlast duty from 1s. to 3s. on raw tobacco, and from 1s. to 16s. on\r\nmanufactured tobacco, laying an exceptionally heavy burden on the Irish\r\npoor. Meanwhile the abolition, after the close of the war, of taxes\r\nrepresenting about sixteen millions a year, and purely affecting Great\r\nBritain, gave a relief to her which Ireland did not feel. But it was not\r\nuntil 1853, when Mr. Gladstone extended the income-tax to Ireland, and\r\nraised the Irish spirit duty, that the principle of \"exemptions and\r\nabatements\" was most seriously infringed. Mr. Disraeli followed in 1855\r\nwith a further elevation of the spirit duty, which was finally equalized\r\nwith the British duty in 1858, at 8s. a gallon; while in 1860 both\r\nduties were raised to 10s. In the seven years 1853-1860 the taxation of\r\nIreland was raised by no less than two and a half millions per annum. It\r\nwill be recalled that the great famine had taken place in 1846-47, and\r\nthat between the Census of 1841 and that of 1861 the population sank\r\nfrom eight to six millions, while the British population rose from\r\neighteen and a half to twenty-three millions. The statistical result of\r\nthe increased taxes, therefore, was to show a rise in taxation per head\r\nof the Irish people from 13s. 11d. in 1849 to £1 5s. 4d. in 1859, while\r\nin Great Britain it rose only from £2 7s. 8d. to £2 10s. during the same\r\nperiod. Equality of taxation has never been wholly established, for to\r\nthis day a few quite unimportant taxes are not levied, or are levied on\r\na lower scale in Ireland;[101] but from 1858 onward we may regard the\r\ntaxation of the two countries as almost identically the same.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a great revolution, also beginning at the time of the\r\nfamine, had taken place in the fiscal system of the United Kingdom. Free\r\nTrade with the outside world had been established, and whatever we may\r\nconclude about its effect, it had been established, as we know, with a\r\nspecial view to British industrial interests, and without the smallest\r\nconcern for Irish interests, which were predominantly agricultural. It\r\nwas certainly followed by an immense industrial expansion and prosperity\r\nin Great Britain; it was certainly initiated at the lowest point of\r\nIreland's moral and physical wretchedness. Opinions differ as to the\r\nprecise economic effect upon Ireland. Miss Murray, in her thoughtful and\r\nexhaustive study of the commercial relations between England and\r\nIreland, holds that, as agricultural producers, the Irish lost far more\r\nthan they have gained as consumers of foodstuffs, while a number of\r\nsmall and struggling rural industries, whose powerful counterparts in\r\nGreat Britain could easily withstand foreign competition, did undeniably\r\nsuccumb in Ireland.\r\n\r\nMy own opinion is that the past influence upon Ireland of free trade, in\r\nthe first instance with Great Britain, and later with the outside world,\r\nthough a highly interesting and important topic in itself, is commonly\r\nexaggerated, to the neglect of the vastly more important question of the\r\ntenure of land. Free trade did not cause the famine. On the contrary,\r\nthe presage of the famine was one of the minor causes which induced Peel\r\nto take up Cobden's policy for the free importation of foodstuffs. The\r\neffect of that policy upon Ireland sinks into insignificance beside an\r\nagrarian system which had reduced the mass of the Irish peasants to\r\nserfs, kept them near the borders of destitution, and in a state of\r\nsporadic crime for a century and a half before, and for forty years\r\nafter the repeal of the Corn Laws, and, at the climax of a period of\r\nhigh protection for agricultural products, rendered it possible for a\r\nmere failure of the potato-crop to cause death to three-quarters of a\r\nmillion persons. These things do not happen in properly governed, in\r\nother words in self-governed, countries, whatever their fiscal system,\r\nand they have never happened to Irishmen in any other part of the world\r\nbut in their own fertile island. Manufacturing industries stand on a\r\ndifferent footing. Most of the staple industries of Ireland, notably the\r\nwoollen industry, and the aptitudes which brought them into being, were\r\ndeliberately destroyed long ago by fiscal measures imposed by England,\r\nand their destruction aggravated the misery and exhaustion produced by a\r\nbad land system. How far their partial revival under the fiscal Home\r\nRule of Grattan's Parliament was genuine, and might, with a continuance\r\nof fiscal Home Rule, have been permanent, it is impossible to say. The\r\nretarding effect of the Rebellion, and the long start already obtained\r\nby Great Britain in the industrial race, are factors beyond accurate\r\ncalculation. But one thing is certain, that the revival of industries\r\nwas, at that stage, of trivial importance beside the rural regeneration\r\nof Ireland, and that Grattan's Parliament had not the remotest influence\r\nfor good upon the land question, which it neglected as heartlessly as\r\nits predecessors for a century before and its successors for seventy\r\nyears afterwards.[102]\r\n\r\nIndustries are valuable assets for any country; but countries almost\r\nwholly agricultural, like Denmark, can prosper remarkably, and without\r\nProtection, provided that they possess or evolve a sound system of\r\nagrarian tenure, in other words, a sound relation between tenant and\r\nlandlord, or, in default of that, peasant ownership. In every country in\r\nthe world that has been a _sine qua non_ of prosperity. Suppose that\r\nEnglish labourers had built out of their own money and by their own\r\nhands the factories, docks, and railways in which they worked, and that\r\nthe resulting profits, wages deducted, went solely to ground landlords.\r\nThat gives us some idea of the old Irish land system, whose overthrowal\r\nbegan only in 1870; a system under which the landlord put no capital\r\ninto the land, though his rent represented the full profits of the\r\ntenant's capital and labour, less an amount equivalent to a bare\r\nsubsistence wage, governed by competition.\r\n\r\nThe present influence upon Ireland of the Imperial fiscal system, now\r\nthat peasant proprietorship has been half accomplished, is another\r\nmatter upon which I shall have to say more presently, when we have\r\ncompleted our review of Anglo-Irish finance. Let us return to the point\r\nwe had reached: that free trade with the outside world and the\r\nequalization of taxation between Great Britain and Ireland approximately\r\ncoincided in point of time, and were also contemporaneous with rapid and\r\ncontinuous growth in the wealth and population of Great Britain, and a\r\nsteady and continuous decline in the Irish population. We know now,\r\nmoreover, though nobody knew it then, because the calculation was not\r\nyet made, that Ireland was paying a large contribution to Imperial\r\nservices, over and above her local expenditure. In the half-century\r\nbetween 1810 and 1860 she had paid an average yearly sum of nearly four\r\nmillions, and a total sum of nearly two hundred millions. In the year\r\n1859-60, when the now equalized spirit duties were raised to 10s., she\r\npaid £5,396,000; a sum considerably more than double the expenditure on\r\nIrish services, and equivalent to no less than five-sevenths of the\r\nrevenue raised in Ireland.\r\n\r\nParliament gave no serious attention to any of these phenomena from the\r\ntime of the fiscal union in 1817 until after the introduction of Mr.\r\nGladstone's second Home Rule Bill in 1893. No settled conclusions were\r\narrived at as to the relative wealth of the two countries, as to the\r\ncapacity of Ireland to bear the British scale of taxation, or even as to\r\nthe amount of revenue derived from and expended in the countries\r\nrespectively, with the consequent contributions made to common Imperial\r\nservices. A Committee sat in 1864-65, which compiled some interesting\r\ninformation and heard some important witnesses, but ignored the main\r\nquestions at issue and produced what Sir Edward Hamilton described later\r\nas an \"impotent\" Report. Sir Joseph MacKenna, an able Irish banker,\r\nagain and again, between 1867 and 1876, pleaded for an inquiry into\r\nAnglo-Irish finance, alleging gross injustice in the incidence of Irish\r\ntaxation, and obtained nothing more than a rough return showing that\r\nbetween 1841 and 1871 the gross tax revenue per head of the population\r\nhad risen in Ireland from 9s. 6.7d. to £1 6s. 2.2d. and had fallen in\r\nGreat Britain from £2 9s. 9.5d. to £2 4s. 1.6d. For the first time also\r\nit was shown that the national beverages of England and Ireland, beer\r\nand whisky, respectively, were taxed in a ratio unfair to Ireland. In\r\n1886 Mr. Gladstone, in preparing his first Home Rule Bill, had to\r\nre-open the question of the relative resources of Ireland and Great\r\nBritain for the first time since the Union, because he proposed a fixed\r\nannual contribution, unchangeable for thirty years, from Ireland towards\r\nthe Imperial services. He fixed the contribution at one-fifteenth or\r\napproximately half that of two-seventeenths fixed by Pitt in 1800, and\r\nthe new figure was certainly not too low. In 1888 the question was again\r\nincidentally raised by Mr. Goschen, who apportioned certain equivalent\r\ngrants towards local taxation in England, Scotland, and Ireland, in the\r\nproportion of 80, 11, 9, apparently on the principle that those were the\r\nproportions in which each country respectively contributed to Imperial\r\nexpenditure. Mr. Gladstone, in preparing the Home Rule Bill of 1893,\r\nmade investigations which threw additional light on the true amount of\r\nrevenue derived from Ireland, with allowance made for revenue from\r\ndutiable goods taxed in Ireland but consumed in Great Britain, and _vice\r\nversa_, but his financial scheme, as revised in the course of the\r\nSession and passed by the House of Commons, evaded the crucial issue by\r\nmaking Ireland's contribution to Imperial services a quota, one-third,\r\nof her true annual revenue. This quota, moreover, was indirectly\r\nreduced by temporary subsidies in aid of Irish charges (_e.g._, for\r\nPolice) and was estimated, with these deductions, not to exceed at the\r\noutset one-fortieth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCIAL RELATIONS COMMISSION OF 1894-1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now apparent that, with or without Home Rule, the whole subject\r\nneeded serious investigation, and in 1894, after the defeat of Mr.\r\nGladstone's Bill, a Royal Commission under the Presidency of Mr. Hugh\r\nChilders was appointed to consider the \"Financial Relations between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland.\" Their Report deserves careful study, because\r\nit contains within it all the essential materials for forming a judgment\r\nupon the financial problem of to-day. All that it lacks are the\r\ncomplementary figures of the subsequent seventeen years, and these\r\nfigures, which I shall presently add, do not affect the conflict of\r\nprinciples, though they throw into more vivid relief than ever the\r\noutcome of conflicting principles.\r\n\r\nIn composition it was a very strong Commission; it consulted the highest\r\nfinancial authorities in the Kingdom; it made for two years an\r\nexhaustive examination, historical and practical, of the questions\r\nsubmitted to it, and although the members disagreed on some important\r\npoints, the conclusions upon which they were unanimous cannot be\r\nimpugned. The terms of reference were:\r\n\r\n\"1. Upon what principles of comparison, and by the application of what\r\nspecific standards, the relative capacity of Great Britain and Ireland\r\nto bear taxation may be most equitably determined.\r\n\r\n\"2. What, so far as can be ascertained, is the true proportion, under\r\nthe principles and specific standards so determined, between the taxable\r\ncapacity of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"3. The history of the financial relations between Great Britain and\r\nIreland at and after the Legislative Union, the charge for Irish\r\npurposes on the Imperial Exchequer during that period, and the amount of\r\nIrish taxation remaining available for contribution to Imperial\r\nexpenditure; also the Imperial expenditure to which it is considered\r\nequitable that Ireland should contribute.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Questions 1 and 2 deal with abstract points,\r\nNo. 3 (except the last clause) with concrete facts.[103]\r\n\r\nIn their short unanimous Report the Commissioners began by stating that\r\n\"Great Britain and Ireland must, for the purposes of this inquiry, be\r\nconsidered as separate entities.\"\r\n\r\nTo Question 1 they made no unanimous answer. This was immaterial,\r\nbecause, as a result of numerous tests (assessment to estate duties and\r\nincome-tax, consumption of commodities, population, etc.) all arrived\r\nunanimously at an answer to the next question.\r\n\r\nAnswer to Question 2 (and incidentally, as will be seen, to part of\r\nQuestion 3): \"That whilst the tax revenue of Ireland is about\r\n_one-eleventh_ of that of Great Britain, the relative taxable capacity\r\nof Ireland is very much smaller, _and is not estimated by any of us as\r\nexceeding one-twentieth_.\"\r\n\r\nThe wording of the answer needs to be explained by reference to the text\r\nof the Report.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In saying \"tax revenue\" the Commissioners meant to exclude non-tax\r\nrevenue--_e.g._, Post Office receipts, etc.--but the Commissioners in\r\ntheir various separate Reports generally employed the figures of total\r\nrevenue. Taking these as our basis, the Irish revenue then raised would\r\nhave been nearly one-twelfth instead of one-eleventh of the British\r\nrevenue. In other words, of the total revenue of the United Kingdom,\r\nIreland paid nearly _one-thirteenth_. (_b_) As to the true Irish taxable\r\ncapacity of \"one-twentieth,\" some confusion arises owing to the use of\r\nthe phrase by different Commissioners in different senses. Mr. Childers\r\nand Sir David Barbour appear to have meant one-twentieth of the United\r\nKingdom's taxable capacity, the others one-twentieth of Great\r\nBritain's. In order to be on the conservative side, I shall adopt the\r\nformer estimate. The discrepancy is not material to the conclusions of\r\nthe Commissioners, as, for reasons which I need not go into, they agreed\r\nthat the minimum amount of over-taxation was two millions and\r\nthree-quarters.\r\n\r\nThis was the main outstanding conclusion of the Royal Commission.\r\nTranslated into figures, it showed the following facts: In 1893-94 the\r\ntotal revenue of the United Kingdom from all sources was £96,855,627. Of\r\nthis sum the revenue contributed by Great Britain from all sources was\r\n£89,286,978; by Ireland, £7,568,649--that is, between one-eleventh and\r\none-twelfth of the British revenue.\r\n\r\nIf Ireland in 1893-94 had paid in proportion to her true taxable\r\ncapacity of one-twentieth, the maximum arrived at by any member of the\r\nCommission, the revenue derived from her would have been £4,842,781.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there was held to be an excess payment from Ireland of\r\n£2,725,868.\r\n\r\nIt was not suggested by any member of the Commission that Ireland, since\r\nthe Union, had grown richer at a more rapid rate than England, and was\r\ntherefore more capable of bearing taxation. On the contrary, it was\r\nadmitted that she had grown, relatively, much poorer. On the most\r\nmoderate estimate, therefore, the over-taxation of Ireland since the\r\nUnion, computed strictly on the principle laid down, could be\r\nrepresented as amounting in 1894 to something like two hundred and fifty\r\nmillions, or, if we date from the fiscal union of 1817, two hundred\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThe answer given by the Commissioners to Question 3, so far as it goes,\r\nis explanatory of the previous answer.\r\n\r\n\"That the Act of Union imposed upon Ireland a burden which, as events\r\nshowed, she was unable to bear.\r\n\r\n\"That the increase of taxation laid upon Ireland between 1853 and 1860\r\nwas not justified by the then existing circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they added the opinion \"that identity of rates of taxation does not\r\nnecessarily involve equality of burden.\"\r\n\r\nTheir answers, so far as they were complete, to the other inquiries\r\ncontained in Question No. 3 about the tax revenue of Ireland and the\r\nnet contribution of Ireland in the past to Imperial services, are to be\r\nfound in figures included in the body of the Report, and these figures\r\nformed, of course, the basis of their unanimous conclusion as to the\r\nover-taxation of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThese figures, to which I have often alluded in this volume, necessitate\r\na short digression, because they and subsequent Returns of the same sort\r\nform the only official data upon which to estimate the present financial\r\nposition of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThey were extracted partly from annual Returns originally issued by the\r\nTreasury for the Home Rule Bill of 1893, and entitled \"Financial\r\nRelations (England, Scotland, and Ireland),\" and partly from a new\r\ndocument known as the \"Pease\" Return, No. 313 of 1894. These Returns,\r\ntaken together, represented the first serious attempt by the Treasury to\r\nconstruct an account covering a period from 1819-20 to 1890-91, and\r\nshowing (_a_) the exact revenue derived from Ireland and Great Britain\r\nrespectively; (_b_) the local expenditure in Ireland and Great Britain\r\nrespectively, as distinguished from Imperial expenditure incurred for\r\nthe benefit of the whole United Kingdom; (_c_) the net contribution of\r\nIreland and Great Britain respectively to this latter expenditure for\r\nImperial services only.\r\n\r\nSince 1894 two regular annual Returns have been compiled, the one\r\nshowing the revenue, local expenditure, and net Imperial contribution of\r\nScotland, Ireland, and England (including Wales), the other giving an\r\nhistorical summary of similar figures for Great Britain and Ireland\r\nonly, from 1819-20 to the current date.\r\n\r\nTwo insoluble problems have had to be grappled with by the Treasury in\r\npreparing these Returns: first, to differentiate Imperial expenditure\r\nfrom local expenditure; second, to arrive at the \"true\" net revenue of\r\nthe partners as distinguished from the revenue collected within their\r\nrespective limits. Both these problems arise whenever an attempt is made\r\nto look behind a system of unitary finance into the burdens and\r\ncontributions of different portions of a united realm, and the latter,\r\nthough not the former, of the two may arise in just as acute a form if\r\nthe realm consists of federated States with a common system of Customs\r\nand Excise.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first problem, it is, of course, easy, in the case of\r\na Federation, to distinguish between central, or Federal, expenditure\r\nand local, or State, expenditure, because the functions of the Federal\r\nGovernment and State Governments are delimited in the Constitution, and\r\nthe separate expenditures form the subject of separate balance-sheets.\r\nBut in a Union, and above all in a Union to which one part of the realm\r\nis an unwilling party, like that of the British Isles, it is clear that\r\nno absolutely accurate line can be drawn between Imperial and local\r\nexpenditure. The Army, the Navy, and a number of other things are\r\nclearly enough Imperial, but there are many debatable items. For\r\nexample, Is the upkeep of the Lord-Lieutenant an Irish or an Imperial\r\ncharge? Is a loss on Post Office business in Ireland to be charged\r\nagainst Ireland, or should Ireland be credited with a proportion of the\r\nprofits of the whole postal business of the United Kingdom? More\r\nsearching questions still: Is the enormous charge for the Irish Police,\r\nwhich is under Imperial control, and exists avowedly for the purpose of\r\nforcibly maintaining, in the Imperial interest, an unpopular form of\r\ngovernment in Ireland, to be charged against Ireland? Or, again, should\r\nIreland be debited with the cost of the machinery for carrying out Land\r\nPurchase, a policy admittedly rendered necessary by the enforced\r\nmaintenance in the past of bad land laws? Obviously such questions can\r\nnever be answered so as to satisfy both Irishmen and Englishmen, because\r\nthey go to the root of the political relations between Ireland and Great\r\nBritain. The Royal Commission, therefore, was naturally unable to give a\r\nunanimous answer to the last clause of Question No. 3 of their Terms of\r\nReference--namely, \"What is the Imperial expenditure to which Ireland\r\nshould equitably contribute?\" Some members held that under the Union\r\neven a theoretical classification was unjustifiable, while it was\r\nobvious that under the Union no effect could be given to it. Still, the\r\nclassification had to be made, in order to arrive at a theoretical\r\nestimate of the financial situations of Great Britain and Ireland\r\nrespectively, and the Treasury, charged with the preparation of this\r\nestimate, took the only course open to it in reckoning as Irish\r\nexpenditure all expenditure which would not have to be incurred if\r\nIreland did not exist. It was the perfectly correct course for the\r\nTreasury to take in dealing with the task set before them, and, as we\r\nshall see, it provides the only basis on which to construct the\r\nbalance-sheet of a financially independent Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe insolubility of the second problem--that of discovering the \"true\"\r\nrevenue of Ireland and Great Britain respectively--arises from the\r\ndifficulty of tracing the passage of dutiable articles from one part of\r\nthe kingdom to the other, and of tracing the incidence of direct imposts\r\nsuch as income-tax and stamps. The great bulk of Irish revenue is\r\nderived from indirect taxes on commodities, liquor, tobacco, tea, sugar,\r\netc. Since the consumer pays the tax, revenue is rightly credited to the\r\ncountry of consumption. The tax, for example, on tobacco manufactured in\r\nIreland may be collected in Ireland, but the revenue from Irish-made\r\ntobacco exported to and consumed in Great Britain is rightly credited to\r\nGreat Britain. The converse holds true. Half the tea consumed in Ireland\r\nhas paid duty in London, but the whole of the revenue from tea consumed\r\nin Ireland must be credited to Ireland. Now, since 1826, no official\r\nrecords had been kept by the Customs-houses of the transit of goods\r\nbetween Ireland and England, except in the solitary case of spirits. The\r\ndata, therefore, did not exist, and do not exist now, except in the case\r\nof spirits, for an accurate computation. This is frankly confessed by\r\nthe Treasury officials. They base their published figures on certain\r\narbitrary methods of calculation which have never been submitted to any\r\npublic inquiry, and which, as they admit, contain an element of\r\nguesswork. The matter is an exceedingly important one to Ireland,\r\nbecause ever since 1870 an increasingly heavy deduction has been made by\r\nthe Treasury from her \"collected\" revenue, and her \"true\" revenue has\r\nproportionately diminished. Part of this deduction is no doubt due to\r\nthe fact that her exports of tobacco and liquor have, in recent times,\r\nmuch exceeded her imports, but the margin for error is nevertheless\r\nlarge. Mr. Gladstone, in framing his Home Rule Bill of 1886, was so\r\nsensible of the inherent difficulties of the calculation that, while\r\nretaining Customs and Excise under Imperial control, he credited to the\r\nIrish Exchequer the whole of the revenue collected within Ireland. On\r\nthe balance of Anglo-Irish exchange in dutiable articles, as roughly\r\nestimated at that time, this provision meant an annual allowance to\r\nIreland of nearly a million and a half pounds, the principal reason\r\nbeing that Ireland, which is a larger manufacturer of spirits and\r\ntobacco, was exporting more than she consumed of these commodities. In\r\nthe Bill of 1893, as part of a wholly different financial scheme, Mr.\r\nGladstone abandoned the plan just described, and provided for the annual\r\ncalculation of \"true\" Irish revenue, as distinguished from \"collected\"\r\nrevenue; but it is a proof of the obscurity and intricacy of the whole\r\nbusiness that the Treasury officials made a mistake of £400,000 in the\r\ninitial calculation, with the result that Mr. Gladstone had to recast\r\nhis financial scheme from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nIn the Return of 1894, as presented to the Royal Commission, this error\r\nwas eliminated, but the method of calculation remained imperfect. Nobody\r\nknows now what the true figures are, and there is good reason to think\r\nthat Irish revenue has always been, and still is, substantially\r\nunderestimated.\r\n\r\nThe same obscurity shrouded, and still shrouds, the \"true\" Irish revenue\r\nfrom income-tax and stamps, whose proceeds it is exceedingly difficult\r\nto trace under a system of unitary finance, and which are traced by the\r\nTreasury in a fashion again admittedly unreliable.[104]\r\n\r\nIn regard to taxes on consumption the same difficulty has been met with\r\nin Australia since the federation of the Colonies and the delegation to\r\nthe Commonwealth Government of exclusive control over Customs and\r\nExcise. The product of these duties makes up the bulk of Australian\r\nrevenue, and is far too large for the needs of the Commonwealth\r\nGovernment. The Constitution of 1900 provided that the surplus should be\r\nreturned to the individual States in proportion to their \"true\"\r\ncontributions to the revenue, and for the calculation of these \"true\"\r\ncontributions an elaborate system of book-keeping was instituted, in\r\norder to trace the ultimate place of consumption of dutiable articles.\r\nEach State was then credited with its \"true\" revenue, and debited, among\r\nother things, with a proportionate share of the expense of any\r\nDepartment transferred by the Constitution from the State to the\r\nCommonwealth. The system caused general dissatisfaction, owing, as the\r\nAustralian Official Year Book puts it, \"to the practical impossibility\r\nof ensuring that in every case a consuming State will be duly credited\r\nwith revenue collected on its behalf in a distributing State.\" That is\r\nthe well-founded complaint of Ireland in regard to the Treasury returns.\r\nHitherto in Australia efforts to change the system for another\r\nallocating the surplus on a basis of population have not been\r\nsuccessful.[105] The Canadian Federal Constitution uses the basis of\r\npopulation for the distribution of small subsidies to the Provinces, but\r\ncomplaints have arisen as to its fairness. British Columbia, for\r\nexample, for a long time complained that her subsidy was too small, one\r\nof the grounds being that her consumption of dutiable goods was\r\nunusually large. No means existed of verifying this complaint by\r\nfigures.[106]\r\n\r\nWith this explanatory digression about a very important feature of\r\nAnglo-Irish finance, I return to the findings of the Royal Commission of\r\n1894-1896. The figures supplied to them were as shown on the opposite\r\npage.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the average \"true\" revenue of Ireland was\r\nstationary at a little over five millions from 1820 to 1850, rose with a\r\nbound to seven and a half millions with the equalization of taxes in the\r\ndecade 1850-1860, and remained stationary at that figure for the\r\nremaining thirty-four years. Expenditure in Ireland quadrupled in the\r\nwhole sixty-four years; and the net contribution to Imperial services,\r\nafter rising from three and a half millions (in round numbers) in 1820\r\nto five and a half millions in 1860, fell automatically, as the\r\nexpenditure rose, and had stood at two millions from 1890 afterwards.\r\nPopulation had fallen by two millions, but the \"true\" revenue raised per\r\nhead of population rose from 15s. 5d. in 1819 to £1 13s. 5d. in 1894,\r\nwhile the local expenditure rose from 4s. 7d. per head in 1820 to £1 5s.\r\nin 1894.\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT SHOWING THE ESTIMATED LOCAL EXPENDITURE INCURRED IN IRELAND,\r\nAND THE BALANCE OF TRUE REVENUE WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR IMPERIAL SERVICES\r\nAFTER SUCH EXPENDITURE HAS BEEN MET:\r\n\r\n          Revenue as  Adjustment  Estimated  Estimated     Balance    Population\r\n          Collected   (+) or (-)   True        Local       available\r\n                                  Revenue    Expenditures    for\r\n                                                           Imperial\r\n                                                           Services\r\nDecadal\r\nfigures.        £           £          £         £             £\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1819-20   5,253,909   +    2,655  5,256,564  1,564,880    3,691,684   6,801,000\r\n1829-30   4,161,217   +1,040,908  5,502,125  1,345,579    4,156,576   7,767,401\r\n1839-40   4,571,150   +  841,739  5,412,889  1,789,567    3,626,322   8,175,124\r\n1849-50   4,338,091   +  523,374  4,861,465  2,247,687    2,613,778   6,574,278\r\n1859-60   7,097,994   +  602,430  7,700,334  2,304,334    5,396,000   5,798,967\r\n1869-70   7,331,058   +   95,274  7,426,332  2,938,122    4,488,210   5,412,377\r\n1879-80   7,831,316   -  550,520  7,280,856  4,054,549    3,226,307   5,174,836\r\n1889-90   9,005,932   -1,271,254  7,734,678  5,057,708    2,676,970   4,704,750\r\n\r\nAnnual\r\nfigures.        £           £          £         £             £\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1890-91   9,301,463   -1,506,988  7,734,475  5,723,399    2,071,076      --\r\n1891-92   9,639,344   -1,671,226  7,968,105  6,021,810    1,946,295      --\r\n1892-93   9,425,177   -1,986,780  7,438,397  5,540,508    1,897,880      --\r\n1893-94   9,650,649   -2,082,000  7,568,649  5,602,555    1,966,094   1,638,000\r\n\r\nIn 1893-94, the last year under review, Ireland, in round figures, was\r\nproducing a net revenue of seven and a half millions, was costing five\r\nand a half millions, and was, therefore, contributing to Imperial\r\nservices a surplus of two millions. In the same year, while contributing\r\nher two millions, she was overtaxed, according to the lowest estimate of\r\nthe Commissioners, by two and three-quarter millions.\r\n\r\nBut the significance of these figures cannot be discerned without an\r\nexamination of their counterparts on the British side of the account. In\r\nthe whole period Great Britain's \"true\" revenue had risen from\r\n£51,445,764 to £89,286,978; her local expenditure from £4,439,333 to\r\n£30,618,586, and her net contribution to Imperial services from\r\n£47,006,431 to £58,668,392. Her population had increased from\r\n13,765,000 in 1820 to 33,469,000 (estimated) in 1893, but her \"true\"\r\nrevenue had _fallen_ per head of the population from £3 13s. to £2 13s.\r\n4d. (approximately), although her local expenditure had risen from 4s.\r\n7d. to £1 2s. (approximately). In other words, a great increase of\r\nwealth had enabled the British taxpayer to pay far more while feeling\r\nthe burden far less. The converse was true of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe current state of the account in 1893-94 was as follows:\r\n\r\n                              Great Britain      Ireland\r\n  1893-94                      (Population,   (Population,     Totals.\r\n                                33,469,000).    4,638,000).\r\n\r\n                                     £              £             £\r\n\"True\" Revenue                  89,286,978      7,568,649    96,855,627\r\nLocal Expenditure               30,618,586      5,602,555    36,221,141\r\nNet contribution to Imperial\r\n  Services                      58,668,392      1,966,094    60,634,486\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, though raising in \"true\" revenue between eleven and\r\ntwelve times as much as Ireland, was costing only between five and six\r\ntimes as much to administer as Ireland, and was therefore contributing\r\nto Imperial services twenty-eight times as much as Ireland.\r\n\r\nNow the Commissioners had stated that the taxable capacity of Ireland\r\nwas not one-eleventh, but, at the utmost, one-twentieth --in other\r\nwords, that she ought to contribute not more than one-twentieth of the\r\nUnited Kingdom revenue. On that basis she should as we have seen, have\r\nbeen showing a revenue in 1893-94 not of £7,568,649, but of £4,842,781.\r\n\r\nBut, if her local expenditure had also been proportionate to her true\r\ntaxable capacity of one-twentieth, instead of standing at £5,602,555, it\r\nwould have stood at £1,811,057, or two-thirds less, while if her net\r\ncontribution to Imperial services had likewise been a twentieth, instead\r\nof paying £1,966,094, she would have had to pay £3,031,724, or a million\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, therefore, might be extracted from the figures that,\r\nalthough by hypothesis overtaxed, Ireland was drawing a balance of\r\nprofit, because, by having more spent on her--or, to put it in another\r\nway, by costing more to govern, she paid a million less to the common\r\npurse than if she had been taxed according to her capacity.\r\n\r\nThis was precisely the conclusion drawn by one member of the Commission,\r\nSir David Barbour, and implicitly acquiesced in by one other member, Sir\r\nThomas Sutherland. All the other Commissioners agreed that there was\r\nsomething seriously amiss, and declined to regard the disproportionately\r\nhigh expenditure on Ireland as compensation for the over-high taxation.\r\nThe O'Conor Don, as successor in the chairmanship to Mr. Childers, and\r\nfour others contented themselves with setting forth the facts, but made\r\nno recommendations, on the ground that the Commission had not been asked\r\nto make any. Mr. Childers, who died before the completion of the\r\ninquiry, left a Draft Report recommending that a special grant,\r\namounting to two millions a year, should for the future be allocated to\r\nIreland. The other six members, dividing into two groups of three, under\r\nLord Farrer and Mr. Sexton respectively, and stating their views in two\r\ndifferent Reports, all agreed that a form of Home Rule giving financial\r\nindependence to Ireland was the only solution of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe questions at issue were not at all obscure. Any apparent obscurity\r\nwas caused by the terms of reference to the Commission, which assumed\r\nthe permanence of the Union, while it was absolutely impossible for the\r\nCommission, divided though its members were in politics, to start work\r\nat all without, as they said, considering Great Britain and Ireland as\r\n\"separate entities.\" The reader must be on his guard against\r\nexaggerating the \"over-taxation of Ireland\" in its purely cash aspect.\r\nThe really important points were: (1) The suitability of the Irish taxes\r\nand the responsibility for levying them; (2) the amount and suitability\r\nof the expenditure in Ireland and the responsibility for its\r\ndistribution. In order to see conflicting principles stated in their\r\nclearest form the reader should compare the terse and vigorous reports\r\nof Sir David Barbour on the one hand, and of Lord Farrer, Lord Welby,\r\nand Mr. Currie on the other.\r\n\r\nIt was Sir David Barbour's great merit that he was not afraid of his own\r\nconclusions. He frankly stated, like all the other Commissioners, that\r\nIreland's taxation, considered by itself, without regard to Irish\r\nexpenditure, was unsuitable and unjust. He recognized that a system of\r\ntaxation which was suitable for a rich, industrial, and expanding\r\ncountry like Great Britain was unsuitable for a poor, agricultural, and\r\neconomically stagnant country like Ireland. He had before him the\r\nfigures showing that two-thirds of the Irish population was rural, and\r\nthat between three and four-fifths of the English population was\r\nurban.[107] He laid special stress on the fact that five-sevenths of\r\nIrish revenue, as compared with less than half the British revenue, was\r\nderived from taxes on commodities of general consumption, pressing\r\nheavily on the poor, and set forth the figures showing that the product\r\nof these taxes represented a charge of £1 2s. 0.95d. per head of the\r\npopulation in Ireland, and £1 1s. 0.05d. in Great Britain, although the\r\nwealth per head of Great Britain, as he admitted, \"was much greater than\r\nthe wealth of Ireland per head.\"[108] His conclusion was that this state\r\nof affairs, though regrettable, could not be helped, because, under the\r\nUnion, whose permanence he took for granted, a change of general\r\ntaxation to suit Ireland was simply impracticable. He did, it is true,\r\npoint out incidentally that the same hardship might be said to affect\r\npoor localities in Great Britain and poor individuals in Great Britain,\r\nbut he recoiled from the absurd fallacy involved in saying that on that\r\naccount Ireland was not unjustly taxed. If he had gone to that length he\r\ncould never have signed the unanimous Report.\r\n\r\nI only mention this latter point because some outside critics have been\r\nbold enough to assert the fallacy in its completeness, proving, as they\r\neasily can, that the purchase of a pound of tea or a pint of beer is as\r\ngreat an expense to a man with 10s. a week in Whitechapel as to a man\r\nwith 10s. a week in Connemara. Such reasoning nullifies the whole\r\nscience of taxation. It would be as sensible to say that our whole\r\nfiscal system might wisely be transplanted in its entirety to any\r\nforeign country or to any self-governing Colony absolutely irrespective\r\nof their social and economic conditions and of their habits. Yet Ireland\r\nin these respects has always differed from Great Britain at least as\r\nmuch as any self-governing Colony and many European countries. The\r\ntea-tax produces scarcely anything in France; it produces an enormous\r\namount relatively in Ireland, and is a greater burden there than in\r\nGreat Britain. The wine-tax is not felt by Ireland; it is felt more by\r\nEngland; it would cause a revolution in France. Beer is taxed lightly in\r\nthe United Kingdom, but the Irishman drinks only half as much beer as\r\nthe Englishman. Meat is untaxed, but the Irish poor eat no meat. Spirits\r\nand tobacco are highly taxed, and they are consumed more largely in\r\nIreland than in England. And so on. The whole Commission recognized that\r\nthe circumstances of the two countries were different, and stated \"that\r\nidentity of rates of taxation does not necessarily involve equality of\r\nburden.\"\r\n\r\nNor could Sir David Barbour have dissociated himself from these\r\nconclusions without destroying the rest of his argument. He pointed out\r\nwith truth that merely to reduce Irish taxation to its correct level,\r\nand to leave Irish expenditure where it was, would be to wipe out\r\nIreland's contribution to Imperial purposes and leave her with a subsidy\r\nfrom Great Britain of three-quarters of a million. On the other hand, he\r\nheld, as I have already indicated, that unduly heavy taxation in Ireland\r\nwas already compensated for by an excess of local expenditure in Ireland\r\nas compared with Great Britain. But how, on its merits, and apart from\r\nthe question of taxation, could such an excess be justified? The Act of\r\nUnion had provided for indiscriminate expenditure in the event of a\r\nfiscal union. Most of the other Commissioners, indeed, had objected to\r\nthe idea of distinguishing between \"Imperial\" expenditure and \"local\"\r\nexpenditure, and striking a balance called an \"Imperial contribution,\"\r\nwithout, at the same time, distinguishing politically between Ireland\r\nand Great Britain. In other words, they took up the not very logical\r\nposition that Ireland must be considered as a separate entity for\r\npurposes of finance owing to the phrase about \"abatements and\r\nexemptions,\" but not for purposes of expenditure. Whether this was a\r\ncorrect interpretation of the Act of Union has always been a matter of\r\ndispute, but the practical problem is little affected thereby. Sir David\r\nBarbour thought it an incorrect interpretation, and reached the more\r\nlogical position that Ireland, both for revenue and expenditure, could\r\nbe regarded as a separate entity. This view enabled him to put forward\r\nan argument which, while ostensibly palliating the over-taxation of\r\nIreland, in reality condemned the whole of the political system\r\nestablished by the Union. We can, he said, in effect, rightly\r\ndistinguish between Imperial and local expenditure, and it is\r\npermissible to spend more on Ireland than on Great Britain. By so\r\nspending more we not only cancel our debt to Ireland, but make her a\r\npresent of a million which would otherwise go to swell her contribution\r\nto Imperial purposes. Now, to get at the pith of this argument, the\r\nreader must bear in mind what Sir David Barbour thought it needless to\r\nremark upon, that Ireland had, and has, a separate quasi-colonial system\r\nof administration of her own, but outside her own control, a system of\r\nwhich he approved. In other words, besides having to be considered in\r\nfinance as a \"separate entity,\" she was to a large extent in actual\r\nfact, politically, a \"separate entity,\" though not a self-governing\r\nentity, to which through the channel of the Irish Government Departments\r\na special large quota for local expenditure could be easily allocated.\r\nAs an economist, therefore, and as an upholder of the strangely\r\nparadoxical system set up by the so-called \"Union,\" Sir David Barbour\r\nwas absolutely consistent.\r\n\r\nSo were Lord Farrer, Lord Welby, and Mr. Currie in coming to\r\ndiametrically opposite conclusions. The crux of the discussion, stripped\r\nof academical reasoning, was simple. Everything turned, obviously, on\r\nthe nature, amount, and origin of Irish expenditure. Sir David Barbour\r\nhad passed lightly over these vital points, recommending only that any\r\nfuture _saving_ of expenditure in Ireland ought to be used for Irish\r\npurposes--a further admission of Ireland's separate political\r\nexistence--and shutting his eyes to future _increases_ of expenditure.\r\nLord Farrer and his colleagues, while agreeing that it was impossible to\r\nalter the taxation of Ireland so long as the Union lasted, agreed that\r\nadditional local expenditure in Ireland could not be regarded as a\r\nset-off to undue taxation, not only because such a doctrine was\r\ninherently fallacious on economic grounds, and would hardly be listened\r\nto in the case of any other country than Ireland, but because Irish\r\nexpenditure was subjected to no proper means of control. Both Irish\r\nrevenue and Irish services, the former being only theoretically, the\r\nlatter actually, distinct and separate, were outside the control of\r\nIrishmen, who had therefore no motive for economy. Nor was there any\r\nproper measure of determining what expenditure was good for Ireland and\r\nwhat was bad, though they held that there was reason to believe that\r\nmuch of Irish administration was both bad and costly. With regard to the\r\nextensive system of Imperial loans, whose charge swelled the Irish\r\nexpenditure, they quoted the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Murrough\r\nO'Brien[109] to the effect that the system of Imperial loans for\r\ntemporary emergencies and charity loans--\"made to keep the people quiet\r\nor to keep them alive\"--tends to increase the poverty of Ireland, \"does\r\nnot prevent the recurrence of famine, distress, and discontent,\" and\r\nthat \"a great deal of the money nominally meant to be spent on\r\nproductive works has been misspent and wasted.\" They also dwelt, with\r\nemphasis, on official figures showing the extravagance of Civil\r\nGovernment in Ireland, the cost having risen from 1s. 10d. per head of\r\nthe population in 1820 to 19s. 7d. per head in 1893, whereas the cost of\r\nCivil Government in Great Britain had only risen from 1s. 7d. to 11s.\r\n5d. The charge for legal salaries and five principal Departments in\r\nIreland was double the right figure according to population, and\r\nrepresented an excess cost of nearly £200,000. In wealthy and\r\nprogressive Belgium, Civil Government cost 10s. per head, or little more\r\nthan half as much per head as in Ireland.[110] The absurdity of\r\nrepresenting such excess charges and the wasteful expenditure of a\r\nblundering philanthropy, as a recompense for over-taxation, was\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the rise in the cost of Irish Government, coupled with a\r\nstagnant revenue, had decreased the annual contribution of Ireland to\r\nImperial services, which had fallen from five and a half millions in\r\n1860 to two millions in 1894; unless, indeed, half the cost of Irish\r\npolice, virtually a branch of the Imperial Army, and costing double the\r\namount of Scottish and English police, were to be reckoned, not as an\r\nIrish expense, on the principle adopted by the Treasury, but as a part\r\nof Imperial expenditure. In any case both partners suffered from\r\nexcessive and unwise expenditure in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe gist of their conclusions was as follows:[111]\r\n\r\n1. It is impossible, under the Union, to vary taxation for the benefit\r\nof Ireland.\r\n\r\n2. Additional benevolent expenditure in Ireland is not a remedy for\r\nover-taxation.[112]\r\n\r\n\"We entertain a profound distrust of benevolences, doles, grants-in-aid,\r\nby whatever name they are called, ... or by whatever machinery it is\r\nproposed to distribute them, convinced, as we are, that in some form or\r\nother political influence or personal interest will creep in so as to\r\ndefeat, in part at any rate, the attainment of the objects for which the\r\nexpenditure is made.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"We believe that the expenditure of public funds cannot be wisely and\r\neconomically controlled unless _those who have the disposal_ of public\r\nmoney are made _responsible_ for raising it as well as spending it.\"\r\nGrants of money \"tend to weaken the spirit of independence and\r\nself-reliance,\" the absence of which qualities \"has been the main cause\r\nof the backward condition\" of Ireland.\r\n\r\n4. \"One sure method of redressing the inequality which has been shown to\r\nexist between Great Britain and Ireland will be to put upon the Irish\r\npeople the duty of levying their own taxes and of providing for their\r\nown expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"If it is objected that the course we suggest may lead to the\r\nimposition of new Customs duties in Ireland, we might reply that in this\r\ncase, as in that of the Colonies, _freedom is a greater good than free\r\ntrade._ We doubt, however, whether Irishmen, if entrusted with their own\r\nfinance, would attempt to raise fiscal barriers between the two\r\ncountries; for we are satisfied that Ireland, and not Great Britain,\r\nwould be the loser by such a policy. The market of Great Britain is of\r\ninfinitely greater importance to Ireland than that of Ireland to Great\r\nBritain.\" The only point on which the three Commissioners differed\r\nconcerned Ireland's contribution to Imperial services. Lord Farrer and\r\nMr. Currie, taking Home Rule as the foundation of their argument, and\r\nprophesying, quite correctly, that under the Union, in a few years,\r\nIreland's contribution would disappear altogether, recommended that no\r\nsuch contribution should be exacted by law until Ireland's taxable\r\ncapacity approximately reached that of Great Britain. Lord Welby,\r\nregarding Home Rule as an essential but a distant ideal, was for an\r\nimmediate reorganization of Anglo-Irish finances which should provide\r\nfor a large reduction of Irish Civil expenditure, the saving to be\r\ndevoted, on Sir David Barbour's principle, to Irish purposes, and for a\r\nfixed contribution from Ireland to the Army, Navy, National Debt, etc.\r\nHow Lord Welby, consistently with his previous argument, could count\r\nupon any reduction of expenditure in Ireland under the existing\r\npolitical system it is difficult to see. At any rate, subsequent events\r\nproved both him and Sir David Barbour signally wrong on this important\r\npoint.[113]\r\n\r\nIn every other point the wisdom of the three Commissioners has been\r\nabundantly proved by lapse of time. Do not the conclusions set forth\r\nabove bear upon them the stamp of common sense? If it were not for the\r\ninveterate prejudice against Home Rule on other than financial grounds,\r\nno one would dream of disputing them; for they are based on principles\r\nuniversally accepted in every part of the British Empire but Ireland,\r\nand in most parts of the civilized world. They constitute, in fact,\r\nfinancially, one of the strongest arguments possible for political Home\r\nRule.\r\n\r\nThere, at any rate, lies a clear issue. Seventeen years have not altered\r\nthe essential principles involved. On the contrary, it will be seen that\r\nevery year of the seventeen has strengthened the argument of Lord Farrer\r\nand his colleagues, and weakened the argument of Sir David Barbour. But,\r\nbefore proceeding to this final demonstration, let me in general terms\r\ndescribe what befell the Royal Commission's Report, which was published\r\nin 1896. For a moment all Ireland, irrespective of class or creed, was\r\nalight with patriotic excitement. Few listened to Sir David Barbour's\r\nview, namely, that so long as Irish expenditure came near Irish revenue\r\nthere could be no Irish grievance. Home Rulers and Unionists met on\r\nfriendly platforms to denounce the over-taxation of Ireland and to\r\ndisplay figures showing the hundreds of millions of profit made by\r\nGreat Britain out of an unconscionable fiscal bargain. This criticism\r\nmissed the real point and the unanimity was short-lived. No change could\r\nbe made in the system without Home Rule, and the dissension about Home\r\nRule was strong enough to prevent Irishmen from uniting against a fiscal\r\nsystem which was not only unjust but demoralizing to Ireland. A Unionist\r\nGovernment was in power for nine more years after 1896, and a Liberal\r\nGovernment, pledged temporarily not to give Home Rule, for four further\r\nyears. The natural result was that, in default of Home Rule, all parties\r\nin Ireland embraced Sir David Barbour's insidiously attractive\r\nreservation, and have ever since fallen into the habit of regarding\r\nadditional expenditure on Ireland, not only on its merits, but as a\r\nset-off to excessive taxation and as something having no relation\r\nwhatever to the taxable resources of the country. Nobody took seriously\r\nSir David Barbour's counsel of perfection about the reduction of the\r\ncost of Irish Civil Government and the allocation of the saving to\r\nIreland, because such a process was, humanly speaking, impossible.\r\nExpenditure is never reduced except by those who raise the money for it.\r\nOn the other hand, in the face of the findings of the Royal Commission,\r\nand in the face of Ireland's economic condition, no Government which\r\nrefused Home Rule could have refused large additional Irish expenditure.\r\nMuch of it, indeed, was merely an automatic reflection of the immense\r\ngrowth of national expenditure in the wealthy and expanding\r\npartner-country over the water, and took the form of \"equivalent\r\ngrants,\" whether for the corresponding British head of expense or for\r\nsomething totally different. No doubt some of the money was well spent,\r\nbut all of it came in a wrong form, through wrong channels, and was\r\nregarded in Ireland in a false light. Lastly came Old Age Pensions\r\napplied on the British scale to a far poorer population.\r\n\r\nEvery word of Lord Welby's and Lord Farrer's condemnation was justified\r\nby events; every prophecy they made has been fulfilled. And the worst of\r\nit is that the delay has damaged the prospects of Home Rule. The habit\r\nof dissociating income from revenue becomes inveterate. The habit of\r\nnursing an old grievance and of expecting \"restitution\" for funds\r\nunwarrantably levied in the past is hard to shake off. Restitution has\r\ngone too far already. Perpetuated, it would ruin Ireland. Home Rulers\r\nworth their salt must leave this cry to those Unionists who descend to\r\nuse it; but it is surely amazing that any Irishman, least of all those\r\nwho claim to represent the wealth and intelligence of the country,\r\nshould tolerate a political system which inexorably involves a fiscal\r\nsystem so humiliating to Ireland. Until three years ago it could easily\r\nhave been put an end to without affecting the independent solvency of\r\nIreland, even on the basis of an enormously swollen civil expenditure,\r\nand with the inclusion of services strictly Imperial in origin and\r\ncharacter. Now it is a different matter, and we are faced with the\r\nopposition of British statesmen who, by sustaining the Union, drove\r\nIreland to the verge of insolvency, and now use insolvency as an\r\nargument against Home Rule.\r\n\r\nOne respects the clean and honest side of Unionism, but there can be\r\nnothing but reprobation for the meanness of this latter-day argument.\r\nFor generations Ireland herself has asked to be free both from coercion\r\nand bribes, sanely conscious in her soul that both are equally\r\ndemoralizing. The aim--though in the past not generally the conscious\r\naim--of Unionism was to sap the moral fibre of Ireland now by one means,\r\nnow by the other. At last the aim is avowed, so that men who applauded\r\nMr. Chamberlain in 1893 for sneering at Irish patriotism as a \"sickly\r\nplant which needed to be watered by British gold\" merely because her\r\ncontribution under the Home Rule Bill was to be small are now urging\r\nIreland to maintain the Union--in Mr. Walter Long's words--for its\r\n\"eleemosynary benefits.\"[114] Ireland herself must and will rise to a\r\nhigher moral level than that, when she is fully awake to the gravity of\r\nthe situation. Those who love her most will not lose a minute in\r\nexplaining that situation. Too much time already has been lost.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[97] The Treasury Returns of 1869, \"Public Income and Expenditure,\" in\r\ntwo volumes, are the basis of all information up to that date.\r\n\r\n[98] Mr. Secretary Pelham in this year estimated that Ireland, though\r\ncontributing nothing in money to the Navy, had furnished no less than\r\n38,000 men to the Navy since the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\n[99] Pre-Union Debts were to be separate. Post-Union Debt _contracted\r\nfor Imperial services_ was to be regarded as joint, and its charge was\r\nto be borne by the two countries in the proportions of their respective\r\ncontributions (see below); but post-Union Debt contracted by Ireland for\r\ndomestic services was to be kept separate.\r\n\r\n[100] Eight lectures delivered in the National University, Dublin, in\r\n1911.\r\n\r\n[101] Inhabited house duty, railway passenger tax, carriages, armorial\r\nbearings, etc. The license for dogs is half the English scale.\r\n\r\n[102] On Foster's Corn Law of 1784, see p. 51.\r\n\r\n[103] The text of the unanimous conclusions was as follows:\r\n\r\n1.

A declining population.\r\n\r\n2. An estimated true taxable capacity falling as compared with that of\r\nGreat Britain, and standing in 1893-94 at a maximum of 1 to 19.\r\n\r\n3. A revenue stationary for thirty-four years, and showing in 1893-94 a\r\nratio of 1 to 12 with that of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n4. A growing local expenditure (though stationary for the last four\r\nyears).\r\n\r\n5. A dwindling net contribution to Imperial services (though stationary\r\nfor the last four years).\r\n\r\nIf we review the subsequent seventeen years, we find:\r\n\r\n1. A population still declining, though at a slower rate.\r\n\r\n2. An estimated true taxable capacity still falling as compared with\r\nthat of Great Britain, and now standing at a maximum of 1 to 24.[115]\r\nThat is, Ireland ought strictly to be paying no more than\r\none-twenty-fifth of the United Kingdom revenue.\r\n\r\n3. A revenue rising, but very slowly and inelastically as compared with\r\nthat of Great Britain, and now showing a ratio of 1 to 15; so that the\r\n\"over-taxation\" of Ireland, as reckoned on the Royal Commission's\r\nprinciples, is still at least three millions.[116]\r\n\r\n4. A local expenditure growing rapidly and disproportionately to Irish\r\nrevenue; now just double the expenditure of 1893-94.\r\n\r\n5. A net contribution to Imperial services automatically diminishing\r\nwith the growth of Irish expenditure, disappearing altogether in\r\n1909-10, and now converted into an adverse balance against Ireland of\r\n£1,312,500.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain during the same seventeen years, population, taxable\r\ncapacity, revenue, expenditure, and net contribution to Imperial\r\nservices have all grown steadily, and, what is more important, in\r\nhealthy proportions to one another.\r\n\r\nOn the next page will be found the comparative figures for Ireland and\r\nGreat Britain of revenue, expenditure, and contribution for 1893-94 and\r\n1910-11.\r\n\r\nLet me remark at the outset _(a)_ that they and other official figures\r\ngiven in this chapter are taken from the annual Treasury returns alluded\r\nto at p. 242, \"Revenue and Expenditure (England, Scotland, and Ireland)\"\r\nand \"Imperial Revenue (Collection and Expenditure) (Great Britain and\r\nIreland).\" For the current year 1910-11 the official numbers of these\r\nReturns are 220 and 221, and the latter of the two is virtually a\r\ncontinuation of the original return, No. 313 of 1894; _(b)_ that the\r\nnon-collection of a large part of the revenue of 1909-10, owing to the\r\ndelay in passing the Budget, makes the revenue figures of the last two\r\nyears, regarded in isolation, misleading; those of the first year being\r\nabnormally low, those of the last abnormally high. I therefore give the\r\nmean figures of the two years. Expenditure is, of course, unaffected,\r\n_(c)_ That the Irish revenue shown as \"true\" is reduced by heavy\r\ndeductions from the revenue as actually collected in Ireland. At p. 244\r\nI explained that this adjustment can be regarded only as approximately\r\ncorrect, owing to the admittedly unreliable methods adopted by the\r\nTreasury, _(d)_ That the revenue shown includes non-tax as well as tax\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n                              Ireland.

In 1907-08 there was a balance available for Imperial\r\nservices of £1,811,000; in 1908-09, of only £583,000; and in 1910-11, on\r\nthe basis of a mean of that and the previous year, the deficit shown\r\nabove of £1,312,500. The principal cause is the Old Age Pensions Vote,\r\nwhich began in 1908.\r\n\r\nIf all the elements of the problem be considered together, it will be\r\nseen that the fiscal partnership is as ill-matched as ever, and has\r\nproduced results increasingly anomalous. Each of the partners and their\r\nunited interests suffer. Ireland is still more heavily taxed relatively\r\nto Great Britain, yet Ireland's contribution to Imperial services has\r\nbeen converted into a minus quantity. Why? Because Irish expenditure,\r\npaid out of the common purse, has doubled, while Irish revenue has\r\nincreased by less than a third.\r\n\r\nLet me give the final survey of Anglo-Irish finance since the Union, in\r\nthe tabular form shown by Professor Oldham at the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation in September, 1911:\r\n\r\n           NET BALANCES PAID BY IRELAND TO GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n  Single      Irish \"True\"   Expenditure      Balance       Decadal\r\n   Year.

He admitted that Ireland was overtaxed by two\r\nmillions and three-quarters. But he showed, it will be remembered, that\r\nif not only the revenue, but the expenditure and contribution to\r\nImperial services had all been in proportion to Ireland's real taxable\r\ncapacity of one-twentieth, she would have been a loser by a\r\nmillion.[117] Ireland, therefore, he argued, had certainly no grievance,\r\nwhile Great Britain received the substantial, though not strictly\r\nsufficient, sum of two millions as Ireland's contribution to Imperial\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nLet us apply the same reasoning to the present situation. Ireland, by\r\nhypothesis, is \"overtaxed\" by three millions,[118] but if not only the\r\nrevenue, but the expenditure and contribution to Imperial services of\r\nIreland were all in proportion to her real taxable capacity, which we\r\nmay estimate now at one-twenty-fifth, we find that she would be a loser\r\nby five millions. Her \"true\" revenue from all sources _ought_ on this\r\nsupposition to be £6,605,900; it _is_ £10,032,000. Her local expenditure\r\n_ought_ to be £2,875,540; it _is_ £11,344,500. Her contribution to\r\nImperial services _ought_ to be £3,730,360; it _is_ a minus quantity of\r\n£1,312,500. Sir David Barbour's reasoning, then, leads us to this\r\nastounding paradox, that Ireland, while overtaxed by three millions,\r\ngains five millions by the arrangement. Moreover, whether we accept Sir\r\nDavid Barbour's reasoning or not, it is a fact that to-day Ireland,\r\nwhich contributed to Imperial services five and a half millions in 1860,\r\nand two millions in 1894, now, so far from contributing anything, costs\r\na million and a quarter more than she brings in. This, certainly, was\r\nnot a result he either anticipated or would have approved of. On the\r\ncontrary, he anticipated a reduction in Irish civil expenditure, to be\r\nsaved for Irish purposes, without prejudice to the Imperial\r\ncontribution. It makes the brain dizzy to compare his anticipation with\r\nthe reality.\r\n\r\nHow, on the other hand, stands the argument of Lord Farrer and Mr.\r\nCurrie? They prophesied a great increase in Irish expenditure and the\r\ndisappearance of the contribution to Imperial services. That has come\r\ntrue. Lord Welby (and indeed the majority of the Commission) was with\r\nthem in declining to regard excessive local expenditure as a set-off to\r\nexcessive and unsuitable taxation, and in condemning root and branch the\r\nsystem of grants, aids, and doles as wasteful in itself and as sapping\r\nthe self-reliance of Irishmen. There again they were right. They were at\r\none with all their colleagues in holding that under the Union it was\r\nimpossible to differentiate between the taxation of Ireland and Great\r\nBritain, and they prescribed, as the only sound remedy, Home Rule. Once\r\nmore they were right.\r\n\r\nThe figures of to-day constitute the _reductio ad absurdum_ of the\r\nUnion. For over a century in Ireland we have defied the laws of\r\npolitical economy, but they have conquered us at last. Sound finance\r\ndemands that revenue and expenditure should be co-related. Ireland's\r\neconomic circumstances are widely different from those of Great Britain,\r\nbut she has been included, without any regard to her needs and without\r\nany reference to Irish expenditure, in a system of taxation designed\r\nexclusively for the capacities and needs of Great Britain. Hence Irish\r\nrevenue is both excessive and inadequate.\r\n\r\n\"Excessive\"? \"Inadequate\"? What do these terms really mean? Let us once\r\nand for all clear our minds of all obscurity and look the facts in the\r\nface. No one knows what Irish revenue and expenditure ought to be, or\r\nwould be, if Irishmen had controlled their own destinies. It is useless\r\nto parade immense sums as the cash equivalent of over-taxation; it is\r\nidle to array against them rival figures of over-expenditure. Normal\r\nIrish revenue and normal Irish expenditure are matters of speculation.\r\nFor all we know, Ireland, had she been permitted normal political\r\ndevelopment, would be raising a larger revenue, and feeling it less;\r\nwhile it is absolutely certain that she would be paying her own way and\r\ncontributing to Imperial services more, in proportion to her resources,\r\nthan she did before the Union. The political and therefore the economic\r\ndevelopment of Ireland have been deliberately and forcibly arrested. I\r\ndo not say malignantly, because there was no malignant intention. But\r\nthe action, if mistaken, was deliberately and consistently sustained.\r\nMuch of Irish industrial talent was lost irrevocably before the old\r\nindustrial restrictions were removed. There remained the land, an\r\nimmense source of potential wealth, if properly developed under a\r\nrational system of agrarian tenure. For the best part of a century after\r\nthe Union, the agrarian tenure, dating from the first genuine\r\ncolonization of Ireland, when the land was confiscated wholesale and the\r\npeasantry enslaved, was maintained by force of arms. Thirty years ago\r\n(if we date from the Land Act of 1881) we began to change this tenure\r\ninto another equally defective, though far more favourable to the\r\ntenant. A little later, but only eight years ago, on a thorough and\r\nsystematic scale, we began the parallel policy of Land Purchase. Even\r\nnow, having transferred half the land to peasant ownership, and placed\r\nthe other half under judicial rents, many of our statesmen are unwilling\r\nto give Ireland the control of its own affairs. On the contrary, step\r\nby step with the economic enfranchisement of the farmers, has gone the\r\npolicy of destroying their personal and political independence, and\r\nforcing them to look outside their own country for financial aid, by\r\nspending money upon Ireland which Irishmen have no direct responsibility\r\nfor raising. What a travesty of statesmanship! First, having assisted\r\nthe farmer to buy his own land, to clap him on the back with \"Now, my\r\nfine fellow, you are a free man.\" In the same breath to tell him that he\r\nis not fit to have a direct voice in the management of his own country's\r\naffairs, and to try and reconcile him to this insult by sapping that\r\nvery independence of character which the acquirement of a freehold has\r\nbegun to instil in him.\r\n\r\nI described in Chapter IX. how a number of patriotic Irishmen, working\r\nboth at industrial and agricultural development, have striven to\r\ncounteract this fatal tendency, and to persuade their countrymen to rely\r\non themselves alone. But I venture to repeat what I said then, that\r\nwithout the bracing discipline of Home Rule, and, above all, of the\r\nfinancial Home Rule, these efforts are doomed to comparative failure.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to produce an equilibrium between revenue and\r\nexpenditure in Ireland, as in every other country in the world. Whatever\r\nthe temporary strain upon Ireland, whatever the sacrifices involved, the\r\nthing must be done, and done now or never. Great Britain's interest is\r\nsomething, but it is trivial beside that of Ireland. The situation is\r\ngrowing worse, not better, and Irishmen should unite to insist that the\r\nwhole system should stop.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIRISH EXPENDITURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us look a little more closely at Irish expenditure, as disclosed in\r\nthe Treasury returns.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of comparison, I set out first the main heads of Civil\r\nExpenditure for England, Scotland, and Ireland in the year 1910-11:[119]\r\n\r\n            Population.

We may note in passing,\r\nhowever, that the Post-Office receipts in Ireland in 1910-11, according\r\nto the Treasury estimate, were less than the outgoings by £249,000\r\n(receipts, £1,155,500; outgoings, £1,404,500).\r\n\r\nThe Civil Government Charges are the most important heads of expense,\r\nand these are divided into two main classes: (_a_) charged on\r\nConsolidated Fund; (_b_) Voted.\r\n\r\nClass (_a_) consists of (1) Salaries, Pensions, etc.; (2) Development\r\nand Road Improvement Funds; (3) Payments to Local Taxation Accounts.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of Return No. 220 will be found the details of\r\nexpenditure in these various classes:\r\n\r\n(1) The Salaries and Pensions need not detain us long. The principal\r\nitem is judicial salaries, £102,000, as compared with £282,000 for\r\nEngland, which has more than eight times the population of Ireland.\r\nAnother item, £20,000 for the Lord-Lieutenant, is double the sum\r\nallotted to any Colonial Governor, even of the Dominion of Canada, which\r\nhas nearly twice the population of Ireland. But the extravagance lies,\r\nnot in the cash amount, but in the fact that the Irish Lord-Lieutenancy\r\nis, under present conditions, an anomalous institution. No Irishman\r\nwould grudge a penny of the sum if the Lord-Lieutenant, like a Colonial\r\nGovernor, presided over a responsibly governed Ireland.\r\n\r\n(2) Road Improvement and Development Funds. This category is blank for\r\nthe year 1910-11. There will be payments for the current year which will\r\nswell the Irish expenditure.\r\n\r\n(3) Payments to Local Taxation Accounts, £1,477,500. This raises an\r\nintricate subject, into which I cannot enter in great detail. It is well\r\nknown that the whole system of relieving local taxation out of Imperial\r\ntaxation needs thorough revision. Meanwhile Ireland, like other parts of\r\nGreat Britain, has been allotted at various times a multitude of\r\ndifferent grants under various Acts, but principally under the Local\r\nGovernment (Ireland) Act, 1898, and the Finance Acts of recent years.\r\n\r\nLocal Government on the British pattern was, as I have already\r\ndescribed, extended to Ireland only in 1898. The money now raised in\r\nIreland by Local Taxation is about £4,800,000, exclusive of the Grants\r\nin Aid which we are now considering, and which appear, rightly, on the\r\nnational balance-sheet because they come from the common purse.[120]\r\nThey are based on different principles, and originated in many different\r\nways. Some are fixed annual sums, determined either by some arbitrary\r\nstandard or (as in the case of the Licence Duty grants and the Customs\r\nand Excise grants[121]) on the Irish proceeds of certain duties in a\r\nyear taken as standard. The Estate Duty grants still vary with the total\r\nproduct of duties in the United Kingdom, and are still allocated on the\r\nproportion settled by Mr. Goschen in 1888--namely, 9 parts to Ireland,\r\n11 to Scotland, and 80 to England.[122] If the proportion were to be\r\nrevised now, and, on Mr. Goschen's method, made to correspond to the\r\nrespective estimated contributions to Imperial Services, Ireland,\r\ninstead of getting £418,000, would get nothing at all. The largest item\r\nin the list--namely, the \"Agricultural Grant,\" a fixed annual sum of\r\n£728,000, dating from the Local Government Act of 1898--was designed\r\npartly to reconcile Irish landlords to the passage of that Act. Nearly\r\nhalf of it represented the remission of the landlord's half-share of the\r\npoor-rate on agricultural land, as estimated in the standard year\r\n1896-97. The English precedent for this was the Agricultural Rates Act\r\nof 1896, which relieved the English owner of agricultural land in a\r\nsimilar way. Irish conditions were so different, however, that it was\r\nfelt necessary in this case to balance the landlord's boon with an\r\nequivalent boon to the tenant; so that half the tenant's share of the\r\ncounty cess was also remitted. The result was a disproportionately large\r\ngrant as compared with those received by England and Scotland.[123] We\r\nmust remark, as one of the minor intricacies of Irish finance, that all\r\nthese grants do not actually go in relief of Local Taxation. Some of\r\nthem are diverted to public Departments, such as the Board of\r\nIntermediate Education, the Congested Districts Board, and the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nAll these grants will cease, as such, after Home Rule, while their\r\namount must be reckoned as part of the cost of Irish Government. The\r\nIrish Parliament will have to revise the whole system of relief to Local\r\nTaxation and establish it on some simple and rational basis. Meanwhile,\r\nit is important to remember that the Irish grants form the major part of\r\nthe Guarantee Fund set up by the Land Purchase Acts, and, until the last\r\namending Land Act of 1909, were chargeable--the Estate Duties Grant, hi\r\nthe first instance, the Agricultural Grant in the second instance--with\r\nthe increasingly heavy losses incurred in floating Land Stock below par.\r\nIn 1908-09 the sums so withdrawn amounted to £90,000. That liability was\r\nremoved by Mr. Birrell's Act, and they now remain chargeable only with\r\nany arrears in the annuities paid by the purchasing tenants. This is a\r\nnegligible liability, and should properly be placed upon the Irish\r\nGovernment as a whole, which, if it pleased, could recover the money\r\nfrom localities.[124]\r\n\r\nWe now reach the category _(b)_ \"Voted,\" and find in the Irish column\r\nthe truly enormous sum of £8,026,000--nearly double that of Scotland\r\n(£4,180,500), which has a population slightly greater, and more than a\r\nthird of that of England (£26,121,500), which has a population eight\r\ntimes as great.\r\n\r\nWhen we search the various tables of detailed expenditure, three\r\nprominent items arrest our attention:\r\n\r\nConstabulary and Dublin Metropolitan Police[125]  £1,464,500\r\nOld Age Pensions                                  £2,408,000\r\nPublic (_i.e._, Primary) Education           £1,632,000\r\n\r\n                                                  £5,504,500\r\n\r\nThose three items may be said to epitomize the history of Ireland under\r\nthe Union--coercion, pauperization, deficient education. The first two\r\nare, of course, intimately connected. The existing cost of police,\r\nsurviving needlessly at the monstrous figure shown, represents the past\r\ncost of enforcing laws economically hurtful to Ireland. The economic\r\nhurt is reflected in the cost of Old Age Pensions paid to a\r\ndisproportionately large number of old people, below the official\r\nstandard of wealth, in a country drained by emigration for seventy years\r\npast of its strongest sons and daughters. Police in Ireland costs twice\r\nas much as in England and Scotland, where (with the exception of the\r\n_London Metropolitan Police_) it is a local, not a national charge,\r\nwhile Irish Old Age Pensions cost in 1910-11 more than twice as much as\r\nScottish Pensions, and amounted to two-fifths of English Pensions.[126]\r\nWith full allowance for excess payments owing to the lack of all birth\r\nrecords prior to a certain date, the Irish figure is relatively\r\nenormous. It is £100,000 greater than the whole cost of Irish Government\r\nin 1860, and, with the addition made in the estimates of the present\r\nyear, it is just a million more than what, according to Sir David\r\nBarbour's reasoning, would have been the whole cost of Irish Government\r\nin 1893-94, had Irish expenditure, like Irish revenue, been in\r\nproportion to the taxable capacity of Ireland.\r\n\r\nI touched upon the Irish aspect of the policy of Old Age Pensions at p.\r\n181. Whatever the pecuniary charge, I suggest that it is absolutely\r\nnecessary for Ireland in the future to control both payment and policy,\r\nand she might find it in her best interest, with due notice and due\r\nregard to present interests, to halve the scale of pensions. It is not a\r\nquestion of the general policy of Old Age Pensions, but of the\r\napplicability of a certain scale to Ireland, where agricultural wages\r\n(for example) average only 11s. 3d. as compared with 18s. 4d. for\r\nEngland, and 19s. 7d. for Scotland.[127] Of all ways of remedying a\r\nbackward economic condition, that of excessive pensions is the worst.\r\n\r\nThe cost of Irish Primary Education--£1,632,000, as I pointed out in\r\nChapter IX.--is at once too high and too low; too high in the sense that\r\nmuch of it is wasted owing to the lack of popular control, too low in\r\nthe sense that it is a scandal to spend nearly as much on police as on\r\nthe education of children, and £800,000 more on Old Age Pensions than on\r\nthe education of children. If part or even the whole of the additional\r\nexpense eventually necessary is raised by rates, so much the better.\r\nAccurate comparison is difficult with the English and Scottish\r\nexpenditure on elementary education, because the greater part of the\r\ncost in those countries is borne by private endowments and local rates,\r\nwhereas in Ireland no local rate is raised for elementary education,\r\nthere are no endowments, and private subscriptions are very small.[128]\r\nIt is certain, however, that far greater sums, in proportion to\r\npopulation, are spent in England and Scotland than in Ireland. This is\r\nlittle to be wondered at if we consider the painful history of education\r\nin Ireland; but we cannot recall the past, and, as I urged in Chapter\r\nIX., one of the first duties of a free Ireland will be to improve the\r\neducation of the children.\r\n\r\nThe Irish vote for Universities and Colleges, £166,000, has been swelled\r\nby the recent establishment of the National University. No item in the\r\nwhole list represents money better spent.\r\n\r\nWith regard to other Irish services, I shall make use, with Professor\r\nOldham's consent, of some interesting tables compiled by him, showing\r\nthe principal variations in Irish expenditure since the year\r\n1891-92.[129]\r\n\r\nThey include certain expenses which I have already alluded to, and\r\nothers which I shall have to remark upon further, besides giving a\r\ngeneral view of the growth in the cost of Irish government. Neither of\r\nlists A or B is exhaustive:\r\n\r\nA.

The Ireland Development Grant of £191,500 is interesting as an\r\nexample of the haphazard methods of Anglo-Irish finance. It is an annual\r\nsum voted for various development purposes, and was originally\r\nestablished (at the figure of £185,000) in 1903 as an equivalent for the\r\ncapitation grants for school attendance in England, given under the\r\nEducation Act of 1902 in lieu of school fees. In allotting the Irish\r\nequivalent, Mr. Goschen's proportion of 80, 11, 9 was for the first time\r\ncondemned by all parties. What the proportion ought to be was a matter\r\nof dispute, but it was fixed in this case on the basis of population.\r\nSince the English grant has now risen to £2,500,000, the Irish\r\nproportion therefore is now, strictly speaking, inadequate.\r\n\r\nNos. 6, 7, and 8 are examples of charges debited by the Treasury against\r\nIreland which are open to criticism as long as the Union lasts, and\r\nwhich meet with much complaint in Ireland. Obviously, however, the first\r\ntwo at any rate are charges which an Ireland financially independent\r\nwould have to bear.\r\n\r\nNo. 9. The Land Commission vote of £414,500 is of course the direct\r\nresult of an abnormally bad system, necessitating abnormal and costly\r\nremedial administration. Ireland herself is not morally responsible for\r\na penny of it, but if she is wise she will shoulder the cost as a\r\ncorollary of responsible government. Small administrative economies may\r\nbe made, and the cost will disappear altogether with the completion of\r\nLand Purchase, say in fifteen years, but in the immediate future no\r\nreduction can be counted on with certainty. The figure given includes\r\nthe cost of the Land Commission proper, which deals with Judicial Rents\r\nand manages finance, as well as the cost of the Estates Commissioners\r\nwho conduct the machinery of Land Purchase. It also includes losses on\r\nthe flotation of Land Stock at a discount, and the interest and\r\nsinking-fund on the Stock raised to pay the bonus to landlords.\r\n\r\nNo. 10. The vote of £415,000 for the Department of Agriculture, whose\r\norigin and functions I described in Chapter IX., does not accurately\r\nshow the actual cost of the Department, because it excludes the greater\r\npart of an Endowment Income of £166,000 a year, derived partly from the\r\nIrish Church Fund, partly from the Irish Local Taxation Account, and\r\npartly from the interest on a capital endowment of £200,000, as well as\r\nother small miscellaneous grants. But it includes a sum of about £44,000\r\nfor some museums, colleges, gardens, etc., whose English counterparts\r\nare subsidized under different votes, as well as the sum of £144,000\r\nfor the Congested Districts Board.[131] Nor does this latter sum\r\nrepresent the full cost of the Congested Districts Board, which has also\r\nan Endowment Income from the Irish Church Fund of £41,250, a subsidy\r\nfrom the Ireland Development Grant, and a fluctuating income from\r\nvarious sources--rents, etc.\r\n\r\nPart of the expense of the Department itself must be regarded as\r\nabnormal, in view of the extraordinarily backward economic condition of\r\nthe country when it was founded. Nor, valuable as the Department's work\r\nis, can it be safely assumed that the cost is not extravagant. As long\r\nas any Department relies on an Imperial vote there can be no certainty\r\nthat the expenditure will be economical. The whole cost of the Congested\r\nDistricts Board is abnormal. Its very existence is evidence of the\r\nfailure of external government in Ireland, and, as I urged in Chapter\r\nIX., the whole question of the treatment of the congested districts\r\nneeds thorough investigation at the hands of a responsible Irish\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n                  B.

The whole charge of two\r\nmillions, though it shows a slight decrease in twenty years, is grossly\r\nout of proportion to the resources of Ireland. Under heads 6 and 7 are\r\nincluded a number of posts which are notoriously little more than\r\nsinecures.\r\n\r\nTo sum up once more, the cost of the Irish Government as paid out of the\r\ncommon purse in the last completed financial year was £11,344,500, or £2\r\n11s. 9d. per head of the population, as compared with a cost per head of\r\n£1 9s. 2d. in England, and in Scotland of £1 13s. 31/2d. But this is not\r\nthe minimum figure with which we have to reckon in considering the Home\r\nRule scheme; some items show a marked increase in the Estimates of the\r\ncurrent year: (1) The increase in Old Age Pensions, not certain yet,\r\nwill be at least £250,000. (2) The Land Commission is £544,000, as\r\ncompared with £414,500. (3) Universities and Colleges, £186,256, as\r\ncompared with £166,000. (4) Department of Agriculture, £426,609, as\r\ncompared with £415,000. (5) Registrar-General's Office, £29,020, as\r\ncompared with £13,000. (6) Valuation and Boundary Survey, £44,581, as\r\ncompared with £30,000. (7) Public Works and Buildings in Ireland,\r\n£273,370, as compared with £215,000. Even with allowance for\r\nover-estimates, especially in the last of these items,[132] we must\r\nanticipate an increase of nearly half a million under the above heads,\r\nto which we must add £150,000 recently allocated by the Road Board to\r\nIreland for the year 1911-12, and £34,750 already allocated by the\r\nDevelopment Commissioners. If Ireland comes prematurely into the\r\nNational Insurance scheme, and assumes eventual financial responsibility\r\nfor her share of the cost, that will be an additional source of expense;\r\nbut it is to be hoped that her leaders, in common prudence, will\r\nhenceforth endeavour to stem the rising flood of Irish expenditure, and\r\nso facilitate the retrenchments imperatively necessary under Home Rule.\r\nAs it is, the total outgoings of the current year (1911-12), swelled by\r\nthe increases shown above, will probably amount to £12,000,000, while\r\nthis total will in its turn be added to by the office costs of the Irish\r\nLegislature and the salaries of Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe scheme framed cannot assume immediate economies, and a responsible\r\nIreland alone can decide the nature and extent of the drastic economies\r\nwhich must be made in the future. Beyond the brief remarks and hints\r\nmade in the course of this chapter, I myself venture only to lay down\r\nthe broad proposition that, to the last farthing, Irish revenue must\r\ngovern and limit Irish expenditure. For any hardship entailed in\r\nachieving that aim Ireland will find superabundant compensation in the\r\nmoral independence which is the foundation of national welfare. She will\r\nbe sorely tempted to sell part of her freedom for a price. At whatever\r\ncost, she will be wise to resist.\r\n\r\nIf Irish revenue is to be the measure of Irish expenditure, it follows\r\nthat it must be wholly, or at any rate predominately, under Irish\r\ncontrol. Let us look a little more closely, therefore, into its amount\r\nand composition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIRISH REVENUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have already pointed out, in order to arrive at the present revenue\r\nof Ireland, our best course is to take the mean tax revenue of the two\r\nyears 1909-10 and 1910-11, and to add to it the non-tax revenue of\r\n1910-11, which was, of course, unaffected by the delay in passing the\r\nBudget of 1909. For clearness, however, I first set out separately the\r\nIrish figures of these two years, distinguishing between tax revenue and\r\nnon-tax revenue, and giving the \"collected\" revenue and the \"true\"\r\nrevenue in different columns:\r\n\r\n                              1909-10.                    1910-11.\r\n\r\n                     Revenue as                 Revenue as\r\n                     Collected.    \"True.\"      Collected.     \"True\"\r\n\r\nTAX REVENUE.              £           £             £             £\r\nCustoms              2,742,000    2,755,000     3,103,000    2,977,000\r\nExcise               4,487,000    2,898,000     5,826,000    3,734,000\r\nEstate, etc., Duties   684,000      684,000     1,144,000    1,144,000\r\nStamps                 293,000      315,000       326,000      351,000\r\nIncome Tax             388,000      451,000     1,825,000    2,164,000\r\nLand Value Duties        --            --           1,000        1,000\r\n\r\nTotal Irish Revenue from\r\nTaxes                8,594,000    7,103,000     12,225,000  10,371,000\r\n\r\nNON-TAX REVENUE.\r\nPostal Service         900,000      900,000        935,000     935,000\r\nTelegraph Service      180,000      180,000        185,500     185,500\r\nTelephone Service       30,000       30,000         35,000      35,000\r\nCrown Lands             26,000       26,000         24,500      24,500\r\nMiscellaneous          116,000      116,000        114,500     114,500\r\n\r\nTotal Irish Non-Tax\r\nRevenue              1,252,000    1,252,000      1,294,500   1,294,500\r\n\r\nAggregate Irish      9,846,000    8,355,000     13,519,500  11,665,500\r\nRevenue\r\n\r\nPercentage of the Aggregate\r\nRevenue of the\r\nUnited Kingdom           7.52       6.38          6.57         5.67\r\n\r\nOn p. 276 are the details of the mean tax revenue, \"collected\" and\r\n\"true,\" of the two years 1909-10, 1910-11, with the non-tax revenue of\r\nthe latest year, 1910-11, added to them.\r\n\r\nPRESENT IRISH REVENUE (MEAN OF THE LAST TWO YEARS).\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails of Revenue.

Present Day,\r\n\r\nAggregates                            11,704,500       10,032,000\r\n\r\nThe two aggregate figures at the bottom, £11,704,500 and £10,032,000,\r\napproximately represent the Treasury estimate of the \"collected\" and the\r\n\"true\" revenue of Ireland, respectively, at the present day. They are\r\nconfirmed by the figures of previous years; for the average revenue of\r\nthe five years, 1904-09, was as follows: \"collected,\" £11,320,000;\r\n\"true\" or \"contributed,\" £9,612,400, the new taxation of 1909-10 having\r\nadded £500,000 to the \"true\" revenue. I must again remind the reader,\r\nhowever, that the figures are open to the criticism that the adjustment\r\nbetween the \"collected\" tax revenue and the \"true\" revenue is inaccurate\r\nowing to the methods employed by the Treasury. It will be observed that\r\nthe resulting net deduction from the \"collected\" tax revenue of to-day,\r\na deduction attributable, on the balance of the various figures, almost\r\nexclusively to Excise,[133] and mainly to the Excise duty on spirits,\r\namounts to £1,672,500, and makes all the difference between the solvency\r\nand insolvency of Ireland regarded as an independent financial unit. Her\r\nexpenditure, it will be remembered, was £11,344,500, her \"collected\"\r\nrevenue £11,704,500, leaving a surplus of £360,000, which becomes a\r\ndeficit of £1,312,500 if we reckon only the \"true\" or \"contributed\"\r\nrevenue of £10,032,000. On the other hand, the principle, as\r\ndistinguished from the methods of adjustment, is perfectly sound if we\r\nwish to arrive at a correct idea of the financial position of Ireland.\r\nThe £1,672,500 virtually represents the duties on goods exported from\r\nIreland, and consumed in Great Britain, or rather the excess of these\r\nduties over those levied on goods exported from Great Britain and\r\nconsumed in Ireland. The consumer pays the tax on dutiable commodities,\r\nand a financially independent Ireland could not raise revenue twice over\r\nfrom the same commodity. She would, for example, have to give a drawback\r\nfrom the Excise duty on spirits exported to England, since a Customs\r\nduty would be levied on its import into England. On the other hand, she\r\nwould be entitled to every penny of revenue derived from the tea and\r\nsugar imported into and consumed within her borders, and to the full\r\nincome tax on property held by Irishmen.\r\n\r\nNow, for two reasons, I do not propose to make any exhaustive inquiry\r\ninto the accuracy of Treasury adjustments for \"true\" revenue. My first\r\nreason is, that full material for calculation cannot be obtained by any\r\nprivate individual, and could not be obtained and worked up even by the\r\nTreasury without an enormous expenditure of time and trouble. The most\r\ncareful inquiry I have seen is embodied in an exceedingly able pamphlet\r\nby \"an Irishman,\" entitled \"The Financial Relations of Ireland with the\r\nImperial Exchequer,\" and I mention below a few of the criticisms made by\r\nthe writer. His and other investigations seem to prove that Irish\r\nrevenue is considerably underestimated, perhaps by half a million.[134]\r\nMy second reason is that errors of adjustment in either direction cannot\r\naffect in any substantial way the kind of financial scheme we are to\r\nadopt in the Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nLet us fix our attention, then, on the second of the two columns in the\r\ntable on p. 276, showing the aggregate \"true\" revenue of Ireland at the\r\npresent day. Disregard the non-tax revenue from the various postal\r\nservices (which represents payment for services rendered, and is\r\nswallowed up by an excess on the expenditure side of £249,000), and\r\nexamine the heads of tax revenue shown in the upper half of the column.\r\nIt will be seen that 70-75 per cent. of Irish \"true\" revenue is derived\r\nfrom Customs and Excise duties, which, with the exception perhaps of\r\nlicence duties, may be classed as indirect taxation. The deduction for\r\n\"true\" revenue, it will be observed, has considerably modified the\r\nproportion, which for \"collected\" revenue works out at 77.61 per cent.,\r\nor nearly four-fifths.\r\n\r\nAs the reader is aware, this is not a new feature in Irish finance. It\r\nformed the basis of the Report of the Financial Relations Commission\r\nwith regard to the over-taxation of Ireland. Much the greater part of\r\nIrish revenue, even since the abolition of protective duties and the\r\nsubstitution of direct taxation, has always been derived from taxes on\r\narticles of common consumption, the simple reason being that Ireland is\r\na country where there is little accumulated wealth from which to extract\r\ndirect taxation. In Great Britain, whose circumstances dictate the\r\nfinance of the United Kingdom, no less than 54.79 per cent. of the tax\r\nrevenue is derived from direct taxation, only 45.21 per cent. from\r\nCustoms and Excise.[135]\r\n\r\nThe Irish figures show that to retain in the hands of the Imperial\r\nParliament the control of Irish Customs and Excise will be to retain\r\nalmost paramount control over Irish revenue; to deny Ireland the main\r\nlever she needs for co-ordinating her expenditure and her revenue, and\r\nfor making her taxation suitable to her economic conditions. It will be\r\nto preserve the framework of a fiscal system which the highest financial\r\nauthorities have pronounced to be unfair to Ireland, and which\r\nincontrovertible facts show to be uneconomical both for Ireland and\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile that system has at length produced a deficit, with which I\r\nshall deal in the next chapter. Its amount, probably exaggerated, must\r\nnecessarily remain uncertain under the present fiscal Union. One thing\r\nalone is certain, that it will grow as long as that Union lasts.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115] _I.e._, on the generally accepted basis of (1) assessment to death\r\nduties, (2) assessment to income-tax. With regard to (1), in the last\r\nreport of the Inland Revenue Commissioners, the figure for the United\r\nKingdom was £371,808,534; for Ireland, £15,872,302, or 1/234. With\r\nregard to (2), the figure for the United Kingdom was 1009.9 millions;\r\nfor Ireland, 39.7 millions, or 1/254. Deduct a small allowance for the\r\ndifference between resources and taxable capacity, and the result\r\napproximately is one-twenty-fifth.\r\n\r\n[116]\r\n\r\nTotal revenue (including non-tax revenue) of United\r\n  Kingdom (mean of two years. 1909-10, 1910-11)     £165,147,500\r\nOne-twenty-fifth                                       £6,605,900\r\nActual \"true\" revenue contributed by Ireland (mean\r\n  of two years, 1909-10, 1910-11)                     £10,032,000\r\n                                                      -----------\r\n\"Over-taxation\"                                        £3,426,100\r\n\r\nIf only the tax-revenue be taken, the over-taxation amounts to\r\n£3,109,800 (total revenue for United Kingdom, £140,680,000;\r\none-twenty-fifth=£5,627,200; actual Irish revenue, £8,737,000). Some\r\nmembers of the Royal Commission made certain allowances for education\r\ngrants, etc., which it would be useless to parallel now.\r\n\r\n[117] See pp. 248-249.\r\n\r\n[118] See p. 259, footnote.\r\n\r\n[119] Treasury Return, No. 220, 1911.\r\n\r\n[120] A list is given at p. 10 of Return 220 (1911), and an admirable\r\nexposition of the whole subject from the Irish standpoint will be found\r\nin Professor Oldham's seventh published lecture on the \"Public Finances\r\nof Ireland\" (1911).\r\n\r\n[121] The \"Whisky Money\" was so treated under the Finance Act of 1910.\r\n\r\n[122] See p. 238.\r\n\r\n[123] Between 1896 and 1898 the equivalent grants to Scotland and\r\nIreland were based on the Goschen proportion, 80, 11, 9, the English\r\ngrant being taken as standard. Scotch grants are now determined by\r\nspecial legislation.\r\n\r\n[124] See Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\n[125] Only part of the Dublin Metropolitan Police is paid out of State\r\nFunds, the rest by the City of Dublin.\r\n\r\n[126] The relative figures were: Ireland, £2,408,000; Scotland,\r\n£1,064,000; England, £6,325,500. The recent removal of the\r\ndisqualification for Poor Law Relief adds considerably to these amounts.\r\n\r\n[127] In the poorest parts of Ireland they range as low as 9s.\r\n\r\n[128] See pp. 174-176. In 1908, England and Wales spent £21,987,004 on\r\nelementary education, and raised £10,467,804 for it in rates. Of the\r\nrest, £11,104,305 came from Parliamentary grants. Fees and endowment\r\nincomes of voluntary schools are not included (Statistical Abstract of\r\nUnited Kingdom, 1910).\r\n\r\nThe actual Parliamentary Votes, as they appear in the accounts for\r\n1910-11, are: England (Class IV.), \"Board of Education,\" £14,166,500;\r\nScotland, \"Public Education,\" £2,250,000; Ireland, \"Public Education,\"\r\n£1,632,000. But the English Votes include sums devoted to technical\r\neducation, museums, etc., whose counterparts in Ireland come under other\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\n[129] Two years earlier than the date I have chiefly used for the\r\npurposes of comparison, but the difference is not material. In point of\r\nfact, the expenditure was £300,000 less in the later than in the earlier\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[130] (1) Rates on Government Buildings; (2) Superannuation; (3)\r\nGovernment Printing; (4) Board of Works; (5) Home Office.\r\n\r\n[131] Department of Agriculture, Endowment Fund:\r\n\r\n                { (1) Local Taxation Account                £78,000\r\n  Income from --{ (2) Irish Church Fund                     £70,000\r\n                  (3) Interest on Capital sum of £200,000.\r\n\r\n  Also (in 1909-10):\r\n        From Ireland Development Fund   £7,000\r\n        Under an Act of 1902            £5,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[132] The amount _voted_ for Public Works in 1910-11 was £259,848 [see\r\n\"Civil Service Estimates\" for 1911-12 (No. 63--1911)]; the amount\r\n_spent_, according to Return No. 220, £215,000.\r\n\r\n[133] Under the heads of Excise, the principal deduction is in Spirits\r\n(£1,793,000 in 1910-11) and Beer (£309,000 in 1910-11).\r\n\r\nThe items of Irish tax revenue in which the Treasury make _no_\r\nadjustment are: Excise Licenses (£356,000 in 1910-11); Club Duty (£2,000\r\nin 1910-11); \"other items\" (£10,000 in 1910-11); Cards and Patent\r\nMedicines (£10,000 in 1910-11); \"Estate, etc., Duties\" (£1,144,000 in\r\n1910-11); Income Tax (Schedules A and B) (£694,000 in\r\n1910-11--abnormally large figure owing to non-collection in previous\r\nyear); Land Value Duties (£1,000 in 1910-11).\r\n\r\nAll the heads of Customs revenue are subject to adjustment, though the\r\ntotal result is only a small deduction from Ireland (£126,000 in\r\n1910-11). In all but two the adjustment is in favour of Ireland. The two\r\nexceptions are \"Foreign Spirits,\" where a deduction of £25,000 is made\r\nin 1910-11, and Tobacco, where a deduction of £620,000 is made in\r\n1910-11.\r\n\r\n[134] _Income Tax_, Schedules C and D (dividends from Government Stocks,\r\npublic companies, foreign dividends, etc.). The Treasury estimate (as\r\nstated in a side-note to the Return) is based on statistics of _Estate\r\nDuty_ for the five years ending 1908. But what light can Estate Duty\r\nthrow on (for example) the dividends collected at the source from\r\nBritish or foreign securities held by Irish banks? Schedule C deals with\r\n\"Government Stocks, etc.,\" Schedule D with \"Public Companies, Foreign\r\nDividends, etc.,\" but in the adjustment for \"true\" revenue no\r\ndistinction is made between them. Now the Banking Statistics (Ireland)\r\nof 1910 show that dividends were payable at the Bank of Ireland on\r\n£38,732,000 of Government securities, and that, in addition, a debt\r\nbearing interest was due to the Bank from the Government of 21/2 millions.\r\nIncome Tax on these items alone would be £65,000, less rebates; but the\r\nwhole of Schedule C, which includes Foreign and Colonial Government\r\nStocks, is given in 1909-10 as only £30,000.\r\n\r\nNo attempt is made to credit Ireland with a share of the profits made by\r\nEnglish and Scottish companies through business done in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe only reliable items in Income Tax are those of A and B (Land,\r\nHouses, and Occupation of Land), where in 1908-09 Ireland contributed\r\nabout 6 per cent. of the total; under other heads, according to the\r\nTreasury, only 3.5 per cent. The writer estimates the true contribution\r\nas several hundred thousand pounds more.\r\n\r\n_Post Office_.--The Treasury give no clue as to how they calculate the\r\nprofit and loss on Postal Services. Figures of letters, telegrams,\r\nparcels, etc., delivered in Ireland are known from the\r\nPostmaster-General's report, but the report does not distinguish Irish\r\nfrom English postal orders, of which 1211/2 millions were issued in the\r\nUnited Kingdom in 1909-10. There is good reason to believe that a part\r\nof the postal profit now wholly credited to England should in reality be\r\ncredited to Ireland.\r\n\r\n_Stamps_.--Far too little allowance is made by the Treasury for stamps\r\non transfers executed through English and Scottish exchanges for shares\r\nbought or sold by Irishmen, and for bonds, deeds, insurances, issues of\r\ncapital, etc.\r\n\r\n_Tea and Sugar_.--The Treasury base their calculation \"on quantities\r\ninter-changed between Great Britain and Ireland in 1903-04,\" and I learn\r\nfrom the Inland Revenue Department that by this means the consumption\r\nper head of the population was arrived at, and that the present official\r\nfigures are based on the assumption that the relation of consumption per\r\nhead in Ireland to consumption per head in the United Kingdom as a whole\r\nhas not altered since 1903-04. The unreliability of this assumption is\r\nmanifest. It is probable that the heavy additional duty on spirits has\r\nraised the consumption of tea in Ireland more than in Great Britain, and\r\nthe figures of Imports compiled by the Department of Agriculture seem to\r\nconfirm this view.\r\n\r\n[135] On the basis of the mean revenue of 1909-10 and 1910-11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTHE ESSENCE OF HOME RULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now sum up this financial question, and give its place in the\r\ngeneral problem of Home Rule. In Chapter X. I argued that, on broad\r\ngrounds of political policy, Ireland, in her own interest, and in the\r\ngeneral interest of the United Kingdom, should have \"Colonial\" Home Rule\r\nwithout representation in the Imperial Parliament. Leaving finance\r\ntemporarily aside, while observing that any substantial Imperial control\r\nover Irish finance would defeat the \"colonial\" solution of the problem,\r\nI endeavoured to show that there were no tenable grounds of a\r\nnon-financial character for retaining Irish Members at Westminster, nor\r\nany dangers to be feared from excluding them. I have now reviewed the\r\nhistory of Anglo-Irish finance up to the present day, and I hope in so\r\ndoing to have proved that, so far from presenting an obstacle to\r\n\"Colonial\" Home Rule, the financial conditions demand such a solution.\r\nFinance and policy are inseparably one. All the considerations which\r\nrender Home Rule desirable lead irresistibly to the financial\r\nindependence of Ireland, with complete control assigned to her over all\r\nbranches of taxation. Without financial independence it is impossible to\r\nrealize the objects of Home Rule. It would be a miracle were the case\r\notherwise. Ireland would, indeed, be abnormal if, after her history, she\r\ncould reach prosperity and stability without passing through a phase of\r\nfinancial independence. No parallel, even in the most distant degree,\r\ncould be found for any such metamorphosis in the whole of the British\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nIf we study Ireland's interest, we shall promote Imperial interests. The\r\nmain object of Home Rule is to make Ireland self-reliant. Lord Welby and\r\nhis colleagues were right in 1896 when they declared that ideal to be\r\nimpracticable without giving Ireland entire responsibility both for her\r\nrevenue and her expenditure. This declaration is as true as ever. The\r\nsituation has changed only in one respect: that financial independence\r\nwill now mean a financial sacrifice to Ireland, whereas in 1896 it would\r\nhave meant a financial gain to Ireland--that is, if Lord Welby's\r\nrecommendation in favour of remitting the Irish contribution to Imperial\r\nservices had been carried out. At that time Ireland contributed two\r\nmillions. Now Great Britain contributes over a million to Ireland.\r\nSooner or later that subsidy must stop, and the sooner it stops the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nBut it is of vital importance that Ireland should understand the\r\nsituation. The present position is dangerous, because the Irish people\r\nat large are ignorant of the facts, and their leaders are taking no\r\nsteps to enlighten them. The reasons are intelligible, but they are not\r\nsound reasons. Paced with the facts and the choice, Ireland would not\r\nhesitate, but she must know the facts and understand the nature of the\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE DEFICIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us deal at once with the question of the deficit. It is\r\ninconceivable surely that the existence of a deficit should be used as\r\nan argument against financial independence, much less as an argument\r\nagainst Home Rule in general. Will anyone be found to say that an island\r\nwith a fertile soil, several nourishing industries, and a clever\r\npopulation of four and a half millions, is to be regarded, whatever its\r\npast history, as incapable of supporting a Government of its own out of\r\nits own resources? Let nobody be tempted by the fallacy that, given\r\ntime, Ireland will regain financial stability under the fiscal Union,\r\nand at a later stage, perhaps, be more fitted to bear the burden of\r\nfiscal independence. The supposition is chimerical. The present system,\r\nbesides being radically vicious in a purely scientific sense, undermines\r\nthe moral power of Ireland to secure her own regeneration.\r\n\r\nIt is now 1911. The deficit, once a large surplus, came into being only\r\ntwo years ago. It was the direct and inevitable result of a fiscal Union\r\nagainst which Ireland has for generations unceasingly protested, and it\r\nwas a result actually foretold in 1896 by Lord Welby and his two\r\ncolleagues. It could have been averted, as they pointed out, only by a\r\nform of Home Rule giving financial independence to Ireland. But the\r\nwarning was older than the Report of the Financial Relations Commission.\r\nMr. Gladstone told the House of Commons in 1886, when introducing his\r\nHome Rule Bill, that no limit could be set to Irish expenditure under\r\nthe Union; he and Sir William Harcourt repeated the warning in 1893, and\r\nif the reader will study the debates on the financial clauses of the\r\nBill of 1893,[136] he will find pages of bitter diatribe founded on the\r\nsmall net contribution from Ireland to Imperial services for which the\r\nrevised financial scheme provided. Ireland, said the Opposition, was to\r\nmake money out of Great Britain, and escape her fair proportion of\r\nImperial charges. Mr. Chamberlain showed that, with allowance for\r\npayment from the Imperial purse of part of the cost of Irish police, the\r\nnet initial contribution was about one-fortieth, and asked: \"Is Irish\r\npatriotism a plant of such sickly growth that it has to be watered with\r\nBritish gold?\" The taunt was as pointless as it was cruel, for although\r\nthe Union had kept Ireland poor, Irish leaders, in spite of that\r\npoverty, had asked for a financial independence which Mr. Gladstone in\r\nneither of his Bills felt disposed to give her. Mr. Chamberlain had his\r\nway; the Union was maintained, and as a result Ireland's actual\r\ncontribution of two millions at that date has been replaced by a subsidy\r\nfrom Great Britain. Are we to be told now by Unionists that the Union\r\nmust be maintained in order to maintain this subsidy? or by Home Rulers\r\nthat the Irish deficit is an argument for the perpetuation of the\r\nfinancial dependence which caused it, and an insuperable bar to the\r\nfinancial independence which alone can extinguish it?\r\n\r\nNo; let us look the facts in the face. Here is a deficit officially\r\ngiven as £1,312,000. It is probably less, owing to an underestimate of\r\nIrish revenue. But it may grow to be more, even with allowance for an\r\nautomatic growth of revenue, owing to the increased votes of the present\r\nyear, and the expenses peculiar to the establishment of the new Irish\r\nLegislature and Government. What her really healthy and normal revenue\r\nshould be only Ireland herself can discover in the future. What her\r\nright expenditure should be she alone can determine. We can only work\r\nupon the data we have before us. Economy cannot be instantaneous, either\r\nin Ireland or anywhere else. Assume, then, an initial deficit in the\r\nIrish balance-sheet on the basis of present taxation. Its exact size\r\ncannot affect the manner of dealing with it. How are we to deal with it?\r\n\r\nLet us dismiss at once the theory of \"restitution\" with the earnest hope\r\nthat we shall hear nothing of it in the coming controversy. No Irishman\r\nwill argue that a subsidy to the extent of, or exceeding the deficit, is\r\na good thing in itself, and should be large and lasting because it will\r\nrepresent compensation for money unfairly exacted in the past. It is,\r\nindeed, true that the Union impoverished Ireland, but the most grievous\r\nwrong was moral, and for that wrong alone is reparation possible. Home\r\nRule is not worth fighting for if it has not as its end and aim a\r\nself-reliant and self-supporting Ireland. Nor does it improve the\r\nargument in the least to represent the subsidy as productive expenditure\r\nfor the purpose of raising Ireland's taxable capacity and improving her\r\neconomic position. No money raised outside of Ireland will have that\r\neffect. Once admit the principle of restitution, and where are you to\r\nstop? What rational or scientific limit can be set to it? More pertinent\r\nquestion still, what are the conditions which will inevitably be imposed\r\nin exchange? Ireland cannot have it both ways. She must either hold out\r\nfor financial independence or, for every financial boon, submit to a\r\ncorresponding deduction from her political liberty.\r\n\r\nIf there were no alternative between financial independence without a\r\nfarthing of temporary aid, and permanent financial dependence with a\r\npermanent loss of liberty, it would pay Ireland a thousandfold in the\r\nfuture to choose the former scheme, remodel taxation promptly to meet\r\nthe initial deficit, and with equal promptitude set on foot such a\r\ndrastic reduction of expenditure as would ensure the rapid attainment of\r\na proper financial equilibrium. When once the Irish realized the issue,\r\nthey would accept the responsibility with all its attendant sacrifices,\r\nwhich would no doubt be severe.\r\n\r\nBut there is an alternative, and that is to make good the initial\r\ndeficit, whatever the financial authorities finally pronounce it to be,\r\nwith an initial subsidy of equal size, or perhaps of somewhat greater\r\nsize so as to admit of a small initial surplus, _but destined to\r\ndiminish by stated amounts, and within a few years to terminate_. To\r\nsuch assistance, given unconditionally, Ireland has an unanswerable\r\nclaim, and to such assistance she ought, in my opinion, to limit her\r\nclaim. Until two years ago she contributed uninterruptedly, and\r\nsometimes excessively, to the support of the Empire. With men and money\r\nshe has made efforts for the common weal which no self-governing Colony\r\nhas made, though she has been treated, politically and financially, as\r\nnot even a Crown Colony has been treated. Just at the point where the\r\nself-governing Colonies, thanks to the liberty allowed them, are\r\nbeginning to contribute indirectly to the defence of the Empire,\r\nIreland, as the ultimate result of a century of coercive government,\r\nceases to contribute. She can claim honourably, if she wills, to be\r\nplaced, by temporary financial aid from the authority which is\r\nresponsible for her undoing, in the financial position of a\r\nself-governing Colony.\r\n\r\nFrom the British point of view it is difficult to see any valid\r\nobjection to the course suggested. There will be no stinginess in the\r\nsettlement. Even if there were any disposition in that direction, it\r\nwould be idle to grudge the initial subsidy, because an equivalent sum\r\nis already being paid. The Union will infallibly continue to accentuate\r\nthe deficit and increase the resulting burden on the taxpayers of Great\r\nBritain. The plan proposed would eventually remove that burden. But,\r\nobviously, its success hinges on the concession of full financial powers\r\nto an Ireland unrepresented at Westminster. In their own interests, if\r\nnot for very shame, Englishmen should decline to make use of the old\r\nadage, that \"he who pays the piper should call the tune.\" For more than\r\na century Ireland paid the piper and England called the tune--and what a\r\ntune, and with what results! Representation has nothing to do with the\r\ncase. Precedents are needless, but there are, as a fact, many. Crown\r\nColonies have frequently received free grants for the relief of\r\ndistress--Jamaica and other West Indian islands, for example. The\r\nTransvaal and Orange River Colony received several millions after the\r\nwar to enable the ruined farmers to start business on a footing of\r\nsolvency. During the whole period of their adolescence, and, indeed,\r\nuntil quite a recent date, all the self-governing Colonies were\r\nvirtually subsidized by the allocation of British forces for local\r\ndefence, maintained at the Imperial charge. And Ireland paid her share\r\nof this charge. Similar garrisons were, are, and will be, maintained in\r\nIreland. Yes, but Ireland contributed to their cost, and in course of\r\ntime will, it is to be hoped, resume her contributions with a gladder\r\nheart and a freer conscience than ever before.\r\n\r\nCanada was economically stagnant under coercion. If, in her case, we had\r\ncarried coercion as far as we carried it in Ireland, it would have been\r\nnecessary to give her a temporary subsidy in order to enable her to\r\nassume the position of a self-governing Colony. Ireland's proximity does\r\nnot alter economic laws. \"Facts are stubborn things,\" and these are the\r\nIrish facts. Duty apart, no more profitable investment could possibly be\r\nmade by the British tax-payer than a subsidy designed to enable Ireland\r\nto stand on her legs again. The present tribute to her is a dead loss.\r\n\r\nThe subsidy, if given, ought, I submit, on no account to be earmarked,\r\non the bad precedent set by the Bills of 1886 and 1893,[137] for any\r\nparticular head of expenditure in Ireland, as for Police, Pensions, Land\r\nCommission, or Education. As I have shown previously, nothing is easier\r\nthan to pick out items of excessive expenditure, or of\r\nunder-expenditure, for which Ireland is not herself responsible. But to\r\nallocate a grant specially to any of these purposes would be superfluous\r\nunless the intention were to maintain Imperial control over the service\r\nin question. As I urged in Chapter X., none of the services mentioned\r\nabove ought to be retained under Imperial control. Extravagance in the\r\nfirst three will not be properly checked, save by a responsible Ireland.\r\nNor will extra money on Education be properly spent until it is raised\r\nand spent by Ireland. There are no other services, with the possible\r\nexception of Posts, to which a subsidy could possibly be applicable.\r\nEven in that case an earmarked subsidy would be out of place. But Posts\r\nare outside the point we are discussing. If for mutual convenience they\r\nwere to be kept under Imperial control--a step which would not render\r\nimperative Irish representation at Westminster--their finance would\r\nremain, as at present, common to the whole United Kingdom. There is\r\nofficially held, on bad evidence, to be a loss on Irish Posts of\r\n£249,000, and this loss is debited against Ireland, and goes to swell\r\nthe deficit we have been considering. With the Posts under Imperial\r\ncontrol, the initial deficit to be made good by subsidy would be reduced\r\nby the amount of the loss. Should it, however, be decided that Ireland\r\nis fairly entitled to a share of the large general profit earned by the\r\nPostal Services of the United Kingdom, the annual profit so attributable\r\nto Ireland would be set off against the annual subsidy as long as the\r\nsubsidy lasted, and after it was at an end would be a clear item of\r\nrevenue to Ireland. My own opinion, as I stated in Chapter X., is that\r\nthe Irish postal system, whether standing by itself it shows a profit or\r\na loss, ought to be under Irish control.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFUTURE CONTRIBUTION TO IMPERIAL SERVICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis must be left a voluntary matter for Ireland, as it is for the\r\nself-governing Colonies. There is no contribution from Ireland at\r\npresent, and to fix a future date at which a fixed contribution, like\r\nthat from the Isle of Man, should begin, is a course hardly practicable\r\neven if it were desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIRELAND'S SHARE OF THE NATIONAL DEBT.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil two years ago Ireland, of course, contributed, _inter alia_, to\r\nthe annual interest and sinking fund, amounting in 1910-11 to\r\n£24,554,000, on the National Debt of the United Kingdom. It is\r\nimpossible to estimate her share of the capital of the Debt, and I\r\nscarcely think that anyone would seriously propose to encumber the new\r\nIreland with an old Debt, based on some arbitrary estimate. For the\r\ngreat bulk of Debt created in the past she has little moral\r\nresponsibility--no more, at any rate, than the self-governing Colonies.\r\nIn this respect she must begin, like them, with a clean sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nIRELAND'S SHARE OF IMPERIAL MISCELLANEOUS REVENUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Ireland, in consideration of the remissions\r\nmentioned, must renounce the share to which she is technically entitled\r\nof the Imperial Miscellaneous Revenue, derived mainly from Suez Canal\r\nshares and the Mint, and amounting altogether in 1910-11 to\r\n£2,769,500.[138]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nIRISH CONTROL OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now come to close quarters with this important issue. The grand\r\nargument on the affirmative side is that the products of these duties\r\nrepresent nearly four-fifths of the tax revenue collected in Ireland.\r\nWhat are the objections?\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely consider the general objection, sometimes made\r\nostensibly in the interests of Ireland, that her public men have little\r\nfinancial experience. The fact is true, and it is not their fault. But\r\nthe financial scheme cannot reasonably be based on a recognition of a\r\ntemporary lack of experience.\r\n\r\nI place Customs and Excise together because I believe there is no\r\nserious question of making a distinction between the two, and of\r\nallowing Ireland to levy and collect her own Excise duties, while\r\ndenying her authority over Customs. It is true that until 1860 such a\r\ndistinction was made, and a lower Excise duty levied upon Irish than\r\nupon British spirits;[139] but the tendency in all modern States is to\r\nmake the authority over Customs the same as that over Excise, and any\r\ndeparture from that principle, in the case of modern Ireland, is likely\r\nto cause considerable inconvenience. License Duties, which are included\r\nunder the head of Excise, may, no doubt, without much inconvenience, be\r\ndifferentiated from the rest, but their Irish proceeds (£284,000) are\r\ntoo small to influence the question.\r\n\r\nExcise, then, follows Customs. What are the objections to giving\r\nIreland, like the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, control over her\r\nown Customs? Without doubt, the establishment of a new Customs barrier\r\nbetween Ireland and Great Britain is in itself a drawback. The\r\nCustom-house machinery exists, of course, at present, because Ireland is\r\nan island; nor would the additional function of checking British as well\r\nas foreign imports into Ireland cause any great increase of expense; but\r\nsince the great bulk of Irish external trade is with Great Britain,\r\nthere will unquestionably be a certain amount of inconvenience and\r\nexpense both to Ireland and Great Britain in submitting merchandise on\r\nboth sides of the Irish Channel to the passage of a Customs barrier.\r\n\r\nThat seems to be the limit to which criticism can justly go in the case\r\nof Ireland and Great Britain. That is as far as it goes in the analogous\r\ncase of New Zealand and the Australian Commonwealth, where a small\r\nisland State has a separate Customs system from that of a large,\r\nwealthy, and populous neighbour of the same race, and with many\r\nidentical interests. That is as far as it goes in the parallel case of\r\nlittle Newfoundland and the great Dominion of Canada. Neither the\r\nDominion nor the Commonwealth claim that proximity, power, and racial\r\nidentity give them the right to control the trade and taxation of their\r\nsmall independent neighbours, nor does the smallest friction result from\r\nthe mutual independence. On the contrary, both the Dominions and the\r\nCommonwealth were founded on that vital principle of a pre-existent\r\nState independence surrendered voluntarily for larger ends. The whole\r\nEmpire depends on the principle of local autonomy, and, above all, on\r\nthe principle of local financial autonomy. Endeavours in America to\r\nsustain the opposite theory led to disaster. We have for generations\r\nregarded it as perfectly natural that the self-governing Colonies should\r\nhave Customs systems of their own, even when they are used for the\r\npurpose of imposing heavy duties on goods coming from the Mother\r\nCountry, and we know that that liberty has borne fruit a hundredfold in\r\naffection and loyalty to the Imperial Government. Until the Union of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland it was regarded as equally natural that\r\nIreland should have control of her own Customs, along with all other\r\nbranches of revenue. Even after the Union, although there was no Irish\r\ncontrol over anything Irish, it was recognized, until the fiscal\r\nunification of the two countries in 1817, that Irish conditions required\r\na separate Customs system, which, in fact, existed until 1826.[140] How\r\nfiscal unification and the subsequent abolition of separate Customs was\r\nbrought about I have told in Chapter XI. It is not a pleasant story. To\r\nsay the least, the conditions, moral and material, were not such as to\r\nwarrant the inference that there is any inherent necessity for joint\r\nCustoms between Ireland and Great Britain. The presumption raised by all\r\nsubsequent events is in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nBut the tradition of unified Customs, now nearly a century old, has\r\nimmense potency, and unless it is fearlessly scrutinized and challenged,\r\nmay be able, reinforced by the passions excited by the great controversy\r\nover Free Trade and Protection, to defy the warnings writ large upon the\r\npage of history. The tradition must be so challenged. Say what we will\r\nabout the proximity of Ireland and Great Britain, descant as we will in\r\nlaw-books, pamphlets, leading articles, debates, on what ought\r\ntheoretically to be the fiscal relations of the two countries, we cannot\r\nescape from the fact that, in this as in so many other respects, both\r\nthe human and economic problem before us is fundamentally a colonial\r\nproblem, and that its being so is not the fault of Ireland, but of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nBelief in Home Rule seems to me necessarily to involve a willingness to\r\ngive Ireland her Customs. Great Britain has no moral right to lay it\r\ndown that her views about trade shall govern the course of Irish policy;\r\nand if Great Britain believes sincerely in Home Rule, she should be\r\nwilling to trust Ireland, regardless of the economic consequences, and\r\nregardless of the effect upon the great Tariff controversy.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon that controversy I shall not discuss. It seems to me to\r\npossess only a tactical and electioneering interest, and that side of\r\nthe Home Rule problem I have rigidly avoided, while expressing in\r\ngeneral terms my belief that sound policy and sound tactics in reality\r\ncoincide. The Home Rule Bill is far more likely to be wrecked by\r\ntimidity than by boldness, by precautions and compromises than by a\r\nfearless accommodation of British policy to Irish facts and needs.\r\n\r\nAs to the danger to Great Britain of separate Irish Customs, it seems\r\nto me to be greatly exaggerated. Ireland's own interests will primarily\r\ndictate her action. What she will decide her interest to be, nobody can\r\nforetell with certainty beyond a limited point, because Irish public\r\nopinion is not formed. Ireland has taken little or no part in the fiscal\r\ncontroversy, for the simple reason that she has been absorbed in the\r\ntask of getting Home Rule, and until she gets it she is precluded from\r\nformulating a trustworthy national opinion on most of the great subjects\r\nwhich agitate modern societies. There is, however, no tradition in\r\nfavour of high Protection, even from Grattan's commercially free\r\nParliament. The question of a low protective or purely revenue tariff on\r\nimports has not received any serious investigation. Let us frankly admit\r\nat the outset that no country in the world, economically situated as\r\nIreland is, dispenses with a general tariff of some sort, and\r\nundoubtedly there are to-day a good many Irishmen outside political life\r\nwho advocate the encouragement of infant Irish manufacturing industries\r\nby sufficient protective duties directed against Great Britain as well\r\nas against the outside world. It would be strange if there were not, in\r\nview of the distressing past history of Ireland's throttled industries,\r\nand in view of the strenuous efforts now being made by the Development\r\nAssociations to push the manufacture and sale of Irish goods in all\r\nparts of the world. There are many avowed Free Traders also; nor are the\r\nDevelopment Associations themselves officially protectionist. The\r\nopinion is sometimes expressed that Ireland, which could easily be\r\nself-supporting in the matter of food, occupies an unhealthy position in\r\nexporting a large proportion of her own agricultural produce, butter,\r\nbacon, meat, etc., and in importing for her own consumption inferior\r\nBritish and foreign qualities of some of the principal foodstuffs; but,\r\nso far as it is possible to ascertain it, the predominant opinion seems\r\nto be that an agricultural tariff would not be a good remedy for this\r\nweakness, if it be one, and that Ireland's future development, like that\r\nof Denmark, lies in the increasingly scientific organization of her\r\nagricultural industries, and in the better cultivation of her own soil.\r\n\"Better farming, better business, better living,\" to use the admirable\r\nmotto invented by Sir Horace Plunkett for the I.A.O.S. In the absence of\r\nan Irish Legislature, no special importance can be attached to\r\nindividual expressions of opinion. Yet a measure of prophecy is\r\npermissible. The Irish Legislature will have to study the national\r\ninterest, and it is possible to say with certainty at least this--that\r\nIreland's interest lies in maintaining close and friendly trade\r\nrelations with Great Britain. Unfortunately, we have no means of\r\naccurately ascertaining the amount of trade done by Ireland with Great\r\nBritain and with foreign and colonial countries respectively. Irish\r\ncommerce takes, of course, three forms: _(a)_ Direct trade with\r\ncountries outside Great Britain; _(b)_ indirect trade with these\r\ncountries via Great Britain; _(c)_ direct local trade with Great\r\nBritain. The statisticians of the Irish Department of Agriculture make\r\nonly an imperfect attempt to distinguish between these classes, but\r\ntheir figures, so far as they go, prove beyond question that the great\r\nbulk of Irish external commerce belongs to Class _(c)_--local trade with\r\nGreat Britain. The total value of Irish trade in 1909 is estimated at\r\n£125,675,847, of which £63,947,155 was for imports, £61,728,692 for\r\nexports. Probably 80 per cent., at least, of this trade was strictly\r\nlocal. Certainly Great Britain is the market for very nearly the whole\r\nof Irish agricultural produce, and for most of her exports of linen,\r\nships, tobacco, liquor, etc. Any aggressive action likely to provoke a\r\ntariff war would be ruinous to Ireland, while it would hurt Great\r\nBritain far less in proportion. But, in fact, both countries would\r\nsuffer, Great Britain from the loss of an easily accessible food-supply\r\nof extraordinary value, not only for economic, but for strategical\r\nreasons; Ireland from the loss of an excellent and indispensable\r\ncustomer.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, whatever Ireland's trade policy may be, she certainly\r\nneeds the power of fixing her own duties upon commodities like tea and\r\nsugar, which are of foreign origin, and are now merely transported to\r\nher through British ports. Taxation of this sort is a matter of the\r\ndeepest concern to a country where agricultural wages average only\r\neleven shillings a week, and which cannot reduce its exorbitant Old Age\r\nPensions Bill without giving some compensatory relief to the classes\r\nconcerned. Tobacco, of which in its manufactured forms Ireland is a\r\nconsiderable producer as well as a large consumer, belongs to the same\r\ncategory. Liquor is an important article of production in Ireland, as\r\nwell as of consumption, and the Irish Legislature ought to be able to\r\nform and carry out its own liquor policy. Ireland is just as able and\r\nwilling to promote temperance as Great Britain, and just as competent to\r\nreconcile a temperance policy with due regard to producing and\r\ndistributing interests.\r\n\r\nThe Customs tariff is an Irish question, not an Ulster question. The\r\ninterests of the Protestant farmers of North-East Ulster are identical\r\nwith those of the rest of Ireland, and obviously it will be a matter of\r\nthe profoundest importance for Ireland as a whole to safeguard the\r\ninterests of the shipbuilding and linen industries in the North in\r\nwhatever way may seem best. The Industrial Development Associations,\r\nwhich are affiliated in a national organization, and are far above petty\r\nsectarian jealousies, may be trusted to see that Ireland steers a safe\r\nfinancial course in her trade policy.\r\n\r\nIf there is little or no danger that a Home-Ruled Ireland will commit\r\ntariff follies of her own, she has unquestionably a right to escape from\r\nfurther entanglement in the tariff policy of Great Britain. What may be\r\nthe issue of Great Britain's great fiscal controversy nobody can\r\nforetell. But as long as a protective tariff remains the cardinal point\r\nin the constructive policy of one of the British parties, there is a\r\nstrong likelihood of such a tariff, which would be uniform for the whole\r\nUnited Kingdom, being carried into law. Free Traders, like myself, may\r\ndeplore the possibility, but we cannot shut our eyes to it. That tariff,\r\nif and when it is framed, will, like the Free Trade tariff of the past,\r\nbe framed without regard to Irish interests, which are predominantly\r\nagricultural, and with exclusive regard to British interests, which are\r\nmainly industrial. Whatever may have been the original ideal of the\r\nConservative Protectionists, however highly they may once have valued\r\nthe protection of agriculture, irresistible political forces have driven\r\nthem in the direction of a tariff framed mainly to secure the adhesion\r\nof the great manufacturing towns. The electoral power of these towns,\r\nthe growing resentment of the working classes in most parts of the world\r\nat the increasing cost of living, the fact that Great Britain cannot\r\nunder any conceivable circumstances feed her own population, have been\r\nreflected in the definite abandonment by the party leaders of the\r\nproposed small duty against colonial imports, and in the admission by\r\nMr. Bonar Law at Manchester, during the last General Election, that the\r\nproposed tariff would not benefit the farmers. Nor will the failure of\r\nthe Reciprocity Agreement between Canada and the United States\r\nappreciably diminish the obstacles to food-taxes in the United Kingdom.\r\nAny practicable protective tariff, therefore, on the ground of its\r\ninjustice to Ireland, would cause strong and legitimate resentment in\r\nthat country, which is subjected to the most formidable competition from\r\nforeign and colonial foodstuffs, but whose great competition in\r\nmanufactured goods is Great Britain herself. The one Irish industry\r\nwhich might favour it is the linen industry of the North. It would have\r\nno attraction for the shipbuilding industry, which in no part of the\r\nBritish Isles has anything to gain by Protection, as I believe all\r\nparties to the controversy agree. Other small manufacturing industries\r\nwould complain that they gained nothing; while the agricultural\r\npopulation would complain that, as consumers, they would be damaged by\r\nhigher prices for clothing and other manufactured articles, while as\r\nproducers they were ignored.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is only one further proof of the dissimilarity of\r\neconomic conditions between Great Britain and Ireland, and of the\r\nartificial and unnatural character of the present fiscal union. Justice\r\nto Ireland demands its dissolution. The dangers are imaginary. Liberals,\r\nhowever firm their belief in Free Trade, should hold, with Lord Welby\r\nand his Home Rule colleagues on the Financial Relations Commission, that\r\n\"even if Ireland initiates a protective policy, in this case, as in that\r\nof the Colonies, freedom is a greater good than Free Trade.\" As for the\r\nProtectionists, I have never seen an argument from that source, and I do\r\nnot see how any consistent or plausible argument could possibly be\r\nframed, to show that a uniform tariff for the United Kingdom could be\r\nfair to Ireland. Professor Hewins, the leading Tariff Reform economist,\r\nvirtually acknowledges the impossibility in his Introduction to Miss\r\nMurray's \"Commercial Relations between England and Ireland.\" There were\r\ntwo sound lines of policy, he points out, which might have been adopted\r\ntowards Ireland in the period prior to the Union: (1)To have placed her\r\non a level of equality with the Colonies, applying the mercantile\r\nsystem indiscriminately and impartially to the Colonies and to her; or\r\n(2) to have aimed from the first at the financial and commercial unity\r\nof the British Isles. Neither of these courses was taken. Ireland, while\r\nkept financially and commercially separate, \"was in a less favourable\r\nposition than that of a Colony.\" With regard to the present, \"Most of\r\nthe difficulties of an economic character,\" says the Professor, \"in the\r\nfinancial relations between England and Ireland, arise from the\r\ndifferences of economic structure and organization between the two\r\ncountries. If Ireland were a highly organized, populous, manufacturing\r\ncountry, the present fiscal system would probably work out no worse than\r\nit does in the urban districts of Great Britain. But whatever be the\r\nvirtues or demerits of that system, it was certainly not framed with any\r\nreference to the economic conditions which prevail in Ireland.\" We wait\r\nfor the seemingly unavoidable political inference, but in vain.\r\nProfessor Hewins is a Unionist. \"A 'national' policy for Ireland ... is\r\nnever likely to be possible.\" Well, that is plain speaking, and the more\r\nplainly these things are said the better. Let Unionists, if they will,\r\ntell Ireland frankly that she must eternally suffer for the Union, but\r\nlet them not pretend, as they do pretend, that Ireland profits by the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL FINANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly we leave the simple path of financial independence, and\r\nendeavour to construct schemes which on the one hand disguise the\r\nfinancial difficulties of Ireland, and on the other provide for Imperial\r\ncontrol of Irish Customs and Excise, we involve ourselves in a tangle of\r\ndifficulties. A brief examination of these schemes will throw into still\r\nstronger relief the merits of the simpler solution.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let us dispose finally of the Federal analogy. In Chapter\r\nX. I showed that the framework of Home Rule cannot be Federal, because\r\nthe conditions of Federation do not exist in the United Kingdom. One of\r\nthe invariable features of a Federation is the Federal control of\r\nCustoms and Excise, but I pointed out that an equally invariable\r\ncondition precedent to Federation was the willingness on the part of a\r\nself-supporting State, previously possessing complete financial\r\nindependence, to abandon its individual control over this realm of\r\ntaxation to a Federal Government of its own choosing,[141] and that no\r\nsuch condition existed in the case of Ireland. But some features of\r\nFederal finance undoubtedly may be made to show a superficial analogy to\r\nAnglo-Irish conditions, and may therefore have an attraction for those\r\nwho shrink from giving Ireland financial independence. In the first\r\nplace, it is possible to find Federal precedents for the payment out of\r\nthe common purse of certain large items of Irish expenditure. There is\r\nno precedent for the payment of Police, but Old Age Pensions, for\r\nexample, are paid in Australia by the Commonwealth, not by the States.\r\nThe chief point of interest, however, is the mechanism of Federal\r\nfinance. The Australian and Canadian Federations are the only two which\r\nsuggest even a remote parallel. There the subordinate States are\r\nactually \"subsidized\" by regular annual payments out of Federal\r\nrevenues, mainly derived from Customs and Excise, and in the case of\r\nAustralia, as I observed at p. 245, the process at present entails an\r\nelaborate system of bookkeeping to distinguish between the \"collected\"\r\nand \"true\" revenue of the several States, similar in kind to the\r\ncalculations now made by the Treasury for ascertaining the \"collected\"\r\nand \"true\" revenue derived from Ireland, Scotland, and England.[142]\r\n\r\nIn Australia this system of bookkeeping is discredited, although the\r\nrecent attempt by a Commonwealth Referendum to abolish both it and the\r\nfinancial system of which it forms a part just failed. It is to be hoped\r\nthat, whatever financial scheme is adopted for Ireland, this bad\r\ncolonial precedent, together with the precedent of the Home Rule Bill of\r\n1893, will not be made pretexts for perpetuating a system whose defects\r\nare so glaring, and which is a source of continual dissatisfaction to\r\nIreland. If Irish Customs and Excise are to be outside Irish control,\r\nwhile their proceeds are to be credited to Ireland, let her whole\r\ncollected revenue from those sources be credited to her, in spite of the\r\nexcessive allocation that step would involve.\r\n\r\nApart from this point of similarity in mechanism, the Australian and\r\nCanadian subsidies to the States and Provinces respectively are of no\r\nvalue as models for a Home Rule Bill. Let us examine the case of\r\nAustralia. There the Commonwealth, besides having exclusive control of\r\nCustoms and Excise, has general powers of taxation concurrently with the\r\nStates, though in practice Commonwealth taxation is almost entirely\r\nconfined to Customs and Excise. All surplus Commonwealth revenue is, by\r\nthe present law, returnable to the States, and the total annual amount\r\nso returned must not be less than three-fourths of the total proceeds of\r\nCustoms and Excise; so large are these proceeds, and so small,\r\nrelatively, the expenses of the Commonwealth Government.[143] Here at\r\nthe outset is a feature which places Australian Federal Finance in an\r\naltogether different category to that of the United Kingdom, where only\r\n47.6 per cent, of the revenue is from Customs and Excise. Nor are the\r\ndistributions of surplus revenue to the States really \"subsidies,\" even\r\nin the case of the poorest States, but repayments, on a method laid down\r\nin the Constitution, of that part of the State contribution to Federal\r\nservices which the Federal Government does not want. Here the system of\r\nbookkeeping is of some service to us, because it reveals, approximately,\r\nat any rate, both the contribution and the actual repayment, which is\r\nbased on a calculation of the amount saved to the State by the\r\ntransference of certain departments to the Federal Government, set off\r\nby a _per capita_ charge for new Federal expenditure, as, for example,\r\nfor Old Age Pensions (see Table on p. 297).\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the tax revenue shown comes, as I have said, from\r\nCustoms and Excise, and it is unnecessary to set out the respective\r\nfigures of revenue derived from these duties.[144] It will be seen,\r\nafter deducting repayments from contributions, that even the poorest\r\nStates make a substantial net contribution to Federal purposes. On the\r\nother hand, the relative proportion of revenue contributed by Western\r\nAustralia and Tasmania is diminishing. In Western Australia it was 12-49\r\nper cent. of the whole in 1905, 8-13 per cent. of the whole in 1909. In\r\nthe same period, not only relatively, but actually, the gross\r\ncontribution of Western Australia has diminished from £1,431,624 in 1905\r\nto £1,166,126 in 1909, while the repayment to her has also diminished\r\nfrom £1,031,223 in 1905 to £627,933. Tasmania's repayment is also\r\ndiminishing, though her gross contribution has increased. These\r\ncircumstances suggest a slight resemblance to the growing disproportion\r\nbetween the resources of Ireland and Great Britain, but they do not\r\nassist us towards a solution of the Irish problem. Each Australian\r\nState, while contributing the whole of its Customs and Excise to the\r\nFederal Government, receives back at least half, and in some cases\r\ntwo-thirds,[146] and adds that sum to its own independent revenue for\r\nthe maintenance of the State Government. The sum refunded amounts on\r\nthe average to a little below a quarter of the total State revenue--to\r\nbe accurate, 23.01 per cent. Of the remaining 76.99 per cent., only 10\r\nper cent, on the average is derived from direct taxation; 10.10 per cent\r\nfrom public lands, 4.15 per cent, from miscellaneous services, and no\r\nless than 52.55 per cent, from Public Works--railways, tramways,\r\nharbours, etc.\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF, AND REPAYMENTS TO, THE STATES OF THE AUSTRALIAN\r\nCOMMONWEALTH, 1908-09.[145]\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n                        Contributions to  Repayments from\r\n                            Revenue.

To take away even a third of her\r\nreceipts from Customs and Excise would be to leave her with a deficit of\r\nthree millions and a half, which would have to be made up by additions\r\nto a direct taxation, which is already vastly higher than in any part of\r\nAustralia. She needs every penny of her revenue from whatever source\r\nderived, and there is no possibility of extracting from her a\r\ncontribution to Imperial services, unless it be an illusory contribution\r\nbased on faked figures.\r\n\r\nThe real moral to be derived from the Australian comparison is that both\r\nAustralia and Ireland are countries where accumulated wealth is\r\ncomparatively small, and where the importance of indirect taxation is\r\nvery great. All the more reason for giving Ireland control of her own\r\nindirect taxation. Canada, and, indeed, all the self-governing Colonies,\r\nsuggest the same moral. In Canada the Federal or Dominion Parliament has\r\nan unlimited power of taxation, the Provinces being vested only with the\r\nconcurrent right of direct taxation within their respective borders\r\n(B.N. America Act, Clauses 91 and 92). In practice, nearly the whole\r\nFederal tax revenue is derived from Customs and Excise. We have no\r\nmaterials for a comparison of gross and net provincial contributions,\r\nbecause no records are compiled. Under an Act of 1907, revising the\r\nformer arrangements, two small subsidies, forming a fixed charge on the\r\ngross Federal revenue, and bearing no specific proportion to the income\r\nfrom Customs and Excise, are given to each Province.\r\n\r\n1. A subsidy (from £20,000 to £40,000) based on the total provincial\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n2. A payment of 80 cents per head of the provincial population.\r\n\r\nBoth together are very small by comparison with the Australian payments.\r\nNeither is really a subsidy, though it is given that name, but the\r\nreturn of a surplus indirectly contributed. It is, indeed, conceivable\r\nthat a new and poor Province might actually contribute less than she\r\nreceived back. One Province, British Columbia, having long complained\r\nthat she contributed far more than her share, and received back too\r\nlittle, obtained an exceptional grant of £20,000 under the Act of\r\n1907.[147] The sums raised independently in each Province for the\r\nsupport of the provincial administration are, as in Australia, derived\r\nto a very slight extent from direct taxation, and to a very large extent\r\nfrom public property; not, as in Australia, from railways, tramways,\r\netc., but mainly from vast tracts of public land. In this respect the\r\nProvinces resemble the Dominion, which derives a large revenue from the\r\nsame source.\r\n\r\nIn three vital points, then, Anglo-Irish finance differs from that of\r\nthe Colonial Federations. Ireland's whole net income comes from taxes;\r\nshe needs it all; and her economic conditions are totally different from\r\nthose of Great Britain. So far from borrowing anything from Federal\r\nfinance, we should deduce from it the moral of financial independence\r\nfor Ireland. With all the powerful centripetal forces, moral and\r\nmaterial, which originally united, and now hold together, the federated\r\nStates of Australia and Canada, there is continual controversy, and\r\nsometimes considerable friction, over finance, generally in connection\r\nwith the position of the poorer Provinces or States. Some problems are\r\nstill unsolved. Good authorities, among them Sir Arthur Bourinot, think\r\nthat the Canadian subsidies are unsound. Australia is dissatisfied with\r\nher system. The American States, while giving up Customs and Excise, are\r\nself-supporting entities; but that system has its drawback, in Federal\r\nextravagance. We must remember, too, that even if these examples were of\r\nany use to us, the weak States or Provinces in a Federation have a\r\ngreater control over Federal financial policy than Ireland could have\r\nunder any scheme which reserved Customs and Excise to the Imperial\r\nParliament; because the Federal principle, partially infringed only in\r\nthe case of Canada, is to give them disproportionately high\r\nrepresentation in the Upper Federal chamber, which can reject money\r\nBills.[148]\r\n\r\nOn all counts, Ireland's position is that of a country which\r\nimperatively needs fiscal isolation similar to that enjoyed by States\r\nprior to Federation, before it can dream of embarking on the perilous\r\nsea of quasi-Federal finance. Trouble enough comes from the present\r\njoint system. We should make a clean sweep of it, permit Ireland, with a\r\nminimum of temporary assistance, to find her own financial equilibrium,\r\nand so lay the foundation, perhaps, for a genuine Federation in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE SCHEMES OF HOME RULE FINANCE[149]\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorically, these fall into two classes; though, as I shall show, they\r\nare for all intents and purposes merged in one to-day.\r\n\r\nThe two classes are--(1) The Gladstonian; (2) the \"Contract.\"\r\n\r\n1. _Mr. Gladstone's Schemes_.--It is unnecessary to examine these in\r\nclose detail, though, if the reader cares to do so, he will find details\r\nset forth in the Appendix. Four outstanding features were common to the\r\nschemes both of 1886 and 1893: (_a_) Permanent Imperial control over the\r\nimposition of Customs and Excise; (_b_) Irish control over all other\r\ntaxation; (_c_) an annual Irish contribution to Imperial expenditure;\r\n(_d_) Imperial payment of part cost of the Irish Police.\r\n\r\nWith regard to (_a_), the most important point of difference in the two\r\nBills was that under the first Ireland was credited with her whole\r\n\"collected\" revenue from Customs and Excise, under the second (as\r\namended) with only her \"true\" revenue, which was less than the former by\r\n£1,700,000. Another point in which the two Bills differed was the\r\npermission to Ireland, under the Bill of 1893, after six years, to\r\ncollect her own Excise. Both imposition and collection were wholly\r\nreserved under the Bill of 1886. I have already given grounds for the\r\nimpolicy of retaining control over Customs and Excise. Let me only ask\r\nthe reader, in conclusion, to figure the situation. How could Ireland\r\nframe a financial policy? Three-quarters of the revenue, as at present\r\nlevied, of a country profoundly dissimilar economically from Great\r\nBritain, and in need of drastic reforms of expenditure and marked\r\nchanges in taxation, would be permanently outside the reach of an Irish\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, and, in spite of the representation at\r\nWestminster which Imperial control would entail, would in the long-run\r\nfluctuate according to British needs and notions. In the long-run, I\r\nrepeat; but incidentally there would be sharp and damaging conflicts.\r\nOccasions might occur like that of 1909, when the majority of Irishmen,\r\nrightly or wrongly, resented the form of new taxation, and would have\r\nsecured the rejection of the Budget had not that step been hurtful to\r\nthe prospects of Home Rule. It will be useless to blame either Ireland\r\nor Great Britain. Every country is bound to study its own circumstances.\r\nA similar crisis would have imperilled even the strongest Federation. We\r\nare not in the least concerned at the moment with the goodness or\r\nbadness of that famous Budget. We are concerned with the effect on the\r\nrelations of the two countries, and with the indefeasible right of\r\nIreland and Great Britain to do what they consider best for their own\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nWith regard to (_b_), the Bill of 1893 differed from that of 1886 in the\r\nprovision of a suspensory period of six years, during which all existing\r\ntaxation in Ireland was to be under Imperial control, though Ireland\r\ncould impose additional taxes of her own. After six years--and, under\r\nthe Bill of 1886, from the outset--Ireland was to have control over all\r\ntaxation other than Customs and Excise. Where is the wisdom in\r\nselecting direct taxation as peculiarly suitable to Irish control? It is\r\nalready higher in Ireland than in any country economically situated as\r\nIreland is. Yet Ireland's power to reduce it will be very small and very\r\ndifficult to use, if she is rigidly excluded from changes in the\r\nindirect taxation which presses mainly on the poor. Would she naturally\r\nbe inclined to increase direct taxation? Land Value Duties produce next\r\nto nothing in Ireland, and their extension would be unpopular. The\r\nexisting rates of Income-Tax and Estate Duties cannot be raised, though\r\ntheir incidence might be extended to cover poorer elements of the\r\npopulation, as, for example, the small farmers. That is a kind of\r\nmeasure which the farmers would, if necessary, willingly agree to, in\r\norder to balance the accounts of a financially independent Ireland, but\r\nit is not the kind of measure they would care about when their national\r\nfinance was dictated by Great Britain. If one cared to make a\r\ndialectical point, one could add that a common argument against Home\r\nRule is a fear of oppressive taxation of the rich or oppressive taxation\r\nof North-East Ulster, at the hands of an Irish Parliament, through high\r\ndirect imposts. The fear is one of those which scarcely need serious\r\ndiscussion. If Irish statesmen were as black as their most industrious\r\ntraducers paint them, they could not by any ingenuity invent any new\r\ndirect tax which would not hit all the provinces equally, saving perhaps\r\na tax on pasture ranches, which would hit North-East Ulster least; while\r\nsuper-taxes on the exceptionally rich, if they were worth the trouble of\r\ncollecting, would drive wealth out of a poor country at the very moment\r\nwhen it was most urgently necessary to gain the confidence of investors\r\nand the few wealthy residents.\r\n\r\nWith regard to (c), Mr. Gladstone's various devices for obtaining from\r\nIreland a contribution to Imperial services possess now only a\r\nmelancholy and academical interest, because, without an elaborate\r\nmanipulation of the accounts, so as to disguise their true significance,\r\nno such contribution can possibly be obtained. In 1886 Mr. Gladstone\r\nprovided for an annual payment from Ireland, fixed in amount for thirty\r\nyears; in 1893 for the contribution of a _quota_--namely, one-third--of\r\nher \"true\" annual revenue from Imperial taxes, to run for six years, and\r\nthen to be revised. His calculations were conditioned to some extent by\r\n_(d),_ the part payment from the Imperial purse of the cost of Irish\r\nPolice, coupled, of course, with continued Imperial control of that\r\nPolice, pending its replacement by a new civil force. It is easy enough\r\nin ways like this to show a balance in Ireland's favour, and, at the\r\nsame time, to cripple the responsibility of the Irish Legislature by\r\ntransferring selected services from the Irish to the Imperial side of\r\nthe account. We can extend the process to Old Age Pensions, the Land\r\nCommission, and what not. As I have repeatedly urged, this course is\r\nradically unsound. As for the Police, there can be no responsible\r\ngovernment without control of the agents of law and order.\r\n\r\nBy crediting Ireland with her whole \"collected\" revenue, we can give her\r\nat once a balance of half a million. By freeing her from the payment of\r\nOld Age Pensions, we can make the balance three millions. With the\r\nelimination of the Land Commission and the Police, we can make it five\r\nmillions. Then we can postulate an imaginary taxable capacity, an ideal\r\ncontribution to Imperial services, and a hypothetical share of the\r\nNational Debt, and so arrive at a Budget which will look well on paper,\r\nbut which will deceive nobody, and be open to crushing criticism.\r\n\r\n2. \"_Contract_\" _Finance_.--It will be seen that both Mr. Gladstone's\r\nschemes set up in Ireland--though under the Bill of 1893 only after six\r\nyears--a dual system of taxation, Imperial and Irish, after the Federal\r\nmodel. The revenue, \"collected\" or \"true,\" derived from Imperial taxes\r\nlevied in Ireland, was to be paid, after the deduction of sums due to\r\nthe Imperial Government on various accounts, into the Irish Exchequer.\r\nAnd into the same Exchequer went the proceeds of taxes levied by Ireland\r\nherself. The distinguishing feature of \"Contract\" finance is that it\r\nmaintains the fiscal unity of the British Isles. All taxation in Ireland\r\nwould be permanently levied and collected, as before, by the Imperial\r\nParliament, Ireland being allowed only the barren and illusory privilege\r\nof levying new additional taxes of her own. Out of the Imperial\r\nExchequer a lump sum of fixed amount, or a sum equivalent to the revenue\r\n_collected_ in Ireland, would be handed over to Ireland, by contract, as\r\nit were, for the maintenance of the Administration.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of this scheme seems to me to be its only merit. It\r\ndisposes of all complicated bookkeeping, all heart-burnings over \"true\"\r\nand \"collected\" revenue, and all controversies, for a long time at any\r\nrate, over an Irish contribution to the Empire; while it involves and\r\nimmensely facilitates a subsidy based on the reservation of selected\r\nIrish services for Imperial management and payment. On the other hand,\r\nit is not Home Rule. It annihilates the responsibility of Ireland for\r\nher own fortunes, and is, indeed, altogether incompatible with what we\r\nknow as responsible government. Its germ appeared in the Irish Council\r\nBill of 1907--a Bill which did not pretend to set up anything\r\napproaching responsible government, and to which the scheme was\r\ntherefore in a sense appropriate, though it must, I think, have produced\r\nmischievous results if it had been carried into law.[150]\r\n\r\nI wish to speak with the utmost respect of Lord MacDonnell and the other\r\npatriotic Irishmen who have advocated this kind of financial solution.\r\nThere was a time when it might have been good policy for Ireland to\r\nobtain any--even the smallest--financial powers of her own as a lever,\r\nthough a very bad lever, for the attainment of more. But we ought now to\r\nmake a sound and final settlement, and I do earnestly urge upon all\r\nthose who have Irish interests at heart to reject schemes which merely\r\nevade, if they do not actually aggravate, some of the pressing\r\ndifficulties of the Irish problem of to-day. The fact that Contract\r\nfinance works well in India is _prima facie_ a reason why it should not\r\nwork well in Ireland. It does not exist, and it could not be made to\r\nshow good results, in any community of white men. If anyone is disposed\r\nto trace a faint analogy--which in any case would be a false\r\nanalogy--with the lesser of the two small subsidies given by the\r\nDominion of Canada in aid of the Provincial administrations,[151] let\r\nhim imagine what the moral and practical consequences would be if,\r\ninstead of constituting a small fraction of the provincial income, this\r\nsubsidy were increased to a lump sum calculated by the Dominion\r\nGovernment as correct and sufficient for the whole internal government\r\nof the Province. And the pernicious results in a Canadian Province would\r\nbe trivial beside the pernicious results in Ireland, where the whole\r\nsystem of expenditure and revenue needs to be recast; where large\r\neconomies are needed, together with additional outlay on education; and\r\nwhere above all, the sense of national responsibility, deliberately\r\nstifled for centuries, needs to be evoked. Nothing could be more cruel\r\nto Ireland than to give her a fictitious financial freedom, and then to\r\ncomplain that she did not use it well. No nation could use freedom well\r\nunder the Contract system of finance, whether based on a fixed grant or\r\non revenue derived from Ireland. It is not in human nature to reduce\r\nexpenditure unless the reduction is reflected in reduced taxation. Every\r\nofficial threatened with retrenchment, even in the services under Irish\r\ncontrol and, _a fortiori,_ in the services outside Irish control, would\r\nhave a grievance in which the public would sympathize, while resentment\r\nat an unequal fiscal union would be unabated. Irish statesmen, like any\r\nother men in the same position, would be exposed unfairly to the\r\ncontinual temptation of preserving institutions and payments as they\r\nwere, of making changes only of personnel, and of annually appealing to\r\nGreat Britain for more money for new expenditure. These appeals could\r\nnot possibly be refused. If Great Britain chooses to place Ireland in a\r\nposition of financial dependence, she must take the consequences and pay\r\nthe bill, as in the past, even if the bill exceeds the revenue derived\r\nfrom Ireland. But, indeed, under Contract finance, attempts to make\r\nIrish expenditure conform to Irish revenue would necessarily be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nBad as the results must be, we are inexorably driven to some form of\r\nContract finance directly we relinquish its anti-type, financial\r\nindependence. There is very little practical difference between the\r\nGladstonian and later plans. We may be drawn along the downward path\r\neither by considerations of revenue, or considerations of expenditure,\r\nor by both combined. To retain Imperial control of Customs and Excise,\r\nwhile crediting the Irish proceeds to Ireland, is in itself equivalent\r\nto making three-quarters of Irish tax revenue take the form of an annual\r\nmoney grant fixed by Great Britain. If Englishmen also want to retain\r\ncontrol over Irish Police, and Irishmen are short-sighted enough to\r\ndesire Imperial control, as a corollary of Imperial payment, of Old Age\r\nPensions, National Insurance, or Land Purchase, there at once are four\r\nmillions, or more than a third of present Irish expenditure, withheld\r\nfrom Irish authority. To cover the remaining seven millions by a\r\nContract allowance, instead of going through the pretence of allotting\r\nitems of revenue and of deducting a contribution to Imperial services,\r\nis a step which is only too likely to commend itself to harassed\r\nstatesmen. But it would not be Home Rule.\r\n\r\nThis is not a matter of speculation, but of experience. As long ago as\r\n1818, in the case of Canada, we discarded as vicious the old doctrine\r\nthat a dependency ought not to be allowed to provide for the whole cost\r\nof government out of its own taxes, for fear that its Legislature would\r\ncontrol policy. If we are going to remove features which make Ireland\r\nresemble a Crown Colony now, do not let us import others which recall\r\nthe ancient fallacies of a century ago.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be considered the important question of loans, and to\r\nthat I shall devote a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] Hansard, July 21 and 25, 1893.\r\n\r\n[137] Both Bills provided for part payment of the cost of Irish Police\r\nfrom Imperial funds.\r\n\r\n[138] Return No. 220.\r\n\r\n[139] See p. 234.\r\n\r\n[140] See p. 234.\r\n\r\n[141] I need scarcely point out that the newly-created Provinces of the\r\nDominion of Canada are exceptions to this rule.

LAND PURCHASE LOANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data of the land problem are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe superficial area of Ireland is 20,350,725 acres, and in 1909 it was\r\nutilized as follows:[153]\r\n\r\n                                         Acres.    Percentage.\r\n\r\nArea under tillage, hay and fruit        4,582,697     22.5\r\nArea under pasture                       9,997,445\r\n                                                       61.6\r\nGrazed mountain land                     2,548,569\r\nWoods, etc.                                301,444      1.5\r\n\r\nBog, barren mountain, water,\r\n  roads, townlands, etc.                 2,925,570     14.4\r\n\r\nTotal                                   20,350,725    100.0\r\n\r\nThe agricultural area, calculated by the exclusion of the last item in\r\nthe above column, works out at 17,425,155 acres, but since bog forms\r\npart of a large number of farms, we may, for the purposes of Land\r\nPurchase, place the agricultural area of Ireland at 18,739,644 acres,\r\nthe figure given in the Census of 1901, and its annual value for rating\r\npurposes, as given in the same census, at £10,061,667.\r\n\r\nThis area is divided into 603,827 agricultural holdings, which are in\r\nthe hands of 554,060 occupiers, and vary in size from vast pasture\r\nranches to the tiny plots of miserable rock-sown soil, which abound in\r\nthe congested districts of the west.\r\n\r\nBut small holdings largely predominate. More than two-thirds do not\r\nexceed 30 acres; 153,565 are between 5 and 15 acres, and 147,580 are\r\nbelow 5 acres.\r\n\r\nSize, however, is by itself an imperfect index to value. The effects of\r\nthe ancient confiscations and of the extraordinarily unequal\r\ndistribution of land which they and the bad Irish agrarian system\r\nproduced may be gauged by the valuation figures of the Census of 1901,\r\nwhich showed that 335,491, or 68.5 per cent, of the total number of\r\nholdings had an annual value (for rating purposes) not exceeding £15,\r\nwhile they covered only a little more than a third of the total\r\nagricultural area; 134,182 of these holdings were rated below £4, and\r\ncovered only 1,360,000 acres.\r\n\r\nAll farms rated below £4, and a large number of those below £15, may be\r\nregarded as \"uneconomic\"--that is, incapable by themselves of supplying\r\na decent living to the farmer and his family.\r\n\r\nI shall say no more here about the legislation beginning forty years\r\nago, which revolutionized the agrarian tenure derived directly from the\r\nPenal Code, and converted the Irish tenant into a \"judicial\" tenant with\r\na rent fixed by the Land Commission, with security of tenure, and free\r\nsale of the tenant-right.[154] There are now in Ireland two distinct\r\nclasses of occupying tenants, \"judicial\" tenants, and purchasing\r\ntenants, and it is upon the question of the State-aided transference of\r\nthe land from the landlord to the tenant that I wish to concentrate the\r\nreader's attention.\r\n\r\nThe principle of Land Purchase is this: The State advances money, raised\r\nby a public loan, to the tenant, who pays off the landlord with it, and\r\nbecomes for a fixed period the tenant of the State. During this period\r\nhe pays, in lieu of rent, an annuity, which represents both interest and\r\nsinking-fund on the capital sum advanced to him. At the end of the\r\nperiod, which, of course, will vary with the fixed annual amount of the\r\nsinking-fund, he becomes owner in fee-simple of his farm.\r\n\r\nThere is no charity to the tenant. He borrows the money and pays it back\r\nin a perfectly regular way, and the State has made a temporary\r\ninvestment of a profitable character.\r\n\r\nAnd now, for the last time, I must trouble the reader with a little\r\nindispensable history. There are four phases in the history of Irish\r\nLand Purchase.\r\n\r\n1. John Bright was the first British statesman to maintain that no\r\nhealthy and lasting readjustment of the relations between landlord and\r\ntenant in Ireland could ever be made by law. He advocated State-aided\r\npurchase; and in the Church Disestablishment Act of 1869 and the Land\r\nActs of 1870 and 1881, clauses were inserted allowing the State to\r\nadvance money for Land Purchase. The conditions, however, were so\r\nonerous, both to landlord and tenant, that only 7,665 tenants out of\r\nmore than half a million were able to avail themselves of these purchase\r\nclauses.\r\n\r\n2. The Ashbourne Act of 1885 was the first successful measure of the\r\nkind. Five millions were advanced under it, and five millions more under\r\nan extending Act of 1887. Next came the Act of 1891, empowering the loan\r\nof thirty-three millions, followed by the amending and simplifying Act\r\nof 1896. These Acts form a body of legislation by themselves, of which I\r\nneed refer only to a few salient characteristics. They were all alike in\r\nsettling the tenant's annuity (in lieu of rent) at 4 per cent, on the\r\npurchase money, though the proportions allocated to interest and\r\nsinking-fund varied. Under the first two Acts the period for final\r\nredemption of his loan by the tenant was forty-nine years, under the\r\nthird forty-two years, though this period was extended to seventy years\r\nif the tenant availed himself of decadal reductions in the annuity,\r\nproportionate to the capital paid off by the sinking-fund.\r\n\r\nThe average price of the holdings sold under these Acts represented\r\nseventeen and a half years' purchase, and the tenant's great inducement\r\nto buy was that, by the aid of cheap State credit, the annuity he paid,\r\neven over so short a period as forty-nine years, represented a reduction\r\nof more than 20 per cent, on his existing judicial rent.\r\n\r\nUnder the first Act, that of 1885, the landlord received the purchase\r\nmoney in cash, under the other two, in guaranteed 3 per cent, or 2| per\r\ncent, stock, an arrangement which suited him very well as long as\r\nGovernment stocks maintained the high level which they reached in the\r\nperiod preceding the South African War. With the heavy fall in stocks\r\nduring and after the war, purchase came to a standstill. The net result\r\nof the operations under the Acts of 1885 to 1896 was that close upon\r\ntwenty-four million pounds were advanced to 72,000 tenants, occupying\r\nabout two and a half million acres, out of the total of 18,739,644\r\nacres which constitute the agricultural area of Ireland.\r\n\r\n3. Once begun, purchase had to be continued, if for no other reason than\r\nthat a purchasing tenant paid in annuity a substantially lower sum than\r\nthe non-purchasing judicial tenant paid in rent, with the additional, if\r\ndistant, prospect of an absolute fee-simple in the future.\r\n\r\nMr. Wyndham, acting on the recommendation of a friendly Conference\r\nbetween landlords and tenants, took the bull by the horns in 1903, and\r\ncarried the great Land Act of that year. Under the Wyndham Act the\r\nsystem of cash payment to the landlord, dropped since 1891, was resumed,\r\non a basis calculated to give a selling landlord a sum which, invested\r\nin gilt-edged 3 or 31/4 per cent. stocks, would yield him as much as the\r\nsecond term judicial rents on the holdings sold, less 10 per cent.,\r\nrepresenting his former cost of collection; while the annuity payable by\r\nthe tenant in lieu of rent was reduced from 4 to 31/4 per cent., of which\r\n21/2 per cent, was interest on the purchase money advanced, and 1/2 per\r\ncent, was sinking-fund. This reduction involved an extension of the\r\nperiod of redemption from forty-nine to sixty-eight and a half years.\r\nThe annuity was calculated to represent an average reduction of from 15\r\nto 25 per cent, on second-term judicial rents. Since the gross income of\r\nthe landlord was to be reduced only by 10 per cent. on a basis of 3 per\r\ncent. investments, while the annual payment by the tenant was to be\r\nreduced by an average of 20 per cent., clearly there was a gap to be\r\nfilled up, and this gap was filled by a State bonus to the selling\r\nlandlord of 12 per cent, on the purchase money, a bonus which went\r\nwholly to him personally, clear of all reversionary rights under\r\nsettlements. A sum of twelve millions altogether was to be expended on\r\nthe bonus.\r\n\r\nIn addition to direct sales between landlord and tenant through the\r\nEstates Commissioners, large powers were also given both to the Land\r\nCommission and the Congested Districts Board for the purchase and resale\r\nof certain classes of estates--land in congested districts, untenanted\r\nland, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Act was enormously popular. The landlord, in view of the manifold\r\ninsecurities of land tenure in Ireland, made an excellent bargain, and\r\nthe tenant, tempted by the immediate transformation of his rent into an\r\nannuity of reduced amount, ignored the extension by twenty years of the\r\nperiod of redemption, and was willing to agree at high prices for the\r\npurchase of his land. The average price of land sold rose from the\r\nseventeen and a half years' purchase under the old Acts to over twenty\r\nyears' purchase, and the soil of Ireland rapidly began to change hands.\r\nBut the Act broke down on finance, as adapted to what were then\r\nestimated as the requirements of the purchase operation. The estimate\r\nfor the total sum required was one hundred millions, and the purchase\r\nmoney was to be raised by successive issues of 2-3/4 per cent.\r\nGuaranteed Land Stock. Sums needed from time to time for payment of the\r\nlandlord's bonus were also raised by stock, and were placed to an\r\naccount known as the Land Purchase Aid Fund.\r\n\r\nNow, any loss on flotation, due to stock being issued at a discount, was\r\nto be borne, in the first instance, by the Ireland Development\r\nGrant,[155] and, if and when that was exhausted, by the ratepayers of\r\nIreland through deduction from the grants in aid of Local Taxation.[156]\r\nThe stock, like all Government stocks at that period, fell heavily from\r\nthe first, and in 1908 the point was reached when further issues would\r\nhave entailed a heavy loss payable out of Irish rates, growing\r\nultimately, as it was calculated, to an annual charge of more than half\r\na million. The infliction of such a burden upon the ratepayers of\r\nIreland was felt to be inequitable. Ireland was not responsible for the\r\nevils which necessitated purchase, and even if she were, the ratepayers\r\nwere not the right persons to be mulcted. Meanwhile, purchase was at a\r\ncomplete standstill.\r\n\r\n4. This serious situation led to Mr. Birrell's Land Act of 1909, which\r\nwas based upon the Report of a Treasury Committee which sat in the\r\nprevious year.[157] The problem was twofold: (a) how to deal with future\r\nagreements to purchase, between landlord and tenant;(6) how to deal with\r\nagreements to purchase pending under the Act of 1903, but as yet\r\nuncompleted.\r\n\r\n(a) With regard to future agreements, there are four main points:(1) The\r\nold policy of payment in stock, instead of in cash, is reverted to, and\r\nthe stock is a 3 per cent. stock.\r\n\r\n(2) The tenant's annuity is raised from 31/4 to 31/2 per cent.\r\n\r\n(3) The period of redemption is reduced from sixty-eight and a half\r\nyears to sixty-five and a half years. (4) The landlord's bonus is\r\nallocated on a graduated scale, under which the higher the price the\r\nland is sold at, the less is the bonus conferred. These changes, though\r\nno doubt somewhat prejudicial to the prospects of Land Purchase, were\r\nabsolutely necessary, owing to a cause beyond human control--the\r\ncondition of the money-market.\r\n\r\n(b) In regard to pending purchase agreements arrived at under the old\r\nAct, no alteration is made in the terms of the bargains already\r\nconcluded between landlord and tenant; but changes are made in the\r\nmethod of financing these agreed sales. Briefly, parties can obtain\r\npriority in treatment among the enormous mass of cases awaiting the\r\ndecision of the Land Commission by agreeing to accept 2-3/4 per cent.\r\nstock at a price not lower than 92 per cent, (which means, at present\r\nprices, that the loss on flotation is split between the landlord and the\r\nState), or, by waiting their turn, they can obtain half the price in\r\nstock at 92, and half in cash. Payments elected to be made wholly in\r\ncash come last of all. Bonus to be paid in cash as before.\r\n\r\nLosses caused by the flotation of stock at a discount no longer fall\r\nupon the Irish rates. Any loss not capable of being borne by the Ireland\r\nDevelopment Grant is to be borne by the Imperial Exchequer.\r\n\r\nOther important clauses gave compulsory powers of purchase to the\r\nCongested Districts Board, and, in the case of \"congested estates\" and\r\nuntenanted land outside the jurisdiction of the Board, to the Estates\r\nCommissioners. Otherwise Purchase and Sale remained voluntary.\r\n\r\nSo much for the history of Land Purchase. How exactly do we stand at the\r\npresent moment?\r\n\r\nIn round numbers, nearly 24 millions have actually been advanced under\r\nthe old Acts prior to 1903, and up to March of this year (1911) a\r\nfurther sum of 421/4 millions had actually been advanced under the Wyndham\r\nAct of 1903 and the Birrell Act of 1909.[158]\r\n\r\nThat makes a total of 661/2 millions actually advanced to 165,133 tenants\r\nup to March of 1911, covering the purchase of nearly 6 million acres of\r\nland, or nearly a third of the total agricultural area of Ireland. The\r\ntenants of the land are now quasi-freeholders, and will eventually be\r\ncomplete freeholders. In addition, agreements for the purchase of\r\nproperties by 150,490 tenants, under the Wyndham and Birrell Acts, at a\r\ntotal price of 461/2 millions, for 41/2 million acres, were pending in\r\nMarch, 1911, though the sale and vesting were not yet completed. The\r\nproperties represented by these agreements will be duly transferred in\r\nthe course of the next few years, though the congestion of business is\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nThat will make a total of 113 millions advanced to 315,623 tenants for\r\nthe purchase of 11 million acres under all Acts up to and including that\r\nof 1909. Now, how much more will be required? We have only one recent\r\nofficial estimate--that made by the Land Commission in 1908 for the\r\nTreasury Committee which sat to consider the crisis in Land Purchase. It\r\ndid not pretend to give an accurate forecast, but only to estimate the\r\nmaximum amount which would be needed, on the assumption that all unsold\r\nland would eventually be sold at the average price reached under the Act\r\nof 1903.[159] It is certain that the amount so calculated, covering as\r\nit does all classes and descriptions of agricultural land, and including\r\nland farmed by the landlord himself, as well as short-term pasture\r\ntenancies,[160] will considerably exceed the actual requirements. Some\r\nof the unsold land, especially of the pasture land, will never need to\r\nbe sold; nor is the average purchase price likely to remain permanently\r\nas high as that obtained under the Act of 1903.\r\n\r\nStill, this speculative estimate gives us an outside figure which is\r\nuseful. The conclusion from it is that 95 millions may be required to\r\nfinance all future sales initiated under the Act of 1909.\r\n\r\nBut if we want to know how much cash may be wanted, dating from March,\r\n1911, onwards, to finance Land Purchase, we must add the 461/2 millions\r\nneeded for sales now agreed upon, and waiting to be carried through, but\r\nnot yet completed. That brings the total to 1411/2 millions.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, I think we might very well strike off 20\r\nfrom the 95 millions of future sales, and so reduce the total to 1211/2\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nTwo further questions remain to be considered: (1) Can we assume that in\r\nthe future purchase will proceed smoothly? (2) Who pays for the\r\nmachinery of Land Purchase, and what is the security for the money\r\nadvanced?\r\n\r\n1. The Act of 1909 is still young. At the end of March, 1911,\r\napplications had been lodged for the direct sale of 5,477 holdings at a\r\nprice of £1,623,526, representing an average of 20-8 years' purchase,\r\nand negotiations were in progress for the purchase by the Congested\r\nDistricts Board of estates worth another 11/2 millions. Total, a little\r\nover 3 millions--a substantial amount of business in view of the\r\nartificial acceleration caused by events in 1907 and 1908, the\r\nsubsequent reaction, and the enormous arrears of business still\r\nremaining to be cleared up.\r\n\r\nWe should naturally expect a slight check to purchase under the Act of\r\n1909, since the inducement both to landlord and tenant is less. The\r\ntenant would be inclined to hold out for a lower price because his\r\nannuity is higher (though signs of this check are not yet apparent), and\r\nthe landlord is paid in a stock whose market price seems to be slowly\r\nbut steadily falling. It is now (November, 1911) at 861/4. On the other\r\nhand, the wise change in the allocation of the bonus places a\r\nmuch-needed premium on sales of poor land at low prices, and reverses\r\nthe process by which a wealthy landlord of good land sometimes obtained\r\nthe largest reward for submission to sale.[161] Moreover, there is\r\nconstant pressure towards purchase owing to the better financial\r\nposition of the purchasing tenant over the non-purchasing or judicial\r\ntenant, while the fear in the landlord's mind of further periodical\r\nreductions in the judicial rents tends to induce him to meet this\r\npressure halfway.\r\n\r\nStill, there is a point beyond which such pressure might not be strong\r\nenough to carry on voluntary Purchase, especially if the 3 per cent,\r\nstock continued to fall. Wide powers of compulsion,[162] covering\r\nconsiderably more than a third of Ireland, and including the poorest\r\nareas, where purchase is most needed, already exist under the Act of\r\n1909. Some think that general compulsion will be needed. Other\r\nwell-informed men count with confidence on completing all the necessary\r\npart of the purchase of Irish land in from twelve to fifteen years under\r\nthe existing system. On the other hand, it is necessary to contemplate\r\nthe possible need for universal compulsion.\r\n\r\n2. Cost of the working of Land Purchase, and security for the money\r\nadvanced. It is just as well to make these points perfectly clear, in\r\nview of the legends which obtain circulation about the \"giving\" of\r\nBritish money for the purchase of Irish land.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Land Purchase machinery falls at present on the\r\ntaxpayers of the whole United Kingdom, including, of course, those of\r\nIreland. It amounted in 1909-10, as I showed in the last chapter, to\r\n£414,500, and for 1911 the estimate is £544,395. This sum includes the\r\nadministrative cost of the Land Commission and Estates Commissioners,\r\nthe temporary losses on flotation caused in financing, under the Act of\r\n1909, the balance of agreements made under the Act of 1903, and the\r\nbonus to landlords.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury, in their returns estimating the revenue and expenditure of\r\nvarious parts of the United Kingdom, debit the whole of this sum against\r\nIreland, and, moral responsibility apart, I regard it as necessary that,\r\nunder Home Rule, Ireland should assume both the cost and the management\r\nof Purchase.\r\n\r\nApart from the annual vote I have mentioned, Land Purchase pays for\r\nitself. The security for the individual holders of the Guaranteed Land\r\nStock by means of which the purchase money is raised is the Consolidated\r\nFund of the United Kingdom, but the Consolidated Fund has never been\r\ncalled upon for a penny, either for interest or capital, and never will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nAt present the initial security of the Government which controls the\r\nConsolidated Fund--in other words, the initial security of the United\r\nKingdom taxpayers--is the Irish rates; for the grants in aid of Irish\r\nlocal taxation still form a guarantee fund chargeable with the unpaid\r\nannuities of defaulting tenants, though they have escaped the liability\r\nfor losses on the notation of stock at a discount. The ultimate security\r\nis the purchased land itself; for, in the last resort, a defaulting\r\ntenant who, it must be remembered, is a State tenant, can be sold up.\r\nBut the really important security is the tenant himself. The Irish\r\ntenants, treated properly, pay their debts as honestly and punctually as\r\nany other class of men in the world. Annuities in arrear are negligible.\r\nThe last Report of the Land Commission shows that out of two million\r\npounds of annuities due from 165,133 purchasing tenants, and close upon\r\nanother two millions of interest (in lieu of rent) upon holdings agreed\r\nto be purchased by 150,490 tenants--a total of nearly four million\r\npounds--only £28,084 were uncollected on March 31 last. The cases of\r\nhopeless default, leading to a sale of the land, were only fifty-four.\r\nNot a penny has actually been lost.\r\n\r\nThe State, then, or, if we choose so to put it, the United Kingdom\r\ntaxpayers, are safe from loss, and make a good investment. There has\r\nnever been the faintest symptom of a strike against annuities, and the\r\nonly cause which could conceivably ever suggest such a strike would be\r\nthe irritation provoked by a persistent refusal to grant Home Rule. Even\r\nthat possibility I regard as out of the question, because there is a\r\nsanctity attaching to annuities which it would be hard to impair. Still,\r\nto speak broadly, it is true that Home Rule will improve a security\r\nalready good, and that Home Rule, with financial independence, will make\r\nit absolutely impregnable.\r\n\r\nLet me sum up.\r\n\r\nMore than half the agricultural land of Ireland is sold to the tenants,\r\nor agreed to be sold. Eleven million acres out of 183/4 million acres have\r\nchanged hands, or will soon change hands; 315,623 out of 554,060\r\noccupiers now pay annuities or interest in lieu of rent, to the amount\r\nof nearly 4 million pounds. In regard to value, out of a total value of\r\n208 millions for the whole agricultural land of Ireland, 661/2 millions\r\nhave actually been advanced for purchase, 461/2 millions are due to be\r\nadvanced under signed agreements; and, on the extreme estimate of the\r\nLand Commission, based on the supposition that all the remaining land\r\nwill ultimately be sold, 95 millions more will have to be advanced.\r\nTotal future liability on the extreme estimate, 1411/2 millions; or, if we\r\ntake the more moderate and reasonable figure I suggested, 1211/2 millions.\r\n\r\nNow, two conditions must be laid down--\r\n\r\n     1. Purchase ought to continue.\r\n\r\n     2. Cheap Imperial credit is necessary for it.\r\n\r\nThese conditions ought not to entail, beyond a strictly limited point,\r\nthe continued control of Purchase by the Imperial Government. That step,\r\nas I suggested at p. 221, might involve Imperial control over (1) the\r\nCongested Districts Board; (2) the whole work of the Land Commission,\r\noutside Purchase, and all Irish land legislation; (3) the Irish police;\r\nbecause the power of distraint for annuities, the last resource of the\r\ncreditor Government, rests, of course, with the arm of the law.\r\n\r\nAny one of these consequences, as I have urged, would be inconsistent\r\nwith responsible government in Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhat are the objections to Irish control over Purchase, with its\r\ncorollary, Irish payment of the running costs of Purchase? Two distinct\r\ninterests have to be considered: (1) That of the British taxpayer; (2)\r\nthat of the landlord.\r\n\r\n1. If we carry out the plan I have advocated, the British taxpayer, as\r\nsoon as he ceases to contribute to the diminishing subsidy suggested at\r\np. 284 in order to meet the initial deficit in the national Irish\r\nbalance-sheet, will cease to contribute anything towards the running\r\ncosts, landlord's bonus, and flotation losses of a Purchase operation\r\nfor the necessity of which Great Britain, in the past, was in reality\r\nresponsible. Great Britain is under a moral obligation to continue to\r\nsupport Land Purchase with her national credit, which is indispensable.\r\nShe is also entitled to demand whatever reasonable conditions she thinks\r\nfit, for example, a share in the nomination of Land and Estates\r\nCommissioners; while any new legislation will, in the ordinary course,\r\nneed her assent. The security, as I said above, will be impregnable. The\r\npurchasing tenant would become the tenant of the Irish State. The Irish\r\nGovernment, as a whole, instead of the individual annuitants, would, of\r\ncourse, be responsible to the Imperial Government, would collect the\r\nannuities itself, and bear any contingent loss by their non-payment. To\r\nrepudiate a public obligation of that sort would be as ruinous to\r\nIreland as the repudiation of a public debt is to any State in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the Irish Government would find it good policy to\r\npopularize Irish Land Stock in Ireland. At present prices the 3 per\r\ncent, stock is among the cheapest and safest in the world, and would\r\nreturn to the farmer thrice as much interest as the average bank deposit\r\nwhich he now favours.\r\n\r\nMercifully, there is no exact historical precedent for such a case as\r\nIreland, though, on a small scale, Prince Edward Island is an\r\ninstructive parallel.[163] But if precedents, in the shape of guaranteed\r\nloans to self-governing Colonies, are needed, they exist. The most\r\nrelevant and recent is the Imperial guaranteed loan of 35 millions made\r\nto the Transvaal by Mr. Balfour's Government in 1903 after the great\r\nwar. Why it should be a heresy to do for Ireland what we did for the\r\nTransvaal, I am at a loss to conceive. The loan became, of course, an\r\nobligation of the Colony when it received Home Rule, and in 1907 a\r\nfurther guaranteed loan of 5 millions was authorized, of which 4\r\nmillions has been issued. Like Irish Land Stock, these loans are secured\r\non the Consolidated Fund; but I do not think a fear is now suggested\r\nthat the Consolidated Fund is in danger on that account. Prophecies of\r\nthat sort were common enough in the mouths of those who opposed\r\nTransvaal Home Rule, but they did not long survive its enactment.\r\n\r\nAnother precedent is a guaranteed railway loan to Canada in 1873 of\r\n£3,600,000, which is just now becoming redeemable, while the Crown\r\nColony of Mauritius received a guaranteed loan of £600,000 in 1892. The\r\nBritish and Irish taxpayers have also made themselves responsible for\r\n£9,424,000 on account of Egypt; £6,023,700 on account of Greece; and\r\n£5,000,000 on account of Turkey. The total nominal amount of the\r\nguaranteed loans to countries, colonial or foreign, outside the United\r\nKingdom is £63,647,700. The total amount outstanding on March 31, 1911,\r\nwas £59,474,200, and the Government holds securities only to the value\r\nof £4,800,556 against these liabilities, leaving the net liability of\r\nthe taxpayer at £54,673,644.\r\n\r\nThe net liability of the taxpayer at the same date on account of Irish\r\nGuaranteed Land Stocks of all descriptions was £65,764,054.[164] Ireland\r\nhas a claim to Imperial credit far superior to any of the Colonies,\r\ndependencies, or foreign Powers mentioned, and the credit should not\r\nentail control, or the representation of Ireland at Westminster.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it goes without saying that Ireland, in common with the\r\nColonies, should receive the very valuable privilege of having\r\nindependent loans raised by herself inscribed at the Bank of England,\r\nand made trustee securities.\r\n\r\n2. It may be argued that the Congested Districts Board and the Land\r\nCommission, and through them Irish statesmen, may be subjected to local\r\npressure hostile to the landlord's interests, and that the Irish\r\nGovernment would feel itself more free for social and other reforms if\r\nthe land question were placed legally outside their purview. My answer\r\nis, in the first place, that Great Britain would cease to lend if her\r\nconditions were unfulfilled; in the second place, that in this, as in\r\nall matters, we are bound to place faith in the self-respect and sense\r\nof justice of a free Ireland--in its common prudence, too; for it would\r\nbe a disaster whose magnitude is universally recognized in Ireland if\r\nany course were to be taken which prevented the landlord class from\r\njoining in the great work of making a new Ireland. Fair treatment of the\r\nlandlords by a free Ireland, as distinguished from fair treatment at the\r\nhands of an external authority, would do more than anything else to\r\nbring about a reconciliation. That is human nature all the world over.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MINOR LOANS TO IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains only to refer briefly to two other cases where Ireland\r\nbenefits from Imperial credit.\r\n\r\n(1) The Labourers (Ireland) Act of 1906 sanctioned the advance of money\r\nthrough the Land Commission to Rural Councils for building labourers'\r\ncottages--a class of loans previously made by the Public Works\r\nCommissioners of Ireland. £3,111,816 had been advanced under this head\r\non March 31, 1911, and £1,138,184 had been applied for. The money is\r\nraised by guaranteed 23/4 per cent, stock in the same way as the money for\r\nLand Purchase.\r\n\r\n(2) In addition, there are the loans granted by the Irish Commissioners\r\nof Public Works. In their capacity as lenders, which is only one of a\r\nmultitude of capacities, the Commissioners are really a subordinate\r\nbranch of the Treasury, and fulfil the same function as the Public Works\r\nLoans Commissioners in Great Britain. They lend principally to local\r\nauthorities for all manner of public works and public health\r\nrequirements, also to private individuals, mainly for the improvement of\r\nland, and, to a small extent, to Arterial Drainage Boards and to\r\nrailways. They get their money from the National Debt Commissioners, and\r\nin 1909-10 issued loans to the amount of £293,233--a figure which shows\r\na considerable reduction on that of the previous two years.[165] The\r\ntotal amount of 35,000 outstanding loans on March 31, 1910, was\r\n£9,608,110, of which between two-thirds and three-quarters were due from\r\nlocal authorities. The interest varies, as in Great Britain, from 23/4 to\r\n5 per cent., according to the nature of the security, and in 1909-10\r\naveraged £3 10s. 6d. Most of the loans are secured on local rates, where\r\nthe interest payable is either 31/2 or 33/4 per cent., according to the\r\nperiod of the loan; others on undertakings such as harbours; and others\r\non the land for the improvement of which the money is borrowed.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are two small and secondary problems. Under Home Rule\r\nIreland will have no claim to further Imperial credit for loans of\r\neither of the above classes. On the other hand, there is no reason why\r\nthe Treasury, if it pleases, and on its own terms, should not lend as\r\nbefore, though not directly, as it virtually does now, but indirectly,\r\nby loan to the Irish Government. The security will be just as good, and\r\nprobably better. If a negligent Local Government Board under Irish\r\ncontrol sanctions reckless loans by local authorities, and a negligent\r\nIrish Government advances for such loans money borrowed from Great\r\nBritain, the Irish Treasury will suffer. Such eventualities need not\r\nseriously be considered. The analogy with the Transvaal and Canada\r\nloans, which were mainly for public works, is very close.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[152] Parts of this chapter have appeared in a paper by the Author in\r\n\"Home Rule Problems.\"\r\n\r\n[153] Agricultural Statistics of Ireland, 1909.\r\n\r\n[154] See pp. 10-17, 66-71.\r\n\r\n[155] See p. 270-271.\r\n\r\n[156] See p. 267.\r\n\r\n[157] Cd. 4005, 1908.\r\n\r\n[158] This and subsequent figures are taken from an answer to question\r\nin the House of Commons, July 25, 1911, and from the current Exports of\r\nthe Land Commission and Estates Commissioners.\r\n\r\n[159] Cd. 4412, 1908. The basis taken was the Poor Law valuation of the\r\nlands unsold, multiplied by the number of years purchase of the lands\r\nsold under the Act of 1903. On this basis the value of the land neither\r\nsold nor agreed to be sold in 1908 was £103,931,848. On the basis of\r\nacreage, the estimate worked out at £102,078,448, and on the basis of\r\nholdings (regarded as unreliable by the Commissioners) at £92,660,694.\r\nThe total sum required from first to last, including sums already\r\nadvanced under all the various Acts, was £208,366,175.\r\n\r\n[160] Pasture land let on eleven months' tenancies (a common form of\r\ntenure) counts as untenanted land, and is subject to purchase by the\r\nLand Commissioners, compulsorily, if necessary.\r\n\r\n[161] But not always. Heavily mortgaged landlords profited most,\r\nperhaps, under the Act of 1903.\r\n\r\n[162] Only once exercised up to October, 1911: over Lord Inchiquin's\r\nestate in Clare, to be acquired for the relief of congestion.\r\n\r\n[163] See p. 75.

The exclusion or\r\nretention of Irish Members at Westminster, and the powers--above all,\r\nthe financial powers--of the Irish State, are the two points of cardinal\r\nimportance. As I have shown, they are inseparably connected, and form,\r\nin reality, one great question.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to prove that from whatever angle we approach that\r\ncentral issue, whether we argue from representation to powers, or from\r\npowers to representation, and whether the particular powers we argue\r\nfrom be financial, legislative, or executive; whether we place Irish,\r\nBritish, or Imperial interests in the forefront of our exposition--we\r\nare led irresistibly to the colonial solution--that is, to the cessation\r\nof Irish representation at Westminster, coupled with a concession to\r\nIreland of the full legislative and executive authority appropriate to\r\nthat measure of independence, and, above all, with fiscal autonomy.\r\n\r\nAll the other provisions of the Bill are secondary. They may be divided\r\ninto two categories, which necessarily overlap:\r\n\r\n1. Provisions concerning Ireland only.\r\n\r\n2. Provisions defining the Imperial authority over Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the Irish Legislature, the position of the Irish\r\nJudiciary, the safeguards for minorities, the provision made for\r\nexisting servants of the State, the statutory arrangements, if any, for\r\nthe future reorganization of the Irish Police--these and other questions\r\nare of great intrinsic importance, and need the most careful discussion;\r\nbut they are altogether subordinate to those we have already considered.\r\nIf it be over-sanguine to hope, in Ireland's interest, that they will be\r\ndiscussed in a calm and dispassionate way, we can at least demand that\r\nthose provisions belonging to the second category, which present no\r\nappreciable difficulty, will not excite bitter and barren disputes like\r\nthose of 1893.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this volume to discuss exhaustively the\r\nsecondary provisions of the Bill, or to suggest the exact statutory form\r\nwhich those provisions, major or minor, should take. In this chapter I\r\nshall deal briefly with matters which I have hitherto left aside, and\r\nincidentally give more precision to the points upon which I have already\r\nsuggested a conclusion, in both cases indicating, so far as possible,\r\nthe most useful precedents and parallels from other Constitutions. The\r\nresult will be the rough sketch of a Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREAMBLE.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas it is expedient that _without impairing or restricting the\r\nsupreme authority of Parliament_, an Irish Legislature should be\r\ncreated, etc.\" So ran the opening sentence of the Home Rule Bill of\r\n1893. The words I have italicized are harmless but superfluous. They\r\nhave never appeared in the Constitutions granted to Colonies, even at\r\nperiods when the Colonies were most distrusted. Nothing can impair the\r\nsupreme authority of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE AUTHORITY.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the Empire, power emanates from the Sovereign, and is\r\nwielded locally in his name.\r\n\r\nSection 9 of the British North America Act of 1867 runs as follows: \"The\r\nExecutive Government and authority of and over Canada is hereby declared\r\nto continue and be vested in the Queen.\" Similar words are used in the\r\nSouth Africa Act of 1909, and in the Commonwealth of Australia\r\nConstitution Act of 1900. Curiously enough, these were Acts to legalize\r\nthe Federation, or Union, of separate Colonies, and were passed at a\r\ntime when the principle embodied needed no affirmation. In earlier Acts\r\nfor granting Colonial Constitutions, the principle was taken for\r\ngranted, and implied in numerous provisions, but not stated explicitly.\r\nThe most recent unitary Constitution, that of the Transvaal (Section\r\n47), was even more reticent, though the principle was none the less\r\nclear. The point is unimportant, and the words used in the Home Rule\r\nBills of 1886 and 1893 (Clauses 5 and 7 respectively), modified to meet\r\na change of Sovereign, will serve very well: \"The Executive power in\r\nIreland (or the Executive Government of Ireland) shall continue vested\r\nin His Majesty....\"\r\n\r\nThereon follow the provisions for delegation of the Royal authority,\r\nfirst to the Sovereign's personal Representative in Ireland, and then\r\nthrough him to the members of the Irish Executive. The simpler these\r\nprovisions are, the better. What we know as responsible government has\r\nnever been defined in any Act of Parliament. The phrase \"responsible\r\ngovernment\" has only once appeared in any Constitution--namely, in the\r\npreamble of the Transvaal Constitution granted in 1906, and even then no\r\nattempt was made at definition, though certain sections, like certain\r\nsections in the Australian Constitutions of 1855 and in the later\r\nFederal Acts, inferentially suggested features of responsible\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe system is two-sided. Ministers are responsible on the one hand to\r\nthe King direct, as in Great Britain, or to the King's Representative,\r\nas in the Colonies, and, on the other hand, to the elected Legislature.\r\nIreland will resemble a Colony in being a dependent State under a\r\nRepresentative of the King--namely, the Lord-Lieutenant. This personage,\r\ncorresponding to the Colonial Governor, will also have to act in a dual\r\ncapacity. On the one hand he will be responsible to the King, or,\r\nvirtually, to the British Cabinet, and, on the other hand, he will be\r\nbound by an unwritten law to nominate for the Government of Ireland\r\npersons acceptable to the elected Legislature, and in Irish matters to\r\nact by their advice in all normal circumstances.\r\n\r\nLet us dispose first of the relation of the Ministers and of other\r\npublic officials to the Legislature. There will be no question,\r\npresumably, of giving statutory power to this relation. It is an\r\nunwritten custom--(1) that Ministers must be members of one branch of\r\nthe Legislature; (2) that they must hold the confidence of the elected\r\nbranch; (3) that, as a Cabinet, they stand or fall together; and,\r\nlastly, (4) that all non-political officials are excluded from the\r\nLegislature. The first and the last of these conventions have taken\r\nlegal form in some isolated cases;[167] the other two appear in no\r\nstatute that has yet been framed.[168]\r\n\r\nNeither have the functions in practice exercised by the Ministry or\r\nCabinet, nor the relations which in practice exist between it and the\r\nKing's Representative, ever had statutory definition. Whatever form the\r\nHome Rule Bill takes, it cannot give legal precision to these things.\r\nThe King's Representative always nominates an Executive Council--that\r\nis, a Cabinet to \"advise\" him in the Government, and whether, as in the\r\nBill of 1893, that Council is called an Executive Committee of the Privy\r\nCouncil of Ireland by analogy with the Dominion of Canada, where it is\r\nthe \"King's Privy Council for Canada,\" or whether it is merely an\r\nExecutive Council is immaterial. That it is, nominally, the\r\nconstitutional duty of the King's Representative (like that of the King\r\nhimself) to perform executive acts on the advice of his Ministers is\r\nnever stated expressly. He is always, and generally in the text of the\r\nConstitution, vested with the power of summoning, proroguing, and\r\ndissolving the Legislature, and of giving or withholding the Royal\r\nAssent to Bills. He also, by unwritten law, wields the prerogative of\r\nPardon, and appoints all public servants; and in all these cases, except\r\nin the case of appointing non-political officials, he occasionally has\r\nto act on his own personal responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis personal responsibility cannot be distinguished in practice from\r\nhis responsibility to the Crown, which appoints and can remove him.\r\nCases have arisen where the Governor of a self-governing Colony has\r\nwritten home for special guidance on some specific point, and where the\r\nanswer given has been that he must act on his own responsibility, or\r\nfollow the advice of his Ministers. All Colonial Governors, however,\r\nwhether or not their powers are defined in the Constitution, are\r\nappointed by Commission from the Crown with powers defined in Letters\r\nPatent and Instructions as to their exercise. These Letters Patent and\r\nInstructions are not of much importance in the case of a self-governing\r\nColony where responsible advice so largely controls the action of the\r\nGovernor. Sometimes the executive powers given by Instructions to the\r\nGovernor are indirectly alluded to in the Constitution, as in the South\r\nAfrica Act of 1909, where, by Clause 9, under the head of \"Executive\r\nGovernment,\" the Governor-General is \"to exercise such powers and\r\nfunctions of the King as His Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.\"\r\nIn the Australian and Canadian Acts of 1900 and 1867 respectively, the\r\nwords do not appear. I name this point because in Clause 5 of the Home\r\nRule Bill of 1893, and Clause 7 of the Bill of 1886, a similar course\r\nwas taken in providing that the Lord-Lieutenant should \"exercise any\r\nprerogatives, or other executive power of the Queen, the exercise of\r\nwhich may be delegated to him by Her Majesty.\" The words are not\r\nstrictly necessary. The Lord-Lieutenant will, of course, have his\r\nLetters Patent and Instructions, but the powers of the Crown are\r\ntheoretically absolute. If the Crown, acting under responsible British\r\nadvice, should wish to defy the Irish Legislature, it could do so\r\nwhatever the terms of the Bill.\r\n\r\nNaturally, there will be certain Imperial and non-Irish matters in which\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant will act primarily under the orders of the British\r\nCabinet, and the Departmental British Minister primarily responsible for\r\nIrish-Imperial matters would be the Home Secretary.[169]\r\n\r\nThe question may be raised, as in 1893 (July 3, Hansard), whether a\r\nstaff of Imperial officials ought not to be set up to conduct any\r\nImperial business which has to be done in Ireland, on the analogy of the\r\nFederal staff in the United States. I hope Mr. Gladstone's answer will\r\nstill hold good--that no such staff is needed; that the Irish officials\r\nwill be responsible, and ought, on the Home Rule principle, to be\r\ntrusted, as they are trusted in the Colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Assent to Bills is always a matter for express enactment in\r\nthe Constitution, but here the \"instructions\" of the Governor, and even\r\nhis personal \"discretion,\" have generally been alluded to in recent\r\nConstitutions, whether conferred by Act or Letters Patent. The typical\r\nform of words is that the Governor \"shall declare his Assent according\r\nto his discretion, but subject to His Majesty's instructions.\"[170] The\r\nHome Rule Bill of 1893 left out reference to \"discretion,\" and, on the\r\nother hand, is, I think, the only document of the kind in which the\r\n\"advice of the Executive Council\" has ever been expressly alluded to,\r\nalthough the practice, of course, is that the Assent, normally, is given\r\nor withheld on that advice. The Transvaal Constitution of 1906 (Section\r\n39) was unique in prescribing that special instructions must be received\r\nby the Governor in the case of each proposed law, before the Assent is\r\ngiven. I hope that will not be made a precedent for Ireland. Such\r\nprecautions only irritate the law-makers, and serve no useful purpose.\r\n\r\nColonial Governors, besides the power of Assent and Veto, may \"reserve\"\r\nBills for the Royal pleasure, which is to be signified within two years.\r\nMoreover, Bills which have received the Governor's Assent may be\r\ndisallowed within one or two years.[171] Neither of these provisions\r\nappeared in the Home Rule Bills of 1886 and 1893, and neither appear to\r\nbe strictly necessary, owing to the proximity of Ireland. Whatever is\r\ndone, we may hope that the practice now established in Canada, where the\r\nFederal Government never disallows a provincial law on any other ground\r\nthan that it is _ultra vires_, and, _a fortiori_, the similar practice\r\nas between Great Britain and the Dominions, may be imitated in the case\r\nof Ireland.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the terse and simple words of the Bill of 1886 really\r\nenunciate all that is necessary:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constitution of the Executive Authority.]\r\n\r\n\"7.--(1) The Executive Government of Ireland shall continue vested in\r\n(Her) Majesty, and shall be carried on by the Lord-Lieutenant on behalf\r\nof (Her) Majesty with the aid of such officers and such council as to\r\nHer Majesty may from time to time seem fit.\r\n\r\n     \"(2) Subject to any instructions which may from time to time be\r\n     given by (Her) Majesty, the Lord-Lieutenant shall give or withhold\r\n     the assent of (Her) Majesty to Bills passed by the Irish\r\n     Legislative Body, and shall exercise the prerogatives of (Her)\r\n     Majesty in respect of the summoning, proroguing, and dissolving of\r\n     the Irish Legislative Body, and any prerogatives the exercise of\r\n     which may be delegated to him by (Her) Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nLORD-LIEUTENANT AND CIVIL LIST.\r\n\r\nThe restriction as to the religion of the Lord-Lieutenant will, of\r\ncourse, be removed. There is no reason why his term of office should be\r\nlimited by law. His salary, payable by Ireland, should perhaps be stated\r\nin the Act, as in the case of Canada and South Africa, though not in\r\nthat of Australia. Australia, on the other hand, has a statutory Civil\r\nList, and a fixed Civil List was an invariable feature of the old\r\nConstitutions given to self-governing Colonies. Canada and South Africa\r\nare under no such restrictions, and it would be very inexpedient to\r\nimpose them upon Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Legislature will be given power, according to the historic\r\nphrase, \"to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of\r\nIreland,\" subject to restrictions afterwards named. That the laws should\r\nbe only \"in respect of matters exclusively relating to Ireland or some\r\npart thereof\" goes without saying, and need not be copied from the Bill\r\nof 1893 (Clause 2). Nor need the superfluous proviso in the same clause\r\nbe reproduced, asserting the \"supreme power and authority of the\r\nParliament of the United Kingdom.\" The supreme power becomes none the\r\nmore supreme for such assertions. Clause 2 of the Bill of 1886 is simple\r\nand decisive:\r\n\r\n     \"2. With the exceptions of and subject to the restrictions in this\r\n     Act mentioned, it shall be lawful for (Her) Majesty (the Queen), by\r\n     and with the advice of the Irish Legislative Body, to make laws for\r\n     the peace, order, and good government of Ireland, and by any such\r\n     law to alter and repeal any law in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nWith the restrictions on the powers of the Legislature I dealt fully\r\nenough in Chapter X.,[172] and I need only summarize my conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. _Reservations of Imperial Authority._--The Irish Legislature should\r\n_not_ have power to make laws upon--\r\n\r\n{The Crown or a Regency.\r\n{Making of War or Peace.\r\n{Prize and Booty of War.\r\n{Army or Navy.\r\n{Foreign Relations and Treaties (excepting Commercial Treaties).\r\n{Conduct as Neutrals.\r\n{Titles and Dignities.\r\n{Extradition.\r\n{Treason.\r\nCoinage.\r\nNaturalization and Alienage.\r\n\r\nReservation of the nine subjects included in the bracket is implied,\r\nwithout enactment, in all colonial Constitutions, but in the Irish Bill\r\nit is no doubt necessary that all reserved powers should be formally\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nAll powers not specifically reserved will belong to the Irish\r\nLegislature, subject to those restrictions, constitutional or statutory,\r\nwhich in matters like Trade and Navigation, Copyright, Patents, etc.,\r\nbind the whole Empire.\r\n\r\nSection 32 of the Bill of 1893, borrowed from the Colonial Laws Validity\r\nAct, will no doubt be applied.\r\n\r\n2. _Minority Safeguards_.--This point, too, I dealt with in Chapter\r\nX.[173] Let the Nationalist Members come forward and frankly accept any\r\nprohibitory clauses which the fears of the minority may suggest,\r\nprovided that they do not impair the ordinary legislative power which\r\nevery efficient Legislature must enjoy. Almost every conceivable\r\nsafeguard for the protection of religion, denominational education, and\r\ncivil rights was inserted in the Bill of 1893, including even some of\r\nthe \"slavery\" Amendments to the United States Constitution. The list may\r\nrequire revision--(_a_) in view of the recent establishment of the\r\nNational University, and the disappearances of all apprehension about\r\nthe status of Trinity College, Dublin; (_b_) in regard to an\r\nextraordinarily wide Sub-clause (No. 9) about interference with\r\nCorporations; (_c_) in regard to the words, \"in accordance with settled\r\nprinciples and precedents,\" which appeared in Sub-clause (No. 8)\r\n(Legislature to make no law \"Whereby any person may be deprived of life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law[174] _in accordance with\r\nsettled principles and precedents_,\" etc.). A debate on this question\r\nmay be found in Hansard, May 30, 1893. The words italicized were added\r\nin Committee on the motion of Mr. Gerald Balfour, though the\r\nAttorney-General declared that they gave no additional strength to the\r\nphrase \"due process of law,\" while they certainly appear calculated to\r\nprovoke litigation. Sir Henry James appeared to think that they made the\r\nsuspension of the Habeas Corpus Act _ultra vires._ If that is their\r\neffect, there is no reason why they should be inserted. Even a Canadian\r\nProvince, whose powers are more limited than those of the subordinate\r\nStates in any other Federation, has \"exclusive\" powers within its own\r\nborders over \"property and civil rights,\"[175] and can, beyond any\r\ndoubt, suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, if it pleases.\r\n\r\nThe same superfluous words appeared in Sub-clause (No. 9) about\r\nCorporations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH LEGISLATURE.[176]\r\n\r\nAs I urged in Chapter X., this is a subject in which large powers of\r\nconstitutional revision--much larger than those contained in either of\r\nthe Home Rule Bills--should be given to the Irish Legislature itself,\r\ncorresponding to the powers given by statute to the self-governing\r\nColonies, and to the powers always held by the constituent States of a\r\nFederation. In the Bill itself it would be wisest to follow beaten\r\ntracks as far as possible, and not to embark on experiments. Present\r\nconditions are, unhappily, very unfavourable for the elaboration of any\r\nscheme ideally fit for Ireland.\r\n\r\n_A Bi-Cameral Legislature._--Working on this principle, we must affirm\r\nthat Ireland's position, without representation in the Imperial\r\nParliament, would certainly make a Second Chamber requisite. Three of\r\nthe Provinces within the Federation of Canada (Manitoba, British\r\nColumbia, and Ontario) prefer to do without Second Chambers--so do most\r\nof the Swiss Cantons--but all the Federal Legislatures of the world are\r\nbi-cameral, and all the unitary Constitutions of self-governing Colonies\r\nhave been, or are, bi-cameral.\r\n\r\n_The Upper Chamber._--One simple course would be to constitute the Upper\r\nChamber of a limited number of Irish Peers, chosen by the whole of their\r\nnumber, as they are chosen at present for representation in the House of\r\nLords. Historical and practical considerations render this course out of\r\nthe question, though some people would be fairly sanguine about the\r\nsuccess of such a body in commanding confidence, on the indispensable\r\ncondition that all representation at Westminster were to cease. It has\r\nbeen membership, before the Union of an ascendency Parliament, and after\r\nthe Union of an absentee Parliament, which has kept the bulk of the\r\nIrish peerage in violent hostility to the bulk of the Irish people.\r\nThose Peers who seek and obtain a career in an Irish popular\r\nLegislature--to both branches of which they will, of course, be\r\neligible--will be able to do valuable service to their country. The same\r\napplies to all landlords. Now that land reform is converting Ireland\r\nitself into a nation of small landholders, who, in most countries, are\r\nvery Conservative in tendency, the ancient cleavage is likely to\r\ndisappear. Indeed, an ideal Second Chamber ought perhaps to give special\r\nweight to urban and industrial interests, while aiming, not at an\r\nobstructive, but at a revising body of steady, moderate, highly-educated\r\nbusiness men.\r\n\r\nWe have to choose one of two alternatives: a nominated or an elective\r\nchamber. The choice is difficult, for second chambers all over the world\r\nmay be said to be on their trial. On the other hand, nothing vital\r\ndepends upon the choice, for experience proves that countries can\r\nflourish equally under every imaginable variety of second chamber,\r\nprovided that means exist for enabling popular wishes, in the long-run,\r\nto prevail. The European and American examples are of little use to us,\r\nand the widely varied types within the Empire admit of no sure\r\ninferences. Allowance must be made for the effect of the Referendum\r\nwherever it exists (as in Australia and Switzerland), as a force tending\r\nto weaken both Chambers, but especially the Upper Chamber of a\r\nLegislature. It does, indeed, seem to be generally admitted, even by\r\nCanadians, that the nominated Senate of the Dominion of Canada, which is\r\nadded to on strict party principles by successive Governments, is not a\r\nsuccess, and it was so regarded by the Australian Colonies when they\r\nentered upon Federation, and set up an elective Senate. The South\r\nAfrican statesmen, who had to reckon with racial divisions similar to\r\nthose in Ireland, compromised with a Senate partly nominated, partly\r\nelected, but made the whole arrangement revisable in ten years.[177]\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable, perhaps, on similar grounds of immediate policy,\r\nto let those who now represent the minority in Ireland have a deciding\r\nvoice in the matter. No arrangement made otherwise than by a free\r\nIreland herself can be regarded as final, and I suggest only that a\r\nnominated Chamber would be the best expedient at the outset, or in the\r\nalternative a partly nominated, partly elected Chamber.\r\n\r\nIf and in so far as the Upper Chamber is elective, should election be\r\ndirect or indirect? There is a somewhat attractive Irish precedent for\r\nindirect election, namely, the present highly successful Department of\r\nAgriculture, whose Council and Boards the County Councils have a share\r\nin constituting,[178] and I have seen and admired a most ingenious\r\nscheme of Irish manufacture for constructing the whole Irish Legislature\r\nand Ministry on this principle. But the objections appear to be\r\nconsiderable. Local bodies in the future should not be mixed up in\r\nnational politics. That has been their bane in the past. Besides, the\r\nprinciple of indirect election is under a cloud everywhere, most of all\r\nin the United States. Australia rejected it in 1900, and the South\r\nAfricans, while giving it partial recognition in the Senate, made the\r\nexpedient provisional.\r\n\r\n_The Lower House_.--The Lower House might very well be elected on the\r\nsame franchise and from the same constituencies as at present, subject\r\nto any small redistributional modifications necessitated by changes of\r\npopulation. This is certainly a matter which Ireland should have full\r\npower to settle for itself subsequently.\r\n\r\nLord Courtney's proposals for Proportional Representation[179] merit\r\nclose consideration and possess great attractions, especially in view of\r\ntheir very favourable reception from Nationalists in Ireland. My own\r\nfeeling is that such novel proposals may overload a Bill which, however\r\nsimply it be framed, will provoke very long and very warm discussion. If\r\nthe system were to be regarded by the present minority as a real\r\nsafeguard for their interests, its establishment, on tactical grounds\r\nalone, would be worth any expenditure of time and trouble; but, if they\r\naccept the assumption that existing parties in Ireland are going to be\r\nstereotyped under Home Rule, and then point to the paucity of Unionists\r\nin all parts of Ireland but the north-east of Ulster, they can\r\ndemonstrate that no _practicable_ enlargement of constituencies could\r\nseriously influence the results of an election. My own view, already\r\nexpressed, is that, provided we give Ireland sufficient freedom, wholly\r\nnew parties must, within a short time, inevitably be formed in Ireland,\r\nand the old barriers of race and religion be broken down, and,\r\ntherefore, that all expedients devised on the contrary hypothesis will\r\neventually prove to be needless and might even prove unpopular and\r\ninconvenient. On the other hand, merits are claimed, with a great show\r\nof reason, for Proportional Representation, which are altogether\r\nindependent of the protection of minorities from oppression. It is\r\nclaimed that the system brings forward moderate men of all shades of\r\nopinion, checks party animus, and steadies the policy of the State. But\r\nI think that a free Ireland should be the judge of these merits. At\r\npresent the bulk of the people do not understand the subject, and need\r\nmuch education before they can appreciate the issue.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the conventional party system, based on conventional\r\nconstituencies, will, to say the least, do no more harm to Ireland than\r\nto any other State in the Empire. Any minor defects will be\r\ninfinitesimal beside the vast and beneficial change wrought by\r\nresponsible government.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to provide for this, and it would be difficult to better\r\nthe proposal in the Bill of 1893: that after two years, or an\r\nintervening dissolution, the question should be decided by a joint vote\r\nin joint session.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONEY BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\nTo originate in the Lower House on the motion of a Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICE.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin Metropolitan Police should be\r\nunder Irish control from the first. The former force will undoubtedly\r\nhave to be reconstituted, and its reconstitution, as an ordinary Civil\r\nPolice, ought to be undertaken by the Irish Government, but the\r\nfinancial interests of \"retrenched\" officers and men should be\r\nsafeguarded in the Bill itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGES.\r\n\r\nAll future appointments should be made by the Irish Government, without\r\nthe suspensory period of six years named in the Bill of 1893. Present\r\nIrish Judges should retain their appointments, as in both previous\r\nBills. The precedent of Canada, where provincial Judges, unlike the\r\nState Judges of Australia, are appointed and paid by the Federal\r\nGovernment, is certainly not relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW COURTS.\r\n\r\nThe Federal analogy, except in one particular noticed under the next\r\nheading, has no application to Ireland. Only one provision of any\r\nimportance is needed, namely, that Appeals, in the last resort, should\r\nbe to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council instead of to the\r\nHouse of Lords. The Judicial Committee is the final Court of Appeal for\r\nthe whole Empire, and, strengthened by one or more Irish Judges, should\r\nhear Irish Appeals. It is true that the tribunal has been subjected to\r\nsome criticism lately, especially from Australia. Federal States\r\nnaturally wish to secure pre-eminent authority for their own Supreme\r\nCourts. But the tribunal is, on the whole, popular with the colonial\r\ndemocracies, and the argument from distance and expense does not apply\r\nto Ireland. At the end of an interesting discussion at the last Imperial\r\nConference, in which suggestions were put forward for strengthening the\r\nJudicial Committee by Colonial Judges, it was agreed that new proposals\r\nshould be made by the Imperial Government for an Imperial Final Court of\r\nAppeal in two divisions, one for the United Kingdom, another for the\r\nColonies. If that step is taken, the position of Ireland will need fresh\r\nconsideration.[180]\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS.[181]\r\n\r\nThe validity of an Irish Act which has received the Royal Assent will,\r\nlike that of a Colonial Act which has received the Royal Assent, be\r\ndetermined in the ordinary course by the Irish Courts, with an ultimate\r\nappeal to the Judicial Committee, which should be strengthened for the\r\noccasion by one or more Irish Judges. But both the previous Home Rule\r\nBills made the convenient provision that the Lord-Lieutenant should have\r\nthe power of referring questions of validity arising on a Bill, before\r\nits enactment, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for final\r\ndecision. There is a useful Canadian precedent for this provision, in\r\nthe Imperial Act passed in 1891, for giving the Governor-General in\r\nCouncil power, in the widest terms, to refer, _inter alia_, questions\r\ntouching provincial legislation to the Supreme Court of Canada, with an\r\nappeal from it to the Judicial Committee.[182] To follow this precedent\r\nwould not involve any Federal complications.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCHEQUER JUDGES.\r\n\r\nIf Ireland controls her own Customs and Excise, no provision for this\r\ntribunal appears to be necessary, unless it be that some counterpart is\r\nneeded for the Colonial Courts of Admiralty.[183] The Bill of 1886\r\n(Clause 20) limited the jurisdiction to revenue questions. The Bill of\r\n1893 (Clause 19) widened it to include \"any matter not within the power\r\nof the Irish Legislature,\" or \"any matter affected by a law which the\r\nIrish Legislature have not power to repeal or alter.\" The minds of the\r\nauthors of this clause were evidently affected by the Federal principle\r\nwhich involves two judicial authorities--one for Federal, one for\r\nprovincial matters. There seems to be no reason for embarking on any\r\nsuch complications in the case of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFEGUARDS FOR EXISTING PUBLIC SERVANTS IN IRELAND.[184]\r\n\r\nRetrenchment, and in some departments drastic retrenchment, will be\r\nneeded in the Irish public service, just as it was needed in the\r\nTransvaal after the grant of Home Rule to that Colony. It is highly\r\ndesirable that statutory provision should be made safeguarding existing\r\ninterests. No such provision was made in the case of the Transvaal, and\r\nsome bad feeling resulted. The past responsibility for excessive Civil\r\nexpenditure lies, of course, on Great Britain, as it lay in the case of\r\nthe Transvaal, and on grounds of abstract justice it would have been\r\nfair in that case for Great Britain to have assumed a limited part of\r\nthe expense of compensating retrenched public servants. The practical\r\nobjections to such a policy are, however, very great. In this, as in all\r\nmatters, Ireland will gain more by independence than by financial aid,\r\nhowever strongly justified. All payments should be a direct charge upon\r\nthe Irish Exchequer, not, as in some cases under the Bill of 1893, upon\r\nthe Imperial Exchequer in the first instance, with provision for\r\nrepayment from Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCE.\r\n\r\nI summarize the conclusions already indicated in previous chapters:\r\n\r\n1. Fiscal independence, with complete control over all Irish taxation\r\nand expenditure.\r\n\r\n2. Initial deficit to be supplied by a grant-in-aid, diminishing\r\nannually and terminable in a short period, say, seven years.\r\n\r\n3. Future contribution to Imperial services to be voluntary.\r\n\r\n4. Remission to Ireland of her share of the National Debt, and\r\nrelinquishment by Ireland of her share of the Imperial Miscellaneous\r\nRevenue.\r\n\r\n5. Imperial credit for Land Purchase to be extended as before, by loans\r\nguaranteed on the Consolidated Fund, under any conditions now or\r\nhereafter to be made by the Imperial authorities.\r\n\r\nLoans to the Public Works Commissioners to be optional.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION AT WESTMINSTER.\r\n\r\nTo cease.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFERENCE BETWEEN THE IRISH AND IMPERIAL AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important point, because friendly consultation, as at\r\npresent with the Colonies, will take the place of Irish representation\r\nin the Imperial Parliament, and will prove a far more satisfactory means\r\nof securing harmony and co-operation. Arrangements similar to those of\r\nthe Imperial Conference, only more precise and efficient, and of a\r\npermanent character, should be made for consultation between the Irish\r\nand British authorities on all subjects where the interests of the two\r\ncountries touch one another. The need for more frequent consultation\r\nwith the Colonies is being felt with increasing force, and although no\r\npermanent consultation body has yet been created, special _ad hoc_\r\nconferences have recently been held--for Defence in 1909, and for\r\nCopyright in 1910--in addition to the quadrennial meetings, where a vast\r\namount of varied topics are discussed, and the most valuable decisions\r\narrived at.[185]\r\n\r\nWhat the precise machinery should be in the case of Anglo-Irish\r\nrelations I do not venture to say. The Ministers of the respective\r\ncountries will be so easily accessible to one another that there would\r\nseem to be no need for the frequent attendance of a powerful personnel\r\nat joint meetings. But a Standing Committee, with a small official\r\nstaff, would be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.[186]\r\n\r\nFor amendment of the Home Rule Act itself it is not possible to make any\r\nstatutory provision. Like all Constitutional Acts, it will only be\r\nalterable by another Imperial statute, which, if it were needed, should\r\nbe promoted by Ireland. But one of the most important clauses in the Act\r\nitself will be that defining Ireland's power to amend her own\r\nConstitution without coming to Parliament. I venture to repeat the view\r\nthat this power should be as wide as possible, consistently with the\r\nmaintenance of the Imperial authority, and subject, of course, to\r\nprovisions prescribing--(1) a time-limit for the initial arrangements;\r\n(2) the method of ascertaining Irish opinion; and (3) the majority in\r\nthe Legislature, or in the electorate, or in both, necessary to sanction\r\na constitutional change.[187] If a Home Rule Constitution, passed into\r\nlaw in the heat of a party fight at Westminster, proves to be perfect, a\r\nmiracle will have been performed unparalleled in the history of the\r\nEmpire. At this moment a Committee of Ireland's ablest men of all\r\nparties should be at work upon it, with an instructed public opinion\r\nbehind them. So only are good Constitutions made, and even the very best\r\nneed subsequent amendment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[166] For details of prior Home Rule Bills, see the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[167] The Victorian and South Australian Constitutions of 1855 state in\r\nclear terms that the Ministry must be members of the Legislature, and\r\nall the Australian Constitutions of the same date, except that of\r\nTasmania, formally exclude all other officials from the Legislature. The\r\nTransvaal Constitution of 1906 made no reference to either point; nor do\r\nthe Federating Acts of 1867, 1900, and 1909 for Canada, Australia, and\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\n[168] A fifth custom, very common, of compelling new Ministers to seek\r\nre-election is incorporated in most of the Australian Constitutions, but\r\nwas expressly ruled out in Section 47 of the Transvaal Constitution of\r\n1906.\r\n\r\n[169] See Hansard, July 3, 1893, Speech of Mr. John Morley.\r\n\r\n[170] The words \"subject to this Constitution\" or \"subject to this Act\"\r\nare sometimes added, but have no special significance. The Australian\r\nCommonwealth Constitution Act does not mention the Governor's\r\n\"instructions,\" but only his \"discretion.\"\r\n\r\n[171] British North America Act, 1867, Sects. 55-57; Commonwealth of\r\nAustralia Constitution Act, 1900, Sects. 58-60.\r\n\r\n[172] See especially pp. 213-229.\r\n\r\n[173] See pp. 223-225.\r\n\r\n[174] Taken from Amendment XIV. to the United States Constitution,\r\npassed July 28, 1866.\r\n\r\n[175] British North America Act, 1867, Sect. 92 (13).

Within the Empire, the utmost achieved\r\nby the government of white men without their own consent is to weaken\r\ntheir capacity to assume the sacred responsibility of self-government.\r\nIt is impossible to kill the idea of Home Rule, though it is possible,\r\nby retarding its realization, to pervert some of its strength and\r\nbeauty, and to diminish the vital energy on which its fruition depends.\r\nAnd it is possible in the case of Ireland, up to and in the very hour of\r\nher emancipation, after a struggle more bitter and exhausting than any\r\nin the Empire, to heap obstacles in the path of the men who have carried\r\nher to the goal, and on whom in the first instance must fall the\r\nextraordinarily difficult and delicate task of political reconstruction.\r\nThey will be on their mettle in the eyes of the world to prove that the\r\nprophets of evil were wrong, to show sympathy and inspire confidence in\r\nthe very quarters where they have been most savagely traduced and least\r\ntrusted, and they will have to exhibit dauntless courage in attacking\r\nold abuses and promoting new reforms. They will need their hands\r\nstrengthened in every possible way.\r\n\r\nThe help must come--and it cannot come too soon--from the working\r\noptimists of Ireland, from the hundreds of men and women, of both\r\nparties and creeds, who are labouring outside politics to extirpate that\r\nstifling undergrowth of pessimism which runs riot in countries denied\r\nthe light and air of freedom. All these people agree on the axiom that\r\nIreland has a distinct individual existence, and that her future depends\r\nupon herself. No one should dare to stop there. Let him who feels\r\nimpelled to stop there at any rate act with open eyes. In expecting to\r\nrealize social reconstruction without political reconstruction--however\r\ndivergent the aims may now seem to be--he expects to achieve what has\r\nnever been achieved in any country in the Empire, and to achieve this\r\nmiracle in the very country which has suffered most from political\r\nrepression, and possesses the most fantastic system of government to be\r\nfound in the King's dominions. The thing is impossible, and if at bottom\r\nhe feels it to be so, and inclines sadly to the view that political\r\nservitude is but the least of two evils, I would only venture to suggest\r\nthis: Is it not a finer course to stake something on a risk run in every\r\nwhite community but Ireland rather than to face the certainty of half\r\nachievement? And is it not, after all, a sound risk to trust the very\r\nmen who now respond to the appeal for self-reliance, mutual tolerance,\r\nand united effort in their private affairs, not to renounce these\r\nqualities and abuse the rights of citizenship when the public affairs of\r\ntheir country are under their own control?\r\n\r\nAs for the risk to Great Britain, I have only this last word to say: Let\r\nher people, not for the first time, show that they can rise superior to\r\nthe philosophy, as fallacious in effect as it is base and cowardly in\r\npurpose, which sets the safety of a great nation above the happiness and\r\nprosperity of a small one. Within the last few weeks the wheel has\r\nturned full circle, and the almost inexplicable contradiction which has\r\nexisted for so long between Unionism and Imperialism has been\r\nilluminated with a frank cynicism rare in our public life. It is being\r\nsaid that the freedom given to Canada cannot be given to Ireland,\r\nbecause the separation from the Empire theoretically rendered possible\r\nby such a step would be immaterial in the case of Canada, which is\r\ndistant, but perilous in the case of Ireland, which is near. If this be\r\nImperialism, it should stink in the nostrils of every decent citizen at\r\nhome and abroad.\r\n\r\nIt is true, to our shame, that, by little more than an accident, Canada\r\nobtained the freedom which gave her people harmony, energy, and wealth\r\nin the teeth of this mean and selfish doctrine. But Lord Durham took a\r\nhigher view. Let me recall the memorable words which he added to his\r\nlong and brilliant argument for liberty as a source, not only of\r\ndomestic regeneration, but of affection and loyalty to the Motherland:\r\n\"_But at any rate our first duty is to secure the well-being of our\r\ncolonial countrymen;_ and if, in the hidden decrees of that wisdom by\r\nwhich this world is ruled, it is written that these countries are not\r\nfor ever to remain portions of the Empire, we owe it to our honour to\r\ntake good care that, when they separate from us, they should not be the\r\nonly countries on the American continent in which the Anglo-Saxon race\r\nshall be found unfit to govern itself.\"\r\n\r\nLord Durham was doubly right; in his prophecy of the closer union\r\nliberty would promote, and in elementary law which he laid down, of\r\nmoral obligation which, whatever the result, he held superior to\r\ndynastic calculations. It is a fact of ominous significance that the\r\nintellectual successors of the men who most hotly repudiated both these\r\ndoctrines in 1838 are being driven by pressure of their Irish views to\r\nrevive that repudiation in 1911, and to revive it in the midst of the\r\nmost effusive protestations of the need for still closer union with a\r\nColony which would either have undergone the fate of Ireland or have\r\nceased to be a member of the Empire if their philosophy had triumphed. I\r\ndo not believe there is any conscious cant in that flagrant\r\ncontradiction, but I do firmly believe that so long as their error about\r\nIreland poisons in them the springs of Imperial thought, some element of\r\nfallacy lies in any Imperial policy they undertake. In common prudence,\r\nat any rate, they should avoid telling Canada, while beckoning her\r\nnearer to the heart of the Empire, that they only gave her freedom\r\nbecause she was so far.\r\n\r\nBut I rely still on an awakening, on a fundamental change of spirit. The\r\nEmpire owes everything to those who have disputed, sometimes at the cost\r\nof their lives, illegitimate authority. Some day the politicians who now\r\nspend sleepless nights with paste and scissors in ransacking the ancient\r\nfiles of the world's Press for proofs that Mr. Redmond once used words\r\nsignifying that he aimed at \"separation\"--whatever that phrase may\r\nmean--will regret that they ever demeaned themselves by such petty\r\nlabour, and will place Mr. Redmond among the number of those who have\r\nsaved the Empire from the consequences of its own errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE TABLE, SHOWING THE PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS OF THE HOME RULE\r\nBILLS OF 1886 AND 1893\r\n\r\nHOME RULE BILL OF 1886.

Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements differed widely in the two Bills.\r\n\r\nThe main points of likeness were: (1) That from the first there was to\r\nbe a _separate Irish Exchequer_; (2) that for all time Ireland was to be\r\n_denied control over the imposition of Customs and Excise_--that is to\r\nsay, over about _three-quarters of her revenue_ as then raised; (3) that\r\nabout _a third of the cost of the Irish Police_ was to be paid by the\r\nImperial Government; (4) that payments due from Ireland to the Imperial\r\nGovernment were to be made a first charge on proceeds of Imperial taxes\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe principal points of difference were:\r\n\r\n1. Under the Bill of 1886, apart from the very important restriction of\r\nCustoms and Excise, Ireland was at once to have freedom to control her\r\nown taxation.\r\n\r\nUnder the Bill of 1893 (as amended) there was to be a suspensory period\r\nof six years during which all existing taxes were to continue to be\r\nimposed by the Imperial Government; but with power to Ireland to add\r\ntaxes of her own. _Amounts_ of Imperial taxes might be varied, but _no\r\nnew ones_ imposed, except specially for war. After six years, financial\r\nfreedom, except in Customs and Excise. Excise, however, was to be\r\n_collected_, though not levied, by Ireland.\r\n\r\n2. \"_Collected\" and \"True\" Revenue_.--In 1886, Ireland was credited with\r\nall the revenue _collected in Ireland_ from Customs and Excise _(i.e.,_\r\nthe \"gross\" revenue from those taxes), but she had to pay the cost of\r\ncollection herself.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 allowance was made for duties collected in Ireland on articles\r\nconsumed in Great Britain, and _vice versa,_ Ireland being credited only\r\nwith her \"true\" revenue--that is, revenue from dutiable articles\r\n_consumed in Ireland._ Similar allowances made in the Income Tax\r\naccount. A joint Anglo-Irish Committee was to settle these adjustments.\r\nThis system involved a deduction from the first year's gross Irish\r\nrevenue of nearly two millions. (In 1886 the corresponding sum, credited\r\nto Ireland, was £1,400,000.) On the other hand, in 1893 the greater part\r\nof the cost of collection (£235,000) was not to be borne by Ireland.\r\n\r\n3. _Imperial Contribution by Ireland._--In 1886, a fixed annual maximum,\r\nwhich might be diminished, but could not be exceeded, revisable in\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 (for six years) an annually ascertained _quota_--namely, a third\r\nof Ireland's \"true\" revenue (exclusive of taxes imposed by herself).\r\n\r\n4. _Ireland's Budget._--Note the important point that under both Bills\r\nthree-quarters of Irish revenue was derived from Customs and Excise,\r\nover which, in 1886, Ireland could exercise no control; in 1903 only the\r\ncontrol given by the presence of eighty members in the House of Commons.\r\nIn both cases Ireland was to be wholly responsible for her own civil\r\nexpenditure (except for the existing Police). Under both Bills Ireland\r\nwas intended to start with a surplus of about half a million, which may\r\nbe regarded roughly as the equivalent, in both cases, of the Imperial\r\nshare of the cost of the Irish Police. But note that, in 1886, Ireland\r\nbeing pledged to pay a fixed million of the cost of Police, would obtain\r\nno relief until the cost was reduced below a million; while in 1893,\r\npaying two-thirds of the annually ascertained cost, she would obtain\r\nrelief from any annual reduction. The Police referred to was, of course,\r\nthe then existing Police, imperially organized and controlled. The new\r\ncivil Police eventually set up in substitution would be financed and\r\ncontrolled by the Irish Government. The charges, therefore, on the\r\nBritish taxpayer would, it was expected, be a rapidly diminishing one.\r\n\r\nThe loss on Irish posts in 1893, debited against Ireland, was estimated\r\nat £52,000.\r\n\r\n5. _Special War Taxes._--Ireland's contribution optional in 1886; in\r\n1893, compulsory (at any rate, for six years, which would have included\r\nthe beginning of the South African War).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nAbercromby, Sir R., 57, 129\r\nAbsentee taxes, in Ireland, 23-30;\r\n  in Australasia, 116\r\nAbsenteeism,\r\n  in Ireland, 12, 51;\r\n  in Prince Edward Island, 75-76;\r\n  in Upper Canada, 80;\r\n  in Lower Canada, 85;\r\n  in Australia, 110\r\nAcadia.
