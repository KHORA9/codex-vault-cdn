III.--MARCH, 1863.--No. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decline of the Turkish Empire has furnished an eloquent theme for\r\nhistorians, who have ever made it the 'point and commendation of their\r\ntale.' Judging from its decline, they have predicted its fall. Half a\r\ncentury ago, the historian of the middle ages expected with an assurance\r\nthat 'none can deem extravagant,' the approaching subversion of the\r\nOttoman power. Although deprived of some of its richest possessions and\r\ndefeated in many a well-fought field, the house of Othman still\r\nstands--amid crumbling monarchies and subjugated countries; the crescent\r\nstill glitters on the Bosphorus, and still the 'tottering arch of\r\nconquest spans the ample region from Bagdad to Belgrade.'\r\n\r\nYet, how sadly changed is Turkey from her former self--how varied the\r\nfortunes of her classic fields! The physical features of the country are\r\nthe same as in the days of Solyman the Magnificent; the same noble\r\nrivers water the fertile valleys, and the same torrents sweep down the\r\nmountain sides; the waves of the Ægean and Mediterranean wash the same\r\nshores, fertile in vines and olive trees; the same heaven smiles over\r\nthe tombs of the storied brave--but here no longer is the abode of the\r\nrulers and lawgivers of one half the world.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and with some degree of truth, that the Turks are\r\nencamped, not settled in Europe. In their political and social\r\ninstitutions they have never comported themselves as if they anticipated\r\nto make it their continuing home. Their oriental legends relate how the\r\nbelief arose in the very hour of conquest that the standard of the Cross\r\nshould at some future day be carried to the Bosphorus, and that the\r\nEuropean portion of the empire would he regained by Christians. From\r\nthis superstitious belief they selected the Asiatic shore for the burial\r\nof true Mussulmans; nor was it altogether a fanciful belief, for in the\r\nsudden rise of Russia, Turkey foresaw the harbinger of her fall, and\r\nrecognized in Muscovite warriors the antagonists of fate.\r\n\r\nA nation to be long-lived must rise higher and higher in the scale of\r\ncivilization; must approach nearer and nearer its meridian, but never\r\nculminate. The Athenians reached the zenith of their glory in the age of\r\nPericles, and lost in fifty years what they had acquired in centuries.\r\nThe Turks attained their meridian greatness in the reign of Solyman the\r\nMagnificent--from which time dates their decline.\r\n\r\nIf we make a comparison between Turkey and her formidable neighbor,\r\nRussia, we shall find that the latter adopted, while the former resisted\r\nreforms. Turkey was in the fulness of her power when Russia had not yet\r\na name. The spirit of the Ottomans was remarkably exclusive. They\r\nregarded themselves as a separate and distinct people; they were\r\nconquerors, and as such thought themselves a superior race--men who were\r\nto teach and not to learn. In their intercourse with other nations, they\r\nborrowed nothing, and out of themselves looked for nothing. Their\r\nfeeling of national glory was not extinguished by national degradation,\r\nbut cherished through ages of slavery and shame. But the world is a\r\nworld of progress. A nation cannot remain stationary; she must advance\r\nor retrograde. Turkey is not what she was, while Russia, with the rest\r\nof Christendom, has advanced; her faults grew with her strength, but did\r\nnot die with her decay. It will not be sufficient for her merely to\r\nregain her former power; she must overtake Christendom in the progress\r\nmade during her decadence. Her spirit of vitality is not yet extinct; it\r\nwants guidance and development to strengthen and elevate it. There is\r\nstill hope of reforming the Turkish empire without that baptism of blood\r\nwhich many have urged and are still urging. Indeed, Lord Palmerston\r\ndeclared in Parliament that Turkey has made a more rapid advance and\r\nbeen improved more during the last ten years (he made this statement in\r\n1854, and Turkey has been rapidly progressing since) than any other\r\ncountry in Europe.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the question of reform, it will be necessary to take\r\na cursory view of Turkish history and character.\r\n\r\nWhile the monarchs of Constantinople were waging war with Persia, and\r\nboth empires were tottering; while the Christian religion gave rise to\r\ndifferent sects, hating each other with intense and fanatical hatred, a\r\nsilent power was rising among the Turks, which was destined to subvert\r\nempires and found a new religion. Their original seat was among the\r\nAltai mountains, where they were employed by their masters in working\r\niron mines. They rose in rebellion, threw off their allegiance, and made\r\nincursions into Persia and China, proving themselves formidable enemies.\r\nFrom being a weak and enslaved people they became the allies and\r\nconquerors of the Byzantine emperors. 'With the Koran in one hand,' says\r\nMacaulay, 'and the sword in the other, they went forth conquering and\r\nconverting eastward to the Bay of Bengal, and westward to the Pillars of\r\nHercules.' They became a terror to the nations that had beheld with\r\ncontempt their rising greatness. Amid the expiring glories of the Roman\r\nworld they made Constantinople the capital of their empire. It was all\r\nthat the oriental imagination could desire. Rendered by its\r\nfortifications impregnable, and situated on the Bosphorus, whose dark\r\nblue waters flow between shores of unrivalled beauty, where nature and\r\nart had reared their grandest monuments, it surpassed in wealth and\r\ngrandeur Nineveh and Babylon.\r\n\r\nFrom this stronghold, which had been the cradle of Christianity, and\r\nwhich had witnessed the dying struggle of the Roman empire, the\r\nconquerors, maddened with the victories and crowned with the wealth\r\nwhich years of perpetual war had heaped upon them, mustered their armies\r\nand sallied forth. They subjugated many countries, but copied none of\r\ntheir virtues; and to-day their degenerate descendants still retain most\r\nof their original traits of character. Their religious sense is deep,\r\nbut theirs is a religion which blunts and stupefies the intellectual\r\nfaculties, and makes man fit only to perform a score of prostrations\r\neach day. It inspires courage in war, but it also teaches blind\r\nresignation to defeat and disgrace: it teaches morality, but sensuality\r\nand ferocity are not inconsistent with its doctrines. Eat, drink,\r\nsmoke--indulge all the passions to-day, for immortality begins\r\nto-morrow! No Turk is so high that he has not a master, none so low that\r\nhe has not a slave; the grand vizier kisses the sultan's foot, the pasha\r\nkisses the vizier's, the bey the pasha's, and so on. Yet their many\r\nvirtues half redeem their faults. They are proverbial for their\r\nhospitality, and charity, which 'covereth a multitude of sins,' is an\r\noriental virtue. They have, too, great love of nationality. The beggar\r\nwho seeks alms of the Turk with cries and entreaties, will not ask a\r\nsingle para of the Frank (a name applied to all foreigners).\r\n\r\nTurkey in Europe, though smaller in extent than the Asiatic division of\r\nthe empire, is by far the wealthier and more important. It extends from\r\nRussia to the Adriatic, and from Hungary to the Euxine sea, the command\r\nof which it shares jointly with Russia. The Straits of Constantinople,\r\nthe Dardanelles, and the Sea of Marmora are free to all friendly\r\nnations. The situation of the country, its numerous and safe harbors,\r\nare all favorable to commerce. There is every variety of climate, and\r\nthe soil in every part of the empire is fertile, and, when cultivated,\r\nyields productions in the greatest abundance. The agricultural, like the\r\nmanufacturing industry, owing to the indolence of the people, is much\r\nneglected. This indolence is, in a great measure, the result of\r\noppression. Before Russia extended her protection over the provinces,\r\nthe Turks left agriculture to their tributaries, whom, when wealthy and\r\nprosperous, they plundered.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the causes which led to the decline of the empire.\r\nIn the reign of Solyman, poetry, science, and art flourished. New\r\nprivileges were conferred upon the ministers of religion; the\r\nJanissaries received increased pay; the coffers of the empire were\r\nfilled to overflowing; the condition of the rayas was ameliorated;\r\nsecurity to life, honor, and property was given to all, without\r\ndistinction of creed or race. But even then there were causes at work\r\ndestined to effect a decline. The sultan in person was ever at the head\r\nof his troops. Thus the vizier, or prime minister, who remained in the\r\ncapital, became, by degrees, a more influential personage than 'the\r\ngrand seignior' himself. The intrigues of the eunuchs in the imperial\r\nharem began to exert their baneful influences on the administration. The\r\nseraglio--in which many hundred females are immured, the most beautiful\r\nthat can be found in the contiguous realms of Europe and Asia, wherever\r\nthe Turk bears sway--from being the most beautiful appendage, became the\r\nmoving spring of the Ottoman Porte. The inmates formed a faction hostile\r\nto the ministers of religion. The administration was transferred to\r\nGreeks, Jews, and Armenians, who filled the treasury of the sultan and\r\nenriched themselves by impoverishing the people, who, since they could\r\nno longer enjoy the fruits of their labor, became indolent. The army was\r\nmore eager for booty and captives than for glory; slaves were\r\nmultiplied; the higher classes revelled in wealth and luxury, while the\r\npoorer classes with difficulty obtained a livelihood.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange, indeed, if in an empire so extensive and with an\r\nimmense and motley population, we did not find it difficult to introduce\r\nreforms, and instruct the people in the arts of more civilized nations,\r\nand remove old abuses, guarded by the fanaticism of the clergy.\r\nPolitical reforms can be made only by those in high places of authority;\r\nand to be sanctioned by the prejudiced and infatuated Ottoman they must\r\nassume the garb of religion. The sultan himself, wielding the sceptre\r\nover millions of subjects, uniting in his own person all the powers of\r\nthe state, claiming to reign by divine commission, and profanely styling\r\nhimself the shadow of God--even he dares not venture to vary one iota\r\nfrom the teachings of the Koran and the Sunnah.\r\n\r\nSelim III was the first royal reformer. While Europe was shaken to its\r\nvery centre, and the continental monarchs trembled on their thrones, he\r\napplied himself assiduously to those civil and military reforms, which\r\nhis successors promoted, and without which Turkey could not have\r\nmaintained her position as a European power. Selim made a new\r\norganization of the army, made innovations in the judicial and\r\nadministrative branches of the government, changed the system of\r\ntaxation, and gave a decidedly new organization to the divan, where\r\nreform was most needed. He also attempted to make innovations in the\r\nfinancial department, but by depreciating the coin, in order to fill an\r\nexhausted treasury, signally failed. He deposed the then reigning\r\nhospodars of the Moldo-Wallachian provinces, and established others more\r\nfavorable to his work of reform. Russia and England remonstrated at this\r\nmeasure, and war was declared. The Turkish army was defeated and driven\r\nacross the Danube. The Janissaries, ignorantly attributing their defeat\r\nto Selim's reforms in military discipline, rose in rebellion. The\r\nwell-meant but too mild sultan fell a victim to their violence, and was\r\nsucceeded by Mustapha, who had instigated the insurgents to revolt. His\r\nshort reign is signalized by the vigorous measures he took to destroy\r\nSelim's reforms. Shortly after his accession to the throne, the defeat\r\nof the Turkish fleet by the Russians spread consternation and terror\r\nthrough the capital. It was at this critical juncture that an Asiatic\r\npasha, a friend of the deposed sultan, advanced with a powerful army,\r\nand laid siege to Constantinople, which yielded to him after a vigorous\r\nresistance of one year. Mahmoud ascended the throne. From Selim, his\r\ncousin, he had learned the lamentable condition of the empire and the\r\nnecessity of reform. He had no sooner ascended the throne, than the\r\nJanissaries began to manifest a feverish anxiety for revolt. No time was\r\nto be lost; and Mahmoud acted with that energy which was one of the few\r\nredeeming traits of his character. Mustapha, the murderer of Selim and\r\nthe destroyer of the work of a lifetime, was put to death; his son and\r\nwives shared his fate. Mahmoud was now firmly established. He was the\r\nlast scion of the Othman race, and as such was vested with _sacrosancta\r\npotestas_. He resolved to annihilate the unruly corps and anathematize\r\ntheir name. He engaged the services of their aga, or commander-in-chief,\r\nto whom he made known his plans. His next step was to issue an order\r\ncommanding each regiment to furnish one hundred and fifty men to be\r\ndrilled after the manner of European soldiers. The friends of Mahmoud\r\nasked: 'Is he mad?' The soldiers exclaimed: 'Bismillah! he wants to make\r\ninfidels of us. Does he think we are no better than infidel dogs?' The\r\nJanissaries reversed their kettles (the signal of revolt) in the\r\nByzantine hippodrome, and calling upon their patron saint, proceeded to\r\nattack the royal palace. But Mahmoud was prepared to receive them. All\r\nhis other troops, artillery, marines, and infantry, were under arms and\r\nat his command. The ulemas pronounced a curse of eternal dissolution\r\nupon the insurgents. Mahmoud unfurled the sacred standard of the\r\nprophet, and called on his people for assistance. A hundred cannon\r\nopened fire upon their barracks, and in an hour twenty-five thousand\r\nJanissaries were mowed down by grapeshot and scimitars. Their bodies\r\nbroke the lingering fast of the hungry dogs, or were cast into the\r\nBosphorus, and hurried by its rapid currents into the Sea of Marmora.\r\nThe annihilation of the Janissaries took place in 1826.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that Mahmoud could have effected a salutary\r\nreform in the military system without resorting to extreme violence. He\r\nwas naturally of a cruel disposition, and was also deficient in prudence\r\nand moderation. He gave the Janissaries cause to revolt; he made\r\nfrivolous innovations in their long-cherished customs, by commanding\r\nthem to shave their beards and forbidding them to wear the turban, a\r\nbeautiful headdress, an ornament at once national and religious. These\r\nmeasures excited the disgust of all 'true believers,' while his enemies\r\ncalled him an infidel, and his warmest supporters and the strongest\r\nadvocates of reform despaired of success. Innovations are expedient only\r\nwhen they remove evil, and when men are prepared to receive them.\r\nCommand a Turk to shave his beard--by which he swears--the idol of his\r\nlife. As well bid him cut off his right arm or pluck out an eye--he\r\nwould obey one as soon as the other. The impolicy of changing the\r\ncustoms and dress of a half-civilized, warlike nation, has been made\r\nobvious in many instances--none more impressive than the mutiny of the\r\nAnglo-Indian army at Velore in 1806.\r\n\r\nMahmoud in destroying the Janissaries took for his model Peter the\r\nGreat. Never were two sovereigns more unlike each other. Peter, generous\r\nand humane, leaving his throne and travelling in disguise to educate\r\nhimself, stands in bold contrast with the parsimonious and cruel sultan.\r\nMoreover, Mahmoud's was a more difficult undertaking. The Strelitzes\r\nwhom the czar annihilated were unsupported, were famous by no\r\nillustrious victory, and had not an enthusiastic religious feeling. The\r\nJanissaries, on the other hand, had strong family interests; they, too,\r\nhad decided the fate of the empire at the battle of Varna, where their\r\nbravery established the Ottoman power, whose brightest triumphs were\r\nclustered around their names; they had fought many a bloody battle, and\r\nhad never turned their backs to the foe; their leader was chosen from\r\ntheir own ranks, and no nobility controlled their ambition or prevented\r\nthem from receiving the honor due to enterprise and valor; they held the\r\nsultan in check; the ulemas gave sanction to their laws, and they in\r\nturn sustained the authority of the ulemas with their swords. As long as\r\nthey experienced no change in their discipline and customs they were\r\ninvincible. But they too had participated in the universal degeneracy.\r\nLike the Prætorian bands of Rome, they had become the absolute masters\r\nof the empire. They pulled down and set up sultans at their will; their\r\nvalor had departed, but their unconquerable pride remained as part of\r\ntheir heritage. Their ranks were filled with crowds of Greeks, Jews, and\r\nMoslems, without discipline and without order. Many who had purchased\r\nthe privilege of being numbered in this formidable body, lived outside\r\nof the barracks, and assembled only on pay day or in times of tumult and\r\nrebellion. They despised all laws, civil and religious, and were a\r\nconstant source of annoyance to the people, whose lives and property\r\nwere at their mercy. Such were the subjects upon whom Mahmoud was to\r\noperate. In the destruction of the Strelitzes and the Janissaries, Peter\r\nand Mahmoud may be compared to two physicians: one practises on a\r\nhealthy savage, while the other attempts to cut out a malignant cancer\r\nreaching the vitals, from the pampered sensualist. In annihilating these\r\ntroops, as in his other reforms, Mahmoud began where he should have\r\nended his labors; he mistook the end for the means.\r\n\r\nHad he stopped with this act of violence, his supporters might defend\r\nhim on the doubtful ground of expediency; but he did not stop here. For\r\ncenturies the tyranny of the sultans had been restrained by the\r\nderebeys, or lords of the valleys. They had been confirmed in the\r\npossession of their lands by Mohammed II, from which time they had\r\ncontinued to pay tribute to the sultan, and furnished him with quotas of\r\ntroops. The sultan had no control over their lives or property. The\r\nsubjects who tilled the productive lands of the valleys were suitably\r\nrewarded for their labor. The happiest and wealthiest peasants of the\r\nempire were found among the vassals of the beys, to whom they showed\r\ngreat devotion. These feudal lords, at a moment's warning, could summon\r\ntwenty thousand men before their palace gates. They furnished the\r\ngreater part of the sultan's cavalry force in war; and, unlike the\r\npashas, had never raised the standard of rebellion; they had never\r\nwished for revolutions, and had never sanctioned insurrections. The\r\npossession of their property was guaranteed to them by inheritance, and\r\nthey had no need of money with which to bribe the Sublime Porte.\r\n\r\nMahmoud was bent on depriving them of their wealth and curtailing their\r\nprivileges. They were rich, did not bribe him, and held hereditary\r\npossessions. These were unpardonable crimes in the sight of this\r\nexemplary reformer. The beys, who never dealt in treachery, were\r\nunsuspicious of others, and fell an easy prey. The peasants ceased to\r\ncultivate the lands from which they could no longer profit; and many of\r\nthe wealthiest possessions became desolate. We must not think it\r\nstrange, therefore, that the military power was prostrated, when, after\r\nhaving annihilated the Janissaries, Mahmoud deprived the derebeys of\r\ntheir ancient authority; for the military power of the empire rested\r\nchiefly in these two bodies. These innovations were made in the midst of\r\na destructive Greek war, and at a time when the Danube and the Balkan\r\nwere no longer formidable barriers to the Muscovite descendants of Ivan\r\nthe Terrible, who brought back memories of the past, and threatened to\r\navenge deeply treasured wrongs. Even at this critical period, when his\r\narmy was annihilated, his fleet defeated, and the legions of Russia\r\nwithin a few days' march of Constantinople, Mahmoud threatened to feed\r\nhis horses at the high altar of St. Peter's, and proclaim the religion\r\nof the prophet in the Muscovite capital. A threat that savored more of\r\nthe seraglio than of the throne!\r\n\r\nHis next step was to assail the privileges of the great provincial\r\ncities, the inhabitants of which elected from their own number ayans, or\r\nmagistrates, distinguished for their wisdom and virtue. These\r\nmagistrates had much influence among the people; they had always\r\nresisted exorbitant taxes and unjust decrees; their protection was\r\nextended to Mussulmans and Christians without distinction. Their power\r\nof veto was almost as effective as that of the _tribuni plebis_ of Rome;\r\nthey could point back to Solyman, the Solon of his time, as the author\r\nof their protective system. But their power originated with the people.\r\nTo this Mahmoud would not submit. All power must emanate from him, the\r\nall-wise and innovating sultan, who raised the low and humbled the\r\ngreat, not as they were honest or corrupt, but as they fawned upon him,\r\nor refused to yield implicit obedience to his nod.\r\n\r\nIn their endeavors to institute a new financial system, the predecessors\r\nof Mahmoud reduced the standard of money gradually, in order not to\r\nproduce a panic. But he wished to accomplish in one day the work of\r\nyears. He issued a decree commanding the people to bring all their coin,\r\ngold and silver, to their respective governors--where they would receive\r\nless than half its value! He threatened the refractory with death. The\r\ncapital resounded with the dreaded cry of rebellion; and the exasperated\r\nmultitude that had surrounded the royal palace was not appeased until it\r\nwitnessed the public execution of the mint officers, whose only crime\r\nwas obedience to their master. This impolitic measure in the financial\r\ndepartment impoverished the people, and left the treasury still empty.\r\nForeign speculators bought the money--the circulation of which had\r\nbecome illegal--and resold it to the sultan for sterling value!\r\n\r\nShortly after this he expelled about thirty thousand Christians from the\r\ncapital, which they had embellished and enriched by their labor. Their\r\nfidelity had never been doubted. For this despicable act--their\r\nexpulsion--Mahmoud could adduce no better reason than that 'it was\r\nsolely on political grounds.' Strange politics this, for a sovereign,\r\nwho professed to have the magnanimity of Christian rulers! On the\r\nexpulsion of the Christians, Russia commenced hostilities, and a war\r\nfollowed, in which the sultan paid dearly for his rashness.\r\n\r\nIn short, Mahmoud could not have given a better lesson to his subjects\r\nthan by reforming himself. He was cruel beyond measure--if the grand\r\nseignior can ever be so called, who is taught that he may lop off a\r\nscore of heads each day 'for divine inspiration.' Still if he had been\r\nas thoroughly skilled as he professed to have been, he should have shown\r\nhimself a humane as well as an innovating sovereign. Those who assisted\r\nhim in his reforms, he rewarded with the bowstring. His character was\r\nblackened by ingratitude, an instinctive vice in oriental rulers.\r\nObstinate as he was suspicious, deceitful as he was cunning, he could\r\nnot rule his own passions, much less could he control the corrupt morals\r\nof his people. He was to an extraordinary degree avaricious, a quality\r\neverywhere odious, but especially in a land where generosity measures\r\nlove--where in the highest and in the lowest stations liberality is the\r\nmoving spring. While he mistook parsimony for economy, he did not\r\nscruple to make war on trifling pretexts and waste his amassed treasures\r\nin a hopeless cause.\r\n\r\nIn every attempted reform he wounded Ottoman pride and prejudice. Unlike\r\nhis cousin, he did not humor the faults of the people while making\r\ninnovations; he neither amused them with imposing shows, nor flattered\r\nthem by the pompous spectacle of his appearance in public--in one word,\r\nhe wanted the tact of a reformer. Selim, while he increased the navy and\r\nestablished manufactories, built gorgeous palaces, and by his\r\nmagnificence dazzled the people, who were blind to his real designs;\r\nthey even permitted him to set up printing presses in the large cities,\r\non receiving assurance that the Koran would not be submitted to the\r\nunholy process of squeezing!\r\n\r\nMahmoud thought, or pretended to think, that he could reform the empire\r\nby imitating only the vices of Christianity, and manifesting a contempt\r\nfor Moslem virtues. While he drank wine--and in many other breaches of\r\nthe teachings of the sacred book provoked the faithful--his\r\nproclamations breathed a most orthodox and fanatical spirit. He was a\r\nsceptic; neither Mussulman nor Christian, but surprisingly inconsistent\r\nand capricious. His, we fear, were 'hangman's hands,' and 'not ordained\r\nto build a temple unto peace.'\r\n\r\nUnder Solyman the Magnificent, at once the most warlike monarch and\r\nmunificent patron of literature and art, the constitution of the\r\nJanissaries was wise and effective. The children of Christians, taken by\r\nthe Turks in war or in their predatory incursions, were exposed in the\r\npublic markets of Constantinople, whence any person was at liberty to\r\ntake them into his service, on making a contract with the government to\r\nreturn them at the demand of the sultan. These children were instructed\r\nin Islamism, and were trained by manly exercise and labor, calculated to\r\nstrengthen the body and give elasticity to the spirits. From these hardy\r\norphans the ranks of the Janissaries were recruited. They came eagerly\r\nto the camp; for they had been taught to regard it as the theatre of\r\ntheir future glory. From earliest infancy they looked forward with joy\r\nto the time when they should be numbered among those brave soldiers,\r\nwhose arms had maintained for a long series of years the supremacy of\r\nthe crescent. There was no rank, no dignity in the Turkish army to which\r\na Janissary could not aspire--a strong incentive to the display of\r\nbravery. Such was the constitution of the army when it was the most\r\npowerful in Europe: then it gained its victories, not by force of\r\nnumbers, but by superior military discipline and valor. In the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century the capture of Christian children was abandoned.\r\nThe land forces degenerated into a wretchedly organized army of less\r\nthan three hundred thousand men, drafted from the lowest classes.\r\nMothers put their children to death that they might be spared the pangs\r\nof seeing them torn away to pass their days in scenes of shame and\r\ndissipation.\r\n\r\nNot till the army had become a laughing stock to the weakest European\r\npower did the sultans perceive the necessity of military reform. Selim\r\nIII established a school for artillery and naval officers, and engaged\r\nEuropeans, especially Frenchmen, as instructors in military science. We\r\ncan readily comprehend the degeneracy of the Turkish army, when we\r\nremember that since the establishment of the school at Sulitzi for\r\nengineers, the Turks have learned from foreign teachers military tactics\r\nof which their own ancestors were the inventors, and which had been\r\nforgotten, although full accounts of them lay hidden in musty volumes in\r\ntheir military archives.\r\n\r\nForeign officers were at first regarded with contempt by Turkish\r\nsoldiers, whose unconquerable pride has ever proved a great impediment\r\nto the regeneration of the empire. Moslem talent was not equal to the\r\nexigencies that arose from the impolitic measures of Mahmoud. We find a\r\nparallel case in Russia. Had Peter trusted to Muscovite genius to form\r\nand command the troops which superseded the Strelitzes, Charles XII\r\nwould have quartered in the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nKutchuk Husseyin, the relative and favorite of Selim, made valuable\r\nadditions to the navy in which his master took such pride. Husseyin, who\r\nhad the welfare of his country at heart, was liberal and disinterested.\r\nVested with the office of captain pasha, he sent to Greece for\r\narchitects and engineers, with whose assistance he fortified Stamboul,\r\nSinope, and Rhodes; he built arsenals and extensive docks, which he\r\nsupplied with the necessary equipments of a powerful fleet. In a short\r\ntime, twenty sail of the line, constructed on the newest European\r\nmodels, rode at anchor within sight of his palace. He also erected\r\nbarracks for the troops, and greatly improved the naval school. The\r\nsudden death of Selim paralyzed the navy, which soon resumed its\r\naccustomed languor.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1821, in which the Turkish fleet was defeated by armed\r\nmerchant vessels of Greece, gave a fresh impulse to the navy.\r\nExperienced officers were placed in command, who, as they grew in\r\nstrength, grew in confidence, and trusted more to their own resources\r\nthan to the protection of Allah. Six years after the defeat, the navy\r\nwas in a state of greater practical efficiency than at any other time.\r\nAfter a protracted struggle of five years it had gained the undisputed\r\nsupremacy of the Archipelago; and had it not been for the disastrous\r\ndefeat at Navarino, it would have proved equal, if not superior, to the\r\nRussian fleet in the Black sea. The Turkish navy, to-day, numbers about\r\nsixty war vessels, six of which are ships of the line, and six steam\r\nfrigates, built partly at London and Toulon.\r\n\r\nThe standing army in times of peace consists of 150,000 regulars; 60,000\r\nauxiliaries (such as the Egyptian forces); and those of the northern\r\nprovinces, 110,000; with a corps de reserve of 150,000--an aggregate of\r\n470,000 men. The army is recruited by lot and conscription (as in\r\nFrance), and not as formerly, by arbitrary compulsion. Christians are\r\nexcluded from service in the infidel ranks, but pay a military tax.\r\nPartial infringements, however, have been made in this exclusion, by\r\nemploying Armenians in the marine service and at the arsenals. Active\r\nservice in the army continues for a period of seven years; and the\r\ndischarged soldiers belong to the reserved force for five years more.\r\nThe organization of the corps de reserve is the same as that of the\r\nregular army. Their arms and equipments are kept in the state arsenals,\r\nand are produced only when the soldiers are called out, which takes\r\nplace once a year, after the harvest season. During one month, the\r\nmembers of this corps de reserve lead a military life, and receive\r\nregular pay.\r\n\r\nThe army is divided into six divisions of 25,000 each. The artillery is\r\nmodelled after the most approved Prussian system, while the infantry and\r\ncavalry drill according to French tactics, and use French accoutrements\r\nand arms. Thus, Turkey, with a standing army of 150,000 men, can muster\r\na force of nearly 500,000 at a few hours' notice; provided, however, she\r\nhas money to pay the troops, for the religious prejudices of the\r\nOsmanlee do not tolerate the system of loans. So that Turkey, though she\r\nhas neither the formidable land force of France nor the navy of England,\r\nis not crushed by the weight of a public debt, the principal of which\r\ncan never be paid. This military system is the result of the labors of\r\nRija Pasha and Redschid Pasha, by turn rivals and colleagues, disputing\r\non matters of secondary importance, but ever cordially cooperating in\r\nthe regeneration of the empire.\r\n\r\nMore attention has been given to military than to political reforms. The\r\nintolerant Moslem spirit manifests direct opposition to all innovation\r\nin the administration. As their fathers were, so they wish to be. Before\r\nthe time of Selim no reform movements of importance had been made in the\r\nadministrative branches. For five centuries the sultans had received, as\r\nan aphorism in their political education, that the subjects existed for\r\nthe good of the sultan, and not the sultan for the welfare of the\r\npeople. Selim proclaimed the rights of his subjects and their supremacy;\r\nand his words were confirmed by his deeds.\r\n\r\nThe administrative system was purely oriental, and bore scarcely any\r\nanalogy to that of any other country. From the reign of Solyman to that\r\nof Selim--the protector (from whom there is no appeal) was kept closely\r\nconfined in the seraglio walls; indeed, he was a state prisoner from his\r\ncradle to the day when he girt around him the imperial sabre. As the\r\nsultan reigned by divine commission, no education was considered good\r\nenough for him. Moreover, since his power was absolute, it had been\r\nreceived as a recognized principle of state policy that he should be as\r\nignorant as possible, in order that he might prove more faithful to the\r\nwill of Allah. Selim banished these antiquated notions, and instituted a\r\nnew system--not that he lessened his own power, but established\r\nrepresentative bodies to assist him in making laws, and tribunals to\r\npass judgment upon and execute them.\r\n\r\nThe sultan is assisted by a divan; or council of ministers, and others,\r\nwho are nominated to that dignity by himself. The grand vizier presides\r\nover this body, and is responsible for all measures adopted by it.\r\n\r\nThe legislative as well as the military system is borrowed from the\r\nFrench; but the sultan is the source of all law, civil and military; he\r\nis the summit, while the municipal institutions are the base, of the\r\npolitical fabric. In theory at least, these institutions are established\r\non the broadest principles of freedom. Each community, like the communes\r\nof France, sends an aga, or representative, to the supreme council. By\r\nthe famous ordinance of Gulhana, Mussulmans, Jews, and Christians are\r\nrepresented, without distinction, in proportion to their number.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the interior belongs to the prime minister, who\r\nappoints civil governors to take charge of the general administration.\r\nThe pashas had hitherto been both civil and military officers; purchased\r\ntheir appointments at extravagant prices, and repaid themselves by\r\nextortions practised upon the unfortunate subjects over whom they ruled.\r\nThe appointment of civil governors removed this old abuse, and left the\r\npashas vested only with military power. Each of the military chiefs has\r\ncommand of one of the six divisions of which the army is composed. All\r\nthese officers receive a fixed salary; and the people, no longer subject\r\nto their avarice and tyranny, pay regular rates of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe reforms I have mentioned, great as they were, were only preliminary\r\nto the publishing of the hatti-scheriff of Gulhana, the magna charta and\r\nbill of rights of Turkey. The son of Mahmoud, Abdul Medjid, on ascending\r\nthe throne, published this ordinance, which was to effect a reform in\r\nthe internal administration more beneficial than any other, either\r\nbefore or after the destruction of the Janissaries. The ulemas, state\r\nofficers, foreign ambassadors, and a vast multitude of subjects had\r\nassembled on the plains of Gulhana. The illustrious writings (as the\r\nname signifies) were read aloud in the presence of this solemn assembly\r\nby Redschid Pasha. The sultan, 'under the direct inspiration of the Most\r\nHigh and of his prophet,' desired to look for the prosperity of the\r\nempire in a good administration. The ulemas addressed a thanksgiving to\r\nheaven amid the acclamations of the assembled thousands. These reforms\r\nwere threefold: The first guaranteed security to life, honor, and\r\nproperty; the second is a new system of taxation; the third, a\r\nremodelled plan for levying soldiers, and defining their time of\r\nservice. The subject can best be illustrated by quoting a few extracts\r\nfrom the hatti-scheriff itself:\r\n\r\n     'The cause of every accused person shall be adjudged publicly, in\r\n     conformity to our divine law, after due inquiry and investigation;\r\n     and as long as sentence shall not have been regularly pronounced,\r\n     no one shall, either publicly or privately, cause another to perish\r\n     by prison or any other deadly means.'\r\n\r\n     'It shall not be permitted to any one to injure another,\r\n     _whosoever_ he may be.'\r\n\r\n     'Every man shall possess his own property, and shall dispose of it\r\n     with the most entire liberty. Thus, for example, the innocent heirs\r\n     of a criminal shall not be deprived of their legal rights, and the\r\n     goods of the criminal shall not be confiscated.'\r\n\r\n     'The imperial concessions extend to _all_ subjects, whatever may be\r\n     their religion or sect; they shall reap the benefit of them without\r\n     exception.'\r\n\r\n     'As to the other points, since they must be regulated by the\r\n     concourse of enlightened opinion, our council of justice, with whom\r\n     shall assemble, on certain days to be fixed by us, the notables of\r\n     the land, shall meet together to lay down guiding laws on the\r\n     points that affect the security of life, honor, and fortune, and\r\n     the assessment of imposts.'\r\n\r\n     'As soon as a law shall be defined, in order to render it valid and\r\n     binding, it shall be laid before us to receive our sanction, which\r\n     we Will write with our imperial hand.'\r\n\r\n     'As these present institutions have no other object than to give\r\n     fresh life and vigor to religion, the government, the nation, and\r\n     the empire, we pledge ourselves to do nothing to counteract them.\r\n     Whoever of the ulemas or chief men of the empire, or any other sort\r\n     of person, shall violate these institutions, shall undergo the\r\n     punishment awarded to his offence, without respect to his rank, or\r\n     personal consideration and credit.'\r\n\r\n     'As all the functionaries of the government receive at the present\r\n     day suitable salaries, and as those that are not sufficient shall\r\n     be increased, a vigorous law shall be enacted against traffic in\r\n     posts and favors, which the divine law reprobates, and which is one\r\n     of the principal causes of the decline of the empire.'\r\n\r\nAs a pledge of his promise, the sultan, after having deposited the\r\ndocuments in the hall that contains the 'glorious mantle' of the\r\nprophet, in the presence of the ulemas and chief men, swore to them in\r\nthe name of God, and administered the same oath to the priests and\r\nofficers. The hatti-scheriff was published in every part of the empire,\r\nand was well received, except by a few of the retrograde party, who\r\nlived by the old abuses, and vigorously resisted all attempts at\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\nBy this ordinance, the sources of the revenue consist of the frontier\r\ncustoms, the tithes, and a property tax. In two of these three sources\r\nof revenue there are great abuses. In collecting the taxes, the tax\r\ngatherers make exhorbitant demands, for which (owing to the partiality\r\nof justice) there is no redress, The salguin, or land tax, is also the\r\ncause of constant complaint. It presses equally upon the richest and the\r\npoorest provinces; in consequence of which many of the most fertile\r\ndistricts have been deserted. The government is not ignorant of these\r\nfacts. Abdul Medjid, a short time previous to his death, ordered a new\r\nregistration of property to be made, which will, in a great measure,\r\nremedy this evil. This new registration caused not a little astonishment\r\nand fear among the peasants, who could not approve of persons taking an\r\ninventory of their property and their flocks. We must not be surprised\r\nat this, for a parallel case is close at hand. When the Emperor Joseph\r\nendeavored to introduce the mode of distinguishing houses in the\r\nprincipal streets of _Vienna_, by numbers instead of the antiquated mode\r\nby printed signs, the people were impressed with the idea that the\r\nnumbers were affixed for the purpose of more conveniently collecting a\r\nnew house tax!\r\n\r\nThe new system of farming the revenue proved especially beneficial to\r\nthe Christians. Under the old regime the Turks had been greatly favored.\r\nThe poll tax formerly levied on all who were not professed followers of\r\nthe prophet, has been abolished.\r\n\r\nThe empire is wealthy--immensely wealthy; but the money is in the hands\r\nof the few. If we except the province of Servia, feudal lords, and tax\r\ncollectors, the whole Turkish population consists of peasants, who till\r\nthe soil on an equality of wretchedness. Yet it is to these same\r\nsuffering peasants, the bone and sinew of the land, that reformers must\r\nlook for support. It was the peasantry of Servia, headed by George the\r\nBlack, that in 1800-1812, rose in rebellion, and whose success infused\r\nlife and vigor into the more passive provinces. They, too, were\r\npeasants--those brave and resolute men who expelled from the provinces\r\nthe robber princes, and almost gained a national existence. Many of\r\nthese same peasants, men in whose breasts still lingered the valor that\r\nmade their ancestors famous, joined the Grecian army in the successful\r\nstruggle for independence; even Moslem peasants left their ploughs in\r\nthe furrow and their herds unattended, to join the insurgents, to whose\r\nsuccess they greatly contributed. The heroes of all Turkish rebellions\r\nhave been peasants--the men of strong arms and unswerving energy. They\r\nare naturally of a passive disposition, but when once roused to action\r\nby religion or patriotism, they are as firm and unyielding in their\r\npurpose as their own\r\n\r\n                       'Pontic sea,\r\n   Whose icy currents and compulsive course\r\n   Ne'er feels returning ebb, but keeps due on\r\n   To the Propontic and the Hellespont.'\r\n\r\nIn the hands of the peasantry lies the destiny of the empire, its\r\nregeneration or its fall. By ameliorating their condition and gaining\r\ntheir good will, the sultans cannot fail to succeed in their reforms. By\r\nworking in opposition to them and exciting their enmity, success is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe social system introduced by the victorious Othmans among the\r\nconquered nations was not as oppressive as is generally believed. The\r\nTurks, unlike the Germanic nations, the Huns and Normans, did not take\r\nforcible possession of private property and divide it among their\r\nconquering hordes. From those who acknowledged themselves subject to\r\ntheir rule, the Turks exacted tribute, but protected their liberties and\r\npolitical institutions. The conquerors introduced their laws into the\r\ncountry, but not forcibly. To those who still adhered to the Christian\r\nreligion, they extended the rights of self-government, subject, however,\r\nto a military tax. This was very far from degrading the cultivators of\r\nthe soil to servitude; this did not deprive them of their possessions,\r\ninherited or purchased. But by a gradual change in the government this\r\ncivil equality and liberty in the possession of property was superseded\r\nby an aristocratic and almost absolute despotism. The Ottomans came in\r\ncontact with a people ruling under Byzantine law, of which (as of the\r\nfeudal system) they had but a confused knowledge. The feudal system\r\nhaving taken root in Greece, and having been already introduced into\r\nAlbania, had necessarily much influence on the contiguous provinces of\r\nMoldavia and Wallachia, Servia and Bulgaria. Here the Greek emperors,\r\nwith correct notions of right and wrong, had governed wisely and justly\r\nin a simple administration, which gave place to a complicated system of\r\nlaws and refinements, as unintelligible as they were useless and\r\nineffective. In the double heritage of Greece and Rome, the conquerors\r\nimitated only their faults, moral and intellectual, and thus made more\r\nprominent the fall of the two countries. The Turks were not sufficiently\r\nenlightened to understand the laws and customs of the Greeks and Romans,\r\nand profit thereby; nor could they resist the charm thrown around\r\naristocracy and venality, but succumbed to their baneful influences. The\r\ndegeneracy of the laws caused the misery of the peasantry, and paralyzed\r\nthe energies of the empire. The pashas gained almost unlimited power,\r\nfounded on the ruins of civil liberty. They did not scruple to persecute\r\nthe suffering peasant, even in the sanctuary of his family--held in the\r\nhighest veneration by the Turk. The peasants in many instances had no\r\nother alternative than to fly to the mountains for safety, and lead a\r\nwretched existence by rapine and murder. Some left Turkey to settle in\r\nRussia and Austria, in search of that liberty and protection which was\r\ndenied them at home.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish peasants are not insensible to the degradation in which they\r\nare languishing. But accustomed, in suffering and privation, to find\r\nconsolation in fatalism--which teaches implicit acquiescence in and\r\nobedience to the will of Allah--they drag out their days in passive\r\nsubmission. Seditions are almost always excited by unbelievers, who feel\r\ntheir wrongs more deeply. The devout Turkish peasant seeks no better\r\nfortune than the means wherewith to build a little cabin, with windows\r\nand doors religiously closed to vulgar eyes. He finds comfort in the\r\nwords of his holy book: 'He is the happiest of mortals to whom God has\r\ngiven contentment.' He performs his daily labor, makes his prostrations,\r\nsmokes his chibouk, and lives oblivious of care. He is far from being\r\nindifferent to reforms, but is loth to take the initiative in political\r\ninnovations and social wars. His heart is with the cause, but here also\r\nhe is resigned: 'God is great--His will be done.' This same spirit of\r\nresignation and submission to the divine will, from being a virtue\r\nbecomes his greatest curse.\r\n\r\nThe Servians, a hardy and vigorous race, who pride themselves on their\r\nvictories over the Moslems, stand in the van of the reform movement. By\r\nthe new constitution given to Servia in 1838, there exists no longer any\r\ndistinction of classes. All pay taxes, in proportion to the value of\r\ntheir property, to the municipal and general government. All the\r\npeasants are proprietors, and all the proprietors are peasants. The\r\nServians and Albanians have never refused foreign aid. They gave a kind\r\nwelcome to the legions that Nicholas sent across the Pruth, and worked\r\nin concert with the brave warriors of the north, in the hope of gaining\r\na nationality and a recognized name.\r\n\r\nThe moral condition of the Bulgarians does not differ essentially from\r\nthat of the Servians; but there is a wide difference in their political\r\norganization. The Bulgarians are yet only peasants, unprotected against\r\nthe violence and exactions of the sultan. They are more enterprising\r\nthan the Servians, and, could they enjoy an equitable legislation, would\r\nsoon vie with them in wealth and prosperity. They envy the national and\r\ndemocratic institutions of the Servians, who are related to them by\r\nblood, by religion, and a common tongue. They are eager for reforms,\r\nboth social and political, which shall give them a constitution similar\r\nto that of Servia. In this they must ultimately succeed. The two people\r\nare one in their sympathies: one cannot enjoy privileges without\r\nexciting the jealousy of the other. Unless concessions are made, the day\r\nis not far distant when the Bulgarians will revolt, as the Servians did\r\nunder Tzerny George, and gain the right of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe Illyrian peasants have not as promising a future. They are divided\r\namong themselves, both in politics and religion; the several clans and\r\nparties are engaged in ceaseless strife and bickering. On the most\r\ntrivial pretence a community will rise in arms and carry ruin and\r\ndesolation to its neighbor. The face of the country everywhere shows\r\nsigns of the terror under which it groans. In many districts the\r\nhumblest dwellings are fortified citadels, gloomy and threatening;\r\nobservatories are stationed in trees and on high cliffs, to guard\r\nagainst surprisals; the streets of the towns and villages are traversed\r\nby gloomy figures of athletic savage warriors, with fierce and sinister\r\nexpression of countenance, and their right hand resting on a belt\r\ngarnished with its brace of pistols. They are in such a deplorable state\r\nof ignorance, and so blinded by mutual hatred, that they are incapable\r\nof perceiving their wants and obtaining their rights by concerted\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe Servians and Bulgarians, although by nature not less warlike than\r\nthe Illyrians, are more pacific. This quality is, to a certain degree,\r\nattributable to a better government; but their great advantage consists\r\nin their being friends of labor. They are not divided by internal\r\nfactions; their pistols serve for ornaments, not offensive weapons;\r\ntheir rude exterior hides within a gentle, childlike nature. Though\r\nlaborious, they seek not to amass wealth; kind to each other, to\r\nstrangers they are hospitable and generous. They are extremely courteous\r\nand polite, and theirs is not the humility of the Austrian peasant, who\r\nkisses the scornful hand of his superior; it is the deference and\r\nrespect that youth bears to age, or the attention which the host gives\r\nto a welcome guest.\r\n\r\nIn Servia and Bulgaria, Christianity has gained the ascendancy; the\r\nlight of the gospel imparts comfort and happiness to all; but the\r\nIllyrians, through a blind zeal in their social dissensions, have\r\ndebarred themselves from its vivifying and soothing influence.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the last century, the peasants of the\r\nMoldo-Wallachian provinces were enfranchised, but have not yet obtained\r\nthe right of property legislation. Being contiguous to Poland and\r\nHungary, their attention is naturally called to all the noise of reform\r\nand to all the social questions that agitate the two countries. Unless\r\nconcessions are made, unless the peasant is recognized as proprietor of\r\nthe soil of which to-day he is but the farmer, a revolution will take\r\nplace, in which the Sublime Porte will lose these provinces as\r\neffectually as it did the pashalies. It is not absolutely necessary,\r\nthough it would be judicious, to give Moldavia and Wallachia the same\r\npolitical organization as Servia enjoys. The question now, is not of\r\nrulers, whether they shall be sent from the divan or chosen from the\r\npeople; but is of property legislation and municipal institutions.\r\n\r\nIn all his reforms, the sultan should remember that the material upon\r\nwhich he is to operate lies in the peasantry.\r\n\r\nThe empire, however, cannot be thoroughly reformed merely by\r\nenfranchising the peasants, by introducing European customs, by\r\norganizing new armies, building barracks, and establishing custom\r\nhouses. These improvements are the sign of a vigorous national impulse\r\nand prosperity; they are the result, not the rudiments of civilization.\r\nThe fact that the sultan wears French boots and supplies his seraglio\r\nwith the latest Parisian modes signifies nothing.\r\n\r\nIn its palmy days, Turkey relied for success on its courage and love of\r\nmilitary glory; now its welfare and very existence depend upon the\r\npeaceful arts of civilized life. The prosperity of the people measures\r\nthe condition of the empire. But how can an ignorant people prosper? The\r\ntime has come when a reform in the educational system of Turkey is\r\nemphatically demanded. There must be intelligence among the people, and\r\neducated men in the cabinet as well as brave men in the field. The\r\ninnovating sultans of the last century have done much for the\r\nreconstruction of the broken political fabric of the empire; they have\r\norganized a new and powerful army and navy; they have facilitated\r\ncommercial intercourse, but have done scarcely anything for the\r\ndiffusion of knowledge among their subjects.\r\n\r\nAll the knowledge in the empire is concentrated in the ulemas and\r\nlawyers. The members of the Sublime Porte and other state officers, with\r\nbut few exceptions, are unlettered men, who owe their elevation, to\r\npartiality or bribery. Under Mahmoud, beauty of person was the best\r\nrecommendation to favor and promotion!\r\n\r\nBut Turkey has had her golden age of letters as well as her age of\r\nmilitary glory. Her libraries and archives are filled with unread, musty\r\nmanuscripts, comprising treatises on philosophy and metaphysics,\r\nhistories, biographies, and poems, rich in the classic erudition of the\r\nOrient. In 1336, Sultan Orkan found leisure from war and conquest to\r\nestablish, at Brusa, a literary institution, which became so famous for\r\nits learning, that Persians and Arabians did not disdain to avail\r\nthemselves of its instruction. But with the death of its founder its\r\nglory passed away. It was no longer the fountain head of learning in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, forgetful of the fact that antiquity is the youth of the\r\nworld, still follow Aristotle as their guide in philosophy and\r\nmetaphysics, and Ptolemy in geography! Missionaries have succeeded in\r\nintroducing modern text books into some of the schools, but owing to the\r\npeculiar system of Turkish education, the result has not been so\r\nfavorable as was anticipated.\r\n\r\nTo each mosque is attached a school, where the pupils devote several\r\nyears in acquiring the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic;\r\nwhich completes their education. But few foreign instructors are\r\nemployed to teach in the schools, because the government is unwilling to\r\npay a suitable salary. While on state officers wealth is lavished with\r\nthe prodigality of oriental munificence, instructors receive only a\r\nnominal recompense, often not exceeding six cents a day!\r\n\r\nA few favored youths receive a European education, especially in French\r\nand Austrian colleges. The oriental academy, established at Vienna by\r\nMaria Theresa for the education of diplomatists to conduct intercourse\r\nwith the Porte, has formed many illustrious Turkish scholars. It is a\r\nsingular but not unpleasant commentary on the vicissitudes of fortune,\r\nthat Turkey should send her sons to be educated at Vienna, which only\r\ntwo centuries ago a sultan besieged at the head of an army of two\r\nhundred thousand men, and before whose gates he was defeated by the\r\ncombined Christian forces, who recovered eighty thousand Christian\r\ncaptives, among whom were fourteen thousand maidens, and fifty thousand\r\nchildren of both sexes!\r\n\r\nThe Christian subjects of the empire have made visible progress in their\r\neducational system, although it is yet in a very imperfect state. In the\r\nmiddle of the last century a body of Armenian monks formed a society for\r\npromoting the educational interests of their countrymen. These pious and\r\nbenevolent men dwell alone on the little island of San Lazzaro, and\r\npublish works on literature, science, and religion, which are\r\ndistributed among the Turkish Armenians.\r\n\r\nPrinting presses have lately been set up in the large cities, and books\r\nare rapidly multiplying. In Constantinople several newspapers are\r\nprinted in French, Turkish, and Arabic; they are read in every coffee\r\nhouse and barber shop, the common lounging places of the Ottoman, where\r\nhe smokes his pipe and discusses politics. Their columns are chiefly\r\ndevoted to the discussion of state affairs, and notices of public\r\nfunctionaries. The sultan is the virtual editor, and consequently the\r\npapers are popular, as containing opinions on state policy _ex\r\ncathedra_. These presses were established with the reluctant sanction of\r\nthe ulemas, and the vigorous opposition of the scribes, an influential\r\nbody, protesting against the introduction of machinery, which was to\r\nsupersede the use of their fingers.\r\n\r\nThe council of public instruction at Constantinople has established a\r\nmedical and polytechnic school; in both, French, English, and German\r\nteachers are employed. To the medical college is attached a botanical\r\ngarden and a natural history museum. The medical library consists\r\nchiefly of French works. The implements used to experiment in the\r\nphysical sciences were made at Paris, London, and Vienna, and are of the\r\nmost approved kind. The number of students in attendance, on an average,\r\nis seven hundred, comprising Turks, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews, all of\r\nwhom not only pay no tuition, but receive pecuniary assistance from the\r\ngovernment. As science cannot well be taught in Turkish, French is the\r\nlanguage of the school.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that Turkey, in her reform movement,\r\ncommenced this century, four hundred years behind Europe. When we\r\nconsider this, her advance in educational reformation appears in a\r\nbetter light. The present law makes it a penal offence in a Turkish\r\nparent not to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nThe universities, as well as the mosques and hospitals, are under the\r\ncontrol of the ulemas, who have always been a privileged and a\r\nsanctioned order, and by their sanctity and great wealth are rendered\r\nthe most formidable body in the empire. Selim and his successors\r\nsomewhat lessened their power. By the innovations of 1854 an important\r\nchange was effected in the vacoof, or church property. The church had\r\nhitherto held enormous possessions; and had not a check been placed on\r\nthe system, in the course of a few centuries all the lands would have\r\nbelonged to the priests. The property annexed to the mosques is held\r\nsacred by all, both high and low. True believers, Greeks, Armenians, and\r\nJews, alike, by a reversion of their property on failure of male issue,\r\ntransferred it to the ulemas. The decree above mentioned restricted this\r\nprivilege of the priests. The entire system will soon be abolished.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the ulemas have charge of the schools connected with\r\nthe principal mosques. The average number of scholars in each school, in\r\nthe reign of Mahmoud, was four hundred. They were, for the most part,\r\nworthless, indolent fellows, and entirely under the control of the\r\nulemas, who used them as tools, and made them figure conspicuously in\r\nall tumults and revolts. Their attempted assassination of Abdul Medjid\r\nwas their death warrant. Each ulema was restricted to four, in place of\r\nfour hundred scholars. This measure caused not a little ill feeling\r\namong those opposed to reform; but as the most successful attempt at\r\nrestricting the despotic power of the religious order, the decree was of\r\nvital importance, and gave the ulemas to understand that the power on\r\nthe throne was paramount to theirs.\r\n\r\nThe ulemas--whose functions do not differ materially from those of the\r\nold doctors of the law among the Hebrews--have always claimed and\r\nenjoyed both magisterial and ecclesiastical authority; and, indeed,\r\nsince the Mussulman's law and religion are convertible terms, we would\r\nexpect priests to be vested with the same powers, and performing the\r\nsame duties. Mohammed designed it should be so, and as long as war was\r\nwaged in the name of religion, as long as the Koran and the sword went\r\nhand in hand together, the two professions were not incompatible; but\r\nwhen Islamism had gained undisputed ascendency, there arose an obvious\r\ndiscrepancy between the peaceful adoration of Allah and the settlements\r\nof disputes between man and man. Priest and jurist, each had distinct\r\nand qualified duties to perform. Before justice can be administered\r\nproperly the religious and legal professions must be separated; the\r\nstatutes must be distinct from the Koran and Sunnah, in the obscurities\r\nof which they are at present involved. The sheik-ul-Islam (pontifex\r\nmaximus) is the head of the church and the bar; he appoints the bishops\r\nand the judges; and in his twofold character of minister and lawyer, he\r\nis the expounder of the Koran, the source of all laws, civil and\r\nreligious; his decisions serve as precedents, and are as\r\nincontrovertible as the Koran itself.\r\n\r\nBy the late reforms, Christian testimony is admitted in courts of\r\njustice. But this is merely a nominal privilege; for what avails it that\r\nChristian evidence is received, if the Koran and Sunnah are to\r\nconstitute the law, and a Mussulman judge is to be the expounder? Is it\r\nnot evident that the 'true believer,' whether right or wrong, will be\r\nshielded by the strong arm of prejudice at the expense of the Christian?\r\nThe purity of Turkish justice may be understood from the following\r\nhumorous account given by Dr. Hamlin:\r\n\r\n     'I once had a case of law with a Turkish judge. It was tried nine\r\n     times, and each time decided against me. After the ninth trial, the\r\n     judge sent me word that if I gave him 9,000 piastres (about $800),\r\n     he would decide the case in my favor, for all the world knew that\r\n     justice was on my side!'\r\n\r\nI look, however, upon the religious toleration extended to Christians in\r\n1854 as the most important of all reforms; it is the keystone of the\r\narch. Christianity has been on a gradual increase in Turkey; and it may\r\nnot be deemed extravagant to hope that when a few generations shall have\r\npassed away, its supremacy will be acknowledged. As Constantine, finding\r\nthe Christian element predominant in the Roman empire, made the religion\r\nof Christ that of his people, so some Selim or Abdul Medjid, urged by a\r\npower behind the throne, and more potent than the throne itself, will\r\nsubstitute the Bible for the Koran!\r\n\r\nThe fall of Islamism does not imply the downfall of Turkish rule. The\r\none is religious, the other a civil power; the one may wane, the other\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nThe wars which brought the European powers in Turkish waters made a deep\r\nimpression upon the Turks, and convinced them that they had been rescued\r\nfrom annihilation by foreign arms. This led to an important measure,\r\nviz.: the promulgation of the imperial edict of 1850, which was\r\ntranslated into all the languages of the empire, and read in all the\r\nmosques and churches. Besides securing the freedom of conscience and the\r\nequality of rights, it grants the right of apostasy, which had hitherto\r\nbeen a capital offence: 'As all forms of religious worship are and shall\r\nbe freely professed in the empire, no person shall be hindered in the\r\npractice of the religion which he professes; nor shall he in any way be\r\nannoyed in this kind: in the matter of a man _changing_ his religion,\r\nand _joining_ another, no force shall be applied to him.' The decree\r\nbore directly upon Islamism. Turks, both private and official, now\r\ndiscuss freely the doctrines of the New Testament. The Bible, to-day, is\r\nwidely circulated among the Turks. About seven thousand copies are sold\r\nannually to Mohammedans, while ten years ago they would not have been\r\naccepted as gifts. By all classes of people the Bible is purchased,\r\nread, and made the subject of discussion. The sultan himself reads it.\r\nDiscussion leads to investigation, and investigation to the\r\nestablishment of truth. This is one of the causes that have been\r\nsilently at work, destined to effect the fall of Islamism.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the empire, the Christian element is growing stronger\r\nand stronger; the Mohammedan weaker. Even in Asia, the chosen abode of\r\nthe faithful, we find Christian cities and villages prosperous, and\r\nMohammedan cities falling to decay. In another century the Sublime Porte\r\nwill depend chiefly on the Christian element for its influence. To-day,\r\nthe Mussulman mosque, the pagoda of the Hindoo, the fire temple of the\r\nParsee, the Roman and Greek churches, meet together.\r\n\r\nThe adoration and prostrations of the Turk afford an imposing sight even\r\nto the Christian. 'Praises be to God, for He is great,' resounds at\r\nsunrise and at sunset, from ship to ship at sea, from kiosk to minaret\r\non land.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Koran, there is a paradise for all true believers. This\r\nparadise, Al Janat, signifies a pleasure garden, from which flows a\r\nriver, the river of life, whose water is clear as crystal, cold as snow,\r\nand sweet as nectar. The believer who takes a draught shall thirst no\r\nmore. Even the oriental imagination fails to describe the glories of\r\nthis paradise--its fountains and flowers, pearls and gems, nectar and\r\nambrosia, all in unmeasured profusion. To crown the enchantment of the\r\nplace, to each faithful Moslem is allotted seventy-two houris,\r\nresplendent beings, free from every human defect, perpetually renewing\r\ntheir youth and beauty. Such is the Mohammedan conception of the future\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, in common with other Mohammedans, believe in angels, and in\r\nthe prophets Adam, Noah, Moses, and _Jesus_. One might suppose that such\r\na belief would assist missionaries in converting the infidel; but far\r\nfrom assisting, its tendency is to make more difficult the inculcation\r\nof Christian doctrines. When asked to accept the religion of Christ, the\r\nTurk's ready answer is: 'We believe in Jesus! we believe in him already;\r\nyou know only a part of the true faith; Mohammed has superseded Jesus.'\r\nNotwithstanding this, many Turks in Europe and Asia believe that in a\r\nlong series of years, Jesus will return to earth, reanimate their faith\r\nand ancient valor, and with one unbroken religion, give them dominion to\r\nthe end of the world. They, in short, expect Jesus--the same Jesus whom\r\nChristians worship--in the fullness of time to accomplish the work which\r\ntheir prophet only began. Christian missionaries should avail themselves\r\nof this remarkable belief, and turn it to the spiritual advantage of\r\nthose who entertain it.\r\n\r\n     'Let the Turkish Government remain, if by her standing Islamism may\r\n     fall! that we may carry back a purer literature to the land of\r\n     Homer, a purer law to the land of Moses, and the Gospel of Christ\r\n     to the land of the apostles.'\r\n\r\nIt only remains for me to say one word in regard to the now reigning\r\nsovereign. The ulemas--who have become what the Janissaries were, the\r\nhotbed of fanaticism--in their endeavors to overthrow the late sultan,\r\nAbdul Medjid, looked upon the present sultan as their champion. If he\r\npermits himself to become a tool in their hands, Turkey will lose\r\nduring his reign what she gained in a century. If, on the other hand, he\r\nhas the energy of Mahmoud, the humanity of Selim, and practises the\r\nconciliatory policy of his brother, a glorious future awaits the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE ESTIMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   As one, who under pay of priest or pope,\r\n   Painteth an altar picture boldly bad,\r\n   Yet winning worship from the common eye,\r\n   Is less than one, who faltering day by day\r\n   Before the untouched canvas, dreams, and feels\r\n   An unaccomplished greatness: so is he\r\n   Who scrapes the skies and cleaves the patient air\r\n   For rhyming ecstasies to cheat the crowd,\r\n   That sees not in the stiller worshipper\r\n   The truer genius, who, in heights lone lost,\r\n   Forgets to interpret to a lesser sense.\r\n\r\n   O there do dwell among us minds divine,\r\n   In which th' etherial is so subtly mixed,\r\n   That only matter in its outward mien\r\n   To the observer shows. Such ever live\r\n   Unto themselves alone, in sweet still lives,\r\n   And die by all men misinterpreted.\r\n\r\n   Within a churchyard rise two honored urns\r\n   O'er graves not far removed. The one records\r\n   The 'genius of a Poet,' whose fitter fame\r\n   Lies in the volumes which his facile pen\r\n   Filled with the measure of redundant verse:\r\n   Before this urn the oft frequented sod\r\n   Is flattened with the tread of pensive feet.\r\n   The other simply bears the name and age\r\n   Of one who was 'a Merchant,' and bequeathed\r\n   A fair estate with numerous charities:\r\n   Before this urn the grass grows rank and green.\r\n\r\n   I knew them both in life, and thus to me\r\n   They measured in their lives their effigies:\r\n   He who the pen did wield with facile power,\r\n   Created what he wrote, and to the ear\r\n   With tact, not inspiration, wrought the sounds\r\n   To careful cadence; but the heart was cold\r\n   As the chill marble where the sculptor traced\r\n   Curious conceits of fancy. Let him pass,\r\n   His name not undervalued, for his fame\r\n   Shall in maturer ages lie as still\r\n   As doth his neighbor's now.\r\n\r\n                              Turn we to him.\r\n   He was a man to whom the general eye\r\n   Bent with the confidence of daily trust\r\n   In things of daily use: a man 'of means,\r\n   --Sagacious, honest, plodding, punctual,--\r\n   Revolving in the rank of those whose shields\r\n   Bear bags of argent on a field of gold,\r\n   His life, to most men, was what most men's are,--\r\n   Unceasing calculation and keen thrift;\r\n   Unvarying as the ever-plying loom,\r\n   Which, moving in same limits day by day,\r\n   Weaves mesh on mesh, in tireless gain of goods.\r\n   But I, that knew him better than the herd,\r\n   Yet saw him less, knew that in him which lives\r\n   Still gracious and still plentiful to me\r\n   Now he hath passed away from me and them.\r\n   This man, whose talk on busy marts to men\r\n   Teemed with the current coin of thrifty trade,\r\n   --Exchanges, credits, money rates, and all,--\r\n   Hath stood with me upon a silent hill,\r\n   When the last flush of the dissolving day\r\n   Fainted before the moonlight, and, as 'twere\r\n   Unconscious of my listening, uttered there\r\n   The comprehensions of a soul true poised\r\n   With elemental beauty, giving tongue\r\n   Unto the dumbness of the blissful air.\r\n   So have I seen him, too, within his home,\r\n   When, newspaper on knee, his earnest gaze\r\n   Seemed scanning issues from the money list;\r\n   But comments came not, till my curious eye\r\n   Led out his meditation into words,\r\n   Thought-winding upward into sphery light,\r\n   So utterly unearthly and sublime,\r\n   That all the man of fact fled out of sense,\r\n   And visual refinement filled the space.\r\n   Oft hath he told me, nothing was so blind\r\n   As the far-seeing wisdom of the world,\r\n   And none within it knew him, save himself,\r\n   And that so scantily, that but for faith\r\n   In a redeeming knowledge yet to come,\r\n   He would lie down and let his weakness die\r\n   In self-reclaiming dust.\r\n\r\n                           After his death,\r\n   I searched his papers, vainly, for a scrap\r\n   Whereon some dropped memento might record\r\n   His inner nature; but he nothing left--\r\n   Nothing of that deep life whose wondrous light\r\n   Guided him onward through the realms of sense,\r\n   And in a world of practical self-need\r\n   Sustained him with a glory unexpressed.\r\n\r\n   And thus it is that round the Poet's urn,\r\n   The sod is beaten down with pensive feet:\r\n   And thus it is that where the Merchant lies,\r\n   The grass, untrodden, groweth rank and green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE HANDKERCHIEF.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had passed my last examinations, and had received my diploma\r\nauthorizing me to practise medicine, and I still lingered in the\r\nvicinity of Edinburgh, partly because my money was nearly exhausted, and\r\npartly from the very natural aversion I felt from quitting a place where\r\nthree very happy and useful years had been spent. After waiting many\r\nweeks--for the communication between the opposite shores of the Atlantic\r\nwere not then so rapid as now--I received a large packet of letters from\r\n'home,' all of them filled with congratulations on my success, and among\r\nthem were letters from my dear father and a beloved uncle, at whose\r\ninstance (he was himself a physician) my father had sent me abroad to\r\ncomplete my medical education. My father's letter was even more\r\naffectionate than usual, for he was highly gratified with my success,\r\nand he counselled me to take advantage of the peace secured by the\r\nbattle of Waterloo to visit the continent, which for many years (with\r\nthe exception of a brief period) had been closed to all persons from\r\nGreat Britain; he enclosed me a draft on a London banker for a thousand\r\npounds. My uncle's letter was scarcely less affectionate; my Latin\r\nthesis (I had sent my father and him a copy) had especially pleased him;\r\nand after urging me to take advantage of my father's kindness, he added\r\nthat he had placed a thousand pounds at my disposition, with the same\r\nLondon banker on whom my draft was drawn. A letter of introduction to a\r\nFrench family was enclosed in the letter, and he engaged me to visit\r\nthem, for they had been his guests for a long time when the first\r\nRevolution caused them to fly France, and they were under other\r\nobligations to him; which I afterward learned from themselves was a\r\npecuniary favor more than once renewed during their residence with him.\r\nTen thousand dollars was a good deal of money to be placed at the\r\ndisposition of a young man as his pocket money for eighteen months, even\r\nafter a large deduction had been made from it for a library and\r\nprofessional instruments.\r\n\r\nBefore I quitted Edinburgh, I received a letter from the gentleman to\r\nwhom my uncle had given me an introduction; he acquainted me that my\r\nuncle had informed him that I was about visiting France, and that he had\r\ntaken the liberty of introducing me to him. The Marquis de ---- (such\r\nwas his title--his name I omit for obvious reasons) expressed with\r\ngreat warmth his delight at having it in his power to exhibit the\r\ngratitude he felt to my uncle, and urged me with the most pressing terms\r\nto come at once to his home, and pass away there at least so much time\r\nas might accustom me to the _spoken_ French language (I could easily\r\nread it), that my visit to Paris might be more profitable and\r\nagreeable--and it should be both, he was so good as to say, at least as\r\nfar as it depended on himself and his friends. I wrote him by the return\r\nmail to thank him for his kindness, and to inform him that I should at\r\nonce set out for his hospitable home. I shall never forget the six\r\nmonths I passed away in the Chateau de Bardy: the happiness of those\r\ndays was checkered only by my departure and by the incident I shall\r\npresently relate. And even after I quitted that noble mansion, the\r\nkindness of its inmates still watched over me, and opened homes to me\r\neven in that great Maelstrom of life--Paris.\r\n\r\nIt was toward the end of the month of October--the most delightful month\r\nof the seasons in France--as I was returning on foot from Orleans to the\r\nChateau de Bardy, from a rather prolonged pedestrian exploration in that\r\ninteresting neighborhood, where I had accurately examined all of the\r\ncuriosities, thanks to an ample memoir of my noble host (in those days\r\n'Handbooks' were unknown, and Murray was busy publishing Byron and\r\nMoore), when I thought I caught a glimpse of some soldiers. I was not\r\nmistaken: on the road before me a Prussian regiment was marching. I\r\nquickened my pace to hear the military music, for I was extremely\r\npartial to it; but the band ceased playing, and no sound was heard\r\nexcept an occasional roll of the kettle-drum at long intervals to mark\r\nthe uniform step of the soldiers. After following them for a half hour,\r\nI saw the regiment enter a small plain, surrounded by a fir grove. I\r\nasked a captain, whose acquaintance I had made, if his men were about to\r\nbe drilled.\r\n\r\n'No,' said he, 'they are about to try, and perhaps to shoot, a soldier\r\nof my company for having stolen something from the house where he was\r\nbilleted.'\r\n\r\n'What,' said I, 'are they going to try, condemn, and execute him, all in\r\nthe same moment?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said he, 'those are the provisions of the capitulation.'\r\n\r\nThis word 'capitulation' was to him an unanswerable argument, as if\r\neverything had been provided for in the capitulation, the crime and the\r\npunishment, justice and humanity.\r\n\r\n'And if you have any curiosity to see it,' added the captain, 'I will\r\nplace you where you may see everything. It won't be long.'\r\n\r\nIt may be from my professional education, but the truth is, I have\r\nalways been fond of witnessing these melancholy spectacles; I persuade\r\nmyself that I shall discover the solution of the enigma--death--on the\r\nface of a man in full health, whose life is suddenly severed. I followed\r\nthe captain. The regiment was formed in a hollow square; in the rear of\r\nthe second rank and near the edge of the grove, some soldiers were\r\ndigging a grave. They were commanded by the third lieutenant, for in the\r\nregiment everything was done with order, and there is a certain form\r\nobserved even in the digging of a man's grave. In the centre of the\r\nhollow square eight officers were seated on drums; a ninth officer was\r\non their right, and some distance before them, negligently writing\r\nsomething, and using his knees as his desk; he was evidently filling up\r\nthe forms simply because it was against the 'regulations' that a man\r\nshould be killed without the usual forms. The accused was called up. He\r\nwas a tall, fine-looking young man, with a noble and gentle face. A\r\nwoman (the only witness in the cause) came up with him. But when the\r\ncolonel began the examination of the woman, the soldier stopped him,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n'It is useless asking her any questions. I am going to confess\r\neverything: I stole a handkerchief in that lady's house.\r\n\r\nTHE COLONEL. What! Piter! You have been stealing! We all thought _you_\r\nincapable of such a thing!\r\n\r\nPITER. It is true, Colonel, I have always tried to pass as an honest\r\nman, and a good fellow. Oh! I tell you, it wan't for me I stole the\r\nhandkerchief. 'Twas for Mary.\r\n\r\nTHE COLONEL. Who is Mary?\r\n\r\nPITER. Mary? Oh! she lives yonder.... at home.... just outside of\r\nAreneberg.... don't you remember the big apple-tree?.... Oh! I shall\r\nnever see her again....\r\n\r\nTHE COLONEL. I don't understand you, Piter; explain yourself.\r\n\r\nPITER. Why, Colonel.... but read this letter.\r\n\r\nHe gave the colonel a letter, which the latter read aloud, and every\r\nword of which was engraved on my mind, and still is as present to my\r\nmemory as though I heard them an hour ago. It was as follows:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR, DEAR PITER:--I take advantage of recruit Arnold's leaving, for\r\nhe has enlisted in your regiment, to send you this letter, and a silk\r\npurse I have made for you. Oh! I have hidden from father to work it, for\r\nhe is always scolding me for loving you so much, and is always telling\r\nme that you will never come back. But you will come back, won't you!\r\nEven if you never come back, I will always love you just the same. I\r\npromised myself to you the day you picked up my blue handkerchief at the\r\nAreneberg dance, and brought it to me. Oh! when shall I see you again?\r\nThe only pleasure I have is to hear that your officers esteem you, and\r\nyour comrades love you. Everybody says you are an honest man and a good\r\nfellow. But you have still two years to serve. Serve them quickly,\r\nbecause then we shall be married. Good-by, dear, dear Piter, and believe\r\nme, your own dear\r\n\r\n     MARY.\r\n\r\nP.S. Try to send me, too, something from France, not because I'm afraid\r\nI shall forget you, but I want something from you to carry always about\r\nme. Kiss what you send me. I know I shall find at once where you kissed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the colonel finished reading the letter, Piter said:\r\n\r\n'Arnold gave me this letter last night when I received my billet paper.\r\nFor my life's sake I could not sleep; I lay awake all night long,\r\nthinking of home and of Mary. She asked for something from France. I had\r\nno money. I drew three months' advance last week to send home to my\r\nbrother and my cousin. This morning, when I got up to go, I opened my\r\nwindow. A blue handkerchief was hanging on a clothes line; it looked\r\nlike Mary's; it was the same color, the same white lines; I was so weak\r\nas to take it, and put it in my knapsack. I went out into the street; I\r\nwas sorry for what I had done; I was going back to the house with it\r\njust when this lady ran after me. The handkerchief was found in my\r\nknapsack. This is all the truth. The capitulation orders me to be shot.\r\nShoot me, but don't despise me.'\r\n\r\nThe judges could not conceal their emotion; but when the balloting took\r\nplace, he was unanimously condemned to death. He heard his sentence with\r\nsang-froid; after it was passed on him, he went up to his captain and\r\nasked him to lend him four francs. The captain gave them to him. I then\r\nsaw Piter go to the woman to whom the blue handkerchief had been\r\nrestored, and I heard him say:\r\n\r\n'Madame, here are four francs; I don't know whether your handkerchief is\r\nworth more, but even if it is, I pay dear enough for it to engage you to\r\nknock off the rest.'\r\n\r\nTaking the handkerchief from her, he kissed it, and gave it to the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n'Captain,' said he, 'in two years you'll be returning home; when you go\r\ntoward Areneberg, ask for Mary; give her this blue handkerchief, but\r\ndon't tell her how dearly I purchased it.'\r\n\r\nPiter then kneeled and prayed fervently; when his prayers were ended, he\r\narose and walked with a firm step to the place of execution. I forgot\r\nthat I was a scientific man, and I walked down into the woods to avoid\r\nseeing the end of this cruel tragedy. A volley of musketry soon told me\r\nthat all was over.\r\n\r\nI returned to the fatal spot an hour afterward; the regiment had marched\r\naway; all was calm and silent. While following the edge of the grove,\r\ngoing to the highway, I perceived at a short distance before me traces\r\nof blood, and a mound of freshly heaped earth. I took a branch from one\r\nof the fir trees, and made a rude cross.\r\n\r\nI placed it at the head of poor Piter's grave, now forgotten by every\r\nbody except by me, and perhaps by Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nGold, next to iron, is the most widely diffused metal upon the surface\r\nof our globe. It occurs in granite, the oldest rock known to us, and in\r\nall the rocks derived from it; it is also found in the veinstones which\r\ntraverse other geological formations, but has never been found in any\r\nsecondary formation. It is, however, much more common in alluvial\r\ngrounds than among primitive and pyrogenous rocks. It is found\r\ndisseminated, under the form of spangles, in the silicious,\r\nargillaceous, and ferruginous sands of certain plains and rivers,\r\nespecially in their junction, at the season of low water, and after\r\nstorms and temporary floods. It is the only metal of a yellow color; it\r\nis readily crystallizable, and always assumes one or more of the\r\nsymmetrical shapes, such as the cube or regular octahedron. It affords a\r\nresplendent polish, and may be exposed to the atmosphere for any length\r\nof time, without suffering any change; it is remarkable for its beauty;\r\nis nineteen times heavier than water, and, next to platinum, the\r\nheaviest known substance; its malleability is such, that a cubic inch\r\nwill cover thirty-five hundred square feet; its ductility is such, that\r\na lump of the value of four hundred dollars could be drawn into a wire\r\nwhich would extend around the globe. It is first mentioned in Genesis\r\nii, 11. It was found in the country of Havilah, where the rivers\r\nEuphrates and Tigris unite and discharge their waters into the Persian\r\ngulf.\r\n\r\nThe relative value of gold to silver in the days of the patriarch\r\nAbraham was one to eight; at the period of B.C. 1000, it was one to\r\ntwelve; B.C. 500, it was one to thirteen; at the commencement of the\r\nChristian era, it was one to nine; A.D. 500, it was one to eighteen;\r\nA.D. 1100, it was one to eight; A.D. 1400, it was one to eleven; A.D.\r\n1613, it was one to thirteen; A.D. 1700, it was one to fifteen and a\r\nhalf; which latter ratio, with but slight variation, it has maintained\r\nto the present day. Gold was considered bullion in Palestine for a long\r\nperiod after silver had been current as money. The first mention of gold\r\nmoney in the Bible is in David's reign (B.C. 1056), when that king\r\npurchased the threshing floor of Oman for six hundred shekels of gold by\r\nweight. In the early period of Grecian history the quantity of the\r\nprecious metals increased but slowly; the circulating medium did not\r\nincrease in proportion with the quantity of bullion. In the earliest\r\ndays of Greece, the precious metals existed in great abundance in the\r\nLevant. Cabul and Little Thibet (B.C. 500) were abundant in gold. It\r\nseems to be a well ascertained fact, that it was obtained near the\r\nsurface; so that countries, which formerly yielded the metal in great\r\nabundance, are now entirely destitute of it. Croesus (B.C. 560) coined\r\nthe golden _stater_, which contained one hundred and thirty-three grains\r\nof pure metal. Darius, son of Hystaspes (B.C. 538), coined _darics_,\r\ncontaining one hundred and twenty-one grains of pure metal, which were\r\npreferred, for several ages throughout the East, for their fineness.\r\nNext to the _darics_ were some coins of the reigns of the tyrants of\r\nSicily: of Gelo (B.C. 491); of Hiero (B.C. 478); and of Dionysius (B.C,\r\n404). Specimens of the two former are still preserved in modern\r\ncabinets. _Darics_ are supposed to be mentioned in the latter books of\r\nthe Old Testament, under the name of _drams_. Very few specimens of the\r\n_daric_ have come down to us; their scarcity may he accounted for by the\r\nfact that they were melted down under the type of Alexander. Gold coin\r\nwas by no means plenty in Greece until Philip of Macedon had put the\r\nmines of Thrace into full operation, about B.C. 360. Gold was also\r\nobtained by the Greeks from Asia Minor, the adjacent islands, which\r\npossessed it in abundance, and from India, Arabia, Armenia, Colchis, and\r\nTroas. It was found mixed with the sands of the Pactolus and other\r\nrivers. There are only about a dozen Greek coins in existence, three of\r\nwhich are in the British Museum; and of the latter, two are _staters_,\r\nof the weight of one hundred and twenty-nine grains each. About B.C.\r\n207, gold coins were first struck off at Rome, and were denominated\r\n_aurei_, four specimens of which are in the institution before alluded\r\nto. Their weight was one hundred and twenty-one grains. Gold coins were\r\nfirst issued in France by Clovis, A.D. 489; about the same time they\r\nwere issued in Spain by Amalric, the Gothic king; in both kingdoms they\r\nwere called _trientes_. They were first issued in England A.D. 1257, in\r\nthe shape of a penny. Florins were next issued, in 1344, of the value of\r\nsix shillings. The guinea was first issued in 1663, of Guinea gold. In\r\n1733 all the gold coins--nobles, angels, rials, crowns, units, lions,\r\nexurgats, etc., etc., were called in and forbidden to circulate. The\r\npresent sovereign was first issued in 1817.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the Christian era to the discovery of America,\r\nthe amount of gold obtained from the surface and bowels of the earth is\r\nestimated to be thirty-eight hundred millions of dollars; from the date\r\nof the latter event to the close of 1842, an addition of twenty-eight\r\nhundred millions was obtained. The discovery and extensive working of\r\nthe Russian mines added, to the close of 1852, six hundred millions\r\nmore. The double discovery of the California mines in 1848, and of the\r\nAustralia mines in 1851 has added, to the present time, twenty-one\r\nhundred millions; making a grand total of ninety-three hundred millions\r\nof dollars. The average loss by wear and tear of coin is estimated to be\r\none-tenth of one per cent, per annum; and the loss by consumption in the\r\narts, by fire and shipwreck, at from one to three millions per annum.\r\n\r\nA cubic inch of gold is worth (at £3 17_s._ 10-1/2_d._, or $18.69 per\r\nounce) two hundred and ten dollars; a cubic foot, three hundred and\r\nsixty-two thousand eight hundred and eighty dollars; a cubic yard, nine\r\nmillions nine hundred and seventeen thousand seven hundred and sixty\r\ndollars. The amount of gold in existence, at the commencement of the\r\nChristian era, is estimated to be four hundred and twenty-seven millions\r\nof dollars; at the period of the discovery of America, it had diminished\r\nto fifty-seven millions; after the occurrence of that event, it\r\ngradually increased, and in 1600, it attained to one hundred and five\r\nmillions; in 1700, to three hundred and fifty-one millions; in 1800, to\r\neleven hundred and twenty-five millions; in 1843, to two thousand\r\nmillions; in 1853 to three thousand millions; and at the present time,\r\nthe amount of gold in existence is estimated to be forty-eight hundred\r\nmillions of dollars; which, welded into one mass, could be contained in\r\na cube of twenty-four feet. Of the amount now in existence, three\r\nthousand millions is estimated to be in coin and bullion, and the\r\nremainder in watches, jewelry, plate, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe Russian gold mines were discovered in 1819, and extend over one\r\nthird of the circumference of the globe, upon the parallel of 55° of\r\nnorth latitude. Their product, since their discovery to the present\r\ntime, has amounted to eight hundred millions of dollars. The California\r\ngold mines were discovered by William Marshall, on the ninth day of\r\nFebruary, 1848, at Sutter's Mill, upon the American Fork, a tributary of\r\nthe Sacramento, and extend from 34° to 49° of north latitude. Their\r\nproduct, since their discovery to the present time, has amounted to one\r\nthousand and forty-seven millions of dollars. The Australia gold mines\r\nwere discovered by Edward Hammond Hargraves, on the twelfth day of\r\nFebruary, 1851, in the Bathurst and Wellington districts, and extend\r\nfrom 30° to 38° of south latitude. Their product, since their discovery\r\nto the present time, has amounted to nine hundred and eleven millions of\r\ndollars. The finest gold is obtained at Ballurat, and the largest nugget\r\nyet obtained weighed twenty-two hundred and seventeen ounces, valued at\r\nforty-one thousand dollars. In shape it resembled a continent with a\r\npeninsula attached by a narrow isthmus. The annual product of gold at\r\nthe commencement of the Christian era is estimated at eight hundred\r\nthousand dollars; at the period of the discovery of America it had\r\ndiminished to one hundred thousand dollars; after the occurrence of that\r\nevent it gradually increased, and in 1600 it attained to two millions;\r\nand in 1700, to five millions; in 1800, to fifteen millions; in 1843, to\r\nthirty-four millions; in 1850, to eighty-eight millions; in 1852, to two\r\nhundred and thirty-six millions; but owing to the falling off of the\r\nCalifornia as well as the Australia mines, the product of the present\r\nyear will not probably exceed one hundred and ninety millions.\r\n\r\nSince 1792 to the present time, the gold coinage of the United States\r\nmint has amounted to seven hundred and forty millions of dollars, of\r\nwhich six hundred and fifty-five millions have been issued since 1850.\r\nThe gold coinage of the French mint, since 1726, has amounted to\r\neighty-seven hundred millions of francs, of which fifty-two hundred and\r\nfifty millions have been issued since 1850. The gold coinage of the\r\nBritish mint, since 1603, has amounted to two hundred and eighty\r\nmillions of pounds sterling; of which seventy-five millions have been\r\nissued since 1850. The gold coinage of the Russian mint, since 1664, has\r\namounted to five hundred and twenty-six millions of roubles, of which\r\ntwo hundred and sixty millions have been issued since 1850. The\r\nsovereign of England contains one hundred and twelve grains of pure\r\nmetal; the new doubloon of Spain, one hundred and fifteen; the half\r\neagle of the United States, one hundred and sixteen; the gold lion of\r\nthe Netherlands, and the double ounce of Sicily, one hundred and\r\nseventeen grains each; the ducat of Austria, one hundred and six; the\r\ntwenty-franc piece of France, ninety; and the half imperial of Russia,\r\nninety-one grains. A commissioner has been despatched by the United\r\nStates Government to England, France, and other countries of Europe, to\r\nconfer with their respective governments upon the expediency of adopting\r\na uniform system of coinage throughout the world, so that the coins of\r\none country may circulate in any other, without the expense of\r\nrecoinage--a consummation most devoutly to be wished.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the large amount of gold which has been thrown into the\r\nmonetary circulation of the world within the last fourteen years, has\r\nexercised so little influence upon the money market or prices generally,\r\nis at variance with the predictions of financial writers upon both sides\r\nof the Atlantic. The increase in the present production of gold,\r\ncompared with former periods, is enormous; and it would not be\r\nsurprising if, in view of the explorations which are going on in Africa,\r\nJapan, Borneo, and other countries bordering upon the equator, the\r\nproduct of the precious metals within the next decade should be a\r\nmillion of dollars _daily_. The price of gold has not diminished,\r\nalthough the annual product has increased fivefold within twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST WORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am at last resolved. This taunting devil shall possess me no longer.\r\nAt least I will meet him face to face. I have read that the face of a\r\ndead man is as though he understood the cause of all things, and was\r\ntherefore profoundly at rest, _I_ will know the cause of my wretched\r\nfate, and will be at rest. My pistols lie loaded by my side--I shall die\r\nto-night. To-morrow, twelve awestruck and trembling men will come and\r\nlook at me. They will ask each other: 'What could have been his motive\r\nfor the rash act.' Rash! my face will be calmer than theirs, for my\r\nstruggles in this life will be over; and I shall have gained--perhaps\r\nknowledge, perhaps oblivion, but certainly victory. And to-night, as the\r\nclock strikes twelve, there will be shrieks and horror in this room. No\r\nmatter: I shall have been more kind to those who utter them than they\r\nknow of, for they will not have known the cause until they have read\r\nthese lines.\r\n\r\nAnd yet most people would esteem me a happy man. I am rich in all that\r\nthe world calls riches. I sit in a room filled with luxuries; a few\r\nsteps would bring me into the midst of guests, among whom are noble men\r\nand women, sweet music, rare perfumes, glitter and costly show. My life\r\nhas been spent amid the influences of kind friends, good parents, and\r\nculture in all that is highest and worthiest in literature and art; and\r\nI can recall scenes as I write, of days that would have been most happy\r\nbut for the blight that has been upon me always. I think I see now the\r\npleasant parlor in the old house at home. Here sits our mother, a little\r\ngray, but brisk and merry as a cricket; there our father, a\r\nwell-preserved gentleman of fifty, rather gratified at feeling the first\r\naristocratic twinges of gout, and whose double eyeglass is a chief\r\nfeature in all he says; there is Bill, poring over Sir William Napier's\r\n'Peninsular War;' there is Charles, just rushing in, with a face the\r\nprincipal features in which are redness and hair, to tell us that there\r\nis another otter in the mill stream in the meadow; there is my little\r\nsister, holding grave talk with dear Dollie, and best (or worst) of all,\r\nthere is cousin Lucy--cousin Lucy, with her brown hair, and soft, loving\r\neyes and quiet ways. Where are they all now? Charley went to London, was\r\nfirst the favorite of the clubs, next a heartless rake, and finally,\r\nbeing worn out, and, like Solomon, convinced that all was vanity, went\r\ninto the Church to become that most contemptible of all creatures, a\r\nfashionable preacher; my father and mother are laid side by side in the\r\naisle of the old church on the hill, where their virtues are sculptured\r\nin marble, for the information of anxiously curious mankind; sister Mary\r\nno longer talks to dolls, though a flock of little girls, who call her\r\nmother, do. Bill, poor Bill, lies far away in the Crimea, with the\r\nbullet of a gray-coated Russian in his heart. And Lucy--but it is to her\r\nI owe what I am, and what I am about to do.\r\n\r\nI loved her--love her still. Will she _know_ what these words mean, when\r\nshe finds them here? I cannot tell. They are enough for me. Not for you\r\nare they written, ball-room lounger, whispering of endless devotion\r\nbetween every qaudrille; not to you, proud beauty, taking and absorbing\r\ndeclarations as you would an ice; not for you, chattering monkey of the\r\nChamps Elyseés, raving of your _grande passion_ for Eloise, so\r\n_charmante_, so _spirituelle_; nor for you, Eloise aforesaid, with your\r\ndevilish devices, stringing hearts in your girdle as Indians do scalps;\r\nnot for you, dancing Spaniard, with your eternal castagnets, whispering\r\njust one word to your dark-eyed señorita, as you hand her another\r\nperfumed cigarette; not for you, lounging Italian, hissing intrigues\r\nunder the shadow of an Athenian portico, or stealing after your veiled\r\nincognita, as her shadow flits over the place where the blood of Cæsar\r\ndyed the floor of the Capitol, or where the knife of Virginius flashed\r\nin the summer sun--not for one of you, for I have seen and despise you\r\nall. To you all love is a sealed book, which you shall never open--a\r\ntree of knowledge that will never turn into a curse for you--a beautiful\r\nserpent that, as you gaze upon its changing hues, will never sting you\r\nto the death.\r\n\r\nI never told her. I would wait for hours to see her pass, if she went\r\nout alone--but I never told her. I would trace her footsteps where she\r\nhad taken her daily walk; I would wait beneath her window at night, to\r\nsee but her shadow upon the blind, until she put out her lamp, and left\r\nthe stars and myself the only watchers there--but I never told her. I\r\nwould lay flowers in her way, happy if she wore them on her bosom, or\r\nwreathed them in her hair, as she sometimes would--but she never knew\r\nfrom whom they came. I sickened at my heart for her; I pined, oh! how I\r\npined for her, and worshipped her as a saint, the hope, the glory, the\r\nheaven of my life--but I never told her.\r\n\r\nDid she love me? No. And, while I loved, I feared her. She never made me\r\nher companion, never took my arm; would always sit opposite me in the\r\ncarriage instead of by my side; if in a game of forfeits, I forced the\r\nembrace I had won, she would struggle with tears of anger, though she\r\nhad given her cheek to William with a blush but a few minutes before. If\r\nI had not been her abject slave, I could have torn her in pieces. Alas!\r\nalas! we were but boys, and she a girl still. How many, long years I\r\nhave suffered since then!\r\n\r\nOne night I could not sleep, but sat up in my room thinking. Why should\r\nshe not love me? I am esteemed well-looking and intelligent, thought I,\r\nlooking into the glass, as if to confirm my satisfactory judgment of\r\nmyself. I gazed long and earnestly. Yes, certainly handsome, said I with\r\nmy lips, but--fool! fool! said my mocking eyes; for at that moment there\r\ncame out of their depths--there came a devil! Yes, a devil that glared\r\nat me from the glass! a devil that was, and yet was not, myself! a devil\r\nthat had my form, and looked out of my face, but with its own cruel,\r\nmocking eyes! And he and I confronted each other in that horrible glass.\r\nI know not how long, but they told me afterward that I was found next\r\nmorning making ghastly faces at myself.\r\n\r\nAnd then I was carried by spirits into a land of visions, where for a\r\nhundred years, or for a moment of time, I was flying through space, and\r\nclouds, and fire!--groping through dark caverns, millions of miles\r\nlong, crying wildly for light and air; now a giant, entangled in myriads\r\nof chains that I could not break; now a reptile, writhing away from\r\nfootsteps that made the earth reel and tremble beneath their tread; and\r\nat last waking, as if out of sleep, a poor, puny thing, with limbs like\r\nshadows, laughing or crying by turns for very feebleness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs I arose from that bed I knew that I was changed. It was a secret\r\nthought, a secret that I have kept till now. I was not quite sure at\r\nfirst, but it thus fell out that I knew it well:\r\n\r\nOne day William and I had been sitting for some time in the library, he\r\nreading and I looking at the faces that glowed in the red-hot coal, and\r\nthinking of Lucy and him.\r\n\r\n'Where is Lucy?' said I, at length,\r\n\r\n'Gone out into the village,' he answered, without looking from the book;\r\n'first to buy gloves, then to see Miss Trip, the dancing mistress, who\r\nis ill, then to Hurst Park to tea, whence I am to fetch her at nine\r\no'clock.'\r\n\r\n'You seem to know all her movements,' I said, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n'Certainly, he rejoined, 'she told me all that I have told you.'\r\n\r\n'You always _are_ in her confidence,' said I, very angrily, as my blood\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n'I believe so,' said he, calmly; though he looked at me with some\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n'And I never,' said I, between my teeth.\r\n\r\n'That,' he said, 'is a matter with which I have no concern.'\r\n\r\nI ground my teeth, but I kept quiet. I kept quiet, though every nerve in\r\nmy body tingled with rage, and my boiling blood rushed into my eyes till\r\nI could hardly see. 'Do you know,' I shouted, 'do you know that I love\r\nher--would die a thousand deaths for her?'\r\n\r\nHe clasped his hands with a quick motion, as he said in a low voice,\r\n'And so do I; and so would I.'\r\n\r\n'Beast, fiend!' I screamed, 'does she--does she----' I could not get out\r\nthe accursed words.\r\n\r\n'We have been engaged,' he answered, divining what I would have asked,\r\n'we have been engaged for some time, and----'\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence, for I sprang at him, crushed him to the\r\nfloor, squeezed his throat till his face grew black and the froth oozed\r\nout from his lips, beat his head upon the hearthstones till he lay still\r\nand bleeding, and then sought my knife. It was up stairs. I flew to get\r\nit. It lay upon my dressing table before the glass, and I snatched at\r\nit. Great God! as I did so, another arm was thrust forth--not mine, I\r\nswear, if I live a thousand years; and as I recoiled, I saw in that\r\nglass a fiend step back. Not me, not me!--but a fiend with bloody hands,\r\nand a foul leer upon its face, and a fierce, cruel laugh in its\r\nglittering eyes. It was he, it was he! It was the devil that had\r\npossessed me before, come back again. And as I shuddered and gasped, and\r\nturned away, and then looked again into those eyes that pierced _me_\r\nthrough, and saw the cold, bitter smile that was on the face before me,\r\nI knew that the fiend would leave me never more, and that I was mad!\r\n\r\nWhat was a quarrel with my brother now? I stole back, and, lifting him\r\nup, carried him to his room, where I washed the blood from his face.\r\nWhen he came to himself I fell at his feet and besought his pardon, and\r\nthat he would keep what had happened a secret. He forgave me. And I\r\nbelieve the only lie he ever told in all his life was when he told Lucy\r\nthat he had cut his head by falling on a jagged stone.\r\n\r\nOh, how often after that my fingers itched to be at his throat again;\r\nbut I always quailed before his steady eye.\r\n\r\nI pass over the next few years, except to say that I went to college,\r\nwhere I was shunned by all, though never alone: was a dunce, and plucked\r\ntwice. Perhaps it was I who shunned others, for had I not society in\r\nthe constant presence of my Familiar? I was of course a dunce, for my\r\nbrain was never steady enough to carry me over the _Pons Asinorum_, or\r\nto make a Latin verse with even decent correctness. I went away in\r\ndisgust. I think if I had stayed longer I should have torn somebody, or\r\nelse myself.\r\n\r\nI went next into the army. It was a new era in my life, and, strange to\r\nsay, my devil left me for a while, so that I was able to master the\r\ndetails of my profession, and to be esteemed a good and careful officer.\r\nThere was hope, too, of active service; for the Russian Eagle was slowly\r\nunfolding his vast wings for a new descent into the plains of Europe.\r\nWilliam, married to Her now, who was a lieutenant in the Foot Guards,\r\nwrote to me to say that he hoped we should be really brothers, now that\r\nwe were to meet before an enemy; and the next day out came the\r\ndeclaration of war. When I had read it, I drew my sword, and, as I ran\r\nmy eye along its cold, sharp blade from hilt to point, I thought how\r\nstrange was its power to let out a man's life, and turn him, in a\r\nmoment, into a heap of inanimate carrion.\r\n\r\nOf course I am not going to tell the history of the great siege in the\r\nCrimea, for every child knows by heart the tale of the clambering fight\r\nup the Alma's steeps, of the withering volley that suddenly crashed out\r\nof the gray twilight on the hill of Inkerman, of the long months of\r\nstarvation, of the final _feu d'enfer_, beneath which the Russian host\r\ncrowded over the narrow bridge that saved them from their foe. But of\r\nthe fatal charge of the Six Hundred I must speak, for I was one of them,\r\nand I have cursed its memory a thousand times.\r\n\r\nI well remember that day--how restless I was the night before, and how I\r\nlistened to the dropping shots on either side, hoping almost that one\r\nwould find its way to my heart.\r\n\r\nWe were brigaded by daylight. Some manoeuvres on an extensive scale\r\nwere to be attempted, I believe, one of which was to outflank some\r\nbatteries of field artillery by which we had suffered much loss. They\r\nwere drawn up at the side and end of the valley of Balaklava, and we\r\nwere at the other end, and were ordered, it has since been said in\r\nerror, to charge down the valley upon them.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful the sun rose that day! The dewy odors from a thousand\r\nflowers came floating up from that green valley as he rolled away the\r\nmists from the mountain tops, and showed us the dusky masses far below,\r\nfrom which the shot came whizzing every now and then. Gods! how we\r\nexulted at the sight. Along our line rose a wild cheer, as our horses\r\ntugged and strained at their bits, and every man's bridle was drawn\r\ntight. Soon a puff of smoke came from a hillock near, and the stern\r\ncommand 'draw swords' ran along from troop to troop, as the bright steel\r\nflashed in the sunshine like a river of light. Then out pealed the\r\ntrumpets, and away we went, amidst a storm of ringing harness, and\r\nclashing scabbards, and flying banners, and thundering hoofs that made\r\nthe ground shake. On we dashed, straight across the valley, in front of\r\na point-blank fire, that emptied many a saddle as we flew along,\r\nstraight upon the mass of smoke and flame which hid those fatal\r\nbatteries--straight at the gunners, dealing out wild blows upon them,\r\nwhile they fought with swords, or axes, or clubbed muskets, or gun\r\nspongers, or anything that could cut or strike a blow.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I only know that I was in the first line, and among the first\r\nin the mêlée; where my first blow lighted upon the bare head of a\r\nRussian, whose blood spouted high as I cut at him with all my force; for\r\nafter that a mist came over my eyes, and I fought in the dark, and then\r\ncame oblivion.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke to consciousness, which I did not for several days, I found\r\nthat I was wounded, and had been in danger of my life, though I should\r\nmost probably recover. As soon as I was strong enough to talk much, I\r\nwas told that my bravery had been very conspicuous, and that I had been\r\nhonorably mentioned in the order of the day. Four Russians, it seemed,\r\nhad died by my hand, and being at last cut on the head by a sabre, I was\r\nwith difficulty held on my horse when the retreat was sounded. I had\r\nraved, it also appeared, incessantly; but now the fever had left me.\r\nGood. It was fever, they thought, which had held possession of me. But\r\nthose who said so did not know what power it was that nerved my arm, and\r\nthen, having worked his devilish wile, flung me away like a broken toy.\r\nFever! They did not know that it was a 'fever' that had cursed me for\r\ntwelve long years.\r\n\r\nBut I got well, as those who were about me said, and, having been\r\nreported fit for duty, made my appearance at parade, and afterward, the\r\nsame day, at mess.\r\n\r\nMy brother was dead. One day, while I lay ill, he and a party of his\r\nbrother officers were idly chatting in one of the more advanced\r\ntrenches, when a minié ball struck him, and he died without a word or\r\ngroan. They carried him out, and he lies at the little graveyard at\r\nScutari, with thousands of others who fell in the Great Siege. His sword\r\nand other relics had been kept for me, and among them was a portrait of\r\nCousin Lucy, which he had worn next his heart. I should have to take it\r\nto her. The general in command had already written to her, with the news\r\nof her bereavement.\r\n\r\nI was saying that I rejoined the mess. All my comrades congratulated me\r\nbut one. He was a young fellow, recently exchanged from another\r\nregiment, who would one day wear the strawberry leaf upon his coronet--a\r\ncold, supercilious, prying puppy, whom I hated at once. When we were\r\nintroduced, our mutual bow was studied in its cold formality--on his\r\nside so much so as to be almost insulting, considering the place and\r\ncircumstances. To this day I believe that he, the only one of all there,\r\nhad suspected me, and I felt that I must be perpetually on my guard\r\nagainst his curious glances. I was sure that one day we should have to\r\nstrive for the mastery. And we did--sooner than I expected; for, as the\r\ncolonel filled his glass, and, calling upon the rest to follow his\r\nexample, drank a welcome to me back among them, this knave, sitting\r\nopposite at the time, fixed his eyes upon me as he lifted his glass to\r\nhis lips, and did not drink. As our looks met, I knew that he mocked me,\r\nand I flung my wine in his face, and raved.\r\n\r\nThose present forced me away, and took me to my tent, where they made me\r\nlie down. I was supposed to be delirious from weakness and the effects\r\nof my wound, and I heard them say, 'He has come out too soon; that wine\r\nhe drank at dinner was too much for him.' Good again! It was the wine!\r\n'But,' thought I, 'as soon as this arm shall be able to strike or\r\nthrust, I will have the life of that sneering devil, or he mine.' And I\r\nkept my word. I met him within ten days afterward, walking at some\r\ndistance from the camp, quite alone, as I was myself.\r\n\r\n'Good morning,' said he; 'you are about again, as I am glad to see.'\r\n\r\nI said to him, 'Do you forget the time when I was out before?'\r\n\r\n'Surely not,' said he; 'but I knew that you had been ill, and was not\r\nmaster of yourself.'\r\n\r\n'And so forgave me?' I rejoined, in a passion.\r\n\r\n'And so forgave,' said he; 'why not?'\r\n\r\n'Then learn,' said I, 'that I _was_ master of myself; that I am now;\r\nthat you insulted me grossly; that the only words I have for you\r\nare--draw, sir, draw!'\r\n\r\n'Stop!' he cried, as I drew my sword; 'pray come back with me to the\r\ncamp. You are ill; pray, come back; I have no quarrel with you, believe\r\nme.'\r\n\r\nBut I struck him on the breast with my swordhilt, so that he nearly\r\nfell. Then he recovered himself, and, still crying out that he had no\r\nquarrel with me, drew and stood upon his guard, while I rushed upon him.\r\n\r\nHe was cool, and I furious. I believe he could have killed me easily if\r\nhe had wished, but he only parried my rapid blows. At last, however, as\r\nI pressed him more closely, he grew paler, and began to fight in\r\nearnest. What _then_ could he do against a madman? I bore him back, step\r\nby step, till a mass of rock stopped him; and there I kept him, with the\r\nhissing steel playing about his head, until he dropped upon one knee and\r\nhis sword fell from his hand. Then I paused, waiting to see him die as I\r\nwould a wounded hare, as die I knew he must, for I had pierced him with\r\ntwenty wounds. He knelt thus, and looked, not at me, but at the setting\r\nsun; and then his head drooped and he rolled over, and was dead.\r\n\r\nAnd as I wiped my sword on the grass, I shouted with glee.\r\n\r\nOf course, I told no one. It was but another secret added to the many\r\nthat had torn my heart and brain. Nor, when the body was found, stripped\r\nby camp followers, and supposed to be killed by a reconnoitring party of\r\nthe enemy, did I betray myself by word or look.\r\n\r\nAt last the war was over, and we were ordered home. I bade farewell to\r\nthe blue hills of the Crimea with secret joy, and as the shore faded\r\nfrom my sight, the memory of all that had happened to me during the\r\nGreat Siege faded from my memory like a dream.\r\n\r\nUpon our landing, I went as soon as possible home. How green the hedges\r\nwere, how sweet the scent of the violets, how soft the grass, how grand\r\nthe arching oaks and giant elms, as I journeyed along on foot. Surely I\r\nhave suffered enough, I said to myself, as I passed through meadow, and\r\ncopse, and lane, and over stiles, and to the old park at last. Surely I\r\nhave suffered enough, I said, as I came to the lodge gate, where the\r\nkeeper's wife looked curiously at my uniform and bronzed face, and the\r\ncrape on my arm, and then ran into the lodge to tell her husband that\r\nhere was Master Horace come back. Surely there was peace in that old\r\nhouse, with its pointed gables, and moss-clad turrets, and ivied walls,\r\nand little gothic windows--where the old butler grasped my hand; and the\r\nmaids came peeping out; and the old dog licked my face; where poor Lucy\r\nwept upon my breast--wept for that I had come back alone; and then put\r\nher little girl into my arms, to kiss dear Uncle Horace, come home once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBut, when I went to bed that night, in the same glass that showed me my\r\nEnemy years before, I saw him looking at me, with his cruel smile,\r\nshining out of my own eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat more remains to be told? But little; for it was but the old story.\r\nIt is enough to say that I struggled on, hoping against hope; that I\r\ncheated myself with the maddest hope of all--that she might be brought\r\nto love me; that I one day prayed her to become my wife, and that she\r\nbroke from me with terror and loathing; that I fled her presence, and\r\nwas once more a wanderer over the earth; that my weary feet dragged me\r\nover the snows of Siberia, where the furred noble and the chained serf\r\nworked side by side; over the burning sands, where the brown Arab\r\ncareers along upon his steed, his white burnous fluttering in the hot\r\nwind; over the broad prairies of America, where the Indian prowls with\r\nhis trusty rifle, waiting for the wild beast; over the paths of the\r\ntrackless deep; over the still wilder deserts and still more lonely\r\ndeeps of revelry and vice;--what more than that I have come back again;\r\nthat many guests are here to do honor to my return; that these are the\r\nlast words which I shall ever write!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTING\r\n\r\n   When 'mid the loud notes of the drum\r\n     And fife tones shrilling on the ear,\r\n   The music of our nation's hymns\r\n     Rose 'neath the elm trees loud and clear;\r\n   When on the Common's grassy plain\r\n     The city poured her countless throng,\r\n   And blessings fell like April rain\r\n     On each one as he marched along;\r\n\r\n   We parted,--hand close clasped in hand,\r\n     Telling the thoughts tongue could not speak;\r\n   Was it unmanly that our eyes\r\n     O'erflowed with love upon the cheek?\r\n   I hear thy cheery voice outspeak,\r\n     'Courage, the months will quickly fly,\r\n   And ere November chill and bleak\r\n     We meet at home, Ned, you and I.'\r\n\r\n   A livelier strain came from the band,\r\n     'God bless you' went from each to each;\r\n   A gazing eye, a waving hand,\r\n     Where hearts were all too full for speech.\r\n   He marched, obeying duty's call,\r\n     Of noblest nature, first to hear;\r\n   I, bound by fond domestic thrall,\r\n     In path of duty lingered here.\r\n\r\n   Slowly the summer months rolled on,\r\n     October harvested the corn,\r\n   November came with shortening days,\r\n     Passed by in mist and rain,--was gone,--\r\n   Yet still he came not; winter's snow\r\n     In feathery vesture clothed the trees,\r\n   Or, iceclad in a jewelled glow,\r\n     They sparkled in the chilly breeze.\r\n\r\n   Spring glowed along Potomac vales,\r\n     While north her footsteps tardier came,\r\n   For him the golden jasmine trails\r\n     O'er bright azaleas all aflame;\r\n   Still upon Yorktown's trampled fields,\r\n     O'er grassy plain and wooded swell,\r\n   Her sunny wealth the summer yields,\r\n     And still the word comes, 'All is well.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     'All of which I saw, and part of which I was.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the exercises at the meeting house were conducted by\r\nPreston, who publicly catechized the negroes very much in the manner\r\nthat is practised in Northern Sunday schools. When the services were\r\nover, and the family had gathered around the supper table, I said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n'I've an idea of passing the evening with Joe; he has invited me. Would\r\nit be proper for you and Mrs. Preston to go?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes; and we will. I would like to have you see his mother. She is a\r\nwonderful woman, and, if in the mood, will astonish you.'\r\n\r\n'I think you told me she is a native African?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, she is. She was brought from Africa when a child. She has a dim\r\nrecollection of her life there, and retains the language and\r\nsuperstitions of her race,' replied Preston, rising from the table. 'I\r\nthink you had better go at once, for she retires early; Lucy and I will\r\nfollow you as soon as we can.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoe's cabin was located nearly in the centre of the little collection of\r\nnegro houses, and a few hundred yards from the mansion. It was of logs,\r\na story and a half high, and had originally been only about twenty feet\r\nsquare. To the primitive structure, however, an addition of the same\r\ndimensions had been made, and as it then stretched for more than forty\r\nfeet along the narrow bypath which separated the two rows of negro\r\nshanties, it presented quite an imposing appearance. A second addition\r\nin its rear, though it did not increase its dignity in the eyes of\r\n'street' observers, added largely to its proportions and convenience.\r\n\r\nThe various epochs in Joe's history were plainly written on his\r\ndwelling. The original building noted the time when, a common field\r\nhand, he had married a wife, and set up housekeeping; the front addition\r\nmarked the era when his industry, intelligence, and devotion to his\r\nmaster's interest had raised him above the dead level of black\r\nservitude, and given him the management of the plantation; and the rear\r\nstructure spoke pleasantly of the time when old Deborah, disabled by age\r\nfrom longer service at 'the great house,' and too infirm to clamber up\r\nthe steep ladder which led to Joe's attic bedrooms, had come to doze\r\naway the remainder of her days under her son's roof.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was furnished with two entrance doors, and suspecting that the\r\none in the older portion led directly into the kitchen, I rapped lightly\r\nat the other. In a moment it opened, and Joe ushered me into the living\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThat apartment occupied the whole of the newer front, and had a\r\ncheerful, cosy appearance. Its floor was covered with a tidy rag carpet,\r\nevidently of home manufacture, and its plastered walls were decorated\r\nwith tasteful paper, and hung with a number of neatly framed engravings.\r\nOpposite the doorway stood a large mahogany bureau, and over it,\r\nsuspended from the ceiling by leathern cords, was a curiously contrived\r\nshelving, containing a score or more of well-worn books. Among them I\r\nnoticed a small edition of 'Shakespeare,' Milton's 'Poems,' Goldsmith's\r\n'England,' the six volumes of 'Comprehensive Commentary,' Taylor's 'Holy\r\nLiving and Dying,' the 'Pilgrim's Progress,' a 'United States\r\nGazetteer,' and a complete set of the theological writings of\r\nSwedenborg. Neat chintz curtains covered the small windows, a number of\r\nbrightly burnished brass candlesticks ornamented a plain wooden mantle\r\nover the broad fireplace, and a yellow-pine table, oiled and varnished,\r\non which the 'tea things' were still standing, occupied the centre of\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nThrough an open door, at the right of the bureau, I caught a glimpse of\r\nthe dormitory of the aged Africaness. As on the exterior of the building\r\na brief epitome of Joe's history was written, so in that room a portion\r\nof his character was traced. Its comfortable and almost elegant\r\nfurnishings told, plainer than any words, that he was a devoted and\r\naffectionate son. With its rich Brussels carpet, red window hangings,\r\ncosy lounge, neat centre table, and small black-walnut bureau, it might\r\nhave been mistaken for the private apartment of a white lady of some\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after nightfall when I entered the cabin, but a bright\r\nfire, blazing on the hearth, gave me a full view of its occupants. Aggy,\r\na tidily clad, middle-aged yellow woman, was clearing away the supper\r\ntable, and Joe's mother was smoking a pipe in a large arm chair, in the\r\nchimney corner.\r\n\r\nThe old negress wore a black levantine gown, open in front, and gathered\r\nabout the waist by a silken cord; a red and yellow turban, from\r\nunderneath which escaped a few frosted locks, and a white cambric\r\nneckerchief that fell carelessly over her shoulders, and almost hid her\r\nwithered, scrawny neck. She was upward of seventy, but so infirm that\r\nshe appeared nearly a hundred. One of her lean, skinny arms, escaping\r\nfrom the loose sleeve of her dress, rested on her knee; and her bowed,\r\nbony frame leaned against the arm of her chair, as if incapable of\r\nsitting upright. Her features, with the exception of her nose, which\r\ncurved slightly upward, were thin and regular; and her eyes were large,\r\ndeep, and densely black, and seemed turned inward, as if gazing with a\r\nhalf-wondering stare at the strange mechanism which held together her\r\nqueer frame-work of bones and gutta percha.\r\n\r\nShe was the old woman who had greeted Preston so affectionately on our\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nTurning to her as he tendered me a chair, Joe said:\r\n\r\n'Mudder, dis am Mr. Kirke.'\r\n\r\nMaking a feeble effort to rise, and reaching out her trembling hand she\r\nexclaimed, in a voice just above a whisper:\r\n\r\n'You'm welcome yere, right welcome, sar.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, aunty. Pray keep your seat; don't rise on my account.'\r\n\r\n'Tank _you_, massa Kirke, fur comin' yere. It'm bery good ob you. Ole\r\nmissy lub you, sar; you'm so good ter massa Robert. He'm my own chile,\r\nsar!'\r\n\r\nThis was undoubtedly a figure of speech, for the old woman's skin was\r\naltogether too black not to have given a trifle of its shading to the\r\ncomplexion of her children. It was not only black, but blue black, and\r\nof that peculiar hue which is seen only on the faces of native Africans.\r\n\r\nSeeing that she had relinquished smoking, I said:\r\n\r\n'Never mind me, aunty; I smoke myself sometimes.'\r\n\r\n'Tank you, sar,' she replied, resuming her pipe, and relapsing into her\r\nprevious position; 'ole wimmin lub 'backer, sar.'\r\n\r\nThe low tone in which this was said made me conclude that further\r\nconversation would be exhausting to her, so turning to Joe and Aggy--the\r\nlatter had hurried through her domestic employments, and taken a seat\r\nnear the fire--I entered into a general discussion of the old worthies\r\nthat occupied Joe's book shelves.\r\n\r\nI found the negro had taxed them for house room. He had levied on their\r\nbest thoughts, and I soon experienced the uneasy sensation which one\r\nfeels when he encounters a man who can 'talk him dry' on almost any\r\nsubject. On the single topic of the business to which I was educated, I\r\nmight have displayed, had it not been Sunday night, a greater amount of\r\ninformation; but in the knowledge of every subject that was broached,\r\nthe black was my superior.\r\n\r\nThe conversation had rambled on for a full half hour, the old negress\r\nmeanwhile puffing steadily away, and giving no heed to it; when suddenly\r\nher pipe dropped from her mouth, her eyes closed, her bent figure became\r\nerect, and a quick, convulsive shiver passed over her. Thinking she was\r\nabout to fall in a fit, I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Joe! See! your mother!'\r\n\r\n'Neber mind, sar,' he quietly replied; 'it'm nuffin'. Only de power am\r\non her.'\r\n\r\nA few more convulsive spasms succeeded, when the old woman's face\r\nassumed a settled expression; and swaying her body back and forth with a\r\nslow, steady motion, she commenced humming a low chant. Gradually it\r\ngrew louder, till it broke into a strange, wild song, filling the room,\r\nand coming back in short, broken echoes from the adjoining apartments.\r\nStruck with astonishment, I was about to speak, when Joe, laying his\r\nhand on my arm, said:\r\n\r\n'Hush, sar! It am de song ob de kidnap slave!'\r\n\r\nIt was sung in the African tongue, but I thought I heard, as it rose and\r\nfell in a wild, irregular cadence, the thrilling story of the stolen\r\nblack; his smothered cries, and fevered moans in the slaver's hold; the\r\nshriek of the wind, and the sullen sound of the surging waves as they\r\nbroke against the accursed ship; and, then--as the old negress rose and\r\npoured forth quick, broken volumes of song--the loud mirth of the\r\ndrunken crew, mingling with what seemed dying groans, and the heavy\r\nsplash of falling bodies striking the sea.\r\n\r\nAs she concluded, with a firm, stately step--showing none of her\r\nprevious decrepitude--she approached me:\r\n\r\nSeeing that I regarded her movements with a look of startled interest,\r\nJoe said:\r\n\r\n'Leff har do what she likes, sar. She hab suffin' to say to you.'\r\n\r\nTaking a small bag[1] from her bosom, and placing it in the open front\r\nof my waistcoat, she reached out her long, skinny arm, and placing her\r\nskeleton hand on the top of my head, chanted a low song. The words were\r\nmostly English, and the few I caught were something as follows:\r\n\r\n   'Oh, bress de swanga buckra man;\r\n   Bress wife an' chile ob buckra man.'\r\n   Bress all dat b'long to buckra man;\r\n   Barimo[2] bress de buckra man;\r\n   De good Lord bress de buckra man;\r\n   Bress, bress de swanga buckra man.'\r\n\r\nAs she finished the invocation, she took both my hands in hers, and\r\nleaning forward, and muttering a few low words, seemed trying to read\r\nthe story imprinted on my palms. Her eyes were closed, and thinking she\r\nmight be troubled to see me without the use of those organs, I looked\r\ninquiringly at her son.\r\n\r\n'She don't need eyes, sar,' said Joe, answering my thought; 'she'll tell\r\nall 'bout you widout dem.'\r\n\r\nAs he said this, she dropped one of my hands, and raising her right arm,\r\nmade several passes over my head, then resting her hand again upon it,\r\nshe began chanting another low song:\r\n\r\n'What der yer see, mudder?' asked Joe, leaning forward, with a look of\r\nintense interest on his face.\r\n\r\n'A tall gemman-de swanga gemman--in a big city. De night am dark an'\r\ncole--bery cole. Pore little chile am wid him, an' he cole--bery cole;\r\nhim cloes pore--bery pore. Dey come to a big hous'n--great light in de\r\nwinders--an' dey gwo in--swanga gemman an' pore chile. A great room\r\ndar, wid big fire, an' oh! sweet young missus. She jump up-swanga gemman\r\nspeak to har, an' show de pore chile. She look sorry like, an' cry; den\r\nshe frow har arm 'roun' de pore chile; take him to de fire, an' kiss\r\nhim--kiss him ober an' ober agin.'\r\n\r\nIt was the scene when Kate first saw Frank, on the night of his mother's\r\ndeath. I said nothing, but Joe asked:\r\n\r\n'Any more, mudder?'\r\n\r\n'Yas. I sees a big city, anoder city, in de daytime. In dark room,\r\nupstars, am swanga gemman an' anoder buckra man--he bad buckra man.\r\nBuckra angel dar, too, a standin' 'side de swanga gemman, but swanga\r\ngemman doan't see har. She look jess like de pore chile. De swanga\r\ngemman git up, an' 'pear angry, bery angry, but he keep in. Talk hard to\r\noder buckra man, who shake him head, an' look down. Swanga gemman den\r\nwalk de room, an' talk fasser yit, but bad buckra man keep shakin' him\r\nhead. Den swanga gemman stan' right ober de oder buckra man, an' de\r\nstrong words come inter him froat. Him 'pears gwine to curse de buckra\r\nman, but de angel put har han' ober him moufh, an' say suffin' to him.\r\nSwanga gemman yeres, dough he doan't see har. Den he say nuffin' more,\r\nbut gwo right 'way.'\r\n\r\nIt was the scene in Hallet's office, when I told him of his victim's\r\ndeath, and entreated him to provide for, if he did not acknowledge his\r\nchild. The words which flashed upon my brain, and stayed the curse which\r\nrose to my lips, were those of the dying girl: 'Leave him to GOD!'\r\n\r\n'Go on. Tell me what she _said_,' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'Mudder doan't _yere_; she only see de pictur ob what hab been. Listen!'\r\nsaid Joe; and the old woman again spoke:\r\n\r\n'I sees a big city--de fuss city, an' great hous'n--de fuss hous'n. De\r\nyoung missus am dar, wid de pore chile, an' a little chile dat look jess\r\nlike she do; an' dar'm anoder bery little chile dar, too. Dey'm upstars\r\nin a room, wid a bed an' a candle burnin'. Dey'm gwine to bed. Young\r\nmissus kneel down wid de two chil'ren, an' pray. An' side de pore chile,\r\nan' kneelin' down wid har arm roun' him neck, am de buckra angel. She\r\npray, too. Swanga gemman in anoder room yere dem aprayin', an' he come\r\nan' look. He say nuffin', but he stan' dar, an' de big tear run down him\r\ncheek. De time come back to him when _he_ wus a little chile, an' he\r\npray like dem. He doan't pray 'nuff now!'\r\n\r\nIt was the last night I had passed at home. A feeling of indescribable\r\nawe crept over me, and I rose halfway from my seat.\r\n\r\n'Sit still, sar,' said Joe, almost forcing me back into the chair.\r\n'You'll break de power.'\r\n\r\n'You know the past, old woman,' I exclaimed. 'Tell me the future!'\r\n\r\n'Hush!' she replied, with an imperious tone. 'Dey'm comin'.'\r\n\r\nDuring all this time she had stood with her hand on my head, as\r\nimmovable as a marble statue. Her voice had a deep, strong tone, and her\r\nface wore a look of calm power. Nothing about her reminded me of the\r\nweak, decrepit old woman she had been but an hour before.\r\n\r\n'Dey'm yere!' she said; and in another moment the door opened, and\r\nPreston and his wife entered.\r\n\r\nWithout rising or speaking, Joe motioned them to two vacant chairs. As\r\nthey seated themselves, I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'She has told me all things that ever I did!'\r\n\r\n'She has strange powers,' replied Preston.\r\n\r\n'Hush, Robert Preston! De swanga gemman ax fur de future!'\r\n\r\nShading then her closed eyes with one hand, and leaning forward, as if\r\npeering into the far distance, the old negress laid her other hand again\r\non my head, and continued:\r\n\r\n'I see a deep, wide riber flowin' on to de great sea. De swanga gemman,\r\nin strong boat, am on it; an' de young missus, an' de pore chile, an'\r\none, two oder chile, am wid him. De storm strike de riber, an' raise de\r\nbig wave, but de boat gwo on jess de same. De swanga gemman he doan't\r\nkeer fur de storm, or de big wave, fur he got 'em all dar! An' I see\r\nanoder riber--not so deep, not so wide--flowin' on 'side de big riber,\r\nto de great sea; an' you' (looking at Preston), 'an' de good missus, an'\r\none, two, free, four chile am dar. De wind blow ober dat riber an' raise\r\nde big wave, but de swanga gemman reach out him hand, an' de wave gwo\r\ndown. An' I see a little riber flow out ob de big riber, an' de pore\r\nchile in a little boat am on it. An' a little riber come out ob de oder\r\nriber an' gwo into de oder little riber, an' a chile am on dat, too. De\r\ntwo little boats meet, an' de two chile gwo on togedder, but--de storm\r\ncome dar, an'--de great rocks--oh! oh!' and, covering her face with her\r\nhands, she turned away.\r\n\r\n'What more do you see? Tell me, Deborah!' exclaimed Preston, bending\r\nforward with breathless eagerness.\r\n\r\nShe raised her head, and seemed to look again in the same direction;\r\nthen, in a low tone, said:\r\n\r\n'I sees no more.'\r\n\r\n'What of the other river? What of that?' he exclaimed, with the same\r\nbreathless anxiety.\r\n\r\n'I sees--de boat 'mong de rocks--de great rocks--an' you--dar--all by\r\nyou'seff--all by you'seff--an'--O Barimo!' and, giving a low scream, she\r\nstarted back as if palsied with dread.\r\n\r\nSpringing to his feet, Preston seized her by both arms, and screamed\r\nout:\r\n\r\n'What more! Tell me WHAT MORE!'\r\n\r\nDrawing her tall form up to its full height, and looking at him with her\r\nclosed eyes, she said, in a voice inexpressibly sad and tender:\r\n\r\n'I sees de great rocks--de great fall--de great sea!' then pausing a\r\nmoment, and pointing upward, she added: 'Robert Preston! Trust in GOD!'\r\n\r\nOvercome with emotion, she staggered back to her seat. A few convulsive\r\nshudders passed over her; her eyes slowly opened, and--she was the same\r\nweak, old woman as before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning I bade adieu to my kind friends, and started again on\r\nmy journey. Preston accompanied me as far as Wilmington, where we\r\nparted; he going on to Whitesville, in search of the new turpentine\r\nlocation; and I, proceeding by the Charleston boat, southward.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nOn my return to my home, a few weeks after the events narrated in the\r\nprevious chapter, in pursuance of a promise made to Preston, I inserted\r\nan advertisement in the papers, which read somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n     'WANTED, a suitable person to go South, as governess in a planter's\r\n     family. She must be thoroughly educated, and competent to instruct\r\n     a boy of twelve. Such a one may apply by letter;' etc., etc.\r\n\r\nA score of replies flowed in within the few following days, but being\r\nexcessively occupied with a mass of personal business, which had\r\naccumulated in my absence, I laid them all aside, till more than one\r\nweek had elapsed. Then, one evening I took them home, and Kate and I\r\nopened the batch. As each one was read by my wife or myself, we\r\ncommented on the character of the writers as indicated by the\r\nhandwriting and general style of the epistles. Rejecting about two\r\nthirds as altogether unworthy of attention, we reserved the remaining\r\nhalf dozen for a second inspection. Among these, the one with the\r\ncramped, precise chirography was thought to come from an old maid.\r\nAnother, whose five lines of rail fence covered a sheet nearly as large\r\nas a ten-acre lot, was the production of a strong-minded woman. A third,\r\non tinted paper, and dotted with blots and erasures, was from a fat\r\nlady, who wore her shoes down at the heel, and got up too late for\r\nbreakfast. 'But here, Kate,' I exclaimed, as I opened the fourth\r\nmissive, 'this one, in this firm yet lady-like hand--this one will do.\r\nHear what it says:\r\n\r\n     SIR:--I think I can answer your requirements. A line addressed to\r\n     Catharine Walley, B----, N.H., with full particulars, will receive\r\n     immediate attention.\r\n\r\n'That's the woman, Kate. A business man in petticoats! _She_ can manage\r\na boy of twelve!'\r\n\r\n'Or a man of twice that age,' said Kate, quietly reading the letter. 'I\r\nwouldn't have that woman in _my_ house.'\r\n\r\n'Why not? She has character--take my word for it. Her letter is as short\r\nand sweet as a 'promise to pay.''\r\n\r\n'She has too much character, and not of the right sort. There is no\r\nwomanliness about her.'\r\n\r\n'You women are always hard on your own sex. She'll have to manage Joe,\r\nand she'll need to be half man to do that. I think I had better write\r\nher to come here. I can tell what she is when I see her. I can read a\r\nwoman like a book.'\r\n\r\nThere was a slight twinkle in my wife's eyes when I said this, and she\r\nmade some further objections, but I overruled them; and, on the\r\nfollowing morning, dispatched a letter, inviting Miss Walley to the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nReturning to my office from ''Change,' one afternoon, a few days\r\nafterward, I found a lady awaiting me. She rose as I entered, and gave\r\nher name as Miss Walley. She was prepossessing and lady-like in\r\nappearance, and there was a certain ease and self-possession in her\r\nmanner, which I was surprised to see in one directly from a remote\r\ncountry town. She wore a plain gray dress, with a cape of the same\r\nmaterial; a straw hat, neatly trimmed with brown ribbon, and, on the\r\ninside, a bunch of deep pink flowers, which gave a slight coloring to\r\nher otherwise pale and sallow but intellectual face. Her whole dress\r\nbespoke refinement and taste. She was tall and slender, with an almost\r\nimperceptible stoop in the shoulders, indicative of a studious habit;\r\nbut you forgot this seeming defect in her easy and graceful movements.\r\nHer brown hair was combed plainly over a rather low and narrow forehead;\r\nher face was long and thin, and her small, clear gray eyes were shaded\r\nby brown eyebrows meeting together, and, when she was talking earnestly,\r\nor listening attentively, slightly contracting, and deepening her keen\r\nand thoughtful expression. Her nose was long and rather prominent; and\r\nher mouth and chin were large, showing character and will; but their\r\nmasculine expression was relieved by a short upper lip, which displayed\r\nto full advantage the finest set of teeth I ever saw.\r\n\r\nReferring at once to the object of her visit, she handed me a number of\r\ncredentials, highly commendatory of her character and ability as a\r\nteacher. I glanced over them, and assured her they were satisfactory.\r\nShe then questioned me as to the compensation she would receive, and the\r\nposition of the family needing her services. Answering these inquiries,\r\nI added that I was prepared to engage her on the terms I had named.\r\n\r\n'I have been in receipt of the same salary as assistant in a school in\r\nmy native village, sir,' she replied; 'but what you say of the family of\r\nMr. Preston, and a desire to visit the South, will induce me to accept\r\nthe situation.'\r\n\r\n'When will you be ready to go, madam?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'At once, sir. To-day, if necessary.'\r\n\r\nSurprised and yet pleased with her promptness, I said:\r\n\r\n'And are you entirely ready to go so far on so short notice?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. The cars leave in the morning, I am told. I will start\r\nthen.'\r\n\r\n'And alone?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir. We Yankee girls are accustomed to taking care of ourselves.'\r\n\r\n'I admire your independence. But you pass the night in town; you will, I\r\ntrust, spend it at my residence?'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\nOrdering a carriage and stopping on the way at a hotel to get the single\r\ntrunk which contained her wardrobe, I conveyed her at once to my\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nAfter supper we all gathered in the parlor, and I set about entertaining\r\nour guest. I had to make little effort to do that, for her conversation\r\nsoon displayed a knowledge of books and people, and a wit and keenness\r\nof intellect, as decidedly entertained me. She was not only brilliant,\r\nbut agreeable; and in the course of the evening made some pleasant\r\novertures to the children. Frank, with a book in his hand, had drawn his\r\nchair off to another part of the room, and showed, at first, uncommon\r\nreserve for a lad of his warm and genial nature; but gradually, as if in\r\nspite of himself, he edged his chair nearer to her. Our little 'four\r\nyear old,' however, resisting the offered temptation of watch and chain,\r\nand even sugar-plums, repelled her advances, and hid his curly head only\r\nthe more closely in the folds of his mother's dress. Kate listened and\r\nlaughed, but I caught occasionally, as her eyes studied the visitor\r\nattentively, a troubled expression, which I well understood. After a\r\nwhile the lady expressed a readiness to retire that she might obtain the\r\nrest needed for an early start by the morning train, and Kate conducted\r\nher to her apartment.\r\n\r\nI felt highly delighted with the idea of being able to send Mrs. Preston\r\nso agreeable a companion, and not a little vexed with my wife for not\r\nsharing my enthusiasm. When she returned to the parlor, I said:\r\n\r\n'Kate, why do you not like her?'\r\n\r\n'I can hardly tell _why_,' she replied, 'but my first impression is\r\nconfirmed. I would not trust her. Why does she go South for the same\r\nsalary she has had in New Hampshire?'\r\n\r\n'Because she wants to see the world; she's a stirring Yankee woman.'\r\n\r\n'No; because you told her of Mr. Preston's position in society; and\r\nbecause she hopes to win a plantation and a rich planter.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense,' I replied. 'You misjudge her.'\r\n\r\n'I tell you, Edmund, she is a cold, selfish, sordid woman; all\r\nintellect, and no heart. If I had never seen her face, I should have\r\nknown that by her voice, and the shake of her hand.'\r\n\r\nBut it was too late--I had engaged her; and at seven o'clock on the\r\nfollowing morning she was on her way to the South.\r\n\r\nI soon received information of her safe arrival at her destination, and\r\nthe warm thanks of Preston for having sent him so agreeable a person,\r\nand one so well fitted to instruct his children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe turpentine location was soon secured, and early in the following\r\nspring, Joe, with about a hundred 'prime hands,' commenced operations in\r\nthe new field. Constantly increasing shipments soon gave evidence of the\r\nenergy with which the negro entered upon his work; and by the end of the\r\nyear, Preston had not only paid the advances we made on receiving the\r\ndeed of the land, but also the note I had given for the purchase of\r\nPhyllis. For the first time in five years he was entirely out of our\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nThe next season he hired a force of nearly two hundred negroes, and\r\ngenerously gave Joe a small interest in the new business, with a view to\r\nthe black's ultimately buying his freedom. His transactions soon became\r\nlarge and profitable both to him and to us. Shortly afterward he paid\r\noff the last of his floating debt, and his balances in our hands grew\r\nfrom nothing till they reached five and seven and often ten thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nBut heavy affliction overtook him in the midst of his prosperity. His\r\nwife and two eldest daughters were stricken down by a prevailing\r\nepidemic, and died within a fortnight of each other. A letter which I\r\nreceived from him at this time, will best relate these events. It was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND:--I have sad, very sad news to tell you. A week ago\r\n     to-day I followed the remains of my beloved wife to the grave.\r\n     Overcome by watching with our children, and grief at their loss,\r\n     about three weeks since she took their disease, and sinking\r\n     rapidly, soon resigned her spotless spirit to the hands of her\r\n     MAKER. Overwhelmed by this treble affliction, I have not been able\r\n     to write you before. Even now I can hardly hold a pen. I am\r\n     perfectly paralyzed; I can neither act nor think--I can only\r\n     _feel_.\r\n\r\n     You, who have seen her in our home, can realize what she was to my\r\n     family, but none can know what she was to me: companion, friend,\r\n     guide! My stay and support through long years of trial, she is\r\n     taken from me just as prosperity is dawning on me, and I was hoping\r\n     to repay, by a life of devotion, some part of what she had borne\r\n     and suffered on my account. Another angel has been welcomed in\r\n     heaven, but I am left here alone--alone with my grief and my\r\n     remorse!\r\n\r\n     My son is inconsolable, and even little Selly seems to realize the\r\n     full extent of her loss. The poor little thing will not leave me\r\n     for a moment. She is now the only comfort I have. Miss Walley has\r\n     been unremitting in her kindness and attention, taking the burden\r\n     of everything upon herself. Indeed, I do not know what I should\r\n     have done without her.\r\n\r\n     Time may temper my affliction, but _now_, my dear friend, I am not\r\n\r\n          ROBERT PRESTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing worthy of special mention occurred to the persons whose history\r\nI am relating till about a year after the death of Mrs. Preston. Then,\r\none day late in the autumn, I received information of her husband's\r\napproaching marriage with the governess. In the letter which invited me\r\nto be present at the ceremony, Preston said: 'No one can ever fill the\r\nplace in my heart that is occupied, and ever will be occupied by the\r\nmemory of my sainted wife; but Miss Walley has rendered herself\r\nindispensable to me and my family. My studious habits and ignorance of\r\nbusiness made me, as you know, even in my full health and strength, a\r\npoor manager; and during the past year, grief has so broken my spirits\r\nthat I have been utterly unfitted for attending to the commonest duties.\r\nBut for Miss Walley, everything would have gone to waste and ruin. With\r\nthe efficiency of a business man, she has attended to my household,\r\noverseen my plantation, and managed my entire affairs. In the first\r\nmoments of my bereavement, when grief so entirely overwhelmed me that I\r\nsaw no one, I did not know to what censurious remark her disinterested\r\ndevotion to my interests was subjecting her; but recently I have\r\nrealized the impropriety of a young, unmarried woman occupying the\r\nposition she holds in my household. Miss Walley, also, has felt this,\r\nand some time since notified me, though with evident reluctance, that\r\nshe felt it imperatively necessary to leave my service. What, then,\r\ncould I do? My people needed a mistress; my children a mother. She was\r\nboth. Only one course seemed open, and after mature deliberation I\r\noffered her my hand, frankly stating that my heart was with the angel\r\nwho, lost to me here, will be mine hereafter. Satisfied with my\r\nfriendship and esteem, she has accepted me; and we are to be married on\r\nthe 26th inst.; when I most sincerely trust that you, my dear friend,\r\nand your estimable wife, will be present.\r\n\r\nThat night I took the letter home to my wife. She read it, and laying it\r\ndown, sadly said:\r\n\r\n'Oh, Edmund! He is, indeed, 'among the rocks!''\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo years went by, and I did not meet Preston, but our business\r\nrelations kept us in frequent correspondence, and his letters\r\noccasionally alluded to his domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nVery soon after his marriage with the governess, his son went to live\r\nwith his uncle, Mr. James Preston, of Mobile, a wealthy bachelor, who\r\nlong before had expressed the intention of having the boy succeed to his\r\nbusiness and estate. 'Boss Joe' continued in charge of the turpentine\r\nplantation, and had built him a house, and removed his wife and aged\r\nmother to his new home. On one of my visits to the South I stopped\r\novernight with him, and was delighted with his model establishment. Two\r\nhundred as cheerful-looking darkies as ever swung a turpentine axe, were\r\ngathered in tents and small shanties around his neat log cabin, and Joe\r\nseemed as happy as if he were governor of a province.\r\n\r\nHis operations had grown to such magnitude that Preston then ranked\r\namong the largest producers of the North Carolina staple, and his\r\n'account' had become one of the most valuable on our books. Though we\r\nsent 'account currents' and duplicates of each 'account sales' to his\r\nmaster, our regular 'returns' were made to Joe, and no one of our\r\ncorrespondents held us to so strict an accountability, or so often\r\nexpressed dissatisfaction with the result of his shipments, as he.\r\n\r\n'I thinks a heap of you, Mr. Kirke,' he said at the close of one of his\r\nletters about this time; 'but the fact am, thar's no friendship in\r\ntrade, and you _did_ sell that lass pile of truck jess one day too\r\nsudden.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTwo more years rolled away. Frank was nearly sixteen. He had grown up a\r\nfine, manly lad, and never for one moment had Kate or I regretted the\r\ncare we had bestowed on his education and training. He was all we could\r\nhave wished for in our own son, and in his warm love and cheerful\r\nobedience we both found the blessing invoked on us by his dying mother.\r\n\r\nHis affection for Kate was something more than the common feeling of a\r\nchild for a parent. With that was blended a sort of half worship, which\r\nmade him listen to her every word, and hang on her every look, as if she\r\nwere a being of some higher order than he. They were inseparable. He\r\npreferred her society to that of his young companions, and often, when\r\nhe was a child, seated by her knee, and listening, when she told of his\r\n'other mother' in the 'beautiful heaven,' have I seen his eye wander to\r\nher face with an expression, which plainly said: 'My heart knows no\r\n'other mother' than you.' Kate was proud of him, and well she might be,\r\nfor he was a comely youth; and his straight, closely knit, sinewy frame;\r\ndark, deepset eyes; and broad, open forehead, overhung with thick, brown\r\nhair; only outshadowed a beautiful mind, an open, upright, manly nature,\r\nwhose firm and steady integrity nothing could shake.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I received a letter from his father, which, as it had an\r\nimportant bearing on the lad's future career, I give to the reader:\r\n\r\n   BOSTON, _September 20th, 185-._\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--A recent illness has brought my past life in its true light\r\nbefore me. I see its sin, and I would make all the atonement in my\r\npower. I cannot undo the wrong I have done to one who is gone, but I can\r\ndo my duty to her child. You, I am told, have been a father to him. _I_\r\nwould now assume that relation, and make you such recompense for what\r\nyou have done, as you may require. I am too weak to travel, or indeed,\r\nto leave my house, but I am impatient to see my son. May I not ask you\r\nto bring him to me at once? Then I will arrange all things to your\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you, after saying what I have, that I should feel\r\ngreatly gratified to once more possess your confidence, and regard.\r\n\r\n   I am, sincerely yours,\r\n        JOHN HALLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another hand was the following postscript:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BOY:--John is sincere. Thee can trust him. He has told me _all_.\r\nHe will do the right thing. Come on with the lad as soon as thee can.\r\nLove to Kate. Thy old friend,\r\n\r\n   DAVID.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter conferring with my wife, I sent the following reply to these\r\ncommunications:\r\n\r\n   NEW YORK, _September 22d, 185-._\r\n\r\nDAVID OF OLD;--Thou man after the Lord's own heart. I have Hallet's\r\nletter, seasoned with your P.S. He is shrewd; he knew that nothing but\r\nyour old-fashioned hand would draw a reply from _me_, to anything\r\nwritten by _him_.\r\n\r\nI've no faith in sick-bed repentances; and none in John Hallet, sick or\r\nwell:\r\n\r\n   'When the devil was sick,\r\n   The devil a monk would be;\r\n   When the devil got well,\r\n   The devil a monk was he.'\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, as Hallet is capable of cheating his best friend, even the\r\ndevil, I will take his letter into consideration; but it having taken\r\nhim sixteen years to make up his mind to do a right action, it may take\r\nme as many days to come to a decision on this subject.\r\n\r\nFrank is everything to us, and nothing but the clearest conviction that\r\nhis ultimate good will be promoted by going to his father, will induce\r\nus to consent to it.\r\n\r\nI do not write Hallet. You may give him as much or as little of this\r\nletter as you think will be good for him.\r\n\r\nKate sends love to you and to Alice; and dear David, with all the love I\r\nfelt for you when I wore a short jacket, and sat on the old stool,\r\n\r\n   I am your devoted friend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a dingy old sign. It had hung there in sun and rain till its\r\nletters were faint and its face was furrowed. It had looked down on a\r\ngeneration that had passed away, and seen those who placed it there go\r\nout of that doorway never to return; still it clung to that dingy old\r\nwarehouse, and still Russell, Rollins & Co. was signed in the dingy old\r\ncounting room at the head of the stairway. It was known the world over.\r\nIt was heard of on the cotton fields of Texas, in the canebrakes of\r\nCuba, and amid the rice swamps of Carolina. The Chinaman spoke of it as\r\nhe sipped his tea and plied his chopsticks in the streets of Canton, and\r\nthe half-naked negro rattled its gold as he gathered palm oil and the\r\ncopal gum on the western coast of Africa. Its plain initials, painted in\r\nblack on a white ground, waved from tall masts over many seas, and its\r\nsimple 'promise to pay,' scrawled in a bad hand on a narrow strip of\r\npaper, unlocked the vaults of the best bankers in Europe. And yet it was\r\na dingy old sign! Men looked up to it as they passed by, and wondered\r\nthat a cracked, weather-beaten board, that would not sell for a dollar,\r\nshould be counted 'good for a million.'\r\n\r\nIt was a dingy old warehouse, with narrow, dark, cobwebbed windows, and\r\nwide, rusty iron shutters, which, as the bleak October wind swept up old\r\nLong Wharf, swung slowly on their hinges with a sharp, grating creak. I\r\nheard them in my boyhood. Perched on a tall stool at that old desk, I\r\nused to listen, in the long winter nights, to those strange, wild cries,\r\ntill I fancied they were voices of the uneasy dead, come back to take\r\nthe vacant seats beside me, and to pace again, with ghostly tread, the\r\nfloor of that dark old counting room. They were a mystery and a terror\r\nto me; but they never creaked so harshly, or cried so wildly, as on that\r\nOctober night, when for the first time in nine years I turned my steps\r\nup the trembling old stairway.\r\n\r\nIt was just after nightfall. A single gas burner threw a dim, uncertain\r\nlight over the old desk, and lit up the figure of a tall, gray-haired\r\nman, who was bending over it. He had round, stooping shoulders, and\r\nlong, spindling limbs. One of his large feet, encased in a thick,\r\nsquare-toed shoe, rested on the round of the desk; the other, planted\r\nsquarely on the floor, upheld his spare, gaunt frame. His face was thin\r\nand long, and two deep, black lines under his eyes contrasted strangely\r\nwith the pallid whiteness of his features. His clothes were of the\r\nfashion of those good people called 'Friends,' and had served long as\r\nhis 'Sunday best' before being degraded to daily duty. They were of\r\nplain brown, and, though not shabby, were worn and threadbare, and of\r\ndecidedly economical appearance. Everything about him, indeed, wore an\r\neconomical look. His scant coat tails, narrow pants, and short waistcoat\r\nshowed that the cost of each inch of material had been counted, while\r\nhis thin hair, brushed carefully over his bald head, had not a lock to\r\nspare; and even his large, sharp bones were covered with only just\r\nenough flesh to hold them comfortably together. He had stood there till\r\nhis eye was dim and his step feeble, and though he had, for twenty\r\nyears--when handing in each semiannual trial balance to the head of the\r\nhouse--declared that was his last, everybody said he would continue to\r\nstand there till his own trial balance was struck, and his earthly\r\naccounts were closed forever.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, he turned his mild blue eye upon me, and, taking my hand\r\nwarmly in his, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'My dear boy, I am glad to see thee!'\r\n\r\n'I am glad to see _you_, David. Is Alice well?'\r\n\r\n'Very well. And Kate, and thy babies?'\r\n\r\n'All well,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Thee has come to see John?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. How is he?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, better; he got out several days ago. He's inside now,' and opening\r\nthe door of an inner office, separated from the outer one by a glass\r\npartition, he said, 'John, Edmund is here.'\r\n\r\nA tall, dark man came to the door, and, with a slightly flurried and\r\nembarrassed manner, said:\r\n\r\n'Ah, Mr. Kirke! I'm glad to see you. Please step in.'\r\n\r\nAs he tendered me a chair, a shorter and younger gentleman, who was\r\nwriting at another desk, sprang from his seat, and slapping me\r\nfamiliarly on the back, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow, how are you?'\r\n\r\n'Very well, Cragin; how are _you_?' I replied, returning his cordial\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n'Good as new--never better in my life. It's good for one's health to see\r\nyou _here_.'\r\n\r\n'I have come at Mr. Hallet's invitation.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know, Hallet has told me you've a smart boy you want us to take.\r\nSend him along. Boston's the place to train a youngster to business.'\r\n\r\nThe last speaker was not more than thirty, but a bald spot on the top of\r\nhis head, and a slight falling-in of his mouth, caused by premature\r\ndecay of the front teeth, made him seem several years older. He had\r\nmarked but not regular features, and a restless, dark eye, that opened\r\nand shut with a peculiar wink, which kept time with the motion of his\r\nlips in speaking. His clothes were cut in a loose, jaunty style, and his\r\nmanner, though brusque and abrupt, betokened, like his face, a free,\r\nfrank, whole-souled character. He was several years the junior of the\r\nother, and as unlike him as one man can be unlike another.\r\n\r\nThe older gentleman, as I have said, was tall and dark. He had a high,\r\nbold forehead, a pale, sallow complexion, and wore heavy gray whiskers,\r\ntrimmed with the utmost nicety, and meeting under a sharp, narrow chin.\r\nHis face was large, his jaws wide, and his nose pointed and prominent,\r\nbut his mouth was small and gathered in at the corners like a rat's;\r\nand, as if to add to the rat resemblance, its puny, white teeth seemed\r\nborrowed from that animal. There was a stately precision in his manner\r\nand a stealthy softness in his tread not often seen in combination,\r\nwhich might have impressed a close observer as indicative of a bold,\r\npompous, and yet cunning character.\r\n\r\nThese two gentlemen--Mr. Hallet and Mr. Cragin--were the only surviving\r\npartners of the great house of Russell, Rollins & Co.\r\n\r\n'Have you brought him with you?' asked Hallet, his voice trembling a\r\nlittle, and his pale face flushing slightly as he spoke.\r\n\r\n'No, sir,' I replied; 'I thought I would confer with you first. I have\r\nnot yet broached the subject to the lad.'\r\n\r\nSome unimportant conversation followed, when Hallet, turning to Cragin,\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n'Are all the letters written for tomorrow's steamers?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Cragin, rising; 'and I believe I'll leave you two together.\r\nAs you've not spoken for ten years, you must have a good deal to say.\r\nCome, David,' he called out, as he drew on his outside coat, 'let's go.'\r\n\r\n'No, don't take David,' I exclaimed; 'I want to talk with the old\r\ngentleman.'\r\n\r\n'But you can see him to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'No, I return in the morning.'\r\n\r\n'Well, David, I'll tell Alice you'll be home by nine.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that's it,' I said, laughing. 'It's Alice who makes you leave so\r\nearly on steamer night.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, _sir_; Alice that _is_, and Mrs. Augustus Cragin that is _to\r\nbe_--when I get a new set of teeth. Good night,' and saying this, he\r\ntook up his cane, and left the office.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Hallet said to me:\r\n\r\n'Do you desire to have David a witness to our conversation?'\r\n\r\n'I want him to be a _party_ to it. We can come to no arrangement without\r\nhis coöperation.'\r\n\r\nHallet asked the bookkeeper in. When he was seated, I said:\r\n\r\n'Well, Mr. Hallet, what do you propose to do for your son?'\r\n\r\n'To treat him as I do my other children. Do all but acknowledge him.\r\nThat would injure _him_.'\r\n\r\n'That is not important. But please be explicit as to what you will do.'\r\n\r\n'David tells me that his inclinations tend to business, and that you\r\nhave meant to take him into your office. I will take him into _mine_,\r\nand when he is twenty-one, if he has conducted himself properly, I will\r\ngive him an interest.'\r\n\r\n'I shall be satisfied with no _contingent_ arrangement, sir. I know\r\nFrank will prove worthy of the position.'\r\n\r\n'Very well; then I will agree definitely to make him a partner when he\r\nis of age.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Mr. Hallet, if Frank will consent to come, I will agree to that\r\nwith certain conditions. I told his mother, when she was dying, that I\r\nwould consider him my own child; therefore I cannot give up the control\r\nof him. He must regard me and depend on me as he does now. Again, I\r\ncannot let him come here, and have no home whose influence shall protect\r\nhim from the temptations which beset young men in a large city. David\r\nmust take him into his family, and treat him as he treated me when I was\r\na boy, and--this must be reduced to writing.'\r\n\r\nHallet showed some emotion when I spoke of Frank's mother, but his face\r\nsoon assumed its usual expression, and he promptly replied:\r\n\r\n'I will agree to all that, but I would suggest that the fact of his\r\nbeing my son should not be communicated to him; that it be confined to\r\nus three. I ask this, believe me, only for the sake of my family.\r\n\r\n'I see no objection to that, sir, and I think, Frank, for his own sake,\r\nshould not know what his prospects are.'\r\n\r\nHallet signified assent, and turning to David, I asked:\r\n\r\n'David, what do _you_ say? Will you take him?'\r\n\r\n'I will,' said the old bookkeeper, showing in his expenditure of breath\r\nthe close economy which was the rule of his life.\r\n\r\n'Nothing remains but to arrange his salary and the share he shall have\r\nwhen he becomes a partner,' I remarked to Hallet.\r\n\r\n'Will an average of seven hundred a year, and an eighth interest when\r\nhe's twenty-one, be satisfactory?'\r\n\r\n'Entirely so. An eighth in your house will be better than a quarter in\r\nours. As it is now all understood, let David draw up the papers. We will\r\nsign them, and leave them with him till I see Frank.'\r\n\r\n'Very well. David, please to draw them up,' said Hallet; and then, his\r\nvoice again trembling a little, he added, 'All is understood, Mr. Kirke,\r\nbut the compensation I shall make you for your fatherly care of my much\r\nneglected son. Money cannot pay for such service, but it will relieve me\r\nto reimburse you for your expenditures.'\r\n\r\n'I have had my pay, sir, in the love of the boy. I ask no more.'\r\n\r\nHallet was sensibly affected, but without speaking, he turned to the\r\ndesk, and took down his bankbook. In a few moments he handed me a check.\r\nIt was for five thousand dollars. I took it, and, hesitating an instant,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'I will keep this, sir; not for myself, but for Frank. It may be of\r\nservice to him at some future time.'\r\n\r\n'Keep it for yourself, sir, not for him. He will not need it. He shall\r\nshare equally with my other children.'\r\n\r\n'I am glad to see this spirit in you, sir. Frank will be worthy of all\r\nyou may do for him.'\r\n\r\n'It is not for _his_ sake that I will do it,' replied Hallet, his voice\r\ntremulous with emotion; 'it is that I may have the forgiveness of the\r\none I--I--' He said no more, but leaning his head on his hand, he wept!\r\n\r\nIf there is joy among the angels over one that repents, was there not,\r\nthen, forgiveness in _her_ heart for _him_?\r\n\r\nNo one spoke for some minutes; then David rose, and handing me one of\r\nthe papers, laid the other before Hallet.\r\n\r\n'This appears right,' I said, after reading it over carefully.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' replied Hallet, taking up a pen and signing the other. Passing it\r\nto me, he added: 'Keep them both--take them now.'\r\n\r\n'But Frank may not wish to come.'\r\n\r\n'Then I will find some other way of helping him. He is my son! Take the\r\npapers.'\r\n\r\n'Well, as you say,' I replied. 'David, please to witness this.'\r\n\r\nHallet pressed me to pass the night at his house, but I declined, and\r\nrode out to Cambridge with the old bookkeeper. With many injunctions to\r\nwatch carefully over Frank, I left him about twelve o'clock, rode into\r\ntown with Cragin, and the next morning started for New York.\r\n\r\nThat night, as I recounted the interview to Kate, I said:\r\n\r\n'I never did believe in these double-quick conversions; but Hallet _is_\r\nan altered man.'\r\n\r\n'Then, indeed, can the leopard change his spots.'\r\n\r\nAs usual, her womanly intuitions were right; my worldly wisdom was\r\nwrong!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nNot long after the events I have just related, the mail brought me the\r\nfollowing letter from Preston:\r\n\r\nMY VERY DEAR FRIEND:--Circumstances, which I cannot explain by letter,\r\nrender it _imperatively_ necessary that I should provide another home\r\nfor my daughter. Her education has been sadly neglected, and she should\r\nbe where she can have experienced tutors, and good social surroundings.\r\nWith her delicate organization, and sensitive and susceptible nature,\r\nshe needs _motherly_ care and affection, and I shrink from committing\r\nher to the hands of strangers. I should feel at rest about her only with\r\n_you_. You have been my steadfast friend through many years; you have\r\nstood by me in, sore trials--may I not then ask you to do me now a\r\ngreater service than you have ever done, by receiving my little daughter\r\ninto your family? I know this is an unusual, almost presumptuous\r\nrequest; but if you knew her as she is--gentle, loving, obedient--the\r\nlight and joy of all about her, I am sure you, and your excellent lady,\r\nwould love her, and be willing to make her the companion of your\r\nchildren. She is my only earthly comfort, and it will rend my heart to\r\npart with her, but--I _must_.\r\n\r\nWrite me at once. You are yourself a father--_do not refuse me_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo this, on the next day, I sent the following reply:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND:--I would most cheerfully take your daughter into my\r\nfamily, did my wife's health, which has been failing all the summer,\r\nallow of her assuming any additional care.\r\n\r\nI think, however, I can provide Selma with a home equally as good as my\r\nown; one where good influences will be about her, and she will have the\r\nbest educational advantages. I refer to the family of Mr. David Gray, of\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts. He was my father's friend. The years I was a\r\nboy with Russell, Rollins & Co., I was an inmate of his house, and my\r\nadopted son, Frank, is now in his care. His daughter Alice is a most\r\nsuitable person to have charge of a young girl. She is like a sister to\r\nme, and to oblige me, would no doubt take Selma.\r\n\r\nPlease advise me of your wishes; and believe, my dear friend, I will do\r\nall in my power to serve you.\r\n\r\nI was sitting down at supper, one evening, about a fortnight after\r\nsending this letter, when a gentleman was announced as wishing to see\r\nme. I rose and went into the parlor. It was Preston, and with him was\r\nSelma, then a beautiful little girl of about eleven years.\r\n\r\nAsking Preston to lay aside his outside coat, I was struck by his\r\naltered appearance. It was four years since we had met, but looking at\r\nhim, I imagined it might be ten. His eyes were sunken, deep furrows were\r\nabout his mouth, and his brown hair was thickly streaked with gray.\r\n\r\n'My dear friend,' I exclaimed, as I grasped his hand a second time, 'you\r\nare not well!'\r\n\r\n'I am as well as usual, Kirke. Time has not done this!'\r\n\r\nFatigued with the long journey, Selma had retired, and our own little\r\nones were in bed, when Kate joined us in the parlor.\r\n\r\n'You _do_ look ill, Mr. Preston,' she said, seating herself beside him.\r\n'You must stay a while with us, and rest.'\r\n\r\n'I would be glad to stay here, madam--anywhere away from home.'\r\n\r\n'The care of two plantations, such as yours, must be a burden!'\r\n\r\n'It is not that, madam; Joe relieves me entirely from oversight of one\r\nof them. My difficulty is at home--mine is not what yours is.'\r\n\r\nKate's sympathizing words soon drew him out (she has a way of winning\r\nthe confidence of people, and is the depositary of more family secrets\r\nthan any other woman in the State); and he told us what his home had\r\nbecome since his union with the governess.\r\n\r\nWithin two months after the marriage her real character began to display\r\nitself, and she soon developed into a genuine Xantippe. Getting control\r\nof Mulock, who had been made overseer, she had the negroes dreadfully\r\nwhipped and overworked; she treated young master Joe so badly that the\r\nlad rebelled, and in his father's absence ran away to his uncle at\r\nMobile; and locking Selma up in a dark room without food, or beating her\r\ntill her back was actually discolored, she made the child's home\r\nintolerable to her.\r\n\r\nAfter master Joe went away, no one dared complain; and shut up in his\r\nlibrary, brooding over his still fresh grief for the death of his wife,\r\nPreston knew nothing of the real state of affairs till more than a year\r\nhad elapsed. Then one day he found Selma in tears. He questioned her,\r\nand learned the whole. A scene followed, in which Mrs. Preston asserted\r\nher rights as mistress of the plantation, and defied him. She had run\r\ninto all sorts of extravagance, the yearly bills which had come in a\r\nshort time previous were appallingly large, but to secure peace, Preston\r\nconsented to buy and furnish a winter residence at Newbern. To that she\r\nhad removed, but with the coming spring she would return to the\r\nplantation, and in the mean time Selma must be provided with another\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n'Feel no anxiety about her, sir,' said Kate, as he concluded; 'if Alice\r\nGray will not take her, we will.'\r\n\r\n'I thank you, madam; I cannot thank you enough for saying that,' replied\r\nPreston, his eyes filling with tears.\r\n\r\nI wrote at once to David, and soon received a letter from Alice\r\nconsenting to take charge of the little girl. Thanksgiving, at which\r\ntime Kate made annual visits to her early home, was approaching, and it\r\nwas decided that Selma should accompany her to Boston.\r\n\r\nThis being arranged, Preston, at the end of a fortnight, took leave of\r\nus, and returned to the South. The parting between the father and the\r\nchild gave evidence of what they were to each other. Preston wept like a\r\nwoman; but as Kate brushed back the brown curls from the broad forehead\r\nof little Selly, she raised her eyes to my wife's face, and while her\r\nthin nostrils dilated, and her sensitive chin slightly quivered, said;\r\n\r\n'I must not cry for poor papa's sake--it is so _very_ hard for him to go\r\nhome alone; and he will miss his little girl _so_ much.'\r\n\r\n'You are right, dear child,' said Kate, and, as if looking into the far\r\nfuture of the woman, and feeling that such a nature must suffer as well\r\nas enjoy keenly, she inwardly thanked God that with her delicate\r\norganization He had given her the unselfish and brave heart which those\r\nwords expressed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFour years had wrought great changes in David's quiet home. Alice had\r\nbecome Mrs. Augustus Cragin, and a little Alice tottled about the floor;\r\nbut after supper, David still found his evening cigar on the oak stand,\r\nhis needle-work slippers--wrought by Alice's own hand--in their place\r\nbefore the fender, and his big armchair rolled up close to the gas\r\nburner in the little back parlor at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nFrank was twenty, and had fulfilled all the promises of his boyhood. His\r\nfather, after the honeymoon of his repentance was over, showed no great\r\ninterest in him, but Cragin, who knew nothing of my arrangement with\r\nHallet, had given him all the advantages in his power.\r\n\r\nSelma was only fifteen, but, like the flowers of her own South, she had\r\nblossomed early, and was already a woman. Preston had visited her every\r\nsummer, but she never returned with him, having preferred passing her\r\nvacations at my house.\r\n\r\nIn David's loving household nothing had occurred to disturb her peaceful\r\nlife. Beloved by her teachers and schoolmates, she everywhere received\r\nthe homage due to her beauty and her goodness; and in the gay world into\r\nwhich her joyous nature often led her, she was the acknowledged and\r\n_unenvied_ queen! Her father had spared no pains in her education; the\r\nbest tutors had trained her fine ear and sweet voice, and taught her to\r\ngive form and coloring to the pictures her glowing imagination created;\r\nand, whether her fingers ran over the keys of a musical instrument, or\r\nwielded the brush, there was a delicacy and yet _spirit_ in her touch\r\nwhich were the wonder and admiration of all.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised, when visiting Boston about this time, to have Frank\r\ntell me that he loved her, and ask my consent to his regarding her as\r\nhis future wife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKate and I were to leave for home the following day, and, calling at the\r\noffice in the afternoon, I said to Frank:\r\n\r\n'I have tickets for the opera, including Selma; of course you'd like to\r\nhave her go.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, father; she has never been, and I have promised to take her this\r\nwinter. She'll be able now to appreciate it.'\r\n\r\nThe box I had selected was at a happy distance from the stage, and we\r\ngave Selma a front seat, that she might see to the best advantage. She\r\nwas in high spirits; indeed, she was radiant in her beauty. She wore a\r\ndark blue dress of silk, fitting closely to her neck, and its short\r\nsleeves allowed the plump, fair arms to half disclose themselves from\r\nbeneath the scarlet mantle Which fell around her shoulders. Her hair\r\nfell over her neck in the same simple fashion as in her childhood,\r\nexcept that the thick curls, which had lost their golden tint, and were\r\ndarker and longer, were looped back from her broad brow, with a few\r\nsimple flowers. There was the same contour of face and feature, but\r\nennobled by thought and culture; the same sensitive mouth, only that the\r\nlips were fuller and of a deeper color; and as she talked or listened,\r\nthe same rose tint deepened and faded beneath her rich, soft, dark skin,\r\nas sunlight shifts and fades across the evening sky. Her eyes, in whose\r\ndark depths the soul was reflected, met a stranger's calmly, but took a\r\nsoft look of loving trust when meeting Frank's. They were shaded by long\r\nlashes, as black as the night; and when the lids fell suddenly, as they\r\noften did, and her face became quiet, and almost sad, you felt that she\r\nwas communing with the angels.\r\n\r\nThe overture burst forth, and with glowing face, and eyes fixed upon the\r\nstage, Selma seemed lost to all but the enrapturing sounds; even Frank's\r\nwhispered words were unheeded. As the opera--'Lucia di\r\nLammermoor'--proceeded, I saw that every eye was attracted to our box,\r\nand, bending forward to catch Selma's expression, I called Kate's\r\nattention to her. With her head thrown slightly back, a bright spot\r\nburning on either cheek, her breath suspended, the large tears coursing\r\nfrom her eyes, and motionless as a statue, she sat with her small hands\r\nclasped on the front of the box, as if entranced, and all unconscious of\r\nthe hundred eyes that were fixed upon her. I thought of the pictures I\r\nhad seen in the old galleries of Europe, but I said, 'Surely, art cannot\r\nequal nature!'\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, she took Frank's arm; I turned to question her, but\r\nKate said:\r\n\r\n'Let her alone; she cannot talk now.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe transactions of Russell, Rollins & Co. extended the world over; but,\r\nsince the death of Mr. Rollins, which occurred prior to Frank's going\r\nwith them, they had cultivated particularly the Southern trade, and\r\ntheir operations in cotton had grown to be enormous. They bought largely\r\nof that staple on their own account, and for some extensive\r\nmanufacturing establishments in England. Their purchases were mainly\r\nmade in New Orleans, and, to attend to this business, Hallet had passed\r\nthe winters in that city for several years.\r\n\r\nHis wealth had grown rapidly, and at the date of which I am writing, he\r\nranked among the 'solid men' of Boston. Cragin was not nearly so\r\nwealthy. Being on intimate terms with the latter, I remarked, as we were\r\nenjoying a cigar together one evening at David's, on the occasion of\r\nthe visit to which I have referred in the last chapter:\r\n\r\n'How is it, Cragin, that you pass for only a hundred thousand, when\r\nHallet is rated at a million?'\r\n\r\n'Because, Ned, I'm not worth any more.'\r\n\r\n'But how is that, when you have two fifths of the concern?'\r\n\r\n'Well, Hallet went into cotton like the devil some eight years ago; and\r\nI told him I wouldn't stand it; I like to feel the ground under me.\r\nSince then he has speculated on his own account--he and old Roye go it\r\nstrong, and I guess they've made some pretty heavy lifts.'\r\n\r\n'That's uncertain business.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, devilish uncertain; but somehow they manage always to hold winning\r\ncards. Hallet has told me his New Orleans operations have netted him\r\nfive hundred thousand.'\r\n\r\n'And that, with what he got by his wife, has rolled him into a\r\nmillionaire before he's forty-five! He's a lucky fellow.'\r\n\r\n'Lucky! I wouldn't stand in his boots. What goes up _may_ come down. He\r\nhas no peace. His wife's a hyena. She makes home too hot for him; and\r\nsomehow he's never easy. He walks about as if treading on torpedoes.\r\n\r\n'If you dislike speculation, why don't you increase your legitimate\r\nbusiness?'\r\n\r\n'Hallet's away so much, I can't do it. I'm glued to the old office. I\r\nshould have been in Europe half of the time the last three years, but I\r\nhaven't been able to get away.'\r\n\r\n'Why not send Frank? He's old enough now.'\r\n\r\n'I mean to, in the spring, and I'm d--d if he shan't be a partner soon,\r\nand take some of this load off my shoulders. But do you know that Hallet\r\nhas a decided dislike to him?'\r\n\r\n'No! On what account?' I exclaimed. I had met Hallet only twice during\r\nfour years, but on both occasions he had spoken favorably of his son.\r\nFrank himself had never alluded in other than respectful terms to his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know, and it makes no difference. I'm captain at this end\r\nof the towline, and I swear he shall go in.\r\n\r\n'As you feel so kindly toward Frank, I'll give him a chance to\r\nconciliate Hallet. I'll take him South this winter, and introduce him to\r\nour correspondents. With his address he ought to do something with them.\r\nWill you let him go?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, and be right down glad to have him. When do you start?'\r\n\r\n'About the middle of December.'\r\n\r\nA fortnight afterward, with Selma and Frank, I again visited Preston's\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas morning when we rode up the long, winding avenue, and\r\nhalted before the doorway of 'Silver Lake'--the new name which the\r\nYankee schoolmistress, aping the custom of her Yankee cousins, had\r\nbestowed on Preston's plantation. The day was mild and sunshiny, and the\r\nwhole population of the little patriarchate was gathered on the green in\r\nfront of the mansion, distributing Christmas presents among the negroes.\r\nWhen we came in sight, from behind the thick cluster of live oaks which\r\nbordered the miniature lake, the whole assemblage sent up a glad shout,\r\nand hurried up to welcome us. And such a welcome! As she sprang from the\r\ncarriage, Selma was caught in her father's arms, then in 'master Joe's,'\r\nand then, encircled by a cloud of dark beauties, each one vieing with\r\nthe others in boisterous expressions of affection, she was the victim of\r\nsuch a demonstration as would have done the heart of Hogarth good to\r\nwitness. In the midst of it a slight, delicate woman rushed from the\r\nhouse, and, crowding into the thick group around Selma, threw her arms\r\nabout her neck, and, nearly smothering her with kisses, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'My chile! my chile! I sees you at last!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Phylly!' said Selma, returning her caresses; 'and haven't I grown?\r\nI thought you wouldn't know me.'\r\n\r\n'Know you! Ain't you my chile--my own dear chile!' and pressing Selma's\r\ncheeks between her two hands, and gazing at her beautiful face for a\r\nmoment, she kissed her over and over again.\r\n\r\nMy arms had been nearly shaken off, when I noticed 'Boss Joe' limping\r\ntoward me, his head uncovered, and his broad face shining from out his\r\ngray wool like the full moon breaking through a mass of clouds.\r\n\r\n'How are you, old gentleman?' I exclaimed, grasping him warmly by the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n'Right smart! right smart, massa Kirke. Glad you'm come, sar.'\r\n\r\n'And you're home for Christmas?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sar. I'se come to see massa Robert, an' to tend to hirin' a new\r\ngang. But darkies 'am high dis yar, sar.'\r\n\r\n'How much are they?'\r\n\r\n'Well, dey ax, round yere, one fifty, an' 'spences dar an' back; an'\r\nit'm a pile, when you tink we hab used up 'most all de new trees.'\r\n\r\n'But you must have many second-year cuttings.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, right smart; but No. 2 rosum doan't pay at sech prices fur\r\ndarkies.'\r\n\r\nTurning to Preston in a moment, I said:\r\n\r\n'Do not let us interfere with the 'doin's'--it's just what we want to\r\nsee.'\r\n\r\n'Well, come, you folks,' said Joe, hobbling back to the green; 'leff us\r\ngwo on now.'\r\n\r\nPreston, Selma, and Phylly went into the house, but the rest of us\r\nfollowed the grinning group of Africans to the centre of the lawn, where\r\nseveral large packing boxes, and a long table, something like a\r\ncarpenter's bench, were piled high with a miscellaneous assortment of\r\ndry goods and groceries.\r\n\r\n'Now, all you dat hab heads, come up yere,' shouted Joe, seating himself\r\non the bench; 'but don't all come ter onst.'\r\n\r\nOne by one the men and boys filed past him, and, selecting a hat or cap\r\nfrom a couple of boxes near, he adjusted a covering to each woolly\r\ncranium that presented itself; interspersing the exercise with humorous\r\nremarks on their respective phrenological developments:\r\n\r\n'Pomp, you's made fur a preacher, shore. Dat dar head ob your'n gwoes up\r\njess like a steeple. I'll hab ter gib you a cap, Dave; you'm so big\r\nahind de yeres none ob dese hats'll fit, nohow. Jess show de back ob\r\nyou' head to any gemman, an' he'll say you'm one ob de great ones ob de\r\n'arth. None ob dese am big 'nuff fur you, Ally,' he continued, as a\r\ntall, well-clad mulatto man stepped up to him. 'You' bumps hab growed so\r\nsense you took to de swamp, dat nuffin'll cober you 'cept massa Robert's\r\nhat, or de gal Rosey's sunshade.'\r\n\r\nThe yellow man laughed, but kept on trying the hats. Finding one at last\r\nof suitable dimensions, he turned away to make room for another\r\ncandidate for cranial honors. As I caught a full view of his face, I\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Why, Ally, is that you?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa; it'm me,' he replied, making a respectful bow.\r\n\r\n'And you live here yet?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa. Hope you's well, massa?'\r\n\r\n'Very well; and your mother--how is she?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, she'm right smart, sar.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, I'se right smart; an' I'se bery glad ter see 'ou, massa,'\r\nsaid a voice at my elbow. It was Dinah, no longer clad in coarse\r\nosnaburg, but arrayed in a worsted gown, and a little grayer and a\r\nlittle bulkier than when I saw her eight years before.\r\n\r\n'Why, Dinah, how well you look!' I exclaimed, giving her my hand. 'And\r\nyou've come up to spend Christmas with Ally?'\r\n\r\n'No, massa, I _libs_ yere. I'se FREE now, massa!'\r\n\r\n'Free! So you've made enough to buy yourself? I'm glad to hear it.'\r\n\r\n'No, massa. Ally--de good chile--he done it, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Ally did it! How could he? He's not more than twenty now!'\r\n\r\n'No more'n he hain't, massa; but he'm two yar in massa Preston's swamp,\r\nwid a hired gang. Massa Preston put de chile ober 'em, an' gib him a\r\nhaff ob all he make, an' he'm doin' a heap dar, massa.'\r\n\r\n'And with his first earnings he bought his mother!'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa; wid de bery fuss.'\r\n\r\n'Ally, give me your hand,' I exclaimed, with unaffected pleasure;\r\n'you're a man! You're worthy of such a mother!'\r\n\r\n'Yas, he am dat, massa! He'm wordy ob anyting, an' he'm gwine to hab a\r\nwife ter day, massa. Boss Joe am gwine ter marry 'em, an' ter gib 'em\r\nhim own cabin fur dar Chrismus giff.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Joe _is_ a trump. I'll remember him in my will for that, aunty,\r\nsure.'\r\n\r\n'Dat'm bery good ob 'ou, massa; but I reckon 'ou can't tink who Ally'm\r\ngwine ter hab, massa,' said the old woman, her face beaming all over.\r\n\r\n'No, I can't, Dinah. Who is she?'\r\n\r\n'It'm little Rosey, dat 'ou buy ob de trader, massa; an' she'm de\r\npootiest little gal all roun' yere; ebery one say dat, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed! And they are to be married to-day?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa, ter day--dis evenin'. 'Ou'll be dar, woan't 'ou, massa?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, certainly I will.'\r\n\r\nThe old woman and Ally then mingled with the crowd of negroes, and I\r\nturned my attention once more to Joe's operations. The men had been\r\nsupplied with head gear, and the women were receiving their\r\nturbans--gaudy pieces of red and yellow muslin.\r\n\r\n'Now, all you boys an' gals,' shouted Joe, as he dealt out a\r\nhandkerchief to the last of the dusky demoiselles, 'you all squat on de\r\ngroun', an' shovel off you' shoes.'\r\n\r\nDown they went in every conceivable attitude, and, uncovering their\r\nfeet, commenced pelting each other with the cast-off leathers. When the\r\nsport had lasted a few minutes, Joe sang out:\r\n\r\n'Come! 'nuff ob dat; now ter bisness. Yere, you yaller monkeys (to\r\nseveral small specimens of copper and chrome yellow), tote dese 'mong\r\n'em.'\r\n\r\nThe young chattels did as they were bidden, and, as each heavy brogan\r\nwas fitted to the pedal extremity of some one of the darkies, the\r\nnewly-shod individual sprang to his feet, and commenced dancing about as\r\nif he were the happiest mortal in existence.\r\n\r\n'Dat'm it,' shouted Joe; 'frow up you' heels; an' some ob you gwo\r\nan' fotch de big fiddle. We'll hab a dance, an' show dese Nordern\r\ngemmen de raal poker.'\r\n\r\n'But we hain't hed de dresses--nor de soogar--nor de 'backer--nor none\r\nob de whiskey,' cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n'Shet up, you brack crows! You can't hab anudder ting till ye'se hed a\r\nhigh ole heel-scrapin'. Yere, massa Joe; you come up yere, an' holp me\r\nwid de 'strumentals,' said Boss Joe, grinning widely, and getting up on\r\nthe carpenter's bench.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, the 'big fiddle,' one or two smaller fiddles, and\r\nthree or four banjoes were brought out, and the two Joes, and several\r\nebony gentlemen, seating themselves on the boxes of clothing, began\r\ntuning the instruments. Soon 'Boss Joe' commenced sawing away with a\r\ngusto that might have been somewhat out of keeping with his gray hairs,\r\nhis sixty years, and his clerical profession. 'Massa Joe' and the others\r\nstriking in, the male and female darkies paired off two by two, and to a\r\nlively air began dancing a sort of 'cotillion breakdown.' Other dances\r\nfollowed, in which the little negroes joined, and soon the air rang with\r\nthe creak of the fiddles and the merry shouts of the negroes. In the\r\nmidst of it my arm was touched lightly, and, turning round, I saw Rosey\r\nand Dinah.\r\n\r\n'I'se got de little gal yere, massa,' said the latter, looking as proud\r\nas a hen over her first brood of chickens. 'She glad to see 'ou, massa.'\r\n\r\nI gave Rosey my hand, and made a few good-natured compliments on her\r\nbeauty and her tidy appearance. She had a simple, guileless expression,\r\nand met my half-bantering remarks with an innocent frankness that\r\ncharmed me. She was only sixteen, but had developed into a beautiful\r\nwoman. Her form was slight and graceful, with just enough _embonpoint_\r\nto give the appearance of full health; and her thin, delicate features,\r\nlarge, wide-set eyes, and clear, rosy complexion bore a strong\r\nresemblance to Selma's. It was evident they were children of the same\r\nfather; and yet, one was to be the wife of a poor negro, the other to\r\nmarry the son of a 'merchant prince.'\r\n\r\nAs the dancing concluded, Boss Joe's fiddle gave out a dying scream,\r\nand, turning to me, he sang out:\r\n\r\n'War dar eber sprightlier nigs dan dese, massa Kirke? Don't dey beat\r\nyou' country folks all holler?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, they do, Joe. They handle their heels as nimbly as elephants.'\r\n\r\nI spoke the truth; most of them did.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the presents was resumed; and, as each negro\r\nreceived his full supply of flour, sugar, tea, coffee, molasses,\r\ntobacco, and calico, grinning with joy over his new acquisitions, he\r\nstaggered off to his quarters. When the last box was nearly emptied,\r\nwith young Preston and Frank, I adjourned to the mansion.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the 'great house' was unchanged, but its interior had\r\nundergone a complete transformation. The plain oak flooring of the hall\r\nhad been replaced by porcelain tiling, and the neat, simple furniture of\r\nthe parlors by huge mirrors; rosewood and brocatelle sofas and lounges;\r\nvelvet tapestry carpets, in which one's feet sank almost out of sight;\r\nand immense paintings, whose aggregate cost might have paid off one half\r\nof the mortgage that encumbered the plantation.\r\n\r\nSelma and her father were engaged in earnest conversation when we\r\nentered the drawing room, and, being unwilling to interrupt them, I was\r\nabout to retire, but he rose, and said:\r\n\r\n'Come in, Kirke; I will call Mrs. Preston. She will be glad to see you.'\r\n\r\nThe lady soon entered. It was eight years since we had met, but time had\r\ntouched her gently. Her face wore its old, decided, yet quiet\r\nexpression, and her manner showed the easy self-possession I had noticed\r\nat our first interview. She was richly dressed, and had on a heavy satin\r\npelisse, and a blue velvet bonnet, as if about to ride out.\r\n\r\nWhen the usual greetings were over, she remarked:\r\n\r\n'You have been here some time, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, madam; we arrived about two hours ago; but I met some old friends\r\noutside, and the pleasure of seeing them has made me a little tardy in\r\npaying my respects to you.'\r\n\r\n'The negroes, you mean, sir,' she replied, with a slight toss of the\r\nhead, and a look of cool dignity which well became her.\r\n\r\n'Yes, madam. I have many friends among the blacks. On many plantations\r\nthey look for my coming as they do for Christmas.'\r\n\r\n'It is quite rare to find a white gentleman so fond of negroes,' she\r\nrejoined, with an air slightly more supercilious.\r\n\r\nI remembered her as the humble schoolmistress, whose entire possessions\r\nwere packed in one trunk; and, forgetting myself, said, in a tone which\r\nbore a slight trace of indignation:\r\n\r\n'More rare, I fear, than it should be; and you and I, madam, who are\r\nYankees, and have 'worked for a living,' surely cannot despise the\r\nnegroes because they are _compelled_ to work for theirs.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no, sir! not by any means! But you must excuse me; the carriage is\r\nwaiting to take me to church;' and, rising, she bowed herself stiffly\r\nout of the door.\r\n\r\n'Ah, you hit her there!' exclaimed Joe, springing to his feet in great\r\nglee, and striding to the window. 'See here, Mr. Kirke! See what a\r\nturnout the Yankee 'schulemarm' has worried out of father!'\r\n\r\n'My son, you must not speak so; she is your mother!' said Preston.\r\n\r\n'No, I'm d--d if she is! Call her anything but that, father; that's\r\nan--'he checked himself; but I thought he would have added--'insult to\r\nmy dead mother!'\r\n\r\nPreston made no reply.\r\n\r\nLooking out of the window, I saw Mrs. Preston being handed into a\r\nmagnificent barouche by one of the black gentry she so much despised.\r\nAnother one in gaudy gold livery sat on the box, and a mounted outrider,\r\nalso bound up in gold braid, stood behind the carriage.\r\n\r\n'There's a two-thousand-dollar turnout, and two fifteen-hundred-dollar\r\nniggers, to tote a woman who ought to go afoot. It's a poor investment,\r\nI swear,' said Joe, turning away from the window.\r\n\r\nPreston made no reply; but I laughingly remarked:\r\n\r\n'Come, Joe, she isn't _your_ wife. Let your father spend his money as he\r\npleases; he can afford it.'\r\n\r\n'He _can't_ afford it; that woman is running him to the devil at a\r\ntwo-forty gait. You have more influence with him than any one, Mr.\r\nKirke--_do_ try to stop it!'\r\n\r\nThe young man spoke in a decided but regretful tone, and his manner\r\nshowed more respect to his father than his words implied. Unwilling to\r\ninterfere in such an affair, I said nothing; but Preston, in a moment,\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n'It is true, Kirke! Her extravagance has ruined my credit at home, and\r\nforced me to use Joe's indorsements; besides, I have had to borrow ten\r\nthousand dollars of him to keep my head above water.'\r\n\r\n[Mr. James Preston--the Squire's uncle--had died the year before, and\r\nthe young man had succeeded to his large property and business.]\r\n\r\nI was thunderstruck; but, before I could reply, Joe said:\r\n\r\n'I don't care a rush for the money. Father can have every dollar I've\r\ngot; but I _do_ want to see him rid of that woman. I've been here sick\r\nfor two months, and I've seen the whole. She is worrying the very life\r\nout of him. She's made him an old man at forty.'\r\n\r\nIt was true. His face was lean and haggard, and his hair already thickly\r\nstreaked with white.\r\n\r\nPreston rose, and, walking the room, said:\r\n\r\n'But what am I to do? You yourself, Joe, would not have all this made\r\npublic. You've as much pride about it as I have.'\r\n\r\n'I've not a bit of pride about it, father; and it's public now.\r\nEverybody knows it, and everybody says you ought to cut her adrift.'\r\n\r\n'What had I better do? Tell me, my friend,' said Preston, still walking\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n'I cannot advise, you, Preston. An outsider should express no opinion on\r\nsuch matters.'\r\n\r\nIn a moment Preston said:\r\n\r\n'Well, Joe, no more of this now. I'll do what is right, however much it\r\nmay wound my pride.'\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned to other subjects, till Mrs. Preston's return\r\nfrom church, shortly after which dinner was announced. The lady presided\r\nat the table with as much ease and grace as if she had been born to the\r\nposition; and in her charming conversation, I almost forgot the\r\nrevelations of the morning. The rest of the day I spent with Joe and\r\nFrank, strolling over the plantation and mingling among the negroes,\r\nwho, freed from work, were enjoying themselves in a very 'miscellaneous\r\nmanner.' Preston remained at the house with Selma.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dark when we returned to the mansion. Looking in at the\r\nparlor, and not finding his father there, Joe led the way at once to the\r\nlibrary. The door was ajar, and, as we entered the passage way, loud\r\nvoices were issuing from it.\r\n\r\n'I tell you, Mr. Preston, I am mistress of this plantation. He shall NOT\r\ngo!'\r\n\r\n'Pardon me, madam, he _shall_, and to-night,' returned a mild but\r\ndecided voice, which I recognized as Preston's. Being unwilling to\r\noverhear more, I turned away, but Joe caught me by the arm, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n'If you are my father's friend, go in. If you don't, he will back down;\r\nhe has done so forty times.'\r\n\r\nPreston was a man of more than ordinary firmness, but his wife had the\r\nstronger will. She seemed possessed of a sort of magnetic power, which\r\nenabled her to control others almost arbitrarily.\r\n\r\nReluctantly I followed the young man into the room. Preston was seated\r\nbefore the fire; and Selma, with her arm around his neck, was standing\r\nnear him. Mulock, better clad than when I witnessed his purchase by the\r\n'fast' young planter, and wearing a sullen, dogged expression, was\r\nleaning against the centre table; and Mrs. Preston, gesticulating\r\nwildly, and her face glowing with mingled rage and defiance, stood\r\nwithin a few feet of her husband. Not heeding our entrance, she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n'I _will_ have my way. If you send him off, I will never darken your\r\ndoors again.'\r\n\r\n'That is as you please, madam,' replied Preston. 'Mr. Kirke and Frank,\r\npray be seated.'\r\n\r\nStung by her husband's coolness, the lady turned fiercely upon Joe, and,\r\nshaking her clenched hand in his face, cried out:\r\n\r\n'This is _your_ work. I will teach you better than to meddle with my\r\naffairs.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Madam, you act well,' said the young man, taking a step toward the\r\ndoor. 'Pray come out to the quarters; poor as they are, every negro will\r\ngive a bit to see _you_ play.'\r\n\r\nIn uncontrollable rage, she struck him a smart blow in the face, and\r\nrushed from the room.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone, Preston turned to Mulock:\r\n\r\n'Now go. The amount due you I shall retain to offset, in part, what you\r\nhave tempted the negroes to steal. You can come here once a week--on\r\nSunday--to see Phylly; but if you have any more dealings with the hands,\r\nI will prosecute you on the instant.'\r\n\r\nMulock rose, put on his slouched hat, and, a dull fire burning in his\r\ncold, snake-like eyes, slowly said:\r\n\r\n'Wall, Squire, I'll gwo, but 'counts 'tween you an' me ain't settled\r\nyit.'\r\n\r\nAs he went, Selma leaned forward, and, kissing Preston's cheek, said;\r\n\r\n'O father! I'm so glad _you_ didn't speak harshly to her.'\r\n\r\nPreston put his arm about her, and replied:\r\n\r\n'You helped me, my child. I should be a better, happier man, if you were\r\nwith me.'\r\n\r\n'And I will be, father; I won't go away any more.'\r\n\r\n'But Frank?' said Preston, again kissing her.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you know we're not to be married for a good while yet. I'll stay\r\nwith you _till then_, father.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! there she goes,' said Joe, looking out at the window, which\r\ncommanded a view of the _porte cochere_; 'she can't get to Newbern till\r\nten, but the night air won't hurt _her_.'\r\n\r\n'Then she makes Newbern her home now?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, she spends the winters there; she came here only yesterday.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAlly and Rosey were to be married[3] in the little church, and, directly\r\nafter supper, we all went to the wedding. The seats had been removed\r\nfrom the centre of the building, for, though duly consecrated to the use\r\nof the saints, the sinners were to exercise their heels in it after the\r\nceremony was over. At its farther extremity, the carpenter's bench of\r\nwhich I have spoken, elongated at both ends, and covered with a white\r\ntable cloth, was piled high with eatables; indicating that a time of\r\n'great refreshment' was at hand. The bounteous supply of ham, chicken,\r\nwild duck, roast pig, fish, hoecake, wheat bread, tea, coffee, milk, and\r\npumpkin and sweet-potato pies under which the bench groaned, showed that\r\nsome liberal hand had catered for the occasion.\r\n\r\nBlack Joe, dressed in his 'Sunday best,' was seated on the rustic settee\r\nat the back of the desk, and Phyllis and Dinah occupied chairs inside\r\nthe low railing, which faced the pulpit. Phyllis looked careworn and\r\nsad, but Ally's mother was as radiant as a brass kettle in a blaze of\r\nlight wood. She wore a white dress, stiffly starched and expanded by\r\nimmense hoops, and a crimped nightcap, whose broad border flapped about\r\nlike the wings of a crowing rooster; and she looked, for all the world,\r\nlike a black ghost in a winding sheet, escaped from below, and bound on\r\na 'good time generally.' Two 'shining lights,' on either side of the\r\npulpit, held aloft blazing torches of pine, which illuminated the sea of\r\ngrinning darkness, and sent up a smoke like that arising from the pit\r\nwhich is said to be bottomless. About a hundred darkies were present;\r\nand the number of glossy coats, fancy turbans, gaudy bonnets, red\r\nshawls, and flaming dresses, which the light disclosed, was amazing. The\r\npoor worm that grubbed in the earth, had appeared ('for that occasion\r\nonly') as a butterfly; and Lazarus, rid of his rags, had come forth\r\ndressed like a Broadway dandy.\r\n\r\nAny person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway;\r\nbut I elbowed through the woolly gathering, and followed Frank and Selma\r\nto the family pew. Tittering, laughing, and flaunting their red and\r\nyellow kerchiefs, the black people were enjoying themselves amazingly,\r\nwhen 'Dar dey comes,' 'Dar'm de happy pussons,' went round the\r\nassemblage, and the bride and groom, attended by two sable couples,\r\nentered the building. After some ludicrous mistakes, they got 'into\r\nposition' in front of the railing, and Black Joe took a stand before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nRosey was dressed in white, with a neat fillet of pink and blue ribbon\r\nabout her head; and Ally wore a black frock coat, with white vest, and\r\nwhite cotton gloves. One of the groomsmen--a rustic beau from a\r\nneighboring plantation--wore an immensely long-tailed blue coat with\r\nbrass buttons, a flaming red waistcoat, yellow woollen mittens, and a\r\nneckerchief that looked like a secession flag hugging a lamp-post. Both\r\nof these gentry had hats of stove-pipe pattern, very tall, and with\r\nnarrow brims; and--they wore them during the ceremony.\r\n\r\n'Silence in de meetin',' cried Joe.\r\n\r\nThe boisterous sea of black wool subsided to a dead calm. Those not\r\nalready standing rose, and Joe commenced reading the marriage service of\r\nthe Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\nThe parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons\r\nwell; for they made all the responses with great propriety; but some of\r\nthe congregation seemed less familiar with the service. When Joe\r\nrepeated the words, 'If any man kin show cause why dese folks should not\r\nbe lawfully jined togedder, leff him now speak, or else foreber hole\r\nhis peace,' Dinah turned to the audience, and cried out:\r\n\r\n'Yas, jess leff him come out wid it _now_. I'd like ter see de man dat's\r\ngot onyting agin it.'\r\n\r\nNo one appeared to have 'onyting agin it,' and Joe proceeded to read the\r\nwords: 'I require and charge you, if either of you know any impediment,'\r\netc. In the midst of it a voice called out:\r\n\r\n'Dar ain't no 'pedimen', Boss Joe; I knows dat. Gwo on, sar!' 'Dat's so,\r\nbrudder,' said another voice. 'Dat's de Lord's trufh,' echoed a third.\r\n'Doan't be 'sturbin' de meetin'; de young folks want de 'splicin' done,'\r\ncried a fourth; and 'Amen,' shouted a dozen.\r\n\r\n'Shet up, all on you,' yelled Joe, turning on them with an imperious\r\ngesture; 'ef you hain't no more manners dan dat, clar out.'\r\n\r\nSilence soon ensued, and Joe went on without interruption to the place\r\nwhere the minister asks the bride-groom: 'Wilt thou have this woman to\r\nthy wedded wife?' Then Dinah, unable to contain herself longer, joyfully\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Ob course he will--ony youn' feller'd be glad to hab _har_.'\r\n\r\n[Never having gone through the ceremony herself, the poor woman could\r\nnot be expected to know what was appropriate to the occasion.]\r\n\r\nNo further interruption occurred, and soon the happy couple were 'bone\r\nof one bone, and flesh of one flesh.' The assemblage still standing, Joe\r\nthen turned to Ally and Rosey, and, with a manner so solemn and\r\nimpressive that he seemed altogether a different person from the merry\r\ndarky who had entered so heartily into the 'high ole heel scrapin'' of\r\nthe morning; he spoke somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n'My chil'ren, love one anoder; bar wid one anoder; be faithful to one\r\nanoder. You hab started on a long journey; many rough places am in de\r\nroad; many trubbles will spring up by de wayside; but gwo on hand an'\r\nhand togedder; love one anoder; an' no matter what come onter you, you\r\nwill be happy--fur love will sweeten ebery sorrer, lighten ebery load,\r\nmake de sun shine in eben de bery cloudiest wedder. I knows it will, my\r\nchil'ren, 'case I'se been ober de groun'. Ole Aggy an' I hab trabbled de\r\nroad. Hand in hand we hab gone ober de rocks; fru de mud; in de hot,\r\nburnin' sand; ben out togedder in the cole, an' de rain, an' de storm,\r\nfur nigh onter forty yar, but we hab clung to one anoder; we hab loved\r\none anoder; and fru eberyting, in de bery darkest days, de sun ob joy\r\nan' peace hab broke fru de clouds, an' sent him blessed rays down inter\r\nour hearts. We started jess like two young saplin's you's seed a growin'\r\nside by side in de woods. At fust we seemed way 'part, fur de brambles,\r\nan' de tick bushes, an' de ugly forns--dem war our bad ways--war atween\r\nus; but love, like de sun, shone down on us, and we grow'd. We grow'd\r\ntill our heads got above de bushes; till dis little branch an' dat\r\nlittle branch--dem war our holy feelin's--put out toward one anoder, an'\r\nwe come closer an' closer togedder. And dough we'm old trees now, an'\r\nsometime de wind blow, an' de storm rage fru de tops, and freaten to\r\ntear off de limbs, an' to pull up de bery roots, we'm growin' closer an'\r\ncloser, an' nearer an' nearer togedder ebery day. And soon de old tops\r\nwill meet; soon de ole branches, all cobered ober wid de gray moss, will\r\ntwine round one anoder; soon de two ole trunks will come togedder and\r\ngrow inter _one_ foreber--grow inter one up dar in de sky, whar de wind\r\nneber'll blow, whar de storm neber'll beat; whar we shill blossom an'\r\nbar fruit to de glory ob de Lord, an' in His heabenly kingdom foreber!\r\n\r\n'Yas, my chil'ren, you hab started on a long journey, an' nuffin' will\r\ngit you fru it but _love_. Nuttin' will hole you up, nuffin' will keep\r\nyou faithful to one anoder, nuffin' will make you bar wid one anoder,\r\nbut love. None ob us kin lib widout it; but married folks want it most\r\nob all. Dey need it more dan de bread dey eat, de water dey drink, or de\r\nair dey breafe. De worle couldn't gwo on widout it. De bery sun would\r\ngwo out in de heabens but fur dat! An' shill I tell you why? You hab\r\nheerd massa Robert talk 'bout de great law dat make de apple fall from\r\nde tree, de rock sink in de water; dat bines our feet to de round 'arth\r\nso we don't drop off as it gwo fru de air; dat holes de sun an' de stars\r\nin dar 'pointed places, so dat, day after day, an' yar after yar, dough\r\ndey'm trabblin' fasser dan de lightnin' eber went, dey'm right whar dey\r\nshould be. He call it 'traction, an' all de great men call it so; but\r\ndat ain't de name! It am LOVE. It am GOD, fur GOD am love, an' love am\r\nGOD, an' love bines de whole creashun togedder! An' shill I tell you how\r\nit do it? Does you see dis hand? how I open de fingers; how I shet'm up;\r\nhow I rise de whole arm? Does you see dis foot, dat I does wid jess de\r\nsame? Does you see dis whole body, how I make it, in a twinklin', do\r\njess what I like? Now what am it dat make my hand move, an' my whole\r\n'body turn round so sudden, dat I'se only to say: 'Do it,' an' it'm\r\ndone? Why, it am ME. It'm _me_, dat libs up yere in de brain, an' sends\r\nmy _will_ fru ebery part--fru ebery siner, an' ebery muscle, an' ebery\r\nlittle jint, an' make'm all do jess what I like. Now man am made in de\r\nimage of GOD, an' dis pore, weak ole body am a small pattern ob de whole\r\ncreashun. Eberyting go on jess as _it_ do. Eberyting am held togedder,\r\nan' moved 'bout, jess as _it_ am--but it'm GOD dat move it, not me! He\r\nlibs up dar in de sky--which am His brain--wid de stars fur His hands,\r\nde planets fur His feet, an' de whole univarse fur His body; an' He\r\nsends His will--which am love--fru ebery part ob de whole, an' moves it\r\n'bout, an' make it do jess as He likes. So you see, it am my will sent\r\nfru ebery muscle, an' ebery little siner, dat moves my body; so it am\r\n_His_ will sent fru what de'stronomers an' de poets call de heabenly\r\nether, dat moves _His_ body--which am de 'arth, an' de sun, an' de\r\nstars, an' you an' me, an' ebery libin' ting in all creashun! His will\r\nmove 'em all; AN' HIS WILL AM LOVE! An' don't you see dat you can't do\r\nwidout His love? Dat it am de bery breaf ob life? Dat, ef it war tooken\r\n'way from you, fur jess one moment, you'd drop down, an' die, an' neber\r\ncome to life agin--no, not in dis worle, nor in any oder worle? It am\r\nso, my chil'ren; an' de more you hab ob dat love, de happier you'll be;\r\nde more you'll love one ander; de easier you'll gwo fru you' life--de\r\nmore joyfuller you'll meet you' deafh--de happier you'll be all fru de\r\nlong, long ages dat'm comin' in de great Yereafter! Den, O my chil'ren!\r\nLove God, Love one anoder! You can't be happy widout you love GOD, an'\r\nyou can't love Him widout you love one anoder!'\r\n\r\nWhen Joe had concluded, he saluted the bride in a manner that many\r\nanother sooty gentleman present would have been glad to imitate, and\r\nthen took a stand at the head of the supper table. An immense tureen,\r\nfilled with steaming oysters, was soon brought in and placed before him,\r\nand looking up, he said grace, in which he thanked Him who feedeth the\r\nravens for putting it into his master's heart to feed His other black\r\ncreatures, the darkies present on that occasion. He asked for his master\r\nmany a happy 'Chrismus down yere,' and an eternal 'Chrismus in heaben,'\r\nand he added: 'An' knowin' dat dou hatest long prayers, an' long faces,\r\nan' dose folks dat gwo 'bout grumblin', as ef dy happy 'arth war nuffin'\r\nbut a graveyard; may we enjoy dis feast an' dis day as dy true\r\nchil'ren--de chil'ren ob a good Fader, who am all joy an' all\r\ngladness--an' while we'm eatin' an' drinkin' an' dancin', may we make\r\nmerry in our hearts to _Thee_. Amen.'\r\n\r\nWhen he concluded, Preston stepped to his side, and taking the big\r\nladle from his hand, said:\r\n\r\n'Stand aside, Joe, you have done work enough for to-night;' and turning\r\nto 'we white folks' in the family pew, he added: 'If any man among you\r\nwould be master, let him now be the servant of all. Let him try his hand\r\nat the waiter business, and see if he can't throw these shady people\r\ninto the _shade_.'\r\n\r\nSelma, Frank, 'massa Joe,' and I went forward, and tying the negroes'\r\naprons about our waists, took appropriate places around the table.\r\n\r\n'Now all of you find seats,' cried Preston; and amid a hurricane of\r\ngiggling and merry laughter, the black people seated themselves on the\r\nfloor, on the platform, and on the row of benches ranged along the\r\nwalls. Preston proceeded to fill up the bowls with the savory stew, and\r\nwe dispensed the eatables among them, and for half an hour I witnessed\r\nas much enjoyment as often falls to the lot of black sinners in this\r\n'vale of tears.'\r\n\r\n'Now, ef dis doan't beat all,' exclaimed old Dinah, as I handed her a\r\nhuge chunk of gingerbread; 'ef 'ou ain't right smart at waitin', massa\r\nKirke, I'd like ter know it.'\r\n\r\n'Keep dark, ole 'ooman,' shouted Black Joe; 'doan't you say nuffin'\r\n'bout dat, or de traders'll be a hole ob him. He'd sell fur a right\r\nlikely hand, _shore_.'\r\n\r\n'I woan't do nuffin' but keep dark, Boss Joe,' rejoined Dinah, grinning\r\ntill her face opened from ear to ear. 'I'll hab 'ou know, sar, dat none\r\nbut white ladies paints!'\r\n\r\n'Good fur you, ole lady,' cried the preacher. 'After dat you'll gib me\r\nde pleasure ob your hand in de fuss dance.'\r\n\r\n'Ob course, I will, _mister_ Joe; an' ef 'ou'm tired ob de ole 'ooman,\r\nI'll gib 'ou my han' in anoder dance.'\r\n\r\n'No, you woan't, I doan't gwo fur second marridges,' rejoined Joe,\r\nlooking slyly at Preston; 'dey ain't made in heaben.'\r\n\r\n'No more' dey ain't,' said the old woman, heaving a long sigh, and also\r\nlooking at Preston.\r\n\r\n'You ain't a gwine to leff dese folks dance in de church, am you, Boss\r\nJoe?' asked a prim, demure-looking darky, in a black suit, with a white\r\nneckerchief and stiff shirt collar; probably some neighboring preacher.\r\n\r\n'I reckon so,' replied Joe, dryly.\r\n\r\n'An' _I_ reckons so, too, mister I scare-you-out (Iscariot),' cried the\r\nold negress. 'Ain't de planets de Lord's feet, an' doant dey dance! I\r\nreckons we ain't no better dan de Lord is; an' ef He mobes him feet,\r\n'ou'd better mobe 'our'n. _We_ b'lieve in sarvin' HIM wid our han's an'\r\nour feet, too; we does, mister I-scare-you-out.'\r\n\r\nShe did scare him out, for the 'pious gemman' left suddenly.\r\n\r\nWhen about all of the eatables had found their way down the\r\ncavernous--and ravenous--throats of the darkies, Boss Joe rose and\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n'Yere, you massa Joe, you pull off you' apern, an' take de big\r\nfiddle--I'm 'gaged fur de fuss dance.'\r\n\r\nYoung Preston seated himself on the platform, and several sable\r\ngentlemen with banjoes and fiddles took places beside him.\r\n\r\n'Now all you men folks s'lect you' pardners,' cried the preacher, taking\r\nDinah by the hand, and leading her out to the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nThey all paired off, the fiddles broke into a merry tune, and soon the\r\nlittle church, which had so often echoed with the groans of the saints,\r\nshook with the heels of the sinners. When the first dance was over, Boss\r\nJoe again called out:\r\n\r\n'Now, massa Joe, strike up de waltz--Dinah an' I am gwine to show dese\r\nfolks some highfalutin dancin'.'\r\n\r\nThe waltz struck up, and off they whirled; Dinah went into it as if she\r\nwere working for pay, and as Joe held her closely in his arms, her wide\r\nhoops expanded till she looked like a topsail schooner scudding under\r\nbare poles.\r\n\r\nAs Joe was wiping the perspiration from his face, at the end of the\r\nwaltz, an old negro entered, and whispered something in his ear. Joe's\r\ncountenance fell in an instant, and, without saying a word, he left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n'Massa Joe,' relinquishing the big fiddle, then took the floor with\r\nRosey, and gave the audience a genuine breakdown. His heels bobbed\r\naround like balls at a cricket match, and Rosey's petticoats fluttered\r\nabout like the contents of a clothes line caught out in a hurricane. A\r\nbetter-looking couple were never seen in a ball room.\r\n\r\n'He's a natural born darky,' said his father, laughing; 'he takes to\r\ndancing as a duck takes to water.'\r\n\r\nA general dance followed. In the midst of it the old negro who had\r\ncalled Joe out, again came in, and making his way to where Preston and I\r\nwere standing, said, in a low tone:\r\n\r\n'Massa Robert, Ole Jack am dyin'; will 'ou come?'\r\n\r\n'Dying!' exclaimed Preston. 'Yes, I'll be there at once. Kirke, you\r\nremember the old man--come with me.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This was the conjuror's bag of the Africans.

Of the tremendous inconsistency and\r\ndestructiveness which such miracles imply, they take no heed. The most\r\nunpalatable fact in physics is that of the Struggle for Life.\r\n\r\nIdeas once born may never die, but it is worth noting how many men must\r\ndie ere their ideas can live. The Indo-Germanic race has always been\r\nblessed with many of those self-cursed martyrs, the Anticipators, or the\r\nmen who have outstripped their age. Like the advance guard of the summer\r\nswallows, they have generally died by frosts and lived in fables.\r\n\r\nGermany is very proud of her Berchthold Schwartz, and in her pride has\r\nmade a proverb declaring that his invention was the proof of supreme\r\nwisdom. When they describe a fool, they say there that he did not\r\ndiscover gunpowder. But 'the first handful of gunpowder' did not, as\r\nCarlyle claims, drive Monk Schwartz's pestle through the ceiling. Long\r\nbefore Schwartz, lived Bacon; and a century or so before Bacon, there\r\nwere in existence Norman-Latin recipes, says Palsgrave--who had seen\r\nthem--_ad faciendum le craké_, for making firecrackers--at least, for\r\nmaking gunpowder which would crack merrily when fired. Stained glass\r\nwindows, according to the cheap and easy explanations of those who used\r\nto send us to natural scenery for every origin in architecture, were\r\nsuggested by beholding the winter sunset lines of the sky through the\r\nbare gothic-window tracery of a leafless forest. Recent research finds\r\nthe stained window in the antique burning East, where no studies were\r\nmade by frost or forest light--nay, the leaves carved by\r\ntradition-loving Gothic Free Masons in churches often keep a peculiar\r\nEastern form.\r\n\r\nI am not, however, lecturing of Lost Arts in the strain which sings\r\n'there is nothing new under the sun,' and which in a chilling manner\r\nbenumbs the faith in progress by shaking with a grin before the wearied\r\ninventor some skeleton puppet of buried ages, which resembles his great\r\nthought as a hut resembles a palace. On the contrary, I find in this\r\nstrange frequency of anticipation among Indo-Germanic races, and in its\r\npremature failures, a vast proof of inventive vitality and of promise of\r\ngreat rising truths into all future ages. 'Steam power is nothing new,'\r\nsay the advocates of the genius of the past. Hero of Alexandria invented\r\na steam toy--as he who can read his _Spiritalia_ published by the\r\nJesuits in 1693 may learn for himself. But the power now roaring and\r\nwhizzing all over the world, and which would build every pyramid and\r\nevery monument of Egypt now extant in twenty-four hours, is no toy. When\r\nI think of this, there is no ingenious trifle for amusement which does\r\nnot inspire a droll awe. Possibly those walking dolls now performing\r\ntheir weary pilgrimages on level glass-pane floors in Broadway\r\nwindows--gravely lifting those enormous gilded boots, which remind me of\r\nMiss Kilmansegg and Queen Berta _à grands piés_, in one--have a good\r\nreason for their dignity of gait. For may they not be golden-footed and\r\nsolemn, like her who rose from the waves of old to prophesy to her\r\nson?--and if she was _silver_-footed, it makes no difference, for so are\r\nsome of the _autoperiper_--nay, _that_ word finishes me, and I go no\r\nfurther. Such a block of Greek would bring even a German sentence down\r\nwith a crash to a verbless conclusion. What I would have said was, that\r\nit may be that these dolls are heralds of greater dolls yet to come,\r\nwhich shall be wound up to fetch and carry, to sew on buttons--nay, it\r\nis even possible (in the wildest of dreams) that they may be made to\r\nboil potatoes properly. And I have been told that a recent improvement\r\nin boys' rocking horses, by means of which a trotting motion is given to\r\nthe legs of those docile animals, has suggested to a mechanic of this\r\ncity the construction of a very good automatic steed, whose only fault\r\nis slowness. May I suggest that a very great improvement indeed may yet\r\nbe made on that horse, and that the two-forty of a coming generation may\r\nbe the result, not of oats and hay, but of steel springs and cylinders?\r\nThe first wooden horse burnt Troy--what will the last do?\r\n\r\nI have been reminded of the strange tendency in man--but more especially\r\nof the Indo-Germanic or Aryan man--to anticipate by invention the wants\r\nof an age, sometimes centuries beforehand--by turning over that very\r\ncurious work, the 'Century of Inventions,' by the Marquis of Worcester,\r\nin which, as in the commonplace book of an author, one may find jotted\r\ndown many an undeveloped idea of great promise. In this connection we\r\nmay be allowed to borrow somewhat from a biography by Charles F.\r\nPartington, published in 1825.\r\n\r\nEdward Lord Herbert, the sixth earl and second Marquis of Worcester, was\r\nborn at Ragland near Monmouth; and his family, long distinguished for\r\nthe most devoted loyalty, possessed the largest landed estate of any\r\nthen attached to the British court. What this was in those times is set\r\nforth by the fact that in 1628 the father of the marquis had a revenue\r\nof upward of twenty thousand pounds. In 1642, the year in which his son\r\nwas created marquis, the young heir raised, supported, and commanded an\r\narmy of 1,500 foot and near 500 horse soldiers.\r\n\r\nHe had a stormy life before him, this young marquis, with many more\r\nscenes, adventures, and changes than are to be found in Woodstock and\r\nPeveril of the Peak. How he fought well, recapturing Monmouth among\r\nother things from the Puritan General Massey, how he was appointed, in\r\nconsequence of his daring cavaliering raids, by Charles II to negotiate\r\nwith the Irish Catholics; how the king often visited him at Ragland, is\r\nall a fine story, well worth reading. We can get glimpses of that REGAL\r\nlife--as Mr. Partington admiringly small-caps his climax, from the 'list\r\nof the Ragland household' with the earl's order of dining--castle gates\r\nclosed at eleven o'clock in the morning, the entry of the earl with a\r\ngrand escort, 'the retiral of the steward'--the advance of 'the\r\nComptroller, Mr. Holland, attended by _his_ staff'--'as did the sewer,\r\nthe daily waiters, and many gentlemen's sons, with estates from two to\r\nseven hundred pounds a year, who were bred up in the castle, and my\r\nlady's gentlemen of the chamber.' Therein, too, we see the rattling of\r\ntrenchers, and hear the gurgling of bottles, at the first table, of the\r\nnoble family, and such stray nobility as came there; at the second\r\ntable, of knights and honorables--at the second 'first table' in the\r\nhall of 'Sir Ralph Blackstone, Steward; the Comptroller, the Master of\r\nthe Horse, the Master of the Fish Ponds, my Lord Herbert's Preceptor,'\r\nand such gentlemen as were under degree of a knight--these all being\r\n'plentifully served with wine.' Of the second table there is no note of\r\nmuch wine, but it still had 'hot meats from my Lord's table,' and at it\r\nsat the Sewer with gentlemen waiters and pages to the number of\r\ntwenty-four--and even now we are not yet come to the vulgar. For at the\r\n_third_ table sat my Lord's Chief Auditor, his Purveyor of the Castle,\r\nKeeper of the Records--Ushers of the Hall--Clerk--Closet Keeper--Master\r\nof the Armory--and below these divers Masters of the Hounds--Twelve\r\nMaster Grooms of the Stables, Master Falconer--Keepers of the Red Deer\r\nPark--and below these yet one hundred and fifty 'footmen, grooms, and\r\nother menial servants.'\r\n\r\nBright gleams vanish--the stately dinner parties grow dim, Masters of\r\nHorses and Hounds go to battle, the plate is melted down, and all is sad\r\nand sere. The young lord is sent by King Charles abroad, and\r\nParliamentary Fairfax comes thundering at the gate, where admittance is\r\nrefused by the venerable old marquis. Fairfax besieges boldly and is\r\ngallantly attacked by repeated sallies. I had rather the Puritans, with\r\nwhom all my head goes, and with it half my heart, had behaved better\r\nthan they did on this occasion. For after the venerable old marquis had\r\nfought nobly and surrendered on honorable terms, I am sorry to say he\r\nwas most dishonorably treated, the conditions of capitulation being\r\ndisgracefully violated, and the old marquis put in close prison, where\r\nhe soon died in his eighty-fifth year.--Well, well--there was abundance\r\nof such false faith and dark villany on both sides ere the war was over.\r\nBe it remembered that these same nobles had kept the honor too closely\r\nto themselves, and ridiculed it out of life quite too sharply in the\r\n'base mechanicals' to fairly expect mastery in gentility from them. And\r\nin these same Partingtonian Biographies, I am often inclined to suspect\r\nthat the lions do some of their own carving.\r\n\r\nPuritans sequestered and smashed the estate right and left--lead sold\r\nfor six thousand pounds, woods cut down and sold for one hundred\r\nthousand more. 'Pity!' do you say? Reader mine, there is enough land in\r\nparks at this present day in broad England to feed that wretched one\r\neighth of her population who are now buried at public expense. That\r\ndis-parking business was at any rate not badly done.\r\n\r\nLittle more is seen of the young lord through the war. In 1654 he is at\r\nKing Charles's court in France--is sent to London to procure supplies of\r\nmoney for the king--is caught and Towered, where he rests for several\r\nyears, sorrowfully poor, if we may judge from a letter to Colonel\r\nCopley, in which he declares that 'I am forced to begge, if you could\r\npossible, eyther to helpe me with tenne pownds to this bearer, or to\r\nmake vse of the coache and to goe to Mr. Clerke, and if he could this\r\ndaye helpe me to fifty pownds then to paye yourself the five pownds I\r\nowe you out of them.' A melancholy letter, after all that glittering\r\nArthur's-court splendor of first, second, and third tables of nobility,\r\nMasters of Robes and Records--a letter in which there seems some trace\r\nof getting money by 'projects' and 'bubbles'--whether of doing little\r\nbills or by Notable Inventions, I will not say. Prison does not, it is\r\ntrue, last forever, but its doors open on a scene of baseness blacker\r\nthan that which brought the brave old marquis with sorrow to his grave.\r\nThe tale is told in a paragraph:\r\n\r\n     'On the king's restoration, the Marquis of Worcester was one of the\r\n     first to congratulate his Majesty on the happy event, though the\r\n     situation of the unfortunate nobleman was little bettered by the\r\n     change; indeed it appeared but as the signal for new persecutions,\r\n     as one of the earliest public acts of the ungrateful monarch may be\r\n     characterized as an insidious attempt to set aside the claims of\r\n     his earliest and best friend.'\r\n\r\n'Put not thy trust in princes.' To contrast this treatment of poor\r\nWorcester with the fervent written promises of the ungrateful 'C. R.' or\r\nCarolus Rex, might have shook the faith of Dr. Johnson in his beloved\r\n'merry monarch.' The earlier letters of the king to the marquis, when\r\nsomething was expected of the 'gallant cavalier,' and the latter had\r\n'money to lend,' are painfully amusing:\r\n\r\n     OXFORD, _Feb. 12._ * * 'I am sensible of the dangers yu will\r\n     undergo, and ye greate trouble and expences you must be at, not\r\n     being able to assist yu who have already spente aboue a Million of\r\n     Crowns in my Service, neither can I saye more then I well remembr\r\n     to have spoke and written to you that allready words could not\r\n     expresse your merits nor my gratitude: and that next to my wife and\r\n     children I was most bound to take care of you, whereof I have\r\n     besides others, particularly assured yor Cosin Biron as a person\r\n     deare unto you. * * And rest assured, if God should crosse me wth\r\n     your miscarrying I will treate your Sonne as myne owne, and that\r\n     yw labour for a deare friende as well as a thankfull Master when\r\n     tyme shall afforde meanes to acknowledge how much I am\r\n\r\n         'Yor most assured real constant\r\n                   and thankfull friend\r\n                           'CHARLES R.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are other letters from Charles R., very little to his credit as\r\nregards the keeping of promises, and likewise several strange papers of\r\nthe Worcester people, showing that they had their clouds and humors,\r\nlike other families. Of our marquis--the reader will readily pardon me\r\nall that I have digressed to say of his early history--it must suffice\r\nto tell that, after the Restoration, he appears as a poor inventor, and\r\nthat on the 3d April, 1663, a bill was brought into Parliament for\r\ngranting to him and his successors the whole of the profits that might\r\narise from the use of a water-raising engine, described in the last\r\narticle in the 'Century' of Inventions. The 'Century' itself had been\r\npresented to the king and commons some months previously. This\r\ninvention, coupled with its penultimate and antepenultimate ninety-ninth\r\nand ninety-eighth inventions, may indeed be justly considered as the\r\nwonder of the 'Century,' since, when united with the sixty-eighth, they\r\nappear, in Partington's opinion, to suggest all the data essential for\r\nthe construction of a modern steam engine. The injustice which he\r\nencountered during life, seems to have followed Worcester for two\r\ncenturies after death; for Lord Orford declares that the bill granting\r\nthe marquis such advantages as his invention might give birth to, was\r\npassed on a simple affirmation of the discovery that he (the marquis)\r\nhad made. 'His lordship's want of candour in this statement will be\r\napparent when it is known that there were no less than seven meetings of\r\ncommittees on the subject, composed of some of the most learned men in\r\nthe house, who, after considerable amendments, finally passed it on the\r\n12 May.'\r\n\r\nIt is touching to see the absolute, extreme, life-giving faith in the\r\nmerit of his invention which inspired the marquis--and in this strange\r\nfaith, like a prophecy, even more than in his invention itself,\r\nconsidering the way in which he probably came by it, do we recognize\r\nthat Genius which rises here and there in the past history of the Aryan\r\nraces, and that so all-sidedly and confidingly as to seem miraculous. I\r\nconfess that when I look closely and deeply into the knowledge of Dante\r\nand Lionardo da Vinci, of Fiar Bacon, and the Cavalier Marquis of\r\nWorcester, an awe comes over me. All of them seem to have been so\r\ngreat, some of their order so _unearthly_ great; and they held the keys\r\nto so many mysteries, and to doors of science which were not unlocked\r\nfor long centuries after their death; and there was in all of them such\r\na strange sympathy and knowledge with the other great men as yet unborn,\r\nwho were to come after them, and for whom they seem to have labored, and\r\nto whom they talked with the confidence of friends. I never pause before\r\na certain passage in Dante's 'Inferno,' without the feelings of one\r\nstanding before a great prophet--some marvellous earthly ancient of\r\ndays, who foresaw all to come:\r\n\r\n   'Di là fosti cotanto quant'io scesi:\r\n   Quando mi volsi, tu possasti 'l punto\r\n   Alqual si troggon d'ogni parte i pasi.'\r\n\r\n   'Thou wast on the other side so long as I\r\n   Descended; when I turned thou didst o'erpass\r\n   That point to which from every part is dragged\r\n   All heavy unbalance!'\r\n\r\nIt was well thought by Monti that, had this passage been noted by\r\nNewton, it might have given him a better hint than the falling apple.\r\nPerhaps it did, for Newton was no poet, and it is the poetic,\r\nassociative-minded men of genius who have always preceded the greatest,\r\nstrictly scientific minds, and far surpassed the latter in the\r\ncomprehensiveness of their views. Bear with me, ye men of Induction, for\r\nI believe in the coming age, at whose threshold we even now stand, when\r\nye and the poets shall be one.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Worcester was not like the indifferentist philosopher, so\r\nwell set forth by Charles Woodruff Shields in his _Philosophia\r\nUltima_,[4] as one who would not invade, but only ignore the province of\r\nrevelation, regarding its mysteries as matters entirely too vague to be\r\ntaken into the slightest account in his exact science. For our good Lord\r\nHerbert thought Heaven had a great deal to do with his inventions, as is\r\nproved by his 'ejaculatory and extemporary Thanksgiving Prayer, when\r\nfirst with his corporeal eyes he did see finished a perfect trial of his\r\nWater-commanding Engine, delightful and useful to whomsoever hath in\r\nrecommendation either knowledge, profit, or pleasure.' And--never mind\r\nthe delay, reader--we will even look at that prayer, in which this world\r\nand the next blend so strangely;\r\n\r\n     'Oh! infinitely omnipotent GOD! whose mercies are fathomless, and\r\n     whose knowledge is immense and inexhaustible; next to my creation\r\n     and redemption I render thee most humble thanks from the very\r\n     bottom of my heart and bowels, for thy vouchsafing me (the meanest\r\n     in understanding) an insight in soe great a secret of nature,\r\n     beneficent to all mankind, as this my water-commanding engine.\r\n     Suffer me not to be puffed up, O Lord, by the knowing of it, and\r\n     many more rare and unheard off, yea, unparalleled inventions,\r\n     tryals, and experiments. But humble my haughty heart, by the true\r\n     knowledge of myne owne ignorant, weake, and unworthy nature; proane\r\n     to all euill. O most merciful Father my creator, most\r\n     compassionatting Sonne my redeemers, and Holyest of Spiritts the\r\n     sanctifier, three diuine persons and one God, grant me a further\r\n     concurring grace with fortitude to take hould of thy goodnesse, to\r\n     the end that whatever I doe, unanimously and courageously to serve\r\n     my king and country, to disabuse, rectifie, and convert my\r\n     undeserved yet wilfully incredulous enemyes, to reimburse\r\n     thankfully my creditors, to reimmunerate my benefactors, to\r\n     reinhearten my distressed family, and with complacence to gratifie\r\n     my suffering and confiding friends, may, voyde of vanity or selfe\r\n     ends, be only directed to thy honour and glory everlastingly.\r\n     _Amen!_'\r\n\r\nHow this great invention faded and was forgotten till the days of Watt\r\nand Fulton, is hardly worth surmising. It had been born and died long\r\nbefore. Was it not in 1514 that Blasco de Garay set a steamboat afloat\r\non the Tagus? Sometimes, as in the case of John Fitch, it seems to have\r\ngrown spontaneously from the instinctive impulse to create, as Fichte\r\ncalls art. I have seen old men, who had known Fitch: their account of\r\nhis severely won improvements, and more recently his 'Life,' make me\r\nbelieve that he owed nothing to precedent. But the marquis, I am sorry\r\nto say, notwithstanding his prayer and his bold claim to originality,\r\ncannot come off with so clear a record, so far as invention is\r\nconcerned. He certainly gave a good, plausible account of the discovery,\r\nor it was given for him, and this went current for many years in books\r\nof inventions. It was said that the marquis, while confined in the Tower\r\nof London, was preparing some food in his apartment, and the cover of\r\nthe vessel, having been closely fitted, was, by the expansion of the\r\nsteam, suddenly forced off and driven up the chimney. 'This\r\ncircumstance, attracting his attention, led him to a train of thought,\r\nwhich terminated in the completion of his 'water-commanding engine.''\r\n\r\n_E ben trovato._ Unfortunately, within a few years, and since Partington\r\npublished the 'Century of Invention,' there was unearthed from the\r\ngossiping letters of a gay French court-belle, who little dreamed what\r\nill service she was doing her gallant, and what good service to history,\r\na chance bit of trifling, as she probably deemed it, which sends the\r\nmarquis's story exploding up the chimney after the lid of his apocryphal\r\nkettle. It seems that when the marquis was in France, he, in accordance\r\nwith the elegant and refined custom which prevailed there and in\r\nEngland, as the reader may gather from Boswell's 'Johnson'--went with\r\nthis lady to visit the madmen confined in the public prison.\r\n\r\nI have already digressed so widely in this article, that a sin more or\r\nless, of the kind, need not be noted too severely. Reader, if you are\r\none of those who think that mankind do not progress in heart, what think\r\nyou of this pretty custom of the last century, according to which\r\ngentlemen and ladies of the highest rank, 'persons of quality,' made up\r\nparties to visit public madhouses, which, by the way, were common shows,\r\nat one penny entrance fee, and where the young gentlemen poked the mad\r\npeople with sticks, and pelted them, shook their chains, and jeered\r\nthem, till they foamed and raved, and the young misses giggled and gave\r\npretty screams, and cried, 'Oh, fie!' and 'lor!' and then the visitors\r\nall laughed together? Then Miss ----, a little bolder, hissed at the\r\nlunatics herself, and poked them with a stick--and then there was a\r\nfresh storm of tears and howls and blasphemy and obscenity; and the\r\nkeepers, rushing in with heavy cudgels, beat the 'patients' right and\r\nleft like cattle--and it was all 'so horrible!' _Bad_, think you? These\r\nwere the ladies and gentlemen of the old school--the Grandisons and\r\nChesterfields and their dames. At the present day there are still vulgar\r\npeople who haunt insane asylums and prisons, and scenes of domestic\r\naffliction and courts, for the sake of gratifying a gross love of\r\nexcitement, which they disguise to themselves under various ingenious\r\npretences. But the tendency of the age is to discourage such meddling\r\nand prying into the mysteries and miseries of humanity. It is low, it is\r\nmean, and the better nurtured and higher minded leave it to boors--be\r\nthey of Peoria or the Fifth avenue.\r\n\r\nWell, our marquis, then the first gentleman in Great Britain, one of\r\n'the barons of England who fought for the crown,' when in France as\r\nparticular friend of His Majesty Charles II, went one day on such a\r\nparty of pleasure, and somewhat annoyed his pretty companion by\r\npersisting in listening to the drivelling talk of a madman--one Solomon\r\nde Caus--who, while he rattled his chains, talked of a great invention\r\nhe had made, whereby chariots were to go by steam, and weights be\r\nraised, and all manner of brave work be effected, at small cost or labor\r\nto man. And the marquis talked to the madman, and the lady laughed, and\r\nthe chains rattled, and the straw rustled, and--well, it _has_ been made\r\nthe subject of a very good picture--which you, reader, may have seen,\r\neither in original or engraving.\r\n\r\nI will not pretend to say how far what is known of the life of this\r\nFrench inventor is reconcilable with this story of the madhouse. It is\r\ncertain that Solomon de Caus, a French engineer, architect, and author,\r\ndied about 1635, that he was born probably at Dieppe, and devoted\r\nhimself to mathematics. The marquis might have met him in a better place\r\nthan a bedlam, since in 1612 De Caus went to London, where he was\r\nattached to the Prince of Wales, and afterward to Charles I. From 1614\r\nto 1620 he lived in Heidelberg at the court of the Elector Frederic V,\r\nand returned to France in 1624, where he received the title of royal\r\nengineer and architect. More than this, he wrote books on mechanics, in\r\none of which, _Les Raysons des Forces Mouvantes_, he speaks of the\r\nexpansion and condensation of steam in a manner which has been supposed\r\nto suggest the alternate action of the piston, the principle of the\r\nsteam engine, and, finally, 'the great discovery' of and to the Marquis\r\nof Worcester. How far all this may be supposed to contradict the lady's\r\nstory, I will not say. Certain it is, that many a man who has done quite\r\nas well in worldly honors, has, after all, come to misery and madness\r\nthrough unfortunately making an invention.\r\n\r\nInventors have, on the whole, a little easier time of it in these\r\ndays--and yet not so very much easier, as the reader who has chanced,\r\nlike myself, to study law in an office where there are many 'patent\r\ncases,' will bear witness. Eighteen hundred years ago, the inventor was\r\ncrucified--lest his malleable glass should injure Ephesian or other\r\nsilversmiths. During the middle ages, they burnt him alive. In the times\r\nof Worcester he seldom escaped prison, for to be a 'projector' was a\r\ncharge which greatly aggravated that of treason; while in France, where\r\nthey managed these things better, according to the views of the day,\r\nthey simply cast him into a dungen among madmen. In America in the\r\nnineteenth century he has indeed occasionally better luck, and yet in\r\nmost cases not so much better as most think. For, apart from the fact\r\nthat he must generally sell his invention to richer men endowed with\r\nbusiness faculty, who get nearly all the profits, and, not unfrequently,\r\nby clapping their names to the project, all the credit, he must also\r\nwage a weary, heart-breaking legal war on infringers of patents and\r\nother thieves; so that by the time his time has expired, he has seldom\r\nmuch to show for his brain-work.[5] 'Serves him right, he has no\r\nbusiness capacity,' cry the multitude. We need not look far for\r\nexamples. I am not sure that Eli Whitney, when he fell with his cotton\r\ngin among the thieves of the South, did not fare quite as badly and\r\nsuffer quite as much as Solomon de Caus. For to be clapped fair and\r\nsquare into a dungeon is at all events a plain martyrdom, with which one\r\ncan grapple philosophically or go mad _à discretion_, while to be only\r\nhalf honored and nine-tenths plundered, dragged meanwhile through courts\r\nand newspapers, may be better or worse, according to one's measure.\r\nAfter all, the good old Roman plan of putting a man to death for\r\ninventing malleable glass had its advantages--it was at least more\r\nmerciful from a Christian point of view, and would, at the present day,\r\nsave a vast amount of yards of Patent Law red tape.\r\n\r\n_Artis et Naturæ proles_, 'the offspring of Nature and of Art.' Such is\r\nthe motto with which the Marquis of Worcester prefaced his 'Century of\r\nthe Names and Scantlings of such inventions as he could in the year 1663\r\ncall to mind,' and which he presented to Government in the bold hope\r\nthat by their purchase or other disposition he might even out-go the six\r\nor seven hundred thousand pounds already sacrificed for the king, as he\r\nasserts, but rather meaning, I imagine, that he might get some portion\r\nof it back again. Let no one laugh at the character of many of these\r\n'Scantlings.' Science was young then; thaumaturgy, or the working of\r\nmere wonders, was still the elder sister of art; astrology might be\r\nfound in every street; alchemists still labored in lonely towers all\r\nover England; and witches were still burned to the glory of GOD. The\r\n'Mathematicall Magick, or the Wonders that may be performed by\r\nMechanicall Geometry'--now by chance open before me--by Bishop Wilkins,\r\nthe brother-in-law of Cromwell, with its disquisitions on 'Perpetuall\r\nMotion,' 'Volant Automata,' and 'Perpetuall Lamps,' passed for sound\r\nsense, and with it passed much occult nonsense of a darker dye. Manners\r\nand morals were as yet badly organized. Gambling was a daily amusement\r\nwith all the gentry, and its imitators; for the Revolution, though it\r\nhad very promptly driven out of England the very little merriment and\r\ncheerfulness which the Reformation had spared, had by no means taken\r\naway vice, and to cheat at cards was a part of all play in the best\r\nsociety--which it had not been in the olden time. Political plots were\r\nstill rife, and cipher alphabets, signals by knots and signs, deadly\r\nsecret weapons, and devices to escape prison were in daily demand, just\r\nas patent apple-parers and ice-cream freezers are at the present day.\r\nThe marquis, who had lived well through his times, knew what would be\r\npopular, and, though a man of honor as times went, and a pious\r\nChristian, never dreamed that he did not play his part as a good citizen\r\nin supplying such grotesque wants.\r\n\r\nFirst among his Inventions is one which, revived in modern times, meets\r\nthe eye of every one daily on the face of every letter. As he designed\r\nit, it was, however, very elaborate, embracing 'several sorts of seals,\r\nsome showing by screws, others by gauges, fastening or unfastening all\r\nthe marks at once: others by additional points and imaginary places,\r\nproportionable to ordinary escutcheons and seals at arms, each way\r\npalpably and punctually setting down (yet private from all others but\r\nthe owner, and by his assent) the day of the month, the day of the week,\r\nthe month of the year, the year of our Lord, the names of the witnesses,\r\nand the individual place where anything was sealed, though in ten\r\nthousand several places, together with the very number of lines\r\ncontained in a contract, whereby falsification may be discovered and\r\nmanifestly proved.' Upon these seals, too, one could keep accounts of\r\nreceipts and disbursements, from one farthing to millions, and, finally,\r\nas a climax to their mystery, by their means any letter, 'though written\r\nbut in English, may be read and understood in eight several languages,\r\nand in English itself, to clear contrary and different sense, unknown to\r\nany but the correspondent, and not to be read or understood by him\r\nneither, if opened before it arrive unto him.'\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the secret of these seals is simply this: a number\r\nof movable metallic circles are made to slide within each other, on one\r\ncommon centre, the whole being enclosed in an outer frame. Within these\r\ncircles may be placed either movable types, or letters and figures may\r\nbe engraved on the circles themselves, and these, according to a key, of\r\nwhich the corresponding parties must possess a duplicate. To fully\r\nunderstand the secret of the composition of a sentence 'in eight several\r\nlanguages,' we must have recourse to invention No. 32 of the 'Century,'\r\nteaching 'how to compose an universal character, methodical and easily\r\nto be written, yet intelligible in _any_ language .... distinguishing\r\nthe verbs from the nouns, the numbers, tenses, and cases, as properly\r\nexpressed in their own language as it was written in English.' Such a\r\nsystem was composed by the Bishop Wilkins already referred to; Bacon\r\nhad busied himself with a 'pasigraphy' long before; Leibnitz, Dalgaru,\r\nFrischius, Athanasius Kircher, Pére Besnier, and some twenty others have\r\ndone the same. The most practical solution of the problem seems to have\r\nbeen that of John Joachim Becher, who in 1661 published a Latin folio,\r\nwhich, apart from its main subject, is valuable from its observations on\r\ngrammar, and on the affinities existing between seven of the ancient and\r\nmodern tongues. With this he gives a Latin dictionary, in which every\r\nword corresponds with one or more Arabic numerals. 'Every word is\r\nassumed as distinctive, or denoting the same word in all languages; and\r\nconsequently nothing more is required than to compose a dictionary for\r\neach, similar to that which he has given for the Latin.' Certain\r\ndeterminate numbers being given for the declensions and conjugations,\r\nand the cases, moods, tenses, and persons, the whole grammar becomes\r\nextremely easy of acquisition. Let us suppose that a Frenchman wishes to\r\nwrite to a German: _La guerre est un grand mal_--'War is a great evil.'\r\nHe seeks in his index _guerre_, and finds 13. The verb _etre_, 'to be,'\r\nis 33. _Grand_, or 'great,' is 67; and _mal_, or 'evil,' is 68. The\r\nsentence then reads:\r\n\r\n   13. 33. 67. 68.\r\n\r\nThe sentence might be understood by these four numbers, but the author\r\nperfects it. _Guerre_, or 'war,' is the nominative case, and is\r\nappropriately designated by the Arabic numeral 1. The third person,\r\nsingular, present tense, of the indicative mood of a verb, is\r\ncharacterized by 15. _Grand_ and _mal_ being each in the nominative\r\ncase, also require the figure 1. He will therefore write:\r\n\r\n   13. 1 | 33. 15 | 67. 1 | 68.1\r\n\r\n--the numbers being separated by a vertical dash, to avoid confusion.\r\nThe German, inverting the process, turns to _his_dictionary, and finds\r\n_Der Krieg ist ein grosses Uebel_.\r\n\r\nIf the world were to be persuaded to adopt these dictionaries, and with\r\nthem some uniform oral system of counting, such as might be learned in a\r\nday, who shall say in what conversation might result! Fancy an orator\r\ncounting '83.1--10.16--225.2'--interrupted by enthusiastic cries of\r\n'2.30' and '11.45!' Fancy a lover breathing his tender passion in\r\n'837.25--29.1,' and extracting a reluctant '12' from his adored. Fancy a\r\ndrunken Delaware Democrat--a SAULSBURY--flourishing a revolver, and\r\ngurgling out '54.40' to the Sergeant-at-Arms in particular, and decency\r\nin general, as a proof of his fitness to be regarded as a mate for his\r\nSouthern colleagues. Fancy Brignoli singing '1.2.3,' as he reminds us by\r\nhis good singing and wooden acting of a nightingale imprisoned in a\r\npump--\r\n\r\nOr fancy the appearance of a page of Shakspeare or Homer thus\r\nmetamorphosed.\r\n\r\n     'He lisped in numbers for, the numbers came.'\r\n\r\nIt is something to the marquis's credit that he evidently, to judge from\r\nthe sixth article of his 'Century,' had discovered the telegraph, an\r\ninvention not much used in Europe until the commencement of the French\r\nRevolution. It had indeed been understood in a rude form by the\r\nancients. 'Polybius describes a method of communication which was\r\ninvented by Cleoxenus, which answered both by day and night,' but that\r\nof Worcester's is thought to have been far superior to anything known\r\nbefore his time. The following paragraphs all indicate inventions\r\ngreatly in advance of his age:\r\n\r\n     'No. IX.--An engine portable in one's pocket, which may be carried\r\n     and fastened in the inside of the greatest ship, _tanquam aliud\r\n     agens_, and at any appointed minute, though a week after, either of\r\n     day or night, it shall irrecoverably sink that ship.'\r\n\r\nA bombshell filled with gunpowder, a gunlock, and a small clock, have\r\nbeen suggested as forming the components of this invention. I am\r\nsatisfied however, that several very dangerous detonating powders were\r\nwell known to the alchemists; and the condensed pocket size of the\r\nmachine described, would evidently require some such preparation.\r\n\r\n     'No. X.--A way from a mile off to dive and fasten a like engine to\r\n     any ship so as it may punctually work the same effect either for\r\n     time or execution.'\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same experiment has within a week of the time at which I\r\nam now writing, been made at Washington, as it was by Mr. Fulton half a\r\ncentury ago with his Torpedo-harpoon. If the marquis contemplated simply\r\nhuman agency as the aid to apply his portable powder-machine, it must be\r\nadmitted that he had at least contemplated a more effective diving bell\r\nthan any known to modern times. Submarine transit was indeed a subject\r\nto which he had devoted special study.\r\n\r\n     'No. XI.--How to prevent and safeguard any ship from such an\r\n     attempt by day or night.\r\n\r\n     'No. XII.--A way to make a ship not possible to be sunk, though\r\n     shot at an hundred times between wood and water by cannon, and\r\n     should she lose a whole plank, yet, in half an hour's time, should\r\n     be made to sail as fit as before.'\r\n\r\nIt is thought that a great number of airtight compartments was the\r\nsecret here hinted at; but the spirit of positive confidence with which\r\nthe marquis speaks, and the great number of successful shots which he\r\ndefies, seems to hint at something like the Ericsson Monitor of these\r\ndays. Not without interest is the following:\r\n\r\n     'No. XIII--How to make such false decks as in a moment should kill\r\n     and take prisoners as many as should board the ship, without\r\n     blowing the real decks up, or destroying them from being reducible;\r\n     and in a quarter of an hour's time should recover their former\r\n     shape, and to be made fit for any employment, _without discovering\r\n     the secret_.'\r\n\r\nThe words italicized set forth the startling marvel of the whole. It is\r\nsaid that a false deck of thick plank may be easily blown into the air,\r\nwhen a number of small iron boxes, open at the top, and filled with\r\ngunpowder, are placed beneath. How this could be done and yet kept\r\nsecret is indeed a wonder, and we must therefore conjecture that the\r\nmarquis had some other device in his mind. Certain it is, that the idea\r\nof converting vessels into traps of destruction, or of so defending them\r\nas to destroy assailants after boarding the decks, has not been very\r\nextensively developed.\r\n\r\n     'No. XVI.--How to make a sea castle or a fortification _cannon\r\n     proof_, capable of a thousand men, yet sailable at pleasure to\r\n     defend a passage, or in an hour's time to divide itself into three\r\n     ships, as fit and trimmed to sail as before; and even whilst it is\r\n     a fort or castle, they shall be unanimously steered, and\r\n     effectually be driven by an indifferent strong wind.'\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Parliamentary or other inducements were not\r\nemployed to obtain from the marquis, at least the publication of his\r\nviews as regards making vessels cannon proof. From the general character\r\nof his inventions, and from comparison of them, it appears he had full\r\nfaith in cannon-proof floating batteries as a means of defence, and, we\r\nmay consequently and justly infer, as superior to the latter. Among his\r\ninventions there are but two in reference to 'fortifications,' and both\r\nof these are after a manner a transfer of the floating battery to land,\r\nor an application of the principle of mobile defences. These are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     'No. XXIX.--A portable fortification, able to contain five hundred\r\n     fighting men, and yet, in six hours' time, may be set up and made\r\n     cannon proof, upon the side of a river or pass, with cannon mounted\r\n     upon it, and as complete as a regular fortification, with halfmoons\r\n     and counterscarps.\r\n\r\n     'No. XXX.--A way in one night's time to raise a bulwark, twenty or\r\n     thirty foot high, cannon proof, and cannon mounted upon it; with\r\n     men to overlook, command, and batter a town, for though it (the\r\n     bulwark) contain but four pieces, they shall be able to discharge\r\n     two hundred bullets each hour.'\r\n\r\nThere can be but little question, from all I have cited, that the\r\nMarquis of Worcester was singularly in advance of his age as regarded\r\nthe great principles of warfare. We have found him thus far, in all\r\nprobability, acquainted with the construction of permutable seals, and\r\nindeed of the grand principle of permutation applied to technology in\r\nseveral respects (vide \"Century\" Nos. III, IV, V,) of the telegraph, of\r\nsinking vessels by torpedoes, and, finally, of floating batteries and\r\ncannon-proof vessels. In No. 30, we have, however, a hint that the\r\nmarquis had studied the principles of revolving firearms, when he\r\nspeaks of four cannon discharging two hundred bullets each hour. That he\r\nhad, theoretically, at least, anticipated Colt, appears from\r\n\r\n     'No. LVIII.--How to make a pistol discharge a dozen times with one\r\n     loading, and without so much as once new priming requisite, _or to\r\n     change it out of one hand into the other_, or stop one's horse.'\r\n\r\nI call attention to the words which I have italicized. It is well known\r\nthat the mere principle of revolving barrels in firearms was already\r\nold, even when Worcester wrote. I have seen guns of the kind over three\r\nhundred years old, and they are not uncommon in foreign museums. But it\r\nwould appear that the marquis was acquainted with the principle of the\r\nself-cocking pistol. How else could he propose to discharge a gun a\r\ndozen times, without changing it from one hand to another? And this, I\r\nbelieve, was not known before his day. But how this could have been\r\nconveniently carried out, without some application of detonating powders\r\nin place of flint, steel, and gunpowder, I do not understand. That he\r\nwas very probably familiar with the application of such chemical\r\ndetonating agents has already been suggested. In another number, he\r\nsuggests the application of this principle to 'carbines.' So in No.\r\nLXII, he proposes 'a way for a harquebuss, a crock, or ship musket, six\r\nupon a carriage, shooting with such expedition as, without danger, one\r\nmay charge, level, and discharge them sixty times in a minute of an\r\nhour, two or three together.' To which he adds the following:\r\n\r\n     'No. LXIV.--A seventh, tried and approved before the late king (of\r\n     ever blessed memory), and an hundred lords and commons, in a cannon\r\n     of eight inches and half a quarter, to shoot bullets of sixty-four\r\n     pounds weight, and twenty-four pounds of powder, twenty times in\r\n     six minutes; so clear from danger, that after all were discharged,\r\n     a pound of butter did not melt, being laid upon the cannon britch,\r\n     nor the green oil discoloured that was first anointed and used\r\n     between the barrel thereof, and the engine having never in it, nor\r\n     within six foot, but one charge at a time.'\r\n\r\nSeveral improvements of this kind are suggested in the 'Century,' which\r\nevidently involve different principles from that of the modern revolver,\r\nin reference to which difference we are informed in a 'note by the\r\nauthor,' that 'when I first gave my thoughts to make guns shoot often, I\r\nthought there had been but one only exquisite way inventible; yet, by\r\nseveral trials, and much charge, I have perfectly tried all of these.'\r\n\r\nI cannot venture in a single article to exhaust the suggestions in the\r\nCentury, and must refer my reader to the volume himself, assuring him\r\nthat he will there find many curious hints, several of which have, since\r\nits publication, been very practically realized. It is worth noting,\r\nhowever, that the author seems to have fully anticipated a very\r\nremarkable modern invention, in declaring that 'a woman even may with\r\nher delicate hand, vary the ways of coming to open a lock ten millions\r\nof times, beyond the knowledge of the smith that made it, or of me who\r\ninvented it.' From this, as I have already suggested, it appears that he\r\nhad, far in advance of his age, mastered a very great principle in\r\nmechanics; and as he appears to have understood, in theory at least,\r\nseveral others, it is no more than justice to rank him far above those\r\nmere charlatans of science, and hunters for marvels by means of\r\nisolated observation and experiment, with whom many would place him.\r\nThat the 'Century' contains much which would be very discreditable to\r\nany man of science at the present day, is very true. Perpetual motion,\r\nperfect aerostation, devices for idle tricks and mere thaumaturgy,\r\nappear in company with schemes to take unfair advantages at card\r\nplaying, and for the construction of false dice boxes--of which latter\r\nit is indignantly observed by honest Partington, that, there are few who\r\nprofess the science of cheating at cards or dice, or to be encouragers\r\nof those who do; and it may fairly be conceded that there are not two\r\nperiods in our regal annals, in which this detestable meanness had\r\nbecome fashionable enough to sanction a nobleman in inscribing to a king\r\nand his parliament a method by which it might be advantageously\r\neffected! We may, however, believe that a second period has at the\r\npresent dawned over England, not much inferior as regards 'detestable\r\nmeanness,' to that of Charles the Second. A recent transaction has shown\r\nthat noblemen and their friends in the year 1862, are not above\r\nascertaining from Johnson's Dictionary, the obsolete spelling of a word,\r\nsuch as _rain_-deer, betting a hundred pounds with an American as to its\r\ntrue orthography, and agreeing with him to abide by Johnson's authority;\r\na piece of swindling quite as detestable in its meanness as the using of\r\nloaded dice. Neither can I see that the conduct of a majority of the\r\nBritish people, in fomenting Abolition for many years, and then giving\r\nher aid and countenance to our Southern rebels, on the flimsy, and, at\r\nbest, brazenly selfish plea of the Morrill Tariff, is less detestable or\r\nless mean. We may regret to see a vice in individuals tolerated in high\r\nplaces; but when the blackest inconsistency, and the most contemptible\r\navarice are elevated by a Christian nation into principles of conduct\r\ntoward another nation struggling to free the oppressed, we may well\r\ndoubt whether another period has not approached in England, over which\r\nthe future historiographer may not sigh as deeply as over that of\r\nCharles the Second.\r\n\r\nI attach no serious value to the efforts of the Marquis of Worcester,\r\nsave as illustrating the principle with which I prefaced this article:\r\nthat according to the mental peculiarities of the most vigorous of\r\nraces--the Indo-Germanic above others--there is a tendency in certain\r\nactive minds to generalize and draw practical conclusions, not\r\nunfrequently centuries in advance of the wants of their age. The partial\r\nand premature forcing of these principles into practice, is sometimes\r\nquoted in after years as derogatory to the merit due to modern\r\ninventors, and as illustrating to a degree never contemplated by him who\r\nuttered it, the maxim that there's 'nothing new under the sun.'\r\n_Nothing?_ Why, _everything_ is new under the sun when it first assumes\r\nfit time and place. Were this not true, we might as well return to\r\n'Nature's Centenary of Inventions,' as set forth by a pleasant pen in\r\n_Household Words_:\r\n\r\n     'Before the first clumsy sail was hoisted by a savage hand, the\r\n     little Portuguese man-of-war, that frailest and most graceful\r\n     nautilus boat, had skimmed over the seas with all its feathery\r\n     sails set in the pleasant breeze; and before the great British\r\n     Admiralty marked its anchors with the Broad Arrow, mussels and\r\n     pinna had been accustomed to anchor themselves by flukes to the\r\n     full as effective as the iron one in the Government dockyards. The\r\n     duck used oars before we did; and rudders were known by every fish\r\n     with a tail, countless ages before human pilots handled tillers;\r\n     the floats on the fishermen's nets were pre-figured in the bladders\r\n     on the sea weed; the glowworm and firefly held up their\r\n     light-houses before pharas or beacon-tower guided the wanderer\r\n     among men; and, as long before Phipps brought over the diving bell\r\n     to this country as the creation, spiders were making and using\r\n     airpumps to descend into the deep. Our bones were moved by tendons\r\n     and muscles long before chains and cords were made to pull heavy\r\n     weights from place to place. Nay, until quite lately--leaving these\r\n     discoveries to themselves--we took no heed of the pattern set us\r\n     in the backbone, with the arching ribs springing from it, to\r\n     construct the large cylinder which we often see now attaching all\r\n     the rest of a set of works. This has been a very modern discovery;\r\n     but, prior even to the first man, Nature had cast such a cylinder\r\n     in every ribbed and vertebrate animal she had made. The cord of\r\n     plaited iron, too, now used to drag machinery up inclined planes,\r\n     was typified in the backbone of the eels and snakes in Eden;\r\n     tubular bridges and hollow columns had been in use since the first\r\n     bird with hollow bones flew through the wood, or the first reed\r\n     waved in the wind. Strange that the principle of the Menai Straits'\r\n     railway bridge, and of the iron pillars in the Crystal Palace,\r\n     existed is the Arkite dove, and in the bulrushes that grew round\r\n     the cradle of Moses! Our railway tunnels are wonderful works of\r\n     science, but the mole tunnelled with its foot, and the pholas with\r\n     one end of its shell, before our navvies handled pick or spade upon\r\n     the heights of the iron roads: worms were prior to gimlets,\r\n     ant-lions were the first funnel makers, a beaver showed men how to\r\n     make the milldams, and the pendulous nests of certain birds swung\r\n     gently in the air before the keen wit of even the most loving\r\n     mother laid her nursling in a rocking cradle. The carpenter of\r\n     olden time lost many useful hours in studying how to make the\r\n     ball-and-socket joint which he bore about with him in his own hips\r\n     and shoulders; the universal joint, which filled all men with\r\n     wonder when first discovered, he had in his wrist; in the jaws of\r\n     all flesh-eating animals his huge one-hinge joint; in the\r\n     graminivora and herbivora the joint of free motion; for grinding\r\n     millstones were set up in our molars and in the gizzards of birds\r\n     before the Egyptian women ground their corn between two stones; and\r\n     the crushing teeth of the hyena make the best models we know of for\r\n     hammers to break stones on the road. The tongue of certain shell\r\n     fish--of the limpet, for instance--is full of siliceous spines\r\n     which serve as rasp and drill; and knives and scissors were carried\r\n     about in the mandibles and beaks of primeval bees and parrots.\r\n\r\nYes, they were all there--and if the undeveloped germ may be taken for\r\nthe great fruit-bearing tree, there is nothing new under the sun, labor\r\nand effort are of no avail, and it is not worth while for man to live\r\nthreescore years and ten, since a much less time would suffice to show\r\nhis utter worthlessness. But the bee and the wild bird, the pearly\r\nnautilus driving before the fresh breeze, and the reed waving in the\r\nwind, should teach us a higher lesson. They teach us that life is\r\nbeautiful and to be enjoyed, that infinite laws and infinite ingenuity\r\nwere not displayed to be called idle and vain, and that, as the insect\r\nworks according to his instinct, man should labor, from the dictates of\r\nreason, with heart and soul to do his best to turn to higher advantage\r\nthe innumerable advantages afforded him.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Philosophia Ultima_, CHARLES WOODRUFF SHIELDS.\r\nPhiladelphia, J.

Ah, smile on her ere I go!\r\n\r\n   Yes, the smile comes warm as sunshine, and it falls on my sick heart\r\n   As if Heaven were shining through it, and new hopes within me start.\r\n\r\n   Your clear eyes shine blue upon me through the clouds of sunny curls,\r\n   Sadder now, but still as kindly, as when we were little girls.\r\n\r\n   Your poor slave and you, fair mistress, were born in the same hour,\r\n   As if God himself had marked me from my birth to be your dower.\r\n\r\n   Oft have I laid my dusky hand upon your neck of snow,\r\n   To see it sparkle through the jet--how long that seems ago!\r\n\r\n   So long! before young master came to woo Virginia's daughter,\r\n   And tempt her to the cotton fields on Mississippi's water.\r\n\r\n   I could not leave you, mistress, so I followed to the swamp,\r\n   Where fevers fire the burning blood and the long moss hangs damp.\r\n\r\n   I left poor Sam, he loved me well, but you were my heart's god;\r\n   My mother's tears fell hot and fast--I followed where you trod.\r\n\r\n   Sin and sorrow fell upon me! and soon you felt it shame\r\n   To have lost Amy near you, and you blushed to hear her name.\r\n\r\n   Reared near virgin purity, you could not understand\r\n   How I could break from virtue's laws, and form a lawless band.\r\n\r\n   Then you questioned kindly, sternly,--but you could not make me tell;\r\n   I would not wring your trusting heart with tales scarce fit for hell!\r\n\r\n   You deemed me hardened, sunk in vice; I choked down every moan,\r\n   Turned from your breast the poisoned dart to bury in my own.\r\n\r\n   Driven from your presence, mistress, in agony and shame\r\n   I bore a wretched infant--she must never know her name!\r\n\r\n   How I crawled around your windows when your joyous boy was born,\r\n   To hear your voice, to catch a glimpse,--the sun rose fair that morn.\r\n\r\n   Ah! not mine to hold your darling! not mine to soothe his cries\r\n   When the stern death-angel seized him and bore him to the skies!\r\n\r\n   Then judgment came--the fever fell--young master gasped for breath--\r\n   God's hand was on him--vain were prayers,--how still he lay in death!\r\n\r\n   I heard you shriek--I rushed within--I held you in my arms\r\n   That frenzied night when sudden woe had wrought its worst of harms.\r\n\r\n   When reason dawned on you again, sweet pity stirred within,\r\n   You heard my cough, my labored breath, and saw me ghastly, thin.\r\n\r\n   Then you took my hand so kindly, gazing on my faded face:\r\n   'Speak, and tell me truly, Amy, how you fell in such disgrace.'\r\n\r\n   If he had lived, sweet mistress, I had borne it to the grave;\r\n   I would not mar your happiness, child, self or race to save.\r\n\r\n   Say! must I speak of one you loved now sleeping 'neath the sod?\r\n   Your 'yes' is bitter; but we owe the naked truth to God!\r\n\r\n   The truth to God, for guiltless you must stand before His face,\r\n   Nor wrong my pallid baby, nor scorn my suffering race.\r\n\r\n   Am I too bold? Death equals all--my heart beats faint and low;\r\n   Turn not away, sweet mistress, hear the truth before I go!\r\n\r\n   Gaze upon my shivering baby, scan the little pallid face,\r\n   Mark the forehead, eyes of azure--Ha! you do the likeness trace!\r\n\r\n   Nay, start not in horror from me! Oh, it was no fault of mine;\r\n   I would have died a thousand deaths ere wronged a thought of thine.\r\n\r\n   He came at midnight to my hut--abhorrent to my sense--\r\n   Force--threats of shame--foul violence--a slave has no defence!\r\n\r\n   Wronged--soiled--and outraged--sick at heart--what right had I to feel?\r\n   He deemed his chattel honored,--God! how brain and senses reel!\r\n\r\n   We're women, though our hair is crisped, and though our skin be black:\r\n   Men, ask your virgin daughters what's the maiden's deadliest rack!\r\n\r\n   I scorned myself! I hated him! but felt a living goad\r\n   Writhe and crawl beneath my bosom--shameful burden! sinful load!\r\n\r\n   Sick and faint, I loathed my master, loathed his inant, loathed my life\r\n   Till its flame burned dim within me, choked by shame, rage, hate, and strife.\r\n\r\n   Better feelings woke within me when the helpless girl was born;\r\n   Mother's love poured wild upon her: how love conquers rage and scorn!\r\n\r\n   But my tortured heart was broken, and a slave girl ought to die\r\n   When a tyrant master wrongs her, and she dreads her mistress' eye:\r\n\r\n   Dreads one she loves may read in her, in spite of silence deep,\r\n   That which would blight all happiness, and pale the rosy cheek:\r\n\r\n   Dreads that a wife may shuddering read a husband's naked heart--\r\n   Humbled and crushed by treachery, may into madness start.\r\n\r\n   But Amy dies: she has forgiven--forgive with her the wrong!\r\n   Smile on the helpless baby--make her truthful, pure, and strong.\r\n\r\n   Let her wait upon you, mistress; twine your ringlets golden still;\r\n   Take her back to old Virginia, to the homestead by the hill.\r\n\r\n   My heart clings to you with wild love--wherefore I scarce dare whisper--\r\n   Forgive--I am your father's child! pity your ruined sister!\r\n\r\n   The hot white blood in my baby's veins, though mixed with duskier flow,\r\n   Will make her wretched if a slave; let her in freedom go!\r\n\r\n   Oh make her free, sweet mistress, that such a fate as mine\r\n   Blanch not her cheek with agony, nor blast her ere her prime!\r\n\r\n   You smile--I need no promise; angel-like to me you seem;\r\n   Will you open heaven for me? bring the seraphs? how I dream!\r\n\r\n   I go to God. He made me. All His children, black and white,\r\n   Will meet in heaven if pure and true, clad in the eternal Light.\r\n\r\n   I die--God bless you, mistress!'... Sigh, and gasp--then all is o'er!\r\n   And the lady kneels beside a corpse upon the cabin floor.\r\n\r\n   Her thoughts are busy with the past, with love in falsehood spoken,\r\n   While her dusky sister's faithful heart had in silent anguish broken.\r\n\r\n   She takes the cold hand in her own: 'Poor Amy, can it be\r\n   That thou wert of a race accursed, unworthy to be free?\r\n\r\n   Man's falsehood! God! Thy right hand rests upon the dusky brow;\r\n   Thou starr'st it round with virtues brighter than our boasted snow!\r\n\r\n   I have learned a bitter lesson; to my slave I've been to school;\r\n   God has humbled me, but chastened; I will keep His Golden Rule.\r\n\r\n   Slaves and chattels! God forgive us! they are men and women--Thine!\r\n   If Christ may dwell within them, shall I dare to call them _mine_?\r\n\r\n   No woman must be outraged, nor owned by man, if we\r\n   Would hold _our_ sanctity intact--all women must be free.\r\n\r\n   Sacred from every touch profane, yes, holy things and pure;\r\n   A wrong to one is wrong to all; we must the weak secure.\r\n\r\n   United we must strike the shame; if known aright our power,\r\n   Slavery and crime would perish: Sisters, peal their final hour!\r\n\r\n   Mothers, maidens, wives, no longer aid your dusky sisters' shame!\r\n   Strike for our common womanhood, uphold our spotless fame!\r\n\r\n   Its majesty is in your hands, trail it not in the dust,\r\n   Nor keep your shrinking slaves as prey for lovers', husbands' lust!\r\n\r\n   All womanhood is holy! it shall not be profaned!\r\n   Our sanctity is threatened: Men! it shall not thus be stained!\r\n\r\n   Break up your harems! free our slaves! we will not share your shame!\r\n   O mothers of the living, chaste must be life's sacred flame!\r\n\r\n   Fathers, brothers, sons, and husbands, their chains must be untwined!\r\n   Touch not the ark where purity in woman's form is shrined!\r\n\r\n   Poor Amy! love has conquered! the veil is raised, I see\r\n   Sister spirits 'neath the dusky hue; thy people shall go free!'\r\n\r\n   The lady rose with high resolve upon her pale sad face;\r\n   And moved among the slave girls, the angel of their race.\r\n\r\n   Angel of freedom, charity, she breathes, and fetters melt,\r\n   And the holy might of Purity in Southern heart is felt.\r\n\r\n   Ah! the stars upon our banner, driven apart and dimmed with blood,\r\n   Might again in glory cluster through a perfect womanhood!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR AND AGAINST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen his father called Fred Fontevrault, then a boy of fifteen, into his\r\nsick chamber, and made him subscribe to the whimsical conditions of the\r\nwill, the female _gendarmerie_, so well versed in my affairs, declared\r\nthat my husband had wretchedly repented his early marriage, and\r\nresolving his son should walk into fate with eyes unbandaged, forbade\r\nhis alliance before the age of twenty-six. Though Mr. Fontevrault was\r\nfifty and I sixteen when I married him, he was not unhappy. He occupied\r\nhimself in looking after his money, and making a collection of mosaics.\r\nWe never had any matrimonial disturbances. I think they are vulgar. Any\r\nwoman can do as she pleases without a remonstrant word, provided she has\r\nmind enough. It is the brainless women who scold. But scolds do not\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nFred was unreasonably fond of his father, and assented to his wishes\r\nwithout demur, even when the great Fontevrault estates hung on his\r\nfidelity to a useless oath. Then he died, and I settled into the blank\r\nstupidity of my widowhood. I, who had known no master but my own sweet\r\nwill, now found myself in a hundred ways restricted. I was ruled through\r\nFred. He must graduate at Harvard; the great establishment, splendid but\r\ntedious, must be maintained. So our residence in Boston was\r\nnecessitated. I shut myself up in the legitimate manner, and--mourned of\r\ncourse. If it had not been for novels, worsted work, and my beauty, I\r\nshould have gaped myself out of existence the first year. What nonsense\r\nit is to say the prime of a woman's loveliness passes before the\r\nthirties! For, look at me, am I old or faded? Would you believe that\r\nFred, so tall and splendidly developed, was my son? From me he took his\r\nwealth of nature, for Mr. Fontevrault was one of those dried, wrinkled\r\nold men, women like me often marry; not because of the settlements only,\r\nbut because of the foil. My figure was moulded like the Venus they\r\ncopied in the colder marble from Pauline. Shoulders and arms, delicious\r\nin their curves, shining with a rosy fairness. A creamy skin, with a\r\nfaint coralline tinge in the cheeks. The forehead is too low, some say;\r\nand yet artists have praised its bend, and the Greek line of the nose;\r\nnot intellectual, but womanly, you know. Hair of a bright brown, feeling\r\nlike floss silk. Eyes, I believe, few people ever fairly saw. Men are\r\nbewitched by them, women cannot understand their charm. Perhaps you have\r\nseen Wilson's portrait of me, the one with the grayish green background;\r\nyou notice that the eyes were turned from the spectator, and half shaded\r\nby white lid and gilded lash. He could not catch the flitting spark that\r\nmade them mine, and refused to paint them at all. My son promises to be\r\nas perfect in his way as I in mine. Just now a student, he is too\r\nRaphael-angel-like to suit me; but the very fellow to bewilder girls and\r\nset the boarding schools crazy. Luckily he is bound against inthralment.\r\n\r\nBy and by the house grew so lonely that I was fain to send for Leonora\r\nto make durance less vile. It was positively refreshing to hear her\r\nvoice sing through the solemn old hall. Very warm was the welcome she\r\nreceived from both Fred and me. He had often said she was the only woman\r\nhe could talk to without suppressing a yawn. It was ungallant of him,\r\nbut I could sympathize with the sentiment. Women usually weary me. I\r\ntold Leonora she must make up her mind to stay with me, as long as she\r\nremained unmarried.\r\n\r\nFred, holding her hand, laughingly made her promise never to take a\r\nhusband without his consent. While I passed on, he drew her back; the\r\nmirror above the door framed a picture prettier than I liked to see.\r\n\r\n'There is but one man I will authorize you to marry,' said my son.\r\n\r\nThen it suddenly flashed on my mind that Fred was of the age of Scott's\r\nheroes, and would be sure to fall in love with a woman older than\r\nhimself. The love did not matter so much, but marriage would be an\r\nabsurdity. I expected to have a daughter-in-law some day or other; but\r\nit was never to be Leonora. In a hundred ways she had resisted me, and\r\novercome me. I was as resolutely opposed to her, as if she had been my\r\nenemy. She was a connection of the family, independent, yet in some sort\r\nalone in the world. If it had been conferring a favor on her, to ask her\r\nto stay with me, be sure I never would have uttered a persuasive word.\r\nBut it was asking her to leave gay society, and the incense of\r\nadmiration, to bury herself in a dull house. Then she was 'ornamental;'\r\nI liked to see her about; she was satirical, and pleased me by a little\r\nspicy abuse. They called her handsome. She _was_ too small, I think, too\r\nslight, perhaps; and then her complexion was almost swarthy. But her\r\nhair was fine, her eyes large and brilliant, and her mouth mobile and\r\nsweet. The face was nothing to me; but her companionship was enlivening.\r\n\r\nThe young lady professed herself glad of a winter of exclusion, and when\r\nI saw how she set herself at work with books and embroidery, I confess I\r\nwas astonished at her resignation. Then I saw her look at my son, and\r\nperceived she did not find it so _very_ stupid after all. Slowly she\r\nsnarled him in her meshes.\r\n\r\nOne time my husband had a friendless youth for his secretary, called\r\nDenis Christopher. His name attracted me before his person. Mr.\r\nFontevrault became so deeply interested in his character and talents,\r\nthat he used his extensive influence, and gave Mr. Christopher an\r\nenviable lift over the world's rough places. Fontevrault was like a\r\ngrieved child when he left us. I was sorry, but concealed it. One of the\r\nyoung man's agreeable privileges had been to attend me in public, thus\r\nrelieving Mr. Fontevrault. I assure you he was more knightly than his\r\nmaster, whose stiff protection I never missed while under Launcelot's\r\ntender care. I never fully admitted to myself the power I found in the\r\nhitherto unknown fascination of a _young_ man's society; nor how much\r\npleasure I took in touching those hidden chords that only respond to a\r\nwoman's touch. That he adored me, I saw in his eyes. I liked it well,\r\nand the strange, unwonted feeling that shivered through me, now, when by\r\nchance my hand touched his.\r\n\r\nWell--people began to talk, as people will, and Mr. Fontevrault sent him\r\nto Malaga. He came to bid me good-by; 'forever,' he thought; ah me! It\r\nwas forever in one sense. Fred was a mere boy then, who heard and saw\r\neverything. I had hard work to get him out of the house that morning. I\r\nwanted Denis's last look all to myself. Before he left me, Christopher\r\noffered me a bracelet of cornelians, cut rarely as seals. Each gem bore\r\nan exquisite device. On one were a few words in Latin. When I was alone,\r\nI pressed the seal on a drop of hot wax, and read his dedication.\r\n\r\nAll that was years ago; he is here again, and I am free. I sat before\r\nthe glass long the day I expected him, threading my brown hair, and\r\nlonging to wear his color--blue. But then the widow's cap suited me\r\ndivinely, and the folds of crape set off my peculiar tints as nothing\r\nelse can. I came before him; he started forward to seize both hands, and\r\ngaze in my face, to find no change. Then he pressed his lips to my warm\r\nwhite fingers. A new boldness became his, a new timidity mine.\r\n\r\nFresh from lessons of my own, I could read a change in Leonora, and\r\nperceive mischief in the air. Her extreme quietness when my son entered\r\nthe apartment, the faint shade of shyness in his manner of addressing\r\nher attracted me curiously. He began to linger in our haunts so long and\r\non such frivolous pretexts, that I began seriously to think what was to\r\nbe done with such a lovesick page. To oppose Fred would be worse than\r\nuseless. Opposition determined him. If I could have sent her away,\r\nsolitude would be my bane; for not one of the Fontevraults could I\r\nendure. Then as I pondered, I laughed at the absurdity of the whole\r\nthing. Not only was Leonora older than the student, a woman in society,\r\nbut she had been engaged (with that fact I resolved to frighten Fred),\r\nnor would she wait five years for him to declare his passion. And his\r\nflickering fancy the slightest breath of doubt would change: a nature\r\neasily moulded by the inexorable. I resolved to let affairs take their\r\nown course, and trust her common sense, and my own gentle diplomacy.\r\n\r\nWhat memorable meetings had we four during those sharp winter days! I\r\nlived as in an Arabian dream. There was Denis Christopher, with his\r\nbrown face and thrilling eyes; Fred lackadaisical, but handsome as\r\nAntinous; Leonora, and I.\r\n\r\nA very orderly company, but what hot feeling repressed, what romantic\r\npossibility, what fates unfulfilled lay under the courteous\r\nconventionality of the time! Fred leaned over Leonora at the piano.\r\nTheir voices sounded well together, and if he could not declare his\r\nadmiration of her, no doubt he conveyed it to her in some tender refrain\r\nor serenade. Their blended, passionate voices often moved me in a\r\nstrange excitement, for I was not musical. I had no way of relieving\r\nmyself, as these singers and painters have, who crystallize an emotion\r\nor a sorrow into a picture or a cadence. I can only gnaw the bedpost, or\r\ntear up something, in the mere need of expression. Denis watched them\r\nawhile, and then it became a trio instead of a duet. Mr. Christopher\r\nbrought Spanish music. Light, rippling airs, dances, whose strange\r\nswaying rhythm had been borne to his ears in the Malaga nights.\r\n\r\nMy son grew jealous, therefore unreasonable. He would not play\r\nsubordinate, so left Leonora no choice but to lend herself gracefully to\r\nDenis's companionship. These two were sure to misunderstand one another.\r\nFred was contradictory. With intense and variable feeling, he possessed\r\nthe traits of slower natures. A kind of natural prudence retarded him.\r\nHe puzzled Leonora. One moment he cooed over her, the next became\r\nHoratian. Painfully sensitive, and proud withal, she was never sure of\r\nhis opinion of her. Having little faith in the firmness of any man's\r\nadmiration of _her_, she believed less than was avowed. And Fred,\r\nexacting much, was too inexperienced to understand her. They were\r\ndrifting apart, I thought; but in avoiding Scylla, had I not plunged\r\ninto Charybdis?\r\n\r\nI had been a widow a year when Mr. Christopher left Spain. Another had\r\nnow passed, and with it my seclusion. While Denis had talked to me, I\r\nhad cared to hear no other man speak; but now, in a kind of thirst, I\r\ndrank deep of pleasure. I played with the warm avowals of men past the\r\nreasoning age, and made Fred's classmates melancholy. Denis did not even\r\ndisapprove. He was often near me now, but silent as a shadow.\r\n\r\nHow it stormed the night of the seventh of February, and like the\r\nwhirling snow I danced! Christopher led me through the last Lancers, and\r\nthen we stopped to rest. Hanging on his arm, and heedless of to-morrow,\r\nwas I not happy? We passed through the long rooms, while the soft waltz\r\nmusic began to swell, and the untiring dancers took the floor.\r\n\r\nI remember he asked for Leonora, and then if Fred meant to marry her. I\r\nwould not say no, but would acknowledge that his fancy was heated.\r\n\r\n'She will be a pleasant vision of boy-love a few years hence,' I said.\r\n'Leonora has too much good sense to marry him, Mr. Christopher.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know,' said he, meditatively, and drew my hand through his arm.\r\nThe cornelian bracelet slipped into view. 'Mrs. Fontevrault,' uttered\r\nhe, in a ceremonious tone--my warm pulse grew still--'do you never\r\nforget?'\r\n\r\n'Do you desire it?' I answered, gaily:\r\n\r\n   ''If to remember, or forget,\r\n   Can give a longing, or regret,\r\n\r\ncommand me.'\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and, stopping at a side table, poured out two glasses of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n'Here's to the past,' said he, eagerly; 'drink Lethe.'\r\n\r\nWe drained the glasses. Then I understood he withdrew his claim.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go home after _that_; so Mr. Christopher summoned the\r\ncarriage. The walks were white, and I trembled--was it with cold?--as he\r\nhanded me in, and bade me good night.\r\n\r\nThe house at midnight was silent and warm. I went up stairs, and stood\r\nin the threshold of the library. The sleet driving against the window\r\npanes prevented their hearing me, I suppose. They seemed to be\r\ntranslating something or other. Fred's arm lay over the back of her\r\nchair. Very fast and earnestly he was talking. Marginal notes suggested\r\nby the text of Sismondi?\r\n\r\n'What, home so early!' was his exclamation, on discovering me.\r\n\r\nLeonora looked, up with a deep rose in her dark cheeks, a dangerous fire\r\nmelting in her eyes. I had left her pale, with a headache.\r\n\r\n'You are better, I conclude. I expected to find you among your pillows,'\r\nsaid I, accusative.\r\n\r\n'I have cured her,' said Fred, coming forward and clasping my hands in\r\nhis firm, cool hold. 'What ails you, mamma? You look as if you had a\r\nfever, and wickedly handsome. What have you been about?' He slipped off\r\nmy ermine cloak, and kissed me with a mixture of pride and love. The boy\r\nbewildered me.\r\n\r\nAs fate would have it, Fred was right. I felt very ill. I believe I\r\n_resisted_ a fever, for I have a sensation of struggle connected with\r\nthat sickness. But I cannot separate the pictures of my distempered\r\nfancy from the actualities of the time. Leonora took devoted care of me.\r\nNight after night Fred sat by me, and they relieved each other. Like one\r\nbound in an enchantment, I lay unable to prevent their mutual\r\nconfidence, and the return of her young lover's adoring regard.\r\n\r\nHe sat beside her as the fire burned low; his blonde hair touched her\r\ndusky cheek as he bent over her.\r\n\r\n'Leo, darling, I wish I was sick, like mamma.'\r\n\r\n'Hush!' said she.\r\n\r\n'Then you would soothe me, and part my hair with your soft fingers, that\r\nrefuse to touch mine now. You would be sorry for me, and give me a\r\nlittle caressing, and I should be so happy I would not get well.'\r\n\r\n'Don't talk so, Fred. You used to be an even-tempered, comfortable kind\r\nof young man to know. But now you are really teasing.'\r\n\r\n'Do I really annoy you?'\r\n\r\n'Very much.'\r\n\r\n'And you don't believe in me. Sometimes a dumb kind of philosophy\r\npossesses me, and I say to myself, let her think of me as she will. I\r\ncannot be frank, and must take the consequences. Then again----'\r\n\r\nHere she rose, and he put both arms around her. Audacious boy!\r\n\r\n'Fred!' was uttered in a stifled voice.\r\n\r\n'Promise me to send off Christopher,' ejaculated the young man.\r\n\r\nThe corners of the room seemed to stretch away indefinitely. A heavy\r\nperfume suffocated me. I groaned. In another moment Leonora was beside\r\nme, and the fresh air was blowing in from a window my son had opened.\r\n\r\nI made haste to get well. The physicians say my constitution and good\r\nnursing saved me; but it was all resolution. My _will_ was stronger than\r\nthe disease. As soon as I could sit up and see him, Denis Christopher\r\nwas admitted. I used to hear a dulcet strain on the stairs, formed by\r\nher delicate note and his melodious base, and then he would follow\r\nLeonora in to pay his respects to me; always bringing something to\r\nbrighten up my boudoir, and render her imprisonment less unendurable.\r\nAfterward he would never be exiled to the drawing rooms. Fred frowned at\r\nthe ease with which he invaded our retirement, but only frowned. He and\r\nI began to wonder if Christopher would win her. Valiantly but cautiously\r\nwas he wooing. Fred went off on a boating excursion, and I grew weary. I\r\nwished I had died. The secret of my good looks was confessed. Perfect\r\nhealth had kept my beauty undimmed. But colorless and hollow-eyed the\r\nfever left me. I could look at myself no more; so I looked at Leonora.\r\nShe was pretty, with a charm that did not depend on tint or outline. Her\r\nnew friend was penetrated by her real graces and his ideal rendering of\r\nthem; but would he conquer? I was sure not. Because separation is sure\r\nalienation at a certain age, I resolved on Fred's speedy withdrawal from\r\nthe scene. Why not go abroad immediately after his graduation, which was\r\nto occur in a few weeks? On his return I suggested it. He gloomily\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\n'Will you come, too, mamma?'\r\n\r\n'Not yet; in the course of a year perhaps;' and I looked over to the\r\ncorner where Leonora was winding worsted from Mr. Christopher's fingers.\r\n\r\n'Come, now,' said he, 'take Leonora, and we will set up housekeeping in\r\nthe easy continental style.'\r\n\r\n'She has her hands full just now.' Literally as well as figuratively\r\ntrue, for she had wound two enormous green balls.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps she will go over with Mr. Christopher. Would you like a call\r\nfrom the bride and groom?'\r\n\r\nMy young Fontevrault looked at me.\r\n\r\n'Do you speak as you know, mamma?'\r\n\r\n'Look for yourself, my hoodwinked Cupid. Girls are all alike, Fred. He\r\ncan ask her to marry him, and has that advantage over you.'\r\n\r\nSo it was decided that Fred should go to Paris, and be happy. Mrs.\r\nBlanchard gave him a farewell party, and all the young ladies were at\r\ntheir sweetest. Fred behaved with sullen dignity, as a lion should. He\r\nrefused to be comforted by Adelaide and Rose, walking about with one or\r\nanother, and looking at Leonora, at whom all mankind were gazing that\r\nnight. She was in dashing spirits, a glorious color diffused her cheeks,\r\nher eyes fairly danced. Her dress was of feathery black tulle, and a\r\nbroad silver ribbon, like an order, went over her shoulders. In the\r\nshining black braids glistened fern leaves of silver filigree.\r\nFortunately, Fred and I discovered them--Leonora and her inseparable\r\ncavalier, Denis, I mean--in an alcove of roses and jessamines. She\r\nadmiring the flowers, and he talking with a fervor very easy to read.\r\nShe listening, as women always listen when the pleader is eloquent. But\r\nin her downcast face I read only pain, while my son translated the deep\r\nblush differently. When we were at home, and I waited to bid him good\r\nnight, he took me in his strong arms:\r\n\r\n'You love me, mamma, don't you?'\r\n\r\nHe was all I had in the world, so I told him.\r\n\r\nThen followed a week we long remembered--the first week of Denis's\r\nabsence. Leonora was gloomy and _distraite_; Fred cool as a peak of the\r\nAndes, and about as unapproachable; I immersed in the hurry and\r\nconfusion of my son's departure. He had a suite of rooms over mine,\r\nand, the night before he went away, leaned over the ballusters, and\r\ncalled, as in old time:\r\n\r\n'Leonora!'\r\n\r\nShe gave a glad start, and ran up to him. So I followed, of course. I\r\nwanted to put some flannels into his trunk, which stood in his bedroom.\r\nThe doors were open between us. He had a bundle of her letters tied up\r\nin a bulky packet, and began to talk with great discretion.\r\n\r\n'I have been putting my affairs in order,' said the systematic young\r\nman. 'I may never come back, and at any rate, my absence will be long. I\r\nthought it would be better to give you these, lest they fall into alien\r\nhands.'\r\n\r\n'Why not burn them?' suggested his listener.\r\n\r\n'I could not, Leo.'\r\n\r\n'I am not so sentimental,' she returned, taking up the packet. 'They\r\nshall blaze directly. Do you want your own?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Fred, what a bungler you are!' I thought.\r\n\r\n'You misunderstand,' he began, in a desperate tone.\r\n\r\n'Fred!' I screamed, as if I were twenty rods distant, 'do come and open\r\nthis bureau drawer. I can't move it.'\r\n\r\nHe came, pulling it open, with such needless strength, that all the\r\ntoilette bottles garnishing the top were shaken off, and lay in\r\nfragments on the floor. She followed to note the disaster, and I took\r\nher down stairs, and watched over her like a dragon all that evening. I\r\nwould not let Leonora go to the steamer with us, but compelled him to\r\nsay farewell in my presence, I _like_ a scene. He held her hand long,\r\nuttering some incoherent sentences. Admirable was the self-composure she\r\nshowed! The delicate muscles about the mouth were as steady as if she\r\ndid not love him. She never raised her eyes until the last. As I saw\r\ntheir sad beauty, a pang seized me, and I turned away. He came after,\r\nhurried me into the carriage, and off we whirled.\r\n\r\n'Are you going to write to her?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'She says no,' Fontevrault answered, and looked vigorously out of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne evening, two years after my son left me, we were sitting round the\r\nlibrary fire. Christoper, now a captain in one of the famous\r\nMassachusetts regiments, sat near me, a little older and a little graver\r\nthan when I saw him last. We were talking with flushed cheeks and\r\nbeating hearts of the subject nearest our hearts just then--war.\r\n\r\nA familiar foot pressed the stair. All the color left Leonora's lips;\r\nshe knew who was coming. In another moment I was in my darling's arms.\r\nHe shook hands with Leonora, but neither of them spoke a word; then\r\nturned to Cristopher, who welcomed him with the hearty cordiality men\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n'You have come home to fight, I know, Fontevrault.'\r\n\r\n'So I have,' answered my son. 'Every true-hearted American should be\r\nstriking his blow. I couldn't travel fast enough. Mother, are you a\r\nSpartan?'\r\n\r\nHe looked at Leonora. What did she think of this magnificent-mustached\r\nSaxon? Not much like the fair-cheeked student we remembered.\r\n\r\n'Let us be army nurses,' said Leonora, when they had gone to Washington.\r\nIndeed we could not stay where we were, nor flit off to Newport to\r\nbanish care. I grew sleepless, and a sudden sound would send the blood\r\nto my heart. Leonora maintained an undaunted front, but she grew thin in\r\nspite of her cheerfulness. At last I said:\r\n\r\n'We will follow the army; I shall die to live in this way.'\r\n\r\nSo, just before the battle of Antietam, we were in Washington.\r\n\r\nJust after--ah me!--a singular scene occurred. We four had met again,\r\nnot as in the happy nights long gone. Denis, the veteran of seven\r\nbattles, still stood unscathed; but my boy could fight no more.\r\nManfully he bore his affliction; I only wept.\r\n\r\nThis morning of which I write, he was so bright, that we admitted Denis\r\nat once, who came to bid us farewell before leaving to join his\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n'Stop a minute,' said Fred. 'Leonora.' She came toward him with a face\r\nof gentle inquiry.\r\n\r\n'To-day is my birthday,' prefaced the soldier. 'I am twenty-six, and a\r\nfree man to say I love you.' Denis minced and motioned to withdraw his\r\nhand. (Not so fast, old fellow.) This I say because I have been waiting\r\nyears to speak my mind on this day. But now, I have nothing to offer\r\nyou. I have no future. I am a cripple; even my love for you has been a\r\ncheat to you; and now is selfishness in me. Here stands a man as true to\r\nyou as I; I know how he loves you. Which of us will you marry, Leonora?'\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, the lost carnation came back to her cheeks. The\r\nsoft eyes kindled to a languid fire. She never looked at Denis, who\r\nstood in his erect strength, his worshipping eyes on her face. She came\r\nto Fred's bedside, and knelt down there. Denis dropped his hand.\r\n\r\n'You do not answer,' Fred whispered; 'I cannot bear suspense.'\r\n\r\nHow did she satisfy him? I do not know. In emotion that almost\r\novermastered me, I snapped the bracelet--Denis's bracelet; it lay upon\r\nthe floor. He passed me without a word, without a look. His heavy heel\r\nground the enchased seal to rosy dust. I heard the door swung loudly to,\r\nand then the clatter of his horse's hoofs, as he rode rapidly away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN OPINION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to an accomplished gentleman in Philadelphia for the\r\nfollowing translation from the _Revue Nationale_ of M. Laboulaye. Any\r\nextended comment from our pen would only serve to weaken the effect of\r\nthis eloquent and truthful passage. We may, however, express our\r\ngratification to find that some generous spirits in Europe still remain\r\nsuperior to the jealousies and the malevolence which have so largely\r\naffected the ruling classes there, and led them so generally to hope for\r\nand to predict the downfall of our suffering country. Hitherto we have\r\nindeed recognized the truth that 'the opinion of Europe is a power;' but\r\nwe have felt it chiefly in its worst influence, against us, and in favor\r\nof the rebellion. Now, however, in this the darkest hour of our mortal\r\nstruggle, it affords real relief to hear the most enlightened men of\r\nthat continent proclaiming that 'the arguments of the South are\r\nbeginning to fail,' and 'that all the ingenuity in the world cannot lift\r\nup its fallen cause.' Nor is it at all difficult to give entire credence\r\nto these statements, for there is evidently an altered tone even in\r\nthose organs of European opinion which have been, and still are\r\nconsistently hostile to us. It was perhaps unavoidable that\r\nmisunderstanding should prevail in the outset, and that the ear of\r\nEurope should have been complacently open to the representations of the\r\nplausible South, urged as they were by the ablest and most unscrupulous\r\nof her advocates. But truth was destined certainly to make its way in\r\nthe end. It was only doubtful whether the triumph of right would take\r\nplace soon enough to bring the force of European opinion to bear on the\r\ncontest and to deprive the South of that moral support which alone has\r\nenabled her to prolong the hopeless struggle to the present time. But,\r\naccording to M. Laboulaye, the 'fatal service' which its advocates have\r\ndone the South, is just now about to bear its appropriate fruit; for the\r\ndelusive promise of support which has thus far sustained the rebel cause\r\nis utterly gone, and with it, all possibility of ultimate success.\r\n\r\nSeldom have we read a nobler passage than that in which this\r\naccomplished writer appeals to the French sentiment of national unity to\r\njustify our Northern people in their mighty struggle to subdue this\r\n'impious revolt.' Americans themselves, though fully imbued with the\r\ninstinctive feeling which it defends, could not more forcibly have\r\npresented the point. And, indeed, if we may believe the statements now\r\nprevalent, attributing to eminent statesmen and large parties a\r\ndisposition to accede to the separation of the sections, the very\r\nsentiment of nationality has lost it force among us, and we would be\r\ncompelled to acknowledge our obligations to this eminent Frenchman for\r\nstimulating our expiring patriotism and awakening us to the vital\r\nimportance of our national unity and to the shame and disgrace of\r\nsurrendering it. If any American has ever, for a moment, admitted the\r\nidea of consenting to a separation of the Union, let him read the\r\nburning words of this enlightened and disinterested foreigner, and blush\r\nfor his want of comprehension of the true interests and glory of his\r\ncountry. It is not a mere sentimental enthusiasm which leads us to\r\ncombat disunion and to cherish the greatness and oneness of our country.\r\nOur dearest rights and our noblest interests are alike involved, and we\r\nwould be craven wretches, unworthy of our high destiny, if we did not\r\nrisk everything and sacrifice everything to preserve them. 'The North\r\nonly defends itself,' says M. Laboulaye. 'It is its very life that it\r\nwishes to save.'\r\n\r\nBriefly, but with the hand of a master, does this article point out the\r\nconsequences of disunion. The touches by which the sketch is drawn, are\r\nfew and rapidly made; but they faithfully portray the great features of\r\nthe case, and present a true and living picture to the mind of every\r\nthoughtful man. The jealousies, the rivalries, the antipathies of the\r\nsections; the foreign intrigues and eventual foreign domination among\r\nour fragmentary governments; the large standing armies, and the\r\ncompeting naval forces; and finally, 'the endless war and numberless\r\nmiseries' which will inevitably result--all these mighty evils will not\r\nonly afflict our own unhappy country, but 'peace will be exiled from the\r\nworld.' The interests of mankind are involved in this tremendous\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nBut we no longer keep our readers from the perusal of this interesting\r\nextract. Let it be remembered that it comes from the quarter understood\r\nto be most unfriendly to us, where the wily emperor of the French is\r\nsupposed to be plotting for the destruction of our nationality and\r\npower. The appeal to the interests of France against the ambition of\r\nEngland is striking and powerful. Whatever disposition the emperor may\r\ncherish against us, the French people ought to be our friends; they have\r\na common interest in maintaining the freedom of the seas, and\r\nwe have yet to complain that any port of France has sent out cruisers to\r\nassail our commerce on the ocean.\r\n\r\nLet us take courage, even in this hour of disaster. Noble spirits abroad\r\nare still watching us with generous sympathy and praying for the success\r\nof our sacred cause. Let us be true to ourselves and to our country, and\r\nthe hour of final triumph will soon be at hand. Though dissensions tend\r\nnow to distract and weaken us, and though darkness, more impenetrable\r\nthan ever before, seems lately to have gathered around us, we already\r\ndiscern the first glimmerings of the dawn in the east. The full day will\r\nsoon break upon us, and we shall rejoice in the splendor of returning\r\npeace and renewed prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS WHY THE NORTH CANNOT PERMIT SECESSION.\r\n\r\n(_From the French of_ EDOUARD LABOULAYE, _published in the_ 'Revue\r\nNationale,' _December 10th, 1862._)\r\n\r\nThe civil war which has been dividing and ruining the United States for\r\ntwo years also affects us in Europe. The scarcity of cotton causes great\r\nsuffering. The workmen of Rouen and Mulhouse are as severely tried as\r\nthe spinners and weavers of Lancashire; entire populations are reduced\r\nto beggary, and to exist through the winter they have no resource and no\r\nhope save in special charity or assistance from the government. In so\r\nsevere a crisis, and in the midst of such unmerited sufferings, it is\r\nbut natural that public opinion should become restless in Europe, and\r\ncondemn the ambition of those who prolong a fratricidal war. Peace in\r\nAmerica, peace is a necessity at any price, is the cry of thousands of\r\nmen among us who are suffering from hunger, innocent victims of the\r\npassions and madness which steep the United States in blood.\r\n\r\nThese complaints are only too just. The civilized world is at present,\r\nso bound together, that peace is one great condition of the existence of\r\nmodern industrial nations; unhappily, although it is easy to point out\r\nthe remedy, it is almost impossible to apply it. Just now it is by war\r\nalone that ending of the war may be looked for. To throw herself armed\r\nbetween the combatants would be an attempt in which Europe would exhaust\r\nher strength; and to what purpose? As Mr. Cobden has justly said, it\r\nwould be less costly to feed the work people who are ruined by the\r\nAmerican crisis _on game and champagne_. To offer to-day our friendly\r\nmediation is not only to expose ourselves to a refusal, and perhaps so\r\nexasperate one of the parties as to push it to more violent measures,\r\nbut to diminish the chances of our mediation being accepted at a more\r\nfavorable moment. Thus we are forced to remain spectators of a\r\ndeplorable war, which is the cause of infinite evil to us; thus forced\r\nto offer up prayers that exhaustion and misery may appease these mortal\r\nenemies and oblige them to accept either reunion or separation. A sad\r\nsituation, doubtless, but one which neutrals have always occupied, and\r\nfrom which they cannot depart without throwing themselves among unknown\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nIf we have not the right to interfere, we can at least complain, and try\r\nto discover those who are really wrong in this war, which so affects us.\r\nThe opinion of Europe is a power. It can hasten matters and restore\r\npeace better than arms can. Unfortunately, for two years opinion has\r\nwandered from the proper path, and by taking the wrong side of the\r\nquestion, prolongs instead of stopping resistance. The South has found\r\nmany and clever advocates in England and in France, who have presented\r\nher cause as that of justice and liberty. They have proclaimed the right\r\nof secession, and have not feared to apologize for slavery. Their\r\narguments to-day are beginning to fail. Thanks to those publicists who\r\ndo not traffic with humanity; thanks to M. de Gasparin, above all, the\r\nlight has made things clear; we know now how things stand as to the\r\norigin and character of the rebellion. To every disinterested observer,\r\nit is evident that the South is wrong in every way. It needs not a\r\nMontesquieu to understand that a party not menaced in the least, which,\r\nthrough ambition or pride, tears its country to pieces and destroys its\r\nnational unity, has no right to the sympathies of the French. As to\r\ndeclaring slavery sacred, that is a work which must be left to the\r\npreachers of the South. All the ingenuity in the world cannot lift up\r\nthis fallen cause. Had the confederates a thousand reasons for complaint\r\nand for revolt, there would always rest on their rebellion an indelible\r\nstain. No Christian, no liberal person will ever interest himself for\r\nmen who, in this nineteenth century, insolently proclaim their desire to\r\nperpetuate and extend slavery. Though it is still permitted to the\r\nplanters to listen to theories that have infatuated and lost them, such\r\nsophistries will never cross the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the South have done it a fatal service; they have made\r\nit believe that Europe, enlightened or seduced, would range itself on\r\nits side and finally throw into the balance something more than empty\r\npromises. This delusion has and still maintains the resistance of the\r\nSouth, it prolongs the war, and with it our sufferings. If, as the North\r\nhad a right to expect, the friends of liberty had, from the first,\r\nboldly pronounced against the policy of slavery, if the advocates of\r\npeace upon the seas, if the defenders of the rights of neutrals had\r\nspoken in favor of the Union and rejected a separation, which could only\r\nprofit England, it is probable that the South would have been less\r\nanxious to start on a journey without visible end. If, in spite of the\r\ncourage and devotion of its soldiers; if, in spite of the ability of its\r\ngenerals, the South fails in an enterprise which, in my opinion, cannot\r\nbe too much blamed, let it lay the fault on those who have so poor an\r\nopinion of Europe as to imagine that they will subject _its_ opinion to\r\na policy against which patriotism protests, and which the gospel and\r\nhumanity condemn.\r\n\r\nWe will grant, they may say, that the South is altogether wrong;\r\nnevertheless it wishes to separate, it can no longer live with the\r\npeople of the North. The war alone, whatever may be its origin, is a new\r\ncause of disunion. By what right can twenty millions of men force ten\r\nmillions (of those ten millions there are four millions of slaves whose\r\nwill is not consulted in the least) of their countrymen to continue a\r\ndetested alliance, to respect a contract which they wish to break at any\r\nprice? Is it possible to imagine that after two or three years of\r\nfighting and misery, conquerors and conquered can be made to live\r\nharmoniously together? Can a country two or three times the size of\r\nFrance be subjugated? Would there not always be bloodshed between the\r\nparties? Separation is perhaps a misfortune, but now it is an\r\nirreparable one. Let us grant that the North has law, the letter and\r\nspirit of the Constitution on her side; there always remains an\r\nindisputable point--the South wishes to govern itself. You have no right\r\nto crush a people that defends itself so valiantly. Give it up!\r\n\r\nIf we were less enervated by the luxury of modern life and by the\r\nidleness of a long peace, if there still lingered in our hearts some\r\nremnant of that patriotism which, in 1792, urged our forefathers to the\r\nbanks of the Rhine, the answer would be simple; to-day I fear it will\r\nnot be understood. If the south of France should revolt to-morrow and\r\ndemand a separation; if Alsace and Lorraine should wish to withdraw,\r\nwhat would be, I will not say our right only, but our duty? Would we\r\ncount voices to see if a third or a half of the French had a right to\r\ndestroy our nationality, to annihilate France, to break up the glorious\r\nheritage our sires bought for us with their blood? No! we would shoulder\r\nour muskets and march. Woe to the man who does not feel his country to\r\nbe sacred, and that it is a noble act to defend it, even at the price of\r\nextreme misery and every danger!\r\n\r\n'America is not like France; it is a confederation, not a nation.' Who\r\nsays this? It is the South, and to justify its faults; the North asserts\r\nthe contrary, and for two years she has declared, by numberless\r\nsacrifices, that the Americans are one people, and that no one shall\r\ndivide their country. This is a grand and noble sentiment, and if\r\nanything astonishes me, it is that France can witness this patriotism\r\nunmoved. Is not love of country the crowning virtue of the Frenchman?\r\n\r\nWhat is this South, and whence does it derive this right of secession it\r\nproclaims so loudly? Is it a conquered nation which resumes its\r\nindependence, as Lombardy has done? Is it a distinct race which will not\r\ncontinue an oppressive alliance? No! it is a number of colonies,\r\nestablished on the territory of the Union by American hands. Take a map\r\nof the United States. Except Virginia, the two Carolinas and Georgia,\r\nwhich are old English colonies, all the rest of the South is situated on\r\nlands purchased and paid for by the Union. This proves that the North\r\nhas sustained the greatest part of the expense. Ancient Louisiana was\r\nsold to the Americans, in 1804, by the first consul at a price of\r\nfifteen millions of dollars; Florida was bought from Spain, in 1820, for\r\nfive millions; and it required the war with Mexico, a payment of ten\r\nmillions, and heavy losses besides, to acquire Texas. In a few words, of\r\nall the rich countries which border on the Mississippi and Missouri,\r\nfrom their sources to their mouths, there is not one inch of ground for\r\nwhich the Union has not paid, and which does not belong to her. The\r\nUnion has driven out or indemnified the Indians. The Union has built\r\nfortifications, constructed shipyards, light-houses, and harbors. It is\r\nthe Union that has made all this wilderness valuable and rendered its\r\nsettlement possible. It is the men of the North as well as those of the\r\nSouth who have cleared and planted these lands, and transformed them\r\nfrom barren solitudes to a flourishing condition. Show us, if you can,\r\nin old Europe, where unity is entirely the result of conquest, a title\r\nto property so sacred, a country which is more the common work of one\r\npeople! And shall it now be allowed to a minority to take possession of\r\na territory which belongs to all, and, moreover, to choose the best\r\nportion of it? Shall a minority be permitted to destroy the Union, and\r\nto imperil those who were its first benefactors, and without whom it\r\nwould never have existed? If this does not constitute an impious revolt,\r\nthen any whim that seizes a people is just and right. It is not only\r\npolitical reasons that oppose a separation; geography, the positions of\r\nplaces force the United States to form a single nation. Strabo,\r\nmeditating on this vast country now called France, said, with the\r\ncertainty of genius, that, to look at the nature of the territory, and\r\nthe course of the waters, it was evident that the forests of Gaul,\r\ninhabited by a thinly scattered people, would become the abode of a\r\ngreat people. Nature has disposed our territory to be the theatre of a\r\ngreat civilization. This is also true of America, which is really but a\r\ndouble valley, whose place of separation is imperceptible, and which\r\ncontains two large water courses, the Mississippi, and the St. Lawrence.\r\nThere are no high mountains which isolate and separate the people, no\r\nnatural barriers like the Alps and Pyrenees. The West cannot live\r\nwithout the Mississippi; it is a question of life and death to the\r\nWestern farmers to hold the mouth of the river. The United States felt\r\nthis from the first day of their existence. When the Ohio and\r\nMississippi were yet but streams lost in the forest, when the first\r\nplanters were only a handful of men scattered in the wilderness, the\r\nAmericans already knew that New Orleans was _the key of the house_. They\r\nwould not leave it either to Spain or France. Napoleon understood this;\r\nhe held in his hands the future greatness of the United States; he was\r\nglad to cede this vast territory to America, with the intention, he\r\nsaid, 'to give to England a maritime rival which sooner or later would\r\nlower the pride of our enemies.' (Here the author refers to his\r\npamphlet, entitled, _Les Etats Unis et la France_, and to _L'histoire de\r\nla Louisiane_, by Barbé Marbois.) He could have satisfied the United\r\nStates by only giving up the left bank of the river, which was all they\r\nasked for then; he did more (and in this I think he was very wrong),\r\nwith a stroke of his pen he ceded a country as large as the half of\r\nEurope, and renounced our last rights on this beautiful river which we\r\nhad discovered. Sixty years have quickly passed since this cession. The\r\nStates which are now called Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa,\r\nMinnesota, Kansas, Oregon, and the territories of Nebraska, Dacotah,\r\nJefferson and Washington, which will soon become States, have been\r\nestablished on the immense domain abandoned by Napoleon. Without\r\ncounting the slaveholding population which wishes to break up the Union,\r\nthere are ten millions of free citizens between Pittsburg and Fort\r\nUnion, who claim the course and mouth of the Mississippi as having been\r\nceded to them by France. It is from us that they hold their title and\r\ntheir possession. They have a right of sixty years, a right consecrated\r\nby labors and cultivation, a right which they have received from a\r\ncontract, and, better still, from nature, and from God.\r\n\r\nSee what it is they are reproached for defending; they are, forsooth,\r\nusurpers and tyrants, because they wish to hold what is their own,\r\nbecause they will not place themselves at the mercy of an ambitious\r\nminority. What would we say, if, to-morrow, Normandy, rising, should\r\npretend to hold for herself alone Rouen and Havre, and yet what is the\r\ninterest of the Seine compared to that of the Mississippi, which has a\r\ncourse of two thousand two hundred and fifty miles, and which receives\r\nall the waters of the West?\r\n\r\nTo possess New Orleans is to command a valley which embraces two thirds\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThey say 'we will neutralize the river.' We know what such promises are\r\nworth. We have seen what Russia did at the mouth of the Danube; the war\r\nof the Crimea was necessary to give to Germany the free use of her great\r\nriver. If a new war were to break out between Austria and Russia, we\r\nmight be sure that the possession of the Danube would be the stake\r\nplayed for. It could not be otherwise in America, from the day the\r\nMississippi would flow for more than three hundred miles between two\r\nforeign servile banks: the effect of the war has already been to prevent\r\nthe exportation of wheat and corn, the riches of the West. In 1861 it\r\nwas necessary to burn useless harvests, to the great prejudice of\r\nEurope, who profited by their exportation. The South itself feels the\r\nstrength of its position so well that its ambition is to separate the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi from the Eastern States, and to unite itself\r\nto the West, consigning the Yankees of New England to a solitude which\r\nwould ruin them. With the Mississippi for a bait, the Confederates hope\r\nto reestablish to their profit, that is, to the profit of slavery, the\r\nUnion which they have broken for fear of liberty[6]. We now see what is\r\nto be thought of the pretended tyranny of the North, and if it is true\r\nthat it wishes to oppress and to subjugate the South. On the contrary,\r\nthe North only defends itself. In maintaining the Union, it defends its\r\nrights, and it is its very life that it wishes to save.\r\n\r\nThus far I have only spoken of the material interests--interests which\r\nare lawful, and which, founded on solemn titles, give sacred rights; but\r\nif we examine moral and political interests which are of a superior\r\norder, we will understand better still that the North cannot give up\r\nwithout destroying itself. The United States is a republic, the most\r\nfree, and at the same time the mildest and most happy form of government\r\nthe world has ever seen. Whence comes this prosperity of the Americans?\r\nBecause they are alone upon an immense territory; they have never been\r\nobliged to concentrate their power and enfeeble liberty in order to\r\nresist the jealousy and ambition of their neighbors. In the United\r\nStates there was no standing army, no naval force; the Americans\r\nemployed the immense sums which we expend to avert or to sustain war, in\r\nopening schools, and in giving to all their citizens, poor or rich, that\r\neducation and that instruction which form the moral greatness and the\r\ntrue riches of the people. Their foreign policy was comprised in this\r\nmaxim: 'Never to mingle in the quarrels of Europe on the sole condition\r\nthat Europe will not interfere with their affairs, and will respect the\r\nliberty of the seas.' Thanks to these wise principles, which Washington\r\nleft them in his immortal testament, the United States have enjoyed, for\r\neighty years, a peace which has only been disturbed by Europe when, in\r\n1812, they were forced to resist England and sustain the rights of\r\nneutrals. We must count by hundreds of millions those sums that we have\r\nused during the last seventy years in the upholding our liberty in\r\nEurope; these hundreds of millions the United States have employed in\r\nimprovements of every description. Here is the secret of their\r\nprodigious fortune; it is their perfect independence which makes their\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose the separation finally accomplished, and that the new\r\nconfederation comprises all the Slave States; the North has at once lost\r\nboth its power and the foundations of that power. The Republic has\r\nreceived a mortal blow. There are in America two nations, side by side,\r\ntwo jealous rivals who are always on the point of attacking each other.\r\nPeace will not remove their antipathies; it will not efface the memory\r\nof the past greatness of the Union now destroyed; the victorious South\r\nwill, without doubt, be quite as friendly toward slavery, and as fond of\r\ndomination as ever. The enemies of slavery, now masters of their own\r\npolicy, will certainly not be soothed by the separation. What will the\r\nSouthern confederacy be to the North! It will be a foreign power\r\nestablished in America, with a frontier of one thousand five hundred\r\nmiles, unprotected on every side, and consequently continually\r\nthreatening or menaced. This power, hostile, because of its vicinity\r\nalone, and still more so by its institutions, will possess a very\r\nconsiderable portion of the New World; it will have half the coasts of\r\nthe Union; it will command the Gulf of Mexico, an inland sea one third\r\nthe size of the Mediterranean; it will be the mistress of the mouths of\r\nthe Mississippi, and can ruin at its pleasure the inhabitants of the\r\nWest. The fragments of the old Union will have to be always ready to\r\ndefend themselves against their rivals. Questions of customs and of\r\nfrontiers; rivalries, jealousies, in fact all the scourges of old Europe\r\nwill overwhelm America at once and together; she will have to establish\r\ncustom houses over an extent of five hundred leagues; to build and arm\r\nforts on this immense frontier, to keep on foot large standing armies,\r\nto maintain a naval force; in other words, she will have to renounce her\r\nold Constitution, to weaken her municipal independence by the\r\ncentralization of power. Farewell to the old and glorious liberty!\r\nFarewell to those institutions which made America the common refuge of\r\nall who could not exist in Europe! The work of Washington will be\r\ndestroyed; the situation will be full of dangers and difficulties. I\r\nunderstand how the prospect of such a future can delight those who have\r\nnever been able to forgive America her prosperity and greatness; history\r\nis full of such sad jealousies. Still better I understand and approve of\r\nthis, that a people accustomed to liberty should risk its last man and\r\ngive its last dollar to preserve the inheritance of its fathers. I do\r\nnot understand why there are persons in Europe who believe themselves\r\nliberal when they reproach the North for its generous resistance by\r\nadvising her disgracefully to relinquish her rights. War is certainly a\r\nfrightful evil, but from war a durable peace may issue, the\r\nSouth may tire of a struggle which exhausts its strength, the old Union\r\nmay again arise in its glory, and the future may be saved. What but\r\nendless war and numberless miseries can result from a separation? This\r\ndismemberment of a country is an irreparable evil; no people, no nation,\r\nwill submit to such a calamity until it no longer has any power to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I have reasoned in the supposition that the South would\r\nremain an independent power. But unless the West joins the confederates,\r\nand the Union reestablishes itself against New England, this\r\nindependence is a chimera: it might last for some time; but in ten or\r\ntwenty years, when the free population of the West would have doubled or\r\ntrebled itself, how would the South, necessarily much enfeebled by slave\r\nculture, compare with a people, thirty millions in number, enclosing it\r\non two sides? To resist successfully, the South would be forced to rely\r\non Europe; it could only live when protected by a great naval power, and\r\nEngland is the only one in a condition to guarantee for it its\r\nsovereignty. Here is a new danger for free America and for Europe. The\r\nSouth has no commercial marine, nor with slavery ever will have; England\r\nwill at once seize the monopoly of cotton, and will furnish capital and\r\nvessels to the South. In two words, the triumph of the South is the\r\nreinstatement of England on the continent, whence the policy of Louis\r\nXVI and Napoleon has driven her; it is enfeebled neutrality; it is\r\nFrance plunged anew into all the questions concerning the liberty of the\r\nseas, which have already cost her two centuries of struggles and\r\nsuffering. In defending its own rights, the American Union assured the\r\nindependence of the ocean. The Union once destroyed, the English will\r\nagain resume their preponderance, peace will be exiled from the world,\r\nand a policy will return which has only benefited our rivals.\r\n\r\nThis is what Napoleon felt; this is what is forgotten to-day. It would\r\nseem that history is but a collection of frivolous tales, good enough,\r\nperhaps, to amuse children; it would seem that no one wishes to\r\nunderstand the lessons of the past. If the experience of our fathers\r\nwere not lost on our ignorance, we would see that, while fighting for\r\nher independence, while upholding her national unity, the North is\r\ndefending our cause as well as her own. All our prayers should be for\r\nour old and faithful friends. The weakness of the United States will be\r\nour weakness, and on the first quarrel with England, we will too late\r\nregret having abandoned a policy that for forty years has been our\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nIn writing these pages, I do not expect to convert those persons who\r\nhave in their hearts an innate love of slavery; _I_ write for those\r\nhonest souls who allow themselves to be captivated by the grand visions\r\nof national independence which are continually shown to them in order to\r\ndazzle and mislead. The South has never been menaced, and at this late\r\nhour can return to the Union even with her slaves [the reader will\r\nremember that this article was published in December, 1862], and is only\r\nrequired not to destroy the national unity, and not to ruin political\r\nliberty. It cannot be repeated too often that the North is not an\r\naggressor--it only defends what every true citizen will defend--the\r\nnational compact, the integrity of the country. It is very sad that it\r\nshould have found so little sympathy in Europe, and, above all, in\r\nFrance. It counted on us, its hopes were in us; we have forsaken it, as\r\nif those sacred words Country and Liberty no longer found an echo in\r\nour breasts. Where is the time when all France cheered the young\r\nLafayette giving his sword to serve the Americans? Who has imitated him?\r\nWho has recalled this glorious memory? Have we become so old that our\r\nmemory has failed?\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to foresee what will be the issue of this war. The\r\nSouth may succeed; the North may split up, and wear itself out in\r\ninternal struggles. Perhaps the Union is already but a great memory.\r\nBut, whatever fortune may have in the future, it is the plain duty of\r\nevery man who has not allowed himself to be carried away by present\r\nsuccesses, to sustain and encourage the North to the last, to condemn\r\nthose whose ambition threatens the most beautiful and patriotic work the\r\nworld has ever beheld, to remain faithful until the end of the war, and\r\neven after defeat, should it come, to those who will have fought to the\r\nlast for the right and for liberty.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: This point of view has been thoroughly exposed by one of\r\nthe wisest citizens of America, EDWARD EVERETT, in 'The Questions of the\r\nDay,' New York, 1861.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOTS OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warmer climes of the South induced many Huguenots to settle in the\r\ncolony of Virginia, and their neat little cottages, covered with French\r\ngrapevines, and the wild honeysuckle, might be seen scattered along\r\nJames river, not far above Richmond. One writer of that day, says: 'Most\r\nof the French who lived at that town (_Monacan_) on James river, removed\r\nto Trent river, in North Carolina, where the rest were expected daily to\r\ncome to them, when I came away, which was in August, 1708.' In 1690,\r\nKing William sent to Virginia many of the Huguenot Refugees, his\r\nfollowers, who had taken shelter in England. Here they were naturalized\r\nby an especial act in 1699. Six hundred more came over, conducted by\r\ntheir pastor, Philip de Richebourg, locating themselves, about twenty\r\nmiles above Richmond, on lands formerly occupied by a powerful tribe of\r\nIndians. There is a church now near the spot, retaining its Indian name\r\nto this day. In 1700, the Virginia assembly exempted these French\r\nsettlers from taxation, and fully protected their rights.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a curious relic of the Huguenots in Virginia, which was\r\nfound in the family of a descendant. It is entitled: 'A register,\r\ncontaining the baptisms made within the church of the French Refugees,\r\nin the Manakin town, in Virginia, within the parish of King William, in\r\nthe year of our Lord 1721, the 25th of March. Done by Jacques Soblet,\r\nclerk.' This manuscript contains about twenty-five pages of foolscap\r\npaper, and remains a standing evidence of the fidelity of the Virginia\r\nHuguenots to their Christian duties and ordinances. As a specimen of\r\ntheir entries, we copy the following, literally, not even correcting\r\ntheir orthography:\r\n\r\n     'Jean Chastain fils de Jean ett de Marianne Chastain les pere et\r\n     mere nee le 26 Septembre, 1721, est baptise le 5 Octobre, par M.\r\n     Fountaine. Ils ava pour parun et marene Pierre David et Anne sa\r\n     femme le quels ont declaree que cest enfan nee le jour et an que\r\n     deshus.\r\n\r\n          Segnee\r\n             JACQUE SOBLET,\r\n                Clerk.'\r\n\r\n     John Chastain, son of John Chastain and of Marianne Chastain, the\r\n     father and mother, born the 26th of September, 1721, was baptized\r\n     the 5th of October, by Mr. Fontaine. He had for godfather and\r\n     godmother Peter David and Anne, his wife, who have declared that\r\n     this infant was born the day and year aforesaid.\r\n\r\n          Signed, JACQUE SOBLET, Clerk.\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the pages contain records of deaths. Here is one:\r\n\r\n     'Le 29 de Janvier, 1723-4, morut le Sieur Authonoine Trabue, agee\r\n     danviron sinquaint six a sept annees fut en terree le 30 du meme\r\n     moy.\r\n\r\n          J.

SOBLETT, Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHuguenot names found in this old register of baptism:\r\n\r\n     'Chastain, David, Monford, Dykar, Neim, (_Minister_) Dupuy, Bilbo,\r\n     Dutoi, Salle, Martain, Allaigre, Vilain, Soblet, Chambou, Levilain,\r\n     Trabu, Loucadon, Harris, Gasper, Wooldridge, Flournoy, Amis,\r\n     Banton, Ford, Laisain, Lolaigre, Givodan, Mallet, Dubruil,\r\n     Guerrant, Sabbatie, Dupre, Bernard, Amonet, Porter, Rapine, Lacy,\r\n     Watkins, Cocke, Bondurant, Goin, Pero, Pean, Deen, Robinson,\r\n     Edmond, Brook, Brian, Faure, Don, Bingli, Reno, Lesuer, Pionet,\r\n     Trent, Sumpter, Moiriset, Jordin, Gavain.\r\n\r\n     Names of Negroes: Thomberlin (Northumberland), Ivan, Jaque, Janne,\r\n     Anibal, Guillaume, Jean, Pierre, Olive, Robert, Jak, Julienne,\r\n     Francois, Susan, Primus, Moll, Chamberlain, Dick, Pegg, Nanny,\r\n     Tobie, Dorole, Agar, Agge, Pompe, Frank, Cæsar, Amy, Joham, Debora,\r\n     Tom, Harry, Cipio, Bosen, Sam, Tabb, Jupiter, Essek, Cuffy, Orange,\r\n     Robin, Belin, Samson, Pope, Dina, Fillis, Matilda, Ester, Yarmouth,\r\n     Judy, and Adam.'\r\n\r\nWe find in Beverly's 'History of Virginia,' a very interesting account\r\nof the Manakin French Refugees: 'The assembly was very bountiful to\r\nthose who remained at this town, bestowing on them large donations,\r\nmoney and provisions for their support; they likewise freed them from\r\nevery public tax for several years to come, and addressed the governor\r\nto grant them a brief to entitle them to the charity of all\r\nwell-disposed persons throughout the country, which, together with the\r\nking's benevolence, supported them very comfortably, till they could\r\nsufficiently supply themselves with necessaries, which they now do\r\nindifferently well, and begin to have stocks of cattle, which are said\r\nto give abundantly more milk than any other in the country. I have heard\r\nthat these people are upon a design of getting into the breed of\r\nbuffaloes, to which end they lay in wait for their calves, that they may\r\ntame and raise a stock of them; in which, if they succeed, it will in\r\nall probability be greatly for their advantage; for these are much\r\nlarger than other cattle, and have the benefit of being natural to the\r\nclimate. They now make many of their own clothes, and are resolved, as\r\nsoon as they have improved that manufacture, to apply themselves to the\r\nmaking of wine and brandy, which they do not doubt to bring to\r\nperfection.' The Rev. J. Fontaine, a Calvinistic clergyman, first\r\npreached to his Refugee French brethren in England and Ireland (1688).\r\nThen his sons emigrated to Virginia, and became settled ministers. From\r\nthis stock alone, including his son-in-law, Mr. Maury, have descended\r\nhundreds of the best citizens of that commonwealth--ministers, members\r\nof the bar, legislators, and public officers. The Rev. Dr. Hawks\r\nestimates the relations of these Fontaine families, in the United\r\nStates, at not less than _two thousand_.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, he found in a family under his parochial charge, a\r\nmanuscript autobiography of one of its ancestors. This was a James\r\nFontaine, who was a persecuted Huguenot, and endured much for the sake\r\nof his religion. The work has been translated and published, and is full\r\nof interest--'A Tale of the Huguenots; or, Memoirs of a French Refugee\r\nFamily, with an Introduction, by F. L. Hawks, D.D.'\r\n\r\nM. Fontaine was a noble example of a true Huguenot. In his early life,\r\nhe was accustomed to the enjoyments of wealth, education, and refined\r\nsociety; but, for conscience' sake, he was stripped of them all, and\r\nforced to leave his native land. An exile in England, ignorant of its\r\nlanguage, and unaccustomed to labor, he soon accommodated himself to his\r\naltered circumstances. He became a skillful artisan, and worked\r\nsuccessfully at his trade; at first he opened a little store, with a\r\nschool also, to teach the French language, and he says: 'We were in\r\ngreat hopes, that with both together we should be able to pay our way.'\r\nM. Fontaine next undertook the manufactory of worsted goods, which he\r\nprofitably carried on for some time, but became tired of the business.\r\nHe was anxious to unite with a French church, and, knowing that there\r\nwere many Refugees in the land, went to Cork in 1695.\r\n\r\nAt first he preached in the English church, after its regular pastor had\r\nfinished his services. Next, the French Refugees obtained the court room\r\nfor their worship, and, finally, he gave up a large apartment on the\r\nlower floor of his own house, which was properly arranged with a pulpit\r\nand seats for religious meetings. M. Fontaine writes at the time: 'I was\r\nnow at the height of my ambition; I was beloved by my hearers, to whom I\r\npreached gratuitously. Great numbers of zealous, pious, and upright\r\npersons had joined our communion. This state of things was altogether\r\ntoo good to last. My cup of happiness was now full to overflowing, and,\r\nlike all the enjoyments of this world, it proved very transitory.'\r\nDissensions grew up; M. Fontaine was a Presbyterian, and some of his\r\nhearers required him to receive Episcopal ordination, and this\r\ncircumstance produced discussion, until he felt it his duty to resign\r\nhis charge. In answer to his request, his elders gave a reluctant and\r\nsorrowful consent, thanking him most humbly for the service he had\r\nrendered to this church, during two years and a half, without receiving\r\nany stipend or equivalent whatsoever for his unceasing exertions. '...\r\nWe have been extremely edified by his preaching, which has always been\r\nin strict accordance with the pure Word of God. He has imparted\r\nconsolation to the sick and afflicted, and set a bright example to the\r\nflock of the most exemplary piety and good conduct.'\r\n\r\nOur French Refugee next removed to Bear Haven, and entered largely into\r\nthe fishing business; and now he became a justice of the peace, exerting\r\nhimself to break up the contraband traffic, which he found generally\r\ncarried on 'between the Irish robbers and the French privateers,' then\r\nswarming the Irish coast. From eight to ten of these desperate\r\ncharacters were sent to Cork for trial at every assize of Bear Haven.\r\nThey swore vengeance upon the upright magistrate; and in the year\r\n1704, a French privateer hove in sight--soon anchoring, he faced M.\r\nFontaine's house. The vessel mounted ten guns, with a crew of eighty\r\nseamen. The Huguenot mustered all his men, amounting to twenty, and,\r\nsending the Papists away, he supplied the Protestants with muskets. This\r\nreduced his force to seven men, besides himself, wife, and children, and\r\nfour or five of these were of but little use.\r\n\r\nFontaine posting himself in a tower over the door, the rest of the party\r\noccupied the different windows. The lieutenant now landed with twenty\r\nmen, and, approaching the dwelling, he took aim and fired at M.\r\nFontaine, but missed him. The Huguenot then discharged a blunderbuss,\r\nwith small leaden balls, one of which entered the neck of the\r\nprivateersman, and another his side, when his men carried him back\r\nwounded to the ship. This unexpected resistance from a minister made the\r\ncaptain furious, when he sent to the attack twenty more men, under\r\nanother commander, with two small cannons. 'I must acknowledge,' he\r\nsays, 'that being unaccustomed to this sort of music, I felt some little\r\ntremors of fear when the first cannon ball struck the house; but I\r\ninstantly humbled myself before my Maker, and having committed myself,\r\nboth soul and body, to His keeping, my courage revived, and I suffered\r\nno more from fear. I put my head out of the window to see what effect\r\nthe ball had produced on our stone wall, and when I perceived it had\r\nonly made a slight scratch, I cried out for joy, 'Courage, my dear\r\nchildren, their cannon balls have no more effect on our stone walls than\r\nif they were so many apples.'\r\n\r\nThe wife of M. Fontaine displayed the greatest self-possession and\r\nbravery on this trying occasion, carrying ammunition, acting as surgeon,\r\nand encouraging all by her words and actions. 'Courage, my children,'\r\nsaid she, 'we are in the hands of God, and it is not fear that will\r\ninsure our safety; on the contrary, God will bless our courage. If you\r\ncannot fire yourselves, you can load the muskets for your father and\r\nothers who are older and stronger than you are; drive away all fear, if\r\nyou can, and leave the care of your persons to God.' The fight continued\r\nfrom eight in the morning until four in the afternoon, without\r\nintermission. Only two of the Huguenot family were wounded--a man, and\r\none of the children slightly in his finger. The pirates finally\r\nwithdrew, with three men killed and seven wounded. During the whole\r\naction the Huguenot minister did not permit any one 'to taste a drop of\r\nwine or spirits, or strong beer.' A second attack was feared, but soon\r\nthe privateer weighed anchor and sailed away; when the pious family\r\nreturned thanks to God for their 'glorious deliverance.'\r\n\r\nA full account of this bold and courageous affair was transmitted to\r\nLord Cox, then chancellor of Ireland, and the Duke of Ormond, the lord\r\nlieutenant. Fontaine recommended to them that a fort should be built\r\nthere, when 'it would be a great place for the settlement of French\r\nRefugees, and would also prove a safeguard to the commerce of the whole\r\nkingdom.' In the year 1704, he himself erected a fortification at the\r\nback of his house, purchased some six-pounders, which had been obtained\r\nfrom a vessel lost on the Irish coast, and the Government supplied him\r\nwith powder and balls. The Council of Dublin also voted him £50, and\r\nQueen Anne, in 1705, granted him a pension of five shillings a day for\r\nhis services, and as a French Refugee.\r\n\r\nFrom this daring defence, the name of M. Fontaine and wife became known\r\nand famous throughout all Europe. The French corsairs especially\r\nremembered it, and threatened another attack. Indeed, the family\r\nconstantly apprehended such a visit, and it did take place in 1704.\r\nLeaving their vessels at midnight, the enemy soon reached the dwelling\r\nof the Huguenot, and, firing the outbuildings and stacks of grain, in\r\nless than half an hour the whole were completely enveloped in flames. On\r\nthis occasion, the entire garrison consisted of the two parents,\r\nchildren, with four servants, two of whom were cowboys. By two o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, the pirates had made a breach through the wall of the\r\nhouse; but the children, protected by a mattress, in front of the\r\nopening, fired one after another at the assailants as they possibly\r\ncould. The Huguenot leader, having overcharged his musket, it burst,\r\nthrowing him down, and broke three of his ribs and right collar bone.\r\nFor a short time he was insensible, but remarks: 'I had already done my\r\npart, for, during the course of the morning, I had fired five pounds of\r\nswan shot from my now disabled piece. Notwithstanding this unfortunate\r\naccident, an incessant fire was kept up on both sides, until a parley\r\ntook place. Life and liberty were then guaranteed to the family, as the\r\nterms of capitulation, while the pirates were to have the plunder; and\r\nthey swore to these conditions as Frenchmen and men of honor. When the\r\nofficer and men entered the dwelling, and, looking anxiously around, saw\r\nonly five youths, and four cowherds, they suspected that an ambush had\r\nbeen laid for them.\r\n\r\n'You need not fear anything dishonorable from me,' said the French\r\npreacher; 'you see all our garrison.'\r\n\r\n'Impossible!' he replied; 'these children could not possibly have kept\r\nup all the firing.'\r\n\r\nThe house was then stripped of everything, not excepting the coats,\r\nwhich had been thrown off in the heat of the action; and the booty\r\nfilled six boats. When they departed, M. Fontaine with his two eldest\r\nboys and two servants were taken away as prisoners. In vain did the\r\nbrave good man protest that this was an infraction of the treaty. The\r\nremonstrance availed nothing with the freebooters. In a few days, the\r\nchildren with the servants were set ashore, but he was detained, when\r\norders were given to raise the anchor. During all these severe trials,\r\nhis noble and pious companion did not sit down, quietly lamenting her\r\nmisfortunes. She first went to the parish priest, who was under great\r\nobligations to her husband, entreating him for his liberation. But he\r\npositively refused. Perceiving the privateer under sail, she resolved to\r\nfollow it along the shore, as long as she could, and, reaching a\r\npromontory, she made a signal with her apron, on the top of a stick. A\r\nboat came near the shore, and she carried on a conversation with its\r\ncrew through a speaking trumpet. After much bargaining, they agreed to\r\nset M. Fontaine at liberty, upon the payment of £100 sterling. Of this\r\nsum the excellent lady could only borrow £30, and the captain of the\r\nprivateer consented to take this amount, with one of her sons as a\r\nhostage, until the remaining £70 were paid, calling her at the same time\r\n'a second Judith.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Fontaine repaired forthwith to Cork, for the purpose of raising the\r\nsum wanted, and could easily have obtained it, but the merchants of that\r\ncity objected to any payment of the kind. The privateer hovered about\r\nthe Irish coast for some time, expecting the ransom money; but when the\r\ngovernor of Brest heard the circumstances, he condemned the captain\r\nstrongly for bringing a hostage away with him, contrary to the law of\r\nnations. The difficulty did not terminate here. As soon as he was able,\r\nthe French preacher visited Kinsale, and made an affidavit of the\r\noutrage he had suffered. At this place were a government officer and a\r\nprison, and immediately all the French officers who had been taken in\r\nthe war then existing were ironed. Numbers of the same description were\r\ntreated in a similar manner. These retaliatory measures excited great\r\npublic feeling against the captain of the privateer, and he was summoned\r\nto appear before the governor of Brest, who imprisoned and even\r\nthreatened to hang him. Upon his promising to set at liberty the young\r\nhostage, and convey him to the place from whence he had been taken, the\r\nofficer was liberated.\r\n\r\nM. Fontaine now determined to live in Dublin, and support his family by\r\nteaching the Latin, Greek, and French languages; and in the mean time\r\nthe grand jury of Cork awarded him £800 for his losses at Bear Haven. In\r\nhis new abode he was able to give his children an excellent education;\r\none became an officer in the British service, and three entered college.\r\nThe former was John Fontaine, and the family determined that he should\r\nvisit America for information; and after travelling through\r\nMassachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland, he purchased a\r\nplantation in Virginia. Peter, another brother, received ordination from\r\nthe bishop of London, and with Moses, who studied law, both embarked for\r\nVirginia in 1716. Francis, the last son, remained at college.\r\n\r\nThere were two daughters in his family. The eldest, Mary Anne, married\r\nMatthew Maury, a Protestant Refugee from Gascony, in 1716, and the next\r\nyear he joined his relations in this country. His son was the Rev. James\r\nMaury, of Albemarle, Virginia, a very estimable and useful clergyman of\r\nthe Church of England. James was another son of the French preacher who\r\nmade America his home, bringing with him his wife, child, mother-in-law,\r\nand thirteen servants, in 1717. Francis, in 1719, was ordained by the\r\nBishop of London, on the particular recommendation of the Archbishop of\r\nDublin, and then also sailed for Virginia. He became a very eloquent and\r\npopular preacher, and settled in St. Margaret's parish, King William\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1721, Mr. Fontaine lost his most faithful, exemplary, and\r\npious companion. 'A melancholy day,' he records in his autobiography,\r\n'it was, that deprived me of my greatest earthly comfort and\r\nconsolation. I was bowed down to the very dust; but it made me think of\r\nmy own latter end, and made preparations to join her once more.' At the\r\nconclusion of his memoirs, he uses the following remarkable language:\r\n\r\n     'I feel the strongest conviction, that if you will take care of\r\n     these memoirs, your descendants will read them with pleasure; and I\r\n     here declare that I have been most particular as to the truth of\r\n     all that is herein recorded.\r\n\r\n     'I hope God will bless the work, and that by His grace it may be a\r\n     bond of union among you and your descendants, and that it may be an\r\n     humble means of confirming you all in the fear of the Lord.\r\n\r\n          I am, dear children,\r\n            'Your tender father,\r\n              'JAMES FONTAINE.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle did the faithful Huguenot preacher imagine that a century after\r\nhe wrote thus kindly to his own children, myriads who have been born\r\nfrom the same noble and holy ancestry would be animated, cheered, and\r\nprofited by his useful life and example. Though dead he yet speaketh.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt thus at length upon the heroic history of this Huguenot\r\nminister and his family; for where can we find an example so worthy of\r\nimitation? He was a Huguenot in its fullest sense, bearing himself, at\r\nall times, with a noble spirit of the true man, for the work before him.\r\nNever losing trust in God, nor proper confidence in himself, he proved\r\nthat, when thus true, no man need ever despair. His long line of\r\ndescendants in the United States may well cherish and honor his memory.\r\n\r\nAs we have said before, we dwell more particularly upon the character\r\nand history of Mr. Fontaine, as a striking example of a true Huguenot;\r\nand how truth and the right will finally triumph over all obstacles.\r\nWherever the French Protestants settled in America, they exhibited this\r\nsame excellent trait; and among their families of Virginia were those\r\nwho distinguished themselves as brave soldiers and able magistrates in\r\nthe councils of the then young Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO-MORROW!\r\n\r\n[G. H. BOKER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n   'The sun is sinking low,\r\n   Upon the ashes of his fading pyre;\r\n   The evening star is stealing after him,\r\n   Fixed, like a beacon on the prow of night;\r\n   The world is shutting up its heavy eye\r\n   Upon the stir and bustle of _to-day_;--\r\n   _On what shall it awake?_'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTGOMERY IN SECESSION TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1860, there existed in the city of\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, a strong, active, and apparently indestructible\r\nUnion party. Three months after the close of the year there remained in\r\nthe city no trace of Union sentiment. To show how this feeling was\r\ndestroyed, sinking slowly, and with many reactions, under influences in\r\nthemselves insignificant, and to narrate, as they fell under personal\r\nobservation, that short train of events which make up the historic\r\nperiod of this first capital of the Southern confederacy, will be the\r\nobject of the present sketch.\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer of 1860 it became evident to every dispassionate\r\nobserver in the South that the country was swiftly approaching a great\r\ncrisis. So dexterously had politicians managed the excitement which\r\narose on the discovery of the plot of John Brown, that at the very\r\nbeginning of the year a small and united party had been formed, having\r\nfor its aim the immediate separation of the States. This party,\r\nfollowing this well-defined object, was the only fixed thing in Southern\r\nsociety during the year. In the midst of all changes it was permanent.\r\nEven before the presidential election, when men's minds wavered about\r\nthings so permanent as party lines and party creeds, about old political\r\ndogmas associated with favorite political leaders, it remained\r\nunaffected. The presence of this restless and determined insurrectionary\r\nelement in the party politics of the time gave to the struggle preceding\r\nthe presidential election a character of unusual intensity. The city of\r\nMontgomery, as the home of Mr. Yancey, and consequently of his warmest\r\nadmirers, and most bitter opponents, felt the full influence of this\r\nexcitement, and soon became one of the natural centres of the growing\r\nstruggle of opinions.\r\n\r\nFrom causes difficult then to trace, there appeared early in the year in\r\nthe money market of the South an unusual condition of prostration. Banks\r\nwere unaccountably cautious. Money was scarce. Debts of more than a\r\nyear's standing were unpaid, and business of all kinds languished. Not\r\neven were the customary advances made by the banks in the East for the\r\npurchase of cotton, nor did the money scattered through the country by\r\nthose sales which did take place relieve the financial pressure under\r\nwhich everything labored. In October capitalists refused to venture\r\ntheir funds on anything which did not promise the most immediate return.\r\n\r\nIn these signs, in the inexplicable shrinking of capital to its hiding\r\nplaces, and in the universal darkening of business, it would seem that\r\nall might have discovered the approach of that storm which has since\r\nburst with such fury upon the land. But this was not the case. Although\r\nevery one looked forward with anxiety to the time of election, it was\r\nonly a portion of the so-called BRECKINRIDGE party who saw with any\r\ndistinctness the point toward which all things were tending. Nor did\r\nthese men make public the extent of their hopes.\r\n\r\nThey were satisfied at first to do nothing more than familiarize the\r\nminds of the people with the idea of secession. They spread the doctrine\r\nthat the only hope of Union lay in the defeat of Mr. Lincoln. Expressing\r\nthe worst fears of all, this doctrine was thought to be peculiarly\r\ncalculated to increase the numbers of the Union or Bell party, and was\r\ntherefore readily adopted by those who would at first have repelled with\r\npatriotic horror the alternative it suggested.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to estimate the influence of this lurking fallacy. Not\r\nmerely were multitudes of well-meaning, but unreasoning men, who were\r\nconfident of the success of their party, brought to acquiesce in a\r\nproposition utterly false in its base, but the whole conservative\r\nelement in society was placed in a position from which it would be\r\nthrown by defeat into a most dangerous reaction. Thus consciously or\r\nunconsciously all parties were using every effort in their power to\r\nprepare the popular mind for the question of secession.\r\n\r\nBut the period was not without its traits of patriotism. In October\r\nstrong efforts were made in the States of Alabama and Georgia to unite\r\nthe three parties in the South on one of the three candidates; thus\r\nsecuring a President to the South, and the certainty of the Union. The\r\nBreckinridge Democrats, however, contemptuously refused to be party to\r\nevery arrangement of the kind. The insurrectionary element, gathering to\r\nitself the excitable and disaffected spirits of every class, had now\r\ngained the command of this party, and no longer attempted to conceal its\r\nrevolutionary intentions. At the head of this element, exercising a vast\r\ninfluence over all its movements, and embodying in himself, more than\r\nany other man (except, perhaps, Mr. Yancey), the fierceness of its\r\nspirit, stood Mr. Toombs, of Georgia. He was now invited to speak in\r\nMontgomery. As a man of large political experience, some statesmanship,\r\nand master of a grave and sonorous eloquence, it was expected that he\r\nwould influence a class of men who had hitherto held themselves\r\nstudiously aloof from the insurrectionary ranks--that calm, conservative\r\nclass, which is recognized by all as the basis of every society which\r\nhas acquired, or having acquired, hopes to retain, stability of\r\ngovernment and security of morals. The sentiments of the speaker were\r\ntoo well known to admit of any doubts as to the probable character of\r\nhis address. He appeared as the undisguised advocate of secession. No\r\nform of appeal or argument was neglected which could have had weight\r\nwith a people peculiarly susceptible to the influence of oratory.\r\nSetting aside the question of the approaching election, to which he\r\nscarcely alluded, the orator strove only to show that it was an\r\nimperative social necessity that the South should have a vast and\r\nconstantly increasing slave territory; that in the path of this\r\nnecessity the only obstacle was the Federal Union, and that the time for\r\nits destruction had now come. These were the representative arguments of\r\nhis party before the election, and he did not speak to an unsympathizing\r\naudience. For when toward the close, raising his voice until it broke\r\nalmost in a scream, he exclaimed, 'Let the night which decides the\r\nelection of Mr. Lincoln be ushered in by the booming of the hostile\r\ncannon of the South,' the hall rang again and again with the shouts of\r\nhis excited hearers. But _nemo repente turpissimus semper fuit_. These\r\nwere not the sentiments of all. There was a large class present who did\r\nnot applaud--but neither did they hiss. They seemed for the time\r\noverawed by the energy of the spirit which had suddenly sprung up among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the following week, however, a singular, though, unfortunately, but\r\nmomentary check was given to the progress of insurrectionary sentiments\r\nin the vicinity of the city. Senator DOUGLAS, who had been slowly\r\nadvancing, in his oratorical tour, down the coast, was about this time\r\nannounced to speak in Montgomery. Since his speech in Norfolk, where he\r\nwas thought to have expressed himself too clearly against secession, a\r\nstrong prejudice had grown up in the South against him, and it now\r\nthreatened to manifest itself in acts of positive violence. Such was the\r\nstate of popular feeling, that for a time it seemed uncertain whether it\r\nwould be desirable for him to attempt to speak. Hints of peculiar\r\npersonal outrages were thrown out by men of a certain class; and\r\nthreats were made of something still more ominous in case he should\r\nattempt to repeat the sentiments of his Norfolk speech.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in the evening, and was met at the cars by a large crowd, and\r\na procession formed from a coalition, for the occasion, of his party\r\nwith that of Mr. Bell. It was feared that the short ride to the hotel\r\nwould not be accomplished without some act of violence on the part of\r\nthe excited throng by which his carriage was surrounded. A few eggs were\r\nthrown, but otherwise the ride was performed without interruption. From\r\nfurther outrages the crowd restrained itself until something positive\r\nshould appear on the part of the orator himself. Unintimidated, however,\r\nby these unmistakable evidences of the public feeling, Mr. Douglas on\r\nthe following morning presented himself on the steps in front of the\r\ncapitol, where it had been announced that his speech would be delivered.\r\nThe city was filled with strangers, who had come from all parts of the\r\ncountry to be present at the State fair which was held there that week.\r\nOn Capitol Hill, therefore, an immense throng was early assembled, which\r\ncoldly awaited the arrival of the orator. Everything was chilly and\r\nunfavorable. But the spirit of the obstinate debater seemed to rise with\r\nthe difficulties by which he was surrounded. At first even his manner of\r\nspeaking operated to his disadvantage. The sharp, syllabic emphasis,\r\nwhich he was accustomed to adopt in addressing large assemblages in the\r\nopen air, grated harshly on ears accustomed to the smooth and carefully\r\nmodulated elocution of Mr. Yancey. Beginning, however, by enunciating\r\ngeneral principles of government, in which all could agree, he gradually\r\nconciliated, by an unexpected appearance of moderation, the favorable\r\nattention of his audience. As he advanced upon his customary sketch of\r\nthe history of the different political parties during the past few\r\nyears--a work which a hundred repetitions enabled him to perform with a\r\ndramatic energy of style and expression singularly effective--he was\r\noccasionally interrupted by exclamations of acquiescence. As he\r\ndescribed the various successes of the Democratic party, these became\r\nfrequent, and before he had finished the _resumé_, his voice was drowned\r\namid the enthusiastic cheers of the crowd.\r\n\r\nIt was a triumph of oratory. He repeated every sentiment of his Norfolk\r\nspeech, and the men who in the morning had thrown out dark hints of\r\n'stoning,' joined in the applause. He accepted as a certainty the\r\nelection of Mr. Lincoln, but caused the crowd to shout with exultation\r\nat the prospect of tying all his activity by the constitutional check of\r\na Democratic majority in Congress. In short, he came amid general\r\nexecration, and departed amid universal regret. I had heard Mr. Douglas\r\nbefore, but never when he gave any evidence of the wonderful power which\r\nhe exhibited on this occasion. With few tricks of rhetoric, with no\r\nextraordinary bursts of eloquence, he accomplished all the results of\r\nthe most impassioned oratory. The qualities of a great debater--unshaken\r\npresence of mind, tact in adapting himself to his audience, the power of\r\narranging facts in a form at once simple and coherent, and yet most\r\nfavorable to his own cause, the strange influence by which one mind\r\ncompels from others the recognition of its supremacy--have long been\r\nconceded to the late Senator from Illinois, but never did he exhibit\r\nthese qualities with greater effect than before the excited populace of\r\nMontgomery.\r\n\r\nThis was the last strictly Union speech which was delivered in that\r\ncity. No one after this was found bold enough to stand up in the defence\r\nof the cause that from this day began slowly to succumb to the fierce\r\nspirit to which it was opposed. For several days the effects of the\r\nspeech were visible in the moderate tone of 'popular feeling;' but they\r\nwere soon lost in the tumultuous excitement attending the return of Mr.\r\nYancey from his tour in the North, and the still more intense feeling\r\nproduced by the election which immediately followed.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible in these last hours of distinct political\r\norganizations not to be struck with the differences that characterized\r\nthe opposing parties--differences which, both before and since, have had\r\nmuch to do with the progress of the rebellion. The Union gatherings were\r\neasy, jovial, fond of speeches adorned with the quips and turns of\r\npolitical oratory, and filled with the spirit 't'will all come right in\r\nthe end.' In the Breckinridge--or, as they had now practically\r\nbecome--the secession meetings, a different spirit prevailed. It was the\r\nspirit of insurrection, fierce, stormy, unrestrained. It was the spirit\r\nof hatred; hatred of the North, hatred of the Union, hatred of Mr. Bell,\r\nwhose success would deprive them of their only weapon for the\r\ndestruction of that Union.\r\n\r\nBut with the 4th of November came a change. Three days after election\r\nthere remained in Montgomery no trace of party organizations. All the\r\nwidely divergent streams of public opinion seemed suddenly to have\r\njoined in one, and that running fiercely, and unrestrained toward\r\ndisunion. The election of Mr. Lincoln united the people. On all sides\r\nprevailed the deepest enthusiasm in favor of secession. Mass meetings,\r\nattended by all parties, were held, and passed resolutions advocating in\r\nthe strongest terms immediate disunion. Secessionists were astonished at\r\nthe change, and in their anxiety to avoid anything which might shock the\r\nnewly awakened sentiment, appeared in many cases the most conservative\r\nmembers of the community. But indeed nothing was too violent for the\r\nstate of public feeling. War committees were appointed, and active\r\nmeasures taken to put the State in a position to maintain her\r\nindependence as soon as the ordinance of secession should have received\r\nthe sanction of the convention. Troops were despatched to take\r\npossession of the arsenal, and agents were sent North to purchase\r\nadditions to the already large supply of arms in the State. Immediate\r\nsecession seemed to be the desire of every class. But this condition of\r\nthings was not always to continue. The reaction which had carried the\r\nUnionists from a state of perfect confidence in the success of their\r\ncandidate, to one of deep disappointment, and of rage at the section to\r\nwhich they attributed their defeat, having at length spent itself, signs\r\nof a returning movement began to make their appearance. At first these\r\nwere not strongly marked. All were yet in favor of secession, but a\r\nlarge party, composed of most of the former partisans of Mr. Bell,\r\ntogether with the conservative element of every class, began at length\r\nto object to a too great precipitancy, and finally to demand that the\r\naction of Alabama should be made to depend upon the decision of the\r\nother Southern States. This movement was understood by the secessionists\r\nto have for its ultimate object the defeat of their hopes of disunion;\r\nand such, unquestionably, was its aim; for whatever may have been the\r\nplans of some of the leaders of the Coöperationists, as this party was\r\ncalled, it is certain that the great body of the party had no other end\r\nin view, and was sustained in its action by no other hope than the\r\nperpetuation of the Union.\r\n\r\nAt the caucus meetings which preceded the election of delegates to the\r\nState convention the two parties, as now formed, first came into\r\nconflict. At once important differences became apparent. Although nearly\r\nequal in numbers, in spirit the two parties were signally unequal. While\r\nthe secessionists were bold, vigilant, and uncompromising, the\r\nCoöperationists were timid and passionless, though full of a passive\r\nconfidence that the Union would in some way be preserved. A knowledge\r\nof this difference explains many things, in themselves apparently\r\ninexplicable. It shows how it was possible that a State so confessedly\r\nloyal that it would have rejected the ordinance of secession if it had\r\nbeen submitted directly to the people, could yet, on this very issue,\r\nelect a convention with a majority in favor of disunion. The whole\r\nquestion was decided in the caucus meetings. The secessionists of all\r\nparts of the State were bound together by watchful associations, and\r\nwere everywhere on the alert. In counties where by their number they\r\nwere entitled to no representative, attending the caucus meeting in\r\nforce, they effected--as they easily could while there was no distinct\r\nparty organization--a union of the tickets, and thus secured to\r\nthemselves one of the two candidates. So frequently was this repeated in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, that it was afterward estimated that by\r\nthis simple expedient of a union ticket the whole question of the\r\nsecession of this State was decided.\r\n\r\nFrom these political struggles, however, the interest of the community\r\nwas suddenly withdrawn by an event which instantly absorbed all\r\nattention, and struck terror into every household. In the little town of\r\nPine Level, a village situated a few miles from Montgomery, traces were\r\ndiscovered of a plot having for its object a general uprising of the\r\nnegroes on the evening preceding Christmas.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of the investigations which were immediately begun, it\r\ncame to light that the plot was not simply local, but extended over many\r\ncounties, including in its circuit the city of Montgomery, and involving\r\nin its movements many hundred negroes. Further examination revealed all\r\nthe horrible details which were to attend the consummation of the\r\nplot--the butchery of the whites, the allotment of females, the division\r\nof property. The whole surrounding country was alive with excitement.\r\nActive measures were taken to crush at once the spirit of insurrection.\r\nThe ringleaders and some of the poor whites, with whom the plot is said\r\nto have originated, were seized and, after a brief trial, immediately\r\nhung. In Montgomery feeling was such as to demand the adoption of the\r\nmost stringent precautionary measures. Military companies were called\r\nout and placed in nightly guard over the capitol and arsenal. On\r\nChristmas eve the plot was to go into execution, and as the time\r\napproached, the anxiety became painfully intense. It was whispered that\r\none of Mr. Yancey's slaves had been detected in an attempt to poison her\r\nmaster. The police was doubled, soldiers with loaded muskets were\r\nstationed in all the prominent streets, while mounted guards ranged the\r\nthinly inhabited section of the outskirts. The night, however, passed\r\nwithout alarm, and the excitement from that time slowly subsided.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely worthy of notice, perhaps, that with the returning sense\r\nof security came also the flippant confidence which had been for a time\r\nput to flight. The blacks were again a timid and affectionate race, and\r\nit was soon not difficult to find multitudes who declared themselves\r\nwilling to meet alone a hundred insurrectionary slaves. Sitting in this\r\nevening calm, listening to such remarks, it was difficult to accept as\r\nreal the events of the hot and excited day which had gone before. Surely\r\nthey were dreams--the hurried trials, the hangings, the nightly tread of\r\nsoldiers, the brooding terror that whitened the lips of mothers. A home\r\nguard, however, was immediately formed, including all citizens,\r\nirrespective of age or station, capable of bearing arms, and not in\r\nother military organizations.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January, the convention met. South Carolina had already\r\npassed her ordinance of secession; but what others would follow the\r\nexample of this excitable State was yet uncertain. All eyes were now\r\nanxiously directed toward Alabama, upon whose decision would to a great\r\ndegree depend that of the two great conservative States, Louisiana and\r\nGeorgia. Nor was this anxiety diminished by the accounts given of the\r\ncomposition of the convention of this State. Both sides claimed a\r\nmajority; and it was evident that, without some unexpected defection,\r\nthe two parties would narrowly escape a tie. This singular uncertainty\r\nwas soon, however, to cease. Immediately on convening, it became evident\r\nthat the command of the body lay with the secessionists. It was found by\r\nsecret estimates that the two parties were divided by ten votes. Of the\r\nhundred delegates, fifty-five were in favor of disunion. Although this\r\nmajority gave the secessionists power to carry their wishes into instant\r\neffect, it was not thought politic to do so while the difference between\r\nthe two parties remained so small. The passage of the ordinance was,\r\ntherefore, for several days delayed, while the Coöperationists were\r\nplied with arguments to induce them to acquiesce in that which it was\r\nnow impossible for them to prevent. At length, after four days of\r\ndeliberation, it became evident that all of this party had succumbed\r\nwhom it seemed possible to change, and on the morning of the 11th of\r\nJanuary it was publicly announced that the ordinance of secession had\r\npassed the convention by a vote of sixty-one in the affirmative against\r\nthirty-nine in the negative.\r\n\r\nBy the insurrectionists the announcement was received with transports of\r\njoy, but by the Unionists it was met with demonstrations of grief, which\r\nthey made no efforts to conceal. Women wept, and houses were closed as\r\nfor a day of mourning. In the northern part of the State the\r\nmanifestations of disappointment were still more unmistakable.\r\nIndignation meetings were held, and one of the delegates received a\r\ntelegram from his constituents, charging him with having betrayed them\r\non the very issue for which he was elected, and demanding explanations.\r\nAt length the loyal feeling of the State seemed aroused, and had the\r\nordinance of secession been now submitted to the people, all admitted\r\nthat it would have been rejected by an unquestionable majority. But the\r\nordinance was not submitted to the people, and the Union sentiment,\r\nwhich had already, within the interval of a few weeks, passed through\r\ntwo complete oscillations--vibrating from the loyalty which preceded the\r\npresidental election through all the changes of the strong disunion\r\nreaction which followed--was now again in the ascendant. But from this\r\npoint it soon began to recede, descending slowly along an arc of which\r\nno eye can see the end, with a momentum that permits no prediction as to\r\nthe time of its return.\r\n\r\nA multitude of influences began at once to weaken the energy of the\r\nUnion sentiment. From the first, it had been the policy of the disunion\r\nleaders to represent the question of secession as lying wholly with the\r\nSouth. In case this section should decide upon disunion, there would be\r\nlittle reason, it was said, to fear any prolonged opposition on the part\r\nof the North--least of all a war. Nothing appeared on the part of the\r\nFederal Executive to refute these assertions. It was by a large class\r\nbelieved, therefore, that the leaders were right when they said that the\r\nsecession would be a mere withdrawal of the Southern States, for the\r\nformation of a government perfectly friendly to the North, with which,\r\nindeed, a board of commissioners would soon arrange the terms of a\r\npeaceful international trade. After the passage of this ordinance,\r\nhowever, a slight modification of this argument became necessary. Peace\r\nwas conditioned upon unanimity. Unionists were now called upon to render\r\ntheir support to the new government in order to secure peace. If it was\r\nclear that the State was united in favor of the changed condition of\r\nthings, there would be no difficulty, it was said, to procure, amid the\r\ndivisions of the North, a peaceful recognition of the confederacy. The\r\nfactions of the Northern States would never allow the Federal Government\r\nto attempt to coerce a united people. Thus the very weapons which\r\nloyalty had used to arm herself were here wrested to her own\r\ndestruction. To insure peace, men became insurrectionists.\r\n\r\nIt is useless now to surmise what would have been the result if the\r\naction of the Federal Government in reference to the question of\r\nsecession at the beginning of the rebellion, had been less ambiguous. It\r\nis enough to know, what was for many weeks so painfully realized by\r\nevery Northerner in the South, that had the Southern people, by any\r\nmeans, been brought to understand that Federal laws were protected by\r\nsanctions, and that an attempt at disunion would certainly be followed\r\nby war, the question of secession would never have become a formidable\r\nissue. But while men believed, as many of the Unionists did, that\r\nsecession was an experiment, attended with no danger to themselves, and\r\nwhich would more than likely result, after a few years, in a peaceful\r\nreconstruction of the Union on terms more favorable to the South, there\r\nis little occasion for wonder that the cause of disunion met with no\r\nvery earnest, or, at least, prolonged opposition.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the ordinance of secession gave to the disunionists an\r\nincalculable advantage. It is true, the Union feeling was deep, and in\r\nmany places strongly aroused, but the State had seceded, the new\r\ngovernment was quietly and apparently solidly forming itself, profitable\r\noffices were in its gift, and, added to all, the conservative spirit\r\nwhispered its old motto, _quieta non movere_, and the hands which had\r\nbeen raised in weak resistance fell harmlessly back.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, at the capitol, another work was going on. The\r\nconvention, having established by ordinance the independence of the\r\nState, was now engaged in tearing down and remodelling to meet the petty\r\nwants of the Republic of Alabama the august structure of the Federal\r\nConstitution. The work was soon completed, and on the 29th of January\r\nthis body, which in a brief session of three weeks had carried through\r\nmeasures involving some of the most stupendous changes possible to a\r\ncivil State, adjourned to meet again on the 4th of March, cutting off,\r\nby this, all possibility of any of the questions which it had discussed\r\nbeing brought before the people by a new election. On the week following\r\nthe adjournment of the convention, the confederate congress assembled in\r\nMontgomery.\r\n\r\nThis body immediately showed a fine appreciation of the state of public\r\nfeeling, and drew to itself the confidence of the people by selecting\r\nfor president and vice-president of the temporary government men who\r\nwere thought to represent the more conservative element in community.\r\nMr. Davis, at the time of his election, was in Mississippi, but on\r\nreceiving the official announcement of the event, started at once for\r\nMontgomery, passing through Southern Tennessee, then a loyal State,\r\nalong a path nearly parallel to the one in which Mr. Lincoln was at the\r\nsame time moving a little farther north.\r\n\r\nHe reached the city in the night, but a large crowd was awaiting his\r\narrival at the depot. A procession of carriages, filled with members of\r\nthe confederate congress, led the way to the hotel. It was preceded by a\r\nmilitary band, and at regular intervals rockets were discharged,\r\nannouncing to the distant beholder the progress of the procession. All\r\nfelt that by attention to these honorary details they were assisting to\r\ngive dignity to the newly formed confederacy. On arriving at the hotel,\r\nMr. Davis was announced to speak from the balcony. The crowd pressed\r\ncuriously forward. Two candles threw a faint, yellow light over a\r\nspare, angular form, rather below the medium height, lighting up, at the\r\nsame time, the sunken cheeks and strongly marked jaws of a face now\r\nworking with the emotions which the unusual events of the evening were\r\nso well calculated to excite.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies of inauguration were postponed to the beginning of the\r\nfollowing week. Early on Monday morning, however, the hill before the\r\ncapitol was covered with a vast throng, collected from all parts of the\r\nnew confederacy. For the accomodation of the members of congress, a\r\ntemporary platform had been erected in front of the capitol. Standing on\r\nthis, and glancing over the city, the eye rested on the rich valley of\r\nthe Alabama, stretching away many miles to the north, broken here and\r\nthere by the dark green foliage of the pine forests, which now twinkled\r\nin the soft light of a day mild even for the latitude. At the extreme\r\nrear of the platform, behind a small table, was seated the chairman of\r\nthe congress, Howell Cobb. Corpulent even to grossness, he formed a\r\ncurious contrast to the small and wasted forms of the two presidents\r\nelect, who sat at his side. The events of this day have given to every\r\ntrait of these men a lasting and unenviable interest. Neither looked\r\nlike a great man, neither like a man thoroughly bad. All the impressions\r\nproduced by the first appearance of Mr. Davis were strengthened, without\r\nbeing changed, by a farther acquaintance. To a physique by no means\r\nimposing, he joins a manner too reserved to make him at any time a\r\nfavorite of the populace. His whole bearing, in fact, declares him a\r\nstranger to that deep and contagious enthusiasm which has so often in\r\nenterprises like this drawn to a leader the admiration and unconquerable\r\nfidelity of the common people. Nor, on the other hand, is there anything\r\nin his appearance to indicate the presence of the broad and\r\ncomprehensive energy which, in the mind of the thoughtful, can take the\r\nplace of such an enthusiasm. Still, he is in many respects peculiarly\r\nsuited to take the head of the rebellion. Elected at a time when State\r\ndistinctions were lost sight of in the warmth of the first formation of\r\nthe confederacy, he soon lost his sectional character, and represents,\r\nas no one now elected could, the people alike of Virginia and those\r\nalong the Gulf. He is shrewd, cautious, determined. But his caution may\r\neasily become scarcely distinguishable in its results from timidity. His\r\ndetermination is never far removed from stubbornness. Mr. Stevens, who\r\nsat, or, rather, had sunk, in his chair by the side of Mr. Davis, was a\r\nthin, sickly looking man, whose small round face was characterized by\r\nthe pallid self-concentrated expression peculiar to invalids. On rising\r\nat the administration of the oath, which he did with the laborious\r\nmovement of one to whom weakness had become a habit, he revealed a form\r\nof about the medium height, but broken, as by some physical\r\ndisfigurement. During most of the ceremonies, he wore the air of an\r\nuninterested spectator, amusing himself with the head of a slight and\r\nrather jaunty cane, which he held between his knees. Although greatly\r\ninferior, so far as mere physical appearances are concerned, to his\r\ncolleague, there is yet something in the expression and bearing of Mr.\r\nStevens which suggests a depth and comprehensiveness of intellect for\r\nwhich one searches in vain the face of Mr. Davis. On the platform were\r\ngathered nearly all those restless spirits which have, during the past\r\ntwenty years, disturbed the peace of the country. Conspicuous among them\r\nappeared the bristling head of Mr. Toombs. He sat during the whole\r\nceremony, with his face, wearing the imperious expression which had\r\nbecome habitual to it, turned upon the people. With uncovered heads, and\r\nin perfect silence, the crowd listened to the oath of office.\r\nImmediately on the completion of this ceremony the two presidents and\r\nthe congress withdrew to the senate chamber.\r\n\r\nA levee was announced for the evening. The hall which had been selected\r\nfor this gathering was a large, low room in the upper story of a\r\nbuilding near the centre of the city.\r\n\r\nSome efforts had been made by the ladies to conceal the rudeness of the\r\napartment, but it was expected that every deficiency of this kind would\r\nbe forgotten in the presence of that courtly society which had hitherto\r\ngiven all the attractiveness to occasions like this on the banks of the\r\nPotomac. It is but fair to suppose that these expectations were\r\ndisappointed, for early in the evening the hall was crowded with a\r\nthrong of men and boys, who, standing with uncovered heads, talking\r\nloudly of the hopes of the new confederacy, or moved uneasily about,\r\nseeking a favorable position from which to watch the 'president shake\r\nhands.' This was the ambition of the evening. Every standing point in\r\nthe vicinity of Mr. Davis was taken advantage of. Chairs and benches\r\nserved as footstools to elevate into positions of prominence long rows\r\nof men dressed in the yellow jeans of the country, who stood, during all\r\nthe long hours of the evening, watching with unchanging countenances the\r\nmultiplied repetitions of the short double shake and spasmodic smile\r\nwhich Mr. Davis meted out to each of the constantly forming column that\r\nfiled before him. The platform was filled with the same class, and even\r\nthe arch of evergreen, under which it was intended that Mr. Davis should\r\nstand, was pushed aside, to give place to those unwinking faces which\r\npressed to every loophole of observation. The ladies, who appeared here\r\nand there in the crowd, sparkling with jewels, and dressed in the rich\r\nrobes naturally suited to the occasion, only increased by their presence\r\nthe rude incongruities of the gathering. Men were surprised at the\r\nmanifestations on every hand of a vulgarity and coarseness which they\r\nhad been accustomed to think the natural products and exclusive\r\ncharacteristics of a state of society farther north. To the eyes of the\r\nfastidious, a new class had suddenly arisen in their midst. Perhaps the\r\nlesson was not a new one. Many nations before, when in the midst of\r\nrevolutions, have been called mournfully to learn that there are grades\r\nin every society, that rebellions are not always tractable, and that the\r\nclass which guides their opening rarely controls their close. But if the\r\nscene of the evening had any prophecies of this kind--and I do not say\r\nthat it had--it wailed them, like Cassandra, to ears divinely closed.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the ferment of public opinion disappeared. A tangible\r\ngovernment existed, against which to speak was treason, and the friends\r\nof the Union--and in spite of all changes, the number of these was yet\r\nconsiderable--now for the first time ceased from the expression of those\r\nobjections by which they had hitherto indicated the direction of their\r\nsympathies. All classes of men were longing for something permanent, and\r\neagerly grasped at these appearances of a settled government, as\r\npromising to supply that which they so much desired. The establishment\r\nof a calm and united state of public feeling seemed, therefore, the\r\nalmost instant effect of the inauguration of Mr. Davis. As might be\r\nexpected, the events which have been related had not taken place in the\r\nSouth without affecting the condition of the Northern stranger who\r\nchanced to be within the gate. To him every change had been for the\r\nworse. During the fluctuations of public opinion in the early part of\r\nthe season, his position, though unpleasant, had still some relieving\r\ncircumstances; the condition of the country was not yet utterly\r\nhopeless, and the vanity of being stable in the midst of universal\r\nchange, ministered a mild though secret pleasure, which, in the painful\r\nanxieties of the period, was not without its consolatory value. But when\r\nthe tide of public opinion had turned strongly in one direction, and\r\nthat in favor of secession, all those pleasures, so mild and spiritual,\r\nwere at once destroyed. Nor was this a condition without change. Every\r\nweek added some new restraints to those by which the Unionist was\r\nalready surrounded. But never was the pressure of these restraints felt\r\nto be so great as in this singular calm, which followed the inauguration\r\nof Mr. Davis. The loyal spirit seemed extinct. Union sentiments were no\r\nlonger expressed in even the private circles. Now, however, hints were\r\noccasionally dropped of the possibility of a future reconstruction, and\r\nin this direction it was evident the small remnant of the Union party\r\nwas now turning its hopes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the general appearance of unanimity, one thing remained\r\nwhich seemed to indicate a want of perfect confidence on the part of the\r\npeople generally in the permanency of the new order of affairs. This\r\nwas, the little interest which was manifested in the transactions of the\r\nrebel congress. With nothing else to occupy their minds, the people\r\nallowed the most important measures of public policy to pass almost\r\nwithout remark. To the congress itself this apathy did not extend. There\r\nappeared here, on the contrary, a germ even of the old State\r\nantagonisms; for when Mr. Toombs, carrying out the former policy of his\r\nState, introduced a bill imposing a tax on imports, declaring, at the\r\nsame time, that no government could ever be sustained without depending\r\nchiefly upon this source of revenue, every member from South Carolina\r\nwas on his legs. After a warm debate, and against the strongest protests\r\nof these members, the bill was carried and went into effect.\r\nNotwithstanding this, many in England still secretly believe that the\r\nFederal tariff was the real cause of the secession.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing promptness with which the rebel government, immediately\r\nafter the fall of Fort Sumter, equipped and placed upon the field an\r\nenormous and fairly organized army, has given rise to a strong\r\nimpression concerning the energy put forth by the executive department\r\nduring the two months which intervened between this event and the\r\ninauguration. No mistake could be greater. On the very day of the\r\nelection of Mr. Lincoln the South possessed a military establishment\r\nquite equal, in proportion to its population, to that of either France\r\nor Russia. At the time of the John Brown excitement, a rumor was spread\r\nthrough the South that large bodies of men were gathering in different\r\nparts of the North, having for their object an invasion of the Southern\r\nStates. Among all the reports which this excited period produced, none\r\nwas more sedulously diffused, and none more generally believed.\r\n\r\nWhatever had been the original design of the story, its instant effect,\r\nin the excited state of the public mind, was the formation of companies\r\nin every county and village throughout the South for military drill.\r\n\r\nThese organizations, of which there were frequently several in a single\r\nvillage, were equipped entirely at the expense of the individual\r\nmembers. As they were under constant drill during the winter and summer,\r\nthey presented at the opening of the year 1861 the singular spectacle of\r\na great army, organized and equipped at its own expense, ready at any\r\nmoment to march at the command of the recognized government. This, it is\r\nunnecessary to say, was the grand basis of that army which was afterward\r\nplaced upon the field; and thus it was that a secretary of war so\r\npalpably inefficient as Mr. Walker was able, with an empty treasury, for\r\nmany months to surpass the North in the supply of troops, equipped, and\r\nat once prepared for duty.\r\n\r\nIt was in full appreciation of this great armed mass that lay at his\r\nhand in a condition to be easily formed into an organized and efficient\r\narmy, that Mr. Davis, after much entreaty, and repeated postponement,\r\nreluctantly gave his assent to the first strong act of the executive\r\ndepartment, and ordered the attack upon Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nWithout anticipating what were to be the effects of this act in the\r\nNorth, which was, indeed, open to the conjecture of no man, Mr. Davis on\r\nthis occasion simply exhibited a hesitancy in venturing on extreme\r\nmeasures, which will be found to be a characteristic feature of his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nFor several days the city was filled with rumors concerning the\r\nanticipated attack, but early on Friday morning it was announced that\r\nthe bombardment had already begun. In the general excitement, business\r\nwas suspended. Crowds filled the streets. The war department was in\r\nconstant receipt of telegraphic messages announcing the progress of the\r\nbombardment. But nothing came during the day to diminish the growing\r\nanxiety. It was found that the fleet of war vessels said to be outside\r\nthe bar would take advantage of the night to come to the succor of the\r\nfort. Sleep was impossible. Men who had gone to bed arose again and\r\njoined the crowd which thronged the streets. At length, shortly after\r\nmidnight, Mr. Walker came forth and announced the last and most\r\nfavorable telegraphic report concerning the progress of the siege,\r\nuttering at the same time the famous boast which has linked his name\r\nwith an indissoluble association of folly. Shortly past noon on\r\nSaturday, the message came which announced the surrender of the fort.\r\nThe city was frantic with joy. For hours, no forms of manifestation\r\nseemed adequate to express the excitement which filled all classes of\r\nsociety. Standing on the housetop in the evening, a wild crowd could be\r\nseen flitting before bonfires, or ranging the streets, and shouting in\r\nthe ecstasy of an excitement which none could control. Immediately on\r\nthe arrival of the despatch, messengers had started into the country\r\nwith the welcome tidings, and deep in the night the ear was startled by\r\nthe dull roar of the cannon announcing the arrival in some distant\r\nvillage of the joyful intelligence.\r\n\r\n'That will be the end of the war,' said a man of well known\r\nconservatism, who stood by at the announcement in Montgomery of the\r\nsurrender of the fort. It was the last expression of that fatal fallacy\r\nwhich had lured so large a class quietly to acquiesce in the fact of\r\nsecession in the hope of thus securing the peaceful recognition of the\r\nNorth. In a few days more, the whole deception had passed away. But the\r\ncorrection had come too late. The Union party was extinct. Twice, in the\r\ncourse of that great change, by the progress of which, a people, in\r\nmajority loyal, was converted into one totally disloyal and\r\nrevolutionary, it lay within the power of the Federal Executive, by\r\nfirmness and a proper exhibition of its powers, to have sustained the\r\nUnion party in the South and crushed the rebellion--before the election\r\nof Mr. Lincoln, and at the time of the strong Union reaction in the\r\nelection of delegates to the State convention. At both these periods the\r\nUnion feeling was strong and increasing, immediately after each; pressed\r\nupon by arguments which the course of the Executive had failed to\r\nanswer, it slowly declined. But no great sentiment is destroyed at once.\r\nThere is reason to believe that, if left to itself, the tide of Union\r\nfeeling might again have flowed back, and the faint traces of a\r\nreconstruction party which appeared in the short interval of quiet that\r\nbelonged to the rebel confederacy indicates, perhaps, the path along\r\nwhich it would have returned. But the time for these things had passed.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Sumter brought the doctrines of secession into instant\r\npopularity, and roused a spirit of military enthusiasm in the South\r\nscarcely less intense than that which the same event excited in the\r\nNorth. At once, in every direction, disappeared all those sober scruples\r\nwhich, during the hottest excitement of the preceding months, had\r\nquietly controlled the judgment of a small but influential class in\r\nevery community. The change in north Alabama and central Tennessee,\r\nwhere the principles of secession had been steadily rejected by the\r\npeople, was almost instantaneous. The excitement and pride of a\r\nsectional victory, and a false sympathy for the individuals who had\r\nventured their lives in a cause in itself, perhaps, objectionable,\r\neffected what the most cunning fallacies of the leaders had been unable\r\nto accomplish. As this movement of the popular feeling had many points\r\nof resemblance with the revolution of feeling which took place just\r\nafter the election of Mr. Lincoln, there were some who believed that it\r\nwould be followed by a similar reaction. The excitement of the war into\r\nwhich the whole country was immediately precipitated, cut off, however,\r\nevery chance of any such retrogressive movement. No reaction took place.\r\nThe surrender of Fort Sumter completed the change of opinion which had\r\nbeen so long progressing in the South.\r\n\r\nThose who look for an immediate restitution of Union feeling in the\r\nSouth, as a result of Federal victories, will be disappointed. It will\r\nbe the result of a gradual movement--a movement resembling in every\r\nimportant particular that by which the secession sentiment was\r\nestablished in the interval between the election of Mr. Lincoln and the\r\nsurrender of Fort Sumter. Operating particularly upon that class in\r\nsociety which is by nature passive rather than active, conservative\r\nrather than headlong, the movement, as in that case, will be at first\r\nslow and attended with many reactions, but the result will not be\r\nuncertain. Already the progress of the war has destroyed nearly all the\r\nmotives by which the Union party of the South was formerly led to adopt\r\nthe cause of secession. This great party, therefore, stretching through\r\nall parts of the South, forming an important element in the population\r\nof every village and county which threatened at one time with its\r\npassive resistance to overturn the whole scheme of the rebellion, stands\r\nnow exposed to the full influence of the reactionary tide which has now\r\nbegun to set back toward the Union. The change may not be at once, but\r\nthe same motive which led the Union man of Tennessee to return to\r\nloyalty, will prove equally effective with his whole party, wherever\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAKSPEARE FOR 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n   'O England!--model to thy inward greatness,\r\n   Like little body with, a mighty heart,--\r\n   What might'st thou do, that honor would thee do,\r\n   Were all thy children kind and natural!\r\n   But see thy fault! the SOUTH in thee finds out\r\n   A nest of hollow bosoms, which it fills\r\n   With treacherous crowns! they would o'erthrow our country,\r\n   And by their hands the grace of Freedom die,\r\n   If hell and treason hold their promises.'\r\n\r\n        _Henry V_, Act II, Scene i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nILLINOIS AND MISSOURI COMPARED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy previous numbers, comparing the progress, in the aggregate, of all\r\nthe Slave States, with all the Free States, of Massachusetts and New\r\nJersey, with Maryland and South Carolina, and of New York with Virginia,\r\ndemonstrate the fatal effect of slavery upon material advance, and moral\r\nand intellectual development. In further proof of the uniformity of this\r\ngreat law, I now institute a similar comparison between two great\r\nneighboring Western States, Missouri and Illinois. The comparison is\r\njust, for while Missouri has increased since 1810, in wealth and\r\npopulation, much more rapidly than any of the Slave States, there are\r\nseveral Free States whose relative advance has exceeded that of\r\nIllinois. The rapid growth of Missouri is owing to her immense area, her\r\nfertile soil, her mighty rivers (the Mississippi and Missouri), her\r\ncentral and commanding position, and to the fact, that she has so small\r\na number of slaves to the square mile, as well as to the free\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe population of Illinois, in 1810, was 12,282, and in 1860, 1,711,951;\r\nthe ratio of increase from 1810 to 1860 being 13,838.70. (Table 1, Cens.\r\n1860.) The population of Missouri in 1810, was 20,845, and in 1860,\r\n1,182,012; the ratio of increase from 1810 to 1860 being 5,570.48. (Ib.)\r\nThe rank of Missouri in 1810 was 22, and of Illinois 23. The rank of\r\nMissouri in 1860 was 8, and of Illinois, 4.\r\n\r\nAREA.--The area of Missouri is 67,380 square miles, being the 4th in\r\nrank, as to area, of all the States. The area of Illinois is 55,405\r\nsquare miles, ranking the 10th. Missouri, then, has 11,975 more square\r\nmiles than Illinois. This excess is greater by 749 square miles than the\r\naggregate area of Massachusetts, Delaware, and Rhode Island, containing\r\nin 1860 a population of 1,517,902. The population of Missouri per square\r\nmile in 1810 exceeded that of Illinois .08; but, in 1860, the population\r\nof Missouri per square mile was 17.54, ranking the 22d, and that of\r\nIllinois, 30.90, ranking the 13th. Illinois, with her ratio to the\r\nsquare mile and the area of Missouri, would have had in 1860 a\r\npopulation of 2,082,042; and Missouri; with her ratio and the area of\r\nIllinois, would have had in 1860 a population of 971,803, making a\r\ndifference in favor of Illinois of 1,110,239 instead of 529,939. The\r\nabsolute increase of population of Illinois per square mile from 1850 to\r\n1860 was 15.54, and of Missouri 7.43, Illinois ranking the 6th in this\r\nratio and Missouri the 14th. These facts prove the vast advantages which\r\nMissouri possessed in her larger area as compared with Illinois.\r\n\r\nBut Missouri in 1810, we have seen, had nearly double the population of\r\nIllinois. Now, reversing their numbers in 1810, the ratio of increase of\r\neach remaining the same, the population of Illinois in 1860 would have\r\nbeen 2,005,014, and of Missouri, 696,983. If we bring the greater area\r\nof Missouri as an element into this calculation the population of\r\nIllinois in 1860 would have exceeded that of Missouri more than two\r\nmillions and a half.\r\n\r\nMINES.--By Census Tables 9, 10, 13 and 14, Missouri produced, in 1860,\r\npig iron of the value of $575,000; Illinois, none. Bar and rolled\r\niron--Missouri, $535,000; Illinois, none. Lead--Missouri, $356,660;\r\nIllinois, $72,953. Coal--Missouri, $8,200; Illinois, $964,-187.\r\nCopper--Missouri, $6,000; Illinois, none. As to mines, then, Missouri\r\nhas a decided advantage over Illinois. Indeed, the iron mountains of\r\nMissouri are unsurpassed in the world. That Illinois approaches so near\r\nto Missouri in mineral products, is owing to her railroads and canals,\r\nand not to equal natural advantages. The number of miles of railroad in\r\noperation in 1860 was, 2,868 in Illinois, and 817 in Missouri; of\r\ncanals, Illinois, 102 miles; Missouri, none. (Tables 38, 39.) But if\r\nMissouri had been a free State, she would have at least equalled\r\nIllinois in internal improvements, and the Pacific Railroad would have\r\nlong since united San Francisco, St. Louis, and Chicago.\r\n\r\nIllinois is increasing in a _progressive_ ratio, as compared with\r\nMissouri. Thus, from 1840 to 1850 the increase of numbers in Illinois\r\nwas 78.81, and from 1850 to 1860, 101.01 per cent., while the increase\r\nof Missouri from 1840 to 1850 was 77.75, and from 1850 to 1860, 73.30.\r\nThus, the ratio is augmenting in Illinois, and decreasing in Missouri.\r\nIf Illinois and Missouri should each increase from 1860 to 1870, in the\r\nsame ratio as from 1850 to 1860, Illinois would then number 3,441,448,\r\nand Missouri, 2,048,426. (Table 1.) In 1850, Chicago numbered 29,963,\r\nand in 1860, 109,260. St. Louis, 77,860 in 1850, and 160,773 in 1860.\r\n(Table 40.) From 1840 to 1850 the ratio of increase of Chicago was\r\n570.31, and from 1850 to 1860, 264.65, and of St. Louis, from 1840 to\r\n1850, 372.26 per cent., and from 1850 to 1860, 106.49. If both increased\r\nin their respective ratios from 1860 to 1870 as from 1850 to 1860,\r\nChicago would number 398,420 in 1870, and St. Louis, 331,879. It would\r\nbe difficult to say which city has the greatest natural advantages, and\r\nyet when St. Louis was a city, Chicago was but the site of a fort.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WEALTH.--By Census Table 36, the cash value of the farms of\r\nIllinois in 1860, was $432,531,072, and of Missouri, $230,632,126,\r\nmaking a difference in favor of Illinois, of $201,898,946, which is the\r\nloss which Missouri has sustained by slavery in the single item of the\r\nvalue of her farm lands. Abolish slavery there, and the value of the\r\nfarm lands of Missouri would soon equal those of Illinois, and augment\r\nthe wealth of the farmers of Missouri over two hundred millions of\r\ndollars. But these farm lands of Missouri embrace only 19,984,809 acres\r\n(Table 36), leaving unoccupied 23,138,391 acres. The difference between\r\nthe value of the unoccupied lands of Missouri and Illinois, is six\r\ndollars per acre, at which rate the increased value of the unoccupied\r\nlands of Missouri, in the absence of slavery, would be $138,830,346.\r\nThus, it appears, that the loss to Missouri in the value of her lands,\r\ncaused by slavery, is $340,729,292. If we add to this the diminished\r\nvalue of town and city property in Missouri, from the same cause, the\r\ntotal loss in that State in the value of real estate, exceeds\r\n$400,000,000, which is nearly twenty times the value of her slaves. By\r\nTable 35, the increase in the value of the real and personal property of\r\nIllinois from 1850 to 1860, was $715,595,276, being 457.93 per cent.,\r\nand of Missouri, $363,966,691, being 265.18 per cent. At the same rate\r\nof increase from 1860 to 1870, the total wealth of Illinois would then\r\nbe $3,993,000,000, and of Missouri, $1,329,000,000, making the\r\ndifference against Missouri, in 1870, caused by slavery, $2,664,000,000,\r\nwhich is much more than three times the whole debt of the nation, and\r\nmore than twice the value of all the slaves in the Union. While, then,\r\nthe $20,000,000 proposed to be appropriated to aid Missouri in\r\nemancipating her slaves, is erroneously denounced as increasing federal\r\ntaxation, the effect is directly the reverse. The disappearance of\r\nslavery from Missouri would ensure the overthrow of the rebellion, and\r\nthe perpetuity of the Union, and bring the war much sooner to a close,\r\nthus saving a monthly expenditure, far exceeding the whole\r\nappropriation. But this vast increase of the wealth of Missouri, caused\r\nby her becoming a free State, if far less than one billion of dollars,\r\nwould, by increasing her contribution to the national revenue, in\r\naugmented payments of duties and internal taxes, diminish to that extent\r\nthe rate of taxation to be paid by every State, Missouri included.\r\n\r\nThe total wealth of the Union in 1860 exceeded $16,000,000,000. If this\r\nwere increased $1,000,000,000 in time, by the augmented wealth of\r\nMissouri, and our revenue from duties and taxes should be $220,000,000,\r\nas estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury, the increased income,\r\nbeing one-seventeenth of the whole, would exceed $12,000,000 per annum;\r\nor, if the increase of wealth should be only $200,000,000, then the\r\naugmented proportional annual revenue would be $2,750,000, or nearly\r\none-eightieth part of the whole revenue, thus soon extinguishing the\r\nprincipal and interest of the debt of $20,000,000, and leaving a large\r\nsurplus to decrease the percentage of taxation in every State, Missouri\r\nincluded. The bill then might be justly entitled, _an act to restore the\r\nUnion, to advance the public credit, to hasten the overthrow of the\r\nrebellion, to augment the national wealth, and_ DECREASE THE RATE OF\r\nTAXATION. By overthrowing the rebellion, the taxes to pay the national\r\ndebt will be collected from all the States, instead of being confined to\r\nthose that are loyal. The rebel confederate debt, never having had any\r\nexistence in law or justice, but having been created only to support a\r\nwicked rebellion, will of course be expunged by the reëstablishment of\r\nthe Union. Indeed, by a new mathematical and philosophical principle,\r\nfar transcending the most sublime discoveries of Newton, Leibnitz, or La\r\nPlace, the rebel debt is redeemable six months _after the end of\r\neternity_, namely, six months after it is an _independent nation_, they\r\nshall have ratified a _treaty_ of peace with us! All the rebel State\r\ndebts incurred since the revolt, for the purpose of overthrowing the\r\nGovernment, will, of course, have no legal existence. Under the Federal\r\nConstitution, no State Legislature can have any lawful existence, except\r\nin conformity with its provisions, accompanied by a prior oath of every\r\nmember to support the Constitution of the United States. These\r\nassemblages, then, since the revolt in the several States, calling\r\nthemselves State Legislatures, never had any legal existence or\r\nauthority, and were mere assemblages of traitors. Such is the clear\r\nprovision of the Federal Constitution, and of the law of nations and of\r\njustice. It would be strange, indeed, if conventicles of traitors in\r\nrevolted States, could legally or rightfully impose taxes on the people\r\nof such States, loyal or disloyal, to overthrow the Government. Indeed,\r\nif justice could have her full sway, the whole debt of this Government,\r\nincurred to suppress this rebellion, ought to be paid by the traitors\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWith a restoration of the Union, the prosperity of all sections will be\r\nenormously increased. The South, with peace and with ports reopened,\r\nrelieved from rebel taxes and conscription, will again have a profitable\r\nmarket for their cotton, rice, naval stores, sugar, and tobacco; the\r\nWest for breadstuffs and provisions; the North for commerce, navigation\r\nand manufactures; and our revenue, from duties, would be vastly\r\naugmented, soon justifying a reduction of internal taxation. There is\r\none item of almost fabulous value that must not be omitted. The cotton\r\nnow in the Confederate States, of the unsold crops of 1860-'61,\r\n1861-'62, and 1862-'63, exceeds 5,000,000 of bales. This cotton, sold at\r\npresent prices, payable in federal paper, would be worth $1,800,000,000,\r\nor $1,134,000,000 in gold. If we diminish this one-half, as cotton might\r\nfall in price from time to time by the gradual reopening of our ports,\r\nthis cotton would still be worth $900,000,000 in our paper, and\r\n$567,000,000 in gold. This cotton, while putting all our spindles and\r\nthose of the world into full operation, would turn the balance of\r\nforeign trade at once immensely in our favor, and bring back streams of\r\ngold to our shores. We would at once commence the liquidation of the\r\nnational debt, with a large sinking fund, as a sacred trust applicable\r\nto that important subject.\r\n\r\nNext to maintaining our finances and the public credit, followed by\r\ndecisive victories in the field, the speedy success of emancipation in\r\nMissouri is most important. Missouri is larger by more than 6,000 square\r\nmiles than any State east of the Mississippi, and occupies a central\r\nposition between the North and the South, the East and the West. She is\r\nlarger by 16,458 square miles than England proper, containing a\r\npopulation of nineteen millions. She is larger by 1,098 square miles\r\nthan New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Delaware. She\r\nis larger by 5,264 square miles than all the New England States. She has\r\na greater white population than the aggregate numbers of North and South\r\nCarolina and Florida, or of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, or of\r\nArkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, or of Florida, Arkansas, South\r\nCarolina and Mississippi, or Louisiana; and a larger white population\r\nthan all Virginia, East and West. She had, if disloyal, by her position\r\nand large white population, more power to imperil the Union than any of\r\nthe slaveholding States. She has been true--she has suffered much in our\r\ncause, her fields and towns have been laid waste, thousands of her brave\r\nsons now fill our armies, and thousands more have fallen in our cause,\r\nand we will be recreant to truth and justice, to the safety of the\r\nUnion, and forfeit the nation's pledge, if we do not now aid her in\r\nbecoming a Free State. The southern boundary of Missouri (lat. 36°) is\r\nseveral miles south of Nashville, Tennessee; but, if we take altitude\r\nalso into consideration, then, according to well established\r\nmeteorological principles, the southern boundary of Missouri is at least\r\na degree south of Nashville, reaching the northern boundary of Alabama.\r\nThere is then a very large area of Missouri well calculated for the\r\nproduction of cotton. To accomplish this, the levee system of the\r\nMississippi must be extended from the southern boundary of Missouri to\r\nthe first highlands in that State, above the mouth of the Ohio; and a\r\nproper system of drainage adopted. These lands would thus be entirely\r\nsecured from overflow, and greatly improved in salubrity. With these\r\nimprovements, Missouri would contain an area of rich alluvial lands,\r\nwell adapted to the profitable culture of cotton, embracing an extent\r\ncapable of producing at least one million of bales of the great staple.\r\nThese lands, considering latitude and altitude, would possess a climate\r\nsimilar to that of Middle Tennessee and North Alabama, where cotton is\r\nalready cultivated with great profit. If emancipation prevailed in\r\nMissouri, these lands would soon be cultivated in cotton by free labor,\r\nand its immense superiority over the servile system would soon be\r\ndemonstrated. Such a proof of the superiority of free over slave labor,\r\neven in the culture of cotton, would soon have an immense effect in\r\nreconciling the South to the disappearance of a system so fatal to her\r\nown prosperity, and endangering so much the harmony and perpetuity of\r\nthe Union. This Missouri cotton would be nearer the North and Northwest\r\nthan that grown in any other part of the Southwest, and thus supplied at\r\na cheaper rate to our manufacturers, while opening new and augmented\r\nmarkets for the provisions and breadstuffs of the Northwest. This cotton\r\nwould, in part, pass up the Ohio to Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, and\r\nthence to New York, Philadelphia, and New England. It would also in part\r\npass through Indiana and Ohio by their railroads and canals. The great\r\ncentral railroad of Illinois would carry large portions of it also from\r\nCairo to Chicago; but perhaps the largest portion eventually would pass\r\nup the Mississippi and Illinois rivers and enlarged canals to Chicago,\r\nand thence eastward. With the proposed enlargement of the canal\r\nconnecting the Illinois river with Lake Michigan, and the enlargement of\r\nthe locks of the great Erie canal, extended by a similar enlargement of\r\nthe Chenango branch, and down the Susquehanna to tide water, cotton\r\nsteam propellers would carry the great staple by this route to the\r\nHudson and New England, to Baltimore or Philadelphia, at a rate much\r\nlower than any other Southwestern cotton. The Mississippi would thus\r\nhave a _quintuple_ outlet, as well into the lakes and the Hudson, the\r\nSt. Lawrence, the Delaware, and Chesapeake, as into the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nand Missouri would be united by new ties with the North, and Northwest,\r\nas well as with the Middle States. Cairo, St. Louis, Chicago,\r\nCincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Buffalo would become considerable\r\ncotton depots, and slave labor would cease to monopolize the cotton\r\nculture. But there are other considerations still more momentous.\r\nMissouri extends from the 36th parallel to 40-1/2, and from the 89th\r\nmeridian to the 96th, thus embracing four degrees and a half of\r\nlatitude, and seven degrees of longitude. She fronts for many hundred\r\nmiles upon the great Mississippi, and commands its western shore; she\r\ncommands also the mouth of the Missouri river, and both its banks for\r\nseveral hundred miles, and all its tributaries. The Missouri river and\r\nits tributaries are nearly double the length of the Mississippi and its\r\nbranches. Missouri by her position dominates the whole valley of her\r\ngreat river, and commands Kansas and Western Iowa, and Nebraska, and\r\nColorado, Dacotah and New Mexico. If Missouri had joined the Southern\r\nconfederacy, and its power had ever been established, she would have\r\nforced with her all the vast region to which we have referred,\r\ncontaining, including Missouri, an area equal to twenty States of the\r\nsize of Ohio. To separate Missouri forever from the proposed Southern\r\nconfederacy, is to render the permanent establishment of such a\r\ngovernment impossible. It not only severs Missouri from them, but all\r\nthe vast region identified with the destiny of that great State. Secure\r\nMissouri permanently and cordially to the Union, and the rebellion is\r\ndoomed to certain overthrow. With the fall of slavery in Missouri by her\r\nconsent, and her cordial coöperation and sympathy with the North and\r\nNorthwest, the days of the rebellion are numbered. With Missouri as a\r\nFree State, Arkansas, adjacent, cannot retain the institution. Such a\r\nresult, aided by victories, and the reëstablishment of our finances,\r\nwould soon give full effect to the edict of emancipation in Arkansas,\r\nand Louisiana would soon follow. With Missouri as a Free State by her\r\nconsent, and her cordial coöperation and sympathy, slavery would soon\r\ndisappear from the whole region west of the Mississippi, and Louisiana\r\ncordially be reunited to the Republic. With such a result, holding New\r\nOrleans and the mouth of the Mississippi and all the region west of that\r\ngreat stream, how could Tennessee or Mississippi remain in the Southern\r\nconfederacy? The truth is, Missouri is the pivot upon which the\r\nrebellion turns. Had she gone with the South, and given to its cause a\r\ncordial support, it would have been difficult to subdue the rebellion.\r\nThat she has gone with the Union is a momentous fact, and demands for\r\nher our heartfelt gratitude. I have shown, it is true, how greatly it is\r\nthe interest of Missouri to become a Free State; but it is still more\r\nthe interest of the nation to secure this great result. Give her what is\r\nneeded to render emancipation certain, and we shall have secured the\r\nperpetuity of the Union. Missouri had no participation in introducing\r\nAfrican slaves into this continent. The slaves that cultivate her soil\r\nare the descendants of those who were forced here under the British\r\nflag, or by the ships of the North, then in a state of colonial\r\ndependence; and it is just, and the national honor demands, that she\r\nshould receive full compensation. As the existence of slavery in any\r\nState is a great evil and reproach, and a source of much weakness to the\r\nwhole country, so should the nation compensate for any loss that may be\r\noccasioned by the abandonment of the system in any loyal State. Not only\r\nis this just, but the faith of the nation is solemnly pledged by\r\nresolutions adopted by Congress at its last session to carry this policy\r\ninto full effect with the consent of any State. Twenty millions of\r\ndollars to secure such a result should be regarded as of little moment.\r\nGladly would the nation pay a much larger sum for a single victory. But\r\nthe moral and geographical and strategical victory secured by\r\nemancipation in Missouri by her consent, will be far more important than\r\nany triumph yet achieved by our arms. It is a victory that relieves a\r\ngreat State now and forever from the curse of slavery. It is a victory\r\nthat secures the whole valley of the mighty Missouri to the Union. It is\r\na triumph that sweeps slavery from Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas,\r\ndissevers the Southern confederacy, and restores the whole Mississippi,\r\nfrom its mouth to its source, to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe entire constitutionality of such a proceeding by _compact with a\r\nState_, was demonstrated by me in the November number of the CONTINENTAL\r\nMONTHLY, p. 575. Referring to the case of Texas, I there said: 'The\r\nprinciple, however, was adopted of State action by irrevocable _compact_\r\nwith the Federal Government, by which provision therein was made for\r\nabolishing slavery in all such States, north of a certain parallel of\r\nlatitude (embracing a territory larger than New England), as might be\r\nthereafter admitted by the subdivision of the State of Texas. The power\r\nof action on this subject, by compact of a State with the General\r\nGovernment, was then clearly established, in perfect accordance with\r\nrepeated previous acts of Congress then cited by me. The doctrine rests\r\nupon the elemental principle of the combined authority of the nation,\r\nand a State, acting by compact within its limits.' When Missouri, with\r\nher consent, shall have become a Free State, the leaders of the Southern\r\nrebellion will feel that they have received a mortal blow. Especially\r\nwill this be the case in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee,\r\nMississippi, and Alabama. We shall have cut the gordian knot of slavery,\r\nand the death agonies of the hydra would soon be visible. The importance\r\nof the result would be felt in the North also, and the wretched traitors\r\nthere, far more guilty even than those of the South, will shrink from\r\ntheir atrocious conspiracy to dissolve this Union. The dark plot of\r\nsevering New England from the Republic and of reuniting the rest of the\r\nStates with the Southern confederacy, will be abandoned. That such a\r\nscheme is contemplated by Northern traitors, and that it is tolerated in\r\nthe South, _on condition_ that all shall become Slave States, is beyond\r\ncontroversy. New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Northwest are\r\nto abandon their free institutions, become slaveholding States, and be\r\nadmitted as such into the Southern confederacy. I had supposed that\r\ncrime had achieved its climax when the Southern rebellion was\r\ninaugurated; but something more base, more vile, more cowardly,\r\ndebasing, and pusillanimous, it seems, is now contemplated. It is that\r\nNew England shall be expelled, and that the rest of the Free States\r\nshall come under the dominion of the Southern confederacy. But the\r\nleaders of this scheme seem to have forgotten the fact, that New\r\nEngland, to a vast extent, has peopled the Northwest, and carried there\r\ntheir love of free institutions. The descendants of the pilgrims are\r\nscattered throughout the Northwest, and churches, and free schools, and\r\nlove of liberty have gone with them. The scheme is as base and cowardly\r\nas it is impracticable. No! New England can never be expelled from this\r\nUnion. There the grand idea of the American Union was first conceived;\r\nthere the cradle of liberty was first rocked, before as well as amid the\r\nstorms of the Revolution; there the first blood was shed, the first\r\nbattles fought, the first flag of Union and Liberty unfurled, and there\r\nit shall float forever. There are Lexington, and Concord, and Bunker\r\nHill, and no traitor hand shall ever sever them from the American Union.\r\nNot an acre of the soil of New England or a drop of all its waters shall\r\never be surrendered by this great Republic; and from Lake Champlain and\r\nthe Housatonick to the St. Croix and St. Johns, the flag of the Union\r\nshall ever float in undiminished glory. Lake Champlain unites Vermont\r\nand New England with the Hudson, the lakes, and St. Lawrence; and Long\r\nIsland Sound, commanding the deepest approaches to New York, completes\r\nthe connection, which is a geographical and political necessity. I am\r\nnot a New Englander by parentage, birth, or education, but if the other\r\nFree States of the North and Northwest should submit to the disgrace of\r\nuniting themselves with a Southern confederacy, I should remove to New\r\nEngland, and breathe an air uncontaminated by slavery or treason. And\r\nthere are hundreds of thousands who would pursue the same course. When,\r\nin 1798, the great Washington feared that the South might be separated\r\nby traitors from the Union, he declared that, in such an event, he would\r\nremove to the North; and, in such a contingency, there are thousands,\r\neven in the South, who would remove to New England.[7]\r\n\r\nThose of the North and Northwest, who should remain and carry their\r\nStates into the Southern confederacy, would be regarded in the South\r\nwith loathing and contempt; the whole civilized world would consider\r\ntheir degradation as complete and eternal. They would soon loathe\r\nthemselves, and feel that it was not only the negroes who were enslaved,\r\nbut that they had put fetters upon their own limbs, and rendered\r\nthemselves worthy to be worked as slaves on the plantations of Southern\r\nmasters. I do not believe any of the Free States of the North and\r\nNorthwest can thus be disgraced and humiliated. There is one of these\r\nStates, I am sure, that will never submit to such degradation. It is the\r\nState of Pennsylvania. There the Declaration of American Independence\r\nwas first proclaimed. There the Articles of Confederation and the\r\nConstitution were framed. There are Germantown, Paoli, and Brandywine:\r\nthere Washington crossed the Delaware at midnight, and fought the two\r\ngreat battles of the war of independence. There Franklin sleeps within\r\nher soil, the great patriot, philosopher, and statesman whom New England\r\ngave to Pennsylvania, the Union, and the world. No! No! from the\r\nDelaware and Susquehanna to the Ohio and Lake Erie, the people of a\r\nmighty State would consign to the scaffold and the block the wretched\r\ntraitors who would attempt to sever Pennsylvania from New England. Ice\r\nand granite are called the principal products of New England, but our\r\nRevolution and this rebellion prove that her great staples are\r\nintellect, education, liberty, courage, and patriotism. She is said to\r\nhave Puritan angularities and to love money; but she pours out now, as\r\nin 1776, lavish expenditures of her treasure in defence of the Union;\r\nand the blood of her sons empurples the ocean and the lakes in every\r\nnaval conflict, and moistens all the battle fields of the nation. No!\r\nall the traitors of the South, and all the Burrs, Arnolds, and Catalines\r\nof the North can never sever New England from the Republic. And now, in\r\nthis hour of our country's peril, Missouri stretches her hands to New\r\nEngland, and to all the free and loyal States, and proposes, with their\r\nassistance, to abolish slavery, and link her destiny with theirs in the\r\nbonds of a perpetual Union. And shall we hesitate for a moment, on such\r\na question? The money consideration is far less than a month's cost of\r\nthe war, and sinks into insignificance compared with the momentous\r\nresults and consequences. Emancipation in Missouri, with her consent and\r\nthe aid of Congress, is the first grand decisive victory of the Union in\r\nthis contest, insures eventual success, and must now be placed beyond\r\nall hazard or contingency.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: 7th vol.

He has some little reputation as a\r\nwriter on public and political topics; is highly connected, and, what is\r\nperhaps more to the purpose than aught else, is a very practical man,\r\nand son-in-law to Benoist d'Azy, who, possessed of an immense fortune,\r\nan extensive landowner and proprietor of iron forges, has done perhaps\r\nmore than any other man to advance the material interests of his country\r\nby railway building, mining, and agricultural improvements. We say that\r\nthis is more to the purpose, since it is of importance that the men who\r\n_actively_ employ capital should understand the falsehood of slavery as\r\na productive force in any system of labor, anywhere, at the present day.\r\nAnd it is highly significant when we find such men so far enlightened in\r\nFrance at this time, where, although, as we learn, very advanced views\r\nin political economy are set forth, we have still apprehended that a\r\ndeeply based attachment to slavery, common to all the Latin races,\r\nprevails. That the Radicals should oppose slavery is but natural, but\r\nsuch views among the highly cultivated aristocracy are indeed\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nWe cannot agree with M. Villemain, who, in his report from the Academy,\r\ndecreeing a prize of three thousand francs to M. Cochin for this work,\r\nspeaks of it as inspired with 'eloquent zeal' and 'ardor.' It is very\r\nfar from what it might have been as a _literary_ production; and to one\r\nnot interested in the facts and subject, is even--with the exception of\r\nits excellent Introduction--dry. The author is decidedly an economist,\r\nbut he is _not_ 'an apostle,' as his eulogist claims, unless it be in\r\nthe sense in which any great collector and publisher of truths may be\r\ntermed such. But on its true basis the work is indeed a great one, fully\r\ndeserving the publisher's advertisement words, 'opportune and\r\nimportant.' The volume before us is a complete history, in a minor\r\ndegree, of Slavery, and to a very full degree of Emancipation in the\r\nEnglish and French colonies, with some account of the same in those\r\nbelonging to Holland, Denmark, and Sweden. Having made for many years a\r\nspecialty of the subject, and having had placed at his disposal the\r\npublished and unpublished papers and records of every ministry of\r\nEurope, as, for instance, of the English Board of Trade, M. Cochin has\r\naccumulated a mass of extremely valuable material--all of which is\r\npresented in a very clear, perfectly well arranged form--and which we\r\nneed not say should be read by every one in public, since there is\r\ncertainly no intelligent American at the present day on whom the\r\nnecessity of acquiring full information on this subject is not almost a\r\nsolemn duty. Next after crushing rebellion, the great task of the\r\nFederal Government should be to organize labor and adopt a vigorous\r\n_central_ and _industrial_ policy. To do this, the relations of free and\r\nof slave labor to circumstances should be extensively studied. As in the\r\ncase of all wars involving an institution, the question between the\r\nNorth and the South at the present day is simply one between ignorance\r\nand knowledge--knowledge such as books like this are eminently adapted\r\nto disseminate.\r\n\r\nPassing by religious and philosophic argument, neither of which has been\r\nof much practical avail in this country, since we see the Church of the\r\nSouth quite as zealous in upholding slavery on Biblical grounds as that\r\nof the North is in opposing it, we come to Cochin's first real\r\nargument--that political economy affirms the superiority of free over\r\nforced labor. Policy and charity unite in this--'charity detests slavery\r\nbecause it oppresses; policy, more elevated, condemns it _because it\r\ncorrupts the inferior race_.'\r\n\r\nWe call attention to this sentence because it accurately expresses the\r\ndifference between mere 'Abolition,' which regarded only the sufferings\r\nof the blacks, and that higher and more comprehensive policy of\r\n'EMANCIPATION FOR THE SAKE OF THE WHITE MAN,' which declares that\r\nslavery always in time inevitably makes of the slaveholder an\r\nintolerable neighbor to the free white laborer. From this point our\r\nauthor sets forth the gradual growth of the aversion to slavery all over\r\nthe Continent, with the reactionary tendency in its favor in the Cotton\r\nUnited States and in England. It is needless to say that, before the\r\noverwhelming light of _facts_ presented, especially when these facts are\r\ndrawn from the past as well as the present, and from every country\r\ninstead of _one_, slavery is shown to be more than deadly-conservative;\r\nmore than cruel; more than a mere dead wall in the way of the onward\r\nmarch of the century. The time will come when such a curse will be\r\nrooted out of a country by the strong hand of all civilized nations. Had\r\nEngland and France been truly enlightened to their own interests, this\r\nwar would never have taken place.\r\n\r\nThe history of the African slave trade and the efforts to destroy it,\r\nthe Emancipation of the French Convention and the reëstablishment of\r\nslavery by the Consulate, from 1794 to 1802, form the first chapter of\r\nthis work. Hence we have its history, its abolition in 1848, and, after\r\nthis, that most important part, a careful examination of the results of\r\nEmancipation, showing--as Sewall and others have done--the grossness of\r\nthe current falsehood to the effect that it has led to evil results. For\r\nthose who can see only a part instead of the whole, who regard the\r\namount of good done to themselves as the test of everything, who make no\r\nallowance for a social transition, or for a future (like our own\r\n'treason-Democrats'), and who see in the black, whether slave or free,\r\nsimply a creature whose whole mission is to benefit the white, it is\r\ntrue that Emancipation in certain isolated cases may not appear to have\r\nfully succeeded. The _truth_ is, that freed labor has nowhere\r\ndiminished--it has simply assumed _new forms_, more advantageous, for\r\nthe time, to the laborer, while in most cases it has increased its\r\nprofits. If slaves were overworked, there was no real gain;--if schools\r\nand marriage, cleanly independence and good clothing have increased\r\ntenfold among those who were once naked, starved, and ignorant, there\r\nhas been a gain, although here and there less sugar is exported. And so\r\nthe reader may trace the arguments and facts to the end.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, we feel almost ashamed that such a book should be really\r\nneeded! What true _scholar_ and honest man requires arguments of this\r\nkind? A thousand or two years ago, any king's daughter, any young lady,\r\nanybody walking in a lonely spot, was in danger of being kidnapped and\r\nsold to prostitution or slavery. Philosophers, poets, and artists were\r\nowned by brutal wretches; pious priests purchased gentlemen of noble\r\nbirth for slaves. The pirate's galley swept every coast to steal any\r\nhuman being. Time rolled on, and slavery was modified. White slaves\r\nbecame serfs, serfs became free. The cause of emancipation is clear as\r\nthat of any progressive reform--and yet, right in the face of history\r\nand God's truth, we see the Southern Confederacy and the British people\r\ndaring to put themselves forward as the advocates of a crime so rapidly\r\nbecoming obsolete. Yes--that is what the land of Wilberforce is now\r\n_practically_ doing, while several of her writers, turning on their\r\ntracks, are beginning to 'reconsider' the subject in their writings!\r\n\r\n\r\n     WAR SONGS FOR FREEMEN. Dedicated to the Army of the United States.\r\n     Third Edition. Printed for the New York Volunteers. Boston: Ticknor\r\n     & Fields.\r\n\r\nHave you a friend in the army, especially one who sings occasionally, or\r\nif he be not canorous, say a friend who likes to read songs and hear\r\nthem sung by others? In other words, would you, young lady reader (or\r\nany other reader), like to give some soldier at least half an hour's\r\namusement for a very trivial outlay? In such case we recommend you to\r\npurchase this little pamphlet, and investing in a postage stamp, send it\r\noff without delay to the Army of the ----, whatever _that_ may be.\r\n\r\nThe work in question contains thirty songs of the war, mostly written\r\nexpressly for the book, and each accompanied by the music, in nearly all\r\ncases with the bass. Among the contributors are Dr. O. W. Holmes, who\r\nhas given two capital lyrics, 'Union' and 'Liberty,' and a superb\r\ntrumpet song, well adapted to _Was blasen die Trompeten?_ or 'What are\r\nthe trumpets blowing?' a spirited German air. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe\r\ncontributes a 'Harvard Student's Song', which is of course brilliant,\r\nearnest, and beautiful. It is set to the glorious old\r\nSlavonian--subsequently German air:\r\n\r\n   'Denkst du duran mein tapf'rer Lagienka?'\r\n\r\nwhich no one ever heard without loving. C. T. Brooks, has given to the\r\ngrand and swelling _Landesvater_ words in every way worthy of it:\r\n\r\n           'Comrades plighted,\r\n           Fast united,\r\n       Firm to death for Freedom stand!\r\n   See your country torn and bleeding,\r\n   Hear a mother's solemn pleading!\r\n       Rescue Freedom's promised land.'\r\n\r\nThe same author also gives the well known 'Korner's Prayer,' and 'The\r\nVow.' From Mrs. T. Sedgwick we find a fine bold song, 'For a' that and\r\na' that,' of course to the good old air of that name--a lyric of such\r\ndecided merit in most respects that we regret to notice in it the\r\nvenerable bull of 'polar stars,' quizzed long ago in another writer. Our\r\ncontributor, Henry Perry Leland, has in this collection two songs, both\r\nstrongly marked with the camp, neither setting forth the slightest\r\nearthly claim to be regarded as 'elevated poesie,' yet both remarkably\r\nsing-able, and probably destined to become broadly popular. Of these,\r\n'Bully Boy Billy,' is set to a lilting 'devil may care' Low-Dutch camp\r\ntune--one of the kind which 'sings itself,' and is well adapted to a\r\nroaring chorus. From the same we find a lyric detailing the loss of a\r\nbriarwood pipe stolen in a raid, which the grieving 'sojer' trusts (as\r\nwe most sincerely do with him) may be found when Richmond's taken. Among\r\nthe remaining lyrics are five by Charles Godfrey Leland, including\r\n'We're at War,' to the bold French air of the _Choeur des Girondins_,\r\n'Northmen Come Out,' to the _Burschen heraus_, and 'Shall Freedom Droop\r\nand Die?' to the fine old air of 'Trelawney.' 'The Cavalry Song' has a\r\nbrave air, composed for it by John K. Paine. Very spirited and merry is\r\n'Overtures from Richmond,' set to the quaint air of '_Lilliburlero,\r\nbullen a la_,' which is said to have 'sung a deluded prince out of three\r\nkingdoms.' We trust that some of the old charm still sticks to the magic\r\nwords, and that it may do as much for King Jeff. as it once did for King\r\nJames. Among the remaining lyrics are the following: 'Put it Through,'\r\nand 'Old Faneuil Hall,' by E. E. Hale; 'Our Country is Calling,' to\r\n'_Wohlauf Kameraden!_' by Rev. F. H. Hedge, and a translation of\r\nLuther's _Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott_ by the same; Hauff's 'Night\r\nGuard,' an exquisite German air, and 'I'll be a Sergeant,' and 'Would\r\nyou be a Soldier, Laddy?' both of them capital spirited soldier-songs.\r\nLast, not least, we have the 'Lass of the Pamunkey,' by F. J. Child. We\r\nknow not whether the incident detailed be strictly autobiographic or\r\nborrowed; it is at any rate well told and merrily music-ed.\r\n\r\nThe reader will do well to observe that this collection, which has\r\nalready become immensely popular, and has furnished material for more\r\nthan one excellent patriotic concert, is prepared solely for the benefit\r\nof the solders, _and that the proceeds of the sale of the book are all\r\ndevoted to distributing it in the army_. All who wish to make a most\r\nacceptable little gift at a trifling price; all who are 'sending things'\r\nto the army; all who would secure an interesting specimen of the songs\r\nof the war, and, finally, all who would own a really excellent musical\r\nwork, should send an order for the above mentioned to Messrs. Ticknor &\r\nFields.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE NATIONAL ALMANAC AND ANNUAL RECORD FOR 1863. 12mo, pp. 704.\r\n     Philadelphia: George W. Childs. New York: Charles T. Evans.\r\n\r\nIf Dickens's illustrious statistician, Mr. Gradgrind, were in the flesh\r\nto-day, how he would gloat over this book! The 'facts' presented in its\r\nseven hundred double-columned pages would satisfy, even to repletion,\r\nhis voracious cravings; and once crammed with them, he would go forth\r\ninto society a walking cyclopedia of all that appertained to the civil,\r\nmilitary, agricultural, industrial, financial, educational, charitable,\r\nand religious condition of these United States.\r\n\r\nBut though we make no claim to belong to the Gradgrind family, we\r\nacknowledge with pleasure our gratification with this book. It has long\r\nbeen matter of reproach against us on the part of foreign writers on\r\ncommerce and statistical science, that we produced no statistical works\r\nworthy the name. The publication of this work will forever put that\r\nreproach to silence. We have examined the book with care, and have been\r\nat a loss which most to admire, the patient and extraordinary labor\r\nwhich had brought together so vast a collection of important facts, or\r\nthe complete and exhaustive treatment of every subject.\r\n\r\nIt is a marked characteristic of the work that, while omitting nothing\r\nnecessary to a full elucidation of the past condition of the country, it\r\nbrings all its statistics up to the latest dates. The United States debt\r\nis given to December 1, 1862; the Government receipts and expenditures\r\nfor the financial year 1862; the issues of the mint to the autumn of\r\n1862; the contributions of each State to the volunteer army to December,\r\n1862; the finances of most of the States to the same date; even the\r\nPacific States being brought up to last autumn; and the condition of the\r\nRebel army and finances to January 1, 1863. Such enterprise deserves,\r\nand must achieve success.\r\n\r\nNoticeable, too, for its completeness and thoroughness, is the 'Record\r\nof Events' of the war, occupying nearly eighty pages, and forming a\r\ncontinuous and admirable journal of the war up to the close of last\r\nyear. In the States, also, the fulness and variety of detail of the\r\nfinances, debts, banks, railroads (a new feature), educational\r\ninstitutions, charitable and correctional organizations, agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, and military organization of each State, possess a deep\r\ninterest to any man who desires to know the actual condition and\r\nresources of his country. We were particularly pleased with a series of\r\ndiagrams, prepared by Prof. Gillespie of Union College, illustrating at\r\na glance the changes which have taken place in the relative population\r\nof the different States, the relative proportion of increase of white\r\nand of slave population, and the effect produced by this upon different\r\nsections. We have not, at the late hour at which we write, time or room\r\nto indicate a tithe of the valuable features of this remarkable book; we\r\ncan only say, that whoever expends the small sum necessary for its\r\npurchase, will most assuredly obtain an ample equivalent for his money.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE ORPHEUS C. KERR PAPERS. Second Series. New York: Carleton, 413\r\n     Broadway. 1863.\r\n\r\nDuring the present decade the American public has welcomed almost\r\nannually a new humorist. Thus we have seen in rapid succession John\r\nPhoenix, Doesticks, Fanny Fern, and Artemus Ward enjoying\r\nextraordinary popularity, and then new 'lords of misrule' 'reigning in\r\ntheir stead.' The last popular favorite is 'Orpheus C. Kerr'--a name\r\nthinly disguising that of Office Seeker, and which is not indeed too\r\nwell chosen, since in the volume before us little or nothing relative to\r\nthe very suggestive subject of office-seeking, on the part of the author\r\nat least, is to be found. The book itself is, however, marvellously\r\nlaugh provoking, abounding in the oddest conceits, strangest stories,\r\nand drollest extravaganzas in the most ultra American vein. If the men\r\nwho best ridicule great failures in war and in politics, are the ones\r\nmost to be dreaded, it must be admitted that 'Orpheus C. Kerr' is the\r\nsharpest thorn which has been as yet planted in the side of the 'Young\r\nNapoleons' of our army, whose ability seems to consist in building up\r\nthe strength of the enemy by delay and in canvassing indirectly for the\r\nPresidency. There is no cause so good as to be without abuses, and the\r\nabuses which have crept into our management of the war are touched off\r\nin these papers as merrily as unmercifully. They have done 'yeoman's\r\nservice' in the press, hitting all sides, but bearing most heavily on\r\n'Young Napoleon' and the _status quo_ Democracy. It cannot be denied\r\nthat the humor of these sketches is often merely extravagant, sometimes\r\nharshly strained, and occasionally bare and thin enough in all\r\nconscience, while the stories of the Cosmopolite Club seem like mere\r\n'filling up' to 'make pages;' yet with all this there is more real wit,\r\nhumor, and life-knowledge in this volume than would give tone and\r\nstrength to half a dozen ordinary popular essayists of the Country\r\nParson school. Extravagance is however to American narrative what it is\r\nto Arab conversation, something much less _outré_ to those who are born\r\nto it than to strangers, who are unable to discount like the natives as\r\nfast as the sums total are set down. Making every allowance for every\r\ndefect, there remains in 'Orpheus C. Kerr' a residuum of irresistible\r\nhumor, provoking scores of hearty laughs, and many indications of a\r\nbasis of thought and of literary ability which place him far in advance\r\nof the later writers of his school. He takes a wider range, too wide\r\nindeed at times, since he occasionally becomes 'Cockneyfied.' We wish\r\nthat 'Villiam' and the Willis-y 'my boy' were less frequently mentioned.\r\nYet as all this is atoned for by abundance of true American fun, we\r\nreadily pardon such echoes, trusting that in his future writings our\r\nhumorist will endeavor to be in all things truly original. He can be so\r\nby the very simple process of pruning.\r\n\r\n\r\n     POEMS. By THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH. New York: Carleton. 1863.\r\n\r\nMost of these very pleasant little strains of word-music and of graceful\r\nthought have been frequently brought before the American public, and\r\nbecome familiar favorites. They now reappear to advantage in a delicate\r\nblue-and-gold volume, with a medallion portrait of the poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MODERN WAR: Its Theory and Practice Illustrated from Celebrated\r\n     Campaigns and Battles. With Maps and Diagrams. By EMERIC SZABAD,\r\n     Captain U. S. A. New York: Harper & Brothers. 1863.\r\n\r\nAn excellent work, of an eminently practical nature, which may be read\r\nwith interest and profit by every one in a time when there\r\nare so few who do not assume to be more or less critical in the art of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE PIRATES OF THE PRAIRIES; or, Adventures in the American Desert.\r\n     By GUSTAVE AIMARD. Philadelphia: T. B. Peterson. New York: Frederic\r\n     A. Brady. 1863.\r\n\r\nA very trashy wildcat romance, highly spiced with sensation sentiment,\r\n\"r-r-revenge,\" and other melo-dramatic attributes. Its author is well\r\nknown as an extensive contributor to what may be called the\r\nSadly-Neglected-Apprentice school of literature and of readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ANDREE DE TAVERNEY, or the Downfall of French Monarchy. By\r\n     ALEXANDER DUMAS. Philadelphia: T. B. Peterson & Brothers. 1863.\r\n\r\nWhen we, on the publishers' authority, inform the reader that this is\r\nreally 'the _final_ conclusion' of the 'Countess of Charny,' the\r\n'Memoirs of a Physician,' and a small library of other works, we shall\r\ndoubtless send a thrill of joy to more than one heart. Incredible as it\r\nmay appear, the Dumas factory, as _Maquet_ termed it, has actually\r\nfinished one of its valuable historical series--unless indeed the\r\ndirector-in-chief should see fit to republish the long-forgotten first\r\nvolume, as a subsequent final conclusion to this of 'Andree de\r\nTaverney.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     VERNER'S PRIDE; a Tale of Domestic Life. By Mrs. HENRY WOOD. In two\r\n     volumes. Philadelphia: T. B. Peterson & Brothers. 1863.\r\n\r\nA decidedly English novel, of a type well known to our public, embracing\r\nfew novelties of character, yet well written, with the story well told.\r\nIt has, we believe, been so fortunate as to secure a wide circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a dangerous task for the editor of a monthly review, in times like\r\nthese, to comment on what has been or is likely to be done by the army,\r\nwhen no one knows what a day may bring forth. But, as regards those of\r\nthe enemy among us who are scheming to aid and abet their Southern\r\nfriends, we may speak more confidently. These traitors, though they have\r\nof late cast off the mask, and no longer pretend to aid the\r\nAdministration and the cause of the Union, are still obliged to move\r\nwith the caution without which trachery and cowardice would soon perish.\r\nIt is, however, a bitter and a humiliating thought that they are so\r\nopenly active among us, that they hold meetings where the ruin of the\r\ncountry is calmly meditated, that they form clubs, that they stir up the\r\nmob of their degraded hangers-on to hurrah for JEFFERSON DAVIS in our\r\nstreets, and that finally no amount of exposure and of denunciation in\r\nthe patriotic press seems to have the slightest effect in attracting to\r\nthem the punishment they deserve.\r\n\r\nThe traitors of whom we speak are of two classes, the leaders and the\r\ndupes. The latter, careless of the fact that even if a _sudden_ peace\r\ncould be brought about it must overwhelm the country in financial ruin,\r\nbelieve in a restitution of the _status quo ante bellum_. They think\r\nthat their leaders will, in unison with DAVIS and his colleagues,\r\nreunite, annul Emancipation, disavow the acts of the Lincoln\r\nAdministration, and reëstablish Slavery. Cotton is again to be king, and\r\nall go on as of old, save that New England is to be thrown out of the\r\nconfederacy. They are encouraged in this belief by lying or cunningly\r\nmanaged letters from the South, and by assurances that the confederate\r\nleaders are secretly working to this end and aim. 'We got along very\r\nwell before the war,' is their constant complaint, 'and we could do as\r\nwell again, were it not for the Emancipationists.' Among the lukewarm,\r\nthe cowardly, the meanly selfish and avaricious, and the habitual\r\ngrumblers, such doctrines are readily made plausible. Those especially,\r\nwho measure the propriety of carrying on a war solely by the amount of\r\nsuccess which they desire, and who are incapable of great thoughts and\r\nprinciples, are easily duped by intriguing villany.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of these dupes have no faith whatever in restoring the\r\nUnion. They have no desire to restore it. Men like Fernando Wood hope\r\nfrom their very hearts for a complete disintegration--the more thorough,\r\nfor them, the better. They could never expect to command the ship, and\r\nso they are willing to wreck her, in the hope of each securing a\r\nfragment. Ruined in character in the eyes of all honest men, their names\r\na byword for treason, and in most cases for literal crimes, political\r\noutcasts of the stamp who are said to vibrate between the legislature\r\nand the penitentiary, these desperadoes are now working with all their\r\nmight to mass the cowardice of the North into a body powerful enough to\r\ndo collectively, that for which an individual has in all countries and\r\nin all ages been judged worthy the gallows. But for this war they must\r\nhave been confined to representing the dangerous classes of our\r\ncities--the ignorance and vice which finds in them congenial leaders. As\r\nit is, they hope for wider fields and more absolute sway.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to apprehend that the men who are really true to the\r\nUnion do not appreciate the extent to which treason is working among us.\r\nWorse than all, there are many, who, while believing themselves true to\r\nthe good cause, are, by constant grumbling and complaint, aiding the\r\nvery worst form of disunion. Could we prevail with one prayer upon the\r\nheart of every Federal freeman, it would be to implore him in this hour\r\nof trial not to withold his warmest support from the Administration and\r\nto fall into the common weakness of fault-finding and despairing. Such\r\nenormous wars as this never have been ended in a few months; wars\r\nespecially which involve the deepest antagonism of social principles in\r\nexistence. And our winnings have been neither few nor light. The\r\nSouthern Border States, with little exception, are now ours, and will\r\ninevitably be fully won in time: New Orleans is a pledge, with other\r\nimportant points, and the enemy admit that every Southern seaboard town\r\nis destined to be taken. Does this look like the wild boasting of the\r\nSouth two years ago, when the North was to be plundered, Washington\r\ntaken, and the Free States trampled under the heel of a chivalry\r\nfiercely crying, _Væ victis!_'--'Woe to the conquered!'? There is no\r\ndanger now from the enemy: as he himself admits, two years more of the\r\nwar would not, at the rate in which we progress, leave him a single\r\nState; and be it borne in mind that a _speedy_ return to peace is only\r\nto be purchased at the price of a terrible financial crisis.\r\n\r\nBut we are in danger from the traitors _at home_. JEFFERSON DAVIS is\r\nless deadly to the Federal Union and less to be dreaded than the men who\r\nare scheming to make of New York a free city, and of every State and\r\ncounty a feudal principality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe intentions of Louis Napoleon as regards Mexico are beginning to\r\nexcite interest. Whatever they may be, there is one thing which it would\r\nbe well for the French Emperor never to forget. He holds France simply\r\nas a pledge to the Revolution. So long as he remains true to the cause\r\nof liberty--and, despite names and circumstances, he has been truer to\r\nit than many suppose--he will remain in power. When he is false to it he\r\nwill perish. It was through forgetting this that his uncle died at St.\r\nHelena--it was through forgetting this that Louis Philippe quitted Paris\r\nin a very citizenly but most un-kingly manner. The _bourgeoisie_ of\r\nFrance and the gossips of Paris may storm at the Federal Union,\r\n_épiciers_ may growl for our sugar, and operatives for cotton, but this\r\nclass--on whom Louis Philippe made the mistake of solely relying, with a\r\nlittle help from the aristocracy--are not the men who guide the storms\r\nof revolution in France. The arch spirits of mischief are more secret,\r\nand of late years they have learned much. They are no longer so much\r\ninclined to Socialism, Père Cabét and 'national ateliérs,' still less to\r\nguillotines and noyades. But they are firm as ever, as jealous of\r\ndespotism as ever, and, for an oppressor, as powerful as ever. And we\r\nbelieve that this class of men are firmly attached to the great cause of\r\nprogressive freedom as represented by the Federal States and by the\r\npresent Administration. Every day sees the truth spreading in France,\r\nand with its extension goes a deeply seated interest in the abolition of\r\nslavery. France--unlike England--feels shame at the idea of being\r\nchronicled in history as aiding oppression. The Frenchman is not so\r\nenormously conceited, so pitiably vain as to believe, like the Briton,\r\nthat a crime is a virtue when for _his_ own peculiar interest. Vain as\r\nthe French may be, they have not quite come to _that_.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the French are a shrewd nation. We were wont to\r\nthink of old that there was more spite than intelligence in the epithet\r\nby which they characterized John Bull as 'perfidious.' They were right,\r\nfor time has shown us that Venice, in the full bloom of her night-shade\r\niniquity and poniard policy, was never falser at heart than this great,\r\nbrawling, boasting, beef-eating England--this 'merry England' of paupers\r\nand prisons, where one man in every eight is buried at public\r\nexpense--this Mother England, which starves away annually half a million\r\nof emigrants--this Honest Old England, which floods the world with\r\npick-pockets, burglars, and correspondents for the _Times_.\r\n\r\nIt was a trifling thing which brought on the French Revolution of\r\n1848--the return of foreign refugees to Austria, and other significant\r\nindications of joining with the old powers in oppressing freedom. Let\r\nLouis Napoleon beware of an anti-American policy--for to every such\r\npolicy there will be an opposition, with a spectre of the Revolution in\r\nthe background.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen these remarks meet the eye of the reader, the infamous conduct of\r\nthe drunken Delaware Southern-ape Senator, SAULSBURY, will in all\r\nprobability have been forgotten. We have for so many years been so\r\nfamiliarized with the ribald or rowdy pranks of the chivalry, and of\r\nthose more miserable wretches their Northern servants, that the mass of\r\nthe public seems even yet quite willing to endure, for the poor payment\r\nof an apology, conduct which should anywhere have promptly consigned to\r\nimprisonment, at least, the guilty one. Not but that the apology of\r\nSAULSBURY was humble enough in all conscience. But it is time that our\r\nhalls of legislation were thoroughly purified, now that 'chivalric'\r\nbrigandage and the Southern system of personal retaliation no longer\r\nprevail. The first legislator who shall dare to draw a weapon in a place\r\nsacred to the councils of his country, should be permanently expelled\r\nfrom those councils, and made to feel by rigorous imprisonment, and\r\nlife-long disfranchisement, the enormous infamy of his offence. We\r\nwonder that the English press treats us as a nation of boors and fools,\r\nand yet permit a representative on the floor of the Senate to set forth\r\nin his own person the worst of which a boor or fool is capable, and\r\naccept as full reparation a drunken-headaching apology!\r\n\r\nThese are the days of reform, and we sincerely trust that the reform\r\nwill extend to the conduct of all our representatives, especially in\r\nCongress. The man who shall dare to apply, not merely to the President,\r\nbut to any fellow member, while in either House, any terms of personal\r\nabuse, should incur a punishment which would teach him for the future to\r\nkeep a civil tongue in his head, and make him endeavor to assume in\r\nfuture, at least the outward deportment of a gentleman. The going armed\r\ninto such an assembly should however be promptly visited with a penalty\r\nof the extremest severity. It is time that the North freed itself\r\nentirely of these Southern 'dead rabbits' of the Saulsbury stamp, and\r\nindicated by every means in its power its determination to progress in\r\nthe path of justice, order, and civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll contributions, letters, &c., intended for the editors of THE\r\nCONTINENTAL MAGAZINE, should be addressed to the care of JOHN F.

W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rise in specie and in exchange is, we observe, spoken of as\r\n'unprecedented'. The following extract from a work entitled, 'The\r\nBritish Empire in America,' written in 1740, shows that we are as yet\r\nfar from having attained the differences in these respects:\r\n\r\n     'As to Money, they have none, Gold or Silver: About 50 Years ago\r\n     they had some coined at _Boston_; but there's not enough now for\r\n     Retailers. All Payments are in Province Bills, even so low as _Half\r\n     a Crown_; thus every Man's Money is his Pocket Book. This makes the\r\n     Course of Exchange so exorbitant, that 100_l._ in _London_ made out\r\n     lately 225_l._ in _New-England_; and if a Merchant sells his Goods\r\n     from _England_ at 220_l._ Advance upon 100_l._ in the Invoice, he\r\n     would be a Loser by the Bargain, considering the incidental Charges\r\n     on his Invoice.'\r\n\r\nSo that after all, they had as great 'ups and downs' of old as do we of\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nApropos of the old book in question, it abounds in quaint bits of\r\ninformation, given in a dry, free and easy style seldom found at the\r\npresent day in any work of the kind. Thus it tells us, among the\r\nanecdotes of ELLIOT the missionary, that an Indian in a religious\r\nconference asked how GOD could create man in his own image, since\r\naccording to the second commandment it was forbidden to make any such\r\nimage?\r\n\r\n'To qualify him for the Work he was going about, Mr _Elliot_ learnt the\r\n_Indian_ Language as barbarous as can come out of the Mouth of Man, as\r\nwill be seen by these Instances:\r\n\r\n'_Nummatchekodtantamoonganunnonash_, is in English, _Our Lusts_; a Word\r\nthat the Reverend Mr _Elliot_ must often have occasion to make Use of.\r\nAs long as it is, we meet with a longer still:\r\n\r\n'_Kummogkodonattoottummoooctiteaongannunonash_, meaning Our Question.\r\n\r\n'_Gannunonash_' seems to be 'our,' because we find it in the End of the\r\nFirst Word, as well as the second, * * and this appears again in another\r\nWord:\r\n\r\n'_Noowomantammooonkanunnonash_, 'Our Loves.'\r\n\r\n'The longest of these _Indian_ Words is to be measured by the Inch, and\r\nreaches to near half a Foot; and if Mr _Elliot_ did put as many of these\r\nWords in a Sermon of his, as Mr _Peters_ put _English_ Words in one of\r\nhis Sermons, everyone of them must have made a sizeable Book and have\r\ntaken up three or four Hours in utterance.'\r\n\r\nThe Peters referred to was the celebrated Hugh Peters, Cromwell's\r\nchaplain. Our author vindicates this clergyman from certain scandalous\r\ncharges, declaring that he had asked of his daughter, Miss Peters, if\r\nthey were so, which she had utterly denied! Less credulous is he as\r\nregarded 'William Pen' (with whom he seems to have been on terms of\r\ngreat personal intimacy), since he hints very broadly in one passage,\r\nthat he put no faith whatever in a certain assertion of 'Pen' as to his\r\nown (Penn's) good behavior when amiably smiled on by a _belle sauvage_,\r\nwho, as the French would say, was not savage at all. 'Scandal, scandal\r\nall,' we doubt not. There are gossipers in every age, tattlers in every\r\ncorner of history, and who escapes them? Cato did not, Washington could\r\nnot, and 'Mr Pen' even must fill his place with the great maligned. Let\r\nus trust that our incautious dip from the old work may not, suggest to\r\nany novel maker 'Penn and the Princess,--a Tale of the Olden Time.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following poem, which we find in the Philadelphia _Press_, is among\r\nthe best of the many sad lyrics which the war has inspired. The music of\r\nthe refrain is remarkable:\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRGE FOR A SOLDIER.\r\n\r\nBy George H. Boker\r\n\r\n   Close his eyes; his work is done!\r\n     What to him is friend or foeman,\r\n   Rise of moon, or set of sun,\r\n     Hand of man, or kiss of woman?\r\n       Lay him low, lay him low,\r\n       In the clover or the snow:\r\n       What cares he? he cannot know:\r\n         Lay him low!\r\n\r\n   As man may, he fought his fight,\r\n     Proved his truth by his endeavor;\r\n   Let him sleep in solemn night,\r\n     Sleep forever and forever.\r\n       Lay him low, lay him low,\r\n       In the clover or the snow:\r\n       What cares he? he cannot know:\r\n         Lay him low!\r\n\r\n   Fold him in his country's stars;\r\n     Roll the drum and fire the volley!\r\n   What to him are all our wars,\r\n     What but death bemocking folly?\r\n       Lay him low, lay him low,\r\n       In the clover or the snow:\r\n       What cares he? he cannot know:\r\n         Lay him low!\r\n\r\n   Leave him to God's watching eye;\r\n     Trust him to the Hand that made him.\r\n   Mortal love weeps idly by:\r\n     God alone has power to aid him.\r\n       Lay him low, lay him low,\r\n       In the clover or the snow:\r\n       What cares he? he cannot know:\r\n         Lay him low!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the high price paid to opera singers. The\r\ncelebrated BERLIOZ once reduced it to details in the following word:\r\n\r\n     'The first tenor,' he said, 'has 100,000 frcs. per annum, and he\r\n     sings for it about seven times during the month, or eighty-four\r\n     times during the year. This would be about 1,100 francs per\r\n     evening. Admitted then that his part would contain 1,100 notes or\r\n     syllables, the price of each syllable would be 1 franc.\r\n     Consequently in William Tell:\r\n\r\n   'Ma (1 fr.) presence (3 fr.) pourvous est peut etre un outrage (9 fr.)\r\n   Mathilde (3 fr.) mes pas indiscret (100 sous).\r\n   On osée jusqu'a vous se frayer une passage! (13 fr.)\r\n\r\n     'These three lines therefore cost 34 francs. A great sum! Engaging\r\n     under these circumstances a Prima Donna, at the miserable pittance\r\n     of 40,000 francs, the answer of Mathilde amounts to much less, for\r\n     every syllable would then cost but 8 sous: but even that is not so\r\n     bad after all.\r\n\r\n     'We laugh,' adds Berlioz, 'but the theatres have to pay. They will\r\n     pay until the treasury is empty, and after that the 'Immortals'\r\n     will have to condescend to give singing lessons (i.e., those who\r\n     know enough for it), or to sing at public places with accompaniment\r\n     of one guitar, four candles, and a green carpet. After that we may\r\n     be able to construct the Temple of Music on a firmer basis.'\r\n\r\nAt these rates, the old form of declaring that any thing went for 'a\r\nmere song,' would not say much for its cheapness. But if--as Berlioz\r\nseems to think--these high prices are to be regretted, we still cannot\r\nsee how they are to be remedied. The public, for want of better\r\namusement, keep up the opera, and the different opera houses keep up\r\nthe prices by outbidding each other. When municipal governments shall\r\nrecognize the fact that amusement is a constant quantity in the\r\nadministration of a state, and provide first-class entertainments\r\n_gratis_ or at nominal rates, there will be much vice done away with and\r\nmany rum shops closed--which would be bad, by the way, for the\r\nDemocrato-Rum-elected Governor Seymour, for the whole alcoholic vote was\r\ncast in his favor. There will, we believe, come a time when the party of\r\nprogress will urge an enlarged provision of education and recreation for\r\nthe people, with the same earnestness which it now shows in forwarding\r\nEmancipation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEngland has by her Southern sympathy fairly put a serpent girdle of her\r\ntreachery around the earth.

But coming on a plantation where chickens and\r\n     turkeys were dallying in the sunshine, the officer in command,\r\n     tired of pork and plaster-pies, alias hard biscuit, gave the boys\r\n     leave to club over as many of the 'two-legged things in feathers'\r\n     as they could conveniently come at. The result was that a good\r\n     number were despatched, and being tied together by the legs, were\r\n     slung over the pommel of the saddle of 'Benny,' an old _sabreur_,\r\n     who had frontiered it for years, been in more Indian fights than\r\n     you could shake a stick at, and could tell, if he wanted to, of\r\n     some high-old-hard times with these same Mdewakantonwar, Wahpekute,\r\n     Ihanktonwannas, and Minnikanyewazhipu red-skinned fiends.\r\n\r\n     Returning to camp, as ill luck would have it, they met the colonel\r\n     of their regiment riding out to a neighboring camp. Just before\r\n     they met him, in fact when they were nearly up to him, for a curve\r\n     in the road had hid him from sight till then, the officer in\r\n     command rode by Benny with the command:\r\n\r\n     'D--n it, man, why don't you sling those chickens the other side\r\n     your saddle? The colonel will see them, hanging that way.'\r\n\r\n     'Can't be done! got fourteen turkeys _there_ on a balance!'\r\n\r\n     By remarkably good fortune the colonel did not see the chickens, so\r\n     they and the turkeys were safely smuggled into camp, Benny getting\r\n     full credit for maintaining the balance of power, when the odds\r\n     were dead against him.\r\n\r\nStory ye second:\r\n\r\n     When the Forty-eleventh P.M. were camped near Boonesboro', what\r\n     time the rebels were driven out of Maryland, the colonel of the\r\n     said regiment duly issued orders that all provender taken by troops\r\n     under his command should be fairly paid for without defalcation for\r\n     value received. Now it happened one bright morning that the major\r\n     of the aforesaid regiment riding out near camp, saw a private\r\n     deliberately lift up what is known in Southern tongue as a 'rock,'\r\n     and throwing the same with great skill, instantly kill a small pig\r\n     that with half a dozen other small pigs were following their mother\r\n     at full speed away from the neighborhood of this same private.\r\n\r\n     The soldier, who was an Irishman, picked up the pig, and hiding it\r\n     under his army sack, was returning to camp, when, lifting up his\r\n     head, he saw before him the major, who, assuming his most solemn\r\n     look, thus spoke to him:\r\n\r\n     'What have you under your coat, there?'\r\n\r\n     'Shure it's an empty stomach, sirr!--and a small pig that's hurted\r\n     itself--poor little thing!--and I'm taking it home to mend its leg,\r\n     to be sure:--the poor crayture wud be after dying if left all alone\r\n     in the cold, the raw morning.'\r\n\r\n     The major dearly relished the joke, but discipline is discipline,\r\n     and there was but one way to overlook this breach of it: that was\r\n     to punish Paddy by giving him a three-mile walk down the road, and\r\n     over the fields back to camp, before he could bring his pig in.\r\n\r\n     'You say the pig is lame?' asked the officer.\r\n\r\n     'Shure, that's the truth, sirr; and I'm afther belaving it'll niver\r\n     be able to run any more at all, at all: be the same token its\r\n     tail's out of curl entirely; and had'nt I better be afther taking\r\n     it home than letting it die like a haythin in the road here?'\r\n\r\n     'Do you see that old sow down the road there with those other pigs?\r\n     you follow her home at _once_, sir, and leave the lame pig\r\n     _there_!'\r\n\r\n     Saying which, the major continued his ride, and the Irishman duly\r\n     followed the old sow to--a turn in the road, when he 'obeyed\r\n     orders,' and left the lame pig 'at home,' where that night at least\r\n     one mess had roast pig with '_ubi_ beans _ibi patria_,' sauce at\r\n     discretion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nTHE MARINERS OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nON BOARD THE PRINCESS ROYAL\r\n\r\n   Ye Mariners of England,\r\n     That shame your country's fame;\r\n   That peddle chains to bind the slave,\r\n     In the blood-royal name!\r\n   Your glorious standard hide away,\r\n     Hoist slave flags in its place,\r\n   And steal o'er the deep,\r\n     With our Yankee ships in chase:\r\n   And ye peddlers, shun the starry flag,\r\n     While the Yankee cruisers chase.\r\n\r\n   The spirits of your fathers\r\n     Shall start from every wave!\r\n   For the ocean was their field of fame,\r\n     And ye insult their grave.\r\n   Where they like bold men fought and fell,\r\n     Ye take a part that's base,\r\n   And steal o'er the deep\r\n     With our Yankee ships in chase:\r\n   And ye peddlers, shun the starry flag,\r\n     While the Yankee cruisers chase.\r\n\r\n   Britannia needeth cotton,\r\n     And so your honor'll sleep;\r\n   Your market's o'er the mounting wave,\r\n     Your greed of gain lies deep.\r\n   Your sovereign bids you walk upright;--\r\n     Her fair fame you disgrace,\r\n   And steal o'er the deep,\r\n     With our Yankee ships in chase:\r\n   And ye peddlers, shun the starry flag,\r\n     While our Yankee cruisers chase.\r\n\r\n   The meteor flag of England\r\n     Should redder burn for shame,\r\n   When it waves o'er chains for slaves\r\n     In Princess Royal's name.\r\n   Mourn, mourn, ye ocean hucksters!\r\n     Your goods and ships are lost:\r\n   To the shame of your name\r\n     Get you home and count the cost:\r\n   For your Princess Royal's gone for good;\r\n     Get you home and count the cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  The\r\n  Continental Monthly.\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important\r\nposition it has assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the\r\nbrilliant array of political and literary talent of the highest order\r\nwhich supports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the\r\nlatter is abundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection\r\nof its counsels in many important public events, and in the character\r\nand power of those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the\r\nCONTINENTAL was first established, it has during that time\r\nacquired a strength and a political significance elevating it to a\r\nposition far above that previously occupied by any publication of the\r\nkind in America. In proof of which assertion we call attention to the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a\r\nsingle one has had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six\r\nthousand_ copies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among\r\nthe Pines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary\r\npopularity;_ and its conductors are determined that it shall not fall\r\nbehind. Preserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a\r\nthousand journals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its\r\ncircle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle\r\ninvolved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of the\r\ncountry, embracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the\r\ngreat questions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal:\r\nmuch the larger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore,\r\nby tales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be\r\nfound, under its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and\r\npresenting attractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,                    Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,                   Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,                  Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,                Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,            Thirty-six dollars.\r\n                           PAID IN ADVANCE\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, to be paid BY THE\r\nSUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the\r\nPublisher_.\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n  on the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $48 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           48 00\r\n     \"    in two years          48 00\r\n     \"    in three years        48 00\r\n     \"    in four years        236 00\r\n     \"    in five years        224 00\r\n     \"    in six years         212 00\r\n\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $24 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           24 00\r\n     \"    in two years          24 00\r\n     \"    in three years        24 00\r\n     \"    in four years        118 00\r\n     \"    in five years        112 00\r\n     \"    in six years         106 00\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n   Number 16.                  25 Cents.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY.\r\n\r\nDEVOTED TO Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK: JOHN F.
