M. SULLIVAN, ABBEY STREET.\r\n\r\n1868\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle more than a year ago we commenced an undertaking never previously\r\nattempted, yet long called for--the collection and publication, in a\r\ncomplete form and at a low price, of the Speeches of Irish Patriots,\r\nspoken from the dock or the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary success which attended upon our effort was the best\r\nproof that we had correctly appreciated the universal desire of the\r\nIrish people to possess themselves of such a memorial of National\r\nProtest--protest unbroken through generations of martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe work was issued in weekly numbers, and reached a sale previously\r\nunheard of in Irish literature. In a few months the whole issue was\r\nexhausted, and for a long time past the demand for a Second Edition has\r\nbeen pressed upon us from all sides. With that demand we now comply.\r\n\r\nThe present issue of \"Speeches from the Dock\" has been carefully revised\r\nand considerably improved. With it, as Part I. of a series, we have\r\nbound, as its sequels, Parts II. and III.--each Part, however, complete\r\nin itself--bringing the list of convict patriot orators down to the\r\nlatest sentenced in 1868. It may be that even here the sad array is not\r\nto close, and that even yet another sequel may have to be issued, ere\r\nthe National Protest of which these Voices from the Dock are the\r\nutterances, shall be terminated for ever. Even so, our faith will be all\r\nunshaken in the inevitable triumph of the cause for which so many\r\nmartyrs have thus suffered; and we shall still await in Faith and Hope\r\nthe first strains of that Hymn of Deliverance which shall yet resound\r\nthrough the valleys of Emancipated Ireland.\r\n\r\n90 MIDDLE ABBEY STREET,\r\n\r\n_November_, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the lovers of Ireland--to those who sympathize with her sufferings\r\nand resent her wrongs, there can be few things more interesting than the\r\nhistory of the struggles which sprang from devotion to her cause, and\r\nwere consecrated by the blood of her patriots. The efforts of the Irish\r\nrace to burst the fetters that foreign force and native dissensions\r\nimposed on them, and elevate their country from bondage and degradation\r\nto a place amongst free nations, fill a page in the world's history\r\nwhich no lover of freedom can read without emotion, and which must\r\nexcite wonder, admiration, and regret in the mind of every man with whom\r\npatriotism is not a reproach, and who can sympathize with a cause\r\nennobled by fidelity and sacrifice, and sanctified by the blood and\r\ntears of a nation. \"How hands so vile could conquer hearts so brave,\" is\r\nthe question which our National Poet supposes to arise in the mind of\r\nthe stranger, as he looks on the spectacle of Ireland in her decay; but\r\nanother question will suggest itself to those who study the history of\r\nour country: it is, how a feeling so deeply rooted as the love of\r\nindependence is in the hearts of the Irish people--an aspiration so\r\nwarmly and so widely entertained--which has been clung to with so much\r\npersistency--which has survived through centuries of persecution--for\r\nwhich generations have arisen, and fought, and bled, and dashed\r\nthemselves against the power of England with a succession as unbroken as\r\nthat of the waves upon our shores--a cause so universally loved, so\r\ndeeply reverenced, and so unflinchingly supported by a brave and\r\nintrepid race, should never have attained the blessing of success. A\r\nmore signal instance than that which Ireland can supply of the baffling\r\nof a nation's hope, the prolonged frustration of a people's will, is not\r\non record; and few even of those who most condemn the errors and\r\nweakness by which Irishmen themselves have retarded the national object,\r\nwill hesitate to say that they have given to mankind the noblest proof\r\nthey possess of the vitality of the principles of freedom, and the\r\nindestructibility of national sentiment.\r\n\r\nIt is for us, however, Irish of the Irish, that the history of the\r\nstruggle for Ireland's rights possesses most attractions. We live amidst\r\nthe scenes where the battles against the stranger were fought, and where\r\nthe men who waged them lived and died. The bones of the patriots who\r\nlaboured for Ireland, and of those who died for her, repose in the\r\ngraveyards around us; and we have still amongst us the inheritors of\r\ntheir blood, their name, and their spirit. It was to make us free--to\r\nrender independent and prosperous the nation to, which we belong--that\r\nthe pike was lifted and the green flag raised; and it was in furtherance\r\nof this object, on which the hearts of Irishmen are still set, that the\r\nmen whose names shine through the pages on which the story of Ireland's\r\nstruggles for national existence is written, suffered and died. To\r\nfollow out that mournful but absorbing story is not, however, the object\r\naimed at in the following pages. The history of Ireland is no longer a\r\nsealed volume to the people; more than one author has told it truthfully\r\nand well, and the list of books devoted to it is every day receiving\r\nvaluable accessions. Nor has it even been attempted, in this little\r\nwork, though trenching more closely on its subject, to trace the career\r\nand sketch the lives of the men who fill the foremost places in the\r\nranks of Ireland's political martyrs. In the subjoined pages little more\r\nwill be found than a correct report of the addresses delivered, under\r\ncertain peculiar circumstances, by the group of Irishmen whose names are\r\ngiven on the titlepage. A single public utterance from the lips of each\r\nof these gentlemen is all that we have printed, though it would be easy\r\nto supplement them in nearly every case by writings and speeches owning\r\na similar authorship, equally eloquent and equally patriotic. But the\r\nspeeches given here are associated with facts which give them peculiar\r\nvalue and significance, and were spoken under circumstances which lend\r\nto them a solemn interest and impressiveness which could not otherwise\r\nbe obtained. They reach us--these dock speeches, in which nobility of\r\npurpose and chivalrous spirit is expressed--like voices from the tomb,\r\nlike messages from beyond the grave, brimful of lessons of dignity and\r\npatriotism. We can see the men who spoke them standing before the\r\nrepresentatives of the government whose oppression had driven them to\r\nrevolt, when the solemn farce of trying them for a crime which posterity\r\nwill account a virtue had terminated, and when the verdict of \"guilty\"\r\nhad gladdened the hearts of their accusers. The circumstances under\r\nwhich they spoke might well cause a bold man to falter. They were about\r\nparting for ever from all that makes life dear to man; and, for some of\r\nthem, the sentence; which was to cut short the thread of their\r\nexistence, to consign them to a bloody and ignominious death, to leave\r\ntheir bodies mutilated corpses, from which the rights of Christian\r\nburial were to be withheld--which was to assign them the death of a dog,\r\nand to follow them with persecuting hand into the valley of death--was\r\nabout to fall from the lips of the judges whom they addressed. Against\r\nothers a fate less repulsive, perhaps, to the feelings of humanity, but\r\ncertainly not more merciful, and hardly less painful and appalling, was\r\nabout to be decreed. Recent revelations have thrown some light on the\r\nhorrors endured by the Irish political prisoners who languish within the\r\nprison pens of England; but it needs far more than a stray letter, a\r\nhalf-stifled cry from the dungeon depths, to enable the public to\r\nrealize the misery, the wretchedness, and the degradation attached to\r\nthe condition to which England reduces her political convicts. Condemned\r\nto associate with the vilest of the scoundrels bred by the immorality\r\nand godlessness of England--exposed, without possibility of redress, to\r\nthe persecutions of brutal, coarse-minded men, accustomed to deal\r\nonly with ruffians than whom beasts are less ferocious and\r\nunreclaimable--restricted to a course of discipline which blasts the\r\nvigour of the body, and under whose influence reason herself totters\r\nupon her throne--the Irish rebel against whom the doom of penal\r\nservitude has been pronounced is condemned to the most hideous and\r\nagonizing punishments to which men of their class could be exposed. It\r\nwas with such terrors staring them in the face that the men whose words\r\nare recorded in this little work delivered their speeches from the dock.\r\nIt is surely something for us, their countrymen, to boast of, that\r\nneither in their bearing nor in their words was there manifested the\r\nslightest trace of weakness, the faintest exhibition of any feeling\r\nwhich could show that their hearts were accessible to the terror which\r\ntheir situation was so well calculated to inspire. No cheek grew pale,\r\nno eyes lost their light--their tones were unbroken, and their manner\r\nundaunted as ever, as these men uttered the words we purpose recording.\r\nTheir language tells of minds which persecution could not subdue, and\r\nfor which death itself possessed no sting; and the manner in which it\r\nwas expressed showed that, in their case, elevation of sentiment was\r\nallied with unconquerable firmness and resolution. Never were lessons so\r\nnoble more boldly preached. It is in courts of justice, after all,\r\ndeclares a great English authority, that the lessons of morality are\r\nbest taught; and in Ireland the truthfulness of the assertion is\r\nestablished. But it is not from the bench or the jury-box that the words\r\nhave fallen in which the cause of morality and justice has been\r\nvindicated; venality, passion, and prejudice have but too often swayed\r\nthe decisions of both; and it is to the dock we must turn when we seek\r\nfor honour, integrity, and patriotism.\r\n\r\nWe owe it to the men who suffered so unflinchingly in the cause of our\r\ncountry, and who have left us so precious a heritage in the speeches in\r\nwhich they hurled a last defiance at their oppressors, that their names\r\nshould not be forgotten, or the recollection of their acts suffered to\r\ngrow cold. The noblest incentive to patriotism, as it is the highest\r\nreward which this world can offer those who dare and suffer for\r\nfatherland, is the gratitude, the sympathy, and the applause of the\r\npeople for whom they laboured. We owe it to the brave men whose\r\npatriotism is attested in the addresses comprised in this volume, that\r\nthe memory of their noble deeds shall not pass away, and that their\r\nnames shall remain enshrined in the hearts of their countrymen. They\r\nfailed, it is true, to accomplish what they attempted, and the battle to\r\nwhich they devoted themselves has yet to be won; but we know that they,\r\nat least, did their part courageously and well; and, looking back now\r\nupon the stormy scenes of their labours, and contrasting the effects of\r\ntheir sacrifices with the cost at which they were made, the people of\r\nIreland are still prepared to accept the maxim that--\r\n\r\n   \"Tis better to have fought and lost,\r\n   Than never to have fought at all.\"\r\n\r\nWhile such men can be found to suffer as they have suffered for Ireland,\r\nthe ultimate triumph of her aspirations cannot be doubted, nor can the\r\nnational faith be despaired of while it has martyrs so numerous and so\r\nheroic. It is by example that the great lessons of patriotism can best\r\nbe conveyed; and if the national spirit burn brightly to-day in\r\nIreland--if the spirit of her children be still defiant and\r\nunsubdued--if, at home and in the far West, the hearts of the Irish\r\npeople still throb with the emotions that prompted Emmet and Wolfe\r\nTone--if their eyes are still hot to see the independence of their\r\ncountry, their arms still ready to strike, and their spirit ready to\r\nsacrifice for the accomplishment of that object, we owe the result\r\nlargely to the men whose names are inscribed in this little work, and\r\nwhose memory it is intended to perpetuate.\r\n\r\nWe have commenced our series with the speech of Theobald Wolfe Tone, and\r\nour record stretches no further back than the memorable insurrection of\r\n1798. If our object were to group together the Irishmen who are known\r\nto have struggled for the independence of their country, and who\r\nsuffered for their attachment to her cause, we might go much farther\r\nback into history, and indefinitely increase the bulk of this\r\npublication. We fix the insurrection of '98 as the limit of our\r\ncollection, chiefly because it was at that time trials for high treason\r\nin Ireland assumed the precise meaning and significance which they now\r\npossess, and there is consequently, in the speeches which follow, such a\r\nunity of purpose and sentiment as renders them especially suitable for\r\npresentation in a single volume. Only seventy years have elapsed since\r\nWolfe Tone spoke to the question why sentence should not be pronounced\r\non him--only two-thirds of a century since Emmet vindicated the cause of\r\nhis country from the Green street dock, and already what a host of\r\nimitators and disciples have they had! There is not a country in Europe,\r\nthere is not a nationality in the world, can produce such another\r\ncollection as that which we to-day lay before the people of Ireland. We\r\nlive under a government which claims to be just, liberal, and\r\nconstitutional, yet against no other government in Christendom have the\r\nsame number of protests been made within the same space of time. Not\r\nPoland, not Hungary, not Venetia, can point to such an unbroken\r\nsuccession of political martyrs. The pages of history contain nothing to\r\ncompare with the little volume we to-day place in the hands of our\r\ncountrymen; and we know of no more powerful and eloquent condemnation of\r\nthe system on which Ireland is governed, than that contained in the\r\nsimple fact that all those speeches were spoken, all those trials\r\ncarried-out, all those sentences decreed, within the lifetime of a\r\nsingle generation. It is idle to think of subduing a people who make so\r\nmany sacrifices, and who are undaunted still; it is vain to think of\r\ncrushing a spirit which survives so much persecution. The executioner\r\nand the gaoler, the gibbet, the block, and the dungeon, have done their\r\nwork in the crusade against Irish Nationality, and we know what the\r\nresult is to-day. The words of the last political convict whose name\r\nappears in these pages are as uncompromising and as bold as those of the\r\nfirst of his predecessors; and, studying the spirit which they have\r\nexhibited, and marking the effect of their conduct on the bulk of their\r\ncountrymen, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion, that so much\r\npersistent resolution and heroism must one day eventuate in success, and\r\nthat Ireland, the country for which so many brave men have suffered with\r\nsuch unfaltering courage, is not destined to disprove the rule that--\r\n\r\n   \"Freedom's battle once begun,--\r\n   Bequeath'd from bleeding sire to son--\r\n   Though baffled oft, is ever won.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEOBALD WOLFE TONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo name is more intimately associated with the national movement of 1798\r\nthan that of Theobald Wolfe Tone. He was its main-spring, its leading\r\nspirit. Many men connected with it possessed, as he did, brilliant\r\ntalents, unfailing courage and determination, and an intense devotion to\r\nthe cause; but the order of his genius raised him above them all, and\r\nmarked him out from the first as the head and front of the patriot\r\nparty. He was one of the original founders of the Society of United\r\nIrishmen, which was formed in Belfast in the year 1791. In its early\r\ndays this society was simply a sort of reform association, a legal and\r\nconstitutional body, having for its chief object the removal of the\r\nfrightful oppressions by which the Catholic people of Ireland were\r\ntortured and disgraced; but in the troubled and portentous condition of\r\nhome and foreign politics, the society could not long retain this\r\ncharacter. The futility of seeking a redress of the national grievances\r\nby parliamentary means was becoming apparent to every understanding. The\r\nsystem of outrage and injustice towards the Catholics, unabating in its\r\nseverity, continued to exasperate the actual sufferers and to offend all\r\nmen of humane feelings and enlightened principles; and, at the same\r\ntime, the electric influence of the American War of Independence and the\r\nFrench Revolution was operating powerfully in every heart, evoking there\r\nthe aspiration for Irish freedom, and inspiring a belief in its possible\r\nattainment. In the midst of such exciting circumstances the society\r\ncould not continue to stand on its original basis. In the year 1794,\r\nafter a debate among the members, followed by the withdrawal of the more\r\nmoderate or timid among them from its ranks, it assumed the form and\r\ncharacter of a secret revolutionary organization; and Tone, Thomas Addis\r\nEmmet, Samuel Neilson, Thomas Russell, James Napper Tandy, with a number\r\nof other patriotic gentlemen in Belfast, Dublin, and other parts\r\nof the country, soon found themselves in the full swing of an\r\ninsurrectionary movement, plotting and planning for the complete\r\noverthrow of British power in Ireland. Thenceforward, for some time, the\r\norganization went on rapidly extending through the province of Ulster,\r\nin the first instance, and subsequently over most of the midland and\r\nsouthern counties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEOBALD WOLFE TONE. _From a Portrait by his\r\nDaughter-in-law, Mrs. Sampson Tone._]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when, in the early part of 1794, an\r\nemissary from the French government arrived in Ireland, to ascertain to\r\nwhat extent the Irish people were likely to co-operate with France in a\r\nwar against England. This individual was the Rev. William Jackson, an\r\nIrish Protestant clergyman, who had for some years been resident in\r\nFrance, and had become thoroughly imbued with Democratic and Republican\r\nprinciples. Unfortunately, he was not one of the most prudent of envoys.\r\nHe revealed his mission to an acquaintance of his, an English attorney,\r\nnamed Cockayne, who repaid his confidence by betraying his secrets to\r\nthe government. Cockayne was immediately employed as a spy upon\r\nJackson's further proceedings, in which capacity he accompanied his\r\nunsuspecting victim to Ireland, and acquired cognizance of most of his\r\nnegotiations. On the 28th of April; 1794, Jackson was arrested on a\r\ncharge of high treason. He was brought to speedy trial, was found\r\nguilty, but was not sentenced, for, on the day on which the law's award\r\nwas to have been announced to him, he contrived, before entering the\r\ncourt, to swallow a dose of poison, from the effects of which he expired\r\nin the dock. Tone, with whom Jackson was known to have been in\r\nconfidential communication, was placed by those events in a very\r\ncritical position; owing, however, to some influence which had been made\r\nwith the government on his behalf, he was permitted to exile himself to\r\nAmerica. As he had entered into no engagement with the government\r\nregarding his future line of conduct, he made his expatriation the means\r\nof forwarding, in the most effective manner, the designs he had at\r\nheart. He left Dublin for Philadelphia on the 20th of May, 1795. One of\r\nhis first acts, after arriving, was to present to the French Minister\r\nthere resident a memorial on the state of Ireland. During the remaining\r\nmonths of the year letters from his old friends came pouring in on him,\r\ndescribing the brightening prospects of the cause at home, and urging\r\nhim to proceed to the French capital and impress upon the Directory the\r\npolicy of despatching at once an expedition to ensure the success of the\r\nIrish revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nTone was not the man to disregard such representations. He had at the\r\ntime a fair prospect of securing a comfortable independence in America,\r\nbut with the full concurrence of his heroic wife, who had accompanied\r\nhim across the Atlantic, he sacrificed those chances and resumed the\r\nperilous duties of an Irish patriot. On the 1st of January, 1796, he\r\nleft New York for Paris to try what he could do as a diplomatist for the\r\ncause of Ireland. Arrived at the French capital, he had his business\r\ncommunicated to the Directory through the medium of an Irish gentleman,\r\nnamed Madgett, and also by memorial, representing always that the\r\nlanding of a force of 20,000 men in Ireland, with a supply of arms for\r\nthe peasantry, would ensure the separation of Ireland from England. Not\r\nsatisfied with the slow progress he was thus achieving, he went on the\r\n24th of February direct to the Luxemburg Palace, and sought and obtained\r\nan interview with the War Minister, the celebrated Carnot, the\r\n\"organizer of victory.\" The Minister received him well, listened\r\nattentively to his statements, discussed his project with him, and\r\nappeared much impressed with the prospects it presented. The result was\r\nthat on the 16th of December in the same year, a splendid expedition\r\nsailed from Brest for Ireland. It consisted of seventeen sail of the\r\nline, thirteen frigates and fifteen transports, with some smaller craft,\r\nand had on board 15,000 troops, with a large supply of arms for the\r\nIrish patriots. Tone himself, who had received the rank of\r\nAdjutant-General in the French service, was on board one of the vessels.\r\nHad this force been disembarked on the shores of Ireland, it is hardly\r\npossible to doubt that the separation of this country from England would\r\nhave been effected. But the expedition was unfortunate from the outset.\r\nIt was scattered on the voyage during a gale of wind, and the Admiral's\r\nvessel, with Hoche, the Commander, on board, was separated from the\r\nothers. A portion of the expedition entered the magnificent Bay of\r\nBantry and waited there several days in expectation of being rejoined by\r\nthe vessel containing the Admiral and Commander; but they waited in\r\nvain. Tone vehemently urged that a landing should be effected with the\r\nforces then at hand--some 6,500 men--but the officers procrastinated,\r\ntime was lost, the wind which had been blowing from the east (that is\r\nout the harbour) rose to a perfect hurricane, and on the 27th and 28th\r\nof the month the vessels cut their cables and made the best of their way\r\nfor France.\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible blow to the hopes of the Irish organizer. Rage and\r\nsadness filled his heart by turns as the fierce storm blew his vessel\r\nout of the bay and across the sea to the land which he had left under\r\nsuch favourable auspices. But yet he did not resign himself to despair.\r\nAs the patient spider renews her web again and again after it has been\r\ntorn asunder, so did this indefatigable patriot set to work to repair\r\nthe misfortune that had occurred, and to build up another project of\r\nassistance for his unfortunate country. His perseverance was not\r\nunproductive of results. The Batavian or Dutch Republic, then in\r\nalliance with France, took up the project that had failed in the Bay of\r\nBantry. In the month of July, 1797, they had assembled in the Texel an\r\nexpedition for the invasion of Ireland, nearly, if not quite, as\r\nformidable in men and ships as that which had left Brest in the previous\r\nyear. Tone was on board the flag ship, even more joyous and hopeful than\r\nhe had been on the preceding occasion. But again, as if by some\r\nextraordinary fatality, the weather interposed an obstacle to the\r\nrealization of the design. The vessels were ready for sea, the troops\r\nwere on board, nothing was wanted but a slant of wind to enable the\r\nfleet to get out. But for five weeks it continued to blow steadily in\r\nthe adverse direction. The supplies ran low; the patience of the\r\nofficers, and of the government, became exhausted--the troops were\r\ndisembarked and the project abandoned! The second failure in a matter\r\nof such weight and importance was a heavy blow to the heart of the brave\r\nTone. Elaborate and costly efforts like those which had ended so poorly,\r\nhe felt could not often be repeated; the drift of the war was cutting\r\nout other work for the fleets and armies of France and her allies, and\r\nthe unwelcome conviction began to settle darkly on his mind that never\r\nagain would he see such a vision of hope for dear Ireland as that which\r\nhad shone before him on those two occasions, and vanished in doubt and\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nYet there was no need to despair. Assurances reached Tone every day that\r\nthe defeat and humiliation of England was a settled resolve of the\r\nFrench Government, one which they would never abandon. And for a time\r\neverything seemed to favour the notion that a direct stroke at the heart\r\nof England was intended. In the latter part of 1797 the Directory\r\nordered the formation of \"The Army of England,\" the command of which was\r\ngiven to General Buonaparte. Tone's heart again beat high with hope, for\r\nnow matters looked more promising than ever. He was in constant\r\ncommunication with some of the chief officers of the expedition, and in\r\nthe month of December he had several interviews with Buonaparte himself,\r\nwhich however he could hardly consider of a satisfactory nature. On the\r\n20th of May, 1798, General Buonaparte embarked on board the fleet at\r\nToulon and sailed off--not for Ireland or England, but for Egypt.\r\n\r\nOn the Irish leaders at home these repeated disappointments fell with\r\nterrible effect. The condition of the country was daily growing more\r\ncritical. The government, now thoroughly roused and alarmed, and\r\npersuaded that the time for \"vigorous measures\" had arrived, was\r\ngrappling with the conspiracy in all directions. Still those men would,\r\nif they could, have got the people to possess their souls in patience\r\nand wait for aid from abroad before unfurling the banner of\r\ninsurrection; for they were constant in their belief that without the\r\npresence of a disciplined army on Irish soil to consolidate their\r\nstrength and direct it, a revolutionary effort of the Irish people\r\ncould end only in disaster. But the government had reasons of their own\r\nfor wishing to set an Irish rebellion afoot at this time, and they took\r\nmeasures to precipitate the rising. The arrest of the delegates at the\r\nhouse of Oliver Bond in Dublin, and the capture of Lord Edward\r\nFitzgerald contributed to this end; but these things the country might\r\nhave peacably endured if no more dreadful trial had been put upon it.\r\nWhat could not be endured was the system of riot and outrage, and\r\nmurder, to which the unfortunate peasantry were then given over. Words\r\nfail to describe its cruelty and its horrors. It was too much for human\r\nnature to bear. On the 23rd of May, three days after Buonaparte had\r\nsailed from Toulon for Alexandria, the Irish insurrection broke out. The\r\nnews of the occurrence created the most intense excitement among the\r\nIrish refugees then in Paris. Tone rushed to and fro to the Directory\r\nand to the generals, pleading for the despatch of some assistance to his\r\nstruggling countrymen. Various plans were suggested and taken into\r\nconsideration, but while time was being wasted in this way, the military\r\nforces of the British Government were rapidly suppressing the\r\ninsurrection of the unarmed and undisciplined Irish peasantry. In this\r\ncondition of affairs a gallant but rash and indiscreet French officer,\r\nGeneral Humbert, resolved that he would commit the Directory to action,\r\nby starting at once with a small force for the coast of Ireland. Towards\r\nthe middle of August, calling together the merchants and magistrates of\r\nRochelle, \"he forced them to advance a small sum of money, and all that\r\nhe wanted, on military requisition; and embarking on board a few\r\nfrigates and transports with 1,000 men, 1,000 spare muskets, 1,000\r\nguineas, and a few pieces of artillery, he compelled the captains to set\r\nsail for the most desperate attempt which is, perhaps, recorded in\r\nhistory.\" Three Irishmen were on board the fleet--Matthew Tone, brother\r\nto Theobald, Bartholomew Teeling, and Sullivan, an officer in the French\r\nservice, who was enthusiastically devoted to the Irish cause, and had\r\nrendered much aid to his patriotic countrymen in France. Humbert landed\r\nat Killala, routed with his little handful of men a large force of the\r\nroyal troops, and held his ground until General Lake, with 20,000 men\r\nmarched against him. After a resistance sufficient to maintain the\r\nhonour of the French arms, Humbert's little force surrendered as\r\nprisoners of war. The Irish who had joined his standard were shown no\r\nmercy. The peasantry were cruelly butchered. Of those who had\r\naccompanied him from France, Sullivan, who was able to pass as a\r\nFrenchman, escaped; Teeling and Matthew Tone were brought in irons to\r\nDublin, tried, and executed. The news of Humbert's expedition and the\r\ntemporary success that had attended it created much excitement in\r\nFrance, and stirred up the Directory to attempt something for Ireland\r\nmore worthy of the fame and power of the French nation, and more in\r\nkeeping with their repeated promises to the leaders of the Irish\r\nmovement. But their fleet was at the time greatly reduced, and their\r\nresources were in a state of disorganization. They mustered for the\r\nexpedition only one sail of the line and eight small frigates, commanded\r\nby Commodore Bompart, conveying 5,000 men under the leadership of\r\nGeneral Hardy. On board the Admiral's vessel, which was named the Hoche,\r\nwas the heroic Theobald Wolfe Tone. He knew this expedition had no\r\nchance of success, but he had all along declared, \"that if the\r\ngovernment sent only a corporal's guard, he felt it his duty to go along\r\nwith them.\" The vessels sailed on the 20th of September, 1798;\r\nit was not till the 11th October that they arrived off Lough\r\nSwilly--simultaneously with an English squadron that had been on the\r\nlook out for them. The English ships were about equal in number to the\r\nFrench, but were of a larger class, and carried a much heavier armament.\r\nThe French Admiral directed some of his smaller craft to endeavour to\r\nescape by means of their light draught of water, and he counselled Tone\r\nto transfer himself to that one of them which had the best chance of\r\ngetting away. The Frenchmen, he observed, would be made prisoners of\r\nwar, but for the Irish rebel a worse fate was reserved if he should fall\r\ninto the hand of his enemies. But to this suggestion the noble-hearted\r\nTone declined to accede. \"Shall it be said,\" he replied, \"that I fled\r\nwhile the French were fighting the battles of my country.\" In a little\r\ntime the Hoche was surrounded by four sail of the line and one frigate,\r\nwho poured their shot into her upon all sides. During six hours she\r\nmaintained the unequal combat, fighting \"till her masts and rigging were\r\ncut away, her scuppers flowed with blood, her wounded filled the\r\ncockpit, her shattered ribs yawned at each new stroke, and let in five\r\nfeet of water in the hold, her rudder was carried off, and she floated a\r\ndismantled wreck on the water; her sails and cordage hung in shreds, nor\r\ncould she reply with a single gun from her dismounted batteries to the\r\nunabating cannonade of the enemy.\" During the action Tone commanded one\r\nof the batteries \"and fought with the utmost desperation, as if he was\r\ncourting death.\" But, as often has happened in similiar cases, death\r\nseemed to shun him, and he was reserved for a more tragic fate.\r\n\r\nThe French officers who survived the action, and had been made prisoners\r\nof war, were, some days subsequently, invited to breakfast with the Earl\r\nof Cavan, who commanded in the district in which they had been landed.\r\nTone, who up to that time, had escaped recognition, was one of the\r\nparty, and sat undistinguished among them, until Sir George Hill, who\r\nhad been a fellow-student of his in Trinity College, entered the room\r\nand accosted him by his name. This was done, not inadvertently, but with\r\nthe intention of betraying him. In a moment he was in the hands of a\r\nparty of military and police who were in waiting for him in the next\r\nroom. Seeing that they were about to put him in fetters, he complained\r\nindignantly of the offering of such an insult to the uniform which he\r\nwore, and the rank--that of Chef de Brigade--which he bore in the French\r\narmy. He cast off his regimentals, protesting that they should not be so\r\nsullied, and then, offering his limbs to the irons, exclaimed--\"For the\r\ncause which I have embraced, I feel prouder to wear these chains, than\r\nif I were decorated with the Star and Garter of England.\" He was hurried\r\noff to Dublin, and though the ordinary tribunals were sitting at the\r\ntime, and the military tribunals could have no claim on him, as he had\r\nnever belonged to the English army, he was put on his trial before a\r\ncourt-martial. This was absolutely an illegal proceeding, but his\r\nenemies were impatient for his blood, and would not brook the chances\r\nand the delays of the ordinary procedure of law. On the 10th of\r\nNovember, 1798, his trial, if such it might be called, took place in one\r\nof the Dublin barracks. He appeared before the Court \"dressed,\" says the\r\n_Dublin Magazine_ for November, 1798, \"in the French uniform: a large\r\ncocked hat, with broad gold lace and the tri-coloured cockade; a blue\r\nuniform coat, with gold-embroidered collar and two large gold epaulets;\r\nblue pantaloons, with gold-laced garters at the knees; and short boots,\r\nbound at the tops with gold lace.\" In his bearing there was no trace of\r\nexcitement. \"The firmness and cool serenity of his whole deportment,\"\r\nwrites his son, \"gave to the awestruck assembly the measure of his\r\nsoul,\" The proceedings of the Court are detailed in the following\r\nreport, which we copy from the \"Life of Tone,\" by his son, published at\r\nWashington, U.S., in 1826:--\r\n\r\n   The members of the Court having been sworn, the Judge Advocate called\r\n   on the prisoner to plead guilty or not guilty to the charge of having\r\n   acted traitorously and hostilely against the King. Tone replied:--\r\n\r\n   \"I mean not to give the court any useless trouble, and wish to spare\r\n   them the idle task of examining witnesses. I admit all the facts\r\n   alleged, and only request leave to read an address which I have\r\n   prepared for this occasion.\"\r\n\r\n   Colonel DALY--\"I must warn the prisoner that, in acknowledging those\r\n   _facts_, he admits, to his prejudice, that he has acted\r\n   _traitorously_ against his Majesty. Is such his intention?\"\r\n\r\n   TONE--\"Stripping this charge of the technicality of its terms, it\r\n   means, I presume, by the word traitorously, that I have been found in\r\n   arms against the soldiers of the King in my native country. I admit\r\n   this accusation in its most extended sense, and request again to\r\n   explain to the court the reasons and motives of my conduct.\"\r\n\r\n   The court then observed they would hear his address, provided he kept\r\n   himself within the bounds of moderation.\r\n\r\n   Tone rose, and began in these words--\"Mr. President and Gentlemen of\r\n   the Court-Martial, I mean not to give you the trouble of bringing\r\n   judicial proof to convict me legally of having acted in hostility to\r\n   the government of his Britannic Majesty in Ireland. I admit the fact.\r\n   From my earliest youth I have regarded the connection between Great\r\n   Britain and Ireland as the curse of the Irish nation, and felt\r\n   convinced that, whilst it lasted, this country could never be free\r\n   nor happy. My mind has been confirmed in this opinion by the\r\n   experience of every succeeding year, and the conclusions which I have\r\n   drawn from every fact before my eyes. In consequence, I was\r\n   determined to employ all the powers which my individual efforts could\r\n   move, in order to separate the two countries. That Ireland was not\r\n   able of herself to throw off the yoke, I knew; I therefore sought for\r\n   aid wherever it was to be found. In honourable poverty I rejected\r\n   offers which, to a man in my circumstances, might be considered\r\n   highly advantageous. I remained faithful to what I thought the cause\r\n   of my country, and sought in the French Republic an ally to rescue\r\n   three millions of my countrymen from--\"\r\n\r\n   The President here interrupted the prisoner, observing that this\r\n   language was neither relevant to the charge, nor such as ought to be\r\n   delivered in a public court.\r\n\r\n   A Member said it seemed calculated only to inflame the minds of a\r\n   certain description of people (the United Irishmen), many of whom\r\n   might be present, and that the court could not suffer it.\r\n\r\n   The JUDGE ADVOCATE said--\"If Mr. Tone meant this paper to be laid\r\n   before his Excellency in way of _extenuation_, it must have quite a\r\n   contrary effect, if the foregoing part was suffered to remain.\" The\r\n   President wound up by calling on the prisoner to hesitate before\r\n   proceeding further in the same strain.\r\n\r\n   TONE then continued--\"I believe there is nothing in what remains for\r\n   me to say which can give any offence; I mean to express my feelings\r\n   and gratitude towards the Catholic body, in whose cause I was\r\n   engaged.\"\r\n\r\n   PRESIDENT--\"That seems to have nothing to say to the charge against\r\n   you, to which you are only to speak. If you have anything to offer in\r\n   defence or extenuation of the charge, the court will hear you, but\r\n   they beg you will confine yourself to that subject.\"\r\n\r\n   TONE--\"I shall, then, confine myself to some points relative to my\r\n   connection with the French army. Attached to no party in the French\r\n   Republic--without interest, without money, without intrigue--the\r\n   openness and integrity of my views raised me to a high and\r\n   confidential rank in its armies. I obtained the confidence of the\r\n   Executive Directory, the approbation of my generals, and I will\r\n   venture to add, the esteem and affection of my brave comrades. When I\r\n   review these circumstances, I feel a secret and internal consolation\r\n   which no reverse of fortune, no sentence in the power of this court\r\n   to inflict, can deprive me of, or weaken in any degree. Under the\r\n   flag of the French Republic I originally engaged with a view to save\r\n   and liberate my own country. For that purpose I have encountered the\r\n   chances of war amongst strangers; for that purpose I repeatedly\r\n   braved the terrors of the ocean, covered, as I knew it to be, with\r\n   the triumphant fleets of that power which it was my glory and my\r\n   duty to oppose. I have sacrificed all my views in life; I have\r\n   courted poverty; I have left a beloved wife unprotected, and children\r\n   whom I adored fatherless. After such a sacrifice, in a cause which I\r\n   have always considered--conscientiously considered--as the cause of\r\n   justice and freedom, it is no great effort, at this day, to add the\r\n   sacrifice of my life. But I hear it said that this unfortunate\r\n   country has been a prey to all sorts of horrors. I sincerely lament\r\n   it. I beg, however, it may be remembered that I have been absent four\r\n   years from Ireland. To me these sufferings can never be attributed. I\r\n   designed by fair and open war to procure the separation of the two\r\n   countries. For open war I was prepared, but instead of that a system\r\n   of private assassination has taken place. I repeat, whilst I deplore\r\n   it, that it is not chargeable on me. Atrocities, it seems, have been\r\n   committed on both sides. I do not less deplore them. I detest them\r\n   from my heart; and to those who know my character and sentiments I\r\n   may safely appeal for the truth of this assertion; with them I need\r\n   no justification. In a case like this success is everything. Success,\r\n   in the eyes of the vulgar, fixes its merits. Washington succeeded,\r\n   and Kosciusko failed. After a combat nobly sustained--combat which\r\n   would have excited the respect and sympathy of a generous enemy--my\r\n   fate has been to become a prisoner, to the eternal disgrace of those\r\n   who gave the orders. I was brought here in irons like a felon. I\r\n   mention this for the sake of others; for me, I am indifferent to it.\r\n   I am aware of the fate which awaits me, and scorn equally the tone of\r\n   complaint and that of supplication. As to the connection between this\r\n   country and Great Britain, I repeat it--all that has been imputed to\r\n   me (words, writings, and actions), I here deliberately avow. I have\r\n   spoken and acted with reflection and on principle, and am ready to\r\n   meet the consequences. Whatever be the sentence of the court, I am\r\n   prepared for it. Its members will surely discharge their duty--I\r\n   shall take care not to be wanting in mine.\"\r\n\r\n   The court having asked if he wished to make any further observation,\r\n\r\n   TONE said--\"I wish to offer a few words relative to one single\r\n   point--the mode of punishment. In France our _emigrees_, who stand\r\n   nearly in the same situation in which I now stand before you, are\r\n   condemned to be shot. I ask that the court shall adjudge me the death\r\n   of a soldier, and let me be shot by a platoon of grenadiers. I\r\n   request this indulgence rather in consideration of the uniform I\r\n   wear--the uniform of a Chef de Brigade in the French army--than from\r\n   any personal regard to myself. In order to evince my claim to this\r\n   favour, I beg that the court may take the trouble to peruse my\r\n   commission and letters of service in the French army. It will appear\r\n   from these papers that I have not received them as a mask to cover\r\n   me, but that I have been long and _bona fide_ an officer in the\r\n   French service.\"\r\n\r\n   JUDGE ADVOCATE--\"You must feel that the papers you allude to will\r\n   serve as undeniable proof against you.\"\r\n\r\n   TONE--\"Oh, I know they will. I have already admitted the facts, and\r\n   I now admit the papers as full proof of conviction.\"\r\n\r\n   [The papers were then examined; they consisted of a brevet of Chef de\r\n   Brigade from the Directory, signed by the Minister of War, of a\r\n   letter of service granting to him the rank of Adjutant-General, and\r\n   of a passport.]\r\n\r\n   General LOFTUS--\"In these papers you are designated as serving in the\r\n   army of England.\"\r\n\r\n   TONE--\"I did serve in that army, when it was commanded by Buonaparte,\r\n   by Dessaix, and by Kilmaine, who is, as I am, an Irishman; but I have\r\n   also served elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n   The Court requested if he had anything further to observe.\r\n\r\n   He said that nothing more occurred to him, except that the sooner his\r\n   Excellency's approbation of the sentence was obtained the better.\r\n\r\nThis is Tone's speech, as reported in the public prints at that time,\r\nbut the recently-published \"Correspondence\" of Lord Cornwallis--Lord\r\nLieutenant in those days--supplies a portion of the address which was\r\nnever before published, the Court having forbade the reading of it at\r\nthe trial. The passage contains a noble outburst of gratitude towards\r\nthe Catholics of Ireland. Tone himself, as every reader is aware, was a\r\nProtestant, and there can have been no reason for its suppression except\r\nthe consideration that it was calculated to still more endear the\r\nprisoner to the hearts of his countrymen. We now reprint it, and thus\r\nplace it for the first time before the people for whom it was written:--\r\n\r\n   \"I have laboured to create a people in Ireland by raising three\r\n   millions of my countrymen to the rank of citizens. I have laboured to\r\n   abolish the infernal spirit of religious persecution, by uniting the\r\n   Catholics and Dissenters. To the former I owe more than ever can be\r\n   repaid. The services I was so fortunate as to render them they\r\n   rewarded munificently; but they did more: when the public cry was\r\n   raised against me--when the friends of my youth swarmed off and left\r\n   me alone--the Catholics did not desert me; they had the virtue even\r\n   to sacrifice their own interests to a rigid principle of honour; they\r\n   refused, though strongly urged, to disgrace a man who, whatever his\r\n   conduct towards the government might have been, had faithfully and\r\n   conscientiously discharged his duty towards them; and in so doing,\r\n   though it was in my own case, I will say they showed an instance of\r\n   public, virtue of which I know not whether there exists another\r\n   example.\"\r\n\r\nThe sad sequel of those proceedings is soon told. The request of the\r\nprisoner to receive a military execution was refused by the Viceroy,\r\nLord Cornwallis, and Tone was sentenced to die \"the death of a traitor\"\r\nwithin forty-eight hours from the time of his conviction. But\r\nhe--influenced, it must be confessed, by a totally mistaken feeling of\r\npride, and yielding to a weakness which every Christian heart should be\r\nable to conquer--resolved that, rather than allow his enemies to have\r\nthe satisfaction of dangling his body from a gibbet, he would become his\r\nown executioner. On the night of the 11th of November he contrived,\r\nwhile lying unobserved in his cell, to open a vein in his neck with a\r\npenknife. No intelligence of this fact had reached the public when, on\r\nthe morning of the 12th, the intrepid and eloquent advocate, John\r\nPhilpot Curran, made a motion in the Court of King's Bench for a writ of\r\n_Habeas Corpus_, to withdraw the prisoner from the custody of the\r\nmilitary authorities, and transfer him to the charge of the civil power.\r\nThe motion was granted immediately, Mr. Curran pleading that, if delay\r\nwere made, the prisoner might be executed before the order of the Court\r\ncould be presented. A messenger was at once despatched from the court to\r\nthe barrack with the writ. He returned to say that the officers in\r\ncharge of the prisoner would obey only their military superiors. The\r\nChief Justice issued his commands peremptorily:--\"Mr. Sheriff, take the\r\nbody of Tone into custody--take the Provost Marshal and Major Sandys\r\ninto custody,--and show the order of the Court to General Craig.\" The\r\nSheriff sped away, and soon returned with the news that Tone had wounded\r\nhimself on the previous evening, and could not be removed. The Chief\r\nJustice then ordered a rule suspending the execution. For the space of\r\nseven days afterwards did the unfortunate gentleman endure the agonies\r\nof approaching death; on the 19th of November, 1798, he expired. No more\r\ntouching reference to his last moments could be given than the following\r\npathetic and noble words traced by a filial hand, and published in the\r\nmemoir from which we have already quoted:--\"Stretched on his bloody\r\npallet in a dungeon, the first apostle of Irish union and most\r\nillustrious martyr of Irish independence counted each lingering hour\r\nduring the last seven days and nights of his slow and silent agony. No\r\none was allowed to approach him. Far from his adored family, and from\r\nall those friends whom he loved so dearly, the only forms which flitted\r\nbefore his eyes were those of the grim jailor and his rough\r\nattendants--the only sounds which fell on his dying ear the heavy tread\r\nof the sentry. He retained, however, the calmness of his soul and the\r\npossession of his faculties to the last. And the consciousness of dying\r\nfor his country, and in the cause of justice and liberty, illumined like\r\na bright halo his later moments and kept up his fortitude to the end.\r\nThere is no situation under which those feelings will not support the\r\nsoul of a patriot.\"\r\n\r\nTone was born in Stafford-street, Dublin, on the 20th of June, 1764. His\r\nfather was a coachmaker who carried on a thriving business; his\r\ngrandfather was a comfortable farmer who held land near Naas, county\r\nKildare. In February, 1781, Tone entered Trinity College, Dublin; in\r\nJanuary, 1787, he entered his name as a law student on the books of the\r\nMiddle Temple, London, and in 1789 he was called to the bar. His mortal\r\nremains repose in Bodenstown churchyard, county Kildare, whither parties\r\nof patriotic young men from the metropolis and the surrounding districts\r\noften proceed to lay a green wreath on his grave. His spirit lives, and\r\nwill live for ever, in the hearts of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ORR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve months before Wolfe Tone expired in his prison cell, one of the\r\nbravest of his associates paid with his life the penalty of his\r\nattachment to the cause of Irish independence. In the subject of this\r\nsketch, the United Irishmen found their first martyr; and time has left\r\nno darker blot on the administration of English rule than the execution\r\nof the high-spirited Irishman whose body swung from the gallows of\r\nCarrickfergus on the 14th of October, 1797.\r\n\r\nWilliam Orr was the son of a farmer and bleach-green proprietor, of\r\nFerranshane, in the county of Antrim. The family were in comfortable\r\ncircumstances, and young Orr received a good education, which he\r\nafterwards turned to account in the service of his country. We know\r\nlittle of his early history, but we find him, on growing up to manhood,\r\nan active member of the society of United Irishmen, and remarkable for\r\nhis popularity amongst his countrymen in the north. His appearance, not\r\nless than his principles and declarations, was calculated to captivate\r\nthe peasantry amongst whom he lived; he stood six feet two inches in\r\nheight, was a perfect model of symmetry, strength, and gracefulness, and\r\nthe expression of his countenance was open, frank, and manly. He was\r\nalways neatly and respectably dressed--a prominent feature in his attire\r\nbeing a green necktie, which he wore even in his last confinement.\r\n\r\nOne of, the first blows aimed by the government against the United\r\nIrishmen was the passing of the Act of Parliament (36 George III.),\r\nwhich constituted the administration of their oath a capital felony.\r\nThis piece of legislation, repugnant in itself to the dictates of reason\r\nand justice, was intended as no idle threat; a victim was looked for to\r\nsuffer under its provisions, and William Orr, the champion of the\r\nnorthern Presbyterian patriots, was doomed to serve the emergency.\r\n\r\nHe was arraigned, tried, and convicted at Carrickfergus on a charge of\r\nhaving administered the United Irishman's oath to a soldier named\r\nWheatly. The whole history of the operations of the British law courts\r\nin Ireland contains nothing more infamous than the record of that trial.\r\nWe now know, as a matter of fact, that the man who tendered the oath to\r\nWheatly was William M'Keever, a well-known member of the society, who\r\nsubsequently made his escape to America. But this was not a case, such\r\nas sometimes happens, of circumstantial evidence pointing to a wrong\r\nconclusion. The only evidence against Orr was the unsupported testimony\r\nof the soldier Wheatly; and after hearing Curran's defence of the\r\nprisoner there could be no possible doubt of his innocence. But Orr was\r\na doomed man--the government had decreed his death before hand; and in\r\nthis case, as in every other, the bloodthirsty agents of the crown did\r\nnot look in vain for Irishmen to co-operate with them in their infamy.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock in the evening the jury retired to consider their\r\nverdict. The scene that followed in the jury room is described in the\r\nsworn affidavits of some of its participators. The jury were supplied\r\nwith supper by the crown officials; a liberal supply of intoxicating\r\nbeverages, wines, brandy, &c., being included in the refreshments. In\r\ntheir sober state several of the jury-men--amongst them Alexander\r\nThompson, of Cushendall, the foreman--had refused to agree to a verdict\r\nof guilty. It was otherwise, however, when the decanters had been\r\nemptied, and when threats of violence were added to the bewildering\r\neffects of the potations in which they indulged. Thompson was threatened\r\nby his more unscrupulous companions with being wrecked, beaten, and \"not\r\nleft with sixpence in the world,\" and similar means were used against\r\nthe few who refused with him to return a verdict of guilty. At six in\r\nthe morning, the jury, not a man of whom by this time was sober,\r\nreturned into court with a verdict of guilty, recommending the prisoner\r\nat the same time in the strongest manner to mercy. Next day Orr was\r\nplaced at the bar, and sentenced to death by Lord Yelverton, who, it is\r\nrecorded, at the conclusion of his address burst into tears. A motion\r\nwas made, by Curran in arrest of judgment, chiefly on the grounds of the\r\ndrunkenness of the jury but the judges refused to entertain the\r\nobjection. The following is the speech delivered by William Orr after\r\nthe verdict of the jury had been announced:--\r\n\r\n   \"My friends and fellow-countrymen--In the thirty-first year of my\r\n   life I have been sentenced to die upon the gallows, and this sentence\r\n   has been in pursuance of a verdict of twelve men, who should have\r\n   been indifferently and impartially chosen. How far they have been so,\r\n   I leave to that country from which they have been chosen to\r\n   determine; and how far they have discharged their duty, I leave to\r\n   their God and to themselves. They have, in pronouncing their verdict,\r\n   thought proper to recommend me as an object of humane mercy. In\r\n   return, I pray to God, if they have erred, to have mercy upon them.\r\n   The judge who condemned me humanely shed tears in uttering my\r\n   sentence. But whether he did wisely in so highly commending the\r\n   wretched informer, who swore away my life, I leave to his own cool\r\n   reflection, solemnly assuring him and all the world, with my dying\r\n   breath, that that informer was foresworn.\r\n\r\n   \"The law under which I suffer is surely a severe one--may the makers\r\n   and promoters of it be justified in the integrity of their motives,\r\n   and the purity of their own lives! By that law I am stamped a felon,\r\n   but my heart disdains the imputation.\r\n\r\n   \"My comfortable lot, and industrious course of life, best refute the\r\n   charge of being an adventurer for plunder; but if to have loved my\r\n   country--to have known its wrongs--to have felt the injuries of the\r\n   persecuted Catholics, and to have united with them and all other\r\n   religious persuasions in the most orderly and least sanguinary means\r\n   of procuring redress--if those be felonies, I am a felon, but not\r\n   otherwise. Had my counsel (for whose honorable exertions I am\r\n   indebted) prevailed in their motions to have me tried for high\r\n   treason, rather than under the insurrection law, I should have been,\r\n   entitled to a full defence, and my actions have been better\r\n   vindicated; but that was refused, and I must now submit to what has\r\n   passed.\r\n\r\n   \"To the generous protection of my country I leave a beloved wife, who\r\n   has been constant and true to me, and whose grief for my fate has\r\n   already nearly occasioned her death. I have five living children, who\r\n   have been my delight. May they love their country as I have done, and\r\n   die for it if needful.\r\n\r\n   \"Lastly, a false and ungenerous publication having appeared in a\r\n   newspaper, stating certain alleged confessions of guilt on my part,\r\n   and thus striking at my reputation, which is clearer to me than life.\r\n   I take this solemn method of contradicting the calumny. I was applied\r\n   to by the high-sheriff, and the Rev. William Bristow, sovereign of\r\n   Belfast, to make a confession of guilt, who used entreaties to that\r\n   effect; this I peremptorily refused. If I thought myself guilty, I\r\n   would freely confess it, but, on the contrary, I glory in my\r\n   innocence.\r\n\r\n   \"I trust that all my virtuous countrymen will bear me in their kind\r\n   remembrance, and continue true and faithful to each other as I have\r\n   been to all of them. With this last wish of my heart--nothing\r\n   doubting of the success of that cause for which I suffer, and hoping\r\n   for God's merciful forgiveness of such offences as my frail nature\r\n   may have at any time betrayed me into--I die in peace and charity\r\n   with all mankind.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had sentence of death been passed on William Orr, when\r\ncompunction seemed to seize on those who had aided in securing that\r\nresult. The witness Wheatly, who subsequently became insane, and is\r\nbelieved to have died by his own hand, made an affidavit before a\r\nmagistrate acknowledging that he had sworn falsely against Orr. Two of\r\nthe jury made depositions setting forth that they had been induced to\r\njoin in the verdict of guilty while under the influence of drink; two\r\nothers swore that they had been terrified into the same course by\r\nthreats of violence.\r\n\r\nThese depositions were laid before the viceroy, but Lord Camden, the\r\nthen Lord Lieutenant, was deaf to all appeals. Well might Orr exclaim\r\nwithin his dungeon that the government \"had laid down a system having\r\nfor its object murder and devastation.\" The prey was in the toils of the\r\nhunters, on whom all appeals of justice and humanity were wasted.\r\n\r\nOrr was hung, as we have said, in the town of Carrickfergus on the 14th\r\nof October, 1797. It is related that the inhabitants of the town, to\r\nexpress their sympathy with the patriot about being murdered by law, and\r\nto mark their abhorrence of the conduct of the government towards him,\r\nquitted the town _en masse_ on the day of his execution.\r\n\r\nHis fate excited the deepest indignation throughout the country; it was\r\ncommented on in words of fire by the national writers of the period, and\r\nthrough many an after year the watchword and rallying cry of the United\r\nIrishmen was--\r\n\r\n   \"REMEMBER ORR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY AND JOHN SHEARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many distinguished Irishmen who acted prominent parts in the\r\nstormy events of 1798, and whose names come down to us hallowed by the\r\nsufferings and sacrifices inseparable in those dark days from the lot of\r\nan Irish patriot, there are few whose fate excited more sympathy, more\r\nloved in life, more honored in death than the brothers John and Henry\r\nSheares. Even in the days of Emmet and Wolfe Tone, of Russell and\r\nFitzgerald, when men of education, talent, and social standing were not\r\nfew in the national ranks, the Sheareses were hailed as valuable\r\naccessions to the cause, and were recognised by the United Irishmen as\r\nheaven-destined leaders for the people. It is a touching story, the\r\nhistory of their patriotic exertions, their betrayal, trial, and\r\nexecution; but it is by studying such scenes in our history that\r\nIrishmen can learn to estimate the sacrifices which were made in bygone\r\ndays for Ireland, and attach a proper value to the memory of the\r\npatriots who made them.\r\n\r\nHenry and John Sheares were sons of John Sheares, a banker in Cork, who\r\nsat in the Irish Parliament for the borough of Clonakilty. The father\r\nappears to have been a kindly-disposed, liberal-minded man, and numerous\r\nstories are told of his unostentatious charity and benevolence. Henry,\r\nthe elder of the two sons, was born in 1753, and was educated in Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin. After leaving college he purchased a commission in the\r\n51st Regiment of foot, but the duties of a military officer were ill\r\nsuited to his temperament and disposition, and the young soldier soon\r\nresigned his commission to pursue the more congenial occupation of law\r\nstudent. He was called to the bar in 1790; his brother John, his junior\r\nby three years, who had adopted the same profession, obtained the rank\r\nof barrister-at-law two years previously. The brothers differed from\r\neach other widely in character and disposition. Henry was gentle in\r\nmanners, modest and unassuming, but firmly attached to his principles,\r\nand unswerving in his fidelity to the cause which he adopted; John was\r\nbold, impetuous, and energetic, ready to plan and to dare, fertile of\r\nresources, quick of resolve, and prompt of execution. To John the elder\r\nbrother looked for guidance and example, and his gentle nature was ever\r\nruled by the more fiery and impulsive spirit of his younger brother. On\r\nthe death of the father Henry Sheares came in for property to the value\r\nof £1,200 per annum, which his rather improvident habits soon diminished\r\nby one-half. Both brothers, however, obtained large practice at their\r\nprofession, and continued in affluent circumstances up to the day of\r\ntheir arrest.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 the two brothers visited Paris, and this excursion seems to have\r\nformed the turning point of their lives and fortunes. The French\r\nRevolution was in full swing, and in the society of Roland, Brissot, and\r\nother Republican leaders, the young Irishmen imbibed the love of\r\nfreedom, and impatience of tyranny and oppression, which they clung to\r\nso faithfully, and which distinguished them so remarkably during the\r\nremainder of their lives. On returning to Ireland in January, 1793, the\r\nbrothers joined the ranks of the United Irishmen. John at once became a\r\nprominent member of the society, and his signature appears to several of\r\nthe spirited and eloquent addresses by which the Dublin branch sought\r\nfrom time to time to arouse the ardour and stimulate the exertions of\r\ntheir compatriots. The society of United Irishmen looked for nothing\r\nmore at this period than a thorough measure of parliamentary reform,\r\nhousehold suffrage being the leading feature in their programme; but\r\nwhen the tyranny of the government drove the leaguers into more violent\r\nand dangerous courses, when republican government and separation from\r\nEngland were inscribed on the banners of the society instead of\r\nelectoral reform, and when the selfish and the wavering had shrunk\r\naside, the Sheareses still remained true to the United Irishmen, and\r\nseemed to grow more zealous and energetic in the cause of their country\r\naccording as the mists of perplexity and danger gathered around it.\r\n\r\nTo follow out the history of the Sheareses connection with the United\r\nIrishmen would be foreign to our intention and to the scope of this\r\nwork. The limits of our space oblige us to pass over the ground at a\r\nrapid pace, and we shall dismiss the period of the Sheareses' lives\r\ncomprised in the years between 1793 and 1798, by saying that during that\r\nperiod, while practising their profession with success, they devoted\r\nthemselves with all the earnestness of their nature to the furtherance\r\nof the objects of the United Irishmen. In March, 1798, the affairs of\r\nthe organization became critical; the arrest of the Directory at Oliver\r\nBond's deprived the party of its best and most trusted leaders, besides\r\nplacing in the hands of the government a mass of information relative to\r\nthe plans and resources of the conspirators. To fill the gap thus\r\ncaused, John Sheares was soon appointed a member of the Directory, and\r\nhe threw himself into the work with all the ardour and energy of his\r\nnature. The fortunes of the society had assumed a desperate phase when\r\nJohn Sheares became its ruling spirit. Tone was in France, O'Connor was\r\nin England, Russell, Emmet, and Fitzgerald were in prison. But Sheares\r\nwas not disheartened; he directed all his efforts towards bringing about\r\nthe insurrection for which his countrymen had so long been preparing,\r\nand the 23rd of May, 1798, was fixed on by him for the outbreak. He was\r\nafter visiting Wexford and Kildare, and making arrangements in those\r\ncounties for the rising, and was on the verge of starting for Cork on a\r\nsimilar mission, when the hand of treachery cut short his career, and\r\nthe gates of Kilmainham prison opened to receive him.\r\n\r\nAmongst all the human monsters who filled the ranks of the government\r\ninformers in that dark and troubled period, not one appears to merit a\r\ndeeper measure of infamy than Captain Warnesford Armstrong, the\r\nentrapper and betrayer of the Sheareses. Having obtained an introduction\r\nto John, he represented himself as a zealous and hard-working member of\r\nthe organization, and soon wormed himself completely into the confidence\r\nof his victims. He paid daily visits to the house of the Sheareses in\r\nBaggot-street, chatted with their families, and fondled the children of\r\nHenry Sheares upon his knee. We have it on his own testimony that each\r\ninterview with the men whose confidence he was sharing was followed by a\r\nvisit to the Castle. We need not go through the sickening details of\r\nthis vile story of treachery and fraud. On the 21st of May the Sheareses\r\nwere arrested and lodged in prison, and on the 12th of the following\r\nmonth Armstrong appeared against them in the witness-box. The trial was\r\ncontinued through the night--Toler, of infamous memory, who had been\r\ncreated Attorney-General expressly for the occasion, refusing Curran's\r\nrequest for an adjournment; and it was eight o'clock in the morning of\r\nthe 13th when the jury, who had been but seventeen minutes absent,\r\nreturned into court with a verdict of guilty against both prisoners.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours' adjournment the court re-assembled to pass sentence.\r\nIt was then that John Sheares, speaking in a firm tone, addressed the\r\ncourt as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"My Lords--I wish to offer a few words before sentence is pronounced,\r\n   because there is a weight pressing on my heart much greater than that\r\n   of the sentence which is to come from the court. There has been, my\r\n   lords, a weight pressing on my mind from the first moment I heard the\r\n   indictment read upon which I was tried; but that weight has been more\r\n   peculiarly pressing upon my heart when I found the accusation in the\r\n   indictment enforced and supported upon the trial. That weight would\r\n   be left insupportable if it were not for this opportunity of\r\n   discharging it; I shall feel it to be insupportable since a verdict\r\n   of my country has stamped that evidence as well founded. Do not\r\n   think, my lords, that I am about to make a declaration against the\r\n   verdict of the jury or the persons concerned with the trial; I am\r\n   only about to call to your recollection a part of the charge at which\r\n   my soul shudders, and if I had no opportunity of renouncing it before\r\n   your lordships and this auditory, no courage would be sufficient to\r\n   support me. The accusation of which I speak, while I linger here yet\r\n   a minute, is that of holding out to the people of Ireland a direction\r\n   to give no quarter to the troops fighting for its defence! My lords,\r\n   let me say thus, that if there be any acquaintances in this crowded\r\n   court--I do not say my intimate friends, but acquaintances--who do\r\n   not know what I say is truth, I shall be reputed the wretch which I\r\n   am not; I say if any acquaintance of mine can believe that _I_ could\r\n   utter a recommendation of giving no quarter to a yielding and\r\n   unoffending foe, it is not the death which I am about to suffer that\r\n   I deserve--no punishment could be adequate to such a crime. My lords,\r\n   I can not only acquit my soul of such an intention, but I declare, in\r\n   the presence of that God before whom I must shortly appear, that the\r\n   favourite doctrine of my heart was, _that no human being should\r\n   suffer death but when absolute necessity required it_. My lords, I\r\n   feel a consolation in making this declaration, which nothing else\r\n   could afford me, because it is not only a justification of myself,\r\n   but where I am sealing my life with that breath which cannot be\r\n   suspected of falsehood, what I say may make some impression upon the\r\n   minds of men not holding the same doctrine. I declare to God I know\r\n   of no crime but assassination which can eclipse or equal that of\r\n   which I am accused. I discern no shade of guilt between that and\r\n   taking away the life of a foe, by putting a bayonet to his heart when\r\n   he is yielding and surrendering. I do request the bench to believe\r\n   that of me--I do request my country to believe that of me--I am sure\r\n   God will think that of me. Now, my lords, I have no favour to ask of\r\n   the court; my country has decided I am guilty, and the law says I\r\n   shall suffer--it sees that I am ready to suffer. But, my lords, I\r\n   have a favour to request of the court that does not relate to myself.\r\n   My lords, I have a brother whom I have even loved dearer than myself,\r\n   but it is not from any affection for him alone that I am induced to\r\n   make the request. He is a man, and therefore I would hope prepared to\r\n   die if he stood as I do--though I do not stand unconnected; but he\r\n   stands more dearly connected. In short, my lords, to spare your\r\n   feelings and I my own, I do not pray that that _I_ should not die,\r\n   but that the husband, the father, the son--all comprised in one\r\n   person--holding these relations dearer in life to him than any other\r\n   man I know--for such a man I do not pray a pardon, for that is not in\r\n   the power of the court, but I pray a respite for such time as the\r\n   court in its humanity and discretion shall think proper. You have\r\n   heard, my lords, that his private affairs require arrangement. When I\r\n   address myself to your lordships, it is with the knowledge you will\r\n   have of all the sons of our aged mother being gone. Two have perished\r\n   in the service of the King--one very recently. I only request that,\r\n   disposing of me with what swiftness either the public mind or justice\r\n   requires, a respite may be given to my brother, that the family may\r\n   acquire strength to bear it all. That is all I wish; I shall remember\r\n   it to my last breath, and I shall offer up my prayers for you to that\r\n   Being who has endued us all with the sensibility to feel. That is all\r\n   I ask. I have nothing more to say.\"\r\n\r\nIt was four o'clock, p.m., when the judge proceeded to pass sentence,\r\nand the following morning was appointed for the double execution. At\r\nmid-day on Saturday, July 14th, the hapless men were removed to the room\r\nadjoining the place of execution, where they exchanged a last embrace.\r\nThey were then pinioned, the black caps put over their brows, and\r\nholding each other by the hand, they tottered out on the platform. The\r\nelder brother was somewhat moved by the terrors of his situation, but\r\nthe younger bore his fate with unflinching firmness. They were launched\r\ntogether into eternity--the same moment saw them dangling lifeless\r\ncorpses before the prison walls. They had lived in affectionate unity,\r\ninspired by the same motives, labouring for the same cause, and death\r\ndid not dissolve the tie. \"They died hand in hand, like true brothers.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the hangman's hideous office was completed, the bodies were taken\r\ndown, and the executioner, in accordance with the barbarous custom of\r\nthe time, proceeded to sever the heads from the bodies. It is said,\r\nhowever, that only on the body of Henry Sheares was that horrible act\r\nperformed. While the arrangements for the execution were in progress,\r\nSir Jonah Barrington had been making intercession with Lord Clare on\r\ntheir behalf, and beseeching at least a respite. His lordship declared\r\nthat the life of John Sheares could not be spared, but said that Henry\r\nmight possibly have something to say which would induce the government\r\nto commute his sentence; he furnished Sir Jonah with an order to delay\r\nthe execution one hour, and told him to communicate with Henry Sheares\r\non the subject. \"I hastened,\" writes Sir Jonah, \"to Newgate, and arrived\r\nat the very moment that the executioner was holding up the head of my\r\nold college friend, and saying, 'Here is the head of a traitor.'\" The\r\nfact of this order having been issued by the government, may have so far\r\ninterrupted the bloody work on the scaffold as to save the remains of\r\nthe younger Sheares from mutilation. The bodies of the patriots were\r\ninterred on the night of the execution in the vaults of St. Michan's\r\nchurch, where, enclosed in oaken coffins, marked in the usual manner\r\nwith the names and ages of the deceased, they still repose. Many a pious\r\nvisit has since been paid to those dim chambers--many a heart, filled\r\nwith love and pity, has throbbed above those coffin lids--many a tear\r\nhas dropped upon them. But it is not a feeling of grief alone that is\r\ninspired by the memory of those martyrs to freedom; hope, courage,\r\nconstancy, are the lessons taught by their lives, and the patriotic\r\nspirit that ruled their career is still awake and active in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT EMMET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all Irish history there is no name which touches the Irish heart like\r\nthat of Robert Emmet. We read, in that eventful record, of men who laid\r\ndown their lives for Ireland amid the roar and crash of battle, of\r\nothers who perished by the headsman's axe or the halter of the hangman,\r\nof others whose eyes were closed for ever in the gloom of English\r\ndungeons, and of many whose hearts broke amid the sorrows of involuntary\r\nexile; of men, too, who in the great warfare of mind rendered to the\r\nIrish cause services no less memorable and glorious. They are neither\r\nforgotten nor unhonoured. The warrior figure of Hugh O'Neill is a\r\nfamiliar vision to Irishmen; Sarsfield expiring on the foreign\r\nbattle-field with that infinitely pathetic and noble utterance on his\r\nlips--\"Would that this were for Ireland\"--is a cherished remembrance,\r\nand that last cry of a patriotic spirit dwells for ever about our\r\nhearts; Grattan battling against a corrupt and venal faction, first to\r\nwin and then to defend the independence of his country, astonishing\r\nfriends and foes alike by the dazzling splendour of his eloquence; and\r\nO'Connell on the hill-sides pleading for the restoration of Ireland's\r\nrights, and rousing his countrymen to a struggle for them, are pictures\r\nof which we are proud--memories that will live in song and story while\r\nthe Irish race has a distinct existence in the world. But in the\r\ncharacter of Robert Emmet there was such a rare combination of admirable\r\nqualities, and in his history there are so many of the elements of\r\nromance, that the man stands before our mental vision as a peculiarly\r\nnoble and loveable being, with claims upon our sympathies that are\r\nabsolutely without a parallel. He had youth, talent, social position, a\r\nfair share of fortune, and bright prospects for the future on his side\r\nwhen he embarked in the service of a cause that had but recently been\r\nsunk in defeat and ruin. Courage, genius, enthusiasm were his, high\r\nhopes and strong affections, all based upon and sweetened by a nature\r\nutterly free from guile. He was an orator and a poet; in the one art he\r\nhad already achieved distinction, in the other he was certain to take a\r\nhigh place, if he should make that an object of his ambition. He was a\r\ntrue patriot, true soldier, and true lover. If the story of his\r\npolitical life is full of melancholy interest, and calculated to awaken\r\nprofound emotions of reverence for his memory, the story of his\r\naffections is not less touching. Truly, \"there's not a line but hath\r\nbeen wept upon.\" So it is, that of all the heroic men who risked and\r\nlost everything for Ireland, none is so frequently remembered, none is\r\nthought of so tenderly as Robert Emmet. Poetry has cast a halo of light\r\nupon the name of the youthful martyr, and some of the sweetest strains\r\nof Irish music are consecrated to his memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT EMMET.]\r\n\r\nRobert Emmet was born on the 4th of March, 1778. He was the third son of\r\nDoctor Robert Emmet, a well-known and highly respectable physician of\r\nDublin. Thomas Addis Emmet, already mentioned in these pages, the\r\nassociate of Tone, the Sheareses, and other members of the United Irish\r\norganization, was an elder brother of Robert, and his senior by some\r\nsixteen years. Just about the period when the United Irishmen were\r\nforming themselves into a secret revolutionary society, young Emmet was\r\nsent to receive his education in Trinity College. There the bent of the\r\nlad's political opinions was soon detected; but among his fellow\r\nstudents he found many, and amongst them older heads than his own, who\r\nnot only shared his views, but went beyond them in the direction of\r\nliberal and democratic principles. In the Historical Society--composed\r\nof the _alumni_ of the college, and on whose books at this time were\r\nmany names that subsequently became famous--those kindred spirits made\r\nfor themselves many opportunities of giving expression to their\r\nsentiments, and showing that their hearts beat in unison with the great\r\nmovement for human freedom which was then agitating the world. To their\r\ndebates Emmet brought the aid of a fine intellect and a fluent\r\nutterance, and he soon became the orator of the patriot party.\r\n\r\nSo great was the effect created by his fervid eloquence and his\r\nadmirable reasoning, that the heads of the college thought it prudent on\r\nseveral occasions to send one of the ablest of their body to take part\r\nin the proceedings, and assist in refuting the argumentation of the\r\n\"young Jacobin.\" And to such extremities did matters proceed at last\r\nthat Emmet, with several of his political friends, was expelled the\r\ncollege, others less obnoxious to the authorities were subjected to a\r\nsevere reprimand, and the society, thus terrorised and weakened, soon\r\nceased to exist. Our national poet, Thomas Moore, the fellow-student and\r\nintimate friend of young Emmet, witnessed many of those displays of his\r\nabilities, and in his \"Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald,\" speaks\r\nof him in terms of the highest admiration. \"Were I,\" he says, \"to number\r\nthe men among all I have ever known who appeared to me to combine in the\r\ngreatest degree pure moral worth with intellectual power, I should,\r\namong the highest of the few, place Robert Emmet.\" \"He was,\" writes the\r\nsame authority, \"wholly free from the follies and frailties of\r\nyouth--though how capable he was of the most devoted passion events\r\nafterwards proved.\" Of his oratory, he says, \"I have heard little since\r\nthat appeared to me of a loftier, or what is a far more rare quality in\r\nIrish eloquence, purer character.\" And the appearance of this greatly\r\ngifted youth, he thus describes: \"Simple in all his habits, and with a\r\nrepose of look and manner indicating but little movement within, it was\r\nonly when the spring was touched that set his feelings, and through them\r\nhis intellect in motion, that he at all rose above the level of ordinary\r\nmen. No two individuals indeed could be much more unlike to each other\r\nthan was the same youth to himself before rising to speak and after; the\r\nbrow that had appeared inanimate and almost drooping, at once elevating\r\nitself to all the consciousness of power, and the whole countenance and\r\nfigure of the speaker assuming a change as of one suddenly inspired.\"\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of Emmet from the college occurred in the month of\r\nFebruary, 1798. On the 12th of the following month his brother, Thomas\r\nAddis Emmet, was arrested. The manner in which this noble-hearted\r\ngentleman took the oath of the United Irish Society, in the year of\r\n1795, is so remarkable that we cannot omit mention of it here. His\r\nservices as a lawyer having been engaged in the defence of some persons\r\nwho stood charged with having sworn in members to the United Irish\r\norganization--the crime for which William Orr was subsequently tried and\r\nexecuted--he, in the course of the proceedings, took up the oath and\r\nread it with remarkable deliberation and solemnity. Then, taking into\r\nhis hand the prayer book that lay on the table for the swearing of\r\nwitnesses, and looking to the bench and around the court, he said\r\naloud--\r\n\r\n\"My Lords--Here, in the presence of this legal court, this crowded\r\nauditory--in the presence of the Being that sees and witnesses, and\r\ndirects this judicial tribunal--here, my lords, I, myself, in the\r\npresence of God, declare I take this oath.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms of the oath at this time were, in fact, perfectly\r\nconstitutional, having reference simply to attainment of a due\r\nrepresentation of the Irish nation in parliament--still, the oath was\r\nthat of a society declared to be illegal, and the administration of it\r\nhad been made a capital offence. The boldness of the advocate in thus\r\nadministering it to himself in open court appeared to paralyse the minds\r\nof the judges. They took no notice of the act, and what was even more\r\nremarkable, the prisoners, who were convicted, received a lenient\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Robert Emmet--the events of 1798, as might be supposed,\r\nhad a powerful effect on the feelings of the enthusiastic young patriot,\r\nand he was not free of active participation with the leaders of the\r\nmovement in Dublin. He was, of course, an object of suspicion to the\r\ngovernment, and it appears marvellous that they did not immediately take\r\nhim into their safe keeping under the provisions of the _Habeas Corpus_\r\nSuspension Act. Ere long, however, he found that prudence would counsel\r\nhis concealment, or his disappearance from the country, and he took his\r\ndeparture for the Continent, where he met with a whole host of the Irish\r\nrefugees; and, in 1802, was joined by his brother and others of the\r\npolitical prisoners who had been released from the confinement to\r\nwhich--in violation of a distinct agreement between them and the\r\ngovernment--they had been subjected in Fort George, in Scotland. Their\r\nsufferings had not broken their spirit. There was hope still, they\r\nthought, for Ireland; great opportunities were about to dawn upon that\r\noften defeated, but still unconquerable nation, and they applied\r\nthemselves to the task of preparing the Irish people to take advantage\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nAt home the condition of affairs was not such as to discourage them. The\r\npeople had not lost heart; the fighting spirit was still rife amongst\r\nthem. The rebellion had been trampled out, but it had been sustained\r\nmainly by a county or two, and it had served to show that a general\r\nuprising of the people would be sufficient to sweep every vestige of\r\nBritish power from the land. Then they had in their favour the\r\nexasperation against the government which was caused by that most\r\ninfamous transaction, the passage of the Act of Union. But they found\r\ntheir chief encouragement in the imminence of another war between France\r\nand England. Once more the United Irishmen put themselves into\r\ncommunication with Buonaparte, then First Consul, and again they\r\nreceived flattering promises of assistance. Robert Emmet obtained an\r\ninterview with that great man, and learned from him that it was his\r\nsettled purpose on the breaking out of hostilities, which could not long\r\nbe deferred, to effect an invasion of England. Full of high hopes, Emmet\r\nreturned to Dublin in October, 1802; and as he was now in very heart of\r\na movement for another insurrection, he took every precaution to avoid\r\ndiscovery. He passed under feigned names, and moved about as little as\r\npossible. He gathered together the remnants of the United Irish\r\norganization, and with some money of his own, added to considerable sums\r\nsupplied to him by a Mr. Long, a merchant, residing at No. 4\r\nCrow-street, and other sympathisers, he commenced the collection of an\r\narmament and military stores for his followers. In the month of May,\r\n1803, the expected war between France and England broke out. This event\r\nof course raised still higher his hopes, and gave a great stimulus to\r\nhis exertions. To and fro he went from one to another of the depots\r\nwhich he had established for the manufacture and storage of arms in\r\nvarious parts of the city, cheering, directing, and assisting his men at\r\ntheir work. Pikes were got ready by the thousand, and ingeniously stowed\r\naway until they should be wanted; rockets, hand-grenades, and other\r\ndeadly missiles were carefully prepared; but an accidental explosion,\r\nwhich occurred on the 16th of July, in one of these manufactories\r\nsituate in Patrick-street, was very near leading to the discovery of the\r\nentire business, and had the effect of precipitating the outbreak. The\r\ngovernment at this time had undoubtedly got on the scent of the\r\nmovement, and the leaders considered that no time was to be lost in\r\nbringing matters to a crisis. Emmet now took up his abode in the\r\nMarshalsea-lane depot, snatching his few hours of sleep \"on a mattress,\r\nsurrounded by all the implements of death.\" There he made a final\r\narrangement of his plans, and communicated his instructions to his\r\nsubordinates, fixing the 23rd of July as the date for the rising.\r\n\r\nThe history of that unfortunate attempt need not here be written.\r\nSuffice it to say that the arrangements miscarried in nearly every\r\nparticular. The men in the numbers calculated upon did not assemble at\r\nthe appointed time or in the appointed places, and the whole force that\r\nturned out in Thomas-street for the attack on the Castle did not number\r\na hundred insurgents. They were joined by a riotous and noisy rabble;\r\nand their unfortunate leader soon perceived that his following was, as\r\nhad previously been said of the king's troops, \"formidable to every one\r\nbut the enemy.\" They had not proceeded far on their way when a carriage,\r\nin which were Lord Kilwarden, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, his\r\ndaughter, and his nephew, the Rev. Mr. Wolfe, drove into the street. The\r\nvehicle was stopped, and the Chief Justice was immediately piked by a\r\nman in the crowd whose son he had some time previously condemned to\r\nexecution. The clergyman also was pulled out of the carriage and put to\r\ndeath. To the lady no violence was offered, and Emmet himself, who had\r\nheard of the deplorable tragedy, rushing from the head of his party,\r\nbore her in his arms to an adjoining house. No attack on the Castle took\r\nplace; the insurgent party scattered and melted away even before the\r\nappearance of military on the scene, and in little more than an hour\r\nfrom the time of his setting out on his desperate enterprise, Robert\r\nEmmet was a defeated and ruined man, a fugitive, with the whole host of\r\nBritish spies and bloodhounds employed to hunt him to the death.\r\n\r\nYet he might have foiled them and got clear out of the country if his\r\npersonal safety was all on earth he cared for. But in that noble heart\r\nof his there was one passion co-existent with his love of Ireland, and\r\nnot unworthy of the companionship, which forbade his immediate flight.\r\nWith all that intensity of affection of which a nature so pure and so\r\nardent as his was capable, he loved a being in every way worthy of\r\nhim--a lady so gentle, and good, and fair, that even to a less poetic\r\nimagination than his own, she might seem to be a fitting personification\r\nof his beloved Erin; and by her he was loved and trusted in return. Who\r\nis it that has not heard her name?--who has not mourned over the story\r\nof Sarah Curran! In the ruin that had fallen on the hopes and fortunes\r\nof the patriot chief, the happiness of this amiable lady was involved.\r\nHe would not leave without an interview with her--no! though a thousand\r\ndeaths should be the penalty. The delay was fatal to his chances of\r\nescape. For more than a month he remained in concealment, protected by\r\nthe fidelity of friends, many of whom belonged to the humbler walks of\r\nlife, and one of whom in particular--the heroic Anne Devlin, from whom\r\nneither proffered bribes nor cruel tortures could extort a single hint\r\nas to his place of abode--should ever be held in grateful remembrance by\r\nIrishmen. At length on the 25th of August, the ill-fated young\r\ngentleman was arrested in the house of a Mrs. Palmer, at Harold's-cross.\r\nOn the 19th of September he was put on his trial in the court-house,\r\nGreen-street, charged with high treason. He entered on no defence,\r\nbeyond making a few remarks in the course of the proceedings with a view\r\nto the moral and political justification of his conduct. The jury,\r\nwithout leaving their box, returned a verdict of guilty against him;\r\nafter which, having been asked in due form why sentence of death should\r\nnot be pronounced upon him, he delivered this memorable speech, every\r\nline of which is known and dear to the hearts of the Irish race:--\r\n\r\n   \"MY LORDS--I am asked what have I to say why sentence of death should\r\n   not be pronounced on me, according to law. I have nothing to say that\r\n   can alter your predetermination, nor that it will become me to say,\r\n   with any view to the mitigation of that sentence which you are to\r\n   pronounce, and I must abide by. But I have that to say which\r\n   interests me more than life, and which you have laboured to destroy.\r\n   I have much to say why my reputation should be rescued from the load\r\n   of false accusation and calumny which has been cast upon it, I do not\r\n   imagine that, seated where you are, your mind can be so free from\r\n   prejudice as to receive the least impression from what I am going to\r\n   utter. I have no hopes that I can anchor my character in the breast\r\n   of a court constituted and trammelled as this is. I only wish, and\r\n   that is the utmost that I expect, that your lordships may suffer it\r\n   to float down your memories untainted by the foul breath of\r\n   prejudice, until it finds some more hospitable harbour to shelter it\r\n   from the storms by which it is buffetted. Was I only to suffer death,\r\n   after being adjudged guilty by your tribunal, I should bow in\r\n   silence, and meet the fate that awaits me without a murmur; but the\r\n   sentence of the law which delivers my body to the executioner will,\r\n   through the ministry of the law, labour in its own vindication, to\r\n   consign my character to obloquy; for there must be guilt somewhere,\r\n   whether in the sentence of the court, or in the catastrophe, time\r\n   must determine. A man in my situation has not only to encounter the\r\n   difficulties of fortune, and the force of power over minds which it\r\n   has corrupted or subjugated, but the difficulties of established\r\n   prejudice. The man dies, but his memory lives. That mine may not\r\n   perish, that it may live in the respect of my countrymen, I seize\r\n   upon this opportunity to vindicate myself from some of the charges\r\n   alleged against me. When my spirit shall be wafted to a more friendly\r\n   port--when my shade shall have joined the bands of those martyred\r\n   heroes who have shed their blood on the scaffold and in the field in\r\n   the defence of their country and of virtue, this is my hope--I wish\r\n   that my memory and name may animate those who survive me, while I\r\n   look down with complacency on the destruction of that perfidious\r\n   government which upholds its domination by blasphemy of the Most\r\n   High--which displays its power over man, as over the beasts of the\r\n   forest--which sets man upon his brother, and lifts his hand, in the\r\n   name of God, against the throat of his fellow who believes or doubts\r\n   a little more or a little less than the government standard--a\r\n   government which is steeled to barbarity by the cries of the orphans,\r\n   and the tears of the widows it has made.\"\r\n\r\n   [Here Lord Norbury interrupted Mr. Emmet, saying--\"that the mean and\r\n   wicked enthusiasts who felt as he did, were not equal to the\r\n   accomplishment of their wild designs.\"]\r\n\r\n   \"I appeal to the immaculate God--I swear by the Throne of Heaven,\r\n   before which I must shortly appear--by the blood of the murdered\r\n   patriots who have gone before me--that my conduct has been, through\r\n   all this peril, and through all my purposes, governed only by the\r\n   conviction which I have uttered, and by no other view than that of\r\n   the emancipation of my country from the superinhuman oppression under\r\n   which she has so long and too patiently travailed; and I confidently\r\n   hope that, wild and chimerical as it may appear, there is still union\r\n   and strength in Ireland to accomplish this noblest of enterprises. Of\r\n   this I speak with confidence, of intimate knowledge, and with the\r\n   consolation that appertains to that confidence. Think not, my lords,\r\n   I say this for the petty gratification of giving you a transitory\r\n   uneasiness. A man who never yet raised his voice to assert a lie,\r\n   will not hazard his character with posterity, by asserting a\r\n   falsehood on a subject so important to his country, and on an\r\n   occasion like this. Yes, my lords, a man who does not wish to have\r\n   his epitaph written until his country is liberated, will not leave a\r\n   weapon in the power of envy, or a pretence to impeach the probity\r\n   which he means to preserve, even in the grave, to which tyranny\r\n   consigns him.\"\r\n\r\n   [Here he was again interrupted by the court]\r\n\r\n   \"Again I say, that what I have spoken was not intended for your\r\n   lordship, whose situation I commisserate rather than envy--my\r\n   expressions were for my countrymen. If there is a true Irishman\r\n   present, let my last words cheer him in the hour of his affliction.\"\r\n\r\n   [Here he was again interrupted. Lord Norbury said he did not sit\r\n   there to hear treason.]\r\n\r\n   \"I have always understood it to be the duty of a judge, when a\r\n   prisoner has been convicted, to pronounce the sentence of the law. I\r\n   have also understood that judges sometimes think it their duty to\r\n   hear with patience, and to speak with humanity; to exhort the victim\r\n   of the laws, and to offer, with tender benignity, their opinions of\r\n   the motives by which he was actuated in the crime of which he was\r\n   adjudged guilty. That a judge has thought it his duty so to have\r\n   done, I have no doubt; but where is the boasted freedom of your\r\n   institutions--where is the vaunted impartiality, clemency, and\r\n   mildness of your courts of justice if an unfortunate prisoner, whom\r\n   your policy, and not justice, is about to deliver into the hands of\r\n   the executioner, is not suffered to explain his motives sincerely and\r\n   truly, and to vindicate the principles by which he was actuated? My\r\n   lords, it may be a part of the system of angry justice to bow a man's\r\n   mind by humiliation to the purposed, ignominy of the scaffold; but\r\n   worse to me than the purposed shame, or the scaffold's terrors, would\r\n   be the shame of such foul and unfounded imputations as have been laid\r\n   against me in this court. You, my lord, are a judge; I am the\r\n   supposed culprit. I am a man; you are a man also. By a revolution of\r\n   power we might change places, though we never could change\r\n   characters. If I stand at the bar of this court, and dare not\r\n   vindicate my character, what a farce is your justice! If I stand at\r\n   this bar and dare not vindicate my character, how dare you calumniate\r\n   it. Does the sentence of death, which your unhallowed policy inflicts\r\n   on my body, condemn my tongue to silence and my reputation to\r\n   reproach? Your executioner may abridge the period of my existence;\r\n   but while I exist I shall not forbear to vindicate my character and\r\n   motives from your aspersions; and, as a man, to whom fame is dearer\r\n   than life, I will make the last use of that life in doing justice to\r\n   that reputation which is to live after me, and which is the only\r\n   legacy I can leave to those I honor and love, and for whom I am proud\r\n   to perish. As men, my lords, we must appear on the great day at one\r\n   common tribunal; and it will then remain for the Searcher of all\r\n   hearts to show a collective universe, who was engaged in the most\r\n   virtuous actions, or swayed by the purest motives--my country's\r\n   oppressor, or\"-----\r\n\r\n   [Here he was interrupted, and told to listen to the sentence of the\r\n   law].\r\n\r\n   \"My lords, will a dying man be denied the legal privilege of\r\n   exculpating himself in the eyes of the community from an undeserved\r\n   reproach, thrown upon him during his trial, by charging him with\r\n   ambition, and attempting to cast away for a paltry consideration the\r\n   liberties of his country? Why did your lordships insult me? Or\r\n   rather, why insult justice, in demanding of me why sentence of death\r\n   should not be pronounced against me? I know, my lords, that form\r\n   prescribes that you should ask the question. The form also presents\r\n   the right of answering. This, no doubt, may be dispensed with, and so\r\n   might the whole ceremony of the trial, since sentence was already\r\n   pronounced at the Castle before the jury were empanelled. Your\r\n   lordships are but the priests of the oracle, and I insist on the\r\n   whole of the forms.\"\r\n\r\n   [Here Mr. Emmet paused, and the court desired him to proceed.]\r\n\r\n   \"I am charged with being an emissary of France. An emissary of\r\n   France! and for what end? It is alleged that I wished to sell the\r\n   independence of my country; and for what end? Was this the object of\r\n   my ambition? And is this the mode by which a tribunal of justice\r\n   reconciles contradiction? No; I am no emissary; and my ambition was\r\n   to hold a place among the deliverers of my country, not in power nor\r\n   in profit, but in the glory of the achievement. Sell my country's\r\n   independence to France! and for what? Was it a change of masters? No,\r\n   but for my ambition. Oh, my country, was it personal ambition that\r\n   could influence me? Had it been the soul of my actions, could I not,\r\n   by my education and fortune, by the rank and consideration of my\r\n   family, have placed myself amongst the proudest of your oppressor. My\r\n   Country was my Idol. To it I sacrificed every selfish, every\r\n   endearing sentiment; and for it I now offer up myself, O God! No, my\r\n   lords; I acted as an Irishman, determined on delivering my country\r\n   from the yoke of a foreign and unrelenting tyranny, and the more\r\n   galling yoke of a domestic faction, which is its joint partner and\r\n   perpetrator in the patricide, from the ignominy existing with an\r\n   exterior of splendour and a conscious depravity. It was the wish of\r\n   my heart to extricate my country from this doubly rivetted\r\n   despotism--I wished to place her independence beyond the reach of any\r\n   power on earth. I wished to exalt her to that proud station in the\r\n   world. Connection with France was, indeed, intended, but only as far\r\n   as mutual interest would sanction or require. Were the French to\r\n   assume any authority inconsistent with the purest independence, it\r\n   would be signal for their destruction. We sought their aid--and we\r\n   sought it as we had assurance we should obtain it--as auxiliaries in\r\n   war, and allies in peace. Were the French to come as invaders or\r\n   enemies, uninvited by the wishes of the people, I should oppose them\r\n   to the utmost of my strength. Yes! my countrymen, I should advise you\r\n   to meet them upon the beach with a sword in one hand, and a torch in\r\n   the other. I would meet them with all the destructive fury of war. I\r\n   would animate my countrymen to immolate them in their boats, before\r\n   they had contaminated the soil of my country. If they succeeded in\r\n   landing, and if forced to retire before superior discipline, I would\r\n   dispute every inch of ground, burn every blade of grass, and the last\r\n   entrenchment of liberty should be my grave. What I could not do\r\n   myself, if I should fall, I should leave as a last charge to my\r\n   countrymen to accomplish; because I should feel conscious that life,\r\n   any more than death, is unprofitable when a foreign nation holds my\r\n   country in subjection. But it was not as an enemy that the succours\r\n   of France were to land. I looked, indeed, for the assistance of\r\n   France; but I wished to prove to France and to the world that\r\n   Irishmen deserved to be assisted--that they were indignant at\r\n   slavery, and ready to assert the independence and liberty of their\r\n   country; I wished to procure for my country the guarantee which\r\n   Washington procured for America--to procure an aid which, by its\r\n   example, would be as important as its valour; disciplined, gallant,\r\n   pregnant with science and experience; that of a people who would\r\n   perceive the good, and polish the rough points of our character. They\r\n   would come to us as strangers, and leave us as friends, after sharing\r\n   in our perils and elevating our destiny. These were my objects; not\r\n   to receive new taskmasters, but to expel old tyrants. It was for\r\n   these ends I sought aid from France; because France, even as an\r\n   enemy, could not be more implacable than the enemy already in the\r\n   bosom of my country.\"\r\n\r\n   [Here he was interrupted by the court.]\r\n\r\n   \"I have been charged with that importance in the emancipation of my\r\n   country, as to be consided the key-stone of the combination of\r\n   Irishmen; or, as your lordship expressed it, 'the life and blood of\r\n   the conspiracy.' You do me honour over much; you have given to the\r\n   subaltern all the credit of a superior. There are men engaged in this\r\n   conspiracy who are not only superior to me, but even to your own\r\n   conceptions of yourself, my lord--men before the splendour of whose\r\n   genius and virtues I should bow with respectful deference, and who\r\n   would think themselves disgraced by shaking your blood-stained hand.\"\r\n\r\n   [Here he was interrupted.]\r\n\r\n   \"What, my lord, shall you tell me, on the passage to the scaffold,\r\n   which that tyranny (of which you are only the intermediary\r\n   executioner) has erected for my murder, that I am accountable for all\r\n   the blood that has and will be shed in this struggle of the oppressed\r\n   against the oppressor--shall you tell me this, and must I be so very\r\n   a slave as not to repel it? I do not fear to approach the Omnipotent\r\n   Judge to answer for the conduct of my whole life; and am I to be\r\n   appalled and falsified by a mere remnant of mortality here? By you,\r\n   too, although if it were possible to collect all the innocent blood\r\n   that you have shed in your unhallowed ministry in one great reservoir\r\n   your lordship might swim in it.\"\r\n\r\n   [Here the judge interfered.]\r\n\r\n   \"Let no man dare, when I am dead, to charge me with dishonor; let no\r\n   man attaint my memory, by believing that I could have engaged in any\r\n   cause but that of my country's liberty and independence; or that I\r\n   could have become the pliant minion of power, in the oppression and\r\n   misery of my country. The proclamation of the Provisional Government\r\n   speaks for our views; no inference can be tortured from it to\r\n   countenance barbarity or debasement at home, or subjection,\r\n   humiliation, or treachery from abroad. I would not have submitted to\r\n   a foreign oppressor, for the same reason that I would resist the\r\n   foreign and domestic oppressor. In the dignity of freedom, I would\r\n   have fought upon the threshold of my country, and its enemy should\r\n   enter only by passing over my lifeless corpse. And am I, who lived\r\n   but for my country, and who have subjected myself to the dangers of\r\n   the jealous and watchful oppressor, and the bondage of the grave,\r\n   only to give my countrymen their rights, and my country her\r\n   independence, am I to be loaded with calumny, and not suffered to\r\n   resent it? No; God forbid!\"\r\n\r\n   Here Lord Norbury told Mr. Emmet that his sentiments and language\r\n   disgraced his family and his education, but more particularly his\r\n   father, Dr. Emmet, who was a man, if alive, that would not\r\n   countenance such opinions. To which Mr. Emmet replied:--\r\n\r\n   \"If the spirits of the illustrious dead participate in the concerns\r\n   and cares of those who were dear to them in this transitory life,\r\n   oh! ever dear and venerated shade of my departed father, look down\r\n   with scrutiny upon the conduct of your suffering son, and see if I\r\n   have, even for a moment, deviated from those principles of morality\r\n   and patriotism which it was your care to instil into my youthful\r\n   mind, and for which I am now about to offer up my life. My lords, you\r\n   are impatient for the sacrifice. The blood which you seek is not\r\n   congealed by the artificial terrors which surround your victim--it\r\n   circulates warmly and unruffled through the channels which God\r\n   created for noble purposes, but which you are now bent to destroy,\r\n   for purposes so grievous that they cry to heaven. Be yet patient! I\r\n   have but a few more words to say--I am going to my cold and silent\r\n   grave--my lamp of life is nearly extinguished--my race is run--the\r\n   grave opens to receive me, and I sink into its bosom. I have but one\r\n   request to ask at my departure from this world, it is--THE CHARITY OF\r\n   ITS SILENCE. Let no man write my epitaph; for as no man who knows my\r\n   motives dare now vindicate them, let not prejudice or ignorance\r\n   asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and peace; and my\r\n   tomb remain uninscribed, and my memory in oblivion, until other times\r\n   and other men can do justice to my character. When my country takes\r\n   her place among the nations of the earth, _then_ and _not till then_,\r\n   let my epitaph be written. I have done.\"\r\n\r\nThis affecting address was spoken--as we learn from the painstaking and\r\ngenerous biographer of the United Irishmen, Dr, Madden--\"in so loud a\r\nvoice as to be distinctly heard at the outer doors of the court-house;\r\nand yet, though he spoke in a loud tone, there was nothing boisterous in\r\nhis manner; his accents and cadence of voice, on the contrary, were\r\nexquisitely modulated. His action was very remarkable, its greater or\r\nlesser vehemence corresponded with the rise and fall of his voice. He is\r\ndescribed as moving about the dock, as he warmed in his address, with\r\nrapid, but not ungraceful motions--now in front of the railing before\r\nthe bench, then retiring, as if his body, as well as his mind, were\r\nspelling beyond the measure of its chains. His action was not confined\r\nto his hands; he seemed to have acquired a swaying motion of the body\r\nwhen he spoke in public, which was peculiar to him, but there was no\r\naffectation in it.\"\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock, p.m., on the day of his trial, the barbarous sentence of\r\nthe law--the same that we have so recently heard passed on prisoners\r\nstanding in that same dock, accused of the same offence against the\r\nrulers of this country--was passed on Robert Emmet. Only a few hours\r\nwere given him in which to withdraw his thoughts from the things of this\r\nworld and fix them on the next. He was hurried away, at midnight, from\r\nNewgate to Kilmainham jail, passing through Thomas-street, the scene of\r\nhis attempted insurrection. Hardly had the prison van driven through,\r\nwhen workmen arrived and commenced the erection of the gibbet from which\r\nhis body was to be suspended. About the hour of noon, on the 20th of\r\nSeptember, he mounted the scaffold with a firm and composed demeanour; a\r\nminute or two more and the lifeless remains of one of the most gifted of\r\nGod's creatures hung from the cross beams--strangled by the enemies of\r\nhis country--cut off in the bloom of youth, in the prime of his physical\r\nand intellectual powers, because he had loved his own land, hated her\r\noppressors, and striven to give freedom to his people. But not yet was\r\nEnglish vengeance satisfied. While the body was yet warm it was cut down\r\nfrom the gibbet, the neck placed across a block on the scaffold, and the\r\nhead severed from the body. Then the executioner held it up before the\r\nhorrified and sorrowing crowd that stood outside the lines of soldiery,\r\nproclaiming to them--\"This is the head of a traitor!\" A traitor! It was\r\na false proclamation. No traitor was he, but a true and noble gentleman.\r\nNo traitor, but a most faithful heart to all that was worthy of love and\r\nhonour. No traitor, but a martyr for Ireland. The people who stood\r\nagonized before his scaffold, tears streaming from their eyes, and their\r\nhearts bursting with suppressed emotion, knew that for them and for\r\nIreland he had offered up his young life. And when the deed was\r\nfinished, and the mutilated body had been taken away, and the armed\r\nguards had marched from the fatal spot, old people and young moved up to\r\nit to dip their handkerchiefs in the blood of the martyr, that they\r\nmight then treasure up the relics for ever. Well has his memory been\r\ncherished in the Irish heart from that day to the present time. Six\r\nyears ago a procession of Irishmen, fifteen thousand strong, hearing\r\nanother rebel to his grave, passed by the scene of that execution, every\r\nman of whom reverently uncovered his head as he reached the hallowed\r\nspot. A few months ago, a banner borne in another Irish insurrection\r\ndisplayed the inscription--\r\n\r\n\"REMEMBER EMMET.\"\r\n\r\nFar away \"beyond the Atlantic foam,\" and \"by the long wash of\r\nAustralasian seas,\" societies are in existence bearing his name, and\r\nhaving for their object to cherish his memory and perpetuate his\r\nprinciples. And wherever on the habitable globe a few members of the\r\nscattered Irish race are to be found, there are hearts that are thrilled\r\nby even the faintest allusion to the uninscribed grave-stone and the\r\nunwritten epitaph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS RUSSELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Emmet was dead, and the plan to which he devoted his fortune, his\r\ntalents, and his life, had sunk in failure, the cause of Irish\r\nindependence appeared finally lost, and the cry, more than once repeated\r\nin after times, that \"now, indeed, the last bolt of Irish disaffection\r\nhas been sped, and that there would never again be an Irish rebellion,\"\r\nrung loudly from the exulting enemies of Ireland. The hearts of the\r\npeople seemed broken by the weight of the misfortunes and calamities\r\nthat overwhelmed them. The hopes which had brightened their stormy path,\r\nand enabled them to endure the oppression to which they were subjected\r\nby expectations of a glorious change, flickered no longer amidst the\r\ndarkness. The efforts of the insurgents were everywhere drowned in\r\nblood; the hideous memories of '98 were brought up anew; full of bitter\r\nthoughts, exasperated, humiliated, and despondent, the people brooded\r\nover their wretched fate, and sullenly submitted to the reign of terror\r\nwhich was inaugurated amongst them. Little had the Irish patriots to\r\nlook forward to in that dark hour of suffering and disappointment. A\r\nnightmare of blood and violence weighed down the spirits of the people;\r\na stupor appeared to have fallen on the nation; and though time might be\r\ntrusted to arouse them from the trance, they had suffered another loss,\r\nnot so easily repaired, in the death and dispersion of their leaders.\r\nWhere now should they find the Moses to lead them from the land of\r\ncaptivity? Tone, Fitzgerald, Emmet, Bond, M'Cracken, the Sheareses--all\r\nwere dead. M'Nevin, Neilson, and O'Connor were in exile. Heavily and\r\nrelentlessly the arm of vengeance had fallen on them one by one; but the\r\nlist was not even then completed. There was yet another victim to fall\r\nbefore the altar of liberty, and the sacrifice which commenced with Orr\r\ndid not conclude until Thomas Russell had perished on the gallows of\r\nDownpatrick.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the part which Thomas Russell fills in the history of\r\nthe United Irishmen, the worth of his character, the purity and nobility\r\nof his sentiments, and the spirit of uncompromising patriotism displayed\r\nin his last address, would render unpardonable the omission of his name\r\nfrom such a work as this. \"I mean to make my trial,\" said Russell, \"and\r\nthe last of my life, if it is to close now, as serviceable to the cause\r\nof liberty as I can,\" and he kept his word. To-day, we try in some\r\nslight way to requite that fidelity which endured unto death, by\r\nrescuing Thomas Russell's name from oblivion, and recalling his services\r\nand virtues to the recollection of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Betsborough, Dunnahane, in the parish of Kilshanick,\r\ncounty Cork, on the 21st November, 1767. His father was an officer in\r\nthe British army, who had fought against the Irish Brigade in the\r\nmemorable battle of Fontenoy, and who died in a high situation in the\r\nRoyal Hospital at Kilmainham. Thomas, the youngest of his three sons,\r\nwas educated for the Protestant Church; but his inclinations sought a\r\ndifferent field of action, and at the age of fifteen he left for India\r\nas a volunteer, where he served with his brother, Ambrose, whose\r\ngallantry in battle called down commendation from the English king.\r\nThomas Russell quitted India after five years' service, and his return\r\nis ascribed to the disgust and indignation which filled him on\r\nwitnessing the extortions, the cruelties, the usurpations, and\r\nbrutalities, which were carried out and sanctioned by the government\r\nunder which he served. He left Ireland burdened with few fixed political\r\nprinciples and little knowledge of the world; he returned a full grown\r\nman, imbued with the opinions which he never afterwards abandoned. He\r\nwas then, we are told, a model of manly beauty, one of those favoured\r\nindividuals whom we cannot pass in the street without being guilty of\r\nthe rudeness of staring in the face while passing, and turning round to\r\nlook at the receding figure. Though more than six feet high, his\r\nmajestic stature was scarcely observed, owing to the exquisite symmetry\r\nof his form. Martial in his gait and demeanour, his appearance was not\r\naltogether that of a soldier. His dark and steady eye, compressed lip,\r\nand some what haughty bearing, were occasionally strongly indicative of\r\nthe camp; but in general the classic contour of his finely formed head,\r\nthe expression of sweetness that characterised his smile, and the\r\nbenevolence that beamed in his fine countenance, seemed to mark him out\r\nas one that was destined to be the ornament, grace, and blessing of\r\nprivate life. His manners were those of the finished gentleman, combined\r\nwith that native grace which nothing but superiority of intellect can\r\ngive; he was naturally reserved and retiring in disposition, and his\r\nprivate life was distinguished by eminent purity and an unostentatious\r\ndevotion to the precepts of religion.\r\n\r\nSuch was Thomas Russell when he made the acquaintance of Theobald Wolfe\r\nTone in Dublin. There is no doubt that the views and opinions of Tone\r\nmade a profound impression on young Russell; it is equally certain, on\r\nthe other hand, that Tone learned to love and esteem his new friend,\r\nwhose sentiments were so much in accordance with his own. Throughout\r\nTone's journal we find constant references to Thomas Russell, whom he\r\nalways places with Thomas Addis Emmet at the head of his list of\r\nfriends. Early in 1791 Russell proceeded to Belfast to join the 64th\r\nRegiment, in which he had obtained a commission; before leaving Dublin\r\nhe appears to have become a member of the Society of United Irishmen,\r\nand in Belfast he soon won the friendship and shared the councils of the\r\npatriotic men who were labouring for Ireland in that city.\r\n\r\nWhile in Belfast, Russell fell into pecuniary embarrassments. His\r\ngenerous and confiding nature induced him to go bail for a false friend,\r\nand he found himself one morning obliged to meet a claim for £200, which\r\nhe had no means of discharging except by the sale of his commission.\r\nRussell sold out and retired to Dungannon, where he lived for some time\r\non the residue of the money thus obtained, and during this period he was\r\nappointed a Justice of the Peace for the county of Tyrone. After a short\r\nexperience of \"Justices' justice\" in the North, he retired from the\r\nbench through motives alike creditable to his head and heart. \"I cannot\r\nreconcile it to my conscience,\" he exclaimed one day, \"to sit on a bench\r\nwhere the practice exists of inquiring what religion a person is before\r\ninvestigating the charge against him.\" Russell returned, after taking\r\nthis step, to Belfast, where he was appointed to a situation in the\r\npublic library of the town, and where he became a regular contributor to\r\nthe organ of the Ulster patriots, the _Northern Star_.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 he was appointed by the United Irishmen to the supreme military\r\ncommand in the county Down, a post for which his military experience not\r\nless than his personal influence fitted him, but his political career\r\nwas soon afterwards interrupted by his arrest on the 26th of September,\r\n1796. Russell was removed to Dublin, and lodged in Newgate Prison; his\r\narrest filled the great heart of Tone, who was then toiling for his\r\ncountry in France, with sorrow and dismay. \"It is impossible,\" he says\r\nin his journal, \"to conceive the effect this misfortune has on my mind.\r\nIf we are not in Ireland in time to extricate him he is lost, for the\r\ngovernment will move heaven and earth to ensure his condemnation. Good\r\nGod!\" he adds, \"if Russell and Neilson fall, where shall I find two\r\nothers to replace them?\" During the eventful months that intervened\r\nbetween the date of his arrest and the 19th of March, 1799, poor Russell\r\nremained chafing his imprisoned soul, filled with patriotic passion and\r\nemotion, in his prison cell in Kilmainham. On the latter date, when the\r\nmajority of his associates were dead, and their followers scattered and\r\ndisheartened, he was transferred to Fort George in Scotland, where he\r\nspent three years more in captivity. The government had no specific\r\ncharge against him, but they feared his influence and distrusted his\r\nintentions, and they determined to keep him a prisoner while a chance\r\nremained of his exerting his power against them. No better illustration\r\nof Russell's character and principles could be afforded than that\r\nsupplied in the following extract from one of the letters written by him\r\nduring his incarceration in Fort George:--\"To the people of Ireland,\" he\r\nwrites, addressing an Irish friend and sympathiser, \"I am responsible\r\nfor my actions; amidst the uncertainties of life this may be my\r\nvaledictory letter; what has occasioned the failure of the cause is\r\nuseless to speculate on--Providence orders all things for the best. _I\r\nam sure the people will never abandon the cause; I am equally sure it\r\nwill succeed_. I trust men will see,\" he adds, referring to the infidel\r\nviews then unhappily prevalent, \"that the only true basis of liberty is\r\nmorality, and the only stable basis of morality is religion.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1802 the government, failing to establish any distinct charge against\r\nRussell, set him at liberty, and he at once repaired to Paris, where he\r\nmet Robert Emmet, who was then preparing to renew the effort of\r\nFitzgerald and Wolfe Tone. Time had not changed, nor suffering damped,\r\nthe patriotic impulses of Thomas Russell; he entered heartily into the\r\nplans of young Emmet, and when the latter left for Ireland in November,\r\n1802, to prosecute his hazardous enterprise, it was with the full\r\nunderstanding that Russell would stand by his side in the post of\r\ndanger, and with him perish or succeed. In accordance with this\r\narrangement, Russell followed Robert Emmet to Dublin, where he arrived\r\nso skilfully disguised that even his own family failed to recognise\r\nhim. Emmet's plans for the outbreak in Dublin were matured when Russell,\r\nwith a trusty companion, was despatched northwards to summon the Ulster\r\nmen to action. Buoyant in spirit, and filled with high expectation, he\r\nentered on his mission, but he returned to Dublin a week later prostrate\r\nin spirit and with a broken heart. One of his first acts on arriving in\r\nBelfast was to issue a proclamation, in which, as \"General-in-Chief of\r\nthe Northern District,\" he summoned the people of Ulster to action.\r\n\r\nThe North, however, refused to act. It was the old, old story. Belfast\r\nresolved on waiting \"to see what the South would do,\" and the South\r\nwaited for Belfast. Disgusted and disappointed, Russell quitted the\r\nNorthern capital and proceeded to Antrim, where at least he thought he\r\nmight expect to find cordial co-operation; but fresh disappointments\r\nawaited him, and with a load of misery at his heart, such as he had\r\nnever felt before, Russell returned to Dublin, where he lived in\r\nseclusion, until arrested by Major Sirr and his myrmidons on the 9th of\r\nSeptember, 1803. A reward of £1,500 had been offered for his\r\napprehension. We learn on good authority that the ruffianly town-major,\r\non arresting him, seized the unfortunate patriot rudely by the\r\nneck-cloth, whereupon, Russell, a far more powerful man than his\r\nassailant, flung him aside, and drawing a pistol, exclaimed--\"I will not\r\nbe treated with indignity.\" Sirr parleyed for a while; a file of\r\nsoldiers was meanwhile summoned to his aid, and Russell was borne off in\r\nirons a prisoner to the Castle. While undergoing this second captivity a\r\nbold attempt was made by his friends to effect his liberation by bribing\r\none of the gaolers; the plot, however, broke down, and Russell never\r\nbreathed the air of freedom again. While awaiting his trial--that trial\r\nwhich he knew could have but one termination, the death of a\r\nfelon--Russell addressed a letter to one of his friends outside, in\r\nwhich the following noble passage, the fittest epitaph to be engraved on\r\nhis tombstone, occurs:--\"I mean to make my trial,\" he writes, \"and the\r\nlast of my life, if it is to close now, as serviceable to the cause of\r\nliberty as I can. _I trust my countrymen will ever adhere to it:_ I know\r\nit will soon prosper. When the country is free,\" he adds--that it would\r\nbe free he never learned to doubt--\"I beg they may lay my remains with\r\nmy father in a private manner, and pay the few debts I owe. I have only\r\nto beg of my countrymen to remember that the cause of liberty is the\r\ncause of virtue, _which I trust they will never abandon_. May God bless\r\nand prosper them, and when power comes into their hands I entreat them\r\nto use it with moderation. May God and the Saviour bless them all.\"\r\n\r\nRussell was taken to Downpatrick, escorted by a strong force of cavalry,\r\nwhere he was lodged in the governor's rooms, preparatory to being tried\r\nin that town by a Special Commission. While in prison in Downpatrick he\r\naddressed a letter to Miss M'Cracken, a sister of Henry Joy M'Cracken,\r\none of the insurgent leaders of 1798, in which he speaks as follows:\r\n\"Humanly speaking, I expect to be found guilty and immediately executed.\r\nAs this may be my last letter, I shall only say that I did my best for\r\nmy country and for mankind. I have no wish to die, but far from\r\nregretting its loss in such a cause, had I a thousand lives I would\r\nwillingly risk or lose them in it. Be assured, liberty will in the midst\r\nof those storms be established, and God will wipe the tears from all\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe sad anticipations expressed by Russell were but too fully borne out.\r\nThere was short shrift in those days for Irishmen accused of treason,\r\nand the verdict of guilty, which he looked forward to with so much\r\nresignation, was delivered before the last rays of the sun which rose on\r\nthe morning of the trial had faded in the gloaming. It was sworn that he\r\nhad attended treasonable meetings and distributed green uniforms; that\r\nhe asked those who attended them, \"if they did not desire to get rid of\r\nthe Sassanaghs;\" that he spoke of 30,000 stands of arms from France, but\r\nsaid if France should fail them, \"forks, spades, shovels, and pickaxes\"\r\nwould serve that purpose. It was useless to struggle against such\r\ntestimony, palpably false and distorted as it was in some parts, and\r\nRussell decided on cutting short the proceedings. \"I shall not trouble\r\nmy lawyers,\" he said, \"to make any statement in my case. There are but\r\nthree possible modes of defence--firstly, by calling witnesses to prove\r\nthe innocence of my conduct; secondly, by calling them to impeach the\r\ncredit of opposite witnesses, or by proving an _alibi_. As I can resort\r\nto none of those modes of defence without involving others, I consider\r\nmyself precluded from any.\" Previous to the Judge's charge, the prisoner\r\nasked--\"If it was not permitted to persons in his situation to say a few\r\nwords, as he wished to give his valedictory advice to his countrymen in\r\nas concise a manner as possible, being well convinced how speedy the\r\ntransition was from that vestibule of the grave to the scaffold.\" He was\r\ntold in reply, \"that he would have an opportunity of expressing\r\nhimself,\" and when the time did come, Russell advanced to the front of\r\nthe dock, and spoke in a clear, firm tone of voice, as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Before I address myself to this audience, I return my sincere thanks\r\n   to my learned counsel for the exertions they have made, in which they\r\n   displayed so much talent. I return my thanks to the gentlemen on the\r\n   part of the crown, for the accommodation and indulgence I have\r\n   received during my confinement. I return my thanks to the gentlemen\r\n   of the jury, for the patient investigation they have afforded my\r\n   case; and I return my thanks to the court, for the attention and\r\n   politeness they have shown me during my trial. As to my political\r\n   sentiments, I shall, in as brief a manner as possible (for I do not\r\n   wish to engross the time of the court), say a few words. I look back\r\n   to the last thirteen years of my life, the period with which I have\r\n   interfered with the transactions of Ireland, with entire\r\n   satisfaction; though for my share in them I am now about to die--the\r\n   gentlemen of the jury having, by their verdict, put the seal of truth\r\n   on the evidence against me. Whether, at this time, and the country\r\n   being situated as it is, it be safe to inflict the punishment of\r\n   death upon me for the offence I am charged with, I leave to the\r\n   gentlemen who conduct the prosecution. My death, perhaps, may be\r\n   useful in deterring others from following my example. It may serve,\r\n   on the other hand, as a memorial to others, and on trying occasions\r\n   it may inspire them with courage. I can now say, as far as my\r\n   judgment enabled me, I acted for the good of my country and of the\r\n   world. It may be presumptuous for me to deliver my opinions here as\r\n   a statesman, but as the government have singled me out as a leader,\r\n   and given me the appellation of 'General,' I am in some degree\r\n   entitled to do so. To me it is plain that all things are verging\r\n   towards a change, when all shall be of one opinion. In ancient times,\r\n   we read of great empires having their rise and their fall, and yet do\r\n   the old governments proceed as if all were immutable. From the time I\r\n   could observe and reflect, I perceived that there were two kinds of\r\n   laws--the laws of the State and the laws of God--frequently clashing\r\n   with each other; by the latter kind, I have always endeavoured to\r\n   regulate my conduct; but that laws of the former kind do exist in\r\n   Ireland I believe no one who hears me can deny. That such laws have\r\n   existed in former times many and various examples clearly evince. The\r\n   Saviour of the world suffered by the Roman laws--by the same laws His\r\n   Apostles were put to the torture, and deprived of their lives in His\r\n   cause. By my conduct I do not consider that I have incurred any moral\r\n   guilt. I have committed no moral evil. I do not want the many and\r\n   bright examples of those gone before me; but did I want this\r\n   encouragement, the recent example of a youthful hero--a martyr in the\r\n   cause of liberty--who has just died for his country, would inspire\r\n   me. I have descended into the vale of manhood. I have learned to\r\n   estimate the reality and delusions of this world; _he_ was surrounded\r\n   by everything which could endear this world to him--in the bloom of\r\n   youth, with fond attachments, and with all the fascinating charms of\r\n   health and innocence; to his death I look back even in this moment\r\n   with rapture. I have travelled much, and seen various parts of the\r\n   world, and I think the Irish are the most virtuous nation on the face\r\n   of the earth--they are a good and brave people, and had I a thousand\r\n   lives I would yield them in their service. If it be the will of God\r\n   that I suffer for that with which I stand charged, I am perfectly\r\n   resigned to His holy will and dispensation. I do not wish to trespass\r\n   much more on the time of those that hear me, and did I do so an\r\n   indisposition which has seized on me since I came into court would\r\n   prevent my purpose. Before I depart from this for a better world I\r\n   wish to address myself to the landed aristocracy of this country. The\r\n   word 'aristocracy' I do not mean to use as an insulting epithet, but\r\n   in the common sense of the expression.\r\n\r\n   \"Perhaps, as my voice may now be considered as a voice crying from\r\n   the grave, what I now say may have some weight. I see around me many,\r\n   who during the last years of my life have disseminated principles for\r\n   which I am now to die. Those gentlemen, who have all the wealth and\r\n   the power of the country in their hands, I strongly advise, and\r\n   earnestly exhort, to pay attention to the poor--by the poor I mean\r\n   the labouring class of the community, their tenantry and dependents.\r\n   I advise them for their good to look into their grievances, to\r\n   sympathize in their distress, and to spread comfort and happiness\r\n   around their dwellings. It might be that they may not hold their\r\n   power long, but at all events to attend to the wants and distresses\r\n   of the poor is their truest interest. If they hold their power, they\r\n   will thus have friends around them; if they lose it, their fall will\r\n   be gentle, and I am sure unless they act thus they can never be\r\n   happy. I shall now appeal to the right honourable gentleman in whose\r\n   hands the lives of the other prisoners are, and entreat that he will\r\n   rest satisfied with my death, and let that atone for those errors\r\n   into which I may have been supposed to have deluded others. I trust\r\n   the gentleman will restore them to their families and friends. If he\r\n   shall do so, I can assure him that the breeze which conveys to him\r\n   the prayers and blessings of their wives and children will be more\r\n   grateful than that which may be tainted with the stench of putrid\r\n   corpses, or carrying with it the cries of the widow and the orphan.\r\n   Standing as I do in the presence of God and of man, I entreat him to\r\n   let my life atone for the faults of all, and that my blood alone may\r\n   flow.\r\n\r\n   \"If I am then to die, I have therefore two requests to make. The\r\n   first is, that as I have been engaged in a work possibly of some\r\n   advantage to the world, I may be indulged with three days for its\r\n   completion; secondly, that as there are those ties which even death\r\n   cannot sever, and as there are those who may have some regard for\r\n   what will remain of me after death, I request that my remains,\r\n   disfigured as they will be, may be delivered after the execution of\r\n   the sentence to those dear friends, that they may be conveyed to the\r\n   ground where my parents are laid, and where those faithful few may\r\n   have a consecrated spot over which they may be permitted to grieve. I\r\n   have now to declare, when about to pass into the presence of Almighty\r\n   God, that I feel no enmity in my mind to any being, none to those who\r\n   have borne testimony against me, and none to the jury who have\r\n   pronounced the verdict of my death.\"\r\n\r\nThe last request of Russell was refused, and he was executed twelve\r\nhours after the conclusion of the trial. At noon, on the 21st of\r\nOctober, 1803, he was borne pinioned to the place of execution. Eleven\r\nregiments of soldiers were concentrated in the town to overawe the\r\npeople and defeat any attempt at rescue; yet even with this force at\r\ntheir back, the authorities were far from feeling secure. The interval\r\nbetween the trial and execution was so short that no preparation could\r\nbe made for the erection of a scaffold, except the placing of some\r\nbarrels under the gateway of the main entrance to the prison, with\r\nplanks placed upon them as a platform, and others sloping up from the\r\nground, by which it was ascended. On the ground hard by, were placed a\r\nsack of sawdust, an axe, a block, and a knife. After ascending the\r\nscaffold, Russell gazed forward through the archway--towards the\r\npeople, whose white faces could be seen glistening outside, and again\r\nexpressed his forgiveness of his persecutors. His manner, we are told,\r\nwas perfectly calm, and he died without a struggle.\r\n\r\nA purer soul, a more blameless spirit, than Thomas Russell, never sunk\r\non the battle-field of freedom. Fixed in principles, and resolute in\r\ndanger, he was nevertheless gentle, courteous, unobstrusive, and humane;\r\nwith all the modesty and unaffectedness of childhood, he united the zeal\r\nof a martyr and the courage of a hero. To the cause of his country he\r\ndevoted all his energies and all his will; and when he failed to render\r\nit prosperous in life, he illumined it by his devotion and steadfastness\r\nin death. The noble speech given above, and the passages from his\r\nletters which we have quoted, are sufficient in themselves to show how\r\nchivalrous was the spirit, how noble the motives of Thomas Russell. The\r\npredictions which he uttered with so much confidence have not indeed\r\nbeen fulfilled, and the success which he looked forward to so hopefully\r\nhas never been won. But his advice, so often repeated in his letters, is\r\nstill adhered to; his countrymen have not yet learned to abandon the\r\ncause in which he suffered, and they still cherish the conviction which\r\nhe so touchingly expressed--\"that liberty will, in the midst of these\r\nstorms be established, and that God will yet wipe off the tears of the\r\nIrish nation.\"\r\n\r\nRussell rests in the churchyard of the Protestant church of Downpatrick.\r\nA plain slab marks the spot where he is laid, and there is on it this\r\nsingle line--\r\n\r\n\"THE GRAVE OF RUSSELL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now closed our reference to the portion of Irish history\r\ncomprised within the years 1798 and 1803, and as far as concerns the men\r\nwho suffered for Ireland in those disastrous days our \"Speeches from the\r\nDock\" are concluded. We leave behind us the struggle of 1798 and the men\r\nwho organized it; we turn from the records of a period reeking with the\r\ngore of Ireland's truest sons, and echoing with the cries and curses of\r\nthe innocent and oppressed; we pass without notice the butcheries and\r\noutrages that filled the land, while our countrymen were being sabred\r\ninto submission; and we leave behind us, too, the short-lived\r\ninsurrection of 1803, and the chivalrous young patriot who perished with\r\nit. We turn to more recent events, less appalling in their general\r\naspect, but not less important in their consequences, or less\r\ninteresting to the present generation, and take up the next link in the\r\nunbroken chain of protests against British rule in Ireland with the\r\nlives and the fortunes of the patriots of 1848. How faithfully the\r\nprinciples of freedom have been handed down--how nobly the men of our\r\nown times have imitated the patriots of the past--how thoroughly the\r\nsentiments expressed from the Green-street dock nineteen years ago\r\ncoincide with the declarations of Tone, of Emmet, and of Russell--our\r\nreaders will shortly have an opportunity of judging. They will see how\r\nall the sufferings and all the calamities that darkened the path of the\r\nmartyrs of '98 were insufficient to deter others, as gifted, as earnest,\r\nand as chivalrous as they, from following in their footsteps; and how\r\nunquenchable and unending, as the altar light of the fire-worshipper,\r\nthe generous glow of patriotic enthusiasm was transmitted through\r\ngenerations, unaffected by the torrents of blood in which it was sought\r\nto extinguish it.\r\n\r\nThe events of our own generation--the acts of contemporary patriots--now\r\nclaim our attention; but we are reluctant as yet to turn over the page,\r\nand drop the curtain on the scenes with which we have hitherto been\r\ndealing, and which we feel we have inadequately described. We have\r\nspoken of the men whose speeches from the dock are on record, but we\r\nstill linger over the history of the events in which they shared, and of\r\nthe men who were associated with them in their endeavours. The patriots\r\nwhose careers we have glanced at are but a few out of the number of\r\nIrishmen who suffered during the same period, and in the same cause, and\r\nwhose actions recommend them to the admiration and esteem of posterity.\r\nConfining ourselves strictly to those whose speeches after conviction\r\nhave reached us, the list could not well be extended; but there are many\r\nwho acted as brave a part, and whose memories are inseparable from the\r\nhistory of the period. We should have desired to speak, were the scope\r\nof our labours more extended, of the brave Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the\r\ngallant and the true, who sacrificed his position, his prospects, and\r\nhis life, for the good old cause, and whose arrest and death contributed\r\nmore largely, perhaps, than any other cause that could be assigned to\r\nthe failure of the insurrection of 1798. Descended from an old and noble\r\nfamily, possessing in a remarkable degree all the attributes and\r\nembellishments of a popular leader, young and spirited, eloquent and\r\nwealthy, ardent, generous, and brave, of good address, and fine physical\r\nproportions, it is not surprising that Lord Edward Fitzgerald became the\r\nidol of the patriot party, and was appointed by them to a leading\r\nposition in the organization. Lord Edward Fitzgerald was born in\r\nOctober, 1763; being the fifth son of James Duke of Leinster, the\r\ntwentieth Earl of Kildare. He grew up to manhood, as a recent writer has\r\nobserved, when the drums of the Volunteers were pealing their marches of\r\nvictory; and under the stirring events of the period his soul burst\r\nthrough the shackles that had long bound down the Irish aristocracy in\r\nservile dependence. In his early years he served in the American War of\r\nIndependence on the side of despotism and oppression--a circumstance\r\nwhich in after years caused him poignant sorrow. He joined the United\r\nIrishmen, about the time that Thomas Addis Emmet entered their ranks,\r\nand the young nobleman threw himself into the movement with all the\r\nardour and energy of his nature. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe National forces in the south, and laboured with indefatigable zeal\r\nin perfecting the plans for the outbreak on the 23rd of May. The story\r\nof his arrest and capture is too well known to need repetition.\r\nTreachery dogged the steps of the young patriot, and after lying for\r\nsome weeks in concealment, he was arrested on the 19th day of May, 1798,\r\ntwo months after his associates in the direction of the movement had\r\nbeen arrested at Oliver Bond's. His gallant struggle with his captors,\r\nfighting like a lion at bay, against the miscreants who assailed him;\r\nhis assassination, his imprisonment, and his death, are events to which\r\nthe minds of the Irish nationalists perpetually recur, and which,\r\ncelebrated in song and story, are told with sympathising regret wherever\r\na group of Irish blood are gathered around the hearth-stone. His genius,\r\nhis talents, and his influence, his unswerving attachment to his\r\ncountry, and his melancholy end, cast an air of romance around his\r\nhistory; and the last ray of gratitude must fade from the Irish heart\r\nbefore the name of the martyred patriot, who sleeps in the vaults of St.\r\nWerburgh, will be forgotten in the land of his birth.\r\n\r\nIn less than a fortnight after Lord Edward expired in Newgate another\r\nIrish rebel, distinguished by his talents, his fidelity, and his\r\nposition, expiated with his life the crime of \"loving his country above\r\nhis king.\" It is hard to mention Thomas Russell and ignore Henry Joy\r\nM'Cracken--it is hard to speak of the Insurrection of '98 and forget the\r\ngallant young Irishman who commanded at the battle of Antrim, and who\r\nperished a few weeks subsequently, in the bloom of his manhood, on the\r\nscaffold in Belfast. Henry Joy M'Cracken was one of the first members of\r\nthe Society of United Irishmen, and he was one of the best. He was\r\narrested, owing to private information received by the government, on\r\nthe 10th of October, 1796--three weeks after Russell, his friend and\r\nconfidant, was flung into prison--and lodged in Newgate Jail, where he\r\nremained until the 8th of September in the following year. He was then\r\nliberated on bail, and immediately, on regaining his liberty, returned\r\nto Belfast, still bent on accomplishing at all hazards the liberation of\r\nhis country. Previous to the outbreak in May, '98, he had frequent\r\ninterviews with the patriot leaders in Dublin, and M'Cracken was\r\nappointed to the command of the insurgent forces in Antrim. Filled with\r\nimpatience and patriotic ardour, he heard of the stirring events that\r\nfollowed the arrest of Lord Edward Fitzgerald; he concentrated all his\r\nenergies in preparing the Northern patriots for action, but\r\ncircumstances delayed the outbreak in that quarter, and it was not until\r\nthe 6th of June, 1798, that M'Cracken had perfected his arrangements for\r\ntaking the field, and issued the following brief proclamation, \"dated\r\nthe first year of liberty, 6th June, 1798,\" addressed to the Army of\r\nUlster:--\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow we march on Antrim. Drive the garrison of Randalstown before\r\nyou, and hasten to form a junction with your Commander-in-Chief.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty-one thousand insurgents were to have rallied at the call of\r\nM'Cracken, out not more than seven thousand responded to the summons.\r\nEven this number, however, would have been sufficient to strike a\r\nsuccessful blow, which would have filled the hearts of the gallant\r\nWexford men, then in arms, with exultation, and effected incalculable\r\nresults on the fate of Ireland, had not the curse of the Irish cause,\r\ntreachery and betrayal, again come to the aid of its enemies. Hardly had\r\nthe plans for the attack on Antrim been perfected, when the secrets of\r\nthe conspirators were revealed to General Nugent, who commanded the\r\nBritish troops in the North, and the defeat of the insurgents was thus\r\nsecured. M'Cracken's forces marched to the attack on Antrim with great\r\nregularity, chorusing the \"Marseillaise Hymn\" as they charged through\r\nthe town. Their success at first seemed complete, but the English\r\ngeneral, acting on the information which had treacherously been supplied\r\nhim, had taken effective means to disconcert and defeat them. Suddenly,\r\nand as it seemed, in the flush of victory, the insurgents found\r\nthemselves exposed to a galling fire from a force posted at either end\r\nof the town; a gallant resistance was offered, but it was vain. The\r\ninsurgents fled from the fatal spot, leaving 500 of their dead and dying\r\nbehind them, and at nightfall Henry Joy M'Cracken found himself a\r\nfugitive and a ruined man. For some weeks he managed to baffle the\r\nbloodhounds on his track, but he was ultimately arrested and tried by\r\ncourt-martial in Belfast, on the 17th July, 1798. On the evening of the\r\nsame day he was executed. We have it on the best authority that he bore\r\nhis fate with calmness, resolution, and resignation. It is not his fault\r\nthat a \"Speech from the Dock\" under his name is not amongst our present\r\ncollection. He had actually prepared one, but his brutal judges would\r\nnot listen to the patriot's exculpation. He was hung, amidst the sobs\r\nand tears of the populace, in front of the Old Market place of Belfast,\r\nand his remains were interred in the graveyard now covered by St.\r\nGeorge's Protestant church.\r\n\r\nLater still in the same year two gallant young officers of Irish blood,\r\nshared the fate of Russell and M'Cracken. They sailed with Humbert from\r\nRochelle; they fought at Castlebar and Ballinamuck; and when the swords\r\nof their French allies were sheathed, they passed into the power of\r\ntheir foes. Matthew Tone was one of them; the other was Bartholomew\r\nTeeling. The latter filled the rank of Etat-major in the French army;\r\nand a letter from his commanding officer, General Humbert, was read at\r\nhis trial, in which the highest praise was given to the young officer\r\nfor the humane exertions which he made throughout his last brief\r\ncampaign in the interest of mercy. \"His hand,\" he said, \"was ever raised\r\nto stay the useless effusion of blood, and his protection was afforded\r\nto the prostrate and defenceless.\" But his military judges paid little\r\nheed to those extenuating circumstances, and Teeling was condemned to\r\ndie on the day of his trial. He perished on the 24th September, 1798,\r\nbeing then in his twenty-fourth year. He marched with a proud step to\r\nthe place of execution on Arbour Hill, Dublin, and he died, as a soldier\r\nmight, with unshaken firmness and unquailing mien. No lettered slab\r\nmarks the place of his interment; and his bones remain in unhallowed and\r\nunconsecrated ground. Hardly had his headless body ceased to palpitate,\r\nwhen it was flung into a hole at the rere of the Royal Barracks. A few\r\ndays later the same unhonoured spot received the mortal remains of\r\nMatthew Tone. \"He had a more enthusiastic nature than any of us,\" writes\r\nhis brother, Theobald Wolfe Tone, \"and was a sincere Republican, capable\r\nof sacrificing everything for his principles.\" His execution was\r\nconducted with infamous cruelty and brutality, and the life-blood was\r\nstill gushing from his body when it was flung into \"the Croppy's Hole.\"\r\n\"The day will come,\" says Dr. Madden, \"when that desecrated spot will be\r\nhallowed ground--consecrated by religion--trod lightly by pensive\r\npatriotism--and decorated by funeral trophies in honour of the dead\r\nwhose bones lie there in graves that are now neglected and unhonoured.\"\r\n\r\nThere are others of the patriot leaders who died in exile, far away from\r\nthe land for which they suffered, and whose graves were dug on alien\r\nshores by the heedless hands of the stranger. This was the fate of Addis\r\nEmmet, of Neilson, and of M'Nevin. In Ireland they were foremost and\r\nmost trusted amongst the gifted and brilliant throng that directed the\r\nlabours and shaped the purposes of the United Irishmen. They survived\r\nthe reign of terror that swallowed up the majority of their compatriots,\r\nand, when milder councils began to prevail, they were permitted to go\r\nforth from the dungeon which confined them into banishment. The vision\r\nof Irish freedom was not permitted to dawn upon them in life; from\r\nbeyond the sandy slopes washed by the Western Atlantic they watched the\r\nfortunes of the old land with hopeless but enduring love. Their talents,\r\ntheir virtues, and their patriotism were not unappreciated by the people\r\namongst whom they spent their closing years of life. In the busiest\r\nthoroughfare of the greatest city of America there towers over the heads\r\nof the by-passers the monument of marble which grateful hands have\r\nraised to the memory of Addis Emmet. In the centre of Western\r\ncivilization, the home of republican liberty, the stranger reads in\r\nglowing words, of the virtues and the fame of the brother of Robert\r\nEmmet, sculptured on the noble pillar erected in Broadway, New York, to\r\nhis memory. Nor was he the only one of his party to whom such an honour\r\nwas accorded. A stone-throw from the spot where the Emmet monument\r\nstands, a memorial not less commanding in its proportions and\r\nappearance, was erected to William James M'Nevin; and the American\r\ncitizen, as he passes through the spacious streets of that city which\r\nthe genius of liberty has rendered prosperous and great, gazes proudly\r\non those stately monuments, which tell him that the devotion to freedom\r\nwhich England punished and proscribed found in his own land the\r\nrecognition which it merited from the gallant and the free.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The inscriptions on the Emmet monument are in three\r\nlanguages--Irish, Latin, and English. The Irish inscription consists of\r\nthe following lines:--\r\n\r\n   Do mhiannaich se ardmath\r\n     Cum tir a breith\r\n   Do thug se clu a's fuair se moladh\r\n     An deig a bais.\r\n\r\nThe following is the English inscription:\r\n\r\n   _In Memory of_\r\n   THOMAS ADDIS EMMET,\r\n\r\n   Who exemplified in his conduct,\r\n   And adorned by his integrity.\r\n   The policy and principles of the\r\n   UNITED IRISHMEN--\r\n\r\n   \"To forward a brotherhood of affection,\r\n   A community of rights, an identity of interests, and a union of power\r\n   Among Irishmen of every religious persuasion,\r\n   As the only means of Ireland's chief good,\r\n   An impartial and adequate representation\r\n   IN AN IRISH PARLIAMENT.\"\r\n\r\n   For this (mysterious fate of virtue) exiled from his native land,\r\n   In America, the land of Freedom,\r\n   He found a second country,\r\n   Which paid his love by reverencing his genius.\r\n   Learned in our laws, and in the laws of Europe,\r\n   In the literature of our times, and in that of antiquity,\r\n   All knowledge seemed subject to his use.\r\n   An orator of the first order, clear, copious, fervid,\r\n   Alike powerful to kindle the imagination, touch the affections,\r\n   And sway the reason and will.\r\n   Simple in his tastes, unassuming in his manners,\r\n   Frank, generous, kind-hearted, and honourable,\r\n   His private life was beautiful,\r\n   As his public course was brilliant.\r\n   Anxious to perpetuate\r\n   The name and example of such a man,\r\n   Alike illustrious by his genius, his virtues, and his fate;\r\n   Consecrated to their affections by his sacrifices, his perils,\r\n   And the deeper calamities of his kindred,\r\n   IN A JUST AND HOLY CAUSE;\r\n   His sympathising countrymen\r\n   Erected this Monument and Cenotaph.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MITCHEL\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the melancholy tragedy of 1803, a period of indescribable\r\ndepression was experienced in Ireland. Defeat, disaster, ruin, had\r\nfallen upon the national cause; the power on whose friendly aid so much\r\nreliance had been placed was humbled, and England stood before the world\r\nin the full blaze of triumph and glory. Her fleet was undisputed\r\nmistress of the ocean, having swept it of all hostile shipping, and left\r\nto the enemy little more than the small craft that sheltered in narrow\r\ncreeks and under the guns of well-defended harbours. Her army, if not\r\nnumerically large, had proved its valour on many a well-fought field,\r\nand shown that it knew how to bring victory to light upon its standards;\r\nand, what was not less a matter of wonder to others, and of pride to\r\nherself, the abundance of her wealth and the extent of her resources\r\nwere shown to be without a parallel in the world. Napoleon was an exile\r\non the rock of St. Helena; the \"Holy Alliance\"--as the European,\r\nsovereigns blasphemously designated themselves--were lording it over the\r\nsouls and bodies of men by \"right divine;\" the free and noble principles\r\nin which the French Revolution had its origin were now sunk out of\r\nsight, covered with the infamy of the Reign of Terror and the\r\nresponsibility of the series of desolating wars which had followed it,\r\nand no man dared to speak for them. Those were dark days for Ireland.\r\nHer parliament was gone, and in the blighting shade of the provincialism\r\nto which she was reduced, genius and courage seemed to have died out\r\nfrom the land. Thousands of her bravest and most devoted children had\r\nperished in her cause--some on the scaffold, and others on the field of\r\nbattle--and many whose presence at home would have been invaluable to\r\nher were obliged to seek safety in exile. So Erin, the crownless Queen,\r\nsat in the dust with fetters on her limbs, her broken sword fallen from\r\nher hand, and with mournful memories lying heavy on her heart. The\r\nfeelings of disappointment and grief then rankling in every Irish\r\nbreast are well mirrored in that plaintive song of our national poet,\r\nwhich open with these tristful lines:---\r\n\r\n   \"'Tis gone, and for ever, the light we saw breaking,\r\n     Like heaven's first dawn o'er the sleep of the dead,\r\n   When man, from the slumber of ages awaking,\r\n     Looked upward and blessed the pure ray ere it fled.\r\n   'Tis gone, and the gleams it has left of its burning\r\n     But deepen the long night of bondage and mourning,\r\n   That dark o'er the kingdoms of earth is returning,\r\n     And darkest of all, hapless Erin, o'er thee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM S. O'BRIEN. JOHN MITCHEL. JOHN MARTIN.]\r\n\r\nIn this gloomy condition of affairs there was nothing for Irish\r\npatriotism to do except to seek for the removal, by constitutional\r\nmeans, of some of the cruel grievances that pressed on the people.\r\nEmancipation of the Catholics from the large remainder of the penal laws\r\nthat still degraded and despoiled them was one of the baits held out by\r\nMr. Pitt when playing his cards for the Union; but not long had the\r\nIrish parliament been numbered with the things that were, when it became\r\nevident that the minister was in no hurry to fulfil his engagement, and\r\nit was found necessary to take some steps for keeping him to his\r\npromise. Committees were formed, meetings were held, speeches were made,\r\nresolutions were adopted, and all the machinery of parliamentary\r\nendeavour was put in motion. The leaders of the Catholic cause in this\r\ncase, like those of the national cause in the preceding years, were\r\nliberal-minded Protestant gentlemen; but as time wore on, a young\r\nbarrister from Kerry, one of the old race and the old faith, took a\r\ndecided lead amongst them, and soon became its recognised champion, the\r\nelect of the nation, the \"man of the people.\" Daniel O'Connell stood\r\nforth, with the whole mass of his Catholic countrymen at his back, to\r\nwage within the lines of the constitution this battle for Ireland. He\r\nfought it resolutely and skilfully; the people supported him with an\r\nunanimity and an enthusiasm that were wonderful; their spirit rose and\r\nstrengthened to that degree that the probability of another civil war\r\nbegan to loom up in the near future--inquiries instituted by the\r\ngovernment resulted in the discovery that the Catholics serving in the\r\narmy, and who constituted at least a third of its strength, were in full\r\nsympathy with their countrymen on this question, and could not be\r\ndepended on to act against them--the ministry recognised the critical\r\ncondition of affairs, saw that there was danger in delay, yielded to the\r\npopular demand--and Catholic Emancipation was won.\r\n\r\nThe details of that brilliant episode of Irish history cannot be told\r\nwithin the limits of this work, but some of its consequences concern us\r\nvery nearly. The triumph of the constitutional struggle for Catholic\r\nEmancipation confirmed O'Connell in the resolution he had previously\r\nformed, to promote an agitation for a Repeal of the Union, and\r\nencouraged him to lay the proposal before his countrymen. The forces\r\nthat had wrung the one measure of justice from an unwilling parliament\r\nwere competent, he declared, to obtain the other. He soon succeeded in\r\nimpressing his own belief on the minds of his countrymen, whose\r\nconfidence in his wisdom and his powers was unbounded. The whole country\r\nresponded to his call, and soon \"the Liberator,\" as the emancipated\r\nIrish Catholics loved to call him, found himself at the head of a\r\npolitical organization which in its mode of action, its extent, and its\r\nardour was \"unique in the history of the world.\" Every city and great\r\ntown in Ireland had its branch of the Repeal Association--every village\r\nhad its Repeal reading-room, all deriving hope and life, and taking\r\ndirection from the head-quarters in Dublin, where the great Tribune\r\nhimself \"thundered and lightened\" at the weekly meetings. All Ireland\r\nechoed with his words. Newspapers, attaining thereby to a circulation\r\nnever before approached in Ireland, carried them from one extremity of\r\nthe land to the other--educating, cheering, and inspiring the hearts of\r\nthe long downtrodden people. Nothing like this had ever occurred before.\r\nThe eloquence of the patriot orators of the Irish parliament had not\r\nbeen brought home to the masses of the population; and the United\r\nIrishmen could only speak to them secretly, in whispers. But here were\r\naddresses glowing, and bold, and tender, brimful of native humour,\r\nscathing in their sarcasms, terrible in their denunciations, ineffably\r\nbeautiful in their pathos--addresses that recalled the most glorious as\r\nwell as the saddest memories of Irish history, and presented brilliant\r\nvistas of the future--addresses that touched to its fullest and most\r\ndelicious vibration every chord of the Irish heart--here they were being\r\nsped over the land in an unfailing and ever welcome supply. The peasant\r\nread them to his family by the fireside when his hard day's work was\r\ndone, and the fisherman, as he steered his boat homeward, reckoned as\r\nnot the least of his anticipated pleasures, the reading of the last\r\nreport from Conciliation Hall. And it was not the humbler classes only\r\nwho acknowledged the influence of the Repeal oratory, sympathised with\r\nthe movement, and enrolled themselves in the ranks. The priesthood\r\nalmost to a man, were members of the Association and propagandists of\r\nits principles; the professional classes were largely represented in it;\r\nof merchants and traders it could count up a long roll; and many of the\r\nlanded gentry, even though they held her Majesty's Commission of the\r\nPeace, were amongst its most prominent supporters. In short, the Repeal\r\nAssociation represented the Irish nation, and its voice was the voice of\r\nthe people. The \"Monster Meetings\" of the year 1843 put this fact beyond\r\nthe region of doubt or question. As popular demonstrations they were\r\nwonderful in their numbers, their order, and their enthusiasm.\r\nO'Connell, elated by their success, fancied that his victory was as good\r\nas won. He knew that things could not continue to go on as they were\r\ngoing--either the government or the Repeal Association should give way,\r\nand he believed the government would yield. For, the Association, he\r\nassured his countrymen, was safe within the limits of the law, and not a\r\nhostile hand could be laid upon it without violating the constitution.\r\nHis countrymen had nothing to do but obey the law and support the\r\nAssociation, and a Repeal of the Union within a few months was, he said,\r\ninevitable. In all this he had allowed his own heart to deceive him;\r\nand his mistake was clearly shown, when in October, 1843, the\r\ngovernment, by proclamation and a display of military force, prevented\r\nthe intended monster meeting at Clontarf. It was still more fully\r\nestablished in the early part of the following year, when he, with a\r\nnumber of his political associates, was brought to trial for treasonable\r\nand seditious practices, found guilty, and sentenced to twelve months'\r\nimprisonment. The subsequent reversal of the verdict by the House of\r\nLords, was a legal triumph for O'Connell; but nevertheless, his prestige\r\nhad suffered by the occurrence, and his policy had begun to pall upon\r\nthe minds of the people.\r\n\r\nAfter his release the business of the Association went on as before,\r\nonly there was less of confidence and of defiance in the speeches of the\r\nLiberator, and there were no more monster meetings. He was now more\r\nemphatic than ever in his advocacy of moral force principles, and his\r\ncondemnation of all warlike hints and allusions. The weight of age--he\r\nwas then more than seventy years--was pressing on his once buoyant\r\nspirit; his prison experience had damped his courage; and he was haunted\r\nnight and day by a conviction--terrible to his mind--that there was\r\ngrowing up under the wing of the Association, a party that would teach\r\nthe people to look to an armed struggle as the only sure means of\r\nobtaining the freedom of their country. The writings of the\r\n_Nation_--then a new light in the literature and politics of\r\nIreland--had a ring in them that was unpleasant to his ears, a sound as\r\nof clashing steel and the explosion of gunpowder. In the articles of\r\nthat journal much honour was given to men who had striven for Irish\r\nfreedom by other methods than those in favour at Conciliation Hall; and\r\nthe songs and ballads which it was giving to the youth of Ireland--who\r\nreceived them with delight, treasuring every line \"as if an angel\r\nspoke\"--were bright with the spirit of battle, and taught any doctrine\r\nexcept the sinfulness of fighting for liberty. The Liberator grew\r\nfearful of that organ and of the men by whom it was conducted. He\r\ndistrusted that quiet-faced, thoughtful, and laborious young man, whom\r\nthey so loved and reverenced--the founder, the soul, and the centre of\r\ntheir party. To the keen glance of the aged leader it appeared that for\r\nall that placid brow, those calm grey eyes and softly curving lip of\r\nhis, the man had no horror of blood-spilling in a righteous cause, and\r\nwas capable not only of deliberately inciting his countrymen to rise in\r\narms against English rule, but also of taking a foremost place in the\r\nstruggle. And little less to be dreaded than Thomas Davis, was his\r\nfriend and _collaborateur_, Charles Gavan Duffy, whose sharp and active\r\nintellect and resolute spirit were not in the least likely to allow the\r\nnational cause to rest for ever on the peaceful platform of Conciliation\r\nHall. Death removed Davis early from the scene; but in John Mitchel, who\r\nhad taken his place, there was no gain to the party of moral force. Then\r\nthere was that other young firebrand--that dapper, well-built,\r\nwell-dressed, curled and scented young gentleman from the _Urbs\r\nIntacta_--whose wondrous eloquence, with the glow of its thought, the\r\nbrilliancy and richness of its imagery, and the sweetness of its\r\ncadences, charmed and swayed all hearts--adding immensely to the dangers\r\nof the situation. O'Brien, too, staid and unimpulsive as was his\r\ncharacter, deliberate and circumspect as were his habits, was evidently\r\ninclined to give the weight of his name and influence to this \"advanced\"\r\nparty. And there were many less prominent, but scarcely less able men\r\ngiving them the aid of their great talents in the press and on the\r\nplatform--not only men, but women too. Some of the most inspiriting of\r\nthe strains that were inducing the youth of the country to familiarize\r\nthemselves with steel blades and rifle barrels proceeded from the pens\r\nof those fair and gifted beings. Day after day, as this party sickened\r\nof the stale platitudes, and timid counsels, and crooked policy of the\r\nHall, O'Connell, his son John, and other leading members of the\r\nAssociation, insisted more and more strongly on their doctrine of moral\r\nforce, and indulged in the wildest and most absurd denunciations of the\r\nprinciple of armed resistance to tyranny. \"The liberty of the world,\"\r\nexclaimed O'Connell, \"is not worth the shedding of one drop of human\r\nblood.\" Notwithstanding the profound disgust which the utterance of such\r\nsentiments caused to the bolder spirits in the Association, they would\r\nhave continued within its fold, if those debasing principles had not\r\nbeen actually formulated into a series of resolutions and proposed for\r\nthe acceptance of the Society. Then they rose against the ignoble\r\ndoctrine which would blot the fair fame of all who ever fought for\r\nliberty in Ireland or elsewhere, and rank the noblest men the world ever\r\nsaw in the category of fools and criminals. Meagher, in a brilliant\r\noration, protested against the resolutions, and showed why he would not\r\n\"abhor and stigmatize the sword.\" Mr. John O'Connell interrupted and\r\ninterfered with the speaker. It was plain that freedom of speech was to\r\nbe had no longer on the platform of the Association, and that men of\r\nspirit had no longer any business there--Meagher took up his hat and\r\nleft the Hall, and amongst the crowd that accompanied, him, went William\r\nSmith O'Brien, Thomas Devin Reilly, Charles Gavan Duffy, and John\r\nMitchel.\r\n\r\nAfter this disruption, which occurred on the 28th of July, 1846, came\r\nthe formation of the \"Irish Confederation\" by the seceders. In the\r\nproceedings of the new Society Mr. Mitchel took a more prominent part\r\nthan he had taken in the business of the Repeal Association. And he\r\ncontinued to write in his own terse and forcible style in the _Nation_.\r\nBut his mind travelled too fast in the direction of war for either the\r\njournal or the society with which he was connected. The desperate\r\ncondition of the country, now a prey to all the horrors of famine, for\r\nthe awfully fatal effects of which the government was clearly\r\nresponsible--the disorganization and decay of the Repeal party,\r\nconsequent on the death of O'Connell--the introduction of Arms' Acts and\r\nother coercive measures by the government, and the growing ardour of the\r\nConfederate Clubs, were to him as signs and tokens unmistakable that\r\nthere was no time to be lost in bringing matters to a crisis in which\r\nthe people should hold their own by force of arms. Most of his political\r\nassociates viewed the situation with more patience; but Mr. Mitchel was\r\nresolved that even if he stood alone, he would speak out his opinions to\r\nthe people. In the latter part of December, 1847, he withdrew from the\r\n_Nation_. On the 5th of February, 1848, at the close of a debate, which\r\nhad lasted two days, on the merits of his policy of immediate resistance\r\nto the collection of rates, rents, and taxes, and the division on which\r\nwas unfavourable to him, he, with a number of friends and sympathisers\r\nwithdraw from the Confederation. Seven days afterwards, he issued the\r\nfirst number of a newspaper, bearing the significant title of _The\r\nUnited Irishman_, and having for its motto the following aphorism,\r\nquoted from Theobald Wolfe Tone: \"Our independence must be had at all\r\nhazards. If the men of property will not support us, they must fall; we\r\ncan support ourselves by the aid of that numerous and respectable class\r\nof the community, the men of no property.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Nation_ had been regarded as rather an outspoken journal, and not\r\nparticularly well affected to the rulers of the country. But it was\r\nmildness, and gentleness, and loyalty itself compared to the new-comer\r\nin the field of journalism. The sudden uprising of a most portentous\r\ncomet sweeping close to this planet of ours could hardly create more\r\nunfeigned astonishment in the minds of people in general than did the\r\nappearance of this wonderful newspaper, brimful of open and avowed\r\nsedition, crammed with incitements to insurrection, and with diligently\r\nprepared instructions for the destruction of her Majesty's troops,\r\nbarracks, stores, and magazines. Men rubbed their eyes, as they read its\r\narticles and correspondence, scarcely believing that any man in his\r\nsober senses would venture, in any part of the Queen's dominions, to put\r\nsuch things in print. But there were the articles and the letters,\r\nnevertheless, on fair paper and in good type, published in a duly\r\nregistered newspaper bearing the impressed stamp of the Customs--a sign\r\nto all men that the proprietor was bound in heavy sureties to the\r\ngovernment against the publication of \"libel, blasphemy, or\r\nsedition\"!--couched, moreover, in a style of language possessing such\r\ngrace and force, such delicacy of finish, and yet such marvellous\r\nstrength, rich with so much of quiet humour, and bristling with such\r\nrasping sarcasm and penetrating invective, that they were read as an\r\nintellectual luxury even by men who regarded as utterly wild and wicked\r\nthe sentiments they conveyed. The first editorial utterance in this\r\njournal consisted of a letter from Mr. Mitchel to the Viceroy, in which\r\nthat functionary was addressed as \"The Right Hon. the Earl of Clarendon,\r\nEnglishman, calling himself her Majesty's Lord Lieutenant-General and\r\nGeneral Governor of Ireland.\" The purport of the document was to\r\ndeclare, above board, the aims and objects of the _United Irishman_, a\r\njournal with which, wrote Mr. Mitchel, \"your lordship and your\r\nlordship's masters and servants are to have more to do than may be\r\nagreeable either to you or me.\" That that purpose was to resume the\r\nstruggle which had been waged by Tone and Emmet, or, as Mr. Mitchel put\r\nit, \"the Holy War, to sweep this island clear of the English name and\r\nnation.\" \"We differ,\" he said, \"from the illustrious conspirators of\r\n'98, not in principle--no, not an _iota_--but, as I shall presently show\r\nyou, materially as to the mode of action.\" And the difference was to\r\nconsist in this--that whereas the revolutionary organization in\r\nNinety-Eight was a secret one, which was ruined by spies and informers,\r\nthat of Forty-Eight was to be an open one, concerning which informers\r\ncould tell nothing that its promoters would not willingly proclaim from\r\nthe house-tops. \"If you desire,\" he wrote, \"to have a Castle detective\r\nemployed about the _United Irishman_ office in Trinity-street, I shall\r\nmake no objection, provided the man be sober and honest. If Sir George\r\nGrey or Sir William Somerville would like to read our correspondence, we\r\nmake him welcome for the present--only let the letters be forwarded\r\nwithout losing a post.\" Of the fact that he would speedily be called to\r\naccount for his conduct in one of her Majesty's courts of law, the\r\nwriter of this defiant language was perfectly cognizant; but he declared\r\nthat the inevitable prosecution would be his opportunity of achieving a\r\nvictory over the government. \"For be it known to you,\" he wrote, \"that\r\nin such a case you shall either publicly, boldly, notoriously _pack a\r\njury_, or else see the accused rebel walk a free man out of the court of\r\nQueen's Bench--which will be a victory only less than the rout of your\r\nlordship's red-coats in the open field.\" In case of his defeat, other\r\nmen would take up the cause, and maintain it until at last England would\r\nhave to fall back on her old system of courts-martial, and triangles,\r\nand free quarters, and Irishmen would find that there was no help for\r\nthem \"in franchises, in votings, in spoutings, in shoutings, and toasts\r\ndrank with enthusiasm--nor in anything in this world, save the\r\n_extensor_ and _contractor_ muscles of their right arms, in\r\nthese and in the goodness of God above.\" The conclusion of this\r\nextraordinary address to her Majesty's representative was in the\r\nfollowing terms:--\r\n\r\n   \"In plain English, my Lord Earl, the deep and irreconcilable\r\n   disaffection of this people to all British laws, lawgivers, and law\r\n   administrators shall find a voice. That holy Hatred of foreign\r\n   dominion which nerved our noble predecessors fifty years ago for the\r\n   dungeon, the field, or the gallows (though of late years it has worn\r\n   a vile nisi prius gown, and snivelled somewhat in courts of law and\r\n   on spouting platforms) still lives, thank God! and glows as fierce\r\n   and hot as ever. To educate that holy Hatred, to make it know itself,\r\n   and avow itself, and, at last, fill itself full, I hereby devote the\r\n   columns of the _United Irishman_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this address to the Lord Lieutenant, Mr. Mitchel took to\r\naddressing the farming classes, and it is really a study to observe the\r\nexquisite precision, the clearness, and the force of the language he\r\nemployed to convey his ideas to them. In his second letter he supposes\r\nthe case of a farmer who has the entire produce of his land in his\r\nhaggard, in the shape of six stacks of corn; he shows that three of\r\nthese ought, in all honour and conscience, be sufficient for the\r\nlandlord and the government to seize upon, leaving the other three to\r\nsupport the family of the man whose labour had produced them. But what\r\nare the facts?--the landlord and the government sweep _all_ away, and\r\nthe peasant and his family starve by the ditch sides. As an illustration\r\nof this condition of things, he quotes from a southern paper an account\r\nof an inquest held on the body of a man named Boland, and on the bodies\r\nof his two daughters, who, as the verdict declared, had \"died of cold\r\nand starvation,\" although occupants of a farm of over twenty acres in\r\nextent. On this melancholy case the comment of the editor of the _United\r\nIrishman_ was as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Now what became of poor Boland's twenty acres of crop? Part of it\r\n   went to Gibraltar, to victual the garrison; part to South Africa, to\r\n   provision the robber army; part went to Spain, to pay for the\r\n   landlord's wine; part to London, to pay the interest of his honour's\r\n   mortgage to the Jews. The English ate some of it; the Chinese had\r\n   their share; the Jews and the Gentiles divided it amongst them--and\r\n   there was _none_ for Boland.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the manner in which the condition and fate of poor Boland were to\r\nbe avoided, abundant instructions were given in every number. The\r\nanti-tithe movement was quoted as a model to begin with; but, of course,\r\nthat was to be improved upon. The idea that the people would not\r\nventure on such desperate movements, and had grown enamoured of the\r\nPeace policy and of \"Patience and Perseverance,\" Mr. Mitchel refused to\r\nentertain for a moment:--\r\n\r\n   \"I will not believe that Irishmen are so degraded and utterly lost as\r\n   this. The Earth is awakening from sleep; a flash of electric fire is\r\n   passing through the dumb millions. Democracy is girding himself once\r\n   more like a strong man to run a race; and slumbering nations are\r\n   arising in their might, and 'shaking their invincible locks.' Oh! my\r\n   countrymen, look up, look up! Arise from the death-dust where you\r\n   have long been lying, and let this light visit your eyes also, and\r\n   touch your souls. Let your ears drink in the blessed words, 'Liberty!\r\n   Fraternity! Equality!' which are soon to ring from pole to pole!\r\n   Clear steel will, ere long, dawn upon you in your desolate darkness;\r\n   and the rolling thunder of the People's cannon will drive before it\r\n   many a heavy cloud that has long hidden from you the face of heaven.\r\n   Pray for that day; and preserve life and health that you may worthily\r\n   meet it. Above all, let the man amongst you who has no gun sell his\r\n   garment and buy one.\"\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Mitchel went on for some weeks, preaching in earnest and exciting\r\nlanguage the necessity of preparation for an immediate grapple with \"the\r\nenemy.\" In the midst of his labours came the startling news of another\r\nrevolution in France, Louis Philippe in full flight, and the\r\nproclamation of a Republic. Yet a few days more and the Berliners had\r\nrisen and triumphed, only stopping short of chasing their king away\r\nbecause he conceded all they were pleased to require of him; then came\r\ninsurrection in Sicily, insurrection in Lombardy, insurrection in Milan,\r\ninsurrection in Hungary--in short, the revolutionary movement became\r\ngeneral throughout Europe, and thrones and principalities were tumbling\r\nand tottering in all directions. Loud was the complaint in the _United\r\nIrishman_ because Dublin was remaining tranquil. It was evident,\r\nhowever, that the people and their leaders were feeling the\r\nrevolutionary impulse, and that matters were fast hurrying towards an\r\noutbreak. John Mitchel knew that a crisis was at hand, and devoted all\r\nhis energies to making the best use of the short time that his newspaper\r\nhad to live. His writing became fiercer, more condensed, and more\r\npowerful than ever. Lord Clarendon was now addressed as \"Her Majesty's\r\nExecutioner General and General Butcher of Ireland,\" and instructions\r\nfor street warfare and all sorts of operations suitable for an insurgent\r\npopulace occupied a larger space than ever in his paper. But the\r\ngovernment were now resolved to close with their bold and clever enemy.\r\nOn Tuesday, the 21st of March, 1848, Messrs. O'Brien, Meagher, and\r\nMitchel were arrested, the former for seditious speeches, uttered at a\r\nmeeting of the Confederation held on the 15th of that month, the latter\r\nfor three seditious articles published in the _United Irishman_. All\r\nwere released on bail, and when the trials came on, in the month of May,\r\ndisagreements of the jury took place in the cases of O'Brien and\r\nMeagher. But before the trial of Mr. Mitchel could be proceeded with, he\r\nwas arrested on a fresh charge of \"treason-felony\"--a new crime, which\r\nhad been manufactured by Act of Parliament a few weeks before. He was,\r\ntherefore, fast in the toils, and with but little chance of escape.\r\nLittle concern did this give the brave-hearted patriot, who only hoped\r\nand prayed that at last the time had come when his countrymen would\r\nlaunch out upon the resolute course of action which he had so earnestly\r\nrecommended to them. From his cell in Newgate, on the 16th of May, he\r\naddressed to them one of his most exciting letters, of which the\r\nfollowing are the concluding passages:--\r\n\r\n   \"For me, I abide my fate joyfully; for I know that, whatever betide\r\n   me, my work is nearly done. Yes; Moral Force and 'Patience and\r\n   Perseverance' are scattered to the wild winds of heaven. The music my\r\n   countrymen now love best to hear is the rattle of arms and the ring\r\n   of the rifle. As I sit here and write in my lonely cell, I hear, just\r\n   dying away, the measured tramp of ten thousand marching men--my\r\n   gallant confederates, unarmed and silent, but with hearts like bended\r\n   bow, waiting till _the time_ comes. They have marched past my prison\r\n   windows, to let me know there are ten thousand fighting men in\r\n   Dublin--'felons' in heart and soul.\r\n\r\n   \"I thank God for it. The game is afoot at last. The liberty of\r\n   Ireland may come sooner or later, by peaceful negotiation or bloody\r\n   conflict--but it is _sure_; and wherever between the poles I may\r\n   chance to be, I will hear the crash of the downfall of the\r\n   thrice-accursed British Empire.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday, May 22nd, 1848, the trial of Mr. Mitchel commenced in the\r\nCommission Court, Green-street, before Baron Lefroy. He was eloquently\r\ndefended by the veteran lawyer and uncompromising patriot, Robert\r\nHolmes, the brother-in-law of Robert Emmet. The mere law of the case was\r\nstrong against the prisoner, but Mr. Holmes endeavoured to raise the\r\nminds of the jury to the moral view of the case, upon which English\r\njuries have often acted regardless of the letter of the Act of\r\nParliament. With a jury of Irishmen impartially chosen it would have\r\nbeen a good defence, but the Castle had made sure of their men in this\r\ncase. At five o'clock on the evening of the 26th, the case went to the\r\njury, who, after an absence of two hours, returned into court with a\r\nverdict of \"Guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThat verdict was a surprise to no one. On the day the jury was\r\nempanelled, the prisoner and every one else knew what it was to be. It\r\nwas now his turn to have a word to say for himself, and he spoke, as was\r\nhis wont, in plain terms, answering thus the question that had been put\r\nto him:--\r\n\r\n   \"I have to say that I have been found guilty by a packed jury--by the\r\n   jury of a partizan sheriff--by a jury not empanelled even according\r\n   to the law of England. I have been found guilty by a packed jury\r\n   obtained by a juggle--a jury not empanelled by a sheriff but by a\r\n   juggler.\"\r\n\r\nThis was touching the high sheriff on a tender place, and he immediately\r\ncalled out for the protection of the court. Whereupon Baron Lefroy\r\ninterposed, and did gravely and deliberately, as is the manner of\r\njudges, declare that the imputation which had just been made on the\r\ncharacter of that excellent official, the high sheriff, was most\r\n\"unwarranted and unfounded.\" He adduced, however, no reason in support\r\nof that declaration--not a shadow of proof that the conduct of the\r\naforesaid official was fair or honest--but proceeded to say that the\r\njury had found the prisoner guilty on evidence supplied by his own\r\nwritings, some of which his lordship, with a proper expression of horror\r\non his countenance, proceeded to read from his notes. In one of the\r\nprisoner's publications, he said, there appeared the following passage\r\n\"There is now growing on the soil of Ireland a wealth of grain, and\r\nroots, and cattle, far more than enough to sustain in life and comfort\r\nall the inhabitants of the island. That wealth must not leave us another\r\nyear, not until every grain of it is fought for in every stage, from the\r\ntying of the sheaf to the loading of the ship; and the effort necessary\r\nto that simple act of self-preservation will at one and the same blow\r\nprostrate British dominion and landlordism together.\" In reference to\r\nthis piece of writing, and many others of a similar nature, his lordship\r\nremarked that no effort had been made to show that the prisoner was not\r\nresponsible for them; it was only contended that they involved no moral\r\nguilt. But the law was to be vindicated; and it now became his duty to\r\npronounce the sentence of the court, which was--that the prisoner be\r\ntransported beyond the seas for a term of fourteen years. The severity\r\nof the sentence occasioned general surprise; a general suspiration and\r\nlow murmur were heard through the court. Then there was stillness as of\r\ndeath, in the midst of which the tones of John Mitchel's voice rang out\r\nclearly, as he said:--\r\n\r\n   \"The law has now done its part, and the Queen of England, her crown\r\n   and government in Ireland are now secure, pursuant to act of\r\n   parliament. I have done my part also. Three months ago I promised\r\n   Lord Clarendon, and his government in this country, that I would\r\n   provoke him into his courts of justice, as places of this kind are\r\n   called, and that I would force him publicly and notoriously to pack a\r\n   jury against me to convict me, or else that I would walk a free man\r\n   out of this court, and provoke him to a contest in another field. My\r\n   lord, I knew I was setting my life on that cast, but I knew that in\r\n   either event the victory should be with me, and it is with me.\r\n   Neither the jury, nor the judges, nor any other man in this court\r\n   presumes to imagine that it is a criminal who stands in this dock.\"\r\n\r\nHere there were murmurs of applause, which caused the criers to call out\r\nfor \"Silence!\" and the police to look fiercely on the people around\r\nthem. Mr. Mitchel resumed:--\r\n\r\n   \"I have shown what the law is made of in Ireland. I have shown that\r\n   her Majesty's government sustains itself in Ireland by packed juries,\r\n   by partizan judges, by perjured sheriffs.\"\r\n\r\nBaron Lefroy interposed. The court could not sit there to hear the\r\nprisoner arraign the jurors, the sheriffs, the courts, and the tenure by\r\nwhich Englands holds this country. Again the prisoner spoke:--\r\n\r\n   \"I have acted all through this business, from the first, under a\r\n   strong sense of duty. I do not repent anything that I have done, and\r\n   I believe that the course which I have opened is only commenced. The\r\n   Roman who saw his hand burning to ashes before the tyrant, promised\r\n   that three hundred should follow out his enterprise. Can I not\r\n   promise for one, for two, for three, aye for hundreds?\"\r\n\r\nAs he uttered these words, Mr. Mitchel looked proudly into the faces of\r\nthe friends near him, and around the court. His words and his glance\r\nwere immediately responded to by an outburst of passionate voices from\r\nall parts of the building, exclaiming--\"For me! for me! promise for me,\r\nMitchel! and for me!\" And then came a clapping of hands and a stamping\r\nof feet, that sounded loud and sharp as a discharge of musketry,\r\nfollowed by a shout like a peal of thunder. John Martin, Thomas Francis\r\nMeagher, and Devin Reilly, with other gentlemen who stood close by the\r\ndock, reached over it to grasp the hand of the new made felon. The\r\naspect of affairs looked alarming for a moment. The policemen laid\r\nviolent hands on the persons near them and pulled them about. Mr.\r\nMeagher and Mr. Doheny were taken into custody. Baron Lefroy, in a high\r\nstate of excitement, cried out--\"Officer! remove Mr. Mitchel!\" and then,\r\nwith his brother judges, retired hurriedly from the bench. The turnkeys\r\nwho stood in the dock with Mr. Mitchel motioned to him that he was to\r\nmove; he took a step or two down the little stairs under the flooring of\r\nthe court-house, and his friends saw him no more.\r\n\r\nHe was led through the passages that communicated with the adjoining\r\nprison, and ushered into a dark and narrow cell, in which, however, his\r\ndetention was of but a few hours' duration: At four o'clock in the\r\nevening of that day--May 27th, 1848--the prison van, escorted by a large\r\nforce of mounted police and dragoons, with drawn sabres, drove up to the\r\nprison gate. It was opened, and forth walked John Mitchel--_in fetters_.\r\nA heavy chain was attached to his right leg by a shackle at the ankle;\r\nthe other end was to have been attached to the left leg, but as the\r\njailors had not time to effect the connexion when the order came for the\r\nremoval of the prisoner, they bade him take it in his hand, and it was\r\nin this plight, with a festoon of iron from his hand to his foot, he\r\npassed from the prison into the street--repeating mayhap to his own\r\nheart, the words uttered by Wolfe Tone in circumstances not\r\ndissimilar:--\"For the cause which I have embraced, I feel prouder to\r\nwear these chains, than if I were decorated with the star and garter of\r\nEngland.\" Four or five police inspectors assisted him to step into the\r\nvan, the door was closed after him, the word was given to the escort,\r\nand off went the cavalcade at a thundering pace to the North-wall, where\r\na government steamer, the \"Shearwater,\" was lying with her steam up in\r\nreadiness to receive him. He clambered the side-ladder of the steamer\r\nwith some assistance; on reaching the deck, the chains tripped him and\r\nhe fell forward. Scarcely was he on his feet again, when the paddles of\r\nthe steamer were beating; the water, and the vessel was moving from the\r\nshores of that \"Isle of Destiny,\" which he loved so well, and a sight of\r\nwhich has never since gladdened the eyes of John Mitchel.\r\n\r\nThe history of Mr. Mitchel's subsequent career, which has been an\r\neventful one, does not rightly fall within the scope of this work.\r\nSuffice it to say that on June the 1st, 1848, he was placed on board the\r\n\"Scourge\" man-of-war, which then sailed off for Bermuda. There Mr.\r\nMitchel was retained on board a penal ship, or \"hulk,\" until April 22nd,\r\n1849, when he was transferred to the ship \"Neptune,\" on her way from\r\nEngland to the Cape of Good Hope, whither she was taking a batch of\r\nBritish convicts. Those convicts the colonists at the Cape refused to\r\nreceive into their country, and a long struggle ensued between them and\r\nthe commander of the \"Neptune,\" who wished to deposit his cargo\r\naccording to instructions. The colonists were willing to make an\r\nexception in the case of Mr. Mitchel, but the naval officer could not\r\nthink of making any compromise in the matter. The end of the contest was\r\nthat the vessel, with her cargo of convicts on board, sailed on February\r\n19th, 1850, for Van Dieman's Land, where she arrived on April 7th of the\r\nsame year. In consideration of the hardships they had undergone by\r\nreason of their detention at the Cape, the government granted a\r\nconditional pardon to all the criminal convicts on their arrival at\r\nHobart Town. It set them free on the condition that they should not\r\nreturn to the \"United Kingdom.\" Mr. Mitchel and the other political\r\nconvicts were less mercifully treated. It was not until the year 1854\r\nthat a similar amount of freedom was given to these gentlemen. Some\r\nmonths previous to the arrival of Mr. Mitchel at Hobart Town, his\r\nfriends William Smith O'Brien, John Martin, Thomas F. Meagher, Kevin\r\nIzod O'Doherty, Terence Bellew MacManus, and Patrick O'Donoghue, had\r\nreached the same place, there to serve out the various terms of\r\ntransportation to which they had been sentenced. All except Mr. O'Brien,\r\nwho had refused to enter into these arrangements, were at that time on\r\nparole--living, however, in separate and limited districts, and no two\r\nof them nearer than thirty or forty miles. On his landing from the\r\n\"Neptune,\" Mr. Mitchel, in consideration of the delicate state of his\r\nhealth, was allowed to reside with Mr. Martin in the Bothwell district.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year 1853, a number of Irish gentlemen in America,\r\ntook measures to effect the release of one or more of the Irish patriots\r\nfrom Van Dieman's Land, and Mr. P.J. Smyth sailed from New York on that\r\npatriotic mission. Arrived in Van Dieman's Land, the authorities, who\r\nseemed to have suspition of his business, placed him under arrest, from\r\nwhich he was released after three days' detention. The friends soon\r\nmanaged to meet and come to an understanding as to their plan of future\r\noperations, in conformity with which, Mr. Mitchel penned the following\r\nletter to the governor of the island:--\r\n\r\n   \"Bothwell, 8th June, 1853.\r\n\r\n   \"SIR--I hereby resign the 'comparative liberty,' called\r\n   'ticket-of-leave,' and revoke my parole of honour. I shall forthwith\r\n   present myself before the police magistrate of Bothwell, at his\r\n   police office, show him this letter, and offer myself to be taken\r\n   into custody. I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n   \"JOHN MITCHEL.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day, June the 9th, Mr. Mitchel and Mr. Smyth went to the\r\npolice office, saw the magistrate with his attending constables; handed\r\nhim the letter, waited until he had read its contents, addressed to him\r\na verbal statement to the same effect, and while he appeared to be\r\nparalyzed with astonishment, and uncertain what to do, touched their\r\nhats to him and left the office. Chase after them was vain, as they had\r\nmounted a pair of fleet steeds after leaving the presence of his\r\nworship; but it was not until six weeks afterwards that they were able\r\nto get shipping and leave the island. On the 12th of October, 1853, Mr.\r\nMitchel was landed safe in California--to the intense delight of his\r\ncountrymen throughout the American States, who celebrated the event by\r\nmany joyful banquets.\r\n\r\nSince then, Mr. Mitchel has occupied himself mainly with the press. He\r\nstarted the _Citizen_ in New York, and subsequently, at Knoxville,\r\nTennessee, the _Southern Citizen_. As editor of the _Richmond Examiner_\r\nduring the American civil war, he ably supported the Southern cause, to\r\nwhich he gave a still stronger pledge of his attachment in the services\r\nand the lives of two of his brave sons. One of these gentlemen, Mr.\r\nWilliam Mitchel, was killed at the battle of Gettysburg; the other,\r\nCaptain John Mitchel, who had been placed in command of the important\r\nposition of Fort Sumter, was shot on the parapet of that work, on July\r\n19th, 1864. Shortly after the close of the war, Mr. John Mitchel was\r\ntaken prisoner by the Federal government; but after undergoing an\r\nimprisonment of some months his release was ordered by President\r\nJohnson, acting on the solicitation of a large and influential\r\ndeputation of Irishmen. In the latter part of the year 1867, turning to\r\nthe press again, he started the _Irish Citizen_ at New York, and in that\r\njournal, at the date of this writing, he continues to wield his\r\ntrenchant pen on behalf of the Irish cause. To that cause, through all\r\nthe lapse of time, and change of scene, and vicissitude of fortune which\r\nhe has known, his heart has remained for ever true. He has suffered much\r\nfor it; that he may live to see it triumphant is a prayer which finds an\r\necho in the hearts of all his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nWe have written of Mr. Mitchel only in reference to his political\r\ncareer; but we can, without trenching in any degree on the domain of\r\nprivate life, supply some additional and authentic details which will be\r\nof interest to Irish readers. The distinguished subject of our memoir\r\nwas born at Camnish, near Dungiven, in the county of Derry, on the 3rd\r\nof November, 1815. His father was the Rev. John Mitchel, at that time\r\nPresbyterian Minister of Dungiven, and a good patriot, too, having\r\nbeen--as we learn from a statement casually made by Mr. Mitchel in\r\nConciliation Hall--one of the United Irishmen of 1798. The maiden name\r\nof his mother, who also came of a Presbyterian and county Derry family,\r\nwas Mary Haslitt. At Newry, whither the Rev. Mr. Mitchel removed in the\r\nyear 1823, and where he continued to reside till his death in 1843,\r\nyoung John Mitchel was sent to the school of Dr. David Henderson, from\r\nwhich he entered Trinity College, Dublin, about the year 1830 or 1831.\r\nHe did not reside within the college, but kept his terms by coming up\r\nfrom the country to attend the quarterly examinations. Though he did not\r\ndistinguish himself in his college course, and had paid no more\r\nattention to the books prescribed for his studies than seemed necessary\r\nfor passing his examinations respectably, John Mitchel was known to his\r\nintimate friends to be a fine scholar and possessed of rare ability.\r\nWhile still a college student, he was bound apprentice to a solicitor in\r\nNewry. Before the completion of his apprenticeship, in the year 1835, he\r\nmarried Jane Verner, a young lady of remarkable beauty, and only sixteen\r\nyears of age at the time, a daughter of Captain James Verner. Not long\r\nafter his marriage he entered into partnership in his profession, and in\r\nconformity with the arrangements agreed upon, went to reside at\r\nBanbridge, a town ten miles north of Newry, where he continued to\r\npractice as a solicitor until the death of Thomas Davis in 1845. He had\r\nbeen an occasional contributor to the _Nation_ almost from the date of\r\nits foundation; its editors recognised at once his splendid literary\r\npowers, and when the \"Library of Ireland\" was projected, pressed him to\r\nwrite one of the volumes, suggesting as his subject the Life of Hugh\r\nO'Neill. How ably he fulfilled the task is known to his countrymen, who\r\nrightly regard the volume as one of the most valuable of the whole\r\nseries. When death removed the amiable and gifted Thomas Davis from the\r\nscene of his labours, Mr. Duffy invited John Mitchel, as the man most\r\nworthy of all in Ireland, to take his place. Mr. Mitchel regarded the\r\ninvitation as the call of his country. He gave up his professional\r\nbusiness in Banbridge, removed with his wife and family to Dublin, and\r\nthere throwing himself heart and soul into the cause, fought it out\r\nboldly and impetuously until the day when, bound in British chains, \"the\r\nenemy\" bore him off from Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MARTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the law had consummated its crime, and the doom of the felon was\r\npronounced against John Mitchel, there stood in the group that pressed\r\nround him in the dock and echoed back the assurances which he flung as a\r\nlast defiance at his foes, a thoughtful, delicate looking, but resolute\r\nyoung Irishman, whose voice perhaps was not the loudest of those that\r\nspoke there, but whose heart throbbed responsively to his words, and for\r\nwhom the final message of the unconquerable rebel possessed a meaning\r\nand significance that gave it the force of a special revelation.\r\n\"Promise for me, Mitchel,\" they cried out, but he had no need to join in\r\nthat request; he had no need to intimate to Mr. Mitchel his willingness\r\nto follow out the enterprise which that fearless patriot had so boldly\r\ncommenced. On the previous day, sitting with the prisoner in his gloomy\r\ncell, John Martin of Loughorne had decided on the course which he would\r\ntake in the event of the suppression of the _United Irishman_ and the\r\ntransportation of its editor. He would start a successor to that\r\njournal, and take the place of his dear friend at the post of danger. It\r\nwas a noble resolve, deliberately taken, and resolutely and faithfully\r\nwas it carried out. None can read the history of that act of daring, and\r\nof the life of sacrifice by which it has been followed, and not agree\r\nwith us that while the memories of Tone, of Emmet, and of Russell, are\r\ncherished in Ireland, the name of John Martin ought not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nA few days subsequent to that memorable scene in Greenstreet\r\ncourt-house, John Martin quitted his comfortable home and the green\r\nslopes of Loughorne, separated himself from the friends he loved and\r\nthe relatives who idolized him, and entered on the stormy career of a\r\nnational leader and journalist, at a time when to advocate the\r\nprinciples of nationality was to incur the ferocious hostility of a\r\ngovernment whose thirst for vengeance was only whetted by the\r\ntransportation of John Mitchel. He knew the danger he was braving; he\r\nknew that the path on which he entered led down to suffering and ruin;\r\nhe stood in the gap from which Mitchel had been hurled, with a full\r\nconsciousness of the perils of the situation; but unflinchingly and\r\nunhesitatingly as the martyr goes to his death, he threw himself into\r\nthe thinning ranks of the patriot leaders; and when the event that he\r\nanticipated arrived, and the prison gates opened to receive him--then,\r\ntoo, in the midst of indignities and privations--he displayed an\r\nimperturbable firmness and contempt for physical suffering, that showed\r\nhow powerless persecution is to subdue the spirit that self-conscious\r\nrighteousness sustains.\r\n\r\nHis history previous to the conviction of his friend and school-fellow,\r\nJohn Mitchel, if it includes no events of public importance, possesses\r\nfor us all the interest that attaches to the early life of a good and\r\nremarkable man. John Martin was born at Loughorne, in the lordship of\r\nNewry, Co. Down, on the 8th of September, 1812; being the eldest son of\r\nSamuel Martin and Jane Harshaw, both natives of that neighbourhood, and\r\nmembers of Presbyterian families settled there for many generations.\r\nAbout the time of his birth, his father purchased the fee-simple of the\r\nlarge farm which he had previously rented, and two of his uncles having\r\nmade similar investments, the family became proprietors of the townland\r\non which they lived. Mr. Samuel Martin, who died in 1831, divided his\r\nattention between the management of the linen business--a branch of\r\nindustry in which the family had partly occupied themselves for some\r\ngenerations--and the care of his land. His family consisted of nine\r\nchildren, of whom John Martin--the subject of our sketch--was the second\r\nborn. The principles of his family, if they could not be said to possess\r\nthe hue of nationality, were at least liberal and tolerant. In '98, the\r\nMartins of Loughorne, were stern opponents of the United Irishmen; but\r\nin '82, his father and uncles were enrolled amongst the volunteers, and\r\nthe Act of Union was opposed by them as a national calamity. It was from\r\nhis good mother, however, a lady of refined taste and remarkable mental\r\nculture, that young John derived his inclination for literary pursuits,\r\nand learned the maxims of justice and equality that swayed him through\r\nlife. He speedily discarded the prejudices against Catholic\r\nEmancipation, which were not altogether unknown amongst his family, and\r\nwhich even found some favour with himself in the unreflecting days of\r\nboyhood. The natural tendency of his mind, however, was as true to the\r\nprinciples of justice as the needle to the pole, and the quiet rebuke\r\nthat one day fell from his uncle--\"What! John, would you not give your\r\nCatholic fellow-countrymen the same rights that you enjoy yourself?\"\r\nhaving set him a thinking for the first time on the subject, he soon\r\nformed opinions more in consonance with liberality and fair play.\r\n\r\nWhen about twelve years of age, young Martin was sent to the school of\r\nDr. Henderson at Newry, where he first became acquainted with John\r\nMitchel, then attending the same seminary as a day scholar. We next find\r\nJohn Martin an extern student of Trinity College, and a year after the\r\ndeath of his father he took out his degree in Arts. He was now twenty\r\nyears old, and up to this time had suffered much from a constitutional\r\naffection, being subject from infancy to fits of spasmodic asthma.\r\nStrange to say, the disease which troubled him at frequently recurring\r\nintervals at home, seldom attacked him when away from Loughorne, and\r\npartly for the purpose of escaping it, he took up his residence in\r\nDublin in 1833, and devoted himself to the study of medicine. He never\r\nmeditated earning his living by the profession, but he longed for the\r\nopportunity of assuaging the sufferings of the afflicted poor. The air\r\nof the dissecting-room, however, was too much for Martin's delicate\r\nnervous organization; the kindly encouragement of his fellow-students\r\nfailed to induce him to breathe its fetid atmosphere a second time, and\r\nhe was forced to content himself with a theoretical knowledge of the\r\nprofession. By diligent study and with the assistance of lectures,\r\nanatomical plates, &c., he managed to conquer the difficulty; and he had\r\nobtained nearly all the certificates necessary for taking out a medical\r\ndegree, when he was recalled in 1835 to Loughorne, by the death of his\r\nuncle John, whose house and lands he inherited.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years following he lived at Loughorne, discharging the\r\nduties of a resident country gentleman as they are seldom performed in\r\nIreland, and endearing himself to all classes, but particularly to the\r\npoor, by his gentle disposition, purity of mind, and benevolence of\r\nheart. In him the afflicted and the poverty-stricken ever found a\r\nsympathising friend, and if none of the rewards which the ruling faction\r\nwere ready to shower on the Irishman of his position who looked to the\r\nCastle for inspiration, fell to his share, he enjoyed a recompense more\r\nprecious in the prayers and the blessings of the poor. The steps of his\r\ndoor were crowded with the patients who flocked to him for advice, and\r\nfor whom he prescribed gratuitously--not without some reluctance,\r\nhowever, arising from distrust of his own abilities and an unwillingness\r\nto interfere with the practice of the regular profession. But the\r\ndiffidence with which he regarded his own efforts was not shared by the\r\npeople of the district. Their faith in his professional skill was\r\nunbounded, and perhaps the confidence which they felt in his power,\r\ncontributed in some measure to the success that attended his practice.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Mr. Martin sailed from Bristol to New York, and travelled thence\r\nto the extreme west of Upper Canada to visit a relative who had settled\r\nthere. On that occasion he was absent from Ireland nearly twelve months,\r\nand during his stay in America he made some tours in Canada and the\r\nNorthern States, visiting the Falls, Toronto, Montreal, Philadelphia,\r\nNew York, Washington, Pittsburg, and Cleveland. In 1841 he made a brief\r\ncontinental tour, and visited the chief points of attraction along the\r\nRhine. During this time Mr. Martin's political ideas became developed\r\nand expanded, and though like Smith O'Brien, he at first withheld his\r\nsympathies from the Repeal agitation, in a short time he became\r\nimpressed with the justice of the national demand for independence. His\r\nretiring disposition kept him from appearing very prominently before the\r\npublic; but the value of his adhesion to the Repeal Association was felt\r\nto be great by those who knew his uprightness, his disinterestedness,\r\nand his ability.\r\n\r\nWhen the suicidal policy of O'Connell drove the Confederates from\r\nConciliation Hall, John Martin was not a silent spectator of the crisis,\r\nand in consequence of the manly sentiments he expressed with reference\r\nto the treatment to which the Young Ireland party had been subjected, he\r\nceased to be a member of the Association. There was another cause too\r\nfor his secession. A standing taunt in the mouth of the English press\r\nwas that O'Connell pocketed the peoples' money and took care to let\r\nnobody know what he did with it. To put an end to this reproach Mr.\r\nMartin asked that the accounts of the Association should be published.\r\n\"Publish the accounts!\" shrieked the well-paid gang that marred the\r\ninfluence and traded in the politics of O'Connell: \"Monstrous!\" and they\r\nsilenced the troublesome purist by suppressing his letters and expelling\r\nhim from the Association. In the ranks of the Confederates, however,\r\nMartin found more congenial society; amongst them he found men as\r\nearnest, as sincere, and as single-minded as himself, and by them the\r\nfull worth of his character was soon appreciated. He frequently attended\r\ntheir meetings, and he it was who filled the chair during the prolonged\r\ndebates that ended with the temporary withdrawal of Mitchel from the\r\nConfederation. When the _United Irishman_ was started he became a\r\ncontributor to its columns, and he continued to write in its pages up to\r\nthe date of its suppression, and the conviction of its editor and\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nThere were many noble and excellent qualities which the friends of John\r\nMartin knew him to possess. Rectitude of principle, abhorrence of\r\ninjustice and intolerance, deep love of country, the purity and\r\nearnestness of a saint, allied with the kindliness and inoffensiveness\r\nof childhood; amiability and disinterestedness, together with a perfect\r\nabnegation of self, and total freedom from the vanity which affected a\r\nfew of his compatriots--these they gave him credit for, but they were\r\ntotally unprepared for the lion-like courage, the boldness, and the\r\npromptitude displayed by him, when the government, by the conviction of\r\nMitchel, flung down the gauntlet to the people of Ireland. Hastily\r\nsettling up his worldly accounts in the North, he returned to Dublin to\r\nstake his fortune and his life in the cause which he had promised to\r\nserve. The _United Irishman_ was gone, but Martin had undertaken that\r\nits place in Irish Journalism should not be vacant; and a few weeks\r\nafter the office in Trinity-street was sacked he reoccupied the violated\r\nand empty rooms, and issued there-from the first number of the _Irish\r\nFelon_. There was no halting place in Irish Journalism then. The\r\n_Nation_ had already flung peace and conciliation and \"balmy\r\nforgiveness\" to the winds, and advocated the creed of the sword. The\r\nscandalous means used to procure a verdict of guilty against Mitchel\r\ntore to tatters the last rag of the constitution in Ireland. It was idle\r\nto dictate observance of the law which the government themselves were\r\nengaged in violating, and the _Nation_ was not the journal to brook the\r\ntyranny of the authorities. With a spirit that cannot be too highly\r\npraised, it called for the overthrow of the government that had sent\r\nMitchel in chains into banishment, and summoned the people of Ireland to\r\nprepare to assert their rights by the only means now left them--the\r\nbullet and the pike. And the eyes of men whose hearts were \"weary\r\nwaiting for the fray,\" began to glisten as they read the burning words\r\nof poetry and prose in which the _Nation_ preached the gospel of\r\nliberty. It was to take its side by that journal, and to rival it in the\r\nboldness of its language and the spirit of its arguments, that the\r\n_Irish Felon_ was established; and it executed its mission well. \"I do\r\nnot love political agitation for its own sake,\" exclaimed Martin, in\r\nhis opening address in the first number. \"At best I regard it as a\r\nnecessary evil; and if I were not convinced that my countrymen are\r\ndetermined on vindicating their rights, and that they really intend to\r\nfree themselves, I would at once withdraw from the struggle and leave my\r\nnative land for ever. I could not live in Ireland and derive my means of\r\nlife as a member of the Irish community, without feeling a citizen's\r\nresponsibilities in Irish public affairs. Those responsibilities involve\r\nthe guilt of national robbery and murder--of a system which arrays the\r\nclasses of our people against each other's prosperity and very lives,\r\nlike beasts of prey, or rather like famishing sailors on a wreck--of the\r\ndebasement and moral ruin of a people endowed by God with surpassing\r\nresources for the attainment of human happiness and human dignity. I\r\ncannot be loyal to a system of meanness, terror, and corruption,\r\nalthough it usurp the title and assume the form of a 'government.' So\r\nlong as such a 'government' presumes to injure and insult me, and those\r\nin whose prosperity I am involved, I must offer to it all the resistance\r\nin my power. But if I despaired of successful resistance, I would\r\ncertainly remove myself from under such a 'government's' actual\r\nauthority; that I do not exile myself is a proof that I hope to witness\r\nthe overthrow, and assist in the overthrow, of the most abominable\r\ntyranny the world now groans under--the British Imperial system. To gain\r\npermission for the Irish people to care for their own lives, their own\r\nhappiness and dignity--to abolish the political conditions which compel\r\nthe classes of our people to hate and to murder each other, and which\r\ncompel the Irish people to hate the very name of the English--to end the\r\nreign of fraud, perjury, corruption, and 'government' butchery, and to\r\nmake, law, order, and peace possible in Ireland, the _Irish Felon_ takes\r\nits place amongst the combatants in the holy war now waging in this\r\nisland against foreign tyranny. In conducting it my weapons shall\r\nbe--_the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me\r\nGod_!\" Such \"open and avowed treason\" as this could not long continue\r\nto be published. Before the third number the _Felon_ saw the light, a\r\nwarrant for Mr. Martin's arrest was in the hands of the detectives, and\r\nits fifth was its last. On Saturday, July 8th, Mr. Martin surrendered\r\nhimself into custody, having kept out of the way for a few days to\r\nprevent his being tried, under the \"gagging act,\" at the Commission\r\nsitting when the warrant was issued, and which adjourned until\r\nAugust--the time fixed for the insurrection--in the interim. On the same\r\nday, Duffy, Williams, and O'Doherty were arrested. Martin was imprisoned\r\nin Newgate, but he continued to write from within his cell for the\r\n_Felon_, and its last number, published on July 22nd, contains a\r\nspirited letter signed with his initials, which formed portion of the\r\nindictment against him on his trial. In this letter, Martin calls on his\r\ncountrymen in impassioned words to \"stand to their arms!\" \"Let them\r\nmenace you,\" he writes from his dungeon, \"with the hulks or the gibbet\r\nfor daring to speak or write your love to Ireland. Let them threaten to\r\nmow you down with grape shot, as they massacred your kindred with famine\r\nand plague. Spurn their brutal 'Acts of Parliament'--trample upon their\r\nlying proclamations--fear them not!\"\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, August 15th, John Martin's trial commenced in Green-street\r\ncourt-house, the indictment being for treason-felony. \"Several of his\r\ntenantry,\" writes the Special Correspondent of the London _Morning\r\nHerald,_ \"came up to town to be present at his trial, and, as they\r\nhoped, at his escape, for they could not bring themselves to believe\r\nthat a man so amiable, so gentle, and so pious, as they had long known\r\nhim, could be\"--this is the Englishman's way of putting it--\"an inciter\r\nto bloodshed. It is really melancholy,\" added the writer, \"to hear the\r\npoor people of the neighbourhood of Loughorne speak of their benefactor.\r\nHe was ever ready to administer medicine and advice gratuitously to his\r\npoor neighbours and all who sought his assistance; and according to the\r\nreports I have received, he did an incalculable amount of good in his\r\nway. As a landlord he was beloved by his tenantry for his kindness and\r\nliberality, while from his suavity of manner and excellent qualities, he\r\nwas a great favourite with the gentry around him.\"\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock, p.m., on Thursday, August 17th, the jury came into\r\ncourt with a verdict of guilty against the prisoner, recommending him to\r\nmercy on the grounds that the letter on which he was convicted was\r\nwritten from the prison, and penned under exciting circumstances. On the\r\nfollowing day, Mr. Martin was brought up to receive sentence, and\r\nasked--after the usual form--whether he had anything to say against the\r\nsentence being pronounced? The papers of the time state that he appeared\r\nperfectly unmoved by the painful position in which he was placed--that\r\nhe looked round the courthouse in a calm, composed, dignified manner,\r\nand then spoke the following reply in clear unfaltering tones:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords--I have no imputation to cast upon the bench, neither have\r\n   I anything to charge the jury with, of unfairness towards me. I think\r\n   the judges desired to do their duty honestly as upright judges and\r\n   men; and that the twelve men who were put into the box, as I believe,\r\n   not to try, but to convict me, voted honestly, according to their\r\n   prejudices. I have no personal enmity against the sheriff,\r\n   sub-sheriff, or any of the gentlemen connected with the arrangement\r\n   of the jury-panel--nor against the Attorney-General, nor any other\r\n   person engaged in the proceedings called my trial; _but, my lords, I\r\n   consider that I have not been yet tried_. There have been certain\r\n   formalities carried on here for three days regarding me, ending in a\r\n   verdict of guilty: _but I have not been put upon my country_, as the\r\n   constitution said to exist in Ireland requires. Twelve of my\r\n   countrymen, 'indifferently chosen,' have not been put into that\r\n   jury-box to try me, but twelve men who, I believe, have been selected\r\n   by the parties who represent the crown, for the purpose of convicting\r\n   and not of trying me. I believe they were put into that box because\r\n   the parties conducting the prosecution knew their political\r\n   sentiments were hostile to mine, and because the matter at issue here\r\n   is a political question--a matter of opinion, and not a matter of\r\n   fact. I have nothing more to say as to the trial, except to repeat\r\n   that, having watched the conduct of the judges, I consider them\r\n   upright and honest men. I have this to add, that as to the charge I\r\n   make with respect to the constitution of the panel and the selection\r\n   of the jury, I have no legal evidence of the truth of my statement,\r\n   but there is no one who has a moral doubt of it. Every person knows\r\n   that what I have stated is the fact; and I would represent to the\r\n   judges, most respectfully, that they, as upright and honourable men\r\n   and judges, and as citizens, ought to see that the administration of\r\n   justice in this country is above suspicion. I have nothing more to\r\n   say with regard to the trial; but I would be thankful to the court\r\n   for permission to say a few words in vindication of my character and\r\n   motives after sentence is passed.\"\r\n\r\n   Baron Pennefather--\"No; we will not hear anything from you after\r\n   sentence.\"\r\n\r\n   Chief Baron--\"We cannot hear anything from you after sentence has\r\n   been pronounced.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. Martin--\"Then, my lords, permit me to say that, admitting the\r\n   narrow and confined constitutional doctrines which I have heard\r\n   preached in this court to be right, _I am not guilty of the charge\r\n   according to this act_. I did not intend to devise or levy war\r\n   against the Queen or to depose the Queen. In the article of mine on\r\n   which the jury framed their verdict of guilty, which was written in\r\n   prison, and published in the last number of my paper, what I desired\r\n   to do was this--to advise and encourage my countrymen to keep their\r\n   arms, because that is their inalienable right, which no act of\r\n   parliament, no proclamation, can take away from them. It is, I\r\n   repeat, their inalienable right. I advised them to keep their arms;\r\n   and further, I advised them to use their arms in their own defence,\r\n   against all assailants--even assailants that might come to attack\r\n   them, unconstitutionally and improperly using the Queen's name as\r\n   their sanction. My object in all my proceedings has been simply to\r\n   assist in establishing the national independence of Ireland, for the\r\n   benefit of all the people of Ireland--noblemen, clergymen, judges,\r\n   professional men--in fact, all Irishmen. I have sought that object:\r\n   first, because I thought it was our right--because I think national\r\n   independence is the right of the people of this country; and\r\n   secondly, I admit that, being a man who loved retirement, I never\r\n   would have engaged in politics did I not think it was necessary to do\r\n   all in my power to make an end of the horrible scenes that this\r\n   country presents--the pauperism, starvation, and crime, and vice, and\r\n   hatred of all classes against each other. I thought there should be\r\n   an end to that horrible system, which, while it lasted, gave me no\r\n   peace of mind; for I could not enjoy anything in my native country so\r\n   long as I saw my countrymen forced to be vicious--forced to hate each\r\n   other--and degraded to the level of paupers and brutes. That is the\r\n   reason I engaged in politics. I acknowledge, as the Solicitor-General\r\n   has said, that I was but a weak assailant of the English power. I am\r\n   not a good writer, and I am no orator. I had only two weeks'\r\n   experience in conducting a newspaper until I was put into jail; but I\r\n   am satisfied to direct the attention of my countrymen to everything I\r\n   have written and said, and to rest my character on a fair and candid\r\n   examination of what I have put forward as my opinions. I shall say\r\n   nothing in vindication of my motives but this--that every fair and\r\n   honest man, no matter how prejudiced he may be, if he calmly\r\n   considers what I have written and said, will be satisfied that my\r\n   motives were pure and honourable. I have nothing more to say.\"\r\n\r\nThen the judge proceeded to pass sentence. In the course of his remarks\r\nhe referred to the recommendation to mercy which came from the jury,\r\nwhereupon Mr. Martin broke in. \"I beg your lordship's pardon,\" he said,\r\n\"I cannot condescend to accept 'mercy,' where I believe I have been\r\nmorally right; I want justice--not mercy.\" But he looked for it in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Transportation for ten years beyond the seas\" is spoken by the lips of\r\nthe judge, and the burlesque of justice is at an end. Mr. Martin heard\r\nthe sentence with perfect composure and self-possession, though the\r\nfaces of his brothers and friends standing by, showe signs of the\r\ndeepest emotion. \"Remove the prisoner,\" were the next words uttered, and\r\nthen John Martin, the pure-minded, the high-souled, and the good, was\r\nborne off to the convict's cell in Newgate.\r\n\r\nAmongst the friends who clustered round the dock in which the patriot\r\nleader stood, and watched the progress of his trial with beating hearts,\r\nwas Mr. James Martin, one of the prisoner's brothers. During the three\r\nlong weary days occupied by the trial, his post had been by his\r\nbrother's side listening to the proceedings with the anxiety and\r\nsolicitude which a brother alone can feel, and revealing by every line\r\nof his countenance the absorbing interest with which he regarded the\r\nissue. The verdict of the jury fell upon him with the bewildering shock\r\nof an avalanche. He was stunned, stupified, amazed; he could hardly\r\nbelieve that he had heard the fatal words aright, and that \"guilty\" had\r\nbeen the verdict returned. _He_ guilty! he whose life was studded by\r\ngood deeds as stars stud the wintry sky; _he_ guilty, whose kindly heart\r\nhad always a throb for the suffering and the unfortunate, whose hand was\r\never extended to shield the oppressed, to succour the friendless, and to\r\nshelter the homeless and the needy; _he_ \"inspired by the devil,\" whose\r\ncareer had been devoted to an attempt to redress the sufferings of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, and whose sole object in life seemed to be to\r\nabridge the sufferings of the Irish people, to plant the doctrines of\r\npeace and good-will in every heart, and to make Ireland the home of\r\nharmony and concord, by rendering her prosperous and free. It was a lie,\r\na calumny, a brutal fabrication! It was more than his sense of justice\r\ncould endure, it was more than his hot Northern blood could tolerate.\r\nBeckoning a friend, he rushed with him into the street, and drove direct\r\nto the residence of Mr. Waterhouse, the foreman of the jury. The latter\r\nhad barely returned from court, when he was waited upon by Mr. Martin,\r\nwho indignantly charged him with having bullied the jury into recording\r\na verdict of guilty--an accusation which current report made against\r\nhim--and challenged the astonished juryman to mortal combat. Mr.\r\nWaterhouse was horror-struck by the proposal, to which he gasped out in\r\nresponse, a threat to call in the police. He never heard of anything so\r\nterribly audacious. He, a loyal Castle tradesman, who had \"well and\r\ntruly\" tried the case according to the recognised acceptance of the\r\nwords, and who had \"true deliverance made\" after the fashion in favour\r\nwith the crown; he whose \"perspicuity, wisdom, impartiality,\" &c., had\r\nbeen appealed to and belauded so often by the Attorney-General, to be\r\nchallenged to a hostile meeting, which might end, by leaving a bullet\r\nlodged in his invaluable body. The bare idea of it fairly took his\r\nbreath away, and with the terrible vision of pistols and bloodshed\r\nbefore his mind, he rushed to the police office and had his indignant\r\nvisitor arrested. On entering the Green-street courthouse next day, Mr.\r\nWaterhouse told his woeful story to the judge. The judge was appalled by\r\nthe disclosure; Mr. Martin was brought before him and sentenced to a\r\nmonth's imprisonment, besides being bound over to keep the peace towards\r\nMr. Waterhouse and everyone else for a period of seven years.\r\n\r\nA short time after Mr. John Martin's conviction, he and Kevin Izod\r\nO'Doherty were shipped off to Van Diemen's Land on board the\r\n\"Elphinstone,\" where they arrived in the month of November, 1849.\r\nO'Brien, Meagher, MacManus, and O'Donoghue had arrived at the same\r\ndestination a few days before. Mr. Martin resided in the district\r\nassigned to him until the year 1854, when a pardon, on the condition of\r\ntheir not returning to Ireland or Great Britain was granted to himself,\r\nO'Brien, and O'Doherty, the only political prisoners in the country at\r\nthat time--MacManus, Meagher, O'Donoghue, and Mitchel having previously\r\nescaped. Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Martin sailed together in the \"Norna\" from\r\nMelbourne for Ceylon, at which port they parted, Mr. O'Brien turning\r\nnorthward to Madras, while Mr. Martin came on _via_ Aden, Cairo,\r\nAlexandria, Malta, and Marseilles to Paris, where he arrived about the\r\nend of October, 1854. In June, 1856, the government made the pardon of\r\nMessrs. Martin, O'Brien, and O'Doherty, unconditional, and Mr. Martin\r\nthen hastened to pay a visit to his family from whom he had been\r\nseparated during eight years. After a stay of a few months he went back\r\nto Paris, intending to reside abroad during the remainder of his life,\r\nbecause he could not voluntarily live under English rule in Ireland. But\r\nthe death of a near and dear member of his family, in October, 1858,\r\nimposed on him duties which he could only discharge by residence in his\r\nown home, and compelled him to terminate his exile. Living since then in\r\nhis own land he has taken care to renew and continue his protest against\r\nthe domination of England in Ireland. In January, 1864, acting on the\r\nsuggestion of many well-known nationalists, he established in Dublin a\r\nRepeal Association called \"The National League.\" The peculiar condition\r\nof Irish politics at the time was unfavourable to any large extension of\r\nthe society; but notwithstanding this circumstance the League by its\r\nmeetings and its publications rendered good service to the cause of\r\nIrish freedom. Mr. Martin has seen many who once were loud and earnest\r\nin their professions of patriotism lose heart and grow cold in the\r\nservice of their country, but he does not weary of the good work.\r\nPatiently and zealously he still continues to labour in the national\r\ncause; his mission is not ended yet; and with a constancy which lapse of\r\nyears and change of scene have not affected, he still clings to the\r\nhope of Ireland's regeneration, and with voice and pen supports the\r\nprinciples of patriotism for which he suffered. The debt that Ireland\r\nowes to him will not easily be acquitted, and if the bulk of his\r\nco-religionists are no longer to be found within the national camp, we\r\ncan almost forgive them their shortcomings, when we remember that,\r\nwithin our own generation, the Presbyterians of Ulster have given to\r\nIreland two such men as John Martin and John Mitchel.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin's name will re-appear farther on in another portion of this\r\nwork, for the occasion of which we have here treated was not the only\r\none on which his patriotic words and actions brought upon him the\r\nattention of \"the authorities,\" and subjected him to the troubles of a\r\nstate prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW.S. O'BRIEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoudly across the dark flowing tide of the Liffey, rolled the cheers of\r\nwelcome and rejoicing that burst from Conciliation Hall on that\r\nmemorable day in January, '44, when William Smith O'Brien first stood\r\nbeneath its roof, and presided over a meeting of Repealers. Many a time\r\nhad the walls of that historic building given back the cheers of the\r\nthousands who gathered there to revel in the promises of the Liberator;\r\nmany a time had they vibrated to the enthusiasm of the Irishmen who met\r\nthere to celebrate the progress of the movement which was to give\r\nfreedom and prosperity to Ireland; but not even in those days of monster\r\nmeetings and popular demonstrations had a warmer glow of satisfaction\r\nflushed the face of O'Connell, than when the descendant of the Munster\r\nKings took his place amongst the Dublin Repealers. \"I find it\r\nimpossible,\" exclaimed the great Tribune, \"to give adequate expression\r\nto the delight with which I hail Mr. O'Brien's presence in the\r\nAssociation. He now occupies his natural position--the position which\r\ncenturies ago was occupied by his ancestor, Brian Boru. Whatever may\r\nbecome of _me_, it is a consolation to remember that Ireland will not be\r\nwithout a friend such as William Smith O'Brien, who combining all the\r\nmodern endowments of a highly-cultured mind, with intellectual gifts of\r\nthe highest order, nervous eloquence, untiring energy, fervid love of\r\ncountry, and every other high qualification of a popular leader, is now\r\nwhere his friends would ever wish to see him--at the head of the Irish\r\npeople.\" Six weeks before, a banquet had been given in Limerick to\r\ncelebrate O'Brien's adhesion to the national cause, and on this\r\noccasion, too, O'Connell bore generous testimony to the value and\r\nimportance of his accession. \"His presence,\" said the Emancipator, in\r\nproposing Mr. O'Brien's health, \"cannot prevent me here from expressing\r\non behalf of the universal people of Ireland, their admiration and\r\ndelight at his conversion to their cause. Receive the benefactor of\r\nIreland, as such a benefactor should be received. It is certain that our\r\ncountry will never be deserted as long as she has William Smith O'Brien\r\nas one of her leaders.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KEVIN I. O'DOHERTY. THOMAS F. MEAGHER. TERENCE B.\r\nMcMANUS]\r\n\r\nThere was much to account for the tumult of rejoicing which hailed Smith\r\nO'Brien's entry within the ranks of the popular party. His lineage, his\r\nposition, his influence, his stainless character, his abilities, and his\r\nworth, combined to fit him for the place which O'Connell assigned him,\r\nand to rally round him the affection and allegiance of the Irish people.\r\nNo monarch in the world could trace his descent from a longer line of\r\nillustrious men; beside the roll of ancestry to which he could point,\r\nthe oldest of European dynasties were things of a day. When the towering\r\nPyramids that overlook the Nile were still new; before the Homeric\r\nballads had yet been chanted in the streets of an Eastern city; before\r\nthe foundations of the Parthenon were laid on the Acropolis; before the\r\nwandering sons of Æneas found a home in the valley of the Tiber, the\r\nchieftains of his house enjoyed the conqueror's fame, and his ancestors\r\nswayed the sceptre of Erie. Nor was he unworthy of the name and the fame\r\nof the O'Briens of Kincora. Clear sighted and discerning; deeply endowed\r\nwith calm sagacity and penetrating observance; pure minded, eloquent,\r\ntalented and chivalrous; he comprised within his nature the truest\r\nelements of the patriot, the scholar, and the statesman. Unfaltering\r\nattachment to the principles of justice, unswerving obedience to the\r\ndictates of honour, unalterable loyalty to rectitude and duty; these\r\nwere the characteristics that distinguished him; and these were the\r\nqualities that cast their redeeming light round his failings and his\r\nerrors, and wrung from the bitterest of his foes the tribute due to\r\nsuffering worth. If nobility of soul, if earnestness of heart and\r\nsingleness of purpose, if unflinching and self-sacrificing patriotism,\r\nallied to zeal, courage, and ability, could have redeemed the Irish\r\ncause, it would not be left to us to mourn for it to-day; and instead of\r\nthe melancholy story we have now to relate, it might he given to us to\r\nchronicle the regeneration of the Irish nation.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith O'Brien was born, at Dromoland, County Clare, on the 17th\r\nof October, 1803. He was the second son of Sir Edward O'Brien, and on\r\nthe death of his kinsman, the last Marquis of Thomond, his eldest\r\nbrother became Baron of Inchiquin. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge; but his English education, however much it might\r\nhave coloured his views during boyhood, did not seriously affect his\r\ninnate love of justice, or warp the patriotic feelings which were\r\ndeveloped in his earliest years. The associations into which he was\r\ncast, the tone of the society in which he moved, the politics of his\r\nfamily, and the modern traditions of his house, combined to throw him\r\ninto the ranks of the people's enemies; and that these influences were\r\nnot altogether barren of results is proved by the fact that O'Brien\r\nentered Parliament in 1826 as an Anti-Repealer, and exerted himself to\r\nprevent the return of O'Connell at the memorable election for Clare. But\r\nO'Brien was no factious opponent of the national interests; even while\r\nhe acted thus, he had the welfare of his country sincerely at heart; he\r\nsteered according to his lights, and when time and experience showed the\r\nfalseness of his views, he did not hesitate to renounce them. To this\r\nperiod of his political career Mr. O'Brien often adverted in after life,\r\nwith the frankness and candour that distinguished him. \"When the\r\nproposal to seek for a Repeal of the Act of Union was first seriously\r\nentertained,\" said O'Brien, \"I used all the influence I possessed to\r\ndiscountenance the attempt. I did not consider that the circumstances\r\nand prospects of Ireland then justified the agitation of this question.\r\nCatholic Emancipation had been recently achieved, and I sincerely\r\nbelieved that from that epoch a new course of policy would be adopted\r\ntowards Ireland. I persuaded myself that thenceforth the statesmen of\r\nGreat Britain would spare no effort to repair the evils produced by\r\ncenturies of misgovernment--that the Catholic and Protestant would be\r\nadmitted to share on equal terms in all the advantages resulting from\r\nour constitutional form of government--that all traces of an ascendancy\r\nof race or creed would be effaced--that the institutions of Ireland\r\nwould be gradually moulded so as to harmonise with the opinions of its\r\ninhabitants, and that in regard of political rights, legislation for\r\nboth kingdoms would be based upon the principle of perfect equality.\"\r\n\r\nFourteen years had elapsed from the date of Catholic Emancipation, when\r\nO'Brien startled the aristocrats of Ireland by renouncing his allegiance\r\nto their party, and throwing himself heart and soul into the vanguard of\r\nthe people. He told his reasons for the change in bold convincing words.\r\nHe had seen that his expectations of justice were false and delusive.\r\n\"The feelings of the Irish nation,\" he said, \"have been exasperated by\r\nevery species of irritation and insult; every proposal tending to\r\ndevelop the sources of our industry--to raise the character and improve\r\nthe condition of our population, has been discountenanced, distorted, or\r\nrejected. Ireland, instead of taking its place as an integral portion of\r\nthe great empire, which the valour of her sons has contributed to win,\r\nhas been treated as a dependent tributary province; and at this moment,\r\nafter forty-three years of nominal union, the affections of the two\r\nnations are so entirely alienated from each other, that England trusts\r\nfor the maintenance of their connection, not to the attachment of the\r\nIrish people, but to the bayonets which menace our bosoms, and the\r\ncannon which she has planted in all our strongholds.\"\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the Repeal movement were not at their brightest when\r\nO'Brien entered Conciliation Hall. In England, and in Ireland too, the\r\ninfluence of O'Connell was on the wane, and with the dispersion of the\r\nmultitudes that flocked on that Sunday morning in October, 1843, to\r\nlisten to the Liberator on the plains of Clontarf, the peaceful policy\r\nwhich he advocated received its death blow. Over O'Connell himself, and\r\nsome of the most outspoken of his associates, a State prosecution was\r\nimpending; and the arm of the government was already stretched out to\r\ncrush the agitation whose object they detested, and whose strength they\r\nhad begun to fear. The accession of O'Brien, however, the prestige of\r\nhis name, and the influence of his example, was expected to do much\r\ntowards reviving the drooping fortunes of the Association. Nor was the\r\nanticipation illusory. From the day on which O'Brien became a Repealer,\r\ndown to the date of the secession, the strongest prop of the\r\nConciliation Hall was his presence and support; he failed indeed to\r\ncounteract the corrupt influences that gnawed at the vitals of the\r\nAssociation and ultimately destroyed it; but while he remained within\r\nits ranks, the redeeming influence of his genius, his patriotism, and\r\nhis worth, preserved it from the extinction towards which it was\r\nhastening.\r\n\r\nAt an early date the penetrating mind of O'Brien detected the existence\r\nof the evil which was afterwards to transform Conciliation Hall into a\r\nmarket for place hunters. \"I apprehend,\" said he, in a remarkable speech\r\ndelivered in January, '46, \"more danger to Repeal from the subtle\r\ninfluence of a Whig administration, than from the coercive measures of\r\nthe Tories.\" And he was right. Day by day, the subtle influence which he\r\ndreaded did its blighting work; and the success of those who sought the\r\ndestruction of the Repeal Association through the machinery of bribes\r\nand places was already apparent, when on the 27th of July, 1846,\r\nO'Brien, accompanied by Mitchel, Meagher, Duffy, and others arose in\r\nsorrow and indignation, and quitted the Conciliation Hall for ever.\r\n\r\nSix months later the Irish Confederation held its first meeting in the\r\nRound Room of the Rotundo. Meagher, Mitchel, Doheny, O'Brien, O'Gorman,\r\nMartin, and McGee were amongst the speakers; and amidst the ringing\r\ncheers of the densely thronged meeting, the establishment was decreed of\r\nthe Irish Confederation, for the purpose--as the resolution\r\ndeclared--\"of protecting our national interests, and obtaining the\r\nLegislative Independence of Ireland by the force of opinion, by the\r\ncombination of all classes of Irishmen, and by the exercise of all the\r\npolitical, social, and moral influence within our reach.\" It will be\r\nseen that the means by which the Confederates proposed to gain their\r\nobject, did not differ materially from the programme of the Repeal\r\nAssociation. But there was this distinction. Against place-hunting, and\r\neverything savouring of trafficking with the government, the\r\nConfederates resolutely set their faces; and in the next place, while\r\nprescribing to themselves nothing but peaceful and legal means for the\r\naccomplishment of their object, they scouted the ridiculous doctrine,\r\nthat \"liberty was not worth the shedding of a single drop of blood,\" and\r\nthat circumstances might arise under which resort to the arbitration of\r\nthe sword would be righteous and justifiable. In time, however, the\r\nConfederates took up a bolder and more dangerous position. As early as\r\nMay, 1846, Lord John Russell spoke of the men who wrote in the pages of\r\nthe _Nation_, and who subsequently became the leaders of the\r\nConfederation, \"as a party looking to disturbance as its means, and\r\nhaving separation from England as its object.\" The description was false\r\nat the time, but before two years had elapsed its application became\r\nmore accurate. A few men there were like Mitchel, who from the birth of\r\nthe Confederation, and perhaps before it, abandoned all expectation of\r\nredress through the medium of Constitutional agitation; but it was not\r\nuntil the flames of revolution had wrapped the nations of the Continent\r\nin their fiery folds--until the barricades were up in every capital from\r\nMadrid to Vienna--and until the students' song of freedom was mingled\r\nwith the paean of victory on many a field of death--that the hearts of\r\nthe Irish Confederates caught the flame, and that revolution, and\r\nrevolution alone, became the goal of their endeavours. When Mitchel\r\nwithdrew from the Confederation in March, 1848, the principles of\r\nconstitutional action were still in the ascendancy; when he rejoined it\r\na month later, the cry \"to the registries,\" was superseded by fiery\r\nappeals summoning the people to arms. In the first week of April, the\r\ndoctrine which John Mitchel had long been propounding, found expression\r\nin the leading columns of the _Nation_:--\"Ireland's necessity,\" said\r\nDuffy, \"demands the desperate remedy of revolution.\" A few weeks later,\r\nthe same declaration was made in the very citadel of the enemy's power.\r\nIt was O'Brien who spoke, and his audience was the British House of\r\nCommons. With Messrs. Meagher and Hollywood, he had visited Paris to\r\npresent an address of congratulation on behalf of the Irish people to\r\nthe Republican government; and on taking his seat in the House of\r\nCommons after his return, he found himself charged by the Ministers of\r\nthe Crown, with having gone to solicit armed intervention from France on\r\nbehalf of the disaffected people of Ireland. O'Brien replied in a speech\r\nsuch as never was heard before or since within the walls of the House of\r\nCommons. In the midst of indescribable excitement and consternation, he\r\nproceeded to declare in calm deliberative accents--\"that if he was to be\r\narraigned as a criminal, he would gladly endure the most ignominious\r\ndeath that could be inflicted on him rather than witness the sufferings\r\nand indignities he had seen inflicted by the British legislature on his\r\ncountrymen. If it is treason,\" he exclaimed, \"to profess disloyalty to\r\nthis House and to the government of Ireland, by the parliament of Great\r\nBritain--if that be treason, I avow it. Nay, more, I say it shall be the\r\nstudy of my life to overthrow the dominion of this Parliament over\r\nIreland.\" The yells and shouts with which these announcements were\r\nreceived shook the building in which he stood, and obliged him to remain\r\nsilent for several moments after the delivery of each sentence; but when\r\nthe uproar began to subside, the ringing tones of O'Brien rose again\r\nupon the air, and with the stoicism of a martyr, and the imperturable\r\ncourage of a hero, he proceeded. \"Irish Freedom,\" he said, \"must be won\r\nby Irish courage. Every statesman in the civilized globe looks upon\r\nIreland as you look upon Poland, and upon your connection as entirely\r\nanalogous to that of Russia with Poland. I am here to-night to tell you,\r\nthat if you refuse our claims to legislative independence, you will have\r\nto encounter during the present year, the chance of a Republic in\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\nO'Brien returned to Ireland more endeared than ever to the hearts of\r\nhis countrymen. And now the game was fairly afoot. Government and people\r\nviewed each other with steady and defiant glare, and girded up their\r\nloins for the struggle. On the one side the Confederate clubs were\r\norganized with earnestness and vigour, and the spirit of the people\r\nawakened by a succession of stirring and glowing appeals. \"What if we\r\nfail?\" asked the _Nation_; and it answered the question by declaring\r\nunsuccessful resistance under the circumstances preferable to a\r\ndegrading submission. \"What if we _don't_ fail?\" was its next inquiry,\r\nand the answer was well calculated to arouse the patriots of Ireland to\r\naction. On the other hand the authorities were not idle. Arm's Bills,\r\nCoercion Acts, and prosecutions followed each other in quick succession.\r\nMitchel was arrested, convicted, and sent to Bermuda. Duffy, Martin,\r\nMeagher, Doheny, O'Doherty, and M'Gee were arrested--all of whom, except\r\nDuffy and Martin, were shortly afterwards liberated. Duffy's trial was\r\nfixed for August, and this was the time appointed by the Confederates\r\nfor the outbreak of the insurrection. There were some who advocated a\r\nmore prompt mode of action. At a meeting of the Confederates held on\r\nJuly 19th, after the greater portion of the country had been proclaimed,\r\nit was warmly debated whether an immediate appeal to arms should not be\r\ncounselled. O'Brien and Dillon advocated delay; the harvest had not yet\r\nbeen reaped in; the clubs were not sufficiently organized throughout the\r\ncountry, and the people might easily conceal their arms until the hour\r\narrived for striking a decisive blow. Against this policy a few of the\r\nmore impetuous members protested. \"You will wait,\" exclaimed Joe\r\nBrennan, \"until you get arms from heaven, and angels to pull the\r\ntriggers.\" But his advice was disregarded; and the meeting broke up with\r\nthe understanding that with the first glance of the harvest sun, the\r\nfires of insurrection were to blaze upon the hill tops of Ireland, and\r\nthat meanwhile organization and preparation were to engross\r\nthe attention of the leaders. On Friday, July 21st, a war\r\ndirectory--consisting of Dillon, Reilly, O'Gorman, Meagher, and Father\r\nKenyon was appointed; and on the following morning O'Gorman started for\r\nLimerick, Doheny for Cashel, and O'Brien for Wexford, to prepare the\r\npeople for the outbreak.\r\n\r\nIt was war to the knife, and every one knew it. The forces of the\r\ngovernment in Ireland were hourly increased in Dublin--every available\r\nand commanding position was occupied and fortified. \"In the Bank of\r\nIreland,\" says one who watched the progress of affairs with attentive\r\ngaze, \"soldiers as well as cashiers were ready to settle up accounts.\r\nThe young artists of the Royal Hibernian Academy and Royal Dublin\r\nSociety had to quit their easels to make way for the garrison. The\r\nsquares of old Trinity College resounded with the tramp of daily\r\nreviews; the Custom House at last received some occupation by being\r\nturned into a camp. The Linen Hall, the Rotundo, Holmes' Hotel,\r\nAlborough House, Dycer's Stables, in Stephen's-green--every institution,\r\nliterary, artistic, and commercial, was confiscated to powder and\r\npipe-clay. The barracks were provisioned as if for a siege; cavalry\r\nhorses were shod with plates of steel, to prevent their being injured\r\nand thrown into disorder by broken bottles, iron spikes, or the like;\r\nand the infantry were occupied in familiarizing themselves with the art\r\nof fusilading footpaths and thoroughfares. Arms were taken from the\r\npeople, and the houses of loyal families stocked with the implements of\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\nBut the national leaders had calculated on the preparations of the\r\ngovernment; they knew the full measure of its military power, and were\r\nnot afraid to face it; but there was one blow which they had not\r\nforeseen, and which came on them with the shock of a thunderbolt. On the\r\nvery morning that O'Brien left for Wexford, the news reached Dublin that\r\na warrant had been issued for his arrest, and that the suspension of the\r\n_Habeas Corpus_ Act was resolved on by the government. \"It appears\r\nstrangely unaccountable to me,\" was Meagher's reflection in after years,\r\n\"that whilst a consideration of our position, our project, and our\r\nresources was taking place; whilst the stormy future on which we were\r\nentering formed the subject of the most anxious conjecture, and the\r\ndanger of it fell like wintry shadows around us; it seems strangely\r\nunaccountable to me that not an eye was turned to the facilities for the\r\ncounteraction of our designs which the government had at their disposal;\r\nthat not a word was uttered in anticipation of that bold astounding\r\nmeasure--the suspension of the _Habeas Corpus_ Act--the announcement of\r\nwhich broke upon us so suddenly. The overlooking of it was a fatal\r\ninadvertance. Owing to it we were routed without a struggle, and were\r\nled into captivity without glory. We suffer not for a rebellion, but a\r\nblunder.\"\r\n\r\nThe few of the Confederate leaders at large in Dublin at the\r\ntime--Duffy, Martin, Williams, and O'Doherty were in Newgate--held a\r\nhurried council, and their plans were speedily formed. They were to join\r\nSmith O'Brien at once, and commence the insurrection in Kilkenny. On the\r\nnight of Saturday, July 22nd, M'Gee left for Scotland to prepare the\r\nIrishmen of Glasgow for action; and Meagher, Dillon, Reilly, M'Manus,\r\nO'Donoghue, and Leyne started southwards to place themselves in\r\ncommunication with O'Brien. A week later the last of the national papers\r\nwas suppressed, and the _Nation_ went down, sword in hand as a warrior\r\nmight fall, with the words of defiance upon its lips, and a prayer for\r\nthe good old cause floating upwards with its latest breath.\r\n\r\nO'Brien was in bed, when Meagher and Dillon arrived at Balinkeele where\r\nhe was stopping. The news of the suspension of the _Habeas Corpus_ Act,\r\nand of the plans formed by the Confederates were speedily communicated\r\nto him. O'Brien manifested no surprise at the intelligence. He quietly\r\nremarked that the time for action had arrived; and that every Irishman\r\nwas now justified in taking up arms against the government; dressed\r\nhimself, and set out without losing an hour to inaugurate his hazardous\r\nenterprise at Enniscorthy. As the train drove along, the three friends\r\noccupied themselves with the important question where should they begin\r\nthe outbreak. Wexford was mentioned, but the number of Confederates\r\nenrolled there were few, and the people were totally unprepared for a\r\nsudden appeal to arms; New Ross and Waterford were ruled against,\r\nbecause of the effectual assistance the gunboats stationed in the river\r\ncould render the garrison of those towns. Against Kilkenny none of those\r\nobjections applied; and the more they discussed the subject the more\r\nconvinced did they become that the most fitting cradle for the infant\r\ngenius of Irish liberty was the ancient \"city of the Confederates.\"\r\n\"Perfectly safe from all war steamers, gunboats, and floating batteries;\r\nstanding on the frontiers of the three best fighting counties in\r\nIreland--Waterford, Wexford, and Tipperary--the peasantry of which could\r\nfind no difficulty in pouring to its relief; possessing from three to\r\nfive thousand Confederates, most of whom were understood to be armed;\r\nthe most of the streets being narrow, and presenting on this account the\r\ngreatest facilities for the erection of barricades; the barracks lying\r\noutside the town, and the line of communication between the powerful\r\nportions of the latter and the former being intercepted by the old\r\nbridge over the Nore, which might be easily defended, or, at the most,\r\nvery speedily demolished; no place,\" says Meagher, \"appeared to us to be\r\nbetter adapted for the first scene of the revolution.\"\r\n\r\nTowards Kilkenny they therefore took their way, haranguing the people in\r\nsoul-stirring addresses as they proceeded. At Enniscorthy and at\r\nGraigue-na-mana their appeals were responded to with fervent enthusiasm;\r\nthey called on the people to form themselves into organized bodies, and\r\nprepare to co-operate with the insurgents who were shortly to unfurl\r\ntheir banner beneath the shadow of St. Canice's; and the crowds who hung\r\non their words vowed their determination to do so. But in Kilkenny, as\r\nin every town they visited, the patriot leaders found the greatest\r\ndisinclination to take the initiative in the holy war. There as\r\nelsewhere the people felt no unwillingness to fight; but they knew they\r\nwere ill prepared for such an emergency, and fancied the first blow\r\nmight be struck more effectively elsewhere. \"Who will draw the first\r\nblood?\" asked Finton Lalor in the last number of the _Felon_; and the\r\nquestion was a pertinent one; there was a decided reluctance to draw it.\r\nIt is far from our intention to cast the slightest reflection on the\r\nspirit or courage of the nationalists of 1848. We know that it was no\r\nselfish regard for their own safety made the leaders in Wexford,\r\nKilkenny, and elsewhere, shrink from counselling an immediate outbreak\r\nin their localities; the people, as well as the men who led them, looked\r\nforward to the rising of the harvest moon, and the cutting of their\r\ncrops, as the precursors of the herald that was to summon them to aims.\r\nTheir state of organization was lamentably deficient; anticipating a\r\nmonth of quiet preparation, they had neglected to procure arms up to the\r\ndate of O'Brien's arrival, and a few weeks would at least be required to\r\ncomplete their arrangements. In Kilkenny, for instance, not one in every\r\neight of the clubmen possessed a musket, and even their supply of pikes\r\nwas miserably small. But they were ready to do all that in them lay; and\r\nwhen O'Brien, Dillon, and Meagher quitted Kilkenny on Monday, July 24th,\r\nthey went in pursuance of an arrangement which was to bring them back to\r\nthe city of the Nore before the lapse of a week. They were to drive into\r\nTipperary, visit Carrick, Clonmel, and Cashel, and summon the people of\r\nthose towns to arms. Then, after the lapse of a few days, they were to\r\nreturn at the head of their followers to Kilkenny, call out the clubs,\r\nbarricade the streets, and from the Council Chambers of the Corporation\r\nissue the first Revolutionary Edict to the country. They hoped that a\r\nweek later the signal fires of insurrection would be blazing from every\r\nhill-top in Ireland; and that the sunlight of freedom, for which so many\r\ngenerations of patriots had yearned, would soon flood glebe and town,\r\nthe heather-clad mountains, and pleasant vales of Innisfail. _Diis\r\naliter visum_; the vision that glittered before their longing eyes\r\nmelted away with the smoke of the first insurgent shot; and instead of\r\nthe laurel of the conqueror they were decked with the martyr's palm.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Callan the travellers were received with every\r\ndemonstration of sympathy and welcome. The streets were blocked with\r\nmasses of men that congregated to listen to their words. A large\r\nprocession, headed by the temperance band, escorted them through the\r\ntown, and a bonfire was lit in the centre of the main street. They told\r\nthe people to provide themselves at once with arms, as in a few days\r\nthey would be asked to march with the insurgent forces on Kilkenny--an\r\nannouncement that was received with deafening applause. After a few\r\nhours' delay the three compatriots quitted Callan, and pursued their\r\nroad to Carrick-on-Suir, where they arrived on the some evening and\r\nreceived a most enthusiastic reception. They addressed the excited\r\nmultitude in impassioned words, promised to lead them to battle before\r\nmany days, and called on them to practice patience and prudence in the\r\ninterval. On the following day they quitted Carrick, and took their way\r\nto Mullinahone, where the people gathered in thousands to receive them.\r\nThe number of men who assembled to meet them was between three and four\r\nthousand, of whom about three hundred were armed with guns, pistols, old\r\nswords, and pitchforks. The gathering was reviewed and drilled by the\r\nConfederates; and O'Brien, who wore a plaid scarf across his shoulders,\r\nand carried a pistol in his breast pocket, told them that Ireland would\r\nhave a government of her own before many weeks.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Tuesday, July 25th, the Confederate leaders arrived in\r\nMullinahone, where they slept. On the following morning they addressed\r\nthe people, who flocked into the town on hearing of their arrival. And\r\nhere it was that O'Brien himself dealt the death blow of the movement.\r\nThe peasantry, who came from their distant homes to meet him, were left\r\nthe whole day long without food or shelter. O'Brien himself gave what\r\nmoney he had to buy them bread; but he told them in future they should\r\nprovide for themselves, as he could allow no one's property to be\r\ninterfered with. Hungry and exhausted, the men who listened to him\r\nreturned at night to their homes; they were sensible enough to perceive\r\nthat insurrection within the lines laid down by their leaders was\r\nimpossible; the news that they were expected to fight on empty stomachs\r\nwas spread amongst the people, and from that day forward the number of\r\nO'Brien's followers dwindled away.\r\n\r\nOn July 26th, O'Brien and his party first visited the village of\r\nBallingarry, where he was joined by M'Manus, Doheny, Devin Reilly, and\r\nother prominent members of the Confederation. They took a survey of the\r\nvillage and its neighbourhood; addressed the crowd from the piers of the\r\nchapel gate, and slept in the house of one of the village shopkeepers.\r\nNext day they returned to Mullinahone and thence to Killenaule, where\r\nthey were received with every demonstration of welcome and rejoicing.\r\nBouquets fell in showers upon O'Brien; addresses were read, and the\r\nfullest and warmest co-operation was freely promised by the excited\r\ncrowds that congregated in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe exact position which the Confederates had now assumed towards the\r\nCrown and government, is deserving of a moment's attention. Up to the\r\nlast they carefully distinguished between resisting the acts of the\r\ngovernment and disputing the sovereignty of the queen. They regarded the\r\nsuspension of the _Habeas Corpus_ Act as unconstitutional in itself; and\r\nwhen O'Brien told her Majesty's Ministers in the House of Commons, that\r\nit was they who were the traitors to the country, the Queen, and the\r\nConstitution, he did but express the opinions that underlay the whole\r\npolicy of the Confederation. Even the passing of the _Habeas Corpus_\r\nSuspension Act was not quite sufficient to exhaust their patience; in\r\norder to fill the measure of the government's transgressions and justify\r\na resort to arms against them, it was necessary in the opinion of\r\nO'Brien and his associates, that the authorities should attempt to carry\r\ninto operation the iniquitious law they had passed; the arrest of\r\nO'Brien was to be the signal for insurrection; meanwhile, they were\r\nsatisfied with organizing their forces for the fray, and preparing for\r\noffering an effective resistance to the execution of the warrant,\r\nwhenever it should make its appearance. It was therefore that when at\r\nKillenaule, a small party of dragoons rode up to the town they were\r\nsuffered to proceed unmolested; at the first notice of their coming, the\r\npeople rushed to the streets and hastily threw up a barricade to\r\nintercept them. Dillon commanded at the barricade; beside him stood\r\nPatrick O'Donoghue, and a young man whose career as a revolutionist, was\r\ndestined to extend far beyond the scenes in which he was then sharing;\r\nand whose name was one day to become first a terror to the government of\r\nEngland, and afterwards a by-word and a reproach amongst his countrymen.\r\nO'Donoghue and Stephens were both armed, and when the officer commanding\r\nthe dragoons rode up to the barricade and demanded a passage, Stephens\r\npromptly covered him with his rifle, when his attention was arrested by\r\na command from Dillon to ground his arms. The officer pledged his honour\r\nthat he did not come with the object of arresting O'Brien; the barricade\r\nwas taken down; and the dragoons passed scatheless through the town.\r\nAnother opportunity had been lost, and the hearts of the most resolute\r\nof O'Brien's colleagues sunk lower than ever.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, O'Brien and his followers returned to Ballingarry, where they\r\nheld a council on the prospects of the movement. It was clear that the\r\ncase was a desperate one, that the chance of successful resistance was\r\ninevitably lost, and that nothing now awaited them--should they persist\r\nin their enterprise--but ruin and death. Only a couple of hundred men,\r\nwretchedly armed or not armed at all, adhered to their failing fortunes;\r\nand throughout the rest of the country the disaffected gave no sign. But\r\nO'Brien was unmovable; he would do his duty by his country, let the\r\ncountry answer for its duty towards him.\r\n\r\nThe collision came at last. On Saturday morning, July 29th, the\r\nconstabulary of Thurles, Kilkenny, Cashel, and Callan received orders to\r\nmarch on the village of Ballingarry, for the purpose of arresting Smith\r\nO'Brien. On the previous day the government had issued a proclamation,\r\ndeclaring him guilty of treasonable practices, by appearing in arms\r\nagainst the Queen, and offering a reward of £500 for his apprehension;\r\non the same day, £300 was offered for the arrest of Meagher, Dillon,\r\nand Doheny. Fired with the ambition of capturing the rebel party with\r\nhis own forces, and winning for himself a deathless fame, Sub-Inspector\r\nTrant marched out in hot haste from Callan, at the head of forty-six\r\npolicemen, and directed his steps towards Ballingarry, where it was\r\nknown to him that O'Brien was still stopping. Between twelve and one\r\no'clock they arrived at Farrenrory, within three miles of the village of\r\nBallingary. On arriving at this point the police found that effective\r\nmeasures had been adopted to dispute their further progress. Across the\r\nroad before them a barricade had been thrown up, and behind it was\r\narrayed a body of men, numbering from three to four hundred. Fearing to\r\nface the insurgent forces, the police turned off to the right, and\r\nrushed towards a slate house which they saw in the distance. The people\r\nsaw the object of the movement, and at once gave chase; but the police\r\nhad the advantage of a long start, and they succeeded in reaching the\r\nhouse and barring the door by which they entered, before their pursuers\r\ncame up.\r\n\r\nThe die was cast, and the struggle so long watched for, and sighed for,\r\nhad come at last. But it came not as it had been depicted by the tribune\r\nand poet; the vision that had flashed its radiancy before the eager eyes\r\nthat hungered for the redemption of Ireland, differed sadly from the\r\nmiserable reality. The serried ranks of glittering steel, the files of\r\ngallant pikemen, the armed columns of stalwart peasants, pouring through\r\ngap and river course, the glimmering camp fires quivering through the\r\nmist, the waving banners, and the flashing swords--where were they now?\r\nWhere were the thousands of matchless mould, the men of strength and\r\nspirit, whose footfalls woke the echoes one month before in a hundred\r\ntowns as they marched to the meetings at which they swore to strike down\r\nthe oppressor? Only a few months had passed since two thousand\r\ndetermined men had passed in review before O'Brien at Cork; scarcely six\r\nweeks since, similar sights were witnessed from the city of the Shannon\r\nto the winding reaches of the Boyne. Everywhere there were strength,\r\nand numbers, and resolution; where were they now in the supreme hour of\r\nthe country's agony? A thousand times it had been sworn by tens of\r\nthousands of Irishmen, that the tocsin of battle would find them\r\nclustered round the good old flag to conquer or die beneath its shadow.\r\nAnd now, the hour had come, the flag of insurrection so often invoked\r\nwas raised; but the patriot that raised it was left defenceless: _he_ at\r\nleast kept his word, but the promises on which he relied had broken like\r\ndissolving ice beneath his feet.\r\n\r\nAround O'Brien there clustered on that miserable noontide, about four\r\nhundred human beings--a weak, hungry, and emaciated looking throng for\r\nthe most part; their half naked forms, browned by the sun, and hardened\r\nby the winter winds--a motley gathering; amongst whom there were scores\r\nof fasting men, and hundreds through whose wretched dwellings the, wind\r\nand rain found free ingress. They were poor, they were weak, they were\r\nignorant, they were unarmed! but there was one, thing at least which\r\nthey possessed--that quality which Heaven bestowed on the Irish race, to\r\ngild and redeem their misfortunes. Of courage and resolution they had\r\nplenty: they understood little of the causes which led to the outbreak\r\nin which they participated; of Smith O'Brien or his associates few of\r\nthem had heard up to their appearance at Ballingarry; but they knew that\r\nit was against the forces of the British government and on behalf of\r\nIreland's independence they were called on to fight, and in this cause\r\nthey were ready to shed their blood. Such was the party whom O'Brien\r\ngazed upon with a troubled mind on that eventful day. Even the attached\r\ncompanions who had so far attended him were no longer by his side;\r\nM'Manus, O'Donoghue, and Stephens were still there; but Meagher, Dillon,\r\nDoheny and O'Gorman had left at break of day to raise the standard of\r\ninsurrection in other quarters. Of the men around him not more than\r\ntwenty possessed firearms, about twice that number were armed with pikes\r\nand pitchforks; the remainder had but their naked hands and the stones\r\nthey could gather by the wayside.\r\n\r\nOn the other side were forty-seven disciplined men splendidly armed,\r\nand ensconced moreover in a building possessing for the purpose of the\r\nhour the strength of a fortress. It stood on the brow of a hill\r\noverlooking the country in every direction; it consisted of two storeys\r\nwith four windows in each, in front and rere; each gable being also\r\npierced by a pair of windows. There were six little children in the\r\nhouse when the police entered it. Their mother, the Widow M'Cormick\r\narrived on the spot immediately after the police had taken possession of\r\nher domicile, and addressing O'Brien she besought him to save her little\r\nones from danger. On O'Brien's chivalrous nature the appeal was not\r\nwasted. Heedless of the danger to which he exposed himself he walked up\r\nto the window of the house. Standing at the open window with his breast\r\nwithin an inch of the bayonets of the two policemen who were on the\r\ninside, he called on them to give up their arms, and avoid a useless\r\neffusion of blood. \"We are all Irishmen, boys\" he said, \"I only want\r\nyour arms and I'll protect your lives.\" The reply was a murderous volley\r\npoured on the gathering outside. Some half drunken person in the crowd\r\nit appears had flung a stone at one of the windows, and the police\r\nneeded no further provocation. The fire was returned by the insurgents,\r\nand O'Brien seeing that his efforts to preserve peace were futile,\r\nquitted the window and rejoined his companions. For nearly two hours the\r\nfiring continued; the police well sheltered from the possibility of\r\ninjury fired in all about 220 rounds, killing two men and wounding a\r\nnumber of others, amongst them James Stephens who was shot in the thigh.\r\nLong before an equal number of shots were fired from without, the\r\nammunition of the insurgents was exhausted, and they could only reply to\r\nthe thick falling bullets with the stones which the women present\r\ngathered for them in their aprons. It was clear that the house could not\r\nbe stormed in this way; and M'Manus, with half-a-dozen resolute\r\ncompanions, rolled a cartload of hay up to the kitchen door with the\r\nintention of setting fire to it and burning down the house. But O'Brien\r\nwould not permit it; there were children in the house, and their\r\ninnocent lives should not be sacrificed. In vain did M'Manus entreat him\r\nfor permission to fire his pistol into the hay and kindle the ready\r\nflames, O'Brien was inexorable; and the first and last battle of the\r\ninsurrection was lost and won. The Rev. Mr. Fitzgerald, the priest of\r\nthe parish, and his curate, Father Maher now appeared on the spot, and\r\nnaturally used their influence to terminate the hopeless struggle, a\r\nlarge force of constabulary from Cashel soon after were seen\r\napproaching, and the people, who now saw the absolute uselessness of\r\nfurther resistance broke away to the hills. The game was up; the banner\r\nof Irish independence had again sunk to the dust; and O'Brien, who had\r\nacted throughout with preternatural coolness, and whose face gave no\r\nmore indications of emotion than if it had been chiseled in marble,\r\nturned from the scene with a broken heart. For a length of time he\r\nresisted the entreaties of his friends and refused to leave the spot; at\r\nlast their solicitations prevailed, and mounting a horse taken from one\r\nof the police he rode away.\r\n\r\nFrom that fatal day down to the night of Saturday, August 5th, the\r\npolice sought vainly for O'Brien. He slept in the peasant's hut on the\r\nmountain and he shared his scanty fare; a price which might well dazzle\r\nthe senses of his poverty-stricken entertainers was on his head, and\r\nthey knew it; over hill-side and valley swarmed the host of spies,\r\ndetectives, and policemen placed on his track; but no hand was raised to\r\nclutch the tempting bribe, no voice whispered the information for which\r\nthe government preferred its gold. Amongst those too who took part in\r\nthe affray at Ballingarry, and who subsequently were cast in shoals into\r\nprison, there were many from whom the government sought to extract\r\ninformation. Bribes and promises of pardon were held up before their\r\neyes, menaces were freely resorted to, but amongst them the government\r\nsought vainly for an informer. Many, of them died in captivity or in\r\nexile; their homes were broken up; their wives and children left\r\ndestitute and friendless; but the words that would give them liberty\r\nand wealth, and terminate the sufferings of themselves and their\r\nfamilies were never spoken. Had O'Brien chosen to escape from the\r\ncountry like Doheny, O'Gorman, Dillon and other of his friends, it is\r\nprobable he might have done so. He resolved however on facing the\r\nconsequence of his acts and sharing the fate of the Irish rebel to the\r\nbitter end.\r\n\r\nThe rain fell cold and drearily in the deserted streets of Thurles on\r\nthe night which saw the arrest of William Smith O'Brien. Away over the\r\nshadowy mountains in the distance, the swimming vapours cast their\r\nshroud, wrapping in their chilling folds the homes of the\r\nhunger-stricken prostrate race that sat by their fireless hearths. The\r\nautumn gale swept over the desolate land as if moaning at the ruin and\r\nmisery that cursed it, and wailing the dirge of the high hopes and\r\nardent purposes that a few short weeks before had gladdened the hearts\r\nof its people. Calmly and deliberately with folded arms O'Brien walked\r\nthrough the streets, and entered the Thurles Railway Station. He wore a\r\nblack hat, a blue boat cloak, in which he was rather tightly muffled,\r\nand a light plaid trousers; in his hand he carried a large black stick.\r\nHe walked to the ticket office and paid his fare to Limerick; then\r\nwrapping himself up in his cloak and folding his arms, again he walked\r\nslowly along the platform awaiting the arrival of the train. He had\r\nresolved on surrendering himself for trial, but he wished to pay one\r\nlast visit to his home and family. That gratification however was denied\r\nhim, he was recognised by an Englishman named Hulme, a railway guard; in\r\nan instant he was surrounded by police and detectives, and torn of with\r\nbrutal violence to gaol. That same night an express train flashed\r\nnorthwards through the fog and mist bearing O'Brien a prisoner to\r\nDublin. In the carriage in which he was placed sat General M'Donald, a\r\nSub-Inspector of Constabulary and four policemen. On entering the train\r\na pistol was placed at O'Brien's head, and he was commanded not to speak\r\non peril of his life. Disregarding the injunction, he turned to M'Donald\r\nand asked him why he was so scandalously used. The General \"had a duty\r\nto perform,\" and \"his orders should be obeyed.\" \"I have played the game\r\nand lost,\" said O'Brien, \"and I am ready to pay the penalty of having\r\nfailed; I hope that those who accompanied me may be dealt with in\r\nclemency; I care not what happens to myself.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, September 28th, he was arraigned before a Special\r\nCommission on a charge of high treason at Clonmel. The trial lasted ten\r\ndays, and ended in a verdict of guilty. It excited unprecedented\r\ninterest throughout the country, and there are many of its incidents\r\ndeserving of permanent record. Amongst the witnesses brought forward by\r\nthe crown was John O'Donnell, a comfortable farmer, who resided near\r\nBallingarry. \"I won't be sworn,\" he said on coming on the table, \"or\r\ngive evidence under any circumstances. You may bring me out and put a\r\nfile of soldiers before me, and plant twenty bullets in my breast, but\r\nwhile I have a heart there I will never swear for you.\" He expiated his\r\npatriotism by a long imprisonment. Nor was this a solitary instance of\r\nheroism; Richard Shea, a fine looking young peasant, on being handed the\r\nbook declared that \"he would not swear against such a gentleman,\" and he\r\ntoo was carried off to pass years within a British dungeon. But their\r\nsacrifices were unavailing; of evidence there was plenty against\r\nO'Brien; the police were overflowing with it, and the eloquence and\r\nability of Whiteside were powerless to save him from a verdict of\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nThe papers of the time are full of remarks on the firmness and\r\nself-possession displayed by O'Brien throughout the trial. Even the\r\nannouncement of the verdict failed to disturb his composure, and when\r\nthe usual question was asked he replied with calmness and deliberation:\r\n\r\n   \"My lords, it is not my intention to enter into any vindication of my\r\n   conduct, however much I might have desired to avail myself of this\r\n   opportunity of so doing. I am perfectly satisfied with the\r\n   consciousness that I have performed my duty to my country--that I\r\n   have done only that which, in my opinion, it was the duty of every\r\n   Irishman to have done; and I am now prepared to abide the\r\n   consequences of having performed my duty to my native land. Proceed\r\n   with your sentence.\"\r\n\r\nA deep murmur, followed by a burst of applause filled the court as the\r\nnoble patriot ceased speaking. Stepping back a pace, and folding his\r\narms on his breast, O'Brien looked fixedly at the judge, and awaited the\r\nsentence of the court. Amidst the deepest sensation, Chief Justice\r\nBlackburne proceeded to discharge his task. O'Brien was sentenced to be\r\nhanged, beheaded, and quartered. \"During the delivery of the sentence,\"\r\nsays a writer of the period, \"the most profound agitation pervaded in\r\nthe court; as it drew towards the close, the excitement became more\r\nmarked and intense; but when the last barbarous provisions of the\r\nsentence were pronounced, the public feeling could only manifest itself\r\nby stifled sobs and broken murmurs of sympathy for the heroic man, who,\r\nalone, was unmoved during this awful scene, whose lips alone did not\r\nquiver, whose hand alone did not tremble, but whose heart beat with the\r\ncalm pulsation of conscious guiltlessness and unsullied honour.\"\r\n\r\nNine months later (July 29th, 1849), the brig \"Swift\" sailed from\r\nKingstown harbour, bearing O'Brien, Meagher, M'Manus, and O'Donoghue\r\ninto exile. In the month of November the vessel reached Hobart Town,\r\nwhere \"tickets of leave\" were offered to those gentlemen on condition of\r\ntheir residing each one within a certain district marked out for him,\r\nand giving their parole to make no attempt at escape while in possession\r\nof the ticket. Messrs. Meagher, M'Manus, and O'Donoghue accepted these\r\nterms; Mr. O'Brien refused them, and was consequently sent to an island\r\noff the coast called Maria Island, where he was placed in strict custody\r\nand treated with great severity. The news of the indignities and the\r\nsufferings to which he was subjected, outraged the feelings of the Irish\r\npeople in the neighbouring country, and ere long his sympathisers in\r\nTasmania laid a plan for his escape. They hired a vessel to lie off the\r\ncoast on a particular day, and send a boat on shore to take off the\r\nprisoner, who had been informed of the plot, and had arranged to be in\r\nwaiting for his deliverers. This design would unquestionably have\r\nsucceeded but for the treachery of the captain of the ship, who, before\r\nsailing to the appointed spot, had given the government information of\r\nthe intended escape and the manner of it. What occurred on the arrival\r\nof the vessel we shall relate in the words of Mr. Mitchel, who tells the\r\nstory in his \"Jail Journal\" as he heard it from Mr. O'Brien himself:\r\n\r\n\"At last as he wandered on the shore and had almost given up all hope of\r\nthe schooner, the schooner hove in sight. To give time for her approach\r\nhe walked into the woods for a space, that he might not alarm his\r\nguardian constable by his attention to her movements. Again he sauntered\r\ndown towards the point with apparent carelessness, but with a beating\r\nheart. San Francisco was to be his first destination; and beyond that\r\ngolden gate lay the great world, and home, and children, and an\r\nhonourable life. The boat was coming, manned by three men; and he\r\nstepped proudly and resolutely to meet them on the shore. To be sure\r\nthere was, somewhere behind him, one miserable constable with his\r\nmiserable musket, but he had no doubt of being able to dispose of that\r\ndifficulty with the aid of his allies, the boatmen. The boat could not\r\nget quite close to the beach, because they had to run her into a kind of\r\ncove where the water was calm and unencumbered with large tangled weeds.\r\nO'Brien, when he reached the beach, plunged into the water to prevent\r\ndelay, and struggled through the thick matted seaweed to the boat. The\r\nwater was deeper than he expected, and when he came to the boat he\r\nneeded the aid of the boatmen to climb over the gunwale. Instead of\r\ngiving him this aid the rascals allowed him to flounder there, and kept\r\nlooking to the shore, where the constable had by this time appeared with\r\nhis musket. The moment he showed himself, the three boatmen cried out\r\ntogether, 'We surrender!' and invited him on board; where he instantly\r\ntook up a hatchet--no doubt provided by the ship for that purpose, and\r\nstove the boat. O'Brien saw he was betrayed, and on being ordered to\r\nmove along with the constable and boatmen towards the station, he\r\nrefused to stir--hoping, in fact, by his resistance, to provoke the\r\nconstable to shoot him. However, the three boatmen seized on him, and\r\nlifted him up from the ground, and carried him wherever the constable\r\nordered. His custody was thereafter made more rigorous, and he was\r\nshortly after removed from Maria Island to Port Arthur station.\"\r\n\r\nTo this brief narrative the following \"note\" is appended in the work\r\nfrom which we have just quoted:--\r\n\r\n\"Ellis, the captain of the schooner, was some months after seized at San\r\nFrancisco by Mr. M'Manus and others, brought by night out of his ship,\r\nand carried into the country to undergo his trial under a tree,\r\nwhereupon, if found guilty, he was destined to swing. M'Manus set out\r\nhis indictment; and it proves how much Judge Lynch's method of\r\nadministering justice in those early days of California excelled\r\nanything we know of law or justice in Ireland--that Ellis, for want of\r\nsufficient and satisfactory evidence then producible, was acquitted by\r\nthat midnight court, under that convenient and tempting tree.\"\r\n\r\nPort Arthur station, to which Mr. O'Brien was removed from Maria Island,\r\nwas a place of punishment for convicts who, while serving out their\r\nterms of transportation, had committed fresh offences against the law.\r\nAfter a detention there for some time, Mr. O'Brien, whose health was\r\nrapidly sinking under the rigours of his confinement, was induced, by\r\nletters, from his political friends to accept the ticket-of-leave and\r\navail of the comparative liberty which they enjoyed. The government, on\r\nhis acceptance of their terms, placed him first in the district of New\r\nNorfolk, and subsequently in that of Avoca, where he remained until the\r\nconditional pardon, already mentioned in these columns, was granted in\r\n1854. He then left Australia, went on to Madras, where he made a stay of\r\nabout a month; from thence he went to Paris and on to Brussels, where he\r\nwas joined by his wife and children. He next made a tour in Greece, and\r\nwas in that country when the unconditional pardon, which permitted him\r\nto return to his native land, was granted in the month of May, 1856,\r\nimmediately after the close of the Crimean war. On Tuesday, July 8th,\r\n1856, Mr. O'Brien stood once more upon his native soil after an exile of\r\neight years. The news of his arrival was joyfully received by his\r\nfellow-countrymen, who welcomed him with every mark of respect and\r\naffection whenever he appeared among them. Thence-forward Mr. O'Brien\r\ntook no active part in Irish politics, but he frequently offered advice\r\nand suggestions to his countrymen through the medium of letters and\r\naddresses in the _Nation_. In February, 1859, Mr. O'Brien made a voyage\r\nto America, and during the ensuing months travelled through a great\r\nportion of that country. After his return to Ireland he delivered, in\r\nNovember, 1859, an interesting series of lectures on his tour, in the.\r\nMechanics' Institute, Dublin. On July 1st, 1863, he lectured in the\r\nRotundo, Dublin, for the benefit of a fund which was being raised for\r\nthe relief of the wounded and destitute patriots of the Polish\r\ninsurrection. In the early part of the year, 1864, the health of the\r\nillustrious patriot began rapidly to fail, and he was taken by his\r\nfriends to England for a change of air. But the weight of many years of\r\ncare and suffering was on him, and its effects could not be undone. On\r\nthe 16th of June, 1864. at Bangor, the noble-hearted patriot breathed\r\nhis last. His family had the honoured remains brought to Ireland for\r\ninterment in the old burial-ground of his fathers. On Thursday morning\r\nat an early hour they reached Dublin on board the \"Cambria\" steamer. It\r\nwas known that his family wished that no public demonstration should be\r\nmade at his funeral, but the feelings of the citizens who desired to pay\r\na tribute of respect to his memory could not be repressed. In the grey\r\nhours of the morning the people in thousands assembled on the quays to\r\nawait the arrival of the remains, and two steamers, which had been\r\nchartered for the purpose, proceeded, with large numbers on board, some\r\ndistance into the harbour to meet the approaching vessel. All along the\r\nway, from the North Wall to the Kings-bridge railway station, the hearse\r\nbearing the patriot's body was accompanied by the procession of\r\nmourners, numbering about 15,000 men. At various stages of the journey\r\nsimilar scenes were witnessed. But the end was soon reached. In the\r\nchurchyard of Rathronan, Co. Limerick, they laid him to rest. The green\r\ngrass grows freshly around the vault in which he sleeps, and has long\r\nfilled up the foot-prints of the multitude who broke the silence of that\r\nlonely spot by their sobs on the day he was buried; the winter gales\r\nwill come and go, and touched by the breath of spring, the wild flowers\r\nwill blossom there through succeeding years; but never again will a\r\npurer spirit, a nobler mind, a patriot more brave, more chivalrous, or\r\nmore true, give his heart to the cause of Ireland, than the\r\nsilvered-haired, care-burthened gentleman whom they bore from Cahirmoyle\r\nto his grave on the 24th day of June, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS FRANCIS MEAGHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1846, when the Repeal Association was still powerful and great,\r\nand ere yet the country had ceased to throb to the magic of O'Connell's\r\nvoice, there rose one day from amongst those who crowded the platform of\r\nConciliation Hall, a well-featured, gracefully-built, dark-eyed young\r\ngentleman, towards whom the faces of the assembly turned in curiosity,\r\nand whose accents when he spoke, were those of a stranger to the\r\naudience. Few of them had heard of his name; not one of them--if the\r\nchairman, William Smith O'Brien be excepted--had the faintest idea of\r\nthe talents and capacities he possessed, and which were one day to\r\nenrapture and electrify his countrymen. He addressed the meeting on one\r\nof the passing topics of the day; something in his manner savouring of\r\naffectation, something in the semi-Saxon lisp that struggled through his\r\nlow-toned utterances, something in the total lack of suitable gesture,\r\ngave his listeners at the outset an unfavourable impression of the young\r\nspeaker. He was boyish, and some did not scruple to hint conceited; he\r\nhad too much of the fine gentleman about his appearance, and too little\r\nof the native brogue and stirring declamation to which his listeners\r\nhad been accustomed. The new man is a failure, was the first idea that\r\nsuggested itself to the audience: but he was not; and when he resumed\r\nhis seat he had conquered all prejudices, and wrung the cheers of\r\nadmiration from the meeting. Warming with his subject, and casting off\r\nthe restraints that hampered his utterances at first, he poured forth a\r\nstrain of genuine eloquence, vivified by the happiest allusions, and\r\nenriched by imagery and quotations as beautiful as they were\r\nappropriate, which startled the meeting from its indifference, and won\r\nfor the young speaker the enthusiastic applause of his audience. O'Brien\r\ncomplimented him warmly on his success, and thus it was that the orator\r\nof Young Ireland made his debut on the political platform.\r\n\r\nMeagher was not quite twenty-three years of age when his voice was first\r\nheard in Conciliation Hall. He was born in Waterford of an old Catholic\r\nfamily, which through good and ill had adhered to the national faith and\r\nthe national cause; his school-boy days were passed partly at\r\nClongowes-wood College, and partly under the superintendence of the\r\nJesuit Fathers at Stoneyhurst in Lancashire. His early years gave few\r\nindications of the splendid wealth of genius that slumbered within his\r\nbreast. He took little interest in his classical or mathematical\r\nstudies; but he was an ardent student of English literature, and his\r\ncompositions in poetry and prose invariably carried away the prize. He\r\nfound his father filling the Civic Chair in Waterford, when he returned\r\nfrom Stoneyhurst to his native city. O'Connell was in the plenitude of\r\nhis power; and from end to end of the land, the people were shaken by\r\nmighty thoughts and grand aspirations; with buoyant and unfaltering\r\ntread the nation seemed advancing towards the goal of Freedom, and the\r\nmanhood of Ireland seemed kindling at the flame which glowed before the\r\naltar of Liberty. Into the national movement young Meagher threw himself\r\nwith the warmth and enthusiasm of his nature. At the early age of twenty\r\nwe find him presiding over a meeting of Repealers in his native city,\r\ncalled to express sympathy with the State Prisoners of '43, and he\r\nthence-forward became a diligent student of contemporary politics. He\r\nbecame known as an occasional speaker at local gatherings; but it was\r\nnot until the event we have described that Meagher was fairly launched\r\nin the troubled tide of politics, and that his lot was cast for good or\r\nevil, with the leaders of the national party.\r\n\r\nUp to the date of secession Meagher was a frequent speaker at the\r\nmeetings of the Repeal Association. Day by day his reputation as a\r\nspeaker extended, until at length he grew to be recognised as the orator\r\nof the party, and the knowledge that he was expected to speak was\r\nsufficient to crowd Conciliation Hall to overflowing. When the influence\r\nof the _Nation_ party began to be felt, and signs of disunion appeared\r\non the horizon, O'Connell made a vigorous effort to detach Meagher from\r\nthe side of Mitchel, Duffy, and O'Brien. \"These young Irelanders,\" he\r\nsaid, \"will lead you into danger.\" \"They may lead me into danger,\"\r\nreplied Meagher, \"but certainly not into dishonour.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the trafficking with the Whigs, which subsequently laid the\r\nRepeal Association in the dust, and shipwrecked a movement which might\r\nhave ended in the disinthralment of Ireland, Meagher protested in words\r\nof prophetic warning. \"The suspicion is abroad,\" he said, \"that the\r\nnational cause will be sacrificed to Whig supremacy, and that the\r\npeople, who are now striding on to freedom, will be purchased back into\r\nfactious vassalage. The Whigs calculate upon your apostacy, the\r\nConservatives predict it.\" The place beggars, who looked to the Whigs\r\nfor position and wealth, murmured as they heard their treachery laid\r\nbare and their designs dissected in the impassioned appeals by which\r\nMeagher sought to recall them to the path of patriotism and duty. It was\r\nnecessary for their ends that the bold denouncer of corruption, and the\r\nmen who acted with him, should be driven from the association; and to\r\neffect that object O'Connell was hounded on to the step which ended in\r\nthe secession. The \"peace resolutions\" were introduced, and Meagher\r\nfound himself called on to subscribe to a doctrine which his soul\r\nabhorred--that the use of arms was at all times unjustifiable and\r\nimmoral. The Lord Mayor was in the chair, and O'Brien, John O'Connell.\r\nDenis Reilly, Tom Steele, and John Mitchel had spoken, when Meagher rose\r\nto address the assembly. The speech he delivered on that occasion, for\r\nbrilliancy and lyrical grandeur has never been surpassed. It won for him\r\na reception far transcending that of Shiel or O'Connell as an orator;\r\nand it gave to him the title by which he was afterwards so often\r\nreferred to--\"Meagher of the Sword.\" He commenced by expressing his\r\nsense of gratitude, and his attachment to O'Connell, \"My lord,\" he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n   \"I am not ungrateful to the man who struck the fetters off my limbs\r\n   while I was yet a child, and by whose influence my father, the first\r\n   Catholic that did so for two hundred years, sat for the last two\r\n   years in the civic chair of my native city. But, my lord,\" he\r\n   continued, \"the same God who gave to that great man the power to\r\n   strike down one odious ascendency in this country, and who enabled\r\n   him to institute in this land the laws of religious equality--the\r\n   same God gave to me a mind that is my own, a mind that has not been\r\n   mortgaged to the opinion of any man or set of men, a mind that I was\r\n   to use and not surrender.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus vindicated freedom of opinion, the speaker went on to\r\ndisclaim for himself the opinion that the Association ought to deviate\r\nfrom the strict path of legality. But he refused to accept the\r\nresolutions; because he said \"there are times when arms alone will\r\nsuffice, and when political ameliorations call for 'a drop of blood,'\r\nand for many thousand drops of blood.\" Then breaking forth into a strain\r\nof impassioned and dazzling oratory he proceeded:--\r\n\r\n   \"The soldier is proof against an argument--but he is not proof\r\n   against a bullet. The man that will listen to reason--let him be\r\n   reasoned with. But it is the weaponed arm of the patriot that can\r\n   alone prevail against battalioned despotism.\r\n\r\n   \"Then, my lord, I do not condemn the use of arms as immoral, nor do I\r\n   conceive it profane to say that the King of Heaven--the Lord of\r\n   Hosts! the God of Battles!--bestows his benediction upon those who\r\n   unsheath the sword in the hour of a nation's peril. From that evening\r\n   on which, in the valley of Bethulia, he nerved the arm of the Jewish\r\n   girl to smite the drunken tyrant in his tent, down to this our day,\r\n   in which he has blessed the insurgent chivalry of the Belgian priest,\r\n   His Almighty hand hath ever been stretched forth from His throne of\r\n   Light to consecrate the flag of freedom--to bless the patriot's\r\n   sword! Be it in the defence, or be it in the assertion of a people's\r\n   liberty, I hail the sword as a sacred weapon; and if, my lord, it had\r\n   sometimes taken the shape of the serpent, and reddened the shroud of\r\n   the oppressor with too deep a dye, like the anointed rod of the High\r\n   Priest, it has at other times, and as often, blossomed into celestial\r\n   flowers to deck the freeman's brow.\r\n\r\n   \"Abhor the sword--stigmatize the sword? No, my lord, for in the\r\n   passes of the Tyrol it cut to pieces the banner of the Bavarian, and,\r\n   through those cragged passes, struck a path to fame for the peasant\r\n   insurrectionists of Inspruck! Abhor the sword--stigmatize the sword?\r\n   No, my lord, for at its blow a giant nation started from the waters\r\n   of the Atlantic, and by its redeeming magic, and in the quivering of\r\n   its crimsoned light the crippled colony sprang into the attitude of a\r\n   proud Republic--prosperous, limitless, and invincible! Abhor the\r\n   sword--stigmatize the sword? No, my lord, for it swept the Dutch\r\n   marauders out of the fine old towns of Belgium--scourged them back to\r\n   their own phlegmatic swamps--and knocked their flag and sceptre,\r\n   their laws and bayonets, into the sluggish waters of the Scheldt.\r\n\r\n   \"My lord, I learned that it was the right of a nation to govern\r\n   itself, not in this hall, but on the ramparts of Antwerp; I learned\r\n   the first article of a nation's creed upon those ramparts, where\r\n   freedom was justly estimated, and where the possession of the\r\n   precious gift was purchased by the effusion of generous blood. My\r\n   lord, I honor the Belgians for their courage and their daring, and I\r\n   will not stigmatize the means by which they obtained a citizen-king,\r\n   a chamber of Deputies.\"\r\n\r\nIt was all he was permitted to say. With flushed face and excited\r\ngesture John O'Connell rose, and declared he could not sit and listen to\r\nthe expression of such sentiments. Either Mr. Meagher or he should leave\r\nthe Association; O'Brien interceded to obtain a hearing for his young\r\nfriend, and protested against Mr. O'Connell's attempts to silence him.\r\nBut the appeal was wasted, O'Brien left the hall in disgust, and with\r\nhim Meagher, Duffy, Reilly, and Mitchel quitted it for ever.\r\n\r\nMeagher's subsequent career in Ireland is soon told. He was a regular\r\nattendant at the meetings of the Confederation, of which he was one of\r\nthe founders, and the fame of his eloquence, his manly appearance, and\r\nthe charms of his youthful frankness contributed immensely towards the\r\ngrowth of the new organization. He always acted with O'Brien, whom he\r\nloved in his inmost soul, but he was respected and admired by every\r\nsection of nationalists, the Mitchelites, the Duffyites, and we might\r\neven say the O'Connellites. When the country began to feel the influence\r\nof the whirlwind of revolution which swept over the continent,\r\noverturning thrones and wrecking constitutions as if they were built of\r\ncardboard, Meagher shared the wild impulse of the hour, and played\r\nboldly for insurrection and separation. He was one of the three\r\ngentlemen appointed to present the address from Ireland to the French\r\nRepublican government in 1848; and in the speech delivered by him at the\r\ncrowded meeting in the Dublin Music Hall before his departure, he\r\ncounselled his countrymen to send a deputation to the Queen, asking her\r\nto convene the Irish parliament in the Irish capital. \"If the claim be\r\nrejected,\" said Meagher, \"if the throne stand as a barrier between the\r\nIrish people and the supreme right--then loyalty will be a crime, and\r\nobedience to the executive will be treason to the country. Depute your\r\nworthiest citizens to approach the throne, and before that throne let\r\nthe will of the Irish people be uttered with dignity and decision. If\r\nnothing comes of this,\" he added, \"if the constitution opens to us no\r\npath to freedom, if the Union be maintained in spite of, the will of the\r\nIrish people, if the government of Ireland insist on being a government\r\nof dragoons and bombadiers, of detectives and light infantry, then,\" he\r\nexclaimed in the midst of tumultuous cheering, \"up with the barricades,\r\nand invoke the God of Battles!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Republican spirit was in full glow in Ireland, Meagher\r\nastonished his friends by rushing down to Waterford and offering himself\r\nas a candidate for the post left vacant in parliament by the resignation\r\nof O'Connell. By this time the Confederates had begun to despair of a\r\nparliamentary policy, and they marvelled much to see their young orator\r\nrush to the hustings, and throw himself into the confusion and turmoil\r\nof an election contest. _Que le diable allait il faire dans cette\r\ngalere_ muttered his Dublin friends. Was not the time for hustings\r\norations, and parliamentary agitation over now? Meagher, however,\r\nconceived, and perhaps wisely, that he could still do some good for his\r\ncountry in the House of Commons. He issued a noble address to the\r\nelectors of his native city, in which he asked for their support on the\r\nmost patriotic grounds. \"I shall not meddle,\" he said, \"with English\r\naffairs. I shall take no part in the strife of parties--all factions are\r\nalike to me. I shall go to the House of Commons to insist on the rights\r\nof this country to be held, governed, and defended by its own citizens,\r\nand by them alone. Whilst I live I shall never rest satisfied until the\r\nkingdom of Ireland has won a parliament, an army, and a navy of her\r\nown.\" Mitchel strongly disapproved of his conduct. \"If Mr. Meagher were\r\nin parliament,\" said the _United Irishman_, \"men's eyes would be\r\nattracted thither once more; some hope of 'justice' might again revive\r\nin this too easily deluded people.\" The proper men to send to parliament\r\nwere according to Mitchel, \"old placemen, pensioners, five pound\r\nConciliation Hall Repealers.\" \"We have no wish to dictate,\" concluded\r\nMitchel in an article on the subject, full of the lurking satire and\r\nquiet humour that leavened his writings, \"but if the electors of\r\nWaterford have any confidence in us, we shall only say that we are for\r\nCostello!\"\r\n\r\n\"Costello\" was defeated, however, but so was Meagher. The Young Ireland\r\nchampion was stigmatized as a Tory by the Whigs, and as a rebel by the\r\nTories; if _the people_, as Mitchel remarks had any power he would have\r\nbeen elected by an overwhelming majority, but the people had no votes,\r\nand Sir Henry Winston Barren was returned. Meagher went back to Dublin\r\nalmost a convert to Mitchel's views, leaving Whig, Tory, and West Briton\r\nto exult over his discomfiture.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen what Meagher did when the guage of battle was\r\nthrown down, and when \"the day all hearts to weigh\" was imagined to have\r\narrived, we have seen how he accompanied O'Brien in his expedition from\r\nWexford to Kilkenny, and thence to Tipperary; and how on the morning of\r\nJuly 29th, 1848, he left O'Brien at Ballingarry, little dreaming of the\r\ntragedy which was to make that day memorable, and expecting to be able\r\nto bring reinforcements to his leader from other quarters before the\r\ncrisis came. He failed however in his effort to spread the flames of\r\ninsurrection. The chilling news of O'Brien's defeat--distorted and\r\nexaggerated by hostile tongues--was before him everywhere, and even the\r\nmost resolute of his sympathisers had sense enough to see that their\r\nopportunity--if it existed at all--had passed away. On the 12th day of\r\nAugust, 1848, Meagher was arrested on the road between Clonoulty and\r\nHolycross, in Tipperary. He was walking along in company with Patrick\r\nO'Donoghue and Maurice R. Leyne, two of his intimate friends and\r\nfellow-outlaws, when a party of police passed them by. Neither of the\r\nthree was disguised, but Meagher and Leyne wore frieze overcoats, which\r\nsomewhat altered their usual appearance. After a short time the police\r\nreturned; Meagher and his companions gave their real names on being\r\ninterrogated, and they were at once arrested and taken in triumph to\r\nThurles. The three friends bore their ill fortune with what their\r\ncaptors must have considered provoking nonchalance. Meagher smoked a\r\ncigar on the way to the station, and the trio chatted as gaily as if\r\nthey were walking in safety on the free soil of America, instead of\r\nbeing helpless prisoners on their way to captivity and exile.\r\n\r\nMeagher stood in the dock at Clonmel a week after O'Brien had quitted it\r\na convict. He was defended by Mr. Whiteside and Isaac Butt, whose\r\nmagnificent speech in his defence was perhaps the most brilliant display\r\nof forensic eloquence ever heard Within the court in which he stood. Of\r\ncourse the jury was packed (only 18 Catholics were named on a jury-panel\r\nof 300), and of course the crown carried its point. On the close of the\r\nsixth day of the trial, the jury returned into court with a verdict of\r\n\"guilty,\" recommending the prisoner to mercy on the ground of his youth.\r\n\r\nTwo days later he was brought back to the dock to receive sentence. He\r\nwas dressed in his usual style, appeared in excellent health, and bore\r\nhimself--we are told--throughout the trying ordeal, with fortitude and\r\nmanly dignity. He spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords, it is my intention to say a few words only. I desire that\r\n   the last act of a proceeding which has occupied so much of the public\r\n   time, should be of short duration. Nor have I the indelicate wish to\r\n   close the dreary ceremony of a state prosecution with a vain display\r\n   of words. Did I fear that hereafter, when I shall be no more, the\r\n   country I tried to serve would speak ill of me, I might, indeed,\r\n   avail myself of this solemn moment to vindicate my sentiments and my\r\n   conduct. But I have no such fear. The country will judge of those\r\n   sentiments and that conduct in a light far different from that in\r\n   which the jury by whom I have been convicted have viewed them, and by\r\n   the country the sentence which you, my lords, are about to pronounce,\r\n   will be remembered only as the severe and solemn attestation of my\r\n   rectitude and truth. Whatever be the language in which that sentence\r\n   be spoken, I know that my fate will meet with sympathy, and that my\r\n   memory will be honoured. In speaking thus, accuse me not, my lords,\r\n   of an indecorus presumption in the efforts I have made in a just and\r\n   noble cause. I ascribe no main importance, nor do I claim for those\r\n   efforts any high reward. But it so happens, and it will ever happen\r\n   so, that they who have lived to serve their country--no matter how\r\n   weak their efforts may have been--are sure to receive the thanks and\r\n   blessings of its people. With my countrymen I leave my memory, my\r\n   sentiments, my acts, proudly feeling that they require no vindication\r\n   from me this day. A jury of my countrymen, it is true, have found me\r\n   guilty of the crime of which I stood indicted. For this I entertain\r\n   not the slightest feeling of resentment towards them. Influenced as\r\n   they must have been by the charge of the Lord Chief Justice, they\r\n   could perhaps have found no other verdict. What of that charge? Any\r\n   strong observations on it I feel sincerely would ill-befit the\r\n   solemnity of this scene; but I would earnestly beseech of you, my\r\n   lord--you who preside on that bench--when the passions and the\r\n   prejudices of this hour have passed away, to appeal to your own\r\n   conscience, and ask of it, was your charge what it ought to have\r\n   been, impartial and indifferent between the subject and the crown? My\r\n   lords, you may deem this language unbecoming in me, and perhaps it\r\n   may seal my fate; but I am here to speak the truth, whatever it may\r\n   cost--I am here to regret nothing I have ever done, to regret nothing\r\n   I have ever said--I am here to crave with no lying lip the life I\r\n   consecrate to the liberty of my country. Far from it. Even\r\n   here--here, where the thief, the libertine, the murderer, have left\r\n   their foot-prints in the dust--here, on this spot, where the shadows\r\n   of death surround me, and from which I see my early grave in an\r\n   unanointed soil open to receive me--even here, encircled by these\r\n   terrors, that hope which first beckoned me to the perilous sea on\r\n   which I have been wrecked, still consoles, animates, and enraptures\r\n   me. No; I do not despair of my poor old country--her peace, her\r\n   liberty, her glory. For that country I can do no more than bid her\r\n   hope. To lift this island up--to make her a benefactor to humanity,\r\n   instead of being, as she is now, the meanest beggar in the world--to\r\n   restore to her her native powers and her ancient constitution--this\r\n   has been my ambition, and this ambition has been my crime. Judged by\r\n   the law of England, I know this crime entails upon me the penalty of\r\n   death; but the history of Ireland explains that crime and justifies\r\n   it. Judged by that history, I am no criminal, you (addressing Mr.\r\n   M'Manus) are no criminal, you (addressing Mr. O'Donoghue) are no\r\n   criminal, and we deserve no punishment; judged by that history, the\r\n   treason of which I stand convicted loses all its guilt, has been\r\n   sanctified as a duty, and will be enobled as a sacrifice. With these\r\n   sentiments I await the sentence of the court. I have done what I felt\r\n   to be my duty. I have spoken now, as I did on every other occasion\r\n   during my short life, what I felt to be the truth. I now bid farewell\r\n   to the country of my birth--of my passions--of my death; a country\r\n   whose misfortunes have invoked my sympathies--whose factions I sought\r\n   to quell--whose intelligence I prompted to a lofty aim--whose freedom\r\n   has been my fatal dream. To that country I now offer as a pledge of\r\n   the love I bore her, and of the sincerity with which I thought and\r\n   spoke, and struggled for her freedom, the life of a young heart; and\r\n   with that life, the hopes, the honours, the endearments of a happy, a\r\n   prosperous, and honourable home. Proceed, then, my lords, with that\r\n   sentence which the law directs--I am prepared to hear it--I trust I\r\n   am prepared to meet its execution. I shall go, I think, with a light\r\n   heart before a higher tribunal--a tribunal where a Judge of infinite\r\n   goodness, as well as of infinite justice, will preside, and where, my\r\n   lords, many many of the judgments of this, world will be reversed.\"\r\n\r\nThere is little more for us to add. Meagher arrived with O'Brien,\r\nO'Donoghue, and M'Manus in Van Dieman's Land in October, 1849, and\r\nescaped to America in 1852. He started the _Irish News_ in New York,\r\nwhich he enriched by personal recollections of the stirring scenes in\r\nwhich he participated; but his career as a journalist closed abruptly\r\nwith the outbreak of the war of Secession, when he raised a Zouave\r\nCompany to join Corcoran's 69th Regiment, with which he fought gallantly\r\nat Bull's Run. Every one remembers how the gallantry of the Irish\r\nregiment in which Meagher served, saved the Federal forces from\r\nannihilation on that field of disaster. Subsequently he raised and\r\ncommanded the Irish Brigade, which won imperishable laurels throughout\r\nthe hard-fought campaigns that ended with the capture of Richmond. When\r\nMr. Johnson became President of the United States, he appointed Meagher\r\nto the position of Governor of Montana Territory, in the far West, a\r\npost which he held until his death.\r\n\r\nHis end was sad and sudden. One dark wild night in July, 1867, a\r\ngentleman suddenly disappeared from the deck of the steamer on which he\r\nwas standing, and fell into the great Missouri, where it winds its\r\ncourse by the hills of Montana. The accident was too sudden for availing\r\nassistance. A sudden slip, a splash, a faint cry, a brief struggle, and\r\nall was over; the hungry waters closed over him, and the rapid rolling\r\ncurrent swept away his lifeless corpse. The finished scholar, the genial\r\nfriend, the matchless orator, the ardent patriot was no more. Thomas\r\nFrancis Meagher was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEVIN IZOD O'DOHERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother bold, clever, and resolute opponent of British rule in Ireland\r\nwas torn from the ranks of the popular leaders on the day that Kevin\r\nIzod O'Doherty was arrested. Amongst the cluster of talented and able\r\nmen who led the Young Ireland phalanx, he was distinguished for his\r\nspirit and his mental accomplishments; amongst the organizers of the\r\nparty his ready words, manly address, and ceaseless activity gave him a\r\nprominent position; amongst its journalists he was conspicuous for\r\nfearlessness, frankness, and ability. Over the surging waves of the\r\nexcitement and agitation that convulsed the country during the period\r\nwhich ended with the affray at Ballingarry, and through the haze which\r\ntime has cast over the attempted revolution of '48, his figure looms up\r\nin bold proportions, suggestive of mental capacity, fortitude of soul,\r\nand tenacity of purpose. For him, as for many of his brilliant\r\nassociates, the paths of patriotism led down to proscription and pain;\r\nbut O'Doherty fulminating the thunderbolts of the _Tribune,_ or sowing\r\nthe seeds of patriotism amongst the students of Dublin, was not one whit\r\nmore self-possessed or undaunted than when standing a convict in the\r\nGreenstreet dock, he awaited the sentence of the court.\r\n\r\nKevin Izod O'Doherty was born of respectable Catholic parents in Dublin,\r\nin June, 1824. He received a liberal education, by which he profited\r\nextensively, showing even in his school-days strong evidences of natural\r\nability, and talents, of more than average degree. He directed his\r\nattention to the medical profession on completing his education, and was\r\nin the full tide of lectures and hospital attendance when the\r\ndevelopment of the national sentiment that pervaded the year '48 drew\r\nhim into the vortex of public life. He became a hard working and\r\nenthusiastic member of the Young Ireland party, and was one of the\r\nfounders of the Students' and Polytechnic Clubs, which were regarded by\r\nthe leaders in Dublin as the _elite_ of the national force in the\r\ncapital. When Mitchel was struck down and his paper suppressed,\r\nO'Doherty was one of those who resolved that the political guidance\r\nwhich the _United Irishman_ was meant to afford, should not be wanting\r\nto the people. In conjunction with Richard Dalton Williams--\"Shamrock\"\r\nof the _Nation_--he established the _Irish Tribune_, the first number of\r\nwhich saw the light on the 10th of June, 1848. There could be no mistake\r\nabout the objects of the _Tribune_, or the motives of its founders in\r\nestablishing it. The British government could ill afford to endure the\r\nattacks on their exactions and usurpations thundered forth weekly in its\r\narticles. Its career was cut short by the mailed hand of authority at\r\nits fifth number, and on the 10th of July, '48, Kevin Izod O'Doherty was\r\nan inmate of Newgate prison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES J. KICKHAM. JOHN O'LEARY. THOMAS CLARK LUBEY.]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of August he was placed at the bar of Green-street\r\ncourt-house, and arraigned on a charge of treason-felony, and a vigorous\r\neffort was made by the crown to convict him. The attempt, however, was a\r\nfailure; the jury-panel had not been juggled as effectively as usual,\r\nand a disagreement of the jury was the consequence. The crown, however,\r\nhad no idea of relaxing its grasp of its victim; after John Martin's\r\nconviction O'Doherty was put forward again, and a new jury selected to\r\ntry him. Again were the government defeated; the second jury like the\r\nfirst refused to agree to a verdict of guilty, and were discharged\r\nwithout convicting the prisoner. A third time was O'Doherty arraigned,\r\nand this time the relentless hatred of his persecutors was gratified by\r\na verdict of guilty. The speech delivered by Mr. O'Doherty after\r\nconviction was as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords--I did hope, I confess, that upon being placed in this dock\r\n   for the third time, after two juries of my fellow-citizens had\r\n   refused to find a verdict against me, that while my prosecutors would\r\n   have been scrupulous in their care in attempting to uphold their law,\r\n   they would not have violated the very spirit of justice.\"\r\n\r\n   Judge Crampton.--\"I have a great difficulty in preventing you from\r\n   making any observations that may occur to you to be of service; but\r\n   if you mean to cast imputations of obloquy upon the law officers of\r\n   the crown, the court cannot permit that.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. O'Doherty--\"I only wish to mention a matter of fact. The\r\n   Attorney-General stated that there were only three Roman Catholics\r\n   set aside on my jury.\"\r\n\r\n   Judge Crampton again interposed, and requested the prisoner not to\r\n   pursue this line of observation.\r\n\r\n   Mr. O'Doherty.--\"I would feel much obliged if your lordship would\r\n   permit me to mention a few more words with reference to my motives\r\n   throughout this affair.\r\n\r\n   \"I had but one object and purpose in view. I did feel deeply for the\r\n   sufferings and privations endured by my fellow-countrymen. I did wish\r\n   by all means, consistent with a manly and honourable resistance to\r\n   assist in putting an end to that suffering. It is very true, and I\r\n   will confess it, that I desired an open resistance of the people to\r\n   that government, which, in my opinion entailed these sufferings upon\r\n   them. I have used the words open and honourable resistance, in order\r\n   that I might refer to one of the articles brought in evidence against\r\n   me, in which the writer suggests such things as flinging burning\r\n   hoops on the soldiery. My lords, these are no sentiments of mine. I\r\n   did not write that article. I did not see it, or know of it until I\r\n   read it when published in the paper. But I did not bring the writer\r\n   of it here on the table. Why? I knew that if I were to do so, it\r\n   would be only handing him over at the court-house doors to what one\r\n   of the witnesses has very properly called the fangs of the\r\n   Attorney-General. With respect to myself I have no fears. I trust I\r\n   will be enabled to bear my sentence with all the forbearance due to\r\n   what I believe to be the opinion of twelve conscientious enemies to\r\n   me, and I will bear with due patience the wrath of the government\r\n   whose mouthpiece they were; but I will never cease to deplore the\r\n   destiny that gave me birth in this unhappy country, and compelled me,\r\n   as an Irishman, to receive at your hands a felon's doom, for\r\n   discharging what I conceived--and what I still conceive to be my\r\n   duty. I shall only add, that the fact is, that instead of three Roman\r\n   Catholic jurors being set aside by the Attorney-General, there were\r\n   thirteen; I hold in my hand a list of their names, and out of the\r\n   twelve jurors he permitted to be sworn there was not one Roman\r\n   Catholic.\"\r\n\r\nMr. O'Doherty was sentenced to transportation for ten years. He sailed\r\nfor Van Dieman's Land in the same ship that bore John Martin into exile.\r\nIn the course of time he, like Martin and O'Brien, was set at liberty on\r\ncondition of his residing anywhere out of \"the United Kingdom.\" He came\r\non to Paris, and there resumed his medical studies. He paid, however,\r\none secret and hurried visit to Ireland. He came to wed and bear away\r\nwith him, to share his fortune in other lands, a woman in every way\r\nworthy of him--one whose genius and talents, like his own, had been\r\nfreely given to the cause of Ireland, and whose heart had long been his\r\nin the bonds of a most tender attachment. \"Eva,\" one of the fair\r\npoetesses of the _Nation_, was the plighted wife of O'Doherty. Terrible\r\nmust have been the shock to her gentle nature when her patriot lover was\r\nborne off a convict, and shipped for England's penal settlements in the\r\nfar southern seas. She believed, however, they would meet again, and she\r\nknew that neither time nor distance could chill the ardour of their\r\nmutual affection. The volumes of the _Nation_ published during his\r\ncaptivity contain many exquisite lyrics from her pen mourning for the\r\nabsent one, with others expressive of unchanging affection, and the most\r\nintense faith in the truth of her distant lover. \"The course of true\r\nlove\" in this case ended happily. O'Doherty, as we have stated, managed\r\nto slip across from Paris to Ireland, and returned with \"Eva\" his bride.\r\nIn 1856 the pardons granted to the exiles above named was made\r\nunconditional, and in the following year O'Doherty returned to Ireland,\r\nwhere he took out his degrees with great _eclat_; he then commenced the\r\npractice of medicine and surgery in Dublin, and soon came to be ranked\r\namongst the most distinguished and successful members of his profession.\r\nAfter remaining some years in Ireland, Mr. O'Doherty sailed far away\r\nseawards once again, and took up his abode under the light of the\r\nSouthern Cross. He settled in a rising colony of Australia, where he\r\nstill lives, surrounded by troops of friends, and enjoying the position\r\nto which his talents and his high character entitle him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERENCE BELLEW M'MANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe excitement caused by the startling events of which this country was\r\nthe scene in the summer of 1848 extended far beyond the shores of\r\nIreland. Away beyond the Atlantic the news from Ireland was watched for\r\nwith glistening eyes by the exiles who dwelt by the shores of Manhattan\r\nor in the backwoods of Canada. Amongst the Irish colony in England the\r\nagitation was still greater. Dwelling in the hearts of the monster towns\r\nof England, the glow of the furnace lighting up their swarthy faces;\r\ntoiling on the canals, on the railways, in the steamboats; filling the\r\nfactories, plying their brawny hands where the hardest work was to be\r\ndone; hewers of wood, and drawers of water; living in the midst of the\r\nEnglish, yet separated from them by all the marks of a distinctive\r\nnationality, by antagonistic feelings, by clashing interests, by jarring\r\ncreeds; such was the position of the men who carried the faith, the\r\ntraditions, the politics, and the purpose of Ireland into the heart of\r\nthe enemy's country. With their countrymen at home they were united by\r\nthe warmest ties of sympathy and affection. In London, in Manchester, in\r\nBirmingham, in Leeds, Confederate Clubs were established, and active\r\nmeasures taken for co-operating with the Young Ireland leaders in\r\nwhatever course they might think proper to adopt. In Liverpool those\r\nclubs were organized on the most extensive scale; thousands of Irishmen\r\nattended their weekly meetings, and speeches rivalling those delivered\r\nat the Rotundo and at the Music Hall in fervour and earnestness were\r\nspoken from their platforms. Amongst the Irishmen who figured\r\nprominently at these gatherings there was one to whom the Irish in\r\nLiverpool looked up with peculiar confidence and pride. He was young, he\r\nwas accomplished, he was wealthy, he filled a highly respectable\r\nposition in society; his name was connected by everyone with probity and\r\nhonour; and, above all, he was a nationalist, unselfish, enthusiastic,\r\nand ardent. The Irishmen of Liverpool will not need to be told that we\r\nspeak of Terence Bellew M'Manus.\r\n\r\nThe agitation of 1848 found M'Manus in good business as a shipping\r\nagent, his income being estimated by his Liverpool friends at ten or\r\ntwelve hundred a year. His patriotism was of too genuine a nature to be\r\nmerged in his commercial success, and M'Manus readily abandoned his\r\nprospects and his position when his country seemed to require the\r\nsacrifice. Instantly on discovering that the government were about to\r\nsuspend the _Habeas Corpus_ Act in Ireland, he took the steamer for\r\nDublin, bringing with him the green and gold uniform which he owned in\r\nvirtue of being a general of the '82 Club. In the same steamer came two\r\ndetectives sent specially to secure his arrest in Dublin. M'Manus drove\r\nfrom the quay, where he landed, to the _Felon_ Office. He discovered\r\nthat all the Confederate leaders out of prison had gone southwards on\r\nhostile thoughts intent; and M'Manus resolved on joining them without a\r\nmoment's hesitation. Having managed to give the detectives the slip, he\r\njourneyed southwards to Tipperary and joined O'Brien's party at\r\nKillenaule. He shared the fortunes of the insurgent leaders until the\r\ndispersion at Ballingarry, where he fought with conspicuous bravery and\r\ndetermination. He was the first to arrive before the house in which the\r\npolice took refuge, and the last to leave it. The Rev. Mr. Fitzgerald,\r\nP.P., an eye witness, gives an interesting account of M'Manus' conduct\r\nduring the attack on the Widow M'Cormack's house. He says:--\r\n\r\n   \"With about a dozen men more determined than the rest, was M'Manus,\r\n   who indeed throughout the whole day showed more courage and\r\n   resolution than anyone else. With a musket in his hand, and in the\r\n   face of the enemy, he reconnoitered the place, and observed every\r\n   accessible approach to the house, and with a few colliers, under\r\n   cover of a cart-load of hay, which they pushed on before them, came\r\n   up to the postern-door of the kitchen. Here with his own hand he\r\n   fired several pistol-shots, to make it ignite, but from the state of\r\n   the weather, which was damp and heavy, and from the constant\r\n   down-pour of rain on the previous day, this attempt proved quite\r\n   unsuccessful. With men so expert at the use of the pickaxe, and so\r\n   large a supply of blasting powder at the collieries, he could have\r\n   quickly undermined the house, or blown it up; but the circumstance of\r\n   so many children being shut in with the police, and the certainty\r\n   that, if they persevered, all would be involved in the same ruin,\r\n   compelled him and his associates to desist from their purpose.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it became useless to offer further resistance, M'Manus retired with\r\nthe peasantry to the hills, and dwelt with them for several days. Having\r\nshaved off his whiskers, and made some other changes in his appearance,\r\nhe succeeded in running the gauntlet though the host of spies and\r\ndetectives on his trail, and he was actually on board a large vessel on\r\nthe point of sailing for America from Cork harbour when arrested by the\r\npolice. His discovery was purely accidental; the police boarded the\r\nvessel in chase of an absconding defaulter, but while prosecuting the\r\nsearch one of the constables who had seen M'Manus occasionally in\r\nLiverpool recognised him. At first he gave his name as O'Donnell, said\r\nhe was an Irish-American returning westward, after visiting his friends\r\nin the old land. His answers, however, were not sufficiently consistent\r\nto dissipate the constable's suspicion. He was brought ashore and taken\r\nhandcuffed before a magistrate, whereupon he avowed his name, and boldly\r\nadded that, he did not regret any act he had done, and would cheerfully\r\ngo through it again.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October, 1848, he was brought to trial for high treason\r\nin Clonmel. He viewed the whole proceedings with calm indifference, and\r\nwhen the verdict of guilty was brought in he heard the announcement with\r\nunaltered mien. A fortnight later he was brought up to receive sentence;\r\nMeagher and O'Donoghue had been convicted in the interim, and the three\r\nconfederates stood side by side in the dock to hear the doom of the\r\ntraitor pronounced against them. M'Manus was the first to speak in reply\r\nto the usual formality, and his address was as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords--I trust I am enough of a Christian and enough of a man to\r\n   understand the awful responsibility of the question which has been\r\n   put to me. Standing upon my native soil--standing in an Irish court\r\n   of justice, and before the Irish nation--I have much to say why the\r\n   sentence of death, or the sentence of the law, should not be passed\r\n   upon me. But upon entering into this court I placed my life--and what\r\n   is of more importance to me, my honour--in the hands of two\r\n   advocates, and if I had ten thousand lives and ten thousand honours,\r\n   I should be content to place them all in the watchful and glorious\r\n   genius of the one, and the patient zeal and talent of the other. I\r\n   am, therefore, content, and with regard to that I have nothing to\r\n   say. But I have a word to say, which no advocate, however anxious\r\n   and devoted he may be, can utter for me. I say, whatever part I may\r\n   have taken in the straggle for my country's independence, whatever\r\n   part I may have acted in my short career, I stand before you, my\r\n   lords, with a free heart and a light conscience, to abide the issue\r\n   of your sentence. And now, my lords, this is, perhaps, the fittest\r\n   time to put a sentence upon record, which is this--that standing in\r\n   this dock, and called to ascend the scaffold--it may be to-morrow--it\r\n   may be now--it may be never--whatever the result may be, I wish to\r\n   put this on record, that in the part I have taken I was not actuated\r\n   by enmity towards Englishmen--for among them I have passed some of\r\n   the happiest days of my life, and the most prosperous; and in no part\r\n   which I have taken was I actuated by enmity towards Englishmen\r\n   individually, whatever I may have felt of the injustice of English\r\n   rule in this island; I therefore say, that it is not because I loved\r\n   England less, but because I loved Ireland more, that I now stand\r\n   before you.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1851, M'Manus escaped from captivity in Van Dieman's Land, and he\r\nsoon after settled in California where he died. His funeral was the\r\ngreatest ever witnessed upon earth. From the shores of the Pacific\r\nthousands of miles away, across continents and oceans they brought him,\r\nand laid his ashes to rest in the land of his birth. On the 10th day of\r\nNovember, 1861, that wonderful funeral passed through the streets of\r\nDublin to Glasnevin, and those who saw the gathering that followed his\r\ncoffin to the grave, the thousands of stalwart men that marched in\r\nsolemn order behind his bier will never forget the sight. A silent slab\r\nunlettered and unmarked shows the spot where his remains were interred;\r\nno storied urn or animated bust, no marble column or commemorative\r\ntablet has been consecrated to his memory, but the history of his life\r\nis graven in the hearts of his countrymen, and he enjoys in their\r\naffectionate remembrance, a monument more enduring than human hands\r\ncould build him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CLARKE LUBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking along the course of Irish history, it is easy to point out\r\ncertain periods in which England could have found an opportunity for\r\nmaking terms with the Irish nation, healing some of the old wounds and\r\nmitigating in some degree the burning sense of wrong and the desire of\r\nvengeance that rankled in the hearts of the Irish race. There were lulls\r\nin the struggle, intervals of gloomy calm, occasions when the heart of\r\nIreland might have been touched by generous deeds, and when the offer of\r\nthe olive branch, or even a few of its leaves, would have had a blessed\r\neffect. But England never availed of them--never for an instant sought\r\nto turn them to good account. She preferred when Ireland was defeated,\r\nprostrate, and forlorn, to taunt her with her failure, scoff at her\r\nsufferings, and add to her afflictions. Such was her conduct during the\r\nmournful time that followed on the attempted insurrection of 1848.\r\n\r\nIt was an appaling time, in whose death-laden atmosphere political\r\naction was impossible. The famine had made of the country one huge\r\ngraveyard. A silence fell upon the land, lately so clamorous for her\r\nrights, so hopeful, and so defiant. The Repeal organization spoke no\r\nmore; the tramp of the Confederate Clubs was no longer heard in the\r\nstreets; O'Connell was dead; the Young Ireland leaders were fugitives or\r\nprisoners; and the people were almost bewildered by a sense of their\r\ngreat calamity. Then, if England had stooped to raise her fallen foe,\r\noffered her some kindly treatment, and spoken some gracious words, the\r\nbitterness of the old quarrel might have been in some degree assuaged,\r\neven though its cause should not be entirely obliterated. But England\r\ndid not choose to take that politic and Christian course. She found it\r\nmuch pleasanter to chuckle over the discomfiture of the Irish patriots,\r\nto ridicule the failure of their peaceable agitation, to sneer at their\r\npoor effort in arms, to nickname, and misrepresent, and libel the\r\nbrave-hearted gentleman who led that unlucky endeavour; and above all to\r\nfelicitate herself on the reduction that had taken place in the Irish\r\npopulation. That--from her point of view--was the glorious part of the\r\nwhole affair. The Irish were \"gone with a vengeance!\"--not all of them,\r\nbut a goodly proportion, and others were going off every day. Emigrant\r\nships clustered in the chief ports, and many sought their living\r\nfreights in those capacious harbours along the Atlantic coast which\r\nnature seemed to have shaped for the accommodation of a great commerce,\r\nbut where the visit of any craft larger than a fishing smack was a rare\r\nevent. The flaming placards of the various shipping-lines were posted in\r\nevery town in Ireland,--on the chapel-gates, and the shutters of closed\r\nshops, and the doors of tenantless houses; and there appeared to be in\r\nprogress a regular breaking up of the Irish nation. This, to the English\r\nmind, was positively delightful. For here was the Irish question being\r\nsettled at last, by the simple process of the transference of the Irish\r\npeople to the bottom of the deep sea, or else to the continent of\r\nAmerica--nearly the same thing as far as England was concerned, for in\r\nneither place--as it seemed to her--could they ever more trouble her\r\npeace, or have any claim on those fruits of the Irish soil which were\r\nneeded for the stomachs of Englishmen. There they could no longer pester\r\nher with petitions for Tenant Right, or demands for a Repeal of the\r\nUnion. English farmers, and drovers, and labourers, loyal to the English\r\ngovernment, and yielding no sort of allegiance to the Pope, would cross\r\nthe Channel and take possession of the deserted island, which would\r\nthenceforth be England's in such a sense as it never was before. O\r\nmagnificent consummation! O most brilliant prospect, in the eyes of\r\nEnglish statesmen! They saw their way clear, they understood their game;\r\nit was to lighten in no degree the pressure which they maintained upon\r\nthe lives of the Irish people, to do nothing that could tend to render\r\nexistence tolerable to them in Ireland, or check the rush of emigration.\r\nActing in conformity with this shallow and false estimate of the\r\nsituation, they allowed to drift away unused the time which wise\r\nstatesmen would have employed in the effectuation of conciliatory and\r\ntranquilising measures, and applied themselves simply to the crushing\r\nout from the Irish mind of every hope of improved legislation, and the\r\ndefeat of every effort to obtain it. Thus when the people--waking up\r\nfrom the stupefaction that followed on the most tragic period of the\r\nfamine--began to breathe the breath of political life again, and,\r\nperceiving the danger that menaced the existence of the peasant classes,\r\nset on foot an agitation to procure a reform of the land-laws, the\r\ngovernment resolutely opposed the project; defeated the bills which the\r\nfriends of the tenantry brought into parliament; and took steps, which\r\nproved only too successful, for the break up of the organization by\r\nwhich the movement was conducted. And then, when Frederick Lucas was\r\ndead, and Mr. Duffy had gone into exile, and the patriot priests were\r\ndebarred from taking part in politics, and Messrs. John Sadlier and\r\nWilliam Keogh were bought over by bribes of place and pay, the\r\ngovernment appeared to think that Irish patriotism had fought in its\r\nlast ditch, and received its final defeat.\r\n\r\nBut they were mistaken. The old cause that had survived so many\r\ndisasters was not dead yet. While the efforts of the Tenant Righters in\r\nIreland were being foiled, and their party was being scattered, a couple\r\nof Irishmen, temporarily resident in Paris, fugitive because of their\r\nconnexion with the events of '48, were laying the foundations of a\r\nmovement more profoundly dangerous to England, than any of those with\r\nwhich she had grappled since the days of Wolfe Tone and Lord Edward\r\nFitzgerald. Those men were John O'Mahony and James Stephens.\r\n\r\nSince then their names have been much heard of, and the organization of\r\nwhich they were the originators has played an important part in Irish\r\nhistory. But at the period of which we are now writing, the general\r\npublic knew nothing of O'Mahony or of Stephens beyond the fact that they\r\nwere alleged to have taken some part in the recent insurrectionary\r\ndemonstrations. Stephens, who was then a very young lad, had been\r\npresent at the Ballingarry attack, and had been severely wounded by the\r\nfire of the police. He managed to crawl away from the spot to a ditch\r\nside, where he was lost sight of. A report of his death was put into\r\ncirculation, and a loyal journal published in Kilkenny--the native town\r\nof the young rebel, who in this instance played his first trick on the\r\ngovernment--referred to his supposed decease in terms which showed that\r\nthe rule _de mortuis nil nisi bonum_ found acceptance with the editor.\r\nThe following are the words of the obituary notice which appeared in the\r\n_Kilkenny Moderator_ on or about the 19th of August, 1848:--\r\n\r\n   \"Poor James Stephens, who followed Smith O'Brien to the field, has\r\n   died of the wound which he received at Ballingarry whilst acting as\r\n   aide-de-camp to the insurgent leader. Mr. Stephens was a very\r\n   amiable, and apart from politics, most inoffensive young man,\r\n   possessed of a great deal of talent, and we believe he was a most\r\n   excellent son and brother. His untimely and melancholy fate will be\r\n   much regretted by a numerous circle of friends.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that his family very prudently fostered this delusion by\r\ngoing into mourning for the loss of young James--the suggestion of which\r\nclever ruse probably came from the dear boy himself. A short time\r\nafterwards he managed to escape, disguised as a lady's maid, to France.\r\nAs one may gather from the paragraph above quoted, the family were much\r\nrespected in the locality. Mr. Stephens, father of the future C.O.I.R.,\r\nwas clerk in the establishment of a respectable auctioneer and\r\nbookseller in Kilkenny. He gave his children a good education, and sent\r\nyoung James to a Catholic seminary with a view to his being taught and\r\ntrained for the priesthood. But circumstances prevented the realization\r\nof this design, and before any line of business could be marked out for\r\nyoung Stephens, the political events above referred to took place and\r\nshaped his future career.\r\n\r\nJohn O'Mahony was a different stamp of man. He belonged to the class\r\nknown as gentlemen-farmers, and of that class he was one of the most\r\nrespected. His family owned a considerable tract of land in the southern\r\npart of the County of Tipperary, of which they had been occupants for\r\nmany generations. He was well educated, of studious habits, and\r\nthoroughly imbued with patriotic feeling, which came to him as a\r\nhereditary possession. When the Young Ireland leaders were electrifying\r\nthe country by their spirited appeals to the patriotism and bravery of\r\nthe Irish race, and the population in all the chief centres of\r\nintelligence were crystalizing into semi-military organizations,\r\nO'Mahony was not apathetic or inactive. One of the strongest of the\r\nConfederate clubs--which were thick sown in the contiguous districts of\r\nthe Counties of Cork, Waterford, and Tipperary--was under his\r\npresidency; and when in July, 1848, the leaders of the movement\r\nscattered themselves over the country for the purpose of ascertaining\r\nthe degree of support they would receive if they should decide on\r\nunfurling the green banner, his report of the state of affairs in his\r\ndistrict was one of their most cheering encouragements.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the outbreak under O'Brien occurred at\r\nBallingarry. The failure of that attempt, and the irresolute manner in\r\nwhich it was conducted, had disheartened the country, but the idea of\r\nallowing the struggle to rest at that point was not universally\r\nentertained by the leaders of the clubs; and John O'Mahony was one of\r\nthose who resolved that another attempt should be made to rally the\r\npeople to the insurrectionary standard. He acted up to his resolution.\r\nOn the night of the 12th of September there were signal-fires on the\r\nslopes of Slievenamon and the Comeragh mountains, and the district\r\nbetween Carrick-on-Suir and Callan was in a state of perturbation. Next\r\nday the alarm was spread in all directions. The gentry of the disturbed\r\ndistricts rushed into the nearest towns for protection; police from the\r\noutlying barracks were called in to reinforce the threatened stations,\r\nand troops were hastily summoned from Dublin and the neighbouring\r\ngarrisons. Meanwhile parties of the insurgents began to move about. One\r\nproceeded to the police station at the Slate-quarries, and finding it\r\ndeserted--the policemen having retired on Piltown--burned it to the\r\nground. Another attempted the destruction of Grany bridge, to delay the\r\nadvance of the soldiery. A third proceeded to attack the Glenbower\r\nstation. The defenders of the barracks were in a rather critical\r\nposition when another party of police, on their way from the\r\nNine-Mile-House station to Carrick, came upon the spot, and the combined\r\nforce speedily put their half-armed assailants to flight, with a loss to\r\nthe latter of one man severely wounded and one killed. An attack was\r\nmade on the barrack at Portlaw, but with a like result; two men were\r\nstricken dead by the bullets of the police. The people soon afterwards\r\nscattered to their homes, and the soldiery and police had nothing to do\r\nbut hunt up for the leaders and other parties implicated in the\r\nmovement. John O'Mahony narrowly escaped capture on three or four\r\noccasions. He lingered in the country, however, until after the\r\nconviction of the state prisoners at Clonmel, when it became clear to\r\nhim that the cause was lost for a time; and he then took his way to\r\nParis, whither several of his fellow outlaws, for whose arrest the\r\ngovernment had offered large rewards, had gone before him.\r\n\r\nIn that famous centre of intellect and of intrigue, the focus of\r\npolitical thought, the fountain-head of great ideas, John O'Mahony and\r\nJames Stephens pondered long over the defeat that had come upon the\r\nIrish cause, and in their ponderings bethought them that the reason of\r\nthe failure which they deplored was to be found in the want of that\r\nquiet, earnest, secret preparation, by means of which the Continental\r\nrevolutionists were able to produce from time to time such volcanic\r\neffects in European politics, and cause the most firmly-rooted dynasties\r\nto tremble for their positions. The system of secret conspiracy--that\r\nancient system, \"old as the universe, yet not outworn\"--a system not\r\nunknown in Ireland from the days of the Attacots to those of the\r\nWhiteboys--the system of Sir Phelim O'Neill and of Theobald Wolfe\r\nTone--that system, as developed, refined, and elaborated by the most\r\nsubtle intellects of modern times, those two men proposed to propagate\r\namong the Irish race at home and abroad. They divided the labour between\r\nthem. O'Mahony took the United States of America for his field of\r\naction, and Stephens took the Old Country.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1858 that the first symptoms indicative of the work\r\nto which James Stephens had set himself made their appearance in the\r\nextreme south-west of Ireland. Whispers went about that some of the\r\nyoung men of Kenmare, Bantry, and Skibbereen were enrolled in a secret\r\nsworn organization, and were in the habit of meeting for the purpose of\r\ntraining and drilling. Indeed the members of the new society took little\r\npains to conceal its existence; they seemed rather to find a pride in\r\nthe knowledge which their neighbours had of the fact, and relied for\r\ntheir legal safety on certain precautions adopted in the manner of their\r\ninitiation as members. When informed firstly by well known nationalists\r\nin a private manner, and subsequently by public remonstrances addressed\r\nto them by Catholic clergymen and the national journals, that the\r\ngovernment were on their track, they refused to believe it; but ere long\r\nthey suffered grievously for their incredulity and want of prudence. In\r\nthe early days of December, 1858, the swoop of the government was made\r\non the members of the \"Phoenix Society\" in Cork and Kerry, and arrests\r\nfollowed shortly after in other parts of the country. The trials in the\r\nsouth commenced at Tralee in March, 1859, when a conviction was obtained\r\nagainst a man named Daniel O'Sullivan, and he was sentenced to penal\r\nservitude for ten years. The remaining cases were adjourned to the next\r\nassizes, and when they came on in July, 1859, the prisoners put in a\r\nplea of guilty, and were set at liberty on the understanding that if\r\ntheir future conduct should not be satisfactory to the authorities, they\r\nwould be called up for sentence. Amongst the Cork prisoners who took\r\nthis course was Jeremiah O'Donovan (Rossa), whose name has since then\r\nbeen made familiar to the public.\r\n\r\nThose events were generally supposed to have extinguished the Phoenix\r\nconspiracy. And many of Ireland's most sincere friends hoped that such\r\nwas the case. Recognising fully the peculiar powers which a secret\r\nsociety can bring to bear against the government, they still felt a\r\nprofound conviction that the risks, or rather the certain cost of\r\nliberty and life involved in such a mode of procedure, formed more than\r\na counterpoise for the advantages which it presented. They were\r\nconsequently earnest and emphatic in their endeavours to dissuade their\r\ncountrymen from treading in the dangerous paths in which their steps\r\nwere dogged by the spy and the informer. The Catholic clergy were\r\nespecially zealous in their condemnation of secret revolutionary\r\nsocieties, urged thereto by a sense of their duty as priests and\r\npatriots. But there were men connected with the movement both in America\r\nand Ireland, who were resolved to persevere in their design of extending\r\nthe organization among the Irish people, despite of any amount of\r\nopposition from any quarter whatsoever. In pursuit of that object they\r\nwere not over scrupulous as to the means they employed; they did not\r\nhesitate to violate many an honourable principle, and to wrong many an\r\nhonest man; nor did they exhibit a fair share of common prudence in\r\ndealing with the difficulties of their position; but unexpected\r\ncircumstances arose to favour their propagandism, and it went ahead\r\ndespite of all their mistakes and of every obstacle. One of those\r\ncircumstances was the outbreak of the civil war in America, which took\r\nplace in April, 1861. That event seemed to the leaders of the Irish\r\nrevolutionary organization, now known as the Fenian Brotherhood, to be\r\none of the most fortunate for their purposes that could have happened.\r\nIt inspired the whole population of America with military ardour, it\r\nopened up a splendid school in which the Irish section of the people\r\ncould acquire a knowledge of the art of war, which was exactly what was\r\nneeded to give real efficacy to their endeavours for the overthrow of\r\nBritish dominion in Ireland. Besides, there appeared to be a strong\r\nprobability that the line of action in favour of the Southern States\r\nwhich England, notwithstanding her proclamation of neutrality, had\r\nadopted from an early stage of the conflict, would speedily involve her\r\nin a war with the Federal government. These things constituted a\r\nprospect dazzling to the eyes of the Irishmen who had \"gone with a\r\nvengeance.\" Their hearts bounded with joy at the opportunities that\r\nappeared to be opening on them. At last the time was near, they\r\nbelieved, when the accumulated hate of seven centuries would burst upon\r\nthe power of England, not in the shape of an undisciplined peasantry\r\narmed with pikes, and scythes, and pitchforks, as in 1798--not in the\r\nshape of a half famished and empty-handed crowd, led to battle by\r\norators and poets, as in 1848, but in the shape of an army, bristling\r\nwith sharp steel, and flanked with thunderous cannon--an army skilled in\r\nthe modern science of war, directed by true military genius, and\r\ninspired by that burning valour which in all times was one of the\r\nqualities of the Irish race. Influenced by such hopes and feelings, the\r\nIrish of the Northern States poured by thousands into the Federal ranks,\r\nand formed themselves into regiments that were at the same time so many\r\nFenian circles. In the Southern army, too, there were many Irishmen who\r\nwere not less determined to give to their native land the benefit of\r\ntheir military experience, as soon as the troubles of their adopted\r\ncountry should be brought to an end. Fenianism, with that glow of light\r\nupon it, spread like a prairie-fire through the States. The ranks of the\r\norganization swelled rapidly, and money contributions poured like a tide\r\ninto its treasury. The impulse was felt also by the society in Ireland.\r\nIt received a rapid development, and soon began to put on a bold front\r\ntowards the government, and a still more belligerent one towards all\r\nIrishmen who, while claiming the character of patriots, declined to take\r\npart in the Fenian movement or recommend it to their countrymen. In\r\nNovember, 1863, the brotherhood started the _Irish People_ newspaper in\r\nDublin, for the double purpose of propagating their doctrines and\r\nincreasing the revenues of the society. James Stephens was the author of\r\nthis most unfortunate project. The men whom he selected for working it\r\nout were Thomas Clarke Luby, John O'Leary, and Charles Joseph Kickham.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of its establishment up to the mouth of September, 1865--a\r\nperiod of nearly two years--the _Irish People_ occupied itself in\r\npreaching what its editors regarded as the cardinal doctrines of the\r\nsociety, which were:--That constitutional agitation for the redress of\r\nIreland's grievances was worse than useless; that every man taking part\r\nin such agitation was either a fool or a knave; that in political\r\naffairs clergymen should be held of no more account than laymen; and\r\nthat the only hope for Ireland lay in an armed uprising of the people.\r\nThese doctrines were not quite new; not one of them was absolutely true;\r\nbut they were undoubtedly held by many thousands of Irishmen, and the\r\nFenian society took care to secure for the journal in which they were\r\nadvocated, a large circulation. The office of the _Irish People_ soon\r\ncame to be regarded as, what it really was, the head quarters of the\r\nFenian organization in Ireland. To it the choice spirits of the party\r\nresorted for counsel and direction; thither the provincial organisers\r\ndirected their steps whenever they visited Dublin; into it poured weekly\r\nfrom all parts of the country an immense mass of correspondence, which\r\nthe editors, instead of destroying after it had passed through their\r\nhands, foolishly allowed to accumulate upon their shelves, though every\r\nword of it was fraught with peril to the lives and liberties of their\r\nfriends. In their private residences also they were incautious enough to\r\nkeep numerous documents of a most compromising character. There is but\r\none way of accounting for their conduct in this matter. They may have\r\nsupposed that the legal proceedings against them, which they knew were\r\ncertain to take place at one time or another, would be conducted in the\r\nsemi-constitutional fashion which was adopted towards the national\r\njournals in 1848. If the staff of the _Irish People_ had received a\r\nsingle day's notice that they were about to be made amenable to the law,\r\nit is possible that they would have their houses and their office\r\nimmediately cleared of those documents which afterwards consigned so\r\nmany of their countrymen to the horrors of penal servitude. But they saw\r\nno reason to suppose that the swoop was about to be made on them. On the\r\nfifteenth day of September, 1865, there were no perceptible indications\r\nthat the authorities were any more on the alert in reference to Fenian\r\naffairs then they had been during the past twelve months. It was Friday;\r\nthe _Irish People_ had been printed for the next day's sale, large\r\nbatches of the paper had been sent off to the agents in town and\r\ncountry, the editors and publishing clerks had gone home to rest after\r\ntheir week's labours--when suddenly, at about half-past nine o'clock in\r\nthe evening, a strong force of police broke into the office, seized the\r\nbooks, manuscripts, papers, and forms of type, and bore them off to the\r\nCastle yard. At the same time arrests of the chief Fenian leaders were\r\nbeing made in various parts of the city. The news created intense\r\nexcitement in all circles of society, and more especially amongst the\r\nFenians themselves, who had never dreamed of a government _coup_ so\r\nsudden, so lawless, and so effective. The government had now thrown off\r\nthe mask of apathy and impassiveness which it had worn so long, and it\r\ncommenced to lay its strong hand upon its foes. Amongst the men who\r\nfilled the prison cells on that miserable autumn evening were John\r\nO'Leary, Thomas Clarke Luby, and Jeremiah O'Donovan (Rossa). Before the\r\ncrown was ready to proceed with their trial, the third editor of the\r\npaper, Charles J. Kickham, was added to their company, having been\r\narrested with James Stephens, Edward Duffy, and Hugh Brophy, on the 11th\r\nNovember, at Fairfield House, near Dublin.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, November 27th, 1865, the state trials commenced before a\r\nSpecial Commission in the Courthouse, Green-street--the scene of so many\r\na previous grapple between British law and the spirit of Irish\r\npatriotism. Mr. Justice Keogh and Mr. Justice Fitzgerald were the\r\npresiding judges. There was a long list of prisoners to be tried. James\r\nStephens might have been honoured with the first place amongst them,\r\nwere it not that two days previously, to the unspeakable horror and\r\nsurprise of the government and all its friends, he had effected his\r\nescape, or rather, we might say, obtained, by the aid of friendly hands,\r\nhis release from Richmond prison. In his regretted absence, the crown\r\ncommenced their proceedings by placing Thomas Clarke Luby in the dock to\r\nanswer to a charge of treason-felony.\r\n\r\nHe stood up to the bar, between the jailors that clustered about him, a\r\nquiet-faced, pale, and somewhat sad-looking man, apparently of about\r\nforty years of age. A glance around the court-house showed him but few\r\nfriendly faces--for, owing to the terrors felt by the judges, the crown\r\nprosecutors and other officials of the law, who dreaded the desperate\r\nresolves of armed conspirators, few were admitted into the building\r\nexcept policemen, detectives, and servants of the crown in one capacity\r\nor another. In one of the galleries, however, he recognised his\r\nwife--daughter of J. De Jean Fraser, one of the sweetest poets of the\r\n'48 period--with the wife of his fellow-prisoner, O'Donovan Rossa, and\r\nthe sister of John O'Leary. A brief smile of greeting passed between the\r\nparty, and then all thoughts were concentrated on the stern business of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nThere was no chance of escape for Thomas Clarke Luby or for his\r\nassociates. The crown had a plethora of evidence against them, acquired\r\nduring the months and years when they appeared to be all but totally\r\nignorant of the existence of the conspiracy. They had the evidence of\r\nthe approver, Nagle, who had been an employè of the _Irish People_\r\noffice and a confidential agent of James Stephens up to the night of the\r\narrests, but who during the previous eighteen months had been betraying\r\nevery secret of theirs to the government. They had the evidence of a\r\nwhole army of detectives; but more crushing and fatal than all, they had\r\nthat which was supplied by the immense store of documents captured at\r\nthe _Irish People_ office and the houses of some of the chief members of\r\nthe conspiracy. Of all those papers the most important was one found at\r\nthe residence of Mr. Luby, in which James Stephens, being at the time\r\nabout to visit America delegated his powers over the organization in\r\nIreland, England, and Scotland to Thomas Clarke Luby, John O'Leary, and\r\nCharles J. Kickham. This, which was referred to during the trials as the\r\n\"executive document,\" was worded as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"I hereby empower Thomas Clarke Luby, John O'Leary and Charles J.\r\n   Kickham a committee of organization, or executive, with the same\r\n   supreme control over the home organization, England, Ireland, and\r\n   Scotland, as that exercised by myself. I further empower them to\r\n   appoint a committee of military inspection, and a committee of appeal\r\n   and judgment, the functions of which committee will be made known to\r\n   every member of them. Trusting to the patriotism and abilities of the\r\n   executive, I fully endorse their actions beforehand. I call on every\r\n   man in our ranks to support and be guided by them in all that\r\n   concerns the military brotherhood.\r\n\r\n   \"J. STEPHENS.\"\r\n\r\nNot all the legal ingenuity and forensic eloquence of their talented\r\ncounsel, Mr. Butt, could avail to save the men who, by the preservation\r\nof such documents as the foregoing, had fastened the fetters on their\r\nown limbs. The trial of Mr. Luby concluded on the fourth day of the\r\nproceedings--Friday, December 1st 1865--with a verdict of guilty. The\r\nprisoner heard the announcement with composure, and then, in response to\r\nthe question usual in such cases, addressed the court as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Well, my lords and gentlemen, I don't think any person present here\r\n   is surprised at the verdict found against me. I have been prepared\r\n   for this verdict ever since I was arrested, although I thought it my\r\n   duty to fight the British government inch by inch. I felt I was sure\r\n   to be found guilty, since the advisers of the Crown took what the\r\n   Attorney-General was pleased the other day to call the 'merciful\r\n   course.' I thought I might have a fair chance of escaping, so long as\r\n   the capital charge was impending over me; but when they resolved on\r\n   trying me under the Treason-Felony Act, I felt that I had not the\r\n   smallest chance. I am somewhat embarrassed at the present moment as\r\n   to what I should say under the circumstances. There are a great many\r\n   things that I would wish to say; but knowing that there are other\r\n   persons in the same situation with myself, and that I might allow\r\n   myself to say something injudicious, which would peril their cases, I\r\n   feel that my tongue is to a great degree tied. Nothwithstanding,\r\n   there are two or three points upon which I would say a few words. I\r\n   have nothing to say to Judge Keogh's charge to the jury. He did not\r\n   take up any of the topics that had been introduced to prejudice the\r\n   case against me; for instance, he did not take this accusation of an\r\n   intention to assassinate, attributed to my fellow-prisoners and\r\n   myself. The Solicitor-General in his reply to Mr. Butt, referred to\r\n   those topics. Mr. Barry was the first person who advanced those\r\n   charges. I thought they were partially given up by the\r\n   Attorney-General in his opening statement, at least they were put\r\n   forward to you in a very modified form; but the learned\r\n   Solicitor-General, in his very virulent speech, put forward those\r\n   charges in a most aggravated manner. He sought even to exaggerate\r\n   upon Mr. Barry's original statement. Now, with respect to those\r\n   charges--in justice to my character--I must say that in this court,\r\n   there is not a man more incapable of anything like massacre or\r\n   assassination than I am. I really believe that the gentlemen who have\r\n   shown so much ability in persecuting me, in the bottom of their\r\n   hearts believe me incapable of an act of assassination or massacre. I\r\n   don't see that there is the smallest amount of evidence to show that\r\n   I ever entertained the notion of a massacre of landlords and priests.\r\n   I forget whether the advisers of the crown said I intended the\r\n   massacre of the Protestant clergymen. Some of the writers of our\r\n   enlightened press said that I did. Now, with respect to the charge of\r\n   assassinating the landlords, the only thing that gives even the\r\n   shadow of a colour to that charge is the letter signed--alleged to be\r\n   signed--by Mr. O'Keefe. Now, assuming--but by no means admitting, of\r\n   course--that the letter was written by Mr. O'Keefe, let me make a\r\n   statement about it. I know the facts that I am about to state are of\r\n   no practical utility to me now, at least with respect to the judges.\r\n   I know it is of no practical utility to me, because I cannot give\r\n   evidence on my own behalf, but it may be of practical utility to\r\n   others with whom I wish to stand well. I believe my words will carry\r\n   conviction--and carry much more conviction than any words of the\r\n   legal advisers of the crown can--to more than 300,000 of the Irish\r\n   race in Ireland, England, and America. Well, I deny absolutely, that\r\n   I ever entertained any idea of assassinating the landlords, and the\r\n   letter of Mr. O'Keefe--assuming it to be his letter--is the only\r\n   evidence on the subject. My acquaintance with Mr. O'Keefe was of the\r\n   slightest nature. I did not even know of his existence when the\r\n   _Irish People_ was started. He came, after that paper was established\r\n   a few months, to the office, and offered some articles--some were\r\n   rejected, some we inserted, and I call the attention of the legal\r\n   advisers of the Crown to this fact, that amongst the papers which\r\n   they got, those that were Mr. O'Keefe's articles had many paragraphs\r\n   scored out; in fact we put in no article of his without a great deal\r\n   of what is technically called 'cutting down.' Now, that letter of his\r\n   to me was simply a private document. It contained the mere private\r\n   views of the writer; and I pledge this to the court as a man of\r\n   honour--and I believe in spite of the position in which I stand,\r\n   amongst my countrymen I am believed to be a man of honour, and that\r\n   if my life depended on it, I would not speak falsely about the\r\n   thing--when I read that letter, and the first to whom I gave it was\r\n   my wife, I remember we read it with fits of laughter at its\r\n   ridiculous ideas. My wife at the moment said--'Had I not better burn\r\n   the letter?' 'Oh no,' I said, looking upon it as a most ridiculous\r\n   thing, and never dreaming for a moment that such a document would\r\n   ever turn up against me, and produce the unpleasant consequences it\r\n   has produced--mean the imputation of assassination and massacre,\r\n   which has given me a great deal more trouble than anything else in\r\n   this case. That disposes--as far as I can at present dispose of\r\n   it--of the charge of wishing to assassinate the landlords. As to the\r\n   charge of desiring to assassinate the priests, I deny it as being the\r\n   most monstrous thing in the world. Why, surely, every one who read\r\n   the articles in the paper would see that the plain doctrine laid\r\n   down there was--to reverence the priests so long as they confined\r\n   themselves to their sacerdotal functions; but when the priest\r\n   descended to the arena of politics he became no more than any other\r\n   man, and would just be regarded as any other man. If he was a man of\r\n   ability and honesty, of course he would get the respect that such men\r\n   get in politics--if he was not a man of ability there would be no\r\n   more thought of him than of a shoemaker or any one else. This is the\r\n   teaching of the _Irish People_ with regard to the priests. I believe\r\n   the _Irish People_ has done a great deal of good, even amongst those\r\n   who do not believe in its revolutionary doctrines. I believe the\r\n   revolutionary doctrines of the _Irish People_ are good. I believe\r\n   nothing can ever save Ireland except independence; and I believe that\r\n   all other attempts to ameliorate the condition of Ireland are mere\r\n   temporary expedients and make shifts----\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. Justice Keogh--\"I am very reluctant to interrupt you, Mr. Luby.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. Luby--\"Very well, my lord, I will leave that. I believe in this\r\n   way the _Irish People_ has done an immensity of good. It taught the\r\n   people not to give up their right of private judgment in temporal\r\n   matters to the clergy; that while they reverenced the clergy upon the\r\n   altar, they should not give up their consciences in secular matters\r\n   to the clergy. I believe that is good. Others may differ from me. No\r\n   set of men I believe ever set themselves earnestly to any work, but\r\n   they did good in some shape or form.\"\r\n\r\n   Judge Keogh--\"I am most reluctant, Mr. Luby, to interrupt you, but do\r\n   you think you should pursue this!\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. Luby--\"Very well, I will not. I think that disposes of those\r\n   things. I don't care to say much about myself. It would be rather\r\n   beneath me. Perhaps some persons who know me would say I should not\r\n   have touched upon the assassination charge at all--that in fact I\r\n   have rather shown weakness in attaching so much importance to it.\r\n   But, with regard to the entire course of my life, and whether it be a\r\n   mistaken course or not will be for every man's individual judgment to\r\n   decide--this I know, that no man ever loved Ireland more than I have\r\n   done--no man has ever given up his whole being to Ireland to the\r\n   extent I have done. From the time I came to what has been called the\r\n   years of discretion, my entire thought has been devoted to Ireland. I\r\n   believed the course I pursued was right; others may take a different\r\n   view. I believe the majority of my countrymen this minute, if,\r\n   instead of my being tried before a petty jury, who, I suppose, are\r\n   bound to find according to British law--if my guilt or innocence was\r\n   to be tried by the higher standard of eternal right, and the case was\r\n   put to all my countrymen--I believe this moment the majority of my\r\n   countrymen would pronounce that I am not a criminal, but that I have\r\n   deserved well of my country. When the proceedings of this trial go\r\n   forth into the world, people will say the cause of Ireland is not to\r\n   be despaired of, that Ireland is not yet a lost country--that as long\r\n   as there are men in any country prepared to expose themselves to\r\n   every difficulty and danger in its service, prepared to brave\r\n   captivity, even death itself if need be, that country cannot be\r\n   lost. With these words I conclude.\"\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of this address, Judge Keogh proceeded to pass\r\nsentence on the prisoner. The prisoner's speech, he said, was in every\r\nway creditable to him; but the bench could not avoid coming to the\r\nconclusion that, with the exception of James Stephens, he was the person\r\nmost deeply implicated in the conspiracy. The sentence of the court was\r\nthat he be kept in penal servitude for a term of twenty years. Mr. Luby\r\nheard the words without any apparent emotion--gave one sad farewell\r\nglance to his wife and friends, and stepping down the little stairs from\r\nthe dock, made way for the next prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN O'LEARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the jury in the case of Thomas Clarke Luby were absent from the\r\ncourt deliberating on and framing their verdict, John O'Leary was put\r\nforward to the bar.\r\n\r\nHe stepped boldly to the front, with a flash of fire in his dark eyes,\r\nand a scowl on his features, looking hatred and defiance on judges,\r\nlawyers, jurymen, and all the rest of them. All eyes were fixed on him,\r\nfor he was one of those persons whose exterior attracts attention and\r\nindicates a character above the common. He was tall, slightly built, and\r\nof gentlemanly deportment; every feature of his thin angular face gave\r\ntoken of great intellectual energy and determination, and its pallid hue\r\nwas rendered almost death-like by contrast with his long black hair and\r\nflowing moustache and beard. Easy it was to see that when the government\r\nplaced John O'Leary in the dock they had caged a proud spirit, and an\r\nable and resolute enemy. He had come of a patriot stock, and from a part\r\nof Ireland where rebels to English rule were never either few or\r\nfaint-hearted. He was born in the town of Tipperary, of parents whose\r\ncircumstances were comfortable, and who, at the time of their decease,\r\nleft him in possession of property worth a couple of hundred pounds per\r\nannum. He was educated for the medical profession in the Queen's\r\nCollege, Cork, spent some time in France, and subsequently visited\r\nAmerica, where he made the acquaintance of the chief organisers of the\r\nFenian movement, by whom he was regarded as a most valuable acquisition\r\nto the ranks of the brotherhood. After his return to Ireland he\r\ncontinued to render the Fenian cause such services as lay in his power,\r\nand when James Stephens, who knew his courage and ability, invited him\r\nto take the post of chief editor of the Fenian organ which he was about\r\nto establish in Dublin, O'Leary readily obeyed the call, and accepted\r\nthe dangerous position. In the columns of the _Irish People_ he laboured\r\nhard to defend and extend the principles of the Fenian organization\r\nuntil the date of his arrest and the suppression of the paper.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted from Friday, the 1st, up to Wednesday, the 6th of\r\nDecember, when it was closed with a verdict of guilty and a sentence of\r\ntwenty years' penal servitude--Mr. Justice Fitzgerald remarking that no\r\ndistinction in the degree of criminality could be discovered between the\r\ncase of the prisoner and that of the previous convict. The following is\r\nthe address delivered by O'Leary, who appeared to labour under much\r\nexcitement, when asked in the usual terms if he had any reason to show\r\nwhy sentence should not be passed upon him:--\r\n\r\n   \"I was not wholly unprepared for this verdict, because I felt that\r\n   the government which could so safely pack the bench could not fail to\r\n   make sure of its verdict.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. Justice Fitzgerald--\"We are willing to hear anything in reason\r\n   from you, but we cannot allow language of that kind to be used.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. O'Leary--\"My friend Mr. Luby did not wish to touch on this matter\r\n   from a natural fear lest he should do any harm to the other political\r\n   prisoners; but there can be but little fear of that now, for a jury\r\n   has been found to convict me of this conspiracy upon the evidence.\r\n   Mr. Luby admitted that he was technically guilty according to British\r\n   law; but I say that it is only by the most torturing interpretation\r\n   that these men could make out their case against me. With reference\r\n   to this conspiracy there has been much misapprehension in Ireland,\r\n   and serious misapprehension. Mr. Justice Keogh said in his charge\r\n   against Mr. Luby that men would be always found ready for money, or\r\n   for some other motive, to place themselves at the disposal of the\r\n   government; but I think the men who have been generally bought in\r\n   this way, and who certainly made the best of the bargain, were\r\n   agitators and not rebels. I have to say one word in reference to the\r\n   foul charge upon which that miserable man, Barry, has made me\r\n   responsible.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. Justice Fitzgerald--\"We cannot allow that tone of observation.\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. O'Leary continued--\"That man has charged me--I need not defend\r\n   myself or my friends from the charge. I shall merely denounce the\r\n   moral assassin. Mr. Justice Keogh the other day spoke of revolutions,\r\n   and administered a lecture to Mr. Luby. He spoke of cattle being\r\n   driven away, and of houses being burned down, that men would be\r\n   killed, and so on. I would like to know if all that does not apply to\r\n   war as well as to revolution? One word more, and I shall have done. I\r\n   have been found guilty of treason or treason-felony. Treason is a\r\n   foul crime. The poet Dante consigned traitors to, I believe, the\r\n   ninth circle of hell; but what kind of traitors? Traitors against\r\n   king, against country, against friends and benefactors. England is\r\n   not my country; I have betrayed no friend, no benefactor. Sidney and\r\n   Emmet were legal traitors, Jeffreys was a loyal man, and so was\r\n   Norbury. I leave the matter there.\"\r\n\r\nOne hour after the utterance of these words John O'Leary, dressed in\r\nconvict garb, his hair clipped, and his beard shaved off, was the\r\noccupant of a cell in Mountjoy prison, commencing his long term of\r\nsuffering in expiation of the crime of having sought to obtain\r\nself-government for his native land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH O'DONOVAN (ROSSA).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the preceding pages we have mentioned the fact that at the\r\nCork Summer Assizes of 1859, a conviction was recorded against Jeremiah\r\nO'Donovan (Rossa) for his complicity in the Phoenix conspiracy, and he\r\nwas then released on the understanding that if he should be found\r\nengaging in similar practices, the crown would bring him up for\r\njudgment. It is characteristic of the man that with this conviction\r\nhanging like a mill-stone about his neck, he did not hesitate to take an\r\nactive and an open part with the promoters of the Fenian movement. He\r\ntravelled through various parts of Ireland in furtherance of the objects\r\nof the society; he visited America on the same mission, and when the\r\n_Irish People_ was started he took the position of business manager in\r\nthat foredoomed establishment.\r\n\r\nHe was brought into the dock immediately after John O'Leary had been\r\ntaken from it; but on representing that certain documents which he had\r\nnot then at hand were necessary for his defence, he obtained a\r\npostponement of his trial for a few days. When he was again brought up\r\nfor trial he intimated to the court that he meant to conduct his own\r\ndefence. And he entered upon it immediately. He cross-examined the\r\ninformers in fierce fashion, he badgered the detectives, he questioned\r\nthe police, he debated with the crown lawyers, he argued with the\r\njudges, he fought with the crown side all round. But it was when the\r\nlast of the witnesses had gone off the table that he set to the work in\r\ngood earnest. He took up the various publications that had been put in\r\nevidence against him, and claimed his legal right to read them all\r\nthrough. One of them was the file of the _Irish People_ for the whole\r\nterm of its existence! Horror sat upon the faces of judges, jurymen,\r\nsheriffs, lawyers, turnkeys, and all, when the prisoner gravely informed\r\nthem that as a compromise he would not insist upon reading the\r\nadvertisements! The bench were unable to deny that the prisoner was\r\nentitled to read, if not the entire, at any rate a great portion of the\r\nvolume, and O'Donovan then applied himself to the task, selecting his\r\nreadings more especially from those articles in which the political\r\ncareer of Mr. Justice Keogh was made the subject of animadversion. Right\r\non he read, his lordship striving to look as composed and indifferent as\r\npossible, while every word of the bitter satire and fierce invective\r\nwritten against him by Luby and O'Leary was being launched at his heart.\r\nWhen articles of that class were exhausted, the prisoner turned to the\r\nmost treasonable and seditious documents he could find, and commenced\r\nthe reading of them, but the judges interposed; he claimed to be allowed\r\nto read a certain article--Judge Keogh objected--he proposed to read\r\nanother--that was objected to also--he commenced to read another--he was\r\nstopped--he tried another--again Judge Keogh was down on him--then\r\nanother--and he fared no better. So the fight went on throughout the\r\nlive-long day, till the usual hour of adjournment had come and gone, and\r\nthe prisoner himself was feeling parched, and weary, and exhausted.\r\nObserving that the lights were being now renewed, and that their\r\nlordships appeared satisfied to sit out the night, he anxiously inquired\r\nif the proceedings were not to be adjourned till morning. \"Proceed,\r\nsir,\" was the stern reply of the judge, who knew that the physical\r\npowers of the prisoner could not hold out much longer. \"A regular\r\nNorbury,\" gasped O'Donovan. \"It's like a '98 trial.\" \"You had better\r\nproceed, sir, with propriety,\" exclaimed the judge. \"When do you propose\r\nstopping, my lord?\" again inquired the prisoner. \"Proceed, sir,\" was the\r\nreiterated reply. O'Donovan could stand it no longer. He had been\r\nreading and speaking for eight hours and a half. With one final protest\r\nagainst the arrangement by which Judge Keogh was sent to try the cases\r\nof men who had written and published such articles against him, he sat\r\ndown, exclaiming that, \"English law might now take its course.\"\r\n\r\nNext day the jury handed down their verdict of guilty. The\r\nAttorney-General then addressed the court, and referred to the previous\r\nconviction against the prisoner. O'Donovan was asked, what he had to say\r\nin reference to that part of the case? and his reply was that \"the\r\ngovernment might add as much as they pleased to the term of his sentence\r\non that account, if it was any satisfaction to them.\" And when the like\r\nquestion was put to him regarding the present charge, he said:--\r\n\r\n   \"With the fact that the government seized papers connected with my\r\n   defence and examined them--with the fact that they packed the\r\n   jury--with the fact that the government stated they would\r\n   convict--with the fact that they sent Judge Keogh, a second Morbury,\r\n   to try me--with these facts before me, it would be useless to say\r\n   anything.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Keogh proceeded to pass sentence. \"The prisoner,\" he said, \"had\r\nentertained those criminal designs since the year 1859;\" whereupon\r\nO'Donovan broke in with the remark that he was \"an Irishman since he was\r\nborn.\" The judge said, \"he would not waste words by trying to bring him\r\nto a sense of his guilt;\" O'Donovan's reply was--\"It would be useless\r\nfor you to try it.\" The judge told him his sentence was, that he be kept\r\nin penal servitude for the term of his natural life. \"All right, my\r\nlord,\" exclaimed the unconquerable rebel, and with a smile to the\r\nsympathising group around him, he walked with a light step from the\r\ndock.\r\n\r\nThe court was then adjourned to the 5th of January. 1866; and next day\r\nthe judges set off for Cork city, to dispose of the Fenian prisoners\r\nthere awaiting trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRYAN DILLON, JOHN LYNCH, AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, December 16th, the trial of O'Donovan (Rossa) was brought\r\nto a conclusion in Dublin. Next morning, away went judges, crown\r\nlawyers, spies, detectives, and informers for the good city of Cork,\r\nwhere another batch of men accused of conspiring against British rule in\r\nIreland--\"the old crime of their race\"--were awaiting the pronouncement\r\nof British law upon their several cases. Cork city in these days was\r\nknown to be one of the _foci_ of disaffection; perhaps it was its chief\r\nstronghold. The Metropolis may have given an absolutely larger number of\r\nmembers to the Fenian organization, but in proportion to the number of\r\nits population the Southern city was far more deeply involved in the\r\nmovement. In Dublin, the seat of British rule in Ireland, many\r\ninfluences which are but faintly represented in other parts of the\r\ncountry, are present and active to repress the national ardour of the\r\npeople. Those influences are scarcely felt in the city of Saint Finbar.\r\nNot in Ireland is there a town in which the national sentiment is\r\nstronger or more widely diffused than in Cork. The citizens are a\r\nwarm-hearted, quick-witted and high-spirited race, gifted with fine\r\nmoral qualities, and profoundly attached to the national faith in\r\nreligion and politics. Merchants, traders, professional men,\r\nshopkeepers, artizans, and all, are comparatively free from the spells\r\nof Dublin Castle, and the result is visible in their conduct. The crown\r\nlooks dubiously and anxiously upon a Cork jury; the patriot, when any\r\nwork for Ireland is in hand, looks hopefully to the Cork people. The\r\nleaders of the Fenian movement thoroughly understood these facts, and\r\ndevoted much of their time and attention to the propagation of their\r\nsociety among men so well inclined to welcome it. Their labours, if\r\nlabours they could be called, were rewarded with a great measure of\r\nsuccess. The young men of Cork turned into the organization by hundreds.\r\nThere was no denying the fact; every one knew it; evidences of it were\r\nto be seen on all sides. The hope that was filling their hearts revealed\r\nitself in a thousand ways: in their marchings, their meetings, their\r\nsongs, their music. The loyal party in the neighbourhood grew alarmed,\r\nand the government shared their apprehensions. At the time of which we\r\nwrite, the opinion of the local magistracy and that of the authorities\r\nat Dublin Castle was that Cork was a full-charged mine of \"treason.\"\r\n\r\nThither was the Commission now sped, to carry terror, if the \"strong arm\r\nof the law\" could do it, into the hearts of those conspirators \"against\r\nthe royal name, style, and dignity\" of her Majesty Queen Victoria. As no\r\none in the Castle could say to what desperate expedients those people\r\nmight have recourse, it was thought advisable to take extraordinary\r\nprecautions to ensure the safety of the train which carried those\r\nimportant personages, her Majesty's judges, lawyers, witnesses and\r\ninformers, through the Munster counties and on to the city by the Lee.\r\n\"Never before\" writes the special correspondent of the _Nation_, \"had\r\nsuch a sight been witnessed on an Irish railway as that presented on\r\nThursday along the line between Dublin and Cork. Armed sentries paced\r\neach mile of the railway; the platforms of the various stations through\r\nwhich the trains passed were lined with bodies of constabulary, and the\r\nbridges and viaducts on the way were guarded by a force of military,\r\nwhose crimson coats and bright accoutrements stood out in bold relief\r\nfrom the dark ground on which they were stationed, against the grey\r\nDecember sky. As a further measure of precaution a pilot engine steamed\r\nin advance of the train in which their lordships sat, one carriage of\r\nwhich was filled with armed police. And so, in some such manner as Grant\r\nor Sheridan might have journeyed along the Petersburgh and Lynchburg\r\nrailway while the flag of the Confederacy floated in Richmond, the two\r\njudges travelled down in safety to the head-quarters of Fenianism in\r\nMunster.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately on their arrival in Cork, the judges proceeded to the\r\ncourt-house and formally opened the business of the Commission. Next day\r\nCharles Underwood O'Connell and John M'Afferty were placed in the dock.\r\nThese two men belonged to a class which formed the hope of the Fenian\r\norganization, and which the government regarded as one of the most\r\ndangerous elements of the conspiracy. They were Irish-American soldiers,\r\ntrained to war, and inured to the hardships of campaigning in the great\r\nstruggle which had but recently closed in America. They were a sample of\r\nthe thousands of Irishmen who had acquired in that practical school the\r\nmilitary knowledge which they knew was needed for the efficient\r\ndirection of an insurrectionary movement in Ireland, and, who were now\r\nburning for the time and opportunity to turn that knowledge to account.\r\nIt was known that many of these men were, as quietly and secretly as\r\nmight be, dropping into Queenstown as steamer after steamer arrived from\r\nthe Land of the West, and were moving about through the Southern\r\ncounties, inspiriting the hearts of the Brotherhood by their presence\r\nand their promises, and imparting to them as much military instruction\r\nas was possible under the circumstances. To hunt down these \"foreign\r\nemissaries\" as the crown lawyers and the loyal prints were pleased to\r\ncall them, and to deter others from following in their footsteps, was\r\nnaturally a great object with the government, and when they placed\r\nCharles Underwood O'Connell and John M'Afferty in the dock they felt\r\nthey had made a good beginning. And these were representative men in\r\ntheir way. \"It was a strange fate,\" says the writer from whom we have\r\nalready quoted, \"which had brought these men together in a felon's dock.\r\nThey had been born in different lands--they had been reared thousands of\r\nmiles apart--and they had fought and won distinction under different\r\nflags, and on opposing sides in the American war. M'Afferty, born of\r\nIrish parents in Ohio, won his spurs in the Confederate army. O'Connell,\r\nwho emigrated from Cork little more than two years ago, after the ruin\r\nof his family by a cruel act of confiscation and eviction, fought under\r\nthe Stars and Stripes, and, like M'Afferty, obtained a captain's\r\ncommission as the reward of his services. Had they crossed each others\r\npath two years ago they would probably have fought _a la mort_, but the\r\nold traditions which linger in spite of every circumstance in the hearts\r\nof Irishmen were strong in both, and the cause of Ireland united them,\r\nonly alas, that they might each of them pay the cost of their honest, if\r\nimprudent enthusiasm, by sharing the same prison in Ireland, and falling\r\nwithin the grasp of the government which they looked on as the oppressor\r\nof their fatherland.\"\r\n\r\nM'Afferty however was not fated to suffer on that occasion. Proof of his\r\nforeign birth having been adduced, the court held that his arrest on\r\nboard the steamer in Queenstown harbour, when he had committed no overt\r\nact evidencing a treasonable intent, was illegal, and his trial was\r\nabandoned. The trial of Underwood O'Connell was then postponed for a few\r\ndays, and two men reputed to be \"centres\" of the organization in Cork,\r\nwere brought to the bar.\r\n\r\nThey were Bryan Dillon and John Lynch. Physically, they presented a\r\ncontrast to the firm-built and wiry soldiers who had just quitted the\r\ndock. Dillon was afflicted with curvature of the spine, the result of\r\nan accident in early life, and his companion was far gone in that\r\nblighting and fatal disease, consumption. But though they were not men\r\nfor the toils of campaigning, for the mountain march, and the bivouac,\r\nand the thundering charge of battle, they had hearts full of enthusiasm\r\nfor the cause in which they were engaged, and heads that could think,\r\nand plot, and plan, for its advancement.\r\n\r\nWe need not here go through the sad details of their trials. Our purpose\r\nis to bring before our readers the courage and the constancy of the\r\nmartyrs to the cause of Irish nationality, and to record the words in\r\nwhich they gave expression to the patriotic sentiments that inspired\r\nthem. It is, however, to be recollected that many of the accused at\r\nthese commissions--men as earnest, as honest, and as devoted to the\r\ncause of their country as any that ever lived--made no such addresses\r\nfrom the dock as we can include in this volume. All men are not orators,\r\nand it will often occur that one who has been tried for life and liberty\r\nin a British court of law, on the evidence of spies and informers, will\r\nhave much to press upon his mind, and many things more directly relevant\r\nto the trial than any profession of political faith would be, to say\r\nwhen called upon to show reason why sentence should not be passed upon\r\nhim. The evidence adduced in these cases is usually a compound of truth\r\nand falsehood. Some of the untruths sworn to are simply blunders,\r\nresulting from the confused impressions and the defective memory of the\r\nwitnesses, others are deliberate inventions, made, sworn to, backed up,\r\nand persevered in for the purpose of insuring a successful result for\r\nthe prosecution. Naturally the first impulse of the accused, when he is\r\nallowed to speak for himself, is to refer to these murderous falsehoods;\r\nand in the excitement and trouble of those critical moments, it is all\r\nthat some men can venture to do. Such criticisms of the prosecution are\r\noften valuable to the prisoner from a moral point of view, but rarely\r\nhave they any influence upon the result of the trial. All things\r\nconsidered, it must be allowed that they act best who do not forget to\r\nspeak the words of patriotism, according to the measure of their\r\nabilities, before the judge's fiat has sealed their lips, and the hand\r\nof British law has swept them away to the dungeon or the scaffold.\r\n\r\n\"Guilty\" was the verdict returned by the jury against Bryan Dillon and\r\nJohn Lynch. The evidence against them indeed was strong, but its chief\r\nstrength lay in the swearing of an approver named Warner, a callous and\r\nunscrupulous wretch, from whose mind the idea of conscience seemed to\r\nhave perished utterly. If there was any check upon the testimony of this\r\ndepraved creature, it existed only in some prudential instinct,\r\nsuggesting to him that even in such cases as these a witness might\r\npossibly overdo his work, and perhaps in a caution or two given him in a\r\nprivate and confidential manner by some of the managers of the\r\nprosecution. Warner's evidence in this case was conclusive to the minds\r\nof all who chose to believe it; and therefore it was that those\r\nprisoners had not long been occupants of the dock when the question was\r\nput to them what they had to say why sentence should not be passed on\r\nthem. In reply Bryan Dillon said:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords, I never was for one minute in Warner's company. What\r\n   Warner swore about me was totally untrue. I never was at a meeting at\r\n   Geary's house. The existence of the Fenian organization has been\r\n   proved sufficiently to your lordships. I was a centre in that\r\n   organization; but it does not follow that I had to take the chair at\r\n   any meeting, as it was a military organization. I do not want to\r\n   conceal anything. Warner had no connexion with me whatever. With\r\n   respect to the observation of the Attorney-General, which pained me\r\n   very much, that it was intended to seize property, it does not follow\r\n   because of my social station that I intended to seize the property of\r\n   others. My belief in the ultimate independence of Ireland is as fixed\r\n   as my religious belief--\"\r\n\r\nAt this point he was interrupted by Judge Keogh, who declared he could\r\nnot listen to words that were, in fact, a repetition of the prisoner's\r\noffence. But it was only words of this kind that Bryan Dillon cared to\r\nsay at the time; and as the privilege of offering some remarks in\r\ndefence of his political opinions--a privilege accorded to all prisoners\r\nin trials for treason and treason-felony up to that time--had been\r\ndenied to him, he chose to say no more. And then the judge pronounced\r\nthe penalty of his offending, which was, penal servitude for a term of\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nJohn Lynch's turn to speak came next. Interrogated in the usual form, he\r\nstood forward, raised his feeble frame to its full height, and with a\r\nproud, grave smile upon his pallid features, he thus addressed the\r\ncourt:--\r\n\r\n   \"I will say a very few words, my lords. I know it would be only a\r\n   waste of public time if I entered into any explanations of my\r\n   political opinions--opinions which I know are shared by the vast\r\n   majority of my fellow-countrymen. Standing here as I do will be to\r\n   them the surest proof of my sincerity and honesty. With reference to\r\n   the statement of Warner, all I have to say is, and I say it honestly\r\n   and solemnly, that I never attended a meeting at Geary's, that I\r\n   never exercised with a rifle there, that I never learned the use of\r\n   the rifle, nor did any of the other things he swore to. With respect\r\n   to my opinions on British rule in this country--\"\r\n\r\n   Mr. Justice Keogh--\"We can't hear that.\"\r\n\r\n   The Prisoner--\"All I have to say is, that I was not at Geary's house\r\n   for four or five months before my arrest, so that Warner's statement\r\n   is untrue. If, having served my country honestly and sincerely be\r\n   treason, I am not ashamed of it. I am now prepared to receive any\r\n   punishment British law can inflict on me.\"\r\n\r\nThe punishment decreed to this pure-minded and brave-spirited patriot\r\nwas ten years of penal servitude. But to him it was practically a\r\nsentence of death. The rigours and horrors of prison life were more than\r\nhis failing constitution could long endure; and but a few months from\r\nthe date of his conviction elapsed when his countrymen were pained by\r\nthe intelligence that the faithful-hearted John Lynch filled a nameless\r\ngrave in an English prison-yard. He died in the hospital of Woking\r\nprison on the 2nd day of June, 1866.\r\n\r\nWhen Bryan Dillon and John Lynch were removed from the dock (Tuesday,\r\nDecember 19th), two men named Jeremiah Donovan and John Duggan were put\r\nforward, the former charged with having been a centre in the Fenian\r\norganization, and the latter with having sworn some soldiers into the\r\nsociety. Both were found guilty. Donovan made no remarks when called\r\nupon for what he had to say. Duggan contradicted the evidence of the\r\nwitnesses on several points, and said:--\r\n\r\n   \"I do not state those things in order to change the sentence I am\r\n   about to receive. I know your lordships' minds are made up on that. I\r\n   state this merely to show what kind of tools the British government\r\n   employ to procure those convictions. I have only to say, and I appeal\r\n   to any intelligent man for his opinion, that the manner in which the\r\n   jury list was made out for these trials clearly shows that in this\r\n   country political trials are a mere mockery.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the judge cut short the prisoner's address, and the two\r\nmen were sentenced, Donovan to five years and Duggan to ten years of\r\npenal servitude.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Underwood O'Connell was then proceeded with. It concluded\r\non December 21st, with a verdict of guilty. In response to the question\r\nwhich was then addressed to him he spoke at considerable length,\r\ndetailing the manner of his arrest, complaining of the horrible\r\nindignities to which he had been subjected in prison, and asserting that\r\nhe had not received a fair and impartial trial. He spoke amidst a\r\nrunning fire of interruptions from the court, and when he came to refer\r\nto his political opinions his discourse was peremptorily suppressed.\r\n\"The sentiments and hopes that animate me,\" he said, \"are well known.\"\r\n\"Really we will not hear those observations,\" interposed Mr. Justice\r\nKeogh. \"It has been brought forward here,\" said the prisoner, \"that I\r\nheld a commission in the 99th regiment--in Colonel O'Mahony's regiment.\r\nProud as I am of having held a commission in the United States service,\r\nI am equally proud of holding command under a man--.\" Here his speech\r\nwas stopped by the judges, and Mr. Justice Keogh proceeded to pass\r\nsentence. In the course of his address his lordship made the following\r\nobservations:--\r\n\r\n   \"You, it appears, went to America; you entered yourself in the\r\n   American army, thus violating, to a certain extent, your allegiance\r\n   as a British subject. But that is not the offence you are charged\r\n   with here to-day. You say you swore allegiance to the American\r\n   Republic, but no man by so doing can relieve himself from his\r\n   allegiance to the British Crown. From the moment a man is born in\r\n   this country he owes allegiance, he is a subject.\"\r\n\r\nHearing these words, and remembering the great outcry that was being\r\nmade by the friends of the government against the Irish-American Fenians\r\non the ground that they were \"foreigners,\" the prisoner interposed the\r\napt remark on his lordship's legal theory:--\r\n\r\n   \"If that is so, why am I charged with bringing over foreigners--John\r\n   O'Mahony is no foreigner?\"\r\n\r\nTo that remark Judge Keogh did not choose to make any reply. It\r\noverturned him completely. Nothing could better exhibit the absurdity of\r\nrailing against those Irishmen as \"foreigners\" in one breath, and in the\r\nnext declaring their allegiance to the British Crown perpetual and\r\ninalienable. His lordship may have winced as the point was so quickly\r\nand neatly brought home to him; but at all events he went on with his\r\naddress and informed the prisoner that his punishment was to be ten\r\nyears of penal servitude. Upon which, the comment of the prisoner as he\r\nquitted the dock, was that he hoped there would be an exchange of\r\nprisoners before that time.\r\n\r\nIn quick succession four men named Casey, Began, Hayes, and Barry, were\r\ntried, convicted, and sentenced. Each in turn impugned the evidence of\r\nthe informer Warner, protested against the constitution of the juries,\r\nand attempted to say a few words declaratory of their devotion to the\r\ncause of Ireland. But the judges were quick to suppress every attempt of\r\nthis kind, and only a few fragments of sentences are on record to\r\nindicate the thoughts to which these soldiers of liberty would have\r\ngiven expression if the opportunity had not been denied to them.\r\n\r\nJohn Kennealy was the next occupant of the dock. He was a young man of\r\nhigh personal character, and of great intelligence, and was a most\r\nuseful member of the organization, his calling--that of commercial\r\ntraveller--enabling him to act as agent and missionary of the Society\r\nwithout attracting to himself the suspicion which would be aroused by\r\nthe movements of other men. In his case also the verdict was given in\r\nthe one fatal word. And when asked what he had to say for himself, his\r\nreply was in these few forcible and dignified sentences:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lord, it is scarcely necessary for me to say anything. I am sure\r\n   from the charge of your lordship, the jury could find no other\r\n   verdict than has been found. The verdict against me has been found by\r\n   the means by which political convictions have always been found in\r\n   this country. As to the informer, Warner, I have only to say that\r\n   directly or indirectly I never was in the same room with him, nor had\r\n   he any means of knowing my political opinions. As to my connexion\r\n   with Mr. Luby, I am proud of that connexion. I neither regret it, nor\r\n   anything else I have done, politically or otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of this trial, on Saturday, January 2nd, 1866, two\r\nother cases were postponed without option of bail; some other persons\r\nwere allowed to stand out on sureties, and we read that \"John McAfferty\r\nand William Mackay, being aliens, were admitted to bail on their own\r\nrecognizance, and Judge Keogh said that if they left the country they\r\nwould not be required up for trial when called.\" We read also, in the\r\nnewspapers of that time, that \"The prisoners McAfferty and Mackay when\r\nleaving the courts were followed by large crowds who cheered them loudly\r\nthrough the streets.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cork Commission was then formally closed, and next day the judges\r\nset off to resume in Dublin the work of trying Irish conspirators\r\nagainst the rule of England over their native land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES JOSEPH KICKHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1825, in the village of Mullinahone, County. Tipperary,\r\nCharles J. Kickham first saw the light. His father, John Kickham, was\r\nproprietor of the chief drapery establishment in that place, and was\r\nheld in high esteem by the whole country round about for his integrity,\r\nintelligence, and patriotic spirit. During the boyhood of young Kickham\r\nthe Repeal agitation was at its height, and he soon became thoroughly\r\nversed in its arguments, and inspired by its principles, which he often\r\nheard discussed in his father's shop and by his hearth, and amongst all\r\nhis friends and acquaintances. Like all the young people of the time,\r\nand a great many of the old ones, his sympathies went with the Young\r\nIreland party at the time of their withdrawal from the Repeal ranks. In\r\n1848 he was the leading spirit of the Confederation Club at Mullinahone,\r\nwhich he was mainly instrumental in founding; and after the _fiasco_ at\r\nBallingarry he was obliged to conceal himself for some time, in\r\nconsequence of the part he had taken in rousing the people of his native\r\nvillage to action. When the excitement of that period had subsided, he\r\nagain appeared in his father's house, resumed his accustomed sports of\r\nfishing and fowling, and devoted much of his time to literary pursuits,\r\nfor which he had great natural capacity, and towards which he was all\r\nthe more inclined because of the blight put upon his social powers by an\r\nunfortunate accident which occurred to him when about the age of\r\nthirteen years. He had brought a flask of powder near the fire, and was\r\nengaged either in the operation of drying it or casting some grains into\r\nthe coals for amusement, when the whole quantity exploded. The shock and\r\nthe injuries he sustained nearly proved fatal to him; when he recovered,\r\nit was with his hearing nearly quite destroyed, and his sight\r\npermanently impaired. But Kickham had the poet's soul within him, and it\r\nwas his compensation for the losses he had sustained. He could still\r\nhold communion with nature and with his own mind, and could give to the\r\nnational cause the service of a bold heart and a finely-cultivated\r\nintellect. Subsequent to the decadence of the '48 movement he wrote a\r\ngood deal in prose and verse, and contributed gratuitously to various\r\nnational publications. His intimate acquaintance with the character and\r\nhabits of the peasantry gave a great charm to his stories and sketches\r\nof rural life; and his poems were always marked by grace, simplicity,\r\nand tenderness. Many of them have attained a large degree of popularity\r\namongst his countrymen in Ireland and elsewhere, and taken a permanent\r\nplace in the poetic literature of the Irish race. Amongst these, his\r\nballads entitled \"Patrick Sheehan,\" \"Rory of the Hill,\" and \"The Irish\r\nPeasant Girl\" are deserving of special mention. To these remarks it\r\nremains to be added that as regards personal character, Charles J.\r\nKickham was one of the most amiable of men. He was generous and kindly\r\nby nature, and was a pious member of the Catholic Church, to which his\r\nfamily had given priests and nuns.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man whom the myrmidons of the law placed in the dock of\r\nGreen-street court-house, when on January 5th, 1866, after the return of\r\nthe judges from Cork, the Commission was re-opened in Dublin. His\r\nappearance was somewhat peculiar. He was a tall, strong, rough-bearded\r\nman, with that strained expression of face which is often worn by people\r\nof dim sight. Around his neck he wore an india-rubber tube, or ear\r\ntrumpet, through which any words that were necessary to be addressed to\r\nhim were shouted into his ear by some of his friends, or by his\r\nsolicitor. His trial did not occupy much time, for on the refusal of the\r\ncrown lawyers and judges to produce the convict Thomas Clarke Luby, whom\r\nhe conceived to be a material witness for his defence, he directed his\r\nlawyers to abandon the case, and contented himself with reading to the\r\ncourt some remarks on the evidence which had been offered against him.\r\nThe chief feature in this address was his denial of all knowledge of the\r\n\"executive document.\" He had never seen or heard of it until it turned\r\nup in connexion with those trials. Referring to one of the articles with\r\nthe authorship of which he was charged, he said he wondered how any\r\nIrishman, taking into consideration what had occurred in Ireland during\r\nthe last eighty-four years, could hesitate to say to the enemy--\"Give us\r\nour country to ourselves and let us see what we can do with it.\"\r\nAlluding to a report that the government contemplated making some\r\nconcession to the claims of the Catholic bishops, he remarked that\r\nconcessions to Ireland had always been a result of Fenianism in one\r\nshape or another, and that he believed the present manifestation of the\r\nnational spirit would have weight, as former ones had, with the rulers\r\nof the country. As regards the landed class in Ireland, the _Irish\r\nPeople_, he contended, had said nothing more than was said by Thomas\r\nDavis, whose works every one admired. That eminent Irishman, afflicted\r\nand stung to the heart by witnessing the system of depopulation which\r\nwas going on throughout the country, had written these words:--\r\n\r\n   \"God of Justice, I sighed, send your Spirit down\r\n     On those lords so cruel and proud,\r\n   And soften their hearts, and relax their frown,\r\n     Or else, I cried aloud,\r\n   Vouchsafe Thy strength to the peasant's hand\r\n   To drive them at length from out the land.\"\r\n\r\nHe had not gone farther than the writer of these lines, and now, he\r\nsaid, they might send him to a felon's doom if they liked.\r\n\r\nAnd they did send him to it. Judge Keogh, before passing sentence, asked\r\nhim if he had any further remarks to make in reference to his case. Mr.\r\nKickham briefly replied:--\r\n\r\n   \"I believe, my lords, I have said enough already. I will only add\r\n   that I am convicted for doing nothing but my duty. I have endeavoured\r\n   to serve Ireland, and now I am prepared to suffer for Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThen the judge, with many expressions of sympathy for the prisoner, and\r\nmany compliments in reference to his intellectual attainments, sentenced\r\nhim to kept in penal servitude for fourteen years. His solicitor, Mr.\r\nJohn Lawless, announced the fact to him through his ear trumpet. Charles\r\nJ. Kickham bowed to the judges, and with an expression of perfect\r\ntranquility on his features, went into captivity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL THOMAS F. BURKE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL THOMAS F. BURKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year of grace, 1867, dawned upon a cloudy and troublous period in\r\nIrish politics. There was danger brewing throughout the land; under the\r\ncrust of society the long confined lava of Fenianism effervesced and\r\nglowed. There were strange rumours in the air; strange sounds were heard\r\nat the death of night on the hill-sides and in the meadows; and through\r\nthe dim moonlight masses of men were seen in secluded spots moving in\r\nregular bodies and practising military evolutions. From castle and\r\nmansion and country seat the spectre of alarm glided to and fro,\r\nwhispering with bloodless lips of coming convulsions and slaughter, of\r\nthe opening of the crater of revolution, and of a war against property\r\nand class. Symptoms of danger were everywhere seen and felt; the spirit\r\nof disaffection had not been crushed; it rode on the night wind and\r\nglistened against the rising sun; it filled rath and fort and crumbling\r\nruin with mysterious sounds; it was seen in the brightening eyes and the\r\nbold demeanour of the peasantry; in the signals passing amongst the\r\npeople; in their secret gatherings and closely guarded conclaves. For\r\nyears and years Fenianism had been threatening, boasting, and promising,\r\nand now the fury of the storm, long pent-up, was about to burst forth\r\nover the land--the hour for action was at hand.\r\n\r\nBetween the conviction of Luby, O'Leary, and Kickham, and the period at\r\nwhich we are now arrived, many changes of importance had taken place in\r\nthe Fenian organization. In America, the society had been\r\nrevolutionized--it had found new leaders, new principles, new plans of\r\naction; it had passed through the ordeal of war, and held its ground\r\namidst flashing swords and the smoke of battle; it had survived the\r\nshocks of division, disappointment, and failure; treachery, incapacity\r\nand open hostility had failed to shatter it; and it grew apace in\r\nstrength, influence, and resources. At home Fenianism, while losing\r\nlittle in numerical strength, had declined in effectiveness, in\r\nprestige, in discipline, and in organization. Its leaders had been swept\r\ninto the prisons, and though men perhaps as resolute stepped forward to\r\nfill the vacant places, there was a loss in point of capacity and\r\nintelligence, and to the keen observer it became apparent that the\r\nFenian Society in Ireland had attained to the zenith of its power on the\r\nday that the _Irish People_ office was sacked by the police. Never again\r\ndid the prospects of Fenianism, whatever they might then have been, look\r\nequally bright; and when the brotherhood at length sprang to action,\r\nthey fought with a sword already broken to the hilt, and under\r\ncircumstances the most ominous and inauspicious.\r\n\r\nThe recent history of the Fenian movement is so thoroughly understood\r\nthat anything like a detailed account of its changes and progress is, in\r\nthese pages, unnecessary. We shall only say that when James Stephens\r\narrived in America in May, 1866, after escaping from Richmond Prison, he\r\nfound the society in the States split up into two opposing parties\r\nbetween whom a violent quarrel was raging. John O'Mahony had been\r\ndeposed from his position of \"Head Centre\" by an all but unanimous vote\r\nof the Senate, or governing body of the association, who charged him and\r\nhis officials with a reckless and corrupt expenditure of the society's\r\nfunds, and these in turn charged the Senate party with the crime of\r\nbreaking up the organization for mere personal and party purposes. A\r\nlarge section of the society still adhered to O'Mahony, in consideration\r\nof his past services in their cause; but the greater portion of it, and\r\nnearly all its oldest, best-known and most trusted leaders gave their\r\nallegiance to the Senate and to its elected President, William R.\r\nRoberts, an Irish merchant of large means, of talent and energy, of high\r\ncharacter and unquestionable devotion to the cause of his country. Many\r\nfriends of the brotherhood hoped that James Stephens would seek to heal\r\nthe breach between these parties, but the course he took was not\r\ncalculated to effect that purpose. He denounced the \"senators\" in the\r\nmost extravagant terms, and invited both branches of the organization to\r\nunite under himself as supreme and irresponsible leader and governor of\r\nthe entire movement. The O'Mahony section did not answer very heartily\r\nto this invitation; the Senate party indignantly rejected it, and\r\ncommenced to occupy themselves with preparations for an immediate\r\ngrapple with British power in Canada. Those men were thoroughly in\r\nearnest, and the fact became plain to every intelligence, when in the\r\nlatter part of May, 1866, the Fenian contingents from the various States\r\nof the Union began to concentrate on the Canadian border. On the morning\r\nof the 1st of June some hundreds of them crossed the Niagara river, and\r\ntook possession of the village of Fort Erie on the Canadian side. They\r\nwere soon confronted with detachments of the volunteer force which had\r\nbeen collected to resist the invasion, and at Limestone Ridge they were\r\nmet by the \"Queen's Own\" regiment of volunteers from Toronto, under the\r\ncommand of Colonel Booker. A smart battle ensued, the result of which\r\nwas that the \"Queen's Own\" were utterly routed by the Irish under\r\nColonel John O'Neill, and forced to run in wild confusion for a town\r\nsome miles distant, Colonel Booker on his charger leading the way and\r\ndistancing all competitors. Had the Irish been allowed to follow up this\r\nvictory it is not unlikely that they would have swept Canada clear of\r\nthe British forces, and then, according to their programme, made that\r\ncountry their base of operations against British power in Ireland. But\r\nthe American government interfered and put an effectual stopper on their\r\nprogress; they seized the arms of the Irish soldiers on the frontier,\r\nthey sent up large parties of the States soldiery to prevent the\r\ncrossing of hostile parties into British territory, and stationed\r\nwar-vessels in the river for the same purpose. Reinforcements being thus\r\ncut off from them, the victors of Limestone Ridge found themselves under\r\nthe necessity of re-crossing the river to the American shore, which they\r\ndid on the night of the 2nd of June, bringing with them the flags and\r\nother trophies which they had captured from the royal troops.\r\n\r\nThe first brush between the Fenian forces and the Queen's troops\r\ninspired the former with high hopes, and with great confidence in their\r\ncapacity to humble \"the English red below the Irish green,\" if only they\r\ncould start on any thing like fair terms. But now that the American\r\ngovernment had forbidden the fight in Canada, what was to be done? James\r\nStephens answered that question. He would have a fight in Ireland--the\r\nright place, he contended, in which to fight _for_ Ireland. The home\r\norganization was subject to his control and would spring to arms at his\r\nbidding. He would not only bid them fight, but would lead them to\r\nbattle, and that at no distant day. The few remaining months of 1866\r\nwould not pass away without witnessing the commencement of the struggle.\r\nSo he said, and so he swore in the most solemn manner at various public\r\nmeetings which he had called for the purpose of obtaining funds\r\nwherewith to carry on the conflict. The prudence of thus publishing the\r\ndate which he had fixed for the outbreak of the insurrection was very\r\ngenerally questioned, but however great might be his error in this\r\nrespect, many believed that he would endeavour to make good his words.\r\nThe British government believed it, and prepared for the threatened\r\nrising by hurrying troops and munitions of war across to Ireland, and\r\nputting the various forts and barracks in a state of thorough defence.\r\nAs the last days and nights of 1866 wore away, both the government and\r\nthe people expected every moment to hear the first crash of the\r\nstruggle. But it came not. The year 3867 came in and still all was\r\nquiet. What had become of James Stephens? The astonished and irate\r\nFenians of New York investigated the matter, and found that he was\r\npeacefully and very privately living at lodgings in some part of that\r\ncity, afraid to face the wrath of the men whom he had so egregiously\r\ndeceived. We need not describe the outburst of rage and indignation\r\nwhich followed on the discovery; suffice it to say that the once popular\r\nand powerful Fenian leader soon found it prudent to quit the United\r\nStates and take up his abode in a part of the world where there were no\r\nFenian circles and no settlements of the swarming Irish race.\r\n\r\nAmongst the men who had rallied round James Stephens in America there\r\nwere many whose honesty was untainted, and who had responded to his call\r\nwith the full intention of committing themselves, without regard to\r\nconsequences, to the struggle which he promised to initiate. They\r\nbelieved his representations respecting the prospects of an insurrection\r\nin Ireland, and they pledged themselves to fight by his side and perish,\r\nif necessary, in the good old cause, in defence of which their fathers\r\nhad bled. They scorned to violate their engagements; they spurned the\r\nidea of shrinking from the difficulty they had pledged themselves to\r\nface, and resolved that come what may the reproach of cowardice and bad\r\nfaith should never be uttered against them. Accordingly, in January,\r\n'67, they began to fend in scattered parties at Queenstown, and spread\r\nthemselves through the country, taking every precaution to escape the\r\nsuspicion of the police. They set to work diligently and energetically\r\nto organize an insurrectionary outbreak; they found innumerable\r\ndifficulties in their path; they found the people almost wholly unarmed;\r\nthey found the wisest of the Fenian leaders opposed to an immediate\r\noutbreak, but still they persevered. How ably they performed their work\r\nthere is plenty of evidence to show, and if the Irish outbreak of '67\r\nwas short-lived and easily suppressed, it was far from contemptible in\r\nthe pre-concert and organization which it evidenced.\r\n\r\nOne hitch did occur in the accomplishment of their designs. On\r\nWednesday, February 13th, the exciting news was flashed throughout the\r\nland that the Fenians had broken into insurrection at Kerry. The news\r\nwas true. The night of the 12th of February had been fixed for a\r\nsimultaneous rising of the Fenians in Ireland; but the outbreak had been\r\nsubsequently postponed, and emissaries were despatched to all parts of\r\nthe country with the intelligence of the change of date. The change of\r\ndate was everywhere learned in time to prevent premature action except\r\nat Cahirciveen, in the west of Kerry, where the members of the\r\nBrotherhood, acting upon the orders received, unearthed their arms, and\r\ngaily proceeded towards Killarney to form a junction with the insurgents\r\nwhom they imagined had converged from various parts of the county in\r\nthat town. Before many hours had elapsed they discovered their\r\nmistake--they heard before arriving at Killarney that they were the only\r\nrepresentatives of the Irish Republic that had appeared in the field,\r\nand turning to the mountains they broke up and disappeared.\r\n\r\nShort-lived as was their escapade, it filled the heart of England with\r\nalarm. In hot haste the _Habeas Corpus_ Suspension Act, which had been\r\npermitted to lapse a month before, was re-enacted; the arrests and\r\npolice raids was renewed, and from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear\r\nthe gaols were filled with political prisoners. Still the\r\nIrish-Americans worked on; some of them were swept off to prison, but\r\nthe greater number of them managed to escape detection, and spite of the\r\nvigilance of the authorities, and the extraordinary power possessed by\r\nthe government and its officials, they managed to carry on the business\r\nof the organization, to mature their plans, and to perfect their\r\narrangements for the fray.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to write here a detailed account of the last of the\r\noutbreaks which, since the Anglo-Norman invasion, have periodically\r\nconvulsed our country. The time is not yet come when the whole history\r\nof that extraordinary movement can be revealed, and such of its facts,\r\nas are now available for publication, are fresh in the minds of our\r\nreaders. On the night of the 5th of March, the Fenian bands took the\r\nfield in Dublin, Louth, Tipperary, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, and Clare.\r\nThey were, in all cases, wretchedly armed, their plans had been betrayed\r\nby unprincipled associates, and ruin tracked their venture from the\r\noutset. They were everywhere confronted by well-armed, disciplined men,\r\nand their reckless courage could not pluck success for the maze of\r\nadverse circumstances that surrounded them. The elements, too,\r\nbefriended England as they had often done before. Hardly had the\r\ninsurgents left their homes when the clear March weather gave place to\r\nthe hail and snow of mid-winter. The howling storm, edged by the frost\r\nand hail, swept over mountain and valley, rendering life in the open air\r\nall but impossible to man. The weather in itself would have been\r\nsufficient to dispose of the Fenian insurgents. Jaded and exhausted they\r\nreturned to their homes, and twenty-four hours after the flag of revolt\r\nhad been unfurled the Fenian insurrection was at an end.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Irish officers who left America to share in the expected\r\nbattle for Irish rights, a conspicuous place must be assigned Thomas F.\r\nBurke. He was born at Fethard, county Tipperary, on the 10th of\r\nDecember, 1840, and twelve years later sailed away towards the setting\r\nsun, his parents having resolved on seeking a home in the far West. In\r\nNew York, young Burke attended the seminary established by the late\r\nArchbishop Hughes, where he received an excellent education, after which\r\nhe was brought up to his father's trade--that of house painter. For many\r\nyears he worked steadily at his trade, contributing largely to the\r\nsupport of his family. The outbreak of the war, however, acted in the\r\nsame manner on Burke's temperament as on thousands of his\r\nfellow-countrymen. He threw aside his peaceful avocation and joined the\r\nConfederate army. He served under General Patrick Cleburne, who died in\r\nhis arms, and he fought side by side with the son of another\r\ndistinguished exile, John Mitchel. When the war had closed, he returned\r\na Brevet-General, northwards, with a shattered limb and an impaired\r\nconstitution. In June, 1865, he joined the Wolfe Tone Circle of the\r\nFenian Brotherhood in New York, and was appointed soon afterwards to act\r\nas organizer in the Brotherhood for the district of Manhattan. He filled\r\nthis post with great satisfaction to his associates, and continued to\r\nlabour energetically in this capacity until his departure for Ireland,\r\nat the close of 1866.\r\n\r\nTipperary was assigned to Burke as the scene of his revolutionary\r\nlabours in Ireland. He arrived in Clonmel early in February, where he\r\nwas arrested on suspicion, but was immediately discharged--his worn\r\nappearance and physical infirmity giving strong corroboration of his\r\nassertion, that he had come to Ireland for the benefit of his health. On\r\nthe night of the insurrection he placed himself at the head of the\r\nFenian party that assembled in the neighbourhood of Tipperary, but he\r\nquickly saw the folly of attempting a revolution with the scanty band of\r\nunarmed men that rallied round him. On the evening of the 6th his\r\nfollowers were attacked by a detachment of soldiers at Ballyhurst Fort,\r\nabout three miles from Tipperary; Burke saw the uselessness of\r\nresistance, and advised his followers to disperse--an injunction which\r\nthey appear to have obeyed. Burke himself was thrown from his horse and\r\ncaptured. He was conveyed to the jail of Tipperary, and was brought to\r\ntrial in the Greenstreet court-house, in Dublin, on the 24th of April\r\nfollowing. He was convicted of high treason, and sentenced to death in\r\nthe usual form. The following speech delivered by him after conviction\r\nis well worthy of a place in the Irish heart:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords--It is not my intention to occupy much of your time in\r\n   answering the question--what I have to say why sentence should not be\r\n   passed upon me? But I may, with your permission, review a little of\r\n   the evidence that has been brought against me. The first evidence\r\n   that I would speak of is that of Sub-Inspector Kelly, who had a\r\n   conversation with me in Clonmel. He states that he asked me either\r\n   how was my friend, or what about my friend, Mr. Stephens, and\r\n   that I made answer and said, that he was the most idolised man that\r\n   ever had been, or that ever would be in America. Here, standing on\r\n   the brink of my grave, and in the presence of the Almighty and\r\n   ever-living God, I brand that as being the foulest perjury that ever\r\n   man gave utterance to. In any conversation that occurred the name of\r\n   Stephens was not mentioned. I shall pass from that, and then touch on\r\n   the evidence of Brett. He states that I assisted in distributing the\r\n   bread to the parties in the fort, and that I stood with him in the\r\n   waggon or cart. This is also false. I was not in the fort at the\r\n   time; I was not there when the bread was distributed. I came in\r\n   afterwards. Both of these assertions have been made and submitted to\r\n   the men in whose hands my life rested, as evidence made on oath by\r\n   these men--made solely and purely for the purpose of giving my body\r\n   to an untimely grave. There are many points, my lords, that have been\r\n   sworn to here to prove my complicity in a great many acts it has been\r\n   alleged I took part in. It is not my desire now, my lords, to give\r\n   utterance to one word against the verdict which has been pronounced\r\n   upon me. But fully conscious of my honour as a man, which has never\r\n   been impugned, fully conscious that I can go into my grave with a\r\n   name and character unsullied, I can only say that these parties,\r\n   actuated by a desire either of their own aggrandisement, or to save\r\n   their paltry miserable lives, have pandered to the appetite, if I may\r\n   so speak, of justice, and my life shall pay the forfeit. Fully\r\n   convinced and satisfied of the righteousness of my every act in\r\n   connection with the late revolutionary movement in Ireland, I have\r\n   nothing to recall--nothing that I would not do again, nothing for\r\n   which I should feel the blush of shame mantling my brow; my conduct\r\n   and career, both here as a private citizen, and in America--if you\r\n   like--as a soldier, are before you; and even in this, my hour of\r\n   trial, I feel the consciousness of having lived an honest man, and I\r\n   will die proudly, believing that if I have given my life to give\r\n   freedom and liberty to the land of my birth, I have done only that\r\n   which every Irishman and every man whose soul throbs with a feeling\r\n   of liberty should do. I, my lords, shall scarcely--I feel I should\r\n   not at all--mention the name of Massey. I feel I should not pollute\r\n   my lips with the name of that traitor, whose illegitimacy has been\r\n   proved here--a man whose name even is not known, and who, I deny\r\n   point blank, ever wore the star of a colonel in the Confederate army.\r\n   Him I shall let rest. I shall pass him, wishing him, in the words of\r\n   the poet:--\r\n\r\n   \"'May the grass wither from his feet;\r\n   The woods deny him shelter; earth a home;\r\n   The dust a grave; the sun his light:\r\n   And heaven its God!'\r\n\r\n   \"Let Massey remember from this day forth that he carries with him, as\r\n   my able and eloquent counsel (Mr. Dowse) has stated, a serpent that\r\n   will gnaw his conscience, will carry about him in his breast a living\r\n   hell from which he can never be separated. I, my lords, have no\r\n   desire for the name of a martyr; I seek not the death of a martyr;\r\n   but if it is the will of the Almighty and Omnipotent God that my\r\n   devotion for the land of my birth shall be tested on the scaffold, I\r\n   am willing there to die in defence of the right of men to free\r\n   government--the right of an oppressed people to throw off the yoke of\r\n   thraldom. I am an Irishman by birth, an American by adoption; by\r\n   nature a lover of freedom--an enemy to the power that holds my native\r\n   land in the bonds of tyranny. It has so often been admitted that the\r\n   oppressed have a right to throw off the yoke of oppression, even by\r\n   English statesmen, that I do not deem it necessary to advert to the\r\n   fact in a British court of justice. Ireland's children are not, never\r\n   were, and never will be, willing or submissive slaves; and so long as\r\n   England's flag covers one inch of Irish soil, just so long will they\r\n   believe it to be a divine right to conspire, imagine, and devise\r\n   means to hurl it from power, and to erect in its stead the God-like\r\n   structure of self-government. I shall now, my lords, before I go any\r\n   further, perform one important duty to my learned, talented, and\r\n   eloquent counsel. I offer them that which is poor enough, the thanks,\r\n   the sincere and heartfelt thanks of an honest man. I offer them, too,\r\n   in the name of America, the thanks of the Irish people. I know that I\r\n   am here without a relative--without a friend--in fact, 3,000 miles\r\n   away from my family. But I know that I am not forgotten there. The\r\n   great and generous Irish heart of America to-day feels for me--to-day\r\n   sympathises with and does not forget the man who is willing to tread\r\n   the scaffold--aye, defiantly--proudly, conscious of no wrong--in\r\n   defence of American principles--in defence of liberty. To Messrs.\r\n   Butt, Dowse, O'Loghlen, and all the counsel for the prisoners, for\r\n   some of whom I believe Mr. Curran will appear, and my very able\r\n   solicitor, Mr. Lawless, I return individually and collectively, my\r\n   sincere and heartfelt thanks.\r\n\r\n   \"I shall now, my lords, as no doubt you will suggest to me, think of\r\n   the propriety of turning my attention to the world beyond the grave.\r\n   I shall now look only to that home where sorrows are at an end, where\r\n   joy is eternal. I shall hope and pray that freedom may vet dawn on\r\n   this poor down-trodden country. It is my hope, it is my prayer, and\r\n   the last words that I shall utter will be a prayer to God for\r\n   forgiveness, and a prayer for poor old Ireland. Now, my lords; in\r\n   relation to the other man, Corridon, I will make a few remarks.\r\n   Perhaps before I go to Corridon, I should say much has been spoken on\r\n   that table of Colonel Kelly, and of the meetings held at his lodgings\r\n   in London. I desire to state, I never knew where Colonel Kelly's\r\n   lodgings were. I never knew where he lived in London, till I heard\r\n   the informer, Massey, announce it on the table. I never attended a\r\n   meeting at Colonel Kelly's; and the hundred other statements that\r\n   have been made about him. I now solemnly declare on my honour as a\r\n   man--as a dying man--these statements have been totally unfounded and\r\n   false from beginning to end. In relation to the small paper that was\r\n   introduced here, and brought against me as evidence, as having been\r\n   found on my person in connexion with that oath, I desire to say that\r\n   that paper was not found on my person. I knew no person whose name\r\n   was on that paper. O'Beirne, of Dublin, or those other delegates you\r\n   heard of, I never saw or met. That paper has been put in there for\r\n   some purpose. I can swear positively it is not in my handwriting. I\r\n   can also swear I never saw it; yet it is used as evidence against me.\r\n   Is this justice? Is this right? Is this manly? I am willing if I have\r\n   transgressed the laws to suffer the penalty, but I object to this\r\n   system of trumping up a case to take away the life of a human being.\r\n   True, I ask for no mercy. I feel that, with my present emaciated\r\n   frame and somewhat shattered constitution, it is bettor that my life\r\n   should be brought to an end than that I should drag out a miserable\r\n   existence in the prison dens of Portland. Thus it is, my lords, I\r\n   accept the verdict. Of course my acceptance of it is unnecessary, but\r\n   I am satisfied with it. And now I shall close. True it is there are\r\n   many feelings that actuate me at this moment. In fact, these few\r\n   disconnected remarks can give no idea of what I desire to state to\r\n   the court. I have ties to bind me to life and society as strong as\r\n   any man in this court can have. I have a family I love as much as any\r\n   man in this court loves his family. But I can remember the blessing I\r\n   received from an aged mother's lips as I left her the last time. She,\r\n   speaking as the Spartan mother did, said--'Go, my boy, return either\r\n   with your shield or upon it.' This reconciles me--this gives me\r\n   heart. I submit to my doom; and I hope that God will forgive me my\r\n   past sins. I hope also, that inasmuch as He has for seven hundred\r\n   years preserved Ireland, notwithstanding all the tyranny to which she\r\n   has been subjected, as a separate and distinct nationality, He will\r\n   also assist her to retrieve her fallen fortunes--to rise in her\r\n   beauty and majesty, the Sister of Columbia, the peer of any nation in\r\n   the world.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Burke, as our readers are well aware, was not executed. The\r\ngovernment shrank from carrying out the barbarous sentence of the law,\r\nand his punishment was changed to the still more painful, if less\r\nappalling fate, of penal servitude for life. Of General Burke's private\r\ncharacter we have said little; but our readers will be able to\r\nunderstand it from the subjoined brief extracts from two of his letters.\r\nOn the very night previous to his trial he wrote to his mother from\r\nKilmainham Prison:--\r\n\r\n   ... \"On last Easter Sunday I partook of Holy Communion at a late\r\n   mass, I calculated the difference of time between this longitude and\r\n   yours, for I knew that you and my dear sisters were partaking of the\r\n   sacrament at early mass on that day, as was your wont, and I felt\r\n   that our souls were in communion together.\"\r\n\r\nWe conclude with the following letter from General Burke, which has\r\nnever before been published, and which we are sure will be of deep\r\ninterest to our readers. It is addressed to the reverend gentleman who\r\nhad been his father confessor in Clonmel:--\r\n\r\n   \"KILMAINHAM GOAL,\r\n\r\n   \"_4th, Month of Mary._\r\n\r\n   \"DEAR REV. FATHER,\r\n\r\n   \" ... I am perfectly calm and resigned, with my thoughts firmly\r\n   centered with hope in the goodness and mercy of that kind Redeemer,\r\n   whose precious blood was shed for my salvation; as also in the\r\n   mediation and intercession of His Blessed Mother, who is my Star of\r\n   Hope and Consolation. I know, dear father, I need not ask you to be\r\n   remembered in your prayers, for I feel that in your supplication to\r\n   the Throne of Mercy I have not been forgotten.... I have only one\r\n   thought which causes me much sorrow, and that is that my good and\r\n   loving mother will break down under the weight of her affliction,\r\n   and, oh, God, I who loved her more than the life which animates the\r\n   hand that writes to be the cause of it! This thought unmans and\r\n   prostrates me. I wrote to her at the commencement of my trial, and\r\n   told her how I thought it would terminate, and spoke a long and last\r\n   farewell. I have not written since; it would break my heart to\r\n   attempt it; but I would ask you as an especial favour that you would\r\n   write to her and tell her I am happy and reconciled to the will of\r\n   God who has given me this opportunity of saving my immortal soul. I\r\n   hope to hear from you before I leave this world.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Good-bye, father, and that God may bless you in your ministry is the\r\n   prayer of an obedient child of the church.\"\r\n\r\n   \"THOMAS F. BURKE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JOHN M'AFFERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not Irish-born men alone whose souls are filled with a chivalrous\r\nlove for Ireland, and a stern hatred of her oppressor. There are amongst\r\nthe ranks of her patriots none more generous, more resolute, or more\r\nactive in her cause than the children born of Irish parents in various\r\nparts of the world. In London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham,\r\nGlasgow, and all the large towns of Great Britain, throughout the United\r\nStates, and in the British colonies, many of the best known and most\r\nthorough-going \"Irishmen\" are men whose place of birth was not beneath\r\nthe Irish skies, and amongst them are some who never saw the shores of\r\nthe Green Isle. One of these men was Captain John M'Afferty. He was born\r\nof Irish parents in the State of Ohio, in the year 1838, and at their\r\nknees he heard of the rights and wrongs of Ireland, learned to\r\nsympathise with the sufferings of that country, and to regard the\r\nachievement of its freedom as a task in which he was bound to bear a\r\npart. He grew up to be a man of adventurous and daring habits, better\r\nfitted for the camp than for the ordinary ways of peaceful life; and\r\nwhen the civil war broke out he soon found his place in one of those\r\nregiments of the Confederacy whose special duty lay in the\r\naccomplishment of the most hazardous enterprises. He belonged to the\r\ncelebrated troop of Morgan's guerillas, whose dashing feats of valour so\r\noften filled the Federal forces with astonishment and alarm. In the\r\nlatter part of 1865 he crossed over to this country to assist in leading\r\nthe insurrection which was then being prepared by the Fenian\r\norganization. He was arrested, as already stated in these pages, on\r\nboard the steamer at Queenstown before he had set foot on Irish soil;\r\nwhen brought to trial at Cork, in the month of December, the lawyers\r\ndiscovered that being an alien, and having committed no overt act of\r\ntreason within the Queen's dominions, there was no case against him, and\r\nhe was consequently discharged. He then went back to America, took an\r\nactive part in some Fenian meetings, made a speech at one of them which\r\nwas held at Jones's Wood, and when the report of the proceedings\r\nappeared in print, he, with a sense of grim humour, posted a copy\r\ncontaining his oration to the governor of Mountjoy Prison, Dublin. In\r\nthe latter part of 1866, when James Stephens was promising to bring off\r\nimmediately the long-threatened insurrection, M'Afferty again crossed\r\nthe ocean, and landed in England. There he was mainly instrumental in\r\nplanning and organizing that extraordinary movement, the raid on\r\nChester, which took place on Monday, 11th of February, 1867. It is now\r\nconfessed, even by the British authorities themselves, that but for the\r\ntimely intimation of the design given by the informer Corridon,\r\nM'Afferty and his party would probably have succeeded in capturing the\r\nold Castle, and seizing the large store of arms therein contained.\r\nFinding their movements anticipated, the Fenian party left Chester as\r\nquietly as they had come, and the next that was heard of M'Afferty was\r\nhis arrest, and that of his friend and companion John Flood, on the 23rd\r\nof February, in the harbour of Dublin, after they had got into a small\r\nboat from out of the collier \"New Draper,\" which had just arrived from\r\nWhitehaven. M'Afferty was placed in the dock of Green-street\r\ncourt-house for trial on Wednesday, May 1st, while the jury were absent\r\nconsidering their verdict in the case of Burke and Doran. On Monday, May\r\nthe 6th, he was declared guilty by the jury. On that day week a Court of\r\nAppeal, consisting of ten of the Irish judges, sat to consider some\r\nlegal points raised by Mr. Butt in the course of the trial, the most\r\nimportant of which was the question whether the prisoner, who had been\r\nin custody since February 23rd, could be held legally responsible for\r\nthe events of the Fenian rising which occurred on the night of the 5th\r\nof March. Their lordships gave an almost unanimous judgment against the\r\nprisoner on Saturday, May 18th, and on the Monday following he was\r\nbrought up for sentence, on which occasion, in response to the usual\r\nquestion, he spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords--I have nothing to say that can, at this advanced stage of\r\n   the trial, ward off that sentence of death, for I might as well hurl\r\n   my complaint (if I had one) at the orange trees of the sunny south,\r\n   or the tall pine trees of the bleak north, as now to speak to the\r\n   question why sentence of death should not be passed upon me according\r\n   to the law of the land; but I do protest loudly against the injustice\r\n   of that sentence. I have been brought to trial upon a charge of high\r\n   treason against the government of Great Britain, and guilt has been\r\n   brought home to me upon the evidence of one witness, and that witness\r\n   a perjured informer. I deny distinctly that there have been two\r\n   witnesses to prove the overt act of treason against me. I deny\r\n   distinctly that you have brought two independent witnesses to two\r\n   overt acts. There is but one witness to prove the overt act of\r\n   treason against me. I grant that there has been a cloud of\r\n   circumstantial evidence to show my connection (if I may please to use\r\n   that word) with the Irish people in their attempt for Irish\r\n   independence, and I claim that as an American and as an alien, I have\r\n   a reason and a right to sympathise with the Irish people or any other\r\n   people who may please to revolt against that form of government by\r\n   which they believe they are governed tyrannically. England\r\n   sympathised with America. She not only sympathised, but she gave her\r\n   support to both parties; but who ever heard of an Englishman having\r\n   been arrested by the United States government for having given his\r\n   support to the Confederate States of America and placed on his trial\r\n   for high treason against the government? No such case ever has been.\r\n   I do not deny that I have sympathised with the Irish people--I love\r\n   Ireland--I love the Irish people. And, if I were free to-morrow, and\r\n   the Irish people were to take the field for independence, my sympathy\r\n   would be with them; I would join them if they had any prospect\r\n   whatever of independence, but I would not give my sanction to the\r\n   useless effusion of blood, however done; and I state distinctly that\r\n   I had nothing whatever to do, directly or indirectly, with the\r\n   movement that took place in the county of Dublin. I make that\r\n   statement on the brink of my grave. Again, I claim that I have a\r\n   right to be discharged of the charge against me by the language of\r\n   the law by which I have been tried. That law states that you must\r\n   have two independent witnesses to prove the overt act against the\r\n   prisoner. That is the only complaint I have to make, and I make that\r\n   aloud. I find no fault with the jury, no complaint against the\r\n   judges. I have been tried and found guilty. I am perfectly satisfied\r\n   that I will go to my grave. I will go to my grave like a gentleman\r\n   and a Christian, although I regret that I should be cut off at this\r\n   stage of my life--still many an noble Irishman fell in defence of the\r\n   rights of my southern clime. I do not wish to make any flowery speech\r\n   to win sympathy in the court of justice. Without any further remarks\r\n   I will now accept the sentence of the court.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Fitzgerald then in the \"solemn tone of voice\" adopted on\r\nsuch occasions proceeded to pass sentence in the usual form, fixing the\r\n12th day of June as the date on which the execution should take place.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner heard the sentence without giving the slightest symptoms of\r\nemotion, and then spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"I will accept my sentence as becomes a gentleman and a Christian. I\r\n   have but one request to ask of the tribunal, and that is that after\r\n   the execution of the sentence my remains shall be turned over to Mr.\r\n   Lawless to be by him interred in consecrated ground as quietly as he\r\n   possibly can. I have now, previous to leaving the dock, once more to\r\n   return my grateful and sincere thanks to Mr. Butt, the star of the\r\n   Irish bar, for his able and devoted defence on behalf of me and my\r\n   friends. Mr. Butt, I thank you. I also return the same token of\r\n   esteem to Mr. Dowse, for the kind and feeling manner in which he\r\n   alluded to the scenes in my former life. Those kind allusions recall\r\n   to my mind many moments--some bright, beautiful, and glorious--and\r\n   yet some sad recollections arise of generous hopes that floated o'er\r\n   me, and now sink beyond the grave. Mr. Butt, please convey to Mr.\r\n   Dowse my grateful and sincere thanks. Mr. Lawless, I also return you\r\n   my thanks for your many acts of kindness--I can do no more.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not executed however. The commutation of Burke's sentence\r\nnecessitated the like course in all the other capital cases, and\r\nM'Afferty's doom was changed to penal servitude for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD DUFFY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day following that on which M'Afferty's sentence was pronounced,\r\nthe trial of three men, named John Flood, Edward Duffy, and John Cody\r\nwas brought to a conclusion. When they were asked what they had to say\r\nwhy sentence should not be passed on them, Cody denied with all possible\r\nearnestness the charge of being president of an assassination committee,\r\nwhich had been brought against him. Flood--a young man of remarkably\r\nhandsome exterior--declared that the evidence adduced against himself\r\nwas untrue in many particulars. He alluded to the Attorney-General's\r\nhaving spoken of him as \"that wretched man, Flood.\" \"My lords,\" said he,\r\n\"if to love my country more than my life makes me a wretched man, then I\r\nam a very wretched man indeed.\" Edward Duffy, it might be supposed by\r\nanyone looking at his emaciated frame, wasted by consumption, and with\r\nthe seal of death plainly set on his brow, would not be able to offer\r\nany remarks to the court; but he roused himself to the effort. The\r\nnoble-hearted young fellow had been previously in the clutches of the\r\ngovernment for the same offence. He was arrested with James Stephens and\r\nothers at Fairfield House, in November, 1865, but after a brief\r\nimprisonment was released in consideration of the state of his health,\r\nwhich seemed such as would not leave him many days to live. But, few or\r\nmany, Duffy could not do otherwise than devote them to the cause he had\r\nat heart. He was re-arrested at Boyle on the 11th of March, and this\r\ntime the government took care they would not quit their hold of him. The\r\nfollowing is the speech which, by a great physical effort, he delivered\r\nfrom the dock, his dark eyes brightening, and his pallid features\r\nlighting up with the glow of an earnest and lofty enthusiasm while he\r\nspoke:--\r\n\r\n   \"The Attorney-General has made a wanton attack on me, but I leave my\r\n   countrymen to judge between us. There is no political act of mine\r\n   that I in the least regret. I have laboured earnestly and sincerely\r\n   in my country's cause, and I have been actuated throughout by a\r\n   strong sense of duty. I believe that a man's duty to his country is\r\n   part of his duty to God, for it is He who implants the feeling of\r\n   patriotism in the human breast. He, the great searcher of hearts,\r\n   knows that I have been actuated by no mean or paltry ambition--that I\r\n   have never worked for any selfish end. For the late outbreak I am not\r\n   responsible; I did all in my power to prevent it, for I knew that,\r\n   circumstanced as we then were, it would be a failure. It has been\r\n   stated in the course of those trials that Stephens was for peace.\r\n   This is a mistake. It may be well that it should not go\r\n   uncontradicted. It is but too well known in Ireland that he sent\r\n   numbers of men over here to fight, promising to be with them when the\r\n   time would come. The time did come, but not Mr. Stephens. He remained\r\n   in France to visit the Paris Exhibition. It may be a very pleasant\r\n   sight, but I would not be in his place now. He is a lost man--lost to\r\n   honour, lost to country. There are a few things I would wish to say\r\n   relative to the evidence given against me at my trial, but I would\r\n   ask your lordships to give me permission to say them after sentence.\r\n   I have a reason for asking to be allowed to say them after sentence\r\n   has been passed.\"\r\n\r\n   The Chief Justice--\"That is not the usual practice. Not being tried\r\n   for life, it is doubtful to me whether you have a right to speak at\r\n   all. What you are asked to say is why sentence should not be passed\r\n   upon you, and whatever you have to say you must say now.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Then, if I must say it now I declare it before my God that what\r\n   Kelly swore against me on the table is not true. I saw him in\r\n   Ennisgroven, but that I ever spoke to him on any political subject I\r\n   declare to heaven I never did. I knew him from a child in that little\r\n   town, herding with the lowest and vilest. Is it to be supposed I'd\r\n   put my liberty into the hands of such a character? I never did it.\r\n   The next witness is Corridon. He swore that at the meeting he\r\n   referred to I gave him directions to go to Kerry to find O'Connor,\r\n   and put himself in communication with him. I declare to my God every\r\n   word of that is false. Whether O'Connor was in the country or whether\r\n   he had made his escape, I know just as little as your lordships; and\r\n   I never heard of the Kerry rising until I saw it in the public\r\n   papers. As to my giving the American officers money that night,\r\n   before my God, on the verge of my grave, where my sentence will send\r\n   me, I say that also is false. As to the writing that the policeman\r\n   swore to in that book, and which is not a prayer-book, but the\r\n   'Imitation of Christ,' given to me by a lady to whom I served my\r\n   time, what was written in that book was written by another young man\r\n   in her employment. That is his writing not mine. It is the writing\r\n   of a young man in the house, and I never wrote a line of it.\"\r\n\r\n   The Lord Chief Justice--\"It was not sworn to be in your handwriting.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Yes, my lord, it was. The policeman swore it was in my\r\n   hand-writing.\"\r\n\r\n   The Lord Chief Justice--\"That is a mistake. It was said to be like\r\n   yours.\"\r\n\r\n   \"The dream of my life has been that I might be fighting for Ireland.\r\n   The jury have doomed me to a more painful, but not less glorious\r\n   death. I now bid farewell to my friends and all who are dear to me.\r\n\r\n   \"'There is a world where souls are free,\r\n     Where tyrants taint not nature's bliss;\r\n   If death that bright world's opening be,\r\n     Oh, who would live a slave in this.'\r\n\r\n   \"I am proud to be thought worthy of suffering for my country; when I\r\n   am lying in my lonely cell I will not forget Ireland, and my last\r\n   prayer will be that the God of liberty may give her strength to shake\r\n   off her chains.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Flood and Edward Duffy were then sentenced each to fifteen years of\r\npenal servitude, and Cody to penal servitude for life.\r\n\r\nEdward Duffy's term of suffering did not last long. A merciful\r\nProvidence gave his noble spirit release from its earthly tenement\r\nbefore one year from the date of his sentence had passed away. On the\r\n21st of May, 1867, his trial concluded; on the 17th of January, 1868,\r\nthe patriot lay dead in his cell in Millbank Prison, London. The\r\ngovernment permitted his friends to remove his remains to Ireland for\r\ninterment; and they now rest in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin, where\r\nfriendly hands oft renew the flowers on his grave, and many a heartfelt\r\nprayer is uttered that God would give the patriot's soul eternal rest,\r\nand \"let perpetual light shine unto him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN JOSEPH MEANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe connexion of Stephen Joseph Meany with Irish politics dates back to\r\n1848, when he underwent an imprisonment of some months in Carrickfergus\r\nCastle, under the provisions of the _Habeas Corpus_ Suspension Act. He\r\nhad been a writer on one of the national newspapers of that period, and\r\nwas previously a reporter for a Dublin daily paper. He joined the Fenian\r\nmovement in America, and was one of the \"Senators\" in O'Mahony's\r\norganization. In December, 1866, he crossed over to England, and in the\r\nfollowing month he was arrested in London, and was brought in custody\r\nacross to Ireland. His trial took place in Dublin on the 16th of\r\nFebruary, 1867, when the legality of the mode of his arrest was denied\r\nby his counsel, and as it was a very doubtful question, the point was\r\nreserved to be considered by a Court of Appeal. This tribunal sat on May\r\nthe 13th, 1867, and on May the 18th, their decision confirming the\r\nconviction was pronounced. It was not until the 21st of the following\r\nmonth, at the Commission of Oyer and Terminer that he was brought up for\r\nsentence. He then delivered the following able address to show \"why\r\nsentence should not be passed on him\":--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords--There are many reasons I could offer why sentence should\r\n   not--could not--be pronounced upon me according to law, if seven\r\n   months of absolute solitary imprisonment, and the almost total disuse\r\n   of speech during that period, had left me energy enough, or even\r\n   language sufficient to address the court. But yielding obedience to a\r\n   suggestion coming from a quarter which I am bound to respect, as well\r\n   indeed as in accordance with my own feelings, I avoid everything like\r\n   speech-making for outside effect. Besides, the learned counsel who so\r\n   ably represented me in the Court of Appeal, and the eminent judges\r\n   who in that court gave judgment for me, have exhausted all that could\r\n   be said on the law of the case. Of their arguments and opinions your\r\n   lordships have judicial knowledge. I need not say that both in\r\n   interest as in conviction I am in agreement with the constitutional\r\n   principles laid down by the minority of the judges in that court, and\r\n   I have sufficient respect for the dignity of the court--sufficient\r\n   regard to what is due to myself--to concede fully and frankly to the\r\n   majority a conscientious view of a novel and, it may be, a difficult\r\n   question.\r\n\r\n   \"But I do not ask too much in asking that before your lordships\r\n   proceed to pass any sentence you will consider the manner in which\r\n   the court was divided on that question--to bear in mind that the\r\n   minority declaring against the legality and the validity of the\r\n   conviction was composed of some of the ablest and most experienced\r\n   judges of the Irish bench or any bench--to bear in mind that one of\r\n   these learned judges who had presided at the Commission Court was one\r\n   of the most emphatic in the Court of Criminal Appeal in declaring\r\n   against my liability to be tried; and moreover--and he ought to\r\n   know--that there was not a particle of evidence to sustain the cause\r\n   set up at the last moment, and relied upon by the crown, that I was\r\n   an 'accessory before the fact' to that famous Dublin overt act, for\r\n   which, as an afterthought of the crown, I was in fact tried. And I\r\n   ask you further to bear in mind that the affirmance of the conviction\r\n   was not had on fixed principles of law--for the question was\r\n   unprecedented--but on a speculative view of a suppositious case, and\r\n   I must say a strained application of an already over-strained and\r\n   dangerous doctrine--the doctrine of constructive criminality--the\r\n   doctrine of making a man at a distance of three thousand miles or\r\n   more, legally responsible for the words and acts of others whom he\r\n   had never seen, and of whom he had never heard, under the fiction, or\r\n   the 'supposition,' that he was a co-conspirator. The word\r\n   'supposition' is not mine, my lords; it is the word put forward\r\n   descriptive of the point by the learned judges presiding at my trial;\r\n   for I find in the case prepared by these judges for the Court of\r\n   Criminal Appeal the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n   \"'Sufficient evidence was given on the part of the crown of acts of\r\n   members of the said association in Ireland not named in the\r\n   indictment in promotion of the several objects aforesaid, and done\r\n   within the county of the city of Dublin, to sustain some of the overt\r\n   acts charged in the indictment supposing them to be the acts of the\r\n   defendant himself.'\r\n\r\n   \"Fortified by such facts--with a court so divided, and with opinions\r\n   so expressed--I submit that, neither according to act of parliament,\r\n   nor in conformity with the practice at common law, nor in any way in\r\n   pursuance of the principles of that apocryphal abstraction, that\r\n   magnificent myth--the British constitution--am I amenable to the\r\n   sentence of this court--or any court in this country. True, I am in\r\n   the toils, and it may be vain to discuss how I was brought into them.\r\n   True, my long and dreary imprisonment--shut away from all converse or\r\n   association with humanity, in a cell twelve feet by six--the\r\n   humiliations of prison discipline--the hardships of prison fare--the\r\n   handcuffs, and the heartburnings--this court and its surroundings of\r\n   power and authority--all these are 'hard practical facts,' which no\r\n   amount of indignant protests can negative--no denunciation of the\r\n   wrong refine away; and it may be, as I have said, worse than\r\n   useless--vain and absurd--to question the right where might is\r\n   predominant. But the invitation just extended to me by the officer of\r\n   the court means, if it means anything--if it be not like the rest, a\r\n   solemn mockery--that there still is left to me the poor privilege of\r\n   complaint. And I do complain. I complain that law and justice have\r\n   been alike violated in my regard--I complain that the much belauded\r\n   attribute 'British fair play' has been for me a nullity--I complain\r\n   that the pleasant fiction described in the books as 'personal\r\n   freedom' has had a most unpleasant illustration in my person--and I\r\n   furthermore and particularly complain that by the design and\r\n   contrivance of what are called 'the authorities,' I have been brought\r\n   to this country, not for trial but for condemnation--not for justice\r\n   but for judgment.\r\n\r\n   \"I will not tire the patience of the court, or exhaust my own\r\n   strength, by going over the history of this painful case--the\r\n   kidnapping in London on the mere belief of a police-constable that I\r\n   was a Fenian in New York--the illegal transportation to Ireland--the\r\n   committal for trial on a specific charge, whilst a special messenger\r\n   was despatched to New York to hunt up informers to justify the\r\n   illegality and the outrage, and to get a foundation for any charge. I\r\n   will not dwell on the 'conspicuous absence' of fair play, in the\r\n   crown at the trial having closed their cases without any reference to\r\n   the Dublin transaction, but, as an afterthought, suggested by their\r\n   discovered failure, giving in evidence the facts and circumstances of\r\n   that case, and thus succeeding in making the jury convict me for an\r\n   offence with which up to that moment the crown did not intend to\r\n   charge me. I will not say what I think of the mockery of putting me\r\n   on trial in the Commission Court in Dublin for alleged words and acts\r\n   in New York, and though the evidence was without notice, and the\r\n   alleged overt acts without date, taunting me with not proving an\r\n   _alibi_, and sending that important ingredient to a jury already ripe\r\n   for a conviction. Prove an _alibi_ to-day in respect of meetings held\r\n   in Clinton Hall, New York, the allegations relating to which only\r\n   came to my knowledge yesterday! I will not refer with any bitter\r\n   feeling to the fact that whilst the validity of the conviction so\r\n   obtained was still pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Right\r\n   Hon. and Noble the Chief Secretary for Ireland declared in the House\r\n   of Commons that 'that conviction was the most important one at the\r\n   Commission'--thus prejudicing my case, I will not say willingly; but\r\n   the observation was, at least, inopportune, and for me unfortunate.\r\n\r\n   \"I will not speak my feeling on the fact that in the arguments in the\r\n   case in the Court for Reserved Cases, the Right Hon. the\r\n   Attorney-General appealed to the passions--if such can exist in\r\n   judges--and not to the judgment of the court, for I gather from the\r\n   judgment of Mr. Justice O'Hagan, that the right hon. gentleman made\r\n   an earnest appeal 'that such crimes' as mine 'should not be allowed\r\n   to go unpunished'.--forgetful, I will not say designedly forgetful,\r\n   that he was addressing the judges of the land, in the highest court\r\n   of the land, on matters of law, and not speaking to a pliant Dublin\r\n   jury on a treason trial in the court-house of Green-street.\r\n\r\n   \"Before I proceed further, my lords, there is a matter which, as\r\n   simply personal to myself I should not mind, but which as involving\r\n   high interests to the community, and serious consequences to\r\n   individuals, demand a special notice. I allude to the system of\r\n   manufacturing informers. I want to know, if the court can inform me,\r\n   by what right a responsible officer of the crown entered my solitary\r\n   cell at Kilmainham prison on Monday last--unbidden and\r\n   unexpected--uninvited and undesired. I want to know what\r\n   justification there was for his coming to insult me in my solitude\r\n   and in my sorrow--ostensibly informing me that I was to be brought up\r\n   for sentence on Thursday, but in the same breath adroitly putting to\r\n   me the question if I knew any of the men recently arrested near\r\n   Dungarvan, and now in the prison of Kilmainham. Coming thus, with a\r\n   detective dexterity, carrying in one hand a threat of sentence and\r\n   punishment--in the other as a counterpoise and, I suppose an\r\n   alternative, a temptation to treachery. Did he suppose that seven\r\n   months of imprisonment had so broken my spirit, as well as my health,\r\n   that I would be an easy prey to his blandishments? Did he dream that\r\n   the prospect of liberty which newspaper rumour and semi-official\r\n   information held out to me was too dear to be forfeited for a\r\n   trilling forfeiture of honour? Did he believe that by an act of\r\n   secret turpitude I would open my prison doors only to close them the\r\n   faster on others who may or may not have been my friends--or did he\r\n   imagine he had found in me a Massey to be moulded and manipulated\r\n   into the service of the crown, or a Corridon to have cowardice and\r\n   cupidity made the incentives to his baseness. I only wonder how the\r\n   interview ended as it did; but I knew I was a prisoner, and\r\n   self-respect preserved my patience and secured his safety. Great, my\r\n   lords, as have been my humiliation in prison, hard and heart-breaking\r\n   as have been the ordeals through which I have passed since the 1st of\r\n   December last, there was no incident or event of that period fraught\r\n   with more pain on the one hand, or more suggestiveness on the other,\r\n   than this sly and secret attempt at improvising an informer. I can\r\n   forget the pain in view of the suggestiveness; and unpleasant as is\r\n   my position here to-day, I am almost glad of the opportunity which\r\n   may end in putting some check to the spy system in prisons. How many\r\n   men have been won from honour and honesty by the stealthy visit to\r\n   the cell is more of course than I can say--how many have had their\r\n   weakness acted upon, or their wickness fanned into flame by which\r\n   means I have no opportunity of knowing--in how many frailty and folly\r\n   may have blossomed into falsehood it is for those concerned to\r\n   estimate. There is one thing, however, certain--operating in this way\r\n   is more degrading to the tempter than to the tempted; and the\r\n   government owes it to itself to put an end to a course of tactics\r\n   pursued in its name, which in the results can only bring its\r\n   humiliation--the public are bound in self-protection to protect the\r\n   prisoner from the prowling visits of a too zealous official.\r\n\r\n   \"I pass over all these things, my lords, and I ask your attention to\r\n   the character of the evidence on which alone my conviction was\r\n   obtained. The evidence of a special, subsidized spy, and of an\r\n   infamous and ingrate informer.\r\n\r\n   \"In all ages, and amongst all peoples, the spy has been held in\r\n   marked abhorrence. In the amnesties of war there is for him alone no\r\n   quarter; in the estimate of social life no toleration; his\r\n   self-abasement excites contempt, not compassion; his patrons despise\r\n   while they encourage; and they who stoop to enlist the services\r\n   shrink with disgust from the moral leprosy covering the servitor. Of\r\n   such was the witness put forward to corroborate the informer, and\r\n   still not corroborating him. Of such was that phenomenon, a police\r\n   spy, who declared himself an unwilling witness for the crown! There\r\n   was no reason why in my regard he should be unwilling--he knew me not\r\n   previously. I have no desire to speak harshly of Inspector Doyle; he\r\n   said in presence of the Crown Solicitor, and was not contradicted,\r\n   that he was compelled by threats to ascend the witness table; he may\r\n   have had cogent reasons for his reluctance in his own conscience. God\r\n   will judge him.\r\n\r\n   \"But how shall I speak of the informer, Mr. John Devany? What\r\n   language should be employed in describing the character of one who\r\n   adds to the guilt of perfidy to his associates the crime of perjury\r\n   to his God?--the man who eating of your bread, sharing your\r\n   confidence, and holding, as it were, your very purse-strings, all the\r\n   time meditates your overthrow and pursues it to its accomplishment?\r\n   How paint the wretch who, under pretence of agreement in your\r\n   opinions, worms himself into your secrets only to betray them; and\r\n   who, upon the same altar with you, pledges his faith and fealty to\r\n   the same principles, and then sells faith, and fealty, and\r\n   principles, and you alike, for the unhallowed Judas guerdon? Of such,\r\n   on his own confession was that distinguished upholder of the British\r\n   crown and government, Mr. Devany. With an affrontery that did not\r\n   falter, and knew not how to blush, he detailed his own participation\r\n   in the acts for which he was prosecuting me as a participator. And is\r\n   the evidence of a man like that--a conviction obtained upon such\r\n   evidence--any warrant for a sentence depriving me of all that make\r\n   life desirable or enjoyable?\r\n\r\n   \"He was first spy for the crown--in the pay of the crown, under the\r\n   control of the crown, and think you he had any other object than to\r\n   do the behests of the crown?\r\n\r\n   \"He was next the traitor spy, who had taken that one fatal step, from\r\n   which in this life there is no retrogression--that one plunge in\r\n   infamy from which there is no receding--that one treachery for which\r\n   there is no earthly forgiveness; and, think you, he hesitated about a\r\n   prejury more or less to secure present pay and future patronage? Here\r\n   was one to whom existence offers now no prospect save in making his\r\n   perfidy a profession, and think you he was deterred by conscience\r\n   from recommending himself to his patrons? Think you that when at a\r\n   distance of three thousand miles from the scenes he professed to\r\n   describe, he could lie with impunity and invent without detection, he\r\n   was particular to a shade in doing his part of a most filthy bargain?\r\n   It is needless to describe a wretch of that kind--his own actions\r\n   speak his character. It were superfluous to curse him, his whole\r\n   existence will be a living, a continuing curse. No necessity to use\r\n   the burning words of the poet and say:--\r\n\r\n   \"'May life's unblessed cup for him\r\n   Be drugged with treacheries to the brim.'\r\n\r\n   \"Every sentiment in his regard of the country he has dishonoured, and\r\n   the people he has humbled, will be one of horror and hate. Every sigh\r\n   sent up from the hearts he has crushed and the homes he has made\r\n   desolate, will be mingled with execrations on the name of the\r\n   informer. Every heart-throb in the prison cells of this land where\r\n   his victims count time by corroding his thought--every grief that\r\n   finds utterance from these victims in the quarries of Portland will\r\n   go up to heaven freighted with curses on the Nagles, the Devanys, the\r\n   Masseys, the Gillespies, the Corridons, and the whole host of\r\n   mercenary miscreants, who, faithless to their friends and recreant to\r\n   their professions, have, paraphrasing the words of Moore, taken their\r\n   perfidy to heaven seeking to make accomplice of their God--wretches\r\n   who have embalmed their memories in imperishable infamy, and given\r\n   their accursed names to an inglorious immortality. Nor will I\r\n   speculate on their career in the future. We have it on the best\r\n   existing authority that a distinguished informer of antiquity seized\r\n   with remorse, threw away his blood-money, 'went forth and hanged\r\n   himself.' We know that in times within the memory of living men a\r\n   government actually set the edifying and praiseworthy example of\r\n   hanging an informer when they had no further use of his valuable\r\n   services--thus _dropping_ his acquaintance with effect. I have no\r\n   wish for such a fate to any of the informers who have cropped out so\r\n   luxuriantly in these latter days--a long life and a troubled\r\n   conscience would, perhaps, be their correct punishment--though\r\n   certainly there would be a consistent compensation--a poetic\r\n   justice--in a termination so exalted to a career so brilliant.\r\n\r\n   \"I leave these fellows and turn for a moment to their victims. And, I\r\n   would here, without any reference to my own case, earnestly implore\r\n   that sympathy with political sufferers should not be merely\r\n   telescopic in its character, 'distance lending enchantment to the\r\n   view;' and that when your statesmen sentimentalize upon, and your\r\n   journalists denounce far-away tyrannies--the horrors of Neapolitan\r\n   dungeons--the abridgement of personal freedom in Continental\r\n   countries--the exercise of arbitrary power by irresponsible authority\r\n   in other lands--they would turn their eyes homeward, and examine the\r\n   treatment and the sufferings of their own political prisoners. I\r\n   would, in all sincerity, suggest that humane and well-meaning men,\r\n   who exert themselves for the remission of the death-penalty as a\r\n   mercy, would rather implore that the doors of solitary and silent\r\n   captivity should be remitted to the more merciful doom of an\r\n   immediate relief from suffering by immediate execution--the\r\n   opportunity of an immediate appeal from man's cruelty to God's\r\n   justice. I speak strongly on this point because I feel it deeply. I\r\n   speak not without example. At the Commission at which I was tried\r\n   there was tried also and sentenced a young man named Stowell. I well\r\n   remember that raw and dreary morning, the 12th March, when handcuffed\r\n   to Stowell I was sent from Kilmainham Prison to the County Gaol of\r\n   Kildare. I well remember our traversing, so handcuffed, from the town\r\n   of Sailing to the town of Naas, ancle deep in snow and mud, and I\r\n   recall now with pain our sad foreboding of that morning. These in\r\n   part have been fulfilled. Sunday after Sunday I saw poor Stowell at\r\n   chapel in Naas Gaol drooping and dying. One such Sunday--the 12th\r\n   May--passed and I saw him no more. On Wednesday, the 15th, he was, as\r\n   they say, _mercifully_ released from prison, but the fiat of mercy\r\n   had previously gone forth from a higher power--the political convict\r\n   simply reached his own home to die, with loving eyes watching by his\r\n   death-bed. On Sunday, the 19th May, he was consigned to another\r\n   prison home in Glasnevin Cemetery. May God have mercy on his\r\n   soul--may God forgive his persecutors--may God give peace and\r\n   patience to those who are doomed to follow.\r\n\r\n   \"Pardon this digression, my lords, I could not avoid it. Returning to\r\n   the question, why sentence should not be pronounced upon me, I would\r\n   ask your lordships' attention to the fact showing, even in the\r\n   estimate of the crown, the case is not one for sentence.\r\n\r\n   \"On the morning of my trial, and before the trial, terms were offered\r\n   to me by the crown. The direct proposition was made through my\r\n   solicitor, through the learned counsel who so ably defended me,\r\n   through the Governor of Kilmainham Prison--by all three--that if I\r\n   pleaded guilty to the indictment, I should get off with six months'\r\n   imprisonment. Knowing the pliancy of Dublin juries in political\r\n   cases, the offer was, doubtless, a tempting one. Valuing liberty, it\r\n   was almost resistless--in view of a possible penal servitude--but\r\n   having regard to principle, I spurned the compromise. I then gave\r\n   unhesitatingly, as I would now give, the answer, that not for a\r\n   reduction of the punishment to six hours would I surrender\r\n   faith--that I need never look, and could never look, wife or\r\n   children, friends or family, in the face if capable of such a selfish\r\n   cowardice. I could not to save myself imperil the safety of others--I\r\n   could not plead guilty to an indictment in which six others were\r\n   distinctly charged by name as co-conspirators with me--one of those\r\n   six since tried, convicted, and sentenced to death--I could not\r\n   consent to obtain my own pardon at their expense--furnish the crown\r\n   with a case in point for future convictions, and become, even though\r\n   indirectly, worthy to rank with that brazen battalion of venal\r\n   vagabonds, who have made the Holy Gospel of God the medium of barter\r\n   for their unholy gain, and obtained access to the inmost heart of\r\n   their selected victim only to coin its throbbing into the traitor's\r\n   gold and traffic on its very life-blood.\r\n\r\n   \"Had I been charged simply with my own words and deeds I would have\r\n   no hesitation in making acknowledgement. I have nothing to repent\r\n   and nothing to conceal--nothing to retract and nothing to\r\n   countermand; but in the language of the learned Lord Chief Baron in\r\n   this case, I could not admit 'the preposterous idea of thinking by\r\n   deputy' any more than I could plead guilty to an indictment which\r\n   charge others with crime. Further, my lords, I could not acknowledge\r\n   culpability for the acts and words of others at a distance of three\r\n   thousand miles--others whom I had never seen, of whom I had never\r\n   heard, and with whom I never had had communication. I could not admit\r\n   that the demoniac atrocities, described as Fenian principles by the\r\n   constabulary-spy Talbot, ever had my sanction or approval or the\r\n   sanction or approval of any man in America.\r\n\r\n   \"If, my lords, six months' imprisonment was the admeasurement of the\r\n   law officers of the crown as an adequate punishment for my alleged\r\n   offence--assuming that the court had jurisdiction to try and\r\n   punish--then, am I now entitled to my discharge independent of all\r\n   other grounds of discharge, for I have gone through seven months of\r\n   an imprisonment which could not be excelled by demon ingenuity in\r\n   horror and in hardship--in solitude, in silence and in suspense. Your\r\n   lordships will not only render further litigation necessary by\r\n   passing sentence for the perhaps high crime--but still the untried\r\n   crime--of refusing to yield obedience to the crown's proposition for\r\n   my self-abasement. You will not, I am sure, visit upon my rejection\r\n   of Mr. Anderson's delicate overture--you will not surely permit the\r\n   events occurring, unhappily occurring, since my trial to influence\r\n   your judgments. And do not, I implore you, accept as a truth,\r\n   influencing that judgement, Talbot's definition of the objects of\r\n   Feminism. Hear what Devany, the American informer, describes them to\r\n   be. 'The members,' he says, 'were _pledged by word of honour_ to\r\n   promote love and harmony amongst all classes of Irishmen and to\r\n   labour for the independence of Ireland.' Talbot says that in Ireland\r\n   'the members are _bound by oath_ to seize the property of the\r\n   country and murder all opposed to them.' Can any two principles be\r\n   more distinct from each other? Could there be a conspiracy for a\r\n   common object by such antagonistic means? To murder all opposed to\r\n   your principles may be an effectual way of producing unanimity, but\r\n   the quality of love and harmony engendered by such a patent process,\r\n   would be extremely equivocal. Mr. Talbot, for the purposes of his\r\n   evidence, must have borrowed a leaf from the History of the French\r\n   Revolution, and adopted as singularly telling and appropriate for\r\n   effect the saying attributed to Robespiere: 'Let us cut everybody's\r\n   throat but our own, and then we are sure to be masters.'\r\n\r\n   \"No one in America, I venture to affirm, ever heard of such designs\r\n   in connexion with the Fenian Brotherhood. No one in America would\r\n   countenance such designs. Revolutionists are not ruffians or\r\n   rapparees. A judge from the bench at Cork, and a noble lord in his\r\n   place in parliament, bore testimony to that fact, in reference to the\r\n   late movement; and I ask you, my lords--I would ask the country from\r\n   this court--for the sake of the character of your countrymen--to\r\n   believe Devany's interpretation of Fenianism--tainted traitor though\r\n   he be--rather than believe that the kindly instincts of Irishmen, at\r\n   home and abroad--their generous impulses--their tender\r\n   sensibilities--all their human affections, in a word--could\r\n   degenerate into the attributes of the assassin, as stated by that\r\n   hog-in-armour, that crime-creating Constable Talbot.\r\n\r\n   \"Taking other ground, my lords, I object to any sentence upon me. I\r\n   stand at this bar a declared citizen of the United States of America,\r\n   entitled to the protection of such citizenship; and I protest against\r\n   the right to pass any sentence in any British court for acts done, or\r\n   words spoken, or alleged to be done or spoken, on American soil,\r\n   within the shades of the American flag, and under the sanction of\r\n   American institutions. I protest against the assumption that would in\r\n   this country limit the right of thought, or control the liberty of\r\n   speech in an assemblage of American citizens in an American city. The\r\n   United States will, doubtless, respect and protect her neutrality\r\n   laws and observe the comity of nations, whatever they may mean in\r\n   practice, but I protest against the monstrous fiction--the\r\n   transparent fraud--that would seek in ninety years after the\r\n   evacuation of New York by the British to bring the people of New York\r\n   within the vision and venue of a British jury--that in ninety years\r\n   after the last British bayonet had glistened in an American sunlight,\r\n   after the last keel of the last of the English fleet ploughed its\r\n   last furrow in the Hudson or the Delaware--after ninety years of\r\n   republican independence--would seek to restore that city of New York\r\n   and its institutions to the dominion of the crown and government of\r\n   Great Britain. This is the meaning of it, and disguise it as you may,\r\n   so will it be interpreted beyond the Atlantic. Not that the people of\r\n   America care one jot whether S.J. Meany were hanged, drawn, and\r\n   quartered to-morrow, but that there is a great principle involved.\r\n   Personally, I am of no consequence; politically, I represent in this\r\n   court the adopted citizen of America--for, as the _New York Herald_,\r\n   referring to this case, observed, if the acts done in my regard are\r\n   justifiable, there is nothing to prevent the extension of the same\r\n   justice to any other adopted citizen of the States visiting Great\r\n   Britain. It is, therefore, in the injustice of the case the influence\r\n   lies, and not in the importance of the individual.\r\n\r\n   \"Law is called 'the perfection of reason.' Is there not danger of its\r\n   being regarded as the very climax of absurdity if fictions of this\r\n   kind can be turned into realities on the mere caprice of power. As a\r\n   distinguished English journalist has suggested in reference to the\r\n   case, 'though the law may doubtless be satisfied by the majority in\r\n   the Court of Appeal, yet common sense and common law would be widely\r\n   antagonistic if sentence were to follow a judgment so obtained.'\r\n\r\n   \"On all grounds then I submit, in conclusion, this is not a case for\r\n   sentence. Waving for the purpose the international objection, and\r\n   appealing to British practice itself, I say it is not a fair case for\r\n   sentence. The professed policy of that practice has ever been to give\r\n   the benefit of doubt to the prisoner. Judges in their charges to\r\n   juries have ever theorized on this principle, and surely judges\r\n   themselves will not refuse to give practical effect to the theory. If\r\n   ever there was a case which more than another was suggestive of\r\n   doubt, it is surely one in which so many judges have pronounced\r\n   against the legality of the trial and the validity of the conviction\r\n   on which you are about to pass sentence. Each of these judges, be it\r\n   remembered, held competent in his individuality to administer the\r\n   criminal law of the country--each of whom, in fact, in his\r\n   individuality does so administer it unchallenged and unquestioned.\r\n\r\n   \"A sentence under such circumstances, be it for a long period or a\r\n   short would be wanting in the element of moral effect--the effect of\r\n   example--which could alone give it value, and which is professedly\r\n   the aim of all legal punishment. A sentence under such circumstances\r\n   would be far from reassuring to the public mind as to the\r\n   'certainties' of the law, and would fail to commend the approval or\r\n   win the respect of any man 'within the realm or without.' While to\r\n   the prisoner, to the sufferer in chief, it would only bring the\r\n   bitter, and certainly not the repentant feeling that he suffered in\r\n   the wrong--that he was the victim of an injustice based on an\r\n   inference which not even the tyrant's plea of necessity can\r\n   sustain--namely, that at a particular time he was at a distance of\r\n   three thousand miles from the place where he then actually stood in\r\n   bodily presence, and that at that distance he actually thought the\r\n   thoughts and acted the acts of men unknown to him even by name. It\r\n   will bring to the prisoner, I repeat, the feeling--the bitter\r\n   feeling--that he was condemned on an unindicted charge pressed\r\n   suddenly into the service, and for a constructive crime which some of\r\n   the best authorities in the law have declared not to be a crime\r\n   cognizable in any of your courts.\r\n\r\n   \"Let the crown put forward any supposition they please--indulge in\r\n   what special pleadings they will--sugar over the bitter pill of\r\n   constructive conspiracy as they can--to this complexion must come the\r\n   triangular injustice of this case--the illegal and unconstitutional\r\n   kidnapping in England--the unfair and invalid trial and conviction in\r\n   Ireland for the alleged offence in another hemisphere and under\r\n   mother sovereignty. My lords, I have done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JOHN M'CLURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain John M'Clure, like Captain M'Afferty, was an American born, but\r\nof Irish parentage. He was born at Dobb's Ferry, twenty-two miles from\r\nNew York, on July 17th, 1846, and he was therefore a mere youth when,\r\nserving with distinguished gallantry in the Federal ranks, he attained\r\nthe rank of captain. He took part in the Fenian rising of the 5th March,\r\nand was prominently concerned in the attack and capture of Knockadoon\r\ncoast-guard station. He and his companion, Edward Kelly, were captured\r\nby a military party at Kilclooney Wood, on March 31st, after a smart\r\nskirmish, in which their compatriot the heroic and saintly Peter\r\nCrowley lost his life. His trial took place before the Special\r\nCommission at Cork, on May 22nd and 23rd, 1807. The following are the\r\nspirited and eloquent terms in which he addressed the court previous to\r\nsentence being pronounced on him:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords--In answer to the question as to why the sentence of the\r\n   court should not now be passed upon me, I would desire to make a few\r\n   remarks in relation to my late exertions in behalf of the suffering\r\n   people of this country, in aiding them in their earnest endeavours to\r\n   attain the independence of their native land. Although not born upon\r\n   the soil of Ireland, my parents were, and from history, and\r\n   tradition, and fireside relations, I became conversant with the\r\n   country's history from my earliest childhood, and as the human race\r\n   will ever possess these God-like qualities which inspire mankind with\r\n   sympathy for the suffering, a desire to aid poor Ireland to rise from\r\n   her moral degradation took possession of me. I do not now wish to say\r\n   to what I assign the failure of that enterprise with which are\r\n   associated my well-meant acts for this persecuted land. I feel fully\r\n   satisfied of the righteousness of my every act in connexion with the\r\n   late revolutionary movement in this country, being actuated by a holy\r\n   desire to assist in the emancipation of an enslaved and generous\r\n   people. I derive more pleasure from having done the act than from any\r\n   other event that has occurred to me during my eventful but youthful\r\n   life. I wish it to be distinctly understood here, standing as I do\r\n   perhaps on the brink of an early grave, that I am no fillibuster or\r\n   freebooter, and that I had no personal object or inclination to gain\r\n   anything in coming to this country. I came solely through love of\r\n   Ireland and sympathy for her people. If I have forfeited my life. I\r\n   am ready to abide the issue. If my exertions on behalf of a\r\n   distressed people be a crime, I am willing to pay the penalty,\r\n   knowing, as I do, that what I have done was in behalf of a people\r\n   whose cause is just--a people who will appreciate and honour a man,\r\n   although he may not be a countryman of their own--still a man who is\r\n   willing to suffer in defence of that divine, that American\r\n   principle--the right of self-government. I would wish to tender to my\r\n   learned and eloquent counsel, Mr. Heron and Mr. Waters, and to my\r\n   solicitor, Mr. Collins, my sincere and heartfelt thanks for the able\r\n   manner in which they have conducted my defence. And now, my lords, I\r\n   trust I will meet in a becoming manner the penalty which it is now\r\n   the duty of your lordship to pronounce upon me. I have nothing more\r\n   to say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD KELLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion the prisoner Edward Kelly delivered the following\r\nsoul-stirring address:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lords--The novelty of my situation will plead for any want of\r\n   fluency on my part; and I beg your lordships' indulgence if I am\r\n   unnecessarily tedious. I have to thank the gentlemen of the jury for\r\n   their recommendation, which I know was well meant; but knowing, as I\r\n   do, what that mercy will be, I heartily wish that recommendation will\r\n   not be received. Why should I feel regret? What is death? The act of\r\n   passing from this life into the next. I trust that God will pardon me\r\n   my sins, and that I will have no cause to fear entering into the\r\n   presence of the ever-living and Most Merciful Father. I don't\r\n   recollect in my life ever having done anything with a deliberately\r\n   bad intention. In my late conduct I do not see anything for regret.\r\n   Why then, I say, should I feel regret? I leave the dread of death to\r\n   such wretches as Corridon and Massey--Corridon, a name once so\r\n   suggestive of sweetness and peace, now the representative of a\r\n   loathsome monster. If there be anything that can sink that man,\r\n   Corridon, lower in the scales of degradation, it is--\"\r\n\r\n   The Chief Justice--\"We cannot listen to any imputation on persons who\r\n   were examined as witnesses. Strictly speaking, you are only to say\r\n   why sentence of death should not be passed upon you; at the same time\r\n   we are very unwilling to hold a very strict hand, but we cannot allow\r\n   imputations to be made on third persons, witnesses or others, who\r\n   have come forward in this trial.\"\r\n\r\n   Prisoner--\"Well, my lord, I will answer as well as I can the question\r\n   put to me. The Irish people through every generation ever since\r\n   England has obtained a footing in Ireland, have protested against the\r\n   occupation of our native soil by the English. Surely that is answer\r\n   enough why sentence of death should not be passed upon me. In the\r\n   part I have taken in the late insurrection, I feel conscious that I\r\n   was doing right. Next to serving his Creator, I believe it is a man's\r\n   solemn duty to serve his country. [Here the prisoner paused to\r\n   suppress his emotion, which rendered his utterance very feeble, and\r\n   continued]--my lords, I have nothing more to say, except to quote the\r\n   words of the sacred psalmist, in which you will understand that I\r\n   speak of my country as he speaks of his:--'If I forget thee, O\r\n   Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten, let my tongue cleave to my\r\n   jaws if I do not remember thee: if I make not Jerusalem the beginning\r\n   of my joy. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of\r\n   Jerusalem: who say, raze, raze it, even to the foundation thereof. O\r\n   daughter of Babylon, miserable: blessed be he who shall repay thee\r\n   thy payment which thou hast paid us.' In conclusion, my lords, I\r\n   wish to give my thanks to my attorney, Mr. Collins, for his untiring\r\n   exertions, and also to my counsel, Mr. Heron, for his able defence,\r\n   and to Mr. Waters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN WILLIAM MACKAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evidence adduced at the Cork Summer Assizes of 1867, on the\r\ntrials of persons charged with participation in the Fenian rising of\r\nMarch 5th, the name of Captain Mackay frequently turned up. The captain,\r\nit would appear, was a person of influence and importance in the\r\ninsurrectionary army. He had taken part in many councils of the Fenian\r\nleaders, he was trusted implicitly by his political friends, and much\r\ndeference was paid to his opinion. But more than all this, he had taken\r\nthe field on the night of the rising, led his men gallantly to the\r\nattack of Ballyknockane police barrack, and, to the-great horror of all\r\nloyal subjects, committed the enormous offence of capturing it. This,\r\nand the similar successes achieved by Lennon at Stepaside and\r\nGlencullen, county Wicklow, were some of the incidents of the attempted\r\nrebellion which most annoyed the government, who well knew the influence\r\nwhich such events, occurring at the outset of a revolutionary movement,\r\nare apt to exercise on the popular mind. Captain Mackay, therefore, was\r\nbadly \"wanted\" by the authorities after the Fenian rising; there was any\r\nmoney to be given for information concerning the whereabouts of Captain\r\nMackay, but it came not. Every loyal-minded policeman in Cork county,\r\nand in all the other Irish counties, and every detective, and every spy,\r\nand every traitor in the pay of the government, kept a sharp look out\r\nfor the audacious Captain Mackay, who had compelled the garrison of one\r\nof her Majesty's police barracks to surrender to him, and hand him up\r\ntheir arms in the quietest and most polite manner imaginable; but they\r\nsaw him not, or if they saw, they did not recognise him.\r\n\r\nSo month after month rolled on, and no trace of Captain Mackay could be\r\nhad. The vigilant guardians and servants of English law in Ireland, then\r\nbegan to think he must have managed to get clear out of the country, and\r\nrather expected that the next thing they would hear of him would be that\r\nhe was organizing and lecturing amongst the Irish enemies of England in\r\nthe United States. There, however, they were quite mistaken, as they\r\nsoon found out to their very great vexation and alarm.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th day of December, 1867, there was strange news in Cork, and\r\nstrange news all over the country, for the telegraph wires spread it in\r\nevery direction. The news was that on the previous evening a party of\r\nFenians had entered the Martello tower at Foaty, on the north side of\r\nthe Cork river, made prisoners of the gunners who were in charge, and\r\nhad then taken possession of, and borne away all the arms and ammunition\r\nthey could find in the place! Startling news this was undoubtedly. Loyal\r\nmen stopped each other in the streets, and asked if anything like it had\r\never been heard of. They wanted to know if things were not coming to a\r\npretty pass, and did not hesitate to say they would feel greatly obliged\r\nto anyone who could answer for them the question \"What next?\" For this\r\nsack of the Martello tower was not the first successful raid for arms\r\nwhich the Fenians had made in that neighbourhood. About a month\r\nbefore--on the night of November 28th--they had contrived to get into\r\nthe shop of Mr. Richardson, gunmaker, Patrick-street, and abstract from\r\nthe premises no fewer than 120 revolvers and eight Snider rifles,\r\naccomplishing the feat so skilfully, that no trace either of the weapons\r\nor the depredators had since been discovered. This was what might be\r\ncalled a smart stroke of work, but it shrunk into insignificance\r\ncompared with the audacious act of plundering one of her Majesty's\r\nfortified stations.\r\n\r\nThe details of the affair, which were soon known, were received by the\r\npublic with mingled feelings of amusement and amazement. The Fenian\r\nparty, it was learned, had got into the tower by the usual means of\r\nentrance--a step-ladder, reaching to the door, which is situate at some\r\nheight from the ground. One party of the invaders remained in the\r\napartment just inside the entrance door, while another numbering five\r\npersons, proceeded to an inner room, where they found two of the\r\ngunners, with their families, just in the act of sitting down to tea. In\r\nan instant revolvers were placed at the heads of the men, who were told\r\nnot to stir on peril of their lives. At the same time assurances were\r\ngiven to them, and to the affrighted women, that if they only kept quiet\r\nand complied with the demands of the party no harm whatever should befal\r\nthem. The garrison saw that resistance was useless, and promptly acceded\r\nto those terms. The invaders then asked for and got the keys of the\r\nmagazine, which they handed out to their friends, who forthwith set to\r\nwork to remove the ammunition which they found stored in the vaults.\r\nThey seized about 300 lbs. of gunpowder, made up in 8 lb. cartridges, a\r\nquantity of fuses, and other military stores, and then proceeded to\r\nsearch the entire building for arms. Of these, however, they found very\r\nlittle--nothing more than the rifles and sword bayonets of the two or\r\nthree men who constituted the garrison, a circumstance which seemed to\r\noccasion them much disappointment. They were particularly earnest and\r\npressing in their inquiries for hand-grenades, a species of missile\r\nwhich they had supposed was always kept \"in stock\" in such places. They\r\ncould scarcely believe that there were none to be had. Some charges of\r\ngrape-shot which they laid hands on might be, they thought, the sort of\r\nweapon they were in quest of, and they proceeded to dissect and analyse\r\none of them. Grape-shot, we may explain to the unlearned in these\r\nmatters, is \"an assemblage, in the form of a cylindrical column, of nine\r\nballs resting on a circular plate, through which passes a pin serving as\r\nan axis. The balls are contained in a strong canvas bag, and are bound\r\ntogether on the exterior of the latter by a cord disposed about the\r\ncolumn in the manner of a net.\" This was not the sort of thing the\r\nFenian party wanted; grape-shot could be of no use to them, for the\r\nFenian organization, to its great sorrow, was possessed of no artillery;\r\nthey resolved, therefore, to leave those ingeniously-constructed\r\npackages behind them, and to retire with the more serviceable spoils\r\nthey had gathered. While the search was proceeding, the Fenian sentries,\r\nwith revolvers ready in their hands, stood guard over the gunners, and\r\nprevented anyone--young or old--from quitting the room. They spoke\r\nkindly to all however, chatted with the women, and won the affectionate\r\nregards of the youngsters by distributing money among them. One of these\r\nstrange visitors became so familiar as to tell one of the women that if\r\nshe wished to know who he was, his name was Captain Mac--a piece of\r\ninformation which did not strike her at the time as being of any\r\npeculiar value. When the party had got their booty safely removed from\r\nthe building, this chivalrous captain and his four assistant sentries\r\nprepared to leave; they cautioned the gunners, of whom there were three\r\nat this time in the building--one having entered while the search was\r\nproceeding--against quitting the fort till morning, stating that men\r\nwould be on the watch outside to shoot them if they should attempt it.\r\nSo much being said and done, they bade a polite good evening to her\r\nMajesty's gunners and their interesting families, and withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe heroic garrison did not venture out immediately after they had been\r\nrelieved of the presence of the Fenian party; but finding that a few\r\ncharges of powder were still stowed away in a corner of the fort, they\r\nhurried with them to the top of the building and commenced to blaze away\r\nfrom the big gun which was there _in situ_. This performance they meant\r\nas a signal of distress; but though the sounds were heard and the\r\nflashes seen far and wide, no one divined the object of what appeared to\r\nbe nothing more than an oddly-timed bit of artillery practice. Next\r\nmorning the whole story was in every one's mouth. Vast was the amusement\r\nwhich it afforded to the Corkonians generally, and many were the\r\nencomiums which they passed on the dashing Irish-Americans and smart\r\nyouths of Cork's own town who had accomplished so daring and clever a\r\nfeat. Proportionally great was the irritation felt by the sprinkling of\r\nloyalists and by the paid servants of the crown in that quarter. One\r\nhope at all events the latter party had, that the leader in the\r\nadventure would soon be \"in the hands of justice,\" and one comforting\r\nassurance, that never again would the Fenians be able to replenish their\r\narmoury in so easy and so unlawful a manner.\r\n\r\nFour days afterwards there was another \"sensation\" in Cork. The Fenian\r\ncollectors of arms had made another haul! And this time their mode of\r\naction surpassed all their previous performances in coolness and daring.\r\nAt nine o'clock in the morning, on the 30th of December, eight men, who\r\nhad assumed no disguise, suddenly entered the shop of Mr. Henry Allport,\r\ngunmaker, of Patrick-street, and producing revolvers from their pockets,\r\ncovered him and his two assistants, telling then at the same time that\r\nif they ventured to stir, or raise any outcry, they were dead men. While\r\nthe shopmen remained thus bound to silence, five of the party proceeded\r\nto collect all the rifles and revolvers in the establishment, and place\r\nthem in a canvas sack which had been brought for the purpose. This sack,\r\ninto which a few guns and seventy-two splendid revolvers of the newest\r\nconstruction had been put, was then carried off by two men, who, having\r\ntransferred the contents to the safe-keeping of some confederates,\r\nreturned with it very quickly to receive and bear away a large quantity\r\nof revolver cartridges which had been found in the shop. This second\r\n\"loot\" having been effected, the guards who stood over Mr. Allport and\r\nhis men, lowered their weapons, and after cautioning all three not to\r\ndare to follow them, quitted the shop in a leisurely manner, and\r\ndisappeared down one of the by-streets. As soon as he was able to\r\ncollect his scattered wits, Mr. Allport rushed to the nearest police\r\nstation, and gave information of what had occurred. The police hastened\r\nto the scene of this daring exploit, but of course \"the birds were\r\nflown,\" and no one could say whither.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say how this occurrence intensified the perplexity and the\r\nrage of the government party in all parts of the country. There was\r\nsurely some fierce swearing in Dublin Castle on the day that news\r\narrived, and perhaps many a passionate query blurted out as to whether\r\npolice, detectives, magistrates, and all in that southern district were\r\nnot secretly in league with the rebels. In fact, a surmise actually got\r\ninto the papers that the proprietors of the gunshops knew more about the\r\ndisappearance of the arms, and were less aggrieved by the \"seizure\" than\r\nthey cared to acknowledge. However this might be, the popular party\r\nenjoyed the whole thing immensely, laughed over it heartily, and\r\nexpressed in strong terms their admiration of the skill and daring\r\ndisplayed by the operators. The following squib, which appeared in the\r\n_Nation_ at the time, over the initials \"T.D.S.,\" affords an indication\r\nof the feelings excited among Irish nationalists by those extraordinary\r\noccurrences:--\r\n\r\n   THE CORK MEN AND NEW YORK MEN\r\n\r\n       Oh, the gallant Cork men,\r\n       Mixed with New York men,\r\n   I'm sure their equals they can't be found,\r\n       For persevering\r\n       In deeds of daring,\r\n   They set men staring the world around.\r\n       No spies can match them,\r\n       No sentries watch them,\r\n   No specials catch them or mar their play,\r\n       While the clever Cork men\r\n       And cute New York men\r\n   Work new surprises by night and day.\r\n\r\n       Sedate and steady,\r\n       Calm, quick, and ready,\r\n   They boldly enter, and make no din.\r\n       Where'er such trifles\r\n       As Snider rifles\r\n   And bright six-shooters are stored within.\r\n       The Queen's round towers\r\n       Can't baulk their powers,\r\n   Off go the weapons by sea and shore,\r\n       To where the Cork men\r\n       And smart New York men\r\n   Are daily piling their precious store.\r\n\r\n       John Bull, in wonder,\r\n       With voice like thunder,\r\n   Declares such plunder he roust dislike,\r\n       They next may rowl in\r\n       And sack Haulbowline,\r\n   Or on a sudden run off with Spike.\r\n      His peace is vanished,\r\n       His joys are banished,\r\n   And gay or happy no more he'll be,\r\n       Until those Cork men\r\n       And wild New York men\r\n   Are sunk together beneath the sea.\r\n\r\n       Oh, bold New York men\r\n       And daring Cork men,\r\n   We own your pleasures should all grow dim,\r\n       On thus discerning\r\n       And plainly learning\r\n   That your amusement gives pain to _him_.\r\n       Yet, from the nation,\r\n       This salutation\r\n   Leaps forth, and echoes with thunderous sound--\r\n       \"Here's to all Cork men,\r\n       Likewise New York men,\r\n   Who stand for Ireland, the world around!\"\r\n\r\nBut Captain Mackay, skilful and \"lucky\" as he was, was trapped at last.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 7th of February, 1868, he walked into the grocery\r\nand spirit shop of Mr. Cronin in Market-street--not to drink whiskey or\r\nanything of that sort, for he was a man of strictly temperate habits,\r\nand he well knew that of all men those who are engaged in the dangerous\r\ngame of conspiracy and revolution can least afford to partake of drinks\r\nthat may unloose their tongues and let their wits run wild. He called\r\nfor a glass of lemonade, and recognising some persons who were in the\r\nshop at the time, he commenced a conversation with them.\r\n\r\nOnly a few minutes from the time of his entrance had elapsed when a\r\nparty of police, wearing a disguise over their uniforms, rushed into the\r\nshop, and commanded the door to be shut.\r\n\r\nThe men inside attempted to separate and escape, but they were\r\ninstantly grappled by the police. One of the force seized Captain Mackay\r\nby the collar, and a vigorous struggle between them at once commenced.\r\nThe policeman was much the larger man of the two, but the Fenian Captain\r\nwas wiry and muscular, and proved quite a match for him. They fell, and\r\nrose, and fell, and rose again, the policeman undermost sometimes, and\r\nat other times the Fenian Captain. They struggled for nearly twenty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\"Dead or alive, I'll take you,\" said the policeman, as he drew his\r\nrevolver from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"I have but one life, to lose, and if it goes, so be it,\" replied Mackay\r\ndrawing a weapon of the same kind.\r\n\r\nIn another instant there was a clash as of striking steel, and a\r\ndischarge of one of the weapons.\r\n\r\n\"Good God! I'm shot!\" exclaimed Constable Casey from, the end of the\r\nroom, and he fell upon the floor.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mackay's revolver had gone off in the struggle, and the ball had\r\nstruck the constable in the leg, inflicting on him a serious wound.\r\n\r\nBy this time several parties of police had arrived in the street and\r\nstationed themselves so as to prevent the formation of a crowd and deter\r\nthe people from any attempt at rescue. A reinforcement having turned\r\ninto the house in which the struggle was going on, Captain Mackay and\r\nothers who had been in his company were made prisoners, and marched off\r\nin custody.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, the wounded constable, who had refused to submit\r\nto amputation of the wounded limb, died in hospital.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of March, 1868, at the Cork Assizes, Judge O'Hagan\r\npresiding, Captain Mackay was put on his trial for murder. The evidence\r\nestablished a probability that the discharge of the prisoner's revolver\r\nwas not intended or effected by him, but was a consequence of its having\r\nbeen struck by the revolver of the policeman who was struggling with\r\nhim. The verdict of the jury therefore was one of acquittal.\r\n\r\nBut then came the other charge against him, the charge of\r\ntreason-felony, for his connexion with the Fenian Brotherhood, and his\r\npart in the recent \"rising.\" For this he was put on trial on the 20th\r\nday of March. He was ably defended by Mr. Heron, Q.C.; but the evidence\r\nagainst him was conclusive. To say nothing of the testimony of the\r\ninformers, which should never for a moment be regarded as trustworthy,\r\nthere was the evidence and the identification supplied by the gunners of\r\nthe Martello tower and their wives, and the policemen of Ballyknockane\r\nstation and the wife of one of them. This evidence while establishing\r\nthe fact that the prisoner had been concerned in the levying of war\r\nagainst the crown, established also the fact that he was a man as\r\nchivalrous and gentle as he was valorous and daring. Some of the\r\nincidents proved to have occurred during the attack which was made,\r\nunder his leadership, on the police barrack, are worthy of special\r\nmention in any sketch, however brief, of the life and adventures of this\r\nremarkable man. After he, at the head of his party, had demanded the\r\nsurrender of the barrack in the name of the Irish Republic, the police\r\nfired, and the fire was returned. Then the insurgents broke in the door\r\nand set fire to the lower part of the barrack. Still the police held\r\nout. \"Surrender!\" cried the insurgents; \"_You want to commit suicide,\r\nbut we don't want to commit murder._\" One of the policemen then cried\r\nout that a little girl, his daughter, was inside, and asked if the\r\nattacking party would allow her to be passed out? Of course they would,\r\ngladly; and the little girl was taken out of the window with all\r\ntenderness, and given up to her mother who had chanced to be outside the\r\nbarrack when the attack commenced. At this time a Catholic clergyman,\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Neville, came on the spot. He asked the insurgent leader\r\nwhether, if the police surrendered, any harm would be done to them?\r\n\"Here is my revolver,\" said Captain Mackay, \"let the contents of it be\r\nput through me if one of them should be injured.\" Well did Mr. Heron in\r\nhis able speech, referring to these facts, say, \"Though they were rebels\r\nwho acted that heroic part, who could say their hearts, were not\r\nanimated with the courage of Leonidas, and the chivalry of Bayard.\"\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the trial the jury brought in their verdict,\r\ndeclaring the prisoner guilty, but at the same time recommending him to\r\nthe merciful consideration of the court, because of the humanity which\r\nhe had displayed towards the men whom he had in his power. The finding\r\ntook no one by surprise, and did not seem to trouble the prisoner in the\r\nfaintest degree. During the former trial some shades of anxiety might\r\nhave been detected on his features; the charge of \"murder\" was grievous\r\nto him, but when that was happily disposed of, the world seemed to\r\nbrighten before him, and he took his treason-felony trial cheerily. He\r\nknew what the verdict on the evidence would be, and he was conscious\r\nthat the penalty to be imposed on him would be no trivial one; he felt\r\nthat it was hard to part from faithful comrades, and dear friends, and,\r\nabove all, from the young wife whom he had married only a few short\r\nmonths before; but then it was in Ireland's cause he was about to\r\nsuffer, and for that he could endure all.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Ireland was not his native land. He was born in Cincinnatti,\r\nOhio, in the year 1841. But his parents, who were natives of\r\nCastle-Lyons, near Fermoy, in the County Cork, were true children of\r\nErin, and they taught their son to love, even as they did themselves,\r\nthat green isle far away, from which a hard fate had compelled them to\r\nroam. Patriotism, indeed, was hereditary in the family. The\r\ngreat-grandfather of our hero suffered death for his fidelity to the\r\ncause of Ireland in the memorable year 1798; and a still-more remarkable\r\nfact is that Captain Mackay--or William Francis Lomasney, to call him by\r\nhis real name--in leaving America for Ireland in 1865 to take part in\r\nthe contemplated rising, merely took the place which his father wished\r\nand intended to occupy. The young man induced him, to remain at home,\r\nand claimed for himself the post of danger. Well may that patriotic\r\nfather be proud of such a son.\r\n\r\nWhen called upon for such remarks as he might have to offer on his own\r\nbehalf, Captain Mackay, without any of the airs of a practised speaker,\r\nbut yet with a manner that somehow touched every heart and visibly\r\naffected the humane and upright judge who sat on the bench, delivered\r\nthe following address:--\r\n\r\n   \"My lord--What I said last evening I think calls for a little\r\n   explanation. I then said I was fully satisfied with the verdict--that\r\n   it was a fair and just one. I say so still, but I wish to state that\r\n   I consider it only so in accordance with British law, and that it is\r\n   not in accordance with my ideas of right and justice. I feel that\r\n   with the strong evidence there was against me, according to British\r\n   law, the jury could not, as conscientious men, do otherwise. I feel\r\n   that. I thank them again for their recommendation to mercy, which, I\r\n   have no doubt, was prompted by a good intention towards me, and a\r\n   desire to mitigate what they considered would he a long and painful\r\n   imprisonment. Still, I will say, with all respect, that I feel the\r\n   utmost indifference to it. I do so for this reason--I am now in that\r\n   position that I must rely entirely upon the goodness of God, and I\r\n   feel confident that He will so dispose events that I will not remain\r\n   a prisoner so long as your lordship may be pleased to decree. The\r\n   jury having now found me guilty, it only remains for your lordship to\r\n   give effect to their verdict. The eloquence, the ability, the clear\r\n   reasoning, and the really splendid arguments of my counsel failed, as\r\n   I knew they would, to affect the jury. I feel, therefore, that with\r\n   my poor talents it would be utterly vain and useless for me to\r\n   attempt to stay the sentence which it now becomes your lordship's\r\n   duty to pronounce. I believe, my lord, from what I have seen of your\r\n   lordship, and what I have heard of you, it will be to you a painful\r\n   duty to inflict that sentence upon me. To one clinging so much to the\r\n   world and its joys--to its fond ties and pleasant associations, as I\r\n   naturally do, retirement into banishment is seldom--very\r\n   seldom--welcome. Of that, however, I do not complain. But to any man\r\n   whose heart glows with the warmest impulses and the most intense love\r\n   of freedom; strongly attached to kind friends, affectionate parents,\r\n   loving brother and sisters, and a devotedly fond and loving wife, the\r\n   contemplation of a long period of imprisonment must appear most\r\n   terrible and appalling. To me, however, viewing it from a purely\r\n   personal point of view, and considering the cause for which I am\r\n   about to suffer, far from being dismayed--far from its discouraging\r\n   me--it proves to me rather a source of joy and comfort. True, it is a\r\n   position not to be sought--not to be looked for--it is one which, for\r\n   many, very many reasons there is no occasion for me now to explain,\r\n   maybe thought to involve disgrace or discredit. But, so far from\r\n   viewing it in that light, I do not shrink from it, but accept it\r\n   readily, feeling proud and glad that it affords me an opportunity of\r\n   proving the sincerity of those soul-elevating principles of freedom\r\n   which a good old patriotic father instilled into my mind from my\r\n   earliest years, and which I still entertain with a strong love, whose\r\n   fervour and intensity are second only to the sacred homage which we\r\n   owe to God. If, having lost that freedom, I am to be deprived of all\r\n   those blessings--those glad and joyous years I should have spent\r\n   amongst loving friends--I shall not complain, I shall not murmur, but\r\n   with calm resignation and cheerful expectation, I shall joyfully\r\n   submit to God's blessed will, feeling confident that He will open the\r\n   strongly locked and barred doors of British prisons. Till that glad\r\n   time arrives, it is consolation and reward enough for me to know that\r\n   I have the fervent prayers, the sympathy and loving blessings of\r\n   Ireland's truly noble and generous people, and far easier, more\r\n   soothing and more comforting to me will it be to go back to my\r\n   cheerless cell, than it would be to live in slavish ease and\r\n   luxury--a witness to the cruel sufferings and terrible miseries of\r\n   this down-trodden people. Condemn me, then, my lord--condemn me to a\r\n   felon's doom. To-night I will sleep in a prison cell; to-morrow I\r\n   will wear a convict's dress; but to me it will be a far nobler garb\r\n   than the richest dress of slavery. Coward slaves they lie who think\r\n   the countless sufferings and degradation of prison life disgraces a\r\n   man. I feel otherwise. It is as impossible to subdue the soul\r\n   animated with freedom as it will be for England to crush the resolute\r\n   will of this nation, determined as it is to be free, or perish in the\r\n   attempt. According to British law, those acts proved against\r\n   me--fairly proved against me I acknowledge--maybe crimes, but\r\n   morally, in the eyes of freemen and the sight of God, they are more\r\n   ennobling than disgraceful. Shame is only a connexion with guilt. It\r\n   is surely not a crime to obey God's law, or to assist our fellow-men\r\n   to acquire those God-given rights which no men--no nation--can justly\r\n   deprive them of. If love of freedom and a desire to extend its\r\n   unspeakable blessings to all God's creatures, irrespective of race,\r\n   creed, or colour, be a crime--if devotion to Ireland, and love of its\r\n   faithful, its honest, its kindly people be a crime, then I say I\r\n   proudly and gladly acknowledge my guilt. If it is a disgrace, all I\r\n   can say is I glory in such shame and dishonour; and, with all respect\r\n   for the court, I hold in thorough and utmost contempt the worst\r\n   punishment that can be inflicted upon me, so far as it is intended to\r\n   deprive me of this feeling, and degrade me in the eyes of my\r\n   fellow-men. Oh, no, it is impossible, my lord; the freeman's soul can\r\n   never be dismayed. England will most miserably fail if she expects by\r\n   force and oppression to crush out--to stamp out, as the _Times_\r\n   exclaimed--this glorious longing for national life and independence\r\n   which now fills the breasts of millions of Irishmen, and which only\r\n   requires a little patience and the opportunity to effect its purpose.\r\n   Much has been said on these trials, on the objects and intentions of\r\n   Fenianism. I feel confidently, my lord, as to my own motives. I shall\r\n   not be guilty of the egotism to say whether they are pure or\r\n   otherwise. I shall leave that to others to judge. I am not qualified\r\n   to judge that myself; but I know in my soul that the motives which\r\n   prompted me were pure, patriotic, and unselfish. I know the motives\r\n   that actuate the most active members of the Fenian organization; and\r\n   I know that very few persons, except such contemptible wretches as\r\n   Corridon, have profited by their connexion with Fenianism. My best\r\n   friends lost all they ever possessed by it. Talbot and Corridon, I\r\n   believe, have sworn on previous trials that it was the intention of\r\n   the Fenians to have divided the lands of Ireland amongst themselves\r\n   in the event of success. Though an humble member of the organization,\r\n   I have the honour and satisfaction of being acquainted with the great\r\n   majority of the leaders of Fenianism on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\n   and I never knew one of them to have exhibited a desire other than to\r\n   have the proud satisfaction of freeing Ireland, which was the only\r\n   reward they ever yearned for--the only object that ever animated\r\n   them. As to myself, I can truly say that I entered into this movement\r\n   without any idea of personal aggrandisement. When, in 1865, I bade my\r\n   loving friends and parents good-bye in America, and came to Ireland,\r\n   I was fully satisfied with the thought that I was coming to assist in\r\n   the liberation of an enslaved nation; and I knew that the greatest\r\n   sacrifices must be endured on our parts before the country could be\r\n   raised to that proud position which is so beautifully described by\r\n   the national poet as--\r\n\r\n           \"'Great, glorious, and free,\r\n   First flower of the earth, first gem of the sea.'\r\n\r\n   \"Well, it was with that only wish, and that only desire I came to\r\n   Ireland, feeling that to realize it were to an honest man a greater\r\n   reward than all the honours and riches and power this world could\r\n   bestow. I cannot boast of learning, my lord; I have not had much\r\n   opportunity of cultivating those talents with which Providence may\r\n   have blessed me. Still I have read sufficient of the world's history\r\n   to know that no people ever acquired their liberty without enormous\r\n   sacrifices--without losing, always, I may say, some of the purest,\r\n   bravest, and best of their children. Liberty, if worth possessing, is\r\n   surely worth struggling and fighting for, and in this struggle--of\r\n   which, although the crown-lawyers and the government of England think\r\n   they have seen the end, but of which I tell them they have not yet\r\n   seen the commencement--I feel that enormous sacrifices must be made.\r\n   Therefore, my lord, looking straight before me now, I say I was\r\n   determined and was quite ready to sacrifice my life if necessary to\r\n   acquire that liberty; and I am not now going to be so mean-spirited,\r\n   so cowardly, or so contemptible as to shrink from my portion of the\r\n   general suffering. I am ready, then, for the sentence of the court,\r\n   satisfied that I have acted right, confident that I have committed no\r\n   wrong, outrage, or crime whatever, and that I have cast no disgrace\r\n   upon my parents, my friends, upon my devoted wife, or upon myself. I\r\n   am, with God's assistance, ready to meet my fate. I rest in the calm\r\n   resignation of a man whose only ambition through life has been to\r\n   benefit and free, not to injure, his fellow-men; and whose only\r\n   desire this moment is to obtain their prayers and blessings. With the\r\n   approval of my own conscience, above all hoping for the forgiveness\r\n   of God for anything I may have done to displease Him, and relying\r\n   upon His self-sustaining grace to enable me to bear any punishment,\r\n   no matter how severe, so long as it is for glorious old Ireland. I\r\n   had intended, my lord, to refer to my notes which I took at the\r\n   trial; but I feel that was so ably done by my counsel, it would be a\r\n   mere waste of time for me to do so, but I just wish to make an\r\n   explanation. Sir C. O'Loghlen made a statement--unintentionally I am\r\n   sure it was on his part--which may or may not affect me. He said I\r\n   sent a memorial to the Lord Lieutenant praying to be released from\r\n   custody. I wish to say I sent no such thing. The facts of the matter\r\n   are these:--I was liberated in this court because in reality the\r\n   crown could not make out a case against me at the time; and as I\r\n   could, at the same time, be kept in prison until the next assizes, I,\r\n   on consultation with my friends and with my fellow-captive, Captain\r\n   M'Afferty, consented, as soon as I should receive a remittance from\r\n   my friends in America, to return there. On these conditions I was set\r\n   at liberty, understanding, at the same time, that if found in the\r\n   country by next assizes I would be brought up for trial. I did not\r\n   want to give annoyance, and I said I would go to America. I honestly\r\n   intended to do so then--not, however, as giving up my principles, but\r\n   because I saw there was no hope of an immediate rising in Ireland.\r\n   While agreeing to those conditions, I went to Dublin, and there met\r\n   M'Afferty, and it was on that occasion I made the acquaintance of\r\n   Corridon. I met him purely accidentally. He afterwards stated that he\r\n   saw me in Liverpool, but he did not see me there. I went over with an\r\n   object, and while there I was arrested by anticipation, before the\r\n   _Habeas Corpus_ Act was really suspended. I defy the government to\r\n   prove I had any connexion with Fenianism from the time I was released\r\n   from Cork jail until February, 1867. I was afterwards removed to\r\n   Mountjoy prison, and, while there, Mr. West came to me and said he\r\n   understood I was an American citizen, and asked why I did not make\r\n   that known. I said I had a double reason--first, because I expected\r\n   the crown would see they had broken their pledge with me in having\r\n   been so soon arrested; and also that I expected my government would\r\n   make a general demand for all its citizens. By Mr. West's desire I\r\n   put that statement in writing; and I do not think that there is a\r\n   word in it that can be construed into a memorial to the Lord\r\n   Lieutenant. One of the directors of the prison came to me and asked\r\n   me was I content to comply with the former conditions, and I said I\r\n   was. I was liberated upon those conditions, and complied with them;\r\n   but there was no condition whatever named that I was never to return\r\n   to Ireland nor to fight for Irish independence. At that time I would\r\n   sooner have remained in prison than enter into any such compact. Now,\r\n   with reference to Corridon's information. He states he met me in\r\n   Liverpool after the rising, and I stated to him that somebody 'sold\r\n   the pass' upon us--to use the Irish phrase. Now, it is a strange\r\n   thing, my lord, that he got some information that was true, and I\r\n   really was in Liverpool, but not with the informer. The fact is, the\r\n   month previous to that I knew, and so did M'Afferty, that Corridon\r\n   had sold us. We left instructions at Liverpool to have him watched;\r\n   but owing to circumstances, it is needless now to refer to, that was\r\n   not attended to, and he came afterwards to Ireland and passed as a\r\n   Fenian, and the parties here, not knowing he had betrayed them, still\r\n   believed in him. But I knew very well that Corridon had betrayed that\r\n   Chester affair, and so did Captain M'Afferty; and if I had met him at\r\n   that time in Liverpool I don't think it would be him I would inform\r\n   of our plans. I only want to show, my lord, how easily an informer\r\n   can concoct a scene. I never in my life attended that meeting that\r\n   Corridon swore to. All his depositions with respect to me is false. I\r\n   did meet him twice in Dublin, but not on the occasions he states. I\r\n   wish to show how an informer can concoct a story that it will be\r\n   entirely out of the power of the prisoner to contradict. With\r\n   reference to the witness Curtin, whom I asked to have produced--and\r\n   the crown did produce all the witnesses I asked for--your lordship\r\n   seemed to be under the impression that I did not produce him because\r\n   he might not be able to say I was not in his house that night. Now,\r\n   the fact is that, as my attorney learned the moment Mr. Curtin was\r\n   brought to town, he knew nothing whatever about the circumstance, as\r\n   he was not in his own tavern that night at all. That was why I did\r\n   not produce the evidence. But I solemnly declare I never was in\r\n   Curtin's public-house in my life till last summer, when I went in\r\n   with a friend on two or three occasions, and then for the first time.\r\n   That must have been in June or July, after the trials were over in\r\n   Dublin. So that everything Corridon said in connection with my being\r\n   there that night was absolutely false. I solemnly declare I was never\r\n   there till some time last summer, when I went in under the\r\n   circumstances I have stated. In conclusion, my lord, though it may\r\n   not be exactly in accordance with the rules of the court, I wish to\r\n   return your lordship my most sincere thanks for your fair and\r\n   impartial conduct during this trial. If there was anything that was\r\n   not impartial in it at all, I consider it was only in my favour, and\r\n   not in favour of the crown. This I consider is the duty of a judge,\r\n   and what every judge should do--because the prisoner is always on the\r\n   weak side, and cannot say many things he would wish, while the crown,\r\n   on the other hand, have all the power and influence that the law and\r\n   a full exchequer can give them. I must also return my sincere and\r\n   heartfelt thanks to my able and distinguished counsel, who spoke so\r\n   eloquently in my favour. As for Mr. Collins, I feel I can never\r\n   sufficiently thank him. He served me on my trial at a great sacrifice\r\n   of time and money, with noble zeal and devotion, such as might be\r\n   more readily expected from a friend than a solicitor. There are many\r\n   more I would like to thank individually, but as this may not be the\r\n   proper time and place to do so, I can only thank all my friends from\r\n   the bottom of my heart. I may mention the name at least of Mr. Joyce,\r\n   who, in the jail, showed a great deal of kind feeling and attention.\r\n   And now, my lord, as I have already stated, I am ready for my\r\n   sentence I feel rather out of place in this dock [the prisoner here\r\n   smiled gently]. It is a place a man is very seldom placed in, and\r\n   even if he is a good speaker he might be put out by the circumstance\r\n   of having to utter his remarks from this place. But speaking at all\r\n   is not my _forte_; and there are such emotions filling my breast at\r\n   this moment that I may be pardoned for not saying all I would wish.\r\n   My heart is filled with thoughts of kind friends--near at hand and\r\n   far away--of father and mother, brothers and sisters, and my dear\r\n   wife. Thoughts of these fill my breast at this moment, and check my\r\n   utterance. But I will say to them that I am firmly convinced I will\r\n   yet live to see, and that God will be graciously pleased in His own\r\n   good time to order, the prosperity and freedom of this glorious\r\n   country. I would only repeat the powerful, touching, and simple words\r\n   of Michael Larkin, the martyr of Manchester, who, in parting from his\r\n   friends, said, 'God be with you, Irishmen and Irishwomen,' and the\r\n   burning words of my old friend Edward O'Mara Condon, which are now\r\n   known throughout Ireland and the world, 'God save Ireland!' And I,\r\n   too, would say, 'God be with you, Irishmen and women; God save you;\r\n   God bless Ireland; and God grant me strength to bear my task for\r\n   Ireland as becomes a man. Farewell!' [A sound of some females sobbing\r\n   was here heard in the gallery. Several ladies in court, too, visibly\r\n   yielded to emotion at this point. Perceiving this the prisoner\r\n   continued:--] My lord, if I display any emotion at this moment, I\r\n   trust it will not be construed into anything resembling a feeling of\r\n   despair, for no such feeling animates me. I feel, as I have already\r\n   said, confidence in God. I feel that I will not be long in\r\n   imprisonment; therefore I am just as ready to meet my fate now as I\r\n   was six weeks ago, or as I was six months ago. I feel confident that\r\n   there is a glorious future in store for Ireland, and that, with a\r\n   little patience, a little organization, and a full trust in God on\r\n   the part of the Irish people, they will be enabled to obtain it at no\r\n   distant date.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the concluding passages of this address many persons sobbed and\r\nwept in various parts of the court. At its close the learned judge in\r\nlanguage that was really gentle, considerate, and even complimentary\r\ntowards the prisoner, and in a voice shaken by sincere emotion, declared\r\nthe sentence which he felt it to be his duty to impose. It was penal\r\nservitude for a term of twelve years.",
