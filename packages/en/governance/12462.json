RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME VI\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS\r\n\r\n1902\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Presidential papers during the period from March 4, 1861, to March\r\n4, 1869, are contained in this volume. No other period of American\r\nhistory since the Revolution comprises so many events of surpassing\r\nimportance. The Administrations of Presidents Lincoln, and Johnson\r\nrepresent two distinct epochs. That of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated to\r\nthe successful prosecution of the most stupendous war of modern times,\r\nwhile that of Andrew Johnson was dedicated to the reestablishment\r\nof peace and the restoration of the Union as it had existed prior\r\nto the war. Strange to say, it fell to the lot of the kind-hearted\r\nhumanitarian, who loved peace and his fellow-man, to wage the bloody\r\nconflict of civil war, and the more aggressive, combative character\r\ndirected the affairs of the Government while the land took upon itself\r\nthe conditions of peace. Yet who can say that each was not best suited\r\nfor his particular sphere of action? A greater lover of his kind has not\r\nfilled the office of President since Thomas Jefferson, and no public\r\nservant ever left with the people a gentler memory than Abraham Lincoln.\r\nA more self-willed and determined Chief Executive has not held that\r\noffice since Andrew Jackson, and no public servant ever left with the\r\npeople a higher character for honesty, integrity, and sincerity of\r\npurpose and action than Andrew Johnson. The life of each of these two\r\ngreat men had been a series of obscure but heroic struggles; each had\r\nexperienced a varied and checkered career; each reached the highest\r\npolitical station of earth. Their official state papers are of supreme\r\ninterest, and comprise the utterances of President Lincoln while he in\r\nfour years placed in the field nearly three millions of soldiers; what\r\nhe said when victories were won or when his armies went down in defeat;\r\nwhat treasures of blood and money it cost to triumph; also, the\r\nutterances of President Johnson as he through his eventful term waged\r\nthe fiercest political battle of our country's history in his efforts,\r\nalong his own lines, for the restoration of peace and the reunion of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nInteresting papers relating to the death and funeral obsequies of\r\nPresident Lincoln have been inserted, as also the more important papers\r\nand proceedings connected with the impeachment of President Johnson.\r\n\r\nMuch time and labor have been expended in the compilation of this\r\nvolume--more than on any one of the preceding--to the end that all\r\npapers of importance that could be found should be published; and I feel\r\nsure that no other collection of Presidential papers is so thorough and\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe perusal of these papers should kindle within the heart of every\r\ncitizen of the American Republic, whether he fought on the one side or\r\nthe other in that unparalleled struggle, or whether he has come upon the\r\nscene since its closing, a greater love of country, a greater devotion\r\nto the cause of true liberty, and an undying resolve that all the\r\nblessings of a free government and the fullest liberty of the individual\r\nshall be perpetuated.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 25, 1897.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1861, to April 15, 1865\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN was born in Hardin County, Ky., February 12, 1809. His\r\nearliest ancestor in America was Samuel Lincoln, of Norwich, England,\r\nwho settled in Hingham, Mass., where he died, leaving a son, Mordecai,\r\nwhose son of the same name removed to Monmouth, N.J., and thence to\r\nBerks County, Pa., where he died in 1735. One of his sons, John, removed\r\nto Buckingham County, Va., and died there, leaving five sons, one of\r\nwhom, named Abraham, emigrated to Kentucky about 1780. About 1784 he was\r\nkilled by Indians, leaving three sons, Mordecai, Josiah, and Thomas, and\r\ntwo daughters. Their mother then located in Washington County, Ky., and\r\nthere brought up her family. The youngest son, Thomas, learned the trade\r\nof a carpenter, and in 1806 married Nancy Hanks, a niece of the man with\r\nwhom he learned his trade. They had three children, the second being\r\nAbraham, the future President of the United States. In 1816 Thomas\r\nLincoln removed to Indiana, and settled on Little Pigeon Creek, not far\r\ndistant from the Ohio River, where Abraham grew to manhood. He made the\r\nbest use of his limited opportunities to acquire an education and at the\r\nsame time prepare himself for business. At the age of 19 years he was\r\nintrusted with a cargo of farm products, which he took to New Orleans\r\nand sold. In 1830 his father again emigrated, and located in Macon\r\nCounty, Ill. Abraham by this time had attained the unusual stature of\r\n6 feet 4 inches, and was of great muscular strength; joined with his\r\nfather in building his cabin, clearing the field, and splitting the\r\nrails for fencing the farm. It was not long, however, before his father\r\nagain changed his home, locating this time in Coles County, where he\r\ndied in 1851 at the age of 73 years. Abraham left his father as soon as\r\nhis farm was fenced and cleared and hired himself to a man named Denton\r\nOffutt, in Sangamon County, whom he assisted to build a flatboat;\r\naccompanied him to New Orleans on a trading voyage and returned with him\r\nto New Salem, Menard County, where Offutt opened a store for the sale of\r\ngeneral merchandise. Mr. Lincoln remained with him for a time, during\r\nwhich he employed his leisure in constant reading and study. Learned\r\nthe elements of English grammar and made a beginning in the study of\r\nsurveying and the principles of law. But the next year an Indian war\r\nbegan, and Lincoln volunteered in a company raised in Sangamon County\r\nand was immediately elected captain. His company was organized at\r\nRichland April 21, 1832; but his service in command of it was brief, for\r\nit was mustered out on May 27. Mr. Lincoln immediately reenlisted as a\r\nprivate and served for several weeks, being finally mustered out on June\r\n16, 1832, by Lieutenant Robert Anderson, who afterwards commanded Fort\r\nSumter at the beginning of the civil war. He returned to his home and\r\nmade a brief but active canvass for the legislature, but was defeated.\r\nAt this time he thought seriously of learning the blacksmith's trade,\r\nbut an opportunity was offered him to buy a store, which he did, giving\r\nhis notes for the purchase money. He was unfortunate in his selection of\r\na partner, and the business soon went to wreck, leaving him burdened\r\nwith a heavy debt, which he finally paid in full. He then applied\r\nhimself earnestly to the study of the law. Was appointed postmaster of\r\nNew Salem in 1833, and filled the office for three years. At the same\r\ntime was appointed deputy county surveyor. In 1834 was elected to the\r\nlegislature, and was reelected in 1836, 1838, and 1840, after which he\r\ndeclined further election. In his last two terms he was the candidate of\r\nhis party for the speakership of the house of representatives. In 1837\r\nremoved to Springfield, where he entered into partnership with John\r\nT. Stuart and began the practice of the law. November 4, 1842, married\r\nMiss Mary Todd, daughter of Robert S. Todd, of Kentucky. In 1846 was\r\nelected to Congress over Rev. Peter Cartwright. Served only one term,\r\nand was not a candidate for reelection. While a member he advocated the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. Was an unsuccessful\r\napplicant for Commissioner of the General Land Office under President\r\nTaylor; was tendered the office of governor of Oregon Territory, which\r\nhe declined. Was an able and influential exponent of the principles of\r\nthe Whig party in Illinois, and did active campaign work. Was voted for\r\nby the Whig minority in the State legislature for United States Senator\r\nin 1855. As soon as the Republican party was fully organized throughout\r\nthe country he became its leader in Illinois. In 1858 he was chosen by\r\nhis party to oppose Stephen A. Douglas for the Senate, and challenged\r\nhim to a joint debate. The challenge was accepted, and a most exciting\r\ndebate followed, which attracted national attention. The legislature\r\nchosen was favorable to Mr. Douglas, and he was elected. In May, 1860,\r\nwhen the Republican convention met in Chicago, Mr. Lincoln was nominated\r\nfor the Presidency, on the third ballot, over William H. Seward, who was\r\nhis principal competitor. Was elected on November 6, receiving 180\r\nelectoral votes to 72 for John C. Breckinridge, 39 for John Bell, and\r\n12 for Stephen A. Douglas. Was inaugurated March 4, 1861. On June 8,\r\n1864, was unanimously renominated for the Presidency by the Republican\r\nconvention at Baltimore, and at the election in November received 212\r\nelectoral votes to 21 for General McClellan. Was inaugurated for his\r\nsecond term March 4, 1865. Was shot by an assassin at Ford's Theater, in\r\nWashington, April 14, 1865, and died the next day. Was buried at Oak\r\nRidge, near Springfield, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a custom as old as the Government itself, I appear\r\nbefore you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath\r\nprescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the\r\nPresident \"before he enters on the execution of his office.\"\r\n\r\nI do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those\r\nmatters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nApprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that\r\nby the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their\r\npeace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been\r\nany reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample\r\nevidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to\r\ntheir inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of\r\nhim who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches\r\nwhen I declare that--\r\n\r\n  I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the\r\n  institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe\r\n  I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had\r\nmade this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them; and\r\nmore than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a\r\nlaw to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I\r\nnow read:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the\r\n  States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its\r\n  own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is\r\n  essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance\r\n  of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by\r\n  armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what\r\n  pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now reiterate these sentiments, and in doing so I only press upon\r\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\r\nsusceptible that the property, peace, and security of no section are\r\nto be in any wise endangered by the now incoming Administration. I add,\r\ntoo, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution\r\nand the laws, can be given will be cheerfully given to all the States\r\nwhen lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section\r\nas to another.\r\n\r\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from\r\nservice or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the\r\nConstitution as any other of its provisions:\r\n\r\n  No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof,\r\n  escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation\r\n  therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered\r\n  up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who\r\nmade it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the\r\nintention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear\r\ntheir support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as\r\nto any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come\r\nwithin the terms of this clause \"shall be delivered up\" their oaths are\r\nunanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they\r\nnot with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which\r\nto keep good that unanimous oath?\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be\r\nenforced by national or by State authority, but surely that difference\r\nis not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be\r\nof but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is\r\ndone. And should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go\r\nunkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to _how_ it shall be\r\nkept?\r\n\r\nAgain: In any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of\r\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so\r\nthat a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave? And might it\r\nnot be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of\r\nthat clause in the Constitution which guarantees that \"the citizens of\r\neach State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens in the several States\"?\r\n\r\nI take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations and with no\r\npurpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules;\r\nand while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as\r\nproper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all,\r\nboth in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all\r\nthose acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting\r\nto find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\r\nunder our National Constitution. During that period fifteen different\r\nand greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government. They have conducted it through many\r\nperils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope of\r\nprecedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional\r\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of\r\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\r\n\r\nI hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution\r\nthe Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not\r\nexpressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is\r\nsafe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its\r\norganic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express\r\nprovisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will endure\r\nforever, it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not\r\nprovided for in the instrument itself.\r\n\r\nAgain: If the United States be not a government proper, but an\r\nassociation of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a\r\ncontract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\r\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak--but does\r\nit not require all to lawfully rescind it?\r\n\r\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition that\r\nin legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history\r\nof the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution.\r\nIt was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was\r\nmatured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was\r\nfurther matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly\r\nplighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of\r\nConfederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects\r\nfor ordaining and establishing the Constitution was \"_to form a more\r\nperfect Union_.\"\r\n\r\nBut if destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\r\nbe lawfully possible, the Union is _less_ perfect than before the\r\nConstitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can\r\nlawfully get out of the Union; that _resolves_ and _ordinances_ to that\r\neffect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or\r\nStates against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or\r\nrevolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nI therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws the\r\nUnion is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as\r\nthe Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the\r\nUnion be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to\r\nbe only a simple duty on my part, and I shall perform it so far as\r\npracticable unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall\r\nwithhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the\r\ncontrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\r\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it _will_ constitutionally defend and\r\nmaintain itself.\r\n\r\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there\r\nshall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power\r\nconfided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property\r\nand places belonging to the Government and to collect the duties and\r\nimposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will\r\nbe no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.\r\nWhere hostility to the United States in any interior locality shall be\r\nso great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from\r\nholding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious\r\nstrangers among the people for that object. While the strict legal right\r\nmay exist in the Government to enforce the exercise of these offices,\r\nthe attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable\r\nwithal that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\r\nof the Union. So far as possible the people everywhere shall have that\r\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and\r\nreflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current\r\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\r\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised,\r\naccording to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope\r\nof a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of\r\nfraternal sympathies and affections.\r\n\r\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the\r\nUnion at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it I will neither\r\naffirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them.\r\nTo those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\r\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\r\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you\r\nhazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any\r\nportion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while\r\nthe certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly\r\nfrom, will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?\r\n\r\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can\r\nbe maintained. Is it true, then, that any right plainly written in the\r\nConstitution has been denied? I think not. Happily, the human mind is\r\nso constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\r\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written\r\nprovision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force\r\nof numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written\r\nconstitutional right, it might in a moral point of view justify\r\nrevolution; certainly would if such right were a vital one. But such is\r\nnot our case. All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are\r\nso plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties\r\nand prohibitions, in the Constitution that controversies never arise\r\nconcerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision\r\nspecifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical\r\nadministration. No foresight can anticipate nor any document of\r\nreasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions.\r\nShall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State\r\nauthority? The Constitution does not expressly say. _May_ Congress\r\nprohibit slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly\r\nsay. _Must_ Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The\r\nConstitution does not expressly say.\r\n\r\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional\r\ncontroversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.\r\nIf the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the Government\r\nmust cease. There is no other alternative, for continuing the Government\r\nis acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority in such case\r\nwill secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn\r\nwill divide and ruin them, for a minority of their own will secede from\r\nthem whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. For\r\ninstance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two\r\nhence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present\r\nUnion now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments\r\nare now being educated to the exact temper of doing this.\r\n\r\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose\r\na new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession?\r\n\r\nPlainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.\r\nA majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\r\nand always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions\r\nand sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever\r\nrejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity\r\nis impossible. The rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is\r\nwholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy\r\nor despotism in some form is all that is left.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional\r\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that\r\nsuch decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as\r\nto the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high\r\nrespect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments\r\nof the Government. And while it is obviously possible that such decision\r\nmay be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it,\r\nbeing limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be\r\noverruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be\r\nborne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time,\r\nthe candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government\r\nupon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably\r\nfixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in\r\nordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will\r\nhave ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically\r\nresigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor\r\nis there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is\r\na duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought\r\nbefore them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their\r\ndecisions to political purposes.\r\n\r\nOne section of our country believes slavery is _right_ and ought to be\r\nextended, while the other believes it is _wrong_ and ought not to be\r\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave\r\nclause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the\r\nforeign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can\r\never be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly\r\nsupports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry\r\nlegal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I\r\nthink, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases\r\n_after_ the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave\r\ntrade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without\r\nrestriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially\r\nsurrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\nPhysically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our\r\nrespective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between\r\nthem. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and\r\nbeyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country\r\ncan not do this. They can not but remain face to face, and intercourse,\r\neither amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible,\r\nthen, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory\r\n_after_ separation than _before_? Can aliens make treaties easier than\r\nfriends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between\r\naliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you can not\r\nfight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on\r\neither, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of\r\nintercourse, are again upon you.\r\n\r\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\r\nit. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they\r\ncan exercise their _constitutional_ right of amending it or their\r\n_revolutionary_ right to dismember or overthrow it. I can not be\r\nignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are\r\ndesirous of having the National Constitution amended. While I make no\r\nrecommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority\r\nof the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the\r\nmodes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing\r\ncircumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being\r\nafforded the people to act upon it. I will venture to add that to me\r\nthe convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to\r\noriginate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to\r\ntake or reject propositions originated by others, not especially chosen\r\nfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would\r\nwish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed amendment to\r\nthe Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has passed\r\nCongress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never\r\ninterfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that\r\nof persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have\r\nsaid, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments\r\nso far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied\r\nconstitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and\r\nirrevocable.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they\r\nhave conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the\r\nStates. The people themselves can do this also if they choose, but the\r\nExecutive as such has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer\r\nthe present Government as it came to his hands and to transmit it\r\nunimpaired by him to his successor.\r\n\r\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice\r\nof the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our\r\npresent differences, is either party without faith of being in the\r\nright? If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with His eternal truth and\r\njustice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that\r\ntruth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great\r\ntribunal of the American people.\r\n\r\nBy the frame of the Government under which we live this same people have\r\nwisely given their public servants but little power for mischief, and\r\nhave with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their\r\nown hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their virtue\r\nand vigilance no Administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly\r\ncan very seriously injure the Government in the short space of four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and _well_ upon this whole\r\nsubject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an\r\nobject to _hurry_ any of you in hot haste to a step which you would\r\nnever take _deliberately_, that object will be frustrated by taking\r\ntime; but no good object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now\r\ndissatisfied still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the\r\nsensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new\r\nAdministration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change\r\neither. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the\r\nright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for\r\nprecipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm\r\nreliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still\r\ncompetent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn _your_ hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in _mine_,\r\nis the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail\r\n_you_. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.\r\n_You_ have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government, while\r\n_I_ shall have the most solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nI am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\r\nenemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds\r\nof affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every\r\nbattlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all\r\nover this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again\r\ntouched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 16, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe Senate has transmitted to me a copy of the message sent by my\r\npredecessor to that body on the 21st day of February last, proposing to\r\ntake its advice on the subject of a proposition made by the British\r\nGovernment through its minister here to refer the matter in controversy\r\nbetween that Government and the Government of the United States to the\r\narbitrament of the King of Sweden and Norway, the King of the\r\nNetherlands, or the Republic of the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\nIn that message my predecessor stated that he wished to submit to the\r\nSenate the precise questions following, namely:\r\n\r\n  Will the Senate approve a treaty referring to either of the sovereign\r\n  powers above named the dispute now existing between the Governments of\r\n  the United States and Great Britain concerning the boundary line between\r\n  Vancouvers Island and the American continent? In case the referee shall\r\n  find himself unable to decide where the line is by the description of it\r\n  in the treaty of 15th June, 1846, shall he be authorized to establish a\r\n  line according to the treaty as nearly as possible? Which of the three\r\n  powers named by Great Britain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the\r\n  United States?\r\n\r\n\r\nI find no reason to disapprove of the course of my predecessor in this\r\nimportant matter, but, on the contrary, I not only shall receive the\r\nadvice of the Senate therein cheerfully, but I respectfully ask the\r\nSenate for their advice on the three questions before recited.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 26, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received a copy of a resolution of the Senate passed on the\r\n25th instant, requesting me, if in my opinion not incompatible with the\r\npublic interest, to communicate to the Senate the dispatches of Major\r\nRobert Anderson to the War Department during the time he has been in\r\ncommand of Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nOn examining the correspondence thus called for I have, with the highest\r\nrespect for the Senate, come to the conclusion that at the present\r\nmoment the publication of it would be inexpedient.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the laws of the United States have been for some time past and\r\nnow are opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in the States of\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and\r\nTexas by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary\r\ncourse of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshals\r\nby law:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, in\r\nvirtue of the power in me vested by the Constitution and the laws, have\r\nthought fit to call forth, and hereby do call forth, the militia of the\r\nseveral States of the Union to the aggregate number of 75,000, in order\r\nto suppress said combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed.\r\n\r\nThe details for this object will be immediately communicated to the\r\nState authorities through the War Department.\r\n\r\nI appeal to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this effort\r\nto maintain the honor, the integrity, and the existence of our National\r\nUnion and the perpetuity of popular government and to redress wrongs\r\nalready long enough endured.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to say that the first service assigned to the forces\r\nhereby called forth will probably be to repossess the forts, places, and\r\nproperty which have been seized from the Union; and in every event the\r\nutmost care will be observed, consistently with the objects aforesaid,\r\nto avoid any devastation, any destruction of or interference with\r\nproperty, or any disturbance of peaceful citizens in any part of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby command the persons composing the combinations aforesaid to\r\ndisperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within twenty\r\ndays from this date.\r\n\r\nDeeming that the present condition of public affairs presents an\r\nextraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of the power in me vested\r\nby the Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress. Senators and\r\nRepresentatives are therefore summoned to assemble at their respective\r\nchambers at 12 o'clock noon on Thursday, the 4th day of July next, then\r\nand there to consider and determine such measures as, in their wisdom,\r\nthe public safety and interest may seem to demand.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 15th day of April, A.D. 1861, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas an insurrection against the Government of the United States has\r\nbroken out in the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and the laws of the United States for\r\nthe collection of the revenue can not be effectually executed therein\r\nconformably to that provision of the Constitution which requires duties\r\nto be uniform throughout the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas a combination of persons engaged in such insurrection have\r\nthreatened to grant pretended letters of marque to authorize the bearers\r\nthereof to commit assaults on the lives, vessels, and property of good\r\ncitizens of the country lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas\r\nand in waters of the United States; and\r\n\r\nWhereas an Executive proclamation has been already issued requiring the\r\npersons engaged in these disorderly proceedings to desist therefrom,\r\ncalling out a militia force for the purpose of repressing the same, and\r\nconvening Congress in extraordinary session to deliberate and determine\r\nthereon:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,\r\nwith a view to the same purposes before mentioned and to the protection\r\nof the public peace and the lives and property of quiet and orderly\r\ncitizens pursuing their lawful occupations, until Congress shall have\r\nassembled and deliberated on the said unlawful proceedings or until the\r\nsame shall have ceased, have further deemed it advisable to set on foot\r\na blockade of the ports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance of\r\nthe laws of the United States and of the law of nations in such case\r\nprovided. For this purpose a competent force will be posted so as to\r\nprevent entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. If,\r\ntherefore, with a view to violate such blockade, a vessel shall approach\r\nor shall attempt to leave either of the said ports, she will be duly\r\nwarned by the commander of one of the blockading vessels, who will\r\nindorse on her register the fact and date of such warning, and if the\r\nsame vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port\r\nshe will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port for such\r\nproceedings against her and her cargo as prize as may be deemed\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person, under the\r\npretended authority of the said States or under any other pretense,\r\nshall molest a vessel of the United States or the persons or cargo on\r\nboard of her, such person will be held amenable to the laws of the\r\nUnited States for the prevention and punishment of piracy.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 19th day of April, A.D. 1861, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  H. SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas, for the reasons assigned in my proclamation of the 19th\r\ninstant, a blockade of the ports of the States of South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas was ordered\r\nto be established; and\r\n\r\nWhereas since that date public property of the United States has been\r\nseized, the collection of the revenue obstructed, and duly commissioned\r\nofficers of the United States, while engaged in executing the orders of\r\ntheir superiors, have been arrested and held in custody as prisoners or\r\nhave been impeded in the discharge of their official duties, without due\r\nlegal process, by persons claiming to act under authorities of the\r\nStates of Virginia and North Carolina, an efficient blockade of the\r\nports of those States will also be established.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 27th day of April, A.D. 1861, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas existing exigencies demand immediate and adequate measures for\r\nthe protection of the National Constitution and the preservation of the\r\nNational Union by the suppression of the insurrectionary combinations\r\nnow existing in several States for opposing the laws of the Union and\r\nobstructing the execution thereof, to which end a military force in\r\naddition to that called forth by my proclamation of the 15th day of\r\nApril in the present year appears to be indispensably necessary:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States and\r\nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy thereof and of the militia of\r\nthe several States when called into actual service, do hereby call into\r\nthe service of the United States 42,034 volunteers to serve for the\r\nperiod of three years, unless sooner discharged, and to be mustered into\r\nservice as infantry and cavalry. The proportions of each arm and the\r\ndetails of enrollment and organization will be made known through the\r\nDepartment of War.\r\n\r\nAnd I also direct that the Regular Army of the United States be\r\nincreased by the addition of eight regiments of infantry, one regiment\r\nof cavalry, and one regiment of artillery, making altogether a maximum\r\naggregate increase of 22,714 officers and enlisted men, the details of\r\nwhich increase will also be made known through the Department of War.\r\n\r\nAnd I further direct the enlistment for not less than one or more than\r\nthree years of 18,000 seamen, in addition to the present force, for the\r\nnaval service of the United States. The details of the enlistment and\r\norganization will be made known through the Department of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe call for volunteers hereby made and the direction for the increase\r\nof the Regular Army and for the enlistment of seamen hereby given,\r\ntogether with the plan of organization adopted for the volunteer and for\r\nthe regular forces hereby authorized, will be submitted to Congress as\r\nsoon as assembled.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I earnestly invoke the cooperation of all good citizens\r\nin the measures hereby adopted for the effectual suppression of unlawful\r\nviolence, for the impartial enforcement of constitutional laws, and for\r\nthe speediest possible restoration of peace and order, and with these of\r\nhappiness and prosperity, throughout our country.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 3d day of May, A.D. 1861, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

The question has been submitted to and\r\nconsidered by me whether it would not be justifiable, upon the ground of\r\nnecessary defense, for you, as General in Chief of the United States\r\nArmy, to arrest or disperse the members of that body. I think it would\r\nnot be justifiable nor efficient for the desired object.\r\n\r\nFirst. They have a clearly legal right to assemble, and we can not know\r\nin advance that their action will not be lawful and peaceful, and if we\r\nwait until they shall have acted their arrest or dispersion will not\r\nlessen the effect of their action.\r\n\r\nSecondly. We can not permanently prevent their action. If we arrest\r\nthem, we can not long hold them as prisoners, and when liberated they\r\nwill immediately reassemble and take their action; and precisely the\r\nsame if we simply disperse them--they will immediately reassemble in\r\nsome other place.\r\n\r\nI therefore conclude that it is only left to the Commanding General to\r\nwatch and await their action, which, if it shall be to arm their people\r\nagainst the United States, he is to adopt the most prompt and efficient\r\nmeans to counteract, even, if necessary, to the bombardment of their\r\ncities and, in the extremest necessity, the suspension of the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nYou are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the\r\nUnited States. If at any point on or in the vicinity of any military\r\nline which is now or which shall be used between the city of\r\nPhiladelphia and the city of Washington you find resistance which\r\nrenders it necessary to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_ for the\r\npublic safety, you personally, or through the officer in command at the\r\npoint where resistance occurs, are authorized to suspend that writ.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at the city of\r\nWashington, this 27th day of April, 1861, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President of the United States:\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, April 30, 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe President directs that all officers of the Army, except those who\r\nhave entered the service since the 1st instant, take and subscribe anew\r\nthe oath of allegiance to the United States of America, as set forth in\r\nthe tenth article of war.\r\n\r\nCommanding officers will see to the prompt execution of this order, and\r\nreport accordingly.\r\n\r\nBy order:\r\n\r\nL. THOMAS,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To all who shall see these presents, greeting_:\r\n\r\nKnow ye that, reposing special trust and confidence in the patriotism,\r\nvalor, fidelity, and ability of Colonel Robert Anderson, United States\r\nArmy, I have empowered him, and do hereby empower him, to receive into\r\nthe Army of the United States as many regiments of volunteer troops from\r\nthe State of Kentucky and from the western part of the State of Virginia\r\nas shall be willing to engage in the service of the United States for\r\nthe term of three years upon the terms and according to the plan\r\nproposed by the proclamation of May 3, 1861, and General Orders, No. 15,\r\nfrom the War Department, of May 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe troops whom he receives shall be on the same footing in every\r\nrespect as those of the like kind called for in the proclamation above\r\ncited, except that the officers shall be commissioned by the United\r\nStates. He is therefore carefully and diligently to discharge the duty\r\nhereby devolved upon him by doing and performing all manner of things\r\nthereunto belonging.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 7th day of May,\r\nA.D. 1861, and in the eighty-fifth year of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  SIMON CAMERON,\r\n    _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE DEPARTMENT, _June 20, 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe LIEUTENANT-GENERAL COMMANDING THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nYou or any officer you may designate will, in your discretion, suspend\r\nthe writ of _habeas corpus_ so far as may relate to Major Chase, lately\r\nof the Engineer Corps of the Army of the United States, now alleged to\r\nbe guilty of treasonable practices against this Government.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe COMMANDING GENERAL, ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nYou are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the\r\nUnited States. If at any point on or in the vicinity of any military\r\nline which is now or which shall be used between the city of New York\r\nand the city of Washington you find resistance which renders it\r\nnecessary to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_ for the public safety,\r\nyou personally, or through the officer in command at the point where\r\nresistance occurs, are authorized to suspend that writ.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at the city of\r\nWashington, this 2d day of July, A.D. 1861, and of the Independence of\r\nthe United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  H. SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving been convened on an extraordinary occasion, as authorized by the\r\nConstitution, your attention is not called to any ordinary subject of\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present Presidential term, four months ago, the\r\nfunctions of the Federal Government were found to be generally suspended\r\nwithin the several States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Florida, excepting only those of the\r\nPost-Office Department.\r\n\r\nWithin these States all the forts, arsenals, dockyards, custom-houses,\r\nand the like, including the movable and stationary property in and\r\nabout them, had been seized and were held in open hostility to this\r\nGovernment, excepting only Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Jefferson, on and\r\nnear the Florida coast, and Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, South\r\nCarolina. The forts thus seized had been put in improved condition,\r\nnew ones had been built, and armed forces had been organized and were\r\norganizing, all avowedly with the same hostile purpose.\r\n\r\nThe forts remaining in the possession of the Federal Government in\r\nand near these States were either besieged or menaced by warlike\r\npreparations, and especially Fort Sumter was nearly surrounded by\r\nwell-protected hostile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the\r\nbest of its own and outnumbering the latter as perhaps ten to one. A\r\ndisproportionate share of the Federal muskets and rifles had somehow\r\nfound their way into these States, and had been seized to be used\r\nagainst the Government. Accumulations of the public revenue lying within\r\nthem had been seized for the same object. The Navy was scattered in\r\ndistant seas, leaving but a very small part of it within the immediate\r\nreach of the Government. Officers of the Federal Army and Navy had\r\nresigned in great numbers, and of those resigning a large proportion had\r\ntaken up arms against the Government. Simultaneously and in connection\r\nwith all this the purpose to sever the Federal Union was openly avowed.\r\nIn accordance with this purpose, an ordinance had been adopted in each\r\nof these States declaring the States respectively to be separated from\r\nthe National Union. A formula for instituting a combined government of\r\nthese States had been promulgated, and this illegal organization, in the\r\ncharacter of Confederate States, was already invoking recognition, aid,\r\nand intervention from foreign powers.\r\n\r\nFinding this condition of things and believing it to be an imperative\r\nduty upon the incoming Executive to prevent, if possible, the\r\nconsummation of such attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice of\r\nmeans to that end became indispensable. This choice was made, and was\r\ndeclared in the inaugural address. The policy chosen looked to the\r\nexhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any stronger\r\nones. It sought only to hold the public places and property not already\r\nwrested from the Government and to collect the revenue, relying for the\r\nrest on time, discussion, and the ballot box. It promised a continuance\r\nof the mails at Government expense to the very people who were resisting\r\nthe Government, and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to\r\nany of the people or any of their rights. Of all that which a President\r\nmight constitutionally and justifiably do in such a case, everything was\r\nforborne without which it was believed possible to keep the Government\r\non foot.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March, the present incumbent's first full day in office,\r\na letter of Major Anderson, commanding at Fort Sumter, written on the\r\n28th of February and received at the War Department on the 4th of March,\r\nwas by that Department placed in his hands. This letter expressed the\r\nprofessional opinion of the writer that reenforcements could not be\r\nthrown into that fort within the time for his relief rendered necessary\r\nby the limited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding\r\npossession of the same, with a force of less than 20,000 good and\r\nwell-disciplined men. This opinion was concurred in by all the officers\r\nof his command, and their memoranda on the subject were made inclosures\r\nof Major Anderson's letter. The whole was immediately laid before\r\nLieutenant-General Scott, who at once concurred with Major Anderson in\r\nopinion. On reflection, however, he took full time, consulting with\r\nother officers, both of the Army and the Navy, and at the end of four\r\ndays came reluctantly, but decidedly, to the same conclusion as before.\r\nHe also stated at the same time that no such sufficient force was then\r\nat the control of the Government or could be raised and brought to\r\nthe ground within the time when the provisions in the fort would be\r\nexhausted. In a purely military point of view this reduced the duty\r\nof the Administration in the case to the mere matter of getting the\r\ngarrison safely out of the fort.\r\n\r\nIt was believed, however, that to so abandon that position under the\r\ncircumstances would be utterly ruinous; that the _necessity_ under which\r\nit was to be done would not be fully understood; that by many it would\r\nbe construed as a part of a _voluntary_ policy; that at home it would\r\ndiscourage the friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and go\r\nfar to insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that, in fact, it\r\nwould be our national destruction consummated. This could not be\r\nallowed. Starvation was not yet upon the garrison, and ere it would be\r\nreached _Fort Pickens_ might be reenforced. This last would be a clear\r\nindication of _policy_, and would better enable the country to accept\r\nthe evacuation of Fort Sumter as a military _necessity_. An order was\r\nat once directed to be sent for the landing of the troops from the\r\nsteamship _Brooklyn_ into Fort Pickens. This order could not go by land,\r\nbut must take the longer and slower route by sea. The first return news\r\nfrom the order was received just one week before the fall of Fort\r\nSumter. The news itself was that the officer commanding the _Sabine_,\r\nto which vessel the troops had been transferred from the _Brooklyn_,\r\nacting upon some _quasi_ armistice of the late Administration (and of\r\nthe existence of which the present Administration, up to the time the\r\norder was dispatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors to fix\r\nattention), had refused to land the troops. To now reenforce Fort\r\nPickens before a crisis would be reached at Fort Sumter was impossible,\r\nrendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named\r\nfort. In precaution against such a conjuncture the Government had a\r\nfew days before commenced preparing an expedition, as well adapted as\r\nmight be, to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition was intended to\r\nbe ultimately used or not, according to circumstances. The strongest\r\nanticipated case for using it was now presented, and it was resolved to\r\nsend it forward. As had been intended in this contingency, it was also\r\nresolved to notify the governor of South Carolina that he might expect\r\nan attempt would be made to provision the fort, and that if the attempt\r\nshould not be resisted there would be no effort to throw in men, arms,\r\nor ammunition without further notice, or in case of an attack upon the\r\nfort. This notice was accordingly given, whereupon the fort was attacked\r\nand bombarded to its fall, without even awaiting the arrival of the\r\nprovisioning expedition.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort Sumter was\r\nin no sense a matter of self-defense on the part of the assailants. They\r\nwell knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit\r\naggression upon them. They knew--they were expressly notified--that the\r\ngiving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was\r\nall which would on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by\r\nresisting so much, should provoke more. They knew that this Government\r\ndesired to keep the garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely\r\nto maintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from\r\nactual and immediate dissolution, trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to\r\ntime, discussion, and the ballot box for final adjustment; and they\r\nassailed and reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object--to drive\r\nout the visible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to\r\nimmediate dissolution. That this was their object the Executive well\r\nunderstood; and having said to them in the inaugural address, \"You can\r\nhave no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors,\" he took pains\r\nnot only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the case so\r\nfree from the power of ingenious sophistry as that the world should not\r\nbe able to misunderstand it. By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its\r\nsurrounding circumstances, that point was reached. Then and thereby the\r\nassailants of the Government began the conflict of arms, without a gun\r\nin sight or in expectancy to return their fire, save only the few in the\r\nfort, sent to that harbor years before for their own protection, and\r\nstill ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful. In this act,\r\ndiscarding all else, they have forced upon the country the distinct\r\nissue, \"Immediate dissolution or blood.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States.\r\nIt presents to the whole family of man the question whether a\r\nconstitutional republic, or democracy--a government of the people by the\r\nsame people--can or can not maintain its territorial integrity against\r\nits own domestic foes. It presents the question whether discontented\r\nindividuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to\r\norganic law in any case, can always, upon the pretenses made in this\r\ncase, or on any other pretenses, or arbitrarily without any pretense,\r\nbreak up their government, and thus practically put an end to free\r\ngovernment upon the earth. It forces us to ask, Is there in all\r\nrepublics this inherent and fatal weakness? Must a government of\r\nnecessity be too _strong_ for the liberties of its own people, or\r\ntoo _weak_ to maintain its own existence?\r\n\r\nSo viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war power\r\nof the Government and so to resist force employed for its destruction\r\nby force for its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe call was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying,\r\nsurpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation. Yet\r\nnone of the States commonly called slave States, except Delaware, gave a\r\nregiment through regular State organization. A few regiments have been\r\norganized within some others of those States by individual enterprise\r\nand received into the Government service. Of course the seceded States,\r\nso called (and to which Texas had been joined about the time of the\r\ninauguration), gave no troops to the cause of the Union. The border\r\nStates, so called, were not uniform in their action, some of them being\r\nalmost _for_ the Union, while in others, as Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, and Arkansas, the Union sentiment was nearly repressed and\r\nsilenced. The course taken in Virginia was the most remarkable, perhaps\r\nthe most important. A convention elected by the people of that State\r\nto consider this very question of disrupting the Federal Union was in\r\nsession at the capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell. To this body\r\nthe people had chosen a large majority of _professed_ Union men. Almost\r\nimmediately after the fall of Sumter many members of that majority went\r\nover to the original disunion minority, and with them adopted an\r\nordinance for withdrawing the State from the Union. Whether this change\r\nwas wrought by their great approval of the assault upon Sumter or their\r\ngreat resentment at the Government's resistance to that assault is not\r\ndefinitely known. Although they submitted the ordinance for ratification\r\nto a vote of the people, to be taken on a day then somewhat more than\r\na month distant, the convention and the legislature (which was also in\r\nsession at the same time and place), with leading men of the State not\r\nmembers of either, immediately commenced acting as if the State were\r\nalready out of the Union. They pushed military preparations vigorously\r\nforward all over the State. They seized the United States armory\r\nat Harpers Ferry and the navy-yard at Gosport, near Norfolk. They\r\nreceived--perhaps invited--into their State large bodies of troops,\r\nwith their warlike appointments, from the so-called seceded States.\r\nThey formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance and\r\ncooperation with the so-called \"Confederate States,\" and sent members\r\nto their congress at Montgomery; and, finally, they permitted the\r\ninsurrectionary government to be transferred to their capital at Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make\r\nits nest within her borders, and this Government has no choice left but\r\nto deal with it _where_ it finds it; and it has the less regret, as the\r\nloyal citizens have in due form claimed its protection. Those loyal\r\ncitizens this Government is bound to recognize and protect, as being\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nIn the border States, so called--in fact, the Middle States--there are\r\nthose who favor a policy which they call \"armed neutrality;\" that is,\r\nan arming of those States to prevent the Union forces passing one way\r\nor the disunion the other over their soil. This would be disunion\r\ncompleted. Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an\r\nimpassable wall along the line of separation, and yet not quite an\r\nimpassable one, for, under the guise of neutrality, it would tie the\r\nhands of the Union men and freely pass supplies from among them to the\r\ninsurrectionists, which it could not do as an open enemy. At a stroke it\r\nwould take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only what\r\nproceeds from the external blockade. It would do for the disunionists\r\nthat which of all things they most desire--feed them well and give them\r\ndisunion without a struggle of their own. It recognizes no fidelity to\r\nthe Constitution, no obligation to maintain the Union; and while very\r\nmany who have favored it are doubtless loyal citizens, it is,\r\nnevertheless, very injurious in effect.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the action of the Government, it may be stated that at\r\nfirst a call was made for 75,000 militia, and rapidly following this a\r\nproclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary\r\ndistricts by proceedings in the nature of blockade. So far all was\r\nbelieved to be strictly legal. At this point the insurrectionists\r\nannounced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering.\r\n\r\nOther calls were made for volunteers to serve three years unless sooner\r\ndischarged, and also for large additions to the Regular Army and Navy.\r\nThese measures, whether strictly legal or not, were ventured upon under\r\nwhat appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity, trusting\r\nthen, as now, that Congress would readily ratify them. It is believed\r\nthat nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nSoon after the first call for militia it was considered a duty to\r\nauthorize the Commanding General in proper cases, according to his\r\ndiscretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_,\r\nor, in other words, to arrest and detain without resort to the ordinary\r\nprocesses and forms of law such individuals as he might deem dangerous\r\nto the public safety. This authority has purposely been exercised but\r\nvery sparingly. Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has\r\nbeen done under it are questioned, and the attention of the country has\r\nbeen called to the proposition that one who is sworn to \"take care that\r\nthe laws be faithfully executed\" should not himself violate them. Of\r\ncourse some consideration was given to the questions of power and\r\npropriety before this matter was acted upon. The whole of the laws which\r\nwere required to be faithfully executed were being resisted and failing\r\nof execution in nearly one-third of the States. Must they be allowed to\r\nfinally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear that by the\r\nuse of the means necessary to their execution some single law, made in\r\nsuch extreme tenderness of the citizen's liberty that practically it\r\nrelieves more of the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very\r\nlimited extent be violated? To state the question more directly, Are\r\nall the laws _but one_ to go unexecuted, and the Government itself go\r\nto pieces lest that one be violated? Even in such a case, would not the\r\nofficial oath be broken if the Government should be overthrown when it\r\nwas believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it?\r\nBut it was not believed that this question was presented. It was not\r\nbelieved that any law was violated. The provision of the Constitution\r\nthat \"the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ shall not be\r\nsuspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public\r\nsafety may require it\" is equivalent to a provision--is a\r\nprovision--that such privilege may be suspended when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety _does_ require it. It was\r\ndecided that we have a case of rebellion and that the public safety does\r\nrequire the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was\r\nauthorized to be made. Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the\r\nExecutive, is vested with this power; but the Constitution itself is\r\nsilent as to which or who is to exercise the power; and as the provision\r\nwas plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it can not be believed the\r\nframers of the instrument intended that in every case the danger should\r\nrun its course until Congress could be called together, the very\r\nassembling of which might be prevented, as was intended in this case,\r\nby the rebellion.\r\n\r\nNo more extended argument is now offered, as an opinion at some length\r\nwill probably be presented by the Attorney-General. Whether there shall\r\nbe any legislation upon the subject, and, if any, what, is submitted\r\nentirely to the better judgment of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe forbearance of this Government had been so extraordinary and so long\r\ncontinued as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if\r\nthey supposed the early destruction of our National Union was probable.\r\nWhile this on discovery gave the Executive some concern, he is now happy\r\nto say that the sovereignty and rights of the United States are now\r\neverywhere practically respected by foreign powers, and a general\r\nsympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Navy will\r\ngive the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient for your\r\ndeliberation and action, while the Executive and all the Departments\r\nwill stand ready to supply omissions or to communicate new facts\r\nconsidered important for you to know.\r\n\r\nIt is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this\r\ncontest a short and a decisive one; that you place at the control of the\r\nGovernment for the work at least 400,000 men and $400,000,000. That\r\nnumber of men is about one-tenth of those of proper ages within the\r\nregions where apparently _all_ are willing to engage, and the sum is\r\nless than a twenty-third part of the money value owned by the men who\r\nseem ready to devote the whole. A debt of $600,000,000 _now_ is a less\r\nsum per head than was the debt of our Revolution when we came out of\r\nthat struggle, and the money value in the country now bears even a\r\ngreater proportion to what it was _then_ than does the population.\r\nSurely each man has as strong a motive _now_ to _preserve_ our liberties\r\nas each had _then_ to _establish_ them.\r\n\r\nA right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten\r\ntimes the men and ten times the money. The evidence reaching us from the\r\ncountry leaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant, and\r\nthat it needs only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction and\r\nthe hand of the Executive to give it practical shape and efficiency. One\r\nof the greatest perplexities of the Government is to avoid receiving\r\ntroops faster than it can provide for them. In a word, the people will\r\nsave their Government if the Government itself will do its part only\r\nindifferently well.\r\n\r\nIt might seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the\r\npresent movement at the South be called \"secession\" or \"rebellion.\" The\r\nmovers, however, well understand the difference. At the beginning they\r\nknew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude\r\nby any name which implies _violation_ of law. They knew their people\r\npossessed as much of moral sense, as much of devotion to law and order,\r\nand as much pride in and reverence for the history and Government of\r\ntheir common country as any other civilized and patriotic people. They\r\nknew they could make no advancement directly in the teeth of these\r\nstrong and noble sentiments. Accordingly, they commenced by an insidious\r\ndebauching of the public mind. They invented an ingenious sophism,\r\nwhich, if conceded, was followed by perfectly logical steps through all\r\nthe incidents to the complete destruction of the Union. The sophism\r\nitself is that any State of the Union may _consistently_ with the\r\nNational Constitution, and therefore _lawfully_ and _peacefully_,\r\nwithdraw from the Union without the consent of the Union or of any other\r\nState. The little disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised\r\nonly for just cause, themselves to be the sole judge of its justice,\r\nis too thin to merit any notice.\r\n\r\nWith rebellion thus sugar coated they have been drugging the public mind\r\nof their section for more than thirty years, and until at length they\r\nhave brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against the\r\nGovernment the day _after_ some assemblage of men have enacted the\r\nfarcical pretense of taking their State out of the Union who could have\r\nbeen brought to no such thing the day _before_.\r\n\r\nThis sophism derives much, perhaps the whole, of its currency from the\r\nassumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining\r\nto a _State_--to each State of our Federal Union. Our States have\r\nneither more nor less power than that reserved to them in the Union by\r\nthe Constitution, no one of them ever having been a State _out_ of the\r\nUnion. The original ones passed into the Union even _before_ they cast\r\noff their British colonial dependence, and the new ones each came into\r\nthe Union directly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas; and\r\neven Texas, in its temporary independence, was never designated a State.\r\nThe new ones only took the designation of States on coming into the\r\nUnion, while that name was first adopted for the old ones in and by the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. Therein the \"United Colonies\" were declared\r\nto be \"free and independent States;\" but even then the object plainly\r\nwas not to declare their independence of _one another_ or of the\r\n_Union_, but directly the contrary, as their mutual pledge and their\r\nmutual action before, at the time, and afterwards abundantly show. The\r\nexpress plighting of faith by each and all of the original thirteen in\r\nthe Articles of Confederation, two years later, that the Union shall be\r\nperpetual is most conclusive. Having never been States, either in\r\nsubstance or in name, _outside_ of the Union, whence this magical\r\nomnipotence of \"State rights,\" asserting a claim of power to lawfully\r\ndestroy the Union itself? Much is said about the \"sovereignty\" of the\r\nStates, but the word even is not in the National Constitution, nor, as\r\nis believed, in any of the State constitutions. What is a \"sovereignty\"\r\nin the political sense of the term? Would it be far wrong to define it\r\n\"a political community without a political superior\"? Tested by this,\r\nno one of our States, except Texas, ever was a sovereignty; and even\r\nTexas gave up the character on coming into the Union, by which act she\r\nacknowledged the Constitution of the United States and the laws and\r\ntreaties of the United States made in pursuance of the Constitution to\r\nbe for her the supreme law of the land. The States have their status in\r\nthe Union, and they have no other legal status. If they break from this,\r\nthey can only do so against law and by revolution. The Union, and not\r\nthemselves separately, procured their independence and their liberty.\r\nBy conquest or purchase the Union gave each of them whatever of\r\nindependence and liberty it has. The Union is older than any of the\r\nStates, and, in fact, it created them as States. Originally some\r\ndependent colonies made the Union, and in turn the Union threw off their\r\nold dependence for them and made them States, such as they are. Not\r\none of them ever had a State constitution independent of the Union.\r\nOf course it is not forgotten that all the new States framed their\r\nconstitutions before they entered the Union, nevertheless dependent\r\nupon and preparatory to coming into the Union.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the States have the powers and rights reserved to them\r\nin and by the National Constitution; but among these surely are not\r\nincluded all conceivable powers, however mischievous or destructive, but\r\nat most such only as were known in the world at the time as governmental\r\npowers; and certainly a power to destroy the Government itself had never\r\nbeen known as a governmental--as a merely administrative power. This\r\nrelative matter of national power and State rights, as a principle, is\r\nno other than the principle of _generality_ and _locality_. Whatever\r\nconcerns the whole should be confided to the whole--to the General\r\nGovernment--while whatever concerns _only_ the State should be left\r\nexclusively to the State. This is all there is of original principle\r\nabout it. Whether the National Constitution in defining boundaries\r\nbetween the two has applied the principle with exact accuracy is not\r\nto be questioned. We are all bound by that defining without question.\r\n\r\nWhat is now combated is the position that secession is _consistent_ with\r\nthe Constitution--is _lawful_ and _peaceful_. It is not contended that\r\nthere is any express law for it, and nothing should ever be implied as\r\nlaw which leads to unjust or absurd consequences. The nation purchased\r\nwith money the countries out of which several of these States were\r\nformed. Is it just that they shall go off without leave and without\r\nrefunding? The nation paid very large sums (in the aggregate, I believe,\r\nnearly a hundred millions) to relieve Florida of the aboriginal tribes.\r\nIs it just that she shall now be off without consent or without making\r\nany return? The nation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit\r\nof these so-called seceding States in common with the rest. Is it just\r\neither that creditors shall go unpaid or the remaining States pay the\r\nwhole? A part of the present national debt was contracted to pay the old\r\ndebts of Texas. Is it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this\r\nherself?\r\n\r\nAgain: If one State may secede, so may another; and when all shall have\r\nseceded none is left to pay the debts. Is this quite just to creditors?\r\nDid we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their\r\nmoney? If we now recognize this doctrine by allowing the seceders to go\r\nin peace, it is difficult to see what we can do if others choose to go\r\nor to extort terms upon which they will promise to remain.\r\n\r\nThe seceders insist that our Constitution admits of secession. They\r\nhave assumed to make a national constitution of their own, in which\r\nof necessity they have either _discarded_ or _retained_ the right of\r\nsecession, as they insist it exists in ours. If they have discarded it,\r\nthey thereby admit that on principle it ought not to be in ours. If they\r\nhave retained it, by their own construction of ours they show that to be\r\nconsistent they must secede from one another whenever they shall find it\r\nthe easiest way of settling their debts or effecting any other selfish\r\nor unjust object. The principle itself is one of disintegration, and\r\nupon which no government can possibly endure.\r\n\r\nIf all the States save one should assert the power to _drive_ that one\r\nout of the Union, it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians\r\nwould at once deny the power and denounce the act as the greatest\r\noutrage upon State rights. But suppose that precisely the same act,\r\ninstead of being called \"driving the one out,\" should be called \"the\r\nseceding of the others from that one,\" it would be exactly what the\r\nseceders claim to do, unless, indeed, they make the point that the one,\r\nbecause it is a minority, may rightfully do what the others, because\r\nthey are a majority, may not rightfully do. These politicians are subtle\r\nand profound on the rights of minorities. They are not partial to that\r\npower which made the Constitution and speaks from the preamble, calling\r\nitself \"we, the people.\"\r\n\r\nIt may well be questioned whether there is to-day a majority of the\r\nlegally qualified voters of any State, except, perhaps, South Carolina,\r\nin favor of disunion. There is much reason to believe that the Union men\r\nare the majority in many, if not in every other one, of the so-called\r\nseceded States. The contrary has not been demonstrated in any one of\r\nthem. It is ventured to affirm this even of Virginia and Tennessee; for\r\nthe result of an election held in military camps, where the bayonets are\r\nall on one side of the question voted upon, can scarcely be considered\r\nas demonstrating popular sentiment. At such an election all that large\r\nclass who are at once, _for_ the Union and _against_ coercion would be\r\ncoerced to vote against the Union.\r\n\r\nIt may be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we\r\nenjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole\r\npeople beyond any example in the world. Of this we now have a striking\r\nand an impressive illustration. So large an army as the Government has\r\nnow on foot was never before known without a soldier in it but who had\r\ntaken his place there of his own free choice. But more than this, there\r\nare many single regiments whose members, one and another, possess full\r\npractical knowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions, and whatever\r\nelse, whether useful or elegant, is known in the world; and there is\r\nscarcely one from which there could not be selected a President, a\r\nCabinet, a Congress, and perhaps a court, abundantly competent to\r\nadminister the Government itself. Nor do I say this is not true also in\r\nthe army of our late friends, now adversaries in this contest; but if\r\nit is, so much better the reason why the Government which has conferred\r\nsuch benefits on both them and us should not be broken up. Whoever in\r\nany section proposes to abandon such a government would do well to\r\nconsider in deference to what principle it is that he does it; what\r\nbetter he is likely to get in its stead; whether the substitute will\r\ngive, or be intended to give, so much of good to the people. There are\r\nsome foreshadowings on this subject. Our adversaries have adopted some\r\ndeclarations of independence in which, unlike the good old one penned by\r\nJefferson, they omit the words \"all men are created equal.\" Why? They\r\nhave adopted a temporary national constitution, in the preamble of\r\nwhich, unlike our good old one signed by Washington, they omit \"We,\r\nthe people,\" and substitute \"We, the deputies of the sovereign and\r\nindependent States.\" Why? Why this deliberate pressing out of view\r\nthe rights of men and the authority of the people?\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a people's contest. On the side of the Union it\r\nis a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of\r\ngovernment whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men;\r\nto lift artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the paths of\r\nlaudable pursuit for all; to afford all an unfettered start and a\r\nfair chance in the race of life. Yielding to partial and temporary\r\ndepartures, from necessity, this is the leading object of the Government\r\nfor whose existence we contend.\r\n\r\nI am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and\r\nappreciate this. It is worthy of note that while in this the\r\nGovernment's hour of trial large numbers of those in the Army and Navy\r\nwho have been favored with the offices have resigned and proved false\r\nto the hand which had pampered them, not one common soldier or common\r\nsailor is known to have deserted his flag.\r\n\r\nGreat honor is due to those officers who remained true despite the\r\nexample of their treacherous associates; but the greatest honor and\r\nmost important fact of all is the unanimous firmness of the common\r\nsoldiers and common sailors. To the last man, so far as known, they\r\nhave successfully resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose\r\ncommands but an hour before they obeyed as absolute law. This is the\r\npatriotic instinct of plain people. They understand without an argument\r\nthat the destroying the Government which was made by Washington means\r\nno good to them.\r\n\r\nOur popular Government has often been called an experiment. Two points\r\nin it our people have already settled--the successful _establishing_ and\r\nthe successful _administering_ of it. One still remains--its successful\r\n_maintenance_ against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It\r\nis now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly\r\ncarry an election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the\r\nrightful and peaceful successors of bullets, and that when ballots have\r\nfairly and constitutionally decided there can be no successful appeal\r\nback to bullets; that there can be no successful appeal except to\r\nballots themselves at succeeding elections. Such will be a great lesson\r\nof peace, teaching men that what they can not take by an election\r\nneither can they take it by a war; teaching all the folly of being the\r\nbeginners of a war.\r\n\r\nLest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what is\r\nto be the course of the Government toward the Southern States _after_\r\nthe rebellion shall have been suppressed, the Executive deems it proper\r\nto say it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided by the\r\nConstitution and the laws, and that he probably will have no different\r\nunderstanding of the powers and duties of the Federal Government\r\nrelatively to the rights of the States and the people under the\r\nConstitution than that expressed in the inaugural address.\r\n\r\nHe desires to preserve the Government, that it may be administered\r\nfor all as it was administered by the men who made it. Loyal citizens\r\neverywhere have the right to claim this of their government, and the\r\ngovernment has no right to withhold or neglect it. It is not perceived\r\nthat in giving it there is any coercion, any conquest, or any\r\nsubjugation in any just sense of those terms.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides, and all the States have accepted the\r\nprovision, that \"the United States shall guarantee to every State in\r\nthis Union a republican form of government.\" But if a State may lawfully\r\ngo out of the Union, having done so it may also discard the republican\r\nform of government; so that to prevent its going out is an indispensable\r\n_means_ to the _end_ of maintaining the guaranty mentioned; and when an\r\nend is lawful and obligatory the indispensable means to it are also\r\nlawful and obligatory.\r\n\r\nIt was with the deepest regret that the Executive found the duty of\r\nemploying the war power in defense of the Government forced upon him.\r\nHe could but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the\r\nGovernment. No compromise by public servants could in this case be a\r\ncure; not that compromises are not often proper, but that no popular\r\ngovernment can long survive a marked precedent that those who carry an\r\nelection can only save the government from immediate destruction by\r\ngiving up the main point upon which the people gave the election. The\r\npeople themselves, and not their servants, can safely reverse their own\r\ndeliberate decisions.\r\n\r\nAs a private citizen the Executive could not have consented that these\r\ninstitutions shall perish; much less could he in betrayal of so vast and\r\nso sacred a trust as these free people had confided to him. He felt that\r\nhe had no moral right to shrink, nor even to count the chances of his\r\nown life, in what might follow. In full view of his great responsibility\r\nhe has so far done what he has deemed his duty. You will now, according\r\nto your own judgment, perform yours. He sincerely hopes that your views\r\nand your action may so accord with his as to assure all faithful\r\ncitizens who have been disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy\r\nrestoration to them under the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nAnd having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure purpose,\r\nlet us renew our trust in God and go forward without fear and with manly\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 11, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th\r\ninstant, requesting a copy of correspondence upon the subject of the\r\nincorporation of the Dominican Republic with the Spanish Monarchy, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of State, to whom the resolution\r\nwas referred.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 19, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of correspondence between the Secretary\r\nof State and Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary accredited to this Government, relative to an exhibition\r\nof the products of industry of all nations which is to take place at\r\nLondon in the course of next year. As citizens of the United States may\r\njustly pride themselves upon their proficiency in industrial arts, it is\r\ndesirable that they should have proper facilities toward taking part in\r\nthe exhibition. With this view I recommend such legislation by Congress\r\nat this session as may be necessary for that purpose.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 19, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its advice with a view to a formal\r\nexecution of the instrument, the draft of a treaty informally agreed\r\nupon between the United States and the Delaware tribe of Indians,\r\nrelative to certain lands of that tribe.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 19, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAs the United States have, in common with Great Britain and France,\r\na deep interest in the preservation and development of the fisheries\r\nadjacent to the northeastern coast and islands of this continent, it\r\nseems proper that we should concert with the Governments of those\r\ncountries such measures as may be conducive to those important objects.\r\nWith this view I transmit to Congress a copy of a correspondence between\r\nthe Secretary of State and the British minister here, in which the\r\nlatter proposes on behalf of his Government the appointment of a joint\r\ncommission to inquire into the matter, in order that such ulterior\r\nmeasures may be adopted as may be advisable for the objects proposed.\r\nSuch legislation is recommended as may be necessary to enable the\r\nExecutive to provide for a commissioner on behalf of the United States.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 25, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 22d\r\ninstant, requesting a copy of the correspondence between this Government\r\nand foreign powers with reference to maritime rights, I transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 25, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 15th\r\ninstant, requesting a copy of the correspondence between this Government\r\nand foreign powers on the subject of the existing insurrection in the\r\nUnited States, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 27, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 25th instant, relative\r\nto the instructions to the ministers of the United States abroad in\r\nreference to the rebellion now existing in the southern portion of the\r\nUnion, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 27, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 24th\r\ninstant, asking the grounds, reasons, and evidence upon which the police\r\ncommissioners of Baltimore were arrested and are now detained as\r\nprisoners at Fort McHenry, I have to state that it is judged to be\r\nincompatible with the public interest at this time to furnish the\r\ninformation called for by the resolution.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE, _July 29, 1861_.\r\n\r\nHon.

It certainly is competent for Congress to change this rule by law,\r\nbut it is respectfully suggested that a rule of so long standing and of so\r\nextensive application should not be hastily changed, nor by any authority\r\nless than the full lawmaking power.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _August 2, 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the resolution of\r\nthe Senate of the 31st ultimo, in relation to the recent nominations of\r\nlieutenants of marines, which nominations were directed to \"be returned\r\nto the President and he be informed that the Senate adhere to the\r\nopinion expressed in the resolution passed by them on the 19th of July\r\ninstant, and that the Senate are of opinion that rank and position in\r\nthe Army, Navy, or Marine Corps should not be decided by lot, but that,\r\nall other things being equal, preference should be given to age.\"\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly the resolution of the Senate, it is an\r\nexpression of opinion on the part of that body against the Army\r\nRegulations, which are made applicable to the Marine Corps--regulations\r\nthat have been in existence almost from the commencement of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn the published edition of Army Regulations when Mr. Calhoun was\r\nSecretary of War, section 1, article 3, it is expressly stated that the\r\nquestions respecting the rank of officers arising from the sameness of\r\ndates in commissions of the same grade shall be decided, first, by a\r\nreference to the relative rank of the parties in the regular forces\r\n(including the United States Marine Corps) at the time the present\r\nappointments or promotions were made; second, by reference to former\r\nrank therein taken away by derangement or disbandment; third, by\r\nreference to former rank therein given up by resignation; fourth, by\r\nlottery.\r\n\r\nAnd in the last edition of Army Regulations, before me, published in\r\n1857, it is specified in article 2, section 5, that \"when commissions\r\nare of the same date the rank is to be decided between officers of the\r\nsame regiment or corps by the order of appointment; between officers of\r\ndifferent regiments or corps, first, by rank in actual service when\r\nappointed; second, by former rank and service in the Army or Marine\r\nCorps; third, by lottery among such as have not been in the military\r\nservice of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe rule here laid down governed in the appointment of the lieutenants\r\nof marines who have been nominated the present session to the Senate.\r\nTheir order of rank was determined by lottery, agreeably to the\r\npublished Army Regulations, and applied by those regulations\r\nspecifically to the Marine Corps.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen thus appointed in conformity to regulations have been\r\nmustered into service and done duty under fire. One of the number has\r\nfallen in the rank and place assigned him according to those\r\nregulations, and to set them aside and make a new order in conflict with\r\nthe regulations will, I apprehend, be deemed, if not _ex post facto_,\r\nalmost invidious.\r\n\r\nIn this matter the Department has no feeling, but it is desirable that\r\nit should be distinctly settled whether hereafter the Army Regulations\r\nare to govern in the question of rank in the Marine Corps or whether\r\nthey are to be set aside by resolution of the Senate.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return the papers and subscribe myself, very\r\nrespectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nGIDEON WELLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 5, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of your honorable body of date July 31,\r\n1861, requesting the President to inform the Senate whether the Hon.\r\nJames H. Lane, a member of that body from Kansas, has been appointed a\r\nbrigadier-general in the Army of the United States, and, if so, whether\r\nhe has accepted such appointment, I have the honor to transmit herewith\r\ncertain papers, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which taken together\r\nexplain themselves, and which contain all the information I possess upon\r\nthe questions propounded.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention, as shown by my letter of June 20, 1861, to appoint\r\nHon. James H. Lane, of Kansas, a brigadier-general of United States\r\nVolunteers, in anticipation of the act of Congress since passed for\r\nraising such volunteers; and I have no further knowledge upon the\r\nsubject except as derived from the papers herewith inclosed.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas a joint committee of both Houses of Congress has waited on the\r\nPresident of the United States and requested him to \"recommend a day of\r\npublic humiliation, prayer, and fasting to be observed by the people of\r\nthe United States with religious solemnities and the offering of fervent\r\nsupplications to Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these\r\nStates, His blessings on their arms, and a speedy restoration of peace;\"\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas it is fit and becoming in all people at all times to acknowledge\r\nand revere the supreme government of God, to bow in humble submission to\r\nHis chastisements, to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions\r\nin the full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of\r\nwisdom, and to pray with all fervency and contrition for the pardon of\r\ntheir past offenses and for a blessing upon their present and\r\nprospective action; and\r\n\r\nWhereas when our own beloved country, once, by the blessing of God,\r\nunited, prosperous, and happy, is now afflicted with faction and civil\r\nwar, it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this\r\nterrible visitation, and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and\r\ncrimes as a nation and as individuals to humble ourselves before Him and\r\nto pray for His mercy--to pray that we may be spared further punishment,\r\nthough most justly deserved; that our arms may be blessed and made\r\neffectual for the reestablishment of law, order, and peace throughout\r\nthe wide extent of our country; and that the inestimable boon of civil\r\nand religious liberty, earned under His guidance and blessing by the\r\nlabors and sufferings of our fathers, may be restored in all its\r\noriginal excellence:\r\n\r\nTherefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do appoint\r\nthe last Thursday in September next as a day of humiliation, prayer, and\r\nfasting for all the people of the nation. And I do earnestly recommend\r\nto all the people, and especially to all ministers and teachers of\r\nreligion of all denominations and to all heads of families, to observe\r\nand keep that day according to their several creeds and modes of worship\r\nin all humility and with all religious solemnity, to the end that the\r\nunited prayer of the nation may ascend to the Throne of Grace and bring\r\ndown plentiful blessings upon our country.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed, this 12th day of August, A.D. 1861, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

The\r\nheadquarters of the Army will be established in the city of Washington.\r\nAll communications intended for the Commanding General will hereafter be\r\naddressed direct to the Adjutant-General. The duplicate returns, orders,\r\nand other papers heretofore sent to the Assistant Adjutant-General,\r\nHeadquarters of the Army, will be discontinued.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nL. THOMAS,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, November 5, 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the State of Missouri, acting under the direction of the\r\nconvention of that State, proposes to the Government of the United\r\nStates that he will raise a military force, to serve within the State as\r\nState militia during the war there, to cooperate with the troops in the\r\nservice of the United States in repelling the invasion of the State and\r\nsuppressing rebellion therein; the said State militia to be embodied and\r\nto be held in the camp and in the field, drilled, disciplined, and\r\ngoverned according to the Army Regulations and subject to the Articles\r\nof War; the said State militia not to be ordered out of the State except\r\nfor the immediate defense of the State of Missouri, but to cooperate\r\nwith the troops in the service of the United States in military\r\noperations within the State or necessary to its defense, and when\r\nofficers of the State militia act with officers in the service of the\r\nUnited States of the same grade the officers of the United States\r\nservice shall command the combined force; the State militia to be armed,\r\nequipped, clothed, subsisted, transported, and paid by the United States\r\nduring such time as they shall be actually engaged as an embodied\r\nmilitary force in service in accordance with Regulations of the United\r\nStates Army or general orders as issued from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn order that the Treasury of the United States may not be burdened\r\nwith the pay of unnecessary officers, the governor proposes that,\r\nalthough the State law requires him to appoint upon the general staff\r\nan adjutant-general, a commissary-general, an inspector-general,\r\na quartermaster-general, a paymaster-general, and a surgeon-general,\r\neach with the rank of colonel of cavalry, yet he proposes that the\r\nGovernment of the United States pay only the adjutant-general, the\r\nquartermaster-general, and inspect or-general, their services being\r\nnecessary in the relations which would exist between the State militia\r\nand the United States. The governor further proposes that, while he is\r\nallowed by the State law to appoint aids-de-camp to the governor at his\r\ndiscretion, with the rank of colonel, three only shall be reported to\r\nthe United States for payment. He also proposes that the State militia\r\nshall be commanded by a single major-general and by such number of\r\nbrigadier-generals as shall allow one for a brigade of not less than\r\nfour regiments, and that no greater number of staff officers shall be\r\nappointed for regimental, brigade, and division duties than as provided\r\nfor in the act of Congress of the 22d July, 1861; and that, whatever\r\nbe the rank of such officers as fixed by the law of the State, the\r\ncompensation that they shall receive from the United States shall only\r\nbe that which belongs to the rank given by said act of Congress to\r\nofficers in the United States service performing the same duties.\r\n\r\nThe field officers of a regiment in the State militia are one colonel,\r\none lieutenant-colonel, and one major, and the company officers are a\r\ncaptain, a first lieutenant, and a second lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe governor proposes that, as the money to be disbursed is the money of\r\nthe United States, such staff officers in the service of the United\r\nStates as may be necessary to act as disbursing officers for the State\r\nmilitia shall be assigned by the War Department for that duty; or, if\r\nsuch can not be spared from their present duty, he will appoint such\r\npersons disbursing officers for the State militia as the President of\r\nthe United States may designate. Such regulations as may be required, in\r\nthe judgment of the President, to insure regularity of returns and to\r\nprotect the United States from any fraudulent practices shall be\r\nobserved and obeyed by all in office in the State militia.\r\n\r\nThe above propositions are accepted on the part of the United States,\r\nand the Secretary of War is directed to make the necessary orders upon\r\nthe Ordnance, Quartermaster's, Commissary, Pay, and Medical departments\r\nto carry this agreement into effect. He will cause the necessary staff\r\nofficers in the United States service to be detailed for duty in\r\nconnection with the Missouri State militia, and will order them to make\r\nthe necessary provision in their respective offices for fulfilling this\r\nagreement. All requisitions upon the different officers of the United\r\nStates under this agreement to be made in substance in the same mode for\r\nthe Missouri State militia as similar requisitions are made for troops\r\nin the service of the United States; and the Secretary of War will cause\r\nany additional regulations that may be necessary to insure regularity\r\nand economy in carrying this agreement into effect to be adopted and\r\ncommunicated to the governor of Missouri for the government of the\r\nMissouri State militia.\r\n\r\n[Indorsement.]\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 6, 1861.\r\n\r\nThis plan approved, with the modification that the governor stipulates\r\nthat when he commissions a major-general of militia it shall be the same\r\nperson at the time in command of the United States Department of the\r\nWest; and in case the United States shall change such commander of the\r\ndepartment, he (the governor) will revoke the State commission given to\r\nthe person relieved and give one to the person substituted to the United\r\nStates command of said department.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 96.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, November 7, 1861_.\r\n\r\nAuthority to raise a force of State militia, to serve during the war, is\r\ngranted, by direction of the President, to the governor of Missouri.\r\nThis force is to cooperate with the troops in the service of the United\r\nStates in repelling the invasion of the State of Missouri and in\r\nsuppressing rebellion therein. It is to be held, in camp and in the\r\nfield, drilled, disciplined, and governed according to the Regulations\r\nof the United States Army and subject to the Articles of War; but it is\r\nnot to be ordered out of the State of Missouri except for the immediate\r\ndefense of the said State.\r\n\r\nThe State forces thus authorized will be, during such time as they shall\r\nbe actually engaged as an embodied military force in active service,\r\narmed, equipped, clothed, subsisted, transported, and paid by the United\r\nStates in accordance with the Regulations of the United States Army and\r\nsuch orders as may from time to time be issued from the War Department,\r\nand in no other manner; and they shall be considered as disbanded from\r\nthe service of the United States whenever the President may so direct.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this force the governor is authorized to appoint the\r\nfollowing officers, who will be recognized and paid by the United\r\nStates, to wit: One major-general, to command the whole of the State\r\nforces brought into service, who shall be the same person appointed by\r\nthe President to command the United States Military Department of the\r\nWest, and shall retain his commission as major-general of the State\r\nforces only during his command of the said department; one\r\nadjutant-general, one inspector-general, and one quartermaster-general,\r\neach with the rank and pay of a colonel of cavalry; three aids-de-camp\r\nto the governor, each with the rank and pay of a colonel of infantry;\r\nbrigadier-generals at the rate of one to a brigade of not less than four\r\nregiments; and division, brigade, and regimental staff officers not to\r\nexceed in numbers those provided for in the organization prescribed by\r\nthe act approved July 22, 1861, \"for the employment of volunteers,\" nor\r\nto be more highly compensated by the United States, whatever their\r\nnominal rank in the State service, than officers performing the same\r\nduties under that act.\r\n\r\nThe field officers of a regiment to be one colonel, one\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and one major, and the officers of a company to be\r\none captain, one first and one second lieutenant.\r\n\r\nWhen officers of the said State forces shall act in conjunction with\r\nofficers of the United States Army of the same grade, the latter shall\r\ncommand the combined force.\r\n\r\nAll disbursements of money made to these troops or in consequence of\r\ntheir employment by the United States shall be made by disbursing\r\nofficers of the United States Army, assigned by the War Department, or\r\nspecially appointed by the President for that purpose, who will make\r\ntheir requisitions upon the different supply departments in the same\r\nmanner for the Missouri State forces as similar requisitions are made\r\nfor other volunteer troops in the service of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will cause any additional regulations that may be\r\nnecessary for the purpose of promoting economy, insuring regularity of\r\nreturns, and protecting the United States from fraudulent practices to\r\nbe adopted and published for the government of the said State forces,\r\nand the same will be obeyed and observed by all in office under the\r\nauthority of the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\nBy order:\r\n\r\nJULIUS P. GARESCHE,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 100.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, November 16, 1861_.\r\n\r\nComplaint has been made to the President of the United States that\r\ncertain persons within the State of Virginia, in places occupied by the\r\nforces of the United States, claim to be incumbents of civil\r\noffices--State, county, and municipal--by alleged authority from the\r\nCommonwealth of Virginia, in disregard and violation of the \"declaration\r\nof the people of Virginia represented in convention at the city of\r\nWheeling, Thursday, June 13, 1861,\" and of the ordinances of said\r\nconvention, and of the acts of the general assembly held by authority of\r\nsaid convention.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore ordered, by direction of the President, that if any\r\nperson shall hereafter attempt within the State of Virginia, under the\r\nalleged authority of said Commonwealth, to exercise any official powers\r\nof a civil nature within the limits of any of the commands of the\r\noccupying forces of the United States, unless in pursuance of the\r\ndeclaration and ordinances of the convention assembled at Wheeling on\r\nthe 13th day of June, 1861, and the acts of the general assembly held by\r\nauthority of said convention, such attempt shall be treated as an act of\r\nhostility against the United States, and such person shall be taken into\r\nmilitary custody.\r\n\r\nCommanding officers are directed to enforce this order within their\r\nrespective commands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy command of Major-General McClellan:\r\n\r\nL. THOMAS,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, November 27, 1861_.\r\n\r\nThe municipal authorities of Washington and Georgetown, in this\r\nDistrict, having appointed to-morrow, the 28th instant, as a day of\r\nthanksgiving, the several Departments will on that occasion be closed,\r\nin order that the officers of the Government may partake in the\r\nceremonies.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 3, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn the midst of unprecedented political troubles we have cause of great\r\ngratitude to God for unusual good health and most abundant harvests.\r\n\r\nYou will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of\r\nthe times our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with\r\nprofound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nA disloyal portion of the American people have during the whole year\r\nbeen engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation\r\nwhich endures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect\r\nabroad, and one party, if not both, is sure sooner or later to invoke\r\nforeign intervention.\r\n\r\nNations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the\r\ncounsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, although\r\nmeasures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and\r\ninjurious to those adopting them.\r\n\r\nThe disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of\r\nour country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked\r\nabroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably\r\nexpected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to\r\nassume, that foreign nations in this case, discarding all moral, social,\r\nand treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most\r\nspeedy restoration of commerce, including especially the acquisition of\r\ncotton, those nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their\r\nobject more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the\r\npreservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign\r\nnations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite sure a\r\nsound argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim\r\nmore readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving\r\nencouragement to it.\r\n\r\nThe principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign\r\nnations to hostility against us, as already intimated, is the\r\nembarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw\r\nfrom the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as\r\nour domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that\r\nthe effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that one\r\nstrong nation promises more durable peace and a more extensive,\r\nvaluable, and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into\r\nhostile fragments.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states,\r\nbecause, whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity\r\nof our country and the stability of our Government mainly depend not\r\nupon them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of\r\nthe American people. The correspondence itself, with the usual\r\nreservations, is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nI venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and\r\nliberality toward foreign powers, averting causes of irritation and with\r\nfirmness maintaining our own rights and honor.\r\n\r\nSince, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other state,\r\nforeign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend\r\nthat adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public\r\ndefenses on every side. While under this general recommendation\r\nprovision for defending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind, I\r\nalso in the same connection ask the attention of Congress to our great\r\nlakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of\r\narms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, all at\r\nwell-selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the\r\nnational defense and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the\r\nSecretary of War, expressed in his report, upon the same general\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east Tennessee and\r\nwestern North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky and other\r\nfaithful parts of the Union by railroad. I therefore recommend, as a\r\nmilitary measure, that Congress provide for the construction of such\r\nroad as speedily as possible. Kentucky no doubt will cooperate, and\r\nthrough her legislature make the most judicious selection of a line. The\r\nnorthern terminus must connect with some existing railroad, and whether\r\nthe route shall be from Lexington or Nicholasville to the Cumberland\r\nGap, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in the direction of\r\nKnoxville, or on some still different line, can easily be determined.\r\nKentucky and the General Government cooperating, the work can be\r\ncompleted in a very short time, and when done it will be not only of\r\nvast present usefulness, but also a valuable permanent improvement,\r\nworth its cost in all the future.\r\n\r\nSome treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and\r\nhaving no grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate for their consideration.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt\r\na desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we have removed\r\nall obstructions from the way of this humane reform except such as are\r\nmerely of temporary and accidental occurrence.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the correspondence between Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's minister accredited to this Government and the Secretary of\r\nState relative to the detention of the British ship _Perthshire_ in June\r\nlast by the United States steamer _Massachusetts_ for a supposed breach\r\nof the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious\r\nmisapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we should\r\ncommit no belligerent act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by\r\npublic law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the\r\nreasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to\r\nCongress in December last in regard to the disposition of the surplus\r\nwhich will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American\r\ncitizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners\r\nunder the act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be\r\ndeemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect, I would\r\nsuggest that authority be given for investing the principal, over the\r\nproceeds of the surplus referred to, in good securities, with a view to\r\nthe satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against China\r\nas are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive\r\ntrade with that Empire.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 5th of August last Congress authorized the President\r\nto instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves\r\nagainst and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a\r\nsingle instance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive\r\nand valuable commerce in the Eastern seas especially, it seems to me\r\nthat it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing\r\nvessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of United States\r\nvessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts now established by\r\nlaw in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in the event that this\r\nshould not be objected to by the local authorities.\r\n\r\nIf any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding\r\nour recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and\r\nLiberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a\r\nnovel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I\r\nsubmit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for\r\nmaintaining a chargé d'affaires near each of those new States. It does\r\nnot admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured\r\nby favorable treaties with them.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury during the period which has elapsed since\r\nyour adjournment have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism\r\nof the people has placed at the disposal of the Government the large\r\nmeans demanded by the public exigencies; Much of the national loan has\r\nbeen taken by citizens of the industrial classes, whose confidence in\r\ntheir country's faith and zeal for their country's deliverance from\r\npresent peril have induced them to contribute to the support of the\r\nGovernment the whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes\r\npeculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action.\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1861, was $86,835,900.27, and the\r\nexpenditures for the same period, including payments on account of the\r\npublic debt, were $84,578,834.47, leaving a balance in the Treasury on\r\nthe 1st of July of $2,257,065.80. For the first quarter of the financial\r\nyear ending on the 30th of September, 1861, the receipts from all\r\nsources, including the balance of the 1st of July, were $102,532,509.27,\r\nand the expenses $98,239,733.09, leaving a balance on the 1st of\r\nOctober, 1861, of $4,292,776.18.\r\n\r\nEstimates for the remaining three quarters of the year and for the\r\nfinancial year 1863, together with his views of ways and means for\r\nmeeting the demands contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the\r\nexpenditures made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the\r\nresources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism\r\nwhich has thus far sustained the Government will continue to sustain it\r\ntill peace and union shall again bless the land.\r\n\r\nI respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for\r\ninformation respecting the numerical strength of the Army and for\r\nrecommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the\r\nwell-being of the various branches of the service intrusted to his care.\r\nIt is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people has proved\r\nequal to the occasion, and that the number of troops tendered greatly\r\nexceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call into the field.\r\n\r\nI refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make\r\nallusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our\r\ntroops and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire Army.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the Secretary for an organization of the militia\r\nupon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to the future\r\nsafety of the country, arid is commended to the serious attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe large addition to the Regular Army, in connection with the defection\r\nthat has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives\r\npeculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of\r\ncadets to the greatest capacity of the Military Academy.\r\n\r\nBy mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide chaplains\r\nfor hospitals occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my\r\nnotice, and I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of\r\nwhich, properly addressed, has been delivered to each of the persons,\r\nand at the dates respectively named and stated in a schedule, containing\r\nalso the form of the letter marked A, and herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated at the\r\ntimes respectively stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully\r\ntherein ever since. I therefore recommend that they be compensated at\r\nthe same rate as chaplains in the Army. I further suggest that general\r\nprovision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals, as well as with\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the\r\noperations of that branch of the service, the activity and energy which\r\nhave characterized its administration, and the results of measures to\r\nincrease its efficiency and power. Such have been the additions, by\r\nconstruction and purchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been\r\ncreated and brought into service since our difficulties commenced.\r\n\r\nBesides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever\r\nbefore assembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds\r\nwhich have increased our naval renown.\r\n\r\nI would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretary\r\nfor a more perfect organization of the Navy by introducing additional\r\ngrades in the service.\r\n\r\nThe present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the\r\nsuggestions submitted by the Department will, it is believed, if\r\nadopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to, promote harmony, and\r\nincrease the efficiency of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThere are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court--two by the\r\ndecease of Justices Daniel and McLean and one by the resignation of\r\nJustice Campbell. I have so far forborne making nominations to fill\r\nthese vacancies for reasons which I will now state. Two of the out-going\r\njudges resided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that if\r\nsuccessors were appointed in the same localities they could not now\r\nserve upon their circuits; and many of the most competent men there\r\nprobably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve, even\r\nhere, upon the Supreme bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the\r\nappointments northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the\r\nSouth on the return of peace; although I may remark that to transfer to\r\nthe North one which has heretofore been in the South would not, with\r\nreference to territory and population, be unjust.\r\n\r\nDuring the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean his\r\ncircuit grew into an empire--altogether too large for any one judge to\r\ngive the courts therein more than a nominal attendance--rising in\r\npopulation from 1,470,018 in 1830 to 6,151,405 in 1860.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial\r\nsystem. If uniformity was at all intended, the system requires that all\r\nthe States shall be accommodated with circuit courts, attended by\r\nSupreme judges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas,\r\nFlorida, Texas, California, and Oregon have never had any such courts.\r\nNor can this well be remedied without a change in the system, because\r\nthe adding of judges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodation\r\nof all parts of the country with circuit courts, would create a court\r\naltogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil,\r\nif it be one, will increase as new States come into the Union. Circuit\r\ncourts are useful or they are not useful. If useful, no State should be\r\ndenied them; if not useful, no State should have them. Let them be\r\nprovided for all or abolished as to all.\r\n\r\nThree modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an\r\nimprovement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of\r\nconvenient number in every event; then, first, let the whole country be\r\ndivided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme judges to serve in\r\na number of them corresponding to their own number, and independent\r\ncircuit judges be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, let the\r\nSupreme judges be relieved from circuit duties and circuit judges\r\nprovided for all the circuits; or, thirdly, dispense with circuit courts\r\naltogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the district courts\r\nand an independent Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nI respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present\r\ncondition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able\r\nto find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which\r\nconstantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of\r\nthem. Since the organization of the Government Congress has enacted some\r\n5,000 acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 6,000 closely\r\nprinted pages and are scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts\r\nhave been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their\r\nprovisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each\r\nother, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even\r\nthe best-informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law\r\nreally is.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as\r\nplain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass\r\nas may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the\r\nLegislature and the perspicuity of its language. This well done would, I\r\nthink, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist\r\nin the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the\r\npeople, by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible\r\nform the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties.\r\n\r\nI am informed by some whose opinions I respect that all the acts of\r\nCongress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be\r\nrevised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume (or at most two\r\nvolumes) of ordinary and convenient size; and I respectfully recommend\r\nto Congress to consider of the subject, and if my suggestion be approved\r\nto devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the\r\nattainment of the end proposed.\r\n\r\nOne of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the\r\nentire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means of\r\nadministering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing\r\nlaw. This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the insurgent States;\r\nand as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those\r\nStates the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are no courts nor\r\nofficers to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the\r\nenforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent\r\nStates, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims.\r\nSome have estimated it as high as $200,000,000, due in large part from\r\ninsurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making\r\ngreat sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have been urgently solicited to establish by\r\nmilitary power courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I\r\nhave thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the\r\nend proposed--the collection of the debts--was just and right in itself,\r\nbut because I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity\r\nin the unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress, I suppose,\r\nare equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole\r\nmatter to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devised for the\r\nadministration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and\r\nTerritories as may be under the control of this Government, whether by a\r\nvoluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power of our arms;\r\nthis, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary\r\nsubstitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be\r\nreestablished in peace.\r\n\r\nIt is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if\r\npossible, for the adjustment of claims against the Government,\r\nespecially in view of their increased number by reason of the war. It is\r\nas much the duty of Government to render prompt justice against itself\r\nin favor of citizens as it is to administer the same between private\r\nindividuals. The investigation and adjudication of claims in their\r\nnature belong to the judicial department. Besides, it is apparent that\r\nthe attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for some\r\ntime to come with great national questions. It was intended by the\r\norganization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of\r\nbusiness from the halls of Congress; but while the court has proved to\r\nbe an effective and valuable means of investigation, it in great degree\r\nfails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its\r\njudgments final.\r\n\r\nFully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I\r\ncommend to your careful consideration whether this power of making\r\njudgments final may not properly be given to the court, reserving the\r\nright of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such\r\nother provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary.\r\n\r\nI ask attention to the report of the Postmaster-General, the following\r\nbeing a summary statement of the condition of the Department:\r\n\r\nThe revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the\r\ntransportation of \"free mail matter,\" was $9,049,296.40, being about 2\r\nper cent less than the revenue for 1860.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures were $13,606,759.11, showing a decrease of more than 8\r\nper cent as compared with those of the previous year and leaving an\r\nexcess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of\r\n$4,557,462.71.\r\n\r\nThe gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at an\r\nincrease of 4 per cent on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to which\r\nshould be added the earnings of the Department in carrying free matter,\r\nviz, $700,000, making $9,383,000.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an\r\nestimated deficiency of $3,145,000 to be supplied from the Treasury in\r\naddition to the permanent appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this\r\nDistrict across the Potomac River at the time of establishing the\r\ncapital here was eminently wise, and consequently that the\r\nrelinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the State of\r\nVirginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the\r\nexpediency of regaining that part of the District and the restoration of\r\nthe original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the State of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying\r\ndocuments, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public\r\nbusiness pertaining to that Department. The depressing influences of the\r\ninsurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the Patent\r\nand General Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public\r\nlands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system\r\nonly about $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the\r\nSouthern States, while the interruptions to the business of the country\r\nand the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service\r\nhave obstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the\r\nNorthwest.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about\r\n$100,000, rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to\r\nmake it self-sustaining.\r\n\r\nThe demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the\r\ninsurrection. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the\r\ncasualties of the existing war, have already been made. There is reason\r\nto believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt\r\nof the bounty of the Government are in the ranks of the insurgent army\r\nor giving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has\r\ndirected a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons\r\nupon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize that\r\nofficer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the\r\npension rolls.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the Government with the Indian tribes have been greatly\r\ndisturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern\r\nsuperintendency and in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of\r\nKansas is in the possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The\r\nagents of the United States appointed since the 4th of March for this\r\nsuperintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while the most of\r\nthose who were in office before that time have espoused the\r\ninsurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the powers of agents by\r\nvirtue of commissions from the insurrectionists. It has been stated in\r\nthe public press that a portion of those Indians have been organized as\r\na military force and are attached to the army of the insurgents.\r\nAlthough the Government has no official information upon this subject,\r\nletters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by\r\nseveral prominent chiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to the United\r\nStates and expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troops to\r\nprotect them. It is believed that upon the repossession of the country\r\nby the Federal forces the Indians will readily cease all hostile\r\ndemonstrations and resume their former relations to the Government.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not a\r\ndepartment nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the\r\nGovernment. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so\r\nindependent in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted more from\r\nthe Government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether\r\nsomething more can not be given voluntarily with general advantage.\r\n\r\nAnnual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce,\r\nand manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical\r\nvalue to the country. While I make no suggestion as to details, I\r\nventure the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might\r\nprofitably be organized.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade\r\nhas been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of\r\ngratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of\r\nthis inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success.\r\nFive vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and\r\ncondemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in\r\nequipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the\r\npenalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of\r\nAfricans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of\r\noffense under our laws, the punishment of which is death.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created by the last\r\nCongress, have been organized, and civil administration has been\r\ninaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is\r\nconsidered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of\r\nthese new countries when the Federal officers arrived there.\r\n\r\nThe abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security\r\nand protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite\r\nto them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the\r\ncountry to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the\r\nlegislature of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the\r\npeople of the Territory. So far the authority of the United States has\r\nbeen upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the\r\nfuture. I commend their interests and defense to the enlightened and\r\ngenerous care of Congress.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of\r\nthe District of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of much\r\nsuffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no\r\nrepresentative in Congress that body should not overlook their just\r\nclaims upon the Government.\r\n\r\nAt your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the\r\nPresident to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of\r\nthe industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the\r\nindustry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862. I\r\nregret to say I have been unable to give personal attention to this\r\nsubject--a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively\r\nand intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world.\r\nThrough the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan or system\r\nhas been devised and partly matured, and which will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nUnder and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act to\r\nconfiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,\" approved August\r\n6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of\r\ncertain other persons have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter\r\nthus liberated are already dependent on the United States and must be\r\nprovided for in some way. Besides this, it is not impossible that some\r\nof the States will pass similar enactments for their own benefit\r\nrespectively, and by operation of which persons of the same class will\r\nbe thrown upon them for disposal. In such case I recommend that Congress\r\nprovide for accepting such persons from such States, according to some\r\nmode of valuation, in lieu, _pro tanto_, of direct taxes, or upon some\r\nother plan to be agreed on with such States respectively; that such\r\npersons, on such acceptance by the General Government, be at once deemed\r\nfree, and that in any event steps be taken for colonizing both classes\r\n(or the one first mentioned if the other shall not be brought into\r\nexistence) at some place or places in a climate congenial to them. It\r\nmight be well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already\r\nin the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be\r\nincluded in such colonization.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of\r\nterritory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be\r\nexpended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced the\r\nacquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question of\r\nconstitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The\r\npower was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the\r\npurchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great\r\nexpediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring\r\nterritory is to furnish homes for white men, this measure effects that\r\nobject, for the emigration of colored men leaves additional room for\r\nwhite men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the\r\nimportance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial\r\ngrounds than on providing room for population.\r\n\r\nOn this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with the\r\nacquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute\r\nnecessity--that without which the Government itself can not be\r\nperpetuated?\r\n\r\nThe war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted for\r\nsuppressing the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the\r\ninevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a\r\nviolent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore in\r\nevery case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union\r\nprominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all\r\nquestions which are not of vital military importance to the more\r\ndeliberate action of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of\r\nthe ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by\r\nproclamation the law of Congress enacted at the late session for closing\r\nthose ports.\r\n\r\nSo also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations of\r\nlaw, instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of Congress to\r\nconfiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law\r\nupon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly\r\nconsidered The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable\r\nmeans must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine that\r\nradical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the\r\ndisloyal, are indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration and the\r\nmessage to Congress at the late special session were both mainly devoted\r\nto the domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent\r\nwar have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or from the\r\nprinciples or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents.\r\n\r\nThe last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the\r\nassault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what has occurred\r\nsince may not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then is much\r\nbetter defined and more distinct now, and the progress of events is\r\nplainly in the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a\r\nstrong support from north of Mason and Dixon's line, and the friends of\r\nthe Union were not free from apprehension on the point. This, however,\r\nwas soon settled definitely, and on the right side. South of the line\r\nnoble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was made to\r\n_seem_ against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were\r\nburned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and we were many days\r\nat one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil\r\nto the capital. Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to\r\nthe Government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the\r\nUnion, and none to the enemy; and her people, at a regular election,\r\nhave sustained the Union by a larger majority and a larger aggregate\r\nvote than they ever before gave to any candidate or any question.\r\nKentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly and, I think,\r\nunchangeably ranged on the side of the Union, Missouri is comparatively\r\nquiet, and, I believe, can not again be overrun by the insurrectionists.\r\nThese three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, neither of which\r\nwould promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not\r\nless than 40,000 in the field for the Union, while of their citizens\r\ncertainly not more than a third of that number, and they of doubtful\r\nwhereabouts and doubtful existence, are in arms against us. After a\r\nsomewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes on the Union people of\r\nwestern Virginia, leaving them masters of their own country.\r\n\r\nAn insurgent force of about 1,500, for months dominating the narrow\r\npeninsular region constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton,\r\nand known as Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous\r\nparts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there have\r\nrenewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the old flag.\r\nThis leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac or east of the\r\nChesapeake.\r\n\r\nAlso we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the\r\nsouthern coast of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island (near Savannah),\r\nand Ship Island; and we likewise have some general accounts of popular\r\nmovements in behalf of the Union in North Carolina and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThese things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing\r\nsteadily and certainly southward.\r\n\r\nSince your last adjournment Lieutenant-General Scott has retired from\r\nthe head of the Army. During his long life the nation has not been\r\nunmindful of his merit; yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably, and\r\nbrilliantly he has served the country, from a time far back in our\r\nhistory, when few of the now living had been born, and thenceforward\r\ncontinually, I can not but think we are still his debtors. I submit,\r\ntherefore, for your consideration what further mark of recognition is\r\ndue to him, and to ourselves as a grateful people.\r\n\r\nWith the retirement of General Scott came the Executive duty of\r\nappointing in his stead a General in Chief of the Army. It is a\r\nfortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country was there, so\r\nfar as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be\r\nselected. The retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor\r\nof General McClellan for the position, and in this the nation seemed to\r\ngive a unanimous concurrence. The designation of General McClellan is\r\ntherefore in considerable degree the selection of the country as well as\r\nof the Executive, and hence there is better reason to hope there will be\r\ngiven him the confidence and cordial support thus by fair implication\r\npromised, and without which he can not with so full efficiency serve the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones, and\r\nthe saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is better\r\ndirected by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior ones at\r\nvariance and cross-purposes with each other.\r\n\r\nAnd the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged _can_\r\nhave none but a common end in view and _can_ differ only as to the\r\nchoice of means. In a storm at sea no one on board _can_ wish the ship\r\nto sink, and yet not unfrequently all go down together because too many\r\nwill direct and no single mind can be allowed to control.\r\n\r\nIt continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government--the\r\nrights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the\r\ngeneral tone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the\r\nabridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the\r\npeople of all right to participate in the selection of public officers\r\nexcept the legislative boldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove\r\nthat large control of the people in government is the source of all\r\npolitical evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible\r\nrefuge from the power of the people.\r\n\r\nIn my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made\r\nin favor of popular institutions, but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief\r\nattention. It is the effort to place _capital_ on an equal footing with,\r\nif not above, _labor_ in the structure of government. It is assumed that\r\nlabor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors\r\nunless some-body else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces\r\nhim to labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best\r\nthat capital shall _hire_ laborers, and thus induce them to work by\r\ntheir own consent, or _buy_ them and drive them to it without their\r\nconsent. Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all\r\nlaborers are either _hired_ laborers or what we call slaves. And\r\nfurther, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in\r\nthat condition for life.\r\n\r\nNow there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor\r\nis there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the\r\ncondition of a hired laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and all\r\ninferences from them are groundless.\r\n\r\nLabor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit\r\nof labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.\r\nLabor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher\r\nconsideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection\r\nas any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always\r\nwill be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits.\r\nThe error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within\r\nthat; relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor\r\nthemselves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for\r\nthem. A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others\r\nnor have others working for them. In most of the Southern States a\r\nmajority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor\r\nmasters, while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor\r\nhired. Men, with their families-wives, sons, and daughters--work for\r\nthemselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking\r\nthe whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the\r\none hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not\r\nforgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor\r\nwith capital; that is, they labor with their own hands and also buy or\r\nhire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and not a\r\ndistinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of\r\nthis mixed class.\r\n\r\nAgain, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any such\r\nthing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life.\r\nMany independent men everywhere in these States a few years back in\r\ntheir lives were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the\r\nworld labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools\r\nor land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and\r\nat length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and\r\ngenerous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to\r\nall, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to\r\nall. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up\r\nfrom poverty; none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have\r\nnot honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power\r\nwhich they already possess, and which if surrendered will surely be used\r\nto close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new\r\ndisabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost.\r\n\r\nFrom the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy\r\nyears, and we find our population at the end of the period eight times\r\nas great as it was at the beginning. The increase of those other things\r\nwhich men deem desirable has been even greater. We thus have at one view\r\nwhat the popular principle, applied to Government through the machinery\r\nof the States and the Union, has produced in a given time, and also what\r\nif firmly maintained it promises for the future. There are already among\r\nus those who if the Union be preserved will live to see it contain\r\n250,000,000. The struggle _of_ to-day is not altogether _for_ to-day; it\r\nis for a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence all the more\r\nfirm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have\r\ndevolved upon us.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in reply to\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives of the 31st July last,\r\nupon the subject of increasing and extending trade and commerce of the\r\nUnited States with foreign countries.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in reply to\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives of the 13th July last, in\r\nrelation to the correspondence between this Government and foreign\r\nnations respecting the rights of blockade, privateering, and the\r\nrecognition of the so-called Confederate States.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty between the United States of America and His\r\nMajesty the King of Hanover, concerning the abolition of the Stade or\r\nBrunshausen dues, signed at Berlin on the 6th November, 1861.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 9, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in reply to\r\nthe resolution of the House of the 4th instant, relative to the\r\nintervention of certain European powers in the affairs of Mexico.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, December 14, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of your honorable body \"that the\r\nPresident be requested to furnish to the Senate copies of the charges,\r\ntestimony, and finding of the recent court of inquiry in the case of\r\nColonel Dixon S.

Shaw Gregory,\r\nagent on the part of the United States, and the chiefs and headmen of\r\nthe Poncas tribe of Indians, being supplementary to the treaty with said\r\ntribe made on the 12th day of March, 1858.\r\n\r\nI also transmit a letter, dated the 4th instant, from the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior, inclosing a copy of a report of the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs of the 20th September, 1861, in relation to the subject.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 24, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress the accompanying copy of a correspondence between\r\nthe Secretary of State, the Spanish minister, and the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, concerning the case of the bark _Providencia_, a Spanish vessel\r\nseized on her voyage from Havana to New York by a steamer of the United\r\nStates Blockading Squadron and subsequently released. I recommend the\r\nappropriation of the amount of the award of the referee.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 24, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate a dispatch which has just been received from Mr.\r\nCorwin, our minister to Mexico. It communicates important information\r\nconcerning the war which is waged against Mexico by the combined powers\r\nof Spain, France, and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nMr. Corwin asks instructions by which to regulate his proceedings so as\r\nto save our national interests in the case of an adjustment of the\r\ndifficulties between the belligerents. I have heretofore submitted to\r\nthe Senate a request for its advice upon the question pending by treaty\r\nfor making a loan to Mexico, which Mr. Corwin thinks will in any case be\r\nexpedient. It seems to be my duty now to solicit an early action of the\r\nSenate upon the subject, to the end that I may cause such instructions\r\nto be given to Mr. Corwin as will enable him to act in the manner which,\r\nwhile it will most carefully guard the interests of our country, will at\r\nthe same time be most beneficial to Mexico.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 28, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of extradition concluded by Mr. Corwin with the\r\nMexican Government on the 11th of December last.\r\n\r\nI also submit a postal convention concluded by that gentleman at the\r\nsame time, and a copy of his dispatch of the 24th of the same month\r\nexplanatory of the provisions of both these instruments, and the reasons\r\nfor the nonratification by Mexico of the postal convention concluded in\r\nthis city on the 31st of July last and approved by the Senate on the 6th\r\nof August.\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter from the Postmaster-General to the Secretary of State\r\nin relation to Mr. Corwin's postal convention is also herewith\r\ncommunicated. The advice of the Senate as to the expediency of accepting\r\nthat convention as a substitute for the one of the 31st of July last is\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 31, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to the correspondence on the subject previously\r\ncommunicated, I transmit to Congress extracts from a dispatch of the\r\n20th ultimo from Mr. Adams, United States minister at London, to the\r\nSecretary of State, and a copy of an instruction from Earl Russell to\r\nLord Lyons of the 10th instant, relative to the removal of certain\r\ncitizens of the United States from the British mail steamer _Trent_ by\r\norder of the commander of the United States war steamer _San Jacinto_.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 4, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1861, provides--\r\n\r\n  That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the\r\n  retired list of the Navy for the command of squadrons and single ships\r\n  such officers as he may believe that the good of the service requires\r\n  to be thus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the\r\n  recommendation of the President of the United States they shall receive\r\n  a vote of thanks of Congress for their services and gallantry in action\r\n  against an enemy, be restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Samuel F. Du Pont, of the Navy, was\r\nnominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command\r\nof the squadron which recently rendered such important service to the\r\nUnion in the expedition to the coast of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence\r\nas an example, I cordially recommend that Captain Samuel F. Du Pont\r\nreceive a vote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry\r\ndisplayed in the capture of Forts Walker and Beauregard, commanding the\r\nentrance of Port Royal Harbor, on the 7th of November, 1861.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 7, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 5th instant, requesting\r\na communication of any recent correspondence relating to the\r\npresentation of American citizens to the Court of France, I transmit a\r\ncopy of a dispatch of the 14th ultimo from the United States minister at\r\nParis to the Secretary of State and of an instruction of Mr. Seward to\r\nMr. Dayton of the 3d instant.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a special treaty between the United\r\nStates and His Majesty the King of Hanover for the abolition of the\r\nStade dues, which was signed at Berlin on the 6th of November last. In\r\nthis treaty, already approved by the Senate and ratified on the part of\r\nthe United States, it is stipulated that the sums specified in Articles\r\nIII and IV to be paid to the Hanoverian Government shall be paid at\r\nBerlin on the day of the exchange of ratifications. I therefore\r\nrecommend that seasonable provision be made to enable the Executive to\r\ncarry this stipulation into effect.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 15, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1861, provides--\r\n\r\n  That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the\r\n  retired list of the Navy for the command of squadrons and single ships\r\n  such officers as he may believe that the good of the service requires to\r\n  be thus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the\r\n  recommendation of the President of the United States they shall receive\r\n  a vote of thanks of Congress for their services and gallantry in action\r\n  against an enemy, be restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Louis M. Goldsborough, of the Navy,\r\nwas nominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in\r\ncommand of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which recently\r\nrendered such important service to the Union in the expedition to the\r\ncoast of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence\r\nas an example, I cordially recommend that Captain Louis M. Goldsborough\r\nreceive a vote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry\r\ndisplayed in the combined attack of the forces commanded by him and\r\nBrigadier-General Burnside in the capture of Roanoke Island and the\r\ndestruction of rebel gunboats on the 7th, 8th, and 10th of February,\r\n1862.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States was last evening plunged into\r\naffliction by the death of a beloved child. The heads of the\r\nDepartments, in consideration of this distressing event, have thought it\r\nwould be agreeable to Congress and to the American people that the\r\nofficial and private buildings occupied by them should not be\r\nilluminated in the evening of the 22d instant.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n  S.P. CHASE.\r\n  EDWIN M. STANTON.\r\n  GIDEON WELLES.\r\n  CALEB B. SMITH.\r\n  M.

For\r\nthis reason I withdraw the nomination in this respect heretofore\r\nsubmitted to the Senate. It is hardly necessary to add that the\r\nnomination was made without any knowledge of it on his part.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a dispatch to the Secretary of State\r\nfrom the minister resident of the United States at Lisbon, concerning\r\nrecent measures which have been adopted by the Government of Portugal\r\nintended to encourage the growth and to enlarge the area of the culture\r\nof cotton in its African possessions.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the minister\r\nof His Majesty the King of Italy accredited to this Government, and a\r\ncopy of a note to that minister from the Secretary of State, relating to\r\nthe settlement of the question arising out of the capture and detention\r\nof certain citizens of the United States, passengers on board the\r\nBritish steamer _Trent_, by order of Captain Wilkes, of the United\r\nStates Navy.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a translation of a note addressed to the\r\nSecretary of State on the 1st instant by General P. A. Herran, envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the Granadian\r\nConfederation, with a translation of the communication accompanying that\r\nnote from the special commissioner of that Republic, together with a\r\ncopy of a letter from the special commissioner of the United States of\r\nthe 26th ultimo, under the convention of the 10th September, 1857,\r\nsetting forth the impracticability of disposing of the cases submitted\r\nto the joint commission now in session under the convention within the\r\nperiod prescribed therein.\r\n\r\nI recommend, therefore, that the Senate consent to the extension of time\r\nfor ---- days from and after the expiration of the time limited by the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a communication[4] of the Secretary of War,\r\ninclosing a report of the Adjutant-General, in answer to a resolution of\r\nthe House of Representatives of the 22d of January, 1862.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Relating to assignment of officers of the Army to duty.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 5, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for its consideration, a copy of a message\r\naddressed to that body by my immediate predecessor on the 12th February,\r\n1861, relating to the award made by the joint commission under the\r\nconvention between the United States and Paraguay of the 4th February,\r\n1859, together with the original \"journal of the proceedings\" of the\r\ncommission and a printed copy of the \"statements and arguments--and for\r\nthe Republic,\" and request the advice of the Senate as to the final\r\nacquiescence in or rejection of the award of the commissioner by the\r\nGovernment of the United States. As the \"journal\" is an original\r\ndocument, pertaining to the archives of the Department of State, it\r\nis proper, when the Senate shall have arrived at a conclusion on the\r\nsubject, that the volume be returned to the custody of the Secretary\r\nof State.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 6, 1862.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI recommend the adoption of a joint resolution by your honorable bodies,\r\nwhich shall be substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the United States ought to cooperate with any State\r\n  which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State\r\n  pecuniary aid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to\r\n  compensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such\r\n  change of system.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the\r\napproval of Congress and the country, there is the end; but if it does\r\ncommand such approval, I deem it of importance that the States and\r\npeople immediately interested should be at once distinctly notified of\r\nthe fact, so that they may begin to consider whether to accept or reject\r\nit. The Federal Government would find its highest interest in such a\r\nmeasure, as one of the most efficient means of self-preservation. The\r\nleaders of the existing insurrection entertain the hope that this\r\nGovernment will ultimately be forced to acknowledge the independence of\r\nsome part of the disaffected region, and that all the slave States north\r\nof such part will then say, \"The Union for which we have struggled being\r\nalready gone, we now choose to go with the Southern section.\" To deprive\r\nthem of this hope substantially ends the rebellion, and the initiation\r\nof emancipation completely deprives them of it as to all the States\r\ninitiating it. The point is not that _all_ the States tolerating slavery\r\nwould very soon, if at all, initiate emancipation; but that while the\r\noffer is equally made to all, the more northern shall by such initiation\r\nmake it certain to the more southern that in no event will the former\r\never join the latter in their proposed confederacy. I say \"initiation\"\r\nbecause, in my judgment, gradual and not sudden emancipation is better\r\nfor all. In the mere financial or pecuniary view any member of Congress\r\nwith the census tables and Treasury reports before him can readily see\r\nfor himself how very soon the current expenditures of this war would\r\npurchase, at fair valuation, all the slaves in any named State. Such a\r\nproposition on the part of the General Government sets up no claim of a\r\nright by Federal authority to interfere with slavery within State\r\nlimits, referring, as it does, the absolute control of the subject in\r\neach case to the State and its people immediately interested. It is\r\nproposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them.\r\n\r\nIn the annual message last December I thought fit to say \"the Union must\r\nbe preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed.\" I\r\nsaid this not hastily, but deliberately. War has been made and continues\r\nto be an indispensable means to this end. A practical reacknowledgment\r\nof the national authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would\r\nat once cease. If, however, resistance continues, the war must also\r\ncontinue; and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may\r\nattend and all the ruin which may follow it. Such as may seem\r\nindispensable or may obviously promise great efficiency toward ending\r\nthe struggle must and will come.\r\n\r\nThe proposition now made (though an offer only), I hope it may be\r\nesteemed no offense to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered\r\nwould not be of more value to the States and private persons concerned\r\nthan are the institution and property in it in the present aspect of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be\r\nmerely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is\r\nrecommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical\r\nresults. In full view of my great responsibility to my God and to my\r\ncountry, I earnestly beg the attention of Congress and the people to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _March 7, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the constitutional action of the Senate\r\nthereon, a treaty concluded at Paola, Kans., on the 18th day of August,\r\nbetween Seth Clover, commissioner on the part of the United States, and\r\nthe delegates of the united tribes of Kaskaskia and Peoria, Piankeshaw,\r\nand Wea Indians.\r\n\r\nI also transmit a communication of the Secretary of the Interior of the\r\n6th instant and accompanying papers from the Acting Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs, in relation to the subject.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 12, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 11th instant,\r\nrequesting \"a copy of any correspondence on the records or files of the\r\nDepartment of State in regard to railway systems in Europe,\" I transmit\r\na report from the Secretary of State and the papers by which it was\r\naccompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 14, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWith reference to my recent message on the subject of claims of citizens\r\nof the United States on the Government of Paraguay, I transmit a copy of\r\nthree memorials of the claimants and of their closing arguments in the\r\ncase, together with extracts from a dispatch from Mr. Bowlin, the late\r\ncommissioner of the United States to that country. These extracts show\r\nthat President Lopez offered and expected to pay a large sum of money as\r\na compromise of the claims.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 14, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress the accompanying copy of a correspondence between\r\nthe Secretary of State, the Danish chargé d'affaires, and the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, concerning the case of the bark _Jorgen Lorentzen_, a\r\nDanish vessel seized on her voyage from Rio Janeiro to Havana by the\r\nUnited States ship _Morning Light_ and subsequently released. I recommend\r\nthe appropriation of the amount of the award of the referees.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _March 20, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved December 21, 1861, provides--\r\n\r\n  That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the\r\n  retired list of the Navy for the command of squadrons and single ships\r\n  such officers as he may believe that the good of the service requires to\r\n  be thus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the\r\n  recommendation of the President of the United States they shall receive\r\n  a vote of thanks of Congress for their services and gallantry in action\r\n  against an enemy, be restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain Samuel F. Du Pont, of the Navy, was\r\nnominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command\r\nof the squadron which recently rendered such important service to the\r\nUnion in the expedition to the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence\r\nas an example, I cordially recommend that Captain Samuel F. Du Pont\r\nreceive a vote of thanks of Congress for his service and gallantry\r\ndisplayed in the capture since the 21st December, 1861, of various\r\npoints on the coasts of Georgia and Florida, particularly Brunswick,\r\nCumberland Island and Sound, Amelia Island, the towns of St. Marys, St.\r\nAugustine, and Jacksonville and Fernandina.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 26, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a communication[5] of the 21st of December last\r\naddressed to the Secretary of State by the governor of the Territory of\r\nNevada, and commend to the particular attention of Congress those parts\r\nof it which show that further legislation is desirable for the public\r\nwelfare in that quarter.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Containing a narrative of incidents pertaining to the\r\ngovernment of the Territory of Nevada.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 31, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of commerce and navigation between the United\r\nStates and the Ottoman Empire, signed at Constantinople on the 25th of\r\nlast month. Extracts from a dispatch of the same date, upon the subject\r\nof the treaty, from Mr. Morris, the United States minister at\r\nConstantinople, to the Secretary of State, are also herewith\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the exchange of ratifications is to take place\r\nwithin three months from the date of the instrument. This renders it\r\ndesirable that the Senate should decide in regard to it as soon as this\r\nmay be convenient, for if that decision be favorable the ratifications\r\nof this Government must reach Constantinople prior to the expiration of\r\nthe three months adverted to.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 5, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nyesterday, requesting any information which may have been received at\r\nthe Department of State showing the system of revenue and finance now\r\nexisting in any foreign country, I transmit a copy of a recent dispatch\r\nfrom Mr. Pike, the United States minister at The Hague. This is\r\nunderstood to be the only information on the subject of the resolution\r\nrecently received which has not been made public.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 10, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty between the United States and Her Britannic\r\nMajesty for the suppression of the slave trade. A copy of the\r\ncorrespondence between the Secretary of State and Lord Lyons on the\r\nsubject of the treaty is also herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 14, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n3d ultimo, requesting information in regard to the present condition of\r\nMexico, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 15, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of June, 1860, the Senate approved of the treaty of\r\nfriendship and commerce between the United States and Nicaragua, signed\r\non the 16th of March, 1859, with certain amendments.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, namely, June 27, 1860, the Senate adopted a resolution\r\nextending the period for the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty\r\nfor six months from that date; that is, until the 27th of December,\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nAlthough the amendments of the Senate were immediately transmitted to\r\nour minister in Nicaragua for submission to the Government of that\r\nRepublic, he failed, notwithstanding earnest efforts, to induce that\r\nGovernment to call an extra session of Congress to take into\r\nconsideration the amendments of the Senate of the United States within\r\nthe supplementary time named in the resolution of June 27, 1860, for the\r\nexchange of ratifications.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 25th of March, 1861, nearly three months after the\r\nexpiration of the six months extended by the Senate resolution, that the\r\nCongress of Nicaragua acted favorably upon the amendments of the Senate\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nA translation of the decree of the Nicaraguan Government approving the\r\ntreaty as amended, with an additional amendment, is herewith inclosed.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that while the ratification of Nicaragua recites\r\nliterally the second amendment of the Senate and accepts it with an\r\nadditional clause, it does not in explicit terms accept the first\r\namendment of the Senate, striking out the last clause of the sixteenth\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nThat amendment is of so much importance that the adoption or rejection\r\nof it by the Government of Nicaragua should not be left to construction\r\nor inference.\r\n\r\nThe final amendment of that Government properly extended the time of\r\nexchanging ratifications for an additional twelve months. That time has\r\nexpired. For obvious reasons connected with our internal affairs, the\r\nsubject has not sooner been submitted to the Senate, but the treaty is\r\nnow laid before that body, with this brief historical sketch and the\r\ndecree of the Nicaraguan Government, for such further advice as may be\r\ndeemed necessary and proper in regard to the acceptance or rejection of\r\nthe amendments of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 15, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the delay attending the approval by the Senate of the\r\nextradition treaty with Mexico signed on the 11th December last, it is\r\nimpossible to effect the exchange of ratifications of that and the\r\npostal convention of the same date within the period assigned by those\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nI recommend, therefore, the passage of a resolution at the earliest\r\npracticable moment extending the time specified in the eighth article of\r\nthe extradition treaty and in the twelfth article of the postal\r\nconvention for the exchange of ratifications for sixty days from and\r\nafter the 11th June next, the date of the expiration of the period named\r\nfor that purpose in both instruments.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _April 15, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and such constitutional\r\naction as the Senate may deem proper to take, a treaty negotiated on the\r\n6th March, 1861, between late Agent Vanderslice, on the part of the\r\nUnited States, and certain delegates of the Sac and Fox of the Missouri\r\nand the Iowa tribes of Indians; also certain petitions of said tribes,\r\npraying that the treaty may be ratified with an amendment as set forth\r\nin said petitions. A letter of the Secretary of the Interior, with a\r\nreport of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and letter of the present\r\nagent of the Indians, accompany the treaty and petitions.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 16, 1862.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe act entitled \"An act for the release of certain persons held to\r\nservice or labor in the District of Columbia\" has this day been approved\r\nand signed.\r\n\r\nI have never doubted the constitutional authority of Congress to abolish\r\nslavery in this District, and I have ever desired to see the national\r\ncapital freed from the institution in some satisfactory way. Hence there\r\nhas never been in my mind any question upon the subject except the one\r\nof expediency, arising in view of all the circumstances. If there be\r\nmatters within and about this act which might have taken a course or\r\nshape more satisfactory to my judgment, I do not attempt to specify\r\nthem. I am gratified that the two principles of compensation and\r\ncolonization are both recognized and practically applied in the act.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of compensation, it is provided that claims may be\r\npresented within ninety days from the passage of the act, \"but not\r\nthereafter;\" and there is no saving for minors, femes covert, insane or\r\nabsent persons. I presume this is an omission by mere oversight, and I\r\nrecommend that it be supplied by an amendatory or supplemental act.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 18, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a correspondence between the Secretary\r\nof State and Benjamin E. Brewster, of Philadelphia, relative to the\r\narrest in that city of Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War, at the suit\r\nof Pierce Butler, for trespass _vi et armis_, assault and battery, and\r\nfalse imprisonment.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, April 24, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to your resolution of the 17th instant, I herewith\r\ncommunicate the testimony and judgment of the recent naval court of\r\ninquiry in the case of Lieutenant Charles E. Fleming, of the United\r\nStates Navy; also the testimony and finding of the naval retiring board\r\nin the case of the said Lieutenant Fleming.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to state that the judgment and finding aforesaid have\r\nnot been approved by me.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 26, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n24th of February last, requesting information in regard to insurgent\r\nprivateers in foreign ports, I transmit a report from the Secretary of\r\nState and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, May 1, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate in relation to\r\nBrigadier-General Stone, I have the honor to state that he was arrested\r\nand imprisoned under my general authority, and upon evidence which,\r\nwhether he be guilty or innocent, required, as appears to me, such\r\nproceedings to be had against him for the public safety. I deem it\r\nincompatible with the public interest, as also, perhaps, unjust to\r\nGeneral Stone, to make a more particular statement of the evidence.\r\n\r\nHe has not been tried because in the state of military operations at the\r\ntime of his arrest and since the officers to constitute a court-martial\r\nand for witnesses could not be withdrawn from duty without serious\r\ninjury to the service. He will be allowed a trial without any\r\nunnecessary delay, the charges and specifications will be furnished him\r\nin due season, and every facility for his defense will be afforded him\r\nby the War Department.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, May 1, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the suggestion of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\ncontained in the accompanying letter, I have the honor to transmit the\r\ninclosed petition and report thereon of the Third Auditor for the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _May 14, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe third section of the \"Act further to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved 21st of December, 1861, provides--\r\n\r\n\r\n  That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\n  consent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the\r\n  retired list of the Navy for the command of squadrons and single ships\r\n  such officers as he may believe that the good of the service requires\r\n  to be thus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the\r\n  recommendation of the President of the United States they shall receive\r\n  a vote of thanks of Congress for their services and gallantry in action\r\n  against an enemy, be restored to the active list, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, Captain David G. Farragut was nominated to\r\nthe Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of the\r\nsquadron which recently rendered such important service to the Union by\r\nhis successful operations on the Lower Mississippi and capture of New\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nBelieving that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond\r\nwith the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence\r\nas an example, I cordially recommend that Captain D.G. Farragut receive\r\na vote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry displayed in\r\nthe capture since 21st December, 1861, of Forts Jackson and St. Philip,\r\ncity of New Orleans, and the destruction of various rebel gunboats,\r\nrams, etc.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _May 14, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a list of naval officers who commanded vessels engaged\r\nin the recent brilliant operations of the squadron commanded by\r\nFlag-Officer Farragut, which led to the capture of Forts Jackson and St.\r\nPhilip, city of New Orleans, and the destruction of rebel gunboats,\r\nrams, etc., in April, 1862. For their services and gallantry on those\r\noccasions I cordially recommend that they should by name receive a vote\r\nof thanks of Congress.\r\n\r\nLIST.\r\n\r\n  Captain Theodorus Bailey.\r\n  Captain Henry W.

Farnsworth,\r\na commissioner on the part of the United States, and the authorized\r\nrepresentatives of the Kansas tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nA communication from the Secretary of the Interior, together with\r\na letter of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, suggesting certain\r\namendments to the treaty and inclosing papers relating thereto, are\r\nalso transmitted.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 21, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 14th instant,\r\nrequesting information in regard to arrests in the State of Kentucky, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of War, to whom the resolution was\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 22, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n20th instant, requesting information in regard to the indemnity obtained\r\nby the consul-general of the United States at Alexandria, Egypt, for the\r\nmaltreatment of Faris-El-Hakim, an agent in the employ of the American\r\nmissionaries in that country, I transmit a report from the Secretary of\r\nState and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 23, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 22d instant, calling\r\nfor further correspondence relative to Mexican affairs.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the Senate, in answer to a resolution\r\nof that body.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 26, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe insurrection which is yet existing in the United States and\r\naims at the overthrow of the Federal Constitution and the Union was\r\nclandestinely prepared during the winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed\r\nan open organization in the form of a treasonable provisional government\r\nat Montgomery, in Alabama, on the 18th day of February, 1861. On the\r\n12th day of April, 1861, the insurgents committed the flagrant act of\r\ncivil war by the bombardment and capture of Fort Sumter, which cut off\r\nthe hope of immediate conciliation. Immediately afterwards all the roads\r\nand avenues to this city were obstructed, and the capital was put into\r\nthe condition of a siege. The mails in every direction were stopped, and\r\nthe lines of telegraph cut off by the insurgents, and military and naval\r\nforces which had been called out by the Government for the defense of\r\nWashington were prevented from reaching the city by organized and\r\ncombined treasonable resistance in the State of Maryland. There was no\r\nadequate and effective organization for the public defense. Congress had\r\nindefinitely adjourned. There was no time to convene them. It became\r\nnecessary for me to choose whether, using only the existing means,\r\nagencies, and processes which Congress had provided, I should let the\r\nGovernment fall at once into ruin or whether, availing myself of the\r\nbroader powers conferred by the Constitution in cases of insurrection,\r\nI would make an effort to save it, with all its blessings, for the\r\npresent age and for posterity.\r\n\r\nI thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the heads of all the\r\nDepartments, to meet on Sunday, the 20th day of April, 1861, at the\r\noffice of the Navy Department, and then and there, with their unanimous\r\nconcurrence, I directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to\r\nsea to afford protection to the commercial marine, and especially the\r\nCalifornia treasure ships then on their way to this coast. I also\r\ndirected the commandant of the navy-yard at Boston to purchase or\r\ncharter and arm as quickly as possible five steamships for purposes\r\nof public defense. I directed the commandant of the navy-yard at\r\nPhiladelphia to purchase or charter and arm an equal number for the same\r\npurpose. I directed the commandant at New York to purchase or charter\r\nand arm an equal number. I directed Commander Gillis to purchase or\r\ncharter and arm and put to sea two other vessels. Similar directions\r\nwere given to Commodore Du Pont, with a view to the opening of passages\r\nby water to and from the capital. I directed the several officers to\r\ntake the advice and obtain the aid and efficient services in the matter\r\nof His Excellency Edwin D. Morgan, the governor of New York, or in his\r\nabsence George D. Morgan, William M. Evarts, R.M. Blatchford, and Moses\r\nH. Grinnell, who were by my directions especially empowered by the\r\nSecretary of the Navy to act for his Department in that crisis in\r\nmatters pertaining to the forwarding of troops and supplies for the\r\npublic defense.\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion I directed that Governor Morgan and Alexander\r\nCummings, of the city of New York, should be authorized by the Secretary\r\nof War, Simon Cameron, to make all necessary arrangements for the\r\ntransportation of troops and munitions of war, in aid and assistance of\r\nthe officers of the Army of the United States, until communication by\r\nmails and telegraph should be completely reestablished between the\r\ncities of Washington and New York. No security was required to be given\r\nby them, and either of them was authorized to act in case of inability\r\nto consult with the other.\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion I authorized and directed the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to advance, without requiring security, $2,000,000 of public\r\nmoney to John A. Dix, George Opdyke, and Richard M. Blatchford, of New\r\nYork, to be used by them in meeting such requisitions as should be\r\ndirectly consequent upon the military and naval measures necessary for\r\nthe defense and support of the Government, requiring them only to act\r\nwithout compensation and to report their transactions when duly called\r\nupon. The several Departments of the Government at that time contained\r\nso large a number of disloyal persons that it would have been impossible\r\nto provide safely through official agents only for the performance of\r\nthe duties thus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability,\r\nloyalty, and patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by\r\nprivate messengers, who pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities,\r\ninland across the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio and the northern\r\nlakes. I believe that by these and other similar measures taken in that\r\ncrisis, some of which were without any authority of law, the Government\r\nwas saved from overthrow. I am not aware that a dollar of the public\r\nfunds thus confided without authority of law to unofficial persons was\r\neither lost or wasted, although apprehensions of such misdirection\r\noccurred to me as objections to those extraordinary proceedings, and\r\nwere necessarily overruled.\r\n\r\nI recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed\r\nto a resolution which was passed by the House of Representatives on the\r\n30th day of last month, which is in these words:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War, by investing\r\n  Alexander Cummings with the control of large sums of the public money\r\n  and authority to purchase military supplies without restriction, without\r\n  requiring from him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his\r\n  duties, when the services of competent public officers were available,\r\n  and by involving the Government in a vast number of contracts with\r\n  persons not legitimately engaged in the business pertaining to the\r\n  subject-matter of such contracts, especially in the purchase of arms\r\n  for future delivery, has adopted a policy highly injurious to the\r\n  public service, and deserves the censure of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress will see that I should be wanting equally in candor and in\r\njustice if I should leave the censure expressed in this resolution to\r\nrest exclusively or chiefly upon Mr. Cameron. The same sentiment is\r\nunanimously entertained by the heads of Departments who participated\r\nin the proceedings which the House of Representatives has censured.\r\nIt is due to Mr. Cameron to say that although he fully approved the\r\nproceedings they were not moved nor suggested by himself, and that not\r\nonly the President, but all the other heads of Departments, were at\r\nleast equally responsible with him for whatever error, wrong, or fault\r\nwas committed in the premises.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 30, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of amity, commerce, consular privileges, and\r\nextradition between the United States and the Republic of Salvador,\r\nsigned in this city on the 29th instant. It is believed that though\r\nthis instrument contains no stipulation which may not be found in some\r\nsubsisting treaty between the United States and foreign powers, it will\r\nprove to be mutually advantageous. Several of the Republics of this\r\nhemisphere, among which is Salvador, are alarmed at a supposed sentiment\r\ntending to reactionary movements against republican institutions on this\r\ncontinent. It seems, therefore, to be proper that we should show to\r\nany of them who may apply for that purpose that, compatibly with our\r\ncardinal policy and with an enlightened view of our own interests, we\r\nare willing to encourage them by strengthening our ties of good will\r\nand good neighborhood with them.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 4, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 29th ultimo,\r\nadopted in executive session, requesting information in regard to\r\nthe claims of citizens of the United States on Paraguay and the\r\ncorrespondence relating thereto, I transmit a report from the Secretary\r\nof State and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 4, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of War, in answer to\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives of the 2d of June, in\r\nrelation to the authority and action of the Hon. Edward Stanly, military\r\ngovernor of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 10, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a treaty for the suppression of the\r\nAfrican slave trade, between the United States and Her Britannic\r\nMajesty, signed in this city on the 7th of April last, and the\r\nratifications of which were exchanged at London on the 20th ultimo.\r\n\r\nA copy of the correspondence which preceded the conclusion of the\r\ninstrument between the Secretary of State and Lord Lyons, Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, is also\r\nherewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that such legislation as may be necessary to carry the\r\ntreaty into effect should be enacted as soon as may comport with the\r\nconvenience of Congress.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 12, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the resolution of your honorable body of the 9th\r\ninstant, requesting certain information in regard to the circuit court\r\nof the United States for the State of California, and the judge of said\r\ncourt, I have the honor to transmit a letter of the Attorney-General,\r\nwith copies of two other letters and of an indorsement of my own upon\r\none of them; all which, taken together, contain all the information\r\nwithin my power to give upon the subject.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 13, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a memorial addressed and presented to me in behalf\r\nof the State of New York in favor of enlarging the locks of the Erie and\r\nOswego Canal. While I have not given nor have leisure to give the\r\nsubject a careful examination, its great importance is obvious and\r\nunquestionable. The large amount of valuable statistical information\r\nwhich is collated and presented in the memorial will greatly facilitate\r\nthe mature consideration of the subject, which I respectfully ask for it\r\nat your hands.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, June 17, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th instant,\r\nasking whether any legislation is necessary in order to give effect to\r\nthe provisions of the act of April 16, 1862, providing for the\r\nreorganization of the Medical Department of the Army, was referred to\r\nthe Secretary of War, whose report thereon is herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 23, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the project\r\nof a treaty between the United States and Mexico which had been proposed\r\nto me by Mr. Corwin, our minister to Mexico, and respectfully requested\r\nthe advice of the Senate thereupon.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th day of February last a resolution was adopted by the Senate\r\nto the effect \"that it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will\r\nrequire the United States to assume any portion of the principal or\r\ninterest of the debt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of\r\nEuropean powers.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution having been duly communicated to me, notice thereof was\r\nimmediately given by the Secretary of State to Mr. Corwin, and he was\r\ninformed that he was to consider his instructions upon the subject\r\nreferred to modified by this resolution and would govern his course\r\naccordingly. That dispatch failed to reach Mr. Corwin, by reason of the\r\ndisturbed condition of Mexico, until a very recent date, Mr. Corwin\r\nbeing without instructions, or thus practically left without\r\ninstructions, to negotiate further with Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn view of the very important events occurring there, he has thought\r\nthat the interests of the United States would be promoted by the\r\nconclusion of two treaties which should provide for a loan to that\r\nRepublic. He has therefore signed such treaties, and they having been\r\nduly ratified by the Government of Mexico he has transmitted them to me\r\nfor my consideration. The action of the Senate is of course conclusive\r\nagainst an acceptance of the treaties on my part. I have, nevertheless,\r\nthought it just to our excellent minister in Mexico and respectful to\r\nthe Government of that Republic to lay the treaties before the Senate,\r\ntogether with the correspondence which has occurred in relation to them.\r\nIn performing this duty I have only to add that the importance of the\r\nsubject thus submitted to the Senate can not be overestimated, and I\r\nshall cheerfully receive and consider with the highest respect any\r\nfurther advice the Senate may think proper to give upon the subject.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 26, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe accompanying treaty, made and concluded at the city of Washington on\r\nthe 24th day of June, 1862, between the United States and the united\r\nbands of the Ottawa Indians of Blanchards Fork and of Roche de Boeuf, in\r\nKansas, is transmitted for the consideration and constitutional action\r\nof the Senate, agreeably to recommendation of inclosed letter from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior of this date.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 1, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI most cordially recommend that Captain Andrew H.

Calusha A. Crow, Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 17, 1862.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nConsidering the bill for \"An act to suppress insurrection, to punish\r\ntreason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels,\r\nand for other purposes,\" and the joint resolution explanatory of said\r\nact as being substantially one, I have approved and signed both.\r\n\r\nBefore I was informed of the passage of the resolution I had prepared\r\nthe draft of a message stating objections to the bill becoming a law,\r\na copy of which draft is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-Citizens of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n  I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, the\r\n  bill for an act entitled \"An act to suppress treason and rebellion, to\r\n  seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,\"\r\n  together with my objections to its becoming a law.\r\n\r\n  There is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection. It is wholly\r\n  prospective, and touches neither person nor property of any loyal\r\n  citizen, in which particulars it is just and proper. The first and\r\n  second sections provide for the conviction and punishment of persons who\r\n  shall be guilty of treason and persons who shall \"incite, set on foot,\r\n  assist, or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority\r\n  of the United States or the laws thereof, or shall give aid and comfort\r\n  thereto, or shall engage in or give aid and comfort to any such existing\r\n  rebellion or insurrection.\" By fair construction persons within these\r\n  sections are not to be punished without regular trials in duly\r\n  constituted courts, under the forms and all the substantial provisions\r\n  of law and of the Constitution applicable to their several cases. To\r\n  this I perceive no objection, especially as such persons would be within\r\n  the general pardoning power and also the special provision for pardon\r\n  and amnesty contained in this act.\r\n\r\n  It is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted under these\r\n  sections shall be free. I think there is an unfortunate form of\r\n  expression rather than a substantial objection in this. It is startling\r\n  to say that Congress can free a slave within a State, and yet if it were\r\n  said the ownership of the slave had first been transferred to the nation\r\n  and that Congress had then liberated him the difficulty would at once\r\n  vanish. And this is the real case. The traitor against the General\r\n  Government forfeits his slave at least as justly as he does any other\r\n  property, and he forfeits both to the Government against which he\r\n  offends. The Government, so far as there can be ownership, thus owns the\r\n  forfeited slaves, and the question for Congress in regard to them is,\r\n  \"Shall they be made free or be sold to new masters?\" I perceive no\r\n  objection to Congress deciding in advance that they shall be free. To\r\n  the high honor of Kentucky, as I am informed, she has been the owner of\r\n  some slaves by escheat and has sold none, but liberated all. I hope the\r\n  same is true of some other States. Indeed I do not believe it would be\r\n  physically possible for the General Government to return persons so\r\n  circumstanced to actual slavery. I believe there would be physical\r\n  resistance to it which could neither be turned aside by argument nor\r\n  driven away by force. In this view I have no objection to this feature\r\n  of the bill. Another matter involved in these two sections, and running\r\n  through other parts of the act, will be noticed hereafter.\r\n\r\n  I perceive no objection to the third and fourth sections.\r\n\r\n  So far as I wish to notice the fifth and sixth sections, they may be\r\n  considered together. That the enforcement of these sections would do no\r\n  injustice to the persons embraced within them is clear. That those who\r\n  make a causeless war should be compelled to pay the cost of it is too\r\n  obviously just to be called in question. To give governmental protection\r\n  to the property of persons who have abandoned it and gone on a crusade\r\n  to overthrow that same government is absurd if considered in the mere\r\n  light of justice. The severest justice may not always be the best\r\n  policy. The principle of seizing and appropriating the property of the\r\n  persons embraced within these sections is certainly not very\r\n  objectionable, but a justly discriminating application of it would be\r\n  very difficult, and to a great extent impossible. And would it not be\r\n  wise to place a power of remission somewhere, so that these persons may\r\n  know they have something to lose by persisting and something to save by\r\n  desisting? I am not sure whether such power of remission is or is not\r\n  within section 13.\r\n\r\n  Without any special act of Congress, I think our military commanders,\r\n  when, in military phrase, \"they are within the enemy's country,\" should\r\n  in an orderly manner seize and use whatever of real or personal property\r\n  may be necessary or convenient for their commands, at the same time\r\n  preserving in some way the evidence of what they do.\r\n\r\n  What I have said in regard to slaves while commenting on the first and\r\n  second sections is applicable to the ninth, with the difference that no\r\n  provision is made in the whole act for determining whether a particular\r\n  individual slave does or does not fall within the classes defined in\r\n  that section. He is to be free upon certain conditions, but whether\r\n  those conditions do or do not pertain to him no mode of ascertaining is\r\n  provided. This could be easily supplied.\r\n\r\n  To the tenth section I make no objection. The oath therein required\r\n  seems to be proper, and the remainder of the section is substantially\r\n  identical with a law already existing.\r\n\r\n  The eleventh section simply assumes to confer discretionary powers upon\r\n  the Executive. Without the law I have no hesitation to go as far in the\r\n  direction indicated as I may at any time deem expedient. And I am ready\r\n  to say now, I think it is proper for our military commanders to employ\r\n  as laborers as many persons of African descent as can be used to\r\n  advantage.\r\n\r\n  The twelfth and thirteenth sections are somewhat better than\r\n  objectionable, and the fourteenth is entirely proper if all other parts\r\n  of the act shall stand.\r\n\r\n  That to which I chiefly object pervades most parts of the act, but more\r\n  distinctly appears in the first, second, seventh, and eighth sections.\r\n  It is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of\r\n  title forever. For the causes of treason and the ingredients of treason\r\n  not amounting to the full crime it declares forfeiture extending beyond\r\n  the lives of the guilty parties, whereas the Constitution of the United\r\n  States declares that \"no attainder of treason shall work corruption of\r\n  blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.\"\r\n  True, there seems to be no formal attainder in this case; still, I think\r\n  the greater punishment can not be constitutionally inflicted in a\r\n  different form for the same offense. With great respect I am constrained\r\n  to say I think this feature of the act is unconstitutional. It would not\r\n  be difficult to modify it.\r\n\r\n  I may remark that this provision of the Constitution, put in language\r\n  borrowed from Great Britain, applies only in this country to real or\r\n  landed estate.\r\n\r\n  Again, this act, by proceedings _in rem_, forfeits property for the\r\n  ingredients of treason without a conviction of the supposed criminal or\r\n  a personal hearing given him in any proceeding. That we may not touch\r\n  property lying within our reach because we can not give personal notice\r\n  to an owner who is absent endeavoring to destroy the Government is\r\n  certainly not very satisfactory. Still, the owner may not be thus\r\n  engaged; and I think a reasonable time should be provided for such\r\n  parties to appear and have personal hearings. Similar provisions are not\r\n  uncommon in connection with proceedings _in rem_.\r\n\r\n  For the reasons stated, I return the bill to the House, in which it\r\n  originated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 17, 1862.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have inadvertently omitted so long to inform you that in March last\r\nMr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, of New York, gratuitously presented to the\r\nUnited States the ocean steamer _Vanderbilt_, by many esteemed the\r\nfinest merchant ship in the world. She has ever since been and still is\r\ndoing valuable service to the Government. For the patriotic act in\r\nmaking this magnificent and valuable present to the country, I recommend\r\nthat some suitable acknowledgment be made.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 23, 1862.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe bill which has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate\r\nentitled \"An act to repeal that part of an act of Congress which prohibits\r\nthe circulation of bank notes of a less denomination than $5 in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia\" has received my attentive consideration, and I\r\nnow return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the following\r\nobjections:\r\n\r\n1. The bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation prohibiting the\r\ncirculation of bank notes of a less denomination than $5 within the\r\nDistrict of Columbia without permitting the issuing of such bills by\r\nbanks not now legally authorized to issue them. In my judgment it will\r\nbe found impracticable in the present condition of the currency to make\r\nsuch a discrimination. The banks have generally suspended specie\r\npayments, and a legal sanction given to the circulation of the\r\nirredeemable notes of one class of them will almost certainly be so\r\nextended in practical operation as to include those of all classes,\r\nwhether authorized or unauthorized. If this view be correct, the\r\ncurrency of the District, should this act become a law, will certainly\r\nand greatly deteriorate, to the serious injury of honest trade and\r\nhonest labor.\r\n\r\n2. This bill seems to contemplate no end which can not be otherwise more\r\ncertainly and beneficially attained. During the existing war it is\r\npeculiarly the duty of the National Government to secure to the people a\r\nsound circulating medium. This duty has been under existing\r\ncircumstances satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing\r\nthe issue of United States notes, receivable for all Government dues\r\nexcept customs, and made a legal tender for all debts, public and\r\nprivate, except interest on public debt. The object of the bill\r\nsubmitted to me, namely, that of providing a small-note currency during\r\nthe present suspension, can be fully accomplished by authorizing the\r\nissue, as part of any new emission of United States notes made necessary\r\nby the circumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character but\r\nof less denomination than $5. Such an issue would answer all the\r\nbeneficial purposes of the bill, would save a considerable amount to the\r\nTreasury in interest, would greatly facilitate payments to soldiers and\r\nother creditors of small sums, and would furnish to the people a\r\ncurrency as safe as their own Government.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself constrained to\r\nwithhold from it my approval and return it for the further consideration\r\nand action of Congress.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_July 2, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, an act\r\nentitled \"An act to provide for additional medical officers of the\r\nvolunteer service,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nMy reason for so doing is that I have approved an act of the same title\r\npassed by Congress after the passage of the one first mentioned for the\r\nexpress purpose of correcting errors in and superseding the same, as I\r\nam informed.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to the people of the United States that they assemble\r\nin their customary places of meeting for public solemnities on the 22d\r\nday of February instant and celebrate the anniversary of the birth of\r\nthe Father of his Country by causing to be read to them his immortal\r\nFarewell Address.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthe 19th day of February, A.D. 1862, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States of America the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

To vessels clearing from foreign ports and destined to ports opened\r\nby the proclamation of the President of the United States of this date,\r\nnamely, Beaufort, in North Carolina; Port Royal, in South Carolina, and\r\nNew Orleans, in Louisiana, licenses will be granted by consuls of the\r\nUnited States upon satisfactory evidence that the vessels so licensed\r\nwill convey no persons, property, or information contraband of war\r\neither to or from the said ports, which licenses shall be exhibited to\r\nthe collector of the port to which said vessels may be respectively\r\nbound immediately on arrival, and, if required, to any officer in charge\r\nof the blockade; and on leaving either of said ports every vessel will\r\nbe required to have a clearance from the collector of the customs,\r\naccording to law, showing no violation of the conditions of the license.\r\nAny violation of said conditions will involve the forfeiture and\r\ncondemnation of the vessel and cargo and the exclusion of all parties\r\nconcerned from any further privilege of entering the United States\r\nduring the war for any purpose whatever.\r\n\r\n2. To vessels of the United States clearing coastwise for the ports\r\naforesaid licenses can only be obtained from the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\n3. In all other respects the existing blockade remains in full force and\r\neffect as hitherto established and maintained, nor is it relaxed by the\r\nproclamation except in regard to the ports to which the relaxation is by\r\nthat instrument expressly applied.\r\n\r\nS.P. CHASE,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of the Treasury_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a\r\nproclamation of Major-General Hunter, in the words and figures\r\nfollowing, to wit:\r\n\r\n  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,\r\n    _Hilton Head, S.C., May 9, 1862_.\r\n\r\n  _General Orders, No. 11_.--The three States of Georgia, Florida, and\r\n  South Carolina, comprising the Military Department of the South, having\r\n  deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the\r\n  United States of America, and having taken up arms against the said\r\n  United States, it becomes a military necessity to declare them under\r\n  martial law. This was accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862.\r\n  Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible;\r\n  the persons in these three States--Georgia, Florida, and South\r\n  Carolina--heretofore held as slaves are therefore declared forever free.\r\n\r\n  DAVID HUNTER,\r\n  _Major-General Commanding_.\r\n\r\n  Official:\r\n\r\n  ED. W. SMITH,\r\n  _Acting Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding:\r\n\r\nTherefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, proclaim\r\nand declare that the Government of the United States had no knowledge,\r\ninformation, or belief of an intention on the part of General Hunter to\r\nissue such a proclamation, nor has it yet any authentic information that\r\nthe document is genuine; and, further, that neither General Hunter nor\r\nany other commander or person has been authorized by the Government of\r\nthe United States to make proclamations declaring the slaves of any\r\nState free, and that the supposed proclamation now in question, whether\r\ngenuine or false, is altogether void so far as respects such\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nI further make known that whether it be competent for me, as Commander\r\nin Chief of the Army and Navy, to declare the slaves of any State or\r\nStates free, and whether at any time, in any case, it shall have become\r\na necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the Government to\r\nexercise such supposed power, are questions which, under my\r\nresponsibility, I reserve to myself, and which I can not feel justified\r\nin leaving to the decision of commanders in the field. These are totally\r\ndifferent questions from those of police regulations in armies and\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th day of March last, by a special message, I recommended to\r\nCongress the adoption of a joint resolution to be substantially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the United States ought to cooperate with any State\r\nwhich may adopt a gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State\r\npecuniary aid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to\r\ncompensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such\r\nchange of system.\r\n\r\nThe resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted by large\r\nmajorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic,\r\ndefinite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people\r\nmost immediately interested in the subject-matter. To the people of\r\nthose States I now earnestly appeal--I do not argue; I beseech you to\r\nmake the arguments for yourselves; you can not, if you would, be blind\r\nto the signs of the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged\r\nconsideration of them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and\r\npartisan politics. This proposal makes common cause for a common object,\r\ncasting no reproaches upon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change it\r\ncontemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or\r\nwrecking anything. Will you not embrace it?

STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 1, RELATING TO POLITICAL PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 14, 1862_.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of a formidable insurrection based on a conflict of\r\npolitical ideas, being an event without precedent in the United States,\r\nwas necessarily attended by great confusion and perplexity of the public\r\nmind. Disloyalty before unsuspected suddenly became bold, and treason\r\nastonished the world by bringing at once into the field military forces\r\nsuperior in number to the standing Army of the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery department of the Government was paralyzed by treason. Defection\r\nappeared in the Senate, in the House of Representatives, in the Cabinet,\r\nin the Federal courts; ministers and consuls returned from foreign\r\ncountries to enter the insurrectionary councils or land or naval forces;\r\ncommanding and other officers of the Army and in the Navy betrayed our\r\ncouncils or deserted their posts for commands in the insurgent forces.\r\nTreason was flagrant in the revenue and in the post-office service, as\r\nwell as in the Territorial governments and in the Indian reserves.\r\n\r\nNot only governors, judges, legislators, and ministerial officers in the\r\nStates, but even whole States rushed one after another with apparent\r\nunanimity into rebellion. The capital was besieged and its connection\r\nwith all the States cut off.\r\n\r\nEven in the portions of the country which were most loyal political\r\ncombinations and secret societies were formed furthering the work of\r\ndisunion, while, from motives of disloyalty or cupidity or from excited\r\npassions or perverted sympathies, individuals were found furnishing men,\r\nmoney, and materials of war and supplies to the insurgents' military and\r\nnaval forces. Armies, ships, fortifications, navy-yards, arsenals,\r\nmilitary posts, and garrisons one after another were betrayed or\r\nabandoned to the insurgents.\r\n\r\nCongress had not anticipated, and so had not provided for, the\r\nemergency. The municipal authorities were powerless and inactive. The\r\njudicial machinery seemed as if it had been designed, not to sustain the\r\nGovernment, but to embarrass and betray it.\r\n\r\nForeign intervention, openly invited and industriously instigated by the\r\nabettors of the insurrection, became imminent, and has only been\r\nprevented by the practice of strict and impartial justice, with the most\r\nperfect moderation, in our intercourse with nations.\r\n\r\nThe public mind was alarmed and apprehensive, though fortunately not\r\ndistracted or disheartened. It seemed to be doubtful whether the Federal\r\nGovernment, which one year before had been thought a model worthy of\r\nuniversal acceptance, had indeed the ability to defend and maintain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSome reverses, which, perhaps, were unavoidable, suffered by newly\r\nlevied and inefficient forces, discouraged the loyal and gave new hopes\r\nto the insurgents. Voluntary enlistments seemed about to cease and\r\ndesertions commenced. Parties speculated upon the question whether\r\nconscription had not become necessary to fill up the armies of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the President felt it his duty to employ with energy\r\nthe extraordinary powers which the Constitution confides to him in cases\r\nof insurrection. He called into the field such military and naval\r\nforces, unauthorized by the existing laws, as seemed necessary. He\r\ndirected measures to prevent the use of the post-office for treasonable\r\ncorrespondence. He subjected passengers to and from foreign countries to\r\nnew passport regulations, and he instituted a blockade, suspended the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_ in various places, and caused persons who were\r\nrepresented to him as being or about to engage in disloyal and\r\ntreasonable practices to be arrested by special civil as well as\r\nmilitary agencies and detained in military custody when necessary to\r\nprevent them and deter others from such practices. Examinations of such\r\ncases were instituted, and some of the persons so arrested have been\r\ndischarged from time to time under circumstances or upon conditions\r\ncompatible, as was thought, with the public safety.\r\n\r\nMeantime a favorable change of public opinion has occurred. The line\r\nbetween loyalty and disloyalty is plainly defined. The whole structure\r\nof the Government is firm and stable. Apprehension of public danger and\r\nfacilities for treasonable practices have diminished with the passions\r\nwhich prompted heedless persons to adopt them. The insurrection is\r\nbelieved to have culminated and to be declining.\r\n\r\nThe President, in view of these facts, and anxious to favor a return to\r\nthe normal course of the Administration as far as regard for the public\r\nwelfare will allow, directs that all political prisoners or state\r\nprisoners now held in military custody be released on their subscribing\r\nto a parole engaging them to render no aid or comfort to the enemies in\r\nhostility to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War will, however, in his discretion, except from the\r\neffect of this order any persons detained as spies in the service of the\r\ninsurgents, or others whose release at the present moment may be deemed\r\nincompatible with the public safety.\r\n\r\nTo all persons who shall be so released and who shall keep their parole\r\nthe President grants an amnesty for any past offenses of treason or\r\ndisloyalty which they may have committed.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary arrests will hereafter be made under the direction of the\r\nmilitary authorities alone.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Thanks to the Forces That Captured Fort Henry and\r\nRoanoke Island.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, D.C., _February 15, 1862_.\r\n\r\nThe President, Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, returns thanks\r\nto Brigadier-General Burnside and Flag-Officer Goldsborough, and to\r\nBrigadier-General Grant and Flag-Officer Foote, and the land and naval\r\nforces under their respective commands, for their gallant achievements\r\nin the capture of Fort Henry and at Roanoke Island. While it will be no\r\nordinary pleasure for him to acknowledge and reward in a becoming manner\r\nthe valor of the living, he also recognizes his duty to pay fitting\r\nhonor to the memory of the gallant dead. The charge at Roanoke Island,\r\nlike the bayonet charge at Mill Springs, proves that the close grapple\r\nand sharp steel of loyal and patriotic soldiers must always put rebels\r\nand traitors to flight.\r\n\r\nThe late achievements of the Navy show that the flag of the Union, once\r\nborne in proud glory around the world by naval heroes, will soon again\r\nfloat over every rebel city and stronghold, and that it shall forever be\r\nhonored and respected as the emblem of liberty and union in every land\r\nand upon every sea.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nGIDEON WELLES,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of the Navy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, D.C., February 17, 1862_.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General F.W. LANDER:\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say that he has observed with pleasure the\r\nactivity and enterprise manifested by yourself and the officers and\r\nsoldiers of your command. You have shown how much may be done in the\r\nworst weather and worst roads by a spirited officer at the head of a\r\nsmall force of brave men, unwilling to waste life in camp when the\r\nenemies of their country are within reach. Your brilliant success is a\r\nhappy presage of what may be expected when the Army of the Potomac shall\r\nbe led to the field by their gallant general.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 16.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 18, 1862_.\r\n\r\nI. The following concurrent resolutions of the two Houses of the\r\nCongress of the United States are published for the information of the\r\nArmy:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the two Houses will assemble in the Chamber of the\r\nHouse of Representatives on Saturday, the 22d day of February instant,\r\nat 12 o'clock meridian, and that in the presence of the two Houses of\r\nCongress thus assembled the Farewell Address of George Washington to the\r\npeople of the United States shall be read; and that the President of the\r\nSenate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives be requested to\r\ninvite the President of the United States, the heads of the several\r\nDepartments, the judges of the Supreme Court, the representatives from\r\nall foreign governments near this Government, and such officers of the\r\nArmy and Navy and distinguished citizens as may then be at the seat of\r\nGovernment to be present on that occasion.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the President of the United States, Commander in Chief\r\nof the Army and Navy, be requested to direct that orders be issued for\r\nthe reading to the Army and Navy of the United States of the Farewell\r\nAddress of George Washington, or such parts thereof as he may select, on\r\nthe 22d day of February instant.\r\n\r\nII. In compliance with the foregoing resolutions, the President of the\r\nUnited States, Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, orders that the\r\nfollowing extracts from the Farewell Address of George Washington be\r\nread to the troops at every military post and at the head of the several\r\nregiments and corps of the Army:\r\n\r\nInterwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts,\r\nno recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nThe unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now\r\ndear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the edifice of\r\nyour real independence, the support of your tranquillity at home, your\r\npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty\r\nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from\r\ndifferent causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken,\r\nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this\r\ntruth, as this is the point in your political fortress against which the\r\nbatteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and\r\nactively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of\r\ninfinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of\r\nyour national union to your collective and individual happiness; that\r\nyou should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it;\r\naccustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of\r\nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with\r\njealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion\r\nthat it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the\r\nfirst dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country\r\nfrom the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the\r\nvarious parts.\r\n\r\nFor this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens by\r\nbirth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to\r\nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you\r\nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of\r\npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.\r\nWith slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners,\r\nhabits, and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and\r\ntriumphed together. The independence and liberty you possess are the\r\nwork of joint councils and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings,\r\nand successes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and\r\nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined can not fail to\r\nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater\r\nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less\r\nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations, and, what is of\r\ninestimable value, they must derive from union an exemption from those\r\nbroils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict\r\nneighboring countries not tied together by the same governments, which\r\ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which\r\nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate\r\nand imbitter. Hence, likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those\r\novergrown military establishments which, under any form of government,\r\nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as\r\nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is that\r\nyour union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and\r\nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole\r\nis indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts can be\r\nan adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the infractions\r\nand interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced.\r\nSensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your first\r\nessay by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better calculated\r\nthan your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious\r\nmanagement of your common concerns. This Government, the offspring of\r\nour own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation\r\nand mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the\r\ndistribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing\r\nwithin itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to\r\nyour confidence and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance\r\nwith its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the\r\nfundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems\r\nis the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of\r\ngovernment. But the constitution which at any time exists till changed\r\nby an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly\r\nobligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the\r\npeople to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual\r\nto obey the established government.\r\n\r\nAll obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and\r\nassociations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design\r\nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and\r\naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this\r\nfundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize\r\nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the\r\nplace of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a\r\nsmall but artful and enterprising minority of the community, and,\r\naccording to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the\r\npublic administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous\r\nprojects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome\r\nplans, digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity,\r\nreligion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that\r\nman claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these\r\ngreat pillars of human happiness--these firmest props of the duties\r\nof men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man,\r\nought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all\r\ntheir connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be\r\nasked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life,\r\nif the sense of religious obligation _desert_ the oaths which are the\r\ninstruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with\r\ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without\r\nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education\r\non minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to\r\nexpect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nIt is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring\r\nof popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force\r\nto every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it\r\ncan look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the\r\nfabric? Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions\r\nfor the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure\r\nof a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that\r\npublic opinion should be enlightened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nObserve good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and\r\nharmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct. And can it\r\nbe that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a\r\nfree, enlightened, and at no distant period a great nation to give to\r\nmankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided\r\nby an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the course\r\nof time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any\r\ntemporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it?\r\nCan it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of\r\na nation with its virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended by\r\nevery sentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered\r\nimpossible by its vices?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by\r\npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should\r\nhold an equal and impartial hand, neither seeking nor granting exclusive\r\nfavors or preferences; consulting the natural course of things;\r\ndiffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce, but\r\nforcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in order to give\r\ntrade a stable course, to define the rights of our merchants, and to\r\nenable the Government to support them, conventional rules of\r\nintercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will\r\npermit, but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandoned or\r\nvaried as experience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping\r\nin view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors\r\nfrom another; that it must pay with a portion of its independence for\r\nwhatever it may accept under that character; that by such acceptance it\r\nmay place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for\r\nnominal favors, and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not\r\ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate\r\nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which\r\nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\r\n\r\nIn offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and\r\naffectionate friend I dare not hope they will make the strong and\r\nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual\r\ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course\r\nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even\r\nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some\r\noccasional good--that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury\r\nof party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to\r\nguard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this hope will be\r\na full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have\r\nbeen dictated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough in reviewing the incidents of my Administration I am unconscious\r\nof intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not\r\nto think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever\r\nthey may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the\r\nevils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that\r\nmy country will never cease to view them with indulgence, and that,\r\nafter forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an\r\nupright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to\r\noblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\r\n\r\nRelying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by that\r\nfervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it the\r\nnative soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations, I\r\nanticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise\r\nmyself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the\r\nmidst of my fellow-citizens the benign influence of good laws under a\r\nfree government--the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy\r\nreward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.\r\n\r\nBy command of Major-General McClellan:\r\n\r\nL.

STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Daily National Intelligencer, May 17, 1862.]\r\n\r\nThe skillful and gallant movements of Major-General John E. Wool and the\r\nforces under his command, which resulted in the surrender of Norfolk and\r\nthe evacuation of strong batteries erected by the rebels on Sewells\r\nPoint and Craney Island and the destruction of the rebel ironclad\r\nsteamer _Merrimac_, are regarded by the President as among the most\r\nimportant successes of the present war.

You are also authorized to form a permanent corps\r\nof artificers, organized, officered, and equipped in such manner as you\r\nmay prescribe; to supply said corps with rations, transportation, tools,\r\nand implements by requisitions upon the proper departments; to employ\r\ncivilians as foremen and assistants, under such rules and rates of\r\ncompensation as you may deem expedient; to make such additions to\r\nordinary rations when actually at work as you may deem necessary.\r\n\r\nYou are also authorized to take possession of and use all railroads,\r\nengines, cars, buildings, machinery, and appurtenances within the\r\ngeographical limits of the Department of the Rappahannock, and all\r\nauthority heretofore given to other parties which may in any way\r\nconflict with the instructions herein contained are and will be without\r\nforce and effect in the said Department of the Rappahannock from and\r\nafter this date.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President, Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of\r\nthe United States:\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, D.C., May 30, 1862_.\r\n\r\nAll regiments of militia or of three-months' volunteers who have offered\r\ntheir services under the recent call of the War Department, and who have\r\nso far perfected their organization as to be able to report for orders\r\nat St. Louis, at Columbus, or at Washington City by the 10th of June,\r\nwill be mustered into the service of the United States for three months\r\nfrom that date, the pay of each volunteer or militiaman commencing from\r\nthe date of his enlistment.\r\n\r\nUnder the call for three-years volunteers 50,000 men will be accepted as\r\nraised and reported by the respective State governors.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _June 30, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Governors of the several States_:\r\n\r\nThe capture of New Orleans, Norfolk, and Corinth by the national forces\r\nhas enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about\r\nRichmond, which place we must take with the least possible delay; in\r\nfact, there will soon be no formidable insurgent force except at\r\nRichmond. With so large an army there, the enemy can threaten us on the\r\nPotomac and elsewhere. Until we have reestablished the national\r\nauthority, all these places must be held, and we must keep a respectable\r\nforce in front of Washington. But this, from the diminished strength of\r\nour Army by sickness and casualties, renders an addition to it necessary\r\nin order to close the struggle which has been prosecuted for the last\r\nthree months with energy and success. Rather than hazard the\r\nmisapprehension of our military condition and of groundless alarm by a\r\ncall for troops by proclamation, I have deemed it best to address you in\r\nthis form. To accomplish the object stated we require without delay\r\n150,000 men, including those recently called for by the Secretary of\r\nWar. Thus reenforced our gallant Army will be enabled to realize the\r\nhopes and expectations of the Government and the people.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, governors of States of the Union, impressed with the\r\nbelief that the citizens of the States which they respectively represent\r\nare of one accord in the hearty desire that the recent successes of the\r\nFederal arms may be followed up by measures which must insure the speedy\r\nrestoration of the Union, and believing that, in view of the present\r\nstate of the important military movements now in progress and the\r\nreduced condition of our effective forces in the field, resulting from\r\nthe usual and unavoidable casualties in the service, the time has\r\narrived for prompt and vigorous measures to be adopted by the people in\r\nsupport of the great interests committed to your charge, respectfully\r\nrequest, if it meets with your entire approval, that you at once call\r\nupon the several States for such number of men as may be required to\r\nfill up all military organizations now in the field, and add to the\r\narmies heretofore organized such additional number of men as may, in\r\nyour judgment, be necessary to garrison and hold all the numerous cities\r\nand military positions that have been captured by our armies, and to\r\nspeedily crush the rebellion that still exists in several of the\r\nSouthern States, thus practically restoring to the civilized world our\r\ngreat and good Government. All believe that the decisive moment is near\r\nat hand, and to that end the people of the United States are desirous to\r\naid promptly in furnishing all reenforcements that you may deem needful\r\nto sustain our Government.\r\n\r\n  ISRAEL WASHBURN, Jr., Governor of Maine; H.S.

I suggest and recommend that the troops should be chiefly\r\nof infantry. The quota of your State would be ------. I trust that they\r\nmay be enrolled without delay, so as to bring this unnecessary and\r\ninjurious civil war to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion. An order\r\nfixing the quotas of the respective States will be issued by the War\r\nDepartment to-morrow.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 11, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That Major-General Henry W. Halleck be assigned to command\r\nthe whole land forces of the United States as General in Chief, and that\r\nhe repair to this capital as soon as he can with safety to the positions\r\nand operations within the department under his charge.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does\r\nrequire that the railroad line called and known as the Southwest Branch\r\nof the Pacific Railroad in the State of Missouri be repaired, extended,\r\nand completed from Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springfield, in\r\nthe said State, the same being necessary to the successful and\r\neconomical conduct of the war and to the maintenance of the authority of\r\nthe Government in the Southwest:\r\n\r\nTherefore, under and in virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act\r\nto authorize the President of the United States in certain cases to take\r\npossession of railroad and telegraph lines, and for other purposes,\"\r\napproved January 31, 1862, it is--\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That the portion of the said railroad line which reaches from\r\nRolla to Lebanon be repaired, extended, and completed, so as to be made\r\navailable for the military uses of the Government, as speedily as may\r\nbe. And inasmuch as, upon the part of the said line from Rolla to the\r\nstream called Little Piney a considerable portion of the necessary work\r\nhas already been done by the railroad company, and the road to this\r\nextent may be completed at comparatively small cost, it is ordered that\r\nthe said line from Rolla to and across Little Piney be first completed,\r\nand as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War is charged with the execution of this order. And to\r\nfacilitate the speedy execution of the work, he is directed, at his\r\ndiscretion, to take possession and control of the whole or such part of\r\nthe said railroad line, and the whole or such part of the rolling stock,\r\noffices, shops, buildings, and all their appendages and appurtenances,\r\nas he may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the\r\nroad from Rolla to Lebanon.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, July 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 82.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 21, 1862_.\r\n\r\nThe following order has been received from the President of the United\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nRepresentations have been made to the President by the ministers of\r\nvarious foreign powers in amity with the United States that subjects of\r\nsuch powers have during the present insurrection been obliged or\r\nrequired by military authorities to take an oath of general or qualified\r\nallegiance to this Government. It is the duty of all aliens residing in\r\nthe United States to submit to and obey the laws and respect the\r\nauthority of the Government. For any proceeding or conduct inconsistent\r\nwith this obligation and subversive of that authority they may\r\nrightfully be subjected to military restraints when this may be\r\nnecessary. But they can not be required to take an oath of allegiance to\r\nthis Government, because it conflicts with the duty they owe to their\r\nown sovereigns. All such obligations heretofore taken are therefore\r\nremitted and annulled. Military commanders will abstain from imposing\r\nsimilar obligations in future, and will in lieu thereof adopt such other\r\nrestraints of the character indicated as they shall find necessary,\r\nconvenient, and effectual for the public safety. It is further directed\r\nthat whenever any order shall be made affecting the personal liberty of\r\nan alien reports of the same and of the causes thereof shall be made to\r\nthe War Department for the consideration of the Department of State.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nL. THOMAS,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _July 22, 1862_.\r\n\r\n1. _Ordered_, That military commanders within the States of Virginia,\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nTexas, and Arkansas in an orderly manner seize and use any property,\r\nreal or personal, which may be necessary or convenient for their several\r\ncommands as supplies or for other military purposes; and that while\r\nproperty may be destroyed for proper military objects, none shall be\r\ndestroyed in wantonness or malice.\r\n\r\n2. That military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers within\r\nand from said States so many persons of African descent as can be\r\nadvantageously used for military or naval purposes, giving them\r\nreasonable wages for their labor.\r\n\r\n3. That as to both property and persons of African descent accounts\r\nshall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and\r\namounts and from whom both property and such persons shall have come, as\r\na basis upon which compensation can be made in proper cases; and the\r\nseveral Departments of this Government shall attend to and perform their\r\nappropriate parts toward the execution of these orders.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 89.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 25, 1862_.\r\n\r\nI. The following order of the President of the United States\r\ncommunicates information of the death of ex-President Martin Van Buren:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 25, 1862_.\r\n\r\nThe President with deep regret announces to the people of the United\r\nStates the decease, at Kinderhook, N.Y., on the 24th instant, of his\r\nhonored predecessor Martin Van Buren.\r\n\r\nThis event will occasion mourning in the nation for the loss of a\r\ncitizen and a public servant whose memory will be gratefully cherished.\r\nAlthough it has occurred at a time when his country is afflicted with\r\ndivision and civil war, the grief of his patriotic friends will\r\nmeasurably be assuaged by the consciousness that while suffering with\r\ndisease and seeing his end approaching his prayers were for the\r\nrestoration of the authority of the Government of which he had been the\r\nhead and for peace and good will among his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nAs a mark of respect for his memory, it is ordered that the Executive\r\nMansion and the several Executive Departments, except those of War and\r\nthe Navy, be immediately placed in mourning and all business be\r\nsuspended during to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIt is further ordered that the War and Navy Departments cause suitable\r\nmilitary and naval honors to be paid on this occasion to the memory of\r\nthe illustrious dead.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. On the day after the receipt of this order the troops will be\r\nparaded at 10 o'clock a.m. and the order read to them. The national flag\r\nwill be displayed at half-staff. At dawn of day thirteen guns will be\r\nfired, and afterwards at intervals of thirty minutes between rising and\r\nsetting sun a single gun, and at the close of the day a national salute\r\nof thirty-four guns. The officers of the Army will wear crape on the\r\nleft arm and on their swords and the colors of the several regiments\r\nwill be put in mourning for the period of six months.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nL. THOMAS,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _July 25, 1862_.\r\n\r\nThe death of ex-President Martin Van Buren is announced in the following\r\norder of the President of the United States:\r\n\r\n[For order see preceding page.]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the foregoing order, it is hereby directed that thirty\r\nminute guns, commencing at noon, be fired on the day after the receipt\r\nof this general order at the navy-yards, naval stations, and on board\r\nthe vessels of the Navy in commission; that their flags be displayed at\r\nhalf-mast for one week, and that crape be worn on the left arm by all\r\nofficers of the Navy for a period of six months.\r\n\r\nGIDEON WELLES,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of the Navy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, D.C., July 31, 1862_.\r\n\r\nThe absence of officers and privates from their duty under various\r\npretexts while receiving pay, at great expense and burden to the\r\nGovernment, makes it necessary that efficient measures be taken to\r\nenforce their return to duty or that their places be supplied by those\r\nwho will not take pay while rendering no service. This evil, moreover,\r\ntends greatly to discourage the patriotic impulses of those who would\r\ncontribute to support the families of faithful soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore ordered by the President--\r\n\r\nI. That on Monday, the 11th day of August, all leaves of absence and\r\nfurloughs, by whomsoever given, unless by the War Department, are\r\nrevoked and absolutely annulled, and all officers capable of service are\r\nrequired forthwith to join their respective commands and all privates\r\ncapable of service to join their regiments, under penalty of a dismissal\r\nfrom the service, or such penalty as a court-martial may award, unless\r\nthe absence be occasioned by lawful cause.\r\n\r\nII. The only excuses allowed for the absence of officers or privates\r\nafter the 11th day of August are:\r\n\r\nFirst. The order or leave of the War Department.\r\n\r\nSecond. Disability from wounds received in service.\r\n\r\nThird. Disability from disease that renders the party unfit for military\r\nduty. But any officer or private whose health permits him to visit\r\nwatering places or places of amusement, or to make social visits or walk\r\nabout the town, city, or neighborhood in which he may be, will be\r\nconsidered fit for military duty and as evading duty by absence from his\r\ncommand or ranks.\r\n\r\nIII. On Monday, the 18th day of August, at 10 o'clock a.m., each\r\nregiment and corps shall be mustered. The absentees will be marked,\r\nthree lists of the same made out, and within forty-eight hours after the\r\nmuster one copy shall be sent to the Adjutant-General of the Army, one\r\nto the commander of the corps, the third to be retained; and all\r\nofficers and privates fit for duty absent at that time will be regarded\r\nas absent without cause, their pay will be stopped, and they dismissed\r\nfrom the service or treated as deserters unless restored; and no officer\r\nshall be restored to his rank unless by the judgment of a court of\r\ninquiry, to be approved by the President, he shall establish that his\r\nabsence was with good cause.\r\n\r\nIV. Commanders of corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and detached\r\nposts are strictly enjoined to enforce the muster and return aforesaid.\r\nAny officer failing in his duty herein will be deemed guilty of gross\r\nneglect of duty and be dismissed from the service.\r\n\r\nV. A commissioner shall be appointed by the Secretary of War to\r\nsuperintend the execution of this order in the respective States.\r\n\r\nThe United States marshals in the respective districts, the mayor and\r\nchief of police of any town or city, the sheriff of the respective\r\ncounties in each State, all postmasters and justices of the peace, are\r\nauthorized to act as special provost-marshals to arrest any officer or\r\nprivate soldier fit for duty who may be found absent from his command\r\nwithout just cause and convey him to the nearest military post or depot.\r\nThe transportation, reasonable expenses of this duty, and $5 will be\r\npaid for each officer or private so arrested and delivered.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nE.M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, D.C., August 4, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, I. That a draft of 300,000 militia be immediately called into\r\nthe service of the United States, to serve for nine months unless sooner\r\ndischarged. The Secretary of War will assign the quotas to the States\r\nand establish regulations for the draft.\r\n\r\nII. That if any State shall not by the 15th of August furnish its quota\r\nof the additional 300,000 volunteers authorized by law the deficiency of\r\nvolunteers in that State will also be made up by special draft from the\r\nmilitia. The Secretary of War will establish regulations for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIII. Regulations will be prepared by the War Department and presented to\r\nthe President with the object of securing the promotion of officers of\r\nthe Army and Volunteers for meritorious and distinguished services and\r\nof preventing the nomination or appointment in the military service of\r\nincompetent or unworthy officers. The regulations will also provide for\r\nridding the service of such incompetent persons as now hold commissions\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., August 8, 1862_.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the President of the United States, it is hereby ordered\r\nthat until further order no citizen liable to be drafted into the\r\nmilitia shall be allowed to go to a foreign country. And all marshals,\r\ndeputy marshals, and military officers of the United States are\r\ndirected, and all police authorities, especially at the ports of the\r\nUnited States on the seaboard and on the frontier, are requested, to see\r\nthat this order is faithfully carried into effect. And they are hereby\r\nauthorized and directed to arrest and detain any person or persons about\r\nto depart from the United States in violation of this order, and report\r\nto Major L.C. Turner, judge-advocate at Washington City, for further\r\ninstructions respecting the person or persons so arrested or detained.\r\n\r\nII. Any person liable to draft who shall absent himself from his county\r\nor State before such draft is made will be arrested by any\r\nprovost-marshal or other United States or State officer, wherever he may\r\nbe found within the jurisdiction of the United States, and be conveyed\r\nto the nearest military post or depot and placed on military duty for\r\nthe term of the draft; and the expenses of his own arrest and conveyance\r\nto such post or depot, and also the sum of $5, as a reward to the\r\nofficer who shall make such arrest, shall be deducted from his pay.\r\n\r\nIII. The writ of _habeas corpus_ is hereby suspended in respect to all\r\npersons so arrested and detained, and in respect to all persons arrested\r\nfor disloyal practices.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, D.C., August 14, 1862_.\r\n\r\nORDER RESPECTING VOLUNTEERS AND MILITIA.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, first. That after the 15th of this month bounty and advanced\r\npay shall not be paid to volunteers for any new regiments, but only to\r\nvolunteers for regiments now in the field and volunteers to fill up new\r\nregiments now organizing, but not yet full.\r\n\r\nSecond. Volunteers to fill up new regiments now organizing will be\r\nreceived and paid the bounty and advanced pay until the 22d day of this\r\nmonth, and if not completed by that time the incomplete regiments will\r\nbe consolidated and superfluous officers mustered out.\r\n\r\nThird. Volunteers to fill up the old regiments will be received and paid\r\nthe bounty and advanced pay until the 1st day of September.\r\n\r\nFourth. The draft for 300,000 militia called for by the President will\r\nbe made on Wednesday, the 3d day of September, between the hours of 9\r\na.m. and 5 p.m., and continue from day to day between the same hours\r\nuntil completed.\r\n\r\nFifth. If the old regiments should not be filled up by volunteers before\r\nthe 1st day of September, a special draft will be ordered for the\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\nSixth. The exigencies of the service require that officers now in the\r\nfield should remain with their commands, and no officer now in the field\r\nin the regular or volunteer service will under any circumstances be\r\ndetailed to accept a new command.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nEDWIN M.

TOWNSEND,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING A PROVISIONAL COURT IN LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, October 20, 1862_.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection which has for some time prevailed in several of the\r\nStates of this Union, including Louisiana, having temporarily subverted\r\nand swept away the civil institutions of that State, including the\r\njudiciary and the judicial authorities of the Union, so that it has\r\nbecome necessary to hold the State in military occupation, and it being\r\nindispensably necessary that there shall be some judicial tribunal\r\nexisting there capable of administering justice, I have therefore\r\nthought it proper to appoint, and I do hereby constitute, a provisional\r\ncourt, which shall be a court of record, for the State of Louisiana; and\r\nI do hereby appoint Charles A. Peabody, of New York, to be a provisional\r\njudge to hold said court, with authority to hear, try, and determine all\r\ncauses, civil and criminal, including causes in law, equity, revenue,\r\nand admiralty, and particularly all such powers and jurisdiction as\r\nbelong to the district and circuit courts of the United States,\r\nconforming his proceedings so far as possible to the course of\r\nproceedings and practice which has been customary in the courts of the\r\nUnited States and Louisiana, his judgment to be final and conclusive.\r\nAnd I do hereby authorize and empower the said judge to make and\r\nestablish such rules and regulations as may be necessary for the\r\nexercise of his jurisdiction, and empower the said judge to appoint a\r\nprosecuting attorney, marshal, and clerk of the said court, who shall\r\nperform the functions of attorney, marshal, and clerk according to such\r\nproceedings and practice as before mentioned and such rules and\r\nregulations as may be made and established by said judge. These\r\nappointments are to continue during the pleasure of the President, not\r\nextending beyond the military occupation of the city of New Orleans or\r\nthe restoration of the civil authority in that city and in the State of\r\nLouisiana. These officers shall be paid, out of the contingent fund of\r\nthe War Department, compensation as follows: The judge at the rate of\r\n$3,500 per annum; the prosecuting attorney, including the fees, at the\r\nrate of $3,000 per annum; the marshal, including the fees, at the rate\r\nof $3,000 per annum; and the clerk, including the fees, at the rate of\r\n$2,500 per annum; such compensations to be certified by the Secretary of\r\nWar. A copy of this order, certified by the Secretary of War and\r\ndelivered to such judge, shall be deemed and held to be a sufficient\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, October 29, 1862_.\r\n\r\nTwo associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States having\r\nbeen appointed since the last adjournment of said court, and\r\nconsequently no allotment of the members of said court to the several\r\ncircuits having been made by them, according to the fifth section of the\r\nact of Congress entitled \"An act to amend the judicial system of the\r\nUnited States,\" approved April 29, 1802, I, Abraham Lincoln, President\r\nof the United States, in virtue of said section, do make an allotment of\r\nthe justices of said court to the circuits now existing by law, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFor the first circuit: Nathan Clifford, associate justice.\r\n\r\nFor the second circuit: Samuel Nelson, associate justice.\r\n\r\nFor the third circuit: Robert C.

That vessels and domestic produce from Norfolk, permitted by the\r\nmilitary commandant at Fort Monroe for the military purposes of his\r\ncommand, shall on his permit be allowed to pass from said port to their\r\ndestination in any port not blockaded by the United States.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Daily National Intelligencer, November 25, 1862.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_November 13, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered by the President of the United States_, That the\r\nAttorney-General be charged with the superintendence and direction of\r\nall proceedings to be had under the act of Congress of the 17th of July,\r\n1862, entitled \"An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and\r\nrebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other\r\npurposes,\" in so far as may concern the seizure, prosecution, and\r\ncondemnation of the estate, property, and effects of rebels and\r\ntraitors, as mentioned and provided for in the fifth, sixth, and seventh\r\nsections of the said act of Congress. And the Attorney-General is\r\nauthorized and required to give to the attorneys and marshals of the\r\nUnited States such instructions and directions as he may find needful\r\nand convenient touching all such seizures, prosecutions, and\r\ncondemnations, and, moreover, to authorize all such attorneys and\r\nmarshals, whenever there may be reasonable ground to fear any forcible\r\nresistance to them in the discharge of their respective duties in this\r\nbehalf, to call upon any military officer in command of the forces of\r\nthe United States to give to them such aid, protection, and support as\r\nmay be necessary to enable them safely and efficiently to discharge\r\ntheir respective duties; and all such commanding officers are required\r\npromptly to obey such call, and to render the necessary service as far\r\nas may be in their power consistently with their other duties.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  EDWARD BATES,\r\n    _Attorney-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER RESPECTING THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH DAY IN THE ARMY\r\nAND NAVY.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, November 15, 1862_.\r\n\r\nThe President, Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, desires and\r\nenjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and men in\r\nthe military and naval service. The importance for man and beast of the\r\nprescribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and\r\nsailors, a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a Christian\r\npeople, and a due regard for the divine will demand that Sunday labor in\r\nthe Army and Navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity.\r\n\r\nThe discipline and character of the national forces should not suffer\r\nnor the cause they defend be imperiled by the profanation of the day or\r\nname of the Most High. \"At this time of public distress,\" adopting the\r\nwords of Washington in 1776, \"men may find enough to do in the service\r\nof God and their country without abandoning themselves to vice and\r\nimmorality.\" The first general order issued by the Father of his Country\r\nafter the Declaration of Independence indicates the spirit in which our\r\ninstitutions were founded and should ever be defended:\r\n\r\n_The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor\r\nto live and act as becomes a Christian soldier defending the dearest\r\nrights and liberties of his country_.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, November 21, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That no arms, ammunition, or munitions of war be cleared or\r\nallowed to be exported from the United States until further order; that\r\nany clearances for arms, ammunition, or munitions of war issued\r\nheretofore by the Treasury Department be vacated if the articles have\r\nnot passed without the United States, and the articles stopped; that the\r\nSecretary of War hold possession of the arms, etc., recently seized by\r\nhis order at Rouses Point, bound for Canada.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 1, 1862.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nSince your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful\r\nharvests has passed, and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless\r\nus with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light\r\nHe gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way all will\r\nyet be well.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during\r\nthe last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a\r\nrequest to that effect made by the House of Representatives near the\r\nclose of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying\r\nthan it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more\r\nsatisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might\r\nreasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some\r\ngrounds to expect that the maritime powers which at the beginning of our\r\ndomestic difficulties so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think,\r\nrecognized the insurgents as a belligerent would soon recede from that\r\nposition, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our\r\nown country. But the temporary reverses which afterwards befell the\r\nnational arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens\r\nabroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.\r\n\r\nThe civil war, which has so radically changed for the moment the\r\noccupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed\r\nthe social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the\r\nnations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily\r\nincreasing throughout a period of half a century. It has at the same\r\ntime excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a\r\nprofound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual\r\nagitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between\r\nforeign states and between parties or factions in such states. We have\r\nattempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution. But we have\r\nleft to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own\r\naffairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign\r\nnations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and\r\noften exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations\r\nthemselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this Government, even\r\nif it were just, would certainly be unwise.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has\r\nbeen put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is\r\nan occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it\r\non the part of Her Majesty's Government has been marked with a jealous\r\nrespect for the authority of the United States and the rights of their\r\nmoral and loyal citizens.\r\n\r\nThe convention with Hanover for the abolition of the Stade dues has been\r\ncarried into full effect under the act of Congress for that purpose.\r\n\r\nA blockade of 3,000 miles of seacoast could not be established and\r\nvigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the\r\npresent without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting\r\nunintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects.\r\n\r\nA civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on\r\ntrade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints of\r\nthe violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite\r\nmisapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between\r\nnations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship.\r\nIn clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possible heard and\r\nredressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There\r\nis still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases\r\nupon which the Government is unable to agree with the governments whose\r\nprotection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases\r\nin which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the\r\nnaval or military authorities of foreign nations which the governments\r\nof those states are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to\r\nsome of the foreign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine\r\nand adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made especially to\r\nGreat Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has\r\nbeen kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners\r\nof the Norwegian bark _Admiral P. Tordenskiold_, which vessel was in\r\nMay, 1861, prevented by the commander of the blockading force off\r\nCharleston from leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar\r\nprivilege had shortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have\r\ndirected the Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be\r\ncommunicated to the proper committees.\r\n\r\nApplications have been made to me by many free Americans of African\r\ndescent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as\r\nwas contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and\r\nabroad--some from interested motives, others upon patriotic\r\nconsiderations, and still others influenced by philanthropic\r\nsentiments--have suggested similar measures, while, on the other hand,\r\nseveral of the Spanish American Republics have protested against the\r\nsending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these\r\ncircumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any state\r\nwithout first obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement\r\non its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of\r\nfreemen; and I have at the same time offered to the several States\r\nsituated within the Tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with\r\nthem, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the\r\nvoluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective\r\nterritories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and humane.\r\nLiberia and Hayti are as yet the only countries to which colonists of\r\nAfrican descent from here could go with certainty of being received and\r\nadopted as citizens; and I regret to say such persons contemplating\r\ncolonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to\r\nsome others, nor so willing as I think their interest demands. I\r\nbelieve, however, opinion among them in this respect is improving, and\r\nthat ere long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to\r\nboth these countries from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of\r\nTurkey has been carried into execution.\r\n\r\nA commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the\r\nSenate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending\r\nwith the Republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the national\r\ncommerce is expected to result from these measures.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia,\r\nPrussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the\r\nother European States remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also\r\ncontinue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year there has not only been no change of our previous\r\nrelations with the independent States of our own continent, but more\r\nfriendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be\r\nentertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are so\r\nintimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to\r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile.\r\n\r\nThe commission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada\r\nclosed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims\r\nwhich were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the\r\nconvention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint\r\ncommission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has\r\ncompleted its labors and submitted its report.\r\n\r\nI have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe\r\nby an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph\r\nfrom San Francisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which\r\nis being extended across the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have\r\nremained undisturbed by the civil war; and they are exhibiting such\r\nevidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them\r\nwill soon be in a condition to be organized as States and be\r\nconstitutionally admitted into the Federal Union.\r\n\r\nThe immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be\r\ndeveloped as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would\r\nhave a tendency to improve the revenues of the Government and diminish\r\nthe burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration\r\nwhether some extraordinary measures to promote that end can not be\r\nadopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective\r\nis a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories\r\nwith a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign\r\ncountries--results which can not fail to be auspicious.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the finances will claim your most diligent\r\nconsideration. The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval\r\noperations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto\r\nbeen met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar\r\ncircumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The\r\ncontinuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made\r\nnecessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best\r\nreflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue\r\nwithout injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the\r\ncommencement of your last session made large issues of United States\r\nnotes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and\r\nthe satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well\r\nprovided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the\r\nreceivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making\r\nthem a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal\r\ncurrency, and has satisfied, partially at least, and for the time, the\r\nlong-felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the\r\npeople immense sums in discounts and exchanges.\r\n\r\nA return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible\r\nwith due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view.\r\nFluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to\r\nreduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a\r\nleading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain\r\nconvertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and\r\nsurest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a\r\ncirculation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently\r\nlarge for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and\r\nsafely maintained.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the\r\npublic wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform\r\ncurrency secured?\r\n\r\nI know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time\r\nso unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations, under a\r\ngeneral act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such\r\nassociations the Government might furnish circulating notes, on the\r\nsecurity of United States bonds deposited in the Treasury. These notes,\r\nprepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in\r\nappearance and security and convertible always into coin, would at once\r\nprotect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate\r\ncommerce by cheap and safe exchanges.\r\n\r\nA moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate\r\nthe United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and\r\na general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of\r\nthat part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit,\r\nmoreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans\r\ngreatly facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bonds\r\nwhich the adoption of the proposed system would create.\r\n\r\nIt is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable\r\nweight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all\r\nexisting interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions\r\nto reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform\r\nnational circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and\r\nunsecured, now issued by them.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury from all sources, including loans and\r\nbalance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th\r\nJune, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 were\r\nderived from customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public\r\nlands, $152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loans\r\nin all forms, $529,692,460.50. The remainder, $2,257,065.80, was the\r\nbalance from last year.\r\n\r\nThe disbursements during the same period were: For Congressional,\r\nexecutive, and judicial purposes, $5,939,009.29; for foreign\r\nintercourse, $1,339,710.35; for miscellaneous expenses, including the\r\nmints, loans, Post-Office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other\r\nlike charges, $14,129,771.50; for expenses under the Interior\r\nDepartment, $3,102,985.52; under the War Department, $394,368,407.36;\r\nunder the Navy Department, $42,674,569.69; for interest on public debt,\r\n$13,190,324.45; and for payment of public debt, including reimbursement\r\nof temporary loan and redemptions, $96,096,922.09; making an aggregate\r\nof $570,841,700.25, and leaving a balance in the Treasury on the 1st day\r\nof July, 1862, of $13,043,546.81.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922.09, expended for\r\nreimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also in the\r\nloans made, may be properly deducted both from receipts and\r\nexpenditures, leaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324.97,\r\nand the expenditures $474,744,778.16.\r\n\r\nOther information on the subject of the finances will be found in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I\r\ninvite your most candid and considerate attention.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewith\r\ntransmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief\r\nabstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations\r\nconducted through those Departments. Nor could I give a summary of them\r\nhere upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than\r\nthe reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the\r\nreports before you and asking your attention to them.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial\r\ncondition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several\r\npreceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to\r\n$8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the\r\nUnion for three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of\r\nrevenue from the so-called seceded States during the last fiscal year,\r\nthe increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been\r\nsufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90,\r\nbeing only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the\r\nUnion during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more\r\nfavorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. For\r\nthe last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a\r\ndecrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the\r\npreceding year, and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year\r\n1860. The deficiency in the Department for the previous year was\r\n$4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814.57.\r\nThese favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail\r\nservice in the insurrectionary States and in part to a careful review of\r\nall expenditures in that Department in the interest of economy. The\r\nefficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much\r\nimproved. The Postmaster-General has also opened a correspondence\r\nthrough the Department of State with foreign governments proposing a\r\nconvention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the\r\nrates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails. This\r\nproposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the\r\ncommercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained and\r\nagreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the\r\nPostmaster-General in his report respecting the further legislation\r\nrequired, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public\r\nlands:\r\n\r\n  The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st\r\n  July, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from\r\n  the sale of lands were $137,476.26--a sum much less than the expenses of\r\n  our land system during the same period. The homestead law, which will\r\n  take effect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to\r\n  settlers that sales for cash can not be expected to an extent sufficient\r\n  to meet the expenses of the General Land Office and the cost of\r\n  surveying and bringing the land into market.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of\r\nthe public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported\r\nfrom the Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the fact that\r\nthe periods of time, though apparently, were not really coincident at\r\nthe beginning point, the Treasury report including a considerable sum\r\nnow which had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently\r\nlarge to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now\r\nreported upon by the Interior and not by the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year\r\nmanifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several points have\r\nengaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their\r\nvicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas\r\nrenounced their allegiance to the United States and entered into\r\ntreaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United\r\nStates were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees has\r\nvisited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of\r\nthe tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained\r\nby superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that\r\nthe United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty\r\nstipulations required.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked the\r\nsettlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing\r\nindiscriminately men, women, and children. This attack was wholly\r\nunexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been provided. It is\r\nestimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians, and\r\na large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced\r\nis not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not\r\nto be stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureau from\r\ndifferent sources about the time hostilities were commenced that a\r\nsimultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the\r\ntribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The State\r\nof Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war. A large\r\nportion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has\r\nbeen sustained by the destruction of property. The people of that State\r\nmanifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of\r\nthe State as a guaranty against future hostilities. The Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs wall furnish full details. I submit for your especial\r\nconsideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many\r\nwise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can be\r\nprofitably done.\r\n\r\nI submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows\r\nthe progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the\r\nPacific Railroad. And this suggests the earliest completion of this\r\nroad, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now\r\npending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in\r\nNew York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing\r\nimportance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast interior\r\nregion hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length. I purpose\r\nhaving prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and\r\nvaluable statistical information upon this subject. The military and\r\ncommercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan Canal and\r\nimproving the Illinois River is presented in the report of Colonel\r\nWebster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. I\r\nrespectfully ask attention to it.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May\r\nlast, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States\r\nto be organized.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this\r\nDepartment has established an extensive system of correspondence and\r\nexchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly\r\nbeneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent\r\nimprovements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in\r\nthe collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States.\r\n\r\nAlso, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds,\r\ncereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally\r\ndiffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate\r\nreport, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable\r\ntests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe creation of this Department was for the more immediate benefit of a\r\nlarge class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the liberal\r\nbasis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your\r\napprobation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest\r\nanticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful\r\nsource of advantage to all our people.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the\r\nExecutive, a copy of which is herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that\r\npaper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called\r\n\"compensated emancipation.\"\r\n\r\nA nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its\r\nlaws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability.\r\n\"One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the\r\nearth abideth forever.\" It is of the first importance to duly consider\r\nand estimate this ever-enduring part. That portion of the earth's\r\nsurface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States\r\nis well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not\r\nwell adapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of climate\r\nand productions are of advantage in this age for one people, whatever\r\nthey might have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence\r\nhave brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of\r\ndisunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two\r\nsections. I did so in language which I can not improve, and which,\r\ntherefore, I beg to repeat:\r\n\r\n  One section of our country believes slavery is _right_ and ought to be\r\n  extended, while the other believes it is _wrong_ and ought not to be\r\n  extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave\r\n  clause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the\r\n  foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can\r\n  ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly\r\n  supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry\r\n  legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I\r\n  think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases\r\n  _after_ the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave\r\n  trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without\r\n  restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially\r\n  surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\n  Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our\r\n  respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between\r\n  them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and\r\n  beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country\r\n  can not do this. They can not but remain face to face, and intercourse,\r\n  either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible,\r\n  then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory\r\n  _after_ separation than _before_? Can aliens make treaties easier than\r\n  friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between\r\n  aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you can not\r\n  fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on\r\n  either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of\r\n  intercourse, are again upon you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary\r\nupon which to divide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line\r\nbetween the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than\r\none-third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated,\r\nor soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its\r\nremaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk\r\nback and forth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of\r\nthis line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on\r\npaper or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it\r\ncomes, gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive-slave\r\nclause, along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section\r\nseceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be\r\nmade to take its place.\r\n\r\nBut there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east\r\nby the Alleghanies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky\r\nMountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and\r\ncotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee,\r\nall of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri,\r\nKansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and\r\npart of Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people, and will have\r\n50,000,000 within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or\r\nmistake. It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the\r\nUnited States--certainly more than 1,000,000 square miles. Once half as\r\npopulous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than 75,000,000\r\npeople. A glance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is\r\nthe great body of the Republic. The other parts are but marginal borders\r\nto it, the magnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to\r\nthe Pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped\r\nresources. In the production of provisions, grains, grasses, and all\r\nwhich proceed from them this great interior region is naturally one of\r\nthe most important in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small\r\nproportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation,\r\nand also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we\r\nshall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented. And\r\nyet this region has no seacoast--touches no ocean anywhere. As part of\r\none nation, its people now find, and may forever find, their way to\r\nEurope by New York, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to\r\nAsia by San Francisco; but separate our common country into two nations,\r\nas designed by the present rebellion, and every man of this great\r\ninterior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these\r\noutlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and\r\nonerous trade regulations.\r\n\r\nAnd this is true, _wherever_ a dividing or boundary line may be fixed.\r\nPlace it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of\r\nKentucky or north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south\r\nof it can trade to any port or place north of it, and none north of it\r\ncan trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated\r\nby a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south,\r\nare indispensable to the well-being of the people inhabiting and to\r\ninhabit this vast interior region. _Which_ of the three may be the best\r\nis no proper question. All are better than either, and all of right\r\nbelong to that people and to their successors forever. True to\r\nthemselves, they will not ask _where_ a line of separation shall be, but\r\nwill vow rather that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal\r\nregions less interested in these communications to and through them to\r\nthe great outside world. They, too, and each of them, must have access\r\nto this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any\r\nnational boundary.\r\n\r\nOur national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the\r\nland we inhabit; not from our national homestead. There is no possible\r\nsevering of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In\r\nall its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors\r\nseparation. In fact, it would ere long force reunion, however much of\r\nblood and treasure the separation might have cost.\r\n\r\nOur strife pertains to ourselves--to the passing generations of men--and\r\nit can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIn this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and\r\narticles amendatory to the Constitution of the United States:\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of both Houses\r\nconcurring)_, That the following articles be proposed to the\r\nlegislatures (or conventions) of the several States as amendments to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, all or any of which articles,\r\nwhen ratified by three-fourths of the said legislatures (or conventions),\r\nto be valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, viz:\r\n\r\n  ART. --. Every State wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish\r\n  the same therein at any time or times before the 1st day of January,\r\n  A.D. 1900, shall receive compensation from the United States as\r\n  follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n  The President of the United States shall deliver to every such State\r\n  bonds of the United States bearing interest at the rate of ---- per cent\r\n  per annum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of ---- for each slave\r\n  shown to have been therein by the Eighth Census of the United States,\r\n  said bonds to be delivered to such State by installments or in one\r\n  parcel at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same\r\n  shall have been gradual or at one time within such State; and interest\r\n  shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its\r\n  delivery as aforesaid. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid and\r\n  afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein shall refund to\r\n  the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all\r\n  interest paid thereon.\r\n\r\n  ART. --. All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances\r\n  of the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever\r\n  free; but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall\r\n  be compensated for them at the same rates as is provided for States\r\n  adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall\r\n  be twice accounted for.\r\n\r\n  ART. --. Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for\r\n  colonizing free colored persons with their own consent at any place\r\n  or places without the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nI beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length.\r\nWithout slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery\r\nit could not continue.\r\n\r\nAmong the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment and\r\nof policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some\r\nwould perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly and without\r\ncompensation; some would abolish it gradually and with compensation;\r\nsome would remove the freed people from us, and some would retain them\r\nwith us; and there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these\r\ndiversities we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves. By\r\nmutual concession we should harmonize and act together. This would be\r\ncompromise, but it would be compromise among the friends and not with\r\nthe enemies of the Union. These articles are intended to embody a plan\r\nof such mutual concessions. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed\r\nthat emancipation will follow, at least in several of the States.\r\n\r\nAs to the first article, the main points are, first, the emancipation;\r\nsecondly, the length of time for consummating it (thirty-seven years);\r\nand, thirdly, the compensation.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual\r\nslavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their\r\ndissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of sudden\r\nderangement-- in fact, from the necessity of any derangement--while most\r\nof those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the\r\nmeasure will have passed away before its consummation. They will never\r\nsee it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but will\r\ndeprecate the length of time. They will feel that it gives too little to\r\nthe now living slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from\r\nthe vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation\r\nin localities where their numbers are very great, and it gives the\r\ninspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan\r\nleaves to each State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or\r\nat the end of the century, or at any intermediate time, or by degrees\r\nextending over the whole or any part of the period, and it obliges no\r\ntwo States to proceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and\r\ngenerally the mode of making it. This, it would seem, must further\r\nmitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and\r\nespecially of those who are to receive the compensation. Doubtless some\r\nof those who are to pay and not to receive will object. Yet the measure\r\nis both just and economical. In a certain sense the liberation of slaves\r\nis the destruction of property--property acquired by descent or by\r\npurchase, the same as any other property. It is no less true for having\r\nbeen often said that the people of the South are not more responsible\r\nfor the original introduction of this property than are the people of\r\nthe North; and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use\r\ncotton and sugar and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be\r\nquite safe to say that the South has been more responsible than the\r\nNorth for its continuance. If, then, for a common object this property\r\nis to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a common charge?\r\n\r\nAnd if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the\r\nbenefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is it\r\nnot also economical to do it? Let us consider it, then. Let us ascertain\r\nthe sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was\r\nproposed last March, and consider whether if that measure had been\r\npromptly accepted by even some of the slave States the same sum would\r\nnot have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so,\r\nthe measure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and\r\neconomical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay _something_ as it\r\nis to pay _nothing_, but it is easier to pay a _large_ sum than it is to\r\npay a _larger_ one. And it is easier to pay any sum _when_ we are able\r\nthan it is to pay it _before_ we are able. The war requires large sums,\r\nand requires them at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated\r\nemancipation of course would be large. But it would require no ready\r\ncash, nor the bonds even any faster than the emancipation progresses.\r\nThis might not, and probably would not, close before the end of the\r\nthirty-seven years. At that time we shall probably have a hundred\r\nmillions of people to share the burden, instead of thirty-one millions\r\nas now. And not only so, but the increase of our population may be\r\nexpected to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as\r\nbefore, because our territory will not have become full. I do not state\r\nthis inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase which we have\r\nmaintained, on an average, from our first national census, in 1790,\r\nuntil that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a population of 103,208,415.\r\nAnd why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period? Our\r\nabundant room, our broad national homestead, is our ample resource. Were\r\nour territory as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly our\r\npopulation could not expand as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign\r\nborn as now, we should be compelled to send part of the native born\r\naway. But such is not our condition. We have 2,963,000 square miles.\r\nEurope has 3,800,000, with a population averaging 73-1/3 persons to the\r\nsquare mile. Why may not our country at some time average as many? Is it\r\nless fertile? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes,\r\ndeserts, or other causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural\r\nadvantage? If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe,\r\nhow soon? As to when this _may_ be, we can judge by the past and the\r\npresent; as to when it _will_ be, if ever, depends much on whether we\r\nmaintain the Union. Several of our States are already above the average\r\nof Europe--73-1/3 to the square mile. Massachusetts has 157; Rhode\r\nIsland, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York and New Jersey, each 80. Also two\r\nother great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below, the former\r\nhaving 63 and the latter 59. The States already above the European\r\naverage, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio since\r\npassing that point as ever before, while no one of them is equal to some\r\nother parts of our country in natural capacity for sustaining a dense\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nTaking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and ratio\r\nof increase for the several decennial periods to be as follows:\r\n\r\n  Year.

Assuming that it will continue, it gives the following\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n  Year.                      Population.\r\n\r\n  1870                        42,323,341\r\n  1880                        56,967,216\r\n  1890                        76,677,872\r\n  1900                       103,208,415\r\n  1910                       138,918,526\r\n  1920                       186,984,335\r\n  1930                       251,680,914\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures show that our country _may_ be as populous as Europe now\r\nis at some point between 1920 and 1930--say about 1925--our territory,\r\nat 73-1/3 persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain\r\n217,186,000.\r\n\r\nAnd we _will_ reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the\r\nchance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war\r\nspringing from the only great element of national discord among us.\r\nWhile it can not be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of\r\nsecession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population,\r\ncivilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it\r\nwould be very great and injurious.\r\n\r\nThe proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace,\r\ninsure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of\r\nthe country. With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost,\r\ntogether with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt\r\nwithout it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at 6 per cent\r\nper annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary struggle\r\nuntil to-day, without paying anything on either principal or interest,\r\neach man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon\r\nit then; and this because our increase of men through the whole period\r\nhas been greater than 6 per cent--has run faster than the interest upon\r\nthe debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long as its\r\npopulation increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nThis fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due,\r\nbut it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the great\r\nadvantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number\r\n100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now, when we\r\nnumber but 31,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much\r\nharder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the\r\nproposed plan. And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life.\r\nIt will be a saving of both.\r\n\r\nAs to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to\r\nbondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them\r\ndoubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence\r\nprovision is made in this article for compensating such.\r\n\r\nThe third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not\r\noblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may\r\nconsent. This ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand\r\nor on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual\r\nconsent of the people to be deported and the American voters, through\r\ntheir representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nI can not make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor\r\ncolonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against\r\nfree colored persons remaining in the country which is largely\r\nimaginary, if not sometimes malicious.\r\n\r\nIt is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor\r\nand white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch\r\narguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present men\r\nshould utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible\r\nthrough time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can\r\ndisplace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves? If\r\nthey stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they\r\nleave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers.\r\nLogically, there is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even\r\nwithout deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor,\r\nand very surely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of\r\nlabor would still have to be performed--the freed people would surely\r\nnot do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably for a\r\ntime would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers,\r\nbringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently enhancing the\r\nwages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages\r\nto white labor is mathematically certain. Labor is like any other\r\ncommodity in the market--increase the demand for it and you increase the\r\nprice of it. Reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black\r\nlaborer out of the country, and by precisely so much you increase the\r\ndemand for and wages of white labor.\r\n\r\nBut it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the\r\nwhole land. Are they not already in the land? Will liberation make them\r\nany more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole\r\ncountry; and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the\r\none in any way greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now\r\nhaving more than one free colored person to seven whites and this\r\nwithout any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of\r\nColumbia and the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this\r\ncondition. The District has more than one free colored to six whites,\r\nand yet in its frequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never\r\npresented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances.\r\nBut why should emancipation South send the free people North? People of\r\nany color seldom run unless there be something to run from. _Heretofore_\r\ncolored people to some extent have fled North from bondage, and _now_,\r\nperhaps, from both bondage and destitution. But if gradual emancipation\r\nand deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flee from. Their\r\nold masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be\r\nprocured, and the freedmen in turn will gladly give their labor for the\r\nwages till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes and with\r\npeople of their own blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on\r\nthe mutual interests involved. And in any event, can not the North\r\ndecide for itself whether to receive them?\r\n\r\nAgain, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been\r\nany irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of\r\nslavery in this District last spring?\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites\r\nin the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference to\r\npersons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of Congress\r\nabolishing slavery here.\r\n\r\nThe plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a\r\nrestoration of the national authority would be accepted without its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nNor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22,\r\n1862, be stayed because of the _recommendation_ of this plan. Its timely\r\n_adoption_, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.\r\n\r\nAnd notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide\r\nby law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before\r\nthis plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. Such\r\nwould be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply\r\nto both.\r\n\r\nThis plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional\r\nto, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority\r\nthroughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its\r\neconomical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more\r\nspeedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force\r\nalone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of\r\npayment and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be the\r\nadditional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force. It is much,\r\nvery much, that it would cost no blood at all.\r\n\r\nThe plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It can not become\r\nsuch without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and\r\nafterwards three-fourths of the States. The requisite three-fourths of\r\nthe States will necessarily include seven of the slave States. Their\r\nconcurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally\r\nadopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional\r\nterms. This assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed\r\nto the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of the nation, nor\r\ndo I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have\r\nmore experience than I in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I trust\r\nthat in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will\r\nperceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may\r\nseem to display.\r\n\r\nIs it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten\r\nthe war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it\r\ndoubted that it would restore the national authority and national\r\nprosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we\r\nhere--Congress and Executive--can secure its adoption? Will not the good\r\npeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they,\r\nby any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital\r\nobjects? We can succeed only by concert. It is not \"Can _any_ of us\r\n_imagine_ better?\" but \"Can we _all_ do better?\" Object whatsoever is\r\npossible, still the question recurs, \"Can we do better?\" The dogmas of\r\nthe quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is\r\npiled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our\r\ncase is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall\r\nourselves, and then we shall save our country.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, _we_ can not escape history. We of this Congress and\r\nthis Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No\r\npersonal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us.\r\nThe fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or\r\ndishonor to the latest generation. We _say_ we are for the Union. The\r\nworld will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union.\r\nThe world knows we do know how to save it. We, even _we here_, hold the\r\npower and bear the responsibility. In _giving_ freedom to the _slave_ we\r\n_assure_ freedom to the _free_--honorable alike in what we give and what\r\nwe preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of\r\nearth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain,\r\npeaceful, generous, just--a way which if followed the world will forever\r\napplaud and God must forever bless.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 3, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of November, 1861, a collision took place off the coast of\r\nCuba between the United States war steamer _San Jacinto_ and the French\r\nbrig _Jules et Marie_, resulting in serious damage to the latter. The\r\nobligation of this Government to make amends therefor could not be\r\nquestioned if the injury resulted from any fault on the part of the\r\n_San Jacinto_.\r\n\r\nWith a view to ascertain this, the subject was referred to a commission\r\nof the United States and French naval officers at New York, with a naval\r\nofficer of Italy as an arbiter. The conclusion arrived at was that the\r\ncollision was occasioned by the failure of the _San Jacinto_ seasonably\r\nto reverse her engine. It then became necessary to ascertain the amount\r\nof indemnification due to the injured party. The United States\r\nconsul-general at Havana was consequently instructed to confer with the\r\nconsul of France on this point, and they have determined that the sum of\r\n$9,500 is an equitable allowance under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners\r\nof the _Jules et Marie_.\r\n\r\nA copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the consul-general of the United\r\nStates at Havana, to the Secretary of State on the subject is herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 8, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Commander John L. Worden, United States Navy, receive a vote of\r\nthanks of Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him\r\nin the late remarkable battle between the United States ironclad steamer\r\n_Monitor_, under his command, and the rebel ironclad steamer _Merrimac_,\r\nin March last.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of Congress for his services on the occasion referred to were\r\ntendered by a resolution approved July 11, 1862, but the recommendation\r\nis now specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the\r\nninth section of the act of July 16, 1862, which is in the following\r\nwords, viz:\r\n\r\nThat any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 9, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the United States of\r\nthe 13th of March last, requesting a copy of the correspondence relative\r\nto the attempted seizure of Mr. Fauchet by the commander of the _Africa_\r\nwithin the waters of the United States, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 10, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Lieutenant-Commander George U. Morris, United States Navy, receive\r\na vote of thanks of Congress for the determined valor and heroism\r\ndisplayed in his defense of the United States ship of war _Cumberland_,\r\ntemporarily under his command, in the naval engagement at Hampton Roads\r\non the 8th March, 1862, with the rebel ironclad steam frigate\r\n_Merrimac_.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 10, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th\r\nof July last, requesting the communication of correspondence relating to\r\nthe arrest of a part of the crew of the brig _Sumter_ at Tangier,\r\nMorocco, I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your resolution of December 5, 1862, requesting the\r\nPresident \"to furnish the Senate with all information in his possession\r\ntouching the late Indian barbarities in the State of Minnesota, and also\r\nthe evidence in his possession upon which some of the principal actors\r\nand headmen were tried and condemned to death,\" I have the honor to\r\nstate that on receipt of said resolution I transmitted the same to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, accompanied by a note a copy of which is\r\nherewith inclosed, marked A, and in response to which I received through\r\nthat Department a letter of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, a copy\r\nof which is herewith inclosed, marked B.\r\n\r\nI further state that on the 8th day of November last I received a\r\nlong telegraphic dispatch from Major-General Pope, at St. Paul, Minn.,\r\nsimply announcing the names of the persons sentenced to be hanged. I\r\nimmediately telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all the\r\ncases forwarded to me, which transcripts, however, did not reach me\r\nuntil two or three days before the present meeting of Congress. Meantime\r\nI received, through telegraphic dispatches and otherwise, appeals in\r\nbehalf of the condemned, appeals for their execution, and expressions\r\nof opinion as to proper policy in regard to them and to the Indians\r\ngenerally in that vicinity, none of which, as I understand, falls within\r\nthe scope of your inquiry. After the arrival of the transcripts of\r\nrecords, but before I had sufficient opportunity to examine them,\r\nI received a joint letter from one of the Senators and two of the\r\nRepresentatives from Minnesota, which contains some statements of fact\r\nnot found in the records of the trials, and for which reason I herewith\r\ntransmit a copy, marked C. I also, for the same reason, inclose a\r\nprinted memorial of the citizens of St. Paul addressed to me and\r\nforwarded with the letter aforesaid.\r\n\r\nAnxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another\r\noutbreak on the one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real\r\ncruelty on the other, I caused a careful examination of the records\r\nof trials to be made, in view of first ordering the execution of\r\nsuch as had been proved guilty of violating females. Contrary to my\r\nexpectations, only two of this class were found. I then directed a\r\nfurther examination, and a classification of all who were proven to have\r\nparticipated in _massacres_, as distinguished from participation in\r\n_battles_. This class numbered forty, and included the two convicted\r\nof female violation. One of the number is strongly recommended by the\r\ncommission which tried them for commutation to ten years' imprisonment.\r\nI have ordered the other thirty-nine to be executed on Friday, the 19th\r\ninstant. The order was dispatched from here on Monday, the 8th instant,\r\nby a messenger to General Sibley, and a copy of which order is herewith\r\ntransmitted, marked D.\r\n\r\nAn abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith inclosed,\r\nmarked E.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the immense amount of copying, I lay before the Senate the\r\noriginal transcripts of the records of trials as received by me.\r\n\r\nThis is as full and complete a response to the resolution as it is in my\r\npower to make.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 11, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty between the United States and the Republic of\r\nLiberia, signed at London by the plenipotentiaries of the parties on the\r\n21st of October last.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 12, 1862.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have in my possession three valuable swords, formerly the property of\r\nGeneral David E. Twiggs, which I now place at the disposal of Congress.\r\nThey are forwarded to me from New Orleans by Major-General Benjamin F.\r\nButler. If they or any of them shall be by Congress disposed of in\r\nreward or compliment of military service, I think General Butler is\r\nentitled to the first consideration. A copy of the General's letter to\r\nme accompanying the swords is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 13, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn the list of nominations transmitted to the Senate under date of the\r\n1st instant Captain William M. Glendy, United States Navy, was included\r\ntherein for promotion to the grade of commodore.\r\n\r\nSince submitting this nomination it appears that this officer was\r\nineligible for the advancement to which he had been nominated in\r\nconsequence of his age, being 62 on the 23d of May, 1862, and under the\r\nlaw of 21st December, 1861, should, had this fact been known to the Navy\r\nDepartment, have been transferred to the retired list on the day when he\r\ncompleted sixty-two years.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Captain Glendy is accordingly withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIt is due to this officer to state that at the period of the passage of\r\nthe law of December, 1861, he was and still is absent on duty on a\r\nforeign station, and the certificate of his age required by the Navy\r\nDepartment was only received a few days since.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 18, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a dispatch to the Secretary of State from Mr.\r\nAdams, United States minister at London, and of the correspondence to\r\nwhich it refers between that gentleman and Mr. Panizzi, the principal\r\nlibrarian of the British Museum, relative to certain valuable\r\npublications presented to the Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 22, 1862_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 15th instant,\r\nrequesting a copy of the report of the Hon.

On the 7th day of December, 1847,\r\nGeneral Pedro Alcántara Herran, who had been duly accredited, was\r\nreceived here as the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of\r\nthat Republic. On the 30th day of August, 1849, Señor Don Rafael Rivas\r\nwas received by this Government as chargé d'affaires of the same\r\nRepublic. On the 5th day of December, 1851, a consular convention was\r\nconcluded between that Republic and the United States, which treaty was\r\nsigned on behalf of the Republic of Granada by the same Señor Rivas.\r\nThis treaty is still in force. On the 27th of April, 1852, Señor Don\r\nVictoriano de Diego Paredes was received as chargé d'affaires of the\r\nRepublic of New Granada. On the 20th of June, 1855, General Pedro\r\nAlcántara Herran was again received as envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary, duly accredited by the Republic of New Granada, and he\r\nhas ever since remained, under the same credentials, as the\r\nrepresentative of that Republic near the Government of the United\r\nStates. On the 10th of September, 1857, a claims convention was\r\nconcluded between the United States and the Republic of Granada. This\r\nconvention is still in force, and has in part been executed. In May,\r\n1858, the constitution of the Republic was remodeled, and the nation\r\nassumed the political title of \"The Granadian Confederacy.\" This fact\r\nwas formally announced to this Government, but without any change in\r\ntheir representative here. Previously to the 4th day of March, 1861, a\r\nrevolutionary war against the Republic of New Granada, which had thus\r\nbeen recognized and treated with by the United States, broke out in New\r\nGranada, assuming to set up a new government under the name of \"The\r\nUnited States of Colombia.\" This war has had various vicissitudes,\r\nsometimes favorable, sometimes adverse, to the revolutionary movements.\r\nThe revolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a military\r\nprovisionary power, and no definitive constitution of government has yet\r\nbeen established in New Granada in place of that organized by the\r\nconstitution of 1858. The minister of the United States to the Granadian\r\nConfederacy, who was appointed on the 29th day of May, 1861, was\r\ndirected, in view of the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary\r\nparty and of the uncertainty of the civil war, not to present his\r\ncredentials to either the Government of the Granadian Confederacy or to\r\nthe provisional military Government, but to conduct his affairs\r\ninformally, as is customary in such cases, and to report the progress of\r\nevents and await the instructions of this Government. The advices which\r\nhave been received from him have not hitherto been sufficiently\r\nconclusive to determine me to recognize the revolutionary Government.\r\nGeneral Herran being here, with full authority from the Government of\r\nNew Granada, which had been so long recognized by the United States, I\r\nhave not received any representative from the revolutionary Government,\r\nwhich has not yet been recognized, because such a proceeding would in\r\nitself be an act of recognition.\r\n\r\nOfficial communications have been had on various incidental and\r\noccasional questions with General Herran as the minister plenipotentiary\r\nand envoy extraordinary of the Granadian Confederacy, but in no other\r\ncharacter. No definitive measure or proceeding has resulted from these\r\ncommunications, and a communication of them at present would not, in my\r\njudgment, be compatible with the public interest.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1863.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have signed the joint resolution to provide for the immediate payment\r\nof the Army and Navy of the United States, passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives on the 14th and by the Senate on the 15th instant.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution is a simple authority, amounting, however, under\r\nexisting circumstances, to a direction, to the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto make an additional issue of $100,000,000 in United States notes, if\r\nso much money is needed, for the payment of the Army and Navy.\r\n\r\nMy approval is given in order that every possible facility may be\r\nafforded for the prompt discharge of all arrears of pay due to our\r\nsoldiers and our sailors.\r\n\r\nWhile giving this approval, however, I think it my duty to express my\r\nsincere regret that it has been found necessary to authorize so large an\r\nadditional issue of United States notes, when this circulation and that\r\nof the suspended banks together have become already so redundant as to\r\nincrease prices beyond real values, thereby augmenting the cost of\r\nliving to the injury of labor, and the cost of supplies to the injury of\r\nthe whole country.\r\n\r\nIt seems very plain that continued issues of United States notes without\r\nany check to the issues of suspended banks and without adequate\r\nprovision for the raising of money by loans and for funding the issues\r\nso as to keep them within due limits must soon produce disastrous\r\nconsequences; and this matter appears to me so important that I feel\r\nbound to avail myself of this occasion to ask the special attention of\r\nCongress to it.\r\n\r\nThat Congress has power to regulate the currency of the country can\r\nhardly admit of doubt, and that a judicious measure to prevent the\r\ndeterioration of this currency, by a seasonable taxation of bank\r\ncirculation or otherwise, is needed seems equally clear. Independently\r\nof this general consideration, it would be unjust to the people at large\r\nto exempt banks enjoying the special privilege of circulation from their\r\njust proportion of the public burdens.\r\n\r\nIn order to raise money by way of loans most easily and cheaply, it is\r\nclearly necessary to give every possible support to the public credit.\r\nTo that end a uniform currency, in which taxes, subscriptions to loans,\r\nand all other ordinary public dues, as well as all private dues, may be\r\npaid, is almost, if not quite, indispensable. Such a currency can be\r\nfurnished by banking associations, organized under a general act of\r\nCongress, as suggested in my message at the beginning of the present\r\nsession. The securing of this circulation by the pledge of United States\r\nbonds, as therein suggested, would still further facilitate loans by\r\nincreasing the present and causing a future demand for such bonds.\r\n\r\nIn view of the actual financial embarrassments of the Government and of\r\nthe greater embarrassments sure to come if the necessary means of relief\r\nbe not afforded, I feel that I should not perform my duty by a simple\r\nannouncement of my approval of the joint resolution, which proposes\r\nrelief only by increasing circulation, without expressing my earnest\r\ndesire that measures such in substance as those I have just referred to\r\nmay receive the early sanction of Congress.\r\n\r\nBy such measures, in my opinion, will payment be most certainly secured,\r\nnot only to the Army and Navy, but to all honest creditors of the\r\nGovernment, and satisfactory provision made for future demands on the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to\r\nthe resolution of the Senate relative to the correspondence between this\r\nGovernment and the Mexican minister in relation to the exportation of\r\narticles contraband of war for the use of the French army in Mexico.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, January 21, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith, for your consideration, the joint resolutions of the\r\ncorporate authorities of the city of Washington adopted September 27,\r\n1862, and a memorial of the same under date of October 28, 1862, both\r\nrelating to and urging the construction of certain railroads\r\nconcentrating upon the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nIn presenting this memorial and the joint resolutions to you I am not\r\nprepared to say more than that the subject is one of great practical\r\nimportance and that I hope it will receive the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of Congress, a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, transmitting the regulations, decrees, and orders\r\nfor the government of the United States consular courts in Turkey.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 26, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 13th instant,\r\nrequesting a copy of certain correspondence respecting the capture of\r\nBritish vessels sailing from one British port to another having on board\r\ncontraband of war intended for the use of the insurgents, I have the\r\nhonor to transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents\r\nby which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 28, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Commander David D. Porter, United States Navy, acting rear-admiral,\r\ncommanding the Mississippi Squadron, receive a vote of thanks of\r\nCongress for the bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post\r\nof Arkansas, which surrendered to the combined military and naval forces\r\non the 10th instant.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 4, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n5th December last, requesting information upon the present condition of\r\nMexico, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the papers\r\nby which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 4, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress approved 3d February,\r\n1863, tendering its thanks to Commander John L. Worden, United States\r\nNavy, I nominate that officer to be a captain in the Navy on the active\r\nlist from the 3d February, 1863.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to state that the number of captains authorized by the\r\nsecond section of the act of 16th July, 1862, is now full, but presuming\r\nthat the meaning of the ninth section of the same act is that the\r\nofficer receiving the vote of thanks shall immediately be advanced one\r\ngrade I have made the nomination.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 5, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification, a\r\n\"convention between the United States of America and the Republic of\r\nPeru for the settlement of the pending claims of the citizens of either\r\ncountry against the other,\" signed at Lima on the 12th January ultimo,\r\nwith the following amendment:\r\n\r\nArticle 1, strike out the words \"the claims of the American citizens Dr.\r\nCharles Easton, Edmund Sartori, and the owners of the whale ship\r\n_William Lee_ against the Government of Peru, and the Peruvian citizen\r\nStephen Montano against the Government of the United States,\" and\r\ninsert: _all claims of citizens of the United States against the\r\nGovernment of Peru and of citizens of Peru against the Government of the\r\nUnited States which have not been embraced in conventional or diplomatic\r\nagreement between the two Governments or their plenipotentiaries, and\r\nstatements of which soliciting the interposition of either Government\r\nmay previously to the exchange of the ratifications of this convention\r\nhave been filed in the Department of State at Washington or the\r\ndepartment for foreign affairs at Lima_, etc.\r\n\r\nThis amendment is considered desirable, as there are believed to be\r\nother claims proper for the consideration of the commission which are\r\nnot among those specified in the original article, and because it is at\r\nleast questionable whether either Government would be justified in\r\nincurring the expense of a commission for the sole purpose of disposing\r\nof the claims mentioned in that article.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 5, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na \"convention between the United States of America and the Republic of\r\nPeru, providing for the reference to the King of Belgium of the claims\r\narising out of the capture and confiscation of the ships _Lizzie\r\nThompson_ and _Georgiana_,\" signed at Lima on the 20th December, 1862.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 6, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the United States of\r\nyesterday, requesting information in regard to the death of General\r\nWard, a citizen of the United States in the military service of the\r\nChinese Government, I transmit a copy of a dispatch of the 27th of\r\nOctober last, its accompaniment, from the minister of the United States\r\nin China.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 6, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report[7] from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying documents, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of the\r\n30th ultimo.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Relating to the building of ships of war for the Japanese\r\nGovernment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 10, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of yesterday, requesting\r\ninformation touching the visit of Mr. Mercier to Richmond in April last,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, to whom the resolution\r\nwas referred.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 12, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September, 1862, Commander George Henry Preble, United\r\nStates Navy, then senior officer in command of the naval force off the\r\nharbor of Mobile, was guilty of inexcusable neglect in permitting the\r\narmed steamer _Oreto_ in open daylight to run the blockade. For his\r\nomission to perform his whole duty on that occasion and the injury\r\nthereby inflicted on the service and the country, his name was stricken\r\nfrom the list of naval officers and he was dismissed the service.\r\n\r\nSince his dismissal earnest application has been made for his\r\nrestoration to his former position by Senators and naval officers, on\r\nthe ground that his fault was an error of judgment, and that the example\r\nin his case has already had its effect in preventing a repetition of\r\nsimilar neglect.\r\n\r\nI therefore, on this application and representation, and in\r\nconsideration of his previous fair record, do hereby nominate George\r\nHenry Preble to be a commander in the Navy from the 16th July, 1862, to\r\ntake rank on the active list next after Commander Edward Donaldson, and\r\nto fill a vacancy occasioned by the death of Commander J.M. Wainwright.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 12, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 24th August, 1861, Commander Roger Perry, United States Navy,\r\nwas dismissed from the service under a misapprehension in regard to his\r\nloyalty to the Government, from the circumstance that several oaths\r\nwere transmitted to him and the Navy Department failed to receive any\r\nrecognition of them. After his dismissal, and upon his assurance that\r\nthe oath failed to reach him and his readiness to execute it, he was\r\nrecommissioned to his original position on the 4th September following.\r\nOn the same day, 4th September, he was ordered to command the sloop of\r\nwar _Vandalia_; on the 22d this order was revoked and he was ordered to\r\nduty in the Mississippi Squadron, and on the 23d January, 1862, was\r\ndetached sick, and has since remained unemployed. The advisory board\r\nunder the act of 16th July, 1862, did not recommend him for further\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nThis last commission, having been issued during the recess of the\r\nSenate, expired at the end of the succeeding session, 17th July, 1862,\r\nfrom which date, not having been nominated to the Senate, he ceased to\r\nbe a commander in the Navy.\r\n\r\nTo correct the omission to nominate this officer to the Senate at its\r\nlast session, I now nominate Commander Roger Perry to be a commander in\r\nthe Navy from the 14th September, 1855, to take his relative position on\r\nthe list of commanders not recommended for further promotion.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 10th instant,\r\nrequesting information on the subjects of mediation, arbitration,\r\nor other measures looking to the termination of the existing civil\r\nwar, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents\r\nby which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of the 12th\r\ninstant, the accompanying report[8] from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Relating to the use of negroes by the French army in Mexico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1863_.\r\n\r\nHon. GALUSHA A. GROW,\r\n\r\n_Speaker of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I herewith communicate to the House of Representatives, in answer\r\nto their resolution of the 18th of December last, a report from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, containing all the information in the\r\npossession of the Department respecting the causes of the recent\r\noutbreaks of the Indian tribes in the Northwest which has not\r\nheretofore been transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE, _February 17, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the constitutional action of the Senate\r\nthereon, a treaty made and concluded on the 3d day of February, 1863,\r\nbetween W.W. Ross, commissioner on the part of the United States, and\r\nthe chiefs and headmen of the Pottawatomie Nation of Indians of Kansas,\r\nwhich, it appears from the accompanying letter from the Secretary of the\r\nInterior of the 17th instant, is intended to be amendatory of the treaty\r\nconcluded with said Indians on the 15th November, 1862.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to its\r\nratification, an additional article to the treaty between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain of the 7th of April, 1862, for the suppression\r\nof the African slave trade, which was concluded and signed at Washington\r\non the 17th instant by the Secretary of State and Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's minister accredited to this Government.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 19, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nCongress on my recommendation passed a resolution, approved 7th\r\nFebruary, 1863, tendering its thanks to Commodore Charles Henry Davis\r\nfor \"distinguished service in conflict with the enemy at Fort Pillow, at\r\nMemphis, and for successful operations at other points in the waters of\r\nthe Mississippi River.\"\r\n\r\nI therefore, in conformity with the seventh section of the act approved\r\n16th July, 1862, nominate Commodore Charles Henry Davis to be a\r\nrear-admiral in the Navy on the active list from the 7th February, 1863.\r\n\r\nCaptain John A. Dahlgren having in said resolution of the 7th February\r\nin like manner received the thanks of Congress \"for distinguished\r\nservice in the line of his profession, improvements in ordnance, and\r\nzealous and efficient labors in the ordnance branch of the service,\" I\r\ntherefore, in conformity with the seventh section of the act of 16th\r\nJuly, 1862, nominate Captain John A. Dahlgren to be a rear-admiral in\r\nthe Navy on the active list from the 7th February, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe ninth section of the act of July, 1862, authorizes \"any line officer\r\nof the Navy or Marine Corps to be advanced one grade if upon\r\nrecommendation of the President by name he receives the thanks of\r\nCongress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy or\r\nfor extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession,\" and Captain\r\nStephen C. Rowan and Commander David D. Porter having each on my\r\nrecommendation received the thanks of Congress for distinguished\r\nservice, by resolution or the 7th February, 1863, I do therefore\r\nnominate Captain Stephen C. Rowan to be a commodore in the Navy on the\r\nactive list from the 7th February, 1863. Commander David D. Porter to be\r\na captain in the Navy on the active list from the 7th February, 1863.\r\n\r\nIf this nomination should be confirmed, there will be vacancies in the\r\nseveral grades to which these officers are nominated for promotion.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, February 25, 1863_.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE.\r\n\r\nSIR: In answer to the Senate resolution of the 21st instant, I have\r\nthe honor to inclose herewith a letter of the 24th instant from the\r\nSecretary of War, by which it appears that there are 438 assistant\r\nquartermasters, 387 commissaries of subsistence, and 343 additional\r\npaymasters now in the volunteer service, including those before the\r\nSenate for confirmation.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _February 25, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate Passed Midshipmen Samuel Pearce and Nathaniel T. West, now on\r\nthe retired list, to be ensigns in the Navy on the retired list.\r\n\r\nThese nominations are made in conformity with the fourth section of the\r\nact to amend an act entitled \"An act to promote the efficiency of the\r\nNavy,\" approved 16th January, 1857, and are induced by the following\r\nconsiderations:\r\n\r\nThe pay of a passed midshipman on the retired list as fixed by the \"Act\r\nfor the better organization of the military establishment,\" approved 3d\r\nAugust, 1861, amounted, including rations, to $788 per annum. By the\r\n\"Act to establish and equalize the grade of line officers of the United\r\nStates Navy,\" approved 16th July, 1862, the grade or rank of passed\r\nmidshipman, which was the next below that of master, was discontinued\r\nand that of ensign was established, being now the next grade below that\r\nof master and the only grade in the line list between those of master\r\nand midshipman. The same act fixes the pay of officers on the retired\r\nlist, omitting the grade of passed midshipman, and prohibits the\r\nallowance of rations to retired officers. The effect of this was to\r\nreduce the pay of a passed midshipman on the retired list from $788 to\r\n$350 per annum, or less than half of previous rate.\r\n\r\nThis was no doubt an unintended result of the law, operating exclusively\r\non the two passed midshipmen then on the retired list, and their\r\npromotion or transfer to the equivalent grade of ensign would not\r\ncompletely indemnify them, the pay of an ensign on the retired list\r\nbeing only $500 per annum. It is the only relief, however, which is\r\ndeemed within the intention of the existing laws, and it is the more\r\nwillingly recommended in this case, as there is nothing in the character\r\nof the officers to be relieved which would make it objectionable. These\r\nare the only cases of the kind.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 26th instant,\r\nrequesting a copy of any correspondence which may have taken place\r\nbetween me and workingmen in England, I transmit the papers mentioned in\r\nthe subjoined list.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of Congress, a dispatch to the\r\nSecretary of State from the United States consul at Liverpool, and the\r\naddress to which it refers, of the distressed operatives of Blackburn,\r\nin England, to the New York relief committee and to the inhabitants of\r\nthe United States generally.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a preamble and joint resolution of the\r\nlegislative assembly of the Territory of New Mexico, accepting the\r\nbenefits of the act of Congress approved the 2d of July last, entitled\r\n\"An act donating public lands to the several States and Territories\r\nwhich may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the\r\nmechanic arts.\"\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas on the 22d day of September, A.D. 1862, a proclamation was\r\nissued by the President of the United States, containing, among other\r\nthings, the following, to wit:\r\n\r\n  That on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons held as slaves\r\n  within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof\r\n  shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then,\r\n  thenceforward, and forever free;

Although you were not successful, the attempt\r\nwas not an error nor the failure other than an accident. The courage\r\nwith which you in an open field maintained the contest against an\r\nintrenched foe and the consummate skill and success with which you\r\ncrossed and recrossed the river in face of the enemy show that you\r\npossess all the qualities of a great army, which will yet give victory\r\nto the cause of the country and of popular government.

We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of\r\nHeaven; we have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity;\r\nwe have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever\r\ngrown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand\r\nwhich preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened\r\nus, and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts,\r\nthat all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and\r\nvirtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too\r\nself-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace,\r\ntoo proud to pray to the God that made us.\r\n\r\nIt behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to\r\nconfess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, in compliance with the request, and fully concurring in\r\nthe views of the Senate, I do by this my proclamation designate and set\r\napart Thursday, the 30th day of April, 1863, as a day of national\r\nhumiliation, fasting, and prayer.

But\r\nthese victories have been accorded not without sacrifices of life, limb,\r\nhealth, and liberty, incurred by brave, loyal, and patriotic citizens.\r\nDomestic affliction in every part of the country follows in the train of\r\nthese fearful bereavements. It is meet and right to recognize and\r\nconfess the presence of the Almighty Father and the power of His hand\r\nequally in these triumphs and in these sorrows:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I do set apart Thursday, the 6th day of\r\nAugust next, to be observed as a day for national thanksgiving, praise,\r\nand prayer, and I invite the people of the United States to assemble on\r\nthat occasion in their customary places of worship and in the forms\r\napproved by their own consciences render the homage due to the Divine\r\nMajesty for the wonderful things He has done in the nation's behalf and\r\ninvoke the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue the anger which has\r\nproduced and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion, to change\r\nthe hearts of the insurgents, to guide the counsels of the Government\r\nwith wisdom adequate to so great a national emergency, and to visit with\r\ntender care and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our\r\nland all those who, through the vicissitudes of marches, voyages,\r\nbattles, and sieges, have been brought to suffer in mind, body, or\r\nestate, and finally to lead the whole nation through the paths of\r\nrepentance and submission to the divine will back to the perfect\r\nenjoyment of union and fraternal peace.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 15th day of July, A.D. 1863, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

And I do\r\nhereby require all magistrates, attorneys, and other civil officers\r\nwithin the United States and all officers and others in the military and\r\nnaval services of the United States to take distinct notice of this\r\nsuspension and to give it full effect, and all citizens of the United\r\nStates to conduct and govern themselves accordingly and in conformity\r\nwith the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress in\r\nsuch case made and provided.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed this 15th day of September, A.D. 1863,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States of America the\r\neighty-eighth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas in my proclamation of the 27th of April, 1861, the ports of the\r\nStates of Virginia and North Carolina were, for reasons therein set\r\nforth, placed under blockade; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the port of Alexandria, Va., has since been blockaded, but as\r\nthe blockade of said port may now be safely relaxed with advantage to\r\nthe interests of commerce:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth\r\nsection of the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861,\r\nentitled \"An act further to provide for the collection of duties on\r\nimports and for other purposes,\" do hereby declare that the blockade of\r\nthe said port of Alexandria shall so far cease and determine from and\r\nafter this date that commercial intercourse with said port, except as to\r\npersons, things, and information contraband of war, may from this date\r\nbe carried on, subject to the laws of the United States and to the\r\nlimitations and in pursuance of the regulations which are prescribed by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury in his order which is appended to my\r\nproclamation of the 12th of May, 1862.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 24th day of September, A.D. 1863,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nThe year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the\r\nblessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties,\r\nwhich are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the\r\nsource from which they come, others have been added which are of so\r\nextraordinary a nature that they can not fail to penetrate and soften\r\neven the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful\r\nprovidence of Almighty God.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which\r\nhas sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and to provoke their\r\naggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been\r\nmaintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has\r\nprevailed everywhere, except in the theater of military conflict, while\r\nthat theater has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and\r\nnavies of the Union.\r\n\r\nNeedful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of\r\npeaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow,\r\nthe shuttle, or the ship; the ax has enlarged the borders of our\r\nsettlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious\r\nmetals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population\r\nhas steadily increased notwithstanding the waste that has been made in\r\nthe camp, the siege, and the battlefield, and the country, rejoicing in\r\nthe consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to\r\nexpect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.\r\n\r\nNo human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these\r\ngreat things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who,\r\nwhile dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless\r\nremembered mercy.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly,\r\nreverently, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and one\r\nvoice, by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my\r\nfellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who\r\nare at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart\r\nand observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving\r\nand praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And\r\nI recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due\r\nto Him for such singular deliverances and blessings they do also, with\r\nhumble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend\r\nto His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners,\r\nor sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably\r\nengaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand\r\nto heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it, as soon as may be\r\nconsistent with the divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace,\r\nharmony, tranquillity, and union.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 3d day of October, A.D. 1863, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

COFFEY,\r\n\r\n_Attorney-General ad interim_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 4, 1863--10 a.m._\r\n\r\nThe President announces to the country that news from the Army of the\r\nPotomac up to 10 o'clock p.m. of the 3d is such as to cover that army\r\nwith the highest honor, to promise a great success to the cause of the\r\nUnion, and to claim the condolence of all for the many gallant fallen;\r\nand that for this he especially desires that on this day He whose will,\r\nnot ours, should ever be done be everywhere remembered and ever\r\nreverenced with profoundest gratitude.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 211.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 9, 1863_.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER ABOLISHING MILITARY GOVERNORSHIP OF ARKANSAS.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That the appointment of John S. Phelps as military governor\r\nof the State of Arkansas and of Amos F. Eno as secretary be revoked, and\r\nthe office of military governor in said State is abolished, and that all\r\nauthority, appointments, and power heretofore granted to and exercised\r\nby them, or either of them, as military governor or secretary, or by any\r\nperson or persons appointed by or acting under them, is hereby revoked\r\nand annulled.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nE.D. TOWNSEND,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 25, 1863_.\r\n\r\nHon. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\nSIR: Certain matters have come to my notice, and considered by me, which\r\ninduce me to believe that it will conduce to the public interest for you\r\nto add to the general instructions given to our naval commanders in\r\nrelation to contraband trade propositions substantially as follows, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\nFirst. You will avoid the reality, and as far as possible the\r\nappearance, of using any neutral port to watch neutral vessels, and then\r\nto dart out and seize them on their departure.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Complaint is made that this has been practiced at the port of St.\r\nThomas, which practice, if it exists, is disapproved and must cease.\r\n\r\nSecond. You will not in any case detain the crew of a captured neutral\r\nvessel or any other subject of a neutral power on board such vessel, as\r\nprisoners of war or otherwise, except the small number necessary as\r\nwitnesses in the prize court.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The practice here forbidden is also charged to exist, which, if\r\ntrue, is disapproved and must cease.\r\n\r\nMy dear sir, it is not intended to be insinuated that you have, been\r\nremiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your\r\nDepartment, which, I take pleasure in affirming, has in your hands been\r\nconducted with admirable success. Yet, while your subordinates are\r\nalmost of necessity brought into angry collision with the subjects of\r\nforeign states, the representatives of those states and yourself do not\r\ncome into immediate contact for the purpose of keeping the peace, in\r\nspite of such collisions. At that point there is an ultimate and heavy\r\nresponsibility upon me.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is in strict accordance with international law, and is\r\ntherefore unobjectionable; whilst, if it does no other good, it will\r\ncontribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present British\r\nministry in their places, who, if displaced, are sure to be replaced by\r\nothers more unfavorable to us.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 30, 1863_.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens,\r\nof whatever class, color, or condition, and especially to those who are\r\nduly organized as soldiers in the public service. The law of nations and\r\nthe usages and customs of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit\r\nno distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as\r\npublic enemies. To sell or enslave any captured person on account of his\r\ncolor, and for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into\r\nbarbarism and a crime against the civilization of the age.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States will give the same protection to all\r\nits soldiers, and if the enemy shall sell or enslave anyone because of\r\nhis color the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's\r\nprisoners in our possession.\r\n\r\n_It is therefore ordered_, That for every soldier of the United States\r\nkilled in violation of the laws of war a rebel soldier shall be\r\nexecuted, and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery\r\na rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works and\r\ncontinued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive\r\nthe treatment due to a prisoner of war.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, August 25, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, first. That clearances issued by the Treasury Department for\r\nvessels or merchandise bound for the port of New Orleans for the\r\nmilitary necessities of the department, certified by Brigadier-General\r\nShepley, the military governor of Louisiana, shall be allowed to enter\r\nsaid port.\r\n\r\nSecond. That vessels and domestic produce from New Orleans permitted by\r\nthe military governor of Louisiana at New Orleans for the military\r\npurpose of his department shall on his permit be allowed to pass from\r\nsaid port to its destination to any port not blockaded by the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, August 31, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That the Executive order of November 21, 1862, prohibiting\r\nthe exportation of arms, ammunition, or munitions of war from the United\r\nStates, be, and the same hereby is, modified so far as to permit the\r\nexportation of imported arms, ammunition, and munitions of war to the\r\nports whence they were shipped for the United States.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\n[EDWIN M. STANTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, September 4, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, That the Executive order dated November 21, 1862, prohibiting\r\nthe exportation from the United States of arms, ammunition, or munitions\r\nof war, under which the commandants of departments were, by order of the\r\nSecretary of War dated May 13, 1863, directed to prohibit the purchase\r\nand sale for exportation from the United States of all horses and mules\r\nwithin their respective commands, and to take and appropriate to the use\r\nof the United States any horses, mules, and live stock designed for\r\nexportation, be so far modified that any arms heretofore imported into\r\nthe United States may be reexported to the place of original shipment,\r\nand that any live stock raised in any State or Territory bounded by the\r\nPacific Ocean may be exported from any port of such State or Territory.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, September 24, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered by the President of the United States_, That Major-General\r\nHooker be, and he is hereby, authorized to take military possession of\r\nall railroads, with their cars, locomotives, plants, and equipments,\r\nthat may be necessary for the execution of the military operation\r\ncommitted to his charge; and all officers, agents, and employees of said\r\nroads are directed to render their aid and assistance therein and to\r\nrespect and obey his commands, pursuant to the act of Congress in such\r\ncase made and provided.\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, November 10, 1863_.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the peculiar circumstances and pursuant to the\r\ncomity deemed to be due to friendly powers, any tobacco in the United\r\nStates belonging to the government either of France, Austria, or any\r\nother state with which this country is at peace, and which tobacco was\r\npurchased and paid for by such government prior to the 4th day of March,\r\n1861, may be exported from any port of the United States under the\r\nsupervision and upon the responsibility of naval officers of such\r\ngovernments and in conformity to such regulations as may be presented\r\nby the Secretary of State of the United States, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 8, 1863.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAnother year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvests has passed.\r\nFor these, and especially for the improved condition of our national\r\naffairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due.\r\n\r\nWe remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in\r\nforeign wars to aid an inexcusable insurrection have been unavailing.\r\nHer Britannic Majesty's Government, as was justly expected, have\r\nexercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile\r\nexpeditions from British ports. The Emperor of France has by a like\r\nproceeding promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the\r\nbeginning of the contest. Questions of great intricacy and importance\r\nhave arisen out of the blockade and other belligerent operations between\r\nthe Government and several of the maritime powers, but they have been\r\ndiscussed and, as far as was possible, accommodated in a spirit of\r\nfrankness, justice, and mutual good will. It is especially gratifying\r\nthat our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudications, have\r\ncommanded the respect and confidence of maritime powers.\r\n\r\nThe supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for\r\nthe suppression of the African slave trade, made on the 17th day of\r\nFebruary last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It is\r\nbelieved that so far as American ports and American citizens are\r\nconcerned that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end.\r\n\r\nI shall submit for the consideration of the Senate a convention for the\r\nadjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory arising out of\r\nthe treaty of the 15th June, 1846, between the United States and Great\r\nBritain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the\r\ncitizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country.\r\n\r\nA novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime\r\njurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba,\r\nhas been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed in an\r\namicable spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power. A\r\nconvention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to\r\nconcur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the\r\nliquidation of the Scheldt dues, upon the principles which have been\r\nheretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the\r\nwaters of Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending controversy between this Government and that of Chile\r\ntouching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru, by Chilean officers, of a large\r\namount in treasure belonging to citizens of the United States has been\r\nbrought to a close by the award of His Majesty the King of the Belgians,\r\nto whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties. The\r\nsubject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected\r\nmagistrate, and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have\r\nbeen as large as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom\r\nof His Majesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by\r\nChile when intelligence in regard to it reached that country.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the act of the last session for carrying into\r\neffect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims has been\r\norganized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it.\r\n\r\nDifficulties concerning interoceanic transit through Nicaragua are in\r\ncourse of amicable adjustment.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, I\r\nhave received a representative from the United States of Colombia, and\r\nhave accredited a minister to that Republic.\r\n\r\nIncidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my\r\nattention the uncertain state of international questions touching the\r\nrights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens\r\nabroad. In regard to some governments these rights are at least\r\npartially defined by treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly\r\nstipulated that in the event of civil war a foreigner residing in this\r\ncountry within the lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the\r\nrule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf the Government\r\nof his country can not expect any privileges or immunities distinct from\r\nthat character. I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put\r\nforward, and in some instances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in\r\nthe United States the greater part of their lives.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries\r\nwho have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been\r\nfully naturalized, have evaded the military duty required of them by\r\ndenying the fact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden of\r\nproof. It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this\r\nproof, from the want of guides to the proper sources of information.\r\nThese might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts where declarations\r\nof intention may be made or naturalizations effected to send\r\nperiodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized or declaring\r\ntheir intention to become citizens to the Secretary of the Interior, in\r\nwhose Department those names might be arranged and printed for general\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThere is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become\r\ncitizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties\r\nimposed by the laws of their native countries, to which on becoming\r\nnaturalized here they at once repair, and though never returning to the\r\nUnited States they still claim the interposition of this Government as\r\ncitizens. Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen\r\nout of this abuse. It is therefore submitted to your serious\r\nconsideration. It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no\r\ncitizen of the United States residing abroad may claim the interposition\r\nof his Government.\r\n\r\nThe right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens\r\nunder pretenses of naturalization, which they have disavowed when\r\ndrafted into the military service. I submit the expediency of such an\r\namendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppel against\r\nany plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on\r\nthe ground of alienage.\r\n\r\nIn common with other Western powers, our relations with Japan have been\r\nbrought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the\r\nhereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal\r\npolicy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of\r\nnations. It is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these\r\ndifficulties may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to the\r\nclaim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the\r\ndestruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Yedo.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia,\r\nwhich, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line of\r\ntelegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an\r\ninternational telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a\r\ntelegraph between this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic\r\nseaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. Such communications, established with\r\nany reasonable outlay, would be economical as well as effective aids to\r\nthe diplomatic, military, and naval service.\r\n\r\nThe consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the\r\nlast Congress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope\r\nthat it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will\r\nensue whenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have been\r\nfaithful in defending American rights. In protecting commercial\r\ninterests our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased labors\r\nand responsibilities growing out of the war. These they have for the\r\nmost part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency. This\r\nacknowledgment justly includes those consuls who, residing in Morocco,\r\nEgypt, Turkey, Japan, China, and other Oriental countries, are charged\r\nwith complex functions and extraordinary powers.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the several organized Territories is generally\r\nsatisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been\r\nentirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho,\r\nNew Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore\r\nunderstood. I lay before you a communication on this subject from the\r\ngovernor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration the\r\nexpediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of\r\nimmigration. Although this source of national wealth and strength is\r\nagain flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the\r\ninsurrection occurred, there is still a great deficiency of laborers in\r\nevery field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as\r\nwell of iron and coal as of the precious metals. While the demand for\r\nlabor is much increased here, tens of thousands of persons, destitute of\r\nremunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates and\r\noffering to emigrate to the United States if essential, but very cheap,\r\nassistance can be afforded them. It is easy to see that under the sharp\r\ndiscipline of civil war the nation is beginning a new life. This noble\r\neffort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nInjuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended may in some cases\r\nhave been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries,\r\nboth at sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United States.\r\nAs this Government expects redress from other powers when similar\r\ninjuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the\r\nUnited States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If the\r\nexisting judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special\r\ncourt may be authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of\r\nthe character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the\r\npublic law. Conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission\r\nhave been proposed to some governments, but no definitive answer to the\r\nproposition has yet been received from any.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to request\r\nyou to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution\r\nhave been rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts, and in other\r\ncases where this Government may be acknowledged to be liable in\r\nprinciple and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by\r\nan informal arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by\r\nthe law of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the\r\nincomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not\r\nin strictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing\r\ntreaty between the United States and a foreign country, the expediency\r\nof so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such\r\nconsuls as are not citizens of the United States, derived from the\r\nemoluments of their office or from property not situated in the United\r\nStates, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make this\r\nsuggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated\r\nexempts our consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extent\r\nthus indicated. The United States, I think, ought not to be\r\nexceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Treasury during the last year have been\r\nsuccessfully conducted. The enactment by Congress of a national banking\r\nlaw has proved a valuable support of the public credit, and the general\r\nlegislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of\r\nits favorers. Some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws,\r\nbut no change in their principles or general scope is believed to be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nSince these measures have been in operation all demands on the Treasury,\r\nincluding the pay of the Army and Navy, have been promptly met and fully\r\nsatisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is believed, were ever\r\nmore amply provided and more liberally and punctually paid, and it may\r\nbe added that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever\r\nmore cheerfully borne.\r\n\r\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, including loans and\r\nbalance in the Treasury at its commencement, were $901,125,674.86, and\r\nthe aggregate disbursements $895,796,630.65, leaving a balance on the\r\n1st of July, 1863, of $5,329,044.21. Of the receipts there were derived\r\nfrom customs $69,059,642.40, from internal revenue $37,640,787.95, from\r\ndirect tax $1,485,103.61, from lands $167,617.17, from miscellaneous\r\nsources $3,046,615.35, and from loans $776,682,361.57, making the\r\naggregate $901,125,674.86. Of the disbursements there were for the civil\r\nservice $23,253,922.08, for pensions and Indians $4,216,520.79, for\r\ninterest on public debt $24,729,846.51, for the War Department\r\n$599,298,600.83, for the Navy Department $63,211,105.27, for payment of\r\nfunded and temporary debt $181,086,635.07, making the aggregate\r\n$895,796,630.65 and leaving the balance of $5,329,044.21. But the\r\npayment of funded and temporary debt, having been made from moneys\r\nborrowed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal payments\r\nand the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts, and\r\ntheir amount, $181,086,635.07, should therefore be deducted both from\r\nreceipts and disbursements. This being done there remains as actual\r\nreceipts $720,039,039.79 and the actual disbursements $714,709,995.58,\r\nleaving the balance as already stated.\r\n\r\nThe actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three quarters of\r\nthe current fiscal year (1864) will be shown in detail by the report of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It is\r\nsufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results will\r\nexhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the\r\nestimates of that officer heretofore submitted, while it is confidently\r\nexpected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will\r\nbe found very considerably less than has been anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest. It\r\nconsists of--\r\n\r\n1. The military operations of the year, detailed in the report of the\r\nGeneral in Chief.\r\n\r\n2. The organization of colored persons into the war service.\r\n\r\n3. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter of General\r\nHitchcock.\r\n\r\n4. The operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the\r\nnational forces, detailed in the report of the Provost-Marshal-General.\r\n\r\n5. The organization of the invalid corps, and\r\n\r\n6. The operation of the several departments of the\r\nQuartermaster-General, Commissary-General, Paymaster-General, Chief of\r\nEngineers, Chief of Ordnance, and Surgeon-General.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report,\r\nexcept such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I content\r\nmyself by asking your careful attention to the report itself.\r\n\r\nThe duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year\r\nand throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged\r\nwith fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been\r\nconstantly increasing in efficiency as the Navy has expanded, yet on so\r\nlong a line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit\r\ntrade. From returns received at the Navy Department it appears that more\r\nthan 1,000 vessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted,\r\nand that the value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to\r\nover $13,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe naval force of the United States consists at this time of 588\r\nvessels completed and in the course of completion, and of these 75 are\r\nironclad or armored steamers. The events of the war give an increased\r\ninterest and importance to the Navy which will probably extend beyond\r\nthe war itself.\r\n\r\nThe armored vessels in our Navy completed and in service, or which are\r\nunder contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in\r\nnumber those of any other power; but while these may be relied upon for\r\nharbor defense and coast service, others of greater strength and\r\ncapacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our\r\nrightful position on the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since\r\nthe introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war demands\r\neither a corresponding change in some of our existing navy-yards or the\r\nestablishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repair of\r\nmodern naval vessels. No inconsiderable embarrassment, delay, and public\r\ninjury have been experienced from the want of such governmental\r\nestablishments. The necessity of such a navy-yard, so furnished, at some\r\nsuitable place upon the Atlantic seaboard has on repeated occasions been\r\nbrought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is\r\nagain presented in the report of the Secretary which accompanies this\r\ncommunication. I think it my duty to invite your special attention to\r\nthis subject, and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for\r\nnaval purposes upon one of the Western rivers. A naval force has been\r\ncreated on those interior waters, and under many disadvantages, within\r\nlittle more than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force\r\nof the country at the commencement of the present Administration.\r\nSatisfactory and important as have been the performances of the heroic\r\nmen of the Navy at this interesting period, they are scarcely more\r\nwonderful than the success of our mechanics and artisans in the\r\nproduction of war vessels, which has created a new form of naval power.\r\n\r\nOur country has advantages superior to any other nation in our resources\r\nof iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of both, and all available and in close proximity to\r\nnavigable waters. Without the advantage of public works, the resources\r\nof the nation have been developed and its power displayed in the\r\nconstruction of a Navy of such magnitude, which has at the very period\r\nof its creation rendered signal service to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7,500\r\nmen in the spring of 1861 to about 34,000 at the present time has been\r\naccomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to\r\npromote that increase. It has been found, however, that the operation of\r\nthe draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, is beginning\r\nto affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not corrected, be\r\nlikely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper\r\nvocation and inducing them to enter the Army. I therefore respectfully\r\nsuggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval services by a\r\ndefinite provision on this subject which would at the same time be\r\nequitable to the communities more especially interested.\r\n\r\nI commend to your consideration the suggestions of the Secretary of the\r\nNavy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and also\r\nthe education of officers and engineers for the naval service. The Naval\r\nAcademy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the\r\nhighly responsible duties which in after life they will be required to\r\nperform. In order that the country should not be deprived of the proper\r\nquota of educated officers, for which legal provision has been made at\r\nthe naval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to\r\nmake nominations from the States in insurrection have been filled by the\r\nSecretary of the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than at\r\nany former period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the past fiscal year the financial condition of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in\r\nbeing able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled\r\nthe entire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84 and the\r\nformer to $11,163,789.59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. In\r\n1860, the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency\r\namounted to $5,656,705.49, the postal receipts of that year being\r\n$2,645,722.19 less than those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the\r\nannual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent, but the\r\nannual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced 35 per cent.\r\nIt is manifest, therefore, that the Post-Office Department may become\r\nself-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe international conference of postal delegates from the principal\r\ncountries of Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion of\r\nthe Postmaster-General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last and\r\nconcluded its deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles\r\nestablished by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal\r\nintercourse between nations and as the basis of future postal\r\nconventions inaugurate a general system of uniform international charges\r\nat reduced rates of postage, and can not fail to produce beneficial\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is\r\nherewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in relation\r\nto the public lands, Indian affairs, patents, pensions, and other\r\nmatters of public concern pertaining to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter\r\nof the present fiscal years was 3,841,549 acres, of which 161,911 acres\r\nwere sold for cash, 1,456,514 acres were taken up under the homestead\r\nlaw, and the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military\r\nbounties, for railroad and other purposes. It also appears that the sale\r\nof the public lands is largely on the increase.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen\r\nthat the people of the United States had a higher and more enduring\r\ninterest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the\r\npublic lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the\r\nsale of them. This opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping\r\nlegislation upon the subject of our national domain. I may cite as\r\nevidence of this the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual\r\nsettlers; the grant to the States of the overflowed lands within their\r\nlimits, in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for\r\ncultivation; the grants to railway companies of alternate sections of\r\nland upon the contemplated lines of their roads, which when completed\r\nwill so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distant\r\npossessions. This policy has received its most signal and beneficent\r\nillustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual\r\nsettlers. Since the 1st day of January last the before-mentioned\r\nquantity of 1,456,514 acres of land have been taken up under its\r\nprovisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying\r\nevidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands, notwithstanding\r\nthe great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been\r\nengaged, and which has required so large a withdrawal of our citizens\r\nfrom their accustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior suggesting a modification of the act in\r\nfavor of those engaged in the military and naval service of the United\r\nStates. I doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as\r\nwill, without essentially changing the general features of the system,\r\nsecure to the greatest practicable extent its benefits to those who have\r\nleft their homes in the defense of the country in this arduous crisis.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to the\r\npropriety of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the\r\nmineral lands of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain\r\nIndian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been\r\nnegotiated, which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional\r\naction of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the\r\npossessory rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of lands.\r\nIt is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the\r\nestablishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes\r\nas have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our\r\noutlying settlements and emigrants. Sound policy and our imperative duty\r\nto these wards of the Government demand our anxious and constant\r\nattention to their material well-being, to their progress in the arts of\r\ncivilization, and, above all, to that moral training which under the\r\nblessing of Divine Providence will confer upon them the elevated and\r\nsanctifying influences, the hopes and consolations, of the Christian\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nI suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodeling our\r\nIndian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The\r\ndetails set forth in the report of the Secretary evince the urgent need\r\nfor immediate legislative action.\r\n\r\nI commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the\r\nGovernment in this District to your generous and fostering care.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some\r\nextent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between\r\nthe Mississippi River and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition,\r\nhowever, failed for the time. Since then, upon a call of the greatest\r\nrespectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same\r\nsubject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed\r\nto the President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay\r\nbefore you. That this interest is one which ere long will force its own\r\nway I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your\r\nwisdom as to what can be done now. Augmented interest is given to this\r\nsubject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad,\r\nunder auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion. The\r\nenlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road.\r\n\r\nI transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in\r\nthat vital interest of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted nearly\r\ntwenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea,\r\nwith varying results; the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced\r\nlimits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad,\r\nwas not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections then just\r\npast indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was\r\ncold and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in\r\naccents of pity that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause.\r\nOur commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and\r\nfurnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with such\r\nadditions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea\r\nand raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from European\r\nGovernments anything hopeful upon this subject. The preliminary\r\nemancipation proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned\r\nperiod to the beginning of the new year. A month later the final\r\nproclamation came, including the announcement that colored men of\r\nsuitable condition would be received into the war service. The policy of\r\nemancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new\r\naspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain\r\nconflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil\r\nadministration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect\r\nemancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that\r\nthe rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military\r\nmeasure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it\r\nmight come, and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then\r\nbe presented. It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark\r\nand doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to\r\ntake another review. The rebel borders are pressed still farther back,\r\nand by the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by\r\nthe rebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical\r\ncommunication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been\r\nsubstantially cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens in\r\neach, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the\r\nrebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective\r\nStates. Of those States not included in the emancipation proclamation,\r\nMaryland and Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate\r\nany restraint upon the extension of slavery into new Territories, only\r\ndispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits.\r\n\r\nOf those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000\r\nare now in the United States military service, about one-half of which\r\nnumber actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage\r\nof taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the\r\nplaces which otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So far as\r\ntested, it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any. No\r\nservile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the\r\nmeasures of emancipation and arming the blacks. These measures have been\r\nmuch discussed in foreign countries, and, contemporary with such\r\ndiscussion, the tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home\r\nthe same measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticised, and\r\ndenounced, and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to\r\nthose whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great\r\ntrial. Thus we have the new reckoning. The crisis which threatened to\r\ndivide the friends of the Union is past.\r\n\r\nLooking now to the present and future, and with reference to a\r\nresumption of the national authority within the States wherein that\r\nauthority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a\r\nproclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted.[10] On examination\r\nof this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, that nothing will\r\nbe attempted beyond what is amply justified by the Constitution. True,\r\nthe form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. The man\r\nis only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath. The\r\nConstitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardon at\r\nhis own absolute discretion, and this includes the power to grant on\r\nterms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See proclamation dated December 8, 1863, pp. 213-215.]\r\n\r\nIt is also proffered that if in any of the States named a State\r\ngovernment shall be in the mode prescribed set up, such government shall\r\nbe recognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that under it the\r\nState shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against\r\ninvasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the\r\nUnited States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form\r\nof government and to protect the State in the cases stated is explicit\r\nand full. But why tender the benefits of this provision only to\r\na State government set up in this particular way? This section of the\r\nConstitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a State\r\nfavorable to republican government in the Union may be too feeble for\r\nan opposite and hostile element external to or even within the State,\r\nand such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government,\r\nconstructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element\r\nagainst whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply\r\nabsurd. There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements,\r\nso as to build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently\r\nliberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation\r\nof his former unsoundness.\r\n\r\nBut if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political\r\nbody an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and\r\nto the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard\r\nto slavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for\r\nthe purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them\r\ntheir fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In\r\nmy judgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for which\r\nthey were intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish\r\na lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach\r\nof faith. I may add at this point that while I remain in my present\r\nposition I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation\r\nproclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free\r\nby the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress.\r\nFor these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these\r\nmeasures shall be included in the oath, and it is believed the Executive\r\nmay lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited\r\nrights, which he has clear constitutional power to withhold altogether\r\nor grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public\r\ninterest. It should be observed also that this part of the oath is\r\nsubject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme\r\njudicial decision.\r\n\r\nThe proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable\r\ntemporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view\r\nof possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best\r\nattend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole\r\nStates. It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those\r\nStates may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their\r\naffliction if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves,\r\nwhile no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged\r\nby the proposition.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political\r\nframework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in the\r\nhope that it may do good without danger of harm. It will save labor and\r\navoid great confusion.\r\n\r\nBut why any proclamation now upon this subject? This question is beset\r\nwith the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be\r\ntaken too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seem ready\r\nfor action, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying\r\npoint--a plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B\r\nthat of A? And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the\r\nGeneral Government here will reject their plan? By the proclamation a\r\nplan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and\r\nwhich they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This may\r\nbring them to act sooner than they otherwise would.\r\n\r\nThe objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the National\r\nExecutive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be\r\nmore safely left to further developments. Care has been taken to so\r\nshape the document as to avoid embarrassments from this source. Saying\r\nthat on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights\r\nrestored, it is not said that other classes or other terms will never be\r\nincluded. Saying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in\r\na specified way, it is not said it will never be accepted in any other\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe movements by State action for emancipation in several of the States\r\nnot included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound\r\ngratulation. And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore\r\nso earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views and feelings\r\nremain unchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit no fair\r\nopportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of other cares, however important, we must not lose sight\r\nof the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power\r\nalone can we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the\r\ncontested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them.\r\nUntil that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere\r\nfor what is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care must still be\r\ndirected to the Army and Navy, who have thus far borne their harder part\r\nso nobly and well; and it may be esteemed fortunate that in giving the\r\ngreatest efficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably\r\nrecognize the gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them,\r\nand to whom more than to others the world must stand indebted for the\r\nhome of freedom disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 8, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Captain John Rodgers, United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks\r\nfrom Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him in\r\nthe engagement with the rebel armed ironclad steamer _Fingal_, alias\r\n_Atlanta_, whilst in command of the United States ironclad steamer\r\n_Weehawken_, which led to her capture on the 17th June, 1863, and also\r\nfor the zeal, bravery, and general good conduct shown by this officer on\r\nmany occasions.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the\r\nrequirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the\r\nfollowing words, viz:\r\n\r\nThat any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one\r\ngrade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the\r\nthanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the\r\nenemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 8, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nCongress, on my recommendation, passed a resolution, approved 7th\r\nFebruary, 1863, tendering its thanks to Commander D.D. Porter \"for the\r\nbravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas on the\r\n10th January, 1863,\" and in consideration of those services, together\r\nwith his efficient labors and vigilance subsequently displayed in\r\nthwarting the efforts of the rebels to obstruct the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries and the important part rendered by the squadron under his\r\ncommand, which led to the surrender of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nI do therefore, in conformity to the seventh section of the act approved\r\n16th July, 1862, nominate Commander D.D. Porter to be a rear-admiral in\r\nthe Navy on the active list from the 4th July, 1863, to fill an existing\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 10, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report, dated the 9th instant, with the\r\naccompanying papers, received from the Secretary of State in compliance\r\nwith the requirements of the sixteenth and eighteenth sections of the\r\nact entitled \"An act to regulate the diplomatic and consular systems of\r\nthe United States,\" approved August 18, 1856.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, December, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon, a treaty\r\nconcluded at Le Roy, Kans., on the 29th day of August, 1863, between\r\nWilliam P.

The subject of the letter, as indicated\r\nabove, is one of great magnitude and importance, and one which these\r\ngentlemen, of known ability and high character, seem to have considered\r\nwith great attention and care. Not having the time to form a mature\r\njudgment of my own as to whether the plan they suggest is the best, I\r\nsubmit the whole subject to Congress, deeming that their attention\r\nthereto is almost imperatively demanded.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 22, 1863_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, two conventions between the United States and His Belgian\r\nMajesty, signed at Brussels on the 20th May and the 20th of July last,\r\nrespectively, and both relating to the extinguishment of the Scheldt\r\ndues, etc. A copy of so much of the correspondence between the Secretary\r\nof State and Mr. Sanford, the minister resident of the United States at\r\nBrussels, on the subject of the conventions as is necessary to a full\r\nunderstanding of it is also herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1863_\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of the report to the Secretary of State of\r\nthe commissioners on the part of the United States under the convention\r\nwith Peru of the 12th of January last, on the subject of claims. It will\r\nbe noticed that two claims of Peruvian citizens on this Government have\r\nbeen allowed. An appropriation for the discharge of the obligations of\r\nthe United States in these cases is requested.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 5, 1864.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy a joint resolution of your honorable bodies approved December 23,\r\n1863, the paying of bounties to veteran volunteers, as now practiced by\r\nthe War Department, is, to the extent of $300 in each case, prohibited\r\nafter this 5th day of the present month. I transmit for your\r\nconsideration a communication from the Secretary of War, accompanied by\r\none from the Provost-Marshal-General to him, both relating to the\r\nsubject above mentioned. I earnestly recommend that the law be so\r\nmodified as to allow bounties to be paid as they now are, at least until\r\nthe ensuing 1st day of February.\r\n\r\nI am not without anxiety lest I appear to be importunate in thus\r\nrecalling your attention to a subject upon which you have so recently\r\nacted, and nothing but a deep conviction that the public interest\r\ndemands it could induce me to incur the hazard of being misunderstood on\r\nthis point. The Executive approval was given by me to the resolution\r\nmentioned, and it is now by a closer attention and a fuller knowledge of\r\nfacts that I feel constrained to recommend a reconsideration of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 7_\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of the decree of the court of the United\r\nStates for the southern district of New York, awarding the sum of\r\n$17,150.66 for the illegal capture of the British schooner _Glen_,\r\nand request that an appropriation of that amount may be made as an\r\nindemnification to the parties interested.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, January, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon\r\nthe following-described treaties, viz:\r\n\r\nA treaty made at Fort Bridger, Utah Territory, on the 2d day of July,\r\n1863, between the United States and the chiefs, principal men, and\r\nwarriors of the eastern bands of the Shoshonee Nation of Indians.\r\n\r\nA treaty made at Box Elder, Utah Territory, on the 30th day of July,\r\n1863, between the United States and the chiefs and warriors of the\r\nnorthwestern bands of the Shoshonee Nation of Indians.\r\n\r\nA treaty made at Ruby Valley, Nevada Territory, on the 1st day of\r\nOctober, 1863, between the United States and the chiefs, principal men,\r\nand warriors of the Shoshonee Nation of Indians.\r\n\r\nA treaty made at Tuilla Valley, Utah Territory, on the 12th day of\r\nOctober, 1863, between the United States and the chiefs, principal men,\r\nand warriors of the Goship bands of Shoshonee Indians.\r\n\r\nA treaty made at Soda Springs, in Idaho Territory, on the 14th day of\r\nOctober, 1863, between the United States and the chiefs of the mixed\r\nbands of Bannacks and Shoshonees, occupying the valley of the Shoshonee\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nA letter of the Secretary of the Interior of the 5th instant, a copy of\r\na report of the 30th ultimo, from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, a\r\ncopy of a communication from Governor Doty, superintendent of Indian\r\nAffairs, Utah Territory, dated November 10, 1863, relating to the\r\nIndians parties to the several treaties herein named, and a map,\r\nfurnished by that gentleman, are herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, January, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon,\r\na treaty made at the Old Crossing of Red Lake River, in the State of\r\nMinnesota, on the 2d day of October, 1863, between Alexander Ramsey and\r\nAshley C.

Since then\r\nthe company has represented to me that upon actual surveys made it has\r\ndetermined upon the precise point of departure of their said branch\r\nroad from the Missouri River, and located the same as described in the\r\naccompanying report of the Secretary of the Interior, which point is\r\nwithin the limits designated in the order of November last; and inasmuch\r\nas that order is not of record in any of the Executive Departments, and\r\nthe company having desired a more definite one, I have made the order\r\nof which a copy is herewith, and caused the same to be filed in the\r\nDepartment of the Interior.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE, _March 12, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the resolution of the Senate of the 28th of January\r\nlast, I communicate herewith a report, with accompanying papers, from\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, showing what portion of the\r\nappropriations for the colonization of persons of African descent has\r\nbeen expended and the several steps which have been taken for the\r\nexecution of the acts of Congress on that subject.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 14, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a treaty between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain for the final settlement of the claims of the Hudsons Bay\r\nand Pugets Sound Agricultural Companies, concluded on the 1st of July\r\nlast, the ratifications of which were exchanged in this city on the 5th\r\ninstant, and recommend an appropriation to carry into effect the first,\r\nsecond, and third articles thereof.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 14, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn the 25th day of November, 1862, a convention for the mutual\r\nadjustment of claims pending between the United States and Ecuador was\r\nsigned at Quito by the plenipotentiaries of the contracting parties.\r\nA copy is herewith inclosed.\r\n\r\nThis convention, already ratified by this Government, has been sent\r\nto Quito for the customary exchange of ratifications, which it is not\r\ndoubted will be promptly effected. As the stipulations of the instrument\r\nrequire that the commissioners who are to be appointed pursuant to its\r\nprovisions shall meet at Guayaquil within ninety days after such\r\nexchange, it is desirable that the legislation necessary to give effect\r\nto the convention on the part of the United States should anticipate the\r\nusual course of proceeding.\r\n\r\nI therefore invite the early attention of Congress to the subject.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 22, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon,\r\na treaty made and concluded in Washington City on the 18th instant by\r\nand between William P.

McCook, Colonel Lewis A. Grant, and Colonel Edward\r\nHatch are not either of them made to fill any vacancy in the proper\r\nsense of that term. They are not made to fill a command vacated by any\r\nother general, but are independent nominations, and if confirmed the\r\nofficers will be assigned to such command as the General Commanding may\r\ndeem proper. But in consequence of the resignations of Generals Miller,\r\nBoyle, and Beatty and the death of General Champlin, their confirmations\r\nwill be within the number of brigadiers allowed by law.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. STANTON\r\n  _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 23, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a note of the 19th instant from Lord\r\nLyons to the Secretary of State, on the subject of two British naval\r\nofficers who recently received medical treatment at the naval hospital\r\nat Norfolk. The expediency of authorizing Surgeon Solomon Sharp to\r\naccept the piece of plate to which the note refers, as an acknowledgment\r\nof his services, is submitted to your consideration.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 28, 1864.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the resolution of your honorable body a copy of which\r\nis herewith returned, I have the honor to make the following brief\r\nstatement, which is believed to contain the information sought.\r\n\r\nPrior to and at the meeting of the present Congress Robert C. Schenck,\r\nof Ohio, and Frank P. Blair, jr., of Missouri, members elect thereto, by\r\nand with the consent of the Senate held commissions from the Executive\r\nas major-generals in the Volunteer Army. General Schenck tendered the\r\nresignation of his said commission and took his seat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives at the assembling thereof upon the distinct verbal\r\nunderstanding with the Secretary of War and the Executive that he might\r\nat any time during the session, at his own pleasure, withdraw said\r\nresignation and return to the field. General Blair was, by temporary\r\nassignment of General Sherman, in command of a corps through the battles\r\nin front of Chattanooga and in the march to the relief of Knoxville,\r\nwhich occurred in the latter days of November and early days of December\r\nlast, and of course was not present at the assembling of Congress. When\r\nhe subsequently arrived here, he sought and was allowed by the Secretary\r\nof War and the Executive the same conditions and promise as allowed and\r\nmade to General Schenck. General Schenck has not applied to withdraw\r\nhis resignation, but when General Grant was made lieutenant-general,\r\nproducing some change of commanders, General Blair sought to be assigned\r\nto the command of a corps. This was made known to Generals Grant and\r\nSherman and assented to by them, and the particular corps for him\r\ndesignated. This was all arranged and understood, as now remembered,\r\nso much as a month ago, but the formal withdrawal of General Blair's\r\nresignation and making the order assigning him to the command of a corps\r\nwere not consummated at the War Department until last week, perhaps on\r\nthe 23d of April instant. As a summary of the whole, it may be stated\r\nthat General Blair holds no military commission or appointment other\r\nthan as herein stated, and that it is believed he is now acting as a\r\nmajor-general upon the assumed validity of the commission herein stated,\r\nin connection with the facts herein stated, and not otherwise. There\r\nare some letters, notes, telegrams, orders, entries, and perhaps other\r\ndocuments in connection with this subject, which it is believed would\r\nthrow no additional light upon it, but which will be cheerfully\r\nfurnished if desired.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 28, 1864.\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith an address to the President of the\r\nUnited States, and through him to both Houses of Congress, on the\r\ncondition and wants of the people of east Tennessee, and asking their\r\nattention to the necessity of some action on the part of the Government\r\nfor their relief, and which address is presented by a committee of an\r\norganization called \"The East Tennessee Relief Association.\"\r\n\r\nDeeply commiserating the condition of these most loyal and suffering\r\npeople, I am unprepared to make any specific recommendation for their\r\nrelief. The military is doing and will continue to do the best for them\r\nwithin its power. Their address represents that the construction of\r\ndirect railroad communication between Knoxville and Cincinnati by way of\r\ncentral Kentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency.\r\nIt may be remembered that in the annual message of December, 1861, such\r\nrailroad construction was recommended. I now add that, with the hearty\r\nconcurrence of Congress, I would yet be pleased to construct a road,\r\nboth for the relief of these people and for its continuing military\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 29, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 27th instant,\r\nrequesting information in regard to the condition of affairs in the\r\nTerritory of Nevada, I transmit a copy of a letter of the 25th of last\r\nmonth addressed to the Secretary of State by James W. Nye, the governor\r\nof that Territory.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 2, 1864.\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request contained in your resolution of the 29th\r\nultimo, a copy of which resolution is herewith returned, I have the\r\nhonor to transmit the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, November 2, 1863_.\r\n\r\nHon. MONTGOMERY BLAIR.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Some days ago I understood you to say that your brother,\r\nGeneral Frank Blair, desired to be guided by my wishes as to whether he\r\nwill occupy his seat in Congress or remain in the field. My wish, then,\r\nis compounded of what I believe will be best for the country and best\r\nfor him, and it is that he will come here, put his military commission\r\nin my hands, take his seat, go into caucus with our friends, abide the\r\nnominations, help elect the nominees, and thus aid to organize a House\r\nof Representatives which will really support the Government in the war.\r\nIf the result shall be the election of himself as Speaker, let him serve\r\nin that position; if not, let him retake his commission and return to\r\nthe Army. For the country, this will heal a dangerous schism. For him,\r\nit will relieve from a dangerous position. By a misunderstanding, as I\r\nthink, he is in danger of being permanently separated from those with\r\nwhom only he can ever have a real sympathy--the sincere opponents of\r\nslavery. It will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations offered\r\nhim by insincere timeservers to drive him from the house of his own\r\nbuilding. He is young yet. He has abundant talents, quite enough to\r\noccupy all his time without devoting any to temper. He is rising in\r\nmilitary skill and usefulness. His recent appointment to the command of\r\na corps by one so competent to judge as General Sherman proves this. In\r\nthat line he can serve both the country and himself more profitably than\r\nhe could as a Member of Congress upon the floor. The foregoing is what\r\nI would say if Frank Blair were my brother instead of yours.\r\n\r\nYours, truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MIDDLE DEPARTMENT, EIGHTH ARMY CORPS,\r\n\r\n_Baltimore, Md., November 13, 1863_.\r\n\r\nHon. E.M. STANTON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Inclosed I forward to the President my resignation, to take effect\r\non the 5th of December.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request, however, that I may be relieved from my command\r\nat an earlier day, say by the 20th instant, or as soon thereafter as\r\nsome officer can be ordered to succeed me. While I desire to derange the\r\nplans or hurry the action of the Department as little as possible, it\r\nwill be a great convenience to me to secure some little time before the\r\nsession of Congress for a necessary journey and for some preparations\r\nfor myself and family in view of my approaching change of residence\r\nand occupation.

So help\r\nme God.\r\n\r\nThe persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are\r\nall who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of\r\nthe so-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial\r\nstations under the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or\r\nshall have been military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate\r\nGovernment above the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the\r\nnavy; all who left seats in the United States Congress to aid the\r\nrebellion; all who resigned commissions in the Army or Navy of the\r\nUnited States and afterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have\r\nengaged in any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in\r\ncharge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which\r\npersons may have been found in the United States service as soldiers,\r\nseamen, or in any other capacity.\r\n\r\nAnd I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in any\r\nof the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,\r\nAlabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number\r\nof persons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such\r\nState at the Presidential election of the year A.D. 1860, each having\r\ntaken the oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a\r\nqualified voter by the election law of the State existing immediately\r\nbefore the so-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall\r\nreestablish a State government which shall be republican and in nowise\r\ncontravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true government\r\nof the State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the\r\nconstitutional provision which declares that \"the United States shall\r\nguarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government\r\nand shall protect each of them against invasion, and, on application of\r\nthe legislature, or the executive (when the legislature can not be\r\nconvened), against domestic violence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision\r\nwhich may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed\r\npeople of such State which shall recognize and declare their permanent\r\nfreedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as\r\na temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,\r\nlandless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nAnd it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal State\r\ngovernment in any State the name of the State, the boundary, the\r\nsubdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws as before\r\nthe rebellion be maintained, subject only to the modifications made\r\nnecessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if\r\nany, not contravening said conditions and which may be deemed expedient\r\nby those framing the new State government.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this\r\nproclamation, so far as it relates to State governments, has no\r\nreference to States wherein loyal State governments have all the while\r\nbeen maintained. And for the same reason it may be proper to further say\r\nthat whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted\r\nto seats constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective Houses,\r\nand not to any extent with the Executive.

Sherman and the gallant officers and soldiers of his command\r\nbefore Atlanta for the distinguished ability, courage, and perseverance\r\ndisplayed in the campaign in Georgia, which, under divine favor, has\r\nresulted in the capture of the city of Atlanta. The marches, battles,\r\nsieges, and other military operations that have signalized this campaign\r\nmust render it famous in the annals of war, and have entitled those who\r\nhave participated therein to the applause and thanks of the nation.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, September 3, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered_, first. That on Monday, the 5th day of September, commencing\r\nat the hour of 12 o'clock noon, there shall be given a salute of 100\r\nguns at the arsenal and navy-yard at Washington, and on Tuesday, the 6th\r\nof September, or on the day after the receipt of this order, at each\r\narsenal and navy-yard in the United States, for the recent brilliant\r\nachievements of the fleet and land forces of the United States in the\r\nharbor of Mobile and in the reduction of Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and\r\nFort Morgan.

The Secretary of War will issue directions for the execution of\r\nthis order.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, September 3, 1864_.\r\n\r\nThe signal success that Divine Providence has recently vouchsafed to the\r\noperations of the United States fleet and army in the harbor of Mobile,\r\nand the reduction of Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan, and the\r\nglorious achievements of the army under Major-General Sherman in the\r\nState of Georgia, resulting in the capture of the city of Atlanta, call\r\nfor devout acknowledgment to the Supreme Being, in whose hands are the\r\ndestinies of nations. It is therefore requested that on next Sunday, in\r\nall places of public worship in the United States, thanksgiving be\r\noffered to Him for His mercy in preserving our national existence\r\nagainst the insurgent rebels who so long have been waging a cruel war\r\nagainst the Government of the United States for its overthrow; and also\r\nthat prayer be made for the divine protection to our brave soldiers and\r\ntheir leaders in the field, who have so often and so gallantly periled\r\ntheir lives in battling with the enemy, and for blessing and comfort\r\nfrom the Father of Mercies to the sick, wounded, and prisoners, and to\r\nthe orphans and widows of those who have fallen in the service of their\r\ncountry; and that He will continue to uphold the Government of the\r\nUnited States against all the efforts of public enemies and secret foes.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 3, 1864_.\r\n\r\nThe national thanks are tendered by the President to Admiral Farragut\r\nand Major-General Canby for the skill and harmony with which the recent\r\noperations in Mobile Harbor and against Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and\r\nFort Morgan were planned and carried into execution; also to Admiral\r\nFarragut and Major-General Granger, under whose immediate command they\r\nwere conducted, and to the gallant commanders on sea and land, and to\r\nthe sailors and soldiers engaged in the operations, for their energy and\r\ncourage, which, under the blessing of Providence, have been crowned with\r\nbrilliant success and have won for them the applause and thanks of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington City, September 10, 1864_.\r\n\r\nThe term of one hundred days for which the National Guard of Ohio\r\nvolunteered having expired, the President directs an official\r\nacknowledgment to be made of their patriotic and valuable services\r\nduring the recent campaigns. The term of service of their enlistment was\r\nshort, but distinguished by memorable events. In the Valley of the\r\nShenandoah, on the Peninsula, in the operations on the James River,\r\naround Petersburg and Richmond, in the battle of Monocacy, and in the\r\nintrenchments of Washington, and in other important service, the\r\nNational Guard of Ohio performed with alacrity the duty of patriotic\r\nvolunteers, for which they are entitled to and are hereby tendered,\r\nthrough the governor of their State, the national thanks.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War is directed to transmit a copy of this order to the\r\ngovernor of Ohio and to cause a certificate of their honorable service\r\nto be delivered to the officers and soldiers of the Ohio National Guard\r\nwho recently served in the military force of the United States as\r\nvolunteers for one hundred days.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _September 24, 1864_.\r\n\r\nI. Congress having authorized the purchase for the United States of the\r\nproduct of States declared in insurrection, and the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury having designated New Orleans, Memphis, Nashville, Pensacola,\r\nPort Royal, Beaufort, N.C., and Norfolk as places of purchase, and with\r\nmy approval appointed agents and made regulations under which said\r\nproducts may be purchased: Therefore,\r\n\r\nII. All persons, except such as may be in the civil, military, or naval\r\nservice of the Government, having in their possession any products of\r\nStates declared in insurrection which said agents are authorized to\r\npurchase, and all persons owning or controlling such products therein,\r\nare authorized to convey such products to either of the places which\r\nhave been hereby or may hereafter be designated as places of purchase,\r\nand such products so destined shall not be liable to detention, seizure,\r\nor forfeiture while _in transitu_ or in store awaiting transportation.\r\n\r\nIII. Any person having the certificate of a purchasing agent, as\r\nprescribed by Treasury Regulations, VIII, is authorized to pass, with\r\nthe necessary means of transportation, to the points named in said\r\ncertificate, and to return therefrom with the products required for the\r\nfulfillment of the stipulations set forth in said certificate.\r\n\r\nIV. Any person having sold and delivered to a purchasing agent any\r\nproducts of an insurrectionary State in accordance with the regulations\r\nin relation thereto, and having in his possession a certificate setting\r\nforth the fact of such purchase and sale, the character and quantity of\r\nproducts, and the aggregate amount paid therefor, as prescribed by\r\nRegulation IX, shall be permitted by the military authority commanding\r\nat the place of sale to purchase from any authorized dealer at such\r\nplace, or any other place in a loyal State, merchandise and other\r\narticles not contraband of war nor prohibited by the order of the War\r\nDepartment, nor coin, bullion, or foreign exchange, to an amount not\r\nexceeding in value one-third of the aggregate value of the products sold\r\nby him, as certified by the agent purchasing; and the merchandise and\r\nother articles so purchased may be transported by the same route and to\r\nthe same place from and by which the products sold and delivered reached\r\nthe purchasing agent, as set forth in the certificate; and such\r\nmerchandise and other articles shall have safe conduct, and shall not be\r\nsubject to detention, seizure, or forfeiture while being transported to\r\nthe places and by the route set forth in the said certificate.\r\n\r\nV. Generals commanding military districts and commandants of military\r\nposts and detachments, and officers commanding fleets, flotillas, and\r\ngunboats, will give safe conduct to persons and products, merchandise,\r\nand other articles duly authorized as aforesaid, and not contraband of\r\nwar or prohibited by order of the War Department, or the orders of such\r\ngenerals commanding, or other duly authorized military or naval officer,\r\nmade in pursuance thereof; and all persons hindering or preventing such\r\nsafe conduct of persons or property will be deemed guilty of a military\r\noffense and punished accordingly.\r\n\r\nVI. Any person transporting or attempting to transport any merchandise\r\nor other articles, except in pursuance of regulations of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury dated July 29, 1864, or in pursuance of this order, or\r\ntransporting or attempting to transport any merchandise or other\r\narticles contraband of war or forbidden by any order of the War\r\nDepartment, will be deemed guilty of a military offense and punished\r\naccordingly; and all products of insurrectionary States found _in\r\ntransitu_ to any other person or place than a purchasing agent and a\r\ndesignated place of purchase shall be seized and forfeited to the United\r\nStates, except such as may be moving to a loyal State under duly\r\nauthorized permits of a proper officer of the Treasury Department, as\r\nprescribed by Regulation XXXVIII, concerning \"commercial intercourse,\"\r\ndated July 29, 1864, or such as may have been found abandoned or have\r\nbeen captured and are moving in pursuance of the act of March 12, 1863.\r\n\r\nVII. No military or naval officer of the United States, or person in the\r\nmilitary or naval service, nor any civil officer, except such as are\r\nappointed for that purpose, shall engage in trade or traffic in the\r\nproducts of insurrectionary States, or furnish transportation therefor,\r\nunder pain of being deemed guilty of unlawful trading with the enemy and\r\npunished accordingly.\r\n\r\nVIII. The Secretary of War will make such general orders or regulations\r\nas will insure the proper observance and execution of this order, and\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy will give instructions to officers commanding\r\nfleets, flotillas, and gunboats in conformity therewith.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, October 1, 1864_.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL EXECUTIVE ORDER RETURNING THANKS TO THE VOLUNTEERS FOR ONE\r\nHUNDRED DAYS FROM THE STATES OF INDIANA, ILLINOIS, IOWA, AND WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nThe term of one hundred days for which volunteers from the States of\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin volunteered, under the call of\r\ntheir respective governors, in the months of May and June, to aid in the\r\ncampaign of General Sherman, having expired, the President directs an\r\nofficial acknowledgment to be made of their patriotic service. It was\r\ntheir good fortune to render efficient service in the brilliant\r\noperations in the Southwest and to contribute to the victories of the\r\nnational arms over the rebel forces in Georgia under command of Johnston\r\nand Hood. On all occasions and in every service to which they were\r\nassigned their duty as patriotic volunteers was performed with alacrity\r\nand courage, for which they are entitled to and are hereby tendered the\r\nnational thanks through the governors of their respective States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War is directed to transmit a copy of this order to the\r\ngovernors of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin and to cause a\r\ncertificate of their honorable service to be delivered to the officers\r\nand soldiers of the States above named who recently served in the\r\nmilitary force of the United States as volunteers for one hundred days.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, October 12, 1864_.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government having caused the construction at New York of a\r\nvessel of war called the _Fusigama_, and application having been made\r\nfor the clearance of the same, in order that it may proceed to Japan, it\r\nis ordered, in view of the state of affairs in that country and of its\r\nrelation with the United States, that a compliance with the application\r\nbe for the present suspended.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 282.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, November 14, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_Ordered by the President_, I. That the resignation of George B.\r\nMcClellan as major-general in the United States Army, dated November 8\r\nand received by the Adjutant-General on the 10th instant, be accepted as\r\nof the 8th of November.\r\n\r\nII. That for the personal gallantry, military skill, and just confidence\r\nin the courage and patriotism of his troops displayed by Philip H.\r\nSheridan on the 19th day of October at Cedar Run, whereby, under the\r\nblessing of Providence, his routed army was reorganized, a great\r\nnational disaster averted, and a brilliant victory achieved over the\r\nrebels for the third time in pitched battle within thirty days, Philip\r\nH. Sheridan is appointed major-general in the United States Army, to\r\nrank as such from the 8th day of November, 1864.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President of the United States:\r\n\r\nE.D. TOWNSEND,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Adjutant-General_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n\r\n_Washington, December 3, 1864_.\r\n\r\nA war steamer, called the _Funayma Solace_, having been built in this\r\ncountry for the Japanese Government and at the instance of that\r\nGovernment, it is deemed to comport with the public interest, in view of\r\nthe unsettled condition of the relations of the United States with that\r\nEmpire, that the steamer should not be allowed to proceed to Japan. If,\r\nhowever, the Secretary of the Navy should ascertain that the steamer is\r\nadapted to our service, he is authorized to purchase her, but the\r\npurchase money will be held in trust toward satisfying any valid claims\r\nwhich may be presented by the Japanese on account of the construction of\r\nthe steamer and the failure to deliver the same, as above set forth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAgain the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our\r\nprofoundest gratitude to Almighty God.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMexico continues to be a theater of civil war. While our political\r\nrelations with that country have undergone no change, we have at the\r\nsame time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competent\r\nengineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan and\r\nthe port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that the\r\ndifficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions and\r\ncaused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably\r\nadjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be\r\nreopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation. We could not\r\nexaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that\r\ngreat improvement.\r\n\r\nIt would be doing injustice to an important South American State not to\r\nacknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which the\r\nUnited States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations with this\r\nGovernment. A claims convention has been constituted to complete the\r\nunfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with\r\nthe universal acquiescence of the people, the Government under it has\r\nbeen recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a\r\ncordial and friendly spirit. The long-deferred Aves Island claim has\r\nbeen satisfactorily paid and discharged.\r\n\r\nMutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint\r\ncommission for the settlement of claims between the United States and\r\nPeru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the\r\ntwo countries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used to\r\nremove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between Peru and\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nOur relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile, the Argentine\r\nRepublic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Hayti.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of\r\nthose Republics, and, on the other hand, their sympathies with the\r\nUnited States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.\r\n\r\nThe claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig _Macedonian_\r\nin 1821 has been paid in full by the Government of Chile.\r\n\r\nCivil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently\r\nwithout prospect of an early close.\r\n\r\nOfficial correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it\r\ngives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that\r\nRepublic. It may be expected to derive new vigor from American\r\ninfluence, improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI solicit your authority to furnish to the Republic a gunboat at\r\nmoderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by installments.\r\nSuch a vessel is needed for the safety of that State against the native\r\nAfrican races, and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in\r\narresting the African slave trade than a squadron in our own hands. The\r\npossession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a generous\r\nambition in the Republic, and the confidence which we should manifest by\r\nfurnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the colony from all\r\ncivilized nations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the way\r\nof Behrings Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress\r\nat the last session, has been undertaken, under very favorable\r\ncircumstances, by an association of American citizens, with the cordial\r\ngood will and support as well of this Government as of those of Great\r\nBritain and Russia. Assurances have been received from most of the South\r\nAmerican States of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their\r\nreadiness to cooperate in constructing lines tributary to that\r\nworld-encircling communication. I learn with much satisfaction that the\r\nnoble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of\r\nAmerica and Great Britain has been renewed, with full expectation of its\r\nearly accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will\r\nbe able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of\r\ncommerce and civilization.\r\n\r\nOur very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April\r\nlast. An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary\r\nincumbent of the office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a\r\nsuspension of intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the\r\narrival of the successor in the consulate, and our relations with Egypt,\r\nas well as our relations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been\r\nsuppressed, with the cooperating good offices of this Government and of\r\nthe other Western commercial States. The judicial consular establishment\r\nthere has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need\r\nlegislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to\r\nthe more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the\r\nGovernment and people of that vast Empire. China seems to be accepting\r\nwith hearty good will the conventional laws which regulate commercial\r\nand social intercourse among the Western nations.\r\n\r\nOwing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its\r\nGovernment, the action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulations\r\nis inconstant and capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been\r\neffected by the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own\r\npecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement, and\r\nthe inland sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to\r\nbelieve that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the\r\nfriendship of Japan toward the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by\r\nproclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider\r\nwhether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as\r\njust to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports than\r\nit is to pursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contraband\r\ntrade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military\r\noccupation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive,\r\nunder the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an\r\nasylum in the United States. If Congress should think that proceedings\r\nin such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further\r\nregulated by it, I recommend that provision be made for effectually\r\npreventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities\r\nfor their criminal occupation in our country.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that if it were a new and open question the maritime\r\npowers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the privileges\r\nof a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States,\r\ndestitute, as they are, and always have been, equally of ships of war\r\nand of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither less\r\nassiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were before\r\nthat time in their efforts, under favor of that privilege, to embroil\r\nour country in foreign wars. The desire and determination of the\r\ngovernments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to\r\nbe as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own. Nevertheless,\r\nunforeseen political difficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian\r\nand British ports and on the northern boundary of the United States,\r\nwhich have required, and are likely to continue to require, the practice\r\nof constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of\r\nthe United States, as well as of the nations concerned and their\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nCommissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain on\r\nthe adjustment of the claims of the Hudsons Bay and Pugets Sound\r\nAgricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the\r\nexecution of the trust assigned to them.\r\n\r\nIn view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to\r\nthe Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations\r\ncommitted by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it\r\nhas been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six\r\nmonths, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement\r\nwith Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty to\r\nincrease their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that\r\nproceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come\r\ninto consideration in connection with the question of continuing or\r\nmodifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States,\r\nas well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily established\r\nby the reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854.\r\n\r\nI desire, however, to be understood while making this statement that the\r\ncolonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust\r\nor unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary, there is\r\nevery reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial\r\nGovernment, they will take the necessary measures to prevent new\r\nincursions across the border.\r\n\r\nThe act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration\r\nhas so far as was possible been put into operation. It seems to need\r\namendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent\r\nthe practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on\r\ntheir arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of\r\navocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition toward this\r\ngreat national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and\r\nought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective\r\nnational protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the principal\r\nreplenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the\r\nravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health.\r\nAll that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its\r\npresent fullness, and to that end the Government must in every way make\r\nit manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary\r\nmilitary service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot\r\nin our country.\r\n\r\nThe financial affairs of the Government have been successfully\r\nadministered during the last year. The legislation of the last session\r\nof Congress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient\r\ntime has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the\r\nprovisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.\r\n\r\nThe receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of\r\nwarrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and\r\nthe balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were\r\n$1,394,796,007.62, and the aggregate disbursements, upon the same basis,\r\nwere $1,298,056,101.89, leaving a balance in the Treasury, as shown by\r\nwarrants, of $96,739,905.73.\r\n\r\nDeduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt\r\nredeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and the\r\nactual cash operations of the Treasury were: Receipts, $884,076,646.57;\r\ndisbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cash balance in the\r\nTreasury of $18,842,558,71.\r\n\r\nOf the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, from\r\nlands $588,333.29, from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue\r\n$109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and from\r\nloans applied to actual expenditures, including former balance,\r\n$623,443,929.13.\r\n\r\nThere were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensions\r\nand Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, for\r\nthe Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt\r\n$53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86 and leaving a\r\nbalance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated.\r\n\r\nFor the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of\r\nthe current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasury in\r\ndetail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I\r\nconcur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to\r\nmeet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should\r\nbe still further increased; and I earnestly invite your attention to\r\nthis subject, to the end that there may be such additional legislation\r\nas shall be required to meet the just expectations of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the 1st day of July last, as appears by the books of\r\nthe Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49. Probably, should the war\r\ncontinue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from\r\nfive hundred millions. Held, as it is, for the most part by our own\r\npeople, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private,\r\nproperty. For obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be\r\ndistributed among all the people the better. To favor such general\r\ndistribution, greater inducements to become owners might, perhaps, with\r\ngood effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited means.\r\nWith this view I suggest whether it might not be both competent and\r\nexpedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of some future\r\nissue of public securities might be held by any _bona fide_ purchaser\r\nexempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions\r\nand limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse of so\r\nimportant a privilege. This would enable every prudent person to set\r\naside a small annuity against a possible day of want.\r\n\r\nPrivileges like these would render the possession of such securities to\r\nthe amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who\r\nmight be able to save enough for the purpose. The great advantage of\r\ncitizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public\r\ndebt is obvious. Men readily perceive that they can not be much\r\noppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the 1st day of July last, although somewhat exceeding\r\nthe estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the\r\ncommencement of the last session, falls short of the estimate of that\r\nofficer made in the preceding December as to its probable amount at the\r\nbeginning of this year by the sum of $3,995,097.31. This fact exhibits a\r\nsatisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists\r\nand to the people. On the 25th day of November 584 national banks had\r\nbeen organized, a considerable number of which were conversions from\r\nState banks. Changes from State systems to the national system are\r\nrapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in\r\nthe United States no banks of issue not authorized by Congress and no\r\nbank-note circulation not secured by the Government. That the Government\r\nand the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking\r\nsystems of the country can hardly be questioned. The national system\r\nwill create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the\r\nnational credit and protect the people against losses in the use of\r\npaper money. Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the\r\nsuppression of State-bank issues it will be for Congress to determine.\r\nIt seems quite clear that the Treasury can not be satisfactorily\r\nconducted unless the Government can exercise a restraining power over\r\nthe bank-note circulation of the country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will\r\ndetail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the\r\nlast annual message, and also the operations of the several\r\nadministrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year. It\r\nwill also specify the measures deemed essential for the national defense\r\nand to keep up and supply the requisite military force.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval\r\nservice. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our\r\ncountrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so\r\nbrief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success.\r\n\r\nThe general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under construction on\r\nthe 1st of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying 4,610\r\nguns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the year,\r\nover and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167\r\nguns, and 42,427 tons.\r\n\r\nThe total number of men at this time in the naval service, including\r\nofficers, is about 51,000.\r\n\r\nThere have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, and\r\nthe whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1,379,\r\nof which 267 are steamers.\r\n\r\nThe gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property\r\nthus far reported amount to $14,396,250.51. A large amount of such\r\nproceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description,\r\nincluding the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into\r\nexistence from the 4th of March, 1861, to the 1st of November, 1864, is\r\n$238,647,262.35.\r\n\r\nYour favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations\r\nof the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy-yard and\r\nsuitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels\r\nand the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was\r\nmade in my last annual message.\r\n\r\nYour attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in\r\nrelation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect\r\nto prize on our inland waters.\r\n\r\nI cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the\r\npropriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval service.\r\n\r\nYour attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster-General for a\r\ndetailed account of the operations and financial condition of the\r\nPost-Office Department.\r\n\r\nThe postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to\r\n$12,438,253.78 and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess of\r\nexpenditures over receipts being $206,652.42.\r\n\r\nThe views presented by the Postmaster-General on the subject of special\r\ngrants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of\r\nocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development\r\nof increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring\r\ncountries should receive the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population,\r\nimprovement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied\r\nportions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded or\r\ndestroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem to\r\nhave absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed\r\nin conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is firmly\r\nestablished in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and\r\nuninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have\r\ngrown up on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity\r\nand rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance\r\nand the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities,\r\nhave been only partially organized; but it is understood that these\r\ndifficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their\r\ngovernments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and full\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nAs intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of\r\nthe nation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information\r\nand important recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian\r\naffairs, the Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries contained in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Interior which is herewith transmitted,\r\nand which report also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions, and\r\nother topics of public interest pertaining to his Department.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending\r\non the 30th of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614\r\nacres were entered under the homestead law. The remainder was located\r\nwith military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for\r\nrailroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location\r\nfees was $1,019,446.\r\n\r\nThe income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was\r\n$678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year. The\r\naggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the\r\nquantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about 133,000,000\r\nacres of surveyed land.\r\n\r\nThe great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States\r\nby railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that\r\ngives assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising\r\nfrom the prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the\r\nmain line of the road has been definitely located for 100 miles westward\r\nfrom the initial point at Omaha City, Nebr., and a preliminary location\r\nof the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from Sacramento\r\neastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada.\r\n\r\nNumerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have been added\r\nto the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra\r\nNevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with\r\nenterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believed that\r\nthe product of the mines of precious metals in that region has during\r\nthe year reached, if not exceeded, one hundred millions in value.\r\n\r\nIt was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be\r\nremodeled. Congress at its last session, acting upon the recommendation,\r\ndid provide for reorganizing the system in California, and it is\r\nbelieved that under the present organization the management of the\r\nIndians there will be attended with reasonable success. Much yet remains\r\nto be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians in other\r\nparts of the country, to render it secure for the advancing settler, and\r\nto provide for the welfare of the Indian. The Secretary reiterates his\r\nrecommendations, and to them the attention of Congress is invited.\r\n\r\nThe liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid\r\nsoldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, and\r\ndependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease\r\ncontracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have\r\nbeen diligently administered. There have been added to the pension rolls\r\nduring the year ending the 30th day of June last the names of 16,770\r\ninvalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number\r\nof army invalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712.\r\n\r\nOf widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army\r\npension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army\r\npensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793. At the\r\nbeginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1,430.\r\nOnly 12 of them were soldiers, of whom 7 have since died. The remainder\r\nare those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to\r\nRevolutionary soldiers. During the year ending the 30th of June, 1864,\r\n$4,504,616.92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent\r\ninstitutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto been\r\nestablished or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer for\r\ninformation concerning them and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct,\r\nthe Capitol, and other matters of local interest to the report of the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its present\r\nenergetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great\r\nand vital interest it was created to advance. It is peculiarly the\r\npeople's Department, in which they feel more directly concerned than in\r\nany other. I commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe war continues. Since the last annual message all the important lines\r\nand positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our\r\narms have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left in rear,\r\nso that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States have\r\nagain produced reasonably fair crops.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is\r\nGeneral Sherman's attempted march of 300 miles directly through the\r\ninsurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative\r\nstrength that our General in Chief should feel able to confront and hold\r\nin check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach a\r\nwell-appointed large army to move on such an expedition. The result not\r\nyet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged.\r\n\r\nImportant movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of\r\nmolding society for durability in the Union. Although short of complete\r\nsuccess, it is much in the right direction that 12,000 citizens in each\r\nof the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State\r\ngovernments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to\r\nmaintain and administer them. The movements in the same direction, more\r\nextensive though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee\r\nshould not be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of complete\r\nsuccess. Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future.\r\nThe genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul\r\nspirit being driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the Constitution\r\nabolishing slavery throughout the United States passed the Senate, but\r\nfailed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Although the present is the same Congress and nearly\r\nthe same members, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of\r\nthose who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the\r\nreconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session. Of\r\ncourse the abstract question is not changed; but an intervening election\r\nshows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass the measure if\r\nthis does not. Hence there is only a question of _time_ as to when the\r\nproposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And as it is\r\nto so go at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better? It\r\nis not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change\r\ntheir views or their votes any further than, as an additional element to\r\nbe considered, their judgment may be affected by it. It is the voice of\r\nthe people now for the first time heard upon the question. In a great\r\nnational crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seeking a\r\ncommon end is very desirable--almost indispensable. And yet no approach\r\nto such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to\r\nthe will of the majority simply because it is the will of the majority.\r\nIn this case the common end is the maintenance of the Union, and among\r\nthe means to secure that end such will, through the election, is most\r\nclearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\nThe most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is\r\nderived through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass\r\nand its result, the purpose of the people within the loyal States to\r\nmaintain the integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly\r\nunanimous than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with which\r\nthe millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strong\r\nassurance of this. Not only all those who supported the Union ticket, so\r\ncalled, but a great majority of the opposing party also may be fairly\r\nclaimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose. It is an\r\nunanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any office\r\nwhatever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he\r\nwas for giving up the Union. There have been much impugning of motives\r\nand much heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of\r\nadvancing the Union cause, but on the distinct issue of Union or no\r\nUnion the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there\r\nis no diversity among the people. In affording the people the fair\r\nopportunity of showing one to another and to the world this firmness\r\nand unanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast value to the\r\nnational cause.\r\n\r\nThe election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be\r\nknown--the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important\r\nbranch of national resources, that of living men. While it is melancholy\r\nto reflect that the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning\r\nto so many hearts, it is some relief to know that, compared with the\r\nsurviving, the fallen have been so few. While corps and divisions and\r\nbrigades and regiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out\r\nof existence, a great majority of the men who composed them are still\r\nliving. The same is true of the naval service. The election returns\r\nprove this. So many voters could not else be found. The States regularly\r\nholding elections, both now and four years ago, to wit, California,\r\nConnecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine,\r\nMaryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire,\r\nNew Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont,\r\nWest Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast 3,982,011 votes now, against\r\n3,870,222 cast then, showing an aggregate now of 3,982,011. To this is\r\nto be added 33,762 cast now in the new States of Kansas and Nevada,\r\nwhich States did not vote in 1860, thus swelling the aggregate to\r\n4,015,773 and the net increase during the three years and a half\r\nof war to 145,551. A table is appended showing particulars. To this\r\nagain should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nand California, who by the laws of those States could not vote away from\r\ntheir homes, and which number can not be less than 90,000. Nor yet is\r\nthis all. The number in organized Territories is triple now what it\r\nwas four years ago, while thousands, white and black, join us as\r\nthe national arms press back the insurgent lines. So much is shown,\r\naffirmatively and negatively, by the election. It is not material to\r\ninquire _how_ the increase has been produced or to show that it would\r\nhave been _greater_ but for the war, which is probably true. The\r\nimportant fact remains demonstrated that we have _more_ men _now_ than\r\nwe had when the war _began_; that we are not exhausted nor in process of\r\nexhaustion; that we are _gaining_ strength and may if need be maintain\r\nthe contest indefinitely. This as to men. Material resources are now\r\nmore complete and abundant than ever.\r\n\r\nThe national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe,\r\ninexhaustible. The public purpose to reestablish and maintain the\r\nnational authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable.\r\nThe manner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful\r\nconsideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no\r\nattempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any\r\ngood. He would accept nothing short of severance of the Union, precisely\r\nwhat we will not and can not give. His declarations to this effect are\r\nexplicit and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords\r\nus no excuse to deceive ourselves. He can not voluntarily reaccept the\r\nUnion; we can not voluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issue is\r\ndistinct, simple, and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried\r\nby war and decided by victory. If we yield, we are beaten; if the\r\nSouthern people fail him, he is beaten. Either way it would be the\r\nvictory and defeat following war. What is true, however, of him who\r\nheads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow.\r\nAlthough he can not reaccept the Union, they can. Some of them, we know,\r\nalready desire peace and reunion. The number of such may increase. They\r\ncan at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and\r\nsubmitting to the national authority under the Constitution. After so\r\nmuch the Government could not, if it would, maintain war against them.\r\nThe loyal people would not sustain or allow it. If questions should\r\nremain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation,\r\nconference, courts, and votes, operating only in constitutional and\r\nlawful channels. Some certain, and other possible, questions are and\r\nwould be beyond the Executive power to adjust; as, for instance, the\r\nadmission of members into Congress and whatever might require the\r\nappropriation of money. The Executive power itself would be greatly\r\ndiminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons and remissions of\r\nforfeitures, however, would still be within Executive control. In what\r\nspirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged\r\nof by the past.\r\n\r\nA year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were\r\noffered to all except certain designated classes, and it was at\r\nthe same time made known that the excepted classes were still within\r\ncontemplation of special clemency. During the year many availed\r\nthemselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that\r\nthe signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as\r\nrendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the same\r\ntime also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the\r\nexcepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus\r\npractically the door has been for a full year open to all except such\r\nas were not in condition to make free choice; that is, such as were in\r\ncustody or under constraint. It is still so open to all. But the time\r\nmay come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be\r\nclosed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national\r\nauthority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable\r\ncondition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I retract\r\nnothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made\r\na year ago, that \"while I remain in my present position I shall not\r\nattempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall\r\nI return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that\r\nproclamation or by any of the acts of Congress.\" If the people should,\r\nby whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty to reenslave such\r\npersons, another, and not I, must be their instrument to perform it.\r\n\r\nIn stating a single condition of peace I mean simply to say that the war\r\nwill cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased\r\non the part of those who began it.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Table showing the aggregate votes in the States named at the\r\n   Presidential elections respectively, in 1860 and 1864_.\r\n  =============================================================\r\n  State.                                 1860.        1864.\r\n\r\n  California                           118,840      110,000 [A]\r\n  Connecticut                           77,246       86,616\r\n  Delaware                              16,039       16,924\r\n  Illinois                             339,693      348,235\r\n  Indiana                              272,143      280,645\r\n  Iowa                                 128,331      143,331\r\n  Kentucky                             146,216       91,300 [A]\r\n  Maine                                 97,918      115,141\r\n  Maryland                              92,502       72,703\r\n  Massachusetts                        169,533      175,487\r\n  Michigan                             154,747      162,413\r\n  Minnesota                             34,799       42,534\r\n  Missouri                             165,538       90,000 [A]\r\n  New Hampshire                         65,953       69,111\r\n  New Jersey                           121,125      128,680\r\n  New York                             675,156      730,664\r\n  Ohio                                 442,441      470,745\r\n  Oregon                                14,410       14,410 [B]\r\n  Pennsylvania                         476,442      572,697\r\n  Rhode Island                          19,931       22,187\r\n  Vermont                               42,844       55,811\r\n  West Virginia                         46,195       33,874\r\n  Wisconsin                            152,180      148,513\r\n                                     ---------    ---------\r\n                                     3,870,222    3,982,011\r\n\r\n  Kansas                                             17,234\r\n  Nevada                                             16,528\r\n                                                     ------\r\n                                                     33,762\r\n                                                  3,982,011\r\n                                                  ---------\r\n            Total                                 4,015,773\r\n                                                  3,870,222\r\n                                                  ---------\r\n            Net Increase                            145,551\r\n  =============================================================\r\n                                   [A: Nearly.] [B: Estimated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _December 5, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend\r\nthat Captain John A.

In his own view, however, the two\r\nHouses of Congress, convened under the twelfth article of the\r\nConstitution, have complete power to exclude from counting all electoral\r\nvotes deemed by them to be illegal, and it is not competent for the\r\nExecutive to defeat or obstruct that power by a veto, as would be the\r\ncase if his action were at all essential in the matter. He disclaims all\r\nright of the Executive to interfere in any way in the matter of\r\ncanvassing or counting electoral votes, and he also disclaims that by\r\nsigning said resolution he has expressed any opinion on the recitals of\r\nthe preamble or any judgment of his own upon the subject of the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 10, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 8th instant, requesting\r\ninformation concerning recent conversations or communications with\r\ninsurgents under Executive sanction, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 10, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn response to your resolution of the 8th instant, requesting\r\ninformation in relation to a conference recently held in Hampton Roads,\r\nI have the honor to state that on the day of the date I gave Francis P.\r\nBlair, sr., a card, written on as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n  December 28, 1864.\r\n\r\n  Allow the bearer, F.P. Blair, sr., to pass our lines, go South,\r\n  and return.\r\n\r\n  A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nThat at the time I was informed that Mr. Blair sought the card as a\r\nmeans of getting to Richmond, Va., but he was given no authority to\r\nspeak or act for the Government, nor was I informed of anything he would\r\nsay or do on his own account or otherwise. Afterwards Mr. Blair told me\r\nthat he had been to Richmond and had seen Mr. Jefferson Davis; and he\r\n(Mr. B.) at the same time left with me a manuscript letter, as follows,\r\nto wit:\r\n\r\n  Richmond, Va., _January 12, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  F.P. BLAIR, Esq.\r\n\r\n  SIR: I have deemed it proper, and probably desirable to you, to give\r\n  you in this form the substance of remarks made by me, to be repeated\r\n  by you to President Lincoln, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n  I have no disposition to find obstacles in forms, and am willing, now\r\n  as heretofore, to enter into negotiations for the restoration of peace,\r\n  and am ready to send a commission whenever I have reason to suppose it\r\n  will be received, or to receive a commission if the United States\r\n  Government shall choose to send one. That notwithstanding the rejection\r\n  of our former offers, I would, if you could promise that a commissioner,\r\n  minister, or other agent would be received, appoint one immediately, and\r\n  renew the effort to enter into conference with a view to secure peace to\r\n  the two countries.\r\n\r\n  Yours, etc.,\r\n  JEFFERSON DAVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, and with the view that it should be shown to Mr. Davis, I\r\nwrote and delivered to Mr. Blair a letter, as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 18, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  F.P. BLAIR, Esq.\r\n\r\n  SIR: Your having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the 12th instant,\r\n  you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall\r\n  continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential\r\n  person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me\r\n  with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country.\r\n\r\n  Yours, etc.,\r\n  A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards Mr. Blair dictated for and authorized me to make an entry on\r\nthe back of my retained copy of the letter last above recited, which\r\nentry is as follows:\r\n\r\n  JANUARY 28, 1865.\r\n\r\n  Today Mr. Blair tells me that on the 21st instant he delivered to Mr.\r\n  Davis the original of which the within is a copy, and left it with him;\r\n  that at the time of delivering it Mr. Davis read it over twice in Mr.\r\n  Blair's presence, at the close of which he (Mr. Blair) remarked that the\r\n  part about \"our one common country\" related to the part of Mr. Davis's\r\n  letter about \"the two countries,\" to which Mr. Davis replied that he so\r\n  understood it.\r\n\r\n  A.

Eckert\r\nthe following instructions and message:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n    _Washington, January 30, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  Major T.T. ECKERT.\r\n\r\n  SIR: You will proceed with the documents placed in your hands, and on\r\n  reaching General Ord will deliver him the letter addressed to him by\r\n  the Secretary of War; then, by General Ord's assistance, procure an\r\n  interview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, or any of them.\r\n  Deliver to him or them the paper on which your own letter is written.\r\n  Note on the copy which you retain the time of delivery and to whom\r\n  delivered. Receive their answer in writing, waiting a reasonable time\r\n  for it, and which, if it contain their decision to come through without\r\n  further condition, will be your warrant to ask General Ord to pass them\r\n  through, as directed in the letter of the Secretary of War to him. If by\r\n  their answer they decline to come, or propose other terms, do not have\r\n  them pass through. And this being your whole duty, return and report\r\n  to me.\r\n\r\n  A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CITY POINT, VA., _February 1, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  Messrs. ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS, J.A. CAMPBELL, and R.M.T. HUNTER.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN: I am instructed by the President of the United States to\r\n  place this paper in your hands, with the information that if you pass\r\n  through the United States military lines it will be understood that you\r\n  do so for the purpose of an informal conference on the basis of the\r\n  letter a copy of which is on the reverse side of this sheet, and that if\r\n  you choose to pass on such understanding, and so notify me in writing, I\r\n  will procure the commanding general to pass you through the lines and to\r\n  Fortress Monroe under such military precautions as he may deem prudent,\r\n  and at which place you will be met in due time by some person or persons\r\n  for the purpose of such informal conference; and, further, that you\r\n  shall have protection, safe conduct, and safe return in all events.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS T. ECKERT,\r\n    _Major and Aid-de-Camp_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _January 18, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  F.P. BLAIR, Esq.\r\n\r\n  SIR: Your having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the 12th instant,\r\n  you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall\r\n  continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential\r\n  person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me\r\n  with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country.\r\n\r\n  Yours, etc.,\r\n  A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, but before Major Eckert had departed, the following dispatch\r\nwas received from General Grant:\r\n\r\n  OFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH,\r\n    _War Department_.\r\n\r\n  The following telegram received at Washington January 31, 1865, from\r\n  City Point, Va., 10.30 a.m., January 30, 1865:\r\n\r\n  \"His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,\r\n    \"_President of the United States_:\r\n\r\n  \"The following communication was received here last evening:\r\n\r\n  'PETERSBURG, VA., _January 30, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  'Lieutenant-General U.S. GRANT,\r\n    '_Commanding Armies United States_.\r\n\r\n  'SIR: We desire to pass your lines under safe conduct, and to proceed to\r\n  Washington to hold a conference with President Lincoln upon the subject\r\n  of the existing war, and with a view of ascertaining upon what terms it\r\n  may be terminated, in pursuance of the course indicated by him in his\r\n  letter to Mr. Blair of January 18, 1865, of which we presume you have a\r\n  copy; and if not, we wish to see you in person, if convenient, and to\r\n  confer with you upon the subject.\r\n\r\n  'Very respectfully, yours,\r\n  'ALEXANDER H.

I resolved, however, to send Major Eckert\r\nforward with his message, and accordingly telegraphed General Grant as\r\nfollows, to wit:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n    _Washington, January 31, 1865_.\r\n      (Sent at 1.30 p.m.)\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-General GRANT,\r\n    _City Point, Va._:\r\n\r\n  A messenger is coming to you on the business contained in your dispatch,\r\n  Detain the gentlemen in comfortable quarters until he arrives, and then\r\n  act upon the message he brings as far as applicable, it having been made\r\n  up to pass through General Ord's hands, and when the gentlemen were\r\n  supposed to be beyond our lines.\r\n\r\n  A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nWhen Major Eckert departed, he bore with him a letter of the Secretary\r\nof War to General Grant, as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n    _Washington, D.C., January 30, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-General GRANT,\r\n    _Commanding, etc._\r\n\r\n  GENERAL: The President desires that you will please procure for the\r\n  bearer, Major Thomas T.

STANTON,\r\n    _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupposing the proper point to be then reached, I dispatched the\r\nSecretary of State with the following instructions, Major Eckert,\r\nhowever, going ahead of him:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n    _Washington, January 31, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  Hon. WILLIAM H. SEWARD,\r\n    _Secretary of State_:\r\n\r\n  You will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Va., there to meet and informally\r\n  confer with Messrs.

Blair, esq., of January 18, 1865, a copy of which you\r\n  have.\r\n\r\n  You will make known to them that three things are indispensable, to wit:\r\n\r\n  1. The restoration of the national authority throughout all the States.\r\n\r\n  2. No receding by the Executive of the United States on the slavery\r\n  question from the position assumed thereon in the late annual\r\n  message to Congress and in preceding documents.\r\n\r\n  3. No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war and the\r\n  disbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.\r\n\r\n  You will inform them that all propositions of theirs not inconsistent\r\n  with the above will be considered and passed upon in a spirit of\r\n  sincere liberality. You will hear all they may choose to say and report\r\n  it to me.\r\n\r\n  You will not assume to definitely consummate anything.\r\n\r\n  Yours, etc.,\r\n  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day of its date the following telegram was sent to General Grant:\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n    _Washington, D.C., February 1, 1865_.\r\n      (Sent at 9.30 a.m.)\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-General GRANT,\r\n    _City Point, Va._:\r\n\r\n  Let nothing which is transpiring change, hinder, or delay your military\r\n  movements or Plans.\r\n\r\n  A.

ECKERT,\r\n    _Care of General Grant, City Point, Va._:\r\n\r\n  Call at Fortress Monroe and put yourself under direction of Mr. S.,\r\n  whom you will find there.\r\n\r\n  A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 2d instant the following telegrams were received\r\nby me respectively from the Secretary of State and Major Eckert:\r\n\r\n  FORT MONROE, VA., _February 1, 1865--11.30 p.m._\r\n\r\n  The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\n  Arrived at 10 this evening.

The point of\r\nmeeting designated in the above note would not, in my opinion, be\r\ninsisted upon. Think Fort Monroe would be acceptable. Having complied\r\nwith my instructions, I will return to Washington tomorrow unless\r\notherwise ordered.\r\n\r\nTHOS. T. ECKERT, _Major, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reading this dispatch of Major Eckert I was about to recall him and\r\nthe Secretary of State, when the following telegram of General Grant to\r\nthe Secretary of War was shown me:\r\n\r\n  OFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH,\r\n    _War Department_.\r\n\r\n  The following telegram received at Washington 4.35 a.m. February 2,\r\n  1865, from City Point, Va., February 1, 10.30 p.m., 1865:\r\n\r\n  \"Hon. EDWIN M.

Stephens and Hunter that\r\n  their intentions are good and their desire sincere to restore peace and\r\n  union. I have not felt myself at liberty to express even views of my\r\n  own or to account for my reticency. This has placed me in an awkward\r\n  position, which I could have avoided by not seeing them in the first\r\n  instance. I fear now their going back without any expression from anyone\r\n  in authority will have a bad influence. At the same time, I recognize\r\n  the difficulties in the way of receiving these informal commissioners\r\n  at this time, and do not know what to recommend. I am sorry, however,\r\n  that Mr. Lincoln can not have an interview with the two named in this\r\n  dispatch, if not all three now within our lines. Their letter to me was\r\n  all that the President's instructions contemplated to secure their safe\r\n  conduct if they had used the same language to Major Eckert.\r\n\r\n  \"U.S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dispatch of General Grant changed my purpose, and accordingly I\r\ntelegraphed him and the Secretary of State, respectively, as follows:\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n    _Washington, D.C., February 2, 1865_.\r\n      (Sent at 9 a.m.)\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-General GRANT,\r\n    _City Point, Va._:\r\n\r\n  Say to the gentlemen I will meet them personally at Fortress Monroe\r\n  as soon as I can get there.\r\n\r\n  A.

I proceeded,\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\n  OFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH,\r\n    _War Department_.\r\n\r\n  The following telegram received at Washington February 2, 1865, from\r\n  City Point, Va., 9 a.m., February 2, 1865:\r\n\r\n  \"Hon.

I ascertained that Major Eckert had literally\r\ncomplied with his instructions, and I saw for the first time the answer\r\nof the Richmond gentlemen to him, which in his dispatch to me of the 1st\r\nhe characterizes as \"not satisfactory.\" That answer is as follows, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\n  CITY POINT, VA., _February 1, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS T. ECKERT,\r\n    _Major and Aid-de-Camp_.\r\n\r\n  MAJOR: Your note, delivered by yourself this day, has been considered.\r\n  In reply we have to say that we were furnished with a copy of the letter\r\n  of President Lincoln to Francis P. Blair, esq., of the 18th of January\r\n  ultimo, another copy of which is appended to your note.\r\n\r\n  Our instructions are contained in a letter of which the following is\r\n  a copy:\r\n\r\n  \"Richmond, _January 28, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  \"In conformity with the letter of Mr. Lincoln, of which the foregoing is\r\n  a copy, you are to proceed to Washington City for informal conference\r\n  with him upon the issues involved in the existing war, and for the\r\n  purpose of securing peace to the two countries.\r\n\r\n  'With great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n  \"JEFFERSON DAVIS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substantial object to be obtained by the informal conference is to\r\nascertain upon what terms the existing war can be terminated honorably.\r\n\r\nOur instructions contemplate a personal interview between President\r\nLincoln and ourselves at Washington City, but with this explanation we\r\nare ready to meet any person or persons that President Lincoln may\r\nappoint at such place as he may designate.\r\n\r\nOur earnest desire is that a just and honorable peace may be agreed\r\nupon, and we are prepared to receive or to submit propositions which may\r\npossibly lead to the attainment of that end.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, yours,\r\n\r\n  ALEXANDER H.

ECKERT,\r\n    _Major and Aid-de-Camp_.\r\n\r\n  MAJOR: In reply to your verbal statement that your instructions did not\r\n  allow you to alter the conditions upon which a passport could be given\r\n  to us, we say that we are willing to proceed to Fortress Monroe and\r\n  there to have an informal conference with any person or persons that\r\n  President Lincoln may appoint on the basis of his letter to Francis P.\r\n  Blair of the 18th of January ultimo, or upon any other terms or\r\n  conditions that he may hereafter propose not inconsistent with the\r\n  essential principles of self-government and popular rights, upon which\r\n  our institutions are founded.\r\n\r\n  It is our earnest wish to ascertain, after a free interchange of ideas\r\n  and information, upon what principles and terms, if any, a just and\r\n  honorable peace can be established without the further effusion of\r\n  blood, and to contribute our utmost efforts to accomplish such a result.\r\n\r\n  We think it better to add that in accepting your passport we are not to\r\n  be understood as committing ourselves to anything but to carry to this\r\n  informal conference the views and feelings above expressed.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n  ALEXANDER H.

ECKERT,\r\n\r\n_Major and Aid-de-Camp_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3d the three gentlemen, Messrs. Stephens, Hunter,\r\nand Campbell, came aboard of our steamer and had an interview with the\r\nSecretary of State and myself of several hours' duration. No question of\r\npreliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned; no\r\nother person was present; no papers were exchanged or produced; and it\r\nwas in advance agreed that the conversation was to be informal and\r\nverbal merely. On our part the whole substance of the instructions to\r\nthe Secretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted\r\nupon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith; while by the other\r\nparty it was not said that in any event or on any condition they _ever_\r\nwould consent to reunion, and yet they equally omitted to declare that\r\nthey _never_ would so consent. They seemed to desire a postponement of\r\nthat question and the adoption of some other course first, which, as\r\nsome of them seemed to argue, might or might not lead to reunion, but\r\nwhich course we thought would amount to an indefinite postponement. The\r\nconference ended without result.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the information sought,\r\nis respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a dispatch of the 12th ultimo,\r\naddressed to the Secretary of State by the minister resident of the\r\nUnited States at Stockholm, relating to an international exhibition to\r\nbe held at Bergen, in Norway, during the coming summer.

It passed the House and went to the Senate, where a\r\nvote was taken upon it, but by some accident it was not presented to the\r\nPresident of the Senate for his signature.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of the last session of Congress other errors of a\r\nkind similar to those which this resolution was designed to correct have\r\nbeen discovered in the law, and it is now thought most expedient to\r\ninclude all the necessary corrections in one act or resolution.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the proper committee of the House has, I am informed,\r\nbeen already directed to the preparation of a bill for this purpose.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by the act approved July 4, 1864, entitled \"An act further to\r\nregulate and provide for the enrolling and calling out the national\r\nforces, and for other purposes,\" it is provided that the President of\r\nthe United States may, \"at his discretion, at any time hereafter, call\r\nfor any number of men, as volunteers for the respective terms of one,\r\ntwo, and three years for military service,\" and \"that in case the quota\r\nor any part thereof of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct, or\r\nelection district, or of any county not so subdivided, shall not be\r\nfilled within the space of fifty days after such call, then the\r\nPresident shall immediately order a draft for one year to fill such\r\nquota or any part thereof which may be unfilled;\" and\r\n\r\nWhereas by the credits allowed in accordance with the act of Congress on\r\nthe call for 500,000 men, made July 18, 1864, the number of men to be\r\nobtained under that call was reduced to 280,000; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the operations of the enemy in certain States have rendered it\r\nimpracticable to procure from them their full quotas of troops under\r\nsaid call; and\r\n\r\nWhereas from the foregoing causes but 240,000 men have been put into\r\nthe Army, Navy, and Marine Corps under the said call of July 18, 1864,\r\nleaving a deficiency on that call of two hundred and sixty thousand\r\n(260,000):\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in order to supply the aforesaid deficiency and to provide for\r\ncasualties in the military and naval service of the United States, do\r\nissue this my call for three hundred thousand (300,000) volunteers to\r\nserve for one, two, or three years.

Henry\r\nStanbery be, and they are hereby, appointed special commissioners to\r\ninvestigate and report, for the information of the President, upon the\r\ncivil and military administration in the military division bordering\r\nupon and west of the Mississippi, under such instructions as shall be\r\nissued by authority of the President and the War Department.\r\n\r\nSecond. Said commissioners shall have power to examine witnesses upon\r\noath, and to take such proofs, orally or in writing, upon the\r\nsubject-matters of investigation as they may deem expedient, and return\r\nthe same together with their report.\r\n\r\nThird. All officers and persons in the military, naval, and revenue\r\nservices, or in any branch of the public service under the authority of\r\nthe United States Government, are required, upon subpoena issued by\r\ndirection of the said commissioners, to appear before them at such time\r\nand place as may be designated in said subpoena and to give testimony on\r\noath touching such matters as may be inquired of by the commissioners,\r\nand to produce such books, papers, writings, and documents as they may\r\nbe notified or required to produce by the commissioners, and as may be\r\nin their possession.\r\n\r\nFourth. Said special commissioners shall also investigate and report\r\nupon any other matters that may hereafter be directed by the Secretary\r\nof War, and shall with all convenient dispatch make report to him in\r\nwriting of their investigation, and shall also from time to time make\r\nspecial reports to the Secretary of War upon such matters as they may\r\ndeem of importance to the public interests.\r\n\r\nFifth. The Secretary of War shall assign to the said commissioners such\r\naid and assistance as may be required for the performance of their\r\nduties, and make such just and reasonable allowances and compensation\r\nfor the said commissioners and for the persons employed by them as he\r\nmay deem proper.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, December 17, 1864_.\r\n\r\nThe President directs that, except immigrant passengers directly\r\nentering an American port by sea, henceforth no traveler shall be\r\nallowed to enter the United States from a foreign country without a\r\npassport. If a citizen, the passport must be from this Department or\r\nfrom some United States minister or consul abroad; and if an alien, from\r\nthe competent authority of his own country, the passport to be\r\ncountersigned by a diplomatic agent or consul of the United States. This\r\nregulation is intended to apply especially to persons proposing to come\r\nto the United States from the neighboring British Provinces. Its\r\nobservance will be strictly enforced by all officers, civil, military,\r\nand naval, in the service of the United States, and the State and\r\nmunicipal authorities are requested to aid in its execution. It is\r\nexpected, however, that no immigrant passenger coming in manner\r\naforesaid will be obstructed, or any other persons who may set out on\r\ntheir way hither before intelligence of this regulation could reasonably\r\nbe expected to reach the country from which they may have started.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H.

W.\r\nFoster be, and they are hereby, constituted a board to examine into the\r\nproper quotas and credits of the respective States and districts under\r\nthe call of December 19, 1864, with directions, if any errors be found\r\ntherein, to make such corrections as the law and facts may require and\r\nreport their determination to the Provost-Marshal-General. The\r\ndetermination of said board to be final and conclusive, and the draft to\r\nbe made in conformity therewith.\r\n\r\n2. The Provost-Marshal-General is ordered to make the draft in the\r\nrespective districts as speedily as the same can be done after the 15th\r\nof this month.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Military Officers Commanding in West Tennessee_:\r\n\r\nWhile I can not order as within requested, allow me to say that it is\r\nmy wish for you to relieve the people from all burdens, harassments,\r\nand oppressions so far as is possible consistently with your military\r\nnecessities; that the object of the war being to restore and maintain\r\nthe blessings of peace and good government, I desire you to help, and\r\nnot hinder, every advance in that direction.\r\n\r\nOf your military necessities you must judge and execute, but please do\r\nso in the spirit and with the purpose above indicated.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Daily National Intelligencer, February 22, 1865.]\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 21, 1865_.\r\n\r\nThe Department buildings will be illuminated on the night of\r\nWashington's birthday, in honor of the recent triumphs of the Union.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. SEWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Countrymen: At this second appearing to take the oath of the\r\nPresidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than\r\nthere was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course\r\nto be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four\r\nyears, during which public declarations have been constantly called\r\nforth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs\r\nthe attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is\r\nnew could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else\r\nchiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is,\r\nI trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope\r\nfor the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were\r\nanxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought\r\nto avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this\r\nplace, devoted altogether to _saving_ the Union without war, insurgent\r\nagents were in the city seeking to _destroy_ it without war--seeking to\r\ndissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties\r\ndeprecated war, but one of them would _make_ war rather than let the\r\nnation survive, and the other would _accept_ war rather than let it\r\nperish, and the war came.\r\n\r\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\r\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it.\r\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew\r\nthat this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen,\r\nperpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\r\ninsurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government\r\nclaimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement\r\nof it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\r\nwhich it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the _cause_ of\r\nthe conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should\r\ncease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental\r\nand astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and\r\neach invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men\r\nshould dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from\r\nthe sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not\r\njudged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has\r\nbeen answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. \"Woe unto the\r\nworld because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but\r\nwoe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\" If we shall suppose that\r\nAmerican slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of\r\nGod, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed\r\ntime, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South\r\nthis terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came,\r\nshall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes\r\nwhich the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we\r\nhope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily\r\npass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled\r\nby the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall\r\nbe sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid\r\nby another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago,\r\nso still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and\r\nrighteous altogether.\"\r\n\r\nWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the\r\nright as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the\r\nwork we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who\r\nshall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all\r\nwhich may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves\r\nand with all nations.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _March 8, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the law of 16th January, 1857, provides that\r\nreserved officers may be promoted on the reserved list, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, and under this authority various\r\nofficers of the Navy have been promoted one grade from time to time.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate Commander John J. Young, now on the reserved list,\r\nto be a captain in the Navy on the reserved list from the 12th August,\r\n1854, the date when he was entitled to his regular promotion had he not\r\nbeen overslaughed. It is due to this officer to state that he was passed\r\nover in consequence of physical disability, this disability having\r\noccurred in the discharge of his duties; and prior to his misfortune\r\nhe bore the reputation of an efficient and correct officer, and\r\nsubsequently has evinced a willingness to perform whatever duties were\r\nassigned him.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1865_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the Senate's resolution of the 6th instant, requesting the\r\nreturn of a certain joint resolution,[16] I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Entitled \"Joint resolution in relation to certain\r\nrailroads.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the twenty-first section of the act of Congress approved on the\r\n3d instant, entitled \"An act to amend the several acts heretofore passed\r\nto provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces and\r\nfor other purposes,\" requires \"that, in addition to the other lawful\r\npenalties of the crime of desertion from the military or naval service,\r\nall persons who have deserted the military or naval service of the\r\nUnited States who shall not return to said service or report themselves\r\nto a provost-marshal within sixty days after the proclamation\r\nhereinafter mentioned shall be deemed and taken to have voluntarily\r\nrelinquished and forfeited their rights of citizenship and their rights\r\nto become citizens, and such deserters shall be forever incapable of\r\nholding any office of trust or profit under the United States or of\r\nexercising any rights of citizens thereof; and all persons who shall\r\nhereafter desert the military or naval service, and all persons who,\r\nbeing duly enrolled, shall depart the jurisdiction of the district in\r\nwhich he is enrolled or go beyond the limits of the United States with\r\nintent to avoid any draft into the military or naval service duly\r\nordered, shall be liable to the penalties of this section. And the\r\nPresident is hereby authorized and required, forthwith on the passage of\r\nthis act, to issue his proclamation setting forth the provisions of this\r\nsection, in which proclamation the President is requested to notify all\r\ndeserters returning within sixty days as aforesaid that they shall be\r\npardoned on condition of returning to their regiments and companies or\r\nto such other organizations as they may be assigned to until they shall\r\nhave served for a period of time equal to their original term of\r\nenlistment.\"\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\r\nUnited States, do issue this my proclamation, as required by said act,\r\nordering and requiring all deserters to return to their proper posts;\r\nand I do hereby notify them that all deserters who shall, within sixty\r\ndays from the date of this proclamation, viz, on or before the 10th day\r\nof May, 1865, return to service or report themselves to a\r\nprovost-marshal shall be pardoned, on condition that they return to\r\ntheir regiments and companies or to such other organizations as they may\r\nbe assigned to and serve the remainder of their original terms of\r\nenlistment and in addition thereto a period equal to the time lost by\r\ndesertion.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 11th day of March, A.D. 1865, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the eighty-ninth.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  WILLIAM H.

In the view of the United\r\nStates, no condition any longer exists which can be claimed to justify\r\nthe denial to them by any one of such nations of customary naval rights\r\nas has heretofore been so unnecessarily persisted in.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby make known that if after a reasonable time shall have elapsed for\r\nintelligence of this proclamation to have reached any foreign country in\r\nwhose ports the said privileges and immunities shall have been refused\r\nas aforesaid they shall continue to be so refused, then and thenceforth\r\nthe same privileges and immunities shall be refused to the vessels of\r\nwar of that country in the ports of the United States; and this refusal\r\nshall continue until war vessels of the United States shall have been\r\nplaced upon an entire equality in the foreign ports aforesaid with\r\nsimilar vessels of other countries.

The President further\r\ndirects that all nonresident foreigners who now are or hereafter shall\r\nbe found in the United States, and who have been or shall have been\r\nengaged in violating the blockade of the insurgent ports, shall leave\r\nthe United States within twelve days from the publication of this order,\r\nor from their subsequent arrival in the United States, if on the\r\nAtlantic side, and forty days if on the Pacific side, of the country;\r\nand such persons shall not return to the United States during the\r\ncontinuance of the war.

The grief of the nation is still fresh. It finds\r\n  some solace in the consideration that he lived to enjoy the highest\r\n  proof of its confidence by entering on the renewed term of the Chief\r\n  Magistracy to which he had been elected; that he brought the civil war\r\n  substantially to a close; that his loss was deplored in all parts of the\r\n  Union, and that foreign nations have rendered justice to his memory.\r\n\r\nHon. E.B. Washburne, of Illinois, immediately after the President's\r\nmessage had been read in the House of Representatives, offered the\r\nfollowing joint resolution, which was unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That a committee of one member from each State represented\r\n  in this House be appointed on the part of this House, to join such\r\n  committee as may be appointed on the part of the Senate, to consider and\r\n  report by what token of respect and affection it may be proper for the\r\n  Congress of the United States to express the deep sensibility of the\r\n  nation to the event of the decease of their late President, Abraham\r\n  Lincoln, and that so much of the message of the President as refers to\r\n  that melancholy event be referred to said committee.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Hon. Solomon Foot, the Senate unanimously concurred in the\r\npassage of the resolution, and the following joint committee was\r\nappointed, thirteen on the part of the Senate and one for every State\r\nrepresented (twenty-four) on the part of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nSenate: Hon. Solomon Foot, Vermont; Hon. Richard Yates, Illinois; Hon.\r\nBenjamin F. Wade, Ohio; Hon. William Pitt Fessenden, Maine; Hon. Henry\r\nWilson, Massachusetts; Hon. James R. Doolittle, Wisconsin; Hon.

Whaley, West Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe joint committee, made the following report, which was concurred in\r\nby both Houses _nem. con._:\r\n\r\n  Whereas the melancholy event of the violent and tragic death of Abraham\r\n  Lincoln, late President of the United States, having occurred during the\r\n  recess of Congress, and the two Houses sharing in the general grief and\r\n  desiring to manifest their sensibility upon the occasion of the public\r\n  bereavement: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Be it resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives\r\n  concurring)_, That the two Houses of Congress will assemble in the Hall\r\n  of the House of Representatives on Monday, the 12th day of February\r\n  next, that being his anniversary birthday, at the hour of 12 m., and\r\n  that, in the presence of the two Houses there assembled, an address upon\r\n  the life and character of Abraham Lincoln, late President of the United\r\n  States, be pronounced by Hon. Edwin M. Stanton,[18] and that the\r\n  President of the Senate _pro tempore_ and the Speaker of the House of\r\n  Representatives be requested to invite the President of the United\r\n  States, the heads of the several Departments, the judges of the Supreme\r\n  Court, the representatives of the foreign governments near this\r\n  Government, and such officers of the Army and Navy as have received the\r\n  thanks of Congress who may then be at the seat of Government to be\r\n  present on the occasion.\r\n\r\n  _And be it further resolved_, That the President of the United States be\r\n  requested to transmit a copy of these resolutions to Mrs. Lincoln, and\r\n  to assure her of the profound sympathy of the two Houses of Congress for\r\n  her deep personal affliction and of their sincere condolence for the\r\n  late national bereavement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Mr. Stanton having declined, Hon. George Bancroft, of New\r\nYork, in response to an invitation from the joint committee, consented\r\nto deliver the address.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[For proclamations of President Johnson recommending, in consequence\r\nof the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, late President of the United\r\nStates, a day for special humiliation and prayer, see pp, 306-307, and\r\nfor Executive order in connection therewith see p. 339.
