It is the welfare of\r\nyour country, it is your whole interest as citizens that is in\r\nquestion while you study history. How it is so I illustrate by\r\nputting before you this subject of the Expansion of England. _I\r\nshow you that there is a vast question ripening for decision,\r\nupon which almost the whole future of our country depends. In\r\nmagnitude this question far surpasses all other questions which\r\nyou can ever have to discuss in political life._'\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR J. R. SEELEY.\r\n\r\nOXFORD: HORACE HART, PRINTER TO THE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{v}\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS book has been written at the request of many friends who\r\nthink that a useful purpose will be served by putting the facts\r\nand arguments which it embodies into a connected form, where\r\nthey will be easily accessible to the ordinary reader, and where\r\neither their fallacies may be exposed or their truth find a\r\nwider recognition. In most of the chief centres of the British\r\nworld both at home and abroad I have found men of all classes,\r\nand not seldom large masses of men, who agreed on the whole with\r\nthe line of thought which I here try to follow; agreed, too,\r\nwith an intensity of belief and a warmth of enthusiasm which\r\nare, I think, rarely found except in connection with great and\r\ntrue causes. This concurrence of other minds has deepened the\r\nprofound conviction which I have long felt that the completion\r\nof a closer and permanent political unity between the British\r\ncommunities scattered throughout the world should be a first aim\r\nof national statesmanship, and might {vi} become, if its\r\nadvantages were clearly understood, a supreme object of popular\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nIt is essentially a subject for full and free discussion.\r\nPermanent national unity for British people can only be based on\r\nan agreement of opinion among at least the larger self-governing\r\ncommunities that the union is for the common good. That there\r\nshould be an absolute unanimity of consenting opinion among the\r\npopulations of the communities concerned we have no reason to\r\nhope. It has never occurred in any large national consolidation\r\nhitherto, and it is not likely to do so now. The continued unity\r\nof the Empire is a political question involving immense issues,\r\nand divergent opinions may be assumed from the start. Indeed, it\r\nbecomes more evident from day to day, to those who watch\r\ncarefully the current of events, that the end can only be\r\ngained--as great ends have ever been gained--after a severe\r\nstruggle between contending forms of thought. The provincialism\r\nwhich has uniformly resisted large national organization; the\r\npessimism which sees danger in every new form of political\r\nevolution; the repugnance to change in an old country with forms\r\nof government more or less fixed; the crudeness of political\r\nthought and want of national perspective in young communities;\r\nthe ignorance which begets inertia: all these exist and must be\r\ncombated. In this struggle the better cause, the strongest\r\narguments, the deepest convictions, the most {vii} strenuous\r\nmoulders of public opinion, will win. Mere circumstances will\r\nnever shape themselves for the required solution. A policy of\r\ndrift will never result in united strength. Growth may be an\r\nunconscious process--organization can only be the result of a\r\nconscious effort. No thinking man today would wish to see the\r\nAmerican Republic resolved into its original sovereign states,\r\nGermany into its kingdoms, small principalities, and duchies;\r\nCanada into its distinct provinces; Italy into its cities. Yet\r\nnone of these would now be what they are had their fortunes been\r\nleft to the drift of circumstances alone. Their history proves\r\nthat the ideals of the clearest minds, backed up by intense\r\nconvictions and resolute effort, are essential to the attainment\r\nof the highest political organization. Circumstances or the\r\ncourse of events may thwart human effort or favour it, but they\r\ncan never take its place as a complete substitute.\r\n\r\nThe further consolidation of the Empire depends in great measure\r\nupon the answer given to two questions. Is it for the advantage\r\nof the different communities that they should remain together?\r\nand, granting an affirmative answer to this, does the problem of\r\nfurther unification on a mutually satisfactory basis present\r\ndifficulties which transcend the resources of British\r\nstatesmanship?\r\n\r\nThese questions roughly indicate the line of enquiry which I\r\nwish to follow. Behind them lies an issue {viii} which British\r\npeople throughout the world will soon be forced to recognize as\r\ninfinitely surpassing in momentous significance any upon which\r\ntheir political thought and energy are now being spent. We may\r\nnot unreasonably believe that the movements at present going on\r\nin the mother-land and the colonies are only supplying us with\r\nthe political formulae required for grappling with the higher\r\nnational problem.\r\n\r\nIt seems like sheer political blindness not to perceive that in\r\ndifferent parts of the Empire forces are now actively at work\r\nwhich may at any moment precipitate a decision of this great\r\nquestion; movements in progress which, it seems safe to say,\r\nmust of necessity lead up to a decision within a time measured\r\nat the very most by one or two decades.\r\n\r\nNations take long to grow, but there are periods when, as in the\r\nlong delayed flowering of certain plants, or in the\r\ncrystallization of chemical solutions, new forms are taken with\r\nextreme rapidity. There are the strongest reasons for believing\r\nthat the British nation has such a period immediately before it.\r\nThe necessity for the creation of a body of sound public opinion\r\nupon the relations to each other of the various parts of the\r\nEmpire is therefore urgent. In stating the case for British\r\nUnity I have constantly found myself merely linking together\r\narguments already used by thinkers in many parts of the Empire.\r\n{ix} Any apology on my part for thus making use of other men's\r\nthoughts, is unnecessary. Earnest believers in a great cause\r\nonly wish that the grounds of their belief should be made known\r\nas widely as possible.\r\n\r\nNo one can be more conscious than myself of the incompleteness\r\nof the statement which I have tried to make. But even a partial\r\nstudy of a great subject may serve a useful purpose. If what is\r\nhere said furnish to the advocates of National Unity some texts\r\nupon which they may enlarge and improve, if it provoke that\r\nhonest criticism which leads to a firmer grasp of truth, I shall\r\nbe more than satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{x}\r\n\r\n{xi}\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER I.

The fact is proved and the boast is\r\njustified by British history, but behind them, no doubt, is a\r\nrace characteristic. A special capacity for political\r\norganization may, without race vanity, be fairly claimed for\r\nAnglo-Saxon people.\r\n\r\nThe tests which have already been, or are now being, applied to\r\nthis organizing capacity are sufficiently striking and varied.\r\nIn the British Islands themselves a gradual and steady process\r\nof evolution, extending over hundreds of years, has led up from\r\nthe free but weak and disjointed government of the Heptarchy\r\nperiod to the equally free but strong and consolidated\r\ngovernment of the United Kingdom. In the United States, within\r\nlittle more than a hundred {2} years, we have seen one great\r\nbranch of the race weld into organic unity a number of loosely\r\naggregated provinces under a system which now extends over half\r\nthe area of a great continent. Twenty-five years ago the process\r\nwas repeated on the other half of the American continent. In the\r\nface of difficulties, by many believed to be insuperable,\r\nCanada, stretching from ocean to ocean a distance of nearly 4000\r\nmiles, has become a political unit, and already exhibits a\r\ncohesion which small European States have often only gained\r\nafter long periods of internal and external conflict.\r\n\r\nOn another continent Australians, dealing with provinces larger\r\nin area than European empires, are grappling courageously with\r\nthe problem of political combination, and the universal\r\nconfidence felt in the ultimate success of their efforts shows\r\nwhat reliance is put upon the strength and efficiency of the\r\nrace instinct. In South Africa and the West Indies the\r\nconsiderable intermixture of coloured races complicates the\r\nquestion, but here too the forces which make for unity are more\r\nor less actively at work.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally we may say that in the long course of\r\nAnglo-Saxon history whenever the need of combination has arisen\r\nthe political expedient has been devised to match the political\r\nnecessity. This capacity for adequate organization has been the\r\nkeynote of distinction between the democracy of our race and all\r\nthe democracies by which it has been preceded.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to think that this organizing quality {3} is one\r\nwhich has given effectiveness to all others. The steadiness of\r\nthe advance which the race has made in social and industrial\r\ndirections has depended upon the security given by political\r\norganization at once comprehensive, flexible, and strong. No\r\nother branch of the human family has ever been so free to apply\r\nitself to the higher problems of civilization.\r\n\r\nAll the conditions of the world at the present time point to the\r\nconclusion that further progress must be safe-guarded in the\r\nsame way. On the one hand, we see an extraordinary organization\r\nof military power and a widening of military combination among\r\nEuropean nations to which the past furnishes no parallel, and\r\nwhich suggest hitherto unheard-of possibilities of conflict or\r\naggression. On the other hand, the vast extension of industrial\r\nand commercial interests among British people, without any\r\nparallel in the previous history of the world, seems to demand a\r\ncorresponding widening of the political combination which is\r\nrequired to give them security.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the amazing spread of the race has become the main\r\nfact of modern history--the one which assuredly will have the\r\nmost decisive influence on the future of mankind. Only within\r\nthe last hundred years, one might almost say within a still\r\nnarrower limit of time, has this been fully realized. The\r\ntentative efforts of Spaniards, Portuguese, Dutch, and French to\r\ndominate the new continents opened up by the discoveries at the\r\nend of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncenturies did not {4} receive a decisive check till towards the\r\nend of the eighteenth. Then the new tide fairly began to flow.\r\nThe flux of civilized population, by which new and great centres\r\nof human activity are created, has since that time been so\r\noverwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon that nearly all minor currents are\r\nabsorbed or assimilated by it. Teuton, Latin, Scandinavian, with\r\none or two limited but well-defined exceptions, lose their\r\nidentity and tend to disappear in the dominant mass of British\r\npopulation which has flowed, and continues in scarcely abated\r\nvolume to flow, steadily away from the mother islands to occupy\r\nthose temperate regions which are manifestly destined to become\r\nin an increasing degree centres of the world's force.\r\n\r\nWith abundant space on which to expand, increase has been rapid,\r\nand it would seem that in mere mass of numbers English-speaking\r\npeople are destined at no distant date to surpass any other\r\nbranch of the human stock.\r\n\r\nThat an expansion so vast should bring in its train a new set of\r\npolitical problems, with a range wider than any that had gone\r\nbefore, is only natural. That new hopes should be conceived from\r\nthis wonderful change in the balance of the world's forces; that\r\nnew plans should be devised to utilize it, as other expansions\r\nhave been utilized, for the good of our race and of mankind, is\r\nequally natural.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to point out that the conditions\r\nincidental to this expansion were at first misunderstood. The\r\nignorance of public opinion as to the true {5} relations between\r\nmother-land and colonies, seconded by the blindness and\r\nobstinacy of politicians waging a bitter party fight, produced\r\nin 1776 the great schism of the Anglo-Saxon race. Chatham,\r\nBurke, and many of the clearest minds of England, believed that\r\nthe American Revolution was unnecessary--in America itself there\r\nwas a large, and for a long time a preponderant party, which\r\nheld that in constitutional change a way of escape could be\r\nfound from Revolution. The worse counsels prevailed, and\r\nRevolution took the place of Reform and Readjustment. It is, no\r\ndoubt, idle to speculate upon the results which might have\r\nfollowed from a different line of action; if the statesmen of\r\nthat day had proved equal to the task of dealing with the\r\npolitical problem with which they were confronted. The idea that\r\nthe separation of the United States from Great Britain was a\r\npure gain to either country or to the world may, however, be\r\ndistinctly challenged.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that the earlier ripening of public\r\nopinion in England upon the question of slavery, and the earlier\r\nsolution found for it on peaceful lines, might have helped to\r\nsolve the problem at an earlier stage in America as well, and\r\nthus prevented the frightful catastrophe of the War of Secession\r\nin 1865. The close and intimate political reaction upon each\r\nother of the two greatest Anglo-Saxon communities, the one with\r\nits higher standard of statesmanship and public morality, the\r\nother with its more active liberalizing tendencies, might have\r\nbeen in the highest {6} degree healthful for both. United with\r\nall others of their own race and language, British people might\r\nhave been able, in self-sufficing strength, to withdraw almost a\r\nhundred years earlier than could otherwise be possible from the\r\nentanglements of European politics, and to be free to devote all\r\ntheir energies to the maintenance of peace, and the development\r\nof industry, commerce, and civilization. Qualifications to these\r\nviews will, of course, present themselves to every mind, and it\r\nis not necessary to press them too far or to quarrel with the\r\ncourse of history. Much more important is it to observe its\r\nresults and learn the lessons which it teaches.\r\n\r\nWe now see that the bifurcation of Anglo-Saxon national life\r\nwhich took place in 1776 was of all other events in modern\r\nhistory the one most pregnant with great consequences. The war\r\nof the Revolution led primarily to the foundation of the\r\nRepublic of the United States. Its significance, however, is not\r\nexhausted by this fact, great though it is. The reflex action\r\nupon the thought and policy of Britain involved consequences as\r\nimportant and far-reaching. Revolution for once in our\r\ndevelopment had taken the place of Evolution, but in the end\r\nenabled the latter to resume its steady course. The revolt of\r\nthe American colonies led to the closer study of the principles\r\nwhich must control national expansion. Britain strove, and not\r\nin vain, to acquire the art of bringing colonies into friendly\r\nrelation with the national system. The nation-building energy of\r\nher people remained unimpaired, {7} and though one group of\r\ncolonies had been lost, others, extending over areas far more\r\nextensive, were soon gained. Under new principles of government\r\nthese were acquired, not to be lost, but retained as they have\r\nbeen up to the present time. Is that retention to be permanent?\r\nIs it desirable? Can the colonies be brought, and ought they to\r\nbe brought, not merely into friendly relations, but into organic\r\nharmony with the national system? Has our capacity for political\r\norganization reached its utmost limit? For British people this\r\nis the question of questions. In the whole range of possible\r\npolitical variation in the future there is no issue of such\r\nfar-reaching significance, not merely for our own people but for\r\nthe world at large, as the question whether the British Empire\r\nshall remain a political unit for all national purposes, or,\r\nyielding to disintegrating forces, shall allow the stream of the\r\nnational life to be parted into many separate channels.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago it seemed as if English people, and it\r\ncertainly was true that the majority of English statesmen, had\r\nmade up their minds definitely as to the only possible and\r\ndesirable solution to this great national problem. The old\r\nAmerican colonies had gone, and had remained none the less good\r\ncustomers of the mother-country for having become independent.\r\nVery soon, it was sincerely believed, the whole world would be\r\nconverted to Free Trade, and with universal free trade and the\r\nuniversal peace which was to follow, nothing was to be gained\r\nfrom retaining the colonies, {8} while the colonies themselves\r\nwere expected to look eagerly forward to complete political\r\nemancipation as the goal of their development. A few brilliant\r\nwriters in the press, a few eloquent speakers on the platform,\r\ngave much vogue to these views. The correspondence of prominent\r\npublic men which has since come to light, the recollections of\r\nmen still living, furnish convincing proof that this opinion was\r\nwidely accepted in official circles. A governor, leaving to take\r\ncharge of an Australian colony, was told even from the Colonial\r\nOffice that he would probably be the last representative of the\r\nCrown sent out from Britain. This tendency of official thought\r\nfound its culmination when, in 1866, a great journal frankly\r\nwarned Canada, the greatest of all the colonies, that it was\r\ntime to prepare for the separation from the mother-land that\r\nmust needs come. The shock which this outspoken declaration gave\r\nto Canadian sentiment, built up as it had been on a century of\r\nloyalty to the idea of a United Empire, was very great. That\r\nstatesman and journalist alike had misconceived the temper of\r\nthe British as well as of the colonial mind was soon made\r\nmanifest. This was shown by the almost universal applause which\r\ngreeted the passionately indignant protest of Tennyson, when, in\r\nthe final dedication to the Queen of his Idylls, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    'And that true North[1], whereof we lately heard\r\n    A strain to shame us--keep you to yourselves: {9}\r\n    So loyal is too costly! friends, your love\r\n    Is but a burden: break the bonds and go!\r\n    Is this the tone of Empire! Here the faith\r\n    That made us rulers! This indeed her voice\r\n    And meaning, whom the roar of Hougoumont\r\n    Left mightiest of all nations under heaven!\r\n    What shock has fooled her since that she should speak\r\n    So feebly?'\r\n\r\nAt once it became clear that here the real heart of Britain\r\nspoke--that poet rather than politician grasped with greater\r\naccuracy the true drift of British thought.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that from that day to this the policy\r\nof separation, as the true theoretical outcome of {10} national\r\nevolution, has been slowly but steadily dying. John Bright held\r\nthe theory in England almost up to the end of his great career.\r\nGoldwin Smith advocates it in Canada still. Of their views I\r\nshall have more to say later. But among conspicuous names theirs\r\nhave stood practically alone. Politicians in Britain do not\r\nwish, and if they wished, would scarcely dare, to advocate it on\r\npublic platforms. Separation may come under the compulsion of\r\nnecessity, from the incapacity of statesmen to work out an\r\neffective plan of union, or as the result of national apathy and\r\nignorance--not because it is desired, or from any theoretical\r\nbelief in its advantage to the people concerned.\r\n\r\nIf we lay aside, however, the question of national feeling, or\r\nnational interest, and look upon the matter as simply one of\r\nconstitutional growth and change, it is little wonder that the\r\nstatesmen of that earlier period took the view they did.\r\n\r\nI have in my possession a document which seems to me of much\r\nhistorical interest in this connection as furnishing concrete\r\nevidence of the direction of political thought at the period to\r\nwhich I have referred. It is the printed draft of a Bill\r\nprepared with great care more than twenty-five years ago by Lord\r\nThring, whose long service as Parliamentary counsel to\r\nsuccessive Cabinets has given him an experience in the practical\r\nforms of English legislation quite unrivalled. The Bill was\r\nintended to be a logical sequel to those measures of Imperial\r\nlegislation by which responsible government was {11} granted to\r\nthe Canadian and Australian colonies. The new constitutions had\r\nthen been in operation for some time in several of the great\r\ncolonies, and already no slight friction had occurred in the\r\nendeavour to adjust Imperial and Colonial rights and\r\nresponsibilities upon a clear and well-understood basis.\r\nMoreover, the continued formation of new colonies and the desire\r\nof certain Crown colonies to attain to responsible government\r\nsuggested a fundamental treatment of the whole question of\r\ncolonial relations. The Bill therefore embodies an attempt to\r\nput upon a just basis the relations between Britain and her\r\ncolonies at each period of their growth, and to state clearly\r\ntheir mutual obligations and mutual duties.\r\n\r\nIt naturally provides in the first place for the government of\r\nsettlements in their earlier stages of growth under the absolute\r\njurisdiction of the Crown.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the transition of such a Crown settlement\r\ninto the rank and status of a colony with responsible government\r\nis not left to be decided by agitation within the colonies or by\r\nirregular pressure in other directions, such as lately took\r\nplace in the case of Western Australia; but it is made to depend\r\non a definite increase of European population and other\r\nconditions equally applicable to all colonies alike. With the\r\ngrant of responsible government, however, comes a clear division\r\nbetween imperial and local powers, and an equally definite\r\ndistribution of burdens; the guarantee to the colony of\r\nprotection from foreign aggression being contingent upon the\r\ncontribution by {12} the colony of the revenue or money required\r\nfor defence in fair proportion to its wealth and population.\r\n\r\nLastly, 'as the natural termination of a connection in itself of\r\na temporary character' (to use the words of the preface to the\r\nBill), provision is made for the formal separation of a colony\r\nand its erection into an independent state when its people feel\r\nequal to under-taking the full range of national responsibility.\r\nDirect provision is made for independence only at the colony's\r\nown request, but it is suggested that separation might be\r\nbrought about by coercive proclamation on the part of the\r\nmother-country in case the colony fails to perform the national\r\nduties which it accepted with responsible government.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this proposed legislation seems to me to lie in\r\nthe proof which it furnishes that the grant of responsible\r\ngovernment was by no means regarded as giving finality to\r\nnational relations, but only as marking a stage in colonial\r\ndevelopment. The view thus taken by Lord Thring in England was\r\nthe view taken by Joseph Howe in Canada, to whose opinions I\r\nshall have occasion hereafter to refer.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the Bill lay in the fact that it placed upon a\r\ndefined and easily understood footing the relations of\r\nmother-land and colony so long as they remained together; and\r\nprovided a constitutional way of escape from the connection when\r\nit had ceased to give satisfaction to either party. Its\r\npeculiarity, indicative of the opinions prevailing at the time,\r\nis that no notice is taken of the possibility of a colony rising\r\n{13} to a place of greatness and power inconsistent with a\r\nstrictly subordinate colonial relation, and yet desiring to\r\nperpetuate its organic connection with the nation.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the United States provides that new\r\nsettlements, though thousands of miles from the centre of\r\ngovernment, and as truly colonies as those of Britain, shall\r\nrise from the condition of territories into that of states,\r\nunder which they enjoy the full national franchise, and assume a\r\nfull share of national responsibility. In a like manner Lord\r\nThring's Bill fairly faced the fact that for communities such as\r\nthose which British people were forming, the colonial stage was\r\ntemporary and transitional, and it provided, in a different\r\nsense, but in accord with existing conditions and beliefs, a\r\nfixed goal for colonial aspirations, and a fixed limit to the\r\nresponsibilities of the mother-land.\r\n\r\nThe framer of this Bill is now, I have reason to think, among\r\nthose who believe that a very different end of colonial\r\ndevelopment is both desirable and practicable. Such a reversal\r\nof opinion is the natural outcome of the extraordinary changes\r\nwhich have passed over the national life. The extension of\r\ncommercial and industrial relations, the growth of common\r\ninterests, the increased facility for communication, above all,\r\nthe retention in the colonies, under their new systems of free\r\ngovernment, of a strong national sentiment, and the absence of\r\nthe anticipated desire to break the national connection, have\r\nthrown new light upon the whole question.\r\n\r\n{14}\r\n\r\nIn that new light it now seems that there is an argument well\r\nnigh unanswerable, which goes to prove that so far from being a\r\nmatter of indifference, the separation from the Empire of anyone\r\nof our great groups of colonies would be an event pregnant with\r\nanxieties and possible disaster alike to the colonies and to the\r\nmother-land, and so far from being the natural line of political\r\ndevelopment, that separation would be as unnatural as it is\r\nunnecessary. It is this thought that has given birth to the idea\r\nof national federation, to the conviction in many minds that the\r\nchief effort of our national statesmanship should be directed to\r\nsecuring the continued unity of the wide-spread British Empire,\r\nto resisting any tendency towards that disintegration which a\r\ngeneration ago was looked forward to with comparative unconcern.\r\nThis is not the thought of mere theorists or enthusiasts.\r\nStatesmen and thinkers of the first rank both in the mother-land\r\nand the colonies, while reserving their judgment as to the lines\r\non which complete unity can be gained, have strongly affirmed\r\ntheir belief that it is the true goal for our national\r\naspirations, that the question is one of supreme concern for the\r\nwhole Empire, and that the problem must soon be grappled with in\r\npractical politics.\r\n\r\nNot the creation, but the preservation of national unity, is the\r\ntask which thus confronts British people, which they must accept\r\nor refuse. Unity already exists: it is the necessary\r\nstarting-point of every discussion. It will prove, if need be,\r\nan incalculable assistance {15} towards the attainment of the\r\ncompleter unity at which we aim. But the existing unity is crude\r\nin form, one which in its very nature is temporary and\r\ntransitional, one which ignores or violates political principles\r\ningrained in the English mind as essential to any finality in\r\npolitical development, and which already results in gross\r\ninequalities in the conditions of citizenship throughout the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe logic by which this position is proved seems irresistible in\r\nits appeal to the mind of the ordinary British citizen. It is\r\nwell to be clear on this point.\r\n\r\nThe essence of British political thought, the very foundation\r\nupon which our freedom, political stability, and singular\r\ncollective energy as a nation have been built up, may be\r\nexpressed in two words--Representative Government. The loyalty\r\nof the subject and the faithfulness of the ruler spring alike\r\nfrom this. The willingness to bear public burdens, the deep\r\ninterest in public affairs, the close study and careful\r\napplication of political principles which distinguish the people\r\nof our race from all others, and the advance of the whole body\r\npolitic towards greater individual freedom combined with greater\r\ncollective strength, are all direct outgrowths of Representative\r\nGovernment. Other races may work out other systems and attain\r\ngreatness in doing so; we have committed ourselves to this, so\r\nfar as dealing with our own people is concerned. From the local\r\nboard which settles the poor-rate or school-tax for a parish, to\r\nthe Cabinet which deals with the highest concerns of the Empire\r\nand the world, {16} this principle is the central element of\r\nstrength, since it is the ground on which public confidence is\r\nbased. A British subject who has no voice in influencing the\r\ngovernment of the nation throughout the whole range of its\r\noperation has not reached that condition to which the whole\r\nspirit of our political philosophy points as the state of full\r\ncitizenship. We are on absolutely safe ground when we say that\r\ngreat English communities will not permanently consent to stop\r\nshort of this citizenship, nor will they relegate to others,\r\neven to a majority of their own nationality, the uncontrolled\r\ndirection of their most important interests.\r\n\r\nWith certain qualifications, introduced to mitigate the glaring\r\nanomaly of the situation, the great self-governing colonies of\r\nthe Empire are in fact now compelled to allow many of their most\r\nimportant affairs to be managed by others. Canada, with a\r\ncommercial navy which floats on every sea, holding already in\r\nthis particular the fourth place among the nations of the world,\r\nhas a voice in fixing international relations only by the\r\ncourtesy of the mother-land, and not by the defined right of\r\nequal citizenship. Australia, occupying a continent, with vast\r\nand growing commercial interests, is in the same anomalous\r\nposition. English-speaking, self-governing populations,\r\namounting in the aggregate already to nearly a third of the\r\npopulation of the United Kingdom, and likely within little more\r\nthan a generation to equal it, with enormous interests involved\r\nin nearly every movement of national affairs, {17} have no\r\ndirect representative influence in shaping national policy or\r\narranging international relations.\r\n\r\nThe almost perfect freedom they enjoy in the control of local\r\naffairs accentuates rather than mitigates the anomaly. By\r\naccustoming them to the exercise of political rights it makes\r\nthem impatient of anything which falls short of the full dignity\r\nof national citizenship.\r\n\r\nNo one who understands the genius of Anglo-Saxon people can\r\nbelieve that this state of affairs will be permanent. No one who\r\nsympathizes with the spirit which has constantly urged forward\r\nBritish people on their career of political progress can wish it\r\nto be so. Great countries with an assured future cannot always\r\nremain colonies, as that term has hitherto been understood. The\r\nsystem which persists in making no other provision for them is\r\non the point of passing away.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes urged that freedom from national burdens should\r\nbe enough to reconcile colonists to any lack of representation\r\nin national counsels; that if they have no sufficient share of\r\nImperial Government they are at least rid of Imperial anxieties;\r\nthat wise direction of affairs may, in any case, be looked for\r\nfrom the mother-land. But no immunity from public burdens, can\r\ncompensate for the loss of a share in the higher life of the\r\nnation and the higher dignity of full citizenship: no honourable\r\ncareer can result from a readiness to shirk responsibility: a\r\nwillingness to rely upon others to do our {18} work or protect\r\nour interests is not the spirit which has built up or will\r\nperpetuate the power of our race. Such argument may suit the\r\ninfancy of colonies; applied to their adolescence it is\r\ndegrading, since it implies a mean and contented dependence. If\r\nthe greater British colonies are permanently content with their\r\npresent political status they are unworthy of the source from\r\nwhich they sprang. It will not be so. The spirit of independence\r\nhas developed, not degenerated, in the wider breathing space of\r\nnew continents. A very little further growth, increasing the\r\ncomplication and aggravating the anomaly of the existing\r\nsituation, will bring us to a stage where that spirit will no\r\nlonger endure the restraints now put upon it by practical\r\ndifficulties of political organization, and where those\r\ndifficulties must be swept away by the gathering force of\r\nnational instincts and necessities. About the direction of\r\nchange there may be a question; about the certainty of change\r\nthere can be none.\r\n\r\nBut the argument is equally strong when we reverse our attitude,\r\nand place ourselves in the position of the taxpaying citizens of\r\nthe United Kingdom. There are probably few of these who are not\r\nat times filled with a glow of pride and enthusiasm when they\r\nthink of the vast extent of those colonies, which, planted by\r\nBritish energy, held through years of conflict by British\r\ncourage, and proudly inheriting British traditions, are rising\r\nto pre-eminence in every quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\n{19}\r\n\r\nThis pride and enthusiasm have very positive and practical\r\nissues. The citizen of the remotest colony knows that should an\r\nenemy wantonly attack his frontier--should port or city be\r\nthreatened by a hostile force--almost within twenty-four hours,\r\nas soon as telegraph could summon or steam convey them, British\r\nsailors or British soldiers would be pouring thither, as ready\r\nto fight and die for that particular bit of soil as for the\r\nshores of England itself. But the sentiment which makes this\r\npossible is balanced and qualified by very different\r\nconsiderations. The citizen of the United Kingdom has often been\r\ncompelled to regard the colonies as great dependencies which\r\nincreased his responsibilities and multiplied his difficulties\r\nwithout returning to the mother-country, under their present\r\norganization, strength in men or resources, or even in exclusive\r\ncommercial advantage. Every new colony or colonial interest was\r\nto him something new to defend, and augmented the burden of\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nYearly the vast expense necessary to provide adequately for\r\nnational responsibilities increased, and added itself to the\r\nweight of taxation incident to an advanced civilization and\r\ncomplex social system. While forced to bear the chief burden of\r\nthe taxation required for national defence, the people of the\r\nBritish Islands could see that the mass of the colonists\r\nbenefited by this protection already possessed, or were likely\r\nbefore long to possess a higher average of wealth and comfort\r\nthan the mass of the people {20} who bestowed the benefit.\r\nLooking forward little more than a generation he could foresee a\r\ntime when the colonists whose commerce was protected would equal\r\nin number the whole home population which gave the protection,\r\nwhen the volume of colonial commerce itself would surpass that\r\nof the mother-land.\r\n\r\nIt requires little argument to prove that the anomaly of leaving\r\none part of a nation to bear a disproportionate share of the\r\nburdens of the whole is as inconsistent with Anglo-Saxon ideas\r\nof government as the exclusion of the colonies from a\r\nproportionate voice in the conduct of national affairs.\r\n\r\nAn effective method of illustrating this anomalous condition of\r\nthe Empire and of British citizenship at the present time is to\r\nconsider the immediate change which takes place in the political\r\nprivileges and responsibilities of a man who shifts his\r\nresidence from the mother-country to Canada, Australia, or any\r\nother great colony. He crosses the ocean, perhaps, to carry on\r\nin another part of the Empire the business of the the bank, or\r\ncommercial house, or shipping firm with which he is connected\r\nhere. Such of his interests as require national protection\r\nremain the same, and continue to enjoy security under the\r\nBritish flag. He continues to take precisely the same interest\r\nas before in the national welfare. But he loses at once the\r\nright to influence national policy by his vote, and at the same\r\ntime he drops his old responsibilities of citizenship, since he\r\nno longer pays the same proportion {21} of the taxes which make\r\nthe nation strong to protect him.\r\n\r\nTake again a crucial case as applied to the working man. In\r\nAustralia one finds nearly 100,000,000 of sheep. The shepherding\r\nand shearing of these sheep, the packing, carriage, and shipping\r\nof their wool, give employment to a large section of the\r\nindustrial population. Nearly all this wool finds its market in\r\nEngland, where the manufacture of a portion of it gives\r\nemployment to an immense population in centres such as the West\r\nRiding of Yorkshire and parts of Scotland. The safety of this\r\nwool in passing from the Australian centre of production to the\r\nBritish centre of manufacture is essential to the prosperity of\r\nthe people in both. To this end Australian ports are made strong\r\nat Australian expense and British ports at British expense. So\r\nfar all is fair and the distribution of the burden on industry\r\nis equal. But between the two countries lie 12,000 miles of sea\r\nto be guarded, and this is effectively done at enormous naval\r\nand military expense, the burden of which, however, is almost\r\nexclusively borne at the British end of the line. The proportion\r\npaid by the Australian workman is comparatively insignificant.\r\nYet he is the one who earns the higher wages and feels the\r\npressure of taxation less.\r\n\r\nI have heard a working man in a large public meeting in\r\nAustralia assert that the position viewed from this aspect was\r\nunfair, and he added that he personally was far better able to\r\nbear an equal share {22} of national burdens as a working man in\r\nAustralia than he had ever been as a working man in Britain. He\r\nwas certainly as competent to exercise the national franchise.\r\n\r\nThe illustration thus taken from a single colony and a single\r\ndepartment of industry has, of course, a wide application.\r\nWhether viewed, then, from a purely British or a purely colonial\r\nstandpoint there are unanswerable reasons, and they are equally\r\nunanswerable from either side, which point to an early\r\nmodification of the national system.\r\n\r\nEspecially is it to be noted, however, that the circumstances\r\nwhich have developed this great problem have not arisen, like\r\nmany other political problems, from injustice or mismanagement\r\nin the past, or from any causes tending to provoke mutual\r\nrecrimination. Through the simple processes of growth and\r\nchange, the conditions which satisfied the demands of national\r\nlife in the past have become insufficient to satisfy its\r\nnecessities for the future. Nothing could possibly be more\r\nhelpful for the solution of the question than this fact, that\r\nmen are able to approach it entirely free from party feuds and\r\nlocal animosities.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, have not the inconsistency and the\r\ntemporary character of the existing national system been all\r\nalong obvious to every one? Why does the public attention\r\nrequire to be directed to facts so manifest? Perhaps the best\r\nanswer is to be found in the wonderful rapidity of the changes\r\nwhich have been going on, and the intense {23} absorption of\r\nBritish people, both at home and abroad, in the actual processes\r\nof national evolution, which left no time for studying their\r\nindirect results.\r\n\r\nWithin the last century, and mainly within the last half\r\ncentury, the United Kingdom has passed through the most\r\nstrenuous period of industrial development known in the history\r\nof nations. The social system has been revolutionized by an\r\nextraordinary increment of wealth, an immense increase of\r\npopulation, and its concentration in towns, with all the\r\ndifficult problems which these changes involve. Political\r\nthought has had enough to do to adjust the balance between\r\ndecreasing rural and increasing urban constituencies--to meet\r\nthe wants of a democracy advancing in prosperity and\r\nintelligence, to maintain an equilibrium between new and\r\nconflicting forces. Moral effort has been strained to the utmost\r\nin dealing with education, sanitation, social reformation, and\r\nkindred questions, a deepening sense of public responsibility in\r\nsuch matters going hand in hand with an almost paralyzing\r\nincrease in the masses to be dealt with. Under such\r\ncircumstances it is scarcely to be wondered at that British\r\npeople within the United Kingdom have been too much absorbed in\r\nwhat was directly before them to weigh carefully the results of\r\nwhat was going on abroad; that even when most active in external\r\nas well as internal affairs they seem to have conquered and\r\npeopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind.'\r\n\r\n{24}\r\n\r\nIn the colonies the preoccupation of thought and energy has with\r\nequal reason been as complete. It is scarce fifty years since\r\nthe Canadian provinces obtained local self-government. The last\r\nhalf century has witnessed the growth of a most complete system\r\nof municipal and provincial institutions, crowned by a great act\r\nof constructive statesmanship in Confederation. The organization\r\nof half a continent on material lines has kept pace with each\r\nstep in political construction. Railroads, canals, telegraphs,\r\npostal facilities, steamboat communication, all the machinery of\r\nmodern civilization, have been widely applied to an immense\r\narea.\r\n\r\nIn Australia movement has been even more rapid and engrossing.\r\nMelbourne has changed in fifty years from a village of a\r\nthousand inhabitants to a city of 500,000. Australian commerce,\r\nin its infancy when the Queen came to the throne, now equals\r\nthat of the United Kingdom at the same date. New Zealand, then\r\nthe home of mere savages, has already a British population which\r\nexports annually £10,000,000 worth of the products of civilized\r\nlabour. In South Africa half a continent is being organized\r\nunder conditions of extreme difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the rush of progress so swift as this, the mass of men are\r\nconscious chiefly of the work immediately before them. But as\r\nthis work grows under their hands, the vast external interests\r\nare created, and the wide external connections grow up, which\r\ncompel attention to the larger problems which they involve.\r\n\r\n{25}\r\n\r\nThe local politician, as provinces consolidate, is, by a process\r\nof natural compulsion, changed into the statesman with a\r\nnational and international range of political vision.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost superfluous to point out that in striving for\r\ncloser consolidation British people would be following strictly\r\nalong the lines of the most striking national movements of\r\nmodern times. They would be merely keeping abreast of the spirit\r\nof the age.\r\n\r\nFor the idea of national unity the people of the United States\r\ntwenty-five years ago made sacrifices of life and money without\r\na parallel in modern history. No one now doubts that the end\r\njustified the enormous expenditure of national force. 'The Union\r\nmust be preserved' was the pregnant sentence into which Lincoln\r\ncondensed the national duty of the moment, and to maintain this\r\nprinciple he was able to concentrate the national energy for a\r\nsupreme effort. The strong man who saved the great republic from\r\ndisruption takes his place, without a question, among the\r\nbenefactors of mankind.\r\n\r\nGermany struggled through years of difficulty, conflict, and\r\nswaying tides of national passion towards the ideal of a united\r\nfatherland. The ideal has been realised; the men who made its\r\nattainment possible have won, not merely the gratitude of their\r\ncountrymen, but the world's respect as well; even their acts of\r\ndespotism are forgiven and more than half forgotten in the\r\nmomentous significance of their one supreme {26} achievement.\r\nToday it seems as if their work of consolidated strength was the\r\nbest guarantee of Europe's peace.\r\n\r\nCavour's statue stands in the squares of Italian cities--his\r\nname lingers in Italian hearts. To Tuscan, Lombard, and\r\nNeapolitan alike he is 'our great Cavour'--the man whose\r\ncourageous genius found a basis in facts for the conception of\r\nItalian unity, whose patient and resolute diplomacy made\r\npossible the satisfaction of the national aspiration.\r\n\r\nCanada has placed first on her roll of greatness the statesman,\r\nto whom she mainly owes the achievement of Federal unity. Thus\r\nbeyond a doubt the men who have graven their names most deeply\r\non the history of our time are those who have carried out in\r\nmany lands and under varying conditions the work of national\r\nconsolidation. American unity, German unity, Italian unity,\r\nAustro-Hungarian unity--the expansion of Russia without loss of\r\nunity--these are the accomplished facts of our time which we\r\nhave to face. More than this. We do not need the philosophical\r\nhistorian to tell us, for the process is going on under our own\r\neyes, that a governing tendency of the age is towards the union\r\nof many states into combinations of nearly equal\r\nstrength--sometimes by fusion, sometimes by federation,\r\nsometimes by alliance. On the practical equipoise of two such\r\ngreat groups the equilibrium of Europe at this moment depends.\r\nRace adds its influence to the tendency.\r\nPan-Sclavism--Pan-Latinism--Pan-Teutonism {27} are more than\r\nnames. They are forces which play their part in moulding the\r\ndestinies of nations and governments. The aspect of the whole\r\nworld irresistibly suggests the thought that we are passing from\r\na nation epoch to a federation epoch. That British people should\r\nfall in with this tendency is in the strict line of historical\r\ncontinuity. 'From clans in the north,' it has been truly said,\r\n'and from a heptarchy in the south, England and Scotland grew\r\ninto nations and thence into one nation.' In the great offshoots\r\nof the race abroad the tendency is renewed, and each step\r\nprepares the way for another and greater effort. To consolidate\r\nthe empire which Chatham founded is the one manifest opportunity\r\nremaining in the British world for British statesmen to place\r\ntheir names in our history beside those of the greatest of the\r\nstatesmen of the past.\r\n\r\nFor the mother-land an organized national unity means, not\r\ndegradation from her imperial position, but a frank acceptance\r\nof the facts of national growth, and the greater dignity which\r\nwould come from acknowledged leadership of the free communities\r\nwhich have grown up around her.\r\n\r\nPrussia gained, instead of losing, in dignity, when many of the\r\nhigher functions of her historic parliament became merged in\r\nthose of the Reichstag of the German people, when she gave up\r\nher individual place as a nation in Europe to assume the\r\nleadership of the German Empire. So would it be with Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n{28}\r\n\r\nFor the colonies national unity means independence: not\r\n'virtual' independence, as their present ill-defined condition\r\nis sometimes spoken of, but the manly and sufficient\r\nindependence which comes from asserted rights and assumed\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of independence. The first is that of the\r\nson grown restless under tutelage, who throws himself off, more\r\nor less recklessly, from the family connection, refuses family\r\nadvice or assistance, and takes the chances of life on his own\r\naccount. Given, on the one hand, overbearing and unsympathetic\r\nparents anxious to retain their control till the last moment,\r\nor, on the other, children filled with ignorant self-conceit and\r\nconsequent discontent, and independence of this first type is\r\nthe natural result. Sometimes it is justified, and succeeds;\r\nsometimes it is born of blind stupidity and makes lamentable\r\nshipwreck. But this is not the ideal or the only form of\r\nindependence. Given reason, due consideration, mutual regard for\r\nrights on both sides, and the family tie becomes a partnership\r\nwhich combines the advantages of all the liberty required for\r\nfull development with the unity of action and counsel which\r\nassures strength. It produces a great Rothschild firm, each head\r\nof which is free to work out his own views at his own centre of\r\nthe world's finance, but each in touch with the other for\r\ncounsel or action, each making use of the business machinery\r\nestablished by all the rest, and thus securing incomparable\r\nbusiness advantages for all. So in a wider sphere it produces\r\nthe nation--the great {29} American Republic--the Swiss,\r\nGermanic, or Canadian Confederation; each state or group of\r\nstates working independently within its own well-defined sphere\r\nof influence; each taking its share as freely in the equally\r\nwell-defined but wider orbit of a large national life.\r\n\r\nOur admiration is not given to the independence of the American\r\nstate, or the Canadian or Australian province when holding aloof\r\nfrom union, where we feel that a spirit of petty provincialism\r\nis at work. Nor can it be reasonably given to the independence\r\nof the Greek state impatient of any control beyond that which is\r\nfound within a city's walls. At least, in this case, if we\r\nadmire, we pity still more, for the lack of the power to\r\npreserve the liberty which the city had created. We reserve our\r\nadmiration for the reasoned and secured independence of a state\r\nwhose members have abandoned the petty side of their\r\nindividuality, and displayed that political self-restraint,\r\nsagacity, and largeness of view which is implied in wide\r\norganization for the attainment of great ends.\r\n\r\nIt is to this independence of partnership that a real national\r\nunity would lift the colonies of the British Empire. Doubtless\r\nit would at first be the partnership of junior members. More\r\nthan this could not reasonably be expected. But the position\r\nneed not be an irksome one.\r\n\r\nOne primary principle reason approves and experience recommends\r\nfor our guidance in attempting to outline the form of union\r\nwhich will best be adapted {30} to the genius of the British\r\npeople. For all its communities there should be the utmost\r\nfreedom of individual action which is consistent with united\r\nstrength. Apparently this condition will be best fulfilled under\r\nsome form of Federal connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Lord Dufferin dedicated a Canadian edition of his 'Letters\r\nfrom High Latitudes' in the words 'To that true North.' I cannot\r\nrefrain from connecting with these lines one more association\r\nwhich will, I feel sure, in Canadian hearts at least, add a\r\ntender grace to the vigorous thought of the poet and the\r\ndelicate compliment of the politician. I am able to do so\r\nthrough the accident of a conversation with the late Rev.\r\nDrummond Rawnsley, of Lincolnshire, a connexion and intimate\r\nfriend of Lord Tennyson, whom I happened to meet some years\r\nsince at the house of a common friend, Professor Bonamy Price,\r\nat Oxford. Introduced to him by our host as a Canadian, I was\r\ninformed by him of a fact which he felt sure would interest all\r\nCanadians. The Poet Laureate, with whom he had lately been\r\nstaying, had told him that when the articles referred to had\r\nappeared in the _Times_, Lady Franklin, who was then a guest in\r\nhis house, and who felt the most intense interest in the future\r\nof Canada, had been filled with indignation at the wrong which\r\nthey did to English sentiment and to Canadian loyalty, and had\r\nstrongly urged upon him the duty and propriety of giving\r\nutterance to some sufficient protest. Being in the fullest\r\nsympathy with Lady Franklin's views, the poet acted upon this\r\nsuggestion and the lines were written. I do not think any\r\nprivate confidence is violated in mentioning the facts told to\r\nme on such unquestionable authority. It seems well that Canadian\r\npeople should know when reading these lines, that behind the\r\npoet's brain was the woman's heart, and that a lady whose name\r\nis held in highest honour wherever the English language is\r\nspoken, and wherever heroism and devotion touch the human heart,\r\nis thus connected by the subtle thread of sympathy and the\r\ngolden verse of our greatest poet with their own loved land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{31}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFEDERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE central internal fact, then, which must soon bring about a\r\ndecisive change in our system of national organization is the\r\nnecessity that British people in all parts of the Empire should\r\nhave, if they are to remain together and so far as circumstances\r\npermit, full and equal privileges of self-government and\r\ncitizenship. The political instinct which works in this\r\ndirection nothing can resist, for it has become innate in all\r\nthat is best in our race. The colonist who is permanently\r\ncontent with less has lost no small part of the spirit of his\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nThe central external fact which points to federation rather than\r\nseparation as the form which that change should take is the\r\nnecessity for joint defence of great common interests, and the\r\njoint management of international relations.\r\n\r\nIt may be fairly claimed that in accepting the federal idea\r\nAnglo-Saxon peoples have reached the crown of their political\r\nachievement, inasmuch as it offers a compromise between\r\nexcessively centralized systems of government, which gave\r\nstrength at the {32} expense of local freedom, and those other\r\nsystems which for the sake of local freedom sacrificed the\r\nstrength which was necessary for their own preservation. The\r\nliberty of the small Greek Republic was in some aspects a\r\nglorious thing contrasted with the despotisms around it, yet we\r\ncannot but remember that for want of power to combine that\r\nliberty was crushed beneath the heel of the foreigner.\r\nFederalism is the device by which organized democracy, without\r\ngiving up anything essential to liberty, is placed in a position\r\nto wrestle on even terms with organized despotism.\r\n\r\nAn Australian writer has lately defined very justly the true\r\nreason for the application of the Federal principle. 'It may be\r\nsaid,' he remarks, 'that federation becomes desirable where, on\r\nthe one hand, the country is too enormous in extent and too\r\ndiverse in conditions for its internal affairs to be\r\nsatisfactorily managed by one central government, while, on the\r\nother hand, the communities have certain common interests best\r\nserved by their coming together, or are confronted by common\r\ndangers if they keep apart.' Never in the history of the world\r\nwere these conditions more completely fulfilled than in the case\r\nof the British Empire. But objections to a federal organization\r\nfor the Empire are at once raised. 'The areas and communities to\r\nbe dealt with are too vast, the problem too complex, and the\r\nconsequent difficulty of giving an adequate organization too\r\ngreat for such a plan to be thought of.' To this it may be\r\nanswered {33} that the growth of the United States has widened\r\npolitical horizons. It has proved that immense territorial\r\nextent is not incompatible, under modern conditions, with that\r\nrepresentative system of popular government which had its birth\r\nand development in England, and its most notable adaptation in\r\nAmerica. It has shown that the spread of a nation over vast\r\nareas, including widely-separated states with diverse interests,\r\nneed not prevent it from becoming strongly bound together in a\r\npolitical organism which combines the advantages of national\r\ngreatness and unity of purpose with jealously guarded freedom of\r\nlocal self-government. So that if the birth of the American\r\nRepublic suggested the confident inference that the inevitable\r\ntendency of new communities was to detach themselves like ripe\r\nfruit from the parent stem, the circumstances of its growth have\r\ndone much to dissipate the idea. The United States have\r\nillustrated on a great scale the advantages of national unity;\r\ntheir example has pointed the way to its attainment. That\r\nexample has been followed in one great British community; it is\r\nbeing adopted in another.\r\n\r\nBut in the United States, in Canada, in Australia it is urged,\r\nwe have continental contiguity. The British Empire is too large,\r\nits parts, separated by oceans, are unfitted for government\r\nunder a common federal system. We can at least answer that the\r\nstandard of possible size for a nation has steadily enlarged in\r\nthe course of history. For a federal system the unit may be\r\nsmall or large, there seems {34} to be a measure by which to fix\r\nthe possible size of the unit in any case. The breadth of\r\ninterest is this measure. In a United British Empire each of the\r\nfederated countries, as commercial communities, would have\r\ninterests all over the world, and having such interests would\r\nhave a justification for being units in a world-wide Oceanic\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nFor great trading communities, moreover, we must remember that\r\noceans do not divide. The almost instantaneous transmission of\r\nthought, the cheap transmission of goods, the speedy travel\r\npossible for man, have revolutionised pre-existing conditions in\r\ncommerce and society, once more widening our horizon. The fact\r\nlies at the very basis of our national prosperity; it is\r\nrecognised in the every-day transactions of commercial life. Why\r\nshould it not be admitted among the ordinary considerations of\r\npolitical life as well?\r\n\r\nCommunities so remote from each other as those which compose the\r\nEmpire, it is said again, 'cannot have those common interests\r\nwhich are necessary to give cohesion to a nation.' Let us\r\nconsider the point.\r\n\r\nI go into a woollen mill in Yorkshire or the south of Scotland.\r\nIts proprietor, a great organizer of industry, shows me over the\r\nvast establishment, from the warehouse where the bales of wool\r\nare being packed as they arrive after their long voyage from the\r\nantipodes, through the washing, combing, spinning, weaving,\r\ndyeing, and pressing rooms till we come to the show rooms where\r\nthe completed goods are awaiting sale and shipment to the\r\nfurthest {35} corners of the world. He tells me that any\r\ncircumstance which checked the steady supply of the raw material\r\neven for a few weeks would leave all this extensive and\r\ncomplicated mass of machinery idle; would throw his employees,\r\nnumbered by thousands, out of employment; would bring himself\r\nface to face with ruin and his people with want. Any\r\ncircumstances which checked the steady shipment of the\r\nmanufactured goods to distant markets would produce consequences\r\nscarcely less immediate or less disastrous. I find the\r\nproprietor day by day anxiously watching the reports of the wool\r\nsales in London, and through them anything that affects the wool\r\ntrade in Sydney, Melbourne, or Dunedin. Clearly this man and\r\nthose who work for him must look far afield, if they consider\r\nall the conditions upon which their prosperity depends. They are\r\ntypes which represent many millions of people in the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nI go to Australia or New Zealand, and find myself the guest of a\r\nsquatter on his remote station. The sheep in his flocks number\r\nperhaps a hundred thousand. He shows me his station houses, his\r\nshearing sheds, his wool sheds, his vast paddocks enclosed with\r\nhundreds of miles of wire fencing, all his extensive plant, his\r\nhorses, his shepherds, his band of shearers. He has to fight\r\nagainst drought; swarms of rabbits may threaten him with ruin;\r\nhis year's clip of wool may, as the result of past disasters, be\r\nmortgaged to the Banks. But if the telegraph tells him that wool\r\nis rising in the London market, that the {36} factories at Leeds\r\nand Halifax and Huddersfield are running at their utmost\r\ncapacity, that Yorkshire is prosperous, he is cheerful and faces\r\nhis difficulties with a hopeful mind. A good year's sales will\r\nrepay him for his risks and recoup him for the losses of the\r\npast. Cut this man off from access to the home markets for a few\r\nmonths, block the ports from which he ships his wool, or break\r\nthe line of his communication, and his industry is paralysed,\r\nhis workmen without pay; the bank which backs him and stakes\r\nmuch on the prosperity of him and his like may close its doors.\r\nHere manifestly is a man who, with his organized army of\r\nindustry, from the shepherd who tends the sheep to the lumper\r\nwho handles the bales at the docks, has interests which extend\r\nfurther than his immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI go on board one of the great liners which run between\r\nAustralia and England, and which may be taken to represent the\r\nthird great form of British industry. Down in her hold, forming\r\nthe chief part of her cargo, are several thousand bales of wool.\r\nWhen she returns the wool will be replaced by manufactured\r\ngoods. The profits of the company which owns and manages her\r\ndepend upon the prosperity of the great manufacturing\r\ncommunities at home and the great producing areas abroad; upon\r\nthe pressure of outward and homeward trade. Upon the absolute\r\nsafety from hostile attack of this vessel and her like in\r\npassing over many thousand miles of sea depends once more the\r\nindustrial security of the vast multitudes of human {37} beings\r\nfor whom and between whom she carries on exchange.\r\n\r\nCan community of interest and mutual dependence be more complete\r\nthan this? Of the man who produces the raw material, the man who\r\nworks it up, and the man who carries between them, can we say\r\nwhere the interest of the one begins and the other ends? Yet\r\nwhat has been said of one raw material of production and\r\nmanufacture may be said of a hundred. What has been said of wool\r\nmay be said of wheat, for artizans must be fed while they work,\r\nand more and more English people at home will have to depend on\r\nEnglish people abroad for their supplies of wheat. It may be\r\nsaid of meat, which every year, in increasing quantity, Canada,\r\nNew Zealand, and Australia send to the mother-land.\r\n\r\nNo limit can be put to the range of common interest between\r\ncommunities of which one devotes its industry chiefly to\r\nsupplying the raw material of commerce, the other to its\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nThis community of industrial interest is strengthened by a\r\nthousand influences which give community of thought in almost\r\nevery relation of life, and must be reckoned among the forces\r\nwhich make for cohesion.\r\n\r\nThe population which flows into the waste places of the colonies\r\ncomes chiefly from the motherland, not driven out by religious\r\npersecution or political tyranny, but impelled by the spirit of\r\nenterprize or in search of the larger breathing and working\r\nspace of new countries. In almost every case the emigrant {38}\r\nmakes a new bond of friendly connection. He leaves the old\r\nBritain without any feeling of bitterness, and often with\r\nfriendly aid; he finds a welcome as well as a home in the new\r\nBritain beyond the seas. There the links of connection multiply\r\nand strengthen. Cheaper ocean transport, cheaper postage,\r\ncheaper telegraph rates, are constantly making it easier for him\r\nto keep in touch with the old home. His daily or weekly paper\r\nhas its columns of English news, keeping him well informed about\r\nall that most closely concerns the nation's life. The best\r\nproducts of the best minds of the motherland furnish his chief\r\nintellectual food, and form the basis of his education. Cheaper\r\nand cheaper editions poured out by competitive publishers in the\r\ncentres of cheap production bring all the master minds who have\r\nspoken or written in the English tongue within easy reach even\r\non an Australian station or a Canadian prairie. The tick of the\r\ntelegraph keeps the financial and speculative interests of the\r\nwhole outlying Empire in almost instant touch with those at the\r\ncentre. The philanthropic and social movements which originate\r\nin the old lands or the new find an almost immediate reflection\r\nor response in the other. Pan-Anglican Synods, Oecumenical\r\nCouncils, and General Assemblies, together with the great\r\nMissionary and Bible Societies, keep in closest touch the\r\nreligious thought and activities of the British world. The\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science meets in\r\nMontreal, and finds itself as much at home there as in {39}\r\nLondon, Edinburgh, or Dublin. Competitions of skill in arms or\r\nin athletics add their manifold links of connection. It seems as\r\nif Pan-Britannic contests of the kind on a great scale might yet\r\nrevive the memories of the old Greek world. Already corps of\r\nriflemen or artillerymen meet in friendly competition year by\r\nyear at Wimbledon, Bisley, or Shoeburyness.\r\n\r\nThe young Australian or Canadian who begins to practice with the\r\ncricket-bat or oar is already in imagination measuring his skill\r\nand strength against the best that Great Britain can produce,\r\nnor has the cricketer or oarsman of the United Kingdom gained\r\nhis final place in the athletic world till he has tested his\r\npowers on Australian fields or Canadian waters. The eager\r\ninterest with which in either hemisphere the tour of a selected\r\nteam or the performance of a champion sculler is watched from\r\nday to day is a curious proof of the intimacy of thought made\r\npossible by existing means of communication.\r\n\r\nThe great labour conflicts of the past two or three years have\r\nfurnished striking examples of the vital sympathy which springs\r\nfrom nationality and close social and commercial connection.\r\nDuring the Australian strike of last year, day after day, by\r\nmessage and manifesto, each party to the contest strove to bring\r\nover public opinion in Great Britain to its side, while the\r\nfunds raised on the one side of the world today were on the\r\nmorrow giving support and encouragement to those they were\r\nintended to assist at the other. Once more there is the sense of\r\ncommon {40} and equal ownership of great national memories and\r\nnames. The people of the great colonies have never broken with\r\nnational traditions. They are able to enter without reserve into\r\nthat passionate affection with which Shakespeare and Milton,\r\nScott and Burns, loved their native land, even while pointing\r\nout her faults. The statue of a national hero, like Gordon,\r\nfinds its place as naturally on a square of Melbourne as on\r\nTrafalgar Square itself. Equally in place are the memorial\r\ntablet to an Australian statesman in the crypt of St. Paul's\r\nbeside the tombs of Nelson and Wellington, or the memorial\r\nservice at Westminster to a statesman of the Empire who did his\r\nwork in Canada.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whether it can be supposed that the great\r\ncolonies, widely separated as they are, will ever learn to think\r\nand act together politically; whether, for instance, Australians\r\ncan ever be expected to take interest in Canadian fishery\r\ndisputes, or Canadians sympathize in Australian excitement about\r\nNew Caledonia or New Guinea. 'Canada and Australia,' says Mr.\r\nFreeman, 'care a great deal for Great Britain; we may doubt\r\nwhether, apart from Great Britain, Canada and Australia care\r\nvery much for one another. There may be American States which\r\ncare yet less for one another; but in their case mere continuity\r\nproduces a crowd of interests and relations common to all. We\r\nmay doubt whether the confederation of States so distant as the\r\nexisting colonies of Great Britain, whether the bringing them\r\ninto closer relations with one another as well as with Great\r\nBritain, will at all {41} tend to the advance of a common\r\nnational unity among them[1].'\r\n\r\nThe question thus raised is an interesting one, not to be\r\ndismissed in a word. Some force is given to it by the wide\r\nseparation of the colonies from each other, and the lack of\r\nintercourse in the past. But anyone who watches colonial\r\nquestions closely sees that great changes are taking place. Till\r\na very few years ago Canada looked to Australia only eastward\r\nacross the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The Dominion has now\r\nbecome like Australia, a state upon the Pacific, with interests\r\nin that ocean which are sure to become very considerable. Lines\r\nof steamship, postal, and cable communication between the two\r\ncountries are already in contemplation. The safety of such\r\nroutes would of itself form a great common interest. Passing\r\nthrough the centre of the Pacific it would tend to create those\r\nnational interests which would increase British influence in\r\nthat ocean--an end very much in Australasian thought.\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic Canada is extending her trade relations with\r\nanother group of colonies, the West Indies. This trade promises\r\nto develop greatly in the future, for as one country is in the\r\ntemperate zone and the other in the tropics, each seems the\r\nnatural complement of the other in range of production. The\r\nopening of a Panama route would give the Australian colonies a\r\nprofound interest in the strength of the British position in the\r\nWest Indies.\r\n\r\n{42}\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, again, have a substantial interest in\r\nthe political fortunes of South Africa, since in that country is\r\nthe most vulnerable point of their most important trade route.\r\nIn the _Naval Annual_ for 1890 Lord Brassey estimates the\r\noutward-bound Australasian trade which passes the Cape at twenty\r\nmillions sterling per annum, and uses the statement to enforce\r\nhis views as to the national importance of making perfectly\r\nsecure our position at this great turning-point of the world's\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nBut I do not wish to lay undue stress upon these facts, which\r\nare only intended to be illustrations of the existence and\r\ngrowth of common interests between different groups of colonies.\r\nThey are suggestions of future possibilities rather than\r\npowerful factors in the present.\r\n\r\nIt is more pertinent to measure the strength of the forces which\r\nat the present time make effectively for national cohesion.\r\nNobody doubts that if today either Canada or Australia were\r\nattacked by any foreign power the whole might of Great Britain\r\nwould be put forth to protect them. As little doubt can there be\r\nthat if Britain were wantonly attacked and engaged in a struggle\r\nfor existence, each of these great colonies would be ready with\r\nsuch assistance as it could give. Race sentiment and national\r\nhonour, to say nothing of self-interest, would combine, as\r\nthings now stand, to make these results as certain as anything\r\ncan be in human affairs. The common {43} bond with the\r\nmother-land seems to me a guarantee of sufficient unity between\r\nthe colonies--not so close, not so instinctive, it is true as\r\nthe more direct tie, but still amply sufficient to give\r\neffective national cohesion. All the colonies are parts of the\r\nsame great body; all would alike suffer from the weakness of the\r\nwhole. All would gain indefinitely from united strength.\r\n\r\n'In their case,' to repeat what Mr. Freeman says of the United\r\nStates, 'mere continuity produces a crowd of interest and\r\nrelations common to all.' But if Mr. Freeman reflects that\r\nseventy-seven per cent. of Australia's trade, eighty per cent.\r\nof New Zealand's trade, eighty-five per cent. of South Africa's\r\ntrade, fifty per cent of Canada's trade, finds its way backward\r\nand forward over the vast oceans which separate these colonies\r\nfrom Britain, or from each other, he will be forced to admit\r\nthat mere distance of separation produces, if not a crowd of\r\ninterests and relations, at least a few interests and relations\r\ncommon to all which are practically predominant. No states of\r\nthe American Union have an interdependence of financial and\r\ncommercial relations proportionally so exclusive and complete as\r\nthose which exist between New Zealand, Australia, South Africa,\r\nor even Canada and Great Britain. 'It is hard to believe,' adds\r\nMr. Freeman, 'that states which are united only by a sentiment,\r\nwhich have so much, both political and physical, to keep them\r\nasunder, will be kept together by a sentiment only.' Mr. Freeman\r\nhas evidently not studied {44} the facts of colonial trade, or\r\nthe relations of English and colonial industry[2].\r\n\r\nAnother practical aspect of the question naturally appeals\r\nstrongly to many minds. We are the most strenuous working race\r\nof the world, and the problems of labour fill a large place in\r\nour thoughts of the present and the future. Not only to hold our\r\nown in the keen competition going on with the rest of the world\r\nin both manufacture and the production of raw material, but also\r\nto reach the higher ideal formed of the life possible for a\r\nworking man, we seek to make as light as may be the burdens\r\nwhich industry must necessarily bear. In all countries no small\r\nportion of these are such as are imposed by the needs of\r\nnational organization--burdens which no country has ever yet\r\nescaped, or ever will. In national unity we may have all the\r\nadvantages and resources of co-operation utilized to this end on\r\na vast scale; one diplomatic and consular service; one fleet\r\ninstead of several; ports and docks defended at the common\r\nexpense for the good of all. Under any well-considered scheme it\r\nis certain, so far as defence is concerned, that all parts of\r\nthe Empire would secure {45} a maximum of protection at a\r\nminimum of cost, and the same would hold good in regard to other\r\nforms of necessary national expense. A nation economizing\r\nexpenditure in these directions could enlarge it for objects\r\nwhich tended to the common good, and brought advantages within\r\nthe reach of the masses, cheap postage, cheap telegraphy, cheap\r\ntransit of every kind. Combinations undertaken for ends such as\r\nthese could have no savour of an aggressive Imperialism.\r\n\r\nTo provide for the safety of industry is not Jingoism. Richard\r\nCobden was not under a Jingo influence when he said that he\r\nwould willingly vote £100,000,000 for the Navy rather than see\r\nit unable to fulfil its task of giving security to British\r\ncommerce. His was rather the expression of strong English common\r\nsense, which faces facts and the actual conditions of life. Lord\r\nRosebery is not a Jingo when he suggests that British people can\r\nbest secure peace by 'preponderance.' The strength of a United\r\nEmpire would be no more than equal to the increasing tasks which\r\nare laid upon it. The fear that Federation with the strength\r\nwhich it gave would make British people the bullies of the world\r\nappears absurd. If we have powerful athletic sons we do not cut\r\ntheir muscles or reduce their physique lest they should use\r\ntheir splendid strength to injury of their neighbours; rather do\r\nwe train them to use it in noble ways--to be foremost in toil,\r\nto help the oppressed, to defend the defenceless, to be the\r\nstrong arbiter between contentious disputants. So with the\r\nnation. Doubtless vast {46} strength, without an adequate\r\ncontrolling moral force, has in it a temptation and a danger.\r\nBut surely the remedy lies in deepening the moral sense, not in\r\nlimiting or diminishing the material strength of the nation.\r\n\r\nTo the Christian, the moralist, the philanthropist, no\r\ninspiration could be greater than that which might well spring\r\nfrom observing the growing strength of the Empire, and from\r\nreflection that this immense energy might be turned in\r\ndirections which would make for the world's good. And strength\r\nbeyond all other nations British people must have if they are to\r\nface in its fulness the work they have to do. As the outcome of\r\nthat intense life which has specially characterized the last two\r\nhundred years they find themselves front to front with the whole\r\nworld on every great sphere of action or field of\r\nresponsibility. They have to face and boldly play their part in\r\nthe large and complex problems of European politics, when the\r\nmight of enormous armies stands ready to enforce the decisions\r\nof an alliance or the will of a despot. Commerce, extending to\r\nthe remotest islands or penetrating to the heart of uncivilized\r\ncontinents, makes almost co-extensive with the globe those\r\nordinary interests of British people which require protection.\r\nThree hundred millions of mankind, who do not share British\r\nblood, of various races and in various climes, acknowledge\r\nBritish sway, and look to it for guidance and protection; their\r\nhopes of civilization and social elevation depending {47} upon\r\nthe justice with which it is exercised, while anarchy awaits\r\nthem should that rule be removed. Through commerce and\r\nwidespread territories the nation is brought into constant\r\nintercourse and often into the most delicate relations with\r\nalmost every savage race on the globe, thus standing almost\r\nalone of European nations on that border-land where civilization\r\nconfronts barbarism, of all positions in which a nation can be\r\nplaced perhaps the one most weighted with responsibilities and\r\nmost pregnant with possibilities of good and evil. To this\r\nposition the world's history offers no parallel; beside it\r\nRome's range of influence sinks into comparative insignificance.\r\n\r\nBut to understand all that it means we must remember that along\r\nwith this mighty growth of power there has been a steady growth\r\nof a public conscience, which holds itself responsible not only\r\nfor national acts, but for national influence; which refuses to\r\nshut its eyes to abuse of power, but rather looks upon power as\r\na sacred trust, to be used for worthy ends. Therein lies the\r\njustification of our national greatness, and of the wish that it\r\nshould be maintained.\r\n\r\n    'We sailed wherever ship can sail,\r\n      We founded many a noble state;--\r\n    Pray God our greatness may not fail\r\n      Through craven fear of being great.'\r\n\r\nThis is the poet's thought and prayer. May it not rightly be the\r\nthought and prayer of every British citizen? We have assumed\r\nvast responsibilities in the {48} government of weak and alien\r\nraces, responsibilities which cannot now be thrown off without a\r\nloss of national honour, and without infinite harm to those\r\nunder our rule. A nation which has leaning upon it an Indian\r\npopulation of nearly 300,000,000 over and above the native races\r\nof Australasia, South Africa, and many minor regions, must\r\nrequire, if stability and equilibrium are to be maintained, an\r\nimmense weight of that trained, intelligent, and conscientious\r\ncitizenship which is the backbone of national strength. It needs\r\nto concentrate its moral as well as its political strength for\r\nthe work it has to do.\r\n\r\nIf we really have faith in our own social and Christian progress\r\nas a nation; if we believe that our race, on the whole, and in\r\nspite of many failures, can be trusted better than others, to\r\nuse power with moderation, self-restraint, and a deep sense of\r\nmoral responsibility; if we believe that the wide area of our\r\npossessions may be made a solid factor in the world's politics,\r\nwhich will always throw the weight of its influence on the side\r\nof a righteous peace, then it cannot be inconsistent with\r\ndevotion to all the highest interests of humanity to wish and\r\nstrive for a consolidation of British power. It is because I\r\nbelieve that in all the noblest and truest among British people\r\nthere is this strong faith in our national integrity, and in the\r\ngreatness of the moral work our race has yet to do, that I\r\nanticipate that the whole weight of Christian and philanthropic\r\nsentiment will ultimately be thrown on the side of national\r\nunity, as opening {49} up the widest possible career of\r\nusefulness for us in the future; inasmuch as it will give us the\r\nsecurity which is necessary for working out our great national\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe praises of the Federal system of the United States are much\r\ndwelt upon now that it has been justified by triumphing over the\r\ndifficulties and dangers of a century. It seems the natural and\r\neasy outgrowth of the circumstances in which the original\r\ncolonies found themselves at the close of the Revolution. The\r\nconditions under which it was created and exists are pointed out\r\nas ideally favourable for national unity on a federal\r\nbasis--contiguity, common interest, sentiment based on a common\r\nhistory, and other facts and considerations of a parallel kind.\r\n\r\nFar different from this did the task of framing the Federal\r\nConstitution seem to those who had it in hand. It has been\r\ndescribed by Mr. Bryce as 'a work which seemed repeatedly on the\r\npoint of breaking down, so great were the difficulties\r\nencountered from the divergent sentiments and interests of the\r\ndifferent parts of the country, as well as of the larger and\r\nsmaller states.' The same writer adds: 'The Convention had not\r\nonly to create _de novo_, on the most slender basis of\r\npre-existing institutions, a national government for a widely\r\nscattered people, but they had in doing so to respect the fears\r\nand jealousies and apparently irreconcileable interests of\r\nthirteen separate commonwealths, to all of whose governments it\r\nwas necessary to leave a sphere of {50} action wide enough to\r\nsatisfy a deep-rooted sentiment, yet not so wide as to imperil\r\nnational unity.'\r\n\r\nYet once more we read of difficulties curiously like those which\r\nare urged as making British unity impossible now. 'Their\r\ngeographical position made communication very difficult. The sea\r\nwas stormy in winter, the roads were bad, it took as long to\r\ntravel by land from Charleston to Boston as to cross the ocean\r\nto Europe, nor was the journey less dangerous. The wealth of\r\nsome states consisted in slaves; of others in shipping; while in\r\nothers there was a population of small farmers,\r\ncharacteristically attached to old habits. Manufactures had\r\nhardly begun to exist. The sentiment of local independence\r\nshowed itself in intense suspicion of any external authority;\r\nand most parts of the country were so thinly peopled that the\r\ninhabitants had lived practically without any government, and\r\nthought that in creating one they would be forging fetters for\r\nthemselves.'\r\n\r\nDifficulties, then, are no new thing in national organization.\r\nThey may be, as they have been, but the spur to the determined\r\nwill of nation or individual. They are to be measured by the\r\nresources at our disposal with which to confront them.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the difficulties involved in framing a Federal system\r\nwe must at the same time remember the long and peculiar training\r\nwhich our race has had in dealing with them. Acute minds have\r\nbeen turned upon the problem, systems have been framed and\r\nadopted by vast populations, and time has tested {51} the\r\nresults. The experience of the United States extends over more\r\nthan a century of strenuous national life and wonderful growth.\r\nIn the light of that experience, and to meet her own\r\nnecessities, Canada faced the question a quarter of a century\r\nago, and framed a system which works well and gives assurance of\r\npermanence. Encouraged by these examples, Australia is taking\r\nsteps to frame a similar union. Thus three great\r\nEnglish-speaking communities have had their thoughts fixed with\r\nanxious attention upon Federal problems. In forming or in\r\ncarrying on these three great English-speaking federations,\r\nfundamental principles have been so exhaustively studied and so\r\nthoroughly tested that the conditions that must control Federal\r\norganization may now be stated with a very considerable degree\r\nof accuracy. Germany, Switzerland, and Austro-Hungary all\r\nfurnish data which assist in making conclusions definite. An\r\nadoption of Federalism is therefore no longer a leap in the\r\ndark. The losses and gains which it involves can be weighed and\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\nWith such a range of history and experience to fall back upon it\r\nought to be possible for a practical self-governing people to\r\ndistinguish between the relations they wish to control through\r\nthe smaller machinery of local government, and those they are\r\ncontent to submit to the larger machinery of a central\r\ngovernment: to draw, in short, a true line of division between\r\nthose interests which are peculiar to each {52} member of the\r\nFederation and those which are common to all.\r\n\r\nIn this connection Professor Ransome has stated what seems to me\r\na striking and most suggestive view. He points out that the\r\ngeographical relations of the great divisions of the Empire lend\r\nthemselves naturally to Federal organization on a large scale. A\r\nprimary difficulty in all federations, as I have said, is to\r\ndraw a sufficiently defined line between those local questions\r\nin the settlement of which communities, and most of all\r\nAnglo-Saxon communities, will brook no interference from\r\noutsiders, and those other questions in which all have a common\r\ninterest, and are content to have only a proportionate voice.\r\nGreat Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa, have each\r\ninternal problems of their own to wrestle with, which each can\r\nsolve only for itself, and about which it would resist dictation\r\nor resent even advice from all or any of the others. Such are\r\nthe relations of French and English in Canada; of white and\r\ncoloured labour in Australia; of Boer and Englishman in South\r\nAfrica; of Irish Home Rulers and Unionists in the United\r\nKingdom. But the fact that Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and\r\nSouth Africa lie in different quarters of the globe at once\r\ndistinguishes broadly all questions of this kind, and diminishes\r\nthe probability of conflict. On the other hand the very distance\r\nof separation makes it impossible, except by united action, to\r\ndeal adequately with the vast interests common to all. To draw\r\nthe line of {53} distinction between things purely local and\r\nsuch as are general in status thus widely separated would be\r\nmuch easier than to do the same for the contiguous sovereign\r\nstates of the American Republic, or the contiguous provinces of\r\nCanada or Australia. The very diversity and peculiarity of local\r\ninterest simplify the task.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, also, that in forming a British Federal\r\nsystem we should be relieved from what was the most difficult\r\nproblem which presented itself to the framers of the American\r\nconstitution. It was necessary to create a head for the state,\r\nand a method was devised with elaborate caution for doing this\r\nin freedom from the storms of party passion. In actual working\r\nthat system has broken away from the original intention of its\r\nauthors, and more than once the quadrennial selection of a party\r\nhead to the American Republic has put a heavy strain upon the\r\nmachinery of national government.\r\n\r\nThe British nation, on the other hand, has a head which commands\r\nreasoned and personal allegiance in all parts of the Empire.\r\nUnder it the popular will reaches its end with less friction\r\nthan under any other method yet devised. The system has been\r\nproved capable of easy and satisfactory application to the wants\r\nof the colonies, even under a federal organization such as that\r\nof Canada. The possession of such a starting-point will prove of\r\nenormous practical advantage in facing the problems of national\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n{54}\r\n\r\nThe fact that the constituent elements of the proposed\r\nfederation are not at the same stage of political development\r\nnaturally occurs as a difficulty. Canada, in having a fully\r\nmatured internal system, is riper for federation than Australia,\r\nAustralia than South Africa, South Africa than the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance is often urged as a conclusive argument for\r\ndelay: it is sometimes represented as an insuperable obstacle to\r\nany present progress towards closer unity. The condition is no\r\nnew one to existing federal systems, nor has it proved an\r\nobstacle of importance to the framing of an adequate\r\nconstitution. Both the United States and Canada have a carefully\r\narranged system by which their younger communities are admitted\r\nby successive stages into fuller privileges of citizenship, each\r\nas it reaches a fixed period of maturity becoming entitled to\r\nthe full franchise of state or province. As well argue that a\r\nman must not admit his eldest son into partnership until the\r\nyoungest has come of age, as claim that Canada, with its\r\nconstitution already consolidated by a quarter of a century's\r\nhistory, must still wait another quarter or half century for its\r\nrightful position in the nation to which it belongs because the\r\nWest Indies and South Africa have not been able to work their\r\nway through certain stages of political evolution. Strange,\r\nindeed, would have been the political position of the United\r\nStates had they waited to frame their federal system till\r\nColorado was on a level with Massachusetts. For a nation {55}\r\nlike ours, constantly expanding, and with possibilities for\r\nfurther extension even greater than the United States, common\r\nsense would seem to indicate the maturity of the first great\r\ncolonies, the period when they might fairly be expected to\r\ndesire some final decision about their national destiny, as the\r\ntime when the basis of a Federal system, applicable on a fixed\r\nprinciple to all, should be determined. They are then free, as\r\neach advances to maturity, to choose between independence and\r\nentrance into the national system.\r\n\r\nThe concession of Responsible Government to the colonies was an\r\nimportant, but by no means a final step in political\r\ndevelopment. From some points of view the change seemed to\r\nsuperficial observers very closely akin to the concession of\r\nindependence. It gave the absolute control of local affairs, the\r\npower of levying taxes, and of applying the proceeds; but the\r\nhigher functions of government, it must be remembered, still\r\nremained with the central power. Not only was this so, but the\r\nresponsibilities of independence were clearly not imposed in the\r\nsame proportion that its privileges were granted.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of some colonists and more Englishmen I have found\r\na belief, or rather a suspicion, that any closer union than at\r\npresent exists could only be effected by taking away from the\r\ncolonies some of the self-governing powers which they now\r\npossess. That this is necessary is clearly a mistake, and one\r\nwhich probably arises from the erroneous impression about {56}\r\nthe degree of self-government which a colony enjoys. Not the\r\nresignation of old powers, but the assumption of new ones, must\r\nbe the result of Federal union. A colony has now no power of\r\nmaking peace or war; no voice, save by the courtesy of the\r\nmother-country, in making treaties; no direct influence on the\r\nexercise of national diplomacy. Admitted to an organic union,\r\nits voice would be heard and its influence felt in the decision\r\nof these questions. To the Imperial Parliament, that is, as\r\nthings now stand, to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, is\r\nreserved the right to override the legislation of a colony, just\r\nas, for example, the Parliament of the Dominion has the right to\r\noverride the legislation of a Canadian Province. But as the\r\nCanadian feels in this no sense of injustice or tyranny, since\r\nhe is represented in the superior as well as in the inferior\r\nLegislature, so the colonist would feel no loss of political\r\ndignity if he had his true place in the higher as well as in the\r\nlower representative body. With enlarged powers, it is true, the\r\ncolony would have to accept enlarged responsibilities. In human\r\naffairs the two invariably and rightly go together[3]. If,\r\ninstead {57} of federation, a colony chose independence, it\r\nwould evidently be compelled at once to assume the control of\r\nall questions now reserved for Imperial treatment, and the\r\ncorresponding burdens now provided for at Imperial expense. In a\r\ncloser union the larger control and the larger responsibility\r\nwould be assumed in partnership rather than individually. Surely\r\nthis is not subtracting anything from the power of\r\nself-government. It is the means of making it complete.\r\n\r\nShall it, then, be separation or closer union? Shall we face the\r\ndangers which few can deny will be incident to the\r\ndisintegration even by Act of Parliament and mutual consent of\r\nthe greatest nation of the world; or shall we choose, as a wiser\r\nalternative, to confront, as in the past, the difficulties of\r\nsuch political reconstruction or adaptation as is required to\r\nmeet new national needs? This is the question which not merely\r\nmay arise, but certainly must arise within a very measurable\r\ntime to be settled by British people in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that all great movements which affect the\r\ncondition of peoples are originated and carried forward by the\r\ncombination of two forces: the force of conviction, which comes\r\nfrom reason, and the force of enthusiasm, which is born of\r\nsentiment. It is generally supposed that Anglo-Saxon people are\r\nmost strongly influenced by reason, by arguments directed to\r\ntheir intelligence. Yet it may be doubted if in any race,\r\nsentiment plays a more decisive part in {58} moulding public\r\naction. It lives in the pages of Milton, Shakespeare, Scott,\r\nBurns, Tennyson, and in distant lands loses none of its power to\r\nstir men's hearts. It has profoundly influenced Canadian history\r\nfor more than a hundred years. It flames up in every colony when\r\na crisis arises when British honour is at stake.\r\n\r\nMillions of people in distant parts of the world glory in the\r\nright to speak of England, Scotland, or Ireland under the tender\r\nname of home. A sentiment indeed, but a mighty power. It is true\r\nthat the term 'loyalty,' as it has usually been applied to\r\nBritish colonies and colonists in their relations to the United\r\nKingdom, is in some ways becoming an obsolete and unmeaning\r\nterm. A larger loyalty which has in it no suspicion of\r\ndependence is taking its place. It is one which implies\r\nfaithfulness to the great nationality to which we belong, its\r\nheart, indeed, and its greatest traditions in Britain, but its\r\nmighty limbs and no small share of its hopes for the future on\r\nthe world's circumference. It is at the bar of this loyalty that\r\nthe Briton at home as well as the Briton abroad must be judged.\r\nThe sentiment on which it partly rests is one we need not fear\r\nto count upon, and it has its limits only with the British\r\nworld. It has been proof against the defects of an illogical\r\nsystem: it will prove the main element of cohesion in a true\r\nsystem. But we need not fear to turn away entirely from\r\nsentiment to study the dry facts of material interest which each\r\nof the greater communities of the Empire has in National Unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Britannic Confederation_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n[2] Since the above was written we have been called upon to\r\nlament the great loss which English literature has suffered in\r\nMr. Freeman's death. I cannot but think that the critical\r\nattitude which he took towards British unity is explained by a\r\nremark which I have lately found in his _Impressions of the\r\nUnited States_. He says, 'Greatly to my ill-luck, I am wholly\r\nignorant of all things bearing on commerce, manufactures, or\r\nagriculture.' Are not these the questions which really dominate\r\nBritish national development?\r\n\r\n[3] 'No community which is not primarily charged with the\r\nordinary business of its own maintenance and defence is really,\r\nor can be, in the full sense of the word, a free community. The\r\nprivileges of freedom and the burdens of freedom are absolutely\r\nassociated together. To bear the burden is as necessary as to\r\nenjoy the privilege, in order to form that character which is\r\nthe great necessity of freedom itself.'--Mr. Gladstone before\r\nthe Colonial Committee, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{59}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDEFENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN beginning his elaborate study of the Empire and its capacity\r\nfor defence, the author of 'The Problems of Greater Britain'\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n'The danger in our path is that the enormous forces of European\r\nmilitarism may crush the old country and destroy the integrity\r\nof our Empire before the growth of the newer communities that it\r\ncontains has made it too strong for the attack.' In closing he\r\nsays: 'The result of this survey of Imperial Defence is to bring\r\nbefore the mind a clearer image of the stupendous potential\r\nstrength of the British Empire, and of an equally stupendous\r\ncarelessness in organizing its forces. ... Our ambition is not\r\nfor offensive strength, and not only home-staying Britons, but\r\nour more energetic colonists themselves, decline to accept such\r\norganization of our power, with the temptations that it would\r\nbring. We wish only to be safe from the ambition of others, and\r\nthe first step towards safety must be the arrangement of\r\nconsistent plans for supporting the whole edifice of British\r\nrule by the assistance of all the component parts of the Empire.\r\nAs all have helped to raise the fabric, so may all combine {60}\r\nto secure it by the adoption of a settled plan of Imperial\r\nDefence.'\r\n\r\nThe defence of common interests has been, in the past, the\r\nprimary bond which has held federations together. It must be put\r\nin the very forefront among the arguments for British unity.\r\nTaken by itself it seems to furnish more than sufficient reason\r\nwhy Great Britain and her colonies should present a united\r\npolitical front to the world.\r\n\r\nCommon interests so vast no nation or union of nations has ever\r\nbefore had in the history of the world. The foundations of\r\nBritish greatness rest in the creative power of industry, and\r\nthat interaction of industry or exchange of products which we\r\ncall commerce. Industry and commerce have combined to make our\r\nnation the richest in the world. We are a race of workers and of\r\ntraders. It is in virtue of our working and trading instincts\r\nthat we hold today the foremost place among the nations of the\r\nworld. In following them we have won Empire; it seems capable of\r\nproof that to satisfy their necessities we must maintain Empire,\r\nfor what we have been in the past such we are manifestly to be\r\non a much larger scale in the future.\r\n\r\nTransferred to Canada, or Australia, New Zealand, the Cape, or\r\nto foreign lands, the Briton is still the eager worker and\r\ntrader, and the field for the exercise of his qualities is ever\r\nenlarging. As the standard of living rises with increasing\r\nprosperity, as the comforts and luxuries of distant lands come\r\nwithin reach of even {61} the labouring man, commerce is\r\nstimulated anew; its safety becomes of greater concern. In the\r\nstrength of the British flag to give security to the infinite\r\narmy of workers who carry on their toil under its protection, is\r\ninvolved the welfare and prosperity of the greatest aggregation\r\nof human beings that ever was joined together in one body\r\npolitic.\r\n\r\nIt is when we consider the extent of British commerce, of what\r\nthe nation constantly has staked upon the security of ocean\r\ntrade, that we realize the vastness and importance of the\r\nproblems involved in national defence, the supreme necessity\r\nthat British people should be in a position either to command\r\npeace, or to face with confidence, so far as trade is concerned,\r\nthe risks of any war that may be forced upon them.\r\n\r\nTo most minds figures perhaps convey but an inadequate idea of\r\nwhat they represent, but it is only by figures that the extent\r\nof the stake which British people have upon the ocean can be\r\nindicated. The rapidity of expansion is as striking as the\r\nactual extent, and they may usefully be put together. In 1837,\r\nwhen the Queen ascended the throne, the annual value of the\r\nsea-commerce of the United Kingdom, together with that of the\r\ncolonies and dependencies, was estimated at £210,000,000. That\r\ncommerce has now, in a little more than fifty years, expanded to\r\nnearly £1200,000,000. Every year British people have afloat upon\r\nthe ocean wealth represented by this enormous sum. Nothing like\r\nit has ever been {62} known in the history of any nation before.\r\nThe marvellous expansion still goes on. In the case of the\r\ncolonies and dependencies, with their unlimited possibilities of\r\ndevelopment, it is manifest that we see but the beginning of\r\ntheir commercial career. For them, as for the mother-islands,\r\nthe safety of trade, the security of the ocean waterways, must\r\nin the interests of industry be the supreme object of\r\nstatesmanship. And I believe that there is a well-nigh\r\nunanswerable line of argument which goes to prove that\r\nstatesmanship will find that security most certainly and most\r\neffectually by maintaining intact the actual unity of the Empire\r\nthrough such further political consolidation of its various\r\nparts as will make united action possible and most effective. On\r\nthe other hand, there are the strongest reasons for thinking\r\nthat the separation of even one of the great colonies might\r\nproduce for the colony itself, for the United Kingdom, and for\r\nthe Empire at large, a fatal flaw in the capacity for defending\r\ninterests which are vital to the general prosperity and to the\r\ngreatness of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe outline of this argument may be shortly stated.\r\n\r\nThe vast magnitude of the Empire, and its dispersion in the\r\nvarious quarters of the globe, have hitherto oppressed the\r\nimagination of those charged with its defence. Vulnerability has\r\nseemed the natural concomitant of magnitude. The impression\r\nmight have been correct fifty or seventy-five years ago; it is\r\nnot so today. It seems a proposition fairly capable of\r\ndemonstration that under the changed conditions of {63} modern\r\ncommunication and naval war the vast area of the Empire and the\r\nwide dispersion of its parts, so far from being a cause of\r\nweakness, are really elements, under proper organization, of a\r\nstrength greater than any nation of present or past times has\r\never enjoyed. It is a strength, too, which particularly\r\nrecommends itself to the national mind, since it is effective\r\nfor defence rather than aggression.\r\n\r\nTo understand how magnitude and diffusion may be sources of\r\nstrength we must recall the fact that for all purposes of trade,\r\nintercourse, and naval power, the introduction of steam has\r\nre-created the world. Before Trafalgar was fought Nelson was\r\nable to keep the sea for months, the staying power of a ship of\r\nwar depending almost entirely upon its supplies of food, water,\r\nand warlike stores. Now it has become chiefly a question of coal\r\nendurance. Removed from the means of renewing its supplies of\r\ncoal, the most powerful ship afloat within a very limited number\r\nof days becomes a helpless hulk.\r\n\r\n'The striking distance of a ship of war is now on an average two\r\nthousand miles,' are the words used by Lord Salisbury not long\r\nsince to indicate the nature and extent of this change in the\r\nconditions of naval defence. What he means is, we may suppose,\r\nthat when a modern ship of war has filled her bunkers with coal,\r\nshe can go two thousand miles, do the work assigned her, and get\r\nsafely back to her starting-place. High naval authorities have\r\ntold me that Lord Salisbury's average is fixed at the outside\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n{64}\r\n\r\n'Our fleet must be present in sufficient force to protect\r\nadequately the whole commerce of the Empire, wherever it is,'\r\nsays the Secretary of the Admiralty in a last year's speech, and\r\nthe press almost unanimously unites with Chambers of Commerce\r\nand other representative bodies in echoing the sentiment as a\r\nnational resolution.\r\n\r\nIn discussing a considerable event in naval construction in the\r\nbeginning of the present year the _Times_ said: 'So far as human\r\neffort can attain its end, the country has now definitely\r\nresolved that the naval history of the future shall not be\r\nunworthy of its past.' It added: 'There is no finality to naval\r\npolicy. ... Its only sound basis is not the cost of the fleet in\r\nthe abstract, but a rational estimate of the conditions of naval\r\ndefence at sea.'\r\n\r\nBut the world is 25,000 miles round, and the commerce of the\r\nEmpire is upon every sea. The striking distance of a ship of war\r\nis 2000 miles, and practically every ship of war we have\r\noperates under the limitations imposed by the use of steam. The\r\nfigures certainly give us the necessary data for calculating\r\nwhat naval bases are necessary for adequate naval strength.\r\n\r\nSurely Canada, resting on the North Atlantic and North Pacific;\r\nSouth Africa, commanding the passage around the Cape; and\r\nAustralasia, in the centre of the vast breadth of the Indian and\r\nPacific Oceans, are not merely useful, but, under the conditions\r\nwhich have been stated, essential. But when we have realized\r\n{65} that under modern conditions they are essential to widely\r\nextended sea power, we are in a position to understand the\r\naddition which they make to defensive strength. A nation which\r\ncommands the great naval and coaling stations at these essential\r\npoints could practically paralyze any enemy which sought to\r\nattack her, by simply closing the ports of coal supply to\r\nhostile ships.\r\n\r\nLet me ask the reader to turn to the map of the world which\r\naccompanies this book. In it an attempt has been made to\r\nemphasize, though not unduly, a few of the main facts connected\r\nwith our national position. The chief routes of British commerce\r\nare indicated--the arteries along which flow the life-blood of\r\nthe nation. On what is now the principal route to the East, that\r\nthrough the Mediterranean and Red Seas, we note the fortified\r\nnaval and coaling stations in a connected chain: Gibraltar,\r\nMalta, Bombay, Trincomalee, Singapore, and Hong Kong. At each of\r\nthese stations British ships find themselves under the shelter\r\nof strong fortifications. Most of them are practically\r\nimpregnable, and are supplied with docks for the repair of\r\nships. All are points of storage for coal. Besides these\r\nstations of primary importance there are subsidiary ports,\r\nKurrachi, Colombo, Calcutta, and many others.\r\n\r\nWhether this remarkable hold on the greatest route of Eastern\r\ncommerce is the outcome of a grasping militarism, or the natural\r\nresult which arises from supreme commercial interest, may be\r\njudged from a {66} single fact. Of the 3800 steamships which\r\npassed through the Canal in 1891 seventy-eight out of every\r\nhundred were under the British flag, leaving only twenty-two\r\ndivided among Frenchmen, Germans, Dutchmen, Austrians,\r\nSpaniards, Americans, and all the other nations of the world. Of\r\nthe whole tonnage eighty-two per cent. was British.\r\n\r\nFollow, again, the alternative route to the East and South\r\naround Africa. Here we find Sierra Leone, St. Helena, Cape Town,\r\nand Mauritius at intervals singularly adapted to the necessities\r\nof steam navigation under conditions of either peace or war.\r\nOther nations occupy parts of Africa, but none have naval\r\nstations of corresponding strength.\r\n\r\nTerminating these two great Eastern routes we have in\r\nAustralasia King George's Sound, Thursday Island, Melbourne,\r\nSydney, and Auckland, which may be regarded as positions of\r\nprimary naval importance. Some of these are already fortified,\r\nothers have their defensive works in progress. Secondary, and\r\nyet important, are Hobart, Adelaide, Brisbane, Wellington,\r\nLyttleton, Dunedin, and other ports.\r\n\r\nWestward across the Atlantic, Halifax, Bermuda, St. Lucia, and\r\nJamaica furnish adequate naval bases for the protection of the\r\nvast British commerce which traverses this ocean. The harbours\r\nof the Gulf and River St. Lawrence and Newfoundland, and of\r\nseveral West India islands, supplement these strongly fortified\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific Coast Esquimalt and Vancouver {67} furnish\r\nstations from which may be protected the new route of trade and\r\ntravel opened to the far East, and the projected route to\r\nAustralasia.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Falkland Islands, to which it has now been decided\r\nto give adequate fortifications, furnish a coaling place for\r\nships in times of urgent necessity, and a point from which trade\r\ncan be defended in the long voyage between Britain and Australia\r\nby the Cape Horn route. They also serve as a base of protection\r\nfor our large trade with the Western coast of South America.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the map illustrates another group of facts\r\nwhich we must consider before we can fully grasp the relation of\r\nthis geographical distribution of the Empire to naval power in\r\nan age of steam. On the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Canada,\r\nin New Zealand, Tasmania, New South Wales, and Queensland, in\r\nIndia, Borneo, and South Africa, coal is noted as among the\r\nproducts of these countries, and in them all, there are, in\r\nfact, great coal deposits forming in each corner of the globe, a\r\nwonderful complement to those of the mother-land.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the outline of a maritime position such as no\r\npeople ever enjoyed before. North and South, East and West, we\r\nbold the great quadrilateral of oceanic power. It is not an\r\nundue strength of position, for it has to match the greatest\r\ncommercial expansion that history has known. The security of\r\neach part of the system seems essential to the security {68} of\r\nthe whole, and therefore should be guaranteed by the united\r\nstrength of all. And it is clear that under modern steaming\r\nconditions it is this very diffusion of the Empire over every\r\npart of the world which constitutes its greatest advantage for\r\ngiving safety to a world-wide commerce.\r\n\r\nThe conditions, however, under which this maritime position is\r\nmaintained, and the vast and growing commerce of the Empire now\r\nenjoys security present some anomalies which cannot possibly\r\nhave in them conditions of permanency.\r\n\r\nLet me summarize the facts as placed before the House of Commons\r\n(March 2nd, 1891), by Sir John Colomb. The annual value of the\r\nsea-borne commerce of the United Kingdom is, roughly speaking,\r\nabout £740,000,000; of the colonies and dependencies\r\n£460,000,000. As the latter has increased ninefold and the\r\nformer but fivefold in a little more than fifty years, it is\r\nclear that at no very distant time the sea-borne commerce of the\r\noutlying empire will become equal to and gradually surpass in\r\nvalue that of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the whole colonial trade which consists of\r\ninterchange with the United Kingdom, and in the safety of which\r\npresumably the United Kingdom has a close and direct interest,\r\nis £187,000,000. This leaves £273,000,000 of independent trade\r\ncarried on with foreign countries, or between the colonies and\r\ndependencies themselves. Compared with the sea-borne trade of\r\ngreat foreign powers which support {69} large war navies, Sir\r\nJohn Colomb finds this independent trade to be 'about four times\r\nas much as the whole sea-borne trade of all Russia; about equal\r\nto that of Germany; about three-quarters that of France; two and\r\na-half times that of Italy; and nearly half that of the United\r\nStates.' The whole of this vast and rapidly increasing\r\nindependent trade has precisely the same guarantee of protection\r\nfrom the naval power of the Empire as the trade of the United\r\nKingdom itself. Yet, while the net expenditure (1890) incurred\r\nby the United Kingdom in the Naval Estimates is £14,215,100, the\r\nwhole contribution of the colonies and dependencies for the same\r\npurpose only amounts to £381,546, of which India alone provides\r\n£254,776. In other words, out of every pound spent for the\r\nprotection of the nation's commerce at sea, the United Kingdom\r\ncontributes 19s. 53/4d., the outlying empire 6 1/4d. This\r\ncomparison is made even more striking when combined with the\r\nstatement that the united revenues of the colonies and\r\ndependencies amount to £105,000,000, against the £89,000,000\r\nwhich represent the revenue of the United Kingdom. The vast\r\ncapital sum invested in ships, armament, and naval\r\nestablishments, believed to amount to more than £80,000,000, is\r\npaid wholly by the taxpayers of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nBesides the protection to their commerce given by the Navy,\r\ncolonists enjoy as fully as British people themselves the use\r\nand advantage of the consular and diplomatic services of the\r\nEmpire. The colonial merchant, {70} sailor, or shipmaster finds\r\nin every chief port of the world a consul to whom he can apply\r\nfor protection--an officer whose services are paid for by the\r\nBritish taxpayer alone. The Imperial treasury maintains unaided\r\nthe costly diplomatic staff which carries on the long and\r\ndelicate negotiations in which the colonies are often more\r\ndirectly concerned than the mother-land itself. If the results\r\nof diplomacy sometimes fail to satisfy colonial expectations,\r\nthe experience is not new among nations, nor likely to be\r\navoided by the agencies which a colony could independently set\r\nin motion. When the execution of treaties involves loss to the\r\nindividual colonist, the example of Newfoundland and the Behring\r\nSea indicates that it is to the Imperial treasury that he\r\nchiefly looks for compensation.\r\n\r\nThis want of proportion in the distribution of national burdens\r\nis so striking that one is impelled to ask if it may not have at\r\nleast some partial or temporary justification. There is one\r\nconsideration of much weight. The settlers in the outlying\r\nsections of the Empire have been compelled in their short\r\nhistory to face tasks of great difficulty. They have had upon\r\ntheir hands the organization of vast continental areas, the\r\nclearing of forests, the construction of highways and railroads,\r\nthe extension of the post and telegraph over immense distances,\r\nthe speedy application of the machinery of civilization to new\r\nlands. Were it quite certain that all this would become a\r\npermanent addition to the strength and resources of the nation,\r\nit {71} might well be an object of national policy to relieve\r\nthem from other burdens, however fair in themselves. There\r\nwould, on the other hand, be no justification for this if they\r\nare in the end to become independent powers or additions to the\r\nstrength of another state.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the moment that the ordinary taxpayer of the new\r\nland is as able to pay as the ordinary taxpayer of the old, the\r\nuneven distribution of responsibility becomes a gross injustice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it ought to be possible to roughly define even now\r\nsome of the general principles which should be attended to in\r\ndistributing this responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in having the clearly stated opinion of one\r\ngreat colonial thinker upon this point. Joseph Howe is\r\nremembered in England, no less than in Canada, as one of the\r\nablest statesmen that the colonies have produced. 'The great\r\norator and patriot,' is the description applied to him by Mr.\r\nGoldwin Smith. As the brilliant and triumphant champion of\r\nResponsible Government his record places him absolutely beyond\r\nthe suspicion of subordinating colonial interests to any others.\r\nYet from the very outset he looked upon the attainment of\r\ncomplete independence of local government in the colonies as but\r\na stepping-stone to the assertion of still higher national\r\nrights, to the acceptance of still higher responsibilities; to\r\nsome form of substantial union among British people, based on\r\nconsiderations of equal citizenship and the defence of common\r\ninterests. As far back as 1854 he delivered in the Nova Scotia\r\nLegislature an {72} address, since published in his collected\r\nspeeches under the name of the 'Organization of the Empire,'\r\nwhich attracted wide attention at the time, and, indeed,\r\nembodies most of what has since been said by the advocates of\r\nnational unity. Twelve years later, when on a visit to England,\r\nhe published in pamphlet form an essay bearing the same title,\r\nand giving his more fully matured views upon the question. If\r\nthe genesis and enunciation of the Imperial Federation idea in\r\nits modern form is to be credited to anyone, it must be assigned\r\nto Joseph Howe for this early and comprehensive statement of the\r\nmain issues involved. The study of the utterances of this great\r\ncolonist, this champion of colonial rights, may be commended to\r\nthose shallow critics who profess to believe that the proposal\r\nfor national unity is an outcome of Imperial selfishness, and\r\nthat its operation would tend to cramp colonial development.\r\n\r\nMr. Howe had none of the illusions which prevail in some parts\r\nof the colonies about the possibility of enjoying peace without\r\ntaking the steps necessary to secure it: 'We have no security\r\nfor peace,' he says, 'or if there be any, it is only to be\r\nsought in such an organization and armament of the whole Empire\r\nas will make the certainty of defeat a foregone conclusion to\r\nany foreign power that may attempt to break it.' And again, 'The\r\nquestion of questions for us all, far transcending in importance\r\nany other within the range of domestic or foreign politics, is\r\nnot how the Empire can be most easily dismembered, not how a\r\nprovince {73} or two can be strengthened by a fort, or by the\r\nexpenditure of a million of dollars, but how the whole Empire\r\ncan be so organized and strengthened as to command peace or be\r\nimpregnable in war.'\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the best method of securing the representation\r\nof colonial ideas in influencing the general policy of the\r\ncountry, a condition which he believes necessarily precedent to\r\njoint expenditure, Mr. Howe then boldly grapples with the\r\nquestion of provision for defence.\r\n\r\n'By another bill, to operate uniformly over the whole Empire\r\n(India being excepted, as she provides for her own army) the\r\nfunds should be raised for the national defence. This measure,\r\nlike the other, should be submitted for the sanction of the\r\ncolonial governments and legislatures. This tax should be\r\ndistinguished from all other imposts, that the amount collected\r\ncould be seen at a glance, and that every portion of the whole\r\npeople might see what they paid and what every other portion had\r\nto pay.\r\n\r\n'This fund could either be raised as head money over the whole\r\npopulation, in the form of a property or income tax, or [as Mr.\r\nHowe preferred] by a certain percentage upon imports;\r\nconstituting, next to existing liabilities, a first charge upon\r\ncolonial revenues, and being paid into the military chest to the\r\ncredit of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.'\r\n\r\nTwo important qualifications Mr. Howe suggests as to the\r\nincidence of this national taxation upon the colonies.\r\n\r\n{74}\r\n\r\n'As the great arsenals, dockyards, depots, and elaborate\r\nfortifications are in these islands; as the bulk of the naval\r\nand military expenditure for arms, munitions, and provisions\r\noccurs here, where are the great fleets and camps, the people of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland ought to be prepared to pay, and I\r\nhave no doubt would, a much larger proportion towards this fund\r\nthan it would be fair to exact from the outlying provinces,\r\nwhere, in time of peace, there is but little of naval or\r\nmilitary expenditure.\r\n\r\n'In another respect a wise discrimination should be exercised.\r\nWithin the British Islands are stored up the fruits of eighteen\r\ncenturies of profitable industry. All that generations of men\r\ntoiled for, and have bequeathed, is now in possession of the\r\nresident population here, including all that was created and\r\nleft by the forefathers of those by whom the British colonies\r\nhave been founded. Taking into view, then, the comparison which\r\nthese wealthy and densely peopled islands bear to the sparsely\r\npopulated countries beyond the sea, it would seem but fair that\r\nthey should assume, in proportion to numbers, a much larger\r\nshare of the burthens of national defence.'\r\n\r\nHe then sums up: 'If the general principle be admitted, we need\r\nnot waste time with the details, which actuaries and accountants\r\ncan adjust. Fair allowance being made under these two heads, I\r\ncan see no reason why the colonists should not contribute in\r\npeace and war their fair quotas towards the defence of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\n'But the question may now be asked, and everything turns upon\r\nthe answer that may be given to it, will the colonies consent to\r\npay this tax, or to make any provision at all for the defence of\r\nthe Empire? It must be apparent that no individual can give an\r\nanswer to this question; that the Cabinet, were they to propound\r\nthis policy, even after the most anxious enquiry and full\r\ndeliberation, could only wait in hope and confidence for the\r\nresponse to be given by so many communities, so widely dispersed\r\nand affected by so many currents of thought. ... That it is the\r\nduty, and would be for the interest, of all Her Majesty's\r\nsubjects in the outlying provinces, fairly admitted to the\r\nenjoyment of the privileges indicated, to make this\r\ncontribution, I have not the shadow of doubt. ... Without\r\nefficient organization they cannot lean upon and strengthen each\r\nother or give to the mother-country that moral support which in\r\npeace makes diplomacy effective, and in war would make the\r\ncontest short, sharp, and decisive. ... If once organized and\r\nconsolidated, under a system mutually advantageous and generally\r\nknown, there would be an end to all jealousies between the\r\ntaxpayers at home and abroad. We should no longer be weakened by\r\ndiscussions about defence or propositions for dismemberment, and\r\nthe irritation now kept up by shallow thinkers and mischievous\r\npoliticians would give place to a general feeling of\r\nbrotherhood, of confidence, of mutual exertion, dependence, and\r\nsecurity. The great powers of Europe and America would at once\r\nrecognize {76} the wisdom and forethought out of which had\r\nsprung this national combination, and they would be slow to test\r\nits strength. We should secure peace on every side by the\r\nnotoriety given to the fact that on every side we were prepared\r\nfor war.'\r\n\r\nOne more quotation is necessary to place before the reader the\r\nfull breadth and courage of Mr. Howe's reasoning:--\r\n\r\n'But suppose this policy proposed and the appeal made, and that\r\nthe response is a determined negative. Even in that case it\r\nwould be wise to make it, because the public conscience of the\r\nmother-country would then be clear, and the hands of her\r\nstatesmen free, to deal with the whole question of national\r\ndefence in its broadest outlines or in its bearings on the case\r\nof any single province or group of provinces, which might then\r\nbe dealt with in a more independent manner.\r\n\r\n'But I will not for a moment do my fellow-colonists the\r\ninjustice to suspect that they will decline a fair compromise of\r\na question which involves at once their own protection and the\r\nconsolidation of the Empire. At all events, if there are any\r\ncommunities of British origin anywhere, who desire to enjoy all\r\nthe privileges and immunities of the Queen's subjects without\r\npaying for and defending them, let us ascertain who and what\r\nthey are--let us measure the proportions of political\r\nexpenditure now, in a season of tranquillity, when we have the\r\nleisure to gauge the extent of the evil and apply correctives,\r\nrather than wait till war finds us {77} unprepared and leaning\r\nupon presumptions in which there is no reality.'\r\n\r\nNo apology seems needed for placing before the reader at such\r\nlength the views held on this crucial question of national\r\ndefence by one of the great fathers of Responsible Government in\r\nthe colonies, a man whose whole life was marked by absolute\r\ndevotion to the principles of popular government and to colonial\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nJoseph Howe spoke and wrote of conditions existing before that\r\ngreat period of Canadian development and expenditure which\r\nfollowed upon the confederation of the different provinces. This\r\nprobably accounts in large measure for the different view of the\r\nsituation taken and the different solution of the question\r\nsuggested by his distinguished successor, Sir Charles Tupper.\r\nThe right and duty of the colonies to contribute to the general\r\nstrength of the Empire which guarantees them security is\r\nadmitted as fully by Sir Charles Tupper as by Joseph Howe. Of\r\nthe most expedient method for utilizing the young energy and\r\ngrowing resources of the colonies he takes a different view. In\r\nan article recently published in a leading magazine[1] he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n'Many persons, I am aware, both in the colonies and here, have\r\nlooked upon the question of the defence of the Empire as best\r\npromoted and secured by a direct contribution to the support of\r\nthe army and navy of this country. That I regard as a very {78}\r\nmistaken opinion; and I believe that there is a much more\r\neffective way of promoting the object in view. In my opinion, no\r\ncontribution to the support of the army and navy of England on\r\nthe part of Canada would have contributed to the defence of the\r\nEmpire in a greater degree than the mode in which the public\r\nmoney in Canada has been expended for that purpose. We have\r\nexpended, in addition to an enormous grant of land, over a\r\nmillion pounds sterling per annum, from the first hour that we\r\nbecame a united country down to the present day, in constructing\r\na great Imperial highway across Canada from ocean to ocean; not\r\nonly furnishing the means for the expansion of the trade and the\r\ndevelopment of Canada, but providing the means of\r\nintercommunication at all seasons between different parts of the\r\ncountry,'\r\n\r\nAfter pointing out that the construction of the Transcontinental\r\nRailway enabled Canada in 1885 to put down without England's\r\nhelp the half-breed rebellion, while the previous outbreak in\r\n1870 had required the services of General Wolseley and the\r\nImperial troops for several months, Sir Charles Tupper goes on\r\nto say:--\r\n\r\n'We have, therefore, not only provided the means of\r\nintercommunication, the means of carrying on our trade and\r\nbusiness, but have also established a great Imperial highway\r\nwhich England might to-morrow find almost essential for the\r\nmaintenance of her power in the East. Not only has Canada\r\nfurnished {79} a highway across the continent, but it has\r\nbrought Yokahama three weeks nearer to London than it is by the\r\nSuez Canal. I give that as an illustration that there are other\r\nmeans which, in my judgment, may contribute much more to the\r\nincreased strength and the greatness of the Empire than any\r\ncontribution that could be levied upon any of the colonies. ...\r\nThe expenditure by the Government of Canada that has\r\nsuccessfully opened up these enormous tracts of country in the\r\ngreat North West of the Dominion, which promise to be the\r\ngranary of the world, is of itself the best means of making\r\nEngland strong and prosperous, as it will attract a large\r\nBritish population thither.'\r\n\r\nSir Charles Tupper can also speak of more direct contributions\r\nwhich the Dominion makes to the national strength.\r\n\r\n'Canada has in addition expended since confederation over forty\r\nmillions of dollars upon her militia and mounted police, and in\r\nthe establishment of a military college, which, I am proud to\r\nknow from one of the highest authorities, is second to no\r\nmilitary school in the world, and of nine other military schools\r\nand batteries in the various provinces, of which the Dominion is\r\ncomposed. In 1889 Canada expended no less than two millions of\r\ndollars on the militia and North West mounted police, which\r\nanyone who knows the country will admit is a most effective\r\nmeans of defence. It is true we have a comparatively small\r\npermanent force, but {80} we have established military schools,\r\nand we have such a nucleus of a further force as in case of need\r\nwould enable us to develop the militia in the most effective\r\nmanner, consisting of 37,000 volunteers who are trained\r\nannually, and a reserve of 1,000,000 men, liable to be called\r\nupon should necessity arise.'\r\n\r\nOnce more: 'One of the most effective means adopted by the\r\nImperial Parliament for the defence of the Empire is by\r\nsubsidizing fast steamers built under Admiralty supervision,\r\nwith armament which can be made available at a moment's notice.\r\nThese steamers could maintain their position and keep up mail\r\ncommunication in time of war or be used for the transport of\r\ntroops. Canada has contributed £15,000 a year to a splendid line\r\nof steamers, such as I have described, now plying between\r\nCanada, Japan, and China, and has offered no less than £165,000\r\nper annum to put a service like the Teutonic between England and\r\nCanada, and a fast service between Canada and Australia. All\r\nthese splendid steamers would be effective as cruisers if\r\nrequired for the protection of British commerce, and the\r\ntransport of troops and thousands of volunteers to any point\r\nthat the protection of the Empire demanded.'\r\n\r\nIt is on grounds thus stated that Sir Charles Tupper concludes\r\nthat, 'Instead of adding to its defence, the strength of a\r\ncolony would be impaired by taking away the means which it\r\nrequires for its development and for increasing its defensive\r\npower, {81} if it were asked for a contribution to the army and\r\nnavy.'\r\n\r\nThe argument, which may be applied to all the colonies, amounts\r\nto this, that it would be true national economy to leave free at\r\npresent all the energies and resources of these young countries\r\nfor local defence and for carrying on the mere processes of\r\ngrowth. Obviously the fairness of this arrangement, for which\r\nthere is much to be said, depends entirely on the assurance that\r\nthe colony is to remain permanently a part of the Empire. There\r\nis no reason why Britain or any other mother-country should bear\r\nany part of the natural burdens of a colony if the colony is,\r\nnevertheless, left free to mark its adolescence by declaring\r\nitself independent, or by annexing itself to another and perhaps\r\nrival state. It is equally obvious that such an arrangement\r\ncould in no sense be final; and that it only shifts the question\r\nof more normal adjustment of national burdens to a time not very\r\nfar remote. It could therefore in any case only be looked upon\r\nas a temporary compromise. For instance, the whole volume of\r\ncolonial trade (including India) is to that of the United\r\nKingdom now in about the proportion of four to seven: judging\r\nfrom the relative rate of increase before referred to the day is\r\nnot far distant when they will be equal. The proportion of\r\npopulation is also changing rapidly. The anomaly of one half of\r\nthe national trade and one half of the population bearing the\r\ndirect naval expenditure of the {82} whole would be very great\r\nindeed. This method, too, would seem to conflict rather\r\nseriously with a principle which has become a very fundamental\r\nidea in the British mind, viz. that a bearing of burdens in some\r\nvery direct form must go hand in hand with representation. Till\r\ndirect responsibility in general defence is undertaken, direct\r\nrepresentation in determining general policy can scarcely be\r\nconceded. To fix the point at which any colony should become a\r\ndirect instead of an indirect contributor to the nation's\r\ndefensive strength would be a manifest necessity. To these\r\ncriticisms Sir Charles Tupper can fairly answer that he deals in\r\nhis proposition only with actual and not with prospective\r\nconditions. In fixing new and permanent relations, however, for\r\nan empire which is changing as rapidly as ours, the future must\r\nbe kept in view as much as the present. Doubtless the true\r\nsettlement of the question lies in a compromise between the\r\npresent and the future.\r\n\r\nNot long since one of the most prominent of English statesmen\r\nput the matter to me in this way: 'We in Great Britain know very\r\nwell that while you in the colonies are engaged in organizing\r\ngreat continents and furnishing them with the machinery of\r\ncivilization we cannot expect you to contribute for common\r\npurposes in proportion to us, who start with the stored up\r\nresources and appliances of centuries. But we know that as you\r\ncomplete your docks, harbours and lighthouses, your railroads\r\nand canals, your schoolhouses and churches, as society becomes\r\n{83} settled and the needs of civilization supplied, then you\r\nwill gradually become ready and willing to bear your full\r\nproportion of those burdens which are the token of full and\r\nequal citizenship.' With him, as with Joseph Howe, the\r\nsettlement of the central principle of national unity was the\r\nmain point; the determination of the details of expenditure was\r\na matter for friendly negotiation--for actuaries and\r\naccountants.\r\n\r\nWe may now ask, as did Joseph Howe, whether the great colonies\r\nwould be willing to accept, either immediately or by gradual and\r\nprogressive steps, any further share in the responsibilities of\r\nthe nation. It may be assumed that this decision will be based\r\non the facts and arguments of the case.\r\n\r\n'Reason shows and experience proves that no commercial\r\nprosperity can be durable if it cannot be united, in case of\r\nneed, to naval force.' This remark of De Tocqueville is so fully\r\nproved by the facts of history that its truth may be accepted as\r\naxiomatic. It is a truth for the colonies to consider. Highly\r\ncommercial already, their desire and manifest destiny are to be\r\nstill more so. Canada's commercial navy, as has been said,\r\nalready ranks fourth in the world. She is a first-class shipping\r\npower. Australia's trade is perhaps greater in proportion to\r\npopulation than that of any other country. Alone among all the\r\npeople of the past or present, British colonists have not had to\r\naccept the full responsibilities of increasing commercial\r\ngreatness. The {84} little republic of Chili, with a trade of\r\n£26,000,000, and a population of about 3,000,000 maintains\r\n40,000 tons of armed shipping, at a large annual expense. The\r\nother republics of South America bear like burdens. Australia,\r\nwith its much larger volume of sea trade and far greater of\r\nrevenue, pays only £126,000 for naval defence, strictly confined\r\nto its own shores. Canada, with its remarkable tonnage of ocean\r\nshipping, its great interests at stake on its eastern and\r\nwestern coasts, leans almost entirely for defence of commerce\r\nand fisheries upon British ironclads paid for exclusively by the\r\npeople of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe deceptive argument, drawn from the example of the United\r\nStates at some periods of their history, that a degree of\r\nisolation gives immunity from such burdens, has now lost its\r\nforce. The policy of the Great Republic has been sharply\r\nreversed, and the creation of a powerful navy has become an\r\nobject of national ambition, and is apparently the outcome of\r\nnational necessities developed by the widening of commercial\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nJudged, then, by all historical precedent, the great colonies\r\nmust in the natural course of events accept naval defence as a\r\npart of their ordinary burdens. That they have escaped this form\r\nof expense hitherto is manifestly due almost entirely to the\r\nfact that as parts of the empire they have been so fortunate as\r\nto enjoy without cost the protection of a supreme naval power.\r\nWill they secure the most effective defence, the best return for\r\nthe money they spend, within the {85} Empire or without? Within\r\nthe Empire they would have the advantage of naval bases in every\r\nimportant corner of the world. The portion of force contributed\r\nby themselves would have the prestige of the whole to make it\r\nmost effective. They would have the advantage of all the\r\nstored-up skill and experience of the greatest school of naval\r\ntraining that the world has ever known. They would have the\r\ndirection of naval experience absolutely unique. They would be\r\nable at once in spending their money to avail themselves of the\r\nbest results of naval experiments carried on by the United\r\nKingdom at enormous cost. Alike in cheapness and efficiency they\r\nwould enjoy the advantages which come from co-operation on a\r\ngreat scale.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, an opposing view. Stated in its extreme\r\nform it was put thus, three or four years ago, to the\r\nLegislature of Quebec by Mr. Mercier:--\r\n\r\n'Up to the present time we have lived a colonial life, but today\r\nthey wish us to assume, in spite of ourselves, the\r\nresponsibilities and dangers of a sovereign state, which will\r\nnot be ours. They seek to expose us to vicissitudes of peace and\r\nwar against the great powers of the world; to rigorous\r\nexigencies of military service as practised in Europe; to\r\ndisperse our sons from the freezing regions of the North Pole to\r\nthe burning sands on the desert of Sahara; an odious regime\r\nwhich will condemn us to the forced impost of blood and money,\r\nand wrest from our arms out sons, who are the hope of our\r\ncountry and {86} the consolation of our old days, and send them\r\noff to bloody and distant wars, which we shall not be able to\r\nstop or prevent.'\r\n\r\nProbably Mr. Mercier's auditors were well enough acquainted with\r\nhistory to detect at once the obvious fallacy of his argument.\r\n\r\nStill, it is worth while to remind colonial writers and speakers\r\nwhen they assert, as they sometimes do, that a union of defence\r\nwith Britain means the dragging away of Canadians or Australians\r\nto fight in Europe or Asia, that Britain is the one country in\r\nthe world that has never, in modern times, been compelled to\r\nresort to conscription; that no one is asked to fight in the\r\nranks of her army or in her fleet except those who wish to, and\r\nthat on these terms she has been able to put into the field and\r\non the sea all the soldiers and sailors she requires. This is as\r\ntrue of her large native Indian armies as it is of her English,\r\nScotch, Welsh, or Irish regiments. Britain knows nothing of the\r\nconscription which prevails in Germany, France, and Russia,\r\nwhich even the United States found necessary in the War of\r\nSecession. The men whom Australia sent to the Soudan she sent of\r\nher own accord, and not at Britain's request, much less her\r\ncommand; the numerous Canadian officers now holding commissions\r\nand in the active service of the Empire are there by their own\r\nindividual choice. There is not the slightest reason to suppose\r\nthat the British system of a purely voluntary service would be\r\nchanged under any new political conditions imposed {87} by\r\ncloser union. The career of a soldier is one which has for many\r\nminds a great attraction. With the progress of military science,\r\nit now offers in many of its departments, as never before, a\r\nfield for the highest intellectual qualities and scientific\r\nattainments. To say the very least, to be a defender of one's\r\ncountry is a not unworthy ambition. It is therefore extremely\r\nlikely that into the great career offered by an Imperial service\r\nmany colonists with military predilections would be drawn. Even\r\nif their sole object were to prepare themselves for the service\r\nof the particular part of the Empire to which they belonged, the\r\nwider training to be obtained in the highly organized system of\r\na great state would be invaluable. But once more I repeat that\r\nthe service would be purely voluntary. If Mr. Mercier and those\r\nof his compatriots who think with him have lost what was once\r\nsupposed to be an instinct of their race, they have the\r\nopportunity within the British Empire, which they could not\r\ndepend upon having in France, of following their inclination.\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith states, though I think incorrectly, that\r\ncolonists are essentially non-military. If his view is true,\r\nthen the task of defending the Empire will naturally gravitate\r\ninto the hands of those in whom the military instinct is strong,\r\nof whom the Empire has always as yet found enough for all its\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nAgain, in a somewhat similar connection Mr. Smith speaks of 'the\r\nheavy weight of a constant liability to entanglements in the\r\nquarrels of England all over the {88} world, with which Canada\r\nhas nothing to do, and about which nothing is known by her\r\npeople. Her commerce may any day be cut up and want brought into\r\nher homes by a war about the frontier of Afghanistan, about the\r\ntreatment of Armenia or Crete by the Turks, about the relation\r\nof the Danubian Principalities to Russia, or about the balance\r\nof power in Europe.' Let us put against this flight of\r\nimagination the solid facts of history and see if Canada has had\r\nany reason to feel this pressure of dread from her connection\r\nwith Britain. In 1812 British troops assisted Canadians in\r\nrepelling what Mr. Smith himself describes as 'unprincipled\r\naggression.' Since that time under the British flag Canada has\r\nknown a continuance of peace absolutely without parallel for a\r\ncorresponding' period among all the nations of the world. The\r\nlast European war in which England took part was that with\r\nRussia, closed in 1856. The effect upon Canada of that war was a\r\nstimulus given to her timber and provision trade by the closing\r\nof Baltic and Black Sea ports. One of Canada's own sons, General\r\nWilliams, the hero of Kars, won in that war a fame of which\r\nevery Canadian is proud. Since 1856 there has been an\r\nAustro-Italian war, an Austro-Prussian war, a Franco-Prussian\r\nwar, a Russo-Turkish war. No British sword was drawn, no\r\nCanadian interest touched in all of these. The gigantic civil\r\nwar of secession shook the American union to its foundations;\r\nBritain took no part, and Canadians along with her lived in\r\npeace. In India {89} Britain was compelled in 1856-7 to go\r\nthrough a strain of agony and effort to maintain her place of\r\npower. Canada's sole part was to weep at the fate, to glory in\r\nthe heroism of those who suffered or who won at Lucknow,\r\nCawnpore, Delhi, and a hundred other scenes of conflict. With\r\nEngland's numerous petty wars with barbarian tribes on the\r\nfringe of advancing civilization, mostly undertaken in behalf of\r\ncolonists, Canada has had nothing to do[2]. When she had her\r\nfirst half-breed rebellion British troops were promptly sent to\r\nput it down. So far, then, Canada has not had 'want brought into\r\nher homes' through her connection with Britain, but on the\r\ncontrary has enjoyed a peace and security that might well be the\r\nenvy of the world. Like the United States, Canada enjoys the\r\nadvantage of isolation from European strife, together with the\r\nfurther advantage of connection {90} with a power whose flag\r\ngives to Canadian ships and commerce on every ocean the surest\r\nguarantee of safety at present existing in the world; a\r\nguarantee the importance and significance of which will increase\r\nwith the growth of Canadian commerce; a guarantee which she\r\ncould not possibly find under an independent flag, nor yet under\r\nthe flag of the United States, whose one weakness, by the\r\nadmission of American authorities themselves, lies in the want\r\nof those naval bases which are everywhere the necessary adjuncts\r\nof extended maritime security.\r\n\r\nBut even when the extraordinary immunity from the risks of war\r\nwhich the colonies have enjoyed under the British flag has been\r\ndemonstrated it seems well to give due weight to any honest\r\nobjection which exists to committing themselves entirely to the\r\nmilitary policy of the Empire at large, until, at least, the\r\nsense of national unity has had time to become fully developed.\r\nThat the colonies will refuse to contribute to Imperial defence,\r\nas is sometimes asserted, I do not believe, and facts are\r\nthemselves now beginning to disprove the statement. That they\r\nmay contribute enormously to the national strength without\r\noffending the prejudices of even the most sensitive may also be\r\nshown. Lord Thring has made a suggestion upon this point which\r\nseems to me exceedingly interesting and helpful. After pointing\r\nout the overwhelming common interest which all parts of the\r\nEmpire have in resisting attack from without, he proposes that\r\nin each of the great colonies willing {91} to enter into the\r\narrangement defensive forces should be created which would be\r\nrecognized parts of the Imperial army and navy. These forces\r\nshould not primarily be under a compulsory obligation to serve\r\nout of their own countries, or beyond their own limits, but when\r\ncalled out for Imperial purposes within their limits they should\r\nform a part of the Imperial army and navy, and be under the same\r\ngeneral control. But the colonial forces should be empowered to\r\nvolunteer for the common national service out of their own\r\nlimits, and on so doing they should be regarded as an integral\r\npart of the nation's defensive force.\r\n\r\nA national military and naval organization such as that here\r\nsuggested would appeal directly to that local patriotism,\r\ninstinctive in all, which considers no sacrifice too great if it\r\nis made for the defence of men's own homes and firesides; it\r\nfurnishes the opportunity for that wider national patriotism\r\nwhich knows that the safety of the parts depends upon the safety\r\nof the whole; and it meets the objection which has been\r\nmentioned before, and is often made, to young communities being\r\ncompelled against their will to take an active part outside\r\ntheir own borders in wars in which their concern is only\r\nindirect. The actual defensive force of the Empire would be\r\nimmensely increased by the effective organization of each part\r\nunder a common direction, a necessity so often and strenuously\r\ninsisted upon by Sir Charles Dilke and others who have thought\r\nand written upon national defence; its contingent force would be\r\nstill {92} more increased in the event of a war which appeals to\r\nthe reason and sympathy of the several great communities.\r\n\r\nThose who argue for separation in the colonies, as well as men\r\nlike the late Mr. Bright at home, rest their case largely upon\r\nthe view that the mother-country carries permanently along with\r\nher the entanglements of a traditional foreign policy which is\r\nchiefly European, and with which it is unfair to involve young\r\ncommunities in parts of the world remote from Europe[3]. This\r\nview seems based on past history more than on the facts of the\r\npresent. More and more every day Britain tends to become a world\r\npower, and it is this fact rather than her European position\r\nwhich dominates her policy. She faces Europe much more in the\r\ninterest of her colonies than in the support of ancient\r\ntraditions. We have only to read the news from day to day, or\r\nthe summary of national policy for a year as it is presented in\r\na Queen's Speech, to see that Lord Salisbury was within the\r\nstrict limit of fact when he told a deputation but a few months\r\nsince that his work in the Foreign Office had made him {93}\r\ndeeply sensible of 'the large portion of our foreign\r\nnegotiations, our foreign difficulties, and the danger of\r\nforeign complications which arise entirely from our colonial\r\nconnections; and the effect is that from time to time we have to\r\nexercise great vigilance lest we should incur dangers which do\r\nnot arise from any interest of our own, but arise entirely from\r\nthe interests of the important and interesting communities to\r\nwhich we are linked.'\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with the United States in the Behring Sea and the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence, and with the French in Newfoundland; the\r\ncomplicated negotiations with Germany, Portugal, and other\r\npowers, European and native, in Africa, chiefly entered into in\r\nbehalf of colonies or colonizing companies, are, to take the\r\nvery latest illustrations, quite sufficient to give definiteness\r\nto Lord Salisbury's statement[4].\r\n\r\nTo some sincere thinkers in the colonies the value of British\r\nprotection seems slight compared with the risks entailed by the\r\nImperial connection. They believe that the true and evident\r\npolicy for these young countries is to break off this connection\r\nand so free {94} themselves from its dangers. Having no reason\r\nto quarrel with anybody they anticipate with independence not\r\nonly the immunity which they have enjoyed from war, but the\r\nfurther relief from the fear of war. Commerce carried on without\r\nnaval protection; internal safety secured without expense on\r\nmilitary organization; a neutral flag respected by all\r\nbelligerents; the settlement of all differences by friendly\r\narbitration, seem to them not unreasonable expectations.\r\n\r\nThe dread of some Englishmen, on the other hand, is that they\r\nmay be drawn into wars in which they have no direct interest by\r\nthe action of individual colonies.\r\n\r\nEach of these opinions has some superficial ground of\r\njustification; each process of reasoning has, if pushed to its\r\nfinal conclusions, fatal defects. But is there not reason to\r\nbelieve that the growth of the Empire is bringing us to a point\r\nwhen the policy of England and her colonies may be entirely\r\ncoincident on the great questions of peace or war?\r\n\r\nIn the desperate struggle for existence which England in past\r\ncenturies has often had to carry on, in those contests which\r\nhave toughened the fibre of her children and fitted them to be\r\nof the ruling races of the world, she has often had to make\r\ncombinations or enter into agreements with the European nations\r\naround her from which she would gladly have kept herself free.\r\nBut with the spread of the Empire abroad England is every day\r\nbecoming more able {95} to look away from Europe, to stand aloof\r\nfrom purely European disputes, and to secure all the strength\r\nshe requires from combination with communities which are her own\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nSuch an outcome of the nation's life would be the best\r\njustification for all that England has suffered and spent in\r\nbuilding up the Empire. But it is not for colonists to forget\r\nthat she has spent and suffered much.\r\n\r\nAt Melbourne two years ago, in a lecture intended to refute the\r\narguments for British unity, and to point out the danger to\r\nAustralia of remaining connected with the Empire, Sir Archibald\r\nMichie, with great apparent deliberation, said: 'As the\r\nmiserable result of her (England's) past foreign policy, as\r\nineffectual to any good purpose as it has proved expensive, she\r\nis indebted to the amount of some £700,000,000 to the public\r\ncreditor, the National Debt. To what an extent does not this one\r\nmiserable fact, so disgusting to all Chancellors of the\r\nExchequer, cripple the strength and movements of the\r\nmother-country, and weaken her influence with the world at\r\nlarge.' Were this the thought of a single man it would be scarce\r\nworth while to recall it. But in some of the colonies similar\r\nreference to the National Debt is found not infrequently in\r\njournals which must be taken seriously, and in the mouths of men\r\nwho influence public opinion. Often it is emphasized by a\r\ntriumphant allusion to the different application of colonial\r\nborrowings, represented as they are by assets in the form of\r\nrailways, canals, harbour improvements, {96} telegraph systems,\r\nand public works of many kinds. The criticism and comparison\r\nseem misleading in the last degree.\r\n\r\nWe may make a liberal allowance for mistakes in British foreign\r\npolicy. We may criticise things done in the heat of national\r\npassion, or at times when Britain was carrying on a struggle for\r\nexistence. We may leave out of our reckoning the glory of having\r\nsaved the liberties of Europe when other nations were yielding\r\nin despair, when British subsidies alone brought their armies\r\ninto the field, and British resolution inspired them with new\r\ncourage. Yet, when all this allowance has been made, we may say\r\nthat a colonist is perhaps the last man in the world to sneer at\r\nthe public debt of England. She came out of the prolonged and\r\ntremendous struggle which piled up her debt possessing as an\r\nasset to show for it about one-fifth of the known world.\r\nProfessor Seeley has proved conclusively that England's great\r\ncontinental wars, the chief causes of her vast expenditures,\r\nwere in large measure contests for colonial supremacy. From\r\nthose wars she gained the power to give Canada to the Canadians,\r\nAustralia to the Australians, vast areas and limitless resources\r\nin many lands to those of her people who have gone to inhabit\r\nthem, and so to complete by industry the conquest begun by arms.\r\nFrom those wars she emerged with a command of the sea which has\r\nenabled her to supplement her gift of territory with a guarantee\r\nof safety which has secured it from attack during the early\r\nstages of settlement until the {97} present time. The National\r\nDebt would seem to be a natural mortgage upon the territories\r\nacquired by war expenditure, yet the gift of Crown lands which\r\nwas made to the colonies acquiring responsible government was\r\nmade absolutely free from this mortgage. These Crown lands in\r\nall the colonies are sold and used entirely for local benefit,\r\nwhile the whole incidence of taxation for what may fairly be\r\ncalled the interest of the purchase-money falls upon the United\r\nKingdom alone.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the great expeditions which culminated in the\r\nvictory on the Plains of Abraham is a considerable item in the\r\nNational Debt, but half a continent now held by Canadians is no\r\ninsignificant item to set against it. If the expenditure for the\r\nAmerican War be put down as a mistake, it must be remembered\r\nthat the United States themselves, no less than Canada, reaped\r\nthe advantage from the previous expenditure which set the\r\nAnglo-Saxon on the American continent free from French\r\nrivalry[5].\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the French Government asked the British Foreign\r\nOffice how much of the vast unoccupied {98} areas of Australia\r\nit claimed. 'The whole of it,' was the prompt reply. No doubt\r\nthe recollection of the Plains of Abraham, of Trafalgar, of\r\nWaterloo, had something to do with the acceptance of that reply\r\nas conclusive.\r\n\r\nIf the colonies are able to expend their borrowings on\r\nreproductive works alone, this advantage is not entirely due to\r\ntheir own superior prudence, but in part at least to the\r\ncircumstance that they have been protected by a great Imperial\r\npower not afraid to go into debt for national ends. Gibraltar\r\nand Malta, Aden, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the Cape and St.\r\nHelena, stations in every corner of the world for the protection\r\nof the commerce of the colonies as much as that of the United\r\nKingdom, are the best answers to those who sneer at the National\r\nDebt of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe United States incurred a war debt of more than 2000,000,000\r\ndollars, not indeed in carrying out a foreign policy, right or\r\nwrong, but in remedying mistakes of internal policy. The war\r\nbrought no vast addition of territory;  it simply saved the\r\nstate from disruption. No one doubts that the expenditure has\r\nbeen more than repaid by the national unity and greatness which\r\nit secured. But the very people who were crushed by that vast\r\noutlay have been obliged, since they remain within the nation,\r\nto contribute to the payment of the debt incurred.\r\n\r\nThey are obliged to contribute their share of the vast pension\r\nroll, amounting to much more than 100,000,000 dollars per annum,\r\npaid to the soldiers of the Union {99} who crushed them.\r\nCompared with this, the magnanimity of the mother-land in\r\nhanding over to her younger communities, absolutely free from\r\nincumbrance either of mortgage, of military responsibility, or\r\nof commercial restraint, the major part of those vast assets\r\nwhich she had to show for her national debt, seems to me\r\namazing. A colonist, reproaching England with her foreign policy\r\nand the debt which it led to, cuts a sorry figure in the face of\r\nthese facts. And if we put the £30,000,000 added to the debt of\r\nEngland in order to extinguish slavery beside the price paid by\r\nthe United States for the same national purification, we shall\r\ndiscover reasons for thinking that there may be national\r\nmistakes worse than those to be discovered in the foreign policy\r\nof Britain.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke says[6]: 'It is a remarkable instance of past\r\nImperial carelessness that the very principles upon which the\r\nburden of defence should be divided between ourselves and\r\ncolonies, and the proportions in which it should be borne, have\r\nnever been settled.'\r\n\r\nAnd again[7]: 'It is not the United Kingdom only but the whole\r\nBritish Empire which needs consistent and united organization\r\nfor defence. The colonies should be represented on our great\r\nGeneral Staff, and the principle of self-preservation, applied\r\nto the Empire, should be disentangled from the petty {100}\r\npolitical questions by which the relations between the\r\nmother-country and her children are often hampered and sometimes\r\nembittered. ... Unfortunately, considerations of Imperial\r\ndefence, which should be regarded from the point of view of\r\ncommon self-interest, are apt to become mixed up with the\r\nindividual and fleeting interests of various portions of the\r\nEmpire. If, as I hope, we are to continue to stand together as a\r\nconfederacy holding the future of the greater portion of the\r\nworld in its hands, the inhabitants of the home islands and of\r\nthe colonies must come to an understanding for mutual support\r\nduring the crisis of civilization in which we may find ourselves\r\nat any moment.'\r\n\r\nI have often had occasion to quote Sir Charles Dilke's opinions\r\non questions which have come within the range of this\r\ndiscussion. The luminous and exhaustive statement of the\r\ncondition and resources of the Empire contained in the two\r\nvolumes of the '_Problems of Greater Britain_,' though somewhat\r\nweighted by detail, and in my opinion weakened by an imperfect\r\nbalancing of the primary and secondary forces at work in the\r\ncolonies, is still by far the most valuable contribution yet\r\nmade to the study of our national position. The line of argument\r\nby which the author proves the necessity for closer defensive\r\norganization of the different parts of the Empire seems to me\r\noverwhelming in its conclusiveness. His demand that the colonies\r\nshould be represented on the General Staff which is to\r\nconstitute the {101} brain of the nation in military questions,\r\nhis impressive warnings that the mother-land and colonies must\r\nstand side by side in protecting the commerce and civilization\r\nwhich both have borne a part in building up, make it very\r\ndifficult to understand the hesitating and irresolute attitude\r\nwhich he takes in his chapter (vol. ii. part vii.) on 'Future\r\nRelations' to the question of Federation, or any defined system\r\nof political union. Military combination, even for defensive\r\npurposes alone, must certainly mean a common foreign policy and\r\nthe joint expenditure which is necessary to make it effective; a\r\ncommon foreign policy and expenditure imply some means of giving\r\nadequate expression to the will of all the communities\r\nconcerned; and to most minds that, I think, will point directly\r\nand inevitably to some form of common representation. Military\r\nauthorities may plan and advise, but under any British system of\r\ngovernment political authorities who derive their mandate\r\ndirectly from the citizens can alone make the plan effective.\r\nMere alliance could never accomplish all that the author of the\r\n'Problems of Greater Britain' believes essential to the safety\r\nof the Empire. Alliance is temporary and easily revocable, and\r\ntherefore by no means a settlement of permanent national\r\nquestions. The moment that an attempt is made to remedy the\r\ncarelessness complained of, to settle the principles upon which\r\nthe burden of defence is to be divided between the mother-land\r\nand colonies, 'to come to an understanding for mutual support,'\r\nit will be found {102} that immediately behind the military\r\nproblem is the political problem[8].\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Nineteenth Century_, Oct. 1891.\r\n\r\n[2] While these pages are going through the press there comes,\r\nas if to qualify what is here said, the news that a young\r\nCanadian, Captain William H. Robinson, of the Royal Engineers,\r\nhas met a soldier's death while leading, with conspicuous\r\ncourage, an attack on Tambi in Sierra Leone. Trained in Canadian\r\nschools, and graduated with the highest honours from the\r\nCanadian Military College at Kingston, he had steadily pushed\r\nhis way forward in the Imperial service and had for some time\r\nbeen in charge of the important fortifications in course of\r\nconstruction at Sierra Leone. In the ardent pursuit of his\r\nprofession he had specially volunteered for the service on which\r\nhe was engaged when he met his end. As his teacher I had\r\noccasion to watch over the early development of his very\r\nexceptional powers. Britain has, first and last, sacrificed many\r\nprecious lives on Canadian soil, but in Captain Robinson Canada\r\nhas begun to repay the debt to the mother-land with one of the\r\nmost promising of the sons she has yet produced.\r\n\r\n[3] 'I should like to ask the friends of federation whether the\r\ncolonies of this country--Canada, and the great colonies which\r\ncluster in the South Pacific and in Australia--whether these\r\ncolonies would be willing to bind themselves to the stupid and\r\nregrettable foreign policy of the Government of this country?\r\nWill they take the responsibility of entering into wars which\r\nwill be 10,000 miles away, and in which they can have no\r\npossible interest or influence, and in which they could have\r\nbeen in no degree consulted as to the cost? My opinion is that\r\nthe colonies will never stand a policy of that kind.'--John\r\nBright at Birmingham, March 28th, 1888.\r\n\r\n[4] A Liberal Foreign Minister has lately expressed the same\r\nthought in other words. 'Our great Empire has pulled us, so to\r\nspeak, by the coat-tails out of the European system; and though\r\nwith our great predominance, our great moral influence, and our\r\ngreat fleet, with our traditions in Europe and our aspirations\r\nto preserve the peace of Europe, we can never remove ourselves\r\naltogether from the European system, we must recognise that our\r\nforeign policy has become a colonial policy, and is in reality\r\nat this moment much more dictated from the extremities of the\r\nempire than it is from London itself.'--Lord Rosebery to the\r\nCity Liberal Club, March 23rd, 1892.\r\n\r\n[5] American writers admit this, 'The Seven Years' War made\r\nEngland what she is. It crippled the commerce of her rival,\r\nruined France in two continents, and blighted her as a colonial\r\npower. It gave England the control of the seas, and the mastery\r\nof North America and India, made her the first of commercial\r\nnations, and prepared the vast colonial system that has planted\r\nNew Englands in every part of the globe. _And while it made\r\nEngland what she is it supplied to the United States the\r\nindispensable condition of their greatness, if not of their\r\nnational existence_:--Introduction to _Montcalm and Wolfe_\r\n(Parkman).\r\n\r\n[6] _Problems of Greater Britain_, vol. ii. 522.\r\n\r\n[7] _United Service Magazine_, April, 1890.\r\n\r\n[8] Since the above was written a very distinct advance of\r\nthought on the question of British unity has been indicated in\r\nthe work on 'Imperial Defence,' just published by Sir Charles\r\nDilke and Mr. Spencer Wilkinson. The authors say (p. 54): 'It is\r\nenough to say, that the great question, perhaps the greatest\r\nquestion, which has to be answered by the present generation of\r\nEnglishmen, is whether the British Empire is to become a series\r\nof independent, though, perhaps, friendly states, or to make a\r\nreality of the military unity which at the present time is\r\nrather a sentiment than a practical institution. It is evidently\r\nimpossible to organise the defences of the Empire until this\r\nprior question has been settled, and it is quite impossible\r\nuntil it has been faced to determine properly the policy of\r\nGreat Britain. If the principle of the unity of the Empire and\r\nthe unity of its defences is maintained the greatest conceivable\r\ndegree of security would have been gained for the whole and for\r\nevery part, and the British Empire could afford, as against the\r\nattack, of any single power, to steer clear of all alliances and\r\nto pursue a policy solely to the immediate welfare of its\r\nsubjects. ... Before, then, the defence of the British Empire\r\ncan be placed throughout on a permanently satisfactory footing,\r\nit seems necessary that the great political question of the\r\ncentury should be settled, and that Englishmen all over the\r\nworld should make up their minds as to the real nature of\r\nGreater Britain.' The most ardent Federationist could not wish\r\nfor a more succinct statement of the national position than\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{103}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the relation of the United Kingdom to the question\r\nof national unity we must try to grasp the main features of the\r\nastonishing and unparalleled change which in the last half or\r\nthree quarters of a century has come over the industrial\r\ncondition of the British Islands. This change has left them in a\r\nposition absolutely unique among the nations of the present day,\r\na position, moreover, to which history furnishes no parallel.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that when the Queen came to the throne, of\r\nthe working population of the country one-third were\r\nagricultural labourers, and one-third were artizans. There has\r\nsince been an addition of from 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 to the\r\nwhole population, and at the end of this period of remarkable\r\ngrowth we find ourselves face to face with the overwhelming fact\r\nthat of all the working classes of Great Britain only an eighth\r\nare agricultural labourers while three-fourths are artizans.\r\nWhat this means is in no way more tersely described than when we\r\nsay that Britain has become the workshop of the {104} world.\r\nWhat it involves is the conclusion that never in the history of\r\nthe human race has any great nation lived under such artificial\r\nconditions as do British people at the end of this period of\r\nextraordinary industrial development, a period which has its\r\nlimit well within the century. All the circumstances of national\r\nexistence have been revolutionized.\r\n\r\nAfter the application to the soil of intense culture, of\r\nscientific skill, of abundant capital, of cheap labour, only\r\nabout 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 quarters of wheat are produced out\r\nof the 28,000,000 quarters which now represent the annual\r\nconsumption. The rest comes from the far distant prairies of the\r\nUnited States and Canada, from India, South Australia, New\r\nZealand, the Black Sea and the Baltic. With other cereals it is\r\nthe same, the demand for those which cannot be produced at all\r\nin Great Britain, such as rice and maize, being immense.\r\n\r\nCheap ocean freights, which make it possible to transfer a\r\nbushel of wheat by sea from Montreal or New York to London at a\r\nlower price than it can be carried by rail from some English\r\ncounties to London, handicap the English producer still more. It\r\nseems as if the dependence upon the outside world for grain\r\nsupplies were likely to increase, not merely with the rapid\r\nincrease of population which is still going on, but with the\r\nnecessity of applying the land to more profitable forms of\r\nproduction as ocean transit is still further cheapened, and as\r\nincreasing prosperity leads to a greater consumption of animal\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n{105}\r\n\r\nAs with grain foods so with meat. Hundreds of thousands of live\r\ncattle, many hundred thousand tons of meat, chilled, frozen,\r\nsalted, or tinned, pour into the country every year from across\r\nthe sea. Canada alone last year sent 123,000 head of cattle; New\r\nZealand nearly 1,500,000 frozen carcasses of sheep. It has been\r\nestimated that the quantity of meat food in the United Kingdom\r\nat any time is only sufficient to supply the market for three\r\nmonths; beyond that all must come from without.\r\n\r\nSo also with cheese, fruit, and other staple articles of\r\nconsumption. Still more striking is the dependence on distant\r\nlands for a wide range of articles once esteemed luxuries, but\r\nnow reckoned among the comforts, if not the necessities, of\r\ndaily life, such as sugar, tea, and coffee. If the massing of\r\nfacts into figures best conveys to some minds the nature of the\r\nsituation it may be put in the statement that every year the\r\nUnited Kingdom pays for articles used for food brought from\r\nabroad the sum of £153,000,000 sterling. Or it may be better\r\nillustrated by a comparison. Draw around almost any other nation\r\nor country of modern times--Germany, Italy, Russia, the United\r\nStates, Canada, Australia--a barrier preventing the ingress of\r\nany food supply from the outer world. There will be\r\ninconvenience, some measure of restriction of consumption in a\r\nfew particulars, but the condition is one which could be endured\r\nnot merely for months but for years. Place a like barrier around\r\nthe British Islands and {106} in six weeks the pressure of want\r\nwill begin to be felt; in six months starvation will be the\r\nprevalent condition of the population.\r\n\r\nSuch a picture is, of course, imaginary--the fact which lies\r\nbehind it is stern reality.\r\n\r\nThe illustration emphasizes, but does not exaggerate, the\r\nabsolutely unique nature of the national position.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the course of human history we have had in\r\nthe last half century presented to us in the British Islands the\r\nspectacle of a great people depending for its existence upon the\r\nsafe and continuous transport from the most remote corners of\r\nthe globe of about two-thirds of the chief articles of daily\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThat the outlook of such a people upon the world should differ\r\nfundamentally from that of any other people of past times or of\r\nthe present day is manifest. What has been said is not meant to\r\nprove that the situation is one which should necessarily induce\r\nextraordinary anxiety. Difficulties are to be measured by the\r\nresources at hand to grapple with them. Danger only comes when\r\nthe sense of proportion between the two is lost.\r\n\r\nFood is not all. Britain the workshop of the world, and\r\nthree-fourths of its working population artizans! Upon what do\r\nthese vast armies of industry, these millions of working men and\r\nwomen, spend their toil to earn the wages that buy the food thus\r\nbrought to them from such great distances and at {107} such\r\nexpense? Once more we find the ends of the earth scoured to\r\nfurnish them with the raw material upon which they work. Wool\r\nfrom Australia, New Zealand, India, Africa, South America;\r\ncotton from the Southern States, India, Egypt; timber from\r\nCanada, Russia, Scandinavia, Honduras; precious metals, ores,\r\njute, hemp and other fibres, oils, gums, ivory, shells, hides,\r\nfurs, precious stones--everything that can be moulded for use or\r\nbeauty, all productions of land and sea, are poured forth day by\r\nday from the holds of a thousand ships in the greater ports of\r\nthe United Kingdom to be transferred to the centres of British\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe critical character of this dependence for a perfectly steady\r\nsupply of raw material is under modern conditions as striking as\r\nthe extent of the dependence. The great Yorkshire woollen\r\nspinners tell us that to be cut off even for three or four weeks\r\nfrom the supplies of Australian wool would mean the closing of\r\nhundreds or thousands of factories and a widespread paralysis of\r\nindustry. They point out that when the regularity of sea\r\ntransport depended upon wind and weather, or when the home\r\nmarket supplied a larger share of the material, common prudence\r\nmade it necessary to lay in heavy stocks to provide against\r\ncontingencies for many months. So fixed has now become the habit\r\nof depending upon the regular arrival of ocean steam-ships from\r\nweek to week, the regular sequence of great wool sales at\r\nfrequent stated periods, that it is possible {108} in\r\nmanufacturing to live as it were from hand to mouth; that, as a\r\nmatter of fact, a large proportion of manufacturers do so live,\r\npurchasing only enough for their immediate wants, and renewing\r\ntheir stock at very short intervals. Thus the effect of any\r\nstoppage of sea-transport would be disastrously felt at once,\r\nreaching in its influence alike the manufacturing capitalist and\r\nthe workman in his cottage.\r\n\r\nA group of manufacturers at Galashiels, one of the important\r\nScottish centres of the wool trade, told me that nine out of\r\nevery ten pounds of wool they used was Australian. The\r\nproportion can scarcely be less in the Bradford district and\r\nother large areas of Yorkshire. Nor are such illustrations of\r\nthe completeness of dependence on supplies abroad exceptional or\r\nconfined to wool. Cut off Dundee from its importations of Indian\r\njute and the collapse of its main industry would be sudden and\r\ngeneral. Lancashire is not likely to forget what it means to\r\nlose control of her ordinary markets for obtaining raw cotton.\r\nWe may put together once more the figures which express this\r\nmarvellous relation to British industry to the remoter parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nFor wool last year Britain paid £26,000,000; for raw cotton\r\n£40,000,000; wood £14,000,000; metals £23,000,000; flax, hemp,\r\nand jute £10,000,000; and so on.\r\n\r\nBut even what has been said of food and raw material of\r\nmanufacture exhibits but one side of the national position. To\r\nbe the workshop of the world {109} implies access to the markets\r\nof the world. I say nothing of the vast centres of commerce\r\nabroad which serve as the main points of distribution. But go to\r\nthe loneliest Australian or New Zealand bush; to the backwoods\r\nand remote prairies of Canada; to distant South African gold and\r\ndiamond diggings, and we find the shelves of the humblest shop\r\nfilled with the products of the looms of Yorkshire, Lancashire,\r\nor Paisley, of the factories everywhere scattered throughout the\r\nUnited Kingdom where the vast inflow of raw material is worked\r\nup. To foreign countries, as well as to those inhabited by\r\nBritish people, to every civilized or uncivilized continent,\r\ndistrict, or island, however remote, these manufactures\r\npenetrate, and must continue to penetrate, if the vast fabric of\r\nBritish industry is to be maintained.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the figures which represent the annual aggregate of\r\nexport trade are immense: cotton goods £70,000,000; woollen\r\ngoods £26,000,000; iron and steel £28,000,000; machinery £\r\n13,000,000.\r\n\r\nBetween this great inflow of raw material and food, and the\r\nequally great output of manufactured goods, has sprung up yet\r\nanother prime factor in Britain's industrial position, her\r\nshipping interests. She has become by far the greatest of ocean\r\ncarriers. It is not merely that scores of millions of capital\r\nare invested in ships alone; that 60 per cent. of all the steam\r\ntonnage of the world and a large proportion of its sailing\r\ntonnage are under the British flag; that tens of thousands of\r\nmen find employment {110} upon the seas, and tens of thousands\r\nmore in the immediate handling of ships and their cargoes around\r\nBritish harbours and docks. The mere construction of ships and\r\ntheir equipment for this vast carrying trade gives an impulse to\r\nalmost every form of British industry. The shipyards of the\r\nClyde alone turn out at times a thousand tons or more of iron or\r\nsteel shipping for every working day of the year. The vast\r\naggregate for the whole country forms a large element in the\r\nindustrial life of the nation.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in roughest outline, is a picture of the unique\r\nposition which the British Islands hold in the world today. Let\r\nus remind ourselves once more that the extreme singularity of\r\nthis situation has been created well within the span of an\r\nordinary life, for the sea-borne commerce of the United Kingdom,\r\nwhich today has an annual value of more than £740,000,000, was,\r\nwhen the Queen came to the throne in 1837, only £155,000,000.\r\nThe difference between these figures fairly measures the\r\nincreased dependence of the country upon its imports, exports,\r\nand the carrying trade.\r\n\r\nNow for a nation existing under conditions such as have been\r\ndescribed, where the work and wages and food of the masses of\r\nthe people depend on easy and constant access to the remotest\r\ncorners of the globe, it seems possible to indicate what must be\r\nthe end and aim of national policy--the supreme objects of\r\nstatesmanship. Surely the first object must be to {111} secure\r\nthe absolute safety for trading purposes of the water-ways of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nMaritime security Britain is bound to maintain, if she is to\r\nretain manufacturing superiority. The only manufacturing rival\r\nwhich seriously threatens her is the United States. It is a\r\nfriendly rivalry, and should remain such. But each country, with\r\nwhat advantages it has, will play relentlessly for its own hand,\r\nand for the welfare, real or supposed, of its own people.\r\nBritain carries on the contest by means of Free Trade, thereby\r\ncheapening production, and winning the market of the world. The\r\nUnited States use for their weapon Protection, stimulating\r\nproduction till it becomes cheap. Britain also, under this\r\nopposing condition, depends for food and material on the outside\r\nworld--the United States have the food and most of the material\r\nwithin themselves. The first serious break in Britain's power to\r\nhold the waterways of the world would place her at a fatal\r\ndisadvantage. Safe in a continental isolation the United States\r\ncould supply the customers who came to her for manufactured\r\ngoods with what they wanted. To be on even terms Britain must\r\nhave maritime security, and this she could not have if by the\r\nsuccessive cutting away of her great outlying offshoots she\r\nshould lose control of those points of vantage which now are the\r\nsecret of her supremacy quite as much as the ships which she\r\nsends forth from her dockyards.\r\n\r\nSecond only to maritime security seems to me the necessity for a\r\ncountry in the position of Great Britain {112} to keep as far as\r\npossible the sources from which she draws her food and raw\r\nmaterial within the national domain.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has had at least one sharp reminder of the\r\nadvantage which would accrue to a country so dependent as she is\r\non the outside world of having the areas of production under the\r\nnational flag. This reminder was one which gave a rough shock to\r\nthe generally accepted theory that if the consumer wants to buy\r\nand the producer wants to sell, all the conditions for\r\nsatisfactory commercial intercourse between countries are\r\nfulfilled without reference to national relationship. In 1865\r\nthe War of Secession broke out in America, and the ports of the\r\ncotton-producing states were blockaded. Millions of bales of\r\ncotton were wasting on the wharves and in the warehouses at New\r\nOrleans, Charleston, and other Southern towns. On the other\r\nhand, in Lancashire millions of spindles were idle, and vast\r\nbodies of people were reduced to extreme need or thrown for a\r\nlong period upon the charity of the benevolent from want of the\r\nraw material of their industry. The producers certainly wished\r\nto sell, the consumers to purchase. English manufacturers had\r\nmoney with which to buy--English shippers had the vessels to\r\ncarry--the English Government had the men-of-war which could\r\neasily have forced a way to the supplies which were needed.\r\nBetween was the barrier of international law and national\r\nhonour, which forbid a neutral nation to interfere with\r\nbelligerents. The barrier was respected, {113} and England\r\npassed triumphantly through the moral strain involved in\r\nresisting the temptation to go to war for an industrial end\r\nalone. The lesson to be learned from such an example appears\r\nmanifest. The retention of the national right to keep open the\r\ncommunication between the centre of consumption and the areas of\r\nsupply is alike desirable for the industry of the one and of the\r\nother. To give an obvious illustration. The vast woollen\r\nindustries of Yorkshire are supplied almost exclusively from\r\nregions now within the Empire--New Zealand, Australia, India,\r\nand South Africa. So long as these countries remain under a\r\ncommon British flag the working man who produces the wool and\r\nthe working man who spins it retain the national right to keep\r\ntheir industries in touch with each other: the moment they pass\r\nout from under the flag that right is given up. Great Britain\r\nwould have no more right to force her way into the ports of an\r\nindependent Australia or New Zealand, blockaded by a German,\r\nFrench, or Chinese fleet, than she had to force her way into the\r\nharbours of Louisiana or South Carolina. The neutral flag may\r\nfurnish a way of escape for Britain's industry when she is\r\nherself in direct conflict with another power; it gives no\r\nassistance when a nation with which she is at peace chooses to\r\nclose the ports of a country from which she draws her food or\r\nthe material of her industry. The reader will find that the\r\nillustration is a far-reaching one if he extends it to the whole\r\nrange of Britain's wants either for supply or for markets for\r\nher manufactured {114} goods; and to the whole range of colonial\r\nnecessity for a market for their staple products, and a supply\r\nof what they do not produce.\r\n\r\nStill more significant is the illustration if he remember that\r\nas regards food supply the Empire might, in an emergency, soon\r\nbecome entirely independent of foreign countries, while, with\r\nthe single exception of cotton, we could tide over an indefinite\r\nperiod even in the matter of raw material for manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{115}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN we come to regard our question from the colonial point of\r\nview the first place in any consideration must obviously be\r\ngiven to Canada. The national problem is there presented to us\r\nin a crucial form. The growth and consolidation of the Dominion\r\nhave done more than anything else to make manifest the anomalous\r\ncondition of the Empire. In it we have a colony with a\r\npopulation twice as large as the United States had when they\r\nbecame independent, larger than that of England in Elizabeth's\r\ntime, or than that of some considerable European States at the\r\npresent day. It is a population which has proved itself equal to\r\nthe highest duties of citizenship. The slowness of earlier\r\ngrowth has not been without advantage, since it has\r\nunquestionably given steadiness and maturity to political\r\nthought. With comparative suddenness Canada has now caught the\r\ninspiration of a large national life. Vast undertakings in the\r\ndirection of material progress are entered upon with confidence\r\nand executed with success. On political lines her people have\r\nbeen the first to prove by actual experiment {116} on a large\r\nscale the adaptability of a federal system to British methods of\r\nrepresentative and responsible government. Since confederation\r\nwas entered into nearly twenty-five years ago self-reliance has\r\nbecome the keynote of Canadian life and has produced its\r\nlegitimate and ordinary results. In material development, in\r\npolitical organization, in the spirit of the people, the\r\nDominion has reached the stage looked forward to by early\r\nthinkers on colonial problems as the one at which it might\r\nreasonably be expected to assume an independent national\r\nexistence. It must therefore soon bring to the test the theories\r\nof these thinkers as to the results of national expansion.\r\n\r\nThe position of Canada is made unique among British colonies by\r\nanother condition. She is so placed geographically that\r\nannexation to another kindred state is a manifestly possible\r\nalternative to either independence or continued British\r\nconnection. Whether independence, annexation to the United\r\nStates, or a closer and permanent union with the Empire is most\r\nconsistent with the honour and interest of the Canadian people,\r\nand whether the separation of Canada from the Empire is a matter\r\nof indifference to the British nation at large, are questions to\r\nbe here discussed.\r\n\r\nFacts of geography, facts of history, and questions of trade\r\nrelations, must enter chiefly into the consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is an advantage in giving the first place to geography.\r\n\r\n{117}\r\n\r\nA glance at the map shows the relation of Canada to the Oceanic\r\nEmpire of which it now forms a part. It fronts towards Europe on\r\nthe Atlantic and towards Asia on the Pacific. On both oceans it\r\ngives the finest naval positions that a great maritime power\r\ncould desire, and the only positions possible for British people\r\non the American continent. A wonderful system of waterways\r\npenetrates, from the Atlantic frontage, unto the very heart of\r\nthe continent, to prairies which are the greatest undeveloped\r\nwheat area in the world, lands capable of supporting a large\r\npopulation and of proved capacity to yield a vast surplus of\r\nfood products. The trend of the Great Lakes and of the St.\r\nLawrence towards the point which gives the shortest sea\r\nconnection with Europe indicates the natural direction in which\r\nthis food surplus will chiefly flow. Should the still open\r\nquestion of the summer navigation of Hudson's Bay by grain\r\nvessels be settled in the affirmative, even the facilities\r\noffered by the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence for cheap\r\ntransit would be eclipsed, and western wheat placed on English\r\nmarkets at a rate hitherto unknown. But this is a contingency,\r\nand it is perhaps better to confine the attention to settled\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThe significance of Canada's geographical position, facing and\r\ncommanding the two great northern oceans at the points nearest\r\nto the opposite continents of Europe and Asia, is supplemented\r\nby geological facts of extreme national interest. At the very\r\npoint where the Dominion stretches out furthest towards Europe,\r\n{118} and where the maritime provinces furnish open harbours all\r\nthe year round, we find in Nova Scotia and Cape Breton\r\ninexhaustible supplies of excellent coal. The coal areas of this\r\nregion are the only sources: of supply in Eastern America\r\nnorthward of Pennsylvania, and the only sources directly upon\r\nthe eastern coast of the continent, where they seem to give a\r\nsingular advantage for both transatlantic and transcontinental\r\ntrade. Crossing now the 3800 miles which measure the breadth of\r\nthe continent, we come to the Pacific coast, and the excellent\r\nharbours with which it also is everywhere indented. The\r\nimportance to the Empire of these harbours is manifest, since\r\nthey are the only ports under the British flag on the whole\r\nPacific coast of America from Cape Horn to the Behring Sea, the\r\nonly base of naval supply, the only means the Empire has of\r\nmatching the Russian depot, Vladivostock (soon to be in direct\r\nconnection with St. Petersburg itself), over which they have the\r\ngreat advantage of being open all the year round. They furnish\r\nthe base from which the trade of the North Pacific is, and must\r\nbe, protected. For the defence and prosecution of trade, still\r\nmore important than the harbours themselves is the fact that in\r\nthe Island of Vancouver, where Canada stretches out so as to\r\ngive the shortest route to Japan and China, we have again an\r\nabundance of coal. The importance of these deposits is enhanced\r\nby the circumstance that all other coal found on the Pacific\r\ncoast from Cape Horn northward to Puget Sound is of an inferior\r\nquality, {119} and limited in quantity. San Francisco itself\r\nobtains a large part of its coal from Vancouver Island in the\r\nnorth, or from the British colony of New South Wales on the\r\nother side of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLooking East and West, then, the Dominion has its maritime\r\nposition confirmed by its supplies of coal. This is not all.\r\nDeposits extending over thousands of square miles have been\r\ndiscovered midway in the great prairie region, at once solving\r\nthe fuel problem for a treeless country and supplying the force\r\nthat carries trade and population across the continent. Later\r\ndiscoveries in the Rocky Mountains indicate the presence there\r\nof an anthracite coal peculiarly adapted to naval use, and\r\nlikely to supply our ships in the Pacific with fuel of a quality\r\nequal to any that British mines can furnish.\r\n\r\nThe facts of Canada's maritime position thus broadly stated\r\nwill, I think, leave on most minds the impression that should\r\nthe country pass under a foreign flag, so that British ships\r\ncould claim only the rights of aliens in the harbours of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific, or even under an independent flag, when\r\nthey could enjoy only the rights of neutrals, the change would\r\nmean a complete revolution in the conditions under which British\r\ncommerce is protected, and the influence of the nation\r\nmaintained on the two oceans.\r\n\r\nThere is, again, a military as well as a naval aspect from which\r\nto regard Canada's geographical relation to the Empire.\r\n\r\n{120}\r\n\r\nThe energy of the Canadian people has within a few years linked\r\ntogether the Pacific and Atlantic frontages of the Dominion by a\r\ngreat railway system. The new line has the advantage of being\r\nshorter than any other transcontinental route, and crosses the\r\nRocky Mountains at a level 1500 feet below any line further\r\nsouth. The anticipated obstacle of snow blockade in the mountain\r\ndistrict has been effectually overcome; in the Eastern or\r\nIntercolonial section, where alone this difficulty recurs from\r\ndrifting snow, it is being reduced to a minimum. Practically it\r\nnow amounts to the possibility of one or two days' delay twice\r\nor thrice during the winter months, and apparently even this\r\nmight be obviated by the more liberal use of snow-sheds. A\r\nwinter often passes without any obstruction worth mentioning.\r\nThe line is unquestionably the most effective among those which\r\ncross the American continent. It has enabled English letters to\r\nreach Japan in twenty-one days instead of the forty required by\r\nthe old routes. Military authorities pronounce it a valuable\r\naddition to the Empire's means of communication with the East.\r\nIts climatic advantage over the Cape of Good Hope and Suez Canal\r\nroutes at some seasons of the year may yet add strength to its\r\nother recommendations. Compared with these routes it is also the\r\nsafest, since furthest removed from the possibility of European\r\nattack. Of its military efficiency there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt. The manager of the Canada Pacific Railway told me that\r\nhis company had made representations {121} to the Imperial\r\nGovernment that it would undertake to transport men in blocks of\r\n5000 from troop-ships at Halifax to troop-ships at Vancouver\r\nwithin seven days. His statement is justified by the fact that a\r\nsingle train has already carried 600 marines and blue-jackets\r\nwith their officers from the Pacific to the Atlantic within that\r\ntime. Such trains can be indefinitely multiplied. Thus a\r\nsquadron at Vancouver could be reinforced from Portsmouth in\r\nabout a fortnight by this route, a squadron in the China Seas in\r\na little more than three weeks. A fifty days' voyage in the\r\nfirst case by Cape Horn, a forty days' voyage in the latter by\r\nthe Suez Canal, has hitherto been the rule. Such facts\r\nillustrate the greatness of the changes which are taking place\r\nin the conditions of our naval defence. The swift steamships\r\nwhich complete the Eastern connection are constructed for\r\nimmediate transformation in case of necessity into armed\r\ncruisers for the transport of troops and for the protection of\r\nthe commerce which they are themselves creating. Supplemented by\r\nships of a corresponding character on the Atlantic, such a route\r\nmight in a national emergency prove an immense addition to the\r\nmilitary resources of the Empire, and especially for the defence\r\nof India. The mere fact of its existence adds to the nation's\r\nmilitary prestige, and the consequent hesitation of any other\r\npower in making attack.\r\n\r\nA word should be added about Canada's geographical relation to\r\nthe telegraphic system of the {122} Empire. The existing lines\r\nof communication between the United Kingdom and the Australasian\r\ncolonies and India have never yet been tested by the chances of\r\na European war. In all cases they pass over foreign countries or\r\nthrough shallow seas whence they could be easily fished up and\r\ncut. What an entire break of this connection would mean in the\r\ncommercial world may be judged from the fact that even now more\r\nthan a thousand pounds a day are spent on cablegrams between\r\nBritain and the Australasian colonies alone.\r\n\r\nWhat it would mean in the emergencies of war may be left to the\r\nimagination. The panic caused in Australia a few years since by\r\nan accidental break in the line at a time when war with Russia\r\nseemed imminent clearly proved the importance of the question.\r\n\r\nThese considerations sufficiently indicate the immense advantage\r\nand greater security which would come from an alternative route\r\nacross Canada. The case was clearly stated by Mr. Sandford\r\nFleming, the distinguished Canadian engineer, in an address to\r\nthe Colonial Conference of 1887, to which he was a delegate:\r\n'The western terminus of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway--Vancouver--is in telegraphic communication with London.\r\nCommunications have passed between London and Vancouver, and\r\nreplies returned within a few minutes. From Vancouver cables may\r\nbe laid to Australasia by way of Hawaii or they may be laid from\r\none British island to {123} another, and thus bring New Zealand\r\nand all the Australasian colonies directly into telegraphic\r\nconnection with Great Britain, without passing over any soil\r\nwhich is not British, and by passing only through seas as remote\r\nas possible from any difficulties which may arise in Europe.\r\n\r\n'Again, India can be reached from Australasia by the lines of\r\nthe Eastern Telegraphic Company; South Africa can be reached\r\nthrough the medium of the Eastern and South African Company: and\r\nthus, by supplying the one link wanting, the Home Government\r\nwill have the means provided to telegraph to every important\r\nBritish colony and dependency around the circumference of the\r\nglobe, without approaching Europe at any point.'\r\n\r\nThe advantages, commercial and military, of a line of\r\ncommunication thus isolated and national, as compared with those\r\nwhich pass through or near the political storm-centres of\r\nEurope, are too obvious to require elaboration. Since 1887 a\r\nsurvey of this route has been going on, though far too slowly,\r\nunder the direction of the Admiralty; groups of islands useful\r\nfor operating the line have been annexed, and the laying of the\r\ncable seems only to depend on a more general recognition of its\r\nnational necessity.\r\n\r\nWhat has now been said indicates roughly Canada's geographical\r\nrelation to the question of a united oceanic empire, of which\r\nshe may fairly be regarded as the key-stone. What is next to be\r\nconsidered is {124} her relation to the great state which lies\r\nalong her southern border, and which divides with her about\r\nequally the bulk of the North American continent. Here our study\r\nof the map must go hand in hand with the study of Canadian\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nA series of great lakes and rivers, and, for the rest,\r\nastronomical or arbitrary boundary lines, constitute the only\r\ngeographical divisions between the United States and Canada. The\r\npolitical and moral line of separation is due to the fact that\r\nmore than a century ago the colonies which formed the germ of\r\nthe United States revolted and threw off their connection with\r\nGreat Britain; those which formed the nucleus of Canada elected\r\nto remain united with the mother-land and to work out their\r\npolitical destiny in accordance with British institutions.\r\n\r\nThe geographical boundary, like those which divide many other\r\nnations, seems indefinite and artificial to the mere student of\r\nmaps; it has been engraved deeply enough in the hearts of\r\nCanadian people. It had to be defended in 1775, and once more in\r\nthe war of 1812, at much expense of life and treasure. Crossing\r\nit in 1783 and succeeding years, the persecuted Loyalists of the\r\nAmerican Revolution found safety and freedom under the British\r\nflag[1]. Again it {125} had to be defended from the Fenians\r\norganized in 1866 on American soil. Fishing disputes and\r\nboundary disputes, embittered by Canadian dissatisfaction with\r\nthe methods of American diplomacy, have kept attention fixed\r\nupon the line of national demarcation. Still more sharply has it\r\nbeen defined by national habits of thought. South of the line,\r\nfor at least three-quarters of a century after the Revolution,\r\non a thousand fourth of July platforms dislike and hatred of all\r\nthings British have been studiously inculcated. Even now an\r\nappeal to anti-British feeling may decide the fate of a\r\nPresidential election, and has been the winning trick of party\r\npolitics. North of the line, at every public gathering and on\r\nevery public holiday up to the present moment, loyalty to the\r\nBritish nationality for which such sacrifices were made, and\r\nallegiance to institutions which have borne thoroughly the test\r\nof application in a new country, are recognized as of the very\r\nessence of the popular life. The mere suspicion that these\r\nprinciples were being trifled with by a few erratic and\r\nirresponsible members of a great and otherwise perfectly loyal\r\npolitical party has excluded that party from power for a period\r\nalmost beyond the limit of political experience in British\r\ncountries. It is scarcely possible to imagine conditions under\r\nwhich communities kindred in race, language, and {126}\r\nliterature could have had a more decisive and divergent bias\r\ngiven to their history, to national traditions and enthusiasms,\r\nto everything that lies at the roots of individual political\r\nlife. They have prevailed decisively against contiguity, against\r\ncommercial intercourse, social intercourse, literary\r\nintercourse, against a considerable interchange of population.\r\nThose who know best the passions which control the popular mind\r\nin Canada are fixed in the belief that the retention of a\r\npolitical individuality independent of the United States has\r\nbecome the touchstone of Canadian national honour.\r\n\r\nTo understand why this is so we must recall and account for one\r\nprimary fact, remarkable enough in itself and probably unique in\r\nhistory. We can easily understand that it requires no very\r\nmarked natural boundary to form the line of division between\r\nnations which differ in language, religion, and descent, as in\r\nthe case of European states. But in America we see that an\r\nalmost purely artificial line of division has for more than a\r\ncentury been drawn across the breadth of a continent, and\r\nbetween two peoples who speak the same language, study the same\r\nliterature, and are without any decisive distinctions of\r\nreligious creed. There has been a great drawing together between\r\nthe United States and Canada, as between England and Canada,\r\nduring the last twenty-five years, but it is no greater in the\r\none case than the other, and proceeds on social and literary,\r\nnot on political lines. Evidently there {127} is in addition to\r\nthe geographical line some fundamental principle or fact which\r\nseparates the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe same profound national convulsion which gave birth to the\r\nUnited States gave birth to the real life of Canada as well. As\r\nmuch principle and as much self-sacrifice were involved in the\r\nact of the Loyalists who gave to British Canada its peculiar\r\ncharacter as in the struggles of the Revolutionists who founded\r\nthe American Union. For what he believed a great principle, the\r\nRevolutionist broke down an old loyalty, cut his ties with the\r\npast, and engaged in the battle for independence. The Loyalist,\r\non the other hand, with an abiding faith in the institutions of\r\nhis mother-land, not to be shaken by the single mistake of a\r\nking, a minister, or a parliament, elected to stand by the\r\nlosing side, to depend upon constitutional agitation to secure\r\nthe full political liberty he too desired, and so sacrificed his\r\nall to retain his connection with the past, and came to Canada.\r\nNo victory that Britain ever won by land or sea is more worthy\r\nto be blazoned on the pages' of her history than the loyal\r\ndevotion of that great body of men and women, who, refusing to\r\nabjure their ancient allegiance, after the Revolutionary war,\r\ngave up their homes, their professions, and all that made life\r\ncomfortable, crossed over into what was then a forest\r\nwilderness, and built up those Canadian provinces which have\r\nsince grown into a great British confederation.\r\n\r\n{128}\r\n\r\nWho will venture to say that the faith of the Loyalist has not\r\nbeen as fully justified as that of the Revolutionist? American\r\ninstitutions have not developed any higher forms of political or\r\nreligious freedom than those which are found in Canada and in\r\nother colonies of the Empire today under British institutions.\r\nThey have not produced a higher tone of public morals or a\r\ngreater purity of social life. They have not even diminished the\r\nrisk of great national convulsion. They have not made impossible\r\nthe oppression or abuse of inferior races, black, red, or\r\nyellow. They have not rendered statesmanship more noble and\r\nunselfish, justice more incorruptible, human life more sacred,\r\ndomestic ties more holy, the people more God-fearing. I do not\r\nbelieve that there is a Canadian from one end of the Dominion to\r\nthe other who honestly believes that American institutions have\r\nequalled, much less surpassed, his own in anyone of these\r\nparticulars. If these are the things which ennoble a nation--if\r\nthese are marks of true success--the descendants of the\r\nLoyalists have no reason to regret the choice which their\r\nancestors made at the time of the Revolutionary war.\r\n\r\nThe strain under which that choice was made, and the courageous\r\nloyalty which inspired it, have never had the recognition\r\nthroughout the Empire which they deserved. One English\r\nhistorian, however, has done justice to the United Empire\r\nLoyalists. Mr. Lecky says: 'There were brave and honest men\r\n{129} in America; who were proud of the great and free Empire to\r\nwhich they belonged, who had no desire to shrink from the burden\r\nof maintaining it, who remembered with gratitude all the English\r\nblood that had been shed around Quebec and Montreal, and who,\r\nwith nothing to hope for from the Crown, were prepared to face\r\nthe most brutal mob violence, and the invectives of a scurrilous\r\npress, to risk their fortunes, their reputations, and sometimes\r\neven their lives, in order to avert civil war and ultimate\r\nseparation. Most of them ended their days in poverty and exile,\r\nand, as the supporters of a beaten cause, history has paid but a\r\nscanty tribute to their memory, but they comprised some of the\r\nbest and ablest men America has ever produced, and they were\r\ncontending for an ideal which was, at least, as worthy as that\r\nfor which Washington had fought.'\r\n\r\nThat ideal was the conception of a United Empire.\r\n\r\nHow profoundly this great Loyalist tradition, reinforced as it\r\nhas been by many other considerations and circumstances, has\r\naffected Canadian life, can be gauged only by the actual state\r\nof Canadian feeling. Mr. Goldwin Smith has spared no endeavour\r\nto prove that the assimilation of Canadian and American\r\nsentiment is well-nigh complete. Let us, instead of consulting\r\nhis imaginative statements, study the actual and quite recent\r\nexpressions of representative public men and bodies.\r\n\r\nCommencing in Eastern Canada, we find Attorney-General Longley,\r\nof Nova Scotia, a pronounced {130} opponent of the present\r\nDominion Government, who in past times has seemed to approach\r\nvery nearly to the advocacy of annexation, now writing in the\r\n_Fortnightly_ for March, 1891: 'There is still a deep-seated\r\nobjection in the minds of a large majority of the people of\r\nCanada to union with the United States. It may be\r\nunphilosophical, it may be irrational, but it exists. ... It is\r\nnot very easy to blot out a century of history in a day, and the\r\nrecord of the past hundred years has had a constant tendency to\r\nconfirm British Americans in their devotion to British as\r\nagainst American interests. ... It is simply not a practical\r\nsolution of the future of Canada to suggest political union with\r\nthe United States, because the preponderating majority of the\r\npeople will not hear of it. Time is the great miracle worker and\r\nmay change all this; but we must speak of things as they are. No\r\nmaterial considerations will induce the Canadian people at\r\npresent to accept political union with the United States.'\r\n\r\nArchbishop O'Brien, also a Nova Scotian, and the most\r\nrepresentative and influential Roman Catholic of Eastern Canada,\r\nhas in many public utterances expressed his conviction that\r\nannexation to the United States would involve for Canada moral\r\ndamage and political degradation.\r\n\r\nNew Brunswick, out of its sixteen Parliamentary representatives,\r\nhad in the last Parliament one whose attitude was ambiguous,\r\nsince as an editor he seemed to advocate, as a politician he\r\nabjured, the idea of {131} annexation. Journalistic ability of a\r\nhigh order and the fact that he represented a commercial\r\nconstituency having closer trade connection with the New England\r\nports than any other Canadian town made tenable for a time this\r\nanomalous position. A decisive vote in the last election left\r\nhim out of public life, and thus deprived Mr. Goldwin Smith of\r\nperhaps the only illustration of his claim that the advocacy of\r\nannexation does not exclude from the Dominion Parliament.\r\n\r\nPassing on to Quebec we find Mr. Mercier, till lately the local\r\nFrench Canadian leader, hastening to supplement, as he not long\r\nsince did in Paris to a _Times_ correspondent, an expression of\r\nopposition to Imperial Federation by the statement that there is\r\n'no party in Canada ... in favour of annexation to the United\r\nStates.' In Ontario we find Mr. Blake, the strongest man of the\r\nLiberal party, withdrawing from public life because he thought\r\nhe discovered, in the policy of his political friends, a\r\ntendency towards annexation. This, at least, is the\r\ninterpretation which suggests itself to the ordinary reader of\r\nhis published explanation. The repudiation of any desire for\r\nannexation was general, vehement, and doubtless sincere, on the\r\npart of the more conspicuous Liberal leaders against whom it had\r\nbeen charged.\r\n\r\nMr. Mowat, the Liberal Premier of Ontario, has lately written a\r\nletter for publication, in which he says: 'There are in most\r\ncounties a few annexationists, {132} in some counties more than\r\nin others; but the aggregate in the Dominion, I am sure, is\r\nsmall when compared with the aggregate population. The great\r\nmajority of our people, I believe and trust, are not prepared to\r\nhand over this great Dominion to a foreign nation for any\r\npresent commercial consideration which may be proposed. We love\r\nour Sovereign and are proud of our status as British subjects.\r\nThe Imperial authorities have refused nothing in the way of\r\nself-government which our representatives have asked for. ... To\r\nthe United States and its people we are all most friendly. We\r\nrecognize the advantages which would go to both them and us from\r\nextended trade relations, and we are willing to go as far in\r\nthat direction as shall not involve, now or in the future,\r\npolitical union; but there Canadians of every party have\r\nhitherto drawn the line. ... North America is amply large enough\r\nfor two independent nations, and two friendly nations would be\r\nbetter for both populations than one nation embracing the whole\r\ncontinent.' In another formal statement of the policy of the\r\nLiberal party in Canada, Mr. Mowat has said: 'We are as much\r\nattached to our nation as the people of the United States are to\r\ntheirs. The attachment to their nation does our neighbours\r\nhonour, and intelligent men amongst them cannot regard otherwise\r\nour attachment to our nation. As no commercial, or other\r\nmaterial advantage, real or supposed, would induce the people of\r\nthe United States to change their allegiance, so neither, I\r\nhope, {133} will the prospect of some material advantage induce\r\nCanadians to change their allegiance to the Empire. ... For the\r\nLiberal party or any important section of it to favour political\r\nunion with the United States would be death to all hope of\r\nLiberal ascendancy in the Councils of the Dominion.'\r\n\r\nGoing still further West to the prairie regions and British\r\nColumbia, hitherto relied upon by Mr. Goldwin Smith for\r\nproducing a population free from the political traditions and\r\nprejudices of the East, we find a compact vote recorded for a\r\nGovernment which makes the maintenance of British connection the\r\ncorner-stone of its policy, and a chief ground of appeal to the\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\nLastly, we come back to the Dominion Parliament itself. There,\r\nin 1890, Liberal and Conservative, Frenchman and Englishman\r\nalike, by an absolutely unanimous vote, given with the avowed\r\nobject of silencing discussion upon the point, united in\r\ndeclaring their unwavering faith in the advantage for Canada of\r\nits existing national connection. Mr. Smith claims that\r\ngeography is too strong for national sentiment, but these are\r\nthe hard facts which he has to confront in Canada at the end of\r\nmore than a century of her separate existence. Evidence could\r\nscarcely be more conclusive that the main facts are those to\r\nwhich he resolutely shuts his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe expressions which I have given are those of moderate and\r\ndistinctly representative men, but there is a deeper passion\r\nwhich must be taken into account.\r\n\r\n{134}\r\n\r\nCould annexation under any circumstances be effected peacefully\r\nand at the ballot-box? I doubt it. If a day should ever come\r\nwhen a bare majority of Canadians voted for annexation, would\r\nsuch a decision be accepted by the minority? To many it would\r\nmean Revolution and would be treated as such. It must be\r\nremembered that nationality is based on feelings which often lie\r\ntoo deep for mere argument or discussion. In all ages of the\r\nworld it has been a fighting issue, a question on which\r\nminorities yielded only on compulsion. Against mere numbers,\r\nmoreover, intensity of passion and depth of conviction weigh\r\nheavily. I have never heard the question openly discussed, and\r\nexpress an opinion upon it with some diffidence, but to me it\r\nseems certain that only coercion would make a very large and\r\ninfluential section of Canadian population submit to the changes\r\nwhich annexation would involve. And I think such a minority\r\nwould be justified in the eyes of all who place honour and\r\ndevotion to lofty national tradition before material gain.\r\n\r\nLiving close to the United States, Canadians can see many\r\npractical reasons, outside of sentimental ones, why they should\r\nnot commit the fortunes of their country to an alliance with\r\nthose of the great republic. Assuming commercial advantage, the\r\npolitical objections might well seem decisive as a\r\ncounterbalance. The price which the States have to pay for their\r\nwonderful career of prosperity is not yet clear. The amazing\r\nflood of immigration with which {135} it has been attended is\r\nsteadily diluting the Anglo-Saxon element and diminishing the\r\nrelative influence of the native American. A well-known Mayor of\r\nChicago not long since outlined for me the elements of the\r\npopulation over which his municipal rule extended. The analysis\r\nwould form a curious study for those who would forecast the\r\nAmerican type of the next century: A recent event has revealed\r\nthe fact that America's population includes a great mass of\r\nItalians, little in sympathy with the institutions under which\r\nthey live, and reinforced by emigrants who crowd every steamer\r\nthat leaves the Mediterranean to cross the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nI lately heard a representative American writer and thinker in\r\nEngland say that in his judgment the Irish question was becoming\r\na more disturbing factor in American politics and a more\r\ndifficult one to deal with, than it has been for Great Britain.\r\nOf the value of this sincerely held opinion an outsider cannot\r\nperhaps form a just estimate, but we know that a split in\r\nTammany may practically decide a Presidential election, and a\r\nCanadian may fairly think that any problem of race or creed with\r\nwhich he has to deal is not more perplexing.\r\n\r\nThere still remains the race issue in the South. The war of\r\nSecession settled the slavery question: it left the negro\r\nquestion as a dead weight upon the future. Thoughtful Americans\r\nthemselves are among the first to confess that they have not yet\r\nseriously attempted to grapple with it. In the first outburst\r\n{136} of generosity, or as a move in the game of party politics,\r\nthe franchise was given along with liberty, and the result no\r\none as yet foresees. Clearly the country has to face the\r\nprospect of a steadily consolidating zone of black population\r\nstretching far across the continent. Should the Dominion be\r\nannexed to the United States all the voting weight of Canada\r\nwithin the union would for a generation to come scarcely balance\r\nthis single negro element of America's population, supposing\r\nthat, in accordance with Canadian ideas of political justice,\r\nthe negroes should be allowed (as they are not now) to exercise\r\ntheir legal right.\r\n\r\nThe violence and insecurity of life which have marked the\r\nsettlement of the West, and still prevail over whole States in\r\nthe South, are unknown in Canada. People ask why lynch law, as\r\nlittle known in new British countries like Canada, New Zealand,\r\nAustralia, and South Africa, as it is in Britain itself, is\r\nstill a common phenomenon in the administration of American\r\njustice. Canada has managed a large Indian population with\r\nlittle serious difficulty; her neighbours during the same years\r\nhave been engaged in a series of wars of extermination,\r\napparently the outcome for the most part of maladministration in\r\nIndian affairs. The confusion of marriage and divorce laws\r\nthroughout the various states has become a serious evil, for\r\nwhich no remedy has yet been devised. If Canadians have\r\nsometimes to wrestle with political corruption, they at least do\r\nso resolutely and {137} effectively, while there is a widespread\r\nbelief that among their neighbours it is a permanent and\r\naccepted factor in party government.\r\n\r\nThese points are not dwelt upon in a spirit of petty criticism,\r\nbut it seems fair to mention them as facts which influence\r\npowerfully Canadian judgment in forming an opinion on the\r\ncomparative merits of the political systems which they see\r\nworking side by side.\r\n\r\nOne other consideration beyond that of commercial advantage has\r\noften been thrust upon Canadians as a reason why they should\r\nseek annexation. They are told that so long as they remain\r\npolitically connected with Britain they will be exposed to the\r\nchances of war with the United States, since the Dominion would\r\nnaturally be made the first point of attack should differences\r\narise between the two countries. It is urged that resistance to\r\nsuch an attack would be useless and absurd, and that Canada's\r\nonly guarantee of safety from future subjugation and the\r\nmilitary occupation of the country is to form as quickly as she\r\ncan and on the best terms she can, a civil union with the power\r\nthat thus threatens her.\r\n\r\nIf the appeal to mere commercial advantage seemed mercenary,\r\nthis appeal to cowardice seems base. Certainly it is one which\r\nhas never made any impression on the Canadian mind. Perhaps this\r\nis mere recklessness. It might be argued, however, that 4000\r\nmiles of frontier are as perplexing for attack as for defence.\r\nCanadians remember that in 1812 they successfully faced a\r\ncorresponding danger when the odds were as {138} much against\r\nthem, and numbers as disproportionate, as they are today. They\r\nremember that to crush the Southern States, fighting without\r\noutside help, required the most expensive and destructive war of\r\nmodern times, prolonged over renewed campaigns. They know at any\r\nrate that the task of subduing them is one which would not be\r\nlightly undertaken. But picture the worst that such a war could\r\nbring: defeat, military occupation, complete subjugation. If war\r\nbetween Britain and the United States be, as is claimed, a\r\npossibility of the future, would not each and all of these be\r\nfor Canadians infinitely preferable to placing themselves in\r\nsuch a position that; having abandoned a country which they\r\nloved and joined themselves to a country which they feared, they\r\nwould by that act be pledged to use their arms, their means,\r\ntheir collective forces as a people, against the land that gave\r\nthem birth, that had extended over them the strong shield of her\r\nprotection through a hundred years of struggling infancy, and\r\nhad freely given them the best she had to give of perfect\r\nfreedom and noble institutions?\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that this argument alone is quite sufficient to\r\nmake annexation to the United States a moral impossibility for\r\nthe Canadian people. They may join heartily in every process by\r\nwhich their mother-land and the great republic are drawn more\r\nclosely together; they may even be in no small degree the link\r\nwhich binds them together in friendly feeling. But to expose\r\nthemselves to the possibility of hostile {139} conflict with\r\nthat mother-land for the sake of a temporary commercial\r\nadvantage or from motives of cowardice would make them incur the\r\ncontempt of the people they leave and the contempt of the people\r\nthey join. In the long run it may be taken for granted that the\r\npath of commercial and every other prosperity will be found\r\nalong the path of national honour. That national honour is\r\nlooked upon as the issue at stake there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nIn considering more closely the question of commercial advantage\r\nit may in the outset be remarked that no truly noble individual\r\nlife, much less any truly noble national life, was ever yet\r\nbuilt up on principles and purposes entirely mercenary. The\r\nlandmarks in history to which the human heart everywhere turns\r\nwith a thrill of instinctive pride are the periods when nations\r\nhave forgotten, for a time, self-interest and the love of gain,\r\nand in the glow of patriotic enthusiasm have made great\r\nsacrifices from motives of principle, affection, honour, and\r\nloyalty, British Canada owes its foundation to such an outburst\r\nof lofty spirit. The United States themselves were founded, as a\r\nnation, upon what seemed at the time an utter defiance of\r\ncommercial advantage, and the heroic periods of that country, as\r\nof every other, the periods which gave birth to all that is\r\nnoblest and purest in it, were not the times of its wealth and\r\nluxury, but the times of its self-denial, suffering, effort, and\r\nsacrifice. Prosperity must be an incident of noble national\r\nlife; not the sole foundation on which it is built.\r\n\r\n{140}\r\n\r\nAgain, while it would be absurd to undervalue material\r\nprosperity, we must constantly remember that its highest value\r\nconsists as much in the discipline of the powers required for\r\nits acquisition as in the acquisition or possession itself. This\r\nmust be as true of nations as daily experience shows it to be in\r\nthe case of individuals. When Canadians are told that they must\r\nlook to political union with the United States for any increase\r\nof commercial prosperity, and that such a connection will at\r\nonce draw them into a tide of greater business energy, I cannot\r\nbut think that a prosperity purchased by such means is obtained\r\nby the sacrifice of that which gives prosperity its greatest\r\nworth. Speaking as a Canadian to Canadian audiences, I have\r\nsometimes put the argument in this way: 'We have a country with\r\nenormous capacity for development. The field is large enough and\r\nvaried enough to satisfy the greatest energy and every form of\r\nit. The consolidation of a national strength, the linking\r\ntogether of our widespread provinces by railway systems, the\r\nopening up of our great North-West, seem to have removed the\r\nchief obstacles which have hitherto stood in our way. Under such\r\ncircumstances, or under any circumstances, would it not be\r\ninfinitely more worthy of us, would it not be a far better\r\nnational training and discipline, to set ourselves resolutely to\r\nwork to supply that in which we are deficient, rather than to\r\nseek it ignominiously at the hands of our neighbours? Can it be\r\ntrue that we have not the strength of brain or hand to wrest\r\nfrom nature the {141} success and prosperity which others have\r\nwon? If we have not, then let us not add to our weakness a\r\nspirit of mean dependence.'\r\n\r\nLooking at the question under aspects such as these, I find it\r\nimpossible to conceive that Canadians, who have for more than a\r\ncentury received their national impulse and development from a\r\npolitical system which they believe the best in the world, for\r\nwhich they have continued to profess the most devoted regard,\r\nand to which they are tied by a thousand bonds of affectionate\r\nsympathy, will deliberately, in cold blood, and for commercial\r\nreasons only, dissolve that connection, and join themselves to a\r\nstate with the history and traditions of which they have little\r\nsympathy, and to whose form of government they object. To take\r\nsuch a course would indicate an extraordinary degradation of\r\npublic sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, I am told that geography and commercial\r\ntendencies are strong, I can only reply that the bias of\r\nnational life and loyalty to the spiritual forces which give a\r\npeople birth are stronger still. A sensitive regard for public\r\nhonour is infinitely stronger.\r\n\r\nBut even the question of commercial advantage has two aspects.\r\n\r\nComparing the relative advantages of the United States and the\r\nBritish Empire we find that with the former lies that of\r\ncontinental isolation--a position so secure, peopled as the\r\ncountry now is, that no external power could hope to shake it.\r\nAttack might be annoying and detrimental, but by no means fatal,\r\n{142} for the chief dependence of the country is not upon\r\nexternal trade. Even a blockade of all its ports would stimulate\r\ninternal activity, for the United States are almost\r\nself-sufficing in the matter of production, and manufacturing\r\nindustry would have the whole union entirely to itself. A very\r\nremarkable and advantageous position we must admit this to be,\r\nfreeing the country from external dangers to which other nations\r\nare subject, and so leaving it in a better position to grapple\r\nwith those vast internal problems of race and colour which\r\nconfront it.\r\n\r\nVery different indeed is the advantage which Britain enjoys. She\r\nhas, however, no reason to envy the great Republic. Instead of\r\ncontinental compactness she has world-wide diffusion--precisely\r\nthat kind of diffusion which satisfies the necessities of\r\ncountries which depend, and must always to a considerable degree\r\ndepend, upon external trade. It would be too much perhaps to say\r\nthat at the present moment the British Empire possesses the same\r\nsecurity on the ocean that the United States have on their\r\ncontinent, but it is not too much to affirm that with her\r\ncommand of the strongest maritime positions of the world, her\r\nbacking of vigorous and growing populations, and her resources\r\nin money and trained men for naval equipment, she could soon\r\nbecome so. This is the kind of security which Britain requires\r\nwith her vast outflow of merchandise--her inflow of food and raw\r\nmaterial. It is the kind of security needed by countries like\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, or South {143} Africa, which have an\r\nenormous export of special products for which the character of\r\nthe country is specially adapted. If no question of national\r\nhonour were involved, and if Canada had to make a choice purely\r\nupon grounds of national security between what is offered to her\r\nfrom connection with the United States and with the Empire, the\r\ndecision would depend upon whether she aspired to great\r\ncommercial connections or would be content with merely\r\ncontinental relations. It is certain that if the United States\r\never regain control of their own carrying trade, or if by the\r\ndevelopment of manufacturing energy they are led to look largely\r\nto outside markets, they will feel more and more the limitations\r\nimposed by a purely continental position. Canada has at the\r\npresent time large maritime interests. Her great length of sea\r\ncoast, the productive fisheries east and, west, the facility for\r\nship-building given by her forests, have stimulated her maritime\r\nactivity to such an extent that in tonnage of shipping she now\r\nranks fourth among the nations of the world, counting the United\r\nKingdom as one. Her sailing ships are found in every quarter of\r\nthe world, taking part in the carrying trade. Several great\r\nsteam-ship lines cross the Atlantic, another connects the\r\nPacific coast with Japan and China--a line is projected to\r\nAustralasia--others carry on trade with the eastern and western\r\ncoasts of America and with the West Indies. The instincts and\r\nconditions which have made British people a maritime and trading\r\nrace are renewed in {144} the Dominion. Canada's interest is to\r\nretain the national connection which gives her commerce the best\r\nopportunities, her fleets the surest protection in all parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian shipmaster or trader knows that at ports all over\r\nthe world, at Hong Kong and Calcutta, at Malta or Melbourne, at\r\nthe Cape or Auckland, in a word, at all the great centres of the\r\nworld's ocean commerce, he can claim the protection of the\r\nnational flag, he has a right to apply to the British consul, he\r\ncan rely on the prestige of the British name. These are rights\r\nof which the Canadian knows the value. They are rights which he\r\nis not likely to relinquish, for they have been honestly won,\r\nfirst by retaining his allegiance at the price of much sacrifice\r\nin the revolution of 1776, and then by steady persistence in\r\nthat allegiance at all costs through more than a century. He\r\nknows they are rights that no other nation can give him in equal\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nIt is in trade relations, however, that Canada's interest is\r\nsupposed to look away from Great Britain or the rest of the\r\nEmpire, and towards the United States. Twenty years ago the\r\nAmerican Republic entered upon its policy of excluding as far as\r\npossible the products of other countries, and among them those\r\nof Canada, by a high protective tariff. That policy has been\r\nsteadily maintained until it has reached a climax in the\r\nMcKinley tariff. It had previously forced a protective policy\r\nupon Canada itself. It seems clear that the Dominion has\r\nsuffered {145} to some extent commercially by this exclusion\r\nfrom the markets of her own continent, by the resolute\r\ndetermination of their neighbours that Canadians shall not, as\r\nCanadians, have any share in the prosperity of the United\r\nStates. That she has gained in energy, self-reliance, and\r\nnational purpose is equally clear to anyone who attempts to\r\nmeasure the splendid and successful efforts which she has since\r\nconfederation and under this exclusion made at self-development.\r\nThat the moral gain infinitely outweighs the commercial loss, I,\r\nfor one, firmly believe. But there are those who argue that for\r\nthe commercial advantage which it is anticipated would flow from\r\nunion with the United States, the continental independence of\r\nthe country, its historical traditions, its political\r\ninstitutions, its nationality, should be abandoned. In Great\r\nBritain itself there are found many who assume as a matter of\r\ncourse that commercial attraction will inevitably lead to the\r\npolitical absorption of the Dominion into the United States. I\r\nbelieve that the opinion is a mistaken one. The grounds upon\r\nwhich it is based deserve examination. Let it be remembered that\r\nno one now ventures to bring forward in support of this\r\nproposition any argument based on the superior freedom or\r\nexcellence of American institutions, social or political. The\r\nday for that is past. We can assert, without fear of\r\ncontradiction, that the condition of the self-governing colonies\r\nof Britain finds no parallel in the world in making government\r\nan immediate reflection of the {146} popular will, and so in\r\ngiving the utmost possible freedom and weight of influence to\r\nthe individual citizen. When Lord Dufferin told an American\r\naudience at Chicago that Canadians would not breathe freely in a\r\ncountry where the Executive was placed for years together beyond\r\nthe reach of the popular will, and was not under the constant\r\nsupervision of the Legislative bodies, he indicated a vital\r\ndifference which distinguishes the form of popular government in\r\nBritish countries from the American system, a difference which\r\ncolonists think is all in favour of the former. If the\r\ngovernment of any self-ruling dependency of England is bad, the\r\nfault lies in the character of the constituency, not in the form\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nThe question, then, is purely one of commercial advantage, a\r\ncertain supposed and possibly temporary per-centage of trade\r\ngain which Canadians would secure by abjuring their national\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nGrounds are not wanting for the belief that the inevitable\r\ntendency of several very great trade interests of Canada is more\r\ntowards Great Britain and some of the British dependencies than\r\ntowards the United States. From their position and physical\r\ncharacter Canada and the United States must in many ways be\r\nrival producers. Both are great grain and cattle raising\r\ncountries. Both wish their surplus of agricultural productions\r\nto reach the consuming millions of the old world, or the\r\ntropical countries like the West Indies where they may be\r\nexchanged for articles of {147} use or luxury. Certain it is\r\nthat the United States now export to Great Britain many millions\r\nof pounds' worth of those very products which Canada sends in\r\nsmaller quantities to the States. Such a fact scarcely bears out\r\nthe assertion that the United States furnish the natural market\r\nof Canada. It rather suggests that better organization for\r\ntransport and greater commercial enterprize would make the\r\nEnglish market the more valuable of the two for Canada.\r\n\r\nBut while urging this view of ultimate trade tendencies there is\r\nno need to underestimate the present advantage and convenience\r\nwhich Canada would derive from the freest possible access to\r\nAmerican markets. These may be at once admitted, the only\r\nqualification being that Canada cannot afford to purchase\r\nadvantage and convenience at the price of national dishonour or\r\nhumiliation. Let us remember, however, that advantage and\r\nconvenience are not confined to one side.\r\n\r\nIt is already true, it is becoming increasingly true, that the\r\nUnited States must have Canadian products. They leap over even\r\nthe barrier of a McKinley tariff. American forests are nearly\r\nexhausted--those of Canada are not only still of immense extent,\r\nbut practically inexhaustible, since nature has reserved by\r\nconditions of soil and climate, large areas exclusively for the\r\ngrowth of trees. Canadian waters have well nigh a monopoly of\r\nthe best fish of the American continent. From Nova Scotia\r\nnorthward gulf and bay swarm with fish which pour downwards\r\n{148} from the cold Arctic regions in numbers that never fail,\r\nand of the best quality. The lakes and rivers of the north-west\r\nmight well supply the whole of the centre of the continent with\r\nfresh-water fish. On the Pacific the Canadian monopoly is not so\r\ncomplete since the purchase of Alaska by the United States, but\r\nthe fisheries of British Columbia have a great future. On the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts and in the inland prairie region\r\nCanada can supply coal in abundance to regions in the United\r\nStates without deposits of their own. American brewers find it\r\nnecessary to have Canadian barley, and are earnestly petitioning\r\nCongress to reduce the duty from thirty to the old rate of ten\r\ncents per bushel. So too with farm produce of other kinds.\r\nAmerican consumers now pay a higher price for the eggs and\r\npoultry once drawn from Canada but driven by the McKinley tariff\r\nto seek new, and as it turns out, fairly satisfactory markets in\r\nGreat Britain. That tariff must inevitably result in a largely\r\nincreased development of manufacturing industry, a closer\r\npressure of consumption upon producing power in the matter of\r\nfood in the United States, and a consequent increase in the\r\ndemand, already very noticeable in New England towns, for easy\r\naccess to Canadian supplies. The freedom of the markets of the\r\ncontinent is likely ere long to be a stronger election cry in\r\nthe United States than it has been in the Dominion[2].\r\n\r\n{149}\r\n\r\nSomething ought perhaps to be said in reference to the part\r\nwhich Canada seems likely to take in supplying food to the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The area of wheat production has shifted rapidly\r\non the American continent, first westward from New York State to\r\nOhio, Illinois, and Iowa, then northward to Wisconsin,\r\nMinnesota, and Dakota. Till within a few years past these\r\nnorthern states of the Union were supposed to mark the limit of\r\nsuccessful wheat cultivation. Actual experience has now proved\r\nthat it is several hundreds of miles further north, and that in\r\nCanadian territory is included the largest and richest\r\nundeveloped wheat area in the world. Allowance must be made for\r\noccasional early frosts, which are, {150} however, not so\r\ndisastrous as Indian or Australian droughts, and may apparently\r\nbe successfully combated by fall ploughing and early sowing.\r\nWhen this allowance is made, it seems clearly proved that in\r\nboth quantity and quality the north-western provinces and\r\nterritories of Canada will soon take a leading place in grain\r\nsupply. The railway, which opened up the country to settlement,\r\nwas completed in 1885. Yet in 1887 the districts which it\r\nreached, with but a scattered population, yielded 12,000,000\r\nbushels of surplus wheat; in 1890, 16,000,000 bushels; and the\r\nestimate for 1891 is 21,000,000 bushels. Eight times this\r\nquantity would supply the whole British demand. At the present\r\naverage of production 100,000 farmers thrown into the\r\nnorth-west, which {151} is capable of absorbing many hundreds of\r\nthousands, would raise all the wheat that now comes into the\r\nUnited Kingdom. Statisticians are already forecasting the date\r\nwhen the growth of population, going on side by side with the\r\nexhaustion of the more fertile prairie lands in the United\r\nStates, will equalize production and consumption in that\r\ncountry, and leave it unable to furnish the supplies on which\r\nBritain has hitherto so largely depended. Speaking to a\r\nYorkshire audience not long since, Sir Lyon Playfair suggested\r\ntwenty years hence as the probable period to the time when\r\nEngland could expect to draw wheat supplies from the United\r\nStates, after which she would have to depend on Canada, India,\r\nand other countries chiefly within the Empire. On the same\r\nquestion Mr. Bryce, in speaking of the United States, says:\r\n'High economic authorities pronounce that the beginnings of this\r\ntime of pressure lie not more than thirty years ahead. Nearly\r\nall the best arable land of the West is already occupied, so\r\nthat the second and third best will soon begin to be cultivated;\r\nwhile the exhaustion already complained of in farms which have\r\nbeen under the plough for three or four decades will be\r\nincreasingly felt.' Like opinions have been expressed by\r\nAmerican writers. Whatever may be thought about the precise\r\npoint of time, the tendency is manifest. Within a measurable\r\ntime the Empire will, by the natural progress of events, mainly\r\nsupply its own markets with wheat, and, it may be added, with\r\nits second most important article of consumption {152} meat. The\r\nargument which I have used in another place, pointing to the\r\nadvantage and greater security for both producer and consumer,\r\nof having so far as possible the areas which furnish the raw\r\nmaterial of manufacture under the protection of the national\r\nflag, applies with equal, if not greater force, to food supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 'Mob violence and many forms of injustice, made life almost\r\nintolerable for them in their homes, and emigration to British\r\nterritory took place on a scale which has been hardly paralleled\r\nsince the Huguenots. It has been estimated, apparently on good\r\nauthority, that in the two provinces of Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick alone, the Loyalist emigrants and their families\r\namounted to not less than 35,000 persons, and the total number\r\nof refugees cannot have been much less than 100,000.--Jones'\r\n'History of New York,' ii. 259, 268, 500, 509. An American\r\nauthority quoted by Mr. Lecky.\r\n\r\n[2] Since writing the above I have found the case thus put from\r\nthe United States point of view in the _North American Review_\r\nfor August, 1890:--'The exhaustion of the forests of Maine, the\r\ndisappearance of the forests in the Saginaw valley, and the\r\nutter disregard for the future by which the policy of protection\r\nhas stimulated the policy of destruction, will in a quarter of a\r\ncentury result in denuding vast areas of the United States of\r\nthe timber supply available within reasonable reach of its great\r\npoints of demand. All the industries dependent upon timber, if\r\nthey are to grow in the next twenty years, will need new\r\nresources for the supply of the raw material. Whence can these\r\nbe obtained except from the portion of the continent outside of\r\nthe United States? ...When one recalls the vast stretches of\r\ntreeless prairies within the United States, in which shelter\r\nmust be provided, the necessities and exhaustion of rainless\r\nregions resulting from the destruction of forests, and the rapid\r\ngrowth of vast cities on the lakes and plains, and also the fact\r\nthat from the northern part of the continent above is a supply\r\nof timber certain for all future time, the necessity for the\r\nextension of commerce so as to include these areas is apparent.\r\n...\r\n\r\n'The exhaustion of wheat lands is a consideration of the most\r\nvital importance in relation to the future supply of the food of\r\nthis continent. It is a startling fact, not yet fully realized\r\nby the people of this country, that at the present rate of\r\nprocedure the United States may be a large importer of\r\nbreadstuffs. The growth of population is so rapid, the\r\nexhaustion of arable land so constant, that without new and\r\ncultivable territory the sources for the supply of food products\r\nwill soon be below the local demand. ... When it is recalled\r\nthat the best wheat-producing region of the world is found just\r\nnorth of the Minnesota line, and that in the new provinces and\r\nterritories of the Canadian north-west there is a possible\r\nwheat-supply for all time, it will be seen how important has\r\nbeen the provision of nature for the food of mankind.'\r\n\r\nAnd again:-' Cheap food for New England is the necessity of the\r\nhour in that region. ... In the Maritime Provinces are abundant\r\nsources of food supply. No other country in the world can\r\nproduce potatoes, apples, oats, hay, poultry, dairy produce,\r\nand, still more important, the finest fish food, equal to Nova\r\nScotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. ... In the\r\nunlimited supply of cheap raw material from Canada, in the\r\nunrestricted output of fish and food products, and the constant\r\nemployment of cheap labour from the north, the new hope of New\r\nEngland may be found. Without these her manufacturing prospects\r\nare gloomy indeed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{153}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFRENCH CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA has had a two-fold history: French and English. The two\r\nelements of the population have not amalgamated to any\r\nappreciable extent, the hindrance arising from religion rather\r\nthan race. We have then today a French-speaking Canada and an\r\nEnglish-speaking Canada. It is important to keep in the mind a\r\nclear idea of the proportion of the one to the other. The\r\ntendency of the French population to remain concentrated in a\r\nsingle province or its immediate neighbourhood, (I do not forget\r\nthe Acadian French, but they cannot seriously affect the\r\nposition), makes it easy to indicate this proportion, and its\r\nfluctuation. In 1759 Quebec was Canada--a Canada entirely French\r\nand Roman Catholic. In 1791 Ontario was set off as a separate\r\nprovince, and within fifty years was of itself equal to the\r\nFrench province in population and superior in wealth. Today\r\nQuebec is the only French-speaking province among the seven\r\nwhich make up the Confederation. An overflow into a few of the\r\nborder counties of Ontario, a limited and {154} scattered\r\nmigration to the north-west, mark the only further expansion of\r\nthe French population over new areas in Canada. A considerable\r\nmigration to New England, where the Quebec peasant becomes a\r\nfactory operative, is interesting, because it shows that he\r\nresists amalgamation in the United States as steadily as in\r\nCanada. Quebec then, still represents French Canada. It has a\r\npopulation of 1,500,000, of whom 1,200,000 are French. It should\r\nbe added that the wealth and influence of the great and growing\r\ncity of Montreal are in the hands of the English minority, as\r\nwere the wealth and influence of the city of Quebec in its days\r\nof greatest prosperity. A certain unprogressive spirit hampers\r\nthe Frenchman, and gives a striking commercial and industrial\r\nadvantage to the English population. Perhaps this contrast may\r\nin part be explained by the fact that the conquest of 1759 was\r\nfollowed by the return to France of a small, but intellectually\r\nand commercially important element of French Canadian society,\r\nwhile the English population was reinforced a few years later by\r\nan influx of loyalist energy and ability.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, therefore, the French of Canada stand to the\r\nwhole people as, at the most, a million and a half to five\r\nmillions. The many provinces which are still to be carved out of\r\nthe north-west will be English speaking. It is true that the\r\nFrench _habitans_ have large families, and the natural increase\r\nof the race is somewhat greater than that of British colonists,\r\nbut on the other hand the whole inflow of immigration increases\r\n{155} the weight of the English-speaking provinces; the outflow\r\nto New England lessens that of Quebec. The relative influence\r\nand numbers of the French element in Canada will never be\r\ngreater than they are at present, but rather less, partly owing,\r\nas I have said, to the formation of new provinces, but even more\r\nto the hesitation of French Canadians to follow the advice of\r\ntheir wiser leaders like Mr. Laurier, and throw themselves more\r\nentirely than they have hitherto done into the tide of\r\nAnglo-Saxon movement on the continent. More than one historian\r\nhas pointed out that the efforts of French kings and ministers\r\nto make Quebec a preserve for a single set of ideas paralyzed\r\nthe energies of the colonists in early days. There seems to me\r\nto be a like danger now, arising from similar causes, that it\r\nmay become the less energetic community of a strenuously\r\nprogressive continent. But it can never dominate Canadian\r\ndevelopment, or permanently block the general movement of the\r\nDominion in any given direction.\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view French Canada today represents one of\r\nthe most interesting triumphs of British constitutional\r\ngovernment. When the Province of Quebec came under British\r\ndominion in 1763, it had never known what free government by the\r\npeople meant. Governors and Intendants, with almost despotic\r\npower, or taking their orders even in minute detail from a\r\nFrench king or minister in Paris, left no room for popular\r\ncontrol. Striking indeed was the contrast which the province\r\npresented to the {156} English colonies further south, which\r\nfrom their very foundation began to organize a system of local\r\nself-government. In Quebec the beginnings of self-government had\r\nstill to be made after 1763, or, rather, after 1774, the date of\r\nthe Quebec Act. Yet the remark of Montalembert, that the\r\nFrenchman in Canada under British institutions has attained a\r\nliberty which the Frenchman of France never knew, is in strict\r\naccord with fact. France, which seems to have wasted few regrets\r\non a colony which had always been poor and a drain upon her\r\nresources, plunged into all the horrors of the Revolution to win\r\na liberty which after all for more than a century has wavered\r\nbetween name and reality. The people of her surrendered colony,\r\ncarrying on, along with the British provinces, the agitation for\r\nresponsible government by methods entirely constitutional, save\r\nfor the slight outbreak of 1837, have gained and continue in the\r\nsecure enjoyment of a popular freedom as complete as that of any\r\ncountry in the world; a recognition for their religion such as\r\nthat religion cannot command in France. Between the European\r\nFrenchman, moreover, and the French Canadian is the barrier\r\nraised by the Revolution. Modern France does not send emigrants\r\nto Quebec, where, indeed, they would scarcely be welcome. The\r\ntypical French republican, with his atheism, his free life, and\r\nhis contempt for religious forms, would be curiously out of\r\nplace in the average French Canadian community, devout, moral,\r\nand conservative. He would, indeed, run no slight risk of {157}\r\nbeing boycotted by clerical orders. The sentimental tie with\r\nFrance or race and language remains, and to the honour of French\r\nCanadians be it said, is fondly cherished, though it is not\r\nsustained by that constant intercourse and hearty literary\r\nsympathy which so bind the English world together. The reasoned\r\npolitical allegiance of the people goes out to the British\r\nconnection, which gives steadiness to their public and security\r\nto their religious life.\r\n\r\nOnce more, French Canadians have profound objections to\r\nannexation to the United States. They go in numbers to work in\r\nthe mills and factories of New England, or in the forests of\r\nMichigan or Maine for a few months or a few years, forming a\r\nlarge proportion of the so-called exodus, but those who become\r\nnaturalized American citizens have hitherto been an unimportant\r\nfraction of the whole. Many return, the movement to and fro\r\nbeing continuous. Those who stay form more or less distinct\r\ncommunities of their own, to which cohesion is given by the\r\ncuré, who follows to supply the ministrations of their religion.\r\nThe simple loyalty of the habitant to his Canadian home and to\r\nhis religion is no slight offset to his narrowness of political\r\noutlook and his somewhat unprogressive habit of mind. It made\r\nhim fight against American aggression in 1774; it added a bright\r\npage to Canadian history by the heroic part taken in the war of\r\n1812, when 400 French Canadians under de Salaberry defeated at\r\nChateauguay an army {158} of 3000 Americans. Happily we need not\r\nnow think of like aggression, but should danger ever again\r\nthreaten Canada, there are the strongest reasons to believe that\r\nthe Frenchman even of the United States would soon find his\r\nplace beside his compatriot in the old home, fighting for the\r\nland he loves with a passionate affection.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural that, with race, language, and religion on\r\nthe one side, and on the other a heritage of free political\r\ninstitutions giving security to all of these, we should find\r\nfluctuations of expression among an excitable people in regard\r\nto national attachment. On the whole, however, the steadiness of\r\nFrench Canadian loyalty to British institutions is remarkable.\r\nCardinal Manning told me in 1886 that French Canadian bishops\r\nand clergy had over and over again assured him that their people\r\nwere practically a unit in preferring British to French, or any\r\nother connection, and since that time the pastoral addresses of\r\nthe highest ecclesiastics have more than once confirmed this\r\nstatement in explicit terms.\r\n\r\nSir George Cartier described himself as an Englishman speaking\r\nFrench, and he no doubt meant it as a sincere indication of the\r\ndrift of French Canadian thought. When a conspicuous French\r\npolitician--not a Conservative--told me in Ottawa three years\r\nsince that he would not be afraid to stand on any platform in\r\nQuebec and affirm that, in the event of war between France and\r\nEngland, other things being equal, four French Canadians out of\r\nevery five would not only {159} sympathize with, but prefer to\r\nfight for England, the energy of the statement was a surprise to\r\nme; but I have no reason to doubt the speaker's sincerity. The\r\nabsolute truth of the statement cannot be questioned, if the\r\nsupposed contest involved the substitution in Quebec of\r\nanti-religious French Republicanism, which the French Canadian\r\nhates, for the tolerant system of Britain. Looking back upon all\r\nthat has happened in France since 1789, looking even at the\r\ncondition of the Republic today and its attitude towards\r\nreligion, the French Canadian may, and, it may be added, often\r\ndoes, sincerely echo the thought of the brilliant historian of\r\nthe French occupation of America when he says that 'a happier\r\ncalamity never befell a people than the conquest of Canada by\r\nthe British arms.'\r\n\r\nIn criticism of what has so far been said of French Canada it\r\nwill no doubt be replied that Mr. Mercier, the late leader of\r\nthe French Nationalist party in Quebec, has taken occasion to\r\ndenounce the proposal to work out some scheme of British unity,\r\nand has pointed to independence as, in his opinion, the ideal\r\nfuture for Canada. No doubt Mr. Mercier was for a time able to\r\nintroduce new features into the political life of Quebec, but\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that he broke down even for a\r\nmoment the traditional policy of his people, who have long\r\nlooked upon their British connection as the chief safeguard for\r\nthe rights which they most value. The exposure of Mr. Mercier's\r\npolitical methods and the collapse of his system make {160} it\r\nperhaps unnecessary to discuss his views on national affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Laurier, the exceedingly able and fair minded leader of the\r\nopposition in the Canadian Parliament, is described in 'The\r\nProblems of Greater Britain,' as 'more or less in favour of'\r\nImperial Federation. He has lately, probably under the pressure\r\nof political events in the Dominion, expressed the opinion that\r\nindependence, rather than Federation with the Empire, was the\r\nmore desirable end of Canadian development, basing his argument\r\nchiefly upon the idea that Canada would, in a federated empire,\r\nbe drawn into European wars. I have dealt with this objection in\r\nanother place. Mr. Laurier is devoted to the honour and the\r\ninterest of Canada, and it may be taken for granted that if\r\nthese can be proved to coincide with the honour and interest of\r\nthe Empire, any difficulty which he sees in British unity would\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nIt will be admitted that the experience of Sir John Macdonald in\r\ndealing with the French Canadian people, and his knowledge of\r\nFrench Canadian sentiment towards the Empire and the Dominion\r\nwere unique. As a statesman he had every reason to consider and\r\nconciliate the French vote, by which his parliamentary majority\r\nwas in part maintained throughout his career. Yet he never saw\r\nin French Canadian feeling any bar to a united Empire. In 1889,\r\nat a time when certain Quebec politicians, and even members of\r\nhis own Cabinet, were declaiming {161} rather vigorously against\r\nthe idea of Imperial Federation, I had an opportunity of asking\r\nhis opinion as to the ultimate attitude which Quebec was likely\r\nto take towards the question. His reply, given without reserve\r\nor hesitation, was marked by a decision which was manifestly the\r\noutcome of much thought upon the question. I try to reproduce\r\nthis opinion, not so much to attach to it the weight of his\r\ngreat name, as because it bears upon the face of it the\r\nrecommendation of reason and truth. 'The relation of Quebec\r\ntowards the Empire is fixed,' said he, 'by the facts of history\r\nand the aspirations of the people themselves. The controlling\r\nidea of the French Canadian is to retain his language, religion\r\nand civil institutions, necessarily held under a critical tenure\r\non a continent in the main Anglo-Saxon. But he has in the treaty\r\nof 1763 and the Quebec Act founded upon it a Magna Charta as\r\ndear to him as is to an Englishman that won from King John. By\r\nthat treaty the honour of England was pledged to France that the\r\nFrenchmen of Quebec who then became British subjects should be\r\ncontinued in the enjoyment of their religious and civil\r\ninstitutions. In annexation to the United States or in Canadian\r\nindependence this guarantee would be given up. In the Great\r\nRepublic the French Canadian would run the risk of being blotted\r\nout as was the Frenchman of Louisiana. In an independent Canada\r\nhe would hold his own with difficulty. He must in the long run\r\nvote to follow the Empire in whatever {162} direction its\r\ndevelopment may lead. This condition is permanent; all others\r\nare temporary. The interest of the French Canadian will lie in\r\nresisting separation, whether in the direction of independence\r\nor annexation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{163}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMR. GOLDWIN SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo discussion of the relation of Canada to the Empire, much less\r\nany more general discussion of British unity, would be complete\r\nwhich omits special reference to Mr. Goldwin Smith and the views\r\non national questions which he has for many years persistently\r\nand strenuously advocated. To these views he has challenged\r\nattention anew in his latest volume, _Canada and the Canadian\r\nQuestion_, which may fairly be supposed to condense all that can\r\nbe said in favour of the separation of Canada from the Empire,\r\nand generally in support of that form of national disintegration\r\nwhich is involved in the great colonies becoming separate states\r\nor annexing themselves to other nations. Very considerable\r\ninterest is given to this latest utterance of Mr. Smith from the\r\nfact that he is almost the last conspicuous representative of a\r\nschool of thinkers which twenty-five or thirty years ago\r\nappeared likely to dominate English opinion on colonial affairs.\r\n\r\nTo these men the United Kingdom was, and was to be, sufficient\r\nunto itself; the outlying portions of the Empire were but\r\nincidental and temporary {164} connections; the greater colonies\r\nwere to be voluntarily dropped when they had developed strength\r\nto stand alone, or as convenient opportunities to get rid of\r\nthem arose.\r\n\r\nThe splendid edifice of Empire built up by the toil and\r\nstatesmanship of generations was an illusion which gave nothing\r\nmore than a false prestige; its dissolution was to herald the\r\ndawn of a better day.\r\n\r\nIt will be generally admitted that in England this school of\r\nthought is practically dead. In his vigorous and persistent\r\nattempt to revive it in Canada Mr. Smith has met with little\r\nsuccess. That one of the most brilliant writers and masters of\r\nstyle in the English world should in a distant colony have\r\ndevoted well-nigh twenty years of his life to weakening the\r\npolitical bond between Britain and that colony with practically\r\nno visible result, is of itself a phenomenon which indicates the\r\ntrue tendency of national life. But that in the pursuit of his\r\nfixed idea Mr. Smith has done much harm is, I think, scarcely\r\nopen to doubt. Both in Britain and the United States he has\r\nproduced false impressions on Canadian affairs. The useful\r\nefforts which he has made for the elevation of journalism and\r\nfor the purification of public life in Canada, the greater\r\nservice which he might have done in giving high ideals to the\r\nYoung Dominion, have been neutralized or made impossible by his\r\nintellectual slavery to a set of ideas which rendered him\r\nincapable of entering into or sympathizing with the deeper\r\nmotives of {165} Canadian life. A great contemporary thinker and\r\nsatirist, James Russell Lowell, made the 'barbed arrows of his\r\nindignant wit' the terror of corrupt politicians, while still\r\nretaining the love of the people whom he served. This he did in\r\nvirtue of his constant sympathy with national aspirations and\r\nthe firm faith in his country's future which shines through\r\nevery page of his bitterest criticisms. In a similar sphere of\r\neffort Goldwin Smith has failed, because he has permitted an\r\natrabilious and pessimistic temperament, a preference of epigram\r\nto accuracy, and an impatience at the non-fulfilment of his own\r\npolitical prophecies to distort his studies of Canadian\r\nproblems, and to take away much of their value.\r\n\r\nFor those many Canadians who welcomed his coming to Canada, as\r\none of the happiest omens for the political and intellectual\r\nlife of the country, in whom even yet admiration struggles with\r\ndisappointment, the duty of pointing out his unfitness to\r\ninterpret the political history and actual position of Canada,\r\nis as painful as it is imperative.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith's book on Canada is manifestly intended primarily for\r\nreaders in England. It is to his English audience that he\r\nappeals when he says that 'he does not think that the honour or\r\ntrue interest of his native country can for a moment be absent\r\nfrom his breast.' Of this, Englishmen must judge; Canadians, who\r\nrespect patriotic sentiment, only ask of Mr. Smith (and they\r\nhave some reason for emphasizing the request) that they may be\r\ncredited with sincerity {166} when they claim that the honour\r\nand true interests of their native country compel them to\r\ndispute his arguments and repudiate the main conclusions about\r\nCanada's destiny which he outlines for his English readers.\r\nUnfortunately they must do no more than this. Mr. Smith claims\r\n'that he has done his best to take his readers to the heart of\r\nit (the Canadian question) by setting the whole case before\r\nthem: that his opinions have not been hastily formed: that they\r\nhave not, so far as he is aware, been biassed by personal\r\nmotives of any kind.' This is a pledge of fairness and\r\nimpartiality in discussion. It is a pledge which, in Canadian\r\nopinion, is not fulfilled. No man in Canada speaks or writes\r\nwith a deeper sense of responsibility than Principal Grant, as a\r\nclergyman, as the head of an important university, and as one of\r\nthe most active moral forces in the Dominion. He knows Canada,\r\ntoo, from end to end, better than any living man. Yet in a\r\nformal review of _Canada and the Canadian Question_ Principal\r\nGrant endorses the opinion of another writer that Mr. Smith's\r\nbook is 'so brilliant, so inaccurate, so malicious even, that it\r\nis enough to make one weep.' The criticism does not seem to me\r\ntoo strong. Nor must Mr. Smith think that it is only upon\r\nsuper-sensitive Canadian minds that this impression is left. One\r\nof the closest thinkers and most brilliant writers on political\r\nsubjects in England, a man of cool judgment, who has observed\r\nCanadian institutions on the spot, said to me after perusing\r\n_Canada and the Canadian Question_ that he considered {167} it\r\nthe most unfair book he had ever read. At the high table of an\r\nOxford college a Canadian ventured to deprecate the acceptance\r\nby English people of Mr. Smith's brilliant and epigrammatic\r\nstatement of half-truths as truths upon Dominion affairs. The\r\nreply of one of the clearest thinkers in the University was not\r\nunsatisfactory to the colonist. 'We in England know Mr. Smith\r\nwell, and we know that, where every sentence has to be so\r\nsharply pointed as his, a liberal allowance must be made for\r\naccuracy. Canadians need have no fear that his views are\r\naccepted without question here.'\r\n\r\nNor has the impression been different even at the Antipodes. We\r\nread in the _Australian Critic_: 'To say that the book before us\r\nis written by Mr. Goldwin Smith is to say that it is eminently\r\nreadable, that its style is forcible and epigrammatic, and that\r\nits historical descriptions are clear and vivacious. But we have\r\na right to expect something more in a book describing the\r\nhistory and institutions of a country. We have a right to expect\r\nfairness, and fairness in this book we do not get.'\r\n\r\nThis unfairness of statement, thus generally recognized, and\r\nevident to every reader from the moment that those phases of\r\nCanadian politics are dealt with which led up to and followed\r\nupon Confederation, accounts for the irritation so commonly\r\nmanifested in Canadian criticism of Mr. Smith's views. It is an\r\nunfairness the more irritating because often so clever and\r\nsubtle that it half eludes criticism, and because {168} it is\r\nclosely interwoven with much vigorous thought on Canadian\r\naffairs. More than this, many to whom it gives the greatest\r\nannoyance hesitate to criticise it as they would, from a\r\nconviction that it is the offspring of temperament and literary\r\nhabit, rather than deliberate insincerity[1].\r\n\r\nOnly a few of Mr. Smith's arguments can be dealt with here, and\r\nit is perhaps better first to refer to such as are conspicuous\r\nby their fallacy rather than those marked by unfairness.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out the remarkable naval position which the\r\nEmpire holds in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific through\r\nthe possession of Canada. Let us see what Mr. Smith suggests in\r\nsubstitution for this advantage when, as he proposes, it has\r\nbeen voluntarily abandoned.\r\n\r\n'Great Britain may need a coaling station on the Atlantic coast\r\nof North America, not for the purposes of blockade, which could\r\nno longer have place when all danger of war was at an end but\r\nfor the general defence of her trade. Safe coaling stations and\r\nharbours of refuge, rather than territorial dependencies, are\r\napparently what the great exporting country and the mistress of\r\nthe carrying trade now wants. Newfoundland would be a safe and\r\nuninvidious possession, and it has coal, though bituminous and\r\nnot yet worked. The Americans do not covet islands, {169} for\r\nthe defence of which they would have to keep up a navy. The\r\nisland itself would be the gainer: there would be some chance of\r\nthe development of its resources; with nothing but the fishing\r\nthe condition of its people seems to be poor. Let England then\r\nkeep Newfoundland. Cape Breton is rather too close to the coast,\r\notherwise it has coal in itself, and Louisbourg might be\r\nrestored.' Clearly we have here an Englishman who has learned in\r\nhis new home to talk a language unfamiliar for some centuries at\r\nleast to the English ear, and one who fails to grasp the\r\nfundamental conditions of England's existence as a great nation.\r\nThe greatest naval power in the world, bound to defend a\r\nworld-wide commerce and above all to defend that main food route\r\nacross the Atlantic which would almost certainly be the first\r\npoint of attack in a Great European war, because it is the one\r\npoint at which a well-nigh mortal blow could be delivered, is\r\nquietly asked to hand over to another nation her well-nigh\r\nimpregnable naval station at Halifax, her command of a hundred\r\nminor ports, of the St. Lawrence, and of the splendid coal\r\nfields of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, and to relegate herself\r\nto the rock-bound, fog-encircled and sometimes ice-beset coasts\r\nof Newfoundland: to content herself with coal 'bituminous and\r\nnot yet worked,' and all because the possession would be 'safe\r\nand uninvidious' and because 'the Americans do not covet\r\nislands.' In this casual redistribution of the bases of naval\r\npower it is {170} extremely characteristic and noteworthy that\r\non the Pacific where the trade of a great ocean is to be\r\nprotected, and where Russia has a great naval depot, not even an\r\nisland is reserved for British people, probably because again\r\nVancouver is 'rather too near to the coast,' to be outside the\r\nrange of American covetousness, and its coal deposits too\r\nextensive for it to be considered 'uninvidious.' In reading the\r\nlines I have quoted from Mr. Smith expressing his conception of\r\nthe relation of the United States to Great Britain, it is\r\nimpossible not to recall the words which Shakspere puts into the\r\nmouth of Cassius;--\r\n\r\n    'Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\r\n    Like a Colossus, and we petty men\r\n    Walk under his huge legs, and peep about\r\n    To find ourselves dishonourable graves.'\r\n\r\nLet us not fail, however, to recognize that Mr. Smith does dimly\r\nsee and admit the conditions under which Britain holds her\r\nmaritime power. 'Safe coaling stations and harbours of refuge,\r\nrather than territorial dependencies are apparently what the\r\ngreat exporting country and the mistress of the carrying trade\r\nnow wants.' The admission that British naval power rests upon\r\nsafe coaling stations and harbours of refuge is fundamental. But\r\nthe most superficial study of the facts or even a glance at the\r\nmap makes it plain that in the Empire the command of these\r\npositions is inseparably connected with territorial possession.\r\nBritain cannot turn away her great colonies to work out an\r\nindependent destiny while {171} at the same time she retains in\r\neach the best points in naval and military vantage for the\r\ncreation of a series of Gibraltars such as Mr. Smith apparently\r\nhas in his mind. Sir Charles Dilke has clearly pointed out that\r\nwhile we cannot possibly with any regard to commercial security\r\ngive up the military station which we hold at the extremity of\r\nAfrica, on the other hand we cannot retain it permanently\r\nwithout the friendship of the colonists and a maintenance of\r\nnational control over the surrounding country. Still more true\r\nis this of Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Let Mr. Smith try\r\nto arrange a plan by which Australia, South Africa and Canada\r\nwill accept independence with its national responsibilities and\r\nat the same time hand over to England their 'safe coaling\r\nstations and harbours of refuge' which he himself admits are the\r\nvery conditions of her existence, and he will find himself face\r\nto face with a problem much more difficult than any which he\r\npropounds to Imperial Federationists when he demands of them a\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n'Surely,' says Mr. Smith, 'the appearance of a world-wide power,\r\ngrasping all the waterways and all the points of maritime\r\nvantage, instead of propagating peace, would, like an alarm gun,\r\ncall the nations to battle.' To this it must straightway be\r\nanswered that the case is one in which as things stand no\r\n'grasping' is required. What British people need for their great\r\nnational purposes they hold already. Their possessions have been\r\nwon in a long course of national {172} development and are held\r\nin most cases under the solemn confirmation of ancient or modern\r\ntreaty, or at least by the tacit consent of all the nations. No\r\ntitle-deeds in the world are more secure according to any\r\nrecognized code of international relation. Nor is her moral\r\nright to consolidate her position less strong or more likely to\r\nbe questioned. Self-defence is a primary instinct and admitted\r\nnecessity of nature--recognized as such by communities as well\r\nas individuals. 'In strengthening her navy, England is pursuing\r\na policy in the strict sense defensive. We threaten nobody. We\r\ncherish no ambitious design. It is more and more the wise policy\r\nof England to keep out of engagements in matters with which\r\nneither we of the mother-country nor our sons in the colonies\r\nhave any concern. The external policy of England is directed to\r\none object, which is to secure from attack the highway of the\r\nsea[2].' To different nations the problem of self-defence comes\r\nin different forms. France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Russia,\r\nfind vast military organization the necessary condition of safe\r\nnational existence. To none of them would exclusion from\r\ncommerce with the rest of the world be fatal: their own\r\nresources can, in emergency, supply their wants. Resistance to a\r\nflood of hostile invasion they must be prepared to make at any\r\nmoment, and to this the public thought is mainly directed. No\r\none questions their right to equip themselves for this\r\nresistance, however much the necessity may be deplored.\r\n\r\n{173}\r\n\r\nThe United States, again, have been hitherto comparatively\r\nindependent of external commerce. Even the carrying trade has\r\nbeen allowed to slip chiefly into foreign hands. Continental\r\nisolation and vast population give a sufficient range for\r\nnational industry and sufficient security from hostile invasion.\r\nThey enable the people to turn their attention mainly to\r\ninternal development and the complex or even threatening\r\nproblems involved in the assimilation and elevation of the\r\nconfluent races which are taking possession of the soil. Very\r\ndifferent is the position of British people. To them, whether at\r\nhome or abroad, the steady flow of commerce is as the flow of\r\nblood through the veins; the safety of the waterways is\r\npractically a question of life or death. The very fact that\r\nBritain is not compelled to be a great military power, in the\r\nsense that European nations are military powers, adds millions\r\nto her armies of industry, increases indefinitely her producing\r\nforces and so makes more imperative the necessity for absolutely\r\nsafe commercial intercourse. Britain, as the result of natural\r\ngrowth, now possesses the unquestionable right and the manifest\r\nopportunity, without a single stroke of aggression, to organize\r\na naval power adequate to the protection of the chief waterways\r\nof the world, and of the enormous commerce which the industry of\r\nher people has created thereon. To any combination thus planned\r\nto guard the very life of the nation, what just or reasonable\r\nobjection can be made? To any objection not just or reasonable\r\n{174} what answer must English people make? For a race of\r\ntraders scattered over all quarters of the globe, peace is a\r\nsupreme interest, and peace, as the world is now constituted,\r\ncan only rest on organized power. For the first time in history\r\nwe see a nation which unites under its flag all the\r\ncomprehensiveness of a world-wide Empire and a wonderful\r\nrelative compactness secured by that practical contraction of\r\nour planet which has taken place under the combined influences\r\nof steam and electricity. No other nation ever has had--it is\r\nwell nigh impossible to believe that any other nation ever will\r\nhave--so commanding a position for exercising the functions of\r\nwhat I have called an oceanic Empire, interested in developing\r\nand able to protect the commerce of the world. Such an Empire is\r\nprobably the best guarantee of permanent peace the world has\r\never had or is likely to have this side of the millennium. Who\r\nshall question our right and duty to organize it for the great\r\nends manifestly within our reach?\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Smith questions not merely our right, but our capacity.\r\n\r\nWe are told that however much steam and telegraph have\r\nannihilated distance 'they have not annihilated the parish\r\nsteeple. They have not carried the thoughts of the ordinary\r\ncitizen beyond the circle of his own life and work. They have\r\nnot qualified a common farmer, tradesman, plough man, or artizan\r\nto direct the politics of a world-wide state[3].' Shall we {175}\r\nthen give up all large statesmanship, and adopt the parish\r\nsteeple as the measure of our political ideas? The parish\r\nsteeple has its place and limiting power in England as\r\nelsewhere, but it has not prevented the creation of a great\r\nEmpire, its successful administration and its retention. In the\r\nend it is the strongest men and the clearest minds of a country\r\nwhich give direction to its destiny, and nowhere is this more\r\nthe case than among Anglo-Saxon people. The common farmer,\r\ntradesman, plough man, or artizan may not be able to direct the\r\npolicy of a state, but he has a marvellous instinct for\r\ndiscovering and supporting the man who can, be he a Cromwell or\r\na Cecil, a rail-splitter or a Hohenzollern. When he has made up\r\nhis mind, moreover, we have more to fear, apparently, from a too\r\ncomplete surrender of his own judgment than from ignorant\r\ninterference in matters which he does not fully comprehend. That\r\nthe spread of modern democracy involves no necessity of\r\nabandoning large statesmanship the history of the colonies\r\nclearly proves. Canadians may not, as Mr. Smith suggests, know\r\nmuch of Australian or South African politics, but they have\r\ngiven themselves up with singular persistence to the guidance of\r\na statesman with an imperial range of ideas and policy. In\r\nAustralia the masses, however much they may be absorbed in their\r\nlabour struggles and social problems, choose, as their leaders,\r\nwith occasional change, but on the whole singular steadiness,\r\nmen like Sir Henry Parkes, Mr. Service, Sir Samuel Griffiths,\r\nMr. Gillies, or {176} Sir Henry Atkinson, every one of them men\r\nwho, even when most absorbed with the affairs of their own\r\ncolonies, are thinking constantly on national questions, and\r\ndreaming of some great British unity in the future, as their\r\nwritten and spoken thoughts fully testify. Even in South Africa,\r\nwith its intensified localism, we see the reins of power\r\ncommitted to a man who stakes his political career equally upon\r\nworking out a South African unity, and upon securing that it\r\nshall be consistent with the policy of a united Empire.\r\n\r\nI fear that it is impossible to acquit Mr. Smith of at times\r\nmaking statements disingenuous in themselves and especially\r\nmisleading to the English reader. Perhaps the peculiar animosity\r\nwith which he has always regarded those Canadian Railways whose\r\nconstruction has falsified his prophecy that the Dominion could\r\nnot be welded together, explains, if it does not excuse, a\r\nspecial recklessness of statement when he describes them to\r\nEnglish people. Mr. Smith speaks of the Intercolonial Railway as\r\n'spanning the vast and irreclaimable wilderness which separates\r\nHalifax from Quebec.' Again he says: 'The maritime Provinces are\r\ndivided from Old Canada by the wilderness of many hundred miles,\r\nthrough which the Intercolonial Railway runs, hardly taking up a\r\npassenger or a bale of freight by the way.' Would the ordinary\r\nreader outside of Canada believe, after reading this\r\ndescription, that in the course of the 688 miles of rail between\r\nHalifax and Quebec the {177} Intercolonial traverses large\r\ncounties like Cumberland and Westmorland, among the most fertile\r\nand productive in Canada; that though running through forest\r\ncountry in the immediate rear of the settled coast line it is\r\nclosely connected by a score of short branches with the coal\r\nareas and all the thickly populated districts along the Bay of\r\nFundy and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, that for 100 miles it\r\nfollows the still more populous shores of the River St.\r\nLawrence, and that the comparatively short distance, scarcely\r\nmore than 100 miles, between the settlements at the head of Bay\r\nChaleur and those of the St. Lawrence is alone responsible for\r\nthe epithets 'vast and irreclaimable' which Mr. Smith applies to\r\nthe whole length of the road? Would the reader believe that it\r\nis a railway which carries about a million passengers and more\r\nthan a million tons of freight every year? That it has conferred\r\nthe enormous advantage of swift communication with the outside\r\nworld on some hundreds of thousands of people to whom its\r\nconstruction was an object of eager desire for years before it\r\nwas accomplished? It is true that, worked as a State Railway for\r\nthe good of the communities through which it passes, for the\r\navowed purpose of uniting the provinces more closely, kept at a\r\nhigh state of efficiency, and under some unusual expense for\r\nclearing away snow in winter, a loss is at present annually\r\nincurred, but it is doubtful if any public expenditure made in\r\nthe Dominion confers so great an advantage on so many people,\r\nwhile subserving great national purposes. {178} Not in Canada\r\nalone, but in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India,\r\nRussia and South America, railways, which do not directly pay,\r\nare for the public good, or for prospective and indirect\r\nadvantage, constructed and worked to the content of those who\r\npay for them. In Great Britain state subventions are given to\r\nsteamship, postal, and cable lines which would not in themselves\r\nbe at once commercially profitable. For many years a large\r\ndeficit has been paid on the ordinary English telegraph system;\r\na deficit which even last year amounted to no less than £190,000\r\nsterling. The money has been paid cheerfully, because it gives\r\nto the mass of the people the advantages of the sixpenny\r\ntelegram.\r\n\r\nWhy should all the vials of wrath, ridicule, and, we may now\r\nadd, misrepresentation, be reserved for the one State Railway of\r\nCanada, because the people are willing to pay the deficiency of\r\n£50,000 or £100,000 involved in its operation, for the sake of\r\nthe consolidation which it has given to the Dominion, and the\r\nunmeasured benefit which it confers on immense districts and\r\nlarge populations which would otherwise be singularly isolated,\r\nsocially and commercially, from the rest of Canada and the rest\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nOnce more, speaking in disparagement of the same railway as a\r\nmilitary route, Mr. Smith says: 'At the time when the\r\nIntercolonial was projected, the two British officers of\r\nartillery, whose pamphlet has been already cited, pointed out\r\nthat the line would be fatally liable to snow blocks. It would\r\nbe awkward if, at a crisis {179} like that of the Great Mutiny,\r\nor that of a Russian invasion in India, the reinforcements were\r\nblockaded by snow in the wilderness between Halifax and Quebec.'\r\nWhat can we think of a writer who claims to be fair, and yet\r\nparades as authorities two young gentlemen whose haphazard\r\nforecast has been belied by twenty years of actual working\r\nexperience? So far from being 'fatally' liable to snow block,\r\nthe Intercolonial is operated during the two or three months of\r\ndeep snow with less risk of delay than is incurred every day of\r\nthe year by ships passing through the Suez Canal, the other most\r\navailable route in an Indian Crisis. It has been my own lot to\r\nsuffer a longer detention on a steamship at Ismailia, a\r\ndetention accepted by the ship's officers as in the course of\r\nordinary experience, than I can remember having met with in many\r\nyears' experience of the Intercolonial.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Smith turns from the Intercolonial, which does not pay,\r\nto the Canada Pacific, which does, we find no improvement in\r\nfairness of statement. Of the Canada Pacific he says: 'The fact\r\nis constantly overlooked in vaunting the importance of this line\r\nto the Empire, that its Eastern section passes through the State\r\nof Maine, and would, of course, be closed to troops in case of\r\nwar with any power at peace with the United States.' In a note\r\nit is added: 'The _Quarterly Review_, for example, spoke of the\r\nCanadian Pacific Railway as running from \"start to finish\" over\r\nBritish ground, though the line was at that very moment applying\r\nfor bonding privileges to the Government of {180} the United\r\nStates.' This is evidently a deliberate statement. What are the\r\nfacts? During the months of open navigation Montreal is the\r\nwater terminus of the Canada Pacific Railway, and the only point\r\nfrom which transfers would be made across the continent. From\r\nMontreal to Vancouver, that is, from ocean to ocean, from 'start\r\nto finish,' the line is entirely on British soil. Connection\r\nfurther east with the winter ports of Halifax and St. John, has\r\nfrom the first been made by means of the Grand Trunk and\r\nIntercolonial lines, the route yet from 'start to finish'\r\nrunning over British territory alone. From the St. Lawrence\r\nthere is even the alternative of a double route to the sea\r\ncoast, one down the St. John valley, chiefly owned and\r\ncontrolled, I think, by the Canada Pacific, the other along the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence, while a third has been projected by the\r\nGrand Trunk, the rival of the Canada Pacific, through the heart\r\nof New Brunswick. Only a year and a half ago the Canada Pacific,\r\nto save distance, built still another line from Montreal\r\neastward to make connection with the Intercolonial, and it is on\r\nthe ground that a portion of this third line passes through the\r\nState of Maine that Mr. Smith informs English people that\r\nCanada's trans-continental railway 'would, of course, be closed\r\nto troops in case of war with any power at peace with the United\r\nStates.' Whether this statement, made in a very critical point\r\nof Mr. Smith's argument, is a _suppressio veri_ or _suggestio\r\nfalsi_, I leave others to decide. On which side is the correct\r\nstatement of {181} facts I can safely leave to the adjudication\r\nof the Canadian reader, the Canadian press, or of any person who\r\nhas access to a good railway map of the Dominion. So flagrant\r\nseems to me the distortion of fact that I have sometimes\r\nwondered whether Mr. Smith was not testing the limits of that\r\nEnglish ignorance of colonial matters of which he makes much in\r\nanother part of his volume.\r\n\r\nI must quote once more: 'In opening a trade among the provinces,\r\na natural trade at least, these inter-provincial railroads have\r\nfailed, for the simple reason that the provinces have hardly any\r\nproducts to exchange with each other, and that means of\r\nconveyance are futile where there is nothing to be conveyed.'\r\nThe answer to this may be put into a question which business men\r\nwill appreciate even if an author in his study at Toronto does\r\nnot. Why is it, if there is nothing to be conveyed between the\r\nprovinces, that, in addition to the Intercolonial, two competing\r\nlines have already been constructed and a third projected, all\r\non purely business principles, to unite the maritime provinces\r\nto those of the St. Lawrence?\r\n\r\nIn his excessive eagerness to make points, Mr. Smith exposes\r\nhimself to no slight suspicion of a willingness to open up\r\nunnecessarily, if not maliciously, old sores between the\r\nmother-land and the colony. He says: 'That in all diplomatic\r\nquestions with the United States the interest of Canada has been\r\nsacrificed to the Imperial exigency of keeping peace with {182}\r\nthe Americans is the constant theme of Canadian complaint. ...\r\nBy the treaty of 1783, confirming the independence of the United\r\nStates, England not only resigned the territory claimed by each\r\nState of the Union severally, but abandoned to the general\r\ngovernment immense territories \"unsettled, unexplored, and\r\nunknown.\"' After explaining that this was partly due to\r\nignorance, he continues: 'This is the beginning of a long and\r\nuniform story, in the course of which not only great tracts of\r\nterritory, but geographical unity has been lost. To understand\r\nhow deeply this iron has entered into the Canadian soul, the\r\nEnglishman must turn to his map and mark out how much of\r\ngeographical compactness, of military security, and of\r\ncommercial convenience was lost when Britain gave up Maine. ...\r\nA large portion of Minnesota, Dakota, Montana, and Washington,\r\nCanada also thinks she has wrongfully lost. These are causes of\r\ndiscontent; discontent may one day breed disaffection;\r\ndisaffection may lead to another calamitous rupture; and instead\r\nof going forth into the world when the hour of maturity has\r\narrived with the parent's blessing, the child may turn in anger\r\nfrom the parental door.'\r\n\r\nTo conjure up these historic mistakes as the cause of a possible\r\nnational rupture will only raise a smile in Canada; upon readers\r\noutside of Canada who do not understand the circumstances the\r\npassage leaves a false impression. That mistakes were made most\r\npeople agree; that they were partly due to the ignorance {183}\r\nof English diplomatists is true; but Canadians must admit that\r\nthey were due to Canadian ignorance as well. As late as 1874 a\r\nCabinet Minister of the Dominion on a public platform described\r\nthe splendid wheat areas of the North-West as a country only\r\nfitted to be the home of the wolf and the bear. Among the\r\nseparate and unsympathetic provinces, prior to confederation,\r\nthere were ignorance and indifference as well as among English\r\nstatesmen. 'Every intelligent Canadian now knows that most of\r\nthese mistakes were far more due to the want of a nexus between\r\nthe Colony and the Empire which would have brought colonial\r\nknowledge and experience to the assistance of British diplomacy.\r\nHe knows that since the acceptance of this assistance as a part\r\nof the public policy of Britain, such mistakes can no longer\r\noccur, as the Fishery Award at Halifax and the Fishery Treaty at\r\nWashington, when Canadian interests were represented by\r\nCanadians, sufficiently testify; as the Behring Sea negotiations\r\ntestify, in which, acting upon the information supplied by the\r\nDominion Government, and recognizing the justice of the case,\r\nLord Salisbury did not hesitate to say the final word which made\r\naggressive diplomacy pause and submit to impartial arbitration.\r\n\r\n'Disintegration, surely, is on the point of being complete,' and\r\n'the last strand of political connection is worn almost to the\r\nlast thread,' Mr. Smith exclaims, using as the illustration of\r\nhis point Newfoundland's claim to make a commercial treaty of\r\nher own independently {184} of Canada. He refuses to see what\r\nothers see, that the invitation to Newfoundland to have her\r\ninterests directly represented in the arbitration with France;\r\nthe fact that Canada has been thus represented at Halifax, at\r\nWashington, in the Behring Sea difficulties; the formal\r\nintroduction, in short, of colonial opinion and knowledge into\r\nnational diplomacy, marks the creation of new threads of\r\nconnection, new bonds of union, which promise to be permanent,\r\nbecause constructed on true and primary political principles.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, a fatal flaw in Mr. Smith's discussion of the\r\nCanadian Question, a fatal comment on his claim to have 'done\r\nhis best to take his readers to the heart of it by setting the\r\nwhole case before them,' that he makes no mention of this\r\ndecisive change in national policy, or of the consequent change\r\nin the Canadian mind, which, if not reconciled to losses in the\r\npast, has no reason to dread them in the future, and in this\r\nconfidence is content. That he should treat as present and\r\ngravely irritating, grievances which have become purely\r\nhistorical, is unfair and misleading.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulties with the United States which have arisen on\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic coasts are not settled amicably and\r\njustly, it will not be from any want of willingness on the part\r\nof British people or Canadians. Britain and Canada agreed to a\r\nsettlement of the St Lawrence Fishery Question which an American\r\nDemocratic President and Cabinet accepted as fair. A Republican\r\nSenate rejected it as a move in the party {185} game, and has\r\npreferred to leave it open ever since. Any reader of the\r\ncorrespondence in the Behring Sea Question can judge for himself\r\non which side was the spirit of conciliation and compromise.\r\nOnly in the last resort did Lord Salisbury utter the warning\r\nwords which seem to have done more than anything else to prepare\r\nthe way for fair adjudication upon the points at issue.\r\n\r\nHow curiously and completely Mr. Smith is out of touch and\r\nsympathy with the organizing movements of the British world: how\r\noddly inconsistent he can be even while pressing his own\r\ntheories, one or two further illustrations will suffice to show.\r\nApparently he looks upon Australian Federation as a step in the\r\nwrong direction. 'We cannot help once more warning the\r\nAustralians that Federation under the Elective system involves\r\nnot merely the union of the several states under a central\r\ngovernment with powers superior to them all; but the creation of\r\nFederal parties with all the faction, demagogism, and corruption\r\nwhich party conflicts involve over a new field and on a vastly\r\nextended scale. It is surprising how little this obvious and\r\nmomentous consideration appears to be present to the minds of\r\nstatesmen when the question of Federation is discussed[4].'\r\nWarnings like this are repeated. Anxious as he seems to be for\r\nthe unification of the American continent by the absorption of\r\nCanada into the United States, Mr. Smith would apparently urge\r\nVictoria, New South Wales, and Queensland to avoid even the\r\nexample of Canadian {186} confederation in gaining for\r\nthemselves effective unity, although he knows, that for them\r\nconfederation means the freedom of the continental market and\r\nthe same breaking down of tariff walls which is the one supreme\r\nbribe he has to offer to Canadians in exchange for the surrender\r\nof their nationality. Another turn of the intellectual wheel and\r\neven American unification is forgotten in a new ideal of\r\ndisintegration. 'There is no reason why Ontario should not be a\r\nnation if she were minded to be one. Her territory is compact.\r\nHer population is already as large as that of Denmark, and\r\nlikely to be a good deal larger, probably as large as that of\r\nSwitzerland; and it is sufficiently homogeneous if she can only\r\nrepress French encroachment on her eastern border. She would\r\nhave no access to the sea: no more has Switzerland, Hungary, or\r\nServia ... The same thing might have been said with regard to\r\nthe maritime Provinces--supposing them to have formed a\r\nlegislative union--Quebec, British Columbia, or the North West.\r\nIn the North West, rating its cultivable area at the lowest,\r\nthere would be room for no mean nation.' This passage may\r\nexplain to English or Australian readers why Mr. Smith has no\r\nacceptance in the Dominion as the prophet of Canada's political\r\nfuture. One remembers with astonishment that it is the writer of\r\nthese lines who, on the one hand, assures Canadians that they\r\ncannot resist absorption into the United States, and who, on the\r\nother, tells the advocates of British unity that they are\r\nimpracticable dreamers.\r\n\r\n{187}\r\n\r\nAfter this it does not seem surprising to find that Mr. Smith\r\nhimself proceeds to knock away the foundations on which his own\r\nargument on the Canadian question has been built? These\r\nfoundations are practically two in number--the fear of war on\r\nthe American continent arising from irritation at the presence\r\nof Britain there--and the necessity for Canada of commercial\r\nintercourse with her own continent. These are the reasons why\r\nthe Empire is to be disintegrated, and Canada is to seek a new\r\nnational connection.\r\n\r\nFollowing upon this we read: 'Of conquest there is absolutely no\r\nthought. The Southern violence and the Western lawlessness which\r\nforced the Union into the war of 1812 are things of the past.\r\nThe American people could not now be brought to invade the homes\r\nof an unoffending neighbour. They have no craving for more\r\nterritory. They know that while a despot who annexes may govern\r\nthrough a viceroy with a strong hand, a republic which annexes\r\nmust incorporate, and would only weaken itself by incorporating\r\ndisaffection. The special reason for wishing to bring Canada at\r\nonce into the Union, that she might help to balance the Slave\r\nPower, has with the Slave Power departed. So far as the\r\nAmericans are concerned, Canada is absolute mistress of her own\r\ndestiny.'\r\n\r\nCanada, therefore, in Mr. Smith's later opinion, has nothing to\r\nfear from war with the United States.\r\n\r\nOnce more, discussing the McKinley tariff, we read:--,\r\n\r\n{188}\r\n\r\n'However, the manifest faults of the measure, combined with the\r\nenormous waste of public money incurred in baling out surplus\r\nrevenue to avert a reform of the tariff, have proved too much\r\nfor the superstition or the sufferance of the American people.\r\nSymptoms of a change of opinion had even before appeared. New\r\nEngland is now praying for free admission of raw materials. The\r\nRepublican party in the United States is the war party, kept on\r\nfoot for the sake of maintaining the war tariff in the interest\r\nof the protected manufactures. It has made a desperate effort to\r\nretain power and to rivet its policy on the nation by means\r\nwhich have estranged from it the best of its supporters; but in\r\nthe late elections it has received a signal, and probably\r\ndecisive overthrow. What all the preachings of economic science\r\nwere powerless to effect has been brought about at last by the\r\nreduction of the public debt, and of the necessity for duties as\r\nrevenue. A new commercial era has apparently dawned for the\r\nUnited States, and the lead of the United States will be\r\nfollowed in time by the rest of the world.'\r\n\r\nThis means, if words mean anything, that in Mr. Smith's opinion,\r\nthe United States are soon to throw open their markets to the\r\nworld, and so, without political humiliation, Canada will have\r\nthe commercial freedom of her own continent. One asks why\r\n'Canada and the Canadian Question' was ever written.\r\n\r\nAn explanation may perhaps be found. Mr. Smith quotes (page 247)\r\nSir Henry Taylor's opinion that {189} the North American\r\ncolonies are useless and dangerous possessions for Britain, and\r\nthus goes on to remark: 'It may be said that this was written in\r\n1852 and that since that time we have had new lights. Some\r\npersons have had new lights, but those who have not are no more\r\nunpatriotic in saying that the possession and its uses are as\r\ndust in the balance compared with its evil contingencies than\r\nwas Sir Henry Taylor.' That is to say, though within the last\r\nhalf century the relations of the empire have absolutely\r\nchanged, though the safety of its enormously multiplied commerce\r\nhas come to depend on steam and coaling stations in every corner\r\nof the world, though the colonies have become great\r\nself-governing and self-sustaining communities, though the world\r\nhas been recreated by steam and electricity, Mr. Smith frankly\r\nadmits that these facts have given him no 'new lights' on\r\nquestions of empire. He is living among the memories of the\r\npast; he devotes himself to the task of maintaining a theory\r\nbased upon facts which have become fossilized under the drift of\r\nhalf a century of extraordinary change. Even if we are prepared\r\nin such a case to admit his sincerity, we have a right from the\r\noutset to challenge any claim to adequacy of treatment or\r\ncorrectness of judgment.\r\n\r\nOne more criticism of British Federation may be referred to as\r\nillustrating the inconsistency in argument of which a clever\r\nwriter is capable:--\r\n\r\n'Are the negroes of the West Indies to be included? {190} Is\r\nQuashee to vote on imperial policy?' says Mr. Smith, in fine\r\nscorn of the British federationist, who doubtless has no special\r\nfear or thought about a carefully restricted and controlled\r\ncoloured vote in a few scattered colonies: a vote which in the\r\naggregate represents not more than a very minute fraction of one\r\nper cent. of the enfranchised citizenship of the Empire.\r\nStrangely out of place, however, does this scorn seem when we\r\nfind the same pages embody an argument for Canadians throwing in\r\ntheir political lot with a Republic where the Quashee vote,\r\nunconditionally and irrevocably granted, will far outweigh their\r\nown; where it will become enormously influential as soon as the\r\nfree exercise is permitted of the rights granted by\r\nconstitutional law, as, one would think, must ultimately be the\r\ncase in a country which claims to give exceptional political\r\nfreedom. Equally inconsistent does it seem when placed beside\r\nthe romantic political enterprize to which Mr. Smith would\r\ncommit Canadians. He says, 'The native American element in which\r\nthe tradition of self-government resides is hard-pressed by the\r\nforeign element untrained to self-government, and stands in need\r\nof the reinforcement which the entrance of Canada into the Union\r\nwould bring it[5].' Nay, more, Mr. Smith wishes Canada to enter\r\nthe Union for Britain's sake, that she may 'neutralize the votes\r\nof her enemies[6].' Does he reflect that if the Canadian {191}\r\nvote chanced to be barely insufficient to neutralize the votes\r\nof Britain's enemies, Canada would, as I have elsewhere pointed\r\nout, be constitutionally forced into active hostility to the\r\nmother-land? The path which he points out has on it possible\r\nnatural dishonour from which Canadians will instinctively\r\nshrink. They will prefer to retain the right to neutralize the\r\ninfluence of Britain's enemies, if the necessity arise, by other\r\nmeans, such as they have found effective before.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A _Times_' editorial has spoken of Mr. Smith's views about\r\nthe relations of Canada to the Empire as 'one of those crazes\r\nthat are scarcely intelligible in a man of great intellectual\r\npower.'\r\n\r\n[2] Lord Brassey, _Naval Annual_, 1890\r\n\r\n[3] _Canada and the Canadian Question_, p. 260.\r\n\r\n[4] _Canada and the Canadian Question_, p. 232.\r\n\r\n[5] _Canada and the Canadian Question_, p. 274.\r\n\r\n[6] _Idem_, p. 269.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{192}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE been able to speak of Canada as a unit; as already ripe\r\nfor the next stage in its political development; and of its\r\npeople as practically familiar with the application of the\r\nFederal principle. The Australian colonies, which, taken\r\ntogether, come next to Canada in size and population, have not\r\nreached this point, but are struggling towards it. Yielding to\r\nwhat appears to be the general tendency of modern political\r\ndevelopment, and following the example of the United States and\r\nCanada, the Australian people are wrestling with the problems of\r\nlocal federation. With two great precedents to guide them the\r\ntask might seem an easy one. But they meet with the old\r\ndifficulty in learning the art of give and take; in overcoming\r\nthe same narrow but often sincere spirit of provincialism which\r\nobstructed the adoption of a federal system in the United States\r\nand Canada, the spirit which will have to be met and overcome in\r\nworking out any system of British unity. It is, however, a\r\nsignificant and hopeful fact that the growth of the individual\r\ncolonies has inspired in all the best minds the aspiration for\r\nsome larger {193} Australian patriotism than any single colony\r\ncan give. The problem of federating Australia presents some\r\nfeatures different from those met with in the United States and\r\nCanada. The whole territory of a vast continent is divided among\r\nfive colonies, each of which has therefore in area the\r\nproportions of an empire or kingdom, and far exceeds in size the\r\nstates of the American Union or the provinces of Canada. Each\r\nhas a sea frontage of its own, and is thus independent of all\r\nothers for external communication. These divisions, again, have\r\ngrown up under a system of what may be called state socialism.\r\nThe government of each colony takes the chief part in developing\r\nits resources, by the construction of Railways, irrigation\r\nsystems and other public works, involving the creation of large\r\npublic debts. Thus immense importance has been given to the\r\nfunctions of the individual colony, functions which the colony\r\nwould be unwilling to resign, and which the Federal Government\r\nwould be rash to undertake.\r\n\r\nI mention these new features and difficulties, because in\r\ndealing with them new light will be thrown on federal problems.\r\nEach accomplished federation makes more clear the steps by which\r\nthe next and higher one is to be attained, and the principles by\r\nwhich it is to be governed.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to speak of the three insular divisions of\r\nthe Australasian colonies separately, but it is in regarding\r\nthem as a whole that we get an adequate idea of the great place\r\nwhich they hold {194} and may continue to hold in the Empire.\r\nTheir populations are, and will continue to be, more purely\r\nBritish than any countries yet occupied by Anglo-Saxon people.\r\nNinety-five per cent. of the inhabitants, whether born in the\r\ncolonies or in the mother-land, are British. There is here\r\nnothing to parallel the elimination of the Anglo-Saxon element\r\nwhich is taking place so rapidly in the United States. There is\r\nno French province, with its individual lines of development, as\r\nin Canada. There is no large Dutch element, as in South Africa.\r\nThe coloured population which may be found necessary for the\r\ncultivation of the tropical north, will be strictly subordinated\r\nto the necessities of British development, and there will never\r\nbe in Australia, as there is in the United States, an immense\r\ncoloured vote to confuse national politics. As a base of\r\nmaritime power the Australasian colonies manifestly furnish to\r\nthe nation of which they are a part an opportunity for\r\nmaintaining a supreme and indisputable control over a vast area\r\nof the southern seas. Their harbours, some of which are amongst\r\nthe most capacious in the world are yet for the most part\r\ncapable of secure defence. Several are already supplied with\r\ndocks, spacious enough to admit for repair the largest ships\r\nafloat. The more important are already strongly fortified.\r\nMelbourne is pronounced by competent authorities to be one of\r\nthe best defended ports in the Empire. In New South Wales,\r\nQueensland, Tasmania and New Zealand, great neighbouring coal\r\n{195} deposits increase the value of the harbours as stations\r\nfor either carrying on or protecting trade. Still more\r\nimportant, they have behind them great and increasing\r\npopulations, capable of supplying adequate means of local\r\ndefence. It is manifest that such colonies may be a great\r\nelement of strength in any nation, and especially in one which\r\nchiefly depends for security on naval power. Along with South\r\nAfrica in the Southern Hemisphere they complete what I have\r\nbefore called the quadrilateral of maritime position which in\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere is represented by the United Kingdom\r\nitself and Canada, with the commanding outlook of the latter\r\nupon the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Australasia and South\r\nAfrica, however, projected as they are far into the water\r\nhemisphere of the globe, give a far more complete monoply of\r\nnaval position than do the northern angles of this\r\nquadrilateral. A great sea power enjoying the right to their\r\nexclusive use would in any conflict have an immeasurable\r\nadvantage in maintaining command of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe facts which indicate the industrial relation of Australasia\r\nto the rest of the Empire are scarcely less significant than\r\nthose connected with naval position.\r\n\r\nIn the production of one great article of manufacture, wool, it\r\neasily leads the world, both in respect of quantity and quality.\r\nIn its singular adaptation for pastoral pursuits it seems the\r\nnatural complement of a great manufacturing country like the\r\nUnited Kingdom, and of a cold country like Canada. Its {196}\r\ncapacity for supplying meat as well as wool to the United\r\nKingdom has increased greatly during the last few years and\r\nappears capable of indefinite expansion.\r\n\r\nThe production of gold, amounting to more than £300,000,000 in\r\nless than fifty years; of silver, copper, tin and other metals,\r\nwhich in vast quantities find their chief market in Great\r\nBritain, indicate another important line of connection with\r\nBritish industry. In proportion to population the Australasian\r\ncolonies take from Great Britain more than any other countries\r\nin the world; they are able to do so because they sell to her\r\nmore than any other countries. Without precise figures to\r\njustify the assertion one is yet quite safe in saying that no\r\ntwo states in the American Union, even those lying most closely\r\ntogether, have such proportionately large trade relations with\r\neach other as have the Australasian colonies and the United\r\nKingdom, situated at opposite sides of the globe.\r\n\r\nAustralia's apparent isolation has suggested to many the\r\npossibility and expediency of her aiming at an independent\r\nnational life. A little study of her relations with the rest of\r\nthe world shows that her isolation, at any rate, is purely\r\nimaginary. If the first glance leads us to think that the\r\ncolonies most remote from Britain are likely to have the least\r\nconnection with her, facts soon show us that they really have\r\nthe closest of all. There is a very plain argument which goes to\r\nprove that distance under {197} the conditions of modern\r\ncommerce, produces a greater community of interest than\r\ncontiguity. In Canada I have put historical bias in the\r\nforefront of the factors determining towards national unity, a\r\nbias so strong that in the future, as in the past, it seems\r\nlikely to defy any geographical considerations which oppose it,\r\nand to force even commercial relations, to some extent, if need\r\nbe, into its own direction. In Australia the prior place must be\r\ngiven to geographical situation and its influence upon\r\ncommercial relationship. In her interests and connections\r\nAustralia is, in an extraordinary degree, European and Asiatic.\r\nFour-fifths at least of all her external commerce is with\r\nBritain or with European countries chiefly through Britain. This\r\ntrade passes along waterways the safety of which depends upon\r\nthe movements of European powers. It is an essential element in\r\nthe prosperity of the people. A trade at present small but\r\nprospectively great in the Indian and China seas gives Australia\r\na deep interest in Asiatic questions.\r\n\r\nAn able Australian writer lately said in the _Times_, 'Australia\r\nis one of the least self-contained countries in the world. It is\r\na wonderful producer of raw material. But it must trade off this\r\nraw material. ... A dozen big \"stations\" would supply wool\r\nenough to clothe every man, woman and child in Australia. How is\r\nthe big remainder, almost the whole, to be disposed of? We must\r\nsell it in the other hemisphere. We have no choice. ... The fact\r\nis we cannot {198} produce all we want to consume, and we cannot\r\nconsume all that we can easily produce. ... We must sell our\r\nsurplus abroad. It would not be worth while disturbing the\r\ndeposit at Broken Hill only to pack away millions of silver\r\ncoins in vaults.' He goes on to say: 'England could do without\r\nAustralia better than Australia could do without England. The\r\none imaginable event would mean something like ruin; the other,\r\nonly disaster. England's prosperity is rooted in many countries,\r\nin so many that she is always able to turn a brave face in any\r\nsingle direction.'\r\n\r\nLeading merchants and financiers of Australia have said to me\r\nthat six months stoppage of the English trade would mean the\r\nclosing up of three-fourths of the commercial and financial\r\nhouses of the country. The rapid expansion of this trade every\r\nday increases the importance of the Suez Canal and the Cape of\r\nGood Hope routes, the two channels along which Australian\r\ncommerce chiefly flows. Another field for trade is opening up in\r\nthe China seas and in India. For a people thus related to\r\nEurope, Africa, and Asia, the Eastern Question, with all that it\r\ninvolves, has a deep and permanent interest. The question of\r\nwhether Great Britain or Russia is in India and holds command of\r\nIndian waters is vital to Australia's position in the Southern\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nOn this point the _Melbourne Age_ not long since said: 'The\r\ngrowth of Australia into a nation will bring with it the burdens\r\nof a nation, among which {199} the burden of foreign relations\r\nis the worst, especially if the relationship concerns a hostile\r\npower. Australia is already concerned in the Russian advance on\r\nIndia. ...The possession of the Indian seaboard means so much to\r\nthe safety of these colonies that the mere mention of it is\r\nsufficient to awaken attention on the subject: for if the peace\r\nof Australia demands that foreign nations shall not post\r\nthemselves in the Pacific, still more vital is it that Russian\r\nguns shall not point over the Indian ocean, or Russian cruisers\r\ngather in Indian harbours. Australia shares in the danger, and\r\nis interested in meeting it, whether from the Imperial or the\r\nlocal point of view. Even as an independent state, Australia\r\ncould not afford to agree to an occupation of India by Russia;\r\nin fact, our danger would be all the greater. If the Russians\r\nreach the sea-front the menace to Australia will be intolerable,\r\nand Australia has its own interest in preventing this. The\r\ndefence of Australia begins on the hills outside Herat, and\r\nthere already the attack has begun.' I have preferred to quote\r\nan Australian opinion upon this point to giving my own.\r\n\r\nBut even the questions connected with the trade routes and India\r\ndo not exhaust the European interests of Australia. She has\r\nGermany and France at her doors, the one in New Guinea and the\r\nother at New Caledonia and the New Hebrides. With both she has\r\nhad irritating points of difference and to the presence of both\r\nin the Pacific she objects. {200} The nearness of the great\r\nDutch colonies of Java and the neighbouring islands is not now a\r\nsubject of anxiety, but should the course of European politics\r\never lead to the absorption of Holland by Germany, an apparently\r\nnot impossible contingency, the Dutch colonies would become more\r\nserious factors in Australasian affairs, for a great European\r\nnaval and military power would control a native population which\r\nnumbers 20,000,000, inhabiting islands which stretch along and\r\nlie close to the uninhabited side of Australia. The present able\r\nadministrator of New Guinea, Sir William McGregor, who has long\r\nmade a special study of the political relations of the Pacific,\r\nexpressed to me his opinion that Australasian independence, with\r\nthe consequent withdrawal of Britain's protection, would almost\r\ncertainly result in French and German efforts to secure\r\npositions in Australasia at the expense of the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe defence of her sea-borne commerce, greater in proportion to\r\npopulation, as has been said, than that of any other country in\r\nthe world, must always be a foremost thought in the Australian\r\nmind. On the conditions which will render that defence secure\r\nmilitary authorities are practically agreed. Speaking of the\r\ngreat naval stations which command the principal trade routes,\r\nMajor General Sir Bevan Edwardes said after his late careful\r\nstudy of Australian defence: 'It will thus be seen how mutually\r\ndependent the scattered parts of the Empire must necessarily be.\r\nThe mother-country in maintaining {201} these fortified stations\r\naffords direct protection to Australian interests. The Cape\r\nColony, in bearing a share in the defence of the most important\r\nof these stations, lends a hand to Australia in the event of\r\nwar. Hong Kong, Singapore, Ceylon and Mauritius, in the large\r\ncontributions they have made to defence, and the considerable\r\nannual sums applied to military purposes, are not only defending\r\nthemselves, but the interests of the whole nation, including\r\nthose of Australia. Canada, by the construction of that grand\r\nline of communication, the Canada Pacific Railway--the\r\nimportance of which will be fully shown in our next great\r\nwar--and when she has completed the defences of Esquimault, will\r\nin the same way aid in the general national defence.' He adds,\r\nand I venture to italicize his words: '_Australia, as being the\r\nmost remote of all portions of the Empire, and having the\r\nlargest trade routes, would gain more in war from the existence\r\nof these stations than any other group of colonies. The idea\r\nthat local defence will suffice for the needs of a commercial\r\ncountry, and that the interests of Australasia end with her\r\nterritorial waters, is utterly false. The real defence of the\r\nAustralasian colonies and their trade will be secured by fleets\r\nthousands of miles from their shores_[1].'\r\n\r\nOnce more, China, with its population of 400,000,000, is a close\r\nneighbour to Australia with its 4,000,000. Only narrow seas\r\nseparate them. The decisive objection felt in every part of\r\nAustralia to the immigration {202} of Chinese, and the steps\r\ntaken to prevent it, point to relations which might easily lead\r\nto serious rupture between the two countries. I have heard\r\nsober-minded Australians, including cabinet ministers, affirm\r\nthat for a long time to come Australia of itself would be\r\nabsolutely powerless to offer any adequate resistance to an\r\nirritated China if she used her considerable fleet for the\r\nannoyance of Australian commerce, or if she chose to flood with\r\na Mongolian population the vast unoccupied areas of the North\r\nand West coasts of the continent, which are incapable of defence\r\nby land forces from the colonies. The idea is sometimes brought\r\nforward in Australia that England's desire to keep on good terms\r\nwith China and Australia's resolution to prevent a large Chinese\r\nimmigration, bring Imperial and colonial interests into hopeless\r\nconflict on a fundamental point of policy. On the other hand it\r\nmay be fairly questioned whether Australia, without the weight\r\nof British influence and the strength of British ironclads\r\nbehind her, would have escaped serious consequences through her\r\nimpulsive action in denying international rights to Chinamen.\r\nBut leaving aside this question, it is still clear that so long\r\nas China is a naval power of considerable strength in seas\r\nfrequented by Australian commerce, so long Australia cannot\r\nforget her existence and neighbourhood. An independent Australia\r\nwould be compelled at once to develop a navy equal at least to\r\nthat which she meets in those seas, otherwise she would have no\r\nmeans of {203} checking or chastising the insolence of the\r\nmeanest Chinese junk which interfered with Australian trade or\r\nattacked an Australian ship.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, then, that Australia's position is far from\r\nbeing one of isolation. Conditions more different from those\r\nunder which the United States started upon their career of\r\nindependence it is difficult to imagine. Almost the last act of\r\nBritain before the Revolution was to crush the only other\r\nEuropean power which had a footing in America, and might prove a\r\nmenace to the colonies. Wolfe won at Quebec in 1759--and\r\nIndependence was declared in 1776. From 1789 till 1815 the whole\r\nof Europe was plunged, in strife so desperate that the United\r\nStates were left free to work out their own development as no\r\nnation had ever been left to do so before. Nevertheless the\r\nshort war of 1812 ruined American commerce, paralyzed industry,\r\nand closed by far the larger number of American business houses.\r\nIt showed that isolation and an ability to ward off actual\r\ninvasion did not give immunity from the calamities of war.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that two inferences, most misleading when applied\r\nto the present condition of the British world, are constantly\r\ndrawn from the results of the American Revolution, and the\r\ngrowth of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, because Britain's power in the world was not\r\nseriously affected by the loss of the American colonies, it is\r\nsupposed that she would suffer as little from the loss of those\r\nwhich she now {204} possesses. No inference could be more\r\nmistaken. When the American colonies were gone, there still\r\nremained space in which a new colonial empire could be founded;\r\nthere was still room to find bases of maritime power and\r\ncommercial influence on all the great oceans, and in both the\r\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres. England at once found it\r\nnecessary to avail herself of this opportunity. There is no\r\nchance left now to found a third colonial empire. The other\r\nnations of Europe, finding out too late for themselves the\r\nadvantage which England had gained, have appropriated what small\r\nportions were open for their occupation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the fact that the United States have in the course of a\r\ncentury grown into a world-power of the first magnitude tends to\r\nmislead the imagination in forecasting the future of the\r\ncolonies. Let Canada and Australia, it is thought, make\r\nthemselves independent, and the history of the United States\r\nwill be repeated; their greatness equalled in each case. Many\r\ncircumstances unite to make such a result impossible.\r\n\r\nFirst, the physical conditions of the countries themselves. A\r\nCanadian who has made some study of Australia may perhaps be\r\nallowed to express frankly his conviction that neither country\r\ncan possibly look forward to anything that will for a moment\r\ncompare with the extraordinary increment of population in the\r\nUnited States. He may add that to him this is a subject for\r\ncongratulation, rather than regret.\r\n\r\n{205}\r\n\r\nDelightful as are Canadian homes, and all the surroundings of\r\nCanadian life to those who understand and have been brought up\r\namong them, or to those who come from a similar climate, there\r\nis no doubt that the long winter, the short summer, and the\r\nnecessity which both impose for strenuous exertion, render the\r\ncountry unattractive to vast masses of those emigrants of less\r\nstamina who pass so freely into parts of the United States. We\r\nmay fairly hope that in the long run the race advantage of the\r\nslower growth will be great, and an abundant recompense for the\r\nless rapid increase of population.\r\n\r\nClimate is, in fact, the controlling element in a persistent\r\nprocess of natural selection. It excludes the negro from being\r\nany considerable factor in the population. The Italian\r\norgan-grinder and all his kind flee southward at the approach of\r\nwinter. Only on the Pacific coast does the Chinaman find a\r\ncongenial home. Cities like New York, St. Louis, Cincinnati, or\r\nNew Orleans attract even the vagrant population of Italy and\r\nother countries of Southern Europe: Canada, to her own ultimate\r\nadvantage, repels it. Canada will belong to the sturdy races of\r\nthe North-Saxon and Celt, Scandinavian, Dane and Northern\r\nGerman, fighting their way under conditions sometimes rather\r\nmore severe than those to which they have been accustomed in\r\ntheir old homes. Selection implies less rapid increment; quality\r\nis balanced against quantity.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles to rapid growth which Canada finds {206} in\r\nnorthern cold Australia meets with in southern heat, in a\r\ncontinental configuration which deprives the country of an\r\nadequate river system, and in isolation from European centres of\r\nemigration.\r\n\r\nThe geography of the continent presents features which must be\r\nconsidered in forecasting the future of the country. We often\r\nsee elaborate calculations, based upon the rate of increase\r\nduring the last fifty years, which are intended to prove that a\r\nrapid increment of population, parallel to that which has taken\r\nplace in the United States, may be anticipated. I found that\r\nmore prudent thinkers in Australia reject such estimates as\r\nutterly fallacious on merely physical grounds, and facts support\r\nthis different view. With a circumference of about 8000, and a\r\ndiameter of more than 2000 miles, it is very doubtful if\r\nAustralia can ever have a great city more than two or three\r\nhundred miles from the sea-shore. If Broken Hill be quoted as an\r\nexception, it would seem to confirm rather than weaken this\r\nview. A large output of silver, amounting already to many tons\r\nper week, has attracted to the spot and supports a population of\r\ntwenty-five or thirty thousand people. But even the presence of\r\nso large a population has not led to the cultivation of the\r\nsoil, and almost every article of food is brought from a\r\ndistance, while a supply of water itself is only obtained with\r\ndifficulty. During a recent period of drought, water was carried\r\nto Broken Hill by rail.\r\n\r\nIn America, as soon as the Alleghanies were {207} passed, the\r\nflood of immigration poured out upon the great river valleys of\r\nthe Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri, and the prairies of the far\r\nWest, capable of at once absorbing millions of people. Nothing\r\nof this kind is possible for Australia. There the want of water\r\nin the interior, the partly desert and partly pastoral character\r\nof the country, are limiting dense population to the rim of the\r\ncontinent. Even there it is curiously concentrated in the\r\ncities. Irrigation, with the intense culture which it makes\r\npossible, may cause a considerable change over limited areas,\r\nand artesian wells will do much to give steadiness to the\r\npastoral industry, but after all such allowances have been made\r\nit seems perfectly clear that the centre of Australia will be\r\nconquered but slowly, and will never be densely inhabited. It is\r\nhoped that by a united effort among the colonies a railway may\r\nbe thrown across the continent from North to South; one from\r\nEast to West would apparently be impracticable, and the\r\nconnection between the opposite coasts will be chiefly\r\nmaintained by Sea. Over vast areas from five to ten acres of\r\nland must be allowed for each sheep pastured, and it is doubtful\r\nif the capacity of much of this land to carry stock can be\r\nsensibly increased. The care of sheep and cattle can be carried\r\non with great profit and on an immense scale by an exceedingly\r\nlimited population, and a large part of Australia must always be\r\nchiefly pastoral. I suspect that in the mining industry also the\r\nproportion of workers to the volume of production {208} is\r\ncomparatively small. Three hundred millions of gold taken from\r\nthe soil since the first discovery of the precious metal less\r\nthan fifty years ago, and vast public and private borrowings in\r\naddition of outside capital have given a great impulse to\r\nsettlement in the past. But the conditions of the last half\r\ncentury have clearly been abnormal, and can scarcely be taken as\r\nan index of the future.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other aspects of Australian life which mark\r\nthis contrast with America even more decisively than do the\r\nprevailing industries and physical conditions to which I have\r\nreferred. The coloured element, which in the United States now\r\nnumbers about 8,000,000, and forms so large a fraction of the\r\nwhole population, Australia rejects entirely. Neither Chinaman,\r\nHindoo coolie, nor Kanaka will ever be permitted to become to\r\nAustralia what the negro is to the United States, a considerable\r\nand permanent addition to dense population. Scarcely less strong\r\nis the objection to the indiscriminate immigration of cheap\r\ncompetitive labour such as that which has filled up America. The\r\narrival at Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane of half a dozen\r\nsteamships with a living freight such as has been discharged at\r\nNew York from the steerage of Trans-atlantic liners almost every\r\nday for the last quarter of a century would today bring New\r\nSouth Wales, Victoria, or Queensland to the edge of revolution.\r\nAssisted emigration has come to an end, save in the two younger\r\ncolonies. For years {209} the great trans-continental Railway\r\ncompanies and Trans-atlantic steamship companies of the United\r\nStates have acted as the most energetic emigration agencies in\r\nevery country of Europe, with the one object of pouring a flood\r\nof population, without the slightest reference to its quality,\r\nover the lands lying along the newly built Railway lines. An\r\nAustralian Government which tried in this manner to make its\r\nState-built Railways productive, would soon find its occupation\r\nof governing gone.\r\n\r\nThat 'pulling in of the latch string' and closing the door which\r\nthe United States have decided upon reluctantly and late,\r\nAustralia has begun almost at the commencement of her career.\r\nShe has determined that her population shall be select. This\r\npolicy exposes the working man of Australia to the sarcasm that\r\nhe is quite prepared to repeat in his vast continent that\r\nselfishness in respect of land which he is rather fond of\r\ndenouncing in the landlord of the old world. On the other hand,\r\nthe United Kingdom has, early and late, sent too many social\r\nfailures to Australia to justify either surprise or indignation\r\nat Australia's aversion to unacceptable immigration. We need not\r\nquarrel with Australia's decision in this matter, for it is one\r\nwhich a country has a right to make. It secures more perfect\r\nsocial and political assimilation of new material and avoids the\r\ngreat dangers which flow from placing large political powers in\r\nhands unfitted to use them. But if select, then not vast in\r\nnumbers. Judging from present indications and {210} tendencies\r\nAustralia is likely to have settled along its seaboard a slowly\r\nincreasing but singularly wealthy population, whose prosperity\r\nwill be ministered to by the highly remunerative mining and\r\npastoral industries of the thinly settled interior.\r\n\r\nThis sea-board of the continent, the rim of which alone is or is\r\nlikely to be thickly settled is 8000 miles long. A country so\r\nsituated and populated is manifestly exposed, in an unusual\r\ndegree, to naval attack. It is this sense of exposure which has\r\nin large measure promoted the idea of Federation among the\r\ncolonies themselves. It has stimulated the work of harbour\r\ndefence, important for the whole Empire as for Australia itself.\r\nIt has led to the joint arrangement between the mother-land and\r\nthe various colonies for an addition to the Australian Squadron.\r\nThe terms of this arrangement are worthy of note. The various\r\ncolonies jointly agree to contribute the sum of £126,000 per\r\nannum, partly as interest on the capital employed in\r\nconstruction, partly towards the maintenance of a certain number\r\nof armed ships to be reserved exclusively for service in\r\nAustralian waters. To carry out this arrangement the amount\r\ninvested by the mother-country in the ships, seven in number,\r\nalready constructed and in active service, has been close upon a\r\nmillion sterling. The skilled officers and trained seamen are\r\nalso supplied from the Royal Navy. It is specially agreed that\r\nany expense incurred beyond £126,000 shall be borne by the\r\nImperial Treasury, that the ordinary strength {211} of the\r\nAustralian Squadron shall not be reduced on account of this\r\nlocal addition to naval defence, and that during the ten years\r\nover which the arrangement extends the seven ships cannot be\r\nwithdrawn from Australian waters. Surely no young country with\r\nan increasing necessity for coast defence due to enlarged wealth\r\nand commerce ever secured it on terms to compare with these. No\r\nbetter illustration could be given of the advantage which the\r\ncolonies may derive from joint action with the mother-land.\r\n\r\nThe Australasian colonies aspire, and reasonably aspire, to\r\ndominance in the Pacific. That manifestly depends on having at\r\ncommand the naval power which can be best secured by\r\nco-operation with the Empire. The creation of substantial\r\ninterests in the heart of the Pacific, such as would be involved\r\nin the construction of cable, postal and commercial routes,\r\nlinking Australia and New Zealand with Canada in one direction,\r\nwith the West Indies and Great Britain in another (when the\r\nPanama route is open), interests which the whole Empire would be\r\nconcerned in securing, would do more than anything else to give\r\neffect to Australian aspirations.\r\n\r\nHowever threatening or annoying the presence of Germany and\r\nFrance in the Southern Seas might be to an independent Australia\r\nbefore she had arisen to a position of great naval strength, I\r\ncannot but think that every German and French station in the\r\nPacific, so long as the Empire remains one, is a guarantee of\r\npeace. So overwhelming would be the advantage {212} in naval and\r\ncoaling bases, and in reserves of fighting force, enjoyed by a\r\nunited British people in those seas, that any European nation\r\ncould not but expect that a declaration of war against the\r\nBritish Empire would be followed by an immediate attempt on our\r\npart to sweep the enemy from the few ports which he might hold\r\nin the Pacific; and it cannot be doubted that such an attempt\r\nwould be made with every probability of success.\r\n\r\nThere are those who think that Australian Federation will not\r\nmake for British unity, but will instead prove the prelude to\r\nAustralian Independence. I believe that this is an entirely\r\nmistaken view. But were it true; did the choice for Australians\r\nlie between Federation with the Empire and Federation among the\r\ncolonies themselves, I unhesitatingly say that the true course\r\nwould be to accept the latter. Until Australia can act and speak\r\nas a unit, she is incapable of deciding wisely and conclusively\r\nupon her own destiny; she is not in a position to take her right\r\nplace and exert her due influence in a federation of nations. A\r\nnumber of colonies grouped as are those of Australia, which\r\nfailed to see the advantage of a common political life, or were\r\nunwilling to make the sacrifices necessary to secure it, would\r\nremain in a state of political unrest and incomplete development\r\nwhich would render them a weakness rather than a strength in a\r\ngreat national combination. Much as I believe in the advantages\r\nwhich would come to Australia, to the other colonies, to Great\r\nBritain and {213} to the world at large from British unity, I\r\nyet am convinced that it would be better that Australia should\r\nbe isolated from the Empire than that she should be divided\r\nwithin her own boundaries. This opinion is entertained, I feel\r\nsure, by ninety-nine out of every hundred advocates of a United\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, however, confederation has not had the effect of\r\nweakening attachment to the Empire. By giving the people a\r\nlarger political judgment it has made them weigh more seriously\r\nthe responsibilities of national existence and made them value\r\nmore highly connection with a powerful state.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the contest going on in Australia is the best of all\r\npreparations for the acceptance of the wider idea of national\r\nunity, since it leads to the accurate definition of principles,\r\nand a careful balancing of the gain and loss involved in large\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nCanadian experience leads us to think that Australian Federation\r\nwould lend itself to national union in another way. In Canada\r\nbefore 1867, the date of Confederation, the Colonial Office was\r\ncontinually appearing as a factor in provincial politics.\r\nWhatever trouble arose, Downing Street was to blame, and party\r\npassion vented all its bitterness upon this official\r\nrepresentative of England's policy. It is safe to say that\r\nConfederation eliminated the Colonial Office as an active, or at\r\nany rate, an irritating factor from Canadian party politics. It\r\nwas found that by far the larger number of those questions which\r\ngave rise {214} to friction with the Colonial Office were\r\ntransferred to the domain of the Dominion government; that the\r\ndifficulties were such as were necessarily incident to the\r\nmanagement of a large state; that Canadians had to fight out\r\namong themselves disputes once fought out with an English\r\nminister. It is a striking fact that since Canada attained to a\r\nunited voice on public questions, since confederation imposed\r\nupon her the necessity of dealing with internal difficulties and\r\nforming a large judgment on common affairs, not only has no\r\nserious difficulty arisen with the Colonial Office, but the\r\ndeliberately expressed opinion of the Canadian Government has,\r\nas a rule, given a general direction to British policy in\r\ndealing with external matters which concerned Canada.\r\n\r\nIn one or two of the Australian colonies the Colonial Office is\r\nstill heard of occasionally as it was in Canada thirty or forty\r\nyears ago; the Colonial Secretary of the day is a frequent\r\nsubject of political lampoon; denunciation of his policy is a\r\npart of the stock-in-trade of the party politician. To say that\r\nthis denunciation is affected rather than real is not enough; it\r\nis at times a very real irritant between English and Australian\r\nfeeling. The federation of Australia will, in my opinion, remove\r\nthis irritant as federation did in Canada, and by eliminating\r\npetty differences enable people to take larger views and have\r\nfewer suspicions in national affairs. If the Federal Government\r\nof Australia reserve the right, as Canada has done, to appoint\r\nthe governors of provinces, there will {215} be no opportunity\r\nfor disputes such as that which arose with Queensland a few\r\nyears ago. If the right be not reserved, a colony will have\r\nlittle room to complain about the manner of its exercise by the\r\nColonial office.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out the interest which it seems to me the\r\nAustralian colonies have in all matters which affect the rule of\r\nthe Empire in the East, and especially in the question whether\r\nBritain or Russia is in India. Military authorities, on the\r\nother hand, are agreed, and the fact is, indeed, manifest to any\r\nobserver, that in the event of a great struggle for the\r\npossession of India, the advantage for the Empire as a whole\r\nwould be immeasurable in having behind India the colonies of\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, as a base of supply and support, even\r\nif they did not send a man into the field. The suggested\r\ncreation of a great national arsenal in one of the southern\r\ncolonies as a safe source of rapid supply of war material in\r\ncase of any temporary break in the connection of India and the\r\ncolonies with the United Kingdom is a proposal which recommends\r\nitself to the common sense of British people, who will have more\r\nat stake in the next great war than any nation ever risked\r\nbefore. In the single matter of equipping cavalry the colonies\r\nmight well turn the scale in an Eastern war. Already both New\r\nZealand and Australia export horses in considerable numbers to\r\nIndia, and indeed already furnish the bulk of the remounts for\r\nour Indian cavalry. The surplus stock {216} to be drawn upon is\r\nbecoming great enough to stand almost any drain, and with the\r\nattention now given in the colonies to horse breeding quality is\r\nconstantly improving. The command of men which the nation has in\r\nIndia, and of horses in Australia, would counterbalance anything\r\nthat Russia can draw from the steppes of Tartary.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of food supplies, too, the colonies might play an\r\nimportant part. Army contracts for tinned meats are now filled\r\nby the great meat preserving factories, and the capacity of the\r\nvast pastures of Queensland and the farms of New Zealand to\r\nfurnish food of this kind is practically unlimited. There\r\nremains to be noticed one all-important fact. The original\r\nacquisition of India, as the highest authorities now admit,\r\ndepended upon Britain's easy access to its coasts by sea. With\r\nthe Australian colonies and South Africa under the national flag\r\nthat access could be easily maintained in the face of all\r\ncomers. The permanence of the British position in India may be\r\nconsidered as resting very largely on this issue.\r\n\r\nWhether in a critical contest for the possession of India\r\nAustralia would contribute men, as well as supplies, may be left\r\nto conjecture. But looking at all that would be at stake for the\r\ncolonies of the South, the failure to respond to a real call of\r\nneed against Russia would indicate some falling off in that\r\n'saving common sense' which has hitherto inclined British people\r\nto challenge enemies on the furthest {217} frontier rather than\r\nawait them at their own doors. An Australian opinion has already\r\nbeen given upon this subject. A contingent of Australian troops\r\nsent to the Soudan may be put to the credit of impulsive\r\nnational enthusiasm; a contingent one day on the frontier of\r\nAfghanistan might well be the outcome of deliberate and\r\nfar-sighted Australian policy.\r\n\r\nI attach very little importance to the opinion, sometimes\r\nexpressed, that in view of the rapid increase of a native-born\r\npopulation in Australia, any measures looking towards national\r\nunity should be hurried forward before the generation born in\r\nthe United Kingdom had passed away or lost its controlling\r\ninfluence. Other reasons there are for early movement, but not\r\nthis one. The idea of national unity must win on its own merits.\r\nThe growth of a native-born population may or may not make for\r\nconsolidation, but it is on the judgment and sentiment of such a\r\npopulation that the strength of any union must ultimately\r\ndepend. Meanwhile we may remember that four-fifths of the\r\npopulation of Canada is native-born; the fact has not weakened\r\nin the slightest degree the closeness of sympathy with Great\r\nBritain and the Empire.\r\n\r\nOf the many ardent advocates of national unity, everywhere\r\nscattered throughout the Dominion, by far the larger proportion\r\nconsists of native Canadians. So I believe it will ultimately be\r\nin Australia. The longer history of Canada, the more severe\r\nconditions of that history, seem to me to have given a greater\r\n{218} maturity and definiteness of political thought in Canada\r\nthan in Australia.\r\n\r\nIt was often pointed out to me in Australia, by the older\r\ninhabitants, and particularly the older politicians, that among\r\nthe un-travelled younger people of the colonies there was at\r\npresent an extraordinarily exaggerated opinion of the absolute\r\nand relative importance of Australia in the world. A stranger\r\nnaturally hesitates to generalize on the truth of such a\r\ncriticism, though marking individual illustrations. I had the\r\nprivilege of addressing a gathering of young men of the Sydney\r\nUniversity. In a debate which followed one of the students\r\nasked: 'What single thing have people in England better than we\r\nAustralians have here?' The manifest sincerity with which the\r\nquestion was asked made the remark deeply interesting--almost\r\ntouching. The attitude of mind is accounted for by the lack of\r\nsome standard of comparison close at hand. England has measured\r\nher strength with too many rivals to overrate her place in the\r\nworld. Canada has had a great neighbour to force upon her a\r\nsense of proportion. The United States themselves emerged from\r\nthe great war of Secession with a temper curiously modest and\r\nmoderate as compared with the spread-eagleism which prevailed in\r\nthe years when the country had known little but continuous\r\nprosperity, when its strength had not been tested by trial, and\r\nwhen a republican form of government was supposed to be a\r\nguarantee against all the ills from which monarchies were wont\r\nto suffer. {219} The remarkable conditions under which Australia\r\nhas been developed, with no strong native races against which to\r\nstruggle--with external enemies kept at a distance by British\r\nironclads, or by fear of the British name, and with suddenly\r\ngained wealth almost without precedent in history--sufficiently\r\naccount for any over-confident attitude on the part of very\r\nyoung Australians. This, time is sure to rectify. Political\r\nexperience gives political perspective. Out-side of this it\r\nwould be difficult to discover anything in the mass of\r\nAustralians to indicate that they were likely to be different\r\nfrom Englishmen or Canadians in loyalty to a large nationality.\r\nI say the mass of Australians, for it would be idle to ignore\r\nthe fact that another current of thought exists.\r\n\r\nIn two of the Australian colonies, New South Wales and\r\nQueensland, some journals are found which make it their business\r\nto cultivate an anti-British and separatist feeling, and it must\r\nbe admitted that they give themselves to their task with great\r\nand unflagging energy. It is very difficult to estimate\r\naccurately the range of their influence. I found the most\r\ndivergent opinions held upon the point by well-informed\r\nAustralians themselves, some looking upon them, and the idea\r\nwhich they represented, as forces that would have to be reckoned\r\nwith in the future: others regarding them as unworthy of notice,\r\nand without any permanent influence. Certainly in strength of\r\nlanguage they have no parallel in any other part of the British\r\nworld, or in the United States. British people {220} outside of\r\nAustralia may be interested in knowing something of their tone\r\nand aim. I select a comparatively moderate passage. 'What does\r\nit [British Federation] offer us in exchange for our ideals and\r\nour aspirations, and our sympathies and our interests? ... It\r\noffers us only an unwieldy Empire, crusted over with fungi,\r\nrotting with inequalities, governed by a class which is blown\r\nout with Privilege and Pride, that ignores the Spirit of the Age\r\nand clings to the brutal Past. In this Empire our Australia will\r\nbe swamped, under it she would be buried; in it our inspiration\r\nto lift again the torch of Liberty would be smothered and\r\ndrowned. We do not want it and we will not have it. Our\r\nAustralia shall be as free from foreign control as is the\r\nsunshine that the Australian loves; as is the billowing sea that\r\nsurges eternally around her shores. She shall in herself be\r\ncomplete, in sympathy with all, in dependence upon none. ... We\r\nhave no interest in British Trade and still less in the\r\nmaintenance of the Empire. We do not care who owns India; we\r\nhope that if any more opium wars come about the white ensign\r\nwill be blown out of Chinese waters; nothing would please us\r\nbetter than to hear that the Spaniards had retaken Gibraltar and\r\nthe Germans Heligoland and that the huge facade of commercial\r\naggression and oligarchic robbery had come down with a crash.'\r\n\r\nThis passage fairly represents a kind of political pabulum which\r\nis dealt out very freely and finds an audience in Sydney and\r\nBrisbane. For the most {221} part it is furnished, not by native\r\nAustralians, but by imported talent. In Sydney a higher grade of\r\nnewspaper freely discusses the question of separation from the\r\nEmpire, with a distinct inclination towards independence as the\r\ntrue Australian ideal.\r\n\r\nAt a public meeting which I addressed in Sydney the statement of\r\nthe arguments for British unity met with what seemed to me a\r\ndistinctly unfriendly reception. The case stands quite alone in\r\nmy experience of the British world. I was, however, to my\r\nsurprise assured by leading men who were present that the\r\nhearing given me was, for Sydney, a very good one. If so, the\r\nlot of a public man in New South Wales is not an enviable one.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting Mr. Buchanan of the Legislative Council moved,\r\nand Mr. Traill of the Legislative Assembly seconded, a\r\nresolution, affirming that 'the natural and inevitable tendency\r\nof the Australian colonies is to unite and form among themselves\r\none free and independent nation.' I give the names of the mover\r\nand seconder that the weight or weakness of their support of\r\nsuch a resolution may be justly estimated by those competent to\r\njudge. In comment upon the occurrence the leading Sydney\r\njournal, while repudiating any sympathy with the display of\r\nSeparatist feeling, said, 'the fact is patent that within the\r\nlast few years the opponents of closer union, even the advocates\r\nof separation, have gathered courage, spoken more boldly, and\r\ntaken an aggressive attitude.' Australians therefore know what\r\nthey have to deal {222} with. Mr. Dibbs, the present premier of\r\nNew South Wales, has used expressions that indicate a wish for\r\nor an expectation of Australian independence. On the other hand,\r\namong the great majority of leading men in the colony, including\r\nnative Australians of prominence and conspicuous ability, such\r\nas Mr. Barton and Mr. Reid, the opinion appeared general that\r\nseparation from the Empire would mean for Australia 'all loss\r\nand no gain.' At the Sydney conference of 1891 the voice of Sir\r\nHenry Parkes was as decisive for permanent unity with the Empire\r\nas was that of Sir John Macdonald at Quebec in 1864.\r\n\r\nMaking all allowance, however, for division of opinion in\r\nSydney, it must be remembered that New South Wales by no means\r\nrepresents all Australia.\r\n\r\nIf large and enthusiastic meetings, the hearty support of an\r\ninfluential and exceptionally able press, and the cordial\r\napproval of the clearest thinkers form a sufficient index to\r\npopular opinion, then one is justified in saying that the idea\r\nof national unity appeals strongly to the sentiment and to the\r\nreasoned conviction of the people of the next great colony,\r\nVictoria. The dominating energy of Victoria has extended its\r\ninterests to every corner of the Australian continent. Its\r\nbusiness connection with the mother-land is more important and\r\nintimate than that of any other colony. Hence the outlook on\r\nnational questions is wide, and Victoria would steadily resist\r\nany tendency to separation from the Empire. The same may be\r\nsaid, I think, of South Australia, where the press is\r\nconspicuous {223} for its able and temperate discussion of\r\nnational questions and where the prominent leaders of opinion\r\nare sincere believers in the permanent unity of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIn Queensland, as is well known, there has been in past years\r\nmuch talk of separation, chiefly arising from friction with the\r\nColonial office being made a factor in local party conflicts.\r\nFor some time Queensland refused to share in the expense for\r\nnaval defence undertaken by the other colonies, the contribution\r\nfor that purpose being denounced as 'tribute.' Later and wiser\r\nthought has reversed this decision. From its long coast-line and\r\nthe immediate proximity of settlements formed by other nations,\r\nQueensland has more interest than any other colony in naval\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of exposure to attack prompted the attempted\r\nannexation of the whole of New Guinea, and explains the intense\r\nannoyance felt in Queensland at the refusal of the Colonial\r\noffice to sanction that annexation. The necessity for naval\r\nprotection is a permanent condition, and will probably dominate\r\nthe political thought of Queensland even more than of the rest\r\nof Australia. In Rockhampton I had the opportunity of\r\ndiscussing, the question with a large and sympathetic audience,\r\nand in other parts of Queensland as well as there with leading\r\npoliticians and journalists. Despite the superficial talk about\r\nseparation, I doubt if in any colony of the Empire is the value\r\nof a great national connection more thoroughly understood by\r\nthose who really dominate the policy of the colony.\r\n\r\n{224}\r\n\r\nTaking the Australian continent as a whole I think it is a fair\r\nestimate to say that in every one of the colonies there is an\r\noverwhelming majority who would favour permanent connection with\r\nthe Empire. On the other hand it is quite certain that in some\r\nof the colonies there is an active and aggressive minority\r\nenergetically working for ultimate separation. It is for\r\nAustralians and Australians alone to decide between these\r\nconflicting ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTASMANIA.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Tasmania is comparatively small, but its insular\r\nposition makes it one of the critical points in Australian\r\ndefence. Up to the present time owing to the small population\r\nand revenue, its principal harbours have been less strongly\r\nfortified than those of Australia, and military authorities have\r\nconstantly urged greater attention to its defences upon the\r\nground that by seizing positions here an enemy might find means\r\nof coal supply and a base from which to attack Australia. Upon\r\nthis point the report of General Edwards was most emphatic. The\r\nisland is within three days' steaming distance from Adelaide,\r\none from Melbourne, two and a half from Sydney and four from New\r\nZealand. With several fine harbours, a soil and climate equal to\r\nany in the world, a considerable coal supply, and as yet only a\r\nlimited population to resist attack, Tasmania {225} would\r\npresent to any hostile power not merely an opportunity but\r\nalmost a temptation to establish a Gibraltar in the Southern\r\nseas. Tasmania has strong commercial reasons for wishing to\r\nfederate with Australia. On the other hand in an Australian\r\nfederation she would have the strongest reasons for opposing\r\nseparation from the mother-country. Like New Zealand, she\r\ndepends for safety upon naval defence, a defence she could not\r\nreceive from the colonies of the continent.\r\n\r\nSo far as it is possible to judge from external indications the\r\nopinion of this small but strategically most important colony is\r\nalmost entirely in favour of close and permanent connection with\r\nthe Empire. During discussion on the subject carried on in the\r\nprincipal centres of population, and extending over some weeks,\r\nI found that the idea of British unity was heartily supported by\r\neveryone of the leading newspapers, and by most of the principal\r\npublic men, including the leaders of the Government and\r\nOpposition. Opposing ideas have their representatives in a small\r\ngroup of sincere republicans, headed by the present\r\nAttorney-General, the Hon. A. Inglis Clark. The republicanism of\r\nthis small party was the more interesting, as it seemed to me\r\nquite unconnected with and superior to the irrational and bitter\r\nanti-British feeling which occasionally finds expression in one\r\nor two of the Australian colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n{226}\r\n\r\nNEW ZEALAND\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand I found among politicians, journalists, and the\r\npublic generally, a remarkable consensus of opinion that the\r\ncircumstances of that colony would always compel it to regard\r\nquestions of national defence and consolidation from its own\r\npoint of view, and in a large measure independently of\r\nAustralia. Facts justify this attitude. New Zealand is 1000\r\nmiles long and nowhere more than 150 broad. Cut in two by a\r\nbroad strait and penetrated by numerous bays and inlets, it has\r\n3000 miles of coast line, and is therefore more exposed from a\r\nnaval point of view than any other equally fertile, wealthy, and\r\nthinly settled country in the world. That it is an outlying part\r\nof Australia is an illusion left on many minds from a casual\r\nglance at small maps of the Southern Hemisphere, but the\r\nillusion vanishes the moment we visit the country or consider\r\nthe facts. Twelve hundred miles of open sea separate it from\r\nAustralia. The trade between the two is growing, but it is\r\ninsignificant compared with the flood of commerce which pours\r\nfrom each towards Britain. The similarity of production will\r\nprobably make this a permanent condition, save when drought\r\ncompels Australia to look to New Zealand for food supplies.\r\nBritain is New Zealand's one great market, and it has become a\r\nmore steady and reliable market from the means which have been\r\ndevised to transfer the perishable produce of New Zealand farms\r\nto the {227} British consumer. Meanwhile, in her isolated\r\nposition only naval power can give the colony adequate defence.\r\nThe states of Australia can give effective support to each\r\nother--they cannot give it to New Zealand until they possess a\r\nfleet sufficient to command the Southern seas, and such a fleet\r\nthey will not possess at any time within the range of present\r\npolitical calculation. Among reflective men in New Zealand one\r\nfinds no readiness to believe that geographical isolation could\r\nbe relied upon for giving military security, an idea which has\r\nconsiderable vogue in parts of Australia. 'I see that the\r\ntendency of enterprize and science is every year more to\r\nannihilate space, and space will be annihilated for purposes of\r\nwar as well as peace, and the distance of the colonies from\r\nthose who may attack them every year becomes less and less of a\r\nprotection to them.' These words of Lord Salisbury express not\r\ninaccurately, I think, the prevailing thought of all serious\r\npoliticans in New Zealand in regard to their country. The\r\nfeeling is strengthened by a further consideration. New Zealand\r\nhas already a good deal of trade with the scattered islands of\r\nthe Pacific. This trade is likely to have a large development as\r\ntime goes on. At any rate New Zealanders have formed a very\r\ndefinite ambition to acquire a large commercial connection and\r\npowerful influence in the Pacific, an ambition which can\r\nscarcely be realized unless its commercial interests have\r\nadequate naval support.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of the kind I have mentioned explain {228} the\r\ncomparative indifference of the colony to Australian federation,\r\nwhich would never satisfy her necessities except as subsidiary\r\nto the larger national union. They explain the fairly unanimous\r\nsupport which her ablest public men have given to the general\r\nprinciple of national Federation. Mr. Ballance, the Liberal\r\nPremier of New Zealand, said in the House of Representatives, in\r\na discussion which took place prior to the Australasian Federal\r\nConvention at Sydney, that 'Imperial Federation, with a free\r\nmanagement of its own affairs as at present, was the only future\r\nhe would look to for the colony.' Equally strong expressions\r\ncould be gathered from the speeches or writings of most of the\r\nleading men of New Zealand. The fear lest Australian Federation\r\nmight ultimately lead to separation from the Empire was publicly\r\nand expressly assigned as a reason why New Zealand should not be\r\na part of the Australian commonwealth. Inside an Australasian\r\nFederation New Zealand's influence would be steadily thrown in\r\nfavour of British national unity. On the other hand, should\r\nAustralia ever move towards separation--an improbable\r\ncontingency, but one often suggested by a few of her journalists\r\nand public men--the advantage in prestige and more practical\r\nways which New Zealand would derive from retaining the wide\r\nnational connection, and becoming the centre of the Empire's\r\nnaval strength in the Southern seas, would infinitely outweigh\r\nanything Australia could possibly offer, and would decide the\r\ncourse to which {229} self-interest even now points. The\r\nindividual interest which New Zealand thus holds towards the\r\nquestion is very significant, and worthy of careful attention.\r\nPlaced in the centre of the water hemisphere of the globe this\r\n'Britain of the South' seems the precise complement of the\r\nmother-country at the centre of the land hemisphere, while a\r\nconjunction of circumstances,--the possession of excellent\r\nharbours, already very fairly defended, and easily made\r\nimpregnable, a plentiful supply of coal, timber, and metals, a\r\nclimate which never fails to favour abundant crops, and\r\nnourishes a sturdy race,--fits the country to be the opposite\r\npole of the Oceanic Empire which Britain has created. Distance\r\nmight be supposed to have lessened commercial intercourse with\r\nthe mother-land; as a matter of fact it is greater in proportion\r\nto wealth and population than that of any other country. Roughly\r\nputting the exports of New Zealand at £10,000,000 per annum,\r\n£7,000,000 go to Great Britain, £2,250,000 to other parts of the\r\nEmpire, and only the small remaining balance to other countries.\r\nThe proportion of imports is not widely different. Community of\r\ninterest could scarcely be greater than this. The safety of this\r\ntrade, too, is of the very essence of the prosperity, one might\r\nalmost say of the commercial life of the country. Its stoppage\r\nwould mean financial and industrial paralysis. We have therefore\r\nsome measure of what the security guaranteed by the greatest\r\nnaval power in the world means to New Zealand.\r\n\r\n{230}\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it would be difficult to exaggerate the\r\nadvantage which such a power would derive in war from the\r\nexclusive use of this halfway place in the voyage around the\r\nworld. Auckland, Lyttleton, Wellington and Dunedin all have\r\nexcellent harbours. The fortifications which protect them,\r\nconstructed and equipped at the expense of the colony itself,\r\nare, says General Edwards in his report 'well planned, and the\r\narmaments are sufficient to repel the attack of several\r\ncruisers, provided the defence is properly organized and\r\ncompetent officers appointed to command.' Thus they furnish a\r\ncomparatively secure retreat for ships of commerce or of war.\r\nAuckland and Lyttleton have docks, that at Auckland being\r\ncapacious enough to receive for repair the largest ship of war\r\nafloat. Even now the vessels of France, Germany and other\r\nnations call here to coal, victual, or repair, finding such\r\nstations as Samoa or Noumea but poor bases from which to\r\noperate. The advantage to a nation holding these ports in time\r\nof war would be overwhelming. It would scarcely be diminished\r\neven if Australia should become independent. Other powers, if\r\nthey respected Australia's independence, could not use her ports\r\nas a base of attack, and at the utmost could only demand the\r\nrights of neutrals which would be of little use in a serious\r\nconflict with Britain while retaining the exclusive possession\r\nof New Zealand. The defection of one or two of the Australian\r\ncolonies, or even of the whole continent, would weaken {231} the\r\nchain of the Empire's maritime position, but would not create in\r\nit a fatal flaw, so long as New Zealand remains faithful to the\r\nnational allegiance. The practically undivided sentiment of her\r\npeople and her own supreme interests alike incline her in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Address before Royal Colonial Institute_--_March_, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE who claim that the separation from the Empire of any one\r\nof our three groups of great colonies would inflict a serious if\r\nnot a fatal blow on our national greatness and the prosperity of\r\nBritish people--point with no slight interest to the\r\nillustration of their argument which is furnished by South\r\nAfrica. Here, again, we have under the British flag a country of\r\nvast extent and favourable for European occupation. The\r\ninstitutions of self-government are already established over a\r\nwide area, and are being gradually extended. A confederation of\r\nall the South African provinces is already in the thought of\r\npractical statesmen. We have here, then, the probability of the\r\nformation of another power, so large that a merely colonial\r\nposition cannot be expected to satisfy its ultimate political\r\nnecessities. Though at present far inferior to Canada and\r\nAustralia in population, and behind them in fulness of\r\nconstitutional development, it is moving along the same lines of\r\npolitical growth, and circumstances may at any time lead to a\r\nrapid increase of population. Most of the arguments, therefore,\r\nwhich are used, in, {233} favour of Canadian or Australian\r\nseparation apply to South Africa as well. If an independent\r\ngovernment, a separate foreign policy, a distinct system of\r\ndefence, an individual diplomatic relation to the rest of the\r\nworld, is a political necessity for Australia, New Zealand, or\r\nCanada, it is clearly an equal necessity for South Africa. The\r\ninternal impulse towards independence might even be expected to\r\nbe exceptionally strong, since a considerable fraction of the\r\nwhite population is not British by descent, and has been led by\r\ncircumstances to feel a peculiar sensitiveness in regard to\r\npolitical rights.\r\n\r\nIs then the retention of South Africa under the national flag,\r\nand within the national system, a matter of indifference to\r\nBritish people either at home or abroad? Is the separation of\r\nSouth Africa, its freedom to associate itself with any power it\r\npleases, or even its being placed in a position where British\r\npeople could only enjoy or be granted neutral rights in its\r\nharbours, a condition of things which can be discussed with\r\nequanimity by Australians, New Zealanders, East Indians, nay,\r\neven by Canadians with their great ocean interests, to say\r\nnothing of the people of the United Kingdom itself? The test\r\nwhich South Africa applies to separatist theories seems to me a\r\ncrucial one.\r\n\r\nOnce more I cannot do better than quote from the 'Problems of\r\nGreater Britain.'\r\n\r\nThe author says: 'Considered from the Imperial, from the Indian,\r\nand from the Australian point {234} of view, as an aid to our\r\nmaritime power, no spot on earth is more important to us than\r\nthe Cape with its twin harbours Table Bay and Simon's Bay.' And\r\nagain: 'While a general hostility to our rule would be\r\nsufficient to make us part with almost any other colony, it is\r\nimpossible for us to give up the military station which we\r\noccupy at the extremity of the African continent and which\r\nitself cannot be held unless we hold at all events a portion of\r\nthe country round it.'\r\n\r\nNo one who considers the geographical position of the Cape, and\r\nits relation to the greatest trade route of the Empire, can\r\nregard these utterances as exaggerated. The Cape is, and must\r\nalways be, one of the greatest turning places of the world's\r\ncommerce. Between St. Helena and Mauritius for the Indian bound\r\nships, between St. Helena and King George's Sound for those\r\ngoing towards the Southern seas, the Cape is the only sufficient\r\nresting-place that European ships can find.\r\n\r\n'As a vessel steaming from British ports for India, or China, or\r\nAustralia, in time of war begins to approach the point of\r\nexhaustion of its coal supply it finds itself in a region of\r\nstorms, far from any shelter except that at the Cape of Good\r\nHope. The position of that refuge, and the certainty of being\r\nable to deny it to an enemy, combined with the command of the\r\nRed Sea route, even if only for the purpose of stopping it,\r\ndraws therefore, on behalf of England, an almost impassable line\r\non this side of the globe {235} between the Eastern and the\r\nWestern Hemispheres. The difficulty which our ownership of the\r\nCape places in the way of possible opponents, even more than the\r\nrefuge afforded to our ships, constitutes in war the supreme\r\nadvantage of the possession of the Cape of Good Hope as a naval\r\nstation[1].'\r\n\r\nSuch being the relation of South Africa to the Empire, such the\r\nimportance of its remaining under the British flag, we may well\r\nask, with some anxiety, whether the feelings of its people and\r\nthe interests of the colony point in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the leading men of South Africa towards the idea\r\nof national unity is clearly defined. Mr. Hofmeyer, the leader\r\nof the Dutch or Afrikander party, at the colonial conference of\r\n1887, brought forward, and earnestly pressed upon the assembled\r\ndelegates, a scheme for 'promoting a closer union between the\r\nvarious parts of the British Empire by means of an imperial\r\ntariff of customs.' His words indicate the temper of mind in\r\nwhich he addresses himself to the question: 'I have taken this\r\nmatter in hand with two objects: to promote the union of the\r\nEmpire, and at the same time to obtain revenue for the purpose\r\nof general defence.'\r\n\r\nSir Gordon Sprigg, for many years Premier of Cape Colony,\r\nspeaking in London in 1891, strongly advocated a similar policy,\r\nand was urgent, to quote his own words, 'that an invitation\r\nshould be addressed to the governments of the various colonies\r\nand dependencies {236} to send representatives to this country\r\nto consider, in a conference, the practicability of forming a\r\ncommercial union between the different parts of the Empire,'\r\nregarding this as the most effectual way of accomplishing what\r\nhe considered should be the aim of national statesmanship, viz.\r\nthe unification of national interests.\r\n\r\nThe present Premier of Cape Colony, and the most influential man\r\nin South Africa, Mr. Cecil Rhodes, has stated that he looks upon\r\nthe consolidation of the different colonies of South Africa as\r\nthe main aim of his political life, but at the same time his\r\nutterances, from the beginning of his political career to the\r\npresent moment, indicate conclusively that he only thinks of a\r\nunited South Africa as an integral part of a united Empire, so\r\nconstituted as to give adequate expression to the aims of its\r\nvarious members. It is interesting to find that these three men,\r\nwho may be taken as representing the different sides of South\r\nAfrican feeling, all eminently practical, and all above a\r\nsuspicion of subjecting the interest of the colony to the\r\ninterest of the nation at large, are agreed in the belief that\r\nthe best future for their country is close association with the\r\nmother-land, and the Empire. And looking at the facts of the\r\nsituation, from a South African point of view, who can doubt\r\nthat they are justified? Pressing upon British South Africa on\r\nall sides are the nations of Europe. France is in Madagascar.\r\nBordering on British territories are those of Germany and\r\nPortugal. {237} The Dutch Republics, as yet only half won to\r\nfriendliness and sympathy, are close at hand. Large native\r\npopulations--which do not fade away, as in America, New Zealand,\r\nor Australia at the approach of the white man, but rather\r\nmultiply under influences which make for peace--are all around.\r\nThe development of a great continent overflowing with stores of\r\nwealth depends not only on the energy of the men who have the\r\nwork directly in hand, but on the confidence they feel that\r\nbehind them is the diplomacy of a powerful nation to maintain\r\ntheir rights, the wealth of a rich nation to furnish them with\r\ncapital, the strength of a great people to secure them, in\r\nemergency, from disaster.\r\n\r\nIf the British connection seems of such significance to South\r\nAfrican statesmen, in working out the future of their vast\r\ncountry, quite as much does the Empire require the constant\r\nadvice of those statesmen in directing the difficult diplomacy\r\nand making the critical decisions which the control of so much\r\nof the continent necessitates. The lack of such advice, directly\r\nand consistently sought, is probably at the root of much of the\r\ndifficulty of the past. In the long run South African opinion\r\nmust dominate national policy in South Africa. That it should be\r\nexpressed in an authoritative form, and under a due sense of\r\nnational responsibility, are the conditions which will make it\r\nmost helpful, and most reliable.\r\n\r\nSir Gordon Sprigg and other public men from the Cape have\r\npointed out to me how peculiar are the {238} problems which\r\narise in South African politics, how much they stand apart from\r\nAnglo-Saxon experience in other parts of the world, how\r\nimpossible it is for anyone who has not to deal with these\r\nproblems on the spot to understand them. Here, if anywhere, the\r\nmaxim is true to which I have alluded in another place, that\r\n'only those who know a country are fitted to rule it.' It is\r\nonly by utilizing the knowledge and experience of the best minds\r\nof the country that adequate direction can be given to its\r\nexternal relations as to its internal government.\r\n\r\nThe actual and contingent stake which Great Britain, Australia\r\nand other parts of the Empire have in the exclusive use of the\r\nCape as a naval station in time of war may be roughly outlined\r\nin figures. Lord Brassey, dwelling upon the importance to the\r\nnation of completing the fortification and equipment of the\r\nneighbouring harbours, mentions in the Naval Annual for 1890,\r\nthat at present about £90,000,000 worth of commerce centres at\r\nor passes this point every year, including £20,000,000 of\r\noutward trade to Australia, £13,000,000 to the Cape itself, and\r\nportions of the Indian, Chinese and other Eastern trade which\r\nmake up the whole. This is under normal conditions. But should\r\nthe Suez Canal be closed, and it is difficult to see how in a\r\ngreat European war this could be prevented, unless England could\r\nobtain and maintain absolute naval control of the Mediterranean,\r\nand military control of Egypt, then at least £150,000,000, and\r\npossibly £200,000,000 of {239} British trade would be forced to\r\ngo round the Cape. I have mentioned elsewhere Lord Dufferin's\r\nstatement, to the London Chamber of Commerce, that if anything\r\never occurred to take away our control of the Indian markets\r\nthere is not a cottage in the manufacturing districts of England\r\nwhich would not feel the blow at once. If this be true of the\r\nIndian trade alone, the argument becomes much more impressive\r\nwhen applied to the risks which would be incurred, alike by\r\nBritain, India, and Australia if they were compelled to depend\r\nfor the security of the whole vast volume of Eastern and\r\nAustralian commerce upon such neutral rights as could be granted\r\nby an independent South Africa, or if they left the Cape in such\r\na position that it could be seized by a hostile power. We have\r\nan interesting historical illustration of what security on this\r\ngreat trade route means in the fact, stated on apparently\r\nreliable authority, that between the years 1793 and 1797, when\r\nthe French held the Isle of France and Bourbon, no less than\r\n2266 British merchantmen were seized by French ships or\r\nexpeditions sallying out from those stations. So intolerable did\r\nthe situation become for British commerce that the conquest of\r\nthe French stations became an absolute necessity, and this was\r\neffected in 1810 when a new outbreak of war had made like\r\ndisaster imminent. Yet this was before the vast trade of\r\nAustralasia had come into existence, and when our trade with the\r\nEast was but a trifle compared with its present great\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n{240}\r\n\r\nIn the case of South Africa, however, the argument for national\r\nunity is so strong that few undertake to question it. Not long\r\nsince, in the Manchester Reform Club, I met a sincere disciple\r\nof the old school of thinkers on colonial policy. He had studied\r\nthe question under Mr. Goldwin Smith, at Toronto, and was at\r\nfirst concisely and comprehensively dogmatic in his assertion\r\nthat the only plan for England was not only to permit, but to\r\nencourage, each of the great colonies to become independent as\r\nsoon as possible. He was an honest thinker, and one could with\r\nhim afford to stake the argument on a candid answer to a single\r\nquestion. 'Could Great Britain, with any regard to the safety of\r\nher national position, afford to give up South Africa'? The\r\nemphatic negative which, after a moment's thought, he gave, was\r\nthe only reply possible for one who acknowledged the force of\r\nfacts when presented to his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\nThe present and contingent relation of the British West Indies\r\nto the problem of national defence, and therefore of national\r\nunity, is more direct than at first sight may appear. No portion\r\nof the Empire was won at greater expense of prolonged conflict\r\nthan the West Indian Islands, but their relative commercial\r\nimportance was temporarily diminished by the occupation of other\r\ntropical countries, and the substitution of the {241} beet-root\r\nsugar of temperate climates for that of the cane. West Indian\r\ntrade, which has found out many new directions, is still,\r\nhowever, important, and not for the United Kingdom alone, but\r\nfor the Canadian Dominion as well. Canada and the West Indies\r\nare the complement of each other in natural production, and a\r\nvery large trade is sure to grow up between them as they develop\r\nin wealth and population. The Dominion has, therefore, a deep\r\ninterest in the power of the Empire to protect commerce such as\r\nis given by stations like Bermuda, St. Lucia and Kingston.\r\nHalifax has already been connected with Bermuda by a telegraph\r\ncable. The West Indian islands and Naval Stations at present\r\ndepend for communication upon lines passing through the United\r\nStates. The continuation of the Halifax-Bermuda cable to the\r\nWest Indies would give an independent electric connection\r\nbetween all the British possessions in America. This might\r\nbecome a very distinct addition to the resources of our naval\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe completion of any means of ship communication across the\r\nIsthmus of Panama would increase indefinitely the importance to\r\nthe Empire of the West Indies. Australia would have at once the\r\nsame kind of interest in the strength of the national position\r\nthere which she now has in our possession of the Cape, or in our\r\ncontrol of Aden and Malta. Through this new channel would\r\nprobably flow the main flood of British commerce with the\r\nwestern coasts of North and South America. It would furnish the\r\neasiest line of {242} naval communication between the Eastern\r\nand Western coasts of Canada.\r\n\r\nThus for the needs of the present and the contingencies of the\r\nfuture the retention of the British West Indies under the\r\nnational flag gives strength to our general system of defence.\r\n\r\nThe completion of telegraphic and steam communication between\r\nthe principal islands has brought the question of local\r\nfederation within the range of serious discussion, but the\r\nobstacles, social as well as physical, are naturally much\r\ngreater than in the case of Canada and Australia, and the\r\naccomplishment of union may be for some time delayed. The\r\nislands could not well be independent in any case, and there is\r\nprobably no part of the Empire which would lend itself more\r\nreadily than the West Indies to national consolidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Problems of Greater Britain_, vol. ii. p. 521.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{243}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n'As time passes it rather appears that we are in the hands of a\r\nProvidence which is greater than all statesmanship, that this\r\nfabric so blindly piled up has a chance of becoming a part of\r\nthe permanent edifice of civilization, and that the Indian\r\nachievement of England, as it is the strangest, may after all\r\nturn out to be the greatest; of all her achievements.'--Prof. J.\r\nR. Seeley.\r\n\r\n'BUT above all, what is to be done with India'? With this\r\nquestion Mr. Goldwin Smith makes the relation of India to the\r\nEmpire the crux of the Federation problem. To him the difficulty\r\npresented seems insoluble, chiefly because he believes that it\r\nwould be impossible for a federation of democratic communities\r\nscattered over the globe to hold India, about which they know\r\nlittle, as a dependency. He even doubts, in his customary vein\r\nof pessimism, whether the fate of the Indian Empire is not\r\nalready 'sealed by the progress of democracy in Britain.' So far\r\nfrom this last being the case it looks as if the English working\r\nman, who has annually more than £60,000,000 of trade staked on\r\nour hold on India, will be the last to weaken by his vote our\r\nposition in the country or our grip on the waterways which lead\r\nto the East. Every second or third day's work of the Lancashire\r\ncotton-spinner is done for the Indian market, or for other\r\nEastern {244} markets which we control on account of our\r\nposition in India. In some large districts, such as that of\r\nOldham, the proportion is three days' work out of four. And the\r\nLancashire spinner is a keen political thinker, especially where\r\nhis bread and butter are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe industry of the city of Dundee depends almost entirely upon\r\nthe supply of a single fibre from the valley of the Ganges. The\r\nDundee jute-worker is a Radical, but he is not likely for that\r\nreason to forget that his daily wage depends on the hold which\r\nthe Empire keeps upon Bengal. The purely trade relation of India\r\nto the United Kingdom was clearly put by Lord Dufferin in his\r\naddress to the London Chamber of Commerce three years ago. He\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n'During the past year our trade with our Indian Empire was\r\nlarger than our trade with any other country in the world, with\r\nthe exception of the United States, amounting to no less a sum\r\nthan £64,000,000. If, again, we merely confine our attention to\r\na comparison of our exports to India with our exports to other\r\ncountries, we shall find that the same  statement holds good,\r\nnamely, that the exports of Great Britain to India are greater\r\nthan those to any other country in the world except the United\r\nStates, amounting as they do to £34,000,000, whereas our exports\r\nto France do not exceed £24,000,000, and to Germany £27,000,000.\r\nIn fact, India's trade with the United Kingdom is nearly\r\none-tenth of the value of the total British trade with the whole\r\nworld. ... In 1888 she took £21,250,000 worth of our cotton\r\ngoods {245} and yarns, out of a total of £72,000,000 worth\r\nexported to all countries, whereas China only took £6,500,000\r\nworth, Germany £2,500,000 worth and the United States £2,000,000\r\nworth. Again, if we take another great section of British\r\nexports, such as hardware, machinery and metals, we find that\r\nout of a total export of £36,000,000 to all countries India in\r\n1888 took £5,750,000 worth, whereas we only sent £3,000,000\r\nworth to France, £1,750,000 worth to Russia, and £750,000 worth\r\nto China.\r\n\r\n'These figures, I think, should be enough to convince the least\r\nreceptive understanding what a fatal blow it would be to our\r\ncommercial prosperity were circumstances ever to close, either\r\ncompletely or partially, the Indian ports to the trade of Great\r\nBritain, and how deeply the manufacturing population of\r\nLancashire, and not only of Lancashire, but of every centre of\r\nindustry in Great Britain and Ireland, is interested in the\r\nwell-being and expanding prosperity of our Indian\r\nfellow-subjects. Indeed it would not be too much to say that if\r\nany serious disaster ever overtook our Indian Empire, or if our\r\npolitical relations with the Peninsula of Hindostan were to be\r\neven partially disturbed, there is not a cottage in Great\r\nBritain, at all events in the manufacturing districts, which\r\nwould not be made to feel the disastrous consequences of such an\r\nintolerable calamity.'\r\n\r\nThere is another point to consider. The rapid growth of our vast\r\nIndian commerce has been largely due to the application on an\r\nimmense scale of British capital {246} for the opening up of the\r\ncountry by railways and canals, and for the conservation and\r\ndistribution of water by systems of irrigation. It is estimated\r\nthat £350,000,000 are thus invested, to which must be added\r\nother large sums employed in various forms of industrial\r\nenterprise;  the profits and interest of all this capital\r\nflowing back steadily to the United Kingdom, and evidently\r\nsecured only by British dominance.\r\n\r\nWhen to all this we connect the fact that from 75,000 to 100,000\r\nBritish people find well paid employment in carrying on the\r\ngovernment, defence and industrial development of the country we\r\nbegin to understand the vast range of national interests\r\ninvolved in our retaining possession of India. The estimate that\r\nthe people of the United Kingdom draw from India sixty or\r\nseventy millions sterling every year in direct income is\r\nprobably a moderate one. Directly then Britain's stake in India\r\nis enormous. Indirectly our possession of the country would\r\nprobably determine the drift of the commerce of the vast regions\r\nstill further East.\r\n\r\nNor is it the United Kingdom alone which is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe present and prospective interest of the Australasian\r\ncolonies in India are also great, not only for the military\r\nreasons which have been mentioned, but in view of the growing\r\ntrade relations. India reduced to anarchy by the withdrawal of\r\nBritish rule, or India governed by Russia, would mean a serious\r\nblow {247} to Australasian trade, present and prospective. It\r\nmight easily mean exclusion from all the markets of the East.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa, which owed its earliest development to the fact\r\nthat it was the stopping place on the road to India, still owes\r\nmuch of its importance to the same cause. The interest of Canada\r\nin India is more remote, but now that Canadian steamship lines\r\nare on the Pacific, with their terminus at Hong Kong, Britain's\r\nposition in the East has a new interest for the Dominion.\r\n\r\nBut every British colony great and small is directly and deeply\r\ninterested in the maintenance of the power of the Empire, and if\r\nthe continued power of the Empire involves, as it seems to do,\r\nthe retention and government of India, the colonies should not\r\nshrink from sharing that responsibility.\r\n\r\nProfessor Seeley has proved with conclusive clearness that the\r\ngovernment of India has had very little effect upon the domestic\r\npolitics of England; there is no reason to think that it would\r\nhave more upon the domestic politics of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe political difficulty about India's relation to a united\r\nEmpire is, however, felt very widely. It is one of the first\r\nwhich occurs to the minds of most men when they turn their\r\nattention to the question, as I have found during public\r\ndiscussion in many parts of the Empire. Nor is this to be\r\nwondered at. That a country enjoying popular representative\r\ninstitutions should rule as an imperial power over some hundreds\r\n{248} of millions of people without representation in their own\r\ngovernment is an extraordinary anomaly. Men's minds have,\r\nhowever, become accustomed to it by long usage, and the fact is\r\naccepted almost without remark. But when a proposal is made to\r\nre-construct the national organism on what is claimed to be a\r\nlogical basis, the incompatibility between our popular system of\r\ngovernment, and the system which we apply to India at once\r\nre-appears.\r\n\r\nThe anomaly, however, would be no greater under federation than\r\nwithout it, and it is one with which the British mind in all\r\nparts of the Empire is familiar. Most of the great colonies have\r\nhad on a small scale the experience which the United Kingdom has\r\nhad on a large scale of ruling weaker races without giving them\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably confusion of thought is caused by the careless\r\nuse of the term Empire into which English people have fallen.\r\nApplied to India and the crown colonies it is admissible, though\r\nwith the qualification that in practice the Empress of India\r\nacts as much under advice as the Queen of England. As a name for\r\nthe 'slowly grown and crowned Republic' of which the mother-land\r\nis the type and the great self-governing colonies copies, the\r\nterm Empire is a misnomer, and has none of the meaning which it\r\nhas when applied to Russia, Austria, or the France of the\r\nNapoleons. If immediate reflection of the popular will in public\r\npolicy be taken as the test, England, Canada, and Australia are\r\nmore republican than the modern {249} republics; as democratic\r\nas is well possible under a representative system of government.\r\nBut the people of this 'crowned republic,' proud of their\r\ncapacity for self-government, and impatient of any illegitimate\r\ncontrol over themselves, have assumed the task of governing a\r\nreal Empire--one which contains a population of some hundreds of\r\nmillions of various races. The legitimacy of this assumed task\r\nwe need not stay to discuss. The actual relation of Britain to\r\nIndia as to several other countries without self-government is a\r\nfact; and one which has passed beyond the range of discussion.\r\n\r\nThis government of India the United Kingdom, upon which the work\r\nnow devolves, finds it possible to carry on, and on the whole\r\nefficiently. That it is done to the good of the people ruled is\r\nscarcely open to question. British rule in India may be far from\r\nideally perfect, but that it is superior to anything India ever\r\nhad before is freely admitted even by foreigners. Is there\r\nanything in the nature of the case which would prevent the\r\nrepresentatives of a united British race from carrying forward\r\nthe government of India as do now the representatives of the\r\nUnited Kingdom alone?\r\n\r\nLet us consider the system of government. To the Indians\r\nthemselves no representation, as we understand the term, is\r\ngiven. While largely employed for executive functions they take\r\nno part in legislation. An English statesman of proved capacity,\r\nassisted by a council of experienced specialists, is placed as\r\n{250} Viceroy at the head of affairs. Under him is a trained\r\nbody of civil servants, selected by a rigid system of\r\nexamination. To these the general administration of the country\r\nis committed. It is a system of government by experts.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal system of India, its revenue and expenditure, are\r\nkept entirely separate from those of the United Kingdom. It has\r\nits separate and clearly defined code of laws suited to its\r\ncircumstances. It has a practically independent military\r\norganization. The government of the great dependency is not only\r\nessentially different in form from that of the self-governing\r\nportions of the Empire, but revolves in a sphere of its own. The\r\ngeneral lines of Indian policy come under the review of\r\nParliament; the pressure of public opinion is kept upon those\r\nwho rule India through the channel of Parliamentary criticism;\r\nbeyond this the rule of the country is left to the specialists\r\nto whom it has been committed. It has been long since any\r\nquestion of Indian policy made or unmade a government.\r\n\r\nI have met everywhere, in Britain and in the colonies, people\r\nwho think that India makes a heavy drain upon the revenues of\r\nthe United Kingdom, and would do so upon the revenues of a\r\nunited Empire. This is an example of that ignorance which, it\r\nhas been truly said, is the most probable dissolvent of the\r\nEmpire. It is therefore not unnecessary to say that India pays\r\nexclusively for its own defence and government. Every soldier,\r\nwhite or native, from the {251} Commander-in-Chief down to the\r\nhumblest sepoy; every civil servant, from the Governor-General\r\nto the lately appointed clerk, is paid from Indian revenues\r\nalone. India does even more, it pays the whole expense of the\r\nIndia Office in London, and for the maintenance of Aden and\r\nother ports near the mouth of the Red Sea, with their garrisons,\r\nalthough these give protection to other Eastern commerce and to\r\nthat of the Australasian colonies as well as Indian. India\r\ncontributes also to the maintenance of consular establishments\r\nin China and of the British Embassy in Persia. The resources and\r\nthe fighting power of India stand today as a barrier to guard\r\nfrom danger the enormous British commerce in the Eastern seas,\r\nto keep back the most dangerous military power of Europe and\r\nAsia from nearer approach to the English communities of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThe question whether any degree of representation could be given\r\nto the Indian population would remain for a federated Empire,\r\njust as it now exists for the United Kingdom. The problem would\r\nbe no greater and no less. Any step taken in that direction\r\nwould no doubt be exceedingly cautious and tentative. But for\r\ndealing with this, as with all other Indian problems, a united\r\nEmpire, with its consolidated strength, would be vastly more\r\nefficient than a nation going through various stages of\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\nThe answer which appears to me sufficient to those whom claim\r\nthat Britain's control of India interposes {252} an insuperable\r\nobstacle to a Federal system for the Empire is this:--\r\n\r\nIndia is practically a crown colony, and as yet the United\r\nKingdom has shown no inclination to govern it otherwise than as\r\na crown colony. The same duty may be rightly accepted and duly\r\nfulfilled by British people as a whole under any system of\r\ncommon government. To accept it would create no new national\r\nburden or risk, would react no more upon the ordinary political\r\ndevelopment of the various states than it has upon that of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{253}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN VIEW.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR the sake of studying the various angles from which the idea\r\nof federating the Empire is criticized it seems worth while to\r\nrefer briefly to some of the views expressed in a paper, lately\r\ncontributed to a leading magazine[1], on the subject, by Mr.\r\nAndrew Carnegie, under the title of 'An American View' of\r\nImperial Federation. Among thinking native Americans I have\r\nfound, as a rule, a genuine sympathy with the advocates of unity\r\nfor British people, a sympathy perfectly natural in a nation\r\nwhich has suffered and sacrificed so much as the people of the\r\nUnited States have for a similar object. Besides, their\r\nfamiliarity not only with the idea of large political\r\norganization, but with its actual working out has taken away\r\nfrom them that fear of its difficulties which seems to haunt\r\nmany weak-kneed Englishmen who conceive that human political\r\ncapacity had achieved its utmost when it evolved the existing\r\nImperial system. One of the distinguished thinkers of the United\r\nStates, after a tour made around the world a few years ago,\r\nexpressed {254} to me, with characteristic American energy and\r\nemphasis, the opinion he brought home with him upon the subject\r\nof British consolidation. 'The citizen of the British Empire,'\r\nsaid he, 'who is not an enthusiast on the question of Imperial\r\nFederation, is a Philistine of the very first magnitude.'\r\n\r\nWorking out on separate and yet parallel lines the great\r\nproblems of liberty and of civil and religious progress, the\r\nUnited States and the British Empire have the strongest reasons\r\nfor sympathizing with each other's efforts to consolidate and\r\nperfect the national machinery by which their aims are to be\r\naccomplished. English people now understand and respect the\r\nmotives which actuated the resolute and successful struggle of\r\nthe people of the United States against disruption. That\r\nAmericans should understand the necessity which exists for\r\nmaintaining the integrity of the Empire and the principles on\r\nwhich it is sought to maintain it, is most desirable. They are\r\nnot likely to learn them from Mr. Carnegie.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, he begins his argument by forgetting that\r\nthere is a British Empire. As I have pointed out elsewhere\r\n(though without regarding the views as essential to Federation),\r\nthere are those who consider that national consolidation would\r\nbe hastened on through an endeavour by tariff agencies to make\r\nthe Empire self-sufficing in the matter of food, just as the\r\nUnited States by the McKinley tariff, are endeavouring to make\r\nthemselves self-sufficing in the matter of manufactures.\r\n\r\n{255}\r\n\r\nMr. Carnegie justifies protection in the United States because\r\nit ultimately cheapens production, and then says: 'Now because\r\nBritain has not the requisite territory to increase greatly her\r\nfood supply, any tax imposed upon food could not be temporary\r\nbut must be permanent. The doctrine of Mill does not therefore\r\napply, for protection, to be wise, must always be in the nature\r\nof only a temporary shielding of new plants until they take\r\nroot. It will surprise many if Britain ever imposes a permanent\r\ntax upon the food of her 38,000,000 of people, with no possible\r\nhope of ever increasing the supply, and thereby reducing the\r\ncost, and thus ultimately rendering the tax unnecessary. A tax\r\nfor a short period, that fosters and increases production, and a\r\ntax for all time which cannot increase production, are different\r\nthings.'\r\n\r\nMr. Carnegie evidently forgets that the Empire covers one fifth\r\nof the world, that it produces every article of food and raw\r\nmaterial of manufacture, that under the compulsion of any great\r\nnational necessity it could in five years make itself\r\nindependent of outside supplies, with the possible exception of\r\nraw cotton, and that by the natural processes of growth and\r\nchange, without any protection, it is likely in the near future,\r\npartly on account of the inability of the United States to\r\nfurnish what they have hitherto furnished, to be drawing its\r\nsupplies of food chiefly from its own territories. It is not my\r\nbusiness to suggest, much less argue for a system of protection\r\n{256} for the Empire, but if it is to be discussed, let us at\r\nleast take into account the elementary facts which Mr. Carnegie\r\nomits. The climax of absurdity seems well-nigh reached when Mr.\r\nCarnegie, fresh from the full operation of the McKinley Tariff\r\nand its justification, roundly accuses the Empire Trade League\r\nof making 'efforts to array one part of the race against the\r\nother part' because it has suggested a very slight differential\r\ntariff within the Empire. Life in America is not generally\r\nsupposed to destroy a sense of the ridiculous.\r\n\r\nMr. Carnegie's criticism of another class of Federationists is\r\nthat they have 'no business' in their programme, 'no\r\nconsiderations of trade,' that 'sentiment reigns supreme.' It is\r\nevident that he has not a primary conception of the main drift\r\nof federation policy. He is like many of his fellow-citizens in\r\nAmerica, out of whom life on a broad continent appears to have\r\ndriven the maritime instinct. Because external commerce or the\r\ncarrying trade means little to the United States, or because his\r\nown country is so remarkably self-contained, he has no standard\r\nby which to measure the profound and practical significance\r\nwhich maritime position has for countries like Great Britain or\r\nAustralia. In 1890 of the 3389 vessels which passed through the\r\nSuez Canal 2522 were British and three American. In the same\r\nyear, out of the whole volume of American external trade itself,\r\nonly 12.29 per cent., or about one-eighth was carried in\r\nAmerican bottoms, of the remaining seven-eighths by far the\r\nlarger part crossed the seas under the {257} British flag.\r\nAgain, in 1890 the shipping cleared in England amounted in all\r\nto 3,316,442 tons, but of this only 38,192 tons were under the\r\nUnited States flag, although the trade between the two countries\r\nis one of vast proportions. These figures will serve to\r\nillustrate how difficult it must be for anyone looking at our\r\nnational questions from an American point of view to understand\r\nthe fundamental interests of British people, and perhaps explain\r\nthe airy cheerfulness with which Mr. Carnegie suggests various\r\nprocesses of political evolution which involve the\r\ndisintegration of the Empire. But Mr. Carnegie has other\r\ndifficulties than those which arise from studying a question\r\nfrom an unfavourable angle. The intense occupations of business\r\nin America may well be his excuse for not keeping in touch with\r\nthe movement of British politics; they can scarcely excuse him\r\nfor discussing English affairs as if he were in a position to\r\nunderstand them. 'Britain,' he says, 'can choose whether\r\nAustralia, Canada, and her other colonies, as they grow to\r\nmaturity, can set up for themselves, with every feeling of\r\nfilial devotion towards her, or whether every child born in\r\nthese lands is to be born to regard Britain as the cruel\r\noppressor of his country. There is no other alternative, and I\r\nbeseech our friends of the Imperial Federation (League) to pause\r\nere they involve their country and her children in the\r\ndisappointment and humiliation which must come, if a serious\r\neffort is made to check the development and independent\r\nexistence of the colonies, for independence {258} they must and\r\nwill seek, and obtain, even by force, if necessary.' One\r\nhesitates whether to lay stress upon the ignorance or the folly\r\nof sentences like these. I use the words advisedly. Ignorance,\r\nbecause apparently Mr. Carnegie does not know that almost every\r\nresponsible British statesman of the past half century and of\r\nthe present day, when dealing with this question, has said that\r\nwhen the great colonies wish to go Great Britain will raise no\r\nobjection; that this view has been re-echoed unanimously by the\r\npress and by public opinion; and that no advocate of Imperial\r\nFederation, national unity, or whatever other name we apply to\r\nBritish consolidation, has ever hinted at the union of the\r\nself-governing portions of the Empire as anything else than a\r\npact entered into voluntarily by communities free to choose or\r\nrefuse as they please, as free as were the States of the\r\nAmerican Union or the provinces of the Dominion to adopt their\r\npresent system. Britain has not waited, and Imperial\r\nFederationists have not waited, for Mr. Carnegie's supplications\r\nto decide this great and fundamental issue of national policy.\r\nThe advocates of national unity are the foremost to proclaim it.\r\nFolly, for it is folly when Mr. Carnegie, in the face of facts\r\nlike these, which nobody can question, rounds his periods with\r\nhints at cruel oppression, on the one side, and independence won\r\nby force, on the other, when discussing the relations of England\r\nand her colonies. It is on his own continent that he finds the\r\nexample of states kept within a national union by force.\r\n\r\n{259}\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Carnegie understands little about Britain's relation to\r\nher colonies and to the world, he understands much less about\r\nthe opinions of colonists. None the less he speaks of them with\r\nthe most complete assurance of knowledge. A single illustration\r\nwill give the measure of his ignorance. Quoting certain views in\r\nopposition to British connection expressed by Mr. Mercier, the\r\nlate leader of the extreme national party in the French province\r\nof Quebec, he gravely assures his readers that Mr. Mercier\r\nreflects the sentiments of ninety-nine out of every hundred\r\nnative-born Canadians and Australians. Absurdity could scarcely\r\ngo further.\r\n\r\nMr. Carnegie poses as a political philosopher and gives English\r\nstatesmen the advantage of his sage advice on national\r\nquestions. We look for the grounds of this superior wisdom and\r\nwe read as follows: 'What lesson has the past to teach us upon\r\nthis point? Spain had great colonies upon the American\r\ncontinent: where are these now? Seventeen republics occupy\r\nCentral and South America. Five of these have prepared plans for\r\nfederating. Portugal had a magnificent empire, which is now with\r\nthe Brazilian Republic. Britain had a colony. It has passed from\r\nits mother's apron-strings and set up for itself, and now the\r\nmajority of all our race are gathered under its Republican\r\nflag[2]. What is there in the position of {260} Britain's\r\nrelations to Australia and Canada that justifies the belief that\r\nany different result is possible with them? I know of none.' And\r\nknowing none, Mr. Carnegie, by his own confession, writes in\r\nutter ignorance of the main facts of the question which he\r\ndiscusses. Spain and Portugal governed their colonies from the\r\nhome centre, and as tributaries. Britain allows her colonies to\r\ngovern themselves, and to dispose of their own money as they\r\nplease; Spain and Portugal (and England in 1776) wished to\r\nretain their colonies against their will; Britain now leaves the\r\nquestion of continued connection a matter which colonists are to\r\ndecide for themselves.\r\n\r\nVery interesting indeed is Mr. Carnegie's sudden change of front\r\nwhen he comes to look at federation as making for the\r\naggrandisement or the good of {261} the United States rather\r\nthan of the British Empire. He has just been proving the\r\nabsurdity, the impossibility, nay, the criminality, of trying to\r\nknit together in some sufficient federal union the mother-land\r\nand her great colonies. He proves to his own satisfaction that\r\nthe colonies never will be and never ought to be satisfied with\r\nthe position they will have in such a union. Separate\r\ngovernments and separate governments alone will satisfy their\r\nyearnings for complete independence.\r\n\r\nHe passes by without note the idea which inspires the\r\nFederationist, who believes that such a union will make\r\nenormously for the world's peace, not only by preventing the\r\nformation of many distinct and possibly hostile states, but also\r\nby enabling British people to give security to industry over an\r\narea of the world greater than was ever before under a single\r\nflag--at least three times as great as that of the United\r\nStates, to say nothing of the vast extent of ocean which the\r\nEmpire can control.\r\n\r\nWith his ignoring of this leading idea of those who wish for\r\nBritish unity, and his ridicule of federation for the Empire, a\r\nfeature of the alternative which he proposes is in odd contrast.\r\nHe suggests that Canada should be encouraged by England not\r\nmerely to give up her present allegiance, but to join the United\r\nStates, and this is the argument with which he supports his\r\nsuggestion: 'With the appalling condition of Europe before us,\r\nit would be criminal for a few millions of people to create a\r\nseparate government {262} and not to become part of a great mass\r\nof their own race which joins them, especially since the federal\r\nsystem gives each part the control of all its internal affairs,\r\nand has proved that the freest government of the parts produces\r\nthe strongest government of the whole.' Why not, one asks, for\r\nthe British people as well as for those of the United States?\r\nWhy may not full control of internal affairs and the freest\r\ngovernment of the various parts of the British Empire go hand in\r\nhand with a strong government for the whole? Why may we not\r\nconsider the united and sympathetic effort of the different\r\ndivisions of the Empire to so consolidate their strength as to\r\nmaintain peace over one fifth of the world directly--indirectly\r\nover a still greater proportion--a nobler ideal than that for\r\nwhich Mr. Carnegie thinks the Empire should give up Canada--i.e.\r\nthe peace of America? Nor need the larger interfere with the\r\nsmaller aspiration. Incidentally Mr. Carnegie himself fully\r\nadmits this. After having used the possibility of conflict\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States as his chief or only\r\nargument for the transfer of Canada's nationality, he goes on to\r\nsay: 'Even today every Federationist has the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that the idea of war between the two great branches is\r\nscouted on both sides of the Atlantic. Henceforth, war between\r\nmembers of our race may be said to be already banished, for\r\nEnglish-speaking men will never again be called upon to destroy\r\neach other. During the recent difference ... not a whisper was\r\nheard on either {263} side of any possible appeal to force as a\r\nmode of settlement. Both parties in America and each successive\r\ngovernment are pledged to offer peaceful arbitration for the\r\nadjustment of all international difficulties--a position which\r\nit is to be hoped will soon be reached by Britain, at least in\r\nregard to all differences with members of the same race.'\r\n\r\nThe Geneva arbitration, the Halifax arbitration, the San Juan\r\nSettlement, the offer of arbitration in the Behring Sea affairs,\r\nso long urged upon Mr. Blaine by Lord Salisbury before it was\r\naccepted, the arbitration arranged with France in the affairs of\r\nNewfoundland, all seem to indicate that Britain is quite as\r\nadvanced as the United States in these views of peaceful\r\nsettlement. With this qualification of his way of stating the\r\ncase we may accept Mr. Carnegie's hopeful outlook, which takes\r\naway all the point of his previous contention. There is,\r\nhowever, a point worthy of his and our consideration.\r\n\r\nI once heard Lord Rosebery express the opinion that equality of\r\npower was one of the chief guarantees of peace between great\r\nstates. It adds the very powerful motive of self-interest to\r\nthose other influences which incline a nation to arbitration or\r\nother fair and reasonable methods of settling international\r\ndifficulties. 'If,' said he, 'it should ever happen that England\r\nbecame towards the United States like the old grandmother in the\r\ncorner, her teeth dropping out one by one, as her colonies leave\r\nher, and she {264} were patronised or despised by her grown up\r\noffspring, this relation would not be one tending to promote\r\nfriendly feeling. Far better for mutual respect, consideration,\r\nand closer friendship that each should follow out its own\r\ndevelopment on its own broad lines.' Whether a British Empire\r\ngoing through a process of disintegration, or one steadily\r\nconsolidating its strength would be more likely to obtain equity\r\nand fair play from American politicians (who must so often be\r\ndistinguished from the American people) I may safely leave even\r\nMr. Carnegie, who knows them, to decide.\r\n\r\nNor is there anything in the position of the United States on\r\nthe continent which would justify Americans in demanding from\r\nthe Empire the sacrifice of her maritime position implied in the\r\ntransfer of Canada to a new nationality. Ports on the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific as many as they need the United States already have.\r\nTrade in Canadian products they can obtain on terms as fair as\r\nthey will themselves agree to. A less aggressive neighbour they\r\ncould scarcely expect to have. Two countries on the same\r\ncontinent working out parallel political problems by different\r\nagencies may be mutually helpful with varying experiment and\r\nexample. Contrast and mutual reaction stimulate progress for\r\nmore than vast monotony of system.\r\n\r\nMr. Carnegie endorses Mr. Goldwin Smith's opinion that Britain's\r\n'position upon the American continent is the barrier to\r\nsympathetic union with her great {265} child, the Republic.' As\r\nan American he should be ashamed to admit the accuracy of such\r\nan opinion. Britain's right to her place on the American\r\ncontinent is as much above question as is that of the United\r\nStates. The man or people to whom a neighbour's enjoyment of an\r\nadmitted right causes irritation, has lost the finer sense of\r\nmorality. The nation which yielded an undoubted right under the\r\npressure of such a base irritation would do a harm to\r\ninternational morals. British Federationists have more faith in\r\nthe nobler qualities of the American people than has Mr.\r\nCarnegie. They earnestly hope for a union of effort in behalf of\r\nthe higher interests of humanity between the great Republic and\r\nthe Empire from which she sprang, but they know that that union\r\ncan only come from mutual respect for each other's rights, and\r\ncan never be brought about if the aggrandisement of the one must\r\nbe purchased by the disintegration of the other.\r\n\r\nOne more passage must be quoted to illustrate the range of Mr.\r\nCarnegie's vision when he leaves the domain of American politics\r\nto discuss the affairs of Great Britain. He says: 'Her\r\n(Britain's) colonies weaken her powers in war and confer no\r\nadvantage upon her in peace.'\r\n\r\nI must let another American, whose mind has not been too much\r\ninfluenced by devotion to trade on a highly protected continent,\r\na man who has had occasion to study seriously the larger\r\nproblems of national life, make answer.\r\n\r\n{266}\r\n\r\n'England,' says Lieutenant Mahan[3], 'by her immense colonial\r\nEmpire has sacrificed much of this advantage of concentration of\r\nforce around her own shores; but the sacrifice was wisely made,\r\nfor the gain was greater than the loss, as the event proved.\r\nWith the growth of her colonial system her war fleets also grew,\r\nbut her merchant shipping and wealth grew yet faster.'\r\n\r\nAnd again;--\r\n\r\n'Undoubtedly under this second head of warlike preparation must\r\ncome the maintenance of suitable naval stations, in those\r\ndistant parts of the world to which the armed shipping must\r\nfollow the peaceful vessels of commerce. The protection of such\r\nstations must depend either upon direct military force, as do\r\nGibraltar and Malta, or upon a surrounding friendly population,\r\nsuch as the American colonists once were to England, and, it may\r\nbe presumed the Australian colonists now are. Such friendly\r\nsurroundings and backing, joined to a reasonable military\r\nprovision, are the best of defences, and when combined with\r\ndecided preponderance at sea, make a scattered and extensive\r\nempire like that of England, secure; for while it is true that\r\nan unexpected attack may cause disaster in some one quarter, the\r\nactual superiority of naval power prevents such disaster from\r\nbeing general or irremediable. History has sufficiently proved\r\nthis. England's naval bases have been in all parts of the world,\r\nand her fleets have at once protected them, {267} kept open the\r\ncommunications between them, and relied upon them for shelter.\r\n\r\n'Colonies attached to the mother-country afford, therefore, the\r\nsurest means of supporting abroad the sea power of a country. In\r\npeace, the influence of the government should be felt in\r\npromoting by all means a warmth of attachment and a unity of\r\ninterest which will make the welfare of one the welfare of all,\r\nand the quarrel of one the quarrel of all; and in war, or rather\r\nfor war, by inducing such measures of organization and defence\r\nas shall be felt by all to be a fair distribution of a burden of\r\nwhich each reaps the benefit.'\r\n\r\nAfter such a statement of the bases on which sea power rests it\r\nis with natural regret that Lieutenant Mahan adds: 'Such\r\ncolonies the United States has not and is not likely to have.\r\n... Having therefore no foreign establishments, either colonial\r\nor military, the ships of war of the United States, in war, will\r\nbe like land birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To\r\nprovide resting-places for them, where they can coal and repair,\r\nwould be one of the first duties of a government proposing to\r\nitself the development of the power of the nation at sea.'\r\n\r\nBritish people, either at home or in the colonies, may safely be\r\nleft to decide whether they can afford that their ships should\r\nbe in war like land birds, unable to fly far from their own\r\nshores.'\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that Mr. Carnegie really\r\nrepresents the views of the better minds of his {268} own\r\ncountry on the question of British Unity. In an article\r\ncontributed to a leading American Magazine three years ago I had\r\noccasion to outline for American readers the chief features of\r\nthe Federation problem. The editorial comment upon this paper\r\nseems worthy of reproduction as an expression of genuine\r\nAmerican opinion on the subject, and may be commended to Mr.\r\nCarnegie's consideration. The writer says: 'What could be more\r\nnatural than the \"Federation\" scheme for British reconstruction,\r\nwhich has been before the British public for years, and is now\r\nrenewed in the article just mentioned? It offers to Great\r\nBritain the maintenance of every interest, legal, economic,\r\npolitical and moral, which has grown up in the past, and has\r\nshown itself worthy of conservation. It maintains all the ties\r\nwhich have held the different parts of the Empire together. It\r\neven strengthens them prodigiously by transforming the weak ties\r\nof colonialism into a true national life: so that the foreigner\r\nshall look upon Canada or Jamaica, not as temporary hangers-on\r\nof a distant island, but as component and fully recognized\r\nmembers of a magnificent ocean empire. It distributes the burden\r\nof imperial taxation over the whole empire, so that the\r\nAustralian may look upon the Imperial iron-clad which comes into\r\nhis harbour as possibly the product of his own state's taxation,\r\nwhile Canadian regiments shall take their tour of duty in\r\nEnglish or Irish cities, or at the Cape. It lessens the dangers\r\nof a new break-up of the Empire through Colonial discontent:\r\n{269} the Canada or New South Wales of the \"federation\" could\r\nsubmit without a second thought to the abandonment of claims \"by\r\nits own government,\" while there is now always something of a\r\nsting in such an abandonment by a home government on whose\r\ndecision the colony has exercised no direct influence. It leaves\r\nto every square foot of the Empire that alternative of\r\nself-government in the present, or of the hope of\r\nself-government in the future which is afforded by our State and\r\nTerritorial systems. Canada would be at once one of the\r\nself-governing States of the Empire: but the territories of\r\nIndia would have under the Federation such prospects of complete\r\nstate-hood, when they should deserve it, as they could never\r\nhave under a Russian Dominion or protectorate. ...\r\n\r\n'The question now is whether the inevitable development of\r\nEnglish democracy in new directions, more particularly in that\r\nof a federated empire, shall happily anticipate any conjunction\r\nof circumstances which might otherwise force a second break-up\r\nof the Empire. It is really, then, a race against time by the\r\nEnglish democracy.'\r\n\r\nThe closing reference to Canada may be commended to the\r\nconsideration of Mr. Goldwin Smith, as well as Mr. Carnegie,\r\nsince it reflects a spirit worthy of a great people.\r\n\r\n'If, as one result, our neighbours to the north of us should\r\nbecome an integral part of a real empire, such a natural and\r\nsimple solution will find no congratulations {270} more prompt\r\nand cordial than those of the American people, even though they\r\nare not based on any of those selfish advantages which\r\nannexation professes to offer to the United States[4].'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Nineteenth Century_, _Sept._ 1891.\r\n\r\n[2] This statement is a characteristic instance of Mr.\r\nCarnegie's inaccuracy. Let him subtract from the whole\r\npopulation of the United States the seven or eight millions of\r\nnegroes in the Southern States, the six or seven millions of\r\nItalians, Spaniards, Poles, Hungarians, Austrians, Russians,\r\nGermans and Scandinavians, who entered the country between 1847\r\nand the present time, the people who with their descendants\r\nthreaten, according to American writers, to overwhelm the native\r\nelement of the population; let him place beside these figures\r\nthe further facts stated on American authority that the\r\nemigration from Great Britain to the United States has been in\r\nthe same period only about 1,500,000, and from Ireland\r\n2,500,000; and he may find reason to acknowledge that the mass\r\nof 'our race' is still in the British Islands and in the great\r\ncolonies which yet retain their distinctive Anglo-Saxon\r\ncharacter. Mr. Carnegie makes the triumphant calculation that\r\nthe child is born who will see more than 400,000,000 people\r\nunder the sway of the United States. He adds the odd comment:\r\n'No possible increase of the race can be looked for in all the\r\nworld comparable to this.' So far from such a growth indicating\r\nthe increase of our race, it could only mean its practical\r\nobliteration in the great Republic. The increase of the native\r\nAmerican population is notoriously very slow--only a largely\r\nincreased influx of alien races could make Mr. Carnegie's\r\ncalculations a reality.\r\n\r\n[3] _Influence of Sea Power_, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[4] _Century Magazine_, Jan. 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{271}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nFINANCE.\r\n\r\nTHE financial aspects of our question are striking and\r\nsignificant. Britain herself is the greatest money-lending\r\nnation of the world: her colonies and dependencies, with their\r\nvast undeveloped resources, are among the greatest borrowers.\r\nThe public debts of the Australasian colonies amount to nearly\r\n£200,000,000, and private investments for the development of\r\nmines, for the wool producing and meat raising industries and so\r\non, amount, I have been told by Australian business men, to even\r\nmore. It is probably a moderate estimate to say that Australasia\r\nborrows £400,000,000, all of which is raised in London, to which\r\nthe interest steadily flows back.\r\n\r\nIn his 'Problems of Greater Britain' Sir Charles Dilke says:\r\n'British capital to the extent of £350,000,000 sterling has been\r\nsunk in Indian enterprises, on official or quasi-official\r\nguarantee; and a further vast amount of British capital is\r\nemployed by purely private British enterprise in industry.'\r\n\r\nCanada's public borrowings amount to about £50,000,000, and\r\nallowing an equal sum for private {272} investments, she perhaps\r\ndraws £100,000,000 of working capital from English sources.\r\n\r\nNothing has been said about South Africa, the West Indies, and\r\nthe minor divisions of the Empire, but even the rough estimates\r\nalready given prove that the aggregate of money loaned from\r\nBritain, and borrowed by other parts of the Empire, reaches\r\nenormous figures, and certainly exceeds £1,000,000,000 sterling.\r\n\r\nFor investor and borrower the benefit is mutual. The investor\r\nhas the advantage of placing his money where it will be employed\r\nin making the most of vast natural resources, under a settled\r\ngovernment, and in the energetic and responsible hands of men of\r\nour own race. This advantage is emphasized by the experience of\r\nBritish capitalists in countries like Argentina, where\r\ngovernment is unstable, or Turkey, where it is inefficient. It\r\nis emphasized by the contrast between the financial position of\r\nEgypt, when dominated by British influence and protected by\r\nBritish power, and the same country when free to follow its own\r\nmethods of administration and compelled to find its own defence.\r\n\r\nIt is shown by the difference between the rates at which\r\nAustralia or Canada borrow money, and those paid by many foreign\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe colonial borrower has the advantage of getting the money he\r\nrequires at the cheapest rate possible. The last Canadian loan\r\nwas floated at 3 per cent, and the Australian colonies are\r\nborrowing at 3 1/2. Lord {273} Dufferin has said that British\r\ncapital is ventured in India 'on the assumption that English\r\ncapital and English justice would remain dominant in India.' In\r\nlike manner the rate at which colonial loans are issued is\r\nunquestionably determined in part by the fact that the\r\nindustrial position and military security of the colonies is\r\nguaranteed by the imperial power. Independent, exposed to face\r\nthe risks of war unaided, and compelled to bear the whole burden\r\nof defending their coasts and commerce, the credit of the\r\ncolonies could not be what it is to-day.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since cheap capital means cheap production,\r\nthe money lent on easy terms to the colonies returns far more to\r\nthe mother-country than the interest which has hitherto been so\r\nregularly paid. It secures for Britain what she most requires,\r\ncheap food and cheap raw material--wheat, beef and mutton, wool,\r\ncotton and minerals. For a great consuming country the free\r\nmovement of the wheels of industry in the areas of production is\r\nall-important. Even the cheap insurance which comes from assured\r\nsafety in the transport of goods between producer and consumer\r\nis no slight element in the prosperity of both.\r\n\r\nIn view of these considerations there is clearly ground for\r\nsaying that a close political union between the greatest\r\nmoney-lending centre of the world and countries which have the\r\nwidest range of undeveloped resources, between the greatest\r\nconsuming country and those mainly productive, will be of the\r\ngreatest advantage to both.\r\n\r\n{274}\r\n\r\nI have often, to audiences in the colonies, put the financial\r\nrelation in the following way: 'You borrow from Britain in\r\npublic debts many hundred millions of pounds. When, as\r\nmerchants, ship-owners, or house-holders, you borrow money in a\r\nprivate capacity, on your goods, your ships, or your houses, the\r\nlender requires that as a guarantee your property must be\r\ninsured, and for this insurance you must yourself pay. Now when\r\nBritish people lend you money, on your state credit, they\r\nthemselves provide the insurance of the whole strength of the\r\nBritish army and navy--an insurance which it is admitted secures\r\nthe cheapest money in the world. But not only does Britain lend\r\nyou the money for the development of your resources, and provide\r\nthe insurance which enables you to have it at a cheap rate, but\r\nunder her Free trade system she then in addition throws herself\r\ninto the open market for every pound of wool or ounce of gold or\r\ntin that you produce. She asks no preference in colonial\r\nmarkets. Any conditions which would be more favourable for a\r\nborrowing country I cannot find it possible to conceive.'\r\n\r\nA further point seems worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nWhile the colonies, under the national production, borrow money\r\ncheaply on the public credit, the United Kingdom borrows more\r\ncheaply still. Low as is the rate of interest paid on the\r\nNational Debt, for many purposes of investment it is deemed the\r\nmost satisfactory, because the most secure, of all.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages which Canada has reaped {275} from\r\ninternal confederation has been the greatly decreased rate of\r\ninterest which she pays for her borrowings. A high financial\r\nauthority has estimated that the Australasian colonies would\r\ngain, from a consolidated federal stock, an advantage equal to a\r\ndiminution of more that £20,000,000 on the general indebtedness.\r\nFacts such as these have naturally led the advocates of national\r\nunity to suggest a further step and to urge that a financial\r\nfederation of the public debts of the Empire, guaranteed by the\r\nstrength and resources of the nation at large, would reduce the\r\ncost of public money for the colonies and dependencies to at\r\nleast the level of interest paid on the National Debt. It has\r\nbeen pointed out with force and reason that the saving which\r\nmight thus be effected under a guarantee of Imperial unity would\r\nof itself be sufficient to enable the colonies to contribute a\r\nlarge sum to the national defence without any addition to the\r\nburdens which they now bear, while sensibly relieving the\r\ntaxpayer of the United Kingdom. The fixing of a reasonable limit\r\nto thus borrowing on national credit for each portion of the\r\nEmpire would, of course, present a difficulty, but it is one\r\nwhich has, on a small scale, been grappled with in the provinces\r\nof the Canadian confederation, and does not seem to be\r\naltogether insuperable. The federally guaranteed debt would\r\ncertainly be held almost exclusively within the Empire itself,\r\nand the general desire for its complete security might fairly be\r\nexpected to act as a strong national bond. {276} Enormous as is\r\nthe amount which the mother-country has already staked in the\r\ncolonies and dependencies, it seems certain that under\r\nfavourable conditions capital will more and more seek these\r\nareas of peaceful industrial development rather than take the\r\nrisks of internal revolutions in South America or military\r\nconvulsions in Europe. With closer union this tendency, in\r\nitself essentially healthy, would increase. With separation, it\r\nwould be deeply affected by two considerations: first, the\r\nweakened guarantee of safety to the individual colony: and\r\nsecond, the new burden which would be laid upon the separating\r\ncolony in undertaking single-handed the whole task of defence,\r\nand the whole diplomatic, consular and other organization\r\nincident to national independence. Inevitably expenses would go\r\nup while credit went down. I am satisfied that people either in\r\nEngland or abroad who for colonial relations thoughtlessly\r\nborrow the simile of the ripe fruit dropping easily from the\r\nparent tree, have formed little conception of the violent\r\nfinancial wrench involved in the separation of even one great\r\ncolony, or of the strength of the financial bond which, every\r\nday increasing in strength, is binding more closely together\r\nwith ties of common interest the mother-land and her greatest\r\noffshoots.\r\n\r\nA very important financial issue has lately been raised by the\r\nproposition to permit the investment of British Trust Funds in\r\ncolonial securities. The proposal has for some time been\r\nsteadily urged upon the English Government by the Agents General\r\nwho {277} officially represent the Australian colonies, and by\r\nthe High Commissioner for Canada, and it is generally believed\r\nthat the negociations had proceeded so far that at one time Her\r\nMajesty's Government had consented to initiate the Legislation\r\nnecessary for the purpose. Though the discussion is now in\r\nabeyance, it will no doubt come up at a later time for decision.\r\nIf favourable, that decision would confer a considerable\r\nfinancial advantage upon the colonies. Of the sufficiency of the\r\nguarantee furnished in such investments careful and responsible\r\nfinanciers entertain no reasonable doubt. It is obvious,\r\nhowever, that any determination to concede this privilege to\r\ntrustees implies a belief that the colonies will remain a part\r\nof the Empire. It is equally obvious that any tendency in an\r\nopposite direction on the part of any great colony would be\r\nfatal to the proposition. At present such investment can only be\r\nmade in certain home securities, or in Indian, and a very\r\nlimited number of colonial securities which are under direct\r\nImperial guarantee. There would be as valid reason for extending\r\nthem to French, Italian or Russian securities as to those of\r\ncolonies which might soon become independent nations. It will be\r\nscarcely possible to avoid the consideration of ultimate\r\ninter-imperial relations should this subject come up for final\r\ndecision in Parliament. Under a settled system of Imperial unity\r\ncolonial securities, even without Legislation, would naturally\r\nrank with the best in the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{278}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTRADE AND FISCAL POLICY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN matters of fiscal policy the British Empire at present\r\noccupies a position peculiar among all the nations of the world,\r\nin that for nearly half a century it has been without any fiscal\r\nsystem common to its various parts. Nor does the fact seem to\r\nhave seriously affected the sense of unity. It cannot be said\r\nthat New South Wales, which till quite lately has in its fiscal\r\narrangements followed the example of the mother-country, is\r\nunited a whit more closely to her than is Victoria or Canada,\r\nwhere duties have long been imposed not merely for revenue but\r\nfor protection. 'Nor can it be truly said that the ties,\r\npractical or sentimental, which bind together Canada and the\r\nUnited Kingdom, have grown weaker since the adoption in the\r\nDominion of a trade policy opposite to that of the mother-land.\r\nShould the new commonwealth of Australia, in its eager desire to\r\ncreate varied industries, decide upon a system of inter-colonial\r\nfree trade, with protection against the rest of the world,\r\nincluding Britain, no one would now anticipate therefrom any\r\nfundamental change {279} in the political relations between\r\nmother-land and colony.\r\n\r\nCompared with all other nations, these conditions seem extremely\r\nanomalous. They are accounted for by the fact that the Empire\r\nitself is in its composition anomalous. In it we find\r\ncommunities existing under widely different conditions, some\r\nwith vast populations concentrated in a small space, while\r\nothers have their inhabitants thinly scattered over immense\r\nareas; some with wealth which lends itself readily to direct\r\ntaxation, others which can only collect revenue easily at the\r\nports; some chiefly engaged in manufacture, others in the\r\nproduction of food and raw material; some with capital and cheap\r\nlabour in such abundance that they can cheerfully face any\r\ncompetitors, others under severe pressure from the competition\r\nof commercially hostile neighbours more rich and numerous than\r\nthemselves. Economic theories are, in fact, being tested\r\nthroughout the Empire under almost every conceivable condition,\r\nto the ultimate advantage, we may hope, of economic truth.\r\nMeanwhile, though no serious jar in the national system has as\r\nyet been caused by the divergence of trade policies, this\r\ndivergence is looked upon by many as an almost insuperable\r\nobstacle to any closer political union. It is urged that a real\r\nnational unity cannot exist without community of fiscal system,\r\nand in support of this position appeal is made to the examples\r\nof the United States, Germany, Austro-Hungary, Switzerland and\r\nCanada. In all of these {280} free internal trade followed upon\r\nthe formation of a Federal system.\r\n\r\nHow, it is often said in England, can we unite more closely with\r\ncountries which in trade matters are almost as hostile to us as\r\nFrance, Germany, or the United States? How, it is said in the\r\ncolonies, can we unite more closely with a mother-land which in\r\ntrade matters makes no distinction between her greatest enemy\r\nand ourselves?\r\n\r\nOf late, as the pressure of hostile tariffs in foreign countries\r\nhas been more severely felt, the tone of reproach is more\r\ndistinct in England than in the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe slightest historical retrospect shows that this is not\r\njustified. The system by which each self-governing division of\r\nthe Empire regulates its trade policy in accord with what it\r\nconceives to be its own interests, treating other parts of the\r\nEmpire exactly as it does foreigners was not initiated by\r\ncolonists, but by the people of the United Kingdom, in\r\nconnection with the adoption of Free Trade in 1846. Previous to\r\nthat period mutually beneficial trade relations, both as regards\r\nexports and imports, existed between the mother-land and the\r\ncolonies. Many of the colonies, and especially Canada, protested\r\nvehemently against this change of national policy and suffered\r\nseverely from the complete reversal of the trade relations which\r\nhad previously existed. Given almost ostentatiously to\r\nunderstand that the mother-land was indifferent to the trade\r\n{281} policy which they pursued, the colonies were free, without\r\nany reproach on their national allegiance, to choose the system\r\nwhich seemed best adapted to their wants. On the one side they\r\nsaw the United Kingdom wonderfully prosperous under Free Trade.\r\nOn the other they saw the United States sweeping along in an\r\nequally wonderful career of prosperity under a system of\r\nProtection. The conditions prevailing in the United States\r\nseemed, of the two, more similar to their own, and it cannot be\r\ndoubted that this example has had much to do with the adoption\r\nof Protective systems in most of the colonies. The wisdom or\r\nerror of the choice remains to be demonstrated, for clearly all\r\nsystems of Protection are yet on their trial. Are they\r\nexpedients to accomplish a temporary purpose, or are they\r\npermanent policies?\r\n\r\nEven in the United States there have been elections which\r\nindicated a distinct wavering of the public mind upon the\r\nquestion. In Canada the party which favours Free Trade is\r\nneither small nor unimportant. In Australia one of the chief\r\nobjects aimed at in Federation is the freedom of inter-colonial\r\ntrade which will be one of its conditions. Protection against\r\nthe outside world will at first probably be another, but Sir\r\nHenry Parkes and other supporters of Federation have expressed\r\nthe most confident belief in the ultimate prevalence of Free\r\nTrade principles over the Australian continent. He would be a\r\nbold prophet who would undertake to say whether Protection or\r\n{282} Free Trade would ten years hence be the policy of the\r\nUnited States, Canada or Australia, strong as is the hold which\r\nthe former now has in each.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a prevalent opinion in Canada, and\r\nin other colonies as well, that the United Kingdom will yet be\r\ndriven to recede to some extent from her Free Trade position. It\r\nis observed that however correct may be the economic principles\r\non which Free Trade is based, national passion has prevailed\r\nover economic truth, and most of the nations of the world\r\ncontinue to erect higher and higher barriers against the trade\r\nof the United Kingdom, thereby falsifying the forecasts of the\r\nearly apostles of Free Trade. More than this, it is seen that\r\nthe United States, while given free access to English markets,\r\nnot only creates a McKinley tariff to keep out English goods,\r\nbut by offering Free Trade to Canada at the price of\r\ndiscrimination against Britain, practically, though perhaps not\r\nintentionally, uses the trade question as a leverage to break up\r\nthe Empire. It is believed that, under the influence of\r\nconsiderations such as these, a decided reaction has in Britain\r\nbegun in the direction of some modified system of Protection\r\nwithin the Empire.\r\n\r\nAre there grounds to justify this opinion?\r\n\r\nCertain it is that many Members of Parliament, representing both\r\nrural and manufacturing constituencies, openly avow their\r\npreference for a discriminating tariff within the Empire, and\r\nfor fighting the commercial hostility of other nations by the\r\nuse of similar {283} weapons, and appear to lose no political\r\nstrength by the avowal. Twice has the Convention of Conservative\r\ndelegates broken away from its leaders, and passed what amounted\r\nto Fair Trade resolutions. Liberal and Conservative\r\nrepresentatives of labour constituencies have alike affirmed of\r\nlate years that they find the working man's mind permeated with\r\nFair Trade ideas, ideas which might become a serious political\r\nforce in any period of prolonged industrial depression. A mayor\r\nof the greatest of English manufacturing towns told me in the\r\nvery home of Free Trade that in his opinion England might yet\r\nhave to revise her commercial policy. The leading\r\nsilk-manufacturer of Yorkshire is an ardent advocate of Fair\r\nTrade principles. The heads of different great woollen and other\r\nmanufacturing firms in the same county have told me that their\r\njudgment inclined them in the same direction. Joseph Cowen, the\r\ndistinguished representative of northern Radicalism has said,\r\nthat he looked upon a British Zollverein as the true ideal of\r\nour national statesmanship. When Sir Charles Tupper urged upon\r\nthe late W. E. Forster the advisability of giving the outlying\r\nparts of the Empire a better commercial footing than foreign\r\ncountries, his reply was: 'Well, I am a free trader, but I am\r\nnot so fanatical a free trader that I would not be willing to\r\nadopt such a policy as that for the great and important object\r\nof binding this Empire together.'\r\n\r\nThe _Times_, commenting upon a speech of Sir {284} Gordon Sprigg\r\nadvocating a commercial union between England and her colonies,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n'There is still a considerable amount of fetish-worship, but the\r\nideas upon which any commercial union must rest will not in\r\nfuture incur the furious and unswerving hostility that would\r\nhave greeted them twenty years ago. It is getting to be\r\nunderstood that Free Trade is made for man, not man for Free\r\nTrade, and any changes that may be proposed will have a better\r\nchance of being discussed upon their own merits rather than in\r\nthe light of high-and-dry theory backed by outcries of the thin\r\nedge of the wedge. The British Empire is so large and so\r\ncompletely self-supporting, that it could very well afford, for\r\nthe sake of serious political gain, to surround itself with a\r\nmoderate fence.'\r\n\r\nAnd again, discussing a resolution passed in the Dominion House\r\nof Commons in favour of preferential trade with Great Britain,\r\nthe same journal has lately said:--\r\n\r\n'We have not disguised our opinion that if the colonies as a\r\nwhole, and without _arrière pensée_, were prepared to enter into\r\na Customs Union with the mother-country on mutually advantageous\r\nterms, there would be a strong body of public opinion in favour\r\nof meeting the offer, if possible, even at the cost of some\r\ndeparture from the rigorous doctrines of Free Trade. ... If, by\r\nnot too great a departure from the strict lines of Free Trade,\r\nit were possible to bind the great self-governing colonies in\r\nclose {285} and permanent commercial alliance with the mother\r\ncountry, securing not only a vast reserve of political strength\r\nbut the command of large and rapidly growing markets, it would\r\nprobably be thought well worth while to incur some sacrifice.\r\nWhen nations like the United States, Russia, and France are\r\nstrengthening their exclusive systems against us, and when\r\ncentral Europe is involved in a network of commercial treaties,\r\nit is not pleasant to contemplate the possibility that, under\r\nprotective tariffs of increasing stringency, our colonial trade\r\nmay slip from us, and the political allegiance of our colonial\r\nsubjects may be gradually broken down.'\r\n\r\nIn expressions such as these, which might be multiplied, those\r\nwho advocate a return to preferential trade relations within the\r\nEmpire find proof of a great change in English public opinion.\r\nBut after all has been said that can be said it is clear to any\r\nunprejudiced observer that on the whole an overwhelming majority\r\nof the people of the United Kingdom still sincerely regard free\r\ntrade with all the world as necessary to the welfare of the\r\nmasses, and to the stability of the vast industries of the\r\ncountry. No political party would as yet dare to face an\r\nelection on a platform of Protection or Fair Trade. The reason\r\nis obvious. Dependence on sources of food supply outside the\r\nEmpire is still so great that any change of policy would be\r\nthought to involve great risk and anxiety. Though a few years of\r\nstrenuous effort would doubtless make the Empire self-sufficing\r\nin the {286} matter of food, still those few years of transition\r\nwould be a critical period. Clear thinkers outside of the United\r\nKingdom recognize this. It is well known how strongly Sir John\r\nMacdonald held the opinion that the Empire would be strengthened\r\nand drawn together by preferential trade between its different\r\ncommunities. Yet he said to me in 1889: 'Till England sees that\r\nwe can feed her or with a little encouragement can do so, we\r\nmust not expect to work out Federation on a trade basis. But as\r\nsoon as we have proved what our North West can do and English\r\npeople see that they can get all the wheat they want from\r\nourselves and the other colonies, the English point of view,\r\nwill change, and trade advantage can be made to supplement the\r\nother forces which make for British unity.' Sir Charles Tupper\r\nargues for immediate discrimination, but he as fully recognizes\r\nthat it should not affect the prices of food for the vast masses\r\nwhich, in England, depend on outside supplies.\r\n\r\nHe has given illustrations which he thinks indicate that a\r\nfiscal arrangement which favours the productions of the colonies\r\nwould not result in raising the price of food materially in\r\nGreat Britain, while it would give stimulus to colonial industry\r\nand increase the colonial market for British manufactures to the\r\ngreat advantage of the British working man.\r\n\r\nHe points out that the Mark Lane prices of corn during the year\r\n1890 and 1891, as shown by the report of the Board of\r\nAgriculture, indicate a fluctuation {287} in price of ten\r\nshillings a quarter, and it was only when the maximum advance of\r\nten shillings a quarter was reached that a half-penny difference\r\nwas made upon the four-pound loaf. From this fact he draws the\r\nconclusion that five shillings a quarter could be imposed upon\r\nforeign wheat without making any appreciable advance in the\r\nprice of bread.\r\n\r\nA second illustration he draws from the meat supply. In\r\nconsequence of the existence of pleuro-pneumonia in the United\r\nStates, cattle sent from that country to Great Britain have to\r\nbe slaughtered upon their arrival, while the freedom of Canada\r\nfrom the disease exempts Canadian cattle from this regulation.\r\nThe advantage given to Canada by this distinction is estimated\r\nby Mr. Rush, the highest American authority upon the subject, at\r\nbetween eight and twelve dollars a head. The result has been an\r\nimmense expansion of this trade for Canada, which last year sent\r\n123,000 head of cattle to England, for which Canadian stock\r\nraisers would receive about a million dollars more than\r\nAmericans would obtain for the same number of cattle, while Sir\r\nCharles Tupper claims that no one has even suggested that any\r\ndifference has thereby been made in the price of meat. Lastly,\r\nhe points to the experience of France and Germany, where, after\r\na much higher duty had been imposed on corn, the cost of bread\r\nwas less than before[1].\r\n\r\n{288}\r\n\r\nBut if the price of wheat be not changed, what, it is asked,\r\nwill be the advantage to the colonies, and what is to be the\r\ncompensation to the mother-country for making the change?\r\n\r\nThe colonial advantage will come from the new direction given to\r\nemigration. The great numbers of emigrants who now go under a\r\nforeign flag to produce the grain and other food which the\r\nUnited Kingdom buys will go to British countries where they will\r\nenjoy the advantage of the easier access to British markets and\r\nby so doing will add to the wealth and strength of the colonies\r\nand the Empire.\r\n\r\n{289}\r\n\r\nTo understand the anticipated advantage to the mother-country we\r\nmust study some extremely suggestive facts connected with\r\ninter-imperial trade.\r\n\r\nMan for man the people of the colonies, leaving out India,\r\nconsume British products out of all proportion to foreigners.\r\nThe figures fluctuate from year to year, but taking the\r\ncountries with which the United Kingdom carries on the greatest\r\namount of trade a sufficiently accurate average can be given of\r\nthe ordinary annual consumption per head of British manufactures\r\nin each. In Germany and the United States this consumption is\r\nabout 8s. per head, in France 9s., in Canada £1 15s., in the\r\nWest Indies £2 5s., in South Africa £3, in Australasia nearly\r\n£8. Thus three or four millions of people in Australasia take\r\nmore of British goods than about fifty millions of people in\r\nGermany, and nearly as much as sixty millions of people in the\r\nUnited States. Only an artificial boundary separates Canada from\r\nthe United States, yet an emigrant who goes north of that\r\nboundary immediately begins to purchase more than three times as\r\nmuch of British goods as one who goes south of it. As a customer\r\nto the British artizan one Australian is worth sixteen\r\nAmericans; one South African is worth seven or eight Germans.\r\nFigures such as these have suggested the remark that 'trade\r\nfollows the flag.' It is perhaps a more adequate explanation to\r\nsay that trade follows not merely the flag, with the protection\r\nand prestige which it gives, but that it follows along the line\r\nof {290} the tastes, customs and habits of life which the\r\nemigrant carries with him; along the line of intimate social and\r\nfinancial connection such as that which exists between England\r\nand her colonies. The lowest prices current do not altogether\r\ndetermine the direction of commerce. Social, political,\r\nfinancial and even sentimental considerations unite to create\r\nthe wants of a people and so in a measure to give tendencies to\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nPutting all these facts together it is claimed that a national\r\npolicy which inclined emigration towards the colonies would\r\ncreate with great rapidity new markets for British products and\r\nwould send back in increasing volume the productions which\r\nBritain wants to buy, while adding greatly to the strength and\r\nself-sustaining capacity of the whole nation. Hence it is that\r\nmany advocates of British unity sincerely believe that the\r\nadoption of preferential trade relations within the Empire is\r\nthe readiest way to the great end in view. They hold that trade\r\nadvantage constitutes the best outward token of national union,\r\nand by its sense of common benefit would do more than anything\r\nelse to make all willing to contribute to national expense.\r\n\r\nThis view is held very strongly in Canada, South Africa and the\r\nWest Indies: less importance is attached to it in New Zealand\r\nand still less in Australia.\r\n\r\nIt should not be wondered at in England that Canadians bent upon\r\nthe maintenance of British connection think of preferential\r\ntrade relations with {291} the mother-land as a way of escape\r\nfrom the anomalous position in which they have of late been\r\nplaced. 'Let it be clearly understood,' says Principal Grant,\r\n'that Canada has only two markets worth speaking of. One of\r\nthese, Great Britain, she shares on equal terms with every\r\nforeign nation, and from the other, the United States, she is\r\ndebarred as long as she is connected with Britain. The former\r\nwould be as open to her as it is now were she to unite\r\ncommercially with the Republic and against Britain, and, were\r\nshe to do so, she would then at once get the other market also.'\r\nIs it right or politic, he asks, that an important part of the\r\nEmpire should be left to such a choice? Principal Grant,\r\nhowever, goes further, and argues that a preferential\r\narrangement within the Empire would only be required as a\r\ntemporary measure, and would really lead to the Free Trade\r\nrelations which are desired with the United States. 'So\r\nall-important,' he says, 'is the British market to the United\r\nStates voter, that the mere prospect of a preference being given\r\nin it to his rivals would be enough to bring him to a business\r\nframe of mind; he thoroughly believes in the \"cash value of his\r\nmarkets,\" and would be ready to give, for what he believes to be\r\na sufficient consideration, that value which he will never dream\r\nof giving for nothing.'\r\n\r\nWhile the Canadian accustomed to the thought of protection would\r\nthus build up the Empire, strengthen the union, and deepen the\r\nsense of nationality by preferential trade relations, the\r\nEnglish Free Trader {292} suggests another solution. He says to\r\nCanada: Throw down your tariff walls against English\r\nmanufactures, so far at any rate as your revenue necessities\r\npermit, and thereby make Canada the one cheap country to live in\r\non the American continent. When your farmer buys his clothes,\r\nbuilds his house, gets his machinery, his earthenware, his\r\nhardware at a far lower cost than the farmer who is being bled\r\nto satisfy the McKinley tariff, he will then have an advantage\r\nover his competitors far greater than could be given by a\r\npreferential tariff in England. Your North-West will be filled\r\nwith immigrants crowding even from the United States to the\r\ncentre of cheap living and therefore cheap production; your\r\nEastern farmer will have an increased profit on the meat, the\r\npoultry, the eggs, the fruit which he sends to the British or\r\nthe American market; British capital will flow freely into the\r\ncountry; railroads, canals, ports, shipping will feel the\r\npressure and the prosperity of inward and outward trade;\r\nmanufactures suitable to each locality will increase with the\r\ngreater prosperity of the country and the diminished cost of\r\nliving. Even the McKinley tariff may be forced to give way in\r\nface of the striking illustration which Canada would give on the\r\nAmerican continent, of the benefits flowing from free commercial\r\nmovement. The farmer of the Western States, handicapped beside\r\nthe farmer of the Canadian North-West, would in all probability\r\nuse his vote to compel the Eastern manufacturer to come to terms\r\nwith England and Canada.\r\n\r\n{293}\r\n\r\nBut even if other nations refused to yield to such influences,\r\nan empire covering one fifth of the world, and capable of\r\nproducing everything required by man, would have before it,\r\nunder a system of free commercial intercourse and common\r\ncitizenship, a period of prosperity unparalleled in the history\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe venerable Earl Grey, in an appeal specially addressed to the\r\nCanadian people--an appeal which has stamped upon every sentence\r\ngood-will for Canada, and sincere regard for her interests--has\r\nurged that the Dominion should not merely throw open its markets\r\nto England, but to the United States as well, and argues with\r\nall the earnestness of his youthful convictions that such a\r\ncourse would not only bring to Canada the same prosperity which\r\nFree Trade brought to England, but, on account of Canada's\r\npeculiar relations to the United States, would go far to break\r\ndown all systems of excessive protection.\r\n\r\nWe have then, in matters of trade, great variations of system\r\nbetween the different communities of the Empire, and great\r\ndifferences of opinion within each of the communities\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nDoes this conflict of thought upon trade policy present an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to national unity? There are those who\r\nclaim that mutually advantageous trade relations furnish the\r\nonly basis on which it is worth while to discuss Imperial\r\nFederation with any hope of practical result. This opinion is\r\nheld alike by some who look to preferential treatment, and {294}\r\nothers who look to exceptional freedom of interchange within the\r\nEmpire for the necessary bond.\r\n\r\nWith this extreme view I have never been able to agree. Even\r\nwithout trade advantage between its parts there are decisive\r\nreasons why the nation should present a united front to the\r\nworld. Unity is essential to safety, as I have tried to prove,\r\nand at any moment the outbreak of a great war may make safe\r\ntrade of more vital consequence for British people than either\r\nFree Trade or trade depending on tariffs. The wealth created by\r\neither must be defended, and with the least possible burden on\r\nthe individual community. A common system of defence therefore\r\nseems of itself a sufficient justification for close political\r\nunion. This is a permanent condition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it can scarcely be questioned that ideas on\r\ntrade policy all around the world are in a state of flux. That\r\nsystems now existing may be modified, perhaps reversed, within a\r\nfew years, is not only possible, but highly probable. The\r\ngreater freedom or greater restriction of trade is a temporary\r\ncondition[2].\r\n\r\n{295}\r\n\r\nThat the temporary difficulty of conflicting tariffs should be a\r\nbar to the attainment of permanent national security, seems, on\r\nthe face of it, absurd.\r\n\r\nIn any attempt at Federal organization it would probably at\r\nfirst be necessary to leave to each community the choice of the\r\nmethod by which its revenues are raised. To do so would not\r\napparently put too great a strain on the admitted flexibility of\r\nthe Federal system. But it can scarcely be doubted that one of\r\nthe first effects of a close political union, in which common\r\nends are constantly kept in view, and the strength and\r\nprosperity of each part are an immediate concern to all, would\r\nbe to break down by degrees all existing barriers to the\r\nadvantageous movement of inter-imperial commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On this point Lord Dunraven says--_Nineteenth Century_,\r\nMarch, 1891: 'The duty on wheat in France in 1882 was only 2 8d.\r\nper cwt.; in 1885 it was raised to 15d. per cwt., or 536 per\r\ncent. According to some economists, the price of wheat should\r\nhave gone up in like proportion, and the masses have had to pay\r\ndearer for their bread. But what are the facts 1 The price of\r\nwheat actually fell from an average of 10.085. per cwt. in 1883,\r\nthe year following the low duty, to 9.295. in 1886, the year\r\nfollowing the increased duty, or 8 per cent. Instead of the poor\r\nman in France having to pay dearer for his bread, he paid less\r\nin 1886 than in 1883, as the following table shows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD           1883   1884   1885   1886\r\nFirst Quality   1.57   1.49   1.39   1.39\r\nSecond Quality  1.35   1.26   1.17   1.22\r\nThird Quality   1.17   1.13   1.04   1.09\r\n\r\nIn Germany, too, I find the same results follow from increased\r\nduties. Wheat went down from 10.30s. per cwt. in 1882, when the\r\nduty was 6d. per cwt., to 9.39s. per cwt. in 1889, or 9 per\r\ncent. when the duty was 2s. 6d., per cwt--or 500 per cent.\r\nhigher, while bread remained at about the same price. Internal\r\ndevelopment appears in both these cases to have more than\r\ncompensated for any restriction of foreign imports, and it is\r\nonly fair to remember that the resources of the British Empire\r\nin respect of food supply are immeasurably greater than those of\r\nFrance or Germany.'\r\n\r\n[2] Prof. Shield Nicholson quotes Adam Smith's sentence: 'To\r\nexpect that the freedom of trade would ever be entirely restored\r\nin Great Britain is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or\r\nUtopia should ever be established in it,' and goes on to say:\r\n'this curious example of the danger of political prophecy-should\r\nsuffice to dispel the apathy generally displayed towards any\r\nconsideration of the fiscal aspects of Britannic confederation\r\n... Nothing is more common than to speak of the complicated\r\ntariffs and the vested interests of the newest colonies as\r\ninsuperable obstacles to any general fiscal reform. As a matter\r\nof historical fact, however, in much less than a century the\r\ncommercial policy of the British Empire has passed, speaking\r\nbroadly, from the extreme of central regulation to the extreme\r\nof non-interference, and there is, _prima facie_, no reason why\r\na reaction should not occur if such a course is shown to be to\r\nthe mutual advantage of the colonies and the mother-country.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{296}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nPLANS. CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n'There is not the least probability that the British\r\nconstitution would be hurt by the union of Great Britain with\r\nthe colonies, That constitution, on the contrary, would be\r\ncompleted by it, and seems to be imperfect without it. The\r\nassembly which deliberates and decides concerning the affairs of\r\nevery part of the Empire, in order to be properly informed,\r\nought certainly to have representatives from every part of it.\r\nThat this union, however, could be easily effectuated, or that\r\ndifficulties and great difficulties might not occur in the\r\nexecution, I do not pretend. I have yet heard of none, however,\r\nwhich appear insurmountable.'----Adam Smith's _Wealth of\r\nNations_.\r\n\r\nTHE advocates of national consolidation have been constantly\r\nsubjected, as everyone familiar with current discussion knows,\r\nto two diametrically opposite forms of criticism. They are\r\nvigorously reproached by writers like Mr. Goldwin Smith for not\r\nstating in detail the method by which their purposes are to be\r\naccomplished; they are ridiculed by others as people who aim at\r\nbinding together by means of a 'cut and dried plan' an Empire\r\nwhich has hitherto depended upon slow processes of growth for\r\nits constitutional development. It will be well to form a just\r\nestimate of these contradictory lines of criticism.\r\n\r\n{297}\r\n\r\nThe demand so often made for a formal and detailed statement of\r\nthe precise constitutional methods by which national unity is to\r\nbe secured appears to me to be put forward in defiance of the\r\nteachings of history. The grounds upon which this opinion is\r\nbased are obvious to anyone who studies the methods by which\r\nFederal organization has been effected in the past.\r\n\r\nTake first the case of the United States. The time between the\r\nrecognition of American Independence in 1783 and the adoption of\r\nthe Federal constitution in 1788 has been well called the\r\n'critical period of American history.' During this period of\r\nstrenuous agitation Alexander Hamilton, Madison, and other\r\nAmerican statesmen had freely discussed in a general way their\r\nideas upon Federal union, and had made many but widely divergent\r\nattempts to outline the main principles upon which it should be\r\nbased.\r\n\r\nStill, when the famous convention which met in 1787, eleven\r\nyears after the declaration of independence, entered upon its\r\ndiscussions, it had to deal, not with any single plan, but with\r\nmany contradictory plans, brought forward by states or\r\nindividuals. It is now known that weeks and indeed months spent\r\nin anxious consultation elapsed before even the most sanguine\r\namong the delegates began to feel assurance that a plan which\r\nwould harmonize conflicting ideas could be devised. Even when\r\nthe Federal constitution was at length drafted, and Alexander\r\nHamilton, at the last session of the convention, made {298} a\r\nfinal plea for its adoption, he emphasized his demand for the\r\nsacrifice of personal preferences by pointing out how remote its\r\nprovisions were from the ideas which he had at the outset\r\nentertained and had indeed supported throughout the discussions.\r\nIt was at a later period that Hamilton and other leaders of the\r\nFederation movement made their contributions to the famous\r\n'Federalist,' a series of discussions avowedly written with a\r\nview to secure popular support for a plan which had previously,\r\nhowever, only been elaborated by the united wisdom of the\r\ntrained statesmanship of the country[1].\r\n\r\nThe discussion of Canadian Confederation had been conducted only\r\nupon general lines up to the time when the leading public men of\r\nCanada, drawn alike from all political parties, met in\r\nconference at Quebec in 1866. The Federal system of the United\r\nStates had given general direction to the public thought, but\r\nthe actual scheme by which Confederation was accomplished had\r\nbeen barely outlined in the minds of a few of the principal\r\ndelegates; the resolutions at first proposed were submitted to\r\nmuch criticism and revision, and the final form of the\r\nconstitution was only adopted after weeks of earnest discussion.\r\nEven Sir John Macdonald admitted that on the quite {299}\r\nfundamental question of whether the union should or should not\r\nbe Legislative, he only yielded his own convictions to the\r\nmanifest objection of the majority in the Conference.\r\n\r\nThe agitation for Federal Union in Australia has gone on for\r\nmany years; the examples of both the United States and Canada\r\nhave been open to Australian study, and hence the easy\r\nconstruction of a system might have been assumed. Yet it was\r\nonly when the responsible statesmen of the different colonies,\r\nand of the different political parties in these colonies, had\r\nmet in general conference that a formal plan other than the\r\nessays of amateurs was placed before the public.\r\n\r\nWe have in our own generation seen the union of Italy and that\r\nof Germany consummated under the strain of intense national\r\npassion, and yet we know that even the chief agents in working\r\nout those great movements could only feel their way as they went\r\nalong, taking advantage of opportunities and advancing with the\r\nadvance of public sentiment--and that it was only when near\r\ntheir goal that they saw clearly the precise form which national\r\nunity would take.\r\n\r\nOne may therefore with some confidence appeal to history in\r\nsupport of the position that no great work of national\r\nconsolidation has ever been carried out which started from a\r\ndefined initial plan. The plan has been the crown of effort, not\r\nits starting-point.\r\n\r\n{300}\r\n\r\nFor this there are two manifest reasons. Years of discussion and\r\nagitation are almost necessary, especially under free popular\r\nconstitutions, before that public opinion can be formed which\r\nenables statesmen to determine what sacrifices or concessions\r\ncommunities are willing to make to secure even a great end.\r\nAgain, only statesmen practically and closely in touch with the\r\npeople, familiar with the passions or prejudices of the\r\ncommunities concerned, and accustomed, moreover, to the work of\r\npractical administration, are able to give adequate\r\nconstitutional expression to aspirations or desires for\r\nunity--necessarily more or less vague even when vehement; they\r\nalone can judge where compromise or concession must be made, or\r\nwhere it would be fatal.\r\n\r\nIt is on such grounds as these that advocates of the more\r\ncomplete political unity of the Empire have hitherto chiefly\r\nconfined themselves, to pointing out the fundamental defects of\r\nthe existing system, to the inculcation of principles, the study\r\nof facts, and the dissemination of information bearing upon the\r\nquestion. They have directed their efforts to bringing about\r\nconferences of statesmen duly qualified to deal with the\r\nquestions at issue, and at the same time to creating a public\r\nopinion which would justify such conferences in taking vigorous\r\naction. They have felt that the formulation of detailed plans\r\nshould be left for statesmen who had received a mandate from the\r\npeople, and who would be responsible to the people for the\r\nresults of their decisions.\r\n\r\n{301}\r\n\r\nThis policy constitutes the best answer to those who ridicule or\r\nreproach them with attempting to bind the Empire together by\r\nsome preconceived system of their own. The only plan to which\r\nthey look forward is such a one as may be the outcome of the\r\nwill of the people and the wisdom of responsible statesmen\r\nrepresenting the different parts of the Empire.\r\n\r\nWhile the demand for a formal and detailed plan is illogical,\r\nthe suggestion of plans is useful and helpful so far as they\r\ngive definiteness to men's thought, and so help to form or\r\nstrengthen public opinion.\r\n\r\nBut in approaching the study of possible plans we are met by a\r\nprimary consideration.\r\n\r\nThere are clearly two ways in which national unity might be\r\nattained. One would be by a great act of constructive\r\nstatesmanship, such as that which gave a constitution to the\r\nUnited States, that which confederated Canada, that which is\r\ndoing the same for Australia, that which in other states has\r\nchanged an old system for a new. Such an effort is what people\r\nhave undertaken when they saw before them a great national\r\nproblem, knew distinctly what they wished to accomplish, and\r\nwere ready to run the risks always involved in radical change\r\nfor the sake of the end to be obtained by new organization. To\r\nmake such an effort requires statesmen with courage to lead, and\r\nwith judgment to plan so as to command public approval; courage\r\nand judgment such as {302} those which unified Germany and\r\nItaly, or those which federated the United States and Canada. On\r\na smaller scale we have in the history of the United Kingdom\r\nexamples of this bold and definite statesmanship, as opposed to\r\nslow constitutional growth and change, in the acts of Union with\r\nIreland and Scotland, or in the Reform Bills of half a century\r\nago which gave to the vast but newly-formed industrial centres\r\ntheir true weight in the government of the country. To make\r\ndecisive constitutional changes to meet distinct national\r\nnecessities is strictly in keeping with our political\r\ntraditions. An attempt to federate the Empire by a great act of\r\npolitical reconstruction would therefore differ from other\r\nevents in our history not so much in kind as in degree. If the\r\ntask to be undertaken seems great, we must remember that it\r\nwould be faced in order to deal with facts of national growth\r\nand change without precedent in human history.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be denied that at any time circumstances may\r\narise which would almost compel such an act of reconstruction.\r\nThe demand of a single great colony to know the terms on which\r\nit might remain within the Empire as an alternative to\r\nindependence would make the question practical at once. A great\r\nstruggle for national safety or national existence would\r\nprobably have the same effect. That the public mind should be\r\nprepared to deal intelligently with such a question is the\r\nstrongest reason for the careful education of popular opinion on\r\nall matters relating to our national position.\r\n\r\n{303}\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another very different method by which the\r\nobject in view may be attained or at least approached with the\r\nprospect of final attainment. Instead of radical change and\r\nreconstruction we may look to a policy of gradual but steady\r\nadaptation of existing national machinery to the new work which\r\nmust be done.\r\n\r\nThis method commends itself more especially to thinkers in the\r\nmother-land, who are accustomed to consider that the supreme\r\nmerit of the British institution consists in the fact that it is\r\nnot a written rule,--not a system struck off at white heat by\r\nthe efforts of legislators, but is, in the main, the result of a\r\nprogressive historical development. To them further progress\r\nwould seem safer if pursued on similar lines. The policy seems\r\nof less consequence to colonists, living as they do in countries\r\ngoing through rapid changes, and lending themselves more readily\r\nto new organization.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of Federation which naturally presents itself to the\r\nmind is one which provides a supreme Parliament or Council,\r\nnational not merely in name but in reality, because containing\r\nin just proportion representatives of all the self-governing\r\ncommunities of the Empire. Such a body, relegating the\r\nmanagement of local affairs to local Governments, and devoting\r\nits attention to a clearly defined range of purely Imperial\r\nconcerns, would seem to satisfy a great national necessity. It\r\nwould secure representation for all the great interests of the\r\nEmpire, it {304} would bring together those best fitted to give\r\nadvice on Imperial matters, and it would be free from that\r\noverwhelming responsibility for petty administration which now\r\nparalyzes, and at times renders ridiculous, the supreme council\r\nof the greatest nation in the world.\r\n\r\nThis, it seems to me, is the ideal which must be kept in view as\r\nthe ultimate goal of our national aspiration and effort. It is a\r\nreasonable ideal, one which, as we have seen, long since\r\ncommended itself to the philosophic mind of Adam Smith, and\r\nwhich has today, under the changed conditions of intercourse,\r\ninfinitely more to justify it, and infinitely less to hinder its\r\nattainment than in his time. Even Burke, to whom it also\r\noccurred as a reasonable political conception, would have\r\nhesitated to employ the phrase, _opposuit natura_, with which he\r\ndismissed it, could he have grasped the possibility of what\r\nsteam and the telegraph have done during the last half century.\r\nThe realization of some such an ideal as this--a common\r\nrepresentative body, Parliament or Council, directing the common\r\npolicy of the Empire, while absolute independence of local\r\ngovernment is secured for the various members--may fairly be\r\nlooked upon as the only ultimate alternative to national\r\ndisintegration, the only thing which can fully satisfy our\r\nAnglo-Saxon instincts of self-government, and give finality to\r\nour political system.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I have found that practical statesmen throughout the\r\nEmpire, even those most devoted to {305} the cause of national\r\nunity, while recognizing that the difficulties constantly tend\r\nto diminish, look upon the immediate realization of this ideal\r\nas impracticable, or as involving too great a political effort,\r\ntoo sweeping a change in the existing machinery of national\r\ngovernment. They turn themselves to the consideration of\r\nmeasures which will by gradual steps and a process of\r\nconstitutional growth lead up to the desired end.\r\n\r\nProminent among such measures must be placed the proposal to\r\nsummon periodical conferences of duly qualified representatives\r\nof the great colonies to consult with the home government and\r\nwith each other on all questions of common concern. The public\r\nrecognition of the right of consultation, the formal summoning\r\nof such conferences by the Head of the State, would of itself be\r\na signal proof to the outside world of the reality of national\r\nunity, a decisive step towards its complete attainment. By\r\nbringing the leading statesmen of the colonies from time to time\r\ninto immediate contact with those of the mother-land, the\r\nopportunity would be furnished for that personal understanding\r\nwhich becomes more and more necessary in the conduct of politics\r\nand diplomacy. In proportion as dignity is given to these\r\nconferences, and as their decisions are carried into effect,\r\ntheir influence on the policy of the Empire would increase till,\r\nit is believed, they would either themselves develop into an\r\nadequate Federal council, or would have gained an authority and\r\nexperience entitling them to indicate the lines on which such a\r\ncouncil could be created.\r\n\r\n{306}\r\n\r\nThe Conference of 1887, though merely tentative, proved how\r\ngreat is the variety of subjects which may usefully come under\r\nthe consideration of such gatherings. New questions are\r\nconstantly arising. A single illustration may be given. The\r\nright of Canada to make independent treaties has been so\r\nstrongly urged by the leaders of the Opposition in the Dominion\r\nParliament that it is difficult to see how, when next in power,\r\nthey can avoid pressing the claim upon the Imperial Government.\r\nIn the constitution outlined by the Australian convention at\r\nSydney 'external affairs and treaties' were among the subjects\r\nspecially reserved for the Federal Government. A prominent\r\nVictorian barrister has pointed out that this provision would\r\nbring up the whole question of the nature and limits of the\r\nImperial connection. Newfoundland is now claiming the right to\r\nform separate treaties with foreign powers, and has thereby come\r\ninto conflict with Canadian interests. It is clear that such\r\nquestions should be settled on broad principles of general\r\napplication. The fixing of such principles would of itself\r\njustify a conference of representatives of all the communities\r\nconcerned. But conferences are occasional, and it would still be\r\nnecessary to provide some means of more continuous contact\r\nbetween the thought of the Governments of the colonies and that\r\nof the mother-land. On this point of an adequate constitutional\r\nnexus we have many important suggestions, to a few of which\r\nreference should be made.\r\n\r\n{307}\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Pollock, in an article contributed to an English\r\njournal in March, 1891, says: 'Is there not any way, short of a\r\ngigantic constitutional experiment, of providing a visible\r\nsymbol and rallying-point for the feeling of Imperial patriotism\r\nwhich has so notably increased within the last ten years? I\r\nthink there is. One part of our constitution retains, not only\r\nin form, but in fact, the vigour of perpetual youth, and is\r\ncapable of indefinite new growth as occasion may require,\r\nwithout doing any violence to established usage. I mean the\r\nPrivy Council. From the Privy Council there have sprung within\r\nmodern times the Board of Trade, the Judicial Committee, the\r\nEducation Department, the Universities Committee, and virtually\r\nthough not quite formally, the Local Government Board, and the\r\nseveral commissions now merged in the Agricultural Board. Why\r\nshould there not be a Colonial and Imperial Committee of the\r\nPrivy Council, on which the interests of the various parts of\r\nthe Empire might be represented without the disturbance of any\r\nexisting institution whatever, and whose functions might safely\r\nbe left, to a large extent, to be moulded and defined by\r\nexperience? ... It might be summoned to confer with the Cabinet,\r\nthe Foreign or Colonial Minister, the Admiralty, or the War\r\nOffice, at the discretion of the Prime Minister or of the\r\ndepartment concerned; and its proceedings would be confidential.\r\n... It is hardly needful to mention the Agents-General of the\r\nself-governing colonies as the kind of persons who {308} should\r\nbe members of the Committee now suggested, being, of course,\r\nfirst made Privy Councillors. ... I believe that such a\r\nCommittee might give us something much better than a written\r\nconstitution for the British Empire; it might become the centre\r\nof an unwritten one.'\r\n\r\nIn the _Nineteenth Century_ for October, 1891, Sir Charles\r\nTupper suggests a plan similar in principle to that of Sir\r\nFrederick Pollock, but more clearly defined. Assuming that at no\r\ndistant date the Australasian and the North African groups of\r\ncolonies will be federated, as the Canadian provinces now are,\r\nhe proposes that each of these three great British communities\r\nshall be represented in this country by leading members of the\r\nCabinets of the countries to which they belong, ministers going\r\nout of office when their own governments are changed, and so\r\npermanently representing the views of the government in power.\r\nSuch a minister should in England be sworn _ex officio_ a member\r\nof the Privy Council, and though not a member of the Imperial\r\nCabinet would be in a constitutional position to be called upon\r\nto meet it on every question of foreign policy or when any\r\nquestion that touched the interest of a colony was being\r\nconsidered. To this suggestion Sir Charles Tupper lends not only\r\nthe great weight of his personal authority, but he supports his\r\nproposal by the expressed opinion of men like Earl Grey, the\r\nMarquis of Lorne, W. E. Forster, and others.\r\n\r\nOnce more, Lord Thring, looking at the question {309} as a\r\nconstitutional expert, has stated his opinion that the best way\r\nin which the colonies could at present directly intervene in the\r\ngeneral policy of the Empire would be by elevating the position\r\nof Agents-General to one akin to that of a minister of a foreign\r\nstate, and by giving them in addition, as members of the Privy\r\nCouncil, the right of constitutional access to the British\r\nGovernment. This, he thinks, would satisfy the immediate\r\nnecessities of the case, and would pave the way for the fuller\r\nrepresentation which must come with the fuller acceptance of\r\nnational responsibility.\r\n\r\nNothing can more fully show the change that has come over the\r\npublic mind than the fact that proposals such as these are now\r\nmade by constitutional authorities and responsible public men.\r\nIt illustrates a complete reversal of the policy which was\r\nassumed without question by the statesmen of the last\r\ngeneration. The discussion has become one not of the principle\r\nof unity, but of ways and means to arrive at the most\r\nsatisfactory constitutional nexus between the mother-land and\r\nher offshoots.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be thought that discovering the precise point of\r\nconstitutional connection is the only or even the most important\r\nstep towards effective unity. While the constitutional question\r\nis being debated there is much which Parliaments can do, much in\r\nwhich every voter in the Empire, by the use of his political\r\ninfluence can assist, to forward the cause of political\r\nunification. Foremost among these practical measures may be put\r\nthe establishment of the cheapest possible {310} postal and\r\ntelegraphic communication. The practical advantages which would\r\nflow from an inter-Imperial system of Penny Postage have been so\r\noften and so effectively presented by those who have given\r\nspecial attention to the question, that it is unnecessary to\r\ndwell upon them here. But from another aspect it may be said\r\nthat when the emigrant of the remotest colony knows that,\r\nbecause he is a British citizen, the penny stamp upon his letter\r\nwill carry the home news of father, mother, brother or sister\r\nover all the extent of a world-wide empire, such a fact will be\r\nmore to the nation than the strength of many ironclads in the\r\nstronger national sentiment, the deeper feeling of national\r\nunity which it will evoke.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of extended and cheapened telegraphic\r\ncommunication, which even now makes possible an extraordinary\r\nsympathy of national thought.\r\n\r\nThe beginning which has been made in co-operation for naval\r\ndefence and in the strengthening of posts essential to common\r\nsecurity, can with advantage be carried much further than it has\r\nyet been.\r\n\r\nThe addition to the judicial committee of the Privy Council of\r\nrepresentative judges of the greater colonies, on the same\r\nprinciple that Indian law is now represented, is a practical\r\nmeasure which would give a more complete judicial unity to the\r\nEmpire, and perhaps lay the foundation of a supreme court of\r\nfinal appeal for the federated nation. These are but {311}\r\nillustrations of lines on which immediate action can be taken\r\nand progress made.\r\n\r\nBut the work of unifying a great nation is not one that can or\r\nshould be left to legislators alone. Statesmen must have behind\r\nthem the strength of a trained and intelligent public opinion;\r\nthe warmth of national passion. In forming such a public opinion\r\nand developing such a passion there is abundant room for the\r\npatriotic effort of every believer in the greatness and goodness\r\nof the cause, whatever may be his walk in life.\r\n\r\nChambers of Commerce, by the careful and practical study which\r\nthey are able to give to commercial relations; by the\r\nopportunities which their associations furnish of bringing\r\ntogether the representatives of those trading interests upon\r\nwhich the Empire has been so largely built up, should be able to\r\nexercise a profound influence on public thought, and provide\r\nimportant information for the guidance of political leaders.\r\n\r\nThe discussion in working men's clubs of the industrial and\r\npolitical relations of the Empire is most desirable. So far from\r\nbeing remote from the ordinary interests of the working man,\r\nsuch discussions would be found to touch more closely than\r\nalmost any others upon his daily work, wages, and food. It may\r\nwith confidence be said, that a working man who does not have\r\nsome fair knowledge of inter-Imperial relations is not fit to\r\nexercise the franchise for the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\n{312}\r\n\r\nThe equipment of all public reading-rooms and working men's\r\nclubs with maps specially designed to stimulate geographical\r\nimagination, and books to furnish accurate geographical\r\ninformation about the Empire would serve a highly useful\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nUpon the journalism of the Empire a great responsibility is\r\nlaid. It is only a few years since even the most prominent\r\nEnglish journals published colonial news under the head of\r\nforeign intelligence. Canadian news came to London by way of\r\nPhiladelphia. All that is now changed. Four or five of the\r\nleading London dailies, and most of the greater provincial\r\njournals, now make the careful and conscientious study of\r\ncolonial problems a marked feature of their work. One suggestion\r\nperhaps remains to be made. If the British interests at stake\r\ndetermine such questions, the time will probably soon come when\r\nin three if not four of the outlying parts of the Empire the\r\ngreatest English journals should have as able and as well paid\r\ncorrespondents as in the great capitals of Europe. The work of\r\nsuch men, devoting their time to the study of colonial\r\nconditions, would do much to make English information accurate,\r\nand to create in the colonies confidence in English opinion on\r\ntheir affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is a crying evil that much of the English news published in\r\nthe daily Canadian press, reaches it, even now, by way of New\r\nYork, and has characteristics specially given to it to meet the\r\ndemands of anti-British classes of American newspaper readers.\r\nCanadian {313} journalism can alone apply the remedy of direct\r\ncommunication carried on under reliable control.\r\n\r\nIn schools there is an immense work to be done. The cultivation\r\nof national sentiment in the minds of the young, on the basis of\r\nsound knowledge, historical, geographical and industrial, is not\r\nonly a legitimate work, but a primary duty for the schools of a\r\ncountry. Especially is this true of countries where good\r\ngovernment rests on the intelligence of the masses. Above all is\r\nit true for a nation which has the great birthright of free\r\npopular institutions; which has more than once stood as the\r\nbulwark of modern liberty, as it may have to stand again; which\r\nhas traditions behind and prospects ahead fitted to fire the\r\nnoblest and purest enthusiasm. Somewhat extended observation has\r\nled me to conclude that there is a very great lack of historical\r\nand geographical teaching in portions of the Empire. The\r\ndeficiency is most marked on the historical side in the\r\ncolonies, and especially in parts of Australia; on the\r\ngeographical side in the mother-land. The remark applies equally\r\nto elementary and to secondary schools. It seems a lamentable\r\nthing that any British child abroad should grow up without\r\nhaving felt the splendid inspiration to be drawn from the study\r\nof British history; a disgraceful thing that any British child\r\nin the mother-land should grow up to exercise the franchise\r\nwithout a fair idea of the geography of the Empire whose destiny\r\nwill be influenced by his vote.\r\n\r\nI appeal to the teachers of our British world, and {314} to all\r\nwho have to do with the direction of its education, to remedy\r\nthis deficiency. The spread of educational facilities has placed\r\nin their hands a wonderful leverage with which to give direction\r\nto the destinies of the Empire. One hesitates whether to press\r\nthis duty most strongly upon those who control the 'Public' and\r\nsecondary schools, which chiefly educate the professional and\r\npolitical classes, or the common schools which give to the\r\nvoting masses most of the early training which they get. Let\r\nboth equally feel the significance of this great national\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThis work of giving education upon the immediate problems of\r\nnational life, begun at school, should be carried on at our\r\ncolleges and universities. The author of the 'Expansion of\r\nEngland' has shown how much can be done from a single centre and\r\nby a single teacher when the highest resources of historical\r\nknowledge and literary skill are turned to the elucidation of\r\nnational problems.\r\n\r\nBy manifold agencies and influences, then, is the problem of\r\nBritish unity to be worked out. Our freedom, our national\r\ntraditions, our institutions, our Anglo-Saxon civilization, are\r\nthe common heritage of all. It is the business of all to labour\r\nfor their maintenance and for their security.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 'In nothing could the flexibleness of Hamilton's intellect,\r\nor the genuineness of his patriotism, have been more finely\r\nshown than in the hearty zeal and transcendant ability with\r\nwhich he now wrote in defence of a plan of government so\r\ndifferent from what he would have himself proposed.'----_The\r\nCritical Period of American History_, p. 342, John Fiske.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Commercial and Strategic Chart of the British\r\nEmpire]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: All spellings have been preserved as\r\nprinted.]",
